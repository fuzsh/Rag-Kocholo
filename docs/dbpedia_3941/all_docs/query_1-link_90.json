        "text": "an unofficial website\n\nwww.altrinchamfc.co.uk\n\nNEWS ARCHIVE\n\nFebruary, 2018\n\n28 February 2018\n\nA THIRD OF THE SEASON TO GO\n\nAltrincham have virtually a third of the season's league fixtures to complete, having played 31 of their 46 allotted matches. Of the 15 remaining games, eight are at home and seven are away. With the recent change to the Stourbridge fixture, Altrincham play four successive home matches after their planned visit to Shaw Lane this Saturday. In contrast their final six matches feature four away trips.\n\nThe only free Tuesdays at present are 20 March and 24 April, the latter being in the final week of the season. One of the vacant Tuesdays is expected to be assigned to the Altrincham v Winsford United Cheshire Senior Cup match and victory in that match would, of course, create a further fixture at some stage.\n\nThe current top six on a points basis are\n\nAltrincham P 31 PTS 67 GD 43\n\nWarrington Town P 31 PTS 60 GD 18\n\nShaw Lane AFC P 29 PTS 57 GD 27\n\nFarsley Celtic P 35 PTS 57 GD 7\n\nAshton United P 31 PTS 55 GD 18\n\nGrantham Town P 31 PTS 54 GD 26\n\nOn a points per game basis, the table would read...\n\n2.16 Altrincham\n\n1.96 Shaw Lane\n\n1.93 Warrington Town\n\n1.77 Ashton United\n\n1.74 Grantham Town\n\n1.63 Farsley Celtic\n\n1.54 Witton Albion\n\n1.48 Workington\n\nAnd on a maximum points achievable basis, the running order would be\n\n112 Altrincham\n\n108 Shaw Lane\n\n105 Warrington Town\n\n100 Ashton United\n\n96 Grantham Town\n\n91 Workington\n\n90 Farsley Celtic\n\n90 Witton Albion\n\nTonight's postponed home match against Stourbridge has been rearranged for next Tuesday, 6th March, at 7.45pm.\n\nMID WEEK FIXTURES\n\nAll EvoStik Premier matches were postponed on Tuesday night; a measure of the severity of the weather is that for Grantham Town it was apparently a first home postponement since 2014.\n\nThe Evo-Stik North was also decimated and matches in the National League had to be postponed as well.\n\nTuesday 27 February 2018\n\nThe EVO-STIK Premier Division\n\nAltrincham P-P Stourbridge\n\nAshton United P-P Stalybridge Celtic\n\nBuxton P-P Workington\n\nGrantham Town P-P Warrington Town\n\nNantwich Town P-P Shaw Lane\n\nThe EvoStik League announces that \"The Northern Premier League's clubs will meet this weekend to decide the future geography of the competition after the Football Association published next season's draft boundaries at Steps 3 and 4 around the new Midlands divisions.\n\nTaking place at the Holiday Inn, Wakefield at lunchtime on Sunday, the meeting of all 68 clubs was planned to coincide with the long-awaited publication of the results of the National League System Review on The Non League Paper's website at 9am on Wednesday.\n\nCarried out by the FA Leagues' Committee to iron out geographical anomalies, cut down on travelling costs and time for fans, players and officials and encourage more Step 5 clubs to climb the pyramid, the biggest shake-up to the structure of Non-League in more than a decade since 2004 will see the creation of new Step 3 and 4 divisions covering the Midlands region.\n\nIn total, the 276 clubs currently playing in Steps 1 to 4 will increase by 20 to 296 when the two new divisions kick-off in August 2018. Across the board, the reshuffle will see the three current Step 3 divisions of 24 clubs increase to four divisions of 22 clubs while the six divisions at Step 4 currently run by the Northern Premier League, Southern League and Isthmian League will rise from 136 clubs playing in six divisions to seven 20 club divisions.\"\n\nThe NL Paper has more details of the plans and a map, and it adds that \"The Northern Premier League is calling a meeting of its clubs to decide whether to remain with a north/south split or to change to an east/west allocation.\"\n\n27 February 2018\n\nTONIGHT'S GAME POSTPONED\n\nFollowing a pitch inspection tonight's game at home to Stourbridge has had to be postponed because of a partly frozen playing surface. This decision comes despite hard work by the groundsman and volunteers to make the pitch playable. Our next scheduled game is at Shaw Lane AFC on Saturday.\n\nBEFORE THE GAME WITH STOURBRIDGE\n\nAfter an abortive trip by Altrincham to Stourbridge where the game was called off at 1.50pm by the match referee, both sides will be hoping for better fortune on Tuesday night, despite the current cold spell. It will be the Glassboys first trip to Altrincham and also the first-ever meeting between our two clubs. Curiously, Stourbridge are the only team in the division yet to draw an away league match; they have won seven and lost seven of their away trips, so far.\n\nOn the eve of the match, Stourbridge reported that \"The Glassboys travel to Altrincham on Tuesday night...\n\nThe postponement of Saturdayâs game at Buxton, the only Premier Division game to fall foul of the weather, denied Stour the chance to build on the previous weekendâs win over the same opposition, and meant that we slipped a place to 15th in the League table. With 16 matches still to play, plus our ongoing involvement in the Birmingham Senior Cup, it looks set to be a busy final couple of months of the season, starting with a tough test at the home of the table-topping Robins.\n\nSince losing two of their first three League games, Alty have been in magnificent form, with only two subsequent defeats in 28 matches. They last tasted defeat on New Yearâs Day when Witton Albion sprang something of a surprise with a 4-3 win at Moss Lane, not least as Alty had conceded just four goals in their previous 16 League fixtures.\n\nSince then the Robins have won four and drawn two...\n\nSaturday saw Altrincham pegged back by a late equaliser at Ashton United as the home side rallied from 1-3 down to salvage a point, whilst the previous Saturday saw Sutton Coldfield Town pushed them close at Moss Lane, before Alty ran out 2-1 winners.\n\nWhilst Altrincham show no real signs of faltering, it is worth noting that they have conceded seven goals in their last four games after conceding only eight in the previous 19, including the four scored by Witton.\n\nOn home turf, Alty have won 11, drawn two and lost two...\n\nThe teams have never met before, with both of this seasonâs fixtures delayed by a combination of Cup commitments and weather, and the Robins are due to visit the War Memorial Ground on Monday, 9th April for the reverse fixture.\n\nPlaying links are few and far between, but recent seasons have seen George Bowerman (above, right), Junior Smikle and Kyle Perry play for both clubs... A club coach is running to the match, departing from the War Memorial Ground at 4pm\".\n\nLADIES' INTO LAST EIGHT\n\nManager of Altrincham FC Ladies, Keith Edleston reports how the team advanced into the quarter-finals of the Argyle Cup on Sunday.\n\nHe writes, \"The first team advanced into the next round of the Argyle Cup with a 2-1 away victory against West Didsbury and Chorlton LFC. Two goals, (one in each half), from midfielder Laura Dodds settled a good game of football although a few nerves set in when West pulled a goal back with a few minutes to go. There were lots of positives to take from an impressive away win with all the team putting a shift in and showing quality on the ball when needed against what is a good West side.\n\nThere was a pleasing debut also from new signing Beth Hayes who got a good 20 minutes under her belt and will definitely improve the team in the coming games. Best wishes to Paul and his team at West for their hospitality and we wish them well for the rest of the season\".\n\nThe starting eleven was: Paula Alarcon-Conde, Georgia Ashton, Louise Edleston, Bliss Molyneaux (capt) Aimee Hopkinson, Laura Dodds, Gail Simpson, Nadine Sproule, Jess Hartopp, Jade Hesketh, Kye Brown. Subs: Beth Hayes, Megan Rowley\n\nGoals: Laura Dodds (x2).\n\nCHESHIRE SENIOR CUP\n\nWinsford United 3-0 Warrington Town, played at Warrington.\n\nWinsford will now travel to Altrincham in the next round on a date to be confirmed.\n\nMike Garnett provides data on previous CSC encounters with Winsford United...\n\nHome P9 W6 D1 L2 F18 A9\n\nAway P5 W2 D2 L1 F5 A9\n\nNeutral P3 W0 D1 L2 F2 A7\n\nOverall P17 W8 D4 L5 F25 A25\n\nEVO-STIK PREMIER NEWS\n\nFrom the News & Star we learn that the \"Depleted Workington Reds have help coming with a Football League club midfielder set to join up on loan. Reds travelled to Barwell on Saturday, where they lost 1-0, with only two substitutes; Conor Tinnion, who was not fully fit, and joint-manager Lee Andrews.\n\n'Iâd been hoping to get two players on loan before Saturdayâs game and almost got one over the line,' said Andrews. 'That should be completed early in the week, although the second one might not happen.'\n\nReds have not won in the Evo-Stik Premier Division this year and conceding a quick double to Barwell was their fifth straight defeat, which has dropped them to 10th in the table. Injuries to Jordan Holt, Josh Calvert and Anthony Wright, with Dan Wordsworth unavailable, cut Reds' options, compounded by the fact that younger players used before, were involved with the Cumbria [county] side.\n\n'Under the circumstances, I thought it was a very good effort,' added Andrews. 'It was a totally committed performance and I thought we deserved something out of it. One mistake cost us... We are still focused on making the play-offs'...\n\nWorkington should be in action again tomorrow [Tuesday] night at Buxton but there looks every chance of that falling foul of the weather... Reds are also away on Saturday when they travel to Stalybridge. And they will also be on the road the following Tuesday when they are due to take on Lancaster in the third round of the League Cup. The winners of that tie will be at home to either South Shields or Cleethorpes in the fourth round.\"\n\n26 February 2018\n\nYOUTHS' NEXT GAME\n\nNext Sunday, 4 March, Altrincham FC Youth are away to St Helens Town in the North West Youth Alliance Open Cup.\n\nAWAY CUP WIN FOR LADIES\n\nOn Sunday in the Argyle Sports Cup, Altrincham FC Ladies won 2-1 at West Didsbury & Chorlton. Their next game is against league leaders FC United of Manchester at Mersey Valley. 25 February 2018\n\nASHTON UNITED 3-3 ALTRINCHAM\n\nAbove: John Johnston, far right, converted the penalty which opened the scoring.\n\nMatch report here\n\nBelow: Mike Ripley's camera shows James Jones heading Altrincham's third goal.\n\nDRAW FOR THE RESERVES\n\nOn Saturday, in The Cheshire Football League, Premier Division, Altrincham FC Reserves drew 1-1 at home to Congleton VR, The next two fixtures are also at home. Next Saturday (3 March) they play against league leaders Knutsford FC and the following Saturday (10 March) they entertain tenth-placed Crewe FC at Egerton Sports Club, Knutsford. Altrincham Reserves currently lie 13th in the table.\n\nSATURDAY'S GATES\n\nSaturday 24 February 2018: The EVO-STIK Premier Division\n\nAtt. 546 Ashton United 3 - 3 Altrincham\n\nAtt. 157 Barwell 1 - 0 Workington\n\nAtt. 326 Halesowen Town 3 - 2 Matlock Town\n\nAtt. 346 Hednesford Town 0 - 2 Warrington Town\n\nAtt. 209 Lancaster City 0 - 2 Rushall Olympic\n\nAtt. 323 Marine 1 - 3 Mickleover Sports\n\nAtt. 327 Nantwich Town 3 - 1 Grantham Town\n\nAtt. 193 Shaw Lane 2 - 0 Coalville Town Paul Clayton 46' Damian Reeves 50'\n\nAtt. 426 Stafford Rangers 2 - 0 Stalybridge Celtic\n\nAtt. 144 Sutton Coldfield Town 0 - 1 Farsley Celtic\n\nAtt. 229 Witton Albion 1 - 0 Whitby Town\n\nOLD BOYS AND LOANEES\n\nKevin Ellison was 39 last week but he is still knocking the goals in for Morecambe. He hit a superb shot and then a header to record a brace on Saturday against Wycombe Wanderers in League Two.\n\nNL Pitchero records the fact that, in midweek, \"Trafford needed penalties to make the final of the Manchester Premier Cup at the Butcher's Arms against rivals Droylsden. The teams had shared a 2-2 draw in 90 minutes with Aaron Burns giving Trafford the lead after 35 minutes which Callum Bagshaw cancelled out 4 minutes later.\n\nSefton Gonzales's penalty, 14 minutes from time, gave the Bloods the lead, but Altrincham loanee Sean Miller took the game to spot-kicks with an 80th minute equaliser.\n\nTrafford won the shoot-out 3-1.\n\nEVO-STIK PREMIER NEWS\n\nOur opponents next Saturday, Shaw Lane report on Saturday's win against Coalville Town.\n\n\"Coalville will rue their chances missed in the first half as Shaw Lane continued their unbeaten run. The Ducks are now seven unbeaten as they keep pushing for a play-off place. But it was the Ravens who had the better of the play and chances in the first 45 minutes. A double save by Ed Wilczynski on 21 minutes kept the home side level...\n\nAfter the break it was a different story and it didnât take long for the home side to find the back of the net. Paul Clayton tucked home from five yards after an Alex Byrne cross from the left was deflected in front of the target man, a minute after the restart.\n\nTop-scorer Damian Reeves made it two nil on 54 minutes with a header inches out. A corner by Byrne was flicked on by James Pollard over keeper Elliott Taylor and Reeves couldnât miss.\n\nCoalville still had chances and Watson smashed an effort onto the crossbar from a free-kick on 68 minutes. The Ducks could have put the game to bed but were also denied by the crossbar. Reeves headed against the frame from a Byrne cross on 78 minutes and then, heading into added time Byrne did the same with his shot from the left side of the box.\n\nCoalville eventually became frustrated and a poor challenge on Byrne by Kyle Dixon a minute later saw the midfielder shown a straight red.\n\nFull Time: Shaw Lane 2, Coalville Town 0.\n\nShaw Lane: Ed Wilczynski, Kieran Lugsden, Ben Gordon, Spencer Harris, James Pollard, David Norris, Alex Byrne, Godwin Abadaki, Paul Clayton (Chib Chilaka 77), Damian Reeves (Ryan Serrant 84), Gavin Rothery (Jake Picton 70). Subs Not Used: Nicky Walker, Niah Payne\".\n\nLast midweek, a \"cup tie saw promotion-chasers Shaw Lane AFC take their place in the semi-finals of the Sheffield & Hallam Senior Cup after a comfortable 4-1 win against Sheffield County Senior League minnows North Gawber Colliery. Although the scoreline was comprehensive enough, the visitors didn't go down without a fight â literally!\n\nSpencer Harris's penalty and a Damian Reeves brace had the Ducks three-up at the break.\n\nLiam Marsden pulled one back from the spot 5 minutes after the restart, but Alex Byrne made it 4-1 just past the hour-mark for a stronger Shaw Lane side than would probably have been the case had it not been two weeks since they played due to the weather.\n\nThe scoreline could have been greater with Byrne and Reeves both hitting the woodwork in the second half, either side of the fourth goal but then the game went awry.\n\nFirstly, Kieran Lugsden had to hobble off the pitch reducing the home side to ten-men for the final 6 minutes, but then the referee had a major decision to make. Following an awful lunge near the dug-outs a crowd of players had words. This resulted in not one, but three red cards! With the brawl at conclusion, the referee sent-off North Gawber`s Scott Chipchase for the initial tackle and Carl Woodhead for a punch.\n\nAfter the two red cards and just a yellow to the Ducks' Godwin Abadaki, North Gawber`s Jake Senior was then sent for an early shower for abusive language. Shaw Lane await to see if theyâll play either Swallownest or Frickley Athletic in the semi-final.\"\n\nBefore Saturday's matches, Sutton Coldfield Town reported that \"With a crucial home game tomorrow against Farsley Celtic, Toothy has signed 3 players in time to make tomorrow's squad. We see goalkeeper Matt Cotton sign from Coalville, central midfielder Louis McGorry sign on loan from Telford and defender Sam Coulson sign from Tamworth\".\n\nCHESHIRE SENIOR CUP\n\nMonday 26 February 2018\n\nCheshire Senior Cup First Round\n\nWinsford United v Warrington Town, to be played at Warrington Town, to determine who visits Altrincham in the next round.\n\nINTEGRO LEAGUE CUP DRAW\n\nQuarter-Finals:\n\nStafford Rangers v Mickleover Sports\n\nBamber Bridge v Ramsbottom United\n\nHednesford_Town v Basford United\n\nLancaster City or Workington AFC v Clee Town or South Shields\n\n24 February 2018\n\nASHTON UNITED 3-3 ALTRINCHAM\n\nThree defensive lapses cost Altrincham two points. In 2018 they have now conceded 11 goals in seven league matches having only conceded ten in their previous 19 league games (and five of those ten were in one game at Workington, where they were reduced to ten men).\n\nAltrincham started the game on a bobbly pitch at Ashton well but did not get the breakthrough till the 32nd minute when Johnston converted a penalty after a foul on Poole. But they fell asleep from the restart and Pritchard equalised a minute later.\n\nAfter a lacklustre start to the second half, two goals in a five-minute spell around the hour mark seemed to have secured an away victory. A superb counter-attack was finished off by Johnston to make it 2-1 then a Jones header span into the net to make it 3-1 (62 mins).\n\nBut, five minutes later, a foul by Moult gave Ashton a freekick from the front edge of the box which Pritchard curled home and in the 89th minute Hampson failed to make a clearance. Posssession was lost, Ashton struck the bar and Chadwick nodded in the loose ball.\n\nMatch report here\n\nApologies for the slower than usual matchday updates today; for some reason the connection at Hurst Cross is extremely slow but the updates have worked fine in every other location we have visited this season.\n\nSATURDAY'S FIXTURES\n\nSaturday 24 February 2018: The EVO-STIK Premier Division\n\nAshton United 3-3 Altrincham\n\nBarwell 1-0 Workington\n\nBuxton P-P Stourbridge\n\nHalesowen Town 3-2 Matlock Town\n\nHednesford Town 0-2 Warrington Town\n\nLancaster City 0-2 Rushall Olympic\n\nMarine 1-3 Mickleover Sports\n\nNantwich Town 3-1 Grantham Town\n\nShaw Lane 2-0 Coalville Town\n\nStafford Rangers 2-0 Stalybridge Celtic\n\nSutton Coldfield Town 0-1 Farsley Celtic\n\nWitton Albion 1-0 Whitby Town\n\nBEFORE THE GAME\n\nIn advance of Saturday's game, Ashton United said that \"Itâs another big game at the top end of the Evo-Stik Premier Division as Ashton welcome runaway leaders Altrincham to Hurst Cross. Banimâs men have only lost one of their last 12 league games and that solitary loss came against the Ammies in a 3-2 defeat at Moss Lane last month.\n\nThe visitors will come into the game on the back of a 2-1 home in over Sutton Coldfield, thanks to Max Harropâs goal of the season contender, and John Johnsonâs penalty in the second half ensured that Altrincham increased their lead at the summit. Altrincham are in fine goal scoring form this season, finding the net 68 times in just 30 games. They also boast an impressive defensive record too, conceding only 25 goals so far this campaign.\n\nDespite losing the reverse fixture, Ashton can go into the game encouraged with their home form as the Robins havenât lost at home since September in the league when Hednesford Town took all three points at Hurst Cross.\n\nThis week our one to watch is ex-Robin Max Harrop, the 24-year-old started his career at Bury in 2010 and, following numerous loan spells away, Harrop joined Nantwich Town in 2013. After his two-year stint he then went to Hurst Cross and joined Ashton United but, after only five appearances, he then joined Rammsbottom United for another short period. In August 2017, Harrop joined Altrincham and has scored five goals so far this term including a stunner vs Sutton Coldfield\".\n\nAdmission prices:\n\nAdults - Â£10\n\nConcessions - Â£6\n\nSATURDAY'S FIXTURES\n\nSaturday 24 February 2018: The EVO-STIK Premier Division\n\nAshton United v Altrincham\n\nBarwell 1-0 Workington\n\nBuxton P-P Stourbridge\n\nHalesowen Town 3-2 Matlock Town\n\nHednesford Town 0-2 Warrington Town\n\nLancaster City 0-2 Rushall Olympic\n\nMarine 1-3 Mickleover Sports\n\nNantwich Town 3-1 Grantham Town\n\nShaw Lane 2-0 Coalville Town\n\nStafford Rangers 2-0 Stalybridge Celtic\n\nSutton Coldfield Town 0-1 Farsley Celtic\n\nWitton Albion 1-0 Whitby Town\n\n23 February 2018\n\nCOMMUNITY VACANCIES\n\nAltrincam FC Community Sports has vacancies for the roles of Casual Sports Coach and Caretaker.

Gavin Rothery 22 February 2018\n\nROYALS' REPORT\n\nSutton Coldfield Town have produced a report on last Saturday's game against Altrincham, headed \"Late drama at Altrincham robs The Royals of a hard fought point\".\n\nSutton traveled to top of the league Altrincham on the back of several improved performances since Neil Tooth to over as manager but it was always going to be a very tough ask...\n\nAn early move saw Sutton have the first chance almost from the kick off when Karl Hawley shot tamely at the keeper. Sutton continued their early pressure and a defender almost gifted them the opening goal when he cleared just over the bar. A good ball in the 13th minute to Tyler Little allowed him to cut in and beat the diving keeper and Sutton were ahead which was just reward for their early pressure.\n\nAltrincham hit back and Max Harrop equalised with a great 30 yard shot, after the ball was given away in midfield, that gave Jon Brown in the Sutton goal no chance...\n\nWith the game heading towards a 1-1 draw, a foul by James Beresford in the 85th minute gave Altrincham a penalty which John Johnson converted.\n\nDominic Dell came on as a substitute but only lasted about 5 minutes before being red carded.\n\nThis was a very spirited performance against a very good team and was yet another much improved performance giving hope that Sutton can yet avoid relegation.

His opposite number, Ryan Neild, also stopped three.\n\nThe visitors had led at the break through James Foleyâs goal after Will Jones and Owen Dale had combined in the build-up.\n\nPablo Mills levelled with a header shortly after the interval before substitute Steven Tames restored Wittonâs lead when he fired low into the corner from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nLouis Briscoeâs maiden strike for Sports hauled them level again before Tames made it 3-2 with six minutes left when he pounced on a rebound after Jonesâs shot had been parried.\n\nHowever Mills netted a second time with a header for the hosts, who rode their luck when Jonesâs header hit the woodwork in added time.\n\nNick Ryan, Prince Haywood and Michael Wilson all scored for Witton in the shoot-out, but King stopped Danny McKennaâs sudden-death effort before Andy Dales converted to send Mickleover through to the competitionâs last-eight\".\n\nâHalesowen Town \"can confirm that, after lengthy discussions, they are in a position to name the investors that are in place to complete the purchase of the club. â\n\nHalesowen Chair, Karen Brookes, will be making the announcement exclusively on the pitch with Black Country Radioâs Adam Parkes before the game against Matlock Town FC on Saturday 24th February. â\n\nThis is an exciting chapter in the history of our great club.\"\n\n21 February 2018\n\nALTY v HOMOPHOBIA\n\nAbove, courtesy of club photographer Gavin Rathbone, we see six of Alty's team in the \"Football v Homophobia\" t-shirts that the team wore before last Saturday's match against Sutton Coldfield Town. Pictured, left to right, are Ben Harrison, James Jones, Jake Moult, Connor Hampson, Shaun Densmore and Max Harrop. As can be seen, a number of the players also wore special rainbow laces to underline their support for the cause.\n\nANONYMOUS DONATION\n\nAltrincham FC Press and Media Officer John Edwards writes...\n\n\"Saturday will be remembered for poignancy as well as league points at The J.Davidson Stadium after the passing of another Altrincham supporter, as well as David Cameron, was marked with a heartfelt tribute.\n\nFollowing the shock of David's untimely death at the age of just 32, a minute's applause rang round the ground in memory of him, shortly before the start of Alty's 2-1 win over Sutton Coldfield Town.\n\nNow it has emerged there was another equally sincere but less public act of remembrance around 20 minutes after the final whistle. A knock at the main entrance was answered by doorman Peter Lewis, who was handed an envelope marked 'For the attention of Grahame Rowley'.\n\nWhen Grahame opened it, he found banknotes and a simple but moving message that read, 'Please accept this donation in memory of my husband.'\n\nReflecting on a gesture that rounded off an emotional day for everyone connected with the club, the Alty chairman said, 'There was no name on the note, and the lady didn't say who she was when Peter answered the door. She just asked him to pass the envelope on to me.\n\n'I was taken aback, to say the least, when I opened it. It was a generous donation and a lovely, kind way of marking her husband's support for the club, which we can only assume was the case.\n\n'We would love the chance to meet her and express our gratitude, as well as condolences, if at all possible. If she would rather remain anonymous, we would, of course, fully respect her wishes, but it would be lovely to say hello, either in person at the club, where she would be made very welcome, or by phoning 0161 928 1045 or e-mailing me\".\n\nAFTER THE GAME\n\nAlty TV has a post-match interview with Phil Parkinson, Jordan Hulme and John Johnston, conducted after the game last Saturday, by Brian Flynn.\n\nTUESDAY GAMES\n\nThe EVO-STIK Premier Division\n\nRushall Olympic 1-2 Stafford Rangers (Kyle Perry netted the winner)\n\nWhitby Town P-P Grantham Town\n\nALTY TWO IN LEAGUE TOP TEN\n\nAltrincham have two strikers in the top ten scorers in the EVO-STIK Premier Division, as listed on the league website.\n\nLiam Hardy 25 (Buxton, goals 20+5 penalties)\n\nLee Shaw 24 (Grantham Town 21+3)\n\nJordan Hulme 20 (Altrincham 20+0)\n\nIf penalties are discounted, Jordan lies second in the rankings behind Grantham's Shaw.\n\nAnd, if you exclude James Walshaw, who is listed fourth on the league list, as he is now playing at a lower level for Scarborough Athletic, another Alty player, Josh Hancock is listed by the league in seventh place. However, the League has credited him with 14 league goals. As previously noted this is wrong; Josh has 13 goals, but the league wrongly attributes Tom Peers's goal against Nantwich to Josh. Nevertheless, the Alty duo are the leading strike duo in the division.\n\nEVO-STIK PREMIER NEWS\n\nThe News & Star reported that \"A win in [Tuesday's] Integro League Cup tie against Marine could be the boost Workington Reds need says joint chairman John Mackay.\n\nAfter a poor run of form in the league, Mackay is hoping that his side can turn things around...\n\n'Yes we are having a bad spell in the league but it was always going to happen,' said Mackay... 'But that does not make us a bad team overnight. We have a genuine bunch of lads who are trying their best. They didn't play as well as normal on Saturday but days like that happen'...\n\nJoint manager Lee Andrews has some tough calls to make this week as Reds will follow up tonight's clash with a Cumberland Cup game against Workington Athletic on Thursday night, before getting back to the league on Saturday. And all parties agree that the league has to take priority, so squad players and reserves will also be used to bolster the side, who are already missing Anthony Wright and Josh Calvert through injury.\n\n'We will have to mix and match for both games I would have thought,' added Mackay... 'We can't afford to lose any more players or be too tired for Saturday... Hopefully these young lads will come in and give us a lift to keep some of our other players fresh for Saturday'\"\n\nThe Stoke Sentinel reports that \"Stafford Rangers need to 'change the mentality' to avoid getting sucked into a relegation scrap, says manager Neil Kitching. Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Farsley Celtic means Boro have won just two of their past 14 league games, and three of 19 in all competitions (though they have progressed on penalties after draws in two cup games).\n\nThat form has seen them slip to 19th in the Northern Premier League. They are still some 12 points off the bottom two teams, with games in hand...\n\n'\"We've got to start nicking some results or we're going to start getting dragged into some trouble,' he told the Newsletter... 'Perhaps we've got to change the mentality, because there's not enough in that dressing room that are scrapping at the minute. I get the feeling they think they did okay against Matlock or last weekend, and they can relax a bit. But they can't and I've warned them that there's five or six teams below us scrapping for points and putting their bodies on the line... I've put it on the line to them and said 'you need to start doing more'...\n\nBoro travel to Rushall Olympic tonight before hosting Stalybridge Celtic at the weekend. Those are both teams around them in the table, which could look a lot different if the win them both. But Kitching says...'We've had a big chat, because we're just moseying along, nicking a point or the odd win in three,' he said. 'It's not good enough for me or a club of this size... I said to them \"You're all thinking might nick a point at Rushall and win at home to Stalybridge\", but we shouldn't be looking ahead and thinking \"this might happen\" or \"that might happen\".\n\n'We're too interested in the intricates and final third stuff, but I want people that are going to turn up and scrap, battle, fight and put their bodies on the line'...\n\nBoro have used 33 players this season, but do not have the resources to keep on bringing in new faces. 'We can't keep bringing new players in, we've got to get it out of the squad of players we've got,' said Kitching. 'We've got five or six key first-team players injured or suspended, but we can't use that as an excuse'\".\n\nVeteran midielder Tom Bates has joined Jimmy Ginnelly's touchline team at EVO-STIK League Barwell as a player-coach.\n\nThe Evo-Stik League reports that \"Veteran midielder Tom Bates has joined Jimmy Ginnelly's touchline team at Barwell as a player-coach. A popular figure in the dressing room, who rejoined the Leicestershire club for a third spell four years ago, the 32-year-old midfielder started in his new role on Saturday when he gave a short team talk before the Canaries drew 1-1 at home with Ashton United.\n\nAs part of his new duties at Kirkby Road, the former Atherstone Unnited, Bedworth United, Coventry City, Daventry Town, Leamington, Hinckley United and Nuneaton Griff star will also be scouting potential signings for Ginnelly as well as the club's upcoming opponents\".\n\n20 February 2018\n\nFIXTURE CHANGE\n\nAltrincham FC have been advised that the away game at Stourbridge, which was recently rearranged to Monday, 5 March, after being postponed because of a waterlogged pitch, has been moved again. For reasons that are currently unknown, the match will now take place on Monday, 9 April. The change still gives Alty two away games in the space of three days, as we now travel to the Midlands after a Saturday match at Lancaster City.\n\nIn case you missed the new dates announced last week for Altrincham fixtures, here they are again, now incorporating the newly revised Stourbridge date.\n\nRight: A very damp Silverlands on the day that our match at Buxton was postponed.

I remember at Nantwich last season, we were chasing Blyth for top spot, and it just demoralises you when you look to see how they've got on every time and find they've won again.\n\n'We asked the players for a quick start, but, in fact, we made a terrible start. Max Harrop (left) was the only one really at it in the first 20 minutes, and that was another great strike from distance for the equaliser. Early on, when we were nowhere near, he was the one getting on the ball and trying to get us playing. Some of his switches of play were fantastic, and he has been near-enough perfect since moving into that central role.'\n\nShaun Densmore hobbled off with a knee injury in the first half, and Sorvel added, 'Dens just opened his knee out a bit in a tackle. He tried to persevere with it but had to come off. We'll see how he does during the week, but we hope he should be OK for Saturday's game at Ashton United.\n\n'Tom Hannigan is getting there as well and was potentially fit enough to have been on the bench against Sutton Coldfield'\".\n\nOLD BOYS\n\nNL Pitchero reports that \"Making his debut for Glossop North End in Saturday`s disappointing 5-0 defeat at Colne FC on Saturday was the experienced Cavell Coo. The 30-year-old defender had been in his second spell with Evo-Stik Premier side Ashton United. [He played against Alty recently].\n\nHis consistency and high-quality performances were rewarded as he won the Robinsâ Directors player of the year award in 2016. Coo has previously played for various clubs, including Crewe Alexandra, Altrincham, Witton Albion, FC Halifax Town, Mossley AFC, Curzon Ashton, Salford City and FC United of Manchester\".\n\nAlso from NL Pitchero we learn that \"Curzon Ashton have signed Jude Oyibo from Glossop North End. Oyibo is a winger who has previously played for Altrincham, Stockport Town and Stalybridge Celtic. His pace down the flank makes him into a crowd pleaser, and after joining Glossop from Stalybridge he has certainly showed some of that excitement in his twenty-seven games and 7 goals.\"\n\nEVO-STIK PREMIER NEWS\n\nShaw Lane AFC report that manager \"Paul Quinn names his new Assistant Manager. Rob Wilson will join the Ducks as new Assistant Manager and brings with him a wealth of experience.\n\nManager Paul Quinn and Chairman Craig Wood have moved quickly to replace John Reed who departed for Gainsborough Trinity at the end of last week. Wilson played over 300 football league games including over 200 for Fulham FC and was capped for the Republic of Ireland at under-21 level. The former midfielder also had spells with Huddersfield Town and Rotherham United before retiring from full time football in the early 90s.\n\nAfter finishing his playing career Wilson completed his coaching qualifications before joining Huddersfield Townâs academy staff where he coached for 7 years. Wilson later joined up with Paul Quinn at Brighouse and helped the club win promotion to the Evo Stik league in 2014 before taking a break from the game in 2016.\n\nWilson is now looking forward to the new challenge at Shaw Lane and said, 'I am delighted to be joining up with Paul, Iâm really looking forward to working with the staff and players to help drive the club forward... As a team we are in a great position and we will all be doing everything we can to achieve the highest possible finish this season'.\n\nQuinn commented...'His experience will be invaluable for players and staff alike'\".\n\nAlso Shaw Lane \"will host another cup tie if we beat North Gawber Colliery FC in the Quarter-Finals... If we beat North Gawber Colliery FC in the Quarter-Final, due to be played Wednesday 21st February, we will face either Swallownest FC or rivals Frickley Athletic FC. We beat Frickley in the final last season at Bramall Lane... The other tie saw Penistone Church drawn at home to Maltby Main FC.\"\n\nAt Warrington Town \"Lee Andrews's squad options have been reduced following the announcement that midfielder James Earl has left the club. Originally with the club briefly in 2008, James returned to Borough Park in 2015 and, for the past two and a half seasons, has been an important member of the squad.\n\nDuring that period he has made 79 starts for the team and been named as a substitute on a further 30 occasions. He has netted seven goals whilst on first team duty. In recent weeks, he hasnât had much field time\".\n\nStill at Borough Park, the News & Star reports that \"Workington are still looking for their first league points of 2018 after slipping to a fourth successive defeat. After a splendid 17-match unbeaten run, Reds have only had FA Trophy progress to savour so far this year as play-off hopes have receded.\n\nThis was another game in which the Cumbrians should have had something to show for their efforts, even though they were short of their best. The rhythm and intensity which under-pinned that long unbeaten run is not there, with more uncertainty and less drive about their play these days. To add to the problems, as they face the prospect virtually of playing twice a week for the rest of the season, another injury added to the disappointment of the result.\n\nAnthony Wright suffered a hamstring pull and had to be replaced after only 18 minutes. The only consolation from that unfortunate episode was that his replacement Rob Wilson, who has spent more time on the bench recently, emerged as one of Redsâ best players.\n\nReds had looked more than comfortable in the first half, so it was a major disappointment when Rushall scored right at the end...\n\nThe second half never really came alive until the final quarter... Rushall were dangerous on the break, as Reds pushed for an equaliser. Once, they had four against one but Gari Rowntree got back to help out and block the shot...\n\nRushall: Slinn, Webb, Smikle, Maye, Hull, Whittall, Waldron, Hawker, Dubidat (Archer 78), Landell (Sarmento 66), Singh (Sangha 68). Subs (not used) Adelekan, Fonovich.\n\nWorkington: Taylor, McLuckie, Rowntree, Wordsworth, Douglas, Wright (Wilson 18), Symington, Holt, Allison, Waterston (Joel 75), Tinnion. Subs (not used) Smith, Mellen, Whitehead\".\n\nAcross the country, Whitby Town say that \"Andy Monkhouse could be in line to return to Chris Hardyâs starting line-up after serving his one-match ban, as Grantham Town visit the Turnbull Ground. Monkhouse sat out of Saturdayâs 2-1 win over Nantwich Town, after picking up a red card in the draw at Stafford Rangers.\n\nThe midfielderâs return gives Hardy a selection headache... 'Weâre looking for selection headaches because we had a late pull out with James Fairley [on Saturday],' Hardy said. 'He had to pull out of the squad, which was disappointing. We need bodies in there. Able bodies; fit bodies so Monksâs return will only benefit us'...\n\nLuke Bythway will also sit the visit of the Gingerbreads out with a knee injury, whilst captain Steven Snaith serves the second game of his suspension. Hardy will also have to do without the services of Matthew Tymon. The striker... misses out due to work commitments. Whitby go into the game on the back of a six-game unbeaten run...\n\nThe fixture will be Granthamâs first outing since their 1-1 draw with Witton Albion on February 3, and they are still yet to lose in 2018, sitting third in the Evo-Stik Premier. The Gingerbreads also have the joint-best away record in the division, notching up eight wins on the road so far this term.\n\nThe visitors will have to do without defender Tom Batchelor, who is ruled out through suspension, whilst Luke Shaw continues his recovery from a long-term injury.\"\n\nAccording to the Stoke Sentinel \"Stafford Rangers chairman John Bromley says it is imperative that the club are not shifted to a southern division next season. New divisions at step three and four of non-league have been agreed in principle by the Football Association in a major shake-up of the National League system structure.\n\nStep three, where Rangers play in the Northern Premier League, will run with a fourth division, while there will be an additional one at non-leagueâs fourth tier as footballâs governing body look to reduce costs and travelling times.\n\nCurrently, the Isthmian Premier, Southern Premier and Northern Premier League premier divisions have 24 teams each. Under the new proposals that number is likely to be reduced to 22, with step four leagues lowered to 20. Rangers want to be placed into a centrally-based league, to reduce travel times and costs, but fear they may end up in a more southerly division.\n\n'Stafford Rangers do not wish to become one of the most Southern-based clubs in the Northern Premier League next season,' said Boro chief Bromley. 'We are applying for the central league, our management team and most of our players are from the central region. Who knows if they will want to travel even further than they do now? Our mileage would increase by about 1,000 miles, which would lead to a 33 per cent increase in coach travel costs.\n\n'Our supporters are fantastic but will they want the extra expense of the increased travelling? It will be a really important decision that will have to be made that will have a massive impact on our management team, players and supporters and on our finances. I hope the powers that be will have a duty of care for us or are they going to financially support us for the coming season?'\"\n\n19 February 2018\n\nMURDER MYSTERY AT THE JDS!\n\n\"On Friday 16th March 2018, the Altrincham FC Community Sports Hall at the J Davidson Stadium will be the venue for an exciting murder mystery evening, based on a fictional end-of-season Altrincham FC Awards Dinner, filled with intrigue, suspicion, and of course, MURDER!\n\nAs well as enjoying a delicious two-course buffet, guests will be able to take part in a fully interactive murder mystery event, performed by eight professional actors.

Below is Jake's article from Saturday's game...\n\n\"After so many recent frustrations at the hands of the weather, it's good to be back in action this afternoon as we welcome Sutton Coldfield Town to The J.Davidson Stadium.\n\nFor all the best efforts of our ground staff, and Buxton's, we've had one postponement after another over the past couple of weeks, which has been hugely frustrating for all concerned.\n\nLike so many of our supporters, we have travelled in hope and actually made it to the ground before hearing the game is off, though, as players, we have at least had the consolation of being able to train and put some useful work in before returning home.\n\nThat's no substitute for playing, of course, and it is being denied the chance to get out there and keep the momentum going that has been the biggest frustration for everyone in the changing room.\n\nSuch was our form, prior to the bad weather, and so intent we were on putting more points on the board, that every time a game finished, we couldn't wait for the next one to begin.\n\nRight: James Poole.\n\nAt times, we've been kept waiting longer than we would have liked, though we did at least manage to dodge the downpours and stage a match a week last Tuesday, when Ashton United visited The J.Davidson.\n\nWe could hardly have wished for anything better than going 2-0 up inside 15 minutes, and though we were disappointed at letting Ashton in for a couple of goals near the end, no-one could dispute we were well worth the three points. Max Harrop got us off to a flyer with an exceptional strike from outside the area that seemed to settle him down for what was a superb performance at the heart of midfield. We've seen him do it on the training pitch many a time, so it came as no surprise when he set his sights from distance and arrowed a shot into the top corner.\n\nJames Poole's header for the second, from a superb cross by Connor Hampson, was all about reading the situation and timing his run to perfection. Once he'd done that, I always fancied him to win the header and stick it past the keeper, and it was well deserved for a player who's in a rich vein of form at the moment.\n\nIt was 3-0 in the second half after another reminder of how you can't keep Jordan Hulme out of the action. Overall, it might not have been his best night, but the great thing about Jordan is he never gives up. While others might let their heads drop and allow frustration to get the better of them, he channels it in the right way and redoubles his efforts to make a positive impact.\n\nIt was there again with another great individual goal that showed he's worth his weight in gold, especially when you consider Ashton's late fightback meant it was the one that kept our noses in front.\n\nAway from events on the pitch, I was extremely sorry to hear about the death of Alty fan David Cameron at the age of just 32, and, on behalf of all the players and staff, I'd like to pass on our heartfelt condolences to David's family. I feel there is a real connection between this squad and our supporters, and we all share the sense of shock at such tragic news.\n\nFor me, that connection is pivotal to the success we've been having on the field. Some of the more experienced players who have been here a while have given a lot to the club but, at the same time, owe a lot to the club and the supporters. What we are striving for this season means a lot, and there will be no prouder man than me if we can get over the line and see the job through.\n\nJake\".\n\nNEXT GAME\n\nAltrincham have no midweek match owing to the much delayed replay between Warrington Town and Winsford United to determine our next opponents in the Cheshire Senior Cup. So, Alty's next match is on Saturday 24 February whe w travel to Ashton United. As previously announced, it is uneconomic to run a supporters' coach for such a short journey, which can be made by car or public transport.

The home side started poorly and had Hawley got in a better shot the hosts could have been behind inside forty seconds. Indeed, it was the Royals who took the lead, in the 13th minute, when Alty stood off Hawley and allowed the former Stafford man to feed the overlapping Lyttle. From right of goal he drove a fine, low shot past Thompson.\n\nAltrincham slowly improved and they levelled the score eight minutes later. A superb 22 yard shot from Harrop gave keeper Brown no chance.\n\nOn a soft surface Altrincham found it hard to create clear openings and it took a penalty, ten minutes from time, to decide the outcome. Hancock got to a ball just inside the box fractionally ahead of a defender who tripped him to concede the spot-kick. Johnston coolly converted the penalty, having come on as a substitute during the second half after an injury lay-off.\n\nThe action was not over as Sutton Coldfield substitute Dell lasted just four minutes before punching Harrop in reaction to a foul by the Alty man and being shown a red card in the 89th minute.\n\nMatch report here.\n\nAbove: John Johnston celebrates converting his penalty at the Golf Road end..\n\nSATURDAY FIXTURES\n\nSaturday 17 February 2018\n\nAltrincham 2-1 Sutton Coldfield Town\n\nBarwell 1-1 Ashton United\n\nCoalville Town 1-4 Lancaster City\n\nFarsley Celtic 1-0 Stafford Rangers\n\nMarine 1-0 Halesowen Town\n\nMatlock Town 2-3 Witton Albion\n\nRushall Olympic 1-0 Workington\n\nStalybridge Celtic 2-2 Hednesford Town\n\nStourbridge 2-1 Buxton\n\nWarrington Town 3-1 Mickleover Sports\n\nWhitby Town 2-1 Nantwich Town\n\nLOANEE UPDATE\n\nHednesford Town report that Altrincham winger \"Mason Walsh has opted to return to Altrincham after the Northern Premier League leaders made an approach for his services again\". Mason was sent off recently whilst playing for the Pitmen and, following his earlier red card in Altrincham colours in the Integro Cup, is believed to be facing a four-match ban.\n\nHowever, midfielder Laurence Taylor's loan at our neighbours Trafford has been extended. And now joining Laurence (right), and fellow loanee Sean Miller, at Shawe View is Darius Palma. The 19 year-old forward had a recent loan spell at Kidsgrove Athletic.\n\nFOOTBALL v HOMOPHOBIA\n\nAltrincham FC Press and Media Officer, Brian Flynn, has issued the following press release:\n\nAltrincham FC Supporting the Football v Homophobia campaign\n\n\"Evo-Stik Premier Division leaders Altrincham FC are supporting the Football v Homophobia campaign.\n\nThe Robins are aiming to bounce back to the Vanarama National League North at the first time of asking, and Saturday's home encounter pits the league leaders against Sutton Coldfield Town who are currently bottom of the table, trailing West Midlands rivals, Halesowen Town, on goal difference, after both teams were deducted points this week for fielding ineligible players.\n\nIt's also an important fixture for the club's Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) team, who are gaining a reputation in non-league football for going the extra mile to ensure everyone feels welcome at the J.Davidson Stadium, where the club plays its home games.\n\nThis weekend's fixture will be dedicated to the Football v Homophobia campaign and is part of a series of steps undertaken by Alty to reach out to different parts of the community in and around South Manchester.\n\nJordan Tyms, the club's D&I officer, says there is a long-term strategy to make the 6,000 plus capacity stadium a place where football is accessible to all.\n\n'The club took a service review with supporters and partners, and we are now in a five-year-plan, in which we want to be more inclusive, so that as many people as possible come and watch games here and enjoy being part of the club.'\n\nAbove: Altyâs âFans For Diversityâ Shirts were worn against Rushall Olympic on Non-League Day.\n\n'Last October, we were one of four clubs nationally that was selected as a \"Fans for Diversity\" club by the Football Supporters' Federation and Kick It Out. One element of our inclusion strategy is to welcome more LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender) supporters, and Saturday's game is an opportunity to make that more widely known.'\n\nAltrincham wore a special 'Fans for Diversity' kit when they played Rushall Olympic in an Evo-Stik Premier Division game in October.\n\nIn addition to the important business of trying to beat Sutton Coldfield to maintain or extend the club's nine-point lead at the head of the table, there's another fixture being staged in the morning - an Alty Supporters' team is taking on LGBT-inclusive club Village Manchester FC in a friendly in nearby Bowdon for the Alty FC FvH Cup.\n\nBefore kick-off back at the J. Davidson Stadium later in the day, the first-team players will wear Football v Homophobia T-shirts, pairs of Rainbow Laces will be available, and all supporters will be given branded postcards which challenge stereotypes and provide education around how to report homophobic abuse.\n\nSeason-ticket holders and members of the two Manchester giants, United and City, neither of whom is playing at 3pm on Saturday, are able to attend at a reduced price of just Â£5.\n\nAltrincham FC Ladies will also support the campaign at their important Cheshire County Cup Quarter Final tie against Crewe Alexandra on Sunday while at the end of February, the club and the FvH will convene special workshops for Alty's young teams and local schoolchildren.\n\nTyms says LGBT inclusion is still rarely discussed in non-league football circles, although there has been wider interest in the story of Liam Davis, who became the first openly gay male footballer to play at Wembley when he turned out for Cleethorpes Town in last year's Buildbase FA Vase final. Davis has since featured in a video for UEFA's #EqualGame campaign.\n\n'I don't think it's on the radar for most non-league clubs. It seems to be just ourselves and Cleethorpes at the moment. We're now hoping to get back into the National League North and share our own experiences with others. There's no reason why any other club couldn't do what we do.'\n\nThere is equal focus on other elements of the D&I picture at Altrincham, with Tyms grateful to various partners, organisations and local businesses for their generous contributions.\n\n'We wanted a new disabled shelter, and a company came and erected that for us free of charge,' he says. 'The board and the manager have been so supportive and full of ideas, and we have a designated director for D&I matters.\n\n'In September, a vice-chair of the local Muslim Association was attacked on his way to evening prayers, a crime that attracted national attention. He accepted an invitation to our \"Fans for Diversity\" match in October, and from that we've forged a relationship to support the association's local boys' team with equipment and a summer tournament, with money from the FFD fund.'\n\n'It's been one of several success stories from the D&I work we've done'\".\n\nLADIES LEND THEIR SUPPORT\n\nPictured above, courtesy of manager Keith Edleston, are the Altrincham FC Ladies, with fitness coach John McManus, displaying the \"Football v Homophobia\" shirt that was brought down to their training session on Thursday night. Keith adds that \"Everyone involved in the Ladies' section backs this initiative to the hilt\".\n\nThe Ladies are in action at Mersey Valley on Sunday (1.30pm) when they entertain Crewe Alexandra in the quarter-final of the Cheshire County Cup. All spectators are very welcome.\n\nEVO-STIK PREMIER NEWS\n\nAt Shaw Lane, \"Manager Paul Quinn has made several off-field appointments in recent weeks in what he has described as 'positive steps forward' for the football club.\n\nThe new management/coaching structure has included appointing a Head of Football Operations, Head Scout and an analysis team in an effort to support the short and long term aims of Shaw Lane.\n\nLongstanding club official Doug OâConnor has taken on the role of Head of Club Operations. The role will see OâConnor lead on match day logistics and also link directly with new Head Scout Mark Duffy in terms of player identification. Duffy joined the club at the start of the year and the former Bolton Wanderers scout has already been tasked with opposition and individual scouting.\n\nQuinn commented, 'Mark has made a real impact at the club already... This appointment not only helps us with information gathering on opponents, but also identifying talented players at all levels... This is a big job for just one person so Doug OâConnor will also assist Mark with this role and be the direct link between the Chairman and coaching staff.'\n\nLuke Couchman and Liam Harrison have also joined the club to oversee the player analysis aspect of the game. Couchman, formerly of Silsden FC, will work directly on video analysis of games. Harrison, who formerly held a role at Brighouse Town FC, will lead on the use of Playertek, which uses GPS to track player movement on the pitch.\n\nQuinn said, 'We are always looking for ways in which we can improve what we do and improve the support we give to the players'... The manager is also in the search for a new Assistant Manager, following the departure of John Reed to Gainsborough Trinity earlier this week.\"\n\nShaw Lane also lost their manager earlier this season when he moved to Grimsby Town and the Grimsby Telegraph reports that \"Grimsby Town have been urged to shun the managerial merry-go-round and take a chance on a modern-thinking coach with fresh ideas... following the sacking of Russell Slade... Some believe Town should ignore the usual tired old names, and bosses on their way down, in favour of someone from the new breed.\n\nOne of the voices calling for that approach is Cleethorpes Town boss Marcus Newell... Newell believes Town could do a lot worse than take a close look at Boston United manager Craig Elliott, who has emerged as the bookiesâ favourite. Before taking over the Pilgrims' hotseat, Elliott was in charge at Barnsley-area side Shaw Lane, who enjoyed a meteoric rise up the non-league pyramid under his guidance...\n\n'Craig knows how to build and pick a team which is the hardest thing in football', said Newell. 'Some can do it and some clearly canât. The level wonât be a problem as heâs adapted as heâs come through the leagues... When I came up against him you always knew it would be an attacking game played in the right spirit. Town can always pick up a manager off the merry-go-round, or they can take a gamble on a lad who is fresh and knows how to win from the lower leagues!'...\n\nElliott guided Shaw Lane to three promotions in four seasons, before joining Boston United. He is currently presiding over an upturn in fortunes for the Pilgrims in National League North.\"\n\nNORTHERN NEWS\n\nAn \"Official Statement: Proposed Club Re-Structure\" has been issued by Bradford Park Avenue which says, \"At the AGM of Bradford Park Avenue Community Benefit Society on Thursday, it was announced that the directors are proposing a change in the ownership structure of the club.\n\nThe clubâs first team currently plays in National League North, just two divisions below the Football League. The cost of surviving at this level has escalated to a level which the club cannot afford beyond the short term, under its current ownership structure. Operational costs are eating up capital which had been earmarked for off-the-field development, and new investment is needed.\n\nTwo years ago the club became a Community Benefit Society (a âCBSâ), intending that its ownership should be spread amongst the local and regional community. However, very few new members have joined. As a CBS, the club is entitled to issue Community Shares to potential investors, but the law provides for a maximum of Â£100,000 in community shares for any individual, which is not enough to make a crucial difference. In addition the CBS is heavily indebted to its current benefactor, and as an investment opportunity the club in its current form is unattractive.\n\nThe directors have decided to face reality, and they propose to change the structure of the club so that it becomes a privately owned enterprise, from which investors can potentially earn dividends or at least look to recover their investment at some point in time.\n\nAny change in structure is subject to the approval of the current members of the CBS, the FA and also to the approval of the Financial Conduct Authority, whose advice has already been sought. A further meeting of members will be held in the near future at which specific proposals will be put forward\".\n\n16 February 2018\n\nLOOKING GOOD\n\nThe pitch at the J Davidson Stadium is looking good on the eve of Saturday's match against Sutton Coldfield, thanks to the hard work of groundsman Neil Brown, as well as Bryan Ford and other volunteers who have worked on it.\n\nSILVER LINING FOR PHIL\n\nThe Sale & Altrincham Messenger reports that \"Phil Parkinson suffered more fixture frustration at the hands of the weather on Tuesday night, but the rain clouds at least had a silver lining for the Altrincham manager as his injury worries continued to ease...\n\nDisappointed though he was at the inevitable outcome of a lunchtime pitch inspection, Parkinson could at least reflect on the extra recovery time for key defenders Tom Hannigan and James Jones, who should both be fit for Saturday's home game against Sutton Coldfield Town. Hannigan has not featured since the 1-0 win at Farsley Celtic on January 6, while Jones was withdrawn with a slight hamstring twinge in the second half against Ashton United last week.\n\n'The weather is certainly having a big impact at the moment,' said Alty boss Parkinson. 'We've only managed one of the last four Saturday games, after the Buxton match was called off, and now we've lost Tuesday's game with Shaw Lane, which is a big disappointment for everyone. We were really hoping it would go ahead, but, equally, it was important the right decision was made, as neither club wanted it on a pitch that was not really playable. We were hopeful James would have been available and Tom might have been as well.\n\n'Also, Josh Amis (right) came through Saturdayâs reserve game okay and could have been on the bench. Clearly these lads now have a few extra days before we play again'...\n\nMINUTE'S APPLAUSE\n\nThere will be a minute's applause before kick-off against Sutton Coldfield on Saturday in the memory of David Cameron, the 32 year-old Altrincham supporter whose sudden death was reported earlier this week.\n\nLADIES' CUP MATCH\n\nThis Sunday, Altrincham FC Ladies are at home in the Cheshire County Cup, a competition in which they have reached the quarter-final. They entertain Crewe Alexandra Ladies at Mersey Valley, Banky Lane, Sale on Sunday with kick-off at 1.30pm. Spectators are very welcome; the clubhouse will be open as usual.\n\nOPPONENTS STRENGTHEN\n\nAltrincham's opponents on Saturday, Sutton Coldfield, have acquired two new loanees, reports NL Pitchero. \"Neil Tooth, manager of Sutton Coldfield Town, has completed the loan signings of two players from neighbours Tamworth to boost his squad for the final phase of the season.\n\nRegan Upton and Dexter Walters will train with the team... before making the trip to table-toppers Altrincham on Saturday. Upton is a highly-rated 21-year-old defender who joined The Lambs from Wolverhampton Wanderers at the start of the current season. Walters joined Tamworth from Sutton's current groundsharers Romulus and is an exciting 19-year-old forward who will give Tooth options in the wide areas with his pace and energy.\"\n\nDIVERSITY AT ALTY\n\nSky Sports reports that \"Altrincham FC [is] championing diversity and inclusion in non-league football... They're top of the table, with the league's most potent attack and the tightest defence, Altrincham FC's Northern Premier League season could hardly be going better, with a third of the Premier Division campaign left to play...\n\nIt's also an important fixture for the club's compact but influential Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) team, who are gaining renown in non-League football for going the extra mile to ensure everyone feels welcome at Altrincham. This weekend's fixture will be dedicated to the Football v Homophobia campaign, which is currently in its annual February activation, and is part of a series of steps undertaken by Alty to reach out to different parts of the community in and around south-west Manchester\".\n\nAltrincham FC caterer Richie Bentley adds that, for this match, a pint of Fosters or Wainwrights and a bacon or sausage butty will be available for Â£5 from 12.30 to 1.30pm with entry to the J Davidson Stadium being via turnstile 8.\n\nRAIL STRIKE AND SHAW LANE GAME\n\nAltrincham FC supporters travelling by train are advised that the RMT trade union is holding a strike on Northern Rail on Saturday 3 March when Altrincham are away at Shaw Lane AFC. For more on this, see the Sheffield Star.\n\nDetails of TASC supporters' coach transport to the game will be published in due course.\n\nSPURS' SPORTING DINNER UPDATE\n\nThe Sale & Altrincham Messenger reports that \"Altrincham director Neil Faulkner has pulled off a major coup for the club after securing the services of World Cup winner Ossie Ardiles and his former Tottenham team-mate Micky Hazard for a sporting dinner at The J.Davidson Stadium...\n\nThe event was originally pencilled in for Friday, March 16, until Sky decided to change Tottenham's home game with Newcastle to that date for live TV coverage. With Ardiles and Hazard both contracted to Tottenham for hospitality work, Alty were forced to alter their plans and reschedule for April 20.\n\nWith King and many of his fellow Alty Cup heroes on the guest list, there has been a scramble to snap up tickets at Â£35 each, and the function looks sure to be a sell-out...\n\nFaulkner said... 'The idea is to fill a table with Alty players from that era, and we will be contacting them, to get as many along as possible. It is fantastic news for the club, a real coup, to have a World Cup winner and another exceptionally-skilful midfielder in Micky Hazard, who won two FA Cups with Tottenham... The original date was a sell-out, but we can't yet confirm the same for April 20 because we're still contacting people about the change. It's possible there may be the odd ticket or two left, so I'd urge anyone interested to check with the club on 0161 928 1045 or by e-mail.\n\nEVO-STIK PREMIER NEWS\n\n\"Itâs been training rather than playing for Matlock Townâs squad as the wet weather put off their visit to Nantwich Town last Saturday and then Tuesday nightâs home meeting with Rushall Olympic\" reports NL Pitchero.\n\n\"It might not have been such a bad thing as far as the Gladiators are concerned for it has given them time to work on the deficiencies which have cost them dear recently in time for this weekendâs home clash with Witton Albion. The last three visiting sides to the DCJ Group Arena have each scored three goals and Albion also hit three against Matlock last November when the sides shared six goals in Cheshire.\n\nJoint bosses Craig Hopkins and Glenn Kirkwood would no doubt have been concentrating on improving Matlockâs defensive game in the hastily arranged training sessions held on Saturday and on Tuesday night.\n\n'All ten outfield players have to play their part in helping out [goalkeeper] Phil Barnes,' said Hopkins. 'Eleven people have to defend properly. When weâve done well in the past weâve had energy and that energy and spark hasnât been there all of the time this season. Our teams have been athletic and played at a tempo and weâve reminded the lads about this.'\n\nWitton currently lie in tenth spot having picked up one more point on their travels than they have gained on home soil. Hopkins admitted... 'Yes, weâre looking at next season, but the important thing is to get things right at the minute. Weâre making enquiries about players with next season in mind when we want to get back to having a young, hungry, athletic team. Weâre concentrating on getting a good result against Witton on Saturday. Theyâre a good side with energy and good players, itâll be a hard game but weâre looking forward to it.\n\n'It was a cracking game up there that could have finished 6-6 when both sides looked threatening. The lads have worked hard in training and in all honesty weâre not a million miles off and weâre bursting to get going on Saturday.'\n\nThe Gladiators languish down in eighteenth position but with the reorganisation the non-League system taking place in the summer, they are comfortably clear of the one relegation spot this season. But Hopkins says the league position is a cause for concern, 'The league position weâve been in has been a concern all year and we canât say weâre better than we are. We have thirty-eight points from thirty-two games because itâs what weâve deserved and weâve all got to work hard to improve on that'.\n\nA fresh face is likely to be added to the squad before the weekend. Matlock have one or two injury and illness doubts as players will be assessed again at tonightâs training session.\"\n\nNORTHERN NEWS\n\nNL Pitchero reports that \"Guiseley AFC have confirmed that manager Paul Cox and his assistants Adam Murray and Ben Marvin have left the club with immediate effect. Experienced former Republic of Ireland international Sean St Ledger will oversee training until a suitable replacement is found\". 15 February 2018 Altrincham's four outstanding postponed fixtures have now been allocated new dates, as follow....\n\nMONDAY 5TH MARCH Stourbridge v Altrincham, formerly 20/01\n\nSATURDAY 10TH MARCH Altrincham v Mickleover Sports, formerly 3/02\n\nTUESDAY 27TH MARCH Altrincham v Shaw Lane, formerly 13/02\n\nTUESDAY 17TH APRIL Buxton v Altrincham, formerly 10/02\n\nPress release:\n\n\"Altrincham FC has dedicated this weekendâs league fixture to Football vs Homophobia's month of action.\n\nThe game against Sutton Coldfield will highlight the clubâs commitment to be inclusive, welcoming and providing a safe environment for all. The occasion also provides an opportunity to encourage local United and City fans to once again come along, enjoy the football and support the day. Admission is Â£5 with a valid MUFC / MCFC season ticket or membership card.\n\nHuddersfield Town v Manchester United (FA Cup 5th Round) will be shown on the big screen in the Community Sports Hall following the Alty v Sutton Coldfield game. Speaking about the initiative, chairman Grahame Rowley said 'âWeâre delighted to support this great campaign. Weâre always keen to promote a \"football for all\" message which we believe is highlighted in our community work as well as on matchday'.\n\nJordan Tyms, Inclusion and Diversity Co-ordinator for Altrincham FC, added, 'It's great that the club is supporting FvH, one of many projects we have planned as part of our ongoing commitment to inclusion and ensuring football is accessible to all.'\"\n\nAltrincham FC caterer Richie Bentley adds that, for this match, a pint of Fosters or Wainwrights and a bacon or sausage butty will be available for Â£5 from 12.30 to 1.30pm with entry to the J Davidson Stadium being via turnstile 8.\n\nNEXT OPPONENTS: SUTTON COLDFIELD TOWN\n\nAltrincham entertain Sutton Coldfield on Saturday, as The Royals make their first visit to the J. Davidson Stadium in their 139-year history. As Sutton Coldfield Town say \"Things have changed a lot since 1879 and even since 2011. At the end of 2010 the then Assistant Manager Neil Tooth asked if the Club could use its Rotary connections to find somewhere they could train throughout the season. The Board undertook a survey and it was agreed with funding from within the Club to spend Â£400,000 on a 3G artificial pitch as the main stadium pitch. At that time ( and it still is) this was a massive project for a Club at that level.\n\nThe ground was levelled and a very efficient drainage system installed before the 3G carpet was placed on top. All of this was done in record time from early May when the season ended and work commenced, to mid July when it was completed, in time for pre season friendlies. The 3G pitch has completely changed the fortunes of the Club. On the playing side, no matches are ever postponed due to bad weather and the level pitch ensures good passing football can be played (by both sides).\n\nOn the commercial side, the pitch is hired out to other teams... The income generated is used to maintain the pitch (including money put aside for a fund to replace the pitch after 10 years approximately), staff the operation and put money into the Club to financially support the 1st team budget\".\n\nFollowing their one-point deduction this week, the Royals stated that they had \"been charged with a breach of FA Rule C1 (g) (x) in relation to loan player Matt Waters. The player participated in 2 fixtures when on loan from Chester FC when the loan paperwork had not been received by the FA and thus making him ineligible to play.\n\nThe 2 matches were:-\n\nv Nantwich (A) D 0-0\n\nv Ashton (A) L 2-0\n\nAs a result (and following an NPL hearing, in which we were given an opportunity to explain what had happened ), Sutton Coldfield Town FC have been found guilty of a breach of NPL Rule 6.9 â playing an ineligible player. Consequently a fine of Â£100 has been imposed and the deduction of the point earned in the draw at Nantwich made. The Club has decided to accept this ruling and will not appeal against this decision.\n\nIn a season where it has proved difficult to gain points, this is obviously a blow to our chances of avoiding relegation and has arisen simply because the correct paperwork was not received at the FA although it was received by the NPL and Chester FC at this time. However we are bound by the rules and must move on\".\n\nThe point deduction leaves Sutton Coldfield bottom of the EvoStik Premier but level on points with Halesowen Town. However, The Royals have been in good form recently, having picked up seven points from their last four games in which their only defeat was to Warrington Town.\n\nA novel and enjoyable feature of Alty's visit to Coles Lane was the performance of the home club's band, pictured above behind Tony Thompson's goal.\n\nIn the reverse fixture with Altrincham, at Coles Lane on 18 November, three early goals put Altrincham in a strong position and they went on to complete a 4-0 victory. But Alty will be aware that they will be facing much changed oposition, as only four of the sixteen players in the Royals' squad in the November game were also in the more recent squad against Warrington.\n\nTASC SUPPORTERS' TRAVEL UPDATE\n\nThe Altrincham Supporters' Club (TASC) travel coordinator, Mark Eckersall, advises fans, as follows...\n\n\"The weather continues to play havoc with away travel plans after the wasted trip to Stourbridge and postponement of the game at Buxton. We had our largest turnout of the season booked on for Saturday so it was very frustrating not to be able to be part of what would have been a large number of Robins up in the Peak District.\n\nJust a heads-up that, due to its close proximity, it will not be possible to provide transport to the next scheduled away game at Ashton United on Saturday, 24th February. With a journey time of 30 minutes door to door and a distance of just 18 miles, we expect another good following there.\n\nTravel will be arranged for the Shaw Lane fixture on Saturday, 3rd March, so keep an eye on the website for details nearer the time.\"\n\nSHAW LANE ASSISTANT JOINS LEE\n\nAltrincham were set to play Shaw Lane on Tuesday night, until the match was postponed, and also on Tuesday we heard that former Alty boss Lee Sinnott had been appointed manager of Gainsborough Trinity. And now the two stories have come together as NL Pitchero confirms that \"The experienced John Reed has left Shaw Lane AFC as assistant-manager to team up with new boss Lee Sinnott at Gainsborough Trinity.\n\nAs manager of Harrogate Town Reed won promotion from the Evo-Stik Northern Premier First Division in 2002 and won the West Riding County Cup in successive seasons before taking on the manager role at Stalybridge Celtic. After taking over part way through the 2005/06 season with Celtic eighteen points adrift, Reed oversaw a 'great escape'. The following seasons Stalybridge missed out on the play-off places on the final day of the season.\n\nLater, at Buxton, Reed lead his team to win the Derbyshire Senior Cup. During six seasons there he also missed out on promotion from the NPL Premier Division, losing to Gateshead in the play-off final. Reed became assistant-manager at Scarborough before taking the reins at Ossett Town in 2014, replacing Craig Elliott, who left to join Shaw Lane.\n\nReed stayed on to assist Paul Quinn after Elliott departed for Boston United late last year. Head of football operations Doug OâConnor told the club`s official Pitchero website, 'Weâre sorry to see Reedy go. Heâs had three fantastic years with us and we wish him all the best at Gainsborough Trinity in their bid to save themselves from relegation from the National League North'.\n\nOn departing, Reed thanked everyone at Shaw Lane, 'Itâs been a tremendous three years at the club. There are so many nice people'\".\n\nEVO-STIK PREMIER NEWS\n\nCantilever Catchup reports that, on Tuesday, \"Warrington suffered a frustrating 1-0 defeat at the hands of Stalybridge Celtic who record[ed] their first win away from home since April 2017. A mistake from Tony McMillan, when he was under pressure from Matthew Wolfenden after a cross, gave the visitors the lead with fifteen minutes to go and the Yellows' new boy, Joe Piggott missed from the penalty spot to draw level in the 84th minute.\n\nPaul Cardenâs side looked to utilise the pace of their forwards early on by putting balls in behind Celtic's defence and, while they were unable to create anything significant, the home side were in the ascendancy... After the break, Stalybridge looked to trouble Warrington by getting the ball up to Liam Dickinson but, despite the tall striker causing problems, there was little in the way of chances for the side.\n\nThe Yellows faithful attempted to lift their team who hadnât reached the high standard of performance they have set for themselves over the course of the season so far... Carden made a double substitution in a bid to find a way through the stubborn defence of the visitors. McDonald and Hayhurst made way for Gerard Kinsella and Stephen Milne respectively but the deadlock remained...\n\nAgainst the run of play the away side took the lead after McMillan suffered the misfortune of scoring an own-goal. The ball was played into the box and the Warrington keeper punched the ball under pressure from opposition forward Wolfenden. The ball looped up and trickled into the net with the referee deciding that there was no foul on the man between the sticks.\n\nThe Yellows increased the intensity and were awarded a penalty with five minutes remaining. Stalybridge manager Liam Walton [?Steve Burr] was furious with the decision but Piggott was unable to convert the spot kick, rounding off what was a very disappointing evening for the promotion contenders... Cardenâs men still sit in fourth position and will be confident of putting the performance behind them as they focus on cementing a place in the play-offs\".\n\n14 February 2018\n\nSEAN GOES ON LOAN AGAIN\n\nSean Miller (right) has gone to our neighbours, Trafford, on a one-month loan. This follows a loan at Colne earlier this season as Sean regains full match fitness after his long injury lay-off. So far this season Sean has made 3(+10) appearances from the bench for Altrincham, with all of his three starts being in cup competitions.\n\nNEXT GAME\n\nAfter the second postponement in a week for Altrincham, the Robins' next game is at home to Sutton Coldfield Town on Saturday (3pm).\n\nOn Saturday, 17 February, when Sutton Coldfield visit the J. Davidson Stadium for an Evo-Stik Premier league match, the game will be Altrincham FC's 'Football v Homophobia' designated match.\n\nAdmission to the game for holders of valid Manchester City or Manchester United season tickets will be just Â£5.\n\nAltrincham FC caterer Richie Bentley adds that, for this match, a pint of Fosters or Wainwrights and a bacon or sausage butty will be available for Â£5 from 12.30 to 1.30pm with entry to the J Davidson Stadium being via turnstile 5 or 6 on Moss Lane.\n\nSHAW LANE DEDUCTED THREE POINTS\n\n\"Shaw Lane have been deducted three points by the EVO-STIK League for playing an ineligible player. The club accepted a charge of breaching League Rule 6.9 after being found guilty at a disciplinary hearing of fielding a player while subject to an Football Association disciplinary suspension. The FA had previously found the club to be in breach of FA Rule E10 in this respect.\n\nClub officials informed the EVO-STIK League on Monday 12 February that they were waiving the right to appeal and would accept the sanction. No costs were awarded and in addition to deducting the three points gained while fielding the player, the club was also fined Â£100 in accordance with the recommended minimum tariff after submitting a mitigating written statement to the panel.\n\nThe EVO-STIK League Premier Division table will be updated at 5pm on Tuesday 13 February 2018 to reflect the sanction and there will be no further statement from the Northern Premier League on this matter\".\n\nAs reported here on 22 January \"The Barnsley Chronicle reports that Shaw Lane face a fine and possible points deduction for fielding James Pollard in December against Warrington Town, a match which the Ducks won 5-0. The former Farsley player allegedly should have been serving a suspension at the time\".\n\nHalesowen Town and Sutton Coldfield have also had points deducted, four for the Yeltz and one for Sutton Coldfield. For Halesowen the offence was \"breaching League Rule 6.9... for playing Kalern Thomas while he was registered under written contract with Solihull Moors. The Football Association had previously found the club to be in breach of FA Rules E1(b) and C1(i)(i)\". The club is deducted \"the points gained in the three matches\" in which he played at the time.\n\nFor the Royals, the offence was \"failing to get approval for a loan player from the FA in accordance with the requirements of League Rule 6.4.1. and subsequently fielding him in two fixtures\".\n\nTUESDAY SCORES\n\nTuesday 13 February 2018\n\nAltrincham P-P Shaw Lane\n\nLancaster City 0-3 Ashton United (att. 167)\n\nMatlock Town P-P Rushall Olympic\n\nWarrington Town 0-1 Stalybridge Celtic (att. 227)\n\nLeicestershire Challenge Cup 17-18 - Semi-Final\n\nCoalville Town 3-2 Barwell\n\nBirmingham Senior Cup 17-18 - Quarter Final\n\nHednesford Town 4-1 Burton Albion\n\nLiverpool County FA Senior Cup 17-18 - Semi-Final\n\nMarine 2-1 Widnes\n\nLEE SINNOTT BACK IN MANGEMENT\n\nNL Pitchero reports that \"Gainsborough Trinity have announced the appointment of Lee Sinnott as their new manager following a successful round of interviews. Sinnott replaces Dave Frecklington, who was sacked last week with Trinity currently third-bottom of the table.\n\nSinnott was a vastly experienced player with over 500 Football League appearances with the likes of Walsall, Watford, Bradford City, Crystal Palace, Bradford City and Huddersfield Town and has since had over fifteen years in management with the likes of Farsley Celtic, Port Vale, Bradford Park Avenue and Altrincham,\n\nThe 52-year-old will oversee training this evening and admitted: âGainsborough has always had a great deal of potential when I have visited with other clubs, but the hard work starts now, and I canât wait to turn that potential into reality.â\n\nLee left Altrincham in early March, 2016 and all at the Club wish him well in his new role.\n\nGainsborough Trinity reported \"Lee Sinnott has today agreed to become the manager of Gainsborough Trinity Football Club after an exciting round of interviews at the Martin & Co Arena. The new man at the helm declared, 'I can't wait to get started! I'm really looking forward to it. Things came about really quickly, I met the Chairman and three board members on Monday afternoon and recieved the phone call last night'.\n\nLee continued, 'I'm absolutely delighted to be at Gainsborough Trinity. It's a good project, it will be a challenge, but it's something to look forward to!' Of the task in hand Sinnott pointed out, 'There are a lot of clubs around us in the mix, but we know what's required. I've looked at the stats, I've seen what we have here and what is needed. Gainsborough has always had a great deal of potential when I have visited with other clubs, but the hard work starts now and I can't wait to turn that potential into reality'...\n\nA short tenure at Bradford Park Avenue was followed by a largely successful period at Altrincham, where he spent five years, first stabilising the club after relegation from the Conference, before reaching the play-offs in each of the next two seasons. In the second of the play-off campaigns, his side overcame Guiseley, after extra time, to return to the Conference, steering the side comfortably to safety in the clubsâ first season.\n\nA period out of the game has seen Sinnott recharge his batteries and come back hungry for success...\n\nChairman, Richard Kane was noticeably delighted to have secured the signing of the experienced professional, stating, 'We had several candidates in mind when we relieved Dave Frecklington of his duties, but we wanted to give people the opportunity to state their cases. As it turns out, Leeâs hunger, desire and professionalism stood out. He had a clear vision of what he wanted to achieve at the football club and we are confident that we are appointing the right man for the job. The fact that Lee is ready to quit his job, solely to focus on the football club is testament to the focus he has, on firstly guiding us to safety and then the onward journey we want to make together'\".\n\nEVO-STIK PREMIER NEWS\n\nShaw Lane have responded to yesterday's news, confirming that they\"have been deducted three points for fielding an ineligible player. The points have been deducted following the debut of James Pollard against Warrington in the crushing 5-0 victory. Pollard should have served a suspension following a two-match ban received whilst still with Farsley Celtic.\n\nThe defender, who scored the winning goal in the 3-1 victory over Coalville last Tuesday, also played one game for Celtic while suspended, which they lost. Pollard has since served the suspension. The club will drop to third; behind Grantham Town on goal difference. The Ducks still have two games in hand on Grantham and one game in hand on Altrincham\".\n\nIn addition to the postponements in our division, all of Tuesday's matches in the Evostik Division One North and South were postponed.\n\nCHESHIRE SENIOR CUP NEWS\n\nStalybridge Celtic report that \"The Cheshire Senior Cup match between Stalybridge Celtic and Stockport County, originally scheduled for Wednesday 21 February, has been postponed. A new date will be announced shortly.\" The reason being that \"Stockport have a rearranged game against Nuneaton on the Tuesday\".\n\nNORTH-WEST NEWS\n\nThe Hallmark Security League tells us that \"1874 Northwich have announced that they will be playing two home league games at Wincham Park, home of Witton Albion, in the coming weeks. The Greens have already played two FA Vase ties at the venue, and have now moved league games against Runcorn Town and Northwich Victoria, in an attempt to address their growing fixture backlog.\n\nA statement said, 'The continued spell of wet weather and successive postponements has meant that the team will have to play a minimum of 31 and up to a maximum of 44 games between now and the end of the season â which is now just 12 weeks away! Your Board are acutely aware of the serious impact that such a congested fixture list is likely to have on both our fantastic playing and management staff, but also our brilliant band of volunteers, without whom we simply could not stage matches.\n\nHence, over the past week or so we have actively been looking at other venues where we might be able to stage some of our home fixtures and at which there is a greater level of certainty that they will be played. Therefore, with the full co-operation and approval of the NWCFL League Management Committee and the blessing of our great friends from Winsford United, we have come to an agreement with Witton Albion FC to switch the following league matches from the St Luke's Barton Stadium to Wincham Park.\n\nSaturday 17 February 2018 v Runcorn Town KO 3.00pm\n\nThursday 1 March 2018 v Northwich Victoria KO 7.45pm\n\n13 February 2018\n\nMATCH OFF\n\nUnfortunately a waterlogged pitch - it has rained steadily this morning on top of the accumulated water - means that tonight's match against Shaw Lane has been postponed.\n\nVERY SAD NEWS\n\nAltrincham FC and its supporters have been stunned to hear of the sudden death of regular supporter David Cameron at the age of just 32.\n\nThe Club extends its condolences to David's family and friends. David was not only a regular spectator at the J. Davidson Stadium but attended many away games as well and he will be greatly missed.\n\nPHIL'S VIEWS\n\nPress & Media Officer Brian Flynn submitted the following views of Alty manager Phil Parkinson, before Tuesday's match was postponed, to Altrincham Today...\n\n\"The weather is certainly having a big impact on non-league football at the moment and Saturdayâs postponement of our scheduled Evo-Stik Premier Division game at Buxton meant that we have only managed to get a game on in 1 of the last 4 Saturdays.\n\nWe are really hoping that tonightâs big top of the table clash against Shaw Lane at the J.Davidson Stadium goes ahead. There is a pitch inspection at lunchtime and hopefully the outcome of that will be positive.\n\nWhilst this game is 1st v 2nd and a very important game for both teams, itâs not a title decider; we still have to meet Shaw Lane at their place on the first Saturday in March and we still have 51 points to play for between now and the last Saturday in April.\n\nJames Jones tweaked his hamstring in our last game, a 3-2 home win over Ashton United, a week ago, but we are hopeful that he will be available tonight. He came through a tough session on Saturday and has also been undergoing testing in the clinic.\n\nTom Hannigan may also be available as well and Josh Amis came through Saturdayâs Reserves game OK and could be on the substitutes' bench.\n\nShaw Lane havenât changed much over the last couple of seasons and in Paul Clayton, they have a very dangerous target man, who puts himself about. Clayton was an England âCâ International and is certainly a player who can hurt opposition teams, as can Damian Reeves, who I expect to start tonight against his former club. Reeves did phenomenally well at Alty in his 7 year spell, scoring over 150 goals in more than 300 appearances. Those statistics speak for themselves.\n\nWhilst we are very keen to get the game on, itâs important that the right decision is made, as neither Shaw Lane nor us want the game to take place on a pitch that is not really playable. As of early this morning, the signs are hopeful, as there has not been a harsh overnight frost, nor too much rain this morning, so fingers crossed that we have a game on in front of a good midweek crowd and it would be great to be sitting on 66 points by 10pm tonight\".\n\nMONDAY GAME\n\nMonday 12 February 2018\n\nStourbridge 1-2 Farsley Celtic (att 492)\n\nCHESHIRE SENIOR CUP SAGA\n\nAs Altrincham await the game to decide their opponents in the Cheshire Senior Cup, Warrington Town have issued a statement from Toby Macormac, Chairman & CEO, saying, \"After the postponement of Wednesdayâs [CSC] fixture versus Winsford United, many people not even connected with the game in question chose to make accusations on social media that not only questioned the integrity of our club but me personally.\n\nDue to our fixture backlog I personally selected the fixture date knowing full well we had a game only 24 hours before, that may also have been an FA Trophy replay, so a guaranteed fixture either way. I selected this date as I knew I would have no issue in raising a team with access to two academy teams and players dual-registered at other clubs and this date suited Winsford United as others that were offered, after numerous postponements, did not so we tried to assist there, knowing that they ground share with another club.\n\nThe day before the fixture we were informed by Winsford that the condition of the surface was unplayable in one area only and [was] extremely unlikely to go ahead to the point I offered a reschedule of the fixture at Warrington Town to ensure the game finally went ahead which was duly accepted as a way forward by Winsford if it was required.\n\nThe day of fixture our club secretary called Winsford and was told there was no possibility of the fixture going ahead and the inspection planned at 4pm will [sic] be a formality. At this point players and also parents were contacted, as some academy players do not drive, to inform them that their services were not required and the likely replay date would be the 26th February at Warrington which comes the day before a 3pm departure to Grantham Town so in effect nothing really changed from Matlock scenario.\n\nJust after 4pm our secretary again rang Winsford to check on the formality of the inspection to be told the pitch has been passed which, after two days of stating \"itâs no chance of being played\" came as a shock, to say the least, and after some deliberation by myself I deemed it impossible to gather everyone back together so informed Winsford we could not fulfil the fixture due to unforeseen circumstances which was the correspondence exchanged over the 48 hour period and, in no way, was a refusal to send a team made [sic], it was around the correspondence and timescale\n\nPeople will be demanding to know as to why the fixture has been re-scheduled to Warrington Town on the 26th with no further action taken against either club and this is quite simple in the fact that Winsford United informed us the match was postponed so the formality of the match officials' attendance went the wrong way and he passed it fit. I personally believe the learning from this is that the rules of the competition are adhered to where only a match official can postpone a fixture and not the clubs.\n\nItâs my own personal view that Winsford United and Warrington Town actually tried to work together to get this fixture played, which is highlighted by agreeing a switch to our ground which, with our fixture pile up like Winsford (with [Northwich] 1874) is the last thing we need. I hope this clears the matter up and both clubs can get back to business and social media users can find it within themselves to now take a different view compared to Wednesday evening and within that I can fully understand people['s] frustrations, as I was also, but it was not the right time for me to comment\".\n\nEVO-STIK PREMIER NEWS\n\nThe visitors to the J. Davidson Stadium on Saturday are Sutton Coldfield who report that \"Sutton looked forward to continuing their revival and their fight for survival under new manager Neil Tooth when they entertained high flying Warrington Town at Coles Lane. Their two emphatic victories and a hard-earned draw in their last three games had begun to restore their confidence and football relies so much on confidence. But they were under no illusions that Warrington would be a stern test...\n\nThe opening 20 minutes were evenly matched... Right on half time Warrington broke from a Sutton corner and Tony Gray cut in and left the keeper with no chance.\n\nThe second half continued to be a hard fought contest with chances at both ends but it was Warrington who increased their lead when a well taken corner reached the far post and Jack Higgins headed home. Sutton went straight on the attack and James Beresford headed a Sutton corner just over the bar. Sutton worked hard in the last ten minutes but could not break down a resolute Warrington defence...\n\nAlthough Sutton lost, it was against a very good team and they battled to the end. This sought [sort] of form will be rewarded as the season reaches the crucial stages.... Man of the Match James Beresford\".\n\n12 February 2018\n\nNEXT FIXTURE: SHAW LANE\n\nAltrincham's next fixture is on Tuesday night when Shaw Lane AFC are the visitors. Kick off"
