Tastes with regards to alcohol consumption were, through association with liquors like Absinthe, essentially observed to have been sweet.\n\nFIRST MILLENIUM\n\nAlcohol consumption conducive to the ritual madness of Bacchanalia in ancient Rome, an instance in which ‘Vindolanda’ in Northumberland quite possibly perceived beer to harbor an ecological potential long before cities like London did.\n\nTWELFTH TO FIFTEENTH CENTURIES\n\nAlcohol associated with the escapist Pilgrim cults of Thomas a Becket as a suicide drug that may yet survive misgiving. Hops, (a relative of the Cannabis plant), introduced in efforts to sterilise beer, a pretense beneath which, it’s narcotic properties were also very possibly valued raw. The consumption of alcohol in trifles and syllabubs would continue to indicate a preference for sweetness with regards to other dietary supplements, an instance in which the fermentation of Sweet Wort in Mortlake during the fourteenth century would have been soft rather than alcoholic and refined as Rum for inclusion in deserts rather than consumed neat.\n\nSIXTEENTH CENTURY\n\nDrinking considered foolhardy through association with violence, the brewing of strong beer being considered irresponsible, an instance in which Alcohol was generally used as a culinary aid rather than a recreational pleasure although, as was the case during the medieval era and the pilgrim cults to which it ascribed, exceptionally sweet liquors were deemed palatable through conjunction with narcotics usage.\n\nSEVENTEENTH CENTURY\n\nBrewing largely abandoned in London due to the incident of plague although Gin was, in being a sterile distillate, observed to become popular through association with hygiene in about 1680, an instance in which the spirit’s flavor was distinctly astringent and not sweet.\n\nEIGHTEENTH CENTURY\n\nAlcohol re-popularised as healthy, entire or medically significant by such people as Doctor Samuel Johnson who would, owing to the acceptability of Gin have theoretically been blessed with a substantial reservoir of beer intended for the purposes of spirit distillation at the time, a popularity which was ultimately observed to result in an amount of government legislation that effectively served to monopolise alcohol’s production in a general sense.\n\nNINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nLegal prohibitions and temperance movements attempted to ban brewing through association with the disobedience and rowdiness which it was observed to cause, a dichotomy which, in many instances, was, by way of controversy, contrarily observed to popularise it’s consumption.\n\nTWENTIETH CENTURY\n\nAlcohol consumption widely accepted in commercial terms and the brewing industry was noted to witness steady growth through association with British Rail and the National grid.\n\n____________________\n\n3… EARLY REFERENCES\n\n____________________\n\nPertaining to a plethora of commonly sustained domestic conventions which extend backwards through time for countless generations, the true origin of brewing in human culture is practically impossible to estimate, the tradition being inextricably bound to virtually every aspect of man’s civilization since the dawn of history, the theme being so commonplace that, in many instances, it’s occurrence transpires unannounced, a ghost which, in almost circumstantially disguising it’s identity, is fated to stare silently back across the void, mocking all subsequent attempts to penetrate it’s mystery.\n\nResultantly research devoted to the topic of assessing and validating the earliest evidence of human beer production is limited to the written and pictographic proofs represented by fragments of recorded documentation that have, through some fluke of circumstance, been preserved for posterity.\n\nWith regards to this issue, although wine was reputed to have been fermented in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia five thousand years before Christ, an epoch which would have represented a fine opportunity for it to enter into Russian (or Colchian) culture long before records began, there is little more, beyond token references to the drug’s medicinal application during the ancient Greek era, than the implication of such practise to be found within the tome of current history, a deficit through which the modern chronology of event, as it presently appears is observed to begin some years later with the civilizations of North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nWith respect to these later conventions, the ancient Mesopotamians were known to have brewed at least twenty different types of beer approximately 3,000 years before Christ, eight from Emmer wheat, eight from barley and four from a mixture of grains, a selection which, in being demarcated for usage in conjunction with a number of different religious ceremonies, was also observed to have possessed medical properties.\n\n“Sikaru”, a beverage composed of bread made from emmer wheat flavoured with honey and dates was, in this instance, thought to have been used for both ritual and medicinal purposes upon a regular basis in Mesopotamia,\n\nThe Mesopotamians were, in this instance, recorded to have worshipped a brewing divinity named ‘Ninkasi’, a woman, who in being the daughter of the King of ‘Uruk’. was assigned to prepare a variety of beer called “Kash” upon a daily basis, a beverage which in being consumed unfiltered through reeds left floating upon it’s surface, was apparently composed of fermented “bappir” bread flavoured with grapes and honey, a convention which, although unusual, was also observed to have been practised in the fifth century Armenian book the “Xenophon of Anabasis”, indicating that the trend remained popular for many thousands of years.\n\nIn being approximately 3,800 years of age the Mesopotamian “Hymn to Ninkasi” is potentially the oldest recorded beer recipe in existence, a tract from which it remains possible to deduce that, in possessing a strength of about two percent alcohol by volume, ancient ale was probably fairly weak and salty, an attribute which would hypothetically serve to distinguish it as a culinary aid rather than a recreational narcotic although straws were, interestingly observed to be used to drink many different types of beverage proving that the ancient world was not entirely averse to recreational experimentation..\n\nThe assertion that such beverages were unfiltered goes some way towards explaining why straws were used in their consumption, an instance in which both the Sumerians and Babylonians were renowned for being amongst the first users of the drinking straw, a utensil which, in initially being composed of little more than a hollow reed, evolved into a selection of fluted instruments crafted from bronze and even gold.\n\nThe “Tepe Garwa” a phenomenally old stamp seal of Mesopotamian extraction indicates that the practise of drinking through straws may have extended back for more than six thousand years, it’s detail depicting two figures casually engaged in straw usage around an open vat of uncertain content.\n\nSomewhat more recently, “Lady Pu”, a woman who was recorded to have reigned over the ancient city of Ur two thousand years before Christ, was, similarly depicted drinking through a straw upon a number of stone tablets, a pastime confirmed by the observation that she was also buried with an ornate straw crafted from gold and lapis lazuli placed beside her.\n\nThere are, in this instance, a number of Babylonian artefacts which confirm the wide-scale usage of straws, representations of Babylonian kings employing elongated straws to supply them with drink from concealed reservoirs connected to their throne rooms, a term beneath which such instruments were often wrought into unusual shapes rather like modern children’s straws.\n\nThe Babylonians were, with respect to what it is that they chose to drink, similarly renowned for plying men with as much beer (or mead) as they desired during the first months of their betrothal, a practise from which the term “Honeymoon” is potentially derived.\n\nBeer was also thought to have been rationed during the reign of the middle Eastern ruler Hammurabi, a term beneath which workers were recorded to have been allotted two litres of ale a day, a measure compared unfavorably to the allowance of civil servants and high priests who were respectively permitted three and five litres of ale upon a daily basis, a convention which, in potentially representing a perverse reflection upon varying degrees of social responsibility, was presumably also carried forth to encompass many other commercial articles.\n\nAlthough references to Babylonian and Mesopotamian brewing are rare, there is a surprising account of inebriation in the ancient middle Eastern text, “The Epic of Gilgamesh”, an episode in which the hero’s ape like companion “Enkidu” is actually observed to experience euphoria after having consumed beer.\n\nIt remains uncertain as to what attitudes towards beer were throughout these periods, it being supposed that such beverages were primarily developed to capitalize upon their nutritional content, although the intoxicative effect of fermented alcohol was almost certainly also appreciated at a fairly early date, the general assumption being that it was frequently considered unsafe to drink untreated water, states of dilution and containment representing a primitive form of sterilization, although The lion headed Egyptian divinity “Sekhmet” was, during ancient times, perversely recorded to have been plied with alcohol to reduce his craving for slaughter, a convention which, in being observed to have been practised for much the same reason in medieval English taverns, would suppose that alcohol was, upon occasion, also employed as a sedative.\n\nBeyond the usage of distilled spirit as either a preservative or a perfume, a convention which, in being of a cosmetic persuasion, can be traced back to the second millennium before Christ, potentially the first recorded usage of alcohol as a comestible resource pertains to a beverage known as “Wormwood”, a sweet liquor fortified with roots and herbs which, historical misinterpretation aside, possibly once resembled modern ‘Absinthe’.\n\nThe secret of ‘Absinth’s’ phenomenal anciency was, in this in this instance perceived to lie in the observation that it’s physical constitution is essentially a corrupted sugar, a mild acetate which, in retaining a commercially assailable apparel, is coincidentally noted to possess a subtle flavour unique to itself, a vaguely astringent pang that, in categorical terms, actually owes it’s origins to the fermentation of free alcohols within it’s chemical composition .\n\nThis flavour was, with regards to the historical premium which the drink was observed to set for itself, effectively noted to have been favoured by the Visigoth’s during the first years of the Akkadian empire on earth in the second millennium before Christ, a term beneath which it was, at this date, in fact believed to have been imported from a yet earlier epoch in the empire’s history, a period which could, within reason, potentially have extended back for an even greater time than that which is presently recorded to ascribe to it, being plainly apparent as a dietary supplement in an as yet unwritten chapter of the earth’s pre-history that will probably never be accurately appraised.\n\nThe ‘Ebers’ papyrus of ancient Egypt mentions the brewing of Wormwood wine as early as 1,550 B.C and there is further evidence to suggest that it was prepared in both India and China at approximately the same time, the beverage almost certainly having been imbibed by the ancient Greeks through until the Christian era, a period during which it was known as “Absinthites Oinus”.\n\nExtracted from the ‘Artemisia Absinthum’ plant and flavoured with Fennel, ‘Wormwood Wine’ would, like Absinthe, have both tasted of Aniseed and potentially have contained the psycho-active drug “Terpene Thujune” that is present in the modern drink, a pretense beneath which it’s innate sweetness could well have been considered a desirable dietary attribute.\n\nConventionally consumed with three to five parts cold water filtered through a burning sugar cube placed on a perforated spoon, a process through which the spirit turns white, “Absinthe” was, beneath the name “The Green Fairy”, celebrated amongst artistic circles in Paris throughout the last years of the nineteenth century, a popularity which, in demarcating the hour of 5 o’clock as “L’heure Verte” or “The Green Hour” in certain bars, led the authors ‘Mark Twain’ and ‘Oscar Wilde’ and the artists ‘Toulouse Lautrec’ and ‘Vincent Van Gogh’, to experience the drink, a trend later followed by the occultist ‘Aleister Crowley’, the singer ‘Frank Sinatra’ and even the American president ‘Franklin D. Roosevelt’.\n\nThe subject of a study conducted by the pharmacological researcher “Valentin Magnan” in 1867, Absinthe was temporarily prohibited in Europe and America, a ban which, in being synonymous with the general prohibition of alcohol during the late nineteenth century, was often misinterpreted to pertain solely to the inclusion of Wormwood as an ingredient in liquor through association with it’s peculiar narcotic effects.\n\nSubsequently revived in the form of “Pastis” and “Anis”, “Pernod”, is potentially the most well known brand of Absinthe currently available on the market, a formula which, in being acquired, in 1792 by the Swiss Doctor ‘Peter Ordinaire’, was later distilled upon a large- scale by a man named ‘Major Dubied’ and his son in law ‘Henry Louis Pernod’.\n\nSold in many countries beneath many names, French anisette liquor being known as ‘Brizard’, Spanish Absinthe as ‘Mono’ or ‘Chinchon’, Italian Absinthe as ‘Sambuca’ and Greek Absinthe as ‘Ouzo’, (the beverage to which the liquor’s incredible anciency may perhaps most immediately be ascribed), Absinthe is also vended beneath an equally venerable apparel as “Arak” or “Raki” in Mediterranean countries.\n\nAlthough many recipes for Absinthe currently exist, the modern drink is conventionally prepared by the maceration of a selection of herbs including Florence Fennel, Green Anise, Star Anise, Hyssop, Melissa, Anjelica, Coriander, Veronica and “Grande” or “Petite” Wormwood in a distillate of wine, a process through which the liquor both develops a striking green colour as a result of it’s chlorophyll content and matures well.\n\nAs an artificially sweetened spirit, Absinthe became synonymous with the preparation of liquor throughout early history and frequently occurs alongside drinks such as ‘Benedictine’, ‘Chartreuse’ and ‘Drambuie’ in the canon of commercial alcohols, the formula being adapted in many ways, bottled with flakes of Gold to make “Danzig Goldwasser”, mixed with cream or eggs to respectively make “Bailey’s Irish Cream” or “Advocaat”, coloured, as in the instance of “ Bol’s Curacao”, or even used to fill chocolates, a form in which the drink proved to be particularly popular amongst nineteenth century Parisians.\n\nThe Egyptians were also recorded to have buried their dead with flowers and spices during the pre-Christian era, a practise which almost certainly resulted in the fermentation of wine, fragments of liquorice root being recorded to have been discovered in the burial tomb of the celebrated king Tutankhamun, a gesture that, in testifying some small part of Egyptian understanding, was considered to have represented a blessing which would continue to grace the young king’s soul with human virtue during it’s transition into the after-life.\n\nNaturally such applications were not intended for consumption, however the preservative property of many substances were possibly of significance at a fairly early date, pickling potentially being one of the oldest general uses of alcohol on record.\n\nIndeed the decision to use Absinthe to flavour chocolates stands to reason, many of the earliest references to the drink pertain to it’s usage as a confection, a distinction which it shared throughout early history with the better known delicacy, “liquorice”, an organic sugar extracted from the roots of the “Glycyrrizah Glabra” plant.\n\nFrequently used to freshen breath, clear the throat and flavour both tobacco and snuff, Liquorice was, like Absinthe, occasionally used to sweeten alcohol, being present in the spirits “Calabria” and “Liquiz” and used as a foaming agent in many varieties of Porter, a term beneath which the substance potentially once served as the origin of the word “liquor”.\n\nEstimated to be approximately fifty times sweeter than sugar, true liquorice acts in much the same manner as a concentrate when applied as an ingredient to food, commercial liquorice being dried, frayed, diluted in water and filtered before being mixed with a binder composed of Gum Arabic, starch, flour, molasses, ammonium chloride and bee’s wax, the finished product being heated, pressed and placed in a vacuum for cold storage.\n\nChristened “Glukus Riza” or sweet root by the Roman physician ‘Dioscorides’, liquorice was also recorded to have been consumed to increase stamina amongst the works of the pre-Christian scholar ‘Theoprastus’, a term beneath which the substance was known as “Scythian root”, a preparation favoured by both the Macedonian general “Alexander the Great” and Hannibal’s troops during the Carthaginian invasion of Europe.\n\nUsed extensively throughout the medieval era, notably during the construction of London Bridge, liquorice production was recorded to have been taxed by Edward the First in 1305 the plant also being widely cultivated in England throughout the reign of Elizabeth the First, a process through which the confection found it’s way into many Jacobean apothecaries including those of the celebrated herbalist Nicholas Culpeper.\n\nConsidered synonymous with the less well known African Long Pepper or “Grain of Paradise” as a flavouring for beer during the Tudor era, “liquorice water” or “tea” was recorded to have been widely consumed in Southern Europe throughout the medieval era, a period during which it was, in accordance with the medical wisdom of that time, considered capable of purifying blood.\n\nPerhaps the most resilient testament to such practise in England is that of the Pontefract region in the Yorkshire Dales, a location which in testifying a heritage of liquorice production which dates back to the medieval era, remains renowned for producing the confection to this day.\n\nRecorded to have been introduced into Yorkshire during the fifteenth century by a contingent of Dominican Friars and Cluniac monks returning from the Crusades, liquorice was first observed to have been produced in Pontefract by the ‘Priors of St, John on Monkhill’, an interest which, in being substantially extended during the eighteenth century by a man named George Dunhill, ultimately led to the creation of the Pontefract Cake, a confection which, although frequently imitated, still withstands comparison to many recent examples of such ware.\n\nLiquorice was similarly recorded to have been introduced into America during the sixteenth century by a man named ‘John Bosselyn’, a preparation which, in including elecampane, Aniseed, Sassafras and Fennel amongst it’s list of ingredients was prescribed to Indians as a cure for colds, the root ultimately finding it’s way into popular film culture with a depiction of “Charlie Chaplin” consuming a quantity of the substance convincingly disguised as a pair of bootlaces in the film “Gold Rush”.\n\nEven today Bedouin women are known to sell both Wormwood and Liquorice as remedies for ill health in the markets of Cairo, proof of their continued popularity in the middle East.\n\nWith regards to extensive studies of the medical properties of alcohol, “The Shennong Bencao Jing” of first century China contains lists of herbs and spices within it’s catalogue, evidence to suggest that the Chinese at least were aware of the many pharmacological applications to which beer may be presumed to ascribe at the turn of the first millennium.\n\nBeer residue consisting of Hawthorn berries, grapes, beeswax, honey and rice was discovered in a selection of 9,000 year old pots pots from the Jia Ho region of China and “Jiu Zao”, a cooking sauce made from rice pollinated with artificially cultivated mold was thought to have been consumed in China up to 7,000 years ago, concoctions which, in being the antecedents, of the comparatively modern drinks “Mijoii” and “Sake”, suggests a course of events that pre-date even those of ancient Egypt.\n\nBoth Ginseng and Liquorice were also recorded to have been prepared in the twelve regional medians of ancient China, a term beneath which the confection served as a traditional medicine, being thought capable of “harmonising” or improving the flavour of many recipes.\n\nTraditionally used in conjunction with Soya sauce to flavour pork dumplings and sweeten corrupted meat, liquorice was recorded to have been both consumed beneath the ‘Quing’ dynasty in China and to have been favoured by the celebrated religious leader Buddha, a process through which the confection was ultimately inaugurated into the culinary practises of many ancient Hindu cultures, the root being employed as an aphrodisiac when mixed with milk and sugar.\n\nWith regards to such an issue, many of the earliest references to alcohol in history may be observed to refer to it’s usage as a medicine, an instance in which the employ of beer as an anesthetic can hypothetically be traced back to the celebrated Egyptian doctor, “Imhotep”, a man that, in potentially applying pharmaceuticals to medical treatment four and a half thousand years ago, must stand as one of the most ancient purveyors of the science on record.\n\nHowever due to the anciency and resultant ambiguity of such evidence, the Greek doctor Hippocrates is, in generally being considered the father of modern medicine, also perceived to be the most obvious exponent of alcohol’s usage as a herbal remedy, a man who, in practising surgical science 480 years before Christ almost certainly incorporated pharmaceutical treatment into his methodology, references to the usage of “Valerian”, a pungent yellow plant extract notable for it’s ability to suppress anxiety and cure insomnia being derived from this era.\n\nAlthough the term “Materia Medica”, (surgical refuse), was not used until the era of the Roman doctor ‘Dioscorides’, the physician “Galen”, was recorded to have earned renown for having perfected a complex narcotic called “Theriac” in the second century Anno Domini, a compound which, in fermenting sixty four ingredients including opium, hemp and viper flesh together for a number of months, was potentially physiologically stunning.\n\nAdapted for usage by the emperor Nero’s physician ‘Andromachus’ from a recipe devised by the legendary pharmacological king “Mithradites”, ‘Theriac’ subsequently became associated with with animal lore due to the diversity of it’s ingredients.\n\nHeralded as a cure for all ailments “Theriac” was, during the sixteenth century, introduced into England by the worshipful Grocer’s Company as “Venice Treacle”, an expensive active narcotic which, in being both composed largely of cane sugar and applied as a salve, was considered an effective antidote to poison.\n\nBoth Symposiums (large Kraters for mixing wine) and Attic cups, (jugs used in conjunction with pouring basins) were, in this instance, discovered amidst the remains of the pre-Christian “La Tene” culture, the moulded reliefs of barley were found printed upon pots exhumed from in the ruins of Knossos and the Etruscan civilization was known to have crafted flagons and wine jars from clay, a rather ambiguous testament to alcohol consumption perhaps, the existence of ancient cups does not alone signify the acceptability of inebriation. although Pliny the Elder was recorded to have made reference to grain based intoxicants in his writings and the Greek historian Herodotus was also observed to have mentioned the usage of laxatives, purges and emetics in his works, evidence to suggest that they were not unaware of such things.\n\nCypriots have also been recorded to have practiced the fermentation of wine for over three thousand years, a tradition which, in preceding that of Greece by about half a century, is currently preserved in the production of “Cyprus Sherry”, a drink, which despite it’s pedigree, was ironically favoured by the working classes in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nThe preparation of “Commandaria”, a sweet Cypriot dessert wine which include both the ‘Xynesteri’ and ‘Mavro’ grapes amongst it’s list of ingredients is mentioned both in the works of Pliny the Elder and in “The Hesiod” a term beneath which it was known as “Melitites”, a beverage which, in being composed of trampled sun dried grapes, was apparently used to appease discomfort.\n\n“Commandaria” was subsequently recorded to have been brewed in substantial quantities by the order of the Knights Templar in the thirteenth century a term beneath which it was reputed to have been consumed by Richard the Lionheart during the Crusades, a man who famously pronounced it “the king of wines and the wine of Kings”.\n\n“Zivania”, a distillate of ‘Commandaria’ frequently flavoured with cinnamon was also noted to have been produced by Cypriots in the fifteenth century, a brew which, in acquiring a strong raisin flavour when mature, was frequently valued for it’s age.\n\nDespite such ancient references, the modern experimental scientific method is generally credited to “Abdul Abbas Ad Nabath”, a Moslem scholar, notable for performing a number of studies into the nature of chemistry, a period after which, to all intents and purposes, the practise of brewing was outlawed through association with the Nestorian Herecy during the early medieval era.\n\nWith regards to the enforcement of such restrictions, the Jewish dietary law of “Kashrut” was observed to require that only Kosher ingredients could be included in Jewish beer, beverages which themselves needed to be made by Sabbath observant Jews, a term beneath which many of the older methods of food preparation were noted to have been abandoned in favour of what would amount to an early form of standardisation.\n\nHaving said this, “Gall Wine”, a beverage extracted from Poppies was probably also used as an ointment, if not a narcotic during the biblical era, “Gall Wine” being thought to have been the substance that was applied to Christ’s injuries after crucifixion, a term beneath which it became associated with the grail lore of Arthurian England.\n\nIn terms of preparation, the juice of the Poppy used for Gall Wine was turned into a strong black tea, the plant’s head or “Ro’sh” being used to fortify the beverage and lend it body, a process through which “Gall Wine” would possibly have resembled raw or unrefined opium.\n\nAlthough the actual antiquity of Samuel Solomon’s popular eighteenth century tonic, ‘Balm of Gilead’ remains questionable the concoction was, with regards to the brewing practices of ancient Israel notably recorded to have been marketed in London beneath the pretence that it originated in Judea more than 1,500 years before Christ, a claim substantiated by references to the preparation in the Old Testament of the bible.\n\nPrepared using extracts of the Balsam fir, Samuel Solomon’s eighteenth century recipe included Sage Mace, Rosemary and Turpentine amongst it’s ingredients, the concoction further being flavoured with lemon and sold as a cosmetic aid and fertility drug.\n\nPine tar was also used in the preparation of “Tar Water”, a beverage which, in being recommended by the author Henry Fielding as a curative, was also popular amongst Norwegian trawlermen during the eighteenth century.\n\nIn 1868 a man named James Death pronounced a beverage known as “Wusa” to be the beer of the ‘Isrealites’, a bread based porridge like substance which, in being described as “manna from heaven”, was presumably viewed in a positive light.\n\nWith respect to the incredible antiquity of brewing practices in North Africa, Persia and Jerusalem and the evidence of cultural continuation which they may suppose, the Urnfield culture of Central Europe was, almost 3,500 years ago, observed to have both cremated the remains of it’s dead and buried their ashes in pots, and given the nature of such a convention, it would be difficult to imagine that they did not also brew beer\n\nIndeed there is physical evidence to suggest that ditches were used as malt kilns in Germany up to 2,500 years ago, a tradition which would tally with the assertion that both the Urnfield and ‘Halstatt’ cultures were engaged in brewing at approximately the same time that the ancient Hittites and Greeks were establishing their empires.\n\nIn terms of British history, a brew known as “Fraoch” or Heather Beer was legendarily consumed in Scotland four thousand years ago, a formula which, in having been resurrected by the William brothers brewing company based in Scotland, is currently served at “The Rake” near Borough Market.\n\nMead or fermented honey is quite possibly of a similar pedigree to Heather Beer, a recipe recently revived by the Gosnell’s brewing company which is currently on tap at “A. Gold’s” next to the unearthed remains of the Bishop’s Square Charnel house in Spitalfields and also at “Reverend J.W Simpson’s” on Goodge Street.\n\nThe true antiquity of ‘Fraoch’ may remain a mystery forever, however a similar beverage was known to have been consumed in Marseilles during the pre-Christian era, a variety of Mead flavoured with Cumin in which bees were thought to have been drowned during fermentation, whether or not this particular recipe was intended as a boon or a poison remains a matter of conjecture, however the age of the reference remains noteworthy.\n\nCeltic ale was, in this instance, almost certainly brewed in Britain somewhat later in 54 B.C, a period during which “Atrectus Cereusarius” was the name given to the first named brewer or ‘Cereuse’ in England, an individual who was effectively recorded to have plied the garrisons of “Vindolanda”, situated along Hadrian’s Wall in North East England, with beverages fermented from ‘Brac’ or Emmer wheat.\n\nThe term “Gustators Cervisiae”, (food server), frequently used by Romans in association with brewing, indicating that alcohol was, though narcotic, not considered a poison at this date and Romans were known to have used hypocausts as permanent maltings or corn dryers between the third and fourth centuries Anno Domini\n\nThe term “tavern”, an expression still used to describe public houses, is derived from the Latin word Taberna, a definition which although subsequently associated with beer drinking, was, during the Roman era, probably devoted almost solitarily to the consumption of wine.\n\nA brew known as “Cervisa”, “Cerea” or “Caccia” was alleged to have been consumed in Spain and Gaul during the pre-Christian era, a drink which, in being known as “Brutus” or “Brytos” in Greece was probably similar to the Egyptian drink “Zythos”, a beverage which, in being composed of one third Barley, one third Safflower and one third salt, would, in keeping with the general consensus of pre-Christian alcohol usage, probably have served as a preservative rather than a narcotic.\n\nHowever the Romans were also observed to have recognised Gods of beer amidst their pantheons, the divinities Dionysus and Bacchus being associated with the ritual madness of “Eleusis”, “Bacchanalia” and “the Epiphany”, celebrations which, in being typified by satyrs, phallic imagery and wild female acolytes known as “Maenads”, were recorded to have been devoted to “the feeding of the dead through blood offerings”, a euphemism through which beer was potentially considered to be a dead creature resurrected by consumption, an instance in which “the Tale of Zagreus” is notable for representing an account of a man drawn heavenward garbed in the flesh of those that he had consumed by the Greek God Zeus, a reference which, although, abstract, may be be observed to go some way towards explaining how brewing became associated with the clothing guilds of the early medieval era.\n\nAmongst the many images which the cult of Dionysus chose to adopt were those of Fox skins, Fig Trees and “Thyrsese” or Fennel stalks, symbolism which, in appearing throughout the first chapters of the Old Testament would suggest some link with Judaism.\n\nThe Romans were, in this instance, also recorded to have imbibed the blood of gladiators slaughtered in conflict between the first and sixth centuries Anno Domini a convention potentially inherited from the practises of Hippocrates and Galen who observed that human health depended upon the balance of four constituent elements known as “Humours” within the body, a generalised term beneath which a correct quantity of yellow bile, black bile, phlegm and blood were deemed necessary to sustain metabolic function.\n\nWith regards to later evidence of brewing in Europe, The Flemish king “Gambrinus”, is, with respect to Roman dalliance in such matters, legendarily credited with the invention of beer 1,730 years Before Christ, a period during which it is unlikely that he would have occupied the European mainland, the analogy probably being adopted by the Dukes of Brabant sometime in the fourteenth century, although Gambrinus is notably mentioned in “the Aventius Chronicle” or “Austrian Chronicle Of The Ninety Five Seigneurs”, a medieval text which, in charting the ancestry of the Dukes of Austria through the kings of ancient Judea to Noah, remains one of the few accounts of the coventions which ascribed to the early European brewing tradition still in existence.\n\nFrequently depicted brandishing a tankard of ale, King Gambrinus was described as a giant descended from the prediluvian patriarch “Noah”, a man who, in being a paramour of the Egyptian divinity Isis, was initiated into the mysteries of brewing,\n\nAlthough perhaps possessing an element of truth, the tale of Gambrinus was later re-interpreted to include a wager with “Beelzebub”, an addition which throws many details pertaining to his reign into doubt.\n\nThere are, in this instance, a number of Assyrian tablets depicting Noah stocking his ark with beer, records which, in being approximately four thousand years of age, indicate that, there may well have been a middle Eastern brewing tradition inherited by the first inhabitants of Europe at some immemorial date.\n\nBeer was also recorded to have been brewed in Belgium throughout to the Crusades of the twelfth century, a period during which low strength alcohol was considered fresher than water, it being observed that Flemish Abbeys were granted permission by the Roman Catholic Church at this time to raise funds with the trade of alcohol but that such trade was also a punishable offence if the alcohol was too strong.\n\nWith regards to the historical truth of Belgium’s brewing heritage throughout the earliest epochs of European history, “Gampar”, an ancient British king was recorded to have founded the medieval cities of Cambrai, Hamburg and Flanders during the first millennium, communities which, in almost certainly brewing beer long before any comparable concern was recorded to have occurred in England, stand as a convincing testament to Belgium’s seniority in such matters.\n\nPerhaps through association with ‘Gampar’s’`exploits, the oldest commercial brewery in Europe is presently observed to be the ‘Wiehenstephan’ brewery in Belgium, an establishment which, in having been operational since at least the eleventh century, pre-dates not only the oldest comparable establishments of it’s type in Britain, but also the entire genre of brewing in a contemporary sense.\n\nIn having been operational since 1366 the “Tay On Den Horn” brewery situated in the town of Leuven is some years younger than that of ‘Wiehenstephan’, however it’s status as the origin Stella Artois lager currently places it at the forefront of the Belgian brewing industry, a term beneath which, through association with the American trade giant Anheuser Busch, it is largely responsible for the current popularity of lager in Europe.\n\nDespite such anciency modern “Saisoniers” or “session beers” derive from the late nineteenth century practise of brewing beer for consumption by farm workers, a convention through which such labourers were recorded to have been allotted five litres of beer a day.\n\nExtensively researched by writers such as ‘Peter Cromberg’, ‘Gert Van Lierde’, ‘Erick Verdonk’ and ‘Michael Jackson’, “Saisoniers” were probably initially brewed in Belgian monasteries and ‘Wallonian’ farm houses as ingredients for meat dishes such as “Boeuf Bourgignon”, there being some indecision as to whether the word ‘saisonier’ refers to the time of year in which it’s ingredients are harvested or it’s usage in the marination of meat.\n\nSubsequently served in specially designed “tulip” glasses and flavoured with orange zest, coriander and ginger, modern ‘Saisoniers’ are traditionally distinguished by their cloudy golden colour and spicy flavour\n\n‘Abbey Dubbel’, a strong brown Belgian ‘Saisonier’ initially brewed for consumption by Trappist monks at the Abbey of ‘Westmalle’ during the mid nineteenth century, was, in earning reknown for it’s restorative properties, later imitated by brands such as “Chimay”, “Achel”, “La Trappe”, “Koningshoeven”, “Bruin”, “Orivel”, and “Rochefort”, a process through which “Saison Dupont Vielle” was ultimately recorded to have earned the distinction of being one of the finest beers in the world.\n\nBrewing was, following, it’s inauguration into Belgian culture, later observed to have been practised amongst a number of monastic communities on the European mainland as early as the fifth century Anno Domini, a period during which monks were noted to have produced enough beer to become both self-sufficient and capable of effecting trade to finance their religious activities.\n\nMost alcohol at this time was probably composed of mixtures of metheglin extracted from beech sap and cider or Perry, a sour beer sweetened into liquor, although wines from Gascony and the Rhine were recorded to have been imbibed at a fairly early date, Gascony earning renown for it’s Armagnac through association with the Norman counts of Aquitaine , the Rhine with that of Riesling or “wine from the Gau” a sweet beverage which possibly owed it’s popularity to the viti-cultural pursuits of Charlemagne in Germany during the ninth century.\n\nThe Benedictine Abbots of St. Gall were, in this instance, thought to have brewed beer in the eighth century, a practise continued into the ninth century with the preparation of hopped beer in a number of Carolingian abbeys, an era before which “Gruit” a mixture of herbs and fruit would probably have been used instead of Hops to flavour beer.\n\nPrimarily used as a preservative, hops was, at this date, recognised to contain a resinous oil called Lupulin, (a chemical similar to that which may be extracted from the active narcotic Cannabis), a substance which. in imparting a bitter flavour to beer initially proved unpopular, a consensus which was recorded to have been confirmed during the early medieval era by the Archbishop of Cologne, a man who, in enjoying a monopoly upon the cultivation of brewing ingredients during his term of office, notably attempted to ban the cultivation of Hops in France.\n\nCharlemagne himself was recorded to have personally trained people in the art of brewing during his reign, a testament if nothing else, to beer’s acceptance by the Holy Roman Empire throughout the ninth century.\n\nThe origin of Brandy, a strong spirit repeatedly distilled until flammable, is, in this respect, as ambiguous as any of the Carolingian era although references to a siege weapon known as Greek fire exist and wood or coal fires were almost certainly used to produce the fabulous glass and metal work for which the period is renowned.\n\nArmagnac was recorded to have been distilled in Gascony during the early fifteenth century, a strong spirit which although often misinterpreted to have spawned from the Victorian era, is frequently referred to in the works of English alchemists and physicians during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. the process of separating and blending the distillates and substrates of wine being constituent to the production of both Sherry and Brandy.\n\nAlthough quite possibly pot stilled or bottle fermented in ceramic vessels during the medieval era, modern Brandy is conventionally matured for about four years in an oak barrel, a process through which it is both prized for it’s age and formally known as Brandy, a term which, in bring derived from the Dutch word “Brand”, meaning burnt, was undoubtedly first applied to the beverage during the seventeenth century.\n\nThere was, at this time, further evidence to suggest that beer was being transported by water, the ‘Graveny Boat’, an ancient viking vessel, being discovered to have contained beer casks within it’s hold an instance in which the preparation of alcohol was, in Scandinavian, mythology, correspondingly ascribed to “Aegir” the Norse God of the sea, a divinity who, with his wife “Ran” and her nine children, legendarily provided beer for the parties of the Gods, a pretext beneath which it may be presumed that Vikings were, in being the founders of the ‘cinque port’ system which served to build the first incarnation of London bridge, not entirely unacquainted with the recreational potential of beer.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n4… THE TWELFTH CENTURY… THE CLINK OF THE ANCHOR\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nAlthough the invention of the popular sparkling wine known as Champagne is most frequently credited to the endeavours of the lay brothers of the Benedictine ‘Abbey of Hautevilliers’ in the sixteenth century, or even those of the Benedictine monk “Dom Perignon” in the seventeenth century, it was very possible that grapes of the Pinot Noir variety were being fermented in France during the medieval era.\n\nIn 1115 Clairvaux Abbey in France was granted to the Knight Templar, ‘Hugh, Count of Champagne’, a period after which the English monarch Henry the Second, a man then also known as ‘The King of Jerusalem’ also adopted the title, formally becoming a Count of Champagne, a peculiar anomaly through which the English monarchy was observed to have been invested with both Jewish and French honours.\n\nClaret was, in this instance, recorded to have been imported into England from Bordeaux by “Rosbif” traders during Henry’s reign, a period during which both Bordeaux and it’s agricultural industries were noted to have been owned by the English monarchy, an aegis beneath which it was thought to have operated in accordance with a statute known as “The Police De Vins” an embargo that effectively prevented French merchants from selling back-logs of wine until that which was placed upon the open market had been bought.\n\nIn 1279 ‘Thibaud Gaudin’, Grand master of the order of the Knights Templar and Commander of the Land of Jerusalem was granted ‘Saint Nicoise’ Abbey in France, a period during which Champagne was very possibly fermented upon a fairly large scale in Europe.\n\nFrance’s influence upon early English brewing remains remembered to this day in the under-rated “Reunion Jacques” selection of wines and beers, a brand named in commemoration of “Jacques De Molay”, Grand master of the Knights Templar during the persecutions which ultimately led to the order’s down fall.\n\nWith regards to English history, the Abbey of Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk was also recorded to have produced alcohol in the 11th century a period during which dark beverages composed of malted barley sweetened with herbs were frequently considered cleaner than water, a distinction which, in pursuing sterility, perhaps gave rise to the cultivation of the bitter characteristics for which modern beer is renowned.\n\nAt approximately the same time that the wool trading communities of the Ely and Bury St. Edmunds were perfecting the formulae for what was to become modern beer, a remarkably early date for such a bitter drink, Southwark’s Borough Market was recorded to have been operational upon the South bank of the Thames by London Bridge, the bridge being observed to have been virtually the only thing situated in the Thames estuary at this time, a pretext beneath which, in conveniently spanning the river as it began to narrow, it was, to all intents and purposes, the direct precursor to the old walled city of London.\n\nReputed to have attracted traders selling grain, fish and vegetables throughout the Norman era, The Borough Market was, in the thirteenth century, re-located to The Borough High Street, a location in which it remained operational for almost half a millennium before being closed by Parliament in 1755.\n\nRe-opened by a group of local traders in 1756 upon the grounds of St. Margaret’s church, a period during which “Northfield Farm” and “Furness fish and game” traded upon the premises, the Borough market presently encompasses a selection of over a hundred individual stalls including butchers, bakers and grocers shops.\n\nThrough association with the brewing exploits of the Borough Market, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester almost certainly also established a brewing interest in Lambeth after having been granted province over the the ‘Clink’ prison by Henry the First in 1129.\n\nThe origin of the ‘Clink’ Prison’s association with brewing was, in this instance, observed to lie in the ancient English practice of sending convicts upon adventures to perform labours pending the incident of their execution, a pretext beneath the ‘Sangreal’ or Cup of Christ was, as an incentive which proposed fool proof neutrality with regards to it’s granted sphere of activity, effectively witnessed to be analogous with the production of beer, a process through which the British legal system had since the reign of Arthur in the sixth century Anno Domini betokened a strong affiliated with the brewing industry.\n\nNaturally the quality of the beer in this instance tended to be low even mildly toxic although, given that murder was a crime, this was surely not the industry’s primary intention and the drink’s value as an aggregate rather than a dietary provision was, in many cases presumed to be the guiding ethic behind it’s production, a process through which, in deviating substantially from the Ambrosiac qualities for which Absinthe was originally perceived to be prized, beer earned unwholesome distinction, through association with both the fertilization of crops and the livery halls of medieval London.\n\nFounded upon an older fabric of single roomed priest’s colleges “the Clink” was, in this instance, potentially the first English prison to divide male from female convicts, an establishment which rapidly achieved notoriety for employing solitary confinement and scourging with rods to subordinate it’s inmates.\n\nKnown to have both licensed begging and practised prostitution during the early medieval era, ‘the Clink’ was also recorded to have served as a hospice, renting out rooms to tenants for a nominal fee.\n\nAlthough sacked during the “Statutes of labourers” in 1450, a circumstance which was to become known as the “Peasant’s Rebellion”, the Clink was re-built and subsequently earned renown for incarcerating both religious fanatics and those who over-indulged at bank-side throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the site remaining active as a penitentiary through until 1780 when it was burned down during the Gordon riots.\n\nAlthough accurate records pertaining to the matter are rare, there was almost certainly a brewing industry in Southwark during the fourteenth century, the region being recorded to have possessed a hostelry known as the “Tabard by the Bell” in Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales.\n\nCited to have been a coaching Inn managed by a man named Henry Bailly during Chaucer’s era, “The Tabard” was thought to have been situated in what is now Talbot Yard on the Borough High Street, a location in which it was recorded to have been accompanied by a number of other public houses including “The Old Pick”, “The White Hart”, “The Spur”, “The Christopher” and “The Boar’s Head”, a hostel itself notable for having been frequented by Falstaff in the plays of Shakespeare.\n\nThe proliferation of such inns in the vicinity of the Borough Market throughout the medieval era indicates that they were both popular and profitable ventures, a success perhaps accreditable to the observation that London Bridge was closed at night forcing travellers to seek riverside accommodation.\n\nAlthough little more than a modern replica of such hostelry, “The George”, a traditional sixteenth century timber framed Inn still trades beer within the proximity of the Borough Market and remains open to the public to this day.\n\nThe Bishop of Winchester or ‘Prior of St. Mary Overies’ was also granted a license to use Thames water for brewing in Lambeth in 1509, and, in 1525, cast locks were recorded to have been employed in London to import and export beer. Local records upon the subject, inferring that beer was considered safer to drink than Thames water by the Southwark brewing industry at this date.\n\n_______________\n\nAt approximately the same time that the Clink was operative the Jerusalem Tavern was founded in Clerkenwell by the Priors of St. John, a monastic refectory which, although no longer present in the capital, once stood by the remnant of St. John’s Gate in the West End, defining the furthermost extent of the old walled city of London.\n\nRenowned for having been frequented by amongst others, ‘William Hogarth’, ‘Samuel Johnson’, ‘Oliver Goldsmith’, ‘David Garrick’ and ‘George Frederick Handel’, “The Jerusalem Tavern” remained in operation through until the eighteenth century selling three quart bottles of beer known as “Jerusalems”.\n\nBoth the “Old London Coffee House”, an establishment favoured by Joseph Priestley and Benjamin Franklin near St. Martin’s Church and the Abbey of St Stephen’s in Westminster were, through association with the Jerusalem Tavern also thought to have brewed ale in the twelfth century.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n5… THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY… THE BREWERS COMPANY\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nFollowing the military ethics which were perceived to have typified the Norman conquests of the eleventh century, the re-instatement of law which the ‘Magna Carta’ was, through conjunction with the establishment of both the ‘Inner and ‘Middle’ Temples by the ‘Order Of The Knights Templar’, observed to have represented, generally appeared to exert a consolidative influence upon London’s affairs, drawing it’s constituent elements together despite themselves beneath a common mayoral authority.\n\nInitially noted to have resulted in a fragmentation of the capital’s constitutional fabric, dividing it between a diverse selection of ‘Inns of Court’ assigned to dwell upon legal issues and an assortment of ‘Inns of Chancery’ devoted to the city’s industrial progress, the restitution of the ‘Magna Carta’ and it’s various statutes in England was, following both a Papal bull and a royal decree banning the study common law in the city, incidentally perceived to have resulted in a general migration of East end lawyers and brokers to ‘Furnival’s’, ‘Thavie’s’ and ‘Theobald’s’ Inns in Holborn, locations in which, despite differences of opinion, legal speculation nonetheless ultimately proved capable of pooling it’s ideas.\n\nSuch Inns were, upon having been initially conceived as the London residences of both regional Bishops and their households, in fact noted to have been relatively commonplace within the city during the medieval era, a pretense beneath which ‘Chichester’ Inn was, in being residential, to become known as the ‘Chichester rents’ that presently exist along Fleet Street, ‘Barnard’s’ Inn owned by ‘Sir Adam Le Basing’ was, through association with it’s proprietorship, to earn distinction as a mayoral office, and ‘Thomas’s’ Inn was, in apprenticing surgeons into it’s midst, to become ‘St. Thomas’’ hospital in Southwark.\n\nNoted to have been partially centralized alongside the property of a Dominican Friary in Cheapside beneath the aegis of the ‘Bishop Of Lincoln’ during the mid thirteenth century, a pretext beneath which the ‘Earl’s Of Lincoln’ were ultimately to serve as retainers for most of London’s regional concerns during the medieval era, such Inns, were, in representing the communal soul of the old walled city, similarly noted to be where alcohol was most likely to be drunk.\n\nAlthough ‘The City Of London Brewers Company’ had, in this instance, hypothetically existed since the reign of Henry the Second, being referred to by many names throughout the medieval era, the organisation was paradoxically also recorded to have been founded some years later in 1862, a term beneath which it would probably have been synonymous with many of the Metropolitan and Municipal associations then operative in the capital, and it was beneath this apparel that much of medieval London was noted to have been re-constructed.\n\nMuch of this re-construction was further destroyed in 1941 during the air-raids of the blitz, an occurrence which resulted in the temporary re-location of the ‘City of London Brewer’s Company’ to Kensington Gore, a trans-migration which then later re-occupied the City as ‘The City Of London Brewery and Investment Trust’.\n\nWith regards to the organisation’s Plantagenet heritage, the ‘Guild of our lady and St. Thomas A Becket’ was, in being at the center of the old walled city of London, recorded to have existed in the city during the late 12th century, a pretext beneath which it was, at this time, observed to be devoted to the memory of the popular medieval martyr, who, in having been murdered by Henry the Second, had incidentally become something of a public cause.\n\nIn 1215 ‘The Magna Carta’ was observed to confirm the predilections of ‘Thomas a Becket’s’ wayfarer cult with a law demanding the uniform measurement of ale, although whether such a statute was intended to insure generosity or responsibility with regards to the provision of such things remains of a largely ambiguous persuasion.\n\nIn keeping with the general sentiment of civil protest that distinguished, both the archbishop’s death and reinstitution of laws which prohibited such things , a number of London brewers were, perhaps through association with the constitutional changes wrought by the ‘Magna Carta’, recorded to have lodged formal complaints against the harassment of the local sheriffdom with regards to their activities during the late thirteenth century and proceeded to act as independents brewing beer for it’s own sake rather than through association with any over-riding legislature\n\nWhether an allusion to escapist oblivion or not, the ‘Guild of Our Lady and St. Thomas a Becket’ achieved a degree of success during the medieval era and many ecclesiastical inns were subsequently established along recognised pilgrim routes between London and Canterbury.\n\nEvidence of such viticulture remaining apparent in the village of Wrotham, along the Pilgrims way in Kent, a location which, in being blessed with a high concentration of small public houses, is surrounded by land upon which several species of grape thought to have been grown during London’s Roman era still thrive.\n\nWith reference to to the issue of English viticulture in contemporary terms, although the Marquis of Bute was recorded to have founded an extensive vineyard at Castell Coal in South Wales during the nineteenth century, and the ‘Denbies’, ‘Chappel Dunns’ and ‘Teffont’ vineyards were established during the twentieth century, there have been surprisingly few grape farms established in England during the last two hundred years, an absence largely attributable to the inclemency of English weather, grapes require temperate conditions to grow\n\nWith regards to the production of wine within the capital itself, “The London Cru Urban Winery” situated upon the site of an old nineteenth century Gin Distillery in Fulham, is presently observed to specialise in the many types of beverage that can be fermented from different grape varieties, an instance in which the winery is noted to boast a fine collection of old barrels that, in being inoculated with yeast, propose to serve in the continuation of the traditional processes of ageing and settling that were alleged to have been employed by vintners during the seventeenth century.\n\nThe term ‘Cru’ was, in this instance, observed to originate from the French word growth, an expression derived from the practise of pruning vines to achieve an optimum yield, a principle with which wine’s current popularity is surely well acquainted although, with respect to the drink’s cultivation upon English soil, new world wines are, upon being made from grapes grown within temperate realms, generally observed to be both better and cheaper than those of English origin.\n\nIrrespective of whether or not wine grapes could be grown easily for commercial purposes upon English soil during the medieval era, the convention of both brewing and trading beer upon the same premises was undoubtedly practised in London as early as 1320, a term beneath which inns known as “tied houses” were, in distinction from “Common brewers” who sold their ware to external retail outlets, recorded to have been placed beneath the governance of a single land-lord, an instance in which “The Bear” in Southwark was cited to have both brewed and sold it’s own beer.\n\n“The Bear” was also renowned for holding archery contests and chartering lavishly decorated “tilt boats” to those that wished to transit the Thames, a custom not unlike that of Venice in the Adriatic at approximately the same time.\n\nThe brewers company was formally founded in 1342 by John Enfield at All Hallows Church situated beside the old London wall, and, not forty years later London was known to have boasted over 300 commercial breweries, a period during which hopped beer was first recorded to have been prepared in the capital.\n\nThe practise of allowing drinkers to see their beer as it was being brewed was also witnessed to have occurred from a fairly early date, a process through which the clarity of ale was deemed indicative of it’s sterility, a matter of concern amidst the omnipresent threat of pestilence and disease which typified medieval London, an instance in which the maintenance of hygiene seemed frequently to coincide with no more than it’s promise, giving rise to a plethora of pretty drinks which, although confirmed to be potable, were observed to fluctuate precariously about an uncertain standard.\n\nThe list of ingredients which were included in many medieval beers, were, this instance often presumed to be indicative of cleanliness when otherwise of nebulous character, it being observed for example that convicts who imbibed Lavender wine or wore floral perfume proved more tolerant to the Black Death than those who did not, an opinion which was effectively observed to be reiterated in the eighteenth century when Gin was popular.\n\nIt was noted in the memorandum book of the clerk ‘William Porland’, that Henry the Sixth had granted the brewers guild a company charter during his reign and, that, at approximately the same time, Dick Whittington had criticized brewers for being “fat swans”, ordering them to sell ale at a penny a gallon and fining them for taking too much water from the “Chepe conduit”.\n\nAlthough Dick Whittington’s sentiments towards London brewing are subject to misinterpretation, a series of assertions through which he could easily have been observed to have perished alcohol as stale, the Mayor, much like the ‘Magna Carta’, ultimately seemed to have supported the sale of drinks in the city, an instance in which any excuse to engage in communal activities was considered a unifying influence.\n\nThe Brewers Company were in this sense, largely responsible for restricting the ingredients of beer to Malt Hops, Water and Yeast, a term beneath which the organisation has often been considered to represent a medieval prohibition.\n\nThe true origin of such a specific was, in this instance, in fact unlikely to have been the trade of beer in a commercial sense but, instead that of ‘Gruit’ a beverage which, in including such ingredients as ground Ivy instead of Hops within it’s constitution alongside a varying range of fruit and herbs, would very easily have been poisonous and demanded some form of control, an instance in which food and drink in general was simply not toxic.\n\nBy 1327 “Ale Conners” were appointed at Court to ensure the quality of bread ale and, in 1393 Richard the Second was recorded to have pronounced that all public houses must display an ale-stake, although such an analogy may, in practise, also have pertained to the legitimacy of brothels, an instance in which “Ale Wives” or “Brewsters” were known to have erected “Ale Wands” decorated much like Greek ‘Thyrsese’ with sprigs of foliage in public places to indicate when home brewed beer was, in what would appear to have been something of a Bacchanalian gamble, ready to be wheeled forth for display.\n\nThe first brewers hall was constructed within ‘Aldermansbury Sqaure’ in 1403, a building which, although subsequently destroyed by fire, was recorded to have been listed to the “Wardens And Communality Of the Mysteries Of the Art Of Brewing Of The City Of London”, a capacity in which it served as a Livery Hall, a misnomer creditable to the observation that many London Companies were associated with cloth production during the medieval era.\n\nNotable for having been rented to footballers in 1422, one of the earliest accounts of the popular ball game on record, the Brewers Hall was re-constructed in it’s initial location during the late seventeenth century, a period after which the brewing company’s interests were noted to have been protected by Royal Charter.\n\nWith regards to the allusion between brewing and cloth working “The Fullers and Shearman” company was, recorded to have been formed as a cloth workers guild in 1400, a company which, like the Brewers Company, received Royal charters, meeting halls and alms houses.\n\nBetween the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries The Fullers Shearman firm counted such illustrious figures as the diarist ‘Samuel Pepys’ and ‘William Lambe’ as it’s masters and both the geographer ‘Richard Hakluyt’ and the lord mayors ‘Sir William Hewett’ and ‘Sir Sydney Waterlow’ amongst it’s membership.\n\nThe exact origin of the term ‘Fullers and Shearmen’ is, in this sense, uncertain, although it is very possible that “fulling” was the immersion of fleece in urine, a convention which, in being practised both by the Greeks and in the “Fullonicae” of ancient Pompeii, felted and extracted fats from cloth, the fabric being treated with ‘Nitron’ and pounded or stamped upon in vaulted baths to the effect of accumulating reserves of butter, cheese and soap, a process through which the practise may once have been analogous to tales like that of of Jason and Argonauts in which fleece was stolen or removed from mythical serpents such as the ‘Hydra of Lerna’.\n\nIn 1408 the brewers guild devised their coat of arms, a motif dedicated to the pilgrimage and martyrdom of St. Thomas A Becket, however, in 1424, complaints were registered against the activity of foreign brewers in London, a sentiment which, in 1483, led to the formulation of a number of laws against impurities in beer.\n\nThe Brewer’s company coat of arms was adapted in 1544 to include a ‘demi-morien’ bearing the image of a wheat sheaf and a fair amount of brewing was recorded to have occurred upon the banks of the Thames east of the tower throughout the fifteenth century, a period during which old English ale gradually evolved into hopped beer.\n\nIt was interesting to note that, amongst many other ancient traditions, The Brewers Guild granted the founder members of the society of spectacles freedom of their company and automatically granted the children of ‘Aldenhams’ school membership into their circle.\n\nPerhaps through association with the Brewer’s Company, St. Paul’s Cathedral on Cheapside was recorded to have produced almost 70,000 gallons of beer in a year at the end of the thirteenth century, evidence to suggest that the trade of alcohol was flourishing in London at a surprisingly early date.\n\nBoth “Piment”, a beverage which, in being composed of fermented fruit and ambergris or musk and “Malmsey Wine” or “Monemvasia”, a sweet ‘Madieran’ wine, which earned further notoriety in 1478 when the Duke of Clarence was drowned in a vat containing the substance, were recorded to have been imbibed as aphrodisiacs during the twelfth century, an instance in which ‘Piment’ was, in frequently possessing a mead base. very possibly an early example of the popular sixteenth century drink “Hypocras”.\n\nIt was interesting to note, in this instance that ‘Malmsey’ wine was potentially named after ‘Malmsbury Abbey’ in Wiltshire where the ‘Old Bell’ hotel was observed to have been built in 1220, a location which, through association with the Bishop of ‘Malmsey’s’’ tenure at London’s Inn’s of Chancery during the thirteenth century, was noted to have produced wine.\n\nIn being popular among Tudor drinking circles, ‘Hypocras’ was originally thought to have been imported from the Mediterranean during the sixteenth century some years after ‘Piment’ was witnessed to have been consumed, but the similarities which may be perceived to arise in the description of the two drinks is nonetheless intriguing.\n\n“Hypocras”, was, in this instance, observed to have been a sweet liquor made from wine mixed with sugar, cloves, long pepper and cinnamon, a beverage that, in being filtered through a gauze known as a “Manicum Hypocraticum”, was possibly similar to ‘Sangrea’.\n\nThe original formula for ‘Hypocras’ was noted to include “Afromomum Meleagueta”, an African pepper related to ginger in it’s list of ingredients, a drug which was, throughout the medieval era, often observed to have been substituted for black pepper in brewing to improve the taste of wine.\n\nFrequently known as “Grain of Paradise”, ‘Afromomum Melegeuta’ later earned notoriety as a stimulant and diuretic, an instance in which “Red Hypocras”, was in adhering to the legislation that later pertained to such things, recorded to have contained little more than brandy and milk in more recent years, a recipe which would probably have resembled a trifle or blancmange of the medieval era.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n6… THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY… COLDHARBOR AND THE HOURGLASS\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nThe East Smithfield region of London suffered badly to the Black Death during the fourteenth century, there being evidence to suggest that 2,400 burials occurred in the vicinity of St. Mary Grace’s Abbey throughout the 1340’s, a circumstance which ultimately led to the establishment of the Hospital of St. Katherine in the area, a concern that, in being recorded to have brewed beer during the fifteenth century, miraculously survived both the dissolution of the monasteries and the English Civil War, being re-designated as a protestant house during the mid-seventeenth century.\n\nAlthough records pertaining the matter are rare, it was noted that Edward the Third commanded the lord Mayor of London to cleanse the city of the foul odour in which it languished during the epidemic, a period throughout which saltpetre, brimstone, sulphur, amber and even gunpowder were observed to have been burned in efforts to fumigate the city, a practise which resulted in both the wide-scale smoking of tobacco and the usage of nosegays or pouches filled with flowers to deflect the encroachment of the disease.\n\nDuring the reign of Edward the Second a man named Sir John Able was recorded to have owned a large manor house named “Cold Inn” by London Bridge along Upper Thames Street, a property subsequently acquired by the Merchant Draper and Lord Mayor “Sir John De Pulteney” and re-named “Pulteney’s Inn”, a building which was later to earn renown as a Plantagenet strong-hold beneath the charge of John Howard, Second Duke of Exeter,\n\nIn the fifteenth century “Pulteney’s Inn” was recorded to have passed through a succession of Plantagenet hands, being occupied by both Henry the Fourth and Henry the Fifth before ultimately being granted to “The Royal College Of Arms” by Richard the Third, a period after which the property was acquired by the Tudor monarchy, being granted to Henry the Seventh’s mother Margaret Beaufort.\n\nIn 1528, some years after the event of the Black Death, ‘Pulteney’s Inn’ was passed to the Clothworkers company on behalf of the “Fullers Shearman” firm, a period throughout which the property, then a sizeable preserve, was known as Coldharbour, a one pot brew house owned by ‘Mr. Pott’ being recorded to have existed in ‘Haywharfe’ at approximately this time.\n\n‘Mr. Pott’s’ brewery was, during the mid-sixteenth century, acquired by a man named Henry Campion and subsequently re-named “the Hourglass”, a period throughout which it became affiliated with the City of London Brewery Company, thereby drawing a direct link between it’s activities and those of the London brewing community prior before the Black Death.\n\n‘The Hourglass’ was. in this instance, recorded to have been managed by a man named John William Reynolds in 1587, a proprietorship beneath which the brewery effectively remained in the possession of the Campion family, being passed by rule of succession down Henry Campion’s line until ultimately destroyed during the Great Fire of London, a conflagration which was noted to have decimated many of the capital’s cottage industries causing a manner of common antipathy that paradoxically bound London companies together.\n\nOnce recorded to have been situated on the Coldharbour estate, ‘Brewer street’, presently owes it’s name to the breweries of Thomas Ayres and Henry Davis, ventures which although subsequently demolished were recorded to have been active in the area during the eighteenth century.\n\nRe-constructed in the mid-eighteenth century through association with such activity, The Hourglass later earned renown beneath the proprietorship of The Lord Mayor, Sir William Calvert, a period during which the establishment was registered to have collaborated with “The Peacock Brewery” on White Cross Street.\n\nSubsequently managed by a fellowship consisting of Felix Calvert The First, Robert Calvert, Charles Calvert, Robert Ladbroke and William Whitmore, “The Hourglass” was recorded to have gone into partnership with William Seward during the late eighteenth century, a period during which it operated beneath the name “Calvert and Seward”.\n\nThe Hourglass ultimately closed in 1922, a period after which many of it’s operations were transferred to ‘Stansfield and Company’s’ “Swan” brewery in Fulham.\n\nWith regards to the area’s naval heritage, by the turn of the seventeenth century the Cold Harbour estate was largely devoted to ship building, a term beneath which carpenters were often commissioned to construct barrels before effecting work on ships to prove that they were capable of achieving a sufficient standard of craftsmanship, a practise that circumstantially resulted in a stockpile of barrels which, in being filled with fluid, were proven sound.\n\nThe consumption of “Grog” by sailors was, in this sense, probably derived from the proofing of barrels with liquid, a convention which may, at this time, have been exacted as a form of punishment rather than a recreational pleasure, however “Grog” was, throughout the eighteenth century, apparently also a recognised drink composed of five parts Rum and two parts lemon juice served in boiling water with a clove, a piece of cinnamon and a lump of sugar.\n\nRiver traders were, in this instance, known to have sold ‘Wormwood’ ale among the huddle of vessels which sought harbor in the Thames estuary during the era of the celebrated seventeenth century diarist ‘Samuel Pepys’, a tradition which, in featuring ‘Absinthe’ within it’s catalog of dietary supplements, may, through association with London Bridge, well have been observed to extend back to the tilt boats and skiffs of the medieval era.\n\nNoted to have sailed in ‘bumboats’, which owed their name to the time honored practice of drawing up to neighboring vessels at port, ‘Wormwood Ale’ traders would, in strafing shorelines for sprigs of ‘Artimisia Maritima’ or ‘Sea Absinthe’, a plant which, in being affectionately referred to as an ‘old woman’, was incidentally witnessed to grow in the coastal waters around the British isles, effectively brew their own ‘Purl’ tonic ale for the purpose of commercial exchange, boarding other’s ships to conduct business, before continuing on their course.\n\nI am uncertain as to exactly how strong such beverages were but, taking into account the observation that the sweet wort produced from malted barley was considered best when consumed fresh and would would theoretically taste a little like ‘Sarsparilla’ from the American ‘Sasafras’ tree when mixed with ‘Wormwood’, then I would imagine that, in disguising it’s alcohol content, ‘Purl’ tasted a little like root beer unless of course, it was being used as the base for some form of spiced rum to garnish trifles.\n\nScurvy grass or ‘Cochlearia’, a variety of coastal cabbage was, through association with naval drinking habits, also recorded to have grown in abundance along the banks of the Thames between Erith and Gravesend during the medieval era, a plant which, in earning renown, for it’s ability to ameliorate the symptoms of the mariner’s disease, scurvy, was often added to beer, a term beneath which, in being slightly salty, it would, in fact, probably not have been much stronger than root beer.\n\nDespite such an observation, it was nonetheless recorded to have been the case that a beverage known as Henry Clark’s Compound spirit of Scurvy grass was being sold in London as an elixir in 1664, a recipe that, in being mixed with strong liquor to the effect of rendering it a potent alcohol, was later noted to have been perfected by a brewer named ‘Sieur De Venantes’.\n\nConsumed throughout an era in which London was severely afflicted by plague, the fate of Scurvy Grass as a popular drink potentially played subject to criticism, being thought, in many instances to be associated with the spread of disease, although St. Bartholomew’s Hospital was, in 1669. recorded to have prepared ale constituted from Scurvy grass and a number of East London brewers continued to produce the Spirit during the latter years of the seventeenth century.\n\n__________________\n\nAlthough Alcohol in it’s present form was probably not that popular during the fifteenth century, beverages composed of fermented fruit and curdled milk were recorded to have been widely consumed throughout the medieval era.\n\nKnown by many names including “Syllabubs”, “Possets” or “Caudels”, such drinks generally consisted of whisked cream floated on sweetened wine, a guise beneath which they bore a resemblance to souffles rather than drinks.\n\nThe terms “Molly-Coddler” and “Tart” probably owe their origins to the consumption of Caudles, an analogy through which the beverage is likened to a woman.\n\nWhether derived from the practises of the many convents and nunneries which distinguished East London at this time or from the pleasantries which presumably circumstanced the imbibement of such drinks remains a matter of conjecture.\n\nThe modern drink “Eggnog” potentially owes it’s origins to the medieval syllabub, a beverage composed of an egg blended with two parts brandy, two parts rum and three parts single cream before being mixed with ice and syrup and sprinkled with nutmeg.\n\nIn 1400, the book of Margery Kempe represents a relatively rare attempt to record the practice of brewing beer in Norfolk, a document which in virtually standing alone as a vanguard for such things, is observed to coincide neatly with both the resurgence of such industry in the aftermath of the Black Death and the subsequent petition to control the trade of alcohol during the late fourteenth century through association with such activity.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\n7… THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY…THE RED LION OF LOWER EAST SMITHFIELD\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nInterestingly small town houses were recorded to have been used for brewing in both London and other cities throughout the fifteenth century. The home of the Southampton brewer “John Fortin”, for example, was known to have possessed a wine cellar in which alcohol was stored although containing vessels would probably have been made from ceramic at this time.\n\nIn 1492 a Fleming named John Merchant was recorded to have been licensed to sell fifty tonnes of “Berre Pennant” from a “Bere house” in East Smithfield, a venture which, during the sixteenth century expanded to encompass the “Red Lion” Brewery located by St. Katherine’s Quay, it being observed that it was possible at this date for members of the public to collect their own malt for brewing after having paid fees to a local authority.\n\nThe Red Lion operated beneath the patronage of the Earls of Leicester from 1492 through to the Elizabethan era, a period during which a man named “Geoffrey Gates” was recorded to have brewed for Henry the Eighth in the area.\n\nThe events which which led to the choice of the Red Lion as a symbol for the beer trade remain ambiguous, the image displayed upon the original public house was almost certainly that of a lion rampant purpur, perhaps the soporific effects of alcohol were valued at this date.\n\nAlmost five hundred tonnes of ale were registered to have been exported to Europe during the sixteenth century, evidence to suggest that the trade of alcohol was flourishing at this time, a period during which The Red Lion public house of Lower east Smithfield was recorded to have been a victualling yard.\n\nIn 1705 The Red Lion brewery situated in the St Katherine’s district of Lower East Smithfield was recorded to have been owned by Humphrey Parsons a period during which the brewery earned renown for supplying the court of Louis the fifteenth with Porter, evidence to suggest that the drink was being brewed in various forms some years before the official date of it’s invention.\n\nIn 1672, Richard Hoare a member of the worshipful Company of Goldsmiths founded Hoare’s bank in West London an interest that earned distinction throughout the seventeenth century at Cheapside, employing the emblem of a Golden bottle or Toby Jug as it’s standard, “Hoare’s Bank” became widely associated with the exchange of goods for tokens in many London public houses, a pretext through which the company later became affiliated with the brewing industry.\n\nCounting amongst it’s clients such notable individuals as the Jacobean diarist Samuel Pepys, the artist Godfrey Kneller and even Catherine de Braganza, Hoare’s bank was notable for wielding considerable influence during the establishment of the Royal Exchange throughout the latter years of the Stewart era.\n\nHoare’s Bank was, almost three hundred years after the brewery’s foundation, observed to have purchased the Red Lion Public House on St. Katherine’s Quay in 1802, an acquisition which, in narrowly preceding the movement of the Royal Mint to East Smithfield, was to coincidentally presume the wide scale industrialisation of the Wapping area, a period during which a number of impressive Boulton and Watt steel presses were constructed upon the North bank of the Thames.\n\nIn 1780 Southwark replaced Stourbridge Fair as the biggest Hop market in England and in 1784, ‘Henry Goodwyn’ was recorded to have installed a steam engine to pump beer at the Red Lion, the arrival of the Royal Mint in East Smithfield serving to render the usage of steam power almost commonplace in the area.\n\nWhether directly accreditable to the Red Lion brewery or not there is apparently a Red Lion cocktail composed of two parts Gin and two parts Grand Marnier brandy mixed with one part lemon juice and one part lime juice currently available at many public houses, a beverage which, in being traditionally shaken with ice and consumed from a sugar rimmed glass, probably owes it’s origins to the drinking passions of the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nBrewing was also recorded to have occurred at Mortlake’s “Stag” brewery during the fifteenth century where the reservoir system of ‘Castlenau’ which once covered most of Barnes could provide fresh water to those that had fled what was then viewed to have been the epicenter of the Black death during the preceding century, a period during which a man named Thomas Greene was registered to have been the master of the Brewers Company at Westminster Abbey, it being observed that the Abbey had effectively continued to brew beer throughout the period of dissolution which distinguished the Tudor era and ultimately established a brewery named the ‘Stag’ in Pimlico two hundred years later in 1641 beneath the proprietorship of a man named William Greene thereby hypothetically formalising the term beneath which either the Mortlake or Pimlico ‘Stag’ had once existed.\n\nThe Pimlico Stag was, like it’s predecessor, recorded to have passed by rule of succession down William Greene’s line during the eighteenth century a period throughout which the establishment was interestingly noted to have been situated upon the grounds of St. James’ Palace, it being recorded that a series of Royal Mews associated with an extant brewery on the site were removed when Buckingham House became Buckingham Palace in the area.\n\nIn hypothetically having been part of the same push that found occasion to furnish Barnstaple, Bristol, and Northumbria with the scattered remnants of old London town, the Stag’s return to the capital, appeared, beneath the strength of it’s provision, to take pride of place within the economy of the city’s subsequent bearing and to proceed as it once had done before the event of the occurrences which had sent it hither.\n\nSold to Moore, Elliot and Co. in the early nineteenth century, a process through which ‘John Lettsom Elliot’ was, in 1837, eventually to collaborate with the celebrated Wandsworth brewer James Watney, The Pimlico Stag, forfeited much of it’s land during the construction of Victoria Station, a period after which it’s interests were largely managed by James Watney, the brewery ultimately falling beneath the jurisdiction Watney and Co. in the late nineteenth century, an interest which merged with it’s two primary rivals Combe and Reid in 1898 to form the Watney, Combe, Reid organisation.\n\nThe Pimlico Stag was ultimately closed in 1959, the site currently being occupied by the Headquarters of Associated Portland Cement, however the Stag in Mortlake remains operative to this day, a brewery which, in having been owned by Charles James Phillips and James Wigan in the 1840’s was acquired by Watney and Co. during the mid twentieth century and sold on to the American multi-national ‘Anheuser Busch’.\n\nIn 1989 John Gilbert developed Golden Ale, an innovative light beer currently available beneath the brand name “Summer Lightning” at Mortlake’s Stag, the brewery being commandeered by ‘Anheuser Busch’ some years later through association with the large scale production of Budweiser beer.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n8… THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY… PARACLESUS AND THE TUDOR RAM\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nSixteenth century inns were, in practical terms, probably little different from those of the earlier medieval era, being associated with the cock fighting bear baiting, prostitution and illicit marriages that typified many fourteenth century public houses.\n\nThere were many taverns operative in London during the early Tudor era a list which, in extending to include “The Mitre” at Cheapside, “The Falcon” at Bankside, “The Devil” at Temple Bar, “The Star and Garter” at Pall Mall and “The Spiller’s Head” at Clare market, presents evidence to suggest that brewing was widely practised in the city throughout the sixteenth century.\n\nIn 1520 The Prospect of Whitby or “Devil’s Tavern” was established along Wapping street, a public house which, in betokening reference, to the Holy Synod and the fortunes of the Jacobite cause during the Stewart era, was apparently named after a Whitby registered ship moored upon the Thames within it’s proximity,\n\nRenowned for being a favoured haunt of the infamous hanging Judge “George Jeffries”, a customer who was reputed to have watched criminals shackled to mooring posts drown in the area, “The Prospect of Whitby”, was, throughout the sixteenth century, recorded to have been one of the most well frequented public houses in London.\n\n“The Red Cow” near Wapping Old Stairs, an Inn allegedly named in homage to the practise of trawling fish, was also thought to have been frequented by the infamous judge, an association though which Jeffries was rumoured to have watched men being hung at Execution Dock whilst sitting upon the establishment’s balcony, a pastime confirmed by the inn’s proximity of the “Captain Kidd” public house along Wapping High Street, a tavern named in commemoration of the Scottish pirate James Kidd who was legendarily hung from the Dock.\n\nNot long afterwards the “Old Cock Tavern” was established along Fleet Street, a bar frequented by amongst others, the playwright Oliver Goldsmith, the ghostly head of whom is rumoured to appear partially buried in the courtyard outside the public house at certain times of the year.\n\n“The Cheshire Cheese” public house still stands along Fleet Street from this era, a tavern which, in pioneering the usage of tokens as a form of exchange, later earned renown for possessing a talking parrot named Polly that was reputed to be capable of emulating both bar-side invective and the sound of beer being poured.\n\n‘The Artichoke’ public house was also recorded to have existed in the Whitechapel area during the late sixteenth century, a period throughout which it was notable for having been frequented by the celebrated Elizabethan mariner, ‘Walter Raleigh’,\n\nPresently the site of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, the Artichoke coaching inn potentially dates back to 1420, a period during which the premises were recorded to have been occupied by a man named Robert Chamberlain, the public house remaining in operation through until 1570 when the property was leased to the master bell maker Thomas Lester for usage as a foundry.\n\n“John Byde Bell”, a master brewer of the brewers company, was, perhaps through association with such foundries, recorded to have owned a brewhouse in Shoreditch in 1653, an establishment which, through association with “the Rose and Crown public house” in the area, earned renown for serving a variety of beverages including ‘Alderman Byde’s Ale’, Caribbean Rum and English Champagne or “Malmsey Wine”, a drink which, in possessing a staunch medieval heritage, was, itself, notable for having been favored by the celebrated seventeenth century diarist Samuel Pepys.\n\nWhether or not the bells made at Whitechapel were ever used to contain beer or the foundry’s furnace to distill spirit at this date remains a matter of conjecture, it being more likely that bell casting achieved a degree of commercial acceptability during the construction of St. Paul’s cathedral slightly further West quite separately from brewing industry.\n\n____________________\n\nAlthough beer was perhaps not as popular in Tudor courts as recent interpretation would appear to suggest, inebriation having been a punishable offence for which men were recorded to have been both sent to the stocks and forced to wear hollowed out beer barrels in public, it was almost certainly the case that many sixteenth century households flavoured their drinking water in efforts to preserve it from contaminants which were thought to cause disease, a process through which the convention of hermetic containment probably led to the fermentation of beer.\n\nHenry the eighth was known to have had two personal brewers, one for ale and one for beer during his reign, 13,000 pints of beer a day being produced at Hampton Court Palace during the sixteenth century although such beverages were probably most frequently sterilised by baking and used for cooking at this time, a distinction through which they were known as “Small beers”.\n\nSpiced mead, Perry, cider and Sack brandy or sherry were almost certainly consumed during the Tudor era, although it is unlikely that such drinks were intentionally alcoholic, modern Perry (or pear cider), is a very mild beverage easily mistaken for lemonade.\n\nWith regards to the peculiarity of the term “Sack Brandy”, “Sack” is probably a derived from the French word “Sec” meaning sweet, an analogy which, in being drawn from the sweetness of the concentrated substrate of distilled wine, is potentially also the origin of the word “sick”.\n\nMany Tudor houses were recorded to have possessed physic gardens in which selections of medicinal herbs including poisons were grown, a resource to which noblemen were known to have referred when smitten by ailments ranging from tooth ache, tonsillitis, and haemorrhoids to more serious conditions such as sweating sickness.\n\nIt was interesting to note in this instance that many of these medicines incorporated the cured bones and hide of creatures the no longer exist in England, powders composed of ground unicorn horn, the bones of Britain’s native lion, bear paws, mammoth tusks, boar’s skin, it seemed that there had been something of a mass extinction upon the British mainland in the intervening years.\n\nThere were 139 vineyards recorded to have existed in England during Henry the Eighth’s reign, 11 owned by the crown, 67 by noblemen and 52 by the church, a period during which a man named Geoffrey Gate was recorded to have brewed for the King.\n\nAlcohol was, during the late sixteenth century, recorded to have been consumed from a variety of leather handled wooden cup treated with pitch known as a “Black Jack”, an analogy through which the term black jack was also used to refer to small hand-held ambush weapons, evidence to suggest that Tudor drinking practises were perhaps not as peaceable as one would initially suppose.\n\nBeverages known as ‘Mad Dagger Ale’ and ‘Dragon’s Milk’ were known to have been produced during the reign of Elizabeth the First, a monarch who was also recorded to have complained about the cost and strength of a beverage known as “Doble Doble beer”, a brew which, in paying homage to the Elizabethan law of compensating twice what was owed for the crime of theft, was noted to have been recently been re-created in Belgium by Trappist monks, and the celebrated playwright “William Shakespeare’s” father was apparently a professional “ale conner” by trade, a vocation which, was alleged to have habituated the practise of sitting in small puddles of beer wearing leather britches, the consistency of stale beer being thought stickier than freshly brewed ale.\n\nCommercial brewing was, in this instance, known to have occurred at the the Ram brewery in Wandsworth during Elizabeth the First’s reign, a period during which the brewery was known as the “Tap and Tun Room”, an establishment owned by a woman named “Elizabeth Ridon” although in 1576 a man named ‘Humphrey Langridge’ was recorded to have leased beer to an extant Ram public house in the area, thus predicting the brewery’s subsequent identity.\n\nIn 1803 the Surrey Iron railway opened in South London, a project which, in being designed to transit goods between the Ram and Croydon, presaged the wide-scale industrialisation of the Wandsworth area, and In 1831 ‘Charles Allen Young’ and ‘Anthony Fothergill Bainbridge’ purchased the Ram brewery, a period during which much of the old brew-house was destroyed in a fire and largely re-constructed.\n\nRenowned for producing both Porter and Bitter during the mid-nineteenth century, the Ram passed to Charles Allen Young’s son “Charles Florence Young”, an ownership beneath which the brewery suffered yet more fire damage and was again largely re-constructed.\n\nSituated upon the banks of the ‘Wandle’, the Ram was during it’s period of activity, a vast courted structure known as the “Ram Quarter”, a building almost entirely separated from the urban township which lay at it’s girth.\n\nOnce used as a stabling yard for a pack of of draught horses which were, up until the site’s closure in 2006, used in tandem with Thames barges for delivering ale, the Ram was, during the nineteenth century, recorded to have been equipped with two steam powered beam engines, machines which remained in usage upon the premises through until 1980's.\n\nRenowned for preserving a Dorset Horn Ram as it’s mascot, the name of the brewery is more probably derived from the fleece of effervescence caused by the addition of fresh yeast to a fermenting beer vat during brewing.\n\nIn 1905 The Ram Brewery in Wandsworth first started selling bottled beer, the company continuing to expand throughout the twentieth century acquiring Foster’s lager in 1962 and Cockburn Campbell limited in 1973.\n\nYoung’s shire horses were notably chosen to draw the Lord mayor’s coach through London during the Lord Mayor’s Show of 1998 although Wandsworth’s Ram brewery sadly closed in 2006 after having operated in the area for almost half a millennium it’s operations being transferred to the Charles Wells brewery in Bedford, a period during which the company acquired “Courage bitter”, a brand which in being established in 1787 by John Courage at the ‘Horselydown Lane’ brewery in Bermondsey, was notably synonymous with the renaissance of Southwark’s Anchor brewery.\n\nYoung’s eventually completely merged with the Charles Wells Limited in 2011 to form “Well’s and Young’s”, a term beneath which the firm became affiliated with the successful “John Bull”, “Bombardier” and “Kestrel Super” brands, the conglomerate also acquiring “Mc Ewan’s Export” from the Heineken company at approximately the same time.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — —\n\n‘Philipus Aureolus Theoprastus Bombastus Von Hohenhelm’ a medievel alchemist better known as ‘Paraclesus’ was recorded to have devised a recipe for Laudanum or “whole opium” in the early sixteenth century, an extremely bitter drug later camphorated to make Paregoric, evidence to suggest that the Tudors were inclined to favor getting high to the comparatively mediocre sluggish thrills that alcohol may be presumed to afford.\n\nThe celebrated Swiss scientist also recommended both mixing red wine with earthworms and moss which had been placed in the cerebellum of a hanged man to cure wounds and the application of powder ground from the remains of mummified criminals to appease breathing difficulties.\n\n‘Paraclesus’ was also fascinated by the medical properties of magnets, suggesting that magnets infused with mummified human remains and plant seeds may represent an effective remedy for ailments.\n\nAlthough the wisdom behi"
