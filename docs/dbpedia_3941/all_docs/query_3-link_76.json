        "text": "After a great 2021 season, the teams stepped that up by improving on things again for the school this season.\n\nSt Thomas had 22 basketball teams competing this season. 8 of those teams in the Saturday CBA competitions.\n\nIn 2022 the Senior Boys qualified and competed at the National tournament for the first time in school history up in Palmerston North. We made our first Thompson Trophy Final for the very first time. We finished 2nd overall in Canterbury in the Regular season. Then off to the South Island Tournament. Finishing 5th overall winning 7 games and losing just 1. Our best result yet!\n\nThe results for the First V were particularly impressive if you consider how many young players we have. 4 Year 10’s played, 2 year 11’s, everyone else are Year 12’s apart from Kobe Northmore and Oli Wong. So the majority of our team return for 2023.\n\nOur Under 15 team won their Grand Final in the Canterbury competition which was super exciting. And our Under 17 team made their Semi-Final. Just 3 points away for also making a final. Top results across the board! We also have a Under 13 team play in the Saturday competition for the first time.\n\nWe have a NZ representative in Louie Gordon who was selected for NZ Under 17’s and the 3v3 team, Hugo Gonzalez was selected also but was unfortunately unable to travel with the team. But sensational to have them both named.\n\nMana Martin and Rhylee Henderson were involved in the Under 15 NZ camps. JR Thomas & Jack Fale went to NZ Talent Camps. Mana Martin was also given a huge acknowledgement from Canterbury Basketball claiming the Under 15 MVP & Finals MVP award as well as MVP for the Under 17 grade. Incredible. Stay tuned for a big 2023 season.\n\nHonours Board:\n\nLouie Gordon : NZ U17 Team. NZ 3×3 U17 Team.\n\nHugo Gonzalez : NZ 3×3 U17 Team (selected but unable to travel)\n\nMana Martin : NZ U15 Squad\n\nRhylee Henderson : NZ Talent Camp\n\nJack Fale : NZ Talent Camp\n\nJR Thomas : NZ Talent Camp\n\nJoe Hammond\n\nHead of Basketball\n\nAs a sport, rowing provides those who compete with a unique opportunity to engage in a discipline unparalleled by most. Perseverance, resilience, and a rich culture of community are but a few of the many benefits offered to those involved with the sport.\n\nAt St Thomas of Canterbury College, the students are encouraged to involve themselves in the rowing program, which provides similar notions of dedication and determination built upon the foundation of brotherhood, informed by the special character of the College. The young men are inspired by both the collective history of the sport as well as a shared sense of commitment to each other. Rowing at school-aged level promotes effective time management skills and has a notable effect on academic achievement, as students become more productive with their time. Most of the students cite these benefits themselves as the reason for continuing their service to the sport while also noting a real sense of personal growth achieved as a result.\n\nCurrently, we have a squad of 34 boys plus a team of passionate coaches who are busy training and competing over the summer months. The Selwyn River is where the squad does all their on-water training and regattas are held either at Lake Hood in Ashburton or Lake Ruataniwha in Twizel.\n\nThe rowing season starts around August/September time and finishes up with nationals in late March. The boys have a break over the Christmas period before jumping back into training in early January.\n\nThe goal of every rower is to be selected in the squad to represent St Thomas at the Aon Maadi Cup. The Maadi Cup is the national regatta for rowing in New Zealand. This regatta holds the record as the biggest secondary school sporting event in the Southern Hemisphere, over 2000 athletes from around the country come to compete for national glory.\n\nCurrently one of our old boys Nathan Flannery is part of the New Zealand elite rowing squad with the likes of Robbie Manson and Mahe Drysdale.\n\nIf you think you may be interested in joining the rowing team you can email acoulthard@stc.school.nz for more info.\n\nLast Season’s Top Results\n\nU18 NOV 2x GOLD MEDAL South Island Secondary Schools Regatta\n\nU15 4x SILVER MEDAL South Island Secondary Schools Regatta\n\nU15 8x BRONZE MEDAL South Island Club Regatta\n\nU15 4x BRONZE MEDAL South Island Club Regatta\n\nU18 NOV 2x BRONZE MEDAL South Island Club Regatta\n\nNational Titles\n\n2010\n\nBU18 4x Aon Maadi Cup Regatta GOLD MEDAL, Trevor Croker Memorial Shield"
