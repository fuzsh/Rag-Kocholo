        "text": "This week the new Duke of Westminster inherited a multi-billion pound property portfolio - which began with his ancestor Sir Thomas Grosvenor acquiring 500 acres of swamp, pasture and orchards in the 1670s.\n\nThe expansive business owned by the Grosvenor family started 338 years ago when Sir Thomas, an ancestor of the late 6th Duke of Westminster, married a wealthy heiress.\n\nIn 1677, Sir Thomas wed Mary Davies who had just inherited a medieval manor in Middlesex - now part of London - and 500 acres of swamp, pasture and orchards to the west of the capital.\n\nThe land that she received remained relatively untouched until the Grosvenor family began developing the area in 1720.\n\nAround 300 acres of the original land which Miss Davies inherited before she met her husband remain with the family today.\n\nIt forms the Grosvenor's London estate which contributed to Gerald Grosvenor's £9billion fortune - which his only son Hugh, 25, has just inherited.\n\nThe first development the family got involved in was in the early 18th century when they built on the northern part of their land in London - an area which is now known as Mayfair.\n\nThe area was built as a fashionable residential district - centred on Grosvenor Square - and it has now become an exclusive part of the city's West End.\n\nIt took its name from the fair held there each May until well into the 19th century and the unique character of the area continued to evolve through its redevelopment.\n\nThe Grosvenor family's second big development came around 100 years later and was another exclusive part of London - Belgravia.\n\nIt is just one mile south west of Mayfair and was developed by the family after the end of Napoleonic Wars and the conversion of Buckingham Palace - which is just one mile east.\n\nThe area takes its name from one of the Duke's subsidiary titles, Viscount Belgrave, and the village of Belgrave is just two miles from the Grosevnor's family country seat in Cheshire.\n\nDuring the 1820s, Thomas Cundy, the family's surveyor, created a masterplan for what was to become the lavish area in west London.\n\nMr Cundy, together with builder Thomas Cubitt, oversaw the creation of the estate which overlooked the upmarket streets and private gardens.\n\nAnd after developing the two parts of central London, the family business expanded on a global scale.\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the business expanded into the Americas and developed Annacis Island and Vancouver in Canada in the 1950s.\n\nThe family business then moved into Australia during the 1960s before they started developing in Australia in the 1960s.\n\nThey then moved to Asia in the early 1990s and continental Europe just before the millennium.\n\nIn April 2000, the firm moved into new London officers and the business was headed by the 6th Duke of Westminster, who was Chairman of the Trustees.\n\nThe hugely-successful company remains privately owned.\n\nWithin his portfolio is Grosvenor Square, which was first developed in the 1720s and became one of London's most fashionable residential addresses.\n\nAnother part of the Grosvenor estate is Eaton Square in London’s Belgravia, full of grand houses behind Grade II-listed white stucco facades.\n\nSpringside is a £200million Grosvenor development in the Fountainbridge area of Edinburgh featuring more than 600 new homes, while the £48million Barton Park will be a new residential area in the north east of Oxford, with up 885 new homes and a primary school planned.\n\nAnd Liverpool One is a £900million, 2.7million sq ft Grosvenor development in Merseyside with 200 shops, 500 apartments and two hotels. Also on the list of Grosvenor developments is the £18million Parkside Place in Cambridge."
