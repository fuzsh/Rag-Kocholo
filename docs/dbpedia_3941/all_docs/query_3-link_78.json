        "text": "“The first indisputably great composition of the 21st century.” “A work of genius.” “A huge talent with limitless possibilities in front of him.” Strong words to describe a piece you may have never heard, and a man the world hadn’t, until recently, heard from in nearly ten years.\n\nArgentinian composer Osvaldo Golijov made his mark in 2000 with La Pasión según San Marcos (“St Mark’s Passion”) for voice and orchestra. Melding Latin-American and Afro-Cuban musical styles to tell the story of Jesus’s last days before the crucifixion, its premiere was met with “ululating”, “hysteria” and “euphoria”, according to its first reviewers. Golijov was soon hailed as the voice of the new millennium.\n\nSome big projects followed – a major festival of Golijov’s music at the Barbican in 2006; a film score for Francis Ford Coppola’s Youth Without Youth (2007); and even a Grammy (for his 2006 opera Ainadamar about Spanish playwright Lorca). But soon after: silence. It wasn’t until 2020, with Falling Out of Time, a setting of Israeli author David Grossman’s eponymous genre-bending book about a father grieving for his son, that this supposed modern master was heard from again.\n\nAnd with La Pasión opening the Edinburgh International Festival tomorrow, the mystery of Golijov comes rushing back to mind. How could the fields lie fallow for a decade, for a man once met with a near-20-minute standing ovation at a concert of his new music? How did Golijov fall from grace and out of time? It makes you pause for thought about pauses.\n\nBecause Golijov is not the first classical music composer to experience a creative hiatus of some kind. Rossini famously, in “the great renunciation”, called time on composing operas when only 37 – having written 39, he lived for 40 more years without producing another, delivering only the songs and chamber pieces he winkingly called “the sins of old age”. Sibelius’s “silence of Järvenpää” (named for the town he lived in until his death) cast a shadow over his last 30 years, in which he produced no major works. What makes the well, for classical music composers, dry up?\n\nOf course, every cultural form has its one-hit wonders – fiction has Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird; art has Grant Wood’s American Gothic; and pop has The Crazy World of Arthur Brown.\n\nBut music psychology expert Dr Robert Woody explains why classical composers might be particularly susceptible to writer’s block. Often with multiple movements, frequently longer, and valued for their “sophistication or complexity”, he says: “The works of classical music, compared to other musical genres, exist on a larger scale.\n\n“It follows that classical composers’ dry spells might appear larger than those of other creative artists,” he says. It seems, then, that there’s something about the greatness expected of classical music composers particularly, which makes both the fear and risk of falling short closer companions.\n\nThis view underpins some of the classic takes on well-documented cases like Rossini’s or Sibelius’: that ill health, mental and/or physical, either brings on a fear of failure, or means composers are less well-positioned to avoid it. Guy Rickards, Sibelius’s biographer (2008), sees his subject as “nervy” and “self-conscious”: “He was always trying to recreate the runaway success of Valse Triste [his beloved 1904 orchestral work].” So when it came to writing his fabled eighth symphony? “There was so much expectation riding on No 8 that he froze, and destroyed the score”. With Rossini, Rickards expects it was more about “tiredness at the operatic treadmill and the pressure from competitors”, along with both mental and physical health issues.\n\nBut what if physical or mental health do not put a stopper on creativity – but rather enhance it? It’s the question British conductor Charles Hazlewood asks in his 2021 documentary Beethoven and Me, which explores Hazlewood’s “knotty, lumpy, bloody, sweaty, at times, very distressing relationship” with Beethoven’s music.\n\nHazlewood sees, in Beethoven’s way of composing, evidence of the patterns of thought one develops after being abused. Beethoven was physically abused by his father; Hazlewood was sexually abused in childhood.\n\n“I’m not trying to say that Beethoven and I have the same abilities, of course I would not,” Hazlewood tells me. “But I can recognise some of his personality traits, what are academically called disorders.”\n\nBut rather than mental turmoil or unwellness being what suffocates creativity, Hazlewood believes “so much, fundamentally, of what made [Beethoven’s] music great was caused by these other so-called ‘disorders’, which were part and parcel of his makeup, I’m sure entirely as a result of what he experienced as a small child.\n\n“One of his signature compositional processes, for example, is to build something up, and build it, and build it, and build it, only in order to smash it down, and then to rebuild, and to smash it down, and then to rebuild. Now, these are behaviours which I recognise all too clearly.\n\n“If he hadn’t had those challenges, perhaps his art wouldn’t be so great,” says Hazlewood.\n\nIt’s a tightly biographical model of artistic production, and what fuels or forestalls it. But Golijov, instead, draws on the analogy of a faucet, with the gift for composition either turned on or off. Of his 2020 return, Golijov said: “For some reason – I always say, the faucet opened, and it’s flowing”. It chimes with what American composer Aaron Copland once said of his own hiatus (roughly 30 years): “It was exactly as if someone had simply turned off a faucet.”\n\nThere is nothing to be read into the pause, they say, no self-conscious perfectionism, no emotional or psychological trauma: the flow is either there, or not.\n\nJonathan Impett, director of research at the Orpheus Institute, suggests it’s a largely economic consideration: “The idea of not composing anymore depends on being able to eat when you’re not composing.” Certainly, Rossini had enough to retire in style, so did so. Copland had conducting to turn to, so he did.\n\nAs for Golijov? He missed deadlines, including a commission from the Metropolitan Opera. In 2012, the critic Tom Manoff and the trumpeter Brian McWhorter alleged that Golijov’s Sidereus was copied, extensively, from Michael Ward-Bergeman’s composition Barbeich. Golijov later stated that he had written it in collaboration with Ward-Bergeman for a film score, but the material had not been used, and he had been granted the American composer’s blessing.\n\nHe only returned, in 2020, to the compositional scene. Dean Keith Simonton, an American professor of the psychology of genius and creativity, muses on this “incomplete” case: “He’s still got many years left to turn things around. Yet his delinquency in fulfilling commissions and the accusations of plagiarism do not seem promising. Perhaps he has really dried up too.”\n\nLa Pasión según San Marcos will be performed at the Edinburgh International Festival on Aug 3 at Usher Hall at 8pm"
