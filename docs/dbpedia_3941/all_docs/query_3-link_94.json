        "text": "Cobbs Farm Shop, a multi-site business with a base and café on Englefield Estate between Theale and Pangbourne, has been listed among other finalists in Lloyds Banks’ Small to Medium-sized Business of the Year category for its 2024 British Business Excellence Awards.\n\nThe nomination recognises the small enterprise – founded in 2007 with other branches in Stratford, Winchester and Hungerford – for its “exceptional growth, innovative strategies and significant contributions to (local) communities”.\n\nIndeed, over the last 16 years, Cobbs has rocketed in size from a small start-up to a fully functional business employing over 180 staff across its sites.\n\nCEO Tom Newey credits this expansion to a number of factors, including “the hard work and dedication of the team, and commitment to delivering the highest quality of products and services (as well as) making a positive impact in the community”.\n\nHe described being nominated for the award, alongside several other “inspiring and talented” small to medium-sized businesses, as “an incredible honour”.\n\nREAD MORE: Historic thatched cottage hits the market for £1.5 million\n\nCobbs will find out whether it has beaten the competition to claim the prestigious prize in a ceremony at The Grosvenor Hotel in London on November 12.\n\nIf nothing else, as Tom is keen to stress, it will be an opportunity to mingle with “top entrepreneurs, industry leaders and community members to celebrate the achievements of small businesses across the country”.\n\nIf history is anything to go by, however, Cobbs has a pretty decent shot at coming out on top. Its history of award wins and shortlists include being named Large Retailer of the Year at the Speciality and Fine Food Awards in 2021 and as a finalist for Best Large Farm Shop at the Farm Shop and Deli Retailer Awards earlier this year.\n\nIt’s also no surprise that the independent business is currently enjoying something of a moment in the spotlight – recent visitors have given the Englefield branch a 4.4-star rating on Google, with reviews praising its “first-class service and tasty and locally sourced food” and one person describing it as a “great little hidden gem” just off junction 12 of the M4."
