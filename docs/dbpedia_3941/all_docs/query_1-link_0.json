        "text": "Club(s) Began as a junior footballer playing for Tippity Green Victoria FC, who played in the Cradley Heath League, and then for his works' team, Vono Works FC, members of the Birmingham & District Works FA. Had trials and appearances with Stourbridge FC, before being noticed and signed as a professional by Birmingham FC in March 1928. He gained Central League experience and made his first team League debut on 24 October 1931 against Middlesbrough FC. After becoming an ever-present, he broke his leg on 23 December 1933 (he was sandwiched by two opponents) against Huddersfield Town FC, keeping him out for ten months. Only earlier in December did Arsenal FC make overtures to sign him. He eventually completed a tally of 107 league appearances and scored seventeen goals. Moved on to Sheffield Wednesday FC on 13 February 1936 for a record transfer fee received for City, but made just 22 league appearances, scoring once, before joining Bolton Wanderers FC on 11 May 1937. Grosvenor made 53 league outings, including seven goals, before he retired during WWII, during which he guested for Walsall FC as early as November 1939, he was back at Birmingham City FC in January 1940 and helping Redditch FC shortly afterwards for the remainder of that season."
