        "text": "Billionaire landowner and philanthropist the Duke of Westminster has died aged 64, his family said.\n\nGerald Cavendish Grosvenor died at the Royal Preston Hospital in Lancashire on Tuesday after suddenly becoming ill on his Abbeystead Estate.\n\nThe duke's fortune was estimated at $10.8bn (Â£8.3bn) by Forbes magazine, making him the world's 68th richest person and the UK's third.\n\nA friend of the Royal Family, he became the sixth Duke of Westminster in 1979.\n\nHe had four children including his only son, Hugh Grosvenor, 25, who is heir to the dukedom and also Prince George's youngest godfather.\n\nGiving news of the duke's death, a spokeswoman said: \"His family are all aware and they ask for privacy and understanding at this very difficult time.\n\n\"No further comment will be made for the time being but further information will follow in due course.\"\n\nA Lancashire Police spokeswoman said officers were called at about 17:00 BST on Tuesday and made aware of the death of a 64-year-old man at Royal Preston Hospital.\n\n\"He was airlifted to hospital after he had been taken ill whilst walking in the Trough of Bowland. There are no suspicious circumstances and a file will be passed to the coroner,\" she added.\n\nAmong properties across the UK, he owned 190 acres in Belgravia, an area near to Buckingham Palace, and one of London's most expensive districts.\n\nA Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: \"I can confirm that Her Majesty the Queen is aware of the news about the Duke of Westminster.\n\n\"A private message of condolence is being sent by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.\"\n\nThe Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were \"deeply shocked and greatly saddened\" by the sudden death of their friend the Duke of Westminster, a Clarence House spokeswoman said.\n\nThe Grosvenor family accrued much of their London wealth through the marriage of Sir Thomas Grosvenor to the heiress Mary Davies in 1677.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, external she brought Grosvenor \"the estates which would become the cornerstone of the family's later wealth\".\n\nThe estates were described as Ebury farm, east of Chelsea, and a large holding between Tyburn Brook and Park Lane in central London. Today these are part of the wealthy Belgravia and Mayfair districts.\n\nThe duke was born in Omagh and spent his early years in Northern Ireland.\n\nHe was educated at Harrow School, where he gained two O-levels, but once said that \"academic studies came very low down on the list of priorities... games were very much my first priority\".\n\nThe duke even had trials at Fulham FC, but his father is said to have disapproved of football as a career choice for an aristocrat.\n\nThe duke credited himself with using his wealth responsibly and gave financial support to both rural and inner-city areas with links to his estate.\n\nThe Westminster Foundation, which manages the estate's charitable giving, has donated to more than 1,500 charitable organisations since 1974. The Duke was also president of the Royal National Institute of Blind People for 25 years and president of the St John Ambulance for 10 years.\n\nIn an appearance on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 1995, the duke's favourite track was Albatross by Fleetwood Mac and his luxury item was a telescope."
