        "text": "Stourbridge were founded in 1876 and were originally known as Stourbridge Standard with a nickname of \"The Glassboys\" (reflecting the town's connection with the Cut Glass industry), and play in red & white stripes on the front of their shirts.\n\nThey played in the Southern Leagues between 1971 and 2000, and then from 00/01 they spent the following seven seasons in the Midland Alliance. In 2006/7 they rejoined the Southern League in the Midlands Division and in the following 07â€“08 season saw them seal a third place finish to reach the play-offs and eventually gain promotion and a return to the SLP.\n\nIn 2008/09 after a difficult start to their return to the SLP (which saw them lie in and around the foot of the table), they eventually acclimatized to life at the higher level securing another season in the Premier Division with a final placing of 16th. In 2009/10 some excellent results in the second half of the campaign saw Stourbridge finish in 9th place and in 2010/11 they finished 8th.\n\nLast season Stourbridge reached the First Round Proper of the F A Cup for the second time in three seasons and after a 3-3 draw away at Plymouth Argyle, a crowd of 2,519 saw the Glassboys defeat the Devon club 2-0 at home. The run was finally ended by League One side Stevenage who won 3-0 at Stourbridge in-front of an attendance of 3,067. In the SLP only 1-1 draw at Frome Town in their final fixture saw them just miss out on the play-offs by GD.\n\nSince gaining promotion to the SLP Stourbridge's ave home league attendance has risen year on year from 250 to the current 450. They currently lie in 4th place with a record of W6/D2/L3 and have lost their last 2 league games at home to St Neots and away to Bedford Town."
