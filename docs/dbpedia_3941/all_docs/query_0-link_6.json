        "text": "Team: Evans, Webb, Ford, Frost, Brookes, Broadhurst, Heath, Bastable, Bellingham, Taylor, Rogers\n\nSubs: Field (for Heath), A. Wright (for Bellingham), Brown (for Taylor), Hackett, O' Malley (not used)\n\nReferee: Mr. A. Hendley (Halesowen)\n\nThe Glassboys stretched their unbeaten run to five games and progressed into the next round of this competition with a hard earned victory at fellow MFA side, Boldmere. The final scoreline did flatter Stour as they certainly rode their luck at times, but some dogged defending, particularly early in the second period, and their sharper finishing at the other end proved the difference.\n\nThe match started at a breathtaking pace and inside the opening minute, the Mikes had a penalty shout waved away after Callum Gittings went down under a challenge. With eight minutes played, Stourbridge should have taken the lead. Bellingham and Rob Taylor combined initially to bring Jamie Rogers in to play down the right and his telling cross picked out an unmarked Rob Taylor in the middle who sent a downward header the wrong side of the post. Eight minutes later the Glassboys again went close. A free- kick from Ford dropped to Jamie Rogers, just outside the box. His first effort was blocked, but the ball rebounded to him and his second shot flew just wide. The Mikes then began to gain the upper hand and on 18 minutes a right-wing cross from Gittings was met on the volley by Kevin Charley who forced an outstanding reflex save from Stour custodian Paul Evans. Two minutes later, the lively Mykel Beckley, who proved to be a constant threat, got in behind the Glassboys defence, but wastefully screwed his shot off- target. Just before the half- hour mark, Beckley again used his pace to good effect to cut in from the left and beat at least two defenders before cracking in a shot that Evans could only parry down before the ball was cleared to safety. Having come through that tricky period, Stourbridge hit back well to forge into the lead after 38 minutes. Jamie Rogers burst forward through the middle and threaded a diagonal ball forward into the path of Leon Broadhurst and he drilled a fine low shot past Robert Clarke in the Mikes goal. Four minutes later however, the hosts had a great chance to level after winning a penalty. Beckley again produced a strong run to unsettle the Stour defence before slipping the ball out to Gittings in some room on the right. His ball in was adjudged to have been handled by Brookes inside the penalty area to win a spot- kick for the Mikes. Kevin Charley stepped up to take the penalty and duly blazed the ball over the bar.\n\nBoldmere started the second half strongly as they tried to overturn the deficit and as the Glassboys came under increasing pressure, they had to defend well with some vital blocks keeping the home side at bay. Ex- Glassboy Stuart Grosvenor though might have done better on 54 minutes when a corner from the right fell to him at the back of the area, but he lifted his shot over the bar. The Mikes also squandered another good chance after 65 minutes when Charley squared the ball inside to Tim Gould, who fired his shot over the bar. Boldmere paid the price for failing to capitalise on their pressure three minutes later as Stourbridge extended their lead. A deep right-wing corner from Bastable saw Jon Ford get in a powerful header that Clarke could only parry and Mark Bellingham tucked home the rebound to put the visitors in the driving seat. The threat from the home side diminished after that, but in chasing the game they left gaps at the back and four minutes from time the Glassboys snatched a third goal. A goal- kick from Paul Evans was picked up by Rob Taylor on the left hand touchline and he got the better of Tom Bayley before cutting inside into the box. To rather underline that it was 'Stourbridge's night', his miscued shot completely fooled Clarke and trickled over the line to complete the scoring and book their place in the last 16."
