We may miss a few, so if any of you see any we may have missed, tag us on Facebook or Twitter (or X), or leave a comment below and we’ll add them in the next week’s round-up!\n\nQuite a few ex-Glovers on the move this week, with a couple from last season’s squad involved. Zac Bell has joined fellow National League side Maidenhead United following his release from Bristol City, while another right back from last season, Brooklyn Genisi… yep, think that’s how it’s spelled… has joined W*ymouth following his release from Swindon Town. Best of luck to both Bell and Genisi… yep, still think that’s it.\n\nA few more moves from up and down the football pyramid, as Jordan Dyer moves further south, joining Jay Foulston at Torquay United following a couple of seasons under Jerry Gill at Bath City.

Finally, a name more familiar to recent Yeovil years is Jordan Barnett, who has tumbled down the pyramid in recent seasons. He leaves Shaftesbury, and joins Abbey Hey, who recently won promotion from the North West Counties League Division One South… Step 10 in English football.\n\nA man who hasn’t got a new club, but has been seen out and about, is Asmir Begovic, the experienced ‘keeper was spotted in training with Aldershot Town this week keeping fit for the season ahead.\n\nAll Transfers\n\nAFC Fylde\n\nOne new face for Fylde this week, as the club announced the signing of forward Charlie Jolley from Tranmere Rovers.
