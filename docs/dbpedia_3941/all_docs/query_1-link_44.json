        "text": "I decided that after my last save on FM22, not self-destructed itself but also self-destructed the game itself (I am unable to play FM22 at the moment and a fair bit of time with SEGA Support has yet to yield any results), that I will go back to FM21 and do another save, despite my mourning my last save and the inoperability of my copy of FM22.\n\nThis one I am calling Generational Manager since the goal is to have a string of managers that play different styles and see what they ultimately achieve.\n\nAs always with my saves there are self-imposed rules and this one is no different, but they are not as crazy as my Climb the Ladder Challenge which executes computers, the game it is played on, the computers those games are played on and possibly the world if a Higgs-Boson hits the computer RAM just right.\n\nThe rules of this challenge will come from a simple principle. I will play with an avatar that represents me, he will start his management career with no badges and no experience and will start at the closest club in the English pyramid to where I hail from. The main rule will be that I will in the background be tracking things like money, expenses and things like that and I will be required to make decisions around my career that I would logically make, which in football would mostly revolve around money, and opportunities once money is not really that important anymore.\n\nAdded to this, I will also only have responsibilities for the things in football that a manager would logically have control of. I am not sure that most managers actually have control of things like transfers, they probably aren’t qualified to hire the physios or scouts. So, with that end this challenge will have a severe element of the Director of Football tagged onto it.\n\nFULL SYNOPSIS OF THE RULES\n\nTHE MANAGER\n\n·Manager must start with no experience or badges and manage the most local club to me.\n\n·I must track my finances and make decisions based on that and following that on the Maslow hierarchy of needs, opportunity, glory or whatever else.\n\n·When it comes to money I must treat it like a real job, sometimes wanting security, always wanting more money, instituting clauses where I can get more money.\n\n·I will also judge the club based on what they offer me, and there is the possibility of a stalemate on contracts if I were to feel that I am worth more or am being disrespected\n\n·If I am ever in a rolling contract then I will resign since that is what would likely happen in the football world\n\n·I must pick three tactics which I will use for the entirety of that managers career. I am allowed to amend a few roles and change the tactic for situation dependent scenarios but ostensibly I will play with a set style of play.\n\nROLES AND RESPONSIBILTIES\n\nI must hand over control of several elements of the running of the club to the people that are responsible for carrying out this function.\n\n·The Director of Football is responsible for making all signings and selling all players.\n\n·I will have a veto on a player sale if I really deem it absolutely essential. This veto will not be in force if the club are ever in debt by 50% or more of their revenue at any given point. Or where the projection shows the club going into a steady financial decline, at that point I will no longer be allowed to veto player sales\n\n·I am not responsible for carrying out the hiring of anyone that I would logically not be involved with employing, i.e., the Director of Football or Chief Scout will hire scouts, the Head of Sports Science will Hire Sports Scientists and the Head Physio will hire physios. If none of these people are in place, then a Technical Director or Director of Football will carry out this function.\n\n·The Head of Youth Development is hired by the Director of Football, as would be a loan manager.\n\n·I am responsible for hiring the First Team coaches, and the U23 and Youth Team Manager. However, the Youth Team Manager and U23 manager are then responsible for building their teams and the Technical Director and Director of Football are responsible for their contract renegotiations.\n\n·I can ask the Director of Football to renew the contracts of my direct staff, but he must do the negotiation not myself. If they don’t want to sign, then they will leave.\n\n·I am not responsible at all for player contracts. If the Director of Football does not renew a contract, then that is his choice.\n\n·To hire any staff, I must conduct put out an advert and the respondents and the respondents to that are essential those available for interview.\n\n·I am allowed however to headhunt anyone I have previously worked with, if I feel they are who I want.\n\n·I am not at all involved in Scouting, the meetings are run by the Director of Football or Chief Scout, and they report into the Director of Football who is responsible for player signings.\n\n·I can place players on the transfer list if I do not want them.\n\n·In very limited cases where we are lacking in a position, I can use the Director of Football recommendation for a position and would need to ask him to go after a transfer target. But I will only do this when there is an imbalance in the team that needs sorting out. If he has no recommendation, then it is tough for me.\n\n·I am responsible for training of the first team, but I am not allowed to run the training for the U23s or the U18s.\n\nLONG TERM OF THE GAME\n\n·My manager will retire at some stage when most managers would normally retire and then I will continue with a new manager, likely a son or daughter of the subsequent manager until we have a dynasty of managers each after the other with hopefully some very interesting stories to tell.\n\nUPDATE FREQUENCY\n\nI think with this one I will probably update monthly and maybe the odd update for important games and finals and that kind of thing.\n\nLEAGUES LOADED\n\nSo, for this it will be a Europe only save. I will load the top 7 leagues by coefficient. From the start of the game these will be in order of the coefficients in the game; Spain, England, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, Russia and 3 Wildcards which are completely randomly picked from all available European nations. Every 5 years in the middle of the decade and start of the decade will reassess the coefficients and redraw the nations. Nations can repeat if pick either as a coefficient nation or wildcard nation every 5 years. There is no cooldown as such.\n\nIf we are managing in a wildcard nation, they become frozen nation until such time as we leave the nation.\n\nEvery league will be loaded in at least view only and the above applies for playable nations.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNext up will be an introduction to the manager, the tactical philosophies and the team we will be starting with., as well as learning what leagues have been loaded in wildcard slots to start with.\n\nThis is Joao Terminale, born in England with Portuguese heritage. Although he is very inexperienced, the main thing he appreciates is attacking football, hence he has some aptitude in the attacking phase of the game but really very little else going for him as a manager. At 34 years old he is a young manager looking to make his way in the game.\n\nTACTICAL PHILOSOPHIES\n\nAs mentioned each manager will have three different tactical styles that he will look to deploy across his career.\n\nThe 4-5-1 is perhaps one of Joao's favourites. A very dependable formation, looking to pass the ball short and relying on the midfield to create the opening in the defence. The strike will look to be the point of the lance with the wingers, cutting inside to varying degree allowing the wingbacks to overlap. The tempo is high as it looks to mimic a counter pressing style that looks to win the ball back high up the pitch but also spring counter attacks where possible via the wings.\n\nThis is the second tactic and will look to deploy the inverted wing backs to essentially act as midfielders out of possession but look to become driving inside threats. The tactic looks to segment the midfield into different roles, with the wingers a bit further back to provide more defensive stability and acting to support attacks. This time around there are two up front and a traditional number 10 to hit the half spaces. Again we are looking at playing at a very high tempo looking to strike at the opposition and give them no time on the ball, while attacking ourselves at pace.\n\nPerhaps the final stage of a Joao Terminale tactic might dispense with the strikers all together and instead operate with deep threats from shadow strikers that contribute to the build up but look to run into the box and create havoc late. Again the midfield acts as support for the front men and the wingers are again inverted in order to add even further support to attacks but cover defensively. This time around we have a dedicated midfielder to defend although he is support duty, with so many men in the midfield we should dominate the ball and create chances with through balls and smart counter attacks.\n\nExcerpt from Wikipedia\n\nWealdstone Football Club is an English semi-professional football club based in Ruislip, London Borough of Hillingdon, and affiliated to the Middlesex County Football Association. They currently play in the National League, the fifth tier of English football, having been promoted as champions of the National League South for the 2019-20 season. While established in 1899, it has roots dating to 1887 and was created through a series of local mergers in Wealdstone, then in Middlesex. For most of its existence the club was based at Lower Mead stadium in Harrow, until 1991. After a long period of homelessness and ground sharing with various local clubs, since 2008 they have been based at Grosvenor Vale. Their traditional colours are royal blue and white, and they are nicknamed \"The Stones\" or \"The Royals\".\n\nThe club were the first to achieve the famed non-league 'double', winning both the FA Trophy and the Alliance Premier League (now the National League) in the same season (1984–85). The latter happened two years before automatic promotions to the Football League began; Wealdstone has never been a member of the Football League so far. The club also have the distinction of appearing in the first ever football match to be televised in the UK, when the BBC showed part of their league match against rivals Barnet in October 1946.\n\nThe Early Years\n\nThe club was formed at the start of the 1899–1900 season, joining Division Two of the Willesden & District League. A previous \"Wealdstone F.C.\" existed, for workers at a local gunsmith in Wealdstone, a Middlesex village to the north of Harrow Hill - itself has its origins in a club called The Oaks. An article published by the Harrow Observer states that the Wealdstone football club formed in about 1890, playing home games in a field in Hindes Road (present-day Harrow) and meeting at the Railway Hotel, close to Harrow and Wealdstone station. This club merged into another local club called Harrow Athletic F.C. in September 1894, while other clubs bearing the Wealdstone name soon formed. The present Wealdstone F.C. formed in 1899 as Wealdstone Albion, a merger of Wealdstone Rovers and Wealdstone Juniors and using the same blue and white striped colours of the old Wealdstone F.C. - the Albion name was soon dropped. At this time their home turf was a field between Headstone Drive and Marlborough Hill, Wealdstone.\n\nTheir first game was a friendly match on 7 October 1899 against Northwood, which they won 6–1. They were promoted to the league's Division One for the 1900–01 season after Division Two was scrapped. In 1903 they moved to the College Farm Ground in Locket Road, Wealdstone, and soon after another nearby ground in what is now Byron Park. In 1905–06 the club won Division One, but on 20 October 1906 a notice was posted in the local newspaper stating that the club was to be disbanded due to 'a lack of interest' from players and supporters.\n\nThe club was soon reformed in time for the 1908–09 season, rejoining Division One of the Willesden & District League. In 1910 they moved to Belmont Road, and won Division One again in 1912–13. Following World War I the club joined the London League and the Middlesex Senior League.\n\nAt the start of the 1922–23 season, Wealdstone F.C. switched to the Spartan League and at the same time moved south to a ground called Lower Mead in what is now central Harrow; this would become the permanent home ground of the club for 69 years. The club had their record win on 13 October 1923, beating the 12th London Regiment 22–0 in an FA Amateur Cup game.\n\nThe Athenian League Years\n\nIn 1928–29 they switched leagues again, this time joining the Athenian League. In 1929–30 the club won the Middlesex Senior Cup and the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup for the first time. On Saturday 16 November 1929, Wealdstone played Dulwich Hamlet in the FA Cup Fourth Qualifying Round, with the match ending in a record-breaking 7–7 draw; there has never been a 7–7 scoreline in any other FA Cup match before or since, and none either in the top four divisions of the League Pyramid (including play-offs), the League Cup, League Trophy, FA Community Shield, FA Trophy or FA Vase. Four days later, Dulwich won the replay 2–1.\n\nDuring World War II the club continued to play, playing at Wembley Stadium in the final of the Middlesex Senior Red Cross Cup in 1942. In December 1944, they recorded their heaviest defeat ever, losing 14–0 to Edgware Town in the London Senior Cup. In 1946 the BBC showed part of Wealdstone's Athenian League match at Barnet, the first time a live match had been televised. The club also appeared in the BBC's first two live FA Cup match broadcasts, with their games against Edgware Town in the third qualifying round and Colchester United in the fourth qualifying round being shown on television during the 1949–50 season. After beating Colchester, Wealdstone reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 1–0 to Port Vale.\n\nIn 1951–52 the club won the Athenian League, and went on to win the Middlesex Senior Cup in 1959, 1963 and 1964.\n\nAmateur Cup win and turning professional\n\nIn 1964 they switched to the Isthmian League. In 1965–66 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 3–1 at Millwall, but went on to win the FA Amateur Cup, beating local rivals Hendon 3–1 in the final. The following season saw Wealdstone entered at the first round of the FA Cup, losing 2–0 at home to Nuneaton Borough.\n\nThe club joined the Division One North of the Southern League in 1971, turning professional. They were moved to Division One South the following season, and won the division in 1973–74, earning promotion to the Premier Division. In 1977–78 Wealdstone progressed beyond the first round of the FA Cup for the first time; after beating Third Division Hereford United 3–2 at Edgar Street in a first round replay, they went on to defeat Fourth Division Reading 2–1 at home in the second round, before losing 4–0 at First Division Queens Park Rangers in the third round.\n\nConference and non-league double\n\nIn 1979 the club were founder members of the Alliance Premier League, the new national top division of non-League football. After finishing 19th in 1980–81 they were relegated back to the Southern League, but then made an immediate return after winning the South Division of the Southern League the following season; a play-off ensued against Midland Division champions Nuneaton, with Wealdstone winning on penalties after winning the home leg 2–1 and losing 1–0 away. Wealdstone's return to the Alliance Premier League was much more positive than their first stint, finishing 3rd in 1982–83, and then 4th the following season.\n\nIn 1984–85 the club had its most successful season to date. Under the management of Brian Hall, Wealdstone won both the Alliance Premier League and also the FA Trophy, beating Boston United 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium. This was first ever occasion that the non-league \"double\" had been achieved by any team. However, in spite of this Wealdstone were not promoted to the English Football League. Automatic promotion from the Alliance Premier League would not be introduced until two years later, and Lower Mead was not deemed to meet Football League requirements, so the club was not eligible to apply for election.\n\nFollowing the double, a period of sharp decline soon set in; after finishing tenth the season after with an aging team, they finished 19th in 1986–87, and were eventually relegated at the end of the following season.\n\nDecline and ground loss\n\nBy the end of the 1990–91 season financial problems caused by boardroom impropriety were seriously exacerbated by the owner selling the club's Lower Mead ground for commercial development, for which the club, after protracted legal wranglings, received only a very small share of the sale proceeds. They then signed up to an expensive ground sharing arrangement at Watford's Vicarage Road, and at the end of the 1991–92 season the club were relegated again, dropping from the Southern League Premier Division into the Southern League South Division.\n\nSeeking to reduce expenditure, in 1993 the club began a two-season ground sharing agreement at The Warren, Yeading's ground. In June 1995, with the club in administration and only having two players to its name, Gordon Bartlett was appointed manager. Later that year, Wealdstone re-joined the Isthmian League in order to further reduce their travelling expenses, having to agree to drop a level into Division Three in the process, and yet again they moved grounds, this time beginning a ground share with Edgware Town at their White Lion ground that was to last ten years.\n\nAfter winning the Isthmian League Division Three in 1996–97, they finished second in Division Two in 1997–98 and were promoted again, this time to Division One. However, after having finished third in Division One in the 1998–99, the Isthmian League then denied the club promotion to the Premier Division after required ground improvements at the White Lion ground were not completed until six days after a specified deadline.\n\nHome search and recovery\n\nThe club attempted to redevelop the local disused Prince Edward Playing Fields at Canons Park, owned by the London Borough of Harrow, into a new home ground. Construction of the new stadium started in 2003 but, when over 30% completed, building work was suddenly halted in April 2004 when the private company who were co-financing the project in partnership with the club went into insolvency. Unable to afford to complete the new stadium on their own, Wealdstone were forced to leave the site unfinished for two years, until Harrow Council, frustrated that the site was still unused and falling into disrepair, eventually sold the site lease to Barnet F.C., who used it as a training centre before later moving permanently into what became The Hive Stadium in 2013.\n\nIn 2004 Wealdstone were promoted to the Isthmian League Premier Division as a result of the creation of the Conference North and South. The club faced Dulwich Hamlet in the playoff final, with the game finishing 2-2 before Wealdstone won 5-4 on penalties. The club's first two seasons at Premier Division level saw them steer clear of relegation, with back to back 18th placed finishes. Off the pitch, the club began a further new groundshare arrangement in 2005, this time moving to Northwood's Chestnut Avenue ground. In 2006 they were switched under FA reorganisation to the Southern League Premier Division for a single season, before returning to the Isthmian League the following season.\n\nIn January 2008, Wealdstone acquired Ruislip Sports and Social club and the associated lease at Ruislip Manor's Grosvenor Vale ground, starting the 2008-09 season there. With the ground share agreement at Northwood coming to an end and still no specific completion date in sight for the club's Prince Edward Playing Field project, Wealdstone instead decided to invest in the Grosvenor Vale stadium to upgrade the playing facilities as a priority, in order to meet the necessary ground grading requirements to play Isthmian League Premier Division football in the 2008–09 season. The club's first 3 seasons at the Vale saw the club fail to reach the playoffs, finishing 7th, 6th and then 12th. They did however reach the first round of the FA Cup in 2009-10, where they lost 3-2 at home to Rotherham United\n\n2011–12 saw Wealdstone embark on a run the FA Trophy which saw them reach the semi-final and knock out three teams from higher divisions. A 2-1 win at home to Conference side Barrow and a 1-0 win in a replay against Dartford of the Conference South set up a quarter-final away at Cambridge United which Wealdstone won 2-1 thanks to a Richard Jolly brace, before eventually losing 3–1 on aggregate to Newport County in the semi-final. They also reached the promotion play-offs in the Isthmian Premier Division that year, but lost 2–1 to Lowestoft Town in the semi-finals. The following season saw them losing in the play-off semi-finals again, this time losing 2-1 against Concord Rangers. However, in 2013–14 did win promotion as league champions, with their promotion to the Conference South being secured with a 1-0 win away to Margate.\n\nWealdstone did not win any of their first 9 games in the Conference South, with the run ended by a 1-0 victory away to Whitehawk. An upturn in form meant that they finished the 2014-15 season in 12th place, and they would go on to finish 13th the following season. The summer of 2016 saw the club change ownership when Peter Marsden, previously chairman of Accrington Stanley, took over the club in late July. The 2016-17 season saw Wealdstone experience a greater degree of success on the pitch, with the club pushing for the playoffs. However, their hopes were dashed when it was announced that they would be ineligible to compete in the playoffs due to missing the cut off point to meet ground grading requirements. Wealdstone's eventual 8th placed finish would not have seen them compete regardless.\n\nOn 21 August 2017, Gordon Bartlett stepped down as Wealdstone manager after 22 years. A day later, Bobby Wilkinson, formerly of Hungerford Town, was appointed manager. Wilkinson's first season at Wealdstone ended an unremarkable 11th-placed finish in the league, although the club reached the semi-final of the FA Trophy, where they lost 3–0 on aggregate to eventual winners Brackley. In January 2019, chairman Peter Marsden was voted out of his position, and replaced by Rory Fitzgerald. On the final day of the 2018–19 season, Wealdstone rose from 10th to 7th on with a 2–1 win over Hemel Hempstead to ensure a place in the playoffs. Wealdstone began their playoff campaign with a win away at Bath to secure a semi-final against Woking, which Wealdstone narrowly lost 3–2. Wilkinson subsequently left the club at the end of the season.\n\nNational League\n\nOn 21 May 2019 Dean Brennan was appointed as new manager. 10 wins in the first 11 games of the 2019–20 season saw Wealdstone rise to the top of the league. On 26 March 2020 the season was suspended due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, with Wealdstone still top of the league. On 17 June it was confirmed that the club were to be promoted to the National League as champions of the National League South, on the basis of points won per game.\n\nClub Crest\n\nhe club's crest first appeared on team shirts in the 1960s. It contains four quarters representing the traditional colours of the club (royal blue and white); the \"Three Lions\" representing England; a football representing the club's sport; and the emblem of Middlesex, the historic county of the London Borough of Harrow where the club is from.\n\nRivalries\n\nWealdstone's main rivals are often considered to be Barnet. The clubs were both founding members of the Alliance Premier League and played each other regularly throughout the 1980s, although games were rarely played after that with the clubs being in different divisions. The rivalry came back to prominence when Barnet moved into The Hive Stadium which was initially meant for Wealdstone. The two clubs do now play in the same division. Other rivals have included Harrow Borough (with whom the \"Harrow Derby\" is contested), Enfield, and Hendon, with Wealdstone beating the latter in the 1966 Amateur Cup final.\n\nNotable Former Players\n\nThe club's all-time leading goalscorer is George Duck. Duck scored 251 goals for Wealdstone in 370 appearances between 1972 and 1979, and additionally set unmatched scoring records for penalties and hat-tricks. In every season he played for the club Duck was top scorer in league and cup competitions.\n\nAmongst former players who have gone on to notable careers at the highest level of professional football are Stuart Pearce, Vinnie Jones and Jermaine Beckford. Harold Smith was the first ever player to leave Wealdstone FC for a professional career, joining Notts County in 1930.\n\nHonours\n\nClub Finances\n\nStaff\n\nSquad\n\nFive Key Players\n\n18. Alex Dyer - Probably the most gifted player at the club, and can play quite a few positions including central midifield and attacking midfield, and passable at right back, although better as a more advanced wingback. He should be a key player for us this coming season. He was born in Sweden and has played all over the place, from Sweden to Kuwait. He also has 13 caps for his country Montserrat.\n\n24. Josh Meekings - Likely to be our main centre-back this season, although he is also very good at right back (his natural position). So he may be playing both positions this season. He was an Ipswich Town graduate, before spending the majority of his career in Scottish football at Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Dundee.\n\n28. Matt Lench - Another very versatile midfielder that can play anywhere in midfield and even on the wing. He started his career at Chesham United and has been a non-league stalwart all his career.\n\n4. Ashley Charles - Another central midfielder with a lot to offer in the centre of the park. He started his career at Watford before eventually being released and finding his way over to us. He also had a short spell on loan at rivals Barnet.\n\n14. Danny Parish - This guy should be man up front for us this year. I certainly feel he has a nose for the goal and we will look to take advantage of his natural finishing. Danny started his career at Brentford, before passing through a host of non-league clubs before finding his way here.\n\nOur Contract\n\nAs mentioned, managing money will be a part of this game so our first contract with Wealdstone sees us on £775 per week, which is £575 per week net. That is equivalent to just under £30,000 per annum. Not exactly a king's ransom, but not bad either.\n\nEdited April 28, 2022 by TerminalPortugal\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nTransfers\n\nEven before we could get a Director of Football in, the owner decided to agree a deal with Dartford to allow Michael Phillips to leave the club on loan. They are covering the majority of his wages and he was unlikely to get a huge amount of game time.\n\nEventually we did manage to secure a Director of Football, which the owner interviewed and hired. His name is George Morgan, and at this level of football he seems decent enough. Hopefully he makes decent enough moves for us with regards to the playing staff. My first appointment at the club was to bring a Fitness Coach to be part of my very small team together with Assistant Manager Stuart Maynard. Ben Nicholson joins us, having previously been at Bradford City before being released.\n\nIn another piece of staff business, the newly appointed Director of Football brought in Josh Smith as Chief Scout, and he has since been searching for an additional scout but not secured anyone as yet.\n\nPart of my remit is the whole of the First Team coaching staff and part of that is also the performance analysis side. We really only have room for one analyst so we brought in Tom Warner as Head of Performance Analysis, if the club evolves an there is further need he will be responsible for expanding his team. For now he will be providing back reports on how we are performing on the pitch against the rest of the league.\n\nTowards the end of the month the Director of Football eventually brought in a pretty good signing I would say in the form of Dean Ager. He fits our tactics pretty well, predominantly operating off the right wing or in behind the striker, he has plenty of quality and that is definitely a useful signing for us. Dean previously failed to make the grade at Colchester United.\n\nRight at the end of the month we were looking to fill in the Under 23 and Under 18 Manager posts. Responding to advertisement was Marc Richards previously manager at Hereford United and for me the best candidate available. Added to that in the post of Under 18 Manager was Justin Luchford, who had previously been a coach at Tonbridge Angels. It is probably a decentish step up for Justin, in his first managerial role of any kind, and I am keen to see what he can do with the kids.\n\nDirector of Football George Morgan decided to agree the loan departure of Jacob Mendy to St Albans City for approximately £1.3k in loan fees. Again he was another peripheral player looking for game time, so not the worst piece of business. Finally Justin Luchford and Head of Youth Development Matthew Saunders successful brought in an understudy for Justin in Under 18 Assistant Manager Jody Brown, previously a coach at Dagenham & Redbridge and seems reasonable enough. Hopefully they make a good duo.\n\nOn the final day of the month, the Director of Football managed to agree a deal with Nottingham Forest to bring a bright young talent Ethan Dekel-Daks in on loan for about £1.6k loan fee. I honestly think he is a really prestigious talent for us this season. I can see him really having a good season from central midfield, and we already have a lot of good options there so it might allow me to deploy the likes of Alex Dyer and Matt Lench elsewhere. Certainly a good capture for the George.\n\nResults\n\nSeptember was a month for friendlies and I must say I am very happy with the results and performances from the boys this month. We alternated between the 4-5-1 and the Diamond in games and the 4-5-1 seemed to have the better results and so it may well be our go to at the start of the season.\n\nWe started off the month at Bedford and beat them handsomely 5-0 with goals from Charles, Emmanuel, Parish, Smith and Slew to cap off a wonderful performance. Next we went to Aveley, and it was a tight one, as Slew gave us the lead before we were pegged back but Green gave us the winner late in the game to keep our perfect start to the pre-season. Then we went across to Peterborough Sports and we managed another big win 5-0. Cawley and Charles gave us a 2-0 lead, before Oluwu added two goals and Slew one in the final few minutes to flatter us a bit.\n\nThen we had our first game at Grosvenor Vale up against Alfreton Town, Green gave us an early lead and Hughes made it safe late on to win 2-0. Finally we came to our final game of the month where we faced Stourbridge at the War Memorial Ground. A sharp start put us 2-0 up Dyer grabbing both goals, before they pulled one back only a few minutes later. However Meekings had other ideas a struck 7 minutes later to give us a 3-1 lead into half time. Oluwu then grabbed another in the second half to give us a 4-1 on the day.\n\nManager Thoughts\n\nA good start to life with Wealdstone as we pick up a perfect pre-season record, as we now go into the league season. We play Eastleigh in our first game at the start of October and it will be a busy month as the schedule in the National League is pretty relentless. On a negative note, while we were able to get our Assistant Manager Stuart Maynard on a course for his next coaching badge, the board decided against allowing us to get our National C Licence. I have been told the decision will be open for review in 6 or so months time.\n\nManager Bank Balance\n\n£1,444.10\n\nI started with £500 and over the three months and from July to September we have managed to increase this balance, but it is a pretty basic life.\n\nEdited April 28, 2022 by TerminalPortugal"
