        "text": "Notes\n\nThe House of Commons Register of Members' Financial Interests is published twice a month as plain text. As the Parliament website now uses CloudFlare it isn't easy to automatically get the Register from there so we use an extract provided by TheyWorkForYou. As interests stay on the register for 12 months after the interest has ended, the time period covered for each MP may differ.\n\nWe have automatically parsed the text and extracted common patterns such as currency values, dates, company numbers etc to create more structured data as a JSON file. As we are automatically parsing text that is relatively free-form, there may be errors, mistakes, or omissions especially if an MP's submission had unusual formatting. Trying to deal with all the ways MPs write earnings values with time periods is not easy - the ones who just give a total and \"Hours: 5 hrs\" are the easiest but some some write complicated natural language such as \"£4,500 every three months for a quarterly commitment of 12 hours\" which is quite a bit harder to reliably extract. Some MPs list multiple currency values in a item. If they explicitly say \"total value Â£X\" we'll just use that value for the item but otherwise we add up the individual values. That may mean that some totals contain double accounting where an MP has, for whatever reason, decided to also list part of the total with some explanatory text e.g. Clive Lewis (April 2022) has an entry that reads \"Â£15,000 loan for house purchase, at preferential rates, from June 2019 to 30 June 2020 (date of repayment); estimated discount Â£217.50\" and if he'd said \"total value Â£15,000\" we'd have been able to extract it correctly.\n\nThere are some things that we'd consider as mistakes in the source data. For example, at least one entry uses a comma instead of a decimal point in a currency and several entries (April 2022) give wrong (as in, the name doesn't match the name on Companies House for the same number) company numbers in places. It is best to double-check any results given here against the actual register entry. The Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards are not able to \"fix\" anything in the register as it is a register of Members interests so it is down to individual MPs as to what they put. The staff in Parliament aren't even allowed to provide validation for MPs prior to submitting. Improvements to the collection of the RMFI data will require MPs to actively authorise any changes.\n\nFor shareholdings, Edward Betts has an interesting list of members shareholdings which attempts to connect with their Companies House records to find out more about the nature of their control.\n\nProcessed data\n\nWe store our automatically-processed version of various releases of the RMFI as JSON files. Note that they use attempts at natural-language-processing (described above) so may have errors and double accounting where MPs have made it hard to parse. They are provided for interest.\n\n8 January 2024\n\n27 November 2023\n\n16 October 2023\n\n18 September 2023\n\n7 August 2023\n\n12 June 2023\n\n15 May 2023\n\n20 February 2023\n\n9 January 2023\n\n12 December 2022\n\n14 November 2022\n\n17 October 2022\n\n3 October 2022\n\n5 September 2022\n\n8 August 2022\n\n11 July 2022\n\n13 June 2022\n\n3 May 2022\n\n19 April 2022\n\nCredits\n\nData from the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards released under the Open Parliament Licence."
