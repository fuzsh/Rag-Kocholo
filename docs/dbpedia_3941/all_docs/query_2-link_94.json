        "text": "The Ride For Justice, which saw more than 300 bikers descend on Stourbridge and a Cradley pub on Saturday August 3, has been hailed the biggest yet.\n\nThe motorcyclists did laps around the ring road before riding down Stourbridge High Street to pay their respects outside the former Chicago’s bar where Ryan had been on a night out with friends when he was stabbed to death seven years ago.\n\nThe popular footballer, who played midfield for Wren’s Nest FC, lost his life, aged just 24, on August 6 2017, after being knifed in the chest as a fight broke out.\n\nMarking the anniversary of the tragedy and highlighting the ongoing Justice For Ryan campaign – the annual ride out has become a big event for Ryan’s family, supporters and the community in Stourbridge.\n\nAfter cruising through the town, the motorcyclists rode out to the Quatt Café in Bridgnorth and back to The Widders Pub in Cradley where a family fun day was organised by landlord and supporter John Hill.\n\nSo far, it’s estimated the event has raised around £4,500 for the Justice For Ryan campaign but funds are still coming in.\n\nThe Justice For Ryan team took to Facebook afterwards to say “a massive heartfelt thank you to everyone that turned up to support our Ride For Justice”.\n\nJason Connon, spokesperson for the campaign, added: “It was absolutely amazing.\n\n“The turn out from people in the community was the biggest we’ve ever seen to date for any of our events.\n\n“When we see the support and love for Ryan – it gives us the momentum to keep fighting.”\n\nWest Midlands Police continue to investigate Ryan’s death – having relaunched a homicide investigation last year.\n\nThe force is expected to issue a fresh appeal for information to mark the seventh anniversary of the tragedy."
