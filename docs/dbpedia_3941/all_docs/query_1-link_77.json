        "text": "What Is Kidderminster Harriers's Aggborough Stadium Like?\n\nAggborough is a good well-equipped ground, with seated stands on either side and a sizeable covered terrace at each end.\n\nOn one side is the Reynolds (Main Stand) Stand. This single-tiered stand was built in 1994. Although it comprises just eight rows of seats, it appears much larger as it has quite a tall back wall at the back of the stand, the middle portion of which houses a glassed-fronted executive area. The stand is covered and is free of supporting pillars. Incorporated into the seating area at the front of the stand are areas for each team’s staff and substitutes.\n\nOpposite is the newer East Stand, which was opened in 2003. This single tiered, cantilevered stand, is quite smart looking and has greatly improved the overall look of the ground. Perspex panels have been incorporated into the front of its roof allowing sunlight to reach the pitch. Behind this stand can be seen puffs of white smoke from the steam trains running to and from the station, which certainly gives the ground a bit of character. Part of the East Stand is given to away supporters.\n\nBoth ends are covered terraces, with the North Terrace being the traditional home end. The ground has a set of four tall modern looking floodlights.\n\nNew Stadium Proposals for Kidderminster Harriers\n\nIn 2017, the club unveiled plans to leave Aggborough and move to a new purpose-built stadium on the southwestern outskirts of Kidderminster, just off the A451 Stourport Road. However, seven years on and the project is yet to get off the ground.\n\nWhat is Kidderminster Harriers like for visiting supporters?\n\nAway fans are normally housed in the covered South Stand Terrace at one end of the ground, where around 1,500 supporters can be accommodated.\n\nIn addition, a number of seats are also made available in the Bill Greaves East Stand, where the facilities are good. The food available at Aggborough is almost legendary; with the same company doing the catering there for over 50 years. Take your pick from homemade cottage pies, soup, burgers and hot dogs.\n\nThe ground generally has a good atmosphere, helped by the fact that even a small number of supporters can make quite a noise from the covered terraces.\n\nWhere to drink around Aggborough?\n\nPubs near the Aggborough Stadium for away fans:\n\nHarriers Arms – Harriers FC, Hoo Rd, Kidderminster DY10 1NB\n\nRailway Bell – 42a Comberton Hill, Kidderminster DY10 1QN\n\nThe Station Inn – 7 Farfield, Kidderminster DY10 1UG\n\nDirections and Car Parking for Kidderminster Harriers\n\nThe trick to finding the ground is to follow signs for the ‘Severn Valley Railway’ (lots of steam trains if you are into that sort of thing), which is well signposted. The ground is just behind the station.\n\nFrom Birmingham, Wolverhampton and North (M5)\n\nLeave the M5 at Junction 3. Take the A456 towards Kidderminster. On entering the outskirts of Kidderminster, turn left at the traffic lights at the junction with the A449, by the Land Oak Public House. Turn right at the next lights and proceed towards the town centre, passing the Severn Valley Railway Station on your left. Turn left into Hoo Road which is just before the roundabout. The ground is up this road on the left.\n\nFrom Worcester and South (M5) Exit M5 at junction 6 (signposted A449) and follow towards Kidderminster (approximately 15 miles). At first roundabout, take third exit (signposted A449, Kidderminster & Wolverhampton), then take first turning on left before railway bridge. Go down Hoo Road, over railway bridge, and Aggborough Stadium is on the right hand side.\n\nFrom South-East (M40 & M42)\n\nLeave M5 at junction 4 (signposted A491 Stourbridge). After approximately 5 miles, turn left onto A456 and follow towards Kidderminster. At roundabout on Kidderminster Ring Road, take first exit (signposted A451 Stourport). At next roundabout, take first exit (signposted A448 Bromsgrove), then take first turning on right into Hoo Road for the ground..\n\nThere are a limited number of car parking spaces at the ground itself (North Stand Car Park). This will cost you £7.50 on a first come, first served basis. Otherwise, you can also park at the nearby Severn Valley Railway station.\n\nHow to get to Kidderminster Harriers by train\n\nThe ground is walkable (10 minutes) from Kidderminster Railway Station, which is served by trains from Birmingham Moor Street. Just come straight out of the station and go past the Severn Valley Railway station on your left. Go down the hill and turn left into Hoo Road and the ground is up this road on the left.\n\nBook Train Tickets With Trainline\n\nRemember if travelling by train then you can normally save on the cost of fares by booking in advance.\n\nVisit the the trainline website to see how much you can save on the price of train tickets.\n\nClick on the trainline logo below:\n\nTicket Prices at Kidderminster Harriers\n\nKidderminster ticket prices 2023/24:\n\nAdults: £18-20\n\nOver 65: £14-16\n\nStudent/Young Adult (age 16-21): £12-14\n\nU16s: £5-6\n\nKidderminster Harriers Programme Price\n\nOfficial Programme: £3.50\n\nKidderminster Harriers Local Rivals\n\nShrewsbury Town and Cheltenham Town.\n\nDisabled facilities at Kidderminster Harriers\n\nFor details of disabled facilities and club contact at the ground please visit the relevant page on the Level Playing Field website.\n\nKidderminster Harriers Fixture List\n\nKidderminster Harriers FC fixture list\n\nKidderminster Harriers Record and Average Attendance\n\nRecord Attendance\n\n9,155 v Hereford, November 27th, 1948\n\nAverage Attendance\n\n2022-2023: 2,237 (National League North)\n\n2021-2022: 2,219 (National League North)\n\n2020-2021: N/A (Covid)\n\n2019-2020: 834 (National League North)\n\n2018-2019: 1,550 (National League North)\n\n2017-2018: 1,652 (National League North)\n\n2016-2017: 1,763 (National League North)\n\n2015-2016: 1,804 (National League)\n\nFind and Book Your Kidderminster Hotel And Help Support This Website\n\nIf you require hotel accommodation in Kidderminster then first try a hotel booking service provided by Booking.com.
