        "text": "Gerald Grosvenor was a 16-year-old student at Harrow when reporters arrived at the school to inform him that his uncle had just died, which meant that Gerald was suddenly an honorary earl and that his father had unexpectedly inherited the title of Duke of Westminster.\n\nWondering what prompted such a fuss, he phoned his father, who replied with characteristic British forbearance: “Ah yes, we need to talk about that!”\n\nThe ensuing conversation transformed his life. Within five years, he was dutifully managing a real estate empire that included 300 acres of prime property in the middle of London.\n\nIn 1979, when his father died, 27-year-old Gerald Grosvenor officially became the sixth Duke of Westminster, a multibillionaire and Britain’s richest resident.\n\nAnd when he himself died on Aug. 9, at 64, he remained the country’s richest landowner, worth an estimated $12 billion.\n\n(By then he was no longer the richest resident, having moved down the list to sixth, while placing second among the country’s wealthiest citizens.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
