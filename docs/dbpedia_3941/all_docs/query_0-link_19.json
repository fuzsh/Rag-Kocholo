        "text": "Tom Bailey is back with transfer round up of the National League, including Glovers corner…\n\nGlovers’ Corner\n\nBefore we dive into the National League ins and outs, let’s look at the former Glovers that have moved about in the last couple of weeks. We may miss a few, so if any of you see any we may have missed, tag us on Facebook or Twitter (or X), or leave a comment below and we’ll add them in the next week’s round-up!\n\nLots of former Glover activity this week, and we begin with two players that were with the squad last season. One is Josh Owers, who has joined AFC Totton for next season, they’re also managed by a former coach of Mark Cooper’s, in Jimmy Ball – he was the interim manager for Forest Green following Cooper’s departure. The second Glover from last season’s side is Lewis Williams, who has joined Street. Williams played two games for Yeovil, both in the Somerset Premier Cup, before his quiet departure last season.\n\nThere are more Glovers on the move to look at too, as we see two players joining fellow National League clubs, with a combined three appearances in green and white. Billy Clifford joins Barnet from Ebbsfleet United, while Lewis Simper makes a permanent move from Cambridge United after many loans away, joining Sutton United. Daniel Leadbitter has returned to Gloucester City (ah, memories) following a year’s break from playing, and into bigger leagues, John Lundstram has moved to Turkey, leaving Rangers to join Trabzonspor.\n\nAll Transfers\n\nAFC Fylde\n\nNothing new at Fylde this week, so we’ll take the chance to add Ethan Mitchell to the list, who returned on a permanent deal near the start of the roundups, following a loan from Wigan Athletic last season.\n\nIn\n\nJoe Riley (Walsall)\n\nCorey Whelan (Carlisle United)\n\nEthan Mitchell (Wigan Athletic)\n\nOut\n\nLuke Conlan (Cliftonville)\n\nPierce Bird (Eastbourne Borough)\n\nSam Graham (unattached)\n\nDanny Whitehead (Macclesfield)\n\nAshley Hunter (unattached)\n\nJoe Rowley (unattached)\n\nTom Walker (Radcliffe)\n\nChris Neal (unattached)\n\nKieran Glynn (Scarborough Athletic)\n\nLuke Charman (Hartlepool United)\n\nConnor Barrett (Walsall)\n\nAldershot Town\n\nA quiet week in Aldershot, with no incomings or outgoings to speak of.\n\nIn\n\nHaydon Vaughan (Bracknell Town)\n\nPat Nash (Farnham Town)\n\nEmmanuel Maja (Banbury United)\n\nMarcus Dewhurst (Wealdstone)\n\nLuke Jenkins (Chelmsford City)\n\nCameron Hargreaves (King’s Lynn Town)\n\nOut\n\nEthan Burnett (unattached)\n\nStuart O’Keefe (Chatham Town)\n\nZain Walker (Welling United)\n\nTommy Willard (Worthing)\n\nAlex MacAllister (Leatherhead)\n\nJasper Sheik (unattached)\n\nFinlay Westen (unattached)\n\nCian Harries (Woking)\n\nCoby Rowe (unattached)\n\nMason Obeng (Walton & Hersham)\n\nAltrincham\n\nNo new incomings for Altrincham this week, however one of their departures has found a new club; Mitch Hancox has signed for National League North side Chester.\n\nIn\n\nLucas Weaver (Colne)\n\nJoe Nuttall (Oldham Athletic)\n\nOut\n\nJoey Jones (Walton & Hersham)\n\nMitch Hancox (Chester)\n\nDior Angus (AFC Telford United)\n\nGeorge Burroughs (unattached)\n\nDan Mooney (Boston United)\n\nLiam Brockbank (unattached)\n\nSam Roscoe (Linfield)\n\nChris Conn-Clarke (Peterborough United)\n\nBarnet\n\nIt’s a “hive” of activity (see what I did there?) at Barnet, as another THREE new faces arrived this week.
