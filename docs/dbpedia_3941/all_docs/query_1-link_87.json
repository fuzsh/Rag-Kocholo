        "text": "The 2023/24 Adran Leagues looks to be an exciting one with a full complement across the three divisions.\n\nFor the last few campaigns, the divisions have been run with less than eight teams in the second-tier leagues, but following the FAW’s recent allocations, we have three full divisions of eight teams.\n\nTaking their place in the Adran Premier is Adran North champions Wrexham who overcame Adran South winners Briton Ferry 1-0 in the Play-Off Final at Latham Park back in April. Rebecca Pritchard scored the only goal as the Dragons – backed by the riches of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney – took their place in the top flight of Welsh football. Wrexham will play their home games at The Rock, the stadium of troubled Cymru North outfit Cefn Druids.\n\nUnfortunately, Abergavenny Women have decided to fold following their relegation from the Adran Premier, and their players are all now free to join new clubs. Their demise, along with a five-team Adran South, made for a few vacancies and we have now seen Coed Duon, Cwmbran Celtic, and Llanelli Town all given promotions. Cardiff Wanderers, who have recently rebranded as Taffs Well, won the Welsh Women’s League last season but did not have the necessary criteria.\n\nIn the Adran North, CPDM Bangor have been promoted along with NFA. As there are now eight teams in both the North and South, relegation will come in to effect. The season will begin on Sunday, September 3 for the second tier, and and the Adran Premier campaign begins on Sunday, September 17.\n\nBelow is what the 24 Adran Leagues League clubs have been up to so far.\n\nAdran Leagues Premier\n\nAberystwyth Town\n\nBarry Town United\n\nCardiff City\n\nCardiff Met\n\nPontypridd United\n\nSwansea City\n\nThe New Saints\n\nWrexham\n\nAdran Leagues North\n\nAirbus UK Broughton\n\nCPDM Bangor\n\nConnah’s Quay Nomads\n\nCPDM Y Felinheli\n\nLlandudno\n\nLlanfair United\n\nNFA\n\nCPD Y Rhyl 1879\n\nAdran Leagues South transfers\n\nBriton Ferry Llansawel\n\nCaldicot Town\n\nCascade YC\n\nCoed Duon\n\nCwmbran Celtic\n\nLlanelli Town\n\nPontardawe Town\n\nSwansea University"
