        "text": "FA Trophy 3rd round Date: 09-12-23 Match preview Vs Stourbridge FC Venue: Aggborough Kick off: 15:00hrs\n\nPreview: Phil Lench\n\nThe Harriers get their FA Trophy campaign underway tomorrow, against Stourbridge FC, with a new, long overdue, striker in the ranks.\n\nEarlier today the former Kings Lynn Town and AFC Fylde striker Gold Omotayo signed for an undisclosed fee after only joining Fylde on a free transfer in the summer. Evidently things may be going pear shaped at Fylde with attacking midfielder Alex Whitmore also having left them for Solihull Moors for a fee a week ago. Is the Pet Shop Boy (David Haythornthwaite) running out of money?\n\nWe might get to see the first of our long term injured back tomorrow with the news that Shane Byrne may play a part. Joe Leesley and Nathaniel Knight-Percival are still some time off. Russ Penn has said that we’ll be playing a full strength team tomorrow and will likely go with the one that beat Ebbsfleet Utd last Saturday. That could mean that we’ll only see Gold for the last ten minutes of the game.\n\nOur recent history against Stourbridge isn’t good reading having lost in the FA Cup and Trophy in 2015 and then again in the FA Cup in 2018, all at the cricket pitch, but we did get a massive face saving win in the Worcester Senior Cup in 2016 so all is good for some fans.\n\nAt one time Stourbridge was regular stop off point to retirement for many Harriers players but now there are just the two with Alex Prosser and Darryl Knights there. Now thirty five Dazzler is the one seeing his career out there.\n\nWith this being our first game at Aggborough against them, a win last week and a new striker we thought we would never see it can only be a win for us.\n\nPhoto © KHFC\n\nReferee: Mr Richard Aspinall.
