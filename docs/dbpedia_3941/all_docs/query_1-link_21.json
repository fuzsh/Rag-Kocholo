        "text": "SEASON REVIEW – THE VIRUS DELIVERS A KNOCK-OUT BLOW\n\n——————————————————————-\n\nHOW THE 2019/20 SEASON DIDN’T HAPPEN – MATCH REPORTS BELOW REVIEW\n\nThe 2019/20 season was the season that wasn’t.\n\nIt started like any other with everyone full of optimism after the summer break, but it ended like no other after being swept away by a previously unknown virus that originated in the remote Chinese city of Wuhan and soon spread worldwide at devastating speed with its impact on football being of no consequence in comparison to the misery and disruption it was responsible for elsewhere.\n\nThe 2018/19 season had seen Town achieve heights never previously achieved with their best ever fifth place finish in the Southern League Premier Division Central, which earned them a promotion play-off spot, plus history making with progress in the F A Trophy to reach the First Round proper and the lifting of silverware with the Southern League Challenge Cup all combining to propel supporters into dreamland.\n\nBut any thoughts that it would be more of the same in 2019/20 didn’t last long. Within a fortnight of the play off defeat at Kings Lynn Head of Football Thomas Baillie had departed only to reappear shortly afterwards in a similar role at Tamworth, and the break-up of his squad soon began.\n\nJamie McAteer who had missed the closing weeks of the season quickly switched to Barwell but what stunned supporters was the departure of playmaker Will Grocott who was quickly lured away to Stourbridge.\n\nA fixture in Town’s midfield for the past three seasons Will was Town’s longest serving player having clocked up 153 appearances, and the dejection among the Town faithful increased when the equally popular striker Mike Taylor, who revelled in the nickname of “the Beast,” also decided that his future lay with the big spending Glassboys after 119 appearances and 44 goals.\n\nAnd Stourbridge were not finished yet as soon after they swooped for central defender Jordan Williams while there was another hammer blow as inspirational skipper Jimmy Fry followed Baillie to Tamworth.\n\nSo for the second summer running Town were searching for a new manager, and it didn’t take long for the appointment of Tommy Wright to be announced. Tommy had recently left Darlington and had previously been in charge at Corby Town when they won the Southern League Premier Division title in 2014/15.\n\nIt was also confirmed that Paul Davis would stay on as Assistant Manager along with Steve Walker as First Team Coach and Head of the Academy.\n\nAnd Tommy Wright immediately got off to a good start with Town supporters by holding a well attended open meeting at which the ex-Evesham United manager Paul Collicutt was introduced taking on the role of Head of Football Operations.\n\nSeveral challenging topics were discussed including new players, budget and whether Town could repeat last season’s heroics. All were dealt with by Tommy in an honest and open way which left supporters feeling that in spite of all the departures it was not all doom and gloom and there was room for optimism as well.\n\nTommy soon began to draft in some new faces starting with the addition of the 6 foot 9 inch keeper Sam Lomax and the speedy winger Kurtis Revan plus the experienced Callum Ball, who numbered Derby County among his previous clubs and who had been with Tommy Wright at Corby Town, and the equally well travelled Liam Hughes who had played under Wright at Darlington.\n\nAnd there were plenty more newcomers such as midfielders Joel Gyasi and Luis “Love Island” Morrison, defender Dan Vann and striker Chris Wreh when the pre-season friendlies began starting with a trip to Yeovil Town where Tommy Wright fielded a different team in each half.\n\nFamiliar names included from last season were Chris Cox, Cody Fisher, Kynan Isaac, Nabil Shariff and Lewis Wilson, but those Town supporters who journeyed down to Somerset expecting to see Albi Skendi in Tommy Wright’s side had a surprise when they arrived as he had agreed a move to the Glovers having been offered a full time contract following his stand out form in Town’s midfield last season and was lining up against them.\n\nFurther friendlies against Racing Club Warwick, Worcester City, Cheltenham Town, Aston Villa Under 23’s and Leicester Road followed and although results in these games are pretty well meaningless they were all won which could only boost everyone’s confidence.\n\nOther players now involved included keeper Elliott Taylor, defender Lyndon Dovey, and midfielders Morgan Brown, Mitchell Glover and Ivor Lawton together with the return to Town of James Hancocks and also the ex-Town Youth hotshot Dylan Parker after his spell at Walsall.\n\nBut missing from all of this was Wilson Carvalho who had secured a move into the full time game with League One Accrington Stanley as he followed Ben Stephens from twelve months ago into the EFL.\n\nThe final two friendlies against a strong Brackley Town side and near neighbours Evesham United were both lost, but in spite of those results and then being hit by the sudden and unexpected departures of Chris Cox and Kynan Isaac Tommy Wright proclaimed himself satisfied with how the preparations had gone announcing that he was looking forward to the new season and couldn’t wait to get started.\n\nAugust\n\nFollowing all the summer comings and goings it was pretty much an unrecognisable Town side both on the pitch and in the dug-out for the opening match of the season at home to Needham Market.\n\nOnly Nabil Shariff survived from the starting line-up in the Kings Lynn play-off tie to start this time although he was joined by Cody Fisher, Tom Fishwick and Lewis Wilson who had been on the subs bench then, but Town at least got off to a winning start thanks to as added time strike from Chris Wreh.\n\nBut history then repeated itself in their second match when Town again had to travel to Stourbridge and just as twelve months earlier were dealt a reality check as Will Grocott and Co strolled to a 3-1 win with Town having the added embarrassment of Luis Morrison being red carded.\n\nBack at the Arden Garages Stadium the following Saturday it was another late goal from super-sub Chris Wreh which rescued a point against Kings Langley in a 3-3 draw which Tommy Wright described as “a great game for the neutral but a nightmare for the managers.”\n\nBut the talking point of the afternoon was the return to Town of the unpredictable Kynan Isaac. Having apparently made peace with Tommy Wright he went straight into the starting line-up, but it was a one game wonder as he had gone again by next weekend before eventually returning in January after spells at North Leigh and Banbury United.\n\nChris Wreh was promoted to the starting line-up for Town’s third Saturday home fixture in a row and took his tally for the season to four with two quality finishes as Tommy Wright’s side turned on the style to convincingly beat Rushden and Diamonds who had arrived with a 100% record.\n\nSeven points from their first four games represented a promising start for the new look Town side, but some of the gloss was taken off as the next two outings ended in disappointing setbacks.\n\nTwo days after the Rushden game an August Bank holiday Monday trip to Rushall Olympic’s brand new 3G pitch saw Town on the wrong end of a 4-1 scoreline and the following Saturday Biggleswade Town took all the ;points from the Arden Garages Stadium with a 2-1 win.\n\nAnd that was Cody Fisher’s last Town game for the time being as he soon followed the by now familiar path to Stourbridge before making the reverse journey shortly before the season was shut down.\n\nSeptember\n\nLeague action was then put on hold as Town’s next two games were Cup ties with dramatically contrasting results.\n\nBoldmere St Michaels were old rivals from Town’s MFA days but they were overwhelmed in the First Qualifying Round of the F A Cup as Tommy Wright’s side romped to a 6-1 win with Nabil Shariff helping himself to a hat trick before it all went wrong for Town three days later.\n\nEven though they were the holders of the Southern League Challenge Cup they were drawn to play in the Preliminary Round at home to Halesowen Town. The Yeltz had been relegated from the Premier Central Division at the end of last season but reinvigorated under new manager Paul Smith they were a totally different proposition now, and with the only goal of the evening they deservedly went through as Town’s defence of the trophy won so ecstatically back in April ended at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTown needed an immediate response to lift the gloom and did so with a battling draw at Coalville and then a comfortable home win over Alvechurch who like Town were having to rebuild after reaching last season’s play-offs and were now under the care of ex-Town boss Darren Byfield.\n\nBy now new faces were appearing in the squad with left back Charley O’Keefe debuting against Halesowen followed by midfielders Joe Curtis and Luke Rowe against Coalville.\n\nBut Halesowen weren’t finished with Town yet and after their League Cup win ten days earlier they were understandably confident of repeating that result in the F A Cup Second Qualifying Round tie at the Grove.\n\nAnd on an afternoon when Town were simply desperate the Yeltz romped to a 4-1 success with Nabil Shariff adding to Town’s woes by being sent off halfway through the second half.\n\nThe bare result was bad enough, but it was to have far reaching consequences not least financial as any hopes of further prize money were dashed.\n\nBy the following weekend’s league fixture at Hitchin Callum Ball, Lynden Dovey, Joel Gyasi, Ivor Lawton and Luis Morrison had all been released with Morrison going on Twitter to say that his departure was “not for footballing reasons” and Tommy Wright subsequently confirming that a cut in the playing budget was behind this mass exit.\n\nSo new signings were needed and Kairo Edwards-John and George Heaven were both introduced at Hitchin, but it was another limp Town display which handed the struggling Canaries their first league win of the season\n\nOctober\n\nBut after a turbulent couple of weeks which had started with their F A Cup exit at Halesowen followed by the budget cut, the subsequent player departures and the defeat at Hitchin the fixture list seemed to have given Town the perfect chance to get their season back on track.\n\nThe following Saturday could have been left blank as it was the next round of the F A Cup and scheduled opponents Hednesford were still involved, but Town were able to bring forward their home game against bottom club Leiston who had also exited the competition and who had managed only a solitary point from nine outings conceding 36 goals in the process including eight against Peterborough Sports the previous Saturday.\n\nAnd with the squad still seemingly evolving Town introduced two new signings in 19 year old keeper Mitchell Allen, who had just been released by Stoke City and who was making what turned out to be his only Town appearance, and defender Kyle Rowley who has had spells at Cheltenham Town and Alvechurch, and they became the 30th and 31st players respectively used by Tommy Wright this season.\n\nBut even though Town won 3-1 it wasn’t a convincing performance and Chairman Jed McCrory and the Board had seen enough. A few days later it was announced that Tommy Wright had been dismissed and following the previous departures of Carl Adams, Darren Byfield and Thomas Baillie it left Town to search for their fourth manager in 18 months.\n\nHis league record had been pretty respectable with four wins, two draws and four losses from ten games yielding 14 points but it was the two Cup defeats by Halesowen which did for him.\n\nNevertheless Town were comfortably in mid-table when he left and were never to be in that happy situation afterwards.\n\nPaul Davis was named as Caretaker Manager and remained in that role for the rest of the campaign but his time in charge got off to the worst possible start as Lowestoft cruised to a 3-0 win at the Arden Garages Stadium and Town’s slide into the lower reaches of the table was under way.\n\nWatford loanee Harvey White was in goal against the Trawlerboys while another new face in the starting line-up was midfielder Ravi Shamsi who had joined from Leamington and making their debuts from the subs bench were Boubakar Traore and Foday Nabay.\n\nNabay had been a teenage sensation at Birmingham City and in 2013 Fulham had paid £225,000 to acquire him from Birmingham City when he was just 15 years old, but he had been blighted by injury since and during his timer at Town seldom showed any glimpses of his earlier potential.\n\nMeanwhile heading out of the exit door were James Hancocks and Dylan Parker to link up with former boss Carl Adams at Rugby Town plus Liam Hughes who moved to Bradford Park Avenue.\n\nFour days later Town exited the Birmingham Senior Cup losing to Wolves Under 23 side after a penalty shoot-out when there were more debutants on show.\n\nDefenders Kyle Ambris and Matt Bower were on loan from Tamworth and Bath City respectively, but far more significant was Courtney Richards who joined from Nuneaton Borough and went on to be an ever-present in Town’s starting line-up for the rest of the season.\n\nWith the next weekend’s opponents Royston still involved in the F A Cup Town instead opted for a low key friendly at Kettering in which the opportunity was taken to give a number of Academy scholars a taste of first team action before League action resumed with the midweek visit of Tamworth.\n\nTown took an early lead but everything changed a couple of minutes before half time when Ambris gave away a penalty form which the Lambs duly equalised. Ambris was sent off for committing the foul and after a scuffle following the spot kick when Harvey White went to retrieve the ball from the back of the net the keeper was sent off as well leaving Town to face the second half with only nine players including defender Matt Bower taking over in goal.\n\nInevitably Tamworth went on to win, but it had been an unedifying return to the Arden Garages Stadium for last season’s Head of Football Thomas Baillie and skipper Jimmy Fry.\n\nThe following Saturday was scheduled to be a home F A Trophy First Qualifying Round tie against Hednesford but an overnight deluge meant that it was delayed until the following Tuesday.\n\nAnd in spite of Shamsi firing Town ahead with a 40 yard wonder strike there was to be no repeat of the historic run in last season’s competition as the Pitmen hit back to end Town’s Cup interest for the season and, as the saying goes, leave them to concentrate on the League with 30 games left to play.\n\nThe tie did however feature three more debutants in keeper Jack Bennett from Bradford PA, left back Kai Woollard-Innocent on loan from QPR and midfielder Matthew Campbell-Mhlope who had joined from Kings Langley as the seasonal player count reached 41.\n\nNovember\n\nSo with four games all at home resulting in two League defeats and two Cup exits the Paul Davis era had hardly got off to a promising start, but worse was soon to follow.\n\nNext up was a visit to newly promoted Peterborough Sports. Town were only one down at half time but conceded five in the second half during which several Town players committed the unforgiveable and effectively gave up.\n\nA seething Paul Davis described his side’s second half display as “capitulation” but in reality he was being polite.\n\nIt didn’t get much better a week later when in spite of five changes and the introduction of striker Kyle McFarlane on loan from York City another four goals hit he back of the net making ten in two games as Coalville Town cruised to a 4-1 win in front of the shellshocked Town faithful at the Arden Garages Stadium.\n\nNabil Shariff had departed for Rushden and Diamonds following the Peterborough debacle, and after the Coalville defeat he was followed out of the exit door by Tom Fishwick and Luke Rowe to Romulus and Worcester city respectively.\n\nAll of this meant that Town were still looking for their first point since Tommy Wright’s departure when the fixture schedule saw them next make the short trip to Nuneaton Borough.\n\nThe match was most memorable for a missed penalty taken by Nuneaton’s ex-Leamington keeper Tony Breeden early in the second half when the score was still 0-0. Hitting it with all the force he could muster the ball soared over the bar and crashed against a strip light in the stand behind the goal leaving it dangling but somehow still lit for the remainder of the afternoon and video of the incident immediately went viral on the Internet.\n\nBut two late strikes saw Borough take the points and Town had now slipped into the bottom six in the table.\n\nBut Paul Davis at last got off the mark at the eighth attempt the following Tuesday under the Arden Garages Stadium floodlights when Town gained at least a modicum of revenge for their F A Trophy defeat as they surged to a 4-1 win over a Hednesford team who were second best all evening.\n\nUnfortunately though Town couldn’t immediately build on that winning momentum as they then had a blank weekend due to the scheduled fixture against Leiston having already been played and of course becoming Tommy Wright’s swansong in the process.\n\nSo it was another week before they were back in action with a testing Tuesday night trip to Royston. Town gave it their all but Royston had the better of the 3-2 scoreline which added to the importance of Town’s game at St Ives the following weekend.\n\nIf Town were struggling St Ives were doing even worse and went into the game having taken only one point from their previous seven outings, yet it was the Saints who seemed to be on their way to a rare win when they led 2-0 early in the second half only for Kyle McFarlane to come off the subs bench and rescue a point with two vital strikes the second of which came with only three minutes to go.\n\nDecember\n\nAny hopes that the late comeback at St Ives would spark an upsurge in Town’s results were quickly dispelled when Barwell visited the Arden Garages Stadium for a midweek fixture the following Tuesday as it was a case of “Peterborough revisited” with Barwell scoring four in the second half and romping to a 5-1 win.\n\nAnother home defeat to Bromsgrove Sporting followed next weekend with Mike Taylor having moved on from Stourbridge inevitably on the scoresheet against his former club.\n\nTown had some relief when their home fixture against Hitchin was waterlogged off, but it was a third loss in a row in their final game before Christmas when a questionable penalty decision gave Hednesford the opportunity to take all three points.\n\nBy now Jim Scott, who was a part of the Northampton Town academy set-up, had been recruited as Assistant Manager, but he had hardly had time to make an impact when Town made the short trip down the M40 to face Banbury United on Boxing Day.\n\nAnd there was precious little Christmas spirit as in an ill-tempered clash Banbury emulated Barwell by striking four times after half time on their way to an eventual 5-0 scoreline which meant that Town had lost all four of their December games scoring just two and conceding thirteen.\n\nJanuary\n\nAfter the debacle at Banbury it was decided that another revamp of the squad was required and for the New Year’s Day home fixture against Rushall Olympic four new signings were introduced followed by two more at Needham Market three days later and another four against Stourbridge the next weekend making ten in all which took the season’s player total to 58 with last season’s figure of 54 already left well behind.\n\nThere was also yet another return for the prodigal Kynan Isaac while Mo Sebbeh-Njie from last season’s squad was another to reappear after a brief spell at Kettering Town.\n\nAnd changes weren’t confined to the players as the experienced Dale Belford had recently left Nuneaton Borough and took over as Assistant Manager from Jim Scott whose time at Town had lasted barely a month.\n\nMost of the newcomers didn’t last long with only Reece Flanagan still being in the squad for what turned out to be Town’s final game of the season at Tamworth.\n\nSolihull Moors loanee Dan Sweeney at least showed his quality with four goals in six games and Javia Roberts provided glimpses of ability during his eight game spell, but among the others Rheiss McLean and David Neligwa only made one substitute appearance each while the Senegalese defender Abdou Diakhate played the first half at Needham Market and was never seen again.\n\nTo make way for all these arrivals however brief their stay there had to be departures. Nabay, Campbell-Mhlope and Bower never featured again after Banbury and Lomax played only once more while Chris Wreh left for Rushall after the Needham Market game followed by Ross Oulton going to Barwell and then Town’s current longest serving player Lewis Wilson switching to Banbury United on the eve of the trip to Kings Langley.\n\nAnd in spite of the adherence to the revolving door policy of player recruitment results didn’t improve. The games against Rushall, Needham Market and Stourbridge were all lost although only by the odd goal extending Town’s losing run to seven, and after the Stourbridge game a small group of supporters vented their feelings in a heated exchange with Chairman Jed McCrory by the players tunnel.\n\nTown responded by beating basement side Redditch United on a damp Tuesday evening on the Reds 3G pitch with Wolves loanee James Pardington debuting in goal, but further defeats at Rushden and Diamonds and Kings Langley followed leaving them uncomfortably placed in the bottom four.\n\nSo although well clear of St Ives and Redditch they were nervously looking over their shoulder at Alvechurch which meant the rearranged home game against Hitchin Town, who were only two places higher in the table although ten points better off, seemed to offer the chance of opening up a worthwhile gap.\n\nThat appeared very much on the cards when Town led 2-0 at half time and after being pegged back to 2-2 by a Hitchin second half revival they regained the lead to be 3-2 up going into added time.\n\nBut then a carelessly conceded and even more carelessly defended free kick enabled Hitchin to make it 3-3 and a frustrated Paul Davis could scarcely contain his anger afterwards at how a much needed three points had been thrown away simply by players not following his instructions.\n\nFebruary\n\nAfter the Hitchin setback Town faced a testing trip to Biggleswade where the experienced duo of defender Michael Townsend and striker Kyle Perry plus Rob Thompson-Brown took the players used total to 64.\n\nThompson-Brown had been part of Morton Titterton’s MFA League Cup winning squad in 2011 before moving on to Kidderminster Harriers and Leamington among others, and had first returned to Town when he was part of Carl Adams’ play-off winning squad in 2014/15.\n\nNow he was back again, and it was his introduction from the subs bench in the 72nd minute that changed a game which looked to be heading for a goalless stalemate.\n\nAlmost immediately his pace unnerved the Waders defence as he was brought down in full flight and from the resulting free kick Courtney Richards swept in the winner which meant Town had taken four points from two games having previously taken only seven from eighteen since Tommy Wright’s exit.\n\nWith the next scheduled fixture against Coalville having already been played in November when both sides had a free weekend after early F A Trophy exits Town now had a fortnight’s break before their return fixture at the Arden Garages Stadium against the apparently already doomed Redditch.\n\nBut it was not to be a peaceful fortnight as halfway through Dan Sweeney was involved in a controversial move to Hednesford. His one month loan spell from Solihull Moors expired and although he wished to extend his stay and Town were keen for him to do so he was persuaded to switch to the Pitmen leaving Paul Davis not best pleased to say the least.\n\nThen Storm Dennis intervened and it was only due to the heroic efforts of Mark Bickley and his team of volunteers that the Redditch game went ahead with Town outbattling the Reds and the elements on their way to a 2-0 win which meant they had recorded back-to-back wins and also back-to-back clean sheets for the first time this season\n\nThe game also saw the return of Cody Fisher and the debut of Leicester City loanee Rhys Davies who became Town’s seventh keeper of the season.\n\nTown had now gone three games unbeaten and climbed out of the bottom four by leapfrogging Leiston, but that encouraging sequence didn’t survive the testing trip to the Far East aka Lowestoft Town. With the A14 not helping by having two lengthy diversions thus extending Town’s journey time to some five hours it was hardly a surprise that they never really got going as they slipped to a 2-0 defeat.\n\nBut four debutants at Lowestoft, including the return to Town of Luke Barlone who, like Thompson-Brown, had also been involved in the 2014/15 play-off success, took the season’s player count to a staggering 70 including a scarcely believable 22 in the ten games since the turn of the year.\n\nMarch\n\nWith Royston sill involved in the F A Trophy Town now had another free Saturday until their next fixture which could hardly have been more daunting as it was away to table toppers Tamworth.\n\nFurther debutants Karnell Chambers and Henry Cowans took the seasonal total to 72 but couldn’t prevent the Lambs surging to a 4-1 win with Paul Davis taking some consolation that the four teams below Town all lost as well so that in his words “it was another game ticked off.”\n\nBut the coronavirus was now an ever increasing threat and soon intervened to ensure that the Tamworth fixture played on March 7th was to be Town’s final action of the season.\n\nThe next weekend’s game at Barwell was called off by the Southern League the day before it was due to take place and at the same time the home games against Royston and Peterborough Sports scheduled for the following Tuesday and Saturday were similarly postponed.\n\nAnd as the situation deteriorated by the day the remaining games of the season were quickly also put on hold until the inevitable decision was announced on Thursday March 26th to end the season and declare it null and void with the results expunged and all promotion and relegation cancelled.\n\nSo any lingering relegation threat to Town was instantly wiped out although they would probably have been safe anyway. They had never been in the bottom three and they had key fixtures coming up against fellow strugglers Leiston, Alvechurch and St Ives in which the hoped for positive results would surely have propelled them well clear of the drop zone.\n\nNevertheless the abrupt and unprecedented end to the season can’t disguise the fact that it had been a particularly disappointing and frustrating campaign as they ended with only 28 points from the 33 games played. Even though none of that counted anymore it had been a long hard struggle for most of the time.\n\nUnder both Tommy Wright and then Paul Davis the team had never really got going and of Town’s five seasons at Premier Division level in terms of points per game this was the worst by some way.\n\nMost regular Town watchers would put this down to the fact that a bewildering number of 72 players were used. With so comings and goings the team rarely displayed any cohesion or fluency on the pitch, while there was also a worrying decline in attendances as supporters struggled to come to terms with the constant change of names and faces in the Town shirts.\n\nAll of this brought the system of player recruitment under increasing scrutiny. It was certainly questionable at best and shambolic at worst with 34 of the players used featuring in five or less games and 14 appearing just once with 9 of those only coming on from the subs bench, and if Town are to do better next time round then there has to be a major rethink and improvement in this area.\n\nBut with a number of clubs expected to struggle financially over the coming months due to the abrupt and premature end of the season nothing much is likely to be the same for anybody in the future.\n\nTrue success at this level is often just survival, and Town’s immediate priority is to ride out the ongoing uncertainties so that when football does return they are able to do so as well – whenever that may be.\n\nReview compiled by Bryan Hale\n\n.

Karnell Chambers who has joined from Chippenham Town replaced Rob Thompson-Brown while another new face in Henry Cowans – son of Villa legend Gordan – who has switched from Telford United took over from Leam Howards and the returning Kyle McFarlane came in for Kyle Perry.\n\nChasing a sixth successive win to consolidate their grip on top spot Tamworth almost went ahead inside the opening minute when Bilal Yafai slid in to connect with Tyrell Waite’s low cross from the right only for Town keeper Rhys Davies to react instinctively and push it behind from point blank range.\n\nSoon after the dangerous Waite wasn‘t far away with a fiercely struck effort which fizzed narrowly wide and with Tamworth bossing the possession he followed that a minute later with another shot which was blocked by Cowans.\n\nIn a rare Town foray forward Chambers sprinted down the right to reach the byline and drive in as low cross which was only parried by Tamworth keeper Jas Singh with Lathaniel Rowe-Turner in the right place to complete the clearance.\n\nA Kynan Isaac free kick in the 23rd minute resulted in a Town corner which the Lambs needed a couple of attempts to deal with but when they did get it away the speedy Ahmed Obeng broke away down the right to whip in a low cross which was met with an emphatic finish by Waite to give the table toppers a deserved lead.\n\nAnother full length Davies save from an Aaron Forde thunderbolt prevented Town from going two down with Dan Vann twice doing well to halt dangerous runs down the left by Waite and then Davies making a routine save from Forde as the Lambs continued to pile forward.\n\nJordan Gough went close with a header from a Ryan Beswick corner five minutes before the break, and right on half time only the woodwork stopped the Lambs doubling their lead when Yafai’s crisp right footer ricocheted behind off the outside Davies’ left hand post.\n\nThe reprieve though was only to be shortlived as two minutes into the second half the Town defence failed to deal with a bouncing ball in the penalty area allowing Obeng to fire past Davies from eight yards out.\n\nBut Town stunned the home crowd by pulling one back two minutes later when Perry, who had been a 33rd minute replacement for the injured Cody Fisher, headed in from a Chambers free kick.\n\nThe Lambs were soon back on the attack and regained their two goal advantage on the hour mark when Yafai was pulled down by Courtney Richards as he worked his way into the penalty area and Ryan Beswick slammed the spot kick past Davies with the minimum of fuss.\n\nObeng was now causing the Town backline plenty of problems with his pace and persistence firing narrowly wide after cutting in from the right followed by drilling in a cross which was inches away from the stretching Joel Carta at the far post.\n\nBut Town squandered a great chance of a second goal with twenty minutes to go when Chambers found himself one-on-one with Singh and skipped round the keeper only to then inexplicably delay his shot and be robbed by a perfectly timed tackle from Rowe-Turner.\n\nWith fifteen minutes to go Tamworth sent on the former Town favourite Jimmy Fry and he was joined by another ex-Townite in Chris Lait as they concentrated on seeing the game out and they added a fourth in the final minute with an assured finish from Carta.\n\nSTRATFORD : Rhys Davies, Dan Vann (George Heaven 67), Cody Fisher (Kyle Perry 33), Courtney Richards (c), Michal Townsend, Kyle Rowley, Karnell Chambers, Declan Benjamin, Kyle McFarlane (Leam Howards 75), Henry Cowans, Kynan Isaac Unused Subs – Reece Flanagan & Rob Thompson-Brown\n\nTAMWORTH : Jas Singh, Ben Hart, Jordan Gough, Ryan Beswick (c) (Jimmy Fry 75), Joe Magunda, Lathaniel Rowe-Turner, Tyrell Waite, Aaron Forde, Gerry Mcdonagh (Joel Carta 63), Bilal Yafai.

Cody Fisher has returned after a short spell at Stourbridge and resumed at left back allowing Kynan Isaac to move into midfield at the expense of Mo Sebbeh-Njie.\n\nElsewhere Rob Thompson-Brown and Kyle Perry came in for the departed pair of Javia Roberts and Dan Sweeney.\n\nEven though they were facing the howling gale from the Golf Course end Redditch started brightly, but it was Town who had the first chance of the afternoon in the tenth minute when Rob Thompson-Brown’s low drive was deflected behind, and they should have opened the scoring seven minutes later when Cody Fisher’s cross from the left picked out the unmarked Leam Howards who could only steer a free header wastefully wide.\n\nSoon after Perry netted after Reds keeper Kieran Boucher had only parried another stinging Thompson-Brown effort but the offside flag was already up.\n\nA perfectly timed tackle by Josh Endall prevented Howards from going clear in the 20th minute while at the other end a similarly crucial intervention by Dan Vann halted a promising run from Taimoor Hussain.\n\nTown though were now forcing the Reds further and further back. Boucher comfortably held a crisp right footer from Reece Flanagan on the half hour mark followed by Vann heading over from another Fisher cross, but it was Fisher who came closest to giving Town the lead a minute before the break when he was released down the left by Isaac to surge into the penalty area only for his close range shot to cannon away off the advancing Boucher’s legs.\n\nTown continued to be well on top after the restart and in the 50th minute Boucher did well to push away an Isaac free kick with Flanagan’s follow-up from the loose ball being charged down.\n\nFlanagan again tested Boucher a couple of minutes later with a fiercely struck drive which the busy Reds keeper turned behind at the foot of his right hand post.\n\nTown were piling on the pressure but frustratingly the afternoon was still goalless until the 70th minute when Perry was brought down in a central position some 25 yards out and Thompson-Brown’s free kick fizzed through the Redditch wall and squirmed under Boucher’s despairing dive into the bottom corner.\n\nBoucher then had to make further saves from Perry and Howards but to their credit the Reds kept going and the second goal Town needed to wrap it all up didn’t arrive until the fifth minute of added time when Isaac cut in from the left and his shot looped off Boucher to come back off the bar and provide Perry with a simple tap-in,\n\nSTRATFORD : Rhys Davies, Dan Vann, Cody Fisher, Courtney Richards (c), Michael Townsend, Kyle Rowley, Rob Thompson-Brown (Bekir Halil 87), Reece Flanagan (Mo Sebbeh-Njie 81), Kyle Perry, Leam Howards (Kyle Ambris 90+3), Kynan Isaac.

Kynan Isaac switched to left back in place of Gedeon Okito, while new signing Michael Townsend, who played over 100 games for Cheltenham Town but who has more recently been at Coalville replaced Dan Alessi at centre half and Leam Howards came in to take Isaac’s midfield slot.\n\nWith a heavy pitch and a brisk wind both teams understandably took time to adjust to the conditions and the only serious goal attempt in the opening quarter of an hour was a long range shot from the Waders Corey Panter which was wide enough not to concern Town keeper James Pardington.\n\nFive minutes later a Callum Donnelly cross from the left flew just beyond Shane Bush, and as the Waders began to have more of the possession Pardington did well to stretch to his left and hold a Jonathan Edwards header from a Matt Ball free kick.\n\nAnd in the 25th minute the Waders came the closest yet to taking the lead when Edwards hit a thunderous right footer from some 25 yards out which fizzed inches over.\n\nTown responded with Reece Flanagan having a shot blocked followed by a couple of corners in quick succession which ended with Kyle Rowley firing over.\n\nBack came the Waders and on 35 minutes Oliver Swain had a great chance from a Dylan Williams left wing cross only to head wide of the far post from five yards out.\n\nTown’s best opportunity so far didn’t arrive until two minutes before half time when Dan Sweeney’s trademark persistence caused panic in the Waders defence with the ball falling kindly to Howards who could only shoot straight at keeper Richard Walton.\n\nPaul Davis introduced the much travelled striker Kyle Perry in place of Flanagan for the restart but the first chance of the second half came the way of Howards whose low drive was pushed behind by Walton.\n\nBut Town had a let off in the 53rd minute when Pardington could only parry a fiercely struck Ball effort with Edwards smashing the rebound into the roof of the net before his celebrations were cut short as he turned away to find the offside flag already up.\n\nAs in the first half the Waders were the more threatening of the two sides but Townsend was adding increased solidity to the Town backline and with most of the Waders attempts being from some way out Pardingtion was rarely troubled.\n\nRob Thompson-Brown came on for Roberts on 72 minutes to become Town’s third debutant of the afternoon and their 64th player of the season before Perry wasn’t far away for Town and Ball similarly close for the Waders, but by now it was increasingly clear that one goal would probably be enough to decide the destiny of the points.\n\nAnd it was Town who struck in the 81st minute when Thompson-Brown was brought down in full flight just outside the penalty area. Isaac’s free kick was not properly dealt with by the Waders defence and Richards seized on the loose ball to sweep it beyond Walton into the bottom corner of the net from the edge of the penalty area for his first Town goal.\n\nThe Waders tried hard to find an equaliser and Town had to contend with six added minutes at the end but they held on to secure their second away win of the season plus their third clean sheet and more importantly three crucial survival points.\n\nSTRATFORD : James Pardington, Dan Vann, Kynan Isaac, Courtney Richards (c), Michael Townsend, Kyle Rowley, Javia Roberts (Rob Thompson-Brown 72), Mo Sebbeh-Njie, Dan Sweeney (Dan Alessi 87), Reece Flanagan (Kyle Perry 46).

It was the defender’s first Town goal and it provided Paul Davis’ side with the perfect start.\n\nBut Hitchin soon showed the form that had seen them beat highflying Peterborough Sports a week ago and looked for an immediate response with Jacob Hutchinson having a shot deflected behind and James Pardington safely holding a teasing cross from Diogo Freitas-Gouveia.\n\nAnd after a spell of Town pressure it was Hutchinson who again went close in the 18th minute as he surged down the inside right channel only to have his shot deflected behind off Dan Alessi.\n\nSoon after Vann showed his defensive qualities as he blocked a Freitas-Gouveia shot a point blank range and from the resulting corner Stephen Cawley swivelled to hit a thunderous volley against the inside of Pardington’s right hand post with the ball ricocheting away to safety.\n\nAs at Kings Langley Dan Sweeney was causing ;plenty of problems with his willingness to chase down everything but it had now developed into a pretty even game although Town almost doubled their lead on 35 minutes when Javia Roberts exchanged passes with Sweeney before shooting across goal from the right of the penalty area.\n\nHitchin went close to an equaliser a minute before half time when Alex Marsh seized on a poor punch from Pardington to shoot inches wide, but they were then stunned when Town immediately doubled their lead as from the subsequent goal kick Isaac raced away down the left and squared the ball across to Roberts who had the straightforward task of slotting past Horlock to emulate Vann with his first Town goal.\n\nBut it was Hitchin who quickest into their stride after the restart and Hutchinson had a great chance to pull one back seven minutes into the second half when he pounced on a mistake by Okito only for Pardington to plunge to his left to make the save.\n\nHitchin though now felt they were getting back into the game and on 57 minutes they duly did so when a Hutchinson header came back off the bar and following g scramble in the six yard box Cawley stabbed in the rebound.\n\nSuddenly it was a different game and after another Cawley attempt had been deflected behind Hitchin levelled it all up in the 66th minute when Hutchinson burst into the right of the penalty area and steered the ball through the advancing Pardington’s legs into the far corner.\n\nBut having been second best since half time Town came back to regain the lead in the 73rd minute when Sweeney flicked on a long clearance upfield for Leam Howards – who had only replaced Reece Flanagan moments earlier – to run on and skip round Horlock before rolling the ball into the empty net and become the third player of the evening to register his first Town goal.\n\nHitchin though were not done yet with Ben Walster not far away with a fiercely struck free kick and Kyle Rowley making a crucial block from another on-target Hutchinson effort.\n\nTown were now hanging on desperately and it all unravelled in the third minute of added time when Courtney Richards lunged in with a rash challenge some 20 yards out.\n\nAs the Town faithful held their breath fearing the worst Walster’s free kick cannoned against Pardington’s left hand post and Hutchinson reacted the quickest to lash the loose ball into the roof of the net.\n\nSTRATFORD : James Pardington, Dan Vann, Gedeon Okito, Courtney Richards (c), Dan Alessi, Kyle Rowley, Javia Roberts, Mo Sebbeh-Njie (Paul Douglas 78), Dan Sweeney, Reece Flanagan (Leam Howards 68), Kynan Isaac (Kyle Ambris 88).

Kaziboni had a shot blocked only for the ball to fall kindly to Jesse Akubuine who drilled it into the bottom corner from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nAnd on 30 minutes Diamonds doubled their lead courtesy of a horrendous mistake from Isaac who dithered fatally as he tried to deal with a long pass down the inside right channel. Kazibonmi pounced to nick the ball off him and slid it across to Acquaye who had the simple task of slotting it past the helpless Pardington.\n\nTown though were handed a lifeline out of nothing five minutes later when Sweeney wriggled into the penalty area where he as upended by Jack Ashton and got up to blast the spot kick past Ben Heath with the minimum of fuss.\n\nBack came Diamonds to force a succession of corners in the closing minutes of the half but their clearest chance fell to Nathan Hicks from a throw-in who could only hit a tame effort straight at Pardington.\n\nThe first opportunity after the break fell to Sweeney whose chip from the right drifted narrowly wide of the far post, and when play switched to the other end Kaziboni laid in a chance for Shariff whose shot was beaten away by Pardington.\n\nOn the hour mark Diamonds at last put a flowing move together only for it to be was wasted by the overlapping Casey who blazed wildly over, but they regained their two goal advantage three minutes later from the most unlikely of scorers.\n\nSam Brown launched a long throw from the right and the imposing centre back and skipper Liam Dolman climbed to direct a back header beyond Pardington into the far corner.\n\nBut a couple of minutes later only some heroic Diamonds defending prevented Town getting back into the game as Heath blocked Sweeney’s shot at point blank range and then Brown somehow got back to clear Roberts’ follow-up effort off the line.\n\nOn 70 minutes though Diamonds put the result beyond doubt when Kaziboni’s shot was parried by Pardington and substitute Ben Farrell who had only come on two minutes earlier reacted the quickest to sweep the loose ball into the empty net..\n\nBut Town and Sweeney were not quite finished yet and on 78 minutes the striker fired in a screamer from all of 25 yards out which rocketed past the motionless Heath for his fourth goal in three appearances.\n\nMuch to Town’s concern Sweeney limped off with five minutes to go but by then Diamonds had the points in the bag and saw out the remainder of the game in relative comfort.\n\nSTRATFORD : James Pardington, Dan Vann, Kynan Isaac, Courtney Richards, Dan Alessi, Kyle Rowley (Charles Ten-Grotenhuis 75), Lewis Wilson (c) (Gedeon Okito 78), Mo Sebbeh-Njie, Dan Sweeney (Kai Woollard-Innocdent 85), Reece Flanagan, Javia Roberts.

There was a new keeper in James Partington who is on loan from Wolves and played for them against Town in the Birmingham Senior Cup earlier in the season, while Ross Oulton returned in place of Mo Sebbeh-Njie.\n\nBut the talking point was yet another return to Town’s squad of the prodigal Kynan Isaac after spells at North Leigh and Banbury United and he went straight into the starting line-up at the expense of Lewis Wilson.\n\nInevitably given their current form both sides made a cautious start with the only serious goal attempt in the opening ten minutes being a decent long range effort from Sweeney who was to add some much needed bite to Town’s attack throughout the evening.\n\nBut Town soon squandered two gilt edged chances to take the lead. On 17 minutes Dan Vann somehow headed wide from a Reece Flanagan left wing corner when completely unmarked at the far post, and a couple of minutes later Dan Alessi blazed over when the ball fell kindly to him after a free kick.\n\nA promising run down the right by Roberts ended with a low cross which was gathered by Reds keeper Kieran Boucher at the second attempt followed by Isaac having a shot blocked and then Sweeney seemingly being clean though only to lift his shot over both Boucher and the bar.\n\nBut Town at last made the breakthrough just after the half hour mark when Sweeney was bundled over by Ronnie Hendricks with referee Ryan Williams immediately pointing to the spot and Sweeney getting up to blast the kick past Boucher.\n\nSweeney was now really buzzing and five minutes before the break he had a header cleared off the line by Tyreece Kennedy-Williams and from the subsequent corner Oulton’s diving header flashed narrowly over.\n\nA Roberts shot was held by Boucher low to his right in added time, but Town reached half time only one up in spite of having all the possession and all the chances.\n\nThe Reds forced an early corner after the restart with Gratias Katega having their first shot of the evening so far, but Town hit back with Oulton firing over and Isaac streaking down the left to deliver a cross which flew beyond both Sweeney and Flanagan.\n\nBut it was from another set piece in the 58th minute that Town came closest to doubling their lead when Boucher plunged to his left to push away a Flanagan free kick after Isaac had been brought down right on the edge of the penalty area.\n\nA perfectly timed tackle from Josh Endall snuffed out a surge into the penalty area by the busy Sweeney in the 65th minute and soon after Roberts shot into the side netting after cutting in from the right.\n\nBoucher then had to tip over s cross-cum-shot from Vann and a fiercely struck left foot drive fizzed inches wide, but with only a quarter of an hour to go there was still only one goal in it.\n\nAnd the Reds had their best chance yet to level on 77 minutes when Luke Shearer found himself with time and space on the left only to fire into the side netting.\n\nBut three minutes later Town effectively put the result beyond doubt when Flanagan’s corner from the right caused mayhem in the Reds six yard box and Sweeney pounced to lash the loose ball into the roof of the net.\n\nSweeney then had a hat-trick attempt easily dealt with by Boucher who also saved from Wilson as Town comfortably saw the rest of the game out to clinch a vital win with the added bonus of their second clean sheet of the campaign as well.\n\nSTRATFORD : James Partington, Dan Vann, Kai Woolard-Innocent, Courtney Richards, Dan Alessi, Kyle Rowley, Kynan Isaac, Ross Oulton, Dan Sweeney, Reece Flanagan (Mo Sebbeh-Njie 86), Javia Roberts (Lrwis Wilson 78) Unused Subs – Will Davidson, Gedeon Okito & Charles Ten-Grotenhuis\n\nREDDITCH : Kieran Boucher, Tyreece Kennedy-Williams, Ronnie Hendricks, Ben Stokes (Josh Harris-James 68), Josh Endall, Ben Birch, Gratias Katega, Tom Rankin, Brandon Diau, Jaden Owosu-Nepaul (Randane Larmond 73), Luke Shearer.

– LEAGUE\n\nDOUBLE DELIGHT FOR THE GLASSBOYS\n\nStratford Town – 1 – Flanagan 20\n\nStourbridge – 2 – Nicholls 33 Tonks 42\n\nMatch Report by Bryan Hale\n\nAlthough they took a 20th minute lead Town slipped to their seventh defeat in a row as Stourbridge hit back to lead at half time, and in spite of a spirited second half performance Paul Davis’ side couldn’t find an equaliser as the Glassboys followed up their win in the reverse fixture back in August to complete the seasonal double and reignite their play off prospects.\n\nYet again there was a scattering of new names on the Town teamsheet with Dan Alessi, Reece Flanagan, David Neligwa and Dan Sweeney taking the number of Town debutants in the three games since the turn of the year to ten and the overall total of players used by Town this campaign to a bewildering 58 – already more than the 54 of last season.\n\nAlessi is an Australian defender who is also registered with National League North side Hereford while midfielder Flanagan joins from Rushall Olympic, wide player Neligwa is on a dual registration with Kidderminster Harriers and Sweeney arrives on loan from Solihull Moors after completing a previous loan spell at Gloucester City.\n\nAlessi, Flanagan and Sweeney were all in the starting line-up replacing Abdou Diakhate, the suspended Ross Oulton and the departed Chris Wreh while Neligwa was on the subs bench.\n\nA further change from the Needham Market game was in goal where Sam Lomax returned for Jack Bennett.\n\nAs expected the Stourbridge squad included ex-Town favourites Cody Fisher, Will Grocott and Jordan Williams.\n\nNeeding a win to get their play-off ambitions back on track after back-to-back losses the Glassboys made a lively start forcing a first minute corner followed by Kristian Green firing in a low drive from the right which was only held by Lomax at the second attempt.\n\nThe Town keeper was more confident in dealing with a Williams header before Town had a great chance to open the scoring in the tenth minute when Sweeney latched onto a long ball from Mo Sebbeh-Njie to home in on goal down the inside right channel only to have his shot blocked by the recovering Ashley Carter.\n\nSweeney wasted another opportunity on 17 minutes when a Javia Roberts pass left him with only Charlie Price to beat but the keeper was smartly off his line and spread himself well to block the shot.\n\nBut suddenly Town were buzzing and three minutes later Roberts had his effort charged down and the ball fell kindly to Flanagan who thumped it past Price from ten yards out.\n\nThe Glassboys looked to respond with Green whipping in another rasping drive from the right but found it hard to break down a resolute Town defence until the 33rd minute when Grocott floated over one of his trademark crosses from the right and Alex Nicholls gave Lomax no chance with a close range header.\n\nSoo after Price dealt comfortably with a Roberts shot while at the other end Grocott wasn’t far away with a decent effort from 20 yards out, but the Glassboys grabbed the lead three minutes before the break when Kai Woollard-Innocent dithered over a clearance allowing Williams to nick the ball off him and lay it off for Anthony Dwyer to slip it across to Tom Tonks who had the simple task of firing past Lomax from the edge of the six yard box.\n\nAnother Woollard-Innocent mistake five minutes after the restart set up an opening for Nicholls who could only blaze wide followed by Dwyer shooting straight at Lomax and then hitting a curling effort inches past Lomax’s left hand ;post\n\nTown threatened in a breakaway on the hour mark only for Price to sprint out of his area to beat Roberts to the ball, but Nicholls was proving difficult for the Town backline to deal with and on 68 minutes he laid on a chance for Tonks whose shot ricocheted away off a defender.\n\nBut Town almost conjured an equaliser out of nothing in the 70th minute when Sweeney twisted and turned to make room for a shot on the edge of the penalty area which Price only held at the second attempt.\n\nAnd he went even closer a minute later when his header from a Tom Mehew free kick was acrobatically tipped over by Price.\n\nTown were keeping going and when Stourbridge struggled to clear a corner with ten minutes to go Kyle Rowley let fly with a well struck right footer which flew narrowly wide.\n\nStourbridge though continued to be a threat and only a perfectly timed tackle from Alessi in the last minute of normal time prevented Glassboys substitute Andre Landell going clear immediately after coming on as they saw the game out to take the points.\n\nSTRATFORD : Sam Lomax, Dan Vann, Kai Woolard-Innocent (Will Davidson 90 + 4), Courtney Richards, Dan Alessi,

Mo Sebbeh-Njie, who was part of last season’s play-off squad has returned from a spell at Kettering Town, while there was a Town debut for Senegalese defender Abdou Diakhate who has latterly been on loan from Parma at Belgian club Lokeren.\n\nDropping to the subs bench to make way were Gedeon Okita and Tom Mehew.\n\nEarly attempts from Lewis Wilson and Ross Oulton flew wide but Needham went closer in the fifth minute with a fiercely struck left footer from Will Hunt being deflected behind off Diakhate followed by the offside flag halting a threatening run from Adam Mills.\n\nA foul by Dan Vann on Sam Squire five yards outside the penalty area offered Needham a better chance but Heath hit the free kick straight into the Town wall, and as Needham continued to press forward Jack Bennett pulled off a smart close range save from the lively Hunt to keep the scores level.\n\nAnother decent save from Bennett getting down low to his right once again prevented Hunt from firing Needham into the lead, before in a rare Town foray upfield Javia Roberts had a shot ricochet behind and from the corner a Chris Wreh cross fizzed inches wide.\n\nOn 35 minutes a mistake by Sebbeh-Njie gave the ball away to Mills only for Heath to fire wildly over from his pinpoint cross, but a couple of ,minutes later Needham should have gone ahead when Mills found himself with time and space in the penalty area to shoot past Bennett only for Kyle Rowley to somehow get back and clear the ball off the line.\n\nTown had another escape five minutes before the break when Mills picked out Russell Short whose low drive from 20 yards out was pushed away by Bennett plunging to his left with Kai Woollard-Innocent in the right place to complete the clearance.\n\nSoon after a poor Bennett punch from a Squire cross led to a bit of a scramble on the penalty spot before the ball was booted away as half time was reached with afternoon still goalless.\n\nDiakhate was replaced by Otaki for the restart and he slotted in at left back with Lewis Wilson taking over in the centre of the backline meaning that it was the same back four as against Rushall while Woollard-Innocent switched into midfield.\n\nBut Needham continued to have most of the possession and Mills squandered another opportunity from a Joe Marsden cross and a driven-in Heath centre from the left was just out of Hunt’s reach at the far post.\n\nAs the pressure intensified Wilson did well to hook away another Marsden cross and Courtney Richards blocked a rasping Hunt effort at point blank range.\n\nAt the other end Wreh’s persistence halfway through the half earned a corner which came to nothing back came Needham with a Callum Sturgess free kick which didn’t miss by much.\n\nBy now Needham were beginning to run out of ideas and their frustration was increasing both on and off the pitch with Town pulling everyone back except Wreh as they battled to see the game out.\n\nWith eight minutes to go Mills had another effort deflected behind and Town had got through to the final minute of normal time when it all went wrong. Vann was adjudged to have handled the bouncing ball as went in to challenge Hunt and Marsden blasted the spot kick past Bennett with the minimum of fuss.\n\nSTRATFORD : Jack Bennett, Dan Vann, Kai Woolard-Innocent, Courtney Richards, Abdou Diakhate (Gedeon Otaki 46), Kyle Rowley, Lewis Wilson, Mo Sebbeh-Njie (Tom Mehew 61), Chris Wreh, Ros Oulton (Shiloh Remy 78), Javis Roberts Unused Subs – Rheiss McLean & Will Davidson\n\nNEEDHAM : Marcus Garnham, Joe Marsden, Callum Sturgess, Russell Short, Keiran Morphew, Dan Morphew, Sam Squire (Jake Dye 83), Gareth Heath (c), Will Hunt (Jamail Godward 90 + 1), Luke Ingram (Craig Parker 67), Adam Mills.

Having received an early yellow card in the game’s opening minutes for a typically wholehearted challenge he now lunged in again and the second yellow followed by the mandatory red was inevitable.\n\nFour minutes later the result was put beyond doubt when Pics substitute Levi Rowley neatly controlled a Charlton cross from the left to steer it past Bennett, and all they had to do from then on was close the game out which they managed without any really serious alarms.\n\nMcLean did pull one back for Town as the game headed into added time after good work from Wreh but it was too little too late, and with Leiston beating Needham Market in the afternoon’s early kick off Town have now slipped into the bottom four as their situation becomes increasingly desperate.\n\nSTRATFORD : Jack Bennet, Dan Vann, Kai Woolard-Innocent (Rheiss McLean 64), Courtney Richards, Gedeon Okito, Kyle Rowley, Lewis Wilson, Ross Oulton, Chris Wreh, Tom Mehew (Charles Ten-Grotenhuis 80), Javis Roberts (Shiloh Remy 80) Unused Subs – Matt Bower & Will Davidson\n\nRUSHALL : Jonathan Platt, Mitchell Clarke, Asa Charlton, Dan O’Callaghan (Levi Rowley 62), Sam Whittall, Orrin Pendley, Dan Waldron, Alex Moore, Basa Sawyers (Kieran Cook 64), Jonathan Letford, Richard Batchelor.

However it all changed in the 26th minute. Town gave the ball away midway in their own half, Pablo Haysham played in Morgan Roberts on the left flank, who cut in and drilled a strike into the net from 22 yds to beat keeper Sam Lomax at his near post, a poor goal to concede. Stratford did have a chance to get back on level terms just before the break, when Kyle Rowley put in a cross which Matt Bower headed goal wards but was denied by a goal line clearance and Mehews follow up shot was saved by Harding.\n\nAt the start of the second half the status quo remained, but it was all change again on the hour mark as the Puritans scored three times in 7 minutes and it was game over. Shamsi disposed Bower on the edge of the box and lobbed Lomax to make it 2-0, John Mills, who had only just come off the bench, was allowed to weave his way into the area and his strike was deflected to wrong foot Lomax to make it 3, and Morgan Roberts powered in a header for his second goal on 67 minutes to make it 4-0. It was now a despondent Town who offered little in reply. With only one striker up front all Chris Wreh was doing was chasing long balls. With a minute left Mills should have made it 5 but with the gaol gapping he hit the post from 8yds out, but Banbury did go nap in stoppage time when Giorgio Rasulo converted a free kick from the edge of the box to make it 5. All Town could offer in reply was a Wreh shot that went wide and an effort from Shiloh Remy that Harding saved with his legs.\n\nStratford are now well entrenched in the bottom 5, and from their last 12 league games have only managed 4 points from a possible 36, that is relegation form, but where will Town get their next points from with tough games coming up, against Rushall Olympic, Needham Market, and Stourbridge. The only good news from the Boxing Day results is that the 4 teams below Stratford in the League could only manage 1 point between them. However Stratford cannot rely on other teams losing, as they have to get points to get to safety.\n\nStratford Town.

Bristol Rovers loanee Tom Mehew replaced Jordan Clement in midfield while Will Davidson, who featured under Tommy Wright in pre-season, came in at right back with the reshuffle resulting in Dan Vann switching to left back and Kai Woollard-Innoncent moving forward into midfield with Kyle Ambris dropping to the subs bench.\n\nThe Pitmen were looking to reinforce their challenge for a play-off spot and went close to taking the lead in only the fifth minute when Elliott Hodge had his low drive cleared off the line by Kyle Rowley..\n\nWhen play switched to the other end Chris Wreh found space in the penalty area to make room for a shot which was deflected behind, but Hednesford were soon back on the attack with Town keeper Sam Lomax pulling off a smart save at the foot of his right hand post from an Osebi Abadaki and then recovering quickly enough to beat away Reece King’s effort from the rebound.\n\nAnother King attempt fizzed inches wide and apart from an occasional run from Wreh most of the action was taking place in the Town half.\n\nTown though gradually began to settle and in the 25th minute Mehew showed his quality with a break from halfway to play in Wreh who was promptly crowded out.\n\nMehew was certainly not lacking in confidence and on the half hour mark he tried his luck with a shot from all of 30 yards out which wasn’t all that far wide.\n\nBut the Pitmen continued to have the better of the possession and only some resolute defending by Matt Bower and Rowley made sure that Town reached half time with the afternoon still goalless.\n\nTown then had a great chance to take the lead in the opening minute of the second half when skipper Lewis Wilson’s driven-in cross from the right reached Mehew whose shot ricocheted behind off keeper Andrew Wycherley.\n\nHednesford soon regained their composure but as they struggled to create a clearcut opening against Town’s well organised defence their frustration increased both on and off the pitch.\n\nDan Glover had a 67th minute shot on the turn flash inches over followed by James Hurst firing straight at Lomax from 25 yards out but it all went wrong for Town in the 70th minute when Abakadi surged into the penalty area down the inside left channel and was upended by Lomax as he raced out to challenge.\n\nReferee Marks immediately pointed to the spot and Glover lashed it past Lomax with the minimum of fuss.\n\nIt was always boing to be uphill for Town from then on and Glover should have added a second with ten minutes to go when he escaped down the right before blazing wide with only Lomax to beat.\n\nBut Town had the sniff of an equaliser a couple of minutes later when Wreh’s free kick was deflected behind and from the resulting corner Bower’s header glanced off a defender to clip the bar for another corner from which Rowley powered as header narrowly wide.\n\nHednesford though hung on to secure the three precious points which move them up to fourth in the table while Town’s sufferings which have seen them take only four points from their past eleven games continue on to Boxing Day at least.\n\nSTRATFORD : Sam Lomax, Dan Vann, Kai Woolard-Innocent (Kyle Ambris 87), Courtney Richards, Matt Bower, Kyle Rowley, Lewis Wilson, Foday Nabay (Matt Campbell-Mhliope 78), Chris Wreh, Tom Mehew (Jordan Clement 87), Will Davidson.

Broadhurst 67\n\nMatch Report by Bryan Hale\n\nTown went down to their second home defeat of the week but their performance was so much better than against Barwell in midweek and they made play-off chasing Sporting fight all the way before securing the points.\n\nTown’s starting line-up showed two changes from the Barwell debacle with Jordan clement and Kyle Ambris coming in for the departed Ravi Shamsi and Kyle McFarlane who has returned to parent club York City.\n\nThe Sporting team included the formidable duo of ex-Town strikers in Richard Gregory (78 goals in 120 games) and Mike Taylor (44 goals in 119 games) plus another former Town favourite Kieren Westwood on the subs bench.\n\nSporting were quickly on the attack with Matt Bower just beating Taylor to a Greg Mills left wing cross while Town responded with Sporting keeper Dan Platt having to sprint from his area to kick clear as Chris Wren chased down a long ball from Ambris.\n\nSporting soon began to have more of the ball and inevitably it was Gregory and Taylor who were involved when they went ahead on 13 minutes with Gregory chipping the ball over from the right and Taylor heading past Town keeper Sam Lomax.\n\nBut they were stunned when Town levelled six minutes later as Wreh latched onto a Lewis Wilson pass down the left and swept the ball beyond Platt into the far corner.\n\nAnd Sporting had a scare soon after when Tom Taylor’s headed backpass looped over Platt who had to turn and race back towards his goal before being fouled by Wreh to end the danger.\n\nBack came Sporting with Gregory having a 25th minute shot cleared off the line by Foday Nabay and Gift Mussa drilling the rebound inches wide.\n\nLomax then safely held a curling free kick from Jak Hickman followed by Dan Vann halting a dangerous run from Mills at the expense of a corner which was punched clear by Lomax, but with Wreh all on his own up front most of the action was taking place in the Town half.\n\nCrucial headers from Bower and Kyle Rowley then snuffed out further Sporting chances as half time was reached with the game still all square.\n\nThere was no change to the pattern of play after the restart with another Bower header dealing with a Gregory cross from the left before Town had a glorious chance to take the lead in the 51st minute when Wilson threaded the ball through to Wreh who strode clear only to shoot against the advancing Platt with Rowley then having a shot blocked as Sporting struggled to clear the resulting corner.\n\nWill Shorrock was beginning to make his presence felt down the Sporting left having a fiercely struck effort blocked by Bower and then going on a threatening run which was ended by a Courtney Richards foul with Hickman blasting the free kick wastefully wide.\n\nThe Sporting pressure was unrelenting, and on 67 minutes they regained the lead when Hickman’s left wing corner reached Leon Broadhurst at the far post who powered in a header from a couple of yards out.\n\nSporting went after a third which would surely put the result beyond doubt but Lomax pulled off two smart saves in quick succession to keep out decent efforts from Gregory and Josh Quaynor before they made a double substitution which included Westwood coming on and Mike Taylor going off.\n\nBut they went close to adding the much needed third goal with five minutes to go when Tom Taylor’s header from a Hickman free kick came back off the post although it wouldn’t have counted as the offside flag was already up.\n\nDan Atkins was then introduced for his debut at this level after impressing with F C Stratford this season and before that with the championship winning Town Youth team last season.\n\nSporting were now concentrating on seeing the game out but Wreh was still working tirelessly whenever Town launched the ball forward and deep into added time he surged down the inside right channel only to be upended by Tom Taylor a matter of inches outside the penalty area.\n\nGetting up to take the free kick himself he drilled it past the wall but agonisingly past the far post as well and Sporting had hung on for the win to consolidate their play-off spot while Town remain languishing at the wrong end of the table.\n\nThe reverse fixture isn’t scheduled until the final weekend of the season, and given the current form of the two sides it will be fascinating to see what might be at stake for either of them when that game eventually takes place.\n\nSTRATFORD : Sam Lomax, Dan Vann, Kai Woolard-Innocent, Courtney Richards, Kyle Rowley, Matthew Bower, Lewis

After his point saving heroics at St Ives Kyle McFarlane came in for Matt Campbell-Mhliope while Lomax replaced the unavailable Harvey White in goal.\n\nThe Barwell team included Jamie McAteer who was am mainstay of Town’s defence last term and Kai Williams who made a handful of appearances during the closing weeks of that campaign.\n\nIn front of the lowest Arden Garages Stadium crowd of the season Town could have been behind inside a minute when Zayn Hakeem latched onto a through ball down the inside left channel only to shoot against the advancing Lomax, and they had another let-off soon after when McAteer flicked an Eliot Putnam free kick inches wide,\n\nAnd as Barwell continued to boss the possession Matt Bower blocked a thunderous effort from Brady Hickey followed by Tristan Dunkley having an on-target attempt deflected behind.\n\nAnother long ball then caught out the entire Town backline but again Hakeem couldn’t make it count as Lomax got down well low to his left to push the shot away.\n\nChris Wreh looked lively when Town were able to push forward and went close in the 20th minute when he cut in from the right to fire narrowly wide while a couple of minutes later Town at last put a decent move together which saw Lewis Wilson whip in a low cross from the right which fizzed across the six yard box with no Town player close enough to apply the finishing touch.\n\nBut Barwell were soon retuned to the attack and deservedly went ahead in the 26th minute when Hakeem released Williams down the left and his low centre set up a simple tap in for Omotolani Omotola.\n\nAnd Town could easily have been two down shortly after with Dunkley and Hakeem both going close and Lomax pulling off another fine save to keep out a fiercely struck drive from Hickey.\n\nWith Town struggling to make any sort of impact Hickey’s cross from the left flew just beyond Hakeem and then some close control from Omotola on the right set up a shooting chance for Hakeem with Kyle Rowley in the right place to make the crucial block.\n\nBut having been second best so far Town levelled in the 45th minute when Ravi Shamsi swept the ball out to the overlapping Kai Woollard-Innocent on the left and then seized on Wollard-Innocent’s return cross to fire past the Barwell keeper Max Bramley from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nThere was still time before the interval for Lomax to again come out on top in a on"
