        "text": "Midland Red in the seventies was very much a company in crisis! The selling of the profitable West Midlands core to the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive-WMPTE- in December 1973 left a largely rural network (the operations in Leicester aside) which was making heavy losses. The company realised that this was unsustainable and embarked on what was called the Market Analysis Project (MAP-originally the Viable Network Project) which, on an area by area basis, subjected all of the company’s services to extensive checks and surveys to discover what actually paid it’s way and what didn’t. The results of the scheme have been viewed with a degree of controversy but, in my opinion, the fact remains that it enabled the network that remained to survive into the following decade, where commercial pressures were to become even more pressing. MAP also gave the company ammunition when approaching the relevant county councils about the need to subsidise loss making routes, should they desire to see them survive! And MAP was sufficiently successful for the National Bus Company (NBC) to spread it to most of their other subsidiaries.\n\nTellus\n\nEach area treated to MAP was given it’s own brand name to give a sense of more localised ownership to passengers. Some of the names used were quite obscure but the one chosen for services from Wellington garage, although derived from an obscure Roman God (Telford having quite a few Roman links, notably the fact that the main A5 through the middle of the town was originally the Roman’s Watling Street!), the name actually sounded similar to the name of the town itself! So, the 1st of April 1978 saw Tellus born! I remember seeing the publicity for it in the area’s weekly newspaper, the Telford Journal and, around a week before the network began, a timetable book, consisting of individual leaflets in a cardboard binder (very much a Midland Red thing back then!) arrived through our letterbox, as was the case with every house in Telford! Needless to say, after my parents had shown a cursory interest in the new routes serving our home estate of Woodside, I grabbed hold of it to study the contents with deep interest!\n\nThe new town was still growing at that point, particularly the estates of Stirchley, Randley & Hollinswood, which all required a better bus service than the hourly 947 plus recently introduced 948. But the other main feature of the new Tellus network was that Midland Red had managed to negotiate the take over of nearly all the independents stage services in the town, including all those who participated in the Shropshire Omnibus Association’s two rotas (Donnington & Wrockwardine)…….except one!\n\nReg Price was the proprietor of Excelsior Coachways, an operator with shares on the Wrockwardine Rota. All of his colleagues had been persuaded by the offer of a no doubt generous financial settlement (from the £3.6 Million that the company had received from the WMPTE sale) and the promise that Midland Red would reduce it’s Private Hire work from Wellington-something that was very much in line with company policy at that time, as it centralised it’s coach operations on three garages-Birmingham Digbeth (with that garage ceasing operation of stage services, including it’s shares on the X96, which transferred to Shrewsbury & Leicester around six months after the Tellus changes), Leicester Southgates and Cannock (the latter respecting the former Harper Brothers Private Hire business) with all other garages concentrating on bus work.\n\nBut Mr Price wasn’t tempted by any of this! So Midland Red promised him a share of the new network to keep him onside. All of the services on the former Wrockwardine Rota were to be integrated with services through the Town Centre to the South Telford estates, so Excelsior was given charge of the one bus 916 service from Wellington-Muxton Corner on the Donnington corridor (basically a short working of the 917 from Shrewsbury-Edgmond). This enabled Excelsior to buy a brand new bus for the route, a Duple Dominant bus bodied Leyland Leopard with the registration BAW 1T. Unusually, Excelsior’s operations were still crew operated at this time, as the service’s regular driver, a chap named Ivan, refused to go one man, a regular conductress continuing to be employed.\n\nThe other surviving independents would all now concentrate on contract and coach work, with three of them-Smith’s Britannia, H Brown & Martlews-merging to form Britannia International Travel, whilst A T Brown bought out neighbouring Trench based operator Smiths Eagle. It’s a sobering thought that, in 2017, A T Brown would be the only surviving operator left from the SOA days. Independents would still be visible at the Town Centre Bus Station, as Archways Shifnal Flyer was unaffected and Green Bus of Great Wyrley had also started running a Thursday service from Cannock (see blog “South Staffordshire Independents In The Eighties”) but aside from these slight incursions, Midland Red now reigned supreme on stage carriage services in Telford!\n\nThe new network was barely recognisable from what was there before! On the Wellington-Donnington corridor, the 916 & 917 were joined by new services 914 & 915 (creating a fifteen minute Wellington-Donnington frequency), which carried on from Donnington to Telford Town Centre via Oakengates, replacing parts of H Brown’s services between these points. The rest of H Brown’s Town Centre-Donnington group were replaced by new services 933 (via Wombridge Road) & 934 (via St Georges) and the 932/936 Circular (via Church Road and also replacing the 947 between Oakengates & Hadley.) The Wellington-Oakengates corridor also gained a combined fifteen minute frequency, consisting of new services 901, 920 & 921. The half hourly 921 carried on beyond Oakengates via St Georges to the Town Centre, then replaced the 946 through Mallinslee to Dawley and onwards to Madeley and circling Woodside in a clockwise loop via Madeley’s West End (Park Street) and the Woodside Perimeter Road, becoming a 901 or 920 at the Elizabethan pub, then returning to Wellington via Madeley, Brookside, then each route travelling through either side of Stirchley & Randley before joining together to run through Hollinswood to the Town Centre, from where the 901 replaced the former Smiths Britannia 41 route to Oakengates via Overdale, wheras the 920 replaced the 946 via Old Park & the Ketley Bank estate, both then joining forces with the 921 for the run to Wellington. I’ve often wondered why these routes were numbered as they were, as the 901 & 920 had far more in common with each other than with the 921. Surely it would have been more logical for the 901 & 921 to have been given the other’s number?\n\nThe 901, 920 & 921 replaced the 898 & 946 as my local routes, though the peak 895/896 Wellington-Ironbridge Circular carried on unchanged (until November 1979, when they were withdrawn). On nearby Sutton Hill, the 942 (by it’s end, a Saturday only service) and 947 were replaced by new routes 907 & 908. The 907 ran via Madeley, Little Dawley (replacing the 946) and Dawley, from where it replaced Ashley’s 31 via Eyton Road, Town Centre & Overdale to Wellington. The 908, meanwhile, pretty much followed the 942 route (though the 908 would run daily) via Dawley, though took a shorter path around Brookside and served the Dawley Bank area, previously served by Ashley’s irregular 32 from the Town Centre-Wellington. Incidentally, thank you to comments in Part One from Douglas, who informed me that Ashley’s had run a Thursday only service from Mallinslee into Wellington, which was probably the origins of the 32.\n\nOther, more rural routes taken over from the independents were H Brown’s Wellington-Humbers via Horton service, which became Midland Red’s 918, with a diversion into the new Leegomery estate, H Brown’s Oakengates-Market Drayton Wednesday service became the 938 and the Hinstock-Newport Friday service became the 939. Ashleys Wellington-Cressage service became the 940. Other long distance services in the Telford area were unaltered, although the same date saw the X96 getting rerouted on it’s eastern side via the new M69 Motorway that linked Coventry & the M6 to Leicester, in lieu of Lutterworth and the M1. So the 893 was still my link to Wolverhampton and the X96 to Birmingham.\n\nTo operate the bulk of the new network, Midland Red allocated twenty brand new Leyland Nationals (683-702, although 702 didn’t actually enter service until May 1978) to Wellington. Another three of the same batch (717-719) would enter service later in the year (718 & 719 in July, 717 in August) whilst 703 would also enter service from the garage as late as March 1979, meaning a grand total of twenty four of this batch (designated N8 by Midland Red) would be operating the Tellus network. I got to ride on them quite frequently during that first month, thanks to a 10p Adult, 5p child promotional fare throughout Telford throughout the month of April to promote the new network. Unlike the previous Leyland Nationals that I’d travelled on back in the West Midlands, these were of the Phase Two variant (not to be confused with the later Mk 2!) which featured smaller roof pods (the National roof pod was where the bus’s heating system was housed), a tanned interior colour scheme (as opposed to the previous white) and slightly less of a clattering engine noise from the turbo charged Leyland 510 engine! They replaced ex BMMO saloons, leaving just the later BMMO S23s to represent the good old days of Midland Red building their own buses, which tended to operate on the more rural routes alongside the Fords, leaving the Dual Purpose Willowbrook (S24) & Marshall (S27 & S28) bodied Leyland Leopards for longer routes such as the 893.\n\nUnlike most of the other MAP networks though, the growth of the new estates plus the takeover of the independents routes actually saw the Wellington fleet expand quite dramatically! To accommodate the extra fleet, the B91 Bridgnorth Town Service (Sydney Cottage-The Grove), which had traditionally been operated by Wellington, was transferred to Ludlow (returning to Wellington when Ludlow closed in May 1983) whilst a yard was rented at the nearby Smithfield cattle market (now a Morrisons) in Wellington to provide extra parking space for the increased allocation. This lasted until land was acquired in 1985 at the back of Wellington garage, enabling a new yard to be constructed.\n\nApril 1979\n\nThe new network settled down well enough and April 1979 bought a few tweaks. The biggest change was the splitting up of the 932/936 circular, with the 932 becoming a Town Centre-Donnington via Church Road service, whilst the 936 covered the Town Centre-Hadley via Oakengates section, extending beyond Hadley to Wellington via Leegomery, giving the growing estate it’s first Monday-Saturday service, as the 918 only ran on certain days of the week. A couple of revisions also bought more buses to my estate of Woodside! The original Tellus revisions had seen our service to Ironbridge reduced from three buses an hour (on the 893, 898 & 946) to just the one on the 893. To provide a more convenient service on Ironbridge Market Day, an experimental, Friday’s only 897 was introduced running from Woodside-Ironbridge. I remember seeing it quite regularly, as Friday afternoons was when my year at school (the Abraham Darby) played cricket that year and I would be idly lounging about the sports field, whilst fielding (spectacularly failing to catch any balls!) and taking note of any passing buses, including the S27 or S28 Leyland Leopard that had been allocated to the 897 that day! Regrettably, the service failed to make the grade and was withdrawn after the experimental six months. Of more lasting benefit was the rerouting of the 907 (and Sunday 908) between Madeley & Little Dawley via the new Aqueduct estate (which caused the renaming of the old, nearby village of Aqueduct as Aqueduct Village!), which was beneficial to me as it meant the routes had to serve my local bus stop at Waverley Island, giving me a more direct bus to the Town Centre & Wellington than the 901/920/921.\n\n1979 also saw more new Leyland Nationals allocated to Wellington, with the arrival of 766-769. They entered service in November of that year and 766/767 & 769 were immediately noticeable by the seat PVC being coloured a dark brown, as opposed to the previous light brown, a specification introduced throughout the National Bus Company on Nationals and Bristol VRs at that time (with Leyland Olympians featuring it later). 768, however, was the most notably different, as it’s seating featured an orange moquette similar to that then featuring on West Midlands PTE’s new Metrobuses, though 768’s seats were surrounded on either side by the dark brown PVC.\n\nHotspur\n\nMAP came to the rest of Shropshire in November 1979, with the introduction of the Hotspur network from Shrewsbury & Ludlow, as well as the adoption of the Hotspur fleetname for the rural services operated out of Wellington. Basically, that meant that only the Nationals retained the Tellus fleetname, with the Fords, remaining BMMO S23s and the S24 Willowbrook bodied Leyland Leopards receiving the new Hotspur name. The S27/S28 Marshall bodied Leopards were painted in NBC’s poppy red & white local coach livery and retained just Midland Red fleetnames. Scholars of the works of William Shakespeare incidentally, will recognise Hotspur as being the nick name of Sir Henry Percy (known as Harry Hotspur) the main antagonist in “Henry The Fourth Part One” a major player in the Battle of Shrewsbury in the fifteenth century!\n\nNeedless to say, whereas Wellington’s country routes had been scarcely affected by the Tellus changes, the Hotspur changes saw them totally revamped. Most notably, the X96 was split in Birmingham, with the Leicester side becoming the X66. The Shrewsbury side also saw a major rerouting. Extra stops were inserted along it’s A5 route to serve the small villages along there, plus a stop on the main road through the Admirals Estate in Shifnal. To be honest, I only saw one of these stops actually used by passengers once during the four years of their existence! From Shifnal, the X96 then replaced the 891 route to the Town Centre, then ran down the dual carriageway Eastern Primary Road to the edge of Stirchley, before traversing the 893 routing around Brookside and heading into Madeley before circling around Woodside (including my local bus stop!) and heading down into Ironbridge, from where it replaced the 893 to Shrewsbury via Buildwas. The two hourly frequency was retained as far as Ironbridge, with a Wellington turn being introduced to operate the Ironbridge shorts, these being operated by an S27 or S28 until the arrival of Plaxton bodied Leyland Leopard 680, transferred from Cannock (where it was displaced by new Willowbrook bodied Leopards for the X30/X31) in July 1980. The through Shrewsbury journeys (four per day) continued to be operated by that garage, which found it’s regular Plaxton bodied Leopard allocation of 465, 466 & 467 added to with 681 & 682, coming from Cannock at the same time as 680 reached Wellington.\n\nThe 891 was cutback to just run between Wolverhampton & Albrighton, still being operated by Cannock garage (that had replaced Cradley Heath in 1977.) The 893, meanwhile, was totally revamped into two new, two hourly services, the 892 & 893. Both routes followed the previous 893 routing from Wolverhampton to the Halesfield Industrial Estate, from where the 892 ran via Sutton Hill into Madeley and the 893 ran direct to the latter village (shortly after, the 893 would be rerouted via Sutton Hill as well). From Madeley, both services took different routes to Wellington, the 892 following the new X96 route to the Town Centre (though soon afterwards it was rerouted away from the Eastern Primary Road to serve Stirchley, Randley & Hollinswood) then onto Wellington via Oakengates. The 893, meanwhile, ran via Woodside to Ironbridge, then replaced the 904 to Wellington via Coalbrookdale & Dawley. From Wellington, both routes joined together again and replaced the 917 to Shrewsbury, the latter being cutback to terminate at Wellington with just a peak journey to/from Shrewsbury still remaining. The 917 also lost it’s Tibberton journeys at the other end of the route, with all journeys terminating at Edgmond. All journeys on the 892 & 893 continued beyond Shrewsbury Bus Station to the Copthorne Hospital, the main hospital complex for Shropshire, including Telford in the days before the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford opened. Shrewsbury & Wellington both had shares on the 892 & 893. The 923 & 924 Shrewsbury Hospital services, as well as the Sunday 894 Wolverhampton Hospital service, were withdrawn.\n\nThe revised X96 no longer ran on Sundays, so Sunday journeys on the 893 revived the route taken by the original X96 and extended on a limited stop basis from Wolverhampton-Birmingham via Dudley & Bearwood. This was very handy for reaching my Grandparents in Smethwick, as you could change in Bearwood onto a WMPTE 450!\n\nI’ve just mentioned that the rerouted 893 replaced the 904 through Coalbrookdale, this was because the former hourly Mon-Sat service from Much Wenlock-Wellington was reduced to a Tuesday only shoppers service from Much Wenlock-Telford Town Centre. A Much Wenlock-Wellington link was maintained on Thursdays, as the 940 from Cressage was extended to start/finish at Much Wenlock. Other services to disappear included the 895/896, the Wellington Town services, the 909 being extended from Wellington-Admaston to replace the W47 & W48 (as well as the 891), whilst the Saturday only W42 to Arleston and the W51/W52 Holyhead Road Circular were withdrawn without replacement, as was the 939 Friday service from Hinstock-Newport.\n\nSeptember 1981\n\nThe early eighties would prove to be tough times for Telford, as the economic recession bit hard into the town’s industrial estate dominated economy. This would have an effect on bus usage, resulting in a major service revision in September 1981. This was planned by Midland Red but would actually be introduced by new company Midland Red North, after the large Midland Red was split into separate units on 6th September 1981 (see the “Splitting Red” series of blogs). What was particularly noticeable was that the services in the new network would break with Midland Red convention by not using the 89x/9xx route numbers traditionally used by Midland Red in the Shropshire area. Replacing these would be a new single/double digit number series that, it was claimed by the company to be simpler for the general public to understand (something that many operators have been trying more recently, proving that there isn’t a new idea under the sun!)\n\nService 1 replaced the 914/915 between Wellington & the Town Centre, combining these into a common route, then carrying onto Dawley replacing the 921 through Mallinslee.\n\nThe 2 was basically the 917 renumbered.\n\nThe 3 was mostly operated by Excelsior, as it replaced the 916 but terminated at Donnington Roundabout (previously served by the 915) in lieu of Muxton Corner. Excelsior’s regular bus, Duple Dominant bus bodied Leyland Leopard BAW IT, still carried the blinds for the 916, however!\n\nThe 4 & 5 were peak only replacements for the 934 & 933 respectively, although complaints saw the 4 quickly become an all day hourly service.\n\nThe 6 was a new service which covered several gaps left by the new network in North Telford. It ran from Wellington leaving the town via Dothill before heading for Leegomery & Hadley. It then headed along the Trench Road before replacing the 932 down Church Road and onto Oakengates, from where the 6 replaced the 901 as far as Overdale. Always thought it odd that the route didn’t then proceed to the Town Centre but this would have required an extra bus!\n\nThe 7 was the 907 renumbered, as to a degree was the 8 formerly the 908, though this service was very much reduced to a few journeys in early mornings, the peaks and some evening journeys. Dawley Bank would now be served more regularly by the rerouted 893.\n\nThe 9 was the 909 renumbered, minus the Hotspur inspired Admaston extension, that area being left to the various rural services to the north of Wellington, whilst the aforementioned 6 covered Dothill.\n\nThe 10 & 11 were the replacements for the main Wellington-South Telford via Town Centre corridor. Both ran along the main road from Wellington-Oakengates, the 10 then replacing the 921 to the Town Centre via St Georges, whilst the 11 served the Ketley Bank estate previously served by the 920, though then preceding direct to the Town Centre via the Eastern Primary as opposed to serving Old Park. From the Town Centre, both routes shared a new common route through Hollinswood, Randley & Stirchley, providing a greatly increased service to these estates. Most daytime 10s terminated at Stirchley, leaving the 11 to carry onto Brookside, Madeley and Woodside, alternate journeys proceeding either clockwise or anti clockwise around my estate, which had certainly suffered frequency wise!\n\nFinally, the 13 was an infrequent service from Wellington-Town Centre, operating via Leegomery & Hadley Park (replacing the withdrawn 918) before reaching Hadley, from where it provided a limited off peak service down Wombridge Road, replacing the 933 to Oakengates, then proceeding to the Town Centre via Old Park, replacing the 920.\n\nThe 892 was also rerouted between Oakengates & Wellington, replacing the 936 through Hadley & Leegomery, whilst the 893 was rerouted via Dawley Bank to replace the 908.\n\nMaximum Off Peak Fare\n\nDespite the generally negative outlook that the new network offered, more positive changes were on the way! The 1981 local council elections had seen the Labour Party gain control of Wrekin District Council, one of their election pledges being to provide funding to reduce bus fares! This was the era of Ken Livingstone’s “Fairs Fare” fare cuts in London and a similar scheme would take place in the West Midlands at the same time (see blog “My Early Wanderings Part Two”), these being based on the cheap fares policy of South Yorkshire County Council, which had held fares in that county at 1975 levels, at great cost to the local rate payer. The London & West Midlands fare cuts attracted a huge amount of media attention, being at odds with the Conservative government’s policy of spending restraint. Both these cases generated successful legal challenges (London’s from the Conservative Bromley Council, the West Midlands from the Conservative Solihull Council, plus locally based industrial concern GKN Sankey) which saw both operations return to higher fares before both rejigged their subsidies to stay within the law. Ultimately, of course, the Conservative Government would be the victor, as the 1985 Transport Act introduced deregulation and a more commercial outlook into bus operation.\n\nAway from these two high profile cases, Wrekin District Council quietly negotiated with Midland Red North a month’s trial of a 20p maximum fare within the borough from 09.30-15.30 Monday-Fridays. This was successful enough for the council to commit to funding a permanent 25p (15p child) maximum fare at the above times. This would later be extended to cover evenings from 18.00 and all day Sundays, though Saturday daytime fares would continue to be provided at the normal commercial rate. This saw an upturn in off peak loadings, which would signal some expansion over the next few years, some of it sponsored by Wrekin District Council. Coupled to this, Midland Red North’s lean, hungry new management structure was looking at ways to expand the business and various new initiatives throughout the company were started.\n\n1982 saw the start of a new, Thursday shopping service from Bridgnorth-Telford Town Centre numbered 944, as well as a new, two hourly service from Shrewsbury-Newport via the M54 & Telford Town Centre, with several journeys extending over Happy Days route 415 to Stafford. Numbered the X82, Shrewsbury operated the lion’s share of this route, with Wellington providing one bus, which operated some of the Newport shorts. This supplemented the hourly 2 from Wellington. The New Town’s last new estate, Shawbirch, to the east of Admaston, received it’s first bus service in this year, in the form of the 12 from Wellington. Shawbirch was originally intended to be the first of three estates to be built in this general area but the decline of the local economy, plus the amount of objections made concerning the fact that these estates would be built on land that is some of the highest quality agricultural land in the UK, lead to the plans for these estates being abandoned. All very sensible but it did leave Shawbirch out on a limb, a bit of an enigma in this otherwise extremely rural area. And, of course, it made the provision of a viable bus service rather costly but the company persevered with the 12, which also saw the return of an hourly service to Admaston.\n\nMore direct involvement by the council resulted in the introduction of the 16 Wellington Hopper service, which ran on Tuesdays & Thursdays (Wellington Market days) in a one way circular route around the town, bringing a bus service back to areas like Holyhead Road and the Arleston Estate, not served since the Wellington Town services were abandoned in 1979. This resulted in two other Hopper services being introduced, respecting local market days. These were the Wednesday Oakengates Hopper (the 18) and the Friday Dawley Hopper (17). Conversely, 1982 saw the final demise of the Fords, the last of these being replaced by the arrival of three ex Midland Red East Nationals, 556, 557 & 558, these dating from 1977. Before this, in 1981, Shrewsbury “N2” 1974 vintage Nationals 291 & 292 were allocated to Wellington, these being the first of the earlier phase one version of the National to be allocated to the garage, the more primitive suspension of these soon earning them the nickname “Rock & Rollers” amongst Wellington’s drivers! Another “Rock & Roller” would be added to the fleet in 1984, in the form of ex Stafford 272.\n\nCollege Days\n\n1983 was the year I left school and started studying on a Business Education Council course at what was known universally as Walker Tech but had actually just been renamed as the Telford College of Art & Technology. This was in Wellington, so meant a nice long bus ride each day! I used the 11, going on the 07.49 departure off Woodside and returning on the 15.49 off Wellington, joining the bus at the Bucks Head stop near to the college. Both of these journeys were extremely busy, though finding a seat in the morning, at the start of the route, was considerably easier than finding one in the afternoon! This was the time when I really began to enjoy living in Telford, as I now got to know the bus network intimately! It was also the period when I got to know several drivers, the first of which was John Morgan (sadly, re-editing this in early 2021, I’ve recently heard that John has passed away. Rest in peace, old friend), who spotted me wearing a bus badge when I boarded the 15.49 11 one afternoon (confession, one of my few regrets in life was wearing bus badges whilst at college! At the time, I thought it was the ultimate statement about who I was but I now realise it was a distinct disadvantage when it came to attracting the opposite sex!). We got to know each other fairly well over the coming few months and he invited me to join him on several evening trips to Bridgnorth on the 9 (the second portion of that 15.49 11) learning an awful lot about how the bus industry worked in the process, standing me in good stead for when I became a bus driver myself many years later!\n\nAnother positive development in 1983 was the July introduction of the X60 from Wellington-Nottingham via Dawley, Town Centre, non stop to Wolverhampton (not calling at Shifnal for a reason) then Cannock, Lichfield, Burton on Trent & Derby. Three journeys a day ran to Nottingham, two Wellington operated, with the third operated by Cannock and terminating at Telford Town Centre. Shorts by both garages to Lichfield made a roughly two hourly service on this section. Two extra Plaxton bodied Leyland Leopards, both in the new Midland Express livery (a joint venture by the four Midland Red companies-and United Counties-to coordinate the image of Limited Stop services, especially those to Birmingham) were allocated to Wellington. 738 arrived after Ludlow’s closure in May, whilst the X60’s introduction saw previously Hotspur liveried 458 arrive in July from Shrewsbury (having again being a Ludlow bus before closure). And that was another positive development! Midland Red North promoted it’s MAP brand names to main fleet name status, with the colours used for the brand’s publicity being introduced to the fleet name stripe. Tellus’s colour was violet, whilst Hotspur’s was light blue. A subtle change was that all Wellington buses would now be branded as Tellus, with Hotspur being used for just Shrewsbury & Ludlow buses. It was also around this time that the Stirchley terminating journeys on the 10 were extended around Brookside Perimeter Road.\n\nThe reason for the X60 not calling at Shifnal became apparent the following November, when the Telford Motorway M54’s extension to the M6 was opened and Midland Red North revamped it’s Limited Stop services accordingly, including the re-routing of the X60 via the new Motorway, this allowing the Cannock operated journeys to be extended from the Town Centre to Ironbridge via Dawley & Woodside. I’ve covered the first Saturday of the new services in my blog “M54-The First Day” so won’t go into too much detail here but basically, the X96 became a direct Birmingham-Shrewsbury service via M54, Telford Town Centre & Wellington, with a new, Wellington operated X95 (a number previously used for a 1981 introduced Wednesday shopping service to Wolverhampton & Birmingham) replacing the X96’s South Telford section, then replacing most 893s from Ironbridge-Wellington, this route being rerouted mainly via its original route to Shrewsbury via Buildwas. Some journeys remained via the Wellington route, however, including all Sunday journeys. The number of Sunday through journeys on here to Birmingham was also reduced, as the X96 regained a Sunday service, both routes interworking at each end. The X82 lost it’s Stafford journeys (as well as the Wellington duty) and was rerouted via Wellington to coordinate with the X96, these two replacing the 892 & 893 as the trunk A5 route to Shrewsbury, the Mon-Sat 892s being rerouted via High Ercall replacing most 922s, the 923 & 926. This was also coordinated with the 12 through Shawbirch. Two more Plaxton/Leopards, 681 & 741, were transferred from Shrewsbury-Wellington, both still in Hotspur livery, to help out with the new X95.\n\nAnother Hotspur liveried coach to arrive at Wellington was brand new Plaxton Paramount 3500 bodied Leyland Tiger 1510, sisters to 1508 & 1509 which were allocated to Shrewsbury. That garage had seen a coach unit established for Private Hire & Excursions in 1982, initially using second hand coaches from other NBC subsidiaries, and this concept was extended to Wellington, with 1510 soon joined by 741 and, repainted from recently applied Tellus livery, 680. But this new venture attracted attention from an operator with a long memory!\n\nBritannia\n\nBritannia International Travel had prospered since the deal with Midland Red back in 1978, this seeing the company concentrate on coach work, with the NBC subsidiary concentrating on stage work. But Britannia didn’t take kindly to Midland Red reintroducing a coach operation in the area! Consequently, Britannia applied, and successfully gained licences for two new stage services that served areas that had been poorly served by Tellus since the September 1981 revisions. The B1 ran from the Town Centre-Muxton Corner via Oakengates, Wombridge Road & Donnington, whilst the B2 ran from Wellington-Dawley via Overdale, Town Centre & Mallinslee. One bus was needed on each route to maintain an hourly frequency. Midland Red North’s response was immediate! The company applied, and gained licences for service 31 & 32, exactly duplicating the B1 & B2 and running at the same times. Both operators charged 25p fares all day and competition was intense, with Tellus taking a lead, probably due to the buses usually being in the lead. Ironically, Britannia used ex Midland Red Fords (6375 & 6376, plus ex Hoggins 2183) as well as two Willowbrook bus bodied Fords they’d owned for years, on the two routes.\n\nDuring this period, Britannia gained a temporary new employee…..me! Knowing my interest, the careers officer at college had arranged an interview for me for a Youth Training Scheme placement with the company (kids, ask your parents about YTS! It might make your eyes water!). I got to do both office work (fairly successfully!) and mechanics (a complete and utter disaster!) An interesting time, which involved a mammoth commute from Woodside to the company’s garage at Donnington, cleverly working in an Excelsior trip on the 3, as I was quite fond of BAW IT! It was during this time that the government issued it’s “Buses” white paper which became the blue print for the deregulation of the bus industry that occurred in October 1986. The company was very encouraged by this, believing that it’s competitive actions were the way forward! It was a major surprise then, when October 1984 saw the Minister of Transport, Nicholas Ridley withdraw Britannia’s licences for the B1 & B2! Quite why the minister’s actions so contradicted his vision of a brave, entrepreneurially new world, we’ll probably never know! But I do have a theory! Midland Red North were clearly winning the battle but Britannia had been carrying on with a degree of stubbornness, not preparing to admit defeat. If this had driven the whole company under, it would not have been a great advert for the proposed new order! Hence Ridley quietly removed any prospect of embarrassment! Just a thought but the only one that makes any sense of Ridley’s actions! That’s politicians for you!\n\nBut Britannia weren’t the only Telford independent suffering setbacks! Excelsior were also having problems. Now, my memory of this is at variance to the description in the Venture book “Shropshire Independents” so I’ll use this opportunity to describe the story as I know it! Reg Price retired in 1983, selling the business to a man named Burns, who had been involved with the Scottish operator Mackies of Alloa. Burns had big plans for the business, leasing two Joneckier bodied Leyland Tigers which gained the fleet name of Solitaire and launching a selection of European Tours, using these impressive new coaches. Now, everyone else in the Telford coach business at the time reckoned this was an extreme folly. He also gained a contract for tour operator Hoverland, gaining a coach in their livery.\n\nOne morning, I was surprised to find that my journey on the 3 wasn’t being operated by BAW IT but by a Duple Dominant Ford coach in the livery of Mackies of Alloa, which had been sent down south a few weeks previously. When I got to work, Mac, the garage foreman who I worked under, received a phone call from Ron Dean, the landlord of a pub next door to Excelsior’s garage in Wrockwardine Wood, whose son Bill was a Britannia driver, whilst Ron himself drove a morning school run for Excelsior and an afternoon school run for Britannia. He rang Mac up to tell him that he’d been denied access to the garage, as Reg Price had called in the balliefs owing to monies owed by Mr Burns! Most of the fleet was still owned by Price, including BAW IT and these were all taken away, with several being stored at Elcocks garage in Madeley. BAW IT would soon after be sold to Williamsons of Shrewsbury.\n\n“Come on Mark, we’ll go and have a nose!” Mac said, so off we went in his car to find the only vehicles still left were the Solitaire Tigers and the Hoverland coach (think it was a MAN). Pretty soon, the Mackies coach had also gone and the 3 was in the bizarre hands of the highly luxurious Tigers! Even these were short lived, with the lease owner repossessing them. Burns managed to acquire an ex Green Line AEC Reliance RP from the now defunct Heart of England Services, for use on the 3. But he managed to survive and Excelsior’s story doesn’t end here!\n\nNew Buses & More Changes!\n\nNew buses delivered to Wellington in 1984 consisted of three Duple Laser bodied Leyland Tigers (1601-1603) for the X60 & X95 and 1707, one of a batch of nine Duple Dominant service bus bodied Leyland Tigers delivered to Midland Red North (three-1701-1703, were allocated to Shrewsbury and were regular performers on the X82, 892, 893 and even some X96s.) 1707 was allegedly, originally marked down to go to Tamworth (with 1708 & 1709, 1704-1706 going to Stafford) but somehow, was mistakenly applied with a Tellus band! Being short of buses anyway, it was decided to allocate it to Wellington. It initially spent some time on the Bridgnorth Town service B91 but soon found a regular working on the X95 before someone from head office sent a message saying a more suitable vehicle should be allocated!\n\nSpring 1984 saw new service 19 commence, providing duplication for the ever busy service 7, running from Woodside-Town Centre via Majestic Way in Aqueduct. This interworked with the 6, which had now logically been extended to the Town Centre, the 19 justifying the use of the extra bus needed for the extension.\n\nSpring 1985, meanwhile, would see more changes. Free from Britannia competition, the 31 & 32 were withdrawn, the buses made spare being used on new services 33 & 34. The 33 ran from Donnington, replacing the 31 to the Town Centre via Wombridge Road, then carrying on to serve new private housing at Priorslee. The 34 meanwhile, ran from Wellington-Brookside via Dawley Bank & Dawley, providing a second bus an hour on this corridor, to help relieve the, at times over crowded 9. The 34 also restored an hourly service to Dawley Bank, allowing most X95s to revert to the main road through Lawley. The X95 also gained a Sunday service at this time (the summer of 1984 had seen three seasonal Sunday journeys introduced on the X95 running through to Warwick-see blog “Midland Red North Summer Sunday services”). This saw the Sunday 893 cutback to run between Wolverhampton & Ironbridge, with the Sunday 892 withdrawn.\n\nThe X60 was reduced to one through Wellington operated Nottingham journey a day, with the Lichfield shorts being withdrawn, though the peak Wolverhampton runs continued. A new, Stafford operated once weekly service from that town was the X81 to Telford Town Centre, which was relatively short lived. Also short lived was new works service 35 but this served a destination that was to ultimately change the fortunes of the Telford economy! This was the Maxell video plant, established in the north of the town and which proved to be a spring board for other electronics based companies to establish themselves in the town, providing jobs for those leaving school with qualifications in the rapidly expanding world of Information Technology! Telford’s future was now looking brighter! But I wasn’t to be a part of it!\n\nMy year at Britannia was swiftly heading towards it’s conclusion and I saw no future in the town for me. So it was agreed that I would move to my Grandparents in Smethwick, where I reasoned employment opportunities would be slightly greater (which would largely prove to be correct!). So early June saw my last day with Britannia. The following two weeks saw me using up the remaining validity of my Tellus ticket, saying farewell to various friends, including the Wellington drivers that I had got to know, as well as starting to shift various lighter belongings of mine over to my new home (the Tellus ticket allowed half price travel on services heading out of Telford). Finally, on my Tellus ticket’s last day, I left! Throughout that week, S28 Marshall Leopard 339 had been operating the same X95 turn and I planned to travel on the afternoon trip on that turn in the hope that it would continue to do so! That morning, I popped over to the Town Centre to buy an Explorer Ticket from the Tellus Travel shop, for use on the following Sunday to visit the Leicester Citybus Garage Open Day. Travelling back on an 11, I spotted 339 on that X95 turn’s morning trip in Stirchley, heading back towards Wellington! Success!\n\nSo it was that I boarded 339 at around 14.00, from what, for the previous nine years had been my local bus stop at Waverley Island. But it was to be my local bus stop no longer! Although I was to visit the town fairly regularly in future, both to visit my Parents and to ride on buses, I was leaving my life as a Telford resident for ever!\n\nTo Be Continued…………..!\n\nRegular readers may recall that last year, I made a trip to Leicester by service bus, using an Arriva Midlands £6.20 Daysaver for the vast majority of it! I’d been thinking of making a similar trip again when my Stourbridge Shuttle driving, bus industry commentating friend Phil Tonks mentioned that he’d got three Arriva Midlands E Daysavers stored on his phone which he needed to use! Now, he tried to use one of these on our last Arriva bash together (see blog “Around Shropshire with Phil!”) but had failed to transfer these successfully onto his new phone, the fact that Arriva had changed their App not helping, so he’d been forced to use hard cash instead! However, he’s now sorted his technical problems out and was ready to use his cyberspace purchases, so my suggestion of repeating the Leicester tour was seized enthusiastically.\n\nNow, on my last trip, I’d actually risen early enough to catch the first 110 from Sutton Coldfield-Tamworth at around 06.30, meaning I’d had to use the first NXWM route 5 journey from my home in West Bromwich. This option wasn’t open to Phil, as he lives right on the edge of the West Midlands conurbation, in deepest, darkest Wordsley, so we arranged to meet at the 110’s Birmingham terminus around 08.00. So I caught a crowded Midland Metro tram into Birmingham, contacting Phil via the Facebook app Messenger to inform him I was on my way. Rather surprisingly, he informed me that he’d just boarded NXWM Wright Streetdeck 3302 on the 9 at Stourbridge Bus Station, surprising because I was expecting him to be using the train! Still, no real problem! When I got to Birmingham, I contacted him again to see where he was, as, to save me hanging around town, I intended to get a bus up the Hagley Road myself to meet him coming inwards. He replied he was out at Lapal, just this side of Halesowen, so I walked around from the Bull Street tram stop onto Colmore Row, where I caught the once a day West Bromwich garage working on the otherwise Pensnett operated 140 to Dudley via Blackheath, operated today by Enviro 400 4957. I texted Phil again and he said he was now just approaching Bearwood, so I decided that the Ivy Bush in Edgbaston, would be the best place to alight from 4957 and wait for 3302. Upon arrival there, I crossed over the road, which was full of cars heading into the City Centre.\n\nAfter around five minutes, I could see four double deckers queuing by the Strathallen Hotel, consisting of three Platinum branded MMC E400s (two of which were on the 126, the other on the X10) with one of the five Wright Streetdecks in between the last two Platinums. I deduced correctly that this was 3302. The only trouble was the traffic was that slow, it took nearly another ten minutes for the bus to arrive at my stop! An electronic sign on the dual carriageway median strip stated that Belgrave Middleway, on the Middle Ring Road, was closed, which probably explained the reason for the congestion being so intense. I boarded 3302, said hi to Phil who was sitting on the front seat next to another passenger, and made my way further down the upper deck to find a spare seat. The fact that it was the Belgrave Middleway closure that was causing the trouble was sort of confirmed by the fact that we accessed the underpass under Five Ways Island (the junction with the Middle Ring Road) with ease and the rest of the journey to Colmore Row went very smoothly!\n\nWe now both decided that we needed sustenance before embarking on the main body of the bash, so we went for a bacon roll in the Square Peg Weatherspoons pub, watching the passing E400s on the 82 & 87 Dudley Road routes, as well as the Platinum MMC E400s that I normally found myself driving on Sutton services X3, X4, X5 & X14. Then, it was out onto Corporation Street to catch the next 110 to Tamworth, which was operated by Sapphire branded Enviro 400 4414. Phil successfully activated his E Daysaver, whilst I paid a much more traditional £6.20 in legal tender for a paper ticket!\n\nBefore last year’s bash, where the first 110 of the day had been a Wright Streetlite, the last time I’d been to Tamworth on the 110 was just after the route had been converted to Sapphire specification in 2014 (see blog “By Sapphire to Tamworth”) so it’s been a while. But of course, the first section of the route I’m very familiar with, as the run to Sutton parallels NXWM’s Birmingham-Sutton routes which, as I’ve mentioned, I drive (see blog “The Sutton Rota”). Of course, since then, the Sutton routes have been converted to “Platinum” status (and later renumbered) meaning that, I think, this is the first occasion when two “luxury” brands (the current trend of E Leather seats, good leg room, wifi access etc) have started to compete with one another! In fact, Platinum specification and this version of Sapphire (Arriva’s North Wales operation uses a far more luxurious specification on the 12 from Rhyl-Llandudno-see blog “Chester & North Wales”) are pretty similar in levels of comfort, meaning both operators have an equal advantage in this respect. NXWM have the higher frequency (every 6/7 minutes combined compared to the 110’s fifteen minutes) so have the lion’s share of the market, though I do notice that people sometimes stand back from our buses to wait for a 110.\n\nWe left the city along the Aston Expressway, which, for 09.15 in the morning, was incredibly congested city bound, with the queue of traffic stretching right back onto Gravelly Hill, probably down to that Belgrave Middleway closure (at the other end of the City Centre Queensway tunnels, which cause chaos on the Expressway whenever they are blocked). Still, our journey out to Sutton was swift enough, from where we followed NXWM’s X4 up to the Whitehouse Common crossroads, from where we left the familiarity of the routes on my rota and headed through pleasant, tree lined suburbs for the run up to Ashfurlong Corner, from where the route hits open country and the open road, our driver taking advantage of this to put his foot down!\n\nI love travelling on double deckers on inter urban services such as this and, once upon a time, it was possible to reach Tamworth by two potentially double deck routes, upon which I’ve ridden upon both many times. The other service was the 116, which ran via Minworth & Kingsbury and, to be honest, was a far prettier route than the 110. Back in National Bus Company (NBC) days, both routes tended to be operated by a mixture of double (Leyland Olympians or, more preferably, Alexander bodied D13 class Daimler Fleetlines) and single deckers (Leyland Nationals or, usually on evenings or Sundays, Marshall or Plaxton bodied Leyland Leopards) though, interestingly, back in the eighties, the 116 tended to gain more double deckers than the 110. This trend had been totally reversed in recent years, however, with the 116 having been converted mainly to single deck operation (due to various interworking arrangements with the 115 to Hurley, which passes under a low bridge) as far back as 1998, though spells of double decker operation have been possible since. The last time I travelled on a double decker on the 116 (on a Wright Gemini bodied Volvo B9) was around 2010, when one of the two all day turns on the route, never interworked with the 115.\n\nNow sadly, we no longer have the choice of riding on either a double or single decker, as Arriva withdrew the 116 in September 2016. I suspect a major factor in this was Birmingham independent Central Buses competing with the 115 & 116 on their strongest leg between Tamworth & Kingsbury with their 16. The 115 survived but the section of the 116 to Birmingham had grown weaker over the years, with the villages of Curdworth & Minworth having extremely high car ownership and even the extension of NXWM’s 904 (now X4) from Falcon Lodge-Minworth ASDA, may have had an effect, despite it’s indirect route from Birmingham, as NXWM Travelcard & Daysaver holders have used the route to reach the Minworth industrial estates. Central Buses responded to the 116’s withdrawal by extending one 16 an hour to Birmingham as the X16 via the M42 & M6 but this was unsuccessful and has since been withdrawn. More successful has been the extension of one 16 journey in the morning to start from Curdworth to cater for school & college traffic from the village, with a similar journey extending to Curdworth in the evening,\n\nWe arrived in Tamworth and checked the times for the next 65 to Nuneaton, which was due at 10.42, forty two minutes away, so we decided to use the public loos….only to find that they had been demolished! Oh well, no relief here! I showed Phil the sight of the former bus station, closed around 1984 and converted into a car park & taxi rank, with the buses pushed out to terminate alongside in Corporation Street. Most of the town services had already been moved out by this stage (which may have been part of the reasoning by the town council in deciding that the bus station was no longer necessary!) having being moved to Victoria Road with the introduction of the Mercian Market Analysis Project revisions in September 1979. Oh well, we were in town far too early for chips and a pint!…….And we couldn’t even go for a pee! What a rigmarole! So instead, we walked over to Victoria Road to have a look at the Town services;\n\nAfter a while, we made our way back to Corporation Street in good time to make the 65, which was operated by Scania 3501, branded for the MIRA Technology Park, which the route serves;\n\nWe boarded 3501 and settled down at the back, the effective heater soon lulling me into a deep sleep, which I remained in for most of the trip! Not one of my favourite single deck types of the moment but obviously comfortable enough for a snooze! I woke up as we entered the MIRA Technology Park, where I reminded Phil that this was once the test track where the legendary BMMO D9 was tested. Ironically, the 65’s ancestors (the 765 & 766, which once ran all the way from Lichfield-Coventry) would be one of only two routes we would travel on today that were never operated by D9s (even the 9, in it’s form as the former Midland Red 130, had them!) being single deck operated in BMMO days, due to a low bridge at Lichfield (post deregulation, Midland Red North’s X76 and later 776 would see some double deck operation). We soon arrived in a Nuneaton Bus Station dominated by the local Stagecoach operation (this being former Midland Red South territory) but we were looking for the Arriva operated 158. Whilst waiting, however, another MIRA Technology Park branded bus, this time a short Enviro 200, 2003 was waiting to depart on the 7 to Burbage via Hinckley, so we decided to ride this to Hinckley and catch the 158 there, getting a new route in the book! This would be the other route without D9 ancestry!\n\n2003 was operated by Hinckley Bus, a now wholly owned Arriva subsidiary that has it’s origins from Hinckley’s Fox Cub minibus network introduced in 1986. Never the most profitable of minibus networks, it was sold off to Leicester independent Centrebus some years back but they subsequently sold it back to Arriva! The E200 we were travelling on is one of Hinckley Buses newest buses, most of the fleet consisting of elderly Dennis Darts and Wright bodied DAFs. The 7 left Nuneaton around some affluent looking housing estates that seemed also to be served by Stagecoach, dropping off all the other passengers, which consisted entirely of senior citizens using their concessionary passes. We then joined the main road for the run to Hinckley but upon entering the town, went a wandering again, serving some narrow roads that must have gained a service in the era of the minibus. Nevertheless, we past Hollycroft Park, Hollycroft being a district once served by Midland Fox’s X32 Leyland National operated express service to Leicester via the M69, this later being extended to Nuneaton and joined by some Midland Red South competition in the form of the 655 from Nuneaton-Hinckley via Hollycroft, which I travelled on with my friends Mark Dawson & John Batchelor, on D13 6185 back in December 1985. (see blog “Leicester In The Snow!”)\n\nWe reached a Hinckley Town Centre that had been changed dramatically by the building of a retail & leisure park. Not being sure whether the bus station still existed, we alighted at some new stops on the High Street. Apparently, the bus station was still there but we decided to stay where we was, as a 158 was due shortly. This is a route which see’s competition from Stagecoach’s 48, which runs through from Coventry on a twenty minute frequency, as opposed to the 158’s half hourly. Both these routes have their origin from Midland Red’s 658, which followed the route of the 48 exactly. At the 1981 split of Midland Red, the 658 was operated by Nuneaton & Leicester garages, meaning it became a joint service between Midland Red South and Midland Red East (later Fox). After deregulation, several years of continuing that spirit of cooperation gradually deteriorated, to be replaced by the competition we have now. A Stagecoach Enviro 200 on the 48 appeared first, loading at the far stop (which didn’t have 48 displayed on the flag, a legacy of this being an Arriva stop!) Most of the passengers waiting boarded this, so slightly later, Wright 3315 turned up, with us and the other few remainers boarding. We then travelled out through the villages of Barwell & Earl Shelton and then through the countryside, with Arriva’s hand on this corridor being strengthened by us being joined at Leicester Forest East by the 153 from Market Bosworth. We soon crossed the Leicester city boundary, where we were joined by the third major group, First, operating city service 18, this being one of the few main roads in the UK where First, Arriva & Stagecoach all compete with one another on fairly frequent services!\n\nOne thing where the 48 & 158 differ is their Leicester termini, with the 48 terminating at the newish (opened in 2016) Haymarket Bus Station, whilst we alighted from 3315 at the older (though heavily rebuilt in 1984) St Margaret’s Bus Station that is the hub of most country services from the city, as well as the stop for National Express services. We decided that our next move was to track down one of Arriva’s MMC bodied Enviro 400s that we had narrowly missed in Blaby last year just after the first of these had entered service (see blog “When Phil met Steve!”). We now encountered one of the difficulties of having your bus ticket on a mobile phone, as Phil had received a phone call just before we wanted to board MMC E400 4511 and it’s driver was anxious to go! Phil quickly made excuses to his caller and frantically reactivated his E Daysaver, just before the driver closed his doors. I simply flashed my paper Daysaver in the time honoured fashion!\n\n4511 was on the 85, one of Arriva’s three services along Aylestone Road. The 87 branches off at Wigston Lane and heads to the Eyres Monsell estate, this having previously been Leicester CityBus’s (now First) 37, though years ago was the joint Leicester City Transport(LCT)/Midland Red 87/L87, so the more recent number has a history attached to it! The 84 & 85 both carry onto Blaby, just outside the city boundary, where they split up, the 84 heading out through delightful villages in the Broughton Astley direction, with two out of the three journeys per hour carrying onto Lutterworth, whilst the 85 heads out in the other direction, to the village of Countesthorpe and then onto South Wigston (again a twenty minute frequency).\n\nSouth Wigston is a very Victorian town, built largely by the railways, as it’s situated at the junction of the Midland main lines to London St Pancras and Birmingham. But it also has another, more recent piece of transport history that I knew Phil would be interested in seeing! Midland Red was a very dominant operator in Leicester, operating a good share of the city network, as well as rural and inter urban services radiating from the city. This network was at it’s strongest during the fifties, when the company’s two Leicester city centre garages (Southgates & Sandacre, both now closed) were bursting at the seams with buses! To combat this, a new garage was opened in Station Street, South Wigston, to be known as Wigston garage, on 5th October 1957. It is now one of the few original Birmingham Midland Motor Omnibus (Midland Red) built garages still in use as a bus garage (the others being Tamworth-which we visited that morning!-Worcester, Rugby, Nuneaton & Banbury). The 85 terminated at Canal Street, just across the road from Station Street so, as Phil had never been here before, I took him over to show him this living piece of Midland Red history;\n\nAfter viewing the garage, we returned to the main street to catch what has traditionally been one leg of it’s main circular trunk route. Midland Red’s L7 & L8 traditionally linked Leicester to the two main Wigston centres of South Wigston & Wigston Magna, reaching them via the two main roads, Saffron Lane & Welford Road respectively, then running between the two before returning to Leicester via the other main road. The early seventies saw these renumbered the 7 & 8, whilst Midland Fox renumbered them 47 & 48 in 1986. We caught branded Enviro 400 4417 on an inbound 48. The route inbound served the semi detached clad suburbs that caused the expansion of Midland Red services in this area, which in turn lead to the construction of Wigston garage. Very soon, we reached the Leicester city boundary, where the private housing that typified the Wigston section of the route, gives way to the council houses of the Eyres Monsell estate on the left, until we reach the Saffron Cross Roads roundabout, where we meet First’s route 88, coming off Eyres Monsell.\n\nThis had it’s origin’s, like the L87 into the estate from the Aylestone Road, as the joint Leicester City Transport/Midland Red L88. In fact, the reason both services were joint was because Midland Red had control of the Aylestone Road, wheras LCT had control of Saffron Lane, due to one of it’s earliest bus services, the 24, terminating at Saffron Cross Roads. The seventies saw all this consolidated, with the by now 88 being merged with the 24 to become the cross city 38 to Nether Hall. This would prove to be the last LCT route to be operated by Leyland PD3 half cabs (these ceasing in 1981) and crew operation itself (in 1984). In more recent years, First have split the route in the City Centre, with the Eyres Monsell section becoming the 88 again. The 88A also serves the Saffron Lane Estate, starting from the crossroads, then taking a more roundabout route around the eastern edge of the estate, before re-joining the main road about half a mile further down. So that’s a combined six minute First service competing with Arriva’s fifteen, meaning this corridor still has First’s dominance, continuing the legacy of it’s LCT history.\n\nUpon arriving at Haymarket Bus Station, 4417 changed to a 47, meaning that it would return back around the Wigston Circular in the clockwise direction. But we had a destination in mind on the anti clockwise leg, so we boarded the next available 48, which was being operated by former Tamworth (transferred when the Sapphire E400’s took over the 110) Wright Gemini bodied Volvo B9 4208, which was decked out last year in a livery to congratulate Leicester City Football Club on winning the Premier League (shame their progress hasn’t been so glorious this season!)\n\nDespite the importance of the Saffron Lane corridor to South Wigston to Midland Red and it’s successors, it’s the Welford Road corridor where Midland Red’s dominance lead to the construction of Wigston garage. Welford Road did have an LCT tram service, which became the 42 bus route, but the level of Midland Red buses heading towards Wigston soon swamped this, causing the removal of the LCT protection point years before their eventual abolishment in 1984 (The Protection Points protected LCT from other operators-mostly Midland Red, within most of the city). The 42 disappeared in 1972, replaced by new joint (though mostly LCT) 62 & 63 which served newly developing areas of Wigston. These would be taken over totally by Midland Fox in 1984, subsequently being renumbered 42 & 43 and now those territories are covered by Arriva routes 44A & 49A. So Wigston garage’s dominance became complete.\n\nThe reason we wished to travel up the Welford Road was to visit the Grimsby fisheries chip shop but sadly, it was closed, so we carried on out of the city and back into the borough of Oadby & Wigston. Wigston Magna is basically the original village of Wigston, which was briefly left behind when the railways developed South Wigston. Then came the great suburbanisation of the area from the twenties onwards, which lead to the gap between the two communities being filled…and , of course, the subsequent growth in Midland Red bus services! We alighted from 4208 here and looked for a pub to pass the time before the Grimsby Fisheries opening (well, my guestimate of it!), so we settled on the William Wygston Weatherspoons house, enjoying a pint of Brains SA each whilst discussing Jeremy Corbyn’s plans to renationalise the railways! Then, it was out to the bus stop outside the pub to catch E400 4422 on an inbound 47. Fortunately, my guestimate proved accurate as the chippy was indeed open, so we alighted and treated ourselves to fish & chips which we ate in my usual position, on the petrol station wall next to the city bound bus stop. Phil had ate all his and I had nearly completed mine when Wright Gemini/Volvo B9 4204 (another ex Tamworth bus) on the 49A, so I adopted covert chip eating mode and shoved the remains into my bag, finishing them off once we were safely upstairs and out of the driver’s gaze!\n\nArriving back at Haymarket, we made our way around to St Margarets in good time to catch the 17.32 158, the last journey to run beyond Hinckley. Wright Streetlite 3317 was our stead and we left the bus station on cue, fairly lightly loaded but we picked up very nearly a full bus load in The Haymarket (not to be confused with the Haymarket Bus Station, which actually leads onto Charles Street and is named after the Haymarket Shopping centre which straddles between the two streets), a stop which is shared with the 48 which, interestingly, had just left virtually empty, in stark contrast to the position we had seen on the way in. My conclusion is that passengers at that time of the day had been concessionary pass holders who had boarded the first bus to come, where as passengers on this journey were commuters who were obviously holders of Arriva’s range of season tickets, with Arriva being the established operator at this end of the route, with Stagecoach being the outsiders! We’d dropped off most of the load by Hinckley and were fairly empty by the time we reached Nuneaton Bus Station; We then had just a few minutes wait before Stagecoach Enviro 200 39687 appeared on a 48 heading for Coventry. During the day, the 48 operates every ten minutes between Coventry & Nuneaton, then splitting into two twenty minute legs, one heading to Leicester in competition with the 158 and the other heading out to Atherstone-in competition with Arriva’s 65! The Leicester leg reduces to just a Leicester-Nuneaton service after a certain time, so this journey had originated from Atherstone. It was originally my intention for us to take the 48 as far as Bedworth, then changing onto an NX Coventry 20 to complete the run to Coventry, this allowing me to use my NXWM staff pass and Phil his NXWM E Daysaver that he’d used to get into Birmingham. But it was now approaching 19.00, so we decided it would be better to fork out the full whack of £4.80 each for a single through to Coventry. As we departed the bus station, I commented that it was immediately apparent how superior the ride quality of the ADL Enviro 200 is when compared with it’s rival Wright Streetlite. And this was the old version of the Enviro 200! The new MMC version is infinitely better! Same on the double deck front, the MMC E400 beats the Wright Streetdeck hands down on ride quality. But, of course, the Wright product has better fuel economy and is probably cheaper to buy. With a lot of bus services being marginal on the profitability front, it’s no surprise that many operators are choosing the Wright option. A pattern seems to be emerging, with the more prosperous operators tending to go for the ADL products, which probably explains the larger number of Streetlites to its MMC E200 rival, as single deck services generally tend to be more marginal than double deck routes, where the MMC E400 seems to be taking ground!\n\nThe run through Bedworth and into Coventry was uneventful, although on the approach to the final stop in Trinity Street, we passed a gym where several, shall we say, rather muscular young men were working out. Phil poured scorn on all this exercise! Phil tends to moan a lot about many things, some of which, to me, seem quite comically trivial (i’e Drive Thru Costa Coffees) but I must confess that I agree with him about these places, which seem to exist to make you feel inferior (which, of course, you aren’t!). Basically, neither Phil nor I would describe ourselves as natural athletes! Anyhow, we alighted from the 48 and walked the short distance to the entrance of Pool Meadow Bus Station, where we gazed at the electronic bus departure board…..to discover an X1 to Birmingham was due to depart in four minutes! Suddenly, Phil & I revised our opinion on exercise as we legged it across the concourse to the X1 stand!\n\nBreathlessly, we arrived just as the driver of NXWM Platinum branded MMC E400 6848 started to load passengers. We joined the queue and settled into the comfortable seats upstairs, the generous legroom allowing us to stretch out! I don’t know about Phil but, as we glided out through the Coventry suburbs, I found myself beginning to doze, a state that would last for the rest of the trip! Very much the civilised version of bus travel! Long may such initiatives continue! So, just over an hour later, we found ourselves back in Birmingham. We said our farewells, with Phil heading for Moor Street station in pursuit of a train for Stourbridge, whilst I headed through New Street station to catch the Midland Metro home.\n\nIt’s rare these days that you can successfully emulate a bash that was possible on an old Midland Red Day Anywhere ticket but today, we had done so, making a grand circuit of the West & East Midlands using service buses! And it was great fun!\n\nThe fact that Easter falls late this year meant that the Blackpool Heritage Tramway operation was able to squeeze in another Winter Heritage weekend, making this the fourth such event of the 2016/2017 winter period. It was also the third that I was able to attend, the first one back in November I’ve already blogged about whereas I was unable to make the January weekend and decided not to blog the February weekend to avoid becoming repetitive. For that reason, I was unsure whether to write about this visit but, as things turned out, it was such a nice day that I felt compelled to record my memories-and of course, a few pictures-of the event!\n\nOver the past few years, my wife Lynn & I have taken to reaching such events by train, mainly thanks to the excellent Two Together Railcard and the fact that, since Virgin merged the Euston-Wolverhampton service with the Birmingham-Glasgow/Edinburgh trains, these have used higher capacity trains, hence more seats to fill, hence reasonable deals for those booking in advance. Unfortunately, this period of time has seen the Preston-Blackpool North & South lines closed to allow electrification works to take place on the line to Blackpool North, meaning Rail Replacement bus services are having to operate. Now, I’ve nothing against this and it’s great to see that the railway is being modernised in this way but my past experience of Rail Replacement bus services tends to consist of me arriving at the interchange point, then being told by the coach driver that he wasn’t due out yet! Hardly seamless travel (though to be fair, those I talked to today who had used the service from Preston had stepped seamlessly onto a waiting coach!)\n\nSo for both the February visit, and today’s trip, Lynn & I would drive up. This is the way we’ve reached Blackpool on countless visits and, although here on “Buses for Fun” I try and encourage as much use of the public transport network as possible, I must confess that I do enjoy driving! In fact, enthusiast or not, I doubt if I would enjoy my bus driving job as much as I do if I didn’t love the actual driving aspect of the job. The drive up the M6 on a Saturday morning is always something I enjoy, as it’s usually quite quiet-unlike some trips I’ve made on a Friday afternoon when the only enjoyment I’ve received is a visit to the KFC at Keele services! And this morning was no exception, as the day had dawned bright and sunny, a refreshing oasis after a spell of bad weather! We stopped of at Sandbach services for a bacon roll and headed onwards, listening to Dermot O Leary on the new Radio Two Saturday Breakfast show (on our February visit, we’d listened to the final show of Brian Matthews long running “Sound of the Sixties”). My favourite section of the drive is when we leave the M6 to join the M55 for Blackpool, a moment when I get quite excited about my imminent arrival in my favourite seaside resort and just at that moment on this bright Saturday morning, Dermot played exactly the right song to match my good mood! “Mr Blue Sky” by ELO! Marvellous!\n\nWe were soon off the M55 and heading around the Blackpool suburbs to park at the Gynn Square car park at North Shore (£5 for 12 hours-further reason to use public transport if you can get a reasonable fare!) We then walked up the Prom to the Cabin Heritage Tram stop. Studying the timetable I’d picked up in February and matching it with the list of today’s allocation that had been posted on Facebook, I was pleased to see that the tram I’d most looked forward to riding on today was the next tram due north!\n\n600 (225 before 1968, when the purchase of a computer by Blackpool Corporation caused the tram fleet to be renumbered to avoid duplicating bus fleet numbers) was the prototype of twelve open top single deckers built in 1934 and rejoicing in the model name of Boats (though originally, these were officially known as “Luxury Toastracks”). Three of these popular cars survive in the Blackpool Heritage fleet (with another-236/607-at the Crich Tramway Museum and four exist in the USA) and are good at attracting passengers on warm, sunny days, making them popular cars to use on the Blue, two car Heritage service on such days, bringing valuable revenue into the Heritage operation.\n\nLynn and I bumped into our friend Alan and we chatted away as the tram trundled over the cliffs, through Bispham and onto the turning circle at Little Bispham, where we turned and headed back along the Prom, taking in the sea air all the way down to the Pleasure Beach. When we passed Talbot Square, I noticed two of Blackpool Transport’s brand new batch of MMC Enviro 400 Cities, loading at a temporary stop for what is one of their regular routes, the 14 (Fleetwood-Mereside, though the Mereside section is shortly to be transferred to the 6 from Grange Park). I’d thought about going for a ride on one but the lure of a six car heritage operation was too strong! Still, it didn’t stop me taking a photo of the two!\n\nEach tram on the six car timetable of a Gold weekend is scheduled to make one trip to the line’s northern terminus in the neighbouring fishing port of Fleetwood and 600’s trip was to be it’s next departure, so it seemed only polite to go all the way. Lynn, however, desired to visit the shops in Blackpool Town Centre, so she alighted at North Pier, whilst I enjoyed a repeat of the run along the cliffs out to Little Bispham, after which the line curves inland to serve the bustling town centre of Cleveleys, then onwards to Thornton Gate, passing through a mixture of suburbs and fields, passed the imposing Rossall Public School, then entering Fleetwood through the Broadwater council estate before the reserved track run parallel to Radcliffe Road, with houses on the one side and various industrial units which separate the tramway from the Docks, on the other. Then, it was a trundle down Lord Street, for so many years the only lengthy section of street tramway to survive in the UK, before reaching the terminus at Fleetwood Ferry. We then returned back to Blackpool, with me alighting at Bispham. This was the time of day when all the Heritage trams would be taking their crew breaks, so I decided it was an ideal time for one of the most excellent Steak pies sold by Bispham’s Top Chippy, the takeaway side of the Bispham Kitchen Restaurant, which I ate on a bench on the cliffs, overlooking the tramway !\n\nMy pie was devoured just in time for red & white liveried Balloon car 701 to come off it’s break on the Bispham central tracks, so I boarded for a trip to North Pier;\n\nBack in 1991, 701 had a major refurbishment, gaining fixed bus seating, as opposed to the traditional swing-over seats and also gaining concealed, tungsten bulb lighting. To signify this difference, the car was painted in the red & white livery used up until 1933 when the revolutionary manager Walter Luff changed the livery to green & cream, claiming that this colour scheme “better suited the character of the town!” In 1985, Leyland PD3 507 (a bus for those who don’t know!) was painted in red & white to celebrate the tramway’s centenary, this being so popular that Blackpool Transport decided to paint the ex London Transport Routemasters bought the following year in that livery (see blog “Blackpool Deregulated Part One). This was followed by Boat car 604 adopting the livery in 1989, so 701’s repaint was following a trend. After a few years, the tram reverted to the standard green & cream nineties livery but the Heritage operation decided to repaint 701 in it’s red & white livery a few years back.\n\nI only took 701 to North Pier as I wanted to travel north on Balloon 717, which was due there ten minutes later. 717 has been restored as much as possible to original thirties condition and is probably the main emblem of the Heritage fleet, seeing frequent use whenever the Heritage trams are operating. It was the only tram running during my February visit that I hadn’t been on, so this was the ideal opportunity to put this right;\n\nAs the photo shows, 717 was only going to Cabin, which suited me fine, as I wanted to wait there to catch Balloon 711 heading towards Pleasure Beach. The tram duly arrived and I boarded but we seemed to be waiting at North Pier for rather a long time! It emerged that the tram was suffering from a defective headlight and was waiting for an engineer to arrive from Rigby Road Depot to resolve the problem. It looked as though the tram wouldn’t be preceding to Cabin after all, as it would have to return to Pleasure Beach to make an on time departure for it’s Fleetwood trip! Ohh well, at least I got to actually sit on it this visit! 701 made a return appearance, so I boarded this for the trip to Cabin instead, crossing over there to await 711 heading towards Pleasure Beach; Following 701’s refurbishment, 723 was given a much more thorough refurbishment in 1993, this being followed around a year later by 711 gaining a virtually identical refurbishment. The following four refurbishments all featured controversial rebuilding of the Balloons classically curved fronts but then it was decided to make subsequent refurbishments more in keeping with the traditional Balloon shape. Personally, I prefer 711 & 723’s style of refurbishment more, as the later examples have less legroom due to the fact that they kept the bench seats at either end of the upper deck.\n\n711 is one of the “B” fleet of Balloons, reconstructed with wider entrances and power operated doors to enable them to serve the new platforms constructed for the modern Blackpool Flexity cars which upgraded the tramway in 2012. They have received generally little use in this guise (the Flexity cars meeting virtually all the modern tramway’s needs) so frequently make “guest” appearances on the Heritage Tramway’s Gold weekends. I grabbed the rear, backwards facing seat for the journey to the Pleasure Beach. At North Pier, I heard the conductor mention my name! Apparently, Mike, the driver, had spotted Lynn waiting by the tram stop and told her that I was on board! Of course, I couldn’t see her because I was facing backwards! She got on board and told me off for not answering my phone, especially as she’s rung me three times! Apparently, I’d knocked my phone’s ringtone onto silent! Modern technology for you! Anyhow, we both travelled onto the Pleasure Beach and changed onto car 733, the front of the illuminated Western Train for a trip back to North Pier;\n\nWe took this normally nocturnal icon of the fleet up to North Pier, where we crossed over for a ride on the oldest tram in service today, in fact, the second oldest operational tram in the Heritage fleet, (the oldest being Bolton 66) 1914 vintage Blackpool & Fleetwood Box car 40;\n\nWe caught this grand old lady back to Pleasure Beach, chatting to the conductor, Bradley, about the upcoming new series of “Doctor Who”, which we’re both very excited about! At Pleasure Beach, the next tram to depart was 701. I debated whether to get this to Bispham and catch 717 on it’s return from Fleetwood but this was 701’s trip to the fishing town and I quite fancied a run on a double decker there, so Lynn & I made this our final trip of the day, enjoying a sunny run on this, ironically the first tram that I’d ever made a complete journey all the from Starr Gate-Fleetwood on, way back in 1985 before it’s refurbishment! We alighted at Bispham on the return and had tea in the Bispham Kitchen. I had moby & chips-that’s a very large Fleetwood caught Haddock! I followed this with some ice cream made by Bonds of Elswick, a village out in the Fylde countryside. So all local produce!\n\nOnce we’d eaten, we waited for a Flexity back to Gynn Square, watching the sun going down as we did so!\n\nThe peace was shattered when Flexity 001 arrived, full of Glasgow Rangers supporters who had watched their team play at Fleetwood Town’s ground (not sure why a Scottish match was being played here!) Still, they were noisy but not threatening as we made the short journey down to Gynn Square, where we transferred to our car for the drive home. Traffic was quite heavy, making the journey quite slow, illustrating another reason why it’s better to go by train\n\nI lived in the Shropshire New Town of Telford from 1977-1985 and developed very much a love/hate relationship with the place, as I’m very much an urban creature and the Telford of that period was far from my idea of urban! In fact, I remember during English Literature lessons during my fourth year at the Abraham Darby school (more on that name in a bit!), we were studying the decidedly rural novels of Thomas Hardy (in my opinion the most boring author ever to have existed! Sorry literary fans but I really wasn’t impressed!) our English teacher Mr Caser expressed the opinion that Telford was neither rural nor urban but possessed the disadvantages of both! His words and, at the time, my feelings!\n\nA bit of background! Like most of Shropshire, the area that would become Telford was predominantly rural, although ironically, the south western corner of the area was actually the birthplace of the industrial revolution, where the industrialisation of iron smelting was perfected in Coalbrookdale by the Quaker Abraham Darby (yep, my school was named after him, although there was actually four Abraham Darbys, the later three carrying on the work of the original. My school’s other claim to fame was that, before my time, in the days when it was known as Madeley Modern and was half the size I would know it to be, it had a somewhat prim and proper art teacher by the name of……Mary Whitehouse!) The most visible demonstration of this in the area was the first bridge to be built solely with iron, constructed across the River Severn, where it would be ultimately be surrounded by the village that was named after it, Ironbridge! In time, the local resources that had caused the establishment of industry became exhausted and the industry moved to other areas such as the Black Country, allowing the Ironbridge area to revert to it’s rural status. Now, many of the sites are museums which I visited when learning all about the industrial revolution at school, these being the days before the National curriculum when schools could, to a degree, choose what they taught us kids and local history was a big feature (at our school anyhow!)\n\nThe other “local” subject that my school’s Humanities Department taught us was the development of the New Towns. I remember the introduction to this subject in the second year really well! We were told that the industrial revolution (neatly linking into the birthplace subject) created quickly built industrial towns, with people living very close to the factories they worked, in “very badly” built houses. Most of these houses were demolished in slum clearance programmes from the thirties onwards, which saw the construction of the suburbs, a process helped by the development of tram and bus services. But after the Second World War, planners decided that, to cope with an ever increasing population, a series of New Towns would be constructed. These would be developed with industry and housing segregated from each other, all in pleasant, tree lined surroundings, with plenty of green spaces for the residents to enjoy! Sounds idyllic, doesn’t it? To a degree, I suppose it was!\n\nTelford (named after highways and canal builder Thomas Telford) was one of these, although the original intended name was Dawley New Town, after the large village that was roughly at it’s centre! Most of the new housing estates to be constructed would be to the south of the town, as the north side was already pretty urbanised, with the market town of Wellington to the west and the urban area heading eastwards, a triangle of urban development being formed between two of the main roads out of Wellington, the Trench Road to Hadley & Donnington (home of a large Central Ordinance Depot, which was responsible for a lot of the urban development in the area) and the A5 Watling Street to Oakengates. This is where the bus industry comes in, as the twenties saw this area served by a plethora of small, independent operators, some of whom were only one man bands, whilst others would grow larger, often by acquisition. Competition was intense, not only with each other but also with the large and growing, British Electric Traction subsidiary Midland Red (more on them later), especially on the two main road routes. With the 1930 Road Traffic Act looming on the horizon, bringing regulation to the industry, the independents decided to work together to protect their licences!\n\nThe Shropshire Omnibus Association (SOA) was formed and two rotas were created, Donnington for the Trench Road and Wrockwardine for the Oakengates. Each operator was allocated shares in the rota (the number of shares depending on the size of the existing operations) and a firm of accountants was employed to devise a rota, which would see each duty allocated to a share per week, so for example, operator one, would operate duty one on one day, then operator two the next and so on. This rather complex system worked! Gradually, the larger operators took over the one man bands and increased their shares on the rota. Midland Red originally wasn’t part of the rota but operated services alongside it (899/900 on Wrockwardine, 913/914/915 on Donnington) so, despite the regulated timetable, the high frequency meant that competition was quite intense!\n\nAway from the two rota served main roads, various independents built up their own services. The Donnington & Oakengates ends of the rota routes were linked together by various services operated by H Brown of Donnington Wood, who also had shares on the Donnington rota. Three independents also reached as far south as Dawley, with two operators running two different services to Oakengates-Hoggins & Smiths Britannia, alongside Ashleys of Dawley, who ran to Wellington via Overdale. Hoggins also operated Sunday Hospital services, to the various Shrewsbury Hospitals and the New Cross & Royal Hospitals in Wolverhampton. More irregular rural work constituted H Brown’s Wellington-Humbers Roundabout via Preston service, as well as two market day services, on Wednesdays from Oakengates-Market Drayton and on Fridays from Hinstock to Newport, whilst Ashleys ran a Thursday only service from the village of Cressage into Wellington.\n\nMidland Red first served the area in 1922, with a service running along the A5 from Shrewsbury-Wellington, being run from the garage in the county town. A garage in Wellington opened on 9th July 1926. Expansion saw the original Mansell Road garage closed and replaced by a larger garage in Chorlton Street. This was totally rebuilt with a larger still structure opening in September 1953. This served the area well, not closing until modern day successor Arriva opened a replacement garage on the Stafford Park industrial estate on 15th April 2012! The Shrewsbury service was extended across Wellington in two directions. One headed up the Trench Road through Donnington and onto Newport, eventually reaching the village of Edgmond. This route would become the 917. The other leg headed to Wolverhampton via Oakengates, Shifnal & Albrighton. I’m unsure of the number this route carried in the twenties but, in 1930, it was absorbed into what was Midland Red’s second longest stage carriage service, the X96 from Shrewsbury-Northampton via Wellington, Wolverhampton, Dudley, Birmingham, Coventry & Rugby. For many years, three journeys a day operated throughout on this mammoth service, operated by three garages, Shrewsbury, Digbeth (Birmingham) & Rugby. Wellington’s participation in the X96 only consisted of duplicates when needed, though a few shorts between Wellington & Wolverhampton were operated by the garage, numbered 895 (which may have been the number given to the service with Midland Red’s large, 1928 renumbering.) Whilst the X96 remained at it’s three times a day frequency until May 1974 (more on that later), with a minimum fare being charged on sections where the route ran alongside more local services, the 917 gradually built up to an hourly service, with certain journeys extended beyond Edgmond to the village of Tibberton. It was operated jointly by Shrewsbury & Wellington garages.\n\nMidland Red developed other services from Wellington, consisting of local services to compete with the independents which, once the 1930 Road Traffic Act bought regulation to the industry, had to work at an integrated frequency with the SOA independents, though in practice, that frequency was so high that they were effectively still in competition with each other! The other main corridor out of Wellington was the main road to Dawley, exclusively served by Midland Red and distinctly more rural than the two SOA rota corridors. The main service along here became the 909 to Bridgnorth and, ultimately Kidderminster until the early seventies, running via Dawley, Madeley, Ironbridge & Broseley. Short workings of this were the 897 to Ironbridge and 898 to Madeley. The other main trunk via Dawley was the 904 to Much Wenlock, which ran via Horsehay & Coalbrookdale between Dawley & Ironbridge before following the 909 to Broseley where they split to reach their ultimate destinations. Services 920 & 921 also followed this corridor, serving the more local areas around Dawley.\n\nLess regular rural routes were the 941 to Little Wenlock as well as a less frequent but slightly more direct service to Bridgnorth, in the form of the 919 via Sutton Madoc & Norton, along the main A442. There was also a group of routes to the north of Wellington, through Admaston and onto the villages beyond, like the 922 to High Ercall & Ellerdine Heath. Midland Red also developed a small network of W prefixed Wellington Town services, the W prefix being introduced on 30th June 1947. Although Wellington only ran duplicates on the X96, the garage did participate in other services to Wolverhampton. In 1949, Midland Red took over Ironbridge based independent Carter, which ran a market day service from Ironbridge-Wolverhampton. This was expanded into daily service 892, with some journeys linked with Shrewsbury garage’s service from Ironbridge-Shrewsbury via Buildwas, these journeys becoming 893. Another, rather restricted service started in the late fifties, this being the 891 from Wellington-Wolverhampton. This differed from the X96/895 route between Shifnal & Albrighton by serving Tong & Cosford, villages mainly served by Wolverhampton Corporation’s 49 group of services, and was hence heavily restricted with pick ups and set downs.\n\nThis then, was basically the area’s bus network before the New Town came into being. The late sixties would begin a period of rapid change in connection with the construction of the New Town’s estates. The first major change took place on 2nd September 1967 and saw the introduction of a group of Limited Stop services that would replace the Wolverhampton services and supplement the X96 which, itself would change from it’s Minimum Fare status to Limited Stop on the sections where the route was also covered by local services. Whilst the X96 itself would remain crew operated for the time being (at that time mostly using LS20 Willowbrook bodied Leyland Leopards & BMMO S21 “semi coaches”), the new services would be one man operated, eventually using brand new Dual Purpose BMMO S22s from 1968 onwards.\n\nThe new routes consisted of the X93, operated by Wolverhampton & Shrewsbury garages, which basically replaced the 893 from Shrewsbury-Wolverhampton via Ironbridge, then carried onto Birmingham via the X96 route through Dudley. The other main new route was the Wellington operated X94, which followed the route of the 904 from Wellington-Ironbridge via Dawley & Coalbrookdale before following the X93 (basically absorbing the 892) to Birmingham, then continuing onwards along the X96 route to Coventry. Finally, filling in a gap to create a combined hourly service from Birmingham-Telford, was the X95, basically a short of the X96 from Coventry-Wellington (which would ultimately take that number), which replaced the 895, these odd trips being operated by Wellington.\n\nThe X93 & X94 served the new town’s first two estates, Sutton Hill and Woodside, which were built either side of the village of Madeley, which was designated the District Centre. These estates would also be served by more local services. Sutton Hill was served by the 942 from Wellington via Arleston (a council estate on the edge of Wellington, with the 942 absorbing most of local route W42), Dawley & Madeley. The larger estate of Woodside, meanwhile, would be served by the rerouting of certain 897 journeys via the estate, these being numbered 898 (the Madeley shorts using this number having disappeared by this time). Eventually, all 897s would be rerouted as 898s, seeing the former service disappear. Another, more short lived service would be the extension of the 920 (Wellington-Little Dawley via Dawley) through Doseley & Lightmoor onto Woodside. Obviously, this service was unsuccessful as it didn’t last, the whole service being withdrawn in the early seventies.\n\nThe new decade saw construction begin on more new estates, with the 942 being rerouted around the first of these, Brookside, but other services to these estates would be influenced by the construction of the new Telford Town Centre, a large shopping centre near the small village of Priorslee, complete with purpose built bus station (though car parking received a higher priority) and a Carrefour Hypermarket.\n\nJust before it’s construction, Midland Red withdrew the 938 (Wellington-Coalport) a service introduced to replace the Wellington-Coalport East branch line. But the company quickly reinstated the route when they realised that it was actually the only bus service to traverse the country lanes where the Town Centre was about to be built! This gave Midland Red the prime rights to serve the new centre. The 938 soon became the 948, the final section of the route being diverted away from Coalport to terminate at Sutton Hill.\n\nThe new centre opened in 1973, featuring a bus station and, despite Midland Red having the licensing rights to serve it, agreements were made for the independents to also serve it. The two Oakengates-Dawley services (Smiths Britannia’s 41 & Hoggins 51) were rerouted to serve the Town Centre, as was Ashley’s 31 from Wellington-Dawley. Extensions to the Town Centre were also made to certain journeys on the SOA’s Wrockwardine rota, as well as H Brown’s Donnington-Oakengates services (these being numbered in a D prefixed series and also included a new direct Donnington-Town Centre service via St Georges). An operator new to stage carriage service was Archways of Shifnal, who took advantage of the fact that Midland Red failed to reroute the X96 to serve the new centre to gain a licence for the Shifnal Flyer from its home town to the Town Centre, this being the first bus service to serve Shifnal’s Admirals Estate. Midland Red, meanwhile split the 948 at the Town Centre, with the Sutton Hill section becoming the 947, whilst a new 946 ran from the Town Centre-Ironbridge via Dawley, Brookside, Madeley & Woodside.\n\n1974 would see Midland Red’s presence in the town strengthen when it purchased independents Coopers & Hoggins. The Coopers purchase gave Midland Red a presence on the SOA rota, although the company would use numbers in it’s own series for the journeys it would operate (for example, the new Town Centre services would become the 949 & 950), whilst Hoggins 51 was absorbed into an extended 946 to Oakengates. At the same time, the 947 & 948 were re-joined together, now known as the 947, which was also rerouted via the new estates at Stirchley, Randley & Hollinswood. The latter estate was one of two that were close to the Town Centre, with the other, at Malinslee, (named after a small hamlet that had a station on the Coalport branch) being served by the 946. Midland Red also took over Hoggins Hospital services, the Wolverhampton service becoming the 894 and the two Shrewsbury runs the 923 & 924. Midland Red also took over some buses from both operators, mostly Ford and Bedford coaches which didn’t last long with Midland Red. Hoggins though, had a Plaxton Derwent bodied Ford which the company had bought new in April 1972. This was virtually identical (though featuring a red, as opposed to green interior) to the 120 buses of the type bought by Midland Red between 1970 & 1972, several of which were allocated to Wellington. The Hoggins bus (XUX 417K, given Midland Red fleet number 2181) was kept by the company but, perhaps surprisingly, was never allocated to Wellington, being sent to Heath Hayes (ex Harper Brothers garage), then with spells at Kidderminster & Redditch before it’s 1979 withdrawal, though it returned to the Telford area when bought by local independent Britannia International Travel, more of which in Part Two.\n\nMay 1974 saw major changes to the Limited Stop services. The X93 & X94 were both withdrawn, with the 893 reinstated as a replacement for the X93, with hourly shorts to Ironbridge covering the gap left by the X94’s demise, plus catering for new demand in the new town, with Brookside also added to the route. The 893 was also rerouted via the former 891 route through Cosford & Tong, replacing the short lived 882 & 883, taken over from West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE) in December 1973 (when they were ex Wolverhamton Corporations 39 & 49. The peak 884 to Donnington-not the Telford example but a small hamlet to the north of Albrighton) and previously Wolverhampton’s 89-survivied until November 1979. The 891, meanwhile, was rerouted via the former 893 (and X96 etc) route, direct from Albrighton-Shifnal. With hourly shorts to Albrighton (making a half hourly service with the 893) the 891 ran every two hours through to Shifnal, Telford Town Centre, Oakengates & Wellington before supplementing Wellington Town services W47 & W48 to Dothill & Admaston to the north of the market town. The 891 was partially operated by Cradley Heath garage, which was re-opened in December 1973 to cover the ex Wolverhampton routes out of the county boundary, that Midland Red had taken over as part of the deal to sell it’s West Midlands based routes to WMPTE.\n\nThe X96, meanwhile, was rerouted via the A5 & M6 in lieu of Wolverhampton. The route no longer extended to Northampton (replaced by 595 & 597) but interworked at Coventry with the new X66 to Leicester via Lutterworth & the M1, with Leicester being shown as the ultimate destination (Shrewsbury in the reverse) and with passengers being able to travel throughout. The route through Telford was also revised, to give maximum coverage of the new town, running from Shifnal (which was the first stop from Birmingham!) calling at Halesfield Industrial Estate, Sutton Hill, Madeley, Brookside (actually the Britannia stop in the much older Aquaduct Village, just to the south of the estate) and Dawley before re-joining the original route at Wellington and heading onwards to Shrewsbury with one further stop, in the village of Atcham. The revised service ran every two hours, with buses supplied by Shrewsbury, Digbeth & Leicester (Southgates) garages.\n\nThis was basically the Telford bus scene when my family moved there in June 1977. My Parents had decided that a fresh start would be good for the family and, as my Mom’s cousin and her husband and son already lived on Woodside, we made enquiries about getting a house in the town. I remember going with my Mom to Mallinslee House, the main offices of Telford Development Corporation, the government body set up to develop Telford, including building and renting out houses on the various estates. This was near the Town Centre and we travelled there and back on Marshall bodied Leyland Leopards on the 891. I must admit, I was amazed at the sight of all the independents operating from the bus station, which compensated for the lack of double deckers that the area had-several low bridges plague the area and, even though Midland Red’s Wellington garage was constructed with sufficient headroom, no double deckers were allocated until much later!\n\nWe got a house on Woodside-which wasn’t served by the interesting independents!-and I must confess, after being used to the frequent buses of the West Midlands, the Telford bus networ"
