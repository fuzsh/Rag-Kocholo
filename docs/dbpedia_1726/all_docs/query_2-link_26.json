        "text": "Born on November 1, 1942, the eldest of three born to an Iowa general storeowner, Marcia Wallace endured a troubled childhood (alcoholism, physical abuse). Performing in high school plays as a teenager, she studied at Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa, where she majored in English and theatre.\n\nMarcia initially induced laughs because of a weight problem, playing plump, self-deprecating characters in such musicals as \"The Music Man\". She also supplemented her very modest income at the time, substitute teaching in the Bronx. Managing to drop much of her excess weight over time, she found, to her delight, that she could still make people laugh. Finding an invaluable training ground with the improvisational comedy group, \"The Fourth Wall\", in 1968, she appeared with the company off-Broadway for a spell. In between times, she studied with acting guru Uta Hagen.\n\nMarcia began to flesh out her on-camera resume at first with bit roles on such shows as \"The Invaders\" (as a courtroom spectator), \"Bewitched\" (as Darrin's secretary), \"The Brady Bunch\" (as a saleswoman), she earned her first on-camera break with recurring appearances on The Merv Griffin Show (1962). As a direct result, she won the best role of her career as \"Carol Kester\", the chatty receptionist on The Bob Newhart Show (1972) after only a year or so in Hollywood. For seven years, Marcia won tons of fans as the slightly ditsy co-worker and confidante who was always looking for that \"special guy\" to walk through the door.\n\nDuring that time and after, she guested and added fun to many popular lightweight 70's and 80's shows of the day, including \"Love, American Style,\" \"The Love Boat,\" \"Fantasy Island,\" \"CHiPS,\" \"Magnium, P.I.,\" \"Gimme a Break,\" \"Finder of Lost Loves,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Alf,\" \"Night Court,' \"Small Wonder\" and \"Charles in Charge.\" She also decorated and perked up a few TV movies -- The Castaways on Gilligan's Island (1979), Highway Chaos (1980), Pray TV (1980) -- and the full length features a few films Teen Witch (1989), Meine Mutter ist ein Werwolf (1989) and Ghoulies III (1990). She went on the enjoy regular work in commercials for over three decades (Kraft a la Carte, Crest, Taster's Choice).\n\nFollowing her TV success on the \"The Newhart Show,\" Marcia kept visible as a recurring game show panelist on such shows as \"The Match Game,\" \"Password,\" \"The $10,000 Pyramid\" and \"Hollywood Squares.\" On the summer stock and dinner theater circuits, Marcia found engaging work in such comedies as \"Plaza Suite,\" \"Born Yesterday,\" \"The Prisoner of Second Avenue,\" \"The Sunshine Boys,\" and \"Last of the Red Hot Lovers,\" as well as the musicals \"Gypsy\" and \"Promises, Promises.\"\n\nIn 1985, Marcia was diagnosed with breast cancer. She eventually became an activist and lecturer on breast cancer awareness, educating the public about early detection. She was also the prime caretaker for her husband, hotelier Denny Hawley, when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He passed away in 1992. They adopted one child, Michael.\n\nMarcia's career would gain a second career wind in voiceovers. Today's generations will recognize her Emmy-winning voice-work as Bart's teacher, \"Mrs. Edna Krabappel\" on the long-running animated series Die Simpsons (1989). Her voice was also utilized on such animated projects as \"Darkwing Duck,\" \"Raw Toonage,\" \"Camp Candy,\" \"Batman: The Animated Series,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"Cow and Chicken,\" \"The Angry Beavers\" and Rugrats\" as well as providing several voices for the animated film Die Monster Uni (2013).\n\nShe has guest-hosted televised comedy clubs and talk shows, and was the actual co-host of a diet show on cable. Marcia remained on the lecture circuit and published her own 2004 memoir (Don't Look Back, We're Not Going That Way!) which gently and admirably laces her myriad of struggles with wit, humor and a positive outlook.\n\nInto the millennium, she was seen as Maggie the housekeeper on the short-lived, irreverent TV series spoof Hier kommt Bush! (2001) starring Timothy Bottoms. In 2009, she was seen as Annie Wilkes on the daytime soaper Schatten der Leidenschaft (1973). A few scattered films appeared on the horizon, including the comedies Forever for Now (2004), Big Stan (2007) and Tru Loved (2008).\n\nMarcia's lengthy battle with illness ended on October 25, 2013, when the 70-year-old actress died of breast cancer complications (pneumonia and sepsis).\n\nPhil Hartman was born Philip Edward Hartmann on September 24, 1948, in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. His surname was originally \"Hartmann\", but he later dropped the second \"n\". He was one of eight children of Doris Marguerite (Wardell) and Rupert Loebig Hartmann, a salesman. He was of German, Irish, and English descent. The family moved to the United States when Phil was around ten, and he spent the majority of his childhood in Connecticut and Southern California. He later obtained his American citizenship in the early 1990s. He often would visit his homeland of Canada throughout his career, and the City of Brantford even erected a plaque on the Walk of Fame in the town in honor of Phil's career and memory. The Humber College Comedy: Writing & Performance program in Toronto, Ontario, also has an award in Phil's memory that is given out to their Post-Graduate comedy students.\n\nPhil originally studied Graphic Design at California State University. He began to work part time as a graphic artist, designing album covers for such bands as Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young (see Crosby Stills Nash & Young) and Poco. In 1975, alongside doing album work, Phil joined the California comedy troupe, The Groundlings. While in The Groundlings, Phil worked with Paul Reubens and Jon Lovitz, who became good friends of his until his death. Phil and Paul created the character Pee Wee Herman together, and Phil even had a role on Pee-wee's Playhouse (1986) as pirate Captin' Carl.\n\nIn 1986, Phil joined the cast of Saturday Night Live (1975) and was on the show for a record of 8 seasons (which was later broken by Tim Meadows). Phil played a wide range of characters including: Frank Sinatra, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Ed McMahon, Barbara Bush, and many others. He was known to help out other writers who wanted to get their sketches read and onto the show. He held Saturday Night Live (1975) together during his 8-year reign, thus the nickname he garnered while on the show, \"The Glue.\" Phil was also known for his voice work on commercials and cartoons. He was probably most well known for the voices of Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz on the animated comedy Die Simpsons (1989). He also provided other minor voices for Die Simpsons (1989). Phil left Saturday Night Live (1975) in 1994, and in 1995, was cast in the critically acclaimed NBC show News Radio (1995) as arrogant radio show host Bill McNeal.\n\nAfter Phil's death, Phil's good friend Jon Lovitz attempted to fill the void as Max Lewis on News Radio (1995), but the struggling show's ratings dropped, and the show later fizzled out and ended in 1999. Phil had an interesting career in movies, mostly playing supporting characters. He was the lead in Der Hausfreund (1995) and was also in Greedy (1994), Versprochen ist versprochen (1996), Immer Ärger mit Sergeant Bilko (1996), and his last live action film, Small Soldiers (1998). His last role was the English language dub of Kikis kleiner Lieferservice (1989), as the quick-witted cat Jiji, which featured Small Soldiers co-star Kirsten Dunst in the lead voice role.\n\nOn May 28th, 1998, Phil was shot to death while sleeping in his Encino, California home by his wife, Brynn Hartman. Brynn left the house and later came back with a friend to show him Phil's body. When her friend went to call 911, Brynn locked herself in the bedroom with Phil's lifeless body and shot herself. It was later discovered by the coroner that Brynn had alcohol, cocaine, and the antidepressant, Zoloft, in her system. They left behind two children, Sean Edward (b. 1988) and Birgen (b. 1992). Phil and Brynn's bodies were cremated and spread upon Catalina Island, just off the coast of California, on June 4, 1998. Phil had specifically stated in his will that he wanted the ashes spread on Catalina Island because it was his favorite holiday getaway as he was an avid boater, surfer and general lover of the sea.\n\nPhil was a very caring and sensitive person and was described as \"very sweet and kind of quiet.\"\n\nElizabeth Rosemond Taylor was considered one of the last, if not the last, major star to have come out of the old Hollywood studio system. She was known internationally for her beauty, especially for her violet eyes, with which she captured audiences early in her youth and kept the world hooked with ever after.\n\nTaylor was born on February 27, 1932 in London, England. Although she was born an English subject, her parents, Sara Taylor (née Sara Viola Warmbrodt) and Francis Taylor, were Americans, art dealers from St. Louis, Missouri. Her father had moved to London to set up a gallery prior to Elizabeth's birth. Her mother had been an actress on the stage, but gave up that vocation when she married. Elizabeth lived in London until the age of seven, when the family left for the US when the clouds of war began brewing in Europe in 1939. They sailed without her father, who stayed behind to wrap up the loose ends of the art business.\n\nThe family relocated to Los Angeles, where Mrs. Taylor's own family had moved. Mr. Taylor followed not long afterward. A family friend noticed the strikingly beautiful little Elizabeth and suggested that she be taken for a screen test. Her test impressed executives at Universal Pictures enough to sign her to a contract. Her first foray onto the screen was in There's One Born Every Minute (1942), released when she was ten. Universal dropped her contract after that one film, but Elizabeth was soon picked up by MGM.\n\nThe first production she made with that studio was Heimweh (1943), and on the strength of that one film, MGM signed her for a full year. She had minuscule parts in her next two films, The White Cliffs of Dover (1944) and Die Waise von Lowood (1943) (the former made while she was on loan to 20th Century-Fox). Then came the picture that made Elizabeth a star: MGM's Kleines Mädchen, großes Herz (1944). She played Velvet Brown opposite Mickey Rooney. The film was a smash hit, grossing over $4 million. Elizabeth now had a long-term contract with MGM and was its top child star. She made no films in 1945, but returned in 1946 in Held auf vier Pfoten (1946), another success. In 1947, when she was 15, she starred in Unser Leben mit Vater (1947) with such heavyweights as William Powell, Irene Dunne and Zasu Pitts, which was one of the biggest box office hits of the year. She also co-starred in the ensemble film Kleine tapfere Jo (1949), which was also a box office huge success.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Elizabeth appeared in film after film with mostly good results, starting with her role in the George Stevens film Ein Platz an der Sonne (1951), co-starring her good friend Montgomery Clift. The following year, she co-starred in Ivanhoe - Der schwarze Ritter (1952), one of the biggest box office hits of the year. Her busiest year was 1954. She had a supporting role in the box office flop Beau Brummell - Rebell und Verführer (1954), but later that year starred in the hits Damals in Paris (1954) and Elefantenpfad (1954). She was 22 now, and even at that young age was considered one of the world's great beauties. In 1955 she appeared in the hit Giganten (1956) with James Dean.\n\nSadly, Dean never saw the release of the film, as he died in a car accident in 1955. The next year saw Elizabeth co-star with Montgomery Clift in Das Land des Regenbaums (1957), an overblown epic made, partially, in Kentucky. Critics called it dry as dust. In addition, Clift was seriously injured during the film, with Taylor helping save his life. Despite the film's shortcomings and off-camera tragedy, Elizabeth was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Southern belle Susanna Drake. However, on Oscar night the honor went to Joanne Woodward for Eva mit 3 Gesichtern (1957).\n\nIn 1958 Elizabeth starred as Maggie Pollitt in Die Katze auf dem heißen Blechdach (1958). The film received rave reviews from the critics and Elizabeth was nominated again for an Academy Award for best actress, but this time she lost to Susan Hayward in Laßt mich leben (1958). She was still a hot commodity in the film world, though. In 1959 she appeared in another mega-hit and received yet another Oscar nomination for Plötzlich im letzten Sommer (1959). Once again, however, she lost out, this time to Simone Signoret for Der Weg nach oben (1958). Her Oscar drought ended in 1960 when she brought home the coveted statue for her performance in Telefon Butterfield 8 (1960) as Gloria Wandrous, a call girl who is involved with a married man. Some critics blasted the movie but they couldn't ignore her performance. There were no more films for Elizabeth for three years. She left MGM after her contract ran out, but would do projects for the studio later down the road. In 1963 she starred in Cleopatra (1963), which was one of the most expensive productions up to that time--as was her salary, a whopping $1,000,000. The film took years to complete, due in part to a serious illness during which she nearly died.\n\nThis was the film where she met her future and fifth husband, Richard Burton (the previous four were Conrad Hilton, Michael Wilding, Mike Todd--who died in a plane crash--and Eddie Fisher). Her next films, Hotel International (1963) and ...die alles begehren (1965), were lackluster at best. Elizabeth was to return to fine form, however, with the role of Martha in Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf? (1966). Her performance as the loudmouthed, shrewish, unkempt, yet still alluring Martha was easily her finest to date. For this she would win her second Oscar and one that was more than well-deserved. The following year, she and Burton co-starred in Der Widerspenstigen Zähmung (1967), again giving winning performances. However, her films afterward were box office failures, including Spiegelbild im goldenen Auge (1967), Die Stunde der Komödianten (1967), Brandung (1968) (again co-starring with Burton), Die Frau aus dem Nichts (1968), Das einzige Spiel in der Stadt (1970), X, Y und Zee (1972), Hammersmith ist raus (1972) (with Burton again), Die Rivalin (1973), Die Nacht der tausend Augen (1973), The Driver's Seat (1974), Der blaue Vogel (1976) (considered by many to be her worst), Eine kleine Nachtmusik (1977), and Philadelphia Clan (1979) (a controversial film which was never given a full release and in which she only had a small role). She later appeared in some movies, both theatrical and made-for-television, and a number of television programs. In February 1997, Elizabeth entered the hospital for the removal of a brain tumor. The operation was successful. As for her private life, she divorced Burton in 1974, only to remarry him in 1975 and divorce him, permanently, in 1976. She had two more husbands, U.S. Senator John Warner and construction worker Larry Fortensky, whom she met in rehab.\n\nIn 1959, Taylor converted to Judaism, and continued to identify herself as Jewish throughout her life, being active in Jewish causes. Upon the death of her friend, actor Rock Hudson, in 1985, she began her crusade on behalf of AIDS sufferers. In the 1990s, she also developed a successful series of scents. In her later years, her acting career was relegated to the occasional TV-movie or TV guest appearance.\n\nElizabeth Taylor died on March 23, 2011 in Los Angeles, from congestive heart failure. Her final resting place is Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Glendale, California.\n\nWithout a doubt Gary Coleman was THE child TV star of the late 1970s and early 1980s. A refreshingly confident little tyke with sparkling dark, saucer-like eyes and an ingratiating, take-on-anyone burst of personality, the boy charmed the pants right off of TV viewers the minute he was glimpsed in national commercials. Amazed by how mature he came across, Gary was in truth older than he looked, which was brought upon by a congenital kidney condition. Sadly, the pint-sized phenomena outgrew his chubby-cheeked welcome and found the course of his grown-up Hollywood career brutally rough and patchy. The fragile condition of his health coupled with this lack of adult career acceptance, sparked an aggressively defensive behavior mechanism in his adult years and led to great personal unhappiness, chronic legal/financial hassles and early death.\n\nHe was born Gary Wayne Coleman on February 8, 1968, to a homeless woman, and was adopted by a fork-lift operator and his nurse practitioner wife from a Chicago hospital when he was just a few days old. Raised in Zion, Illinois, it was discovered that little Gary had severe health issues before the age of 2. Born with one atrophied kidney and an endangering weak second one, he had two kidney transplants by the time he reached age 16 and the effects of his dialysis medication permanently stunted his growth (to 4'8\").\n\nA highly precocious comedy cut-up on-camera, Gary proved a natural in local Chicago commercials. As his commercials spread nationwide, audiences began wondering just who this diminutive dynamo was. Norman Lear's talent scout spotted him in a Chicago bank commercial (he was 9 at the time) and decided to reveal to the world who the little guy was. Brought in to brighten up such Lear sitcoms as \"The Jeffersons\" and \"Good Times\" (the latter as a friend of little Janet Jackson's character), NBC quickly recognized the boy's comedy prowess and handed the 10-year-old his own prime-time sitcom playground to mug in.\n\nWhile Noch Fragen Arnold? (1978)'s underlying approach was to preach racial and social tolerance (it revolved around two lower-class African-American brothers from Harlem who are taken in and adopted by a wealthy, debonair Park Avenue white man after their housekeeper mother dies), the show's powers-that-be smartly deduced that it was the wisecracking gifts of young Coleman, who played the youngest brother, Arnold Jackson, that gave the show its spark. Deemed \"NBC's Littlest Big Man,\" Gary's sly, pouting-lipped delivery of, \"What'chu talkin' about, Willis?\" soon became a popular American catchphrase.\n\nLegendary comics such as Bob Hope and Lucille Ball absolutely gushed about the little boy's comedy genius and Gary soon became a hit on the talk show circuit, trading clever banter with the likes of Johnny Carson among others. The boy was also outfitted with a series of lightweight TV-movie showcases which included The Kid from Left Field (1979), Scout's Honor (1980), The Kid with the Broken Halo (1982), Das kleine Superhirn (1983), The Fantastic World of D.C. Collins (1984) and Playing with Fire (1985). All of them wisely centered around Gary's adorable persona. Modest film comedies also came his way with Der Millionen-Dollar-Junge (1981) and Jimmy the Kid (1982). Topping it all off, the Hanna-Barbera-produced series The Gary Coleman Show (1982) produced an animated version of the child star. Little Gary would make close to $18 million during his nearly decade-long TV reign.\n\nLike many others in his shoes, however, the aging Coleman felt trapped and pigeonholed by his stifling juvenile image and begged to get out from under it. The 18-year-old was truly thankful when the series ended in 1986. Coleman found, however, that a very fickle public was not as receptive to seeing him grow up. Like fellow TV star Emmanuel Lewis, Coleman began aging in appearance but remained trapped in the body of a young boy and the contrast proved too strange for audiences. As a result, Hollywood had little resources as to what to do with Gary Coleman the man. It wasn't long before Coleman was reduced to making weird guest appearances and small parts in even smaller films.\n\nThis crash course in reality triggered an increasingly erratic and aggressive behavior in Gary Coleman as he became increasingly angry and bitter about his lack of work when he was so used to be on top of everything. The subsequent tragedies suffered by all three young stars from the \"Diff'rent Strokes\" show, in fact, was sold out as a jinx package known as the \"Diff'rent Strokes curse\". While distaff co-star Dana Plato fell heavily into drug addiction, petty crime and pornography before taking her own life in 1999, Todd Bridges, who played Coleman's older brother, battled major cocaine abuse and was later charged (but acquitted of) attempted murder in the late 1980s.\n\nIn addition to his life-long health issues, Gary's adult problems came in the form of scattered financial and legal entanglements, as well as scrapes with the law. He was once arrested in 1999 for punching a persistent female autograph fan, in which he was fined and ordered to take anger-management classes. This became tabloid fodder for late night comics who joked that he must have landed \"several good uppercuts.\" He also had many disorderly conduct and reckless driving charges brought up against him at various times. He would admit that the tally of his life problems led to more than a few feigned suicide attempts. In 1989, Coleman successfully sued his adopted parents and business manager after they allegedly pilfered his youthful fortune for their own self interest totaling $3.8 million in losses, and he won $1,280,000. Despite the large settlement, all of the money was soon spent on taxes, legal fees, as well as his increasingly high medical bills for his continuing dialysis treatments. As a result by 1999 (with no steady acting work) Coleman had to declare bankruptcy, finding work outside the Hollywood industry as a security guard. For self-preservation, he went the reality-show route and became the object of self-mocking cameos to help bring in some cash. As a gag, he ran for California's 2003 governorship during its recall election.\n\nIn 2007, he married the much younger actress Shannon Price, whom he met on the set of the low budget film Church Ball (2006), but the quickly marriage dissolved quickly into domestic squabbles that put him in front of the court system yet again on domestic abuse charges. He later moved and settled in Utah.\n\nIn early 2009, Coleman managed to star in his very last film, the crude independent comedy Midgets vs. Mascots (2009) filmed in Dallas, Texas before the end came. Following heart surgery complicated by pneumonia in the fall of 2009, he suffered a heart seizure in February 2010 while performing on a Hollywood set. The 42-year-old actor died of a brain hemorrhage on May 28, 2010, after suffering an epidural haematoma from a fall at home. A sad end to a very bright and talented, but very troubled and bitter, child star who, at his peak, brought such joy to TV audiences.\n\nA master musician, a film producer and actor, best known as the lead guitarist and occasionally lead vocalist of The Beatles, George Harrison was born February 25, 1943, in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. He was also the youngest of four children, born to Harold Harrison and Louise Harrison.\n\nLike his future band mates, Harrison was not born into wealth. Louise was largely a stay-at-home mom while her husband Harold drove a school bus for the Liverpool Institute, an acclaimed grammar school that George attended and where he first met a young classmate, Paul McCartney. By his own admission, Harrison was not much of a student and what little interest he did have for his studies washed away with his discovery of the electric guitar and American rock-'n'-roll.\n\nThere were a lot of harmonies in the Harrison household. He had a knack of sorts for it by age 12 or 13, while riding a bike around his neighborhood and hearing Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\", playing from a nearby house. By the age of 14 George--who was a fan of such legends as , Harrison, who grew up in the likes of listening to such rock legends Carl Perkins, Little Richard and Buddy Holly--had purchased his first guitar and taught himself a few chords.\n\nMcCartney', who had recently joined up with another Liverpool teenager, John Lennon, in a skiffle group known as The Quarrymen, invited Harrison to see the band perform. Harrison and Lennon had a few things in common, such as the fact that they both attended Dovedale Primary School but didn't know each other. Their paths finally crossed in early 1958. McCartney had been egging the 17-year-old Lennon to allow the 14-year-old Harrison to join the band, but Lennon was reluctant; as legend has it, after seeing McCartney and Lennon perform, George was granted an audition on the upper deck of a bus, where he wowed Lennon with his rendition of popular American rock riffs.\n\nThe 17-year-old Harrison's music career was in full swing by 1960. Lennon had renamed the band The Beatles and the young group began cutting its rock teeth in the small clubs and bars around Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany. Within two years, the group had a new drummer, Ringo Starr, and a manager, Brian Epstein, a young record store owner who eventually landed the group a record contract with EMI's Parlophone label.\n\nBefore the end of 1962, Harrison and The Beatles recorded a song, \"Love Me Do\", that landed in the UK Top 20 charts. Early that following year, another hit, \"Please Please Me,\" was released, followed by an album by the same name. \"Beatlemania\" was in full swing across England, and by early 1964, with the release of their album in the US and an American tour, it had swept across the States as well.\n\nLargely referred to as the \"Quiet Beatle\" Harrison took a back seat to McCartney, Lennon and, to a certain extent, Starr. Still, he could be quick-witted, even edgy. During the middle of one American tour, the group members were asked how they slept at night with long hair.\n\nFrom the get-go, Lennon-McCartney were primary lead vocalists. While the two spent most of the time writing their own songs, Harrison had shown an early interest in creating his own work. In the summer of 1963 he spearheaded his first song, \"Don't Bother Me,\" which made its way on to the group's second album. From there on out, Harrison's songs were a staple of all Beatle records. In fact, some of the group's more memorable songs--e.g., \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Something,\" which was the only Beatle song ever recorded by Frank Sinatra--were penned by Harrison.\n\nHowever, his influence on the group and pop music in general extended beyond just singles. In 1965, while on the set of The Beatles' second film, Hi-Hi-Hilfe! (1965), Harrison took an interest in some of the Eastern instruments and their musical arrangements that were being used in the film. He soon developed a deep interest in Indian music. He taught himself the sitar, introducing the instrument to many western ears on Lennon's song, \"Norwegian Wood\"\" He soon cultivated a close relationship with renowned sitar player Ravi Shankar. Other groups, including The Rolling Stones, began incorporating the sitar into some of their work. It could be argued that Harrison's experimentation with different kinds of instrumentation helped pave the way for such ground-breaking Beatle albums as \"Revolver\" and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".\n\nHarrison's interest in Indian music soon extended into a yearning to learn more about eastern spiritual practices. In 1968 he led The Beatles on a journey to northern India to study transcendental meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.\n\nHaving grown spiritually and musically since the group first started, Harrison, who wanted to include more of his material on Beatle records, was clearly uneasy with the McCartney-Lennon dominance of the group. During the \"Let It Be\" recording sessions in 1969, Harrison walked out, staying away for several weeks before he was coaxed to come back with the promise that the band would use more of his songs on its records.\n\nHowever, tensions in the group were clearly high. Lennon and McCartney had ceased writing together years before, and they, too, were feeling the need to go in a different direction. In January of 1970 the group recorded Harrison's \"I Me Mine.\" It was the last song the four would ever record together. Three months later, McCartney announced he was leaving the band and The Beatles were officially over.\n\nAfter the breakup of The Beatles, Harrison pursued a solo career. He immediately assembled a studio band consisting of ex-Beatle Starr, guitar legend Eric Clapton, keyboardist Billy Preston and others to record all the songs that had never made it on to The Beatles catalog. The result was a three-disc album, \"All Things Must Pass\". While one of its signature songs, \"My Sweet Lord,\" was later deemed too similar in style to The Chiffons' 1963 hit \"He's So Fine,\" forcing the guitarist to cough up nearly $600,000, the album as a whole remains Harrison's most acclaimed record.\n\nNot long after the album's release, Harrison combined his charitable work and his continued passion for the east when he put together a series of ground-breaking benefit concerts at New York City's Madison Square Garden to raise money for refugees in Bangladesh. Known as the \"Concert for Bangladesh\", the shows, which featured Bob Dylan, Leon Russell, and Ravi Shankar, would go on to raise some $15 million for UNICEF, produced a Grammy-winning album, a successful documentary film (The Concert for Bangladesh (1972)) and laid the groundwork for future benefit shows like \"Live Aid\" and \"Farm Aid\".\n\nNot everything about post-Beatle life went smoothly for Harrison, though. In 1974, his marriage to Pattie Boyd, whom he'd married eight years before, ended when she left him for Eric Clapton. His studio work struggled, too, from 1973-77, starting with, \"Living in the Material World\", \"Extra Texture,\" and \"33 1/3,\" all of which failed to meet sales expectations.\n\nFollowing the release of that last album, Harrison took a short break from music, winding down his own label, Dark Horse Records--which he had started in 1974, and which had released albums by a number of other bands--and started his own film production company, Handmade Films. The company produced the successful Monty Python film Das Leben des Brian (1979) and would go on to make 26 other films before Harrison sold his interest in the company in 1994.\n\nIn 1979, he returned to the studio to release his self-titled album. It was followed two years later by, \"Somewhere in England,\" which was still being worked on at the time of John Lennon's assassination in December of 1980. The record eventually included the Lennon tribute track, \"All Those Years Ago,\" a song that reunited ex-Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, along with ex-Wings members Denny Laine and Linda McCartney. While the song was a hit, the album, its predecessor and its successor, \"Gone Troppo,\" weren't. For Harrison the lack of commercial appeal and the constant battles with music executives proved draining and prompted another studio hiatus.\n\nA comeback of sorts came in November 1987, however, with the release of the album \"Cloud Nine,\" produced by Jeff Lynne (of Electric Light Orchestra). The album turned out several top-charting hits, including \"Got My Mind Set On You\"-- remake of the 1962 song by Rudy Clark--and \"When We Was Fab,\" a song that reflected on the life of Beatlemania, with Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney, who was dressed up as a walrus, but was a camera shy, in February 1988. Later that year Harrison formed The Traveling Wilburys. The group consisted of Harrison, Lynne, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and Bob Dylan, and spawned two successful albums. Buoyed by the group's commercial success, Harrison took to the road with his new bandmates in 1992, embarking on his first international tour in 18 years.\n\nNot long afterwards he was reunited with McCartney and Starr for the creation of an exhaustive three-part release of a Beatles anthology--which featured alternative takes, rare tracks and a John Lennon demo called \"Free as a Bird,\" that the three surviving Beatles completed in the studio. The song went on to become the group's 34th Top 10 single. After that, however, Harrison largely became a homebody, keeping himself busy with gardening and his cars at his expansive and restored home in Henley-on-Thames in south Oxfordshire, England.\n\nStill, the ensuing years were not completely stress-free. In 1997, Harrison, a longtime smoker, was successfully treated for throat cancer. Eighteen months later, his life was again put on the line when a deranged 33-year-old Beatles fan somehow managed to circumvent Harrison's intricate security system and broke into his home, attacking the musician and his wife Olivia with a knife. Harrison was treated for a collapsed lung and minor stab wounds. Olivia suffered several cuts and bruises.\n\nIn May 2001, Harrison's cancer returned. There was lung surgery, but doctors soon discovered the cancer had spread to his brain. That autumn, he traveled to the US for treatment and was eventually hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA. He died November 29, 2001, at ex-bandmate McCartney's house in Los Angeles, at aged 58, with his wife and son at his side.\n\nJust one year after his death, Harrison's final studio album, \"Brainwashed,\" was released. It was produced by Lynne, Harrison's son Dhani Harrison and Harrison himself, and featured a collection of songs he'd been working at the time of his death. Dhani finished putting the album together and it was released in November of 2002.\n\nSignifying intelligence, eloquence, versatility and quiet intensity, one of the more important, critically acclaimed black actors to gain a Hollywood foothold in the 1970s was Paul Winfield. He was born in 1939 in Dallas, Texas, where he lived in his early years before moving with his family to Los Angeles' Watts district. He showed early promise as a student at Manual Arts High School, earning distinction with several performance awards. As a senior, he earned his first professional acting job and extended his theatrical education with a two-year scholarship to the University of Portland in Oregon. Subsequent scholarships led to his studies at Stanford and Los Angeles City College, among other colleges. He left U.C.L.A. just six credits short of his Bachelor's degree.\n\nPaul's first big break came in 1964 when actor/director Burgess Meredith gave him a role in Le Roi Jones' controversial one-act play \"The Dutchman and the Toilet\". Director Meredith cast him again four years in \"The Latent Heterosexual\" with Zero Mostel. Although he won a contract at Columbia Pictures in 1966 and built up his on-camera career with a succession of television credits, he continued to focus on the legitimate stage. A member of the Stanford Repertory Theatre, he concentrated on both classic and contemporary plays. In 1969, Paul joined the Inner City Cultural Center Theatre in Los Angeles for two years, which offered a drama program for high school students.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Paul redirected himself back to performing on television and in films with guest work in more than 40 series on the small screen, including a boyfriend role on the first season of the landmark black sitcom Julia (1968) starring Diahann Carroll. In films, he was given a featured role in the Sidney Poitier film Es führt kein Weg zurück (1969), and earned comparable roles in Kampf den Talaren (1970) and Brother John (1971) before major stardom occurred.\n\n1972 proved to be a banner year for Paul after winning the male lead opposite Cicely Tyson in the touching classic film Das Jahr ohne Vater (1972). His towering performance as a sharecropper who is imprisoned and tortured for stealing a ham for his impoverished family earned him an Oscar nomination for \"Best Actor\" -- the third black actor (Sidney Poitier and James Earl Jones preceded him) to receive such an honor at the time.\n\nFrom there a host of films and quality television roles began arriving on his doorstep. In mini-movies, Paul portrayed various historical/entertainment giants including Thurgood Marshall, Don King and baseball's Roy Campanella, and was Emmy-nominated for his portrayal of Martin Luther King, Jr. in King (1978) with Sounder co-star Cicely Tyson as wife Coretta. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he earned solid distinction in such prestige projects as Weißes Haus, Hintereingang (1979), Roots - Die nächsten Generationen (1979) (another Emmy nomination), The Sophisticated Gents (1981), Die Blauen und die Grauen (1982), Sister, Sister (1982), James Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain (1985), Goodbye America (1986) and The Women of Brewster Place (1989).\n\nAlthough the big screen did not offer the same consistent quality following his breakthrough with Sounder, he nevertheless turned in strong roles in Conrack (1974), Huckleberry Finn (1974), A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich (1977) (again with Ms. Tyson), Straße der Verdammnis (1977), Star Trek II - Der Zorn des Khan (1982) and Der weiße Hund von Beverly Hills (1982).\n\nSurprisingly, Paul never achieved the promise of a Sidney Poitier-like stardom and his roles diminished in size. Relegated to character roles, he still appeared in such quality television as Maggie, Maggie! (1994), although he was not the major focus. After two nominations, he finally won the Emmy for a guest performance as a judge on Picket Fences: Tatort Gartenzaun (1992). Paul's showier work at this period of time included the film Catfish in Black Bean Sauce (1999) and a surprise cross-dressing cameo as Aunt Matilda in Relax... It's Just Sex (1998).\n\nOn stage, Paul graced such productions as \"Richard III\" (at New York's Lincoln Center Theatre), \"Othello\", \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", \"The Seagull\", \"A Few Good Men\", \"Happy Endings\" and \"Checkmates\", which became his sole Broadway credit. Paul also served as Artist in Residence at the University of Hawaii and subsequently at the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n\nIn his final years, Winfield narrated the A&E crime series City Confidential (1998), appeared as a teacher in a television adaptation of his earlier success Sounder (2003), and enjoyed a recurring role as Sam for many years on the series Ein Hauch von Himmel (1994).\n\nSuffering from obesity and diabetes in later life, Paul Winfield passed away from a heart attack at age 64 in 2004, and was survived by a sister, Patricia. His longtime companion of 30 years, set designer and architect Charles Gillan Jr. predeceased him by two years.\n\nVeteran comedic actor Tom Poston, he with the bugged-out eyes that commonly accentuated a vague look of bewilderment, was born in Columbus, Ohio, on October 17, 1921. By age nine, the young boy was appearing with an acrobatic troupe.\n\nPoston later attended Bethany College in West Virginia when World War II broke out and he joined the U.S. Army Air Corps. He won medals for his courage under fire, and rose to the rank of captain. While he never returned to Bethany College, he would later receive an honorary doctorate from the institution. Following his military service, Poston went to New York and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA), training with acting guru Sanford Meisner, among others. Making his Broadway debut in 1947 in José Ferrer's production of \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", Poston had the makings of a serious dramatic actor, appearing in such classics as \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" and \"King Lear\".\n\nAlthough he also appeared seriously in TV drama in the early stages, comedy would become his forte. Hosting the amusing daily TV show \"Entertainment\" led to his biggest break on The Steve Allen Show (1956). He, Louis Nye, Don Knotts, and other members of Allen's stock company became famous for their hilarious characters in Allen's famed sketch sequences. Poston himself would be best remembered as the \"Man on the Street\" interviewee who could never remember his own name. Winning an Emmy during those four seasons (1956-60), Poston went on to host another program, this time a game show, entitled Split Personality (1959).\n\nHe developed an affinity for parlor games and appeared as a panelist on other quiz shows as well, notably To Tell the Truth (1956). Given a chance to star in his own comedy films by the early 1960s, Poston went completely unnoticed in such blah vehicles as Zotz! (1962) and Das alte finstere Haus (1963), which failed to capitalize on his delightfully bungling, eccentric humor, although he did turn in a very funny supporting performance as a perpetually soused playboy in the Dick Van Dyke comedy Der 25 Millionen Dollar Preis (1971).\n\nAfter his movie career dried up, television again became the object of his affection, usually in service to other stars. Alongside such top comedians as Bob Newhart (Newhart (1982)) and Robin Williams (Mork vom Ork (1978)), Poston's absent-minded \"second banana\" foils found their engaging niche. The comedic actor also continued with light comedy theater vehicles such as \"Forty Carats\", \"Come Blow Your Horn\", \"Plaza Suite\", and \"Mary, Mary\", and even managed a few musicals (\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof\").\n\nPoston had a pre-fame first marriage that ended in divorce. His second wife was film actress Jean Sullivan. Their daughter, Francesca Poston, also became an actress. He had two other children by third wife Kay, who was 22 years his junior: son Jason and daughter Hudson. They divorced in 1975, but remarried in 1980 and remained together until her death at age 54 in 1998 from ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). He and Kay appeared on many telethons to discuss the crippling disease. Three years later, Poston found happiness again when he married Suzanne Pleshette (they originally met while appearing in the 1959 Broadway comedy \"Golden Fleecing\", then worked again together on the old The Bob Newhart Show (1972)). He continued to provide glum, baggy-eyed comedy relief on TV as an octogenarian up until the end. Sadly, while wife Suzanne was battling cancer, Poston passed away unexpectedly of respiratory failure at his Los Angeles home on April 30, 2007, after a brief illness. Pleshette died on January 19, 2008.\n\nThe stalwart actor may not have nabbed top comic superstardom in his heyday, but he certainly enjoyed a long, durable career doing what he did best -- acting goofy and giving audiences a reason to smile."
