        "text": "ROBERT JOSEPH or JOSEPH ROBERT WOODWARD\n\nRemembered with honour Brandhoek Military Cemetery: Plot I, Row N, Grave 21.\n\nHe enlisted in Watford; was entitled to the Victory, British War and 1914-15 Star medals, his qualifying date being 26 November 1915, and was killed in action. Unfortunately, Robert’s Service Record appears to be one that did not survive the World War Two bombing.\n\nThere is a brief article about and a Death announcement for Robert in the West Herts and Watford Observer dated 4 August 1917.\n\nSon of Amy Elizabeth GOODMAN (formerly WOODWARD) and the late Robert WOODWARD; husband of Maul Ethel (nee GAGGIN) WOODWARD of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.\n\nHis parent’s marriage is proving elusive. However, it is assumed that Robert died at some point because Amy Elizabeth WOODWARD married John GOODMAN 1894 in the Watford district. John died 1936 in Watford aged 70, and was buried 16 May in Vicarage Road Cemetery, Watford; Amy died 1952 in Watford aged 88, and was buried 24 December, also in Vicarage Road Cemetery.\n\nRobert was born 31 July 1889 in Watford, and attended Beechen Grove Board School, Watford, from 11 July 1898 to 30 July 1903. He married 1913 in the Watford district, and resided in Watford.\n\nOn the 1891 Census, aged 1 he lived in Watford, with one sibling and his grandmother. On the 1901 Census, aged 11 he still lived in Watford, with his mother, step-father and three siblings. On the 1911 Census, a butcher aged 21 [listed as GOODMAN] he still lived in Watford, with his mother, step-father and five siblings [all GOODMAN]."
