        "text": "This is the work of Joyce Hetrick\n\nAaron Simpson-4 During the Revolution\n\nJohn Simpson-1; Richard-2; George-3; Aaron-4; Enoch-5\n\nAccording to his pension, AARON SIMPSON-4 enlisted in the Revolutionary forces in the fall of 1776, and served until December, 1777, as a private in Captain Thomas Pollard’s Company. Earlier and later tax records in Fairfax listed the majority of the SIMPSONs living in the district of “Captain Thomas Pollard.” We assume that this was the same Thomas Pollard also mentioned in HENRY WISHEART’s will. HENRY WISHEART was a neighbor of the SIMPSONs, and AARON-4 would later marry his daughter, CHARLOTTE. Two of AARON’s brothers would marry CHARLOTTE’s two sisters.\n\nThomas Pollard and his brother, William, were brothers of Jane Pollard Dandridge, the widow of the very wealthy spendthrift, Nathaniel West-Dandridge. They were the children of Joseph Pollard, Clerk of Goochland County. After Dandridge’s death, Jane was contemplating marriage to Thomas Underwood, and executed a deed of trust to Thomas and William Pollard to hold lands in trust, and relinquished her dower interest in Thomas Underwood’s estate. She left the lands she held in fee simple to her sisters, Frances Rogers, Elizabeth Meriwether, Millie Pendleton, Sarah Pendleton, and Anne Taylor, and her niece, Elizabeth Johnson. [Virginia Migrations: Hanover County, Virginia, pg. 90.]\n\nAn article, “The Pollard Family” taken from Genealogies of Virginia Families, Volume IV, Broderbund Software, Inc. Family Tree Maker, March 3, 1998, states “in an account taken from the Bible now in the family, recorded in the handwriting of the late venerable Judge Pendleton, who at his death,….October 26, 1803, in his eighty-third year…” [Pg. 130.] “Thomas Pollard, born September 30th, 1741, is nearly 73. He rode on horseback from Kentucky, a year or two ago, and means to return shortly.”\n\nAARON-4 was also a volunteer under the command of Colonel Peter Waggoner. He had been stationed in Colchester and Alexandria and marched to Mt. Vernon, Georgetown, Maryland, Fredericktown, Little York, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His commanding officers were Colonels Rumly, Colpin, and Major James Ren. He was also, at one point, under the command of General George Washington, himself.\n\nAARON-4 was discharged in the vicinity of Philadelphia and during the time he served, he was discharged home several times and then called back.\n\nServing with AARON was Moses Simpson, and several of his cousins. CHARLOTTE applied for a widow’s pension and this Moses, living then in 1832 in Guilford County, North Carolina, wrote an affidavit for the claim detailing their services together and separately. Moses said he served “seven marches” with AARON-4. One source says that this Moses Simpson was “the son of a Moses and Margaret Simpson from Anne Arundell County, Maryland, who didn’t come to Guilford County, North Carolina, until about 1800,” but the author thinks that the Revolutionary pension application does not substantiate this theory. The author believes that this Moses was a cousin of AARON’s. More specifically, Erick Montgomery thinks that this Moses is the Moses-son-of-William Simpson, who was the son of Thomas Simpson, Carpenter. Baxter, a son of Thomas Simpson, lived in Fairfax as well. We can eliminate several of the men named Moses Simpson as this man. We know he was not Moses-3-brother-of-GEORGE-3, or Moses-5-son-of-AARON-4, so it is likely he was a cousin, because another affidavit with AARON-4’s pension by Thomas Garrott, dated May, 1843, states that Thomas had known Moses Simpson, of Guilford County, North Carolina, formerly of Fairfax, for over 43 years. Thomas Garrott, born about 1775 in Fairfax, had married Susan Simpson, daughter of William Simpson of Fairfax, and moved to Caswell County, North Carolina, about 1800. Apparently, this Moses, and Thomas Garrott, had come to Caswell from Fairfax about the same time AARON did. Thomas Garrott, according to Erick Montgomery, married Susan, daughter of William and Jane Wisheart Simpson.\n\nMoses’ affidavit reads in part:\n\nJanuary 1843, personally appeared before me, Francis L. Simpson [his son] a Justice of the Peace in and for the County of Guilford and State aforesaid [North Carolina] Moses Simpson, a resident of Guilford County, and maid [sic] oath in due form of law that he was well acquainted with Aaron Simpson from his youth until his death and that he entered in the army with him in the service of the United States in the fall of the year 1776 the precise time not recalled and as a volunteer and served personally with him seven campaigns in Capt. Thomas Pollard’s company under Col. Pete Waggoner first campaign marched from home to Colechester, Virginia stationed there and time of May not recalled. Second Campaign from thence to Alexandra Virginia now the district of Columbia, stationed there time not remembered. Third campaign from thence to Colechester Virginia there stationed time not recalled, fourth campaign from thence to Alexandria stationed there time not remembered fifth campaign from thence to Mount Vernon the residence of General George Washington there stationed time not remembered sixth campaign from thence to Alexandria Virginia at which time and place two British Men of War lay anchored in the river Potomac at the town of Alexandria and by the name of Roebuck name of the other not recalled; seventh campaign from thence for the city of Philadelphia and ther joined the continental army at head quarters under the command of General George Washington there stationed for three months then and there discharged in the month of December 1777.\n\nThe first governor of North Carolina was Richard Caswell, who was a resident of Orange County from about 1746 onward. He was a leader prior to the Revolution and was decidedly against the regulators in North Carolina prior to the actual revolution. He was a general officer in North Carolina in the Revolution itself and was a very popular officer. He was a general at the defeat at Camden with General Gates. Caswell County was named for him. AARON and several of his brothers would move to Caswell County.\n\nGEORGE SIMPSON-3 died at the conclusion of the Revolution on November 18, 1782. He and SUSANNAH had been married nearly 40 years. He left SUSANNAH their plantation and the use of four slaves. He states in his will that he had already given portions to the married daughters and that sons, William-4, AARON-4, James-4, Joseph-4, and Richard-4, should have their part. These last five sons were probably still partly or fully dependent upon the nuclear family for support, though they were adult men at this time. We know that AARON-4 was not married at the time his father died. The Wolf Run Plantation was to be divided between four of GEORGE-3’s children. His brother, Moses-3, son, AARON-4, and son, Richard-4, were to be executors. For some reason that we can’t see now, the estate was not completely settled until September 21, 1824, when the “final report” was sent to the court “as formerly settled.” We don’t know if it was a clerical error or if some of the heirs wanted to make sure that it was all divided, or if somehow, SUSANNAH lived to be over 100 years old! The total estate amount was more than 1,000 English pounds in value, plus the land and the slaves. Obviously, GEORGE had done well for himself.

His brother, Moses-3, built one on Sandy Run in August, 1772. [Fairfax County, VA, A History.] Moses-3 apparently died without children, and left his estate to his nephews. GEORGE-3 lived long enough to see the Revolution almost over. He died in Fairfax about 1782. At least two of his sons, AARON-4 and Moses-4, fought in the Revolution, so we can know that his sympathies were with the rebels.\n\nThe year after GEORGE-4’s death, AARON SIMPSON-4 and CHARLOTTE WISHEART were married on May 25, 1783. They remained in Fairfax County and started raising a family. Sometime about 1797, they decided to move to North Carolina, where their cousins had already been living since 1751. The two must have been fairly comfortable, he having inherited a reasonable estate from his father and uncle, and she having inherited slaves and cash from her deceased father, HENRY WISHEART. They were not so wealthy that they led a life of ease, we may be sure, but were certainly better off than most of the yeoman class. CHARLOTTE had slave women to help her with the many tasks of child rearing and housework, and AARON had help in the fields with the crops. Only a very rich man could afford an overseer, so AARON probably worked in the fields beside his hands.\n\nMany Virginia lands were becoming worn out and the price of tobacco had cheapened due to the large number of slaves available to produce bumper crops. Even slave owners, such as AARON, were having trouble making a living in Virginia. [Fairfax County, Virginia---1649-1800. pg., 30.] The additional task of finding farms and plantations for his sons as they matured necessitated finding better and cheaper lands.\n\nThe 1790 United States Census for Fairfax is lost, but is somewhat replaced by the 1787 tax list for Fairfax County. AARON-4 had no military-age young men in his household, but had seven slaves, two horses, and ten head of cattle. AARON-4 was also listed as paying the poll tax for a man named Lawrence King. We have no idea who this Lawrence King was, unless he was either a poor relation, an overseer for the slaves, or a school master for the children. We know that at least some of AARON’s children were basically literate. There were no public schools available to the planters at this time, so all education of their children must be either by sending the children away to boarding school, or to teaching them at home. Some planters employed school masters or tutors for their children. Others did not educate their children at all in reading and writing.\n\nChapter VI\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nJohn Simpson-1; Richard-2; George-3; Aaron-4; Enoch-5; Mary Ann-6\n\nRichard Edmund Johnson-4\n\nRICHARD EDMUND “Dick” JOHNSON-4, the oldest son of AUSTIN JOHNSON-3, and his two sisters, grew up in Sumner County after his mother’s death. According to oral history collected by Erick Montgomery, they lived some of the time with their grandparents, the Reverend RICHARDJOHNSON-2 and his wife, LUCY. Estate accounts show that they had some education paid for from the legacy left to them by their uncle, Edmund Corley. [Estate #680, Austin Johnson, Sumner County, TN.] According to the testimony of RICHARD E. JOHNSON in the SIMPSON-Turner lawsuit [Lawsuit #13467] at the time of the death of James H. Turner, which would have been prior to RICHARD’s marriage, he was living with his sister Martha and her husband, James H. Turner, and had been there about a month prior to the death of James. He was also present at the last illness and death of James Turner.\n\nRICHARD EDMUND JOHNSON-4 married MARY ANN SIMPSON, the daughter of a neighbor, ENOCH SIMPSON, and his wife, ELIZABETH CARTER SIMPSON, on August 16, 1842, just a few years before AUSTIN’s death. AUSTIN JOHNSON’s two older daughters also married into this family, with Martha Johnson Turner marrying RICHARD’s father-in-law, ENOCH SIMPSON, and the other sister marrying the brother of RICHARD’s wife.\n\nMARY ANN SIMPSON, was the sixth generation in line of descent from seventeenth-century settlers to Stafford County, Virginia, on lands now found in Fairfax County. Her family emigrated to Virginia from Scotland, and from Virginia into North Carolina. The SIMPSONS were fairly late arrivals in Sumner County, Tennessee, coming there in the mid-1820s. MARY ANN’s father, ENOCH SIMPSON-5, was born November 1, 1797, in the part of Orange County that became Caswell County, North Carolina. Orange County was located just south of the Virginia border, about one-third of the distance west of the coast at that time, and was the parent county for several counties, including Caswell. ENOCH was one of the 11 children of a Revolutionary Soldier, AARON SIMPSON-4, and his wife, CHARLOTTE WISHEART. Both RICHARD E. JOHNSON and MARY ANN SIMPSON-6 were grandchildren of Revolutionary soldiers.\n\n“Family tradition,” as quoted in the Caswell County Heritage volume, states “Tradition says that Capt. Richard Simpson’s ancestor [who would have been MARY ANN’s ancestor as well] owned a seagoing vessel that was used for transporting immigrants from England and Scotland to Virginia, and for transporting tobacco and brandy on return trips to Europe.” No documentation to support this had been found, but we do know that the SIMPSONS were originally Scots. JOHN“The Scotsman” SIMPSON was apparently the first of this line to come to America.\n\nJOHN SIMPSON-1 was born sometime between 1645 and 1660, and came to the colonies at least by 1678. He may have been imported earlier as a head right. A “head right” was the term used to describe the right to 50 acres of land for each settler imported. In order to encourage settlment in the Virginia Colony, the Virginia Company at first gave 100 acres for each settler imported. The person who paid the way for the settler was entitled to the “head right.” Later, this was changed to 50 acres of land. The person had to spend three years, or die in the colony to entitle the person to the head right. George Brent may have been entitled to JOHN SIMPSIN’s head right. The the exact conditions of JOHN’s importation aren’t known for sure. We do know, however, that he was in Virginia by 1678 in Stafford County when he received a land patent. His arrival most likely predated the 1678 date. We know his wife,MARY, was imported to the colonies and he claimed land for her transportation. He also imported others for whom he claimed lands. He didn’t claim any lands for his children, so we may assume that they were born in the colony of Virginia. His son, John-2, deposed that he was born about 1680, and was raised on a plantation called Woodstock, owned by George Brent.\n\nJOHN’s land patent lay near some of George Brent’s lands. He may have also worked as an overseer for Brent’s plantation. George Brent was a royalist son of George Brent of Gloucestershire, England, and Marianna Peyton, daughter of Sir John Peyton of Dodington, Cambridgeshire, and came to Virginia about the year 1650, where he settled in Stafford County. He secured large grants of land, including the estates named Woodstock and Brenton. He was a Roman Catholic and King James II granted him and his associates the free exercise of their religion. He was an agent for Lord Fairfax, a member of the House of Burgesses for Stafford County in 1688, the surveyor for Stafford County, and a partner in the practice of the law with William Fitzhugh. In 1683, he was appointed receiver general north of the Rappahannock. He had patented lands there November 18, 1677, and renewed his grant by the Proprietor January 28, 1694/5 [OS/NS.]\n\nIn 1688 and 1689, there were wild rumors about Catholics inciting Indian uprisings. This caused quite a bit of danger for George Brent, but he was protected by William Fitzhugh, one of the richest and most powerful men in the colony. George Brent died about 1694.\n\nThe Scots\n\nScotland, unlike Ireland, shares the same island with England. Scotland contains two distinct groups of people. The Highland Scots, a race of fierce, war-like clans living in the Highlands, who are almost racially identical with the Irish. The Lowland Scots are a mixture of races, more racially-akin to the British subjects south of Scotland. The “Borderers,” or people who lived along the Scots-English border, were generally of the same stock as the “Lowland Scots,” regardless of whether they called themselves “English” or “Scots.” Simpson is probably a Lowland-Scot name, rather than a Highland one, but it is a patramonic name meaning “Son of Simon.” It can be spelled as Simson as well as Simpson. The Highland Scots were usually Catholic and the Lowlanders were more frequently Presbyterian, Baptist, or Quaker.\n\nThe native peoples there were known in ancient times as the Caledonians and Picts, and along the coasts, there was Norse blood mixed into the stew that comprised this hardy race of people.\n\nFor many centuries, the Scots and English were constantly at war. The resident Celts didn’t take kindly to the forcible infusion, by England, of still another group, the Flemings from Flanders [Belgium.]\n\nIn 1502, King James IV of Scotland married Mary Tudor, daughter of Henry VII of England, and sister of King Henry VIII. A hundred years later, the issue of this marriage would unite under one crown the two kingdoms of Scotland and England, in the body of King James VII of Scotland, who became King James I of England.\n\nThe religious reformation of the sixteenth century spread the doctrines of Presbyterianism. George Fox [Quakers] and the Puritans also desired to reform the established church. The Scots, especially in the lowlands, gladly received the new doctrines to replace the Catholic dogma that had, at that time, degenerated, with the illiterate, immoral priests. There was a great awakening of men’s souls. The counter reformation by Jesuit priests coming into Scotland and teaching anew the Catholic doctrine kept the Highland Scots mostly loyal to the Catholic Church.\n\nJames VII of Scotland became James I of England after the death of Queen Elizabeth. Noteworthy to James’ reign was the King James Bible translation and his son, Charles I, the first king of England to be executed by his subjects.\n\nAfter Charles I’s execution, during Cromwell’s rule, Charles II had sworn a Covenant with the Scots to secure their support in his bid to assume his dead father’s throne as king in place of Cromwell’s rule. Charles’ Scots army marched, but Cromwell had raised an army of 16,000 Englishmen. Cromwell’s force prevailed.\n\nAfter Cromwell’s death, Charles II eventually gained his father’s throne and became king of England. Several men named Simpson were in the Scots Parliament from the years 1571 to 1645, but only one surnamed Simpson served from 1645 to 1667.\n\nCompared to England, Scotland was extremely poor. The harsh climate, thin soil, social system, and constant strife, all conspired to make Scotland a difficult place in which to make a living. As a consequence of the political and religious strife, as well as poverty, Scotland’s population remained stable for centuries. Scotland was a country in which there was little security from war and pestilence. Many young men left Scotland seeking better opportunities in other countries and in the colonies. Perhaps JOHN SIMPSON-1 was one of these.\n\nWe don’t know what part of ScotlandJOHN-1 came from, or if his family went to France before coming to Virginia. The records frequently designate him as “John the Scotsman Simpson,” which makes it easy to distinguish him in some records. Since JOHN-1 came so early to the colonies, he probably had not sojourned in Ireland prior to coming to Virginia. A few of the Scots-Irish came before 1713, but most came later. Those Scotsmen coming to the colonies prior to the early 1700s usually came directly from Scotland to America.\n\nJOHN SIMPSON-1 was one of the earlier settlers in Overwharton Parish, Virginia. The parish contained the same lands as the county of Stafford. It was created in 1666 out of Westmoreland, extending to the Blue Ridge Mountains, being the frontier county, about 24 miles wide, south and west of the Potomac River. It contained what is now Prince William, Loudoun, Fairfax, Alexandria, and part of Fanquiar Counties. The lands JOHN-1 patented fall into the portion that is now Fairfax County, and lie under the city of Alexandria, near the coast. George Brent’s plantation called “Woodstock” was not very near these lands, however, and is in what is now Stafford County.\n\nJOHN SIMPSON-1 is mentioned in the “Great Hunting Creek Land Grants” in 1678 as having been granted 627 acres of land, along with a partner, John Carr. He may have acquired the land only in order to resell it, or he may have also planted and improved at least some of it. Other grants in that area had been made 20 or 30 years previously, but the land was still a wilderness when JOHN-1 settled there. He and his partner had transported 13 people, probably indentured servants, in addition to their families, at their expense in order to receive the land patents.\n\nThis same land was re-patented in January, 1694/5, to JOHN SIMPSON-1, and John Carr was only mentioned as one of the original patentees. Apparently, the original title was not good, because the man who granted the original patent did not have the right to do so. Margaret, Lady Culpepper, and Thomas, Lord Fairfax, stated in the second patent that JOHN SIMPSON had brought in the original patent issued by Herbert Jefferies “who had no right to do so.” John Carr had sold his piece of the original patent and JOHN SIMPSON reissued deeds to those buyers. George Brent also re-patented several pieces of his previously-patented lands in January 1694/5, the same day JOHN re-patented his. [Mitchell, Beginning at a White Oak, pg. 317.]\n\nHerbert Jefferies originally granted the lands both to JOHN SIMPSON-1 and his partner, Carr, and to Brent. Jefferies, who was governor of the colony, had granted the lands under seal of the colony, and later, the Proprietors reissued patents. George Brent and William Fitzhugh were agents of the Proprietors. Fitzhugh was one of the “big wigs” of the colony and owned a great deal of land. Herbert Jefferies died December 17, 1678. He was replaced by Sir Henry Chichely, who acted as Deputy Governor until Culpepper arrived.\n\nDuring these years, the price of tobacco had plummeted because of over production and decreased and restricted markets. The planters were upset with the government and with their own economic problems. They were continually on the verge of revolt. [Virginia Chronology, pg. 32-33.]\n\nJOHN SIMPSON-1 and his wife, MARY, may have married in Scotland, as she was claimed as a head right by JOHN. He may have returned to Scotland to fetch her, or he may simply have sent for her. Apparently, their married life was spent in the colony. Their children were probably all born in the colony.\n\nJohn-2, the son of JOHN-1 and MARY, gave a deposition that he was raised on a plantation named “Woodstock.” He was born about 1680, and died about 1757. He mentioned that his father “served his time” with George Brent. There is controversy over the exact meaning of these words. Did JOHN-1 come as an indentured servant of Brent’s, and therefore serve time as an indentured servant? Was Brent a militia officer under whom JOHN served, as all able-bodied men in the colony must do? Some lawsuits concerning deeds refer to George Brents as “Captain Brents.” Was JOHN-1 a hired overseer for George Brent, whose property was located “next door” to JOHN’s Great Hunting Creek Grant of 1678?\n\nChildren of John “The Scotsman” Simpson & Mary\n\nAnn Simpson-2, born about 1689, married a man named Joseph Gist [Guess]. In her eighties, she signed an affidavit about some land, giving her age, so we may be reasonably sure of the year of her birth.\n\nAn article in Tyler’s Magazine concerned a deposition by Ann Simpson Gist which was taken at the house of John Gist in Loudoun County, Virginia, May 23, 1769. “She sayeth that John Simpson of Stafford County who died about twelve years ago was the eldest son of John Simpson who was a Scotsman and the father to this deponent. That the two next eldest brothers of John Simpson and sons of the said John Simpson Scotsman died about 50 years ago [as well as she remembers] and that she understood that Henry Thompson by his last will and testament bequeathed 300 acres of land on Powell’s Creek, then in Stafford County, to the three eldest sons of the said John Simpson Scotsman. That the brothers and joint legatees with the first mentioned John Simpson died without claiming any part of the bequest and that the surviving brother John Simpson by deed gave the said 300 acres to James Haly, the present defendant.”\n\nSome researchers have supposed that because Ann’s deposition was taken at the house of “John Gist,” that he was her husband. It is more likely the man was her son. There appears to be an earlier man, named Joseph Gist [Guess], who is her husband. They appear to have also had a son named Joseph Gist [Guess.]\n\nStafford County entries show Joseph Guess living adjacent to Thomas Simpson in 1715. [NNBk. 5:135, Virginia Northern Neck Land Grants 1694-1742, Gertrude E. Gray.] In November of 1715, Joseph Guess “of Stafford County” received 280 acres on East Run of Pohick adjacent Thomas Simpson, land Guess lives on. [MM Bk. 5:98] On February 26, 1738, Sampson Darrell of Truro Parish, Prince William County, leased Joseph Guess of same, plantation now in tenure of Joseph Guess, 200 acres for natural lives of Joseph Guess and Anne his wife. [Prince William Deed Book D:40-42.] The next year, Joseph Guess of Truro Parish, Prince William County, deeded to son, William Guess, a Negro slave named Catherine and also all coopers, carpenters, joiner, and other handicraft tools. The date was October 10, 1739. On March 24, 1739/40 [OS/NS] Anne Guess was administratrix of Joseph Guess.\n\nA land-record entry for Joseph Gist in 1760 [twenty years after the death of Anne’s husband] shows him giving up his lease-hold rights to a lease for 30 pounds on Dogue Run. The land was owned by Sampson Darrrel. George Washington bought the land and the lease. This Joseph is probably a son of the earlier man. Other patents and deeds mention Simpson family lands near the lands of the Darrell family.\n\nJohn Simpson-2, the oldest son, born about 1680, died about 1756 [see above]. Some published research states that John-2, son of JOHN SIMPSON-1, was the person who re-patented the 627 acre grant, but the wording of the grant makes clear that the same person who originally patented it was re-patenting it, because of a title problem. Because of that supposition, earlier researchers assumed that JOHN-1 must have died prior to 1694/5, which is not the case.\n\nCatherine Halley deposed in Fairfax County “that she well remembers that John Simpson [ junior] did intermarry with this deponents mother and that she lived with him for many years, during which time she frequently heard the said John Simpson say that he had two brothers, one by the name of Thomas, the other George, and that they both were dead andRICHARD SIMPSON was the youngest brother and the only one then living.”\n\nCatherine Halley was nee Catherine Jefferies, the daughter of Thomas Jeffries and his wife, Silent Bryant. After Thomas Jeffries’s death, his widow, Silent, married John Simpson, Jr.-2., who was the son of JOHN SIMPSON-1, “the Scotsman.”\n\nThomas Simpson-2, was born about 1682. He died in what was then Prince William County and recorded a will October 13, 1734. It stated he was a carpenter and named his children, William Simpson-3, Baxter Simpson-3, [born after 1713]Thomas Simpson, Jr.-3 [born after 1713],Mary Simpson-3, who married a Woodward, Ann Simpson-3, and his wife, Jane, who was listed in his will as “mother-in-law” to his daughter Mary. [Step-mother] He mentioned that Baxter-3 and Thomas-3 were not of age, and that Ann-3 was daughter of his widow, Jane. He left a total of about 800 acres of land and several slaves to his wife and children, as well as livestock, and household goods. Apparently, the family had prospered in the colony. His son, Baxter-3, would later move to what would become Fairfax County, near other Simpson families, he was listed there on the 1787 tax list. [Prince William Co., VA Will Book C, pg. 269 & 16 -18.] [Dorman, pg. 2 and pg. 63.]\n\nGeorge Simpson-2, was born about 1684 and died before 1756. His wife’s name was Margaret. He was mentioned in Catherine Halley’s deposition.\n\nRICHARD SIMPSON-2, the youngest son, according to Catherine’s deposition, was born about 1692, about six years before his father died in Stafford County, Virginia. He would become the ancestor of the author. He married SARAH “Barker,” a widow.\n\nThere may have been an infant, Elizabeth-2, born to JOHN-1 and MARY, who died as a young child. A tombstone has been found in the vicinity with the inscription “Here lies ye body of Elizabeth Simson, dtr. of John Simpson. Departed this life March ye 14, 1698, borne July the 27, 1695.” Whether this was our JOHN and MARY’s daughter is unknown.\n\nJane Simpson-2, born before 1680, probably one of the older children of JOHN-1. There are records, only recently found, indicating that there were two other daughters, heretofore unknown to Simpson researchers. Mary Greg cites Stafford County, Virginia, Deed & Will Book Abstracts 1809-1810 by Ruth & Sam Sparacio, which also contains a few abstracts from 1680 and Stafford County Wills & Deeds 1785-1787. In the Stafford County Court Orders for 1680, page 24 [45] in a deed from Jno Simpson of Aquina in Stafford County gives to his “daughter Jane Simpson” a heifer. Witnessed by Robert Franklin.\n\nMary Simpson-2, born before 1680, also one of the older children of JOHN-1. On this same page of the above referenced book, Thomas Maull of Aquina, in Stafford County, Virginia, “in consideration of the good will and affection which I have to and for Mary Simpson, daughter of Jno Simpson of ye county aforesaid,” gave her a heifer. Robert Franklin was also witness to this deed. None of the current researchers known to the author knows who this Thomas Maull is, and a thorough search of available records has failed to turn up any other mention of him. These references do appear to be daughters of our JOHN SIMPSON-1. At this early date in colonial history, however, the gift of a heifer was a rare and worthy gift, usually reserved for a child or grandchild, a well beloved niece or nephew, or a very close friend.\n\nThe same reference also lists the recording of the cattle ear mark for Jane Simpson daughter of JOHN SIMPSON-1, and for JOHN SIMPSON-1, himself.\n\nThese references would seem to indicate that there may have been other children that we were not heretofore aware of. Whether these two girls lived to adulthood is unknown. Since we find no more references to them, it is possible that they did not survive.\n\nJOHN SIMPSON-1 lived on Aquina Creek, in what was then Stafford County, where he patented another 100 acres in 1698, shortly before he died. That land today is located in Fairfax County, Virginia, and lies under the city of Alexandria. There was a lawsuit in Stafford County, December 12, 1698, against the estate of “John Simpson, Deceased.”\n\nAccording to Beginning at a White Oak Tree, a compiled listing of the patents and Northern Neck Grants of Fairfax County, Virginia., the land originally patented by JOHN SIMPSON-1, and John Carr, was “next door” to some of the lands of George Brent. Those lands now lie under “downtown Alexandria,” Virginia, very close to the ocean. Later-patented lands taken up by the SIMPSONS lie more inland and are joining Halley claims, and more or less, circling the lands of a man named Parsons.\n\nEarly Virginia laws on inheritance were different from the laws of other colonies. If a man died intestate [without a will], his lands might go to the oldest son or other “heir at law” entailed. If a man owned lands, he might will some of them to anyone he chose, if he made a will, and pass them in fee simple. Entailed lands might keep a man from mortgaging or selling an estate, and could cause problems. Lands owned by someone without heirs, would escheat, or return to the Proprietors or the colony, which would then re-grant the lands.\n\nIn England, if a man’s lands were entailed, and he were convicted of treason, or any other crime against the State that would result in forfeiture of his lands to the Crown, his estate was protected. If lands were not entailed, the State could seize them if he were convicted of treason. Entails could be broken, but at great cost and trouble.\n\nWe have no records of JOHN SIMPSON-1 making a will, or of his estate. A surviving widow would receive one-third [if there were children] or one-half [if there were no children] of her husband’s lands as a “dower” estate. This consisted of a life-estate in the lands [in some cases she lost this if she remarried, in some cases not.] She might also receive a “dower” in her husband’s personal property and/or slaves in fee simple. This varied from time to time, depending upon whether or not the slave was at that particular moment considered personal property or real estate. Virginia’s lawmakers changed their minds several times about this. [Salmon, Women and the Law of Property in Early America.]\n\nIn 1691, Henry Thompson of Stafford County, relationship to JOHN SIMPSON-1 unknown, bequeathed 300 acres “lying on Powells Run to the three eldest sons now living of JOHNSIMPSON in Aquina Creek, Scotsman, to them and their heirs forever.” Why this man gave land to JOHN’s sons is unknown, but they were probably related. Another question arises from the wording of “now living”—does this mean that there were other sons deceased? For some reason, none of the boys claimed the land or divided it, and eventually, John Simpson, Jr.-2, as the last survivor of the three, transferred the lands to James Halley. Ann Simpson-2 Gist, JOHN’s daughter, and a sister to John Simpson, Jr.-2, made an affidavit that the land had been bequeathed to the three, and that John Simpson, Jr.-2, was the last survivor of the three. The Simpson and Halley families had intermarried along the way as well. The will, the affidavit, and the transaction, ties together JOHN SIMPSON-1, “THE SCOTSMAN,” “of Aquina Creek,” the Halleys, Ann Simpson-2 Gist, RICHARD SIMPSON-2 and several other loose ends. It leaves unanswered, though, why did Henry Thompson leave the boys the land? What was the relationship?\n\nIn addition to the land given to JOHN SIMPSON’s sons, Henry Thompson gave to “JOHNSIMPSON, SCOTSMAN, above said one broad cloth coat dark coloured one pair of pize breeches……I further give to JOHN SIMPSON above said one horse named Sprite Branded with the figure 4 upon the shoulder.” The gift of a horse at this early date was a princely gift. It surely denotes very close friendship between Mr. Thompson and JOHN, probably blood relationship, or possibly Henry was MARY’s father or brother.\n\nAnother small footnote along this line is the interaction of the two families in Prince William County records. [Prince William was cut from the precursor county of Stafford.] An order there in the County Order Book for 1759-62, pg. 101, mentions an order “that a dedimus issue to take the deposition of Richard Simpson de bene esse in the suit brought by James Haley against Richard Crupper.” The author is not sure about the details of this suit, but it underscores the connections between the families. [Dedimus--a writ empowering a private person to do some act in place of a judge. Brown, Lesley. The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. I, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995. pg. 613.]\n\nIn 1724, there were about 650 families and about 100 communicants in the parish. One church, called Potomac, located nine miles south of the present Aquina Church, stood until torn down by the Federal Army during the Civil War. The Reverend Dr. Scott was rector as early as 1710, and stayed until he died in 1738. The Old Potomac Church records no longer exist. The earliest records known are the ones of Aquina Church beginning in 1757. It stood upon a high eminence, not very far from the main road from Alexandria to Fredericksburg. In 1838, it was deserted. Aquina Church was repaired after the Civil War.\n\nRichard Simpson, Sr.-2\n\nJohn Simpson-1; Richard-2; George-3\n\nJOHN ‘The Scotsman” SIMPSON’s youngest son, RICHARD SIMPSON-2, the first generation of our SIMPSON family born in the colonies, was probably only a few years old when his father died about 1698. He may have been born as late as 1691, but probably not before his brothers were bequeathed the 300 acres of land. His mother, MARY, was probably still alive until at least the time his father died. RICHARD-2 was reasonably well provided for and, apparently, received a fair start in life. The family was reasonably prosperous, but did not provide an education for the children. He was illiterate, and signed with a mark. This did not preclude him from voting, however, since he was a freeholder.\n\nOne researcher states RICHARD-2 may have had an early marriage which produced no children. It appears, however, that this contention is an error and confuses another Richard, one in Maryland, with our RICHARD-2. We do know that he eventually married a young widow named SARAH Barker. She was born a few years before 1700. The name “Barker” was her previous husband’s surname, and we do not know her maiden name.\n\nAbout 1724, they moved to the site that would become Fairfax County, Virginia, not far from where his father had lived. One of their sons,GEORGE-3, would become our ancestor. He was born possibly as late as 1724 to 1726. While we don’t have a definite and exact date of birth for GEORGE-3, we do have for his sister, Elizabeth-3, who was born in 1717.\n\nThe earliest purchase of lands by RICHARD-2 is for 100 acres bought from “John Parsons, tailor,” for 3,500 pounds of tobacco in “upper fork of South run Pohick bounded by the said run on each side, all that tract or parcell of land commonly called and known by the name of Chestnut Fork.” [Stafford Deeds 1722-28, pg. 199.] RICHARD-2 patented 300 acres, in what would later be designated as Fairfax, April 15, 1727 [Northern Neck Grants B:80 LS]. It was located on Wolf Run, Popeshead, adjacent John Waugh. On April 18, 1745, he deeded this land to Richard, Jr.-3, [Fairfax deeds A:355] who eventually sold it to Edward Emms for 20,000 pounds of inspected tobacco [Fairfax Deeds C:786] Mary, wife of Richard, Jr.-3, relinquished her dower. Very shortly after this date, Richard, Jr.-3, and his wife, Mary, moved to Caswell County, North Carolina.\n\nInterestingly enough, John Waugh’s land was also adjacent to the lands of HENRYWISHEART, whose daughter, CHARLOTTE, would marry AARON SIMPSON after the Revolution.\n\nStafford County deeds also indicate that Anthony Lynch was an adjoining neighbor to the Chestnut Fork plantation. His son, John Lynch, sold these lands to Hugh West about 1741.\n\nA neighbor, Robert Carter, called “King Carter, ” was a man of tremendous and shrewd business habits. He left over 300,000 acres of land when he died at age 69. He received grants for 26,000 acres in Fairfax County. He had some of the deeds listed in his son’s name [when the son was three years old!]. One of the deeds for a small piece of his holdings was for land bought in 1729. The tract was for 875 acres “Popeshead and Pohick adjacent Terence Byley.,” The deed also mentions Paynes Road and RICHARDSIMPSON-2’s lands.\n\nOn March 8, 1730/1 [OS/NS] land on “Poh ick branches adjacent Simpson, north of land on which he now lives,” 188 acres. He also bought 202 acres from Samuel Talbot April 17, 1759, “south run of Pohick adjacent John Parson” [Fairfax Deeds D:557] for 80 pounds money.\n\nFairfax County per se wasn’t actually established until 1742. Colonial Virginia statutes specified that each county would build a courthouse, one common gaol [jail], well secured, with iron bars, one pillory, whipping post, stocks, and a ducking stool. It also required 10 acres for exercise of the prisoners with good behavior. People placed in “gaol” for debts might have their wives and families come visit them, and bring food and clothing. They might walk about the 10 acres surrounding the jail. Long sentences in jail were not the usual punishment for crimes at that time. Prisoners might be kept in jail awaiting trial, or for debt. Usually a sentence for punishment would be whipping, branding, fines, extension of indenture, cutting-off-of-ears or hands. Crimes for which a free white man might be hanged were not usually handled at the local level. [Fairfax County, VA, a History.]\n\nThe county court was a major part of the colonial social life. It was the center of the Colonial government. English law and the order-of-things had been generally accepted in Colonial Virginia and government was arranged very much as it was in England’s counties. The courts also took care of many non-judicial aspects of colonial life.\n\nThe Established Church and its vestry also controlled things covered by county and state governments today, such as the care of the poor. Poor people were boarded in people’s homes and the vestry paid the people for boarding them. “Idiotic” children or adults might live with their families who would be paid by the vestry for keeping them.\n\nThe highest hierarchy of officers of the county court were the justices, later called magistrates or commissioners. The full title was Justice of the Peace. Today, in most places, this is almost an honorary title, with little authority outside of performing marriages.\n\nThe “Gentlemen Justices” were usually appointed for life and were generally of the aristocratic class. There was no compensation attached to the job, but Justices could be fined for not performing the duties associated with it. The appointments were almost hereditary, since, if a man died or was no longer able to function, usually one of his sons or relatives was appointed to fill his position. The Justices had a tremendous amount of power in the community, though they were not totally independent of supervision from above. Above them was the Assembly, Council, and Royal Governor. They usually had little or no training in the law, and settled cases more or less based on “instinct” for what was right and fair. Because things were done in open court, the people usually felt they could get a fair hearing. [Fairfax County, VA, a History.]\n\nAny disruption or expression of disorder in the courtroom, or of disrespect for the court itself, was instantly punished, and sometimes, with great severity. The court routinely demanded and received deference. The court did not represent the people, but the court was a representative of the oligarchies who, in reality, ran Virginia, but it was what the people expected and was “the way things were at home.” [In England.] Stocks, whipping posts, and branding irons were still common-enough punishments for violating the community moral standards. Punishments were also different for different classes of people for violating the same law. At this time in history, people accepted the fact there was a caste system in society. All men were not created equal before the law, in either position or wealth, and no one expected that they should be. While improving one’s financial status could surely raise one in the eyes of the colonial community, the caste of birth was still more or less fixed.\n\nThe county jail, generally held people for petty offenses or debt. If a prisoner were incarcerated for debt or other petty crimes, it was usually up to his family to provide him with food and fuel for warmth. If a man really had no assets and was imprisoned for debt, this did not go on forever. When it was established that a man had no assets to squeeze out of him by imprisoning him, then he would be released. It was a sort of “bankruptcy court.” The purpose of imprisonment for debt was to encourage a person not to make debts he could not pay, and to keep deadbeats from refusing to pay if they could.\n\nJails at this time were usually more like stoutly-built barns, made of logs, than like houses. They might be one or two rooms, and would have provisions for locks. Many times the building of stout jails was neglected by the courts, and instances of the sheriff complaining to the courts about the poor quality of the buildings are found in court records.\n\nSentences for crimes or misdemeanors were usually fines. If the fines could not be paid, the prisoner might be whipped. Sometimes people were branded. One sentence that appears very harsh to us today was commonly given for theft and other such crimes. A man might be sentenced to have his ear, or ears, nailed to the pillory and would be given a set period of time to stand there with the nails through his ears. If the sentence were “light” he might have the nail pulled out, but if it was a “harsh” sentence, he would have the ear cut from his head to release him from the nail. Capitol crimes were usually not handled on a local level. If a person sentenced to be branded was of a higher class, they might be sentenced to be “branded” with a cold iron, where a poor man would have the iron heated red-hot. A man could also plead “benefit of clergy” if he could read [again, a class distinction] and might even get out of a “hanging offense” if he could quote the “neck verse” from the Bible. In England, the petty criminals soon caught on to this, and though they could not read or write, would memorize the necessary verses and when called upon, would “read” them from the Bible. Justice was not blind or equal, and few people expected that it should be.\n\nSentences for slaves or indentured servants were even harsher than for the lower classes of free whites. A slave who killed or severely wounded his master could expect to be burned to death, or hanged. A slave who killed or severely wounded another slave could expect anything from a severe flogging to hanging. If a slave was convicted of a capitol crime and sentenced to death, the county would reimburse the owner for the loss of his property. Usually, the testimony of a slave in court, even where the slave was the only witness, was only acceptable if the case involved another slave. By the 1800s, this would somewhat change in some parts of the South, but never entirely until after the Civil War.\n\nThe colony extended more opportunity than the motherland in rising above the station of birth, but few people actually expected to do so at this time in the history of the colony. Until the slave economy became prevalent, land was cheap and labor was dear, so that early in the history, there was more opportunity to rise economically. An indentured servant could sell his labor for enough to establish himself as a freeholder in very early Virginia. With the rise of slavery, in the mid-eighteenth century, competing against slave labor made this more difficult for the lower classes. Land prices had risen and the choicest lands were grabbed up by others. By the 1750s, the proliferation of slaves in the colony had decreased the value of the free-man’s labor to such a low standard that the free man had difficulty making a living, much less rising in prosperity or station. Those with social position or wealth to build upon, however, could rise dramatically in financial position. George Washington is a classic example of a man with a little social position and not much financial position, who rose in wealth and station by taking advantage of the times. He married the richest widow in Virginia and amassed huge tracts of land for his military and surveying exploits.\n\nDuring the 1750s, in the Fairfax courts there were 188 cases of assault and battery, and 100 cases of women brought before the court for having bastard children. In some cases, the fathers of the bastard children were specified, and in others not. The women were fined up to 500 pounds of tobacco, had their indentures increased [usually by one year] and/or were given 25 to 50 lashes “well laid on” their bare backs. The whippings were not the punishment for the crime, but were because the “criminal” could not pay the fine. Five-hundred pounds of tobacco was a hefty fine and probably impossible for most women to pay. It would have been enough for a person to live on for one year. Premarital sex was not so much frowned on for moral reasons, but the court had an interest in not producing children which would be on the county dole. Women in more-affluent circumstances, who had families to provide for them and any illegitimate offspring, or who could pressure the man into marrying her, did not wind up at the whipping post. This was a post-Elizabethan and pre-Victorian era, and the people’s standards of morality were more or less “realistic,” rather than “moralistic.” Station in the community and/or financial status had great bearing in any sentences passed by the courts.\n\nVirginia was ruled by a colonial gentry descended primarily from the “second sons” from England recruited by the Governor. There were many others who were prosperous planters, but were not among this “elite.” The SIMPSONS had probably risen to be among the prosperous planters who were not among the “elite.” They did vote as freeholders in the infrequent elections held for the Burgesses. Elections were held in 1742, 1752, 1755, 1758, and in 1771.\n\nOn court days or polling [voting] days, the people who could get away from home gathered at the courthouse. Outside the courthouse the county standard flew proudly from its flag staff, and the royal arms of England were emblazoned above the door. Court day was usually once a month. Farmers came with their produce to sell and the streets around the courthouse were thronged with all sorts of people, both on foot and on horseback. Cake sellers had tables in front of the courthouse and people running for any kind of office were almost required to buy cake and drinks for their supporters, although the law strictly forbade “buying drinks and votes.” Kind of reminds you of the way things are today, doesn’t it?\n\nPeople attending elections were generally in a jolly mood. Each man would go up when his name was called and sign his name or make his mark underneath the list or “poll” of his candidate. The candidates were usually standing there thanking their supporters. If a candidate couldn’t be present himself, he would get one of his close friends to represent him and personally thank his supporters. There was no secret ballot. Sometimes elections became very heated. Local politics were taken very seriously by the community. [Fairfax County, Virginia---1649-1800.]\n\nIn one election in 1755, George Washington, later our President, argued with another man over the election and struck the other man with a stick and knocked him to the ground in the courthouse square. Later, Washington apologized to the man and avoided trouble which might have led to a duel. Since he voted in this election, we may wonder if our GEORGE SIMPSON saw this fight. [Americans]\n\nIn 1742, arrangements for the building of the new courthouse for the new county of Fairfax were made at “a place called Spring Fields... between the New Church and Ox road in the branches of Difficult Run, Hunting Creek and Accotinck.” This was probably a log building with rock or brick chimneys. No description exists today.\n\nIn his History of Truro Parish, Slaughter states,\n\nOrders for Processioning: James Halley, Sen., and Moses Simpson between Occoquan, the Ox road and the county line. George Simpson and William Keen between the Ox road and the Blacklick road from the parish line down to the road that leads from Cameron by the Glebe to where it crosses the Pohic, below Robert Boggess’\n\n“Processioning” was the colonial way of marking boundaries between adjoining land owners. The church vestry was responsible for this task within the parish. It was supposed to be done every four years, but the vestry was not always timely with processionings. When a time was set, however, each land owner had to be there or send a representative to literally march or procession around the lands. Trees were blazed or other landmarks noted and agreed upon. The lists that survive of these boundary markings give us a good idea of who lived near our ancestors and where their lands were located. Rivers and creeks were frequently noted in deeds or processionings.\n\nThe population of Fairfax County in 1749 was 1,947 tithables. The total population of an area was usually calculated at three times the tithable number. Fairfax encompassed both Truro Parish and Cameron Parish. Each parish had more than one church building. For some reason, though, Truro Parish required a much higher budget than Cameron. Truro had three churches, Pohick, Falls, and Rocky Run. There was a vestry house which was a fourth building to support. [Fairfax County, VA, a History]\n\nEach tithable was assessed so many pounds of tobacco per tithable, per year. The church vestry decided what expenses would be, counted the tithables in the parish, and divided the one into the other, and came up with the per-head tax. A white male was a tithable when he reached age 16, slaves were counted at a set age regardless of sex. Widows were not counted, and white female servants were not counted, unless they were worked in the fields. An old or disabled man could be exempted from the head tax, as was a minister. The idea behind the tax of “tithables” was that a productive member of the labor force would be taxed. Non-productive members would not be taxed.\n\nRICHARD-2 and GEORGE SIMPSON-3’s names are on the Fairfax voting lists for the 1744 election for the representatives for the House of Burgesses. George Washington, the future President of the United States, also worshipped at Truro Parish and voted there. George Washington was a vestryman and a member of the House of Burgesses as well. The other Simpson men that voted in that election were Robert Simpson, Baxter Simpson, Gilbert Simpson, and William Simpson They were classed with the planter class, well above the yeoman class of farmers, but not of the aristocracy. By this time, Virginia required ownership of either 25 acres of improved lands or 100 acres of raw lands in order to vote. [Fairfax County, VA, a History]\n\nGEORGE-3 had patented 256 acres on “South Run of Pohick adjacent own land” November 14, 1741. In May, 1761, GEORGE-3 bought 182 acres on “southwest side South Run Pohick” from Catesby Cocke [Fairfax Deeds D:875.]\n\nIn 1752, the Fairfax Courthouse was moved to Alexandria, which was showing signs of becoming a major seaport. The county court remained there until about 1798 when it was moved to Providence. Fairfax, as a whole, experienced great growth during the 1750s. The population was about 5,500 in 1750, but rose to 7,600 by 1756, which was a 40% growth in six years. Loudoun County was split off from Fairfax lands due to the distance the citizens in the west had to travel to the county seat, and due to the increase in population in the area. [Fairfax County, VA, a History]\n\nThe children of Richard-2 and Sarah __?__Simpson\n\nJohn “The Scotsman” Simpson-1; Richard-2; George-3\n\nGEORGE SIMPSON-3, perhaps the oldest son, born about 1724, married SUSANNAH WHEELER. He died before November 18, 1782, in Fairfax County.\n\nCaptain Richard, Simpson, Jr.-3, was born about 1723 and married Mary Kincheloe. They moved to North Carolina in the 1750s. He died about 1786 in Caswell County, North Carolina. His only son, Richard Simpson-4, encouraged the migration of their Simpson cousins to North Carolina in the late 1700s and early 1800s.\n\nElizabeth Simpson-3, who may be the oldest child, was born 1717, she died July 22, 1785. She married James Halley, who may be the same man who received the 300 acres of land that Ann [Simpson-2] Gist’s affidavit referred to. They moved to Caswell County, North Carolina, as well.\n\nSary or Sarah Simpson-3, born about 1734 in Fairfax area, married John Thomas Windsor. There has been much published research on the descendants of this family, and the ancestors of the Windsor line who supposedly came from the family for whom Windsor Castle was named. This volume will not attempt to reproduce this research. However, those interested in this information may find it in almost any large genealogical library.\n\nMary Simpson-3, born about 1738, married Samuel Canterbury as her first husband, and Eli Cleveland as her second.\n\nMoses Simpson-3, is sometimes confused with the Moses-4, son of William-3, son of Thomas Simpson-2. Moses-4 was born April 20, 1748. Moses-3, the son of RICHARD-2, died in Fairfax in 1787 and left his property, known as the Calico Tract, [Fairfax Wills E:184] to his nephews, George-4 and Joseph Simpson-4. In the 1782 census, he was shown as owning 37 slaves and as the only white person in the household. Also, he had 15 buildings of one sort or another on his property.\n\nWe don’t know if he married or had children, but apparently not. There were several men named Moses Simpson, so the records are somewhat confused. The author has not made any major attempt to straighten these lines out. His will, in Fairfax, Virginia, dated January 7, 1787, lists his nephews.\n\nThe life of the people in Virginia was governed by the seasons of planting and the rhythms of nature. Planting season for tobacco started shortly after Christmas, as early as the weather would allow. Seedbeds were prepared and the seedlings slowly sprouted. After five months, the plants were transplanted into the fields. Transplanting seedlings is what is referred to as “stoop labor” since it must be done stooping over, or on hands and knees. Once in the fields, the seedlings had to be kept weed-free by hoeing and cultivating until they were large. They required constant care and observation, so that the huge ugly tobacco worms did not devour them. The worms had to be hand-picked off the plants. These same green-horned worms infest many gardens today and devour the tomatoes. Then the harvest time came, which was another labor-intensive process. The tobacco cycle exercised a complete control over the lives of the Virginians.\n\nWhite women were almost never worked in the fields during this period, even indentured servants. The women, though seldom worked in the fields, did not lead a life of leisure. Even “housekeeping” required so much manual labor that the women toiled even if they didn’t work in the fields. There was still the kitchen garden to tend, and clothing to produce, cows to milk, meat to slaughter and process.\n\nThe plantations grew the fibers for spinning and weaving into clothing for the family and for the slaves and servants. Flax plants were grown for linen and sheep were grown for wool, and later, cotton was grown. These were processed, spun into thread, and woven in the home for the family’s and the servants’ needs. If the family was wealthy, they might have materials for dress-up clothing imported from England. Even wealthy people in the colonies, though, did not have many changes of clothing as we do today. Clothing was an item of high value passed on in wills. Shoes and boots were made for the individual, but they were not made for left and right feet, but were more generic. Many people did not have shoes at all, but would use a rough form of moccasin. Good shoes were usually kept for ceremonial occasions. A pair of shoes cost more than a day’s labor for a common man.\n\nFlax and wool were the principle fibers used for clothing before the Revolution. Cotton required too much hand labor to separate the lint from the seeds before the invention of the cotton gin in 1793. Though they were also labor intensive, flax and wool required less hand labor and the fibers were easier to prepare for spinning and weaving.\n\nIn addition to crop-calendar activities, the Christian calendar held influence in the community. Debts were settled and rents due on Lady Day [March 25], mid-summer’s day [June 24], Michaelmas [September 29], and Christmas Day. Many saints’ days, and other religious holidays were also celebrated. New Year’s Day was the day for gift giving in early Virginia, rather than Christmas as we do today. [Fischer, Albion’s Seed, pg. 370.]\n\nRICHARD-2 and SARAH SIMPSON participated in this plantation and community life and lived to see their children grown and with families and plantations of their own. Several of the children settled around RICHARD and SARAH’s plantation, but others moved away to find new lands.\n\nRichard Simpson, Jr.-3, called “Captain” Simpson, had received land grants and moved to Orange/Caswell County, North Carolina, about 1751, but the family continued to visit and maintain close ties. Captain Richard-3 Simpson’s son, Colonel Richard-4, [John “The Scotsman Simpson-1; Richard-2, Captain Richard-3; Colonel Richard-4] sold land to GEORGE-3’s sons and convinced many of them to move to North Carolina. Colonel Richard Simpson-4 eventually moved to Kentucky where he died. Their titles were probably related to militia service, but at this point we have no proof of that supposition.\n\nThe will of RICHARD SIMPSON-2 [Fairfax Will Book B, pg. 347] was dated September 19, 1761, and probated December 21, 1762, in Fairfax. RICHARD-2 was about 70 years old when he died. In the will, RICHARD-2 gave GEORGE-3 the land on which he lived, being part of two tracts, and he gave Moses-3 204 acres of land lying on the south run of Pohick that was purchased of Sam Tollburd. RICHARD-2’s son. Moses-3, later left this same land to GEORGE-3’s son, Richard-4. RICHARD-2 left the use of 12 slaves to his wife, “SARY” and gave two slaves outright to GEORGE-3, two each to Richard-3, Moses-3, Elizabeth-3, daughter Sary-3, and to Mary Canterbury, “in default of heirs to Elizabeth Halley and Sary Windser.” Grand-daughter Karen Happuch-4 [this was a given name, from the Bible] and Grandson George Windsor-4 received one Negro each.\n\nRICHARD SIMPSON-2 owned about 25 slaves. Owning this large number of slaves meant he was quite affluent, though far below the huge wealth and number of slaves owned by the aristocrats, like George Washington, who owned nearly 200 slaves. Only about seven-percent of the people living in Virginia owned any slaves at all during this time-period. Most of those who did own slaves, owned only one or two. Very few slave owners owned six or more. If you use the number of slaves owned as a gauge of wealth, the number of slaves which RICHARD owned placed him in the top one-or two-percent of the wealthiest men in the colony at that time.\n\nSARAH “Barker”SIMPSON also wrote a will, and it was probated in 1766 in Fairfax. SARAH had one son from her previous marriage, William Barker. Her will gave her son, Moses Simpson-3, a gold ring, and if he died without heirs, that ring was to go to Sarah Simpson-4, daughter of GEORGE-3. SARAH also left to granddaughter, Sarah Halley-4, the wife of William Wilkinson, a gold ring with the first two letters of her name engraved in it. Sarah Windsor and Sarah Simpson-4, the daughter of Richard Simpson, Jr.-3, each received a ring. She directed that her wearing apparel be equally divided between three granddaughters, with Elizabeth Halley getting first pick. She left GEORGE-3, Moses-3, and Richard-3 one shilling sterling each. To William Barker, “My well beloved son ... all and every part of my estate except those legacies above mentioned.” William Barker was the executor. The will was signed May, 1764. For whatever reason, RICHARDSIMPSON-2 had failed to mention his step-son, William Barker, in his will at all. SARAH apparently made up to some extent for this slight or oversight of her firstborn. [Fairfax Will Book B, page 418.]\n\nWhat exactly it was that SARAH owned in fee simple which she could will to her son, William Barker, is unknown. She would have had a dower in her husband’s real property, [a life estate in one-third of it] but she couldn’t have willed that portion of the estate as it reverted to her husband’s heirs upon her death. If she had inherited lands, slaves, or other goods from her own family, she might have owned that property in fee simple, and thus have been able to will it to whom she pleased. She may also have received part of the personal estate of either her former husband or of RICHARD in fee simple and willed that. Virginia was one state in which the widow [at certain times] received part of the personal estate of her husband in fee simple as part of her dower.\n\nObviously, the family had prospered to the point they were relatively wealthy by the standards of the day. The bequests of the gold-initial mourning rings was common with the upper classes in that era. The bequest of clothing was also common practice and frequently mentioned in wills. Sometimes the articles were even described in detail. The colonial period of Virginia from 1650 to 1800 was a time of increasing prosperity for the families of the colonists.\n\nFew girls today would be “thrilled” by inheriting the clothing of their grandmother. In Colonial America, however, clothing or cloth ordered from England was quite dear and not to be cast off lightly just because the owner died, or the item was slightly worn. Bathing and changing clothing every day, as most people in this country do today, was not practiced in the eighteenth century. Among some groups of people the only real baths they might get would be at birth and at death. That didn’t mean that they never washed at all, just that a “tub bath,” or all- over-bath, was not the common practice.\n\nGeorge Simpson-3 and Susannah Wheeler\n\nJohn Simpson-1; Richard-2; George-3\n\nIn the 1760s, Truro Parish was divided and the “top” half became Fairfax Parish. George Washington’s land at first fell into the new parish, but a new division was made and his land was again in Truro Parish where he was elected vestryman. Falls Church was completed in 1769 and Pohick Church started. Pohick Church was the most important of the churches in the parish and was attended by the important families. The building of this fine and beautiful building increased the levy for the parish to upwards of 70 pounds of tobacco per poll.\n\nRICHARD-2 and SARAH SIMPSON’s son, GEORGE-3, married SUSANNAH WHEELER-3 and continued to live in Truro Parish, Fairfax County, Virginia, the rest of his life. GEORGE-3 was a planter and owned slaves, horses, and cattle, as well as a mill. He and SUSANNAH raised a large family of children. GEORGE-3 and SUSANNAH had been married about 20 years when his parents died, so the oldest of GEORGE-3’s children were probably well acquainted with their grandparents. GEORGE-3 inherited his father’s home plantation, but very likely, RICHARD-2 helped GEORGE-3 get established as a planter when he married. The date of the marriage of GEORGE-3 and SUSANNAH is unknown, but definitely before 1742, deduced from the birth date of their son [Richard-4] which is confirmed. A date earlier than Richard-4’s birth date for Jemima-4’s birth is probably in error. Richard Simpson-4 was probably the oldest son.\n\nIn the plantation society of eighteenth-century Virginia, it was necessary to acquire new lands continually in order to plant crops which wore out the soil, and to provide farms and plantations for the family’s children as they married and left home. In affluent families, or even in poor ones, the children were provided for to the best of the family’s ability at the time they married or left home. By the time the entire family of children had left home and established their independent families, most of the estate had already been divided unless the family was very wealthy. At least in our families, most of the time the estate seems to have been pretty evenly divided among the children. Step-children were sometimes included for bequests and sometimes left out entirely by the step-parent’s will or estate. The SIMPSONS and Wheelers seemed to leave out the step-children.\n\nWe have found only a few legal wrangles over estates in which there seemed to be major problems with one or more heirs being dissatisfied to the point that there was a law suit.\n\nMost of the plantation class tended to marry within their own group or class. In Virginia, marriage was seen as a joining of estates, and though marriages were not forcibly arranged, people tended to marry within their group, even within their kinship group, and to co-join estates. Prenuptial love was not considered necessary for a successful marriage and there was not a “romantic” idea of marriage. Marriages were informally arranged between families, and the wishes of the young people were frequently taken into account, but “suitable” marriages were strongly encouraged by families.\n\nCaptain Richard Simpson-3\n\nGEORGE SIMPSON-3’s brother, Captain Richard Simpson-3, moved to Orange/Caswell County, North Carolina, about 1751, where he had received a large land grant. There was continued communication between the Fairfax family and the North Carolina branch but it was almost forty years before some of the Fairfax branch started to go to North Carolina and buy lands from Captain Richard-3’s son, Colonel Richard-4. Captain Richard-3 died about 1780, but his son, Colonel Richard-4, began selling tracts to his cousins from Fairfax.\n\nChildren of Captain Richard Simpson-3 and Mary Kinchloe\n\nSusannah Simpson-4, probably born in North Carolina, married David Burton before 1783. She was probably deceased by the time her mother wrote her will in 1797. Mary left legacies to “the children of David Burton by his first wife, namely Zera Burton, Chinai Burton, Polly Burton, John Burton, and David Burton, Jr.”\n\nKesiah Simpson-4, was married to and widowed by a man named Buchanan before 1783, but was married to John Reed by the time of her mother’s will in 1797.\n\nMargaret Simpson-4, married Jeremiah Williamson and inherited land on Horsley Creek. In 1791, Jeremiah, “late of Caswell County,” gave a power of attorney to “friend John Reed to bring suit and collect my part of the estate of Richard Simpson, Dec’d of Fairfax County, VA.” [Caswell County Book B., pg. 401.]\n\nColonel Richard Simpson-4, the only son, born before 1766, probably in North Carolina, married Henrietta Williams, daughter of John Williams and his wife, Betsey. He was a minor in his father’s will in 1786. John Reid was his guardian. In 1800, he was a NC State Representative and, in 1802, a trustee of the Caswell Academy. He was also Justice of Peace and Treasurer of Public Buildings. His children were Betsy Williams Simpson-5, and John Kincheloe Simpson-5. They were named in their grandfather John Williams’ will in 1805.\n\nElizabeth Simpson-4, wife of Jesse Oldham before 1783, may have had William Poston as her second husband. William Poston gave a Power of Attorney to John Windsor, Jr., to settle with Colonel Richard Simpson-4 for his portion of the estate “as a legatee of Mary Kincheloe Simpson.” [Court Minutes, pg. 106, January, 1807.]\n\nSarah Simpson-4, born February 24, 1744, married Nathaniel Hart.\n\nMary Ann Simpson-4, married Tyree Harris, Sr., before 1783. He was the infamous sheriff of Caswell County. .Buyers at the estate sale of Tyree in July, 1790, were Ede Harris, Lydia Harris, Robert Harris, and Simpson Harris. Tyree Harris was reportedly one of the corrupt county officials that sparked the Regulator uprising in North Carolina.\n\nLydia Simpson-4, wife of Zacheus Tate. His will listed in 1798 Lydia Tate, John Tate, Jean Eudoxie Tate, Zaccheus Tate, Valentine Tate, Uriah Tate, Zephaniah Tate, Uzziah Tate, Zeus Tate, and Sampson Tate as heirs. [What a group of names!]\n\nEde Simpson-4 married William Nunn.\n\nNancy Simpson-4 married Waddy Tate before her father’s will in 1787, but he was dead by the time of her mother’s will in 1797. “Three youngest children” of Waddy Tate were Edy Tate, Zedekiah Tate, and Jesse Tate.\n\n[From wills, His: Caswell County Will Book B, pg. 103, 1783. Hers, November 1797 Book C, pg. 331]\n\nIn January, 1786, Mary Kincheloe Simpson appeared in court with her attorney, Jesse Burton, and “signifies her dissatisfaction to the provisions made for her in said husband’s will. She asks the court to lay off 1/3 part of manor plantation for her and also 1/3 of all lands of which her husband was seized before he executed a deed of gift to his son, Richard, on the day of his death, also her part of such personal estate as her said husband had before execution of deed of gift. Signed, Mary Simpson, January 17, 1786.” [Court Minutes.]\n\nProperty laws stipulated that a woman had an absolute right to one-third of a husband’s property [if there were children, or one-half if no children] after his death as her “dower.” Apparently her husband, on the day of his death, made a “deed of gift” to his son, Richard-4, and did not secure a “dower release” from Mary. She chose to exercise her rights of dower and receive her one-third. Also, any debts that the estate owed could not be paid out of the lands or “dower” of the widow until after she died. [Court Minutes, pg. 13.] In October of 1786, her dower was “laid off.”\n\nChildren of George Simpson-3 and Susannah Wheeler Simpson\n\nJemima Simpson-4, was reportedly born March 17, 1742/3 [OS/NS]. Note the birth date of her brother, Richard-4, which is confirmed. Apparently this erroneous birth date for Jemima came from a parish listing of the birth of Jemima “Simmons,” which was assumed to be a misspelling of “Simpson.” Regardless of the birth date, she married Peter Smith. She and Peter also moved to North Carolina. [Overwarton Parish Register]\n\nRichard Simpson-4, born September 23, 1743, married Ann Lucas, the daughter of Thomas and Elinor Lucas. This birth date is solidly confirmed. He was apparently one of the overseers of the poor for the parish in Fairfax, Virginia, that met at Prices’ ordinary in September of 1790 and presented bills amounting to 258 pounds, 14 shillings, 11 d, for the relief of about 36 poor persons in the county. This averaged out to about seven pounds for each person assisted. With post-Revolutionary inflation, this was probably not very much. In 1803, when the British were attempting to collect bills due from Colonial planters who owed them money when the Revolutionary War broke out, Richard was listed in the “British Mercantile Debts” list as owing three pounds, six shillings and five pence, due from 1775. He was listed as “willing and able to pay.” Thomas Lucas, his father-in-law, was listed as deceased and insolvent, and Richard was noted as his executor. What is presumably Richard’s listing on the 1800 Fairfax County tax list shows that he had one tithable white male in the household, eight horses, and seven slaves over 16 years of age.\n\nWilliam Simpson-4, born September 23, 1757, married Jane/Jean/Jenny Wisheart, sister of CHARLOTTE, and daughter of HENRY WISHEART. Erick Montgomery thinks this William remained in Fairfax, but that his children went to North Carolina. He died about 1820. However, there are deeds from Richard Simpson-4 of Caswell County, North Carolina, to “William Simpson of Fairfax” for 36 acres on Stony Creek. [Caswell County Deeds.] Information from Kurt Tostenson about this family received in an e-mail dated September 15, 1997, said that he had been to Wood County, West Virginia, gathering data and encountered information about William Simpson-4. Kurt named the children of William Simpson-4 and Jean Wisheart-2 as:\n\n1. Edward Washington Simpson-5, born June 3, 1777.\n\n2. Nancy Simpson-5, born June 25, 1779, married Thomas Coffer.\n\n3. Susan Simpson-5, born May 31, 1781, married Thomas Garrett.\n\n4. George Simpson-5, born July 10, 1783.\n\n5. William Simpson-5, born April 11, 1785, married Keron Happach Keene.\n\n6. Moses Simpson-5, born April 2, 1787, married Jane Tracey and Jane Smith.\n\n7. Thompson Simpson-5, born March 31, 1789, married Frances Fairfax Keene.\n\n8. Mason Simpson-5, born April 14, 1791.\n\n9. Silas Simpson-5, born May 23, 1793.\n\n10. Massie Simpson-5, born April 30, 1796.\n\n11. Mary Simpson-5, born March 17, 1797.\n\n12. John Simpson-5, born September 29, 1799.\n\n13. Catherine J. Simpson-5, born September, 1801.\n\nWilliam Simpson-4 died in Wood County, West Virginia, on January 1, 1815, and his daughter, Marietta Simpson, placed her father’s stone in Lewis Cemetery. She married Francis K. Lewis on July 11, 1840. [Kurt Tostenson.]\n\nAARON SIMPSON-4, born January 2, 1759, married CHARLOTTE WISHEART-2 on May 29, 1783, and was our ancestor. He moved to Orange/Caswell County, North Carolina, before the 1800 census was made.\n\nGeorge Simpson, Jr.-4, died about 1803, his wife was Mary Johnston, and he is listed on the 1800 Fairfax United States Census as having one tithable male, one horse, and no slaves.\n\nJames Simpson-4, moved to Caswell, North Carolina, where his estate is of record. He was apparently still in Fairfax on the 1800 census, and had one tithable male, two horses, and one slave over age 16. There are several men named James Simpson in Fairfax. His wife was Sarah Hornbuckle. Deed book Q, dated 1812, details the division of land to legatees: Delilah Simpson-5 and her husband, James Cooker; Nancy Simpson-5 and her husband, Green L. Brown; Richard Simpson-5; and Susannah Simpson-5, daughter, unmarried.\n\nThe will listed sons Levy Simpson-5; William Simpson-5; and James Simpson-5; and daughters, Nancy-5 Brown; Susannah Simpson-5; Delila Simpson-5; Sally Simpson-5; and Elizabeth Simpson-5; Milly Simpson-5; and Polly Simpson-5. Guardian accounts for the “orphans” Levi, William, and James Simpson, were recorded for the years 1813 and 1815.\n\nMoses Simpson-4, may have been the man who died in 1779. He married Margaret “Peggy” Wisheart, the third daughter of HENRY WISHEART to marry one of the Simpsons. He probably had one son named John Simpson-4. Since there were several men named Moses in this group, his records may be confused with theirs.\n\nJoseph Simpson-4, died about 1822. His wife’s name was Elizabeth. There were two men named Joseph Simpson listed in Fairfax in 1800. One had one tithable male, five horses, and three adult slaves, and the other one had one tithable male, six horses, and eight slaves.\n\nSarah Simpson-4, married George Robertson and was living in Fairfax in 1800.\n\nSusannah Simpson-4, married Lancelot Beck [Beckwith?]\n\nMary Ann Simpson-4, married Robert Marshall before 1790 and moved to Kentucky.\n\nApparently a daughter who married Francis Keen, who was a legatee of GEORGESIMPSON-3, mentioned in the estate settlement in 1825.\n\nGEORGE-3 and SUSANNAH WHEELER-3 SIMPSON were close neighbors of SUSANNAH’s family. Her brother, Drummond Wheeler-3, named his son “George Simpson Wheeler-4.” SUSANNAH’s family were also prosperous planters, but also probably not aristocrats.\n\nGEORGE SIMPSON-3 died in 1782. He only outlived his father about 20 years. Some of the younger children were still at home when he died. He left a will dated October 4, 1782. SUSANNAH was listed on the tax rolls for 1787 in Fairfax, so we know that she outlived him by several years. She didn’t leave a separate will. GEORGE’s estate was not finally settled until in the 1820s, and this researcher and several others think this is because SUSANNAH lived until at least 1820, almost 40 years after GEORGE’s death.\n\nHenry Wisheart-1\n\nCHARLOTTE WISHEART-2, AARON’s bride, was the daughter of HENRY WISHEART. GEORGE SIMPSON had obviously been a friend of HENRY’s, since he was one of the signers of HENRY’s will, dated 1776. All three of HENRY’s daughters would marry sons ofGEORGE SIMPSON.\n\nHENRY WISHEART moved to Fairfax from nearby Loudoun County, Virginia, shortly before his death. Fairfax County had originally been cut off from Loudoun, so this was not a large geographic move. He may have had connections or relationships in the new area prior to the move. He was buying lands there as early as 1759, from a man named Edward Muse, who may have been a kinsman of his wife’s. This gives us an approximate birth date for HENRY of “before 1738.” We also know he was in the colony by 1759 or before. Since his daughters were still minors at his death in 1776, it is likely that he wasn’t much past age 40 at the time he died, so this approximate birth date may be reasonably accurate for HENRY WISHEART.\n\nEdward Muse, son of JOHN MUSE, Jr., and his wife, ANN, lived in Westmoreland County. He had leased lands in 1734 in Westmoreland County from ROBERT SANDFORD [ Jr.] and MARY, his wife, who was a sister of Edward Muse. Edward had married Ann, daughter of Richard Sanford, Sr., and his wife, Susannah [surname unknown.] He had a grandson, Sanford Muse, who was mentioned in his will. Edward died in 1781, leaving a will, naming his children and widow.\n\nThere were other Muse-Sanford marriages, too; Thomas Muse, Jr. [b. 1712- d. 1734] married Sarah Sanford. John Muse [b. 1700- d. 1777] married Mary Sanford.\n\nWisheart [Wishart, Wiseheart, Wishard, etc.] is most likely a Scots or English name. HENRY didn’t appear to be a planter, or farmer, but was probably a merchant or money lender. He owned four slaves, but had them rented out, and received money for their labor. He was apparently a member of the established church, so was probably not a Scots-Irishman, who were usually Presbyterians. He also appointed ministers of the established church as his children’s guardians. Erick Montgomery thinks HENRY may have been the immigrant ancestor of this line, and the first of his family if not his name. Men named Wisheart [Wishard] were prominent martyrs in Scotland for the Presbyterian faith.\n\nThe tithable list for Loudoun County for 1771 [Virginia Genealogist, V17:276] lists HENRY and named four of the tithable slaves that he owned, “George, Frank, Harry, and Jude.” Slaves were not all tithable, so he may have owned more slaves than were listed as “tithable” slaves. Only the ones of an age and condition to be considered working labor were taxed. Very old or very young slaves were exempt from tax. There were no other men by the surname Wisheart in the vicinity. At the time of his death, his will mentioned that there were several slaves that were “quite small.”\n\nThe 1704 quit rent rolls of Virginia Colony list “William Wishart” who owned 200 acres, and James Wishart, who owned 225 acres, both in Princess Anne County, Virginia. Either of these men might be the father or grandfather of HENRY, whom we can estimate was born about 1735. It is also possible thatHENRY is the immigrant ancestor of this line.\n\nChecking the tax records, wills, and court minutes of Loudoun County, we find the will of Demse Carroll which HENRY witnessed. The will was undated, but was probated in 1776. Demse also rented HENRY’s slave, George, who was mentioned in HENRY’s will, so the two men were probably friends, relations or neighbors. The list of Loudoun County tithables of 1771 mentions Demse Carroll, Jr. [Virginia Genealogist, “Loudoun County Tithables, 1771,” CD] HENRYWISHEART is also mentioned on this same list, and noted as having four taxable slaves, Frank, Harry, George, and Jude. Demsey Carrol, Senior, was on Simon Triplett’s List in Cameron Parish in 1771. He listed as polls, besides himself, William Porter Carrol, and three slaves, Jenny, Joan, and Nancy.\n\nDemse Carrol whose will HENRY witnessed, mentioned his wife, Rebecca, and daughters; Frances, Rachel, Mary Ann, Cynthia, and Mary Owens [and her son Thomas Hogen], and sons-in-law, William Smith and Silvester Welch of Fauquier County. The other witnesses were William Turner, Jr., and Mary Porter. He did not mention a son, Demse. There is also no proof that Demse Carroll, Jr., was the son of Demse Carroll, Senior.\n\nThe earliest record found by this researcher for land acquisitions in the Fairfax area by HENRY WISHEART was a purchase in March, 1759, of 268 acres brought from Edward Muse for which HENRY paid 30 pounds. [Fairfax Deeds D:618.] The land lay on Johnnymore, Little Rocky Run branches of Occoquan. He obviously owned other Fairfax lands, however, because in April of 1774, he sold 460 acres that was part of a 1728 patent of Richard Britt on Johnnymore Run, adjacent John Waugh to Marmaduke Beckwith for 500 pounds. [Loudoun Deeds K:166.] This land was directly north of Waugh’s 2,800 acre holding, and somewhat north and west of the main SIMPSON stronghold. RICHARD SIMPSON had bought lands near Waugh’s in 1727.\n\nHENRY WISHEART’s will, which was recorded in Fairfax County, Virginia, about 1776, shows that he was fairly well-to-do and was well connected in the community. He mentions that he was “Late of Hurley, in Loudoun County,” so had obviously moved recently to Fairfax. He doesn’t mention his wife, ANNE NEALE, in the will, and most likely, if she were alive he would have done so, though women automatically received a dower in her husband’s property, whether or not she was mentioned in the will. Because HENRY spoke with such obvious tenderness and care of his daughters, one cannot think that such a man would have neglected to mention his wife. Theda Womack did much of the preliminary research on the Wiseheart line. Erick Montgomery also contributed greatly to this research and to the research for ANNE NEALE’s family.\n\nWill of Henry Wisheart\n\nIn the name of God, Amen. I, Henry Wishearte, late of Huntly, in the county of Loudoun of Colony of Virginia, being at this present writing in very indifferent state of health, but thanks to god, in sound and perfect tranquillity of mind do declare this to be my last will and testament, annulling and making void all other wills by me heretofore made that is to say Imp.

It is my will that if any of the above mentioned daughters of mine should die in their noneage or unmarried then her fortune to be equally divided betwict her other two sisters and I expressly stipulate that if any of the three above mentioned sisters should marry clandestinely or without the consent of one of my executors as I appoint them my guardians she so transgresses her whole fortune shall be give to and equally divided between her other two sisters.\n\nItem. Lastly I do hereby constitute and appoint Capt. John Dalton of Alexandria, merchant, Patrick Coutts, James River Merchant and his brother the Rev. William Coutts, rector of Martin Brandon’s Parish Prince George County, executor of this my last will and testament as also guardians of my afore mentioned daughters. In witness wherefore I have hereunto put my name and affixed my seal the 31 day of January in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy six.\n\nSigned and sealed in the presence of George Simpson, Benjamin _____, and William Simpson.\n\nAt the court held for the County of Fairfax 12 February 1776 this will was presented in Court by John Dalton one of the executors wherein named who made oath thereto and the same being proved by the oaths of George Simpson and William Simpson is admitted to record and the said executor having performed what the law requires a certificate is granted for him obtaining a probate thereof in due form.”\n\nWe are not sure about the connection of John Dalton and the other executors and guardians. John Dalton was receiving lands in Fairfax in the 1750s. He was a partner with Colonel John Carlyle in purchasing lands in 1770. As early as 1755, he was the executor, along with William Ramsey, for the will of John Minor. In 1788, a deed mentions lands adjacent to his, so we know he was still alive at that time.\n\nHENRY’smentioning that if his daughters married without consent of his appointed guardians that they would lose their fortunes was not an unusual stipulation. In Virginia, matrimony was regarded as an indissoluble union, and divorce in the modern-sense did not exist. Social rituals of matrimony reflected this idea of marriage, and Virginians followed the Church of England’s elaborate five-step process of espousal, publication of banns, religious ceremony, marriage feast, and sexual consummation. The Virginian clergy could not marry without the publication of Banns. Clandestine marriages could be punished by imprisonment. Among the landed families, marriage was regarded as a union of property as well as persons. Love was not considered a pre-condition of marriage, but seldom were persons forced to marry against their wills. Parents took an active role in the selection of marriage partners for their children, and it was considered that love would follow the marriage, but if it didn’t, it didn’t necessarily mean the marriage was a failure. In families where there was property, the marriage between cousins, or the children of close friends, was encouraged to “keep it all in the family.”\n\nA woman who was not married, but who was of legal age, was called according to law, a femme sole, and could conduct business for herself, such as buy or sell lands or slaves. A married woman was supposed to be under the direction of her husband, according to the property laws. Because of the right of dower, however, some colonies mandated that a woman had to sign a release of her dower in any land that her husband sold. Many colonies protected the wife by requiring that she be examined “privately” to see that she really agreed to the sale of any property, others did not. However, slaves owned by a woman before or at marriage became part of the husband’s estate, and in some cases, when he pre-deceased his wife, she might only get a dower right to one-third of her own property inherited “free and clear” from her own father before her marriage. [Solomon, Women and the Law of Property in Early America.]\n\nHENRY WISHEART’sestate of several-hundred pounds in bonds and several slaves was a considerable fortune, though not a lavish one. His wife, ANNE NEALE, had inherited a female slave and a slave child from her parents, so some of this estate may have been though her inheritance. Though HENRY and ANNE didn’t leave their daughters very wealthy, they were well-enough fixed to live comfortably for the times. HENRY did not die a poor man by any means. In colonial days where there were no banks, bonds and credit were frequently the ways in which business was conducted. Bonds were often redeemed in tobacco or other products and not cash.\n\nThere was no official currency or coin. Gold and silver coins from different countries were used. Tobacco notes were the only “standard” currency. Tobacco was inspected in government warehouses and required to meet certain standards of quality before it was certified and the value assessed, and notes issued.\n\nSpanish pistoles were used, with a value of 17 shillings and 6 cents, Arabian Chequins were valued at 10 shillings. Pieces of eight, if they weighed 16-penny were valued at five shillings, French crowns at five shillings, Peruvian pieces of eight and Dutch Dollars were valued at four shillings. English coins were given their English value.\n\nThe hiring, or renting, of a slave to another person was a common practice, and was obviously in use by HENRY. A man who needed labor, but could not invest in the buying of a slave, could get needed labor by renting the slave from the owner. The renter was usually responsible for feeding and housing the slave and providing minimal clothing. The price of slaves varied from year to year and with the age, health, and skill of the slave, as well as the local need for labor. Tobacco cultivation required great amounts of skilled and unskilled labor.\n\nThomas Pollard, mentioned in HENRY’s will, was a very wealthy and influential man. He lived at that time in Fairfax County, but had business dealings all over Virginia. His sister, Jane, was the widow of the very wealthy [to start with!] spendthrift Nathaniel West Dandridge. Jane, after the death of Nathaniel, who had mortgaged his estates, apparently even though he did not have the right to mortgage them all, drew up a premarital agreement with her brothers, Thomas and William Pollard, to hold her property, slaves, and lands, in trust, both from her new husband and from the British merchants that had been defrauded by her former husband. The prenuptial agreement, to be signed before she married Thomas Underwood, also included the names of her sisters and nieces. Her niece was Elizabeth Johnson, and her sisters were Ann Taylor, Frances Rogers, Elizabeth Meriwether, and Millie [Sarah?] Pendleton, apparently the wife of Edward Pendleton, one of the trustees. [This agreement was found in the papers of the Underwood vs. Underwood lawsuit in Hanover County, Virginia.]\n\nThomas Pollard and his brother, William, had also witnessed the mortgage that Nathaniel West Dandridge signed giving the trustees, including John Johnson of Hanover, almost complete control over his vast estates. The agreement even listed the amount of food and servants that he was allowed. Dandridge owned 161 slaves. Dorthea Dandridge, his daughter, married Patrick Henry. The trustee, John Johnson, was mentioned in records after the Revolution as having left for England. Apparently he had absconded with some of the money from the sale of some of Dandridge’s slaves who were sold and the money supposed to be applied toward the debts. Some of the Dandridge property was not entailed, but the bulk apparently was.\n\nThe American Revolution almost stopped the trade with England and it was difficult for the colonists to sell their produce, or secure goods. Financial matters were difficult for the Americans, many of whom lost everything. After the Revolution, about 1800, the British merchants, who had bad debts against Americans started making some attempts to collect the 30-year-old debts. The merchants principally supplied goods to and bought tobacco from the Tidewater residents. In some cases, the British agents made considerable efforts to track down the debtors. The lists compiled by the agents are very helpful to genealogists today.\n\nIn the list of British mercantile debts, HENRY WISHART, from Loudoun County, is listed as a debtor for 9.3.10 3/4 [pounds, shillings, etc.] due November 10, 1776. It states “died about 30 years ago, then solvent, Richard Wheeler, executor.” No mention is made of whether this debt was ever collected from his estate. Drummond Wheeler-3 had a son, Richard Wheeler-4, and he was the successor executor of HENRY WISHEART’s will, due to the family’s connection to the Simpsons. Jean/Jenny Wisheart had first married Moses Simpson, son of GEORGE, and when he died, she married Richard Wheeler-4, the son of SUSANNAH WHEELER SIMPSON’s brother, Drummond Wheeler-3.\n\nChapter VIII\n\nThe Family of Anne Neale-5, Wife of Henry Wisheart\n\nDaniel Neale-1; Christopher-2; Daniel-3; Presley-4; Anne-5\n\nWe know little personally about ANNE NEALE-5, the wife of HENRY WISHEART, beyond a few skimpy details and that she was probably deceased by the time HENRY died. Her ancestry traces back to some of the more prominent members of the Northumberland/Stafford/Fairfax area, including some members of the House of Burgesses. The “gentry” of seventeenth-century Virginia were very closely allied with each other, and tended to marry and inter-marry within their own ranks, both socially and financially. Marriage was more a uniting of estates than a “love match” in many families. Love was expected to come after marriage, if it came, but romantic love, as we know it today, was not considered necessary for a successful marriage.\n\nThe PRESLEY, NEALE, RODHAM, THOMPSON, and MUSE[Mewes] families are found intertwined with other early settlers in the mid-seventeenth century and eighteenth century in Northumberland County, Virginia. The first mention of the PRESLEYs is in 1647, when the original member of the family, WILLIAM PRESLEY-1, represented the area in the Assembly. How much before 1647 the family came is unknown, but it couldn’t conceivably have been too many years previously. The Virginia Colony was only starting to feed itself by the mid-1600s, and only recently had the dirt, disease, distemper, and other problems ceased to kill 75% of the new arrivals before they had bee"
