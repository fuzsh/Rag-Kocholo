        "text": "E-ANNEX 1Exposures to Miner Cohorts: Review of Estimates for the Studies\n\nColorado Plateau Uranium Miners\n\nIntroduction\n\nUranium mining in the Colorado Plateau expanded rapidly in the post-World War II period to include more than 200 mines by 1950 (see Time Line E-1). The start of an industry and the boom times did not lead to orderly administration and record keeping, c.f. Czechoslovakia and Ontario below. Moreover, some of the miners who worked in the mines during the post-war uranium boom had previously worked the same ore bodies for radium and vanadium without any accounting of exposure to radon progeny. Most of the early mines were small and depended on natural ventilation so that ambient temperature change was the driving force for exchange of the mines' air with outside air. Until 1967, mining operations were regulated only by the states where mining was taking place, even though all ore was sold to the Atomic Energy Commission. There was no requirement in place for measurement of exposure and there was not a federal standard for exposure to radon progeny. Consequently adequate ventilation practices were not uniformly introduced from the outset and the extent of radon measurement was initially quite limited. As a result, estimates of cumulative exposures to uranium miners on the Colorado Plateau were largely based on various estimation procedures rather than direct measurements relating to a particular mine shaft or even the mine where a given worker was exposed.\n\nThe history of radon exposures to the miners was described by Holaday (1969) and the approaches followed by the U.S. Public Health Service for esti-\n\nmating exposures of individual participants in the epidemiologic study of Colorado uranium miners are described in National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-National Institute for Environmental Sciences Joint Monograph No. 1 (Lundin and others 1971). A 1968 report of the Federal Radiation Council addressed the accuracy of the exposure estimates. SENES Consultants Limited of Ontario, Canada, has prepared a report entitled \"Preliminary feasibility study into the re-evaluation of exposure data for the Colorado Plateau uranium miner cohort study\" (SENES 1995). This report provides an extensive description of the calculation of the WLM values for the epidemiologic study and gives insights into the sources of variability and error in the estimates.\n\nEstimation of WLM\n\nThe following description is taken largely from the 1971 monograph authored by Lundin and colleagues. The U.S. Public Health Service began surveying for radon in uranium mines in 1949. In 1950 they were joined by the Colorado State Department of Health and in 1951 by the U.S. Bureau of Mines for mines on Indian reservations. Coverage was far from complete; 1949 \"a few measurements,\" 1950 \"relatively few mines,\" 1951 \"but again coverage was incomplete,\" (Lundin and others 1971). By 1952 an effort was made to survey all operating mines and radon progeny were sampled in 157 mines. This sampling may have examined most of the larger mines, but government records\n\nindicate that over 450 mines shipped ore in 1951. Mining companies introduced radon surveys in 1956 and the state programs continued through 1960. Both company and state-sampling efforts were made in work areas for information purposes, not for control purposes, and \"are considered to be representative of the areas in the mines in which miners were exposed\" (Lundin and others 1971). This early data base is of primary importance in considering the adequacy and precision of miner's exposure estimates as utilized in epidemiology assessments of risks due to radon since a large portion of the cumulative exposure occurred in the 1950's.\n\nBy 1960, exposure levels had dropped precipitously in anticipation of Colorado's adoption of a 10 WL shutdown level in 1961. However, regulatory control probably reduced the validity of the measurements in mines for epidemiologic purposes. As outlined in Joint Monograph No. 1, the most complete description of the Colorado Plateau miner data (Lundin and others 1971) \"Most radon daughter measurements available from Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming after 1960 were made by mine inspectors who measured air samples primarily for control purposes.\" This may have led to bias in the estimated exposures. As noted by Lundin and others (Lundin and others 1971), \"Proportionately more measurements were made in sections of mines having high levels which tended to yield radon-progeny values greater than would have been obtained by sampling all work areas with equal frequency.\" In addition more measurements were concentrated in mines having high levels of radon. The U.S.P.H.S. investigators who assembled the data base for estimating cumulative exposures chose to exclude company measurements made after 1960 on the grounds that they might have been \"minimized to avoid regulatory action.\" The aim was clearly ''to assure a consistent direction of bias, that is, over estimation of radon daughter levels\" (Lundin and others 1971).\n\nEven though the number of radon-progeny measurements increased during the 1960's, the number per mine increased only slowly from about six in 1960 to almost 12 in 1968 (Figure E Annex 1-1). Measurements of radon progeny in a particular mine were never extensive and, more importantly, were not made on even a once per year basis in the majority of mines. Only 341 miners, about 10% in the Colorado Plateau miner cohort, had their exposure assignments based on measured radon-progeny concentration. For the majority of the miners, information on measured levels was combined with estimates made using a variety of methods as described by Lundin and others (1971).\n\nMany of the uranium miners were also employed as hardrock miners or previous to 1950 some had mined the same ore bodies, where uranium was found, for radium, vanadium etc., particularly in the Urivan Mineral Belt in Colorado. In the epidemiologic study, hardrock miners were assigned an exposure level of 1 WL for mining that occurred before 1935, 0.5 WL for 1935 through 1939, and 0.3 WL for later years (Lundin and others 1971). No information is given as to the basis of these estimates but a statement is included in Joint Monograph No. 1\n\n(Lundin and others 1971) which indicates these estimates were thought to have been too high and that the average exposure was less.\n\nA re-evaluation of a sample of the Colorado Plateau cohort for exposure during hardrock mining is described in Monograph 1. This reassessment indicates that the tabulation of hard rock mining duration was subject to error and that misclassification of exposure was fairly common for that portion of a cohort member's work experience. For example, for a sample of 101 cases and 202 controls, misclassification was only about 10% for cumulative exposures of less than 20 WLM but 50% or more at higher levels. Nevertheless, hard rock mining may be a relatively unimportant source of exposure compared to the mining of uranium-bearing ores for which exposure levels were often much higher than 1 WLM.\n\nBecause relatively few mines were initially monitored for radon or radon progeny, exposure estimates in uranium mines that occurred before 1951 were referred to as \"guesstimates\" in Joint Monograph No. 1 (Lundin and others 1971). According to that report, \"guesstimates\" were made on the basis of knowledge concerning ore bodies, ventilation practices, emission rates from different types of ores, and such radon or radon progeny measurements as were performed in 1951 and 1952.\n\nFor mining that occurred after 1950, three other methods were used to estimate exposure levels. By far the most common was a process called area average estimation. This consisted of using the available, albeit often sparse, measured values to estimate concentrations in a given locality to obtain an \"area average.\" In order to reduce sampling variability for these area averages it was required that three or more mines and ten or more samples had to be available for a locality in a year, otherwise the locality was assigned the average for the district in which it was located (Lundin and others 1971). If sufficient data for a district were not available, a state average was used or, in a few cases for which state data were insufficient, data for the state of Colorado were used. The degree to which area estimates were used to obtain exposure estimates is not often appreciated. Area estimates account for most of the exposure assignments throughout the study period of the Colorado Plateau cohort (Figure E Annex 1-2) Monograph 1 implies that when an individual mine was thought to differ appreciably from others in the same locality due to its ore quality or mining practices, guesstimation was substituted for an area average.\n\nTo complete gaps in the measurements in calculating individual WLM estimates, a system of extrapolation, interpolation, and expert judgment was used to estimate the exposure in mines monitored less frequently than once a year. For mines with actual measurements at least once every five years, working-level estimates were obtained by interpolation, that is, averaging the measured values\n\n(Lundin and others 1971). Approximately 20% of the exposure assignments were made using this method (Figure E Annex 1-2). An assessment of this extrapolation procedure described in Monograph No. 1 indicates that it tended to overestimate exposures in the early years of mining but became more valid in the 1960s as information from more frequent measurements became available.\n\nFor mines with yearly monitoring information available, the measured concentration was used to assign a worker's cumulative exposure in a given year. Table IV-3 in the BEIR IV Report (NRC 1988) indicates that the number of measurements per year per mine surveyed was usually between 10 and 20 after 1959 so that the measured values provide a reasonably stable estimate of the average working levels in those areas monitored. However, the average number per mine was somewhat less, 8–9 as illustrated in Figure E Annex 1-1. Although nearly 43,000 measurements were obtained (Lundin and others 1971), there were about 2,500 mines and measured concentrations were not a frequent method of exposure assignment. Figure E Annex 1-2 indicates that from 1959 to 1969 only 10–20% of the exposure assignments in a given year were based on direct measurement of radon progeny concentration and that even fewer were made on such direct information prior to 1959, when exposure levels were, on the whole, much higher.\n\nAssessment of Errors in the WLM Estimates\n\nA comparison of exposure estimates in relation to calendar year is given in Figure E Annex 1-3 for each assignment method. Except for 1950, estimates based on the extrapolation procedures are in reasonable agreement with those based on direct measurement while area average estimates tend to be somewhat greater than obtained by other methods. This may in part be due to measurements having been made more frequently in large mines having more employees and because of larger capital investment in better ventilation.\n\nThe degree of variation in exposures among workers in a given mine was not well characterized. Before 1960 mechanical ventilation was not commonly used and a near equilibrium between radon and progeny was probably the rule under conditions of convective ventilation as indicated by the early data described by Holaday (1969). There appears to be no information on aerosol size distribution or even the unattached fraction in early mines. Even though diesel power was not common, compressed air or electricity was used to operate equipment including ore cars; dust was plentiful from drilling and hauling operations so that it is likely that the unattached fraction was low.\n\nAn extensive study of air quality in nine uranium mines was carried out by the AEC Health and Safety Laboratory (HASL), now the DoD Environmental Monitoring Laboratory, in 1967–1968. Mines were selected by the U.S. Bureau of Mines to represent a cross section of the uranium mining industry (Breslin and others 1969). This investigation was in response to the concerns expressed at the\n\nJoint Committee on Atomic Energy hearings in 1967 in which the validity of exposure and early risk estimates of increased lung-cancer in miners were questioned. A particular point in question was \"the extreme variation of atmospheric characteristics within a mine and among mines\"; the HASL study was directed at exploring this question (Breslin and others 1969).\n\nThe nine mines studied ranged in size from having two to 112 workers. Ore production varied from 150 to 11,000 tons per month. Mechanical ventilation rates varied from 5,600 to 100,000 cu. ft. per minute. Given this range of conditions, atmospheric conditions were surprisingly uniform, giving some credence to the validity of the estimation methods described above. In most of the mines the variation in radon-progeny concentration at different times and locations was only occasionally as large as a factor of two and 80% of the time had a coefficient of variation of 30% or less. The average WL ratio (pCi progeny to pCi radon) averaged 0.23 with a geometric standard deviation of 1.6 and showed limited variation with the absolute level of radon progeny. Equilibrium values F were also in a narrow range: about two-thirds were between 0.20 and 0.30; mode 0.25. Polonium-214 was most often at 16% of the equilibrium value, range 0.09 to 0.49.\n\nSimultaneous measurements of radon progeny were made at various locations in stopes (mining chambers) and in drifts (tunnels). While drifts showed\n\ngreater variation than stopes, as indicated in Figure E Annex 1-4, the report's authors indicated that sampling location was not critical within a radius of 10 to 20 feet of the miners' location and that breathing-zone sampling was unnecessary. Similarly, the HASL study indicated that differences between various mining operations, for example, drilling, mucking, etc., had little effect on the measured working level (Figure E Annex 1-5). No measurements were taken immediately after blasting but such areas would not have been occupied because of other safety considerations. While the HASL study does indicate that mine-wide averaging probably provides a useful measure of worker exposure in the mines studies, this is probably less accurate for the high exposures which occurred before the introduction of mechanical ventilation in U.S. uranium mines.\n\nThe recent report from SENES Consultants Limited provides additional relevant information. Tables for several mines demonstrate substantial variation in WL values within a mine during a single visit by an inspector, typically one day. For example, U.S. Bureau of Mines data for one Utah mine in 1968 showed variation from 0.4 to 5.4 WL across the mine (Table-E Annex 1-1).\n\nThe Public Health Service investigators used self-reported mining history as the basis for estimating time spent underground in specific mines. This information was collected both retrospectively and prospectively during the annual miner censuses. The possibility of error in these histories has been acknowledged. The SENES report provides a series of case descriptions documenting inconsistencies in these histories and gives a compilation of exposure estimates for 78 miners for whom exposures have been calculated for both the epidemiologic study and for other purposes. Substantial variation is evident in these\n\nestimates, largely reflecting various discrepancies in the alternative work histories used for the purpose of estimating the exposure.\n\nNew Mexico Uranium Miners\n\nLarge-scale uranium mining began in the early 1950s (see Time Line E-2) with the opening of the Jackpile mine, an open-pit mine. By the late 1950s, a number of large mines were operating at Ambrosia Lake and the Churchrock mining district became active in the late 1970s. The industry continued operating into the early 1990s, longer than in other U.S. locations, so that miners working after 1968 have individual exposure records (work location estimates and estimates of exposure) for this period of employment. These were calculated based on area measurements and work locations. For the most part, post-1968 employment was in very large industrial operations with state of the art ventilation. Mean annual exposures in 1968 were about 3.8 WLM and declined to 1.2 WLM or less by 1972 (Samet and others 1986b). Earlier exposures were not estimated as accurately, although the State Health Department and the State Mine Inspector had implemented active measurement programs by the late 1950s. The state implemented a progressively more stringent series of shut-down concentrations. As for the Colorado Plateau miners (see above), median annual exposures were considerably larger during the earlier years of the industry, about 30 WLM in the 1960's. Some members of the New Mexico cohort, who had also mined in the Colorado Plateau, had annual exposures as high as 300 WLM or more (Samet and others 1991).\n\nInvestigators directed substantial effort at tracing employment histories for the purpose of estimating the cumulative exposures for those employed before exposure estimates were individualized (Samet and others 1991). The miners' underground employment and exposures in specific mines were traced by examining company personnel records and self-reported work histories taken at the time of periodic medical examinations. Estimated exposures for miners who had worked underground on the Colorado Plateau were supplied by the USPHS (Lundin and others 1971; Samet and others 1991). Contributions to the total mean exposure from various information sources are listed in Table E Annex 1-2 (Samet and others 1991).\n\nWith the notable exception of those members of the work force employed on the Colorado Plateau, this cohort probably has maintained the most extensively documented exposure estimates. In this regard, it should be noted that the state of New Mexico had more extensive and more frequent monitoring for radon then was common elsewhere in the early 1950's when exposures were very high (Lundin and others 1971). From 1957 to 1967 exposure estimates are based on 20,086 measurements taken during 1,886 visits. Most annual exposures were relatively low during this period, mean 4-5 WLM per year, so that this cohort has a large sub-cohort of miners exposed at low rates and relatively low cumulative exposures.\n\nBeaverlodge Uranium Miners\n\nThe BEIR-IV report also includes a description of the exposure estimates for this cohort (NRC 1988). Exploratory uranium mining at Beaverlodge,\n\ncontrol analysis of lung-cancer mortality (Howe and Stager 1996), which used cases and controls from a previous analysis that used the original exposure estimates (L'Abbe and others 1991). In the new analysis, averages rather than medians of the individual measurement data were used to estimate exposure levels in a given location. There was also a systematic consideration of the locations where mining took place at a given period of time and, in many cases, individual miners could be assigned to a given mine face, as recorded in bonus-pay information, removing in some measure the radon error inherent in using mine-wide averages.\n\nThe effects of these changes is illustrative of what an improved exposure assessment can accomplish. The exposure estimates for each of the miners in the case-control study were compared to those used in the original cohort and case-control studies. In general, the more recent exposure estimates were considerably higher than the original estimates, the mean exposure increasing from 50.6 WLM to 81.3 WLM. There is evidence that the new estimates reduced exposure misclassification. Table E Annex 1-3 compares the cumulative exposure estimates used in the original cohort study to the newer estimates for the case-control study.\n\nBecause of the wide intervals of grouped exposures, most workers remained in the same exposure category even though their estimated exposures were on the average considerable larger in the revised exposure estimates. However, there was a decrease in the number of workers receiving low exposures and a corresponding increase at higher levels. For example, the number of workers in the 200+ WLM group increased from 10 to 15 (Table E Annex 1-3). Because there is less misclassification of estimated exposures, the slope of the regression of risk on cumulative exposure is increased even though the estimated exposures increased. The original estimate of the excess relative risk from the case-control was an excess relative risk of 2.70% per 100 WLM while the revised exposure assessment was 3.25% (Howe and Stager 1996).\n\nTABLE E ANNEX 1-3 Number of miners in each exposure category\n\nCumulative Exposure WLM\n\nCohort Study\n\nCase-Control Study\n\n0\n\n43\n\n42\n\n1–24\n\n90\n\n80\n\n25–49\n\n15\n\n18\n\n50–99\n\n15\n\n17\n\n100–199\n\n18\n\n19\n\n200+\n\n10\n\n15\n\nOntario Uranium Miners\n\nUranium mining in Ontario, Canada, started in 1953, somewhat later then in the United States and was conducted in relatively few mines in comparison to the United States (see Time Line E-4). A 12 WLM annual limit was adopted in 1954 with a concomitant decrease in annual exposure thereafter. Radon measurement and radon control programs were instituted within two years of the start of mining. Except for exposures occurring before 1958, exposure estimates are largely based on actual measurements (SENES 1989). However, some Ontario uranium miners had worked earlier as gold miners and were exposed to both radon progeny and arsenic in those operations. These miners had an estimated average cumulative exposure 2 WLM due to gold mining (Kusiak and others 1991) compared to an average of 30 WLM in uranium mines (Kusiak and others 1993). Even for those with gold mining experience, the approximated exposures from gold mining are only a minor portion of the total exposure.\n\nThe BEIR IV report provides a complete description of the exposure estimates for their cohort (NRC 1988). The radon-progeny measurement program was extensive: 131,000 measurements in 15 mines. Exposures were estimated using different methods for 1967 and earlier years and for 1968 and later years for which WLM estimates made by the companies were used. For 1957–1967, WLM were calculated by combining WL data with work histories. Two separate sets of estimates were derived for these years: the ''standard\" or lower WL values were\n\nthe averages of the four quarterly averages or three four-month averages for a particular year while the \"special\" or upper WL values were a weighted average of the four highest quarterly measurements or the three highest four-month measurements in headings, stoops, raises, and travel ways. The differences between these two sets of values varied by mine and by year, with the special values being up to four times as high as the standard values. The investigators considered that the true exposures were bounded by the two sets of values. For its analysis, the BEIR IV committee used the WLM values based on the standard WL values. Some estimation of exposures for the earliest years of the industry, before 1954, required extrapolation from measured values, taking into account such factors as ventilation. These years included the highest exposures and consequently 22 percent of the total WLM accumulated by the cohort was based on extrapolation of measured values.\n\nPort Radium Uranium Miners\n\nThe approach for exposure estimation for the Port Radium miners is well documented in a 1996 report by SENES Consultants Limited (1996b). Underground uranium and/or pitchblende mining at Port Radium started in 1932 and continued, with a two-year interruption, until 1960 (see Time Line E-5). Because records of employment before 1940 were not available, exposures occurring before that date have not been accounted for (Howe and others 1987, SENES\n\n1989). Exposures occurring after 1939 have been estimated on the basis of rather sparse monitoring data for radon. Between 1945 and 1957, 261 radon measurements were made in seven years of this period, with from nine to 71 samples in an individual year. A few radon-progeny measurements were made and only three paired measurements of radon and progeny were obtained.\n\nAbsent information on concentrations of radon progeny, the equilibrium between radon and its progeny was estimated on the basis of knowledge of mine operations and by analogy from the Beaverlodge mine and the radon concentrations were then converted to concentrations of progeny. Although ventilation was introduced in 1947, it apparently was used in limited fashion during the winter season because of the cold. Consequently, the approach to estimating the WL values considered seasonal variation in equilibrium factor. The SENES report provides detailed documentation of the assumptions made in estimating the WL values from the radon measurements.\n\nReported radon concentrations were extremely variable ranging from 50–300,000 pCiL-1 and it is thought that before ventilation was introduced, some exposures could have been as high as 1,000 WLM per year (SENES 1989). Unfortunately, such large annual exposures could not be assigned to the involved workers unless the exposures took place after 1940 because of the missing work-history information before 1940.\n\nThe potential limitations of the exposure data were acknowledged in the initial report on the findings of the epidemiologic study of Port Radium miners (Howe and others 1987). SENES Consultants Limited (1996b) have recently re-estimated exposures to radon progeny for 171 miners included in a case-control study (see Table E Annex 1-4). For the 171 miners, employment histories were reconstructed and used with revised WL estimates to calculate WLM. Substan\n\nTABLE E ANNEX 1-4 Summary of differences between the SENES reevaluation of miner exposures and epidemiology exposures used by Howe and others (1987). Data from 171 minersa\n\ntial differences were found in individual estimates, although the mean WLM values were comparable for the two sets of estimates. There were large differences in employment duration for some of the men and changes in estimated exposure as large as 2900 WLM were found. The report comments on key sources of uncertainty in the exposure estimates for the Port Radium miners: incomplete employment histories for other employment; lack of employment information for years before 1940 when exposures were extremely high; and the numerous assumptions made in calculating the WL values from the radon measurements. Finally, the report also indicates that Port Radium ores contained \"significant concentrations of various elements including for example arsenic, nickel, and cobalt.\"\n\nCzechoslovakia Uranium Miners\n\nA cohort of miners in Czechoslovakia, who started uranium mining between 1948 and 1957, has been described extensively in the literature by Sevc and Placek (1976), Sevc and others (1988), Kunz and others (1978, 1979), and more recently by Tomásek and others (1993, 1994a,b). This cohort is often designated as group S by the Czech authors (see Time Line E-6). Compared to miner studies in other countries, exposure information for group S is among the most extensive. Measurement of radon and other potentially hazardous materials had become routine in Czech mines before 1948 so that estimation was not necessary for periods of employment during which radon measurements were not made. Even so, exposure estimates for radon-progeny exposures prior to 1961 are based on radon concentrations as concentrations of progeny were not measured.\n\nThese radon measurements were, however, extensive, the annual number varying from 100 to 700 per shaft (Sevc 1993). Estimates of WLM for years before 1961, during which radon measurements only were made, were based on F values taken during periods of ventilation failure which occurred in 1969 and 1973. These data indicated an F value of 0.86 for the earliest years 1948–1952. From 1961–1969 the mean number of annual radon-progeny measurements recorded per shaft was 952, about 3 per work day.\n\nIn 1953, natural ventilation was augmented by mechanical means and F values decreased to an estimated average value of 0.55 in 1953–1959 and to 0.36 thereafter. Czech investigators estimate the coefficient of variation in converting radon levels to working levels as 28%. The fraction of unattached plutonium-214 has been estimated by Czech investigators as 0.1 (Hamilton and others 1990).\n\nEstimated exposures of these miners have recently been reevaluated (Tomásek and others 1994a,b). The principal change appears to have been a more thorough investigation of workers' employment histories to take account of prior mining experience and the assignment of exposure for each month based on the particular shaft in which the miner worked. In any event, the newest account given below is more complete than those published previously. Additional background can be found in a report of a WHO-sponsored trip to Czechoslovakia made in 1988 by L.D. Hamilton, L.W. Swent, and D. B. Chambers (published by SENES Consultants Limited—see Hamilton and others 1990).\n\n\"During 1949–1963 about 39,000 measurements of radon gas were made in the 19 mine shafts in Jachymov and Horoni Slakov in which the men were employed. Some men also worked, particularly after the closure of most shafts at Jachymov and Horoni Slakov in 1963, at other Czechoslovak uranium mines, and substantial numbers of measurements were also made in these mines. An initial review of exposure estimates used in previous reports found a considerable number of errors, and for some miners a part of their employment histories had not been taken into account. Therefore, exposure estimates have been completely revised for the present analysis, based on a review of all available information. The radon-gas measurements were converted into estimates in terms of working levels using equilibrium factors based on radon-progeny measurements made after 1960, and on data collected during two accidents in the uranium mines at Zadni Chodov in 1969 and at Pribram in 1973, when mechanical ventilation was stopped for at least a month. An estimate of each man's exposure in each month in terms of working months (WLM) was calculated from the time he spent in each mine shaft in conjunction with the year- and shaft-specific WL estimates. Men worked 6 days per week with 1-month of holiday each year. For most men underground work was assumed to last 8 hours per day, but for geologists, safety and ventilation technicians, and emergency workers, it was estimated that 70% of working time was spent underground, while for managers 50% was estimated. About 300 men were involved in exploratory work, which was normally carried out in shallow shafts near the surface. Explicit radon measurements are not\n\navailable for this work, but exposures are thought to have been low, and are estimated at 3.3 WLM per year\" (Tomásek and others 1994a).\n\nWith regard to the magnitude of exposure error, it is of interest that less than 5% of the new exposure estimates differed by as much as 50% from those used in previous analyses of these data. The mean cumulative exposure in the new evaluation is 219 WLM compared with 227 WLM in the older work (Sevc 1993). Presumably, random error as well as systematic biases were reduced in the reevaluation. Using a simple model in which the estimated relative risk is linearly related to the cumulative exposure yields a relative risk of 0.37%/WLM (95% C.I. = 0.18–0.55) with the old exposure estimates. With the new ones the estimated relative risk is 0.61%/WLM (95% C.I. = 0.29–0.8) (Tomásek and others 1994), providing evidence that the dose-response was flattened by errors in the original exposure estimates.\n\nFrench Uranium Miners\n\nUranium mining in France started in 1946 with exploratory operations that continued through 1948 when extensive commercial operations commenced (Tirmarche and others 1984, 1993) (see Time Line E-7). The first reported radon sampling occurred in 1953 when 40 measurements were taken, an average of 10 per mine. Large-scale radon monitoring began in 1956 when forced ventilation was introduced. Exposures prior to this date have been estimated retrospectively by an expert group which considered mine characteristics and type and duration of work. For this early period, before forced ventilation, exposures were relatively high and varied substantially between individuals. The estimated median annual exposure from 1947 through 1955 was 11 WLM and varied for the 3rd quartile up to 55 WLM per year.\n\nExposures declined rapidly after forced ventilation was introduced, median exposures averaging about 3 WLM per year from 1956 to 1975 with a further decline to 1 WLM by the early 1980's. About half of the French miners started their underground employment before 1956 but most of their person years of exposure occurred after monitoring became comprehensive, ventilation improved, and exposures were relatively low. Nevertheless, for a large number of the French miners, a major portion of their cumulative exposure was based on estimations by experts for the period when ventilation was poor and routine monitoring lacking. After sufficient monitoring data became available, worker-exposure assessments were individualized to some extent by considering the type and location of work performed. Recently, personal dosimeters, using track-etch dosimeters, have provided direct information on individual miners. This has allowed a comparison of exposure based on area monitoring in 1982 with direct personal measurements in 1983. The comparison indicated that annual exposures based on area monitoring and work locations were, on the average, underestimated by almost 30% (Bernhard and others 1984; Piechowski and others 1981). Con-\n\nsidering the year-to-year variation in the true levels and miner location, as well as the accuracy of the personal dosimeters, the reported difference may not be indicative of a significant bias in the exposure estimates.\n\nRadium Hill Uranium Miners\n\nThe Radium Hill mine began operations in Australia in 1952 and radon monitoring began two years later (see Time Line E-8). In estimating exposures, exposure levels in the prior years were assumed to be the same as in early 1954 (Woodward and others 1991). A total of 56 samples were collected by 1 April 1955. Early radon concentrations were low (estimated 1.8 WL) even before forced ventilation was introduced and declined substantially thereafter—range 0. 10–0.55 WL. Apparently only radon concentrations were measured; WL concentrations were estimated by means of a calculated equilibrium factor based on ventilation rates and air volumes at various locations but such methods do not account for plateout and recirculation of progeny.\n\nEnough radon measurements were made to allow exposure estimates by job category for work after 1 April 1955. The estimated exposures for workers show an exponential distribution with a median exposure of 3 WLM; a mean of 7 WLM and a 3rd quartile limit of 7.4 WLM. A few heavily exposed workers received about 80 WLM (Woodward and others 1991).\n\nChinese Tin Miners\n\nExposure assessments of Chinese miners employed by the Yunnan Tin Corporation are largely retrospective as no measurements of either radon or radon progeny were made prior to 1972 when mechanical ventilation was introduced (see Time Line E-9). Exposure estimates for two periods prior to 1972 reflect changes in the mining industry that occurred after nationalization in 1949. Before nationalization, mining was conducted in small mines with back hauling performed manually, often by children (Xuan and others 1993). To estimate exposures under these conditions, 117 measurements were made in 13 local mine pits that had been in operation before the large-scale expansion of the tin mines that started in 1953.\n\nExposure estimates for miners employed between 1953 and 1972 were based on 413 measurements obtained in the 1990's by recreating conditions in tunnels and galleries in original areas or in similarly configured areas in nearby mines that used techniques similar to those in the index year (Xuan and others 1993). Evidently, there was little change in radon progeny concentration in the larger, post 1953 mines. The reported average mean WL before 1950 was 2.3 ± 0.8 and 2.2 ± 1.2 thereafter. Mechanical ventilation was introduced rather slowly with priority given to new tunnels. Working levels decreased moderately in 1971–1975 to 1.7 ± 1.1, to 1.2 ± 0.8 in 1980 and 0.9 ± 0.3 in 1985 (Xiang-Zhen and others 1993). Exposure estimates from experience since 1972 have been based on over 26,000 measurements of radon progeny.\n\nLittle information is available on other characteristics of the occupational environment. Equilibrium factors, F, were measured in 1977–1978 and found to vary from 20% to 84% with a mean of 72% in \"small pit operations\" and of 62% in \"larger tunnels\" (Lubin and others 1990b). Evidently the mean of 72% refers to conditions prior to 1953 and the mean of 62% to the expanded operations. In any event the mines were very dusty by contemporary standards. Airborne dust was first measured in the 1950's and maximum levels were between 20 and 192 mg/m3. Wet drilling was introduced in the late 1950's and became widespread in 1964 when dust levels fell to about 6.2 mg/m3 (Xiang-Zhen and others 1993). Given these levels of dust, it is probable that equilibrium levels remained rather high throughout and that the unattached fraction was small.\n\nFor the epidemiological studies, workers were assumed to be exposed to radon progeny seven hours per day. For exposures occurring after 1972, estimates of exposures were adjusted by the worker's job title to take account of those exposed intermittently (Lubin and others 1990b). Exposure to arsenic in airborne dust was also accounted for in these studies and shows a large decrease over time from 0.4 mg/m3 in the mid 1950's to .01 mg/m3 in 1985. The radon exposure estimates for the Yunnan tin miners are not very well documented but, given the apparently uniform level of exposure throughout the period of miner employment, about a factor of 2, the estimates may be less subject to errors in estimation then for those uranium mines where exposure levels varied over time by factors of ten or more due to changes in ventilation practices. Arsenic exposure, on the other hand, did decrease appreciably as wet drilling became standard practice.\n\nNewfoundland Fluorspar Miners\n\nUnderground mining for fluorspar started in 1936 in Newfoundland, Canada, and continued for more than three decades before monitoring for radon and radon progeny was initiated in 1960 (see Time Line E-10). Radon levels were found to be highly variable, range 0–190 WL (Morrison and others 1988). Ventilation was immediately introduced and in 1960 levels declined to an average of 0.5 WL (1960–1967) and then to an average of 0.17 WL (1969–1978) (Morrison and others 1988). Therefore, an average worker for the entire period of radon control would have accumulated about 30 WL as opposed to an estimated average exposure for all cohort members of 382.8 WL.\n\nExposure estimates for epidemiological purposes have been developed by Dory and Cockill (1984) and are described in SENES 1989. Exposure estimates for the period before 1961 were based on maps of the various mines, reports by mine inspectors, and workers' recollections. Apparently experience gained when the mines were monitored was also taken into account as well as the entry of water, the source of the radon, into the mines. Eventually a computational model was developed to simulate the annual radon progeny concentration in each mine so as to yield \"average workplace concentration for high, medium, and low areas\" (SENES 1989). For epidemiological purposes, workers have on the basis of their jobs been assigned to approximate areas of radon concentration, high, medium, etc. for a particular year and cumulative exposures estimated on this basis.\n\nFor exposures occurring after 1960, worker job records and monitoring data have been used to assign individual exposure estimates. As noted above, this period of employment is likely to be relatively unimportant for risk estimation because of the relatively small exposures. It is impossible to estimate the accu-\n\nracy of the exposure estimates for before 1960. Radon concentrations in mine water varied form 300 to 1300 pCiL-1 in 1960 (Report of the Royal Commission 1969). Under such conditions, actual exposures must have been highly variable and in spite of the thorough assessment performed by Corkhill and Dory, the estimated cumulative exposures are guesstimates c.f. Colorado Plateau miners.\n\nSwedish Iron Miners\n\nThe BEIR IV report provides an extensive description of exposure estimates for this cohort (NRC 1988). Additional description can be found in a report submitted to the BEIR IV committee, ''Comments to the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration for the American Mining Congress\", prepared by L.W. Swent and D.B. Chambers. This report describes a visit to the mine by Swent and Chambers and their discussion with mine personnel. Much of the material is described in the 1989 report by SENES Consultants Limited (1989).\n\nExposure estimates for the Swedish iron miners are primarily retrospective. The cohort includes those who started work earlier but for the cohort as a whole the average year of first exposure was 1934 (see Time Line E-11). The first extensive measurements of radon in these mines were not made until 1968; radon-progeny measurements were initiated somewhat later. Most of the mine radon came from water seepage and there is limited evidence that this source was relatively constant in strength from 1915 to 1972. Comparison of radon measurements in water taken in 1915 with data from 1972 and 1975 indicated constant groundwater concentration of radon. Exposures have been estimated using the assumption that levels of radon progeny were constant until forced ventilation was introduced in 1972 (Radford and St. Clair Renard 1984). This assumption\n\nE-ANNEX 2Workshop on Uncertainty in Estimating Exposures to Radon Progeny in Studies of Underground Miners\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe epidemiologic studies of underground miners have been the principal basis for estimating the risk of indoor radon (NCRP 1984; NRC 1988; USEPA 1992c).\n\nTo estimate exposure to radon progeny, information is needed on the concentrations to which the miners have been exposed as well as the time spent at these concentrations. There are now 12 studies that include estimates of exposure to radon progeny (Lubin and others 1995b; Darby and others 1995). The exposures received by the miners in these studies began as long ago as the end of the nineteenth century in the case of the Malmberget iron miners (Radford and St. Clair Renard 1984) and are continuing for some of the more contemporary groups, such as the Chinese tin miners (Qiao and others 1989) and the French uranium miners (Tirmarche and others 1993). The information available for estimating exposures varied among the cohorts and even within the cohorts by time period. The measurements tended to be more sparse during the initial years of mining operations, the same years during which exposures were generally highest. In some of the studies (Chinese tin miners, Czechoslovakian uranium miners, Colorado Plateau uranium miners, Ontario uranium miners, and Radium Hill uranium miners, and French uranium miners) concentrations of radon progeny were not measured in the early years of operations and it was necessary to estimate WL based on radon measurements, assuming a value for the equilibrium of radon with its progeny (Lubin and others 1994a). Information was also used on mining practices and measurements were made in the Chinese tin mines based on\n\nre-created mine conditions of earlier years. Personnel records were generally used to document time underground, although the detail of the information available also varied among studies. Gaps in the information available for estimating exposures of the underground miners in these epidemiologic studies are an acknowledged source of exposure misclassification with attendant implications for uncertainty in the risk estimates derived from these studies.\n\nThe consequences for risk estimation of the errors in exposure estimates have been of concern to the BEIR VI committee. The committee recognizes that exposure misclassification is inevitable in the epidemiologic studies of miners. However, techniques are becoming available to account for these errors in estimating exposure-response relationships (Thomas and others 1994). Statistical approaches to measurement error, with the specific application to the underground miner studies, was a topic of a one-half day workshop held in 1994 by the BEIR VI committee.\n\nTo further address the issue of measurement error and its consequences of risk estimation, the BEIR VI committee convened a second workshop on January 23 and 24, 1995. The workshop was designed to bring together geologists and mining and ventilation engineers who had worked on exposure issues in the underground mines with statisticians and epidemiologists who are now contending with the measurement-error problem. The workshop's goal was to obtain additional documentation on approaches followed to assess exposures and to obtain historical insights that might lead to better quantification of the errors in the exposure estimates. The committee also invited statisticians engaged in investigation of approaches for correcting for the effect of measurement error on risk estimates.\n\nThe workshop participants selected were appropriate for these objectives. William Chenoweth, now a consulting geologist in Grand Junction, Colorado, worked for many years for the Atomic Energy Commission. He has written extensively on the history of the various uranium mining districts in the United States. James Cleveland, an engineer, worked for Kerr-McGee Corporation in New Mexico for many years, directing ventilation and safety for the Ambrosia Lake operations of Kerr McGee, by far the largest uranium producer in the Grants Mineral Belt. Andreas George, from the Environmental Measurement Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, made measurements of the attached and unattached fractions of radon progeny during the late 1960s and early 1970s; these data represent the only published, historical information on the distribution of progeny between attached and unattached fractions. Douglas Chambers from SENES Consultants Limited in Ottawa, Canada, has had long-standing interest in the assessment of exposures to radon progeny and the consequences of error for risk estimation. Neal Nelson from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, also a participant, has followed the exposure assessment issue closely for many years.\n\nThe practical experience of these participants was complemented by the statistical expertise of Dan Stram and Duncan Thomas, both from the University\n\nof Southern California. Stram and Thomas have been applying new statistical methods for errors-in-variables to data from the Colorado Plateau miners. Their models make adjustments to risk estimates for measurement error. The workshop was also attended by BEIR VI committee members and Jonathan Samet, the committee's chair, presented descriptive analyses of exposure data for the New Mexico cohort of uranium miners.\n\nThe workshop provided valuable and not-well-documented information concerning the U.S. and Canadian uranium mining industries. Consequently, the committee decided to publish portions of the workshop proceedings as an appendix to its report. We include the historical material presented and not the discussion of ongoing work on measurement error by Stram and Thomas.\n\nWorkshop Introduction\n\nThe workshop began with a welcome and introductions by Jonathan Samet and Evan Douple, the study director. Ethel Gilbert, the workshop chair, reviewed the goals of the workshop and called attention to questions to be considered throughout the workshop. Roger McClellan reminded participants to focus on \"uncertainties,\" not just on \"errors.\" Philip Hopke asked that participants try to recall details regarding the underground mining procedures, especially environmental conditions and the methods used for measuring radon and radon progeny. He asked participants to review those details that have not been previously published or documented. These committee members provided a reminder that the committee needs to characterize the uncertainties that affect different levels of exposure received by the miners.\n\nWilliam Chenoweth (Grand Junction, Colorado)\n\nChenoweth joined the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1953 as a geologist. His work initially involved the vanadium mines of the Colorado Plateau. Vanadium mining was initiated in the mid-1930s; he noted that the mines were not ventilated. He then reviewed the uranium mining operations across the years 1947–1981; approximately two-thirds of the mines were in the Colorado Plateau region. The peaks of uranium mining production were in the 1960's and the 1980's on the Colorado Plateau (Moab, Monticello, and Uravan areas and the Grants Mineral Belt). The peak number of mines in operation was around 750, a total reached in the mid-1950s. The AEC stopped buying ore in 1962. However, it continued to purchase concentrates (yellowcake) from the mills through 1970.\n\nMost uranium ore was mined from sandstone. Mining involves drilling, blasting, and mucking, the extraction of the ore. The needs for mining include compressed air and water; powder, blasting caps, and fuses; and a shovel or machine to load the ore. Typically blasting was done at night and the miners would return the next morning without ventilation operative in the mine. In the\n\nearly mines, ventilation was used primarily to reduce blasting fumes. Chenoweth explained that the typical cut was made with a burn of multiple fuses. The miners used wheelbarrows in remote areas and the larger mines used compressed-air locomotives. There was no ventilation when the 1952 measurements were made. There were incentives for miners to be productive since the AEC needed the uranium.\n\nChenoweth showed the structure of a larger Grants mine with a central ventilation shaft. He also showed a map of the Uravan area near the Colorado-Utah border. Brenner asked whether some of the vanadium miners beginning in 1936 were also uranium miners later. The answer was \"yes.\" The same mines were mined back in the 1920's for radium; there was a radium industry from 1910 through 1923. Douglas Chambers stressed that many of the miners worked their own mines on weekends and others were vanadium miners before they worked in uranium mines. Krewski asked whether there were houses in the area. The answer was \"no,\" as the mines tended to be in very remote locations with just a few ranches nearby.\n\nThe mines were generally 400 to 800 feet below the surface, although some were as much as 2000 feet deep. Chenoweth provided definitions of various mining terms: a \"stope,\" the site of mining, is an area at the end of a \"drift,\" or passage; a \"raise\" is a passage up between drifts whereas a \"winze\" is a passage down between drifts. A map of one early mine showed that there was no ventilation as the rooms were interconnected and the open rooms had randomly placed pillars. The Deremo mine was the largest that Union Carbide mined in the Uravan area. Pictures taken by the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1953–1955 do not show ventilation; one photo showed a fan that was not in use. Chenoweth surmised that it may have been used for venting blasting powder. Between 1948 and 1956, smaller mines probably had less ventilation. Ventilation rates are affected by temperature and recirculation of radon progeny could have been a problem.\n\nThere were various types of operations [U.S. Vanadium (USV) contractors, large mining companies like Walter Duncan, Climax Uranium, Kerr-McGee, Union Carbide, small mining companies, Vanadium Corporation of American (VCA) mines, VCA leasors, small independent operators, and one- or two-man operations]. Some of these mines probably had adequate ventilation, that is, about 500 cubic ft per minute, enough to keep oxygen concentration at about 20%. Early miners did not live in the mines but typically lived in boarding houses; they worked 12-hour shifts and worked 30 days and then spent four or five days in town.\n\nChenoweth presented a summary of the key events in the history of uranium mine ventilation. Diesel-powered trucks and loaders were introduced in the 1960s. Respirators were issued, but they were not necessarily worn. A Bureau of Mines report (IC07908) states that the Climax Uranium Co. Was the first to use rubber-tired diesel equipment in their mines in the Uranan area in the early 1950s.\n\nUnion Carbide adopted extensive air sampling in 1957; it began using diesel in 1958. A shut-down level of 10 WL was adopted in 1958. The U.S. Department of Labor proposed a 3.6 WLM exposure limit in 1969.\n\nSamet asked whether there is any information on arsenic in these mines. Chenoweth explained that a few years ago the Bureau of Land Management asked for a sampling for trace metals in mine dumps. Arsenic was a constituent of some uranium ores. With respect to the question of how many total miners were employed, Chenoweth pointed out that 780 Native American miners were included in the Public Health Service's epidemiologic study, but the Navajo Tribe has registered approximately 2,500 former miners through its Office of Navajo Uranium Workers. There were about 75 miners in 1948 and 5,000 in 1960. Frank Lundin had advised Neal Nelson that 15,000 miners were identified in the Public Health Service surveys, beyond those included in the epidemiologic study (U.S. Bureau of Mines). The current number of miners worldwide is uncertain but underground uranium mining is no longer carried out in the U.S. Some of the current sites of active uranium mining include Canada, China, and Russia. Uranium production is down substantially since the early 1980s and there is now an oversupply of uranium. Countries producing uranium in 1995 were:\n\n• Canada\n\n32% (of world total)\n\n• Australia\n\n11%\n\n•Niger\n\n9%\n\n•USA\n\n7%\n\n•Russia\n\n6%\n\n• Uzbekistan\n\n6%\n\n• Kazakstan\n\n6%\n\n• Namibia\n\n9%\n\n• South Africa\n\n4%\n\n• France\n\n3%\n\n• China\n\n2%\n\n• Gabon\n\n2%\n\n• Other\n\n6%\n\n(From the International Atomic Energy Agency)\n\nJames Cleveland (Edmond, Oklahoma)\n\nFrom 1960 until 1985, Cleveland was with Kerr-McGee. He provided a historical perspective on uranium mining in New Mexico. Uranium mining in New Mexico began with small mines on the Navajo reservation, which operated from the 1948 to 1968. Most Kerr-McGee mines on the reservation were small, operated by less than 20 people and usually by only two or three. The Shiprock uranium mill operated by Kerr-McGee was closed in 1963. The Grants mineral belt, the principal site of uranium mining in the state, stretches 200 miles from the Arizona border to the city of Albuquerque; it is about 25 to 50 miles wide. The Ambrosia Lake and the Jackpill-Paguate districts were the first large-scale production mining areas in New Mexico. In 1980, Grants-area mines employed 4,500 to 5,000 people.\n\nCleveland described a four-day meeting in 1961 between Archer and Wagoner, from the Public Health Service, and the industry. A warning concerning the\n\nwas not adequate. Eventually, large-diameter vent holes, up to 72-inch diameter, were installed to increase ventilation. The mines needed parallel ventilation to deliver fresh air to all parts of the mines. Secondary protection measures, such as filters, respiratory protection (a simple two-canister and air supply unit, or a self-supply unit, depending on levels), and electrostatic precipitators, were proscribed and the latter were used in isolated instances for short periods of time.\n\nRecords of measurements taken once or twice a quarter were initiated by the companies in 1962. The records used the worker's time in travel, time in the stope, and in other locations, and assigned WLM values to each worker. In 1972, the work week was assumed to include 40 hours. When levels were particularly high, measurements were sometimes taken more than once per week. Total WL-hours for the day were then expanded to the work in a week and the exposure was developed for the month. From 1967 on, records became quite complete. Before 1962, however, records were generally of poor quality. Exposures were grossly underestimated in the early days of the industry, when the work week was longer than 40 hours. Ambrosia Lake mines worked a 48-hour week until 1966.\n\nHopke asked whether there was smoking underground. Smoking was banned in Ambrosia Lake in about 1975. Standards for exposure to radon progeny were not in place until 1972 when MESA adopted a 4 WLM standard.\n\nAndreas George (New York, New York)\n\nGeorge addressed sources of variation in the measurements made in mines. Sometimes measurements were not made in proximity to the miners. George provided tables showing some typical measurement values and the range of concentrations measured over three days in various locations in the mines (Note: the mines were not named). In the table (Table E Annex 2-1), the arrow indicates either downcast or upcast ventilation by its direction. The WL values relate to specific locations in the mines but not to individual miners. The measurements were made as often as every 30 minutes. The variation in WL values within a stope was generally not large. Ziemer asked whether there were WL values for samples taken at similar locations but at different times of the year. The answer was \"no.\"\n\nMethods were developed for measuring the unattached fraction and applied in the mining environment. George recalled that measurements were made in four different mines for one week. Polonium-218 was measured to determine the uncombined fraction, which was almost related to the unattached fraction (less than 0.2 %). The uncombined fraction tends to be inversely related to particle concentrations. In the Beaverlodge uranium mines, diesel was used infrequently and the vehicles were primarily powered by electricity. Blasting dust remained in the mine for long time intervals. Ventilation ducts were occasionally damaged during blasting.\n\nMeasurements were made using diffusion batteries developed in his (George's) laboratory. A bimodal distribution of alpha activity was found in some mines, similar to more recent information from homes. The 5–6 nm size was critical because this size is relevant for the bronchial deposition. Classical, bimodal, or unimodal (diesel mines) distributions were obtained for activity-weighted sizes. Five nm is the critical size for the tracheal deposition. NCRP 1978 gives a number of about 1.7, which should be compared to 4 in the publication ''Summary of dose conversion factors from reanalysis of New Mexico uranium mine particle-size data.\" Most of the progeny are attached to the larger particles while the smaller particles are deposited in the lung. It is realistic to assume two-fold variation in measurements from mine to mine.\n\nDouglas Chambers (Ottawa, Canada)\n\nChambers discussed the characteristics of several mines, beginning with the Newfoundland fluorspar mines. The Black Duck Mine opened in 1933 and there was not forced ventilation until the 1950s. For the Newfoundland fluorspar mines, uncertainties are quite high for data before 1967, perhaps as high as 300-fold. The miners smoked heavily and it was a very dusty environment. Chambers was not aware of other contaminants in the mines, such as arsenic. The reconstruction of exposures for these mines has been difficult and the approaches used have been as much as can reasonably be done.\n\nThe original client for uranium from the Ontario mines was the U.S. AEC. Two uranium mines were operational in Ontario in 1955; in 1958 there were 15 mines. Between 1955 and 1981, 131,000 radon-daughter measurements were made over 141 mine-years of operation, averaging 929 measurements per mine-year. Two sets of exposures were calculated, \"standard\" and \"special\" (see 1988 NRC BEIR IV Report for a description of these two sets of exposures). Exposure to aluminum powder was used in an attempt to prevent silicosis. The Canadian report on health and safety in mines is a potential source of information (Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination 1990).\n\nA comparison was made between past and present exposure conditions. Pre-1958 conditions included radon progeny at 0.3 to 1.4 WL and mineral dust at approximately 1 to 9 mg/m3 and for 1990 conditions at 0.05 to 0.3 WL and 0.05 to 1 mg/m3, respectively. The lung-cancer experience of Ontario uranium miners with and without gold-mining history was provided. The observed to expected ratio was greater for those with gold-mining experience.\n\nChambers also provided information concerning the Port Radium uranium mine. In the Port Radium mine, the ventilation was frequently turned off in the winter months. Arsenic may have been 6–7% of the pitchblende ore. Exposures to radon progeny were estimated based on retrospective reconstruction. The ore grade was high and yielded high WLs (50–100 WL). The original estimates were\n\ndone by Frost with Eldorado Nuclear. Chambers indicated that he has all of the records for the Port Radium mine.\n\nChambers also discussed the Beaverlodge mines. There has recently been a reassessment of exposures for some of the miners in the epidemiologic cohort of Beaverlodge mines. He noted that at Beaverlodge, while the person running the drill would be expected to get the highest dose, this was not necessarily the case. In 1990, the Atomic Energy Control Board asked if exposures could be reconstructed from the records. The Schwartzwalter Mine in Colorado is similar to the Beaverlodge Mines.\n\nChambers then discussed the estimation of WLM for Beaverlodge miners. Exposure was estimated by year and type of workplace. Men tended to migrate from one mine to another in the Beaverlodge area and this was not accounted for in the exposure reconstructions. There were six or seven mine areas and nine work-type categories. The reconstructed exposures were compared to the original estimates used in the epidemiologic report of Howe and colleagues. The correlation was strong, although the original exposure estimates tended to be less than the revised exposure estimates. Means rather than medians of individual measurements were used in the new estimates. A summary of observations in the cohort was provided. Many of the miners lived in homes built on uranium-containing foundations. A positive correlation was found between WLMs and konimeter data for particle counts. The category of a miner at first work was a factor (miners needed previous work experience).\n\nFinally, Chambers provided some remarks concerning the Colorado Plateau study. In the Colorado mines, exposures were deliberately overestimated (see Lundin and others 1971). For other hardrock mining, exposures at concentrations of 1.0, 0.5, or 0.3 WL were assigned. A crude trace of work histories of 29 people was presented from Archer, 1966. The uncertainties were related to the location of the miners and their work histories. Studies in the past have not sufficiently considered the uncertainties in the exposures. The exposures after 1969 were probably not that significant, particularly in comparison to earlier years.\n\nJonathan Samet (Baltimore, Maryland)\n\nSamet began by recommending a book, Uranium Frenzy by Raye C. Ringholz (University of New Mexico Press), for a review of the early history of the uranium-mining industry. He reviewed the measurements made in the New Mexico mines. Measurements were first made in the 1950s and by 1961–1967, WL measurements were being made routinely by the State Mine Inspector, the State Health Department, and the industry. He showed examples of data sheets for the years through 1967. Person-weighted totals of the individual measurements were made. These were referred to as Total Mine Indexes; the data sheets also included measurements by the type of area. Samet showed the scatter in the\n\ndata and the substantial variation in the measurements made within individual visits. Jim Cleveland mentioned that inspections by the State Agencies were unannounced. Attention was not paid to ventilation if the inspection results were satisfactory. Exposures in the Colorado Plateau were grossly underestimated by small companies.\n\nDiscussion Of Exposure Estimates\n\nSamet reminded the participants that time-dependent errors affect the exposure estimates with implications for the committee's modeling. Hopke commented that there is ample qualitative information on errors, but it is not clear what should be done quantitatively. Brenner indicated that the uncertainty appears to be more of a problem in the small mines. Can mine size be incorporated on the basis of the total number of miners? Gilbert mentioned that the committee may want to develop a questionnaire. Can we remove certain cohorts for which the uncertainty was largest? Can we rank cohorts? Can we obtain additional data? Chambers mentioned that the presence of other factors in the dust should be considered. Lubin mentioned that data on arsenic are available for the China and Ontario cohorts. The Swedish study has some information on silica and the Czech data have some additional information as well. Chambers mentioned that he had inquired about this issue (other contaminants) in the mines that he visited. Do higher levels of exposure to radon progeny entail higher exposures to other agents? Has there been consideration of parallel analyses of entire cohorts versus the group with exposure to uranium alone. Ziemer asked \"How consistent are the ore forms\"? There appears to be a difference from location to location. Bill Chenoweth has a report (PP-320) describing measurements made by the U.S. Geological Survey of trace metals in different mines. There are data available from Union Carbide in Grand Junction from retired ventilation engineers and state records (by engineers such as Vern Bishop, Bob Beverly, and Ben Kilgore). Umetro Minerals Corp. is now doing restoration. Lubin asked—How common was it that workers worked at their own mines on weekends and holidays? Hopke asked—What do we mean by \"other hardrock\"? Gold and silver mines were common, as opposed to vanadium (or copper mines). The Port Radium mine was reopened as a silver mine (Chambers). The participants were reminded that AMSA keeps records on other metals in mines (Nelson).\n\nWhat fraction of mines used diesel? Jim Cleveland answered that Kerr-McGee was almost all electric until the last few years; United Nuclear was mostly diesel. The Ambrosia Lake mines were mostly diesel. Was the use of diesel always accompanied by better ventilation? Yes. Good ventilation was needed for the diesel. Diesel was used in the '60's. Typically the miners blasted at noon and at 8:00 pm. They could not leave the lunchroom until 30 minutes after blasting. There was no diesel used until 1958 on the Colorado Plateau. By 1971, diesel use was as much as 90% and reached 100% by 1980. What were other sources of\n\nAppendix F\n\nExposures Other Than Radon in Underground Mines\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nUnderground miners are exposed to a number of agents, in addition to radon progeny which may adversely affect the lung. Several of these agents are known or suspect carcinogens (arsenic, diesel exhaust, and silica), and some may cause airways inflammation (blasting fumes and diesel exhaust). Silica exposure causes silicosis and several investigations have assessed modification of the effect of radon progeny by the presence of this fibrotic disorder.\n\nThese exposures of miners, in addition to radon progeny, are a source of uncertainty in extending risk estimates based on the epidemiologic studies of miners to the general population. Inflammatory changes in the epithelium might non-specifically affect the risk of lung-cancer from radon progeny and the additional exposure to other carcinogens might alter the risk of radon progeny as well. These other exposures were considered in the BEIR IV report (NRC 1988) and subsequently in the radon dose panel report (NRC 1991).\n\nIn this appendix, we update the earlier reviews for exposure to arsenic, silica, and diesel exhaust. Information on exposures of the miners to the agents is limited and only a few studies provide human information on arsenic and silica. None of the studies have direct information on exposure to diesel exhaust. The limited data available on these exposures are summarized by cohort in appendix D. Use of diesel engines in U.S. mines is described in the workshop summary that is part of appendix E annex 2. The more general topic of interactions between agents is addressed in appendix C in considering the combined effect of cigarette smoking and radon.\n\nArsenic\n\nAlthough evidence in experimental animal studies of the carcinogenicity of arsenic is limited, there is substantial evidence that inorganic arsenic is a carcinogen in humans (Blot and Fraumeni 1994; IARC 1987). Neubauer (1947) reports that arsenic was suspect as being carcinogenic as early as 1879 as a result of high lung-cancer rates in German miners (Bates and others 1992; Furst 1983). The ingestion of arsenic in drinking water and in pharmaceuticals has been associated with a number of disease outcomes, such as liver angiosarcoma and meningioma, and cancers of the skin, bladder, kidney, and colon, as well as black-foot disease (IARC 1987). Studies have also clearly shown that inhaled arsenic (arsenic trioxide) is a human lung carcinogen (IARC 1987). The principal concern for this committee is the role of exposure to airborne arsenic in mine dusts as a primary risk factor for lung-cancer, and how its presence might affect the evaluation of the relationship between radon-progeny exposure and lung-cancer.\n\nOccupational studies have been the main source of data on the effects of exposure to arsenic and risk of lung-cancer. These studies have included workers manufacturing and using arsenical-containing pesticides (Hill and Faning 1948; Roth 1957; Ott and others 1974; Mabuchi and others 1985), smelter workers and underground miners (for summaries, see Blot and Fraumeni 1994 and IARC 1987). Although the majority of occupational studies of arsenic exposure have been conducted in smelter workers, an increased risk of lung-cancer with arsenic exposure has been observed in several studies of miner populations (Taylor and others 1989; Kusiak and others 1993; Xuan and others 1993; Enterline and others 1987; Simonato and others 1994). However, among the studies of miners, only the investigations of Chinese tin miners (Xuan and others 1993) and Ontario uranium miners (Kusiak and others 1993) have included a quantitative evaluation of arsenic and of the joint association of arsenic and radon-progeny exposure.\n\nAlthough studies have consistently shown an increasing risk of lung-cancer with greater cumulative exposure to arsenic, there have been few detailed analyses of the shape of the dose-response curve for arsenic exposure. The analysis by Enterline and others (1995) and a meta-analysis of published studies (Hertz-Picciotto and Smith 1993) suggested a curvilinear relationship with a decrease in the excess relative risk per unit exposure as exposure increases, that is, the exposure-response curve was concave from below. Analyses of the Ontario miners (Kusiak and others 1993) and Chinese miners (Lubin, communication to the committee) showed a similar concave relationship, even after adjustment for radon-progeny exposure.\n\nThe distribution of histological types of lung-cancer in arsenic-exposed populations has not been extensively studied. There have been several small investigations, with little consistency in their finding. Based on 25 cases, Newman and others (1976) reported a higher proportion of poorly differentiated epidemiod carcinoma, while Wichs and others (1981) studied 42 smelter workers and 42\n\nmatched controls and found an excess of adenocarcinomas. In contrast, in a larger study of 93 lung-cancer cases highly exposed to arsenic and 136 referent lung-cancer cases, Pershagen and others (1987) found no variation in the histological distribution of lung-cancer cases when data were classified by a measure of arsenic exposure. The distributions of histological type in underground miners have been reported, but are potentially confounded by smoking and radon-progeny exposure.\n\nMathematical models, based on the Armitage-Doll multistage theory for carcinogenesis (Armitage and Doll 1961), were applied to data on lung-cancer from two studies of copper-smelter workers in Tacoma (Mazumdar and others 1989) and in Montana (Brown and Chu 1983). Both analyses drew similar conclusions, namely, arsenic exposure acts primarily as a late-stage carcinogen, but that the possibility of an early-stage effect cannot be ruled out. However, one limitation of both analyses was the inability to directly incorporate cigarette-smoking into the modeling, a factor which is thought to act as both an early-and late-stage carcinogen.\n\nIn the miner pooled analysis by Lubin and others (1994a), adjustment for arsenic exposure reduced the ERR/WLM in the Chinese miners from 0.61% to 0.16%. Interpretation of the reductions is hampered by the high correlation coefficient, 0.48, between cumulative radon-progeny exposure and arsenic exposure among jointly exposed miners. This suggests that the best estimate of the ERR/WLM for the radon progeny exposure-lung-cancer relationship lies between 0.0061 and 0.0016. In the Ontario data, adjustment for arsenic exposure reduced the ERR/WLM from 0.0093 to 0.0084. The correlation coefficient between radon-progeny exposure and arsenic exposure was 0.02. After adjustment for arsenic exposure as a primary risk factor, the ERR/WLM did not vary significantly with level of arsenic exposure in either study (Lubin and others 1994a). This pattern is consistent with a multiplicative association between radon-progeny exposure and arsenic exposure. However, interpretation of these results is hampered by differences in definition of the arsenic-exposure measure, which was percent arsenic in rock multiplied by duration of exposure for the Ontario study and duration of arsenic exposures (mgm-3y) for the China study. The evidence appears to suggest a greater than additive (synergistic) association for the combined relative risks for cigarette use and airborne arsenic exposure (Hertz-Picciotto and others 1992). In miner populations, the joint association of the three factors, radon progeny, arsenic, and smoking, has not been evaluated.\n\nSilica\n\nSilica, a ubiquitous exposure in many types of underground mining, is of particular interest in that it not only causes silicosis but also has been identified as a suspect human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC 1987). In classifying crystalline silica as carcinogenic, IARC indicated\n\nthat evidence of silica was sufficient in animals while limited in humans. For a detailed review of silica and lung-cancer, see Goldsmith and Samet (1994). Abelson (1991) has identified silica in mines as one of the key factors contributing to uncertainty in the use of radon-associated lung-cancers for miners to estimate population risks for radon. Silica might modify the risk of radon directly as an additional carcinogenic exposure or indirectly by causing fibrosis and airways damage.\n\nWith regard to this possible indirect mechanism, there have been several studies on respiratory disease patients that suggest a significant association between obstructive lung function and lung-cancer (Davis 1976; Skillrud and others 1986; Tockman and others 1987). Similar findings have been reported for pneumoconiotic workers by Harber and others (1986) and by Carta and others (1991). Carta and others (1994) suggest that \"airways obstruction may be an independent risk factor for bronchogenic carcinoma.\" Accordingly, they studied the lung-cancer mortality in relation to airways obstruction among Sardinian metal miners exposed to silica and low levels of radon progeny. In one of the two mines studied, the quartz concentration in the respirable dust was between 0.2% and 2.0% while the radon exposures averaged 0.07 Jm-3 (0.13 WL) with the maximum cumulative exposure in the 0.28 to 0.42 Jhm-3 (80–120 WLM) range. In the second mine, the silica levels were much greater, ranging from 6.5% to 29%, while the radon levels were lower than in the first mine. The cohort included some 1,741 miners and a total of 25,842.5 person-years of exposure. Lung function tests, chest radiographs, and smoking histories were available for all subjects entering the cohort. A total of seventeen subjects from the first mine and seven from the second died of lung-cancer. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for lung-cancer was higher for the first mine. Furthermore, among miners with initial spirometric airways obstruction, those in the first mine showed the highest risk. Carta and others concluded that crystalline silica as such does not affect lung-cancer mortality. They further suggest that impaired pulmonary function may be an independent predictor of lung-cancer and may be an important risk factor because of enhancement of residence times for inhaled carcinogens.\n\nAn important investigation that considered silica dust and silicosis as risk factors for lung-cancer in underground miners was reported by Radford and St. Clair Renard (1984). They conducted a case-control study of silicosis in Swedish iron miners involving 50 lung-cancer cases in deceased miners and 100 controls matched on age, year mining began, and duration of time mining. Both the severity of silicosis and the frequency of radiographic evidence of silicosis were comparable for the cases and the controls, indicating no effect of this disease on lung-cancer risk.\n\nEpidemiological evidence of increased lung-cancer risk in silicotic patients has been reported by Koskela and others (1990) as well as by Chiyotani and others (1990) and Merlo and others (1990). However, there have been a number of studies that present conflicting results on lung-cancer risks for workers with\n\nand without silicosis exposed to dust that contained silica. These studies include: Hessel and others (1990), Meijers and others (1990), Ng and others (1990), Ahlman and others (1991), Amandus and Costello (1991), Carta and others (1991), Chen and others (1991), Chia and others (1991), Hnizdo and Sluis-Cremer (1991), Kusiak and others (1991), and McLaughlin and others (1992). Generally these studies demonstrate no clear dose-response relationship for silica exposure even though an overall association between lung-cancer and the presence of silicosis was observed in some of the studies.\n\nSamet and coworkers (1994) conducted a case-control study in the cohort of underground uranium miners in New Mexico to assess the presence of radiographic silicosis as a risk factor for lung-cancer. This is one of the cohorts included in the pooled data set. The presence of silicosis as determined by chest radiographs taken at or near the beginning of employment was determined for 65 lung-cancer cases and 216 controls. Data on the individual exposures to silica were not available, but there are data available that demonstrate the presence of silica in mines in the region of the study. Also, silicosis is well documented in underground uranium miners in the southwestern states. The study showed that the presence of silicosis was not associated with lung-cancer risk after adjustment was made for cumulative exposure to radon. These investigators recognized that the findings were limited by the small number of subjects, but they were able to conclude nonetheless that there was a lack of association of silicosis with lung-cancer. They stated that \"silica exposure should not be regarded as a major uncertainty in extrapolating radon risk estimates from miners to the general population.\"\n\nFinkelstein (1995) examined the presence of radiographic silicosis as a lung-cancer risk-factor in miners from the Ontario Silicosis Surveillance Database. In contrast to the findings of Samet and others (1994), he found that silicosis was a highly significant risk factor for lung-cancer. Accordingly, he concluded that the radon lung-cancer risk decreased if an adjustment for the presence of silicosis was made. However, Archer (1996) has criticized Finkelstein's conclusion on the basis that early lung-cancer is very difficult to discern from radiographs of individuals whose lungs contain fibrotic abnormalities. Archer states that it is likely that at the time they were admitted into the study the silicotics in Finkelstein's cohort had more undetected cancers than did the controls. Archer also criticized Finkelstein's assumption that radon exposures for the nonuranium miners was zero.\n\nRecently, Enderle and Friedrich (1995) published a review of the exposure conditions and the health consequences for the East German uranium miners in the Saxony and Thuringia regions. They point out that in the 1946 to 1955 period working conditions were extremely poor and the miners were exposed not only to radon progeny, but also to very high dust levels, and to toxic chemicals or elements including arsenic and crystalline silica. They offer no direct evidence relating silica and lung-cancer for these miners, but they do cite a study by Melhorn (1992) that reports a high rate of bronchial carcinoma occurring in\n\nminers with known silicosis. They also cite the work by Tockman and Samet (1994) who describe silicosis as a risk factor for lung-cancer.\n\nGoldsmith and coworkers (1995) have also shown that, in addition to having increased mortality from nonmalignant respiratory diseases and from tuberculosis, silicotics have a significantly elevated risk of death from cancers of the trachea, bronchus, and lung.\n\nDiesel Engine Exhaust and Fumes\n\nExposure to diesel is also relevant to extrapolation of risks from miners to the population. Some uranium-mining operations used diesel engine-powered equipment resulting in the exposure of miners to diesel exhaust. As will be discussed below, the diesel soot particles are readily respirable. They are carbonaceous particles and have associated hydrocarbons some of which are mutagenic and also carcinogenic. This raises the potential for the diesel soot to be carcinogenic, and further raises the possibility that diesel exhaust may induce lung-cancer. In turn, this raises the possibility for diesel exhaust to be a confounding factor in evaluating the lung-cancer risks of exposure to radon.\n\nIn this section, the evidence is reviewed for diesel exhaust causing lung-cancer. This is followed by a discussion of the possible role of diesel exhaust as a causative factor in lung-cancers observed in uranium miners.\n\nThe diesel engine, patented by Rudolph Diesel in 1892, has found wide use in commerce, including use in mining operations and in railroad locomotives. The dieselization of railroads occurred principally after World War II, reached its midpoint in 1952, and by 1959, approximately 95% of the locomotives in the United States were diesel powered (U.S. Department of Labor 1972).\n\nConcern for health effects of exposure to diesel exhaust has existed for some time. This concern relates to the readily inhalable size of diesel soot particles, 0.1 to 0.5 µ (Cheng and others 1984), giving concern for the development of lung-cancer. This concern is heightened by an awareness that a significant portion, typically 10 to 15%, of the diesel soot particles by weight consist of organic compounds readily extractable by organic solvents (Johnson 1988). The extracted material includes many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including many that are mutagenic and some that are carcinogenic (Schuetzle and Jensen 1985; Schuetzle and Lewtas 1986). Kotin and others (1955) demonstrated that organic solvent extracts of diesel soot were carcinogenic when painted on mouse skin.\n\nThe prospect for increased use of diesel engines in light-duty vehicles in the late 1970s increased concern for the cancer risks of inhalation exposure to diesel soot. This concern stimulated the conduct of epidemiological investigations, bioassays in laboratory animals, and a wide range of mechanistic studies at all levels of biological organization from cells to populations of mammals.\n\nThe epidemiological studies have been recently reviewed by Cohen and Higgins (1995) and Nauss and others (1995) in a special report prepared by the\n\nHealth Effects Institute (1995). Two figures from that report provide a summary of the currently available data on lung-cancer risks evaluated in railroad workers (Figure F-1), and truck drivers (Figure F-2). From these figures, it is clear that the relative risk of lung-cancer measured in the various studies is only elevated significantly if at all in a few studies. A major confounder in these studies, as is usually the case, is cigarette-smoking which is a dominant causative factor in lung-cancer. This is illustrated by considering Table F-1 taken from Garshick and others (1987). The slightly elevated lung-cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.41, 95% CE = 1.06, 1.88) contrasts sharply with the substantial risk measured for cigarette-smoking. Cigarette-smoking risk increased with amount of cigarette smoking and age to an odds ratio of 9.14, 59% CE = 6.11, 13.70 for cases age greater than 65 years and >50 pack-years of cigarette smoking. Crump and others (1991) reanalyzed the data used by Garshick and others (1987) as well as additional data on the same population and was unable to discern an exposure-related increase in lung-cancer risk.\n\nIn the late 1980s, results of a number of well-conducted laboratory animal bioassays of diesel exhaust became available. These results have been extensively reviewed (Mauderly 1992; Health Effects Institute 1995; McClellan 1987). The results, summarized in Figure F-3 taken from the HEI report (1995), clearly indicate that long-term high-level exposure to diesel exhaust increases an excess of lung-cancer in rats. Mice and Syrian hamsters similarly exposed have yielded negative or equivocal results. An excellent example of this contrasting result is apparent from the studies of rats (increased lung-cancer) and mice (no increase in\n\nThe recent cancer results from rats exposed to diesel exhaust raises questions as to the appropriateness of their use for defining the carcinogenic risk of diesel exhaust to humans (McClellan 1996). Thus, the human lung-cancer risk of diesel exhaust exposure should be based exclusively on the epidemiological data reviewed earlier.\n\nWith the above information as background, the potential interaction between radon and diesel exhaust can be considered. In the absence of either epidemiological studies of radon-exposed individuals that have included characterization of diesel exhaust exposure as a confounder or laboratory animal studies with controlled exposure to radon and diesel exhaust, it is only possible to speculate on the potential combined effects of radon and diesel exhaust. Some insight may be gained by considering the data in Table F-1 from the study of railroad workers exposed to diesel exhaust. The results of this study can be interpreted as identifying diesel exhaust as a potential low-potency carcinogen. The characterization of diesel exhaust as a low-potency carcinogen is made with reference to cigarette-smoking that was substantially more potent than diesel exhaust depending on the extent of smoking. It is unlikely that the uranium miners had smoking histories substantially different from the railroad workers. Compared to diesel exhaust, radon exposure may also be classed as a high-potency risk factor. It can be argued that in an exposure environment involving the two high-potency risk factors, radon and cigarette-smoking, the addition of a low-potency risk factor, diesel exhaust, would be unlikely to affect the combined risk from the two high-potency risk factors.\n\nMuscat and Wynder (1995) conducted a case-control study to determine the effects of exposure to diesel engine exhaust and fumes. The subjects were truck drivers, mine workers, firefighters, and railroad workers, and included 235 male hospital patients with laryngeal cancer. These investigators showed that diesel engine exhaust is unrelated to laryngeal cancer risk. They offered no suggestion that lung-cancer would be directly related to diesel fume exposures.\n\nMycotoxins\n\nRecently there has been speculation about the possible role of mycotoxins in the production of lung-cancers. In a letter to the editor of Lancet, Venitt and Biggs (1994) suggested that exposure of uranium miners to mycotoxins such as sterigmatocystin could account for the mutations in p53 at codon 249 that had been reported by Taylor and coworkers (1994). Taylor and others had suggested that the codon 249 mutation may be a marker for radon-induced lung-cancer, but Venitt and Biggs point out that the gross damage caused by a particles would be expected to produce gross damage to the DNA rather than a precise mutation at a specific codon. Likewise, Hei and others (1994b) suggest that although a point mutation could be induced by a particles, complete loss of the p53 gene would be more likely. Bartsch and others (1995) also assert that a radon-induced hotspot\n\nmutation would be surprising since one would expect mainly random DNA strand breaks. They screened for the presence of the codon 249 mutation in lung-cancers from the Saxony, Germany uranium miners and found that none of the 50 lung tumors analyzed showed the hotspot mutation. Lo and others (1995) also raised the possibility that the results found by Taylor and colleagues could be related to mycotoxins.\n\nHypotheses concerning a possible role of mycotoxins are presently speculative and not supported by any observation data. Information on exposures is completely lacking.\n\nSram and coworkers (1993) have reported that Czech uranium miners are exposed to chemical mutagens as well as radon. They found molds in throat swabs from 27% of the miners studied as compared to only 5% in controls. Various mycotoxins were found in the swabs, including sterigmatocystin, a bisfuranoid mycotoxin that is structurally related to aflatoxins. Sterigmatocystin is reported by Gopalakrishnan and others (1992) to be a potent carcinogen and mutagen that produces squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas in animal lungs.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nExposures other than radon progeny sustained by underground miners could plausibly modify the lung-cancer risk associated with exposure to radon progeny. The relevant data for assessing such modification in the miner cohorts are scant. Uncontrolled arsenic exposure may be a source of positive bias, as shown for example in the Chinese tin miners. The role of silica has not been directly assessed; the scant epidemiologic evidence indicates that the presence of silicosis is not a strong modification of the risk of radon. Diesel exhaust, present in some of the more recent miners, was also probably not a strong modifier of the risk of radon progeny.\n\nAppendix G\n\nEpidemiologic Studies in the Indoor Environment\n\nThis appendix examines the epidemiologic evidence of an association between indoor radon-progeny exposure and lung-cancer. Although data from indoor-radon studies are not yet sufficient to develop a general risk-assessment model or to estimate precisely the magnitude of risk posed by radon in houses, the data do support a small increase in lung-cancer risk due to indoor radon exposure and are consistent both with the extrapolation of lung-cancer risk using miner-based models and with relative risks among miners with cumulative exposures similar to exposures that might be experienced by long-term residents in houses that exceed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) action level. However, there are sufficient uncertainties in current epidemiologic studies that the residential data alone do not conclusively support a definable excess lung-cancer risk associated with radon-progeny exposure.\n\nEcologic studies and analytic case-control studies are the 2 types of epidemiologic studies that have considered the issue. In an ecologic study, regional rates of lung-cancer are related to a measure of regional radon concentration. The measures of radon concentration are regional mean radon concentrations obtained from direct measurement in a small number of houses and purported correlates of indoor-radon concentration, such as geologic formations and housing characteristics. In an analytic case-control study, data are obtained directly from lung-cancer cases and controls, or their surrogates, through personal interviews. Radon-progeny exposure is estimated for each person and is based on either direct data from indoor-radon measurement or surrogate measures, such as housing type.\n\nThe committee concludes that only analytic case-control studies that rely on\n\ndirect measurement of radon in houses are useful for evaluating the risk of lung-cancer posed by indoor-radon exposure. In contrast, because of the inability to control for confounding at the level of the individual, limitations in the use of a few radon measurements to represent exposures for an entire region, and the large risk associated with cigarette-smoking (an excess lung-cancer risk of 1,000–2,000%, with an estimated 20–30% for indoor radon-progeny exposure), the committee believes that ecologic studies of indoor-radon exposure and lung-cancer are essentially noninformative and shed little light on the association of indoor radon-progeny exposure and lung-cancer.\n\nIn this appendix, we review the sources of exposure to radon progeny in the general population and the epidemiologic studies of indoor exposure, and we consider the results of the epidemiologic studies and their design limitations.\n\nSOURCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADON EXPOSURE AMONG NONMINERS\n\nThe principal source of radon-progeny exposure in buildings is emanation from soil and rock below ground. In a few special situations, well water or building materials can contribute substantially but they make relatively small contributions to the overall dose (NCRP 1984).\n\nThe most-complete survey of radon concentrations in U.S. dwellings, the National Residential Radon Study (NRRS), was performed by EPA in 125 counties in 50 states (Marcinowski and others 1994). The arithmetic mean radon concentration was 46.3 Bqm-3 (geometric standard deviation, 3.11); the EPA action level is 148 Bqm-3. Figure 1–4 from Marcinowski and others (1994) shows that single-family homes have a slightly higher radon concentration (arithmetic mean 54.0 Bqm-3; geometric standard deviation, 2.97) than all dwellings, whereas multi-family units (defined as attached single-family dwellings, townhouses, apartments, duplexes, and condominiums) have a markedly lower mean radon concentration (arithmetic mean, 24.1 Bqm-3; geometric standard deviation, 3.23). In the survey, 6.1% of houses exceeded the EPA action level; this confirms earlier estimates, which were based on smaller studies compiled by Nero and others (1986), but it is much lower than estimates from commercial test vendors of 19% (Cohen and others 1984; Cohen and Gromicko 1988) and 23% (Alter and Oswald 1987). Presumably, the latter higher estimates result from a selection bias of homeowners who suspect they have a radon problem and not from biased measurement. Also in agreement with the earlier findings of Nero and others (1986), the NRRS found that the distribution of radon concentrations in residences could be satisfactorily represented by a lognormal distribution.\n\nThe NRRS also confirmed earlier studies that indicated that basements have higher average radon concentrations than higher floors. Their data showed that average radon concentrations in first-floor rooms were about 40% of those in basements, average second-floor room concentrations were about 90% of those\n\nof first floors, and average third-floor or higher room concentrations were about 84% of those of second floors.\n\nThere is no evidence that average radon concentrations in U.S. dwellings are significantly different from those in other nontropical countries. The most-comprehensive international survey was compiled in the 1988 UN Scientific Committee on Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) report (UNSCEAR 1988), which analyzed worldwide radon surveys. The population-weighted arithmetic mean in temperate and high-latitude countries was estimated to be about 50 Bqm-3, which was combined with a \"guesstimate\" of about 20 Bqm-3 in tropical countries to yield a worldwide population-weighted arithmetic mean of about 40 Bqm-3.\n\nWithin a given dwelling or building, the radon concentration is determined essentially by the ratio (Scott 1992) of the average radon concentration in soil gas near foundation openings (Csoil) to the airflow resistance of soil around the house foundation (Isoil). That ratio is often called the soil-radon potential (SRP), and much effort has been devoted to its characterization. Csoil depends on depth, soil radium concentration, and water content (Rogers and Nielson 1991), and it is not well correlated with radium or uranium concentrations in the underlying bedrock (the poor correlation makes SRP predictions based on gross geologic considerations rather inaccurate). Isoil depends essentially on the basement dimensions and the soil permeability to air, which varies widely from 10 to 18 m2 for well-graded gravel, from 10 to 11 m2 for sand and gravel, and from 10 to 15 m2 for clay (Tanner 1990).\n\nThe various methods that have been used for estimating SRP have been reviewed by Yokel (1989). However, as the number of screening measurements of radon concentrations in homes has increased dramatically in the last decade, the need for predictive methods has correspondingly decreased, and radon-prone areas can be identified simply by analyzing the home measurements (Scott 1992, 1993). For example, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP 1993) has proposed that areas in which more than 1% of buildings have radon concentrations that are more than 10 times the national average might be designated as radon-prone.\n\nIn contrast with earlier expectations (for example, Rundo and others 1979; Cohen and Gromicko 1988), it now appears that house design and weatherproofing (both determinants of the rate of exchange of indoor with outdoor air) are not strong determinants of domestic radon concentration. For example, in a study of 2,000 British homes, Gunby and others (1993) found that house design, building-material type, and amount of weatherproofing together accounted for less than 5% of the observed variation in radon concentration; the implication is that, on the average, SRP is the dominant determinant.\n\nThe occupancy factor of schools and workplaces is about 2/7 that of homes (ICRP 1993). Thus, radon in schools and workplaces is likely to be an important contributor to the overall dose. ICRP (1993) has suggested that action levels in these buildings should be the reciprocal of that fraction, or 7/2, as high as in\n\ndwellings (and should be weighted by the relevant dose-conversion coefficients, if applicable), but this suggestion has not been implemented.\n\nRelatively few studies of radon concentrations in the workplace have been undertaken (Cohen and others 1984; Saccomanno and others 1986; Turk and others 1986; Westin and others 1991). In general, concentrations have been lower than those in loca"
