        "text": "Project Inventory\n\nArranged by Author\n\nOverview\n\nAfter years of playing around with \"splash pages\" and \"sub-sites,\" we have come to the conclusion that we have no talent for them, but that it doesn't matter — hardly anyone visited them. Almost everyone came to the site from one or another of the search engines. And that's the way it should be. The project originated as a \"document repository,\" the search engines provide the best and easiest access to the materials stored here. So now, the site-map cum inventory serves as the Mead Project's \"default\" page.\n\nThe site has grown considerably since the last update. Unfortunately, that growth means that the inventory file is large (over 400 kb) and takes a long time to load. We apologize for the inconvenience but couldn't bring ourselves to split the inventory into subsections.\n\nThe growth in the collection reflects the changes in our research interests over the past two years. Originally, we had tried to limit \"editorial license\" by trying to capture everything (even the most trivial book review) from a writer. That was practical when we restricted our focus to Mead. Then we broadened our focus to the \"Meadians.\" We are striving to be exhaustive for Floyd Allport, L. L. Bernard, Herbert Blumer, Emory S. Bogardus, Ellsworth Faris, Jacob Kantor, W. I. Thomas, Louis Thurstone and Kimball Young as well as the Sherifs (whose worked outside of the \"Chicago Network\" but in the Meadian tradition). That will take more time.\n\nIntegrating these these areas has meant that we have had to add the occasional paper from several other writers, and stories from magazines and newspapers ranging from Philanthropy and Social Hygiene to entries from The Book of Chicagoans and the Knoxville Journal and Tribune. Deciding which documents to include requires more than a little editorial license, so bear with us. If you have suggestions, drop us a line -- or better yet -- send the file.\n\nFinally, the recent reworking of the website uncovered countless errors in formatting. The majority reflect changes in the HTML over time (small things have changed over a decade). At just shy of four thousand files (dozens coded before html editors were available) keeping them in shape isn't easy. Please report what you suspect are errors when you run across them.\n\nTheodore Abel.\n\n\"Review of The Polish Peasant in Europe and America by Theodore Abel.\" American Journal of Psychology, 41 (1929): 665-666.\n\nEdith Abbott and Sophonisba Preston Breckinridge\n\nThe Delinquent Child and the Home.
