        "text": "“All of us must be continually impressed with the awe-inspiring first sight of Rochester as we arrive at the top of the hill and start the downgrade ride into the village. So it is with the many visitors and travelers who have occasion to use this highway. After covering miles of city traffic, the traveler rides over flat country without realizing he is going up grade, until suddenly he views “The Heart of the Hills” and gets his heart-throb.”\n\n--Earl Seed, June 2, 1949\n\n\"History, in brief, is an analysis of the past in order that we may understand the present and guide our conduct into the future.\"\n\n--Sidney E. Mead\n\n\"History is where the evidence leads us; heritage is what we choose to remember and celebrate.\"\n\n--Edward T. Lilenthal\n\n\"A generation which ignores history has no past and no future.\"\n\n--Robert A. Heinlein\n\n\"History repeats itself because nobody was listening the first time.\"\n\n--Anon.\n\n\"We do not choose between the past and the future; they are inseparable parts of the same river.\"\n\n--Dr. Walter Havighurst"
