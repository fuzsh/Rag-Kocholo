If the new Bob Hope picture, "The Paleface," goes down in the history books as a memorable item of culture in 1948, it will not be because it stands forth as a triumph in comic art. Even with Mr. Hope in it, having great fun pretending to be an itinerant, chicken-livered dentist out in the perilous "Indian country" of the old Wild West, this new picture at the Paramount is just a second-string "Road" show, at best, conspicuously lacking the presence of Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour.Neither is it worthy of historical note because of the fact that it generously offers Jane Russell, star of "The Outlaw," a chance to reform. Miss Russell, while blessed by nature with certain well-advertised charms, appears to be lacking completely a modest ability to act. And although that is not very serious, so far as fan favor is concerned, it does limit somewhat the deference which Miss Russell might hope to command.No, this whoop-de-do gag-fest about a mouse who becomes a big bold man by virtue of having his shootin' done for him (surreptitiously) by Calamity Jane, is just another amusing run-through of well-worn slapstick routines by a boy who has bunions on his bunions from the number of times he's run the course. The words are slightly different, but the thoughts remain the same. It's not the Indians that Mr. Hope's afraid of; it's their unfriendly attitude. And there's nothing theatrically significant about a film in which such is the point.The historic thing about "The Paleface" is that in it is tucked away, as though it were a thing of no consequence, the sensational "Buttons and Bows." This song, which, our seasoned sources tell us, is now the all-time all-time hit, is brushed off in one casual chorus by—of all people!—Mr. Hope. Twiddling a concertina and comically mouthing the words, Mr. Hope tosses off the number and indifferently leaves it lie. Nobody picks it up later. That's all they originally thought of it when "The Paleface" was put together more than a year ago.The great things in human progress—and in art—usually happen this way. "The Paleface" deserves primarily a marker as the birthplace of "Buttons and Bows."On the stage at the Paramount are Benny Goodman and his orchestra, plus Buddy Lester and the Peiro Brothers.
