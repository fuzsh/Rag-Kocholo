        "text": "This article is about the antagonist of the 2017 reboot. For current canon designated to Sonic Legacy, see \"Sonic\" (Sonic Legacy). For the character pre-reboot, see X (original).\n\n“ Liar, liar....PANTS ON FIRE. „ ― X\n\nX, better known as Sonic.eXe, is the main antagonist of the oldest official reboot of the original Sonic.exe creepypasta created by JCTheHyena. A extraterrestrial entity who grew obsessed with humanity, X uses a modified version of a Sonic game to lure, horrify, and eventually steal the souls of the players who dare to play with the game. With the aid of his cult, people who see this entity as god, he proceeds to get whoever he wants, and does not seem to have any level of morals that a human would understand. As of present day, he is now owned by Raven and is now bound to appear in Sonic Legacy.\n\nPersonality\n\nHis personality is quite the same as the original version; being a sadistic and playful creature that derives pleasure from tormenting its victims. However, it possesses the personality of an insane and selfish child, wielding immense power and believing it exists to dominate humanity. In this version, X is an all-powerful creature made of dark matter from its own world, intent on enslaving all of humanity, and it will relentlessly pursue this goal until it has crossed over and taken possession of every human soul.\n\nThe Tale\n\nThis is an unofficial summary of the story. If you'd like to read the full, unaltered story, click here.\n\nNo one really knows where X came from, but it is speculated that he came from the void, an ancient place between worlds that no one can understand. It is unknown when exactly X came across Earth, but he was fascinated with it and its people ever since he arrived. Having found a group of people known as the Cult of X, seemingly led by a woman named Shannon Goldman, X created a trojan horse virus disguised as a game that served as gateways into Earth. The game was distributed to around 5-6 people to take their souls, one of these being a college student by the name of Kyle Scott.\n\nEnter Thomas Miller, Kyle's best friend ever since high school. Concerned over Kyle's sudden disappearance, Tom tried to get into Kyle's dorm room, only to find it locked with no answer.\n\nHowever, just as he returned to his room, Tom discovered that a package had been placed at his door with a lengthy, almost frantic letter left by Kyle, explaining that he was hooked on a mysterious game. The contents of the package only contained a single CD-ROM, unopened, unlabeled, and remarkably clean for something that should have been used before. Frustrated and confused, Tom left the package alone.\n\nThe next day, local detectives Derek and Sarah Green arrived, interrogating locals about the death of Kyle, with Tom being someone of interest due to his friendship with Kyle. Explaining that there were numerous incidents where people's computers were damaged, jaws stretched out, and chests ruptured internally, alongside other side effects, Derek explains that Kyle was just the latest in a string of deaths. Unfortunately, Tom's recounting of Kyle being obsessed with a game provided no new info, but Tom was given Derek's number, in case of any emergency.\n\nAround a week later, Kyle's room had been cleared out, with Tom obtaining Kyle's old laptop as a result. Wanting answers, Tom charged up the laptop and installed the CD-ROM, revealing its contents to be a video game known as \"Sonic.eXe\". Cautiously, Tom opened the game.\n\nUpon starting up the game, a strange voice was heard from the computer, asking Tom if he wants to play a game. Agreeing, the game forces Tom to pick a character, with the student choosing his favorite, Silver the Hedgehog. Upon selecting, the voice announces that Tom would be playing a game of hide-and-seek, with Tom playing the role of... Tails?\n\nTails was placed in a desolate city, its inhabitants having left long ago as the sky stays in a clouded dawn. The world was silent as Tails ventured through the 3D void, searching for any semblance of a game to be seen.\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time searching, Tails eventually stumbled across... Sonic, or rather, a false Sonic with an incomplete disguise. Pale to the very lips with no sign of clothing on his person, this impostor turned to the screen, forcing Tails to try to hide anywhere to keep the game going and stay alive. Finding a nearby hotel, Tom had Tails enter, in hopes that Sonic wouldn't find him.\n\nHowever, the moment he stepped in the doors of the building, Tails was sent into a dark, burning forest. Finding the head of a strange Sonic doll attached to a black tendril, Tom tries to move in to examine it, only for Tails to react, aggressively shaking his head in response to the doll's words. Aggravated, barbed wires shot out from the ground, digging into Tails' neck before dragging him into the flames, killing the poor boy. Chalking all of this up to being a fangame by someone who hated Sonic, Tom shut off the laptop.\n\nThe next day, Diana Wilkinson, one of the college's English teachers, was found dead in her own classroom, with her body reported by the cheerleader Rachel Falkner. Ms. Wilkinson was reported to have suffered the same fate as Kyle, her jaw dislocated. With little idea as to what to do, Tom called Derek in order to get him on the case.\n\nWith a newfound sense of responsibility after Derek let him on the case, Tom and his friends (Roger, Mike, and Vicky) headed to the Anime Club in order to use one of their projectors so the four of them could see the game.\n\nGreeting Tom again, the voice in the game left the group to their own devices and explore the world as Sally, primarily so the next game can be set up. Left in a hallway with many doors, Sally enters one, only to find a version of Fiona Fox, half-naked, hung up by strings, and covered in autopsy stitches. Fiona cries for help before Sally leaves the fox to suffer, exiting to the same city that Tails was once in. The false Sonic reappears, his eyes covering the screen with his hideous, cracked, and inhuman face, smiling wide as he cackles, reaching out from the projector and into the human world to take the quartet. Quickly thinking, Tom shuts down the projector, cutting off his access to the world.\n\nAs Tom takes to studying the possibility of creatures beyond humanity's plane of understanding, three more bodies were discovered the very next day, two students and a teacher. Meeting with Derek again, Tom learns of the Cult of X, a cult who was known for having killed a number of people prior to the recent killings. Tom starts forming a connection between the cult's name and the iconography of the game, seemingly believing that they are the ones behind the murders. However, before he can act on this theory, Vicky's friend, Alana, had gone missing. With little left to do, and with the battery of Tom's laptop running dry, the four head to the computer lab to find Alana.\n\nHowever, instead of finding a human, the four instead find something much worse. Lanky, pale, grinning madly with an X scarred upon his chest, the Sonic had broken into real life, his body barely resembling a living creature and more akin to a misshaped costume. Tom tries to confront the beast, only for him to reveal that he had not been killing anyone, instead leaving their souls alive to toy with.\n\nAs the batteries of the computers around him drain, Tom notices the body of a human girl in his clutches, dangling by her arm and struggling to break free.\n\nIt was Alana.\n\nExclaiming that he wants to complete his little \"collection\", the false Sonic explains his motives. His boredom had become curbed when he came across humanity, with Tom being a source of satisfaction from his misguided attempts to save everyone.\n\nDeciding to show the four what he does to humans, Sonic's head gets pulled back, revealing dozens of shadowy hands spilling out from its maw, forcing their way into Alana's throat before finally relenting, throwing her limp body onto the ground.\n\nSonic grabs a glowing blue orb, the very culmination of a soul, from what is left of Alana, before absorbing it into his own body. Turning his attention to Tom and his friends, the students immediately flee.\n\nTrying to reach the intercom in order to warn everyone, the group's efforts are in vain as someone, presumably Sonic, had already barricaded all the doors leaving campus, trapping everyone inside. No matter how much everyone tried to claw and break through the boards, the wood seemed to hold despite its damage, almost unnaturally so. Calling for help was not an option either, with access to the outside world completely cut off. There was no escaping.\n\nThe four find the head of a Sonic doll dangling from the ceiling, a mouthpiece of the monster. While Tom demands an explanation, all he gains is that the Cult of X were, indeed, all under the control of Sonic, or as they know him, \"X\". Growing impatient with the group, the doll tries to kill Vicky, only for Mike to push her out of the way, taking his soul instead.\n\nRunning out, the three remaining members of the group enter the cafeteria, only to find that X had been picking off students one by one, their bodies laid across the campus as their screams echo the halls. The three try to hide away in the food storage, only for the doors to slam shut on Vicky, subjecting her to X's torment. The two stay, shut the door, and try to hold on for as long as they can.\n\nTom manages to survive the night, seeing the morning sun, but Roger's soul has been taken, his body pale as blood drips down from his mouth. Awakening to the sound of his phone ringing, Tom opens up to find that Derek Green had been calling for ages, with the wifi only coming back on recently. Tom begs for Derek to save him, with the latter promising to arrive as soon as he can.\n\nHowever, Tom was left alone, his friends all in the hands of the monster, and unable to save a single one. Hateful towards himself and the monster that stole everything from him, Tom smashed his own laptop, hoping that it would cut off X's connection to the world. Sobbing, Tom tries to rest, only to be met with a new noise.\n\nKyle's laptop had been completely restored.\n\nWithin the laptop, there was another Sonic character, a rusty-red Knuckles with green eyes.\n\nIt was Kyle.\n\nKyle, aware of everything that happened ever since he got the game, apologizes to his friend. However, the reunion is cut short as Kyle is taken once more, the screen of the laptop replaced with something new.\n\nAn endless hallway, its floor checkered as its purple walls were lined with torches and red curtains. Piano started playing as a grizzly sight appeared once more. A strange, pale face appeared in the darkness, face smiling wide as two red pinprick eyes appeared to illuminate what little of the face was visible.\n\nX had returned.\n\nWith little options left as the last person alive on campus, Tom found a knife in the kitchen before pointing it at the beast, who had now returned to Earth. However, as the being points out, there is no way that Tom could really kill him with just a simple knife. With quick thinking, Tom musters up the courage to try to act upon the only possible chance to escape.\n\nTom brought the knife to his own neck, resulting in X exploding with anger. X tries to talk him out of it, reasoning that since a soul cannot die, whatever Tom was about to try was going to leave his friends to X's mercy, leaving Tom separated for the rest of his potential afterlife. However, with little hesitation, Tom plunges the knife into his own throat, killing himself in the process.\n\nHowever, right before his soul could escape, X grabbed Tom's soul, winning his little \"game\". Placing his body on a chair, the monster returned to his world, with so many new playthings to use at his own disposal.\n\nDerek and his gang had arrived far too late to save anyone. Guilt weighing heavily on Derek, he had taken to drinking as he was left in a depressive slump. However, with the discovery of the letter by Sarah, Derek had gained a newfound vigor to set things right and hopefully stop the monster who had been doing this once and for all.\n\nHowever, with X and his cult still on the loose and a strange man keeping tabs on the duo of cops, it seems that Derek and Sarah may be marching onwards to their deaths.\n\nTrivia\n\nThis version represents an official reboot of Sonic.exe, crafted by its creator JC the Hyena, who drew inspiration from the works of H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, particularly the character IT/Pennywise.\n\nThe purpose behind this reboot may have been to offer a more realistic interpretation of the original creepypasta.\n\nUnlike what is written on most wikis, this X never stopped being the canon one UNTIL JC lost the rights of Sonic.exe. Hell, JC considered this version the \"definitive X\" and even went out of his way to refer to him as \"X Prime\".\n\nIronically enough, this version of the character was even more hated than the original, due to its design and a few certain bizarre writing choices.\n\nHis faker form nor the doll head were never officially drawn by JC. The drawing present on this page is a fanmade recreation based on the description given in the story.\n\nInterestingly enough, the design for X described on the story itself is completely different to the one actually drawn by JC. Therefore, a recreation has been made showing what this design looks like.\n\n2017 X was the main inspiration for EXE, whose creator now owns this variant of the character. This can be seen when comparing the two’s faker forms. Hell, even Raven herself went out of her way to state this.\n\nWhile X may not explicitly proclaim \"I AM GOD\" in his rendition of the pasta, his delusional belief in his divinity is unmistakable.\n\nX's appearance draws parallels to Sonic's Werehog form from the video game Sonic Unleashed.\n\nIn this remake, The Cult of X addresses X as \"Lord X\", an alias later adopted by the character in the Sonic PC PORT game created by JoeDoughBoi.\n\nSimilar to the original version, X remains a devoted Sonic fan.\n\nJust like how the original was rebooted and replaced with 2011 X, he is currently being remade by Joey and Raven as seen in this post.\n\nThis reboot is currently not the priority of Raven, hence the current canon being loosely represented in Sonic Legacy.\n\nNotably, this serves as the first reboot of the original X, with a subsequent reboot known as \"Xenophanes.\"\n\nIn August 2021, JC was exposed for abusive and predatory behaviour towards minors alongside his ex-girlfriend, Shannon Love/srloctober23, whom he had emotionally abused and conditioned into believing his behaviour was acceptable. After the exposure, both left their respective communities, relinquishing ownership of Sonic.exe, after it being given to srloctober23 after JC's initial exposure, to Shei/Deadmaster1317, and JoeDoughBoi, creator of Lord X and Soulless Sonic.\n\nGallery\n\nPasta\n\nSonic.exe - THE REMAKE\n\nNavigation"
