        "text": "This essay argues that the literary materials grouped together in the early 1960s under the rubric of “black humor” frequently attended thematically to acts of interracial identification. In addition to examining critically the impulses motivating persons to engage in such imitative procedures, the prose fictions of Terry Southern, Richard Fariña, and Thomas Pynchon also explored the virtues of an alternate model of subjectivity, one not predicated on the notion of acquiring a stable self. In pursuing both topics, these authors repeatedly took recourse to certain forms of American popular culture, including superhero comic books and silent screen comedy.\n\nPublished in HARTS&Minds Journal, December 2017. In this article, I argue that Buster Keaton’s 1921 short film 'The Playhouse' links the fragile ontology of masculine identity with the technological uncanny, two pervading anxieties of the silent period. Scholars such as Kathleen Karlyn and Peter Krämer have argued that the narrative structure and content in Keaton’s work directly addresses a liminal gender identity. Expanding on this, in this essay I engage theories of the ludic body and object as ‘thing’ with Keaton’s work (e.g. Engell, Merleau-Ponty, Bergson), arguing that Keaton’s multimodal play of props and body creates a carnivalesque space of mutable identities. Drawing on historical studies, I show how white North American masculinity at the turn of the 20th Century was constructed through the navigation of acute and shifting anxieties related to labour and increased mechanisation. Masculine identity in the period was not only changeable in itself, but also vulnerable to notions of change (Hilkey, Kimmel). I argue that Keaton plays on this vulnerability in ‘The Playhouse’. I begin by arguing that the establishment of machine systems in the film allows Keaton's character to negate the social obligations of his work place. In this way, he enacts the literal displacement of social and manual labour with mechanical play: his machines are a replacement society. Keaton’s integration of work/play objects into a system of comedic, repetitive, machinery undermines their specific identities, making them thing-like. This highlights the instability of objects/things in general, mirroring and impinging the unstable position of masculine identity.\n\nComedy has traditionally proven difficult to theorize. Though there have been several notable philosophies of comedy (like Sigmund Freud’s or Henri Bergson’s), comedy seems resistant to theorizing in a way that tragedy is not. There is an immediacy associated with comedy that renders it difficult to translate into other cultures or across long periods of time, and it is this immediacy that presents a barrier to making sense of it. The theory of comedy developed in Only a Joke Can Save Us takes this difficulty of theorizing comedy as its point of departure. The argument of the book is the comedy occurs in the necessarily fleeting moments when oppositions—specifically the opposition between lack and excess—collide. If we experience lack or excess in isolation, there is no comedy, but comedy always erupts when they intersect. Theorizing comedy in this way enables us to grasp what comedy reveals about subjects and the society that they inhabit. Comedy doesn’t simply reveal the hidden truth of society but rather exposes the connections that everyday life keeps at a distance. Comedy is not inherently radical, but it does always bring the disparate phenomena of lack and excess into proximity, and this exposes their inherent relationship for us as subjects. We are excessive beings because we are lacking beings. This becomes evident when we pay attention to the comic moment.\n\nThe Rush Hour films disrupt the formula for the interracial buddy cop formula by largely erasing Whites from the films. Despite the unconventional casting, the franchise has achieved “mainstream” popularity, which I argue is at least partly because the films construct Carter and Lee in an oppositional binary as a multiracial “odd couple,” converting Carter and Lee into physical embodiments of Blackness and Yellowness, fencing in the perimeters of Whiteness. Thus, Whiteness is able to remain protected and undetected in the normative center. Like a physical fence, however, the boundaries are semi-permeable, creating narrative openings to challenge Whiteness. Therefore, the Rush Hour franchise protects White normality but leaves it somewhat vulnerable at the margins."
