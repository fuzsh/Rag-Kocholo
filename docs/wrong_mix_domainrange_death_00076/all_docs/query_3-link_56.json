        "text": "No time was lost in turning on the current, and the manifestation that it was doing the appointed work was in the sudden, intense rigidity of the muscles of the man in the chair. His form seemed to be animated with a demoniac energy, as if his limbs and body were instantly converted into a substance of iron tenacity and that there was in every fiber a shuddering spasm.\n\nWhen they turn on the electricity at the execution of Czolgosz it might be well to let him feel a few well defined shocks of say an hour or two each before giving him a knock-out shock.\n\nThe stain from our land, of this Czolgosz,\n\nThe Nation stands pledged to, this fall, wash.\n\nSince this country dont suit him,\n\nWell electrocute him\n\nIt may some of the anarchist gall quash.\n\nIf the American people believe that the assassination of President McKinley was Gods will, why do they put Czolgosz to death? Do they wish to express their official disapproval of the will of God?\n\nWhile we are willing to admit that among some of the many definitions of insanity, one may be found to fit this murderers case, there is some satisfaction in the knowledge that in New York State they have an excellent and according to our way of thinking an ideal method of treatment for that particular form of insanity, by means of heroic doses of electricity. The cure is rapid and there is no danger of relapse.\n\nIf we were really sane and rational we would say: McKinley is dead; nothing we can do will bring him back to life. To kill the man who killed him will do no good; there would then be two murders instead of one.\n\nIt is at this time a perfectly natural and justifiable cause of satisfaction that the hopeless and self-convicted perpetrator of the infamous crime which now darkens with mourning every honest American household can anticipate nothing more gratifying to his brutal self-conceit, and nothing more heroically notorious or sensational, than a shameful death under the law.\n\nUncle Sam has a rat in his trapa human rat, fierce and vicious, with poisoned fangs. He is going to kill it like any other vermin, but mercifully. It will die by electricity, quickly and surely.\n\nIf Czolgosz believed it to be his duty, to kill McKinley, will not his electrocution make him a martyr in the eyes of all who believe as he does? And will not his death produce more assassinations of rulers, in accord with the well known principle that the blood of its martyrs is the seed of the church?\n\nHe was anxious to show his devotion to anarchy and its principles, and he followed the teachings of those subtle anarchists who preach assassination, and point the way to its commission, but are careful to avoid the actthe spilling of bloodand depend on the rashness of those who drink the poison of anarchy to die as Czolgosz has died this morning.\n\nChild of yellow journalism and anarchy, the most contemptible being that God ever permitted to breathe the breath of life, Leon F. Czolgosz, the cowardly cur who assassinated President McKinley on September 6, went to his death in Auburn Prison Tuesday morning shortly after 7 oclock, and by the use of a powerful electrical current of 1,700 volts the earth was made rid of the most loathsome creature it has ever known.\n\nIt was just and necessary that he be removed from the presence of mankind, upon even whose form and image he was a disgrace, an incubus, whose memory remains only as a foul recollection of the most despicable member of the human family whose very existence created an offensive eruption upon the face of Mother Earth.\n\nIf the pistol of Czolgosz set the crown of martyrdom upon the head of William McKinley, may not the electric bolt of a New York sheriff do the same thing for Leon Czolgosz; and may not the canonization of McKinleys assassin lead to other assassinations?\n\n. . . through the electric chair in Auburn prison this morning the assassin of the beloved President McKinley was removed from this earth and sent to the hosts of Satan, there to writhe through all ages to come in the agony of that worst of all human suffering comprised in a guilty conscience.\n\n. . . we would note that Czolgosz died in Auburn prison on Oct. 29th, and that even the press that gloated over his execution was sorrowfully compelled to admit he died like a brave man.\n\nCzolgosz belonged in the same class with the beasts of the jungle and like them fit to be exterminated for the best good of humanity.\n\n. . . may we have cause to be thankful for a speedy execution of Czolgosz. The world has no place but the grave for such as he.\n\nIf, as Lucifer has contended, the shooting of McKinley was a stupid, idiotic crime, then the burning to death of Czolgosz in what may be called the refinement of barbarismthe electric chairwas a crime millions of times more stupid and idiotic.\n\nThe execution excited even less interest than is usually bestowed on the destruction of a notorious criminal, and if there were any sympathizers with Czolgosz or his deed, they have been deprived of the consolations of martyr worship by the cold and reticent enforcement of the law.\n\nThe execution by electricity of Leon F. Czolgosz, which took place in the State Prison at Auburn, New York, on the morning of October 29, 1901, terminated the earthly existence of the most monstrous magnicide of the age.\n\nWe may kill Czolgosz, but, with his death, will we have killed the mother of his crime? Will she not still live and be the more infuriated by the death of her son?\n\nCzolgosz entered the chamber of death the coolest man of that company. He died with a curse upon his lips, and with the assertion that he was not sorry for his crime. Far from reforming, we launched him into an eternity whence repentance comes too late. We took from him all chance of a better life, of reform, and self-realization.\n\nThe wrath of government is a terrible wrath, its vengeance a double vengeance, a hideous and ghastly vengeance. It crisped the life and soul of its victim with the powerful electric spark; and ere the heart had yet stopped beating, and while the blood was still warm in his veinsthe vengeful thirst for gore not yet satiatedit burned his limped body in acid and lime. Oh, thou government! Merciful exampler [sic] of Christian love!\n\nCzolgosz should have been kept alive, under durance and scientific psychological surveillance, as the botanist would keep a newly found exotic, until more might have been learned of his strange mental make-up. . . ."
