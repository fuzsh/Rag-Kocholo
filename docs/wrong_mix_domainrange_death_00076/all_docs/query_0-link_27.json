        "text": "The assassination of President James Garfield cut short one of the most astounding political careers in U.S. history. Like few presidents before or after him, Garfield possessed a flexible mind and an ability to work well with others. His goal of integrating the recently freed slaves into the mainstream of American life died along with him.\n\nby Denise Noe\n\nOn July, 2, 1881, a deluded man named Charles Guiteau shot President James A. Garfield. The disabling and death of Garfield prematurely ended one of the most promising presidencies in American history. Garfield was a man of firm convictions who cooperated well with people and was widely admired. The last president born in a log cabin, Garfield rose from a more humble background than even Abraham Lincoln. Garfield distinguished himself in the Civil War, rising to the rank of Brigadier General at an earlier age that anyone else in American history. He had served nine terms in the House of Representatives, rising to Minority Leader during the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes.\n\nU.S. President James Abram Garfield\n\nGarfield had ascended to the presidency during a time of deep turmoil. Black Americans had been freed from slavery but were still in the bondage of rampant racial discrimination. Garfield was a radical for his time. Even more radical than Lincoln, Garfield was not only a stout abolitionist but a believer in racial equality.\n\nAnother issue tearing the country apart was the question of how jobs in the civil service should be awarded. The patronage system, sometimes called the spoils system, meant granting civil service jobs to those who had supported the current president and worked for his election. However, many people wanted to see the connection between the civil service and political patronage severed. The Democratic Party was largely united in wanting to see a merit system enacted while the Republican Party was deeply divided over this issue. Supporters of continuing the patronage system were called “Stalwarts” for their stalwart defense of this status quo while Republicans favoring reform were called “Half-Breeds” because many considered them only “Half-Republican.”\n\nThe issue of the awarding of civil service jobs was pivotal in the assassination of President Garfield.\n\n“Providence Only Could Have Saved My Life”\n\nJames Abram Garfield was born on November 19, 1831 to Eliza and Abram Garfield. Abram died in 1833, leaving Eliza with five children to feed and deeply in debt. The family’s poverty was such that little James did not possess a pair of shoes until he was 4 years old. As an adult, he warned against romanticizing the hardscrabble life, saying, “Let us never praise poverty, for a child at least.”\n\nAs Kenneth D. Ackerman observes in Dark Horse: The Surprise Election and Political Murder of President James A. Garfield, James early became “enamored with reading” and shone in school. Nevertheless, as a youth he did not yearn for a higher education but for the swashbuckling adventures of a sailor.\n\nAt 16, James obtained a position on a canal boat. In six weeks, he managed to fall overboard no less than 14 times. On the first 13, men on deck pulled him up. The 14th fall was different – and traumatizing.\n\nFalling overboard close to midnight, he screamed for help as he splashed in the water but his screams went unheard because no one was on deck. He grabbed on a rope and pulled himself up.\n\nIn Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the Murder of a President, Candice Millard reports, “As he sat, dripping and scared, on the deck of the canal boat, Garfield wondered why he was still alive. The rope was not secured to anything on the boat. When he had pulled on it, it should have fallen off the deck, slipping to the bottom of the canal and leaving him to drown.” Garfield later wrote, “Carefully examining it, I found that just where it came over the edge of the boat it had been drawn into a crack and there knotted itself.”\n\nHaving his life saved by such a happenstance convinced James he was destined for importance. He wrote, “I did not believe that God had paid any attention to me on my own account but I thought He had saved me for my mother and for something greater and better than canalling. . . . Providence only could have saved my life. Providence, therefore, thinks it worth saving.”\n\nDeciding to make a living with brain rather than brawn, he returned home to Eliza’s log cabin. After studying at local schools, he enrolled in an Ohio preparatory school, the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute, attending it from 1851 to the beginning of 1854. Unable to cover tuition, he worked as a janitor in exchange for schooling. By his second year at Eclectic, the school promoted him from janitor to assistant professor. He taught mathematics, literature, and ancient languages.\n\nIn mid-1854, he enrolled at Williams College in Massachusetts as a junior. As American President states, “He thrived intellectually at Williams. He relished the opportunity to hear Ralph Waldo Emerson and the challenge of confronting the strong personality of Williams’s President, Mark Hopkins. He fancied himself a reformer, identifying with the antislavery beliefs of the new Republican Party.”\n\nGarfield graduated with honors from Williams College in 1856. He returned to the Eclectic Institute – as a teacher. He became Eclectic Institute President at age 26. At Eclectic he met dark-haired, attractive, intelligent but reserved Lucretia “Crete” Rudolph who had been an Eclectic pupil and later worked as a schoolteacher. After a five-year courtship, wedding bells chimed in 1858.\n\nAn Ohio State Senator died suddenly in 1859. Garfield admirers urged him to take the deceased man’s place in the upcoming election. He did and won by a hefty margin. Garfield campaigned for Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 Presidential election. When the Southern states seceded, Garfield supported keeping the Union together and hoped the conflict would eliminate slavery. He asserted, “I am inclined to believe the sin of slavery is one of which it may be said that without the shedding of blood there is no remission.”\n\nIn between teaching at Eclectic, politicking, and setting up housekeeping with Lucretia, Garfield studied law on his own. He did not enroll in law school as that was not then required. In 1861, he passed the Ohio bar exam. As the country exploded into Civil War, Garfield enlisted in the Union Army. Impressed superiors promoted him to lieutenant colonel and then full colonel. Colonel Garfield enthusiastically recruited men into the 42nd Ohio Infantry.\n\nThe Battle for Kentucky\n\nThe 42nd was commissioned to turn Rebels back from Kentucky which held a critical strategic role as a border state and a critical symbolic role as Lincoln’s birthplace. Lincoln asserted, “I hope to have God on my side but I must have Kentucky.”\n\nSome believed the 42nd had been assigned a hopeless job. Millard notes, “The Confederate force it faced was 2,000 men strong, fortified with a battery of four cannons and several wagonloads of ammunition, and led by Humphrey Marshall, a well-known, well-seasoned brigadier general who had graduated from West Point the year after Garfield was born. In sharp contrast, the 42nd had 500 fewer soldiers and no artillery. Worse, its commander was a young academic who had spent the past decade thinking about Latin and higher math and had absolutely no military experience.”\n\nAfter receiving his orders, Garfield studied an eastern Kentucky map. The next morning, he led his men through fog, mud, sleet, and snow until they reached Marshall’s regiment. Garfield had decided on a singularly audacious – and risky – strategy. For the Battle of Middle Creek, Garfield divided the regiment into three smaller groups to attack the rebels from three different sides. Garfield hoped the enemy would have the mistaken impression of being encircled by a much larger regiment. Millard explains, “When Garfield’s first detachment attacked, the Confederates, as expected, confidently rushed to meet them. Then a second force fell upon the rebels from a different direction, throwing them into disarray and confusion. Just as they were beginning to figure out how to fight on two fronts, Garfield attacked on a third.”\n\nMarshall ordered his regiment to retreat. The Union controlled Kentucky! The daring Garfield was promoted to brigadier general.\n\nIn 1863 political operators encouraged Garfield to run for Congress. Ackerman reports, “Reluctant to leave the army at first, Garfield had visited Washington, D.C., and sought direction from Abraham Lincoln himself.” Ackerman continues that Lincoln “told the earnest young officer that he ‘had more commanding Generals around than he knew what to do with.’ What he needed, he said, was support on the political front.” Thus, in December 1863, Garfield resigned from the Army to serve in the United States House of Representatives. American President comments, “During the war years, Garfield distinguished himself as one of the most radical Republicans in Congress. . . . Garfield supported the seizure of rebel property in the North and the execution or exile of Confederate leaders.” As time passed, Garfield moderated his positions toward the defeated South – but he remained solidly radical in his anti-racism stance. Before the war’s end, Garfield introduced a resolution to allow blacks to walk through Washington, D.C. without carrying a pass. When the war ended, he gave an impassioned speech supporting extending suffrage to black males.\n\nAt one point, scandal besmirched Garfield. Several congressional representatives were accused of accepting money and stock from Crédit Mobilier, a construction company for the transcontinental Union Pacific Railroad that had received government loans and land grants. The representatives were further accused of using their influence to diminish congressional oversight of Crédit Mobilier. Garfield admitted receiving $329 from the company – not a humongous amount even in those days.\n\nDespite the scandal, he was re-elected in 1874.\n\nIn 1876, Garfield supported Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes for President. Hayes hoped to reform the system by which federal government jobs were filled. However, his proposals met stout resistance from those of his own Republican party designated as “Stalwarts.” In Demand Media, Ashley Portero writes, “Stalwart Republicans opposed the civil service reform measures advocated by the Hayes administration. Instead, the group favored [continuing] a patronage system – known as a ‘spoils system’ – that awarded political supporters with jobs in the federal government.” By contrast, the “Half-Breeds” supported civil service reforms, advocating an end to giving government jobs on the basis of political support. The term “Half-Breed” originated as a term of disparagement by their Stalwart opponents to suggest they were only “half-Republican.”\n\nDisappointed by his inability to pass reforms made, President Hayes announced at the end of his term that he would not run for a second term.\n\nRepublican Convention: Stalwarts Vs. Half-Breeds\n\nAt the June 1880 Republican convention, most political observers expected that the 1880 Republican party ticket would be headed either by former president and war hero Ulysses S. Grant, who was believed to have a good shot at an unprecedented third term in the White House or by Maine Senator James G. Blaine. A minority of observers believed Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman (and younger brother of General William Tecumseh Sherman) would be nominated.\n\nStalwarts solidly supported the nomination Grant while Half-Breeds were divided between Blaine and Sherman.\n\nGarfield was scheduled to make a speech supporting Sherman. This troubled Garfield because, although he felt obligated to support Sherman because he was a fellow Ohioan, Garfield did not believe Sherman was the best candidate. Garfield was also troubled because he would be thrust into competition with Stalwart leader Roscoe Conkling.\n\nNew York Senator Conkling was one of the most powerful men in America. A decade previously, then-President Grant put Conkling in charge of the New York Customs House, America’s biggest federal office which collected 70 percent of U.S. customs revenue. Millard reports, “Since then, Conkling had personally made each appointment to the customs house. Any man fortunate enough to receive one of the high-paying jobs had been expected to make generous contributions to the Republican Party of New York, and to show unwavering loyalty to Conkling.”\n\nGarfield and Conkling had some important things in common. Both had stoutly opposed slavery and both supported rights for ex-slaves. Indeed, Conkling had helped draft the 14th Amendment that extended citizenship and other legal protections to former slaves.\n\nHowever, Conkling’s strongest commitment was to the patronage system, the source of his personal power. In a reform effort, President Hayes had dismissed a Conkling appointee, Chester A. Arthur, from being New York Customs House Collector. Furious at Arthur’s removal, Conkling attacked Hayes during the rest of his term.\n\nConkling also had a long-standing feud with Blaine. They had gotten into a spat in Congress 14 years previously and not spoken to each other since. As might be expected, Conkling was dead-set against Blaine being nominated for the presidency. Conkling fervently wanted Grant nominated.\n\nWhen Garfield gave his speech for Sherman, Garfield at one point said, “Gentlemen of the Convention, what do we want?”\n\nTo Garfield’s own surprise, some in the crowd shouted, “We want Garfield!”\n\nGarfield continued, “I nominate John Sherman of Ohio” – receiving strong applause.\n\nA total of 379 votes were required to win the nomination. The first ballot had no one with enough to win. Nor did the second or third. However, the third ballot had two new names with one vote each: Indiana Senator Benjamin Harrison (who would become President in nine years) and Garfield.\n\nAs more ballots were taken, more votes went to Garfield – who reacted with distress. Garfield objected, “The announcement contains votes for me. No man has a right, without the consent of the person voted for, to announce that person’s name, and vote for him, in this convention. Such consent I have not given.” The convention leader ordered Garfield to “resume his seat.”\n\nA groundswell of support surged for Garfield who was described as “pale as death” when he found himself his party’s nominee for president.\n\nThus, in the 1880 presidential race, Republican Garfield was pitted against Democrat Winfield S. Hancock.\n\nRepublican party bigwigs knew it was vital to win New York and that to win New York, Conkling had to strongly back Garfield. As a way of securing Conkling's support, the party offered the vice-presidential nomination to a man so close to Conkling he shared his home: Chester Arthur. Sherman raged, “The nomination of Arthur is a ridiculous burlesque. He never held an office except the one he was removed from!”\n\nNevertheless, Arthur became Garfield’s running mate.\n\nLongtime Loser\n\nCharles Guiteau\n\nOne who campaigned for Garfield was Charles J. Guiteau whose life bore striking parallels to Garfield’s. However, in some ways those parallels turn into polar opposites for while Garfield had often snatched victory from defeat – and even had the glory of a presidential nomination thrust upon him -- Guiteau had shuffled from failure to failure.\n\nBorn on September 8, 1841, Charles Julius Guiteau was the fourth of the six children of Luther and Jane Guiteau. Like Garfield, Guiteau suffered the early loss of a parent. In Guiteau’s case, it was his mother who died when Charles was 7 years old. Luther was extremely religious. Charles later recalled, “My father was a father and a mother to me and I drank in this fanaticism from him for years.” Charles was also close to a sister, Frances, who was six years older than he.\n\nWhile a teenager, Charles worked for his father who did not consider college worthwhile despite Charles’ strong desire for it. In 1859, Charles received an inheritance from his maternal grandfather. It allowed him to enter the University of Michigan.\n\nAt about this time, Luther became impressed by the “Bible communism” of John Humphrey Noyes, founder of the Oneida Community in New York State. Following in his father’s footsteps, Charles studied Noyes’ precepts.\n\nNoyes taught that human beings could achieve intellectual, moral, and spiritual perfection through the right combination of prayer and education. To aid others in finding this perfection, he founded the Oneida Community, named after the town in which it was formed, in 1848.\n\nThe Oneida Community was a Christian “millennial” organization best known for practicing “complex marriage” or “Free Love.” Noyes believed monogamy was “unhealthy and pernicious.” Those living in the Oneida Community were allowed multiple sex partners. However, to avoid incessant pregnancies, Noyes advocated “male continence” or intercourse “up to the moment of emission,” a practice commonly called “withdrawal.”\n\nIn 1860, Charles left college to enter the Oneida Community. Like most members, he lived in a sprawling brick Victorian Gothic building called the “Mansion House.” Almost 300 people occupied the 35 Mansion House apartments. The private rooms were small but the Oneida Community boasted a range of amenities including theaters and a Turkish bath.\n\nCharles chafed at Oneida Community rules. Members were expected to accept assignments in the fields and kitchens as needed. Ackerman observes that Guiteau “became moody and complained about doing menial work.” Nursing the longtime belief that God had special plans for him, an indignant Charles Guiteau wrote to Noyes, “You prayed God . . . to send you help, and he has sent me.” Guiteau complained, “I ask no one to respect me personally, but I do ask them to respect me as an envoy of the true God.” Guiteau insisted he was “God’s minute man.”\n\nEager to enjoy the benefits of “complex marriage” and willing to practice withdrawal, Guiteau found himself rejected by Oneida Community women who nicknamed him “Charles Gitout.” After nearly six years as a celibate in a Free Love commune, he left the Oneida Community on April 3, 1865, because he believed God had chosen him to spread Noyes’s doctrines by founding a newspaper. Charles went to Hoboken, New Jersey where he founded the Daily Theocrat. The paper flopped and on July 20, 1865, he re-entered Oneida. According to the Charles Guiteau Collection, “Then, just over a year later, he again quit, and on November 1, 1866, he departed with some money that he had originally consigned to the community.” During this time, his sister Frances and her husband occasionally gave him handouts or allowed him to live with them for awhile.\n\nHe decided on a legal career. He clerked in a Chicago law office and passed the Illinois bar exam in 1868. He set up his own law office. Soon after, in 1869, he married librarian Anne Bunn. The marriage was troubled from the start partly because Guiteau’s odd work performance led to few clients and a low income. Defending one client, Guiteau actually jumped over the bar separating him from the jury and waved a fist in a juror’s face. The jury convicted Guiteau’s client without leaving their seats. In another case, Guiteau failed to address the petty larceny of which his client was accused but droned to the jury about such issues as the general rights of man and the nature of divinity.\n\nAckerman notes that Anne “grew tired of his short tempter, constant lack of money, hiding from bill collectors, and fleeing apartments for lack of rent. He beat her, punched and kicked her when she disagreed with him, and sometimes for no apparent reason at all. Finally, in 1874, Guiteau purposely slept with a prostitute in New York, where they’d moved after Chicago’s Great Fire, to create legal grounds for a New York divorce.” Anne divorced him. For the next 14 years, Guiteau bounced between New York and Chicago, opening law offices that soon closed.\n\nIn between practicing law, he traveled as an evangelist. In places ranging from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Buffalo, New York, he rented venues and preached sermons. When traveling by train, he sometimes went on the train without buying a ticket. He said it was not “dead beating” since he was “working for the Lord.” Often conductors took pity and let him ride although some evicted him at the next station. He took a similar approach to accommodations, finding nice boarding houses and slipping out sans payment. On occasion, he found himself in jail for failing to pay a boarding house. In 1874, failure to pay board led to a month-long stay in a New York jail.\n\nThe Charles Guiteau Collection reports, “Increasingly despondent over his prospects, Charles Guiteau conceived of the idea to sue the Oneida Community on a trumped up charge of withholding compensation for the work he professed to have performed under its auspices. For a few months, Guiteau sent threatening letters to Noyes that amounted to blackmail. Eventually, he desisted, when Oneida’s own lawyers threatened to prosecute him for extortion and to use his letters against him.”\n\nIn the summer of 1875, Guiteau was living with his sister and her family in Wisconsin. One day Frances asked if he would “cut up a little wood for us.”\n\nHe cut the wood but, instead of taking it to the shed, he dropped it on the house’s walkway. Rather than risk a quarrel, Frances stooped down to pick up some wood. She later remembered, “As quick as I did that he raised the ax, without any provocation or words. It was not so much the raising of the ax as it was the look of his face that frightened me. He looked to me like a wild animal.” The terrified woman dropped the wood and raced into the house.\n\nAt Frances’s request, the family doctor examined Charles. The physician told Frances that Charles’s “explosions of emotional feeling” indicated severe mental illness and advised institutionalization. Charles left his sister’s home before action could be taken on the doctor’s recommendation. Guiteau traveled for five years. He lived in Boston in 1880 when he suddenly took a strong interest in politics. He became a Republican of Stalwart stripe. He decided to volunteer in the upcoming presidential campaign, convinced that his work in the area would lead to a high-ranking political appointment.\n\nLike most Americans, Guiteau believed the Republicans would nominate Grant. He believed (correctly) that the Democrats would nominate Union General Winfield Scott Hancock. Hoping to make his mark in the politics, Guiteau wrote a speech entitled “Grant and Hancock.” When the Republicans nominated Garfield, Guiteau refreshed it and changed its title to “Garfield against Hancock.”\n\nSpeech in hand, an excited Guiteau boarded the steamship Stonington along with about 300 other passengers to travel to New York. Guiteau planned to pay a visit to the Republican campaign headquarters.\n\nDisaster Aboard the Stonington\n\nLate in the evening of June 11, 1880, Guiteau suffered insomnia. Near midnight, he walked out on deck. Gazing into the darkness, he was suddenly jarred because the steamship Narragansett crashed head-on into the Stonington. Millard writes, “As the tragedy unfolded before him, Guiteau could hear the screams and desperate cries for help, which continued, disembodied, even after the ship burned to the waterline and then sank, plunging the shell-shocked witnesses, once again, into complete darkness. The frightened and ill-prepared crew of the Stonington lowered lifeboats into the water and circled blindly for hours, searching for survivors by their cries and pulling them to safety by arms, legs, clothing, even the hair of their heads. Many, however, had already drowned, or had drifted beyond help, their cries fading as they were carried away by the tide.”\n\nSome Stonington survivors transferred to a steamship that had come to their rescue. Guiteau was among that lucky group. In a parallel reaction to that of Garfield who survived a near-drowning, Guiteau was convinced that God chose to save him so he could accomplish something vital.\n\nMost observers believed the Democratic nominee, Winfield Scott Hancock, stood little chance. He had distinguished himself as a Union general but never held elected office. Catty Republicans distributed a pamphlet entitled Hancock’s Political Achievements– filled with blank pages!\n\nWhat’s more, despite Hancock having won fame as a Union general, most Americans identified the Democratic Party with the South. Garfield derided it as the “Rebel Party.”\n\nHancock supporters sought to smear Garfield with the Crédit Mobilier scandal. They often wrote the numbers “329,” for the amount of money Garfield acknowledged accepting, on sidewalks and on the sides of buildings.\n\nEx-slaves were among the most enthusiastic Garfield campaigners because of his support for extending full rights to them. In a speech, former slave turned famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass proclaimed Garfield “right on our questions” and asserted, “He has come from obscurity to fame, and we’ll make him more famous!”\n\nHolding his “Garfield Against Hancock” speech, Guiteau sought out Republican Vice-Presidential nominee Chester Arthur. Eventually, Arthur gave Guiteau the opportunity to deliver the speech to a New York gathering.\n\nOn November 3, 1880, Garfield was elected president.\n\nThe day after his inauguration, Guiteau took a train from New York to Washington, D.C. Believing his speech had been instrumental in securing the presidency for Garfield, Guiteau was certain the grateful president would reward his efforts. He mailed a letter to Garfield asserting, “We have cleaned them out just as I expected. Thank God!”\n\nIn December, Garfield made a vital political appointment. He put James G. Blaine in the top Cabinet position, that of Secretary of State. His appointment to that office had been a masterstroke. Ackerman observes, “By this one action, Garfield had managed to shift the axis of power in American government. Instead of the New York Stalwarts who had won him his election and demanded tribute, Garfield would now anchor his line to James G. Blaine, the ‘magnetic man’ from Maine, who’d shown himself fully able and not the least bit hesitant to deal with Roscoe Conkling.”\n\nLines of Office Seekers\n\nA typical day for the new president included trying to get away from the lengthy lines of office seekers waiting outside his front door. A large section of the day, from 10:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Monday through Friday was taken with about a hundred such seekers. Garfield complained, “My day is frittered away by the personal seeking of people when it ought to be given to the great problems which concern the whole country.” Office seekers also haunted the Secretary of State Blaine.\n\nAs usual for Guiteau, he spent his time in Washington D.C. moving from boardinghouse to boardinghouse to avoid paying rent. In some cases, he staved off landlords by saying he was soon to come into a lucrative political appointment.\n\nAn early Guiteau letter to Garfield stated, “I, Charles Guiteau, hereby make application for the Austrian Mission.” The puzzled President read this letter and commented to an associate that it was an “illustration of unparalleled audacity and impudence.”\n\nAs months passed, Guiteau experienced a change of heart. In a letter to Garfield, Guiteau wrote, “I think I prefer Paris to Vienna and, if agreeable to you, should be satisfied with the consulship of Paris.” He also enclosed a copy of the speech he had presented in New York, telling Garfield it had “resulted in your election.” Guiteau regularly visited the White House. One time, he actually met Garfield. Guiteau introduced himself as applying for the Paris consulship and handed Garfield the campaign speech. Guiteau left, certain the Paris consulship would soon be his although he continued his regular visits to the White House.\n\nGuiteau's pistol\n\nFor months, he waited for an appointment that never came. In May 1881, Guiteau had an idea that he later said came upon him “like a flash.” That idea: “If the President was out of the way, everything would go better.” He was certain this idea did not come from his own mind but had been placed there by God. However, he later said he had not wanted to heed God’s direction in this instance. He said he was “horrified” by the idea and “kept throwing it off.” Nevertheless, “It kept growing upon me, pressing me, goading me.”\n\nGuiteau later recalled praying daily for two weeks, hoping God would indicate that He did not really want Guiteau to kill Garfield. However, on June 1, 1889, Guiteau accepted that God wanted him to assassinate the President – and that he would fulfill God’s order.\n\nGuiteau selected a gun with an ivory handle because he believed it would look better when eventually displayed in a museum as the gun that felled a president.\n\nAlthough he would be described as a “disappointed office seeker,” Guiteau denied he wanted to kill Garfield for that reason. He explained, “The Lord inspired me to attempt to remove the President in preference to someone else because I had the brains and the nerve to do the work. The Lord always employs the best material to do His work.”\n\nThe President Is Shot!\n\nOn July 2, 1881, Garfield prepared for a planned trip to New England with his older sons, Harry and Jim. The group would meet up with Lucretia, who was recovering in New Jersey from a recent illness, and then head to Massachusetts where Garfield would attend the Williams College 25th class reunion and help Harry and Jim get settled for the academic year.\n\nIt was early that morning when Garfield, Blaine, Harry, and Jim arrived at the Washington D.C. train station located at Sixth and B Streets. Ladies’ waiting room matron Sarah White noted that the President of the United States walked through the station “absolutely free from any affectation whatever.” His free and easy attitude contrasted sharply with that of a man who had arrived earlier and caught White’s attention. That man appeared oddly ill at easy, slouching, his head often held at an angle, and his eyes shuttling nervously around the station.\n\n(Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper)\n\nMoments after Garfield entered the station, Guiteau drew his revolver, aimed it at Garfield’s back, and shot.\n\nGarfield’s arms shot up in shock and he exclaimed, “My God! What is this?”\n\nThe first bullet pierced Garfield’s right arm and passed into a toolbox carried by a terrified but luckily unharmed station worker.\n\nAs Garfield turned to look at his assailant, Guiteau fired his second shot. Garfield fell to the floor, vomiting as a huge wet red stain covered the back of his suit.\n\nScreams filled the station.\n\nGuiteau raced for the door leading to the street and his carriage. A man blocked the door. Guiteau turned and raced for another exit but was caught by ticket agent Robert Parke who shouted, “This is the man!” Officer Patrick Kearney ran to Park’s side to hold Guiteau. As he was grabbed, Guiteau exclaimed, “I’m a Stalwart and Arthur will be president!”\n\nIn an unusual twist, a group of black men – so often the victims of lynching -- gathered, shouting, “Lynch him!”\n\nRealizing the danger posed by the crowd, Guiteau said, “I want to go to jail” to Kearney. The officer hurried Guiteau into a police vehicle that transported him to the District Jail. On his way, Guiteau said to a detective seating beside him, “You stick to me and have me put in the third story, front, at the jail. General Sherman is coming down to take charge. Arthur and all those men are my friends, and I’ll have you made Chief of Police.”\n\nGuiteau thought he had accomplished God’s mission and expected to reap rewards for it. He talked volubly with the arresting officers, saying, “I am a native-born American, born in Chicago and am a lawyer and theologian.” Asked his motive, he replied, “To save the Republican party. . . I am a Stalwart . . . with Garfield out of the way, we can carry all the northern states.” Guiteau shot the President to preserve the political patronage system – even though Guiteau had failed to gain office through that system.\n\nDoctors rushed to the station to attend Garfield.\n\nNeither bullet caused a fatal injury although two of Garfield’s ribs were broken and an artery grazed. The bullets missed his spinal cord and all vital organs. However, doctors believed it imperative to remove from Garfield’s body the second bullet that had lodged in his back.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Health Officer Dr. Smith Townsend arrived five minutes after the wounding. Nine more doctors joined Townsend within an hour.\n\nTownsend gave Garfield sips of brandy and aromatic spirits of ammonia. When Garfield was conscious enough to talk, the doctor asked Garfield where he hurt worst and Garfield indicated his lower body. Townsend stuck a fingers into Garfield’s back wound in an unsuccessful effort to find the bullet. At Townsend’s request, station workers brought out a mattress upon which they lifted him. The group carried Garfield from the waiting room to a large room upstairs.\n\nGarfield moaned and vomited as he drifted in and out of consciousness. He managed to say, “I think you’d better telegraph Crete.” His wife was informed by telegraph that he had been shot.\n\nA doctor who joined Townsend was the remarkable Dr. Charles Purvis. Purvis was one of the first African-Americans trained in medicine. On this day, he became the first black physician to treat a U.S. president.\n\nAnother physician summoned to Garfield’s side was the prominent Dr. D. Willard Bliss who had lived near Garfield’s home when Garfield was a child and was well-acquainted with Garfield. Bliss had served the Union Army as a surgeon during the war and been in private practice in Washington D. C. since 1865.\n\nWhen Bliss arrived he questioned Purvis and Townsend before essentially assuming control of Garfield’s treatment. Bliss took a long probe out of his doctor’s black bag and stuck the probe into one of Garfield’s wounds to search for the bullet.\n\nLister vs. Bliss of the “Good Old Surgical Stink”\n\nDoctor Willard Bliss\n\nBliss could not find the bullet and removed the probe. He probed with a finger but this too failed.\n\nBliss had the injured President transferred to a room in the White House for recovery. As was common in those days, doctors came to what was made into a sickroom rather than taking Garfield to a hospital.\n\nMillard writes that later observers wondered, “how Bliss came to be in charge of the case.” A doctor recalled, “He just took charge of it.” Ackerman writes that the day after the shooting, Bliss summoned all the attending physicians together. Ackerman writes that Bliss “told them he’d had a private talk with the president and Mrs. Garfield and they had made a decision. The President had complained that there were too many physicians treating him and he’d suffered through too many painful examinations. Bliss alone would be in charge now. Only a handful of doctors could stay, he told them; the rest would have to leave.” Some doctors objected and there was some heated conversation but eventually most acquiesced to what they took to be Garfield’s wishes.\n\nHowever, Lucretia later stated there had been no such conversation. Nevertheless, Bliss was in charge from that point forward.\n\nBliss had inserted probe and finger without cleaning. Like most American physicians of the time, Bliss scorned the antiseptic theories of Joseph Lister who had enjoyed great success with convincing European doctors that germs, though they could not be seen, were omnipresent and that sterilizing wounds and surrounding areas was essential. Bliss and others held that these “invisible germs” were as much a figment of the imagination as the “invisible humors” of the past. History House quotes an American physician writing in 1878, “In order to successfully practice Mr. Lister’s Antiseptic Method, it is necessary that we should believe, or act as if we believed, the atmosphere to be loaded with germs.” Around that same time, George Shrady, The Medical Record editor, wrote, “We are as likely to be as much ridiculed in the next century for our blind belief in the power of unseen germs, as our forefathers were for their faith in the influence of spirits.” Bliss and similar thinking American doctors believed European physicians wasted time with their newfangled practices of washing their hands and using sterilized instruments.\n\nDr. Joseph Lister\n\nAmerica’s physicians generally prided themselves on the “good old surgical stink” of their hospitals and believed a stained surgeon’s coat, covered with layers of crumbling dried puss and blood, was a tribute to the physician’s professional experience.\n\nA minority of American doctors were impressed by Lister’s theories and concerned about the treatment Garfield was receiving. Dr. E. L. Patee wrote Lucretia, advising, “Do not allow probing of the wound. Probing generally does more harm than the ball.” He also urged, “Saturate everything with carbolic acid.”\n\nBliss scorned such advice. Bliss announced he believed Garfield would recover.\n\nAlthough he rarely complained, Garfield suffered agonizing pains. He described a sense of “tiger’s claws” seizing. He steadily lost weight because he could not keep food down. He suffered many attacks of vomiting in a day. Despite his agony, he was unfailingly kind to those attending him.\n\nGarfield managed to avoid complaining even though his condition meant he could no longer take care of his most intimate body functions. As a physician commented, “Every passage of his bowels and urine required the same attendance bestowed upon a young infant.”\n\nBlaine visited Garfield shortly after the President was taken to the White House room that had been transformed into a sickroom. Garfield inquired as to the identity of the shooter. Blaine said it was office seeker Charles Guiteau. Garfield said, “Why did that man shoot me? I have done him no wrong. What could he have wanted to shoot me for?” Blaine said Guiteau must have been disappointed over failing to get an office. Garfield never again asked about Guiteau.\n\nWhile the normally stout Garfield rapidly lost weight, the heretofore thin Guiteau gained it. Guiteau enthusiastically chowed down the tasteless jail food because he was so happy. Certain the American people applauded his actions and confident President Arthur would pardon him, Guiteau was cheerful. He relished talking to journalists – who often experienced disgust when interviewing him. Reporter Edmund Bailey wrote, “His vanity is literally nauseating. Guiteau has an idea that the civilized world is holding its breath waiting to hear of the minutest details of his career.”\n\nWhen Guiteau’s jailors photographed him, he seemed to revel in it. To the photographer, Guiteau said, “I don’t want to appear strained and awkward. If my picture is taken at all it must be a good one.” After one photograph, Guiteau eagerly asked, “Did you get me good that time? I want to look natural.”\n\nHe read with interest newspaper accounts about him but seemed nonplussed by the universal contempt and hostility expressed toward him.\n\nA Deteriorating President\n\nOver a month after the shooting, the bedridden President was completely helpless, often vomiting and regularly bathed in sweat. On July 22, an enormous amount of pus leaked from his wound. A piece of bone about one eighth of an inch long and cloth fragments that the bullet had dragged into his back accompanied the vile liquid profusion. On July 23, Bliss sent for other surgeons. Dr. David Hayes Agnew and Dr. Frank Hamilton joined Bliss and the trio of physicians operated on Garfield’s back and inserted a drainage tube.\n\nMillard reports, “Two days after the first surgery, Agnew again operated on the President, enlarging the opening he had earlier made over his rib and pulling out fragments of muscle, connective tissue, and bone, one piece of which was an inch long.”\n\nDoctors were desperate to find the bullet, believing that removing it was key to Garfield’s recovery. Unfortunately, the X-ray would not be invented for another decade. Nevertheless, famous inventor Alexander Graham Bell, whose telephone would so transform the world, believed he might have the answer to finding the bullet in an invention Bell called the “induction balance.” Ackerman describes it as “a rudimentary metal detector whose electrically charged needle supposedly could locate a hidden object inside a patient’s body.” Bell tried it on Garfield but the machine failed to find the bullet. The failure may partly have been the result of it being thrown off by metal springs in the bed. Another explanation for the failure, as Ackerman writes, was that Bliss instructed Bell “to look for it in the wrong place, near the liver.”\n\nInfection spread throughout Garfield’s increasingly weakened body. Along with chills, sweating, and regular vomiting, lumps full of pus, nicknamed “septic acne,” appeared on Garfield’s arms and back.\n\nAt Bliss’s direction, Agnew operated on Garfield on August 8 to allow pus to escape. He cut open Garfield to insert drainage tubes that released pus.\n\nHowever, two weeks after that surgery, an abcess formed between Garfield’s mouth and an ear. It caused part of his face to swell and then exploded, spurting so much pus onto Garfield that he almost drowned in it.\n\nAs Garfield lost weight, Bliss resorted to feeding through an “enemata.” Food was mixed with opium and inserted into Garfield’s rectum. History House notes that, at one point, charcoal was substituted for egg in the enematas because doctors believed that the egg might have contributed to the extreme flatulence Garfield suffered – and from which those treating him also suffered due to the overwhelming odor.\n\nAfter two months of agony, Garfield decided his only hope was a change of atmosphere. On September 5, he emphatically told Bliss he wanted to be taken to an area by the sea.\n\nGarfield was on a train the next day and transported to Elberon, New Jersey. At Elberon, Garfield was placed in a room at the Franklyn Cottage, the summer home of a wealthy man who had offered it to Garfield as long as it was wanted. As Garfield was carried into the room, he saw that the bed was turned from the window. At his request, it was moved so the ailing man could have a clear view of the ocean. Garfield welcomed that view but it could not save him from the consequences of massive infection. On the evening of September 19, the unconscious Garfield shouted in pain before his breathing turned fast and shallow. Lucretia hurried into the room and was terrified by his appearance. She bent over and kissed him as an attendant ran to fetch Bliss.\n\nAt 10:35 p.m., of September 19, 1881, Bliss realized that Garfield was dead. Bliss said, “It is over.”\n\nChester Arthur was sworn into office as President of the United States on September 20.\n\nAutopsy\n\nOn the same day Arthur officially became president, doctors autopsied Garfield. The Dr. D. S. Lamb of the Army Medical Museum led the autopsy. He was assisted by a local physician and six of those who had treated Garfield, including Bliss, Hamilton, and Agnew.\n\nWhen they cut open the stomach, they saw the bullet’s track. To their surprise, it had traveled to the left side of Garfield’s body, behind his pancreas.\n\nAlong his right was a long channel of which the autopsy report stated, “This long descending channel was supposed during life to have been the track of the bullet” but was seen by the autopsy doctors as a channel of “pus.” Indeed, his entire body showed signs of infection. Ackerman observes, “There were collections of abscesses below his right ear, in the middle of his back, across his shoulders, and near his left kidney. He had infection-induced pneumonia in both of his lungs, and there was an enormous abcess, measuring half a foot in diameter, near his liver.”\n\nThe doctors were dismayed at the implications. The bullet itself had not killed the President. Infection, brought about to a large extent by attempts to heal Garfield, had killed him.\n\nSix months after Garfield’s demise, The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal published a piece by respected German physician Friedrich Esmarch asserting, “It seems that the attending physicians were under the pressure of the public opinion that they were doing far too little. But according to my opinion they have not done too little but too much.”\n\nThat minority of American physicians who championed Joseph Lister’s antiseptic doctrines blasted the traditionalist position Bliss and others maintained. An American physician who had just returned from Europe where he studied the “Listerian method of wound treatment,” Dr. Arpad Gerster, wrote, “None of the injuries inflicted by the assassin’s bullet were necessarily fatal.” Taking a jab at the doctor who had taken over Garfield’s treatment, Dr. Gerster elaborated, “Ignorance is Bliss.”\n\nBliss asserted that infection had not killed Garfield. Bliss claimed he had given Garfield the best treatment possible and presented Congress with a $25,000 bill. Congress paid only $6,500. Angered by the relatively paltry amount, Bliss refused any payment.\n\nAlthough he never admitted error, Bliss’ reputation suffered as did his practice. He died seven years later of a stroke.\n\nThe Last of Charles Guiteau\n\nOn October 14, standing before Judge Walter Cox, Guiteau stated in response to a charge of first-degree murder, “I plead not guilty to the indictment.” He elaborated that his plea was one of “insanity” because “it was God’s act and not mine. The Divine pressure on me to remove the President was so enormous that it destroyed my free agency, and therefore I am not legally responsible for my act.” He also said he was certain God was overseeing the trial and would ensure Guiteau’s freedom. Guiteau commented, “I have entire confidence in His disposition to protect me and to send me forth to the world a free and innocent man.”\n\nThe trial started on November 14. Guiteau’s brother-in-law George Scoville was the defense attorney.\n\nThe judge refused Guiteau’s request to make his own opening statement. Guiteau handed a written statement to reporters sitting in a row behind him. That statement argued, “General Garfield died from malpractice. According to his own physicians, he was not fatally shot. The doctors who mistreated him ought to bear the odium for his death, and not his assailant. They ought to be indicted for murdering James A. Garfield, and not me.”\n\nDays later, as a witness testified to the shooting, Guiteau interrupted, saying, “I deny the killing, if your honor please. We admit the shooting.”\n\nAll during the trial, Guiteau made interruptions. At one point, he shouted at his own attorney, “Don’t spoil the matter on cross-examination! That is the way you generally do. You spoil everything by cross-examination.” Guiteau also called Scoville a “jackass.”\n\nAt one point, a witness testified that a fund was set up for the President’s widow and children. Guiteau yelled, “The rich men of New York gave Mrs. Garfield $200,000 or $300,000. It was a splendid thing – a noble thing. Now, I want them to give me some money.”\n\nGuiteau’s outbursts made his insanity evident and doctors testified to it. Psychiatrist Dr. George Beard testified about the defendant’s mind, “All the links in the chain are there but they are not joined but rather tossed about hither and thither, singly, like quoits, each one good and strong of itself, but without any relation to each other.” Beard asserted of the defendant, “His insanity forces itself constantly to the front, breaking in upon his eloquence.”\n\nProsecutors called Dr. John Purdue Gray, superintendent of the New York State Lunatic Asylum. He testified that Guiteau’s problem was “only depravity.”\n\nOn January 26, 1882, the jury convicted Guiteau of first-degree murder.\n\nThunderous applause broke out from courtroom spectators. The judge demanded quiet and they ceased clapping. In the silence, Guiteau yelled, “My blood be on the head of the jury!” He continued, “God will avenge this outrage!”\n\nGuiteau went to the scaffold on June 30, 1882. He pitched his voice high like a child’s as he recited from a poem of his own composition: “I am going to the Lordy, Glory hallelujah! Glory hallelujah! I am going to the Lordy!” When he finished, he was hanged.\n\nPresident Chester A. Arthur\n\nThe New York Times wrote about the start of the presidency of Chester A. Arthur, “No man ever assumed the presidency of the United States under more trying circumstances; no president has needed more the generous appreciation, the indulgent forbearance of his fellow citizens.\n\nTo a large extent, the American people granted that forbearance – and Arthur earned their appreciation. His first official act as President was to proclaim the day Garfield was buried – September 26, 1881 – a national day of mourning.\n\nAlthough Arthur had been placed on the ticket as a Stalwart, Garfield’s assassination led Arthur to re-examine his position on the issue. He embraced his martyred predecessors position for reform. In 1883, Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Act into law that basically dismantled the patronage system. While some Stalwarts hoped to repeal the Act after it was initially made law, it soon became evident that the new, merit system was superior to the patronage system. Thus, demand for repeal faded away. By about 1890, both Stalwarts and Half-Breeds had also faded away as identifications.\n\nArthur tried for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1884 but the Republicans nominated Blaine who lost to Democrat Grover Cleveland. Seven months after leaving office, Arthur died of a kidney disease.\n\nA Look Back\n\nThe Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds have largely been forgotten, a fact that the wise Garfield would have well understood. In his inaugural address, he spoke of “leaving behind the battlefields of dead issues” and noted, “We do not now differ in our judgment concerning the controversies of past generations, and 50 years hence our children will not be divided in their opinions concerning our controversies.”\n\nUnfortunately, President Garfield has also been forgotten.

Also gunned down on the same day but at a kosher supermarket were four Jewish men. Meanwhile, Paris’s stores, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and museums are deserted while 5,000 policemen and 10,000 soldiers have been deployed to guard government buildings, synagogues, mosques, Jewish and Muslim schools, and shopping malls and department stores like Galaries Lafayette.\n\nBy Marilyn Z. Tomlins\n\nParisians woke on the morning of Wednesday, January 7, 2015, to an icy fog descending over the rooftops.\n\nTwo days previously, on Monday, the children had returned to school after the Christmas vacation, their parents having returned to work too. All already having had to cope with crowded buses and underground rail cars, and bumper to bumper road traffic for 48 hours, the fact that the weather was not looking so good, did not cheer anyone.\n\nWorse was to come.\n\nAt around 11:45 am news began to circulate through the City of Light that a terrorist attack had just a few minutes earlier taken place at the offices of the satirical weekly, Charlie Hebdo. Several people had been shot: some might be dead.\n\nThe perpetrators -- it was not certain how many there were -- were hooded and dressed in black, and had shouted Allahu Akbar (Arabic for \"God is Great\") as they ran to a parked car and sped from the killing scene.\n\nAt the end of the day the death toll would stand at 12.\n\nThe following day -- Thursday, January 8 -- someone else would be gunned down, and the day after that -- Friday, January 9 -- another four people would be gunned down.\n\nThe total of dead having risen to 17, the three-day terrorist attack would be the worst terrorist attack France had suffered in 54 years. The worst was on Sunday, June 18, 1961, when a paramilitary organisation (the OAS - Organisation de l’armée secrete) opposed to the independence of the French colony of Algeria had detonated a bomb on a packed Strasbourg-Paris train killing 28 people and injuring over a hundred.\n\nIn June 1961 France and Algeria were at war -- the Algerian War (1954-1962).\n\nIn January 2015 France was not at war with any country. France was in armed conflict, yes, with the various radical Islamist groups, among these, ISIL, ISIS, IS, Boko Haram, Daesh and also al-Qaeda although it had been silent since the death of its leader Osama Bin Laden in 2011. And France was resisting through trial and imprisonment those in the country who either verbally or with acts of violence supported such radical Islamist groups.\n\nBut France was at peace.\n\nFestive Season lights were still flickering along the boulevards and there was a bonne année -- a happy new year -- to look forward to.\n\nShattering that peace\n\nAt 1 p.m. on that Wednesday, January 7, the fog having lifted and a cold but bright sun shining, the news of the terrorist attack having broken, an atypical silence fell over Paris. The Parisians were scared. Minister of the Interior, Bernard Cazeneuve, in office since April 2014, had announced that France’s already existing Vigipirate anti-terror surveillance plan had been raised to its highest level of alert attentat -- terror alert.\n\nThe terrorists -- it still was not known if two or three gunman had attacked the Charlie Hebdo offices -- were on the run. They were dangerous and were not to be confronted. A number to call was given should they be spotted.\n\nThe story was that two gunmen had burst into a room where the satirical weekly was having its first editorial meeting of the year. The journalists in the room that included the editor, Stéphane \"Charb\" Charbonnier, 48, and in the post since 2009, having heard something which they had interpreted as Christmas fire-crackers going off outside in the corridor, thought that the two men in black, masked and wearing bullet-proof vests, and brandishing firearms was a prank the staff was playing on them. Then, one of the gunmen had called out the editor’s name and when Charb responded, the gunmen had shot him in the head.\n\nShot dead in that room were not only Charb but eight of his editorial staff. One was a woman, Elsa Cayat, 54, a psychoanalyst and columnist. Also dead in the room was Charb’s bodyguard, police officer Franck Brinsolaro of the Police Protection Service, 49, who had been assigned to protect Charb 24/7 when in 2013 al-Qaeda had put him on its list for assassination.\n\nAlso shot dead was a maintenance worker, Frédéric Boisseau, 42, from the company Sodexo, who was sitting at the reception desk when the two killers had burst into the building. It was the shot fired at him which the editorial staff had heard.\n\nThe two gunmen, their murderous work done, had then run from the building to a small black parked car and in the police chase which had followed the two gunman, having jumped from their car, had shot dead a police officer, Ahmed Merabet, 42, a Muslim of Algerian descent.\n\nOfficer Merabet’s killing was filmed from the window of an apartment overlooking the scene.\n\nShown on television and on-line he was seen lying, already wounded, on the sidewalk, holding up his left arm in a pleading gesture as one of the gunmen aimed and fired an AK-47 at his head.\n\nA short exchange of words between the gunman and the officer was recorded as follows:\n\nGunman: “Did you want to kill me?”\n\nOfficer Merabet: “No, it’s good, chief.”\n\nThe scene of the actual shooting of the officer was cut from the visual report, but it later circulated on-line causing a degree of debate because there was no damage to the officer to be seen, not even blood, and gun experts pointed out that a shot from an AK-47 would blow anyone’s head into pieces.\n\nThere were also reports which were later dropped that Officer Merabet had identified himself to the gunman as being a Muslim.\n\nOffice Merabet lying lifeless on the sidewalk, the two terrorists, had run back to their car, calling out, “We have avenged the Prophet Muhammad! We have killed Charlie Hebdo!”\n\nIncredible as it will appear, the gunmen, their car in no way powerful, had then thrown off the chasing police vehicle and having abandoned their car a while later, they had hijacked another, forcing the driver out at gunpoint, and had disappeared into the late winter afternoon.\n\nIn the night which followed dozens of shocked Parisians holding lit candles or flowers stood as near to the Charlie Hebdo building as the police would allow them: officers from the police’s forensics sector were inside and around the building gathering evidence.\n\nAs for the other Parisians and the few Festive Season tourists still in the city, they stayed indoors. They feared another attack because military experts had pointed out that the killers must have received military training somewhere, perhaps in Syria or Iraq, because they had carried out their killing with military precision, and that they were bound to attack again. One military expert pointed out that there must be a third gunman who had waited in the car. “They would not have left the car unattended,” he said.\n\nBy then the two terrorist gunmen had been named: one of them had either deliberately dropped his identification card in the car or it had fallen from a pocket without him having been aware of it.\n\nThe two were brothers: Chérif Kouachi, 32, and Saïd Kouachi, 34. Both were French-born of Algerian descent.\n\nAnother name was released. Mourad Hamyd, 18, was said to have been either with the two gunmen and had waited for them in their car, or he had given them logistic assistance.\n\nAt midnight Hamyd accompanied by his father walked into a police station: he was at school while the killing was going on and this was corroborated by his teacher and the pupils in his class. He was in his final year at school, and there being no reason for his arrest, he was released.\n\nAs for the two Kouachi brothers, at 10 o’clock on the morning after their attack on Charlie Hebdo they would pull up at a gas station 30 miles north of Paris. Holding up the attendant, who would describe them to police, they demanded gas and food from its small self-service and left with the cash the man had.\n\nJe suis Charlie\n\nThat day -- Thursday, January 8 -- Parisians began to hold up a white-on-black slogan Je suis Charlie - \"I am Charlie.\" They were doing so not only in sympathy for the victims but also in deviance to show that France was a democracy.\n\nTelevision networks adopted the slogan too.\n\nThe slogan was created by Joachim Roncin, an artist and music journalist with the free magazine Stylist.\n\nWhen even France’s Prime Minister, Manuel Vals, carried a sign with the slogan into an emergency meeting of the cabinet at the presidential Élysées Palace, Roncin told the media that he had created the sign because, “I just got the idea because I’ve been reading the series of children’s books created by the English illustrator Martin Handord with my son.”\n\nHe had tweeted the slogan already at 12:52 p.m. the previous day.\n\nThe series of children’s books he was referring to is titled Where’s Wally? in the United States and in Canada as Where’s Waldo? Here in France the series is titled Où est Charlie? -Where is Charlie?\n\nCharlie Hebdo got its name in November 1970 after the then French government had banned a satirical magazine entitled Hara-Kiri which had joked about the death of the World War Two hero, General Charles de Gaulle, who had held the office of President of France twice in the period from 1959/1969. Some of the Hara-Kiri staff had then launched another satirical magazine under the title Charlie Hebdo. The \"Charlie\" derived both from the cartoon character Charlie Brown from Peanuts and from General Charles de Gaulle. Hebdo is short for hebdomadaire -- weekly.\n\nFurther killing\n\nThe Parisians despite not admitting it when foreign reporters pushed microphones into their faces continued to be certain that there were going to be further terrorist attacks in their city. Announcements in the Métro underground rail network, in French and in English, to report suspicious behavior and parcels which looked abandoned, did not calm their nerves.\n\nIndeed, when early on Thursday morning news came that there had been another fatal shooting, they were sure that they were in for a very rough time.\n\nClarissa Jean-Philippe, 27, a trainee policewoman from the French Caribbean island of Martinique, was attending a minor traffic accident in the community of Montrouge southwest of Paris when a man dressed in black and wearing a bulletproof vest but who was not masked, jumped from a small car and while running towards her blasted her with what an eyewitness described as “not a big gun because he held it with just one hand.”\n\nAs the policewoman was with the municipal police she was unarmed. (Municipal police fall under the local town halls and they are mainly traffic controllers and keepers of the peace, having to summon the state police when a situation looks as if it going to get out of control.)\n\nThe wounded policewoman on the ground, two male passersby tackled the shooter as he was running back to his small car. One of the men, a street sweeper, was in turn gunned down.\n\nIn the confusion which followed, the shooter raced off, the car to be found abandoned later in the day.\n\nThe seriously-wounded policewoman and street sweeper were rushed to hospital. The life of the latter could be saved. The policewoman’s life could not.\n\nThe confusion which had been at the killing scene -- a bystander had described it as “panic” -- continued, the police trying to establish whether the shooter had been involved in the car accident to which the policewoman had been summoned, and indeed whether there had been more than one shooter. The police could not or would not say whether there was a connection between the Charlie Hebdo and the Montrouge shootings. Media reports did however describe the Montrouge shooter as of “African origin.”\n\nOn the morning of Friday, two days after the fatal Charlie Hebdo shooting and 24 hours after that of the policewoman, a cell-phone call to the police alerted them to a shooting and hostage taking at a kosher supermarket, the Hyper Cacher, on the eastern border of Paris at Porte de Vincennes. The caller was in the store and had grabbed the opportunity to call the police when the attention of the man who had just then burst into the store had been averted. The man, dressed in black trousers and a short-sleeved gray t-shirt and wearing a bullet-proof vest but was not masked, was brandishing several firearms. He was of African origin.\n\nInstantly, the Paris police unit RAID (Recherche, Assistance, Intervention, Dissuasion - Research, Assistance, Intervention, Deterrence), who had also been called out to the two previous shootings, were on site, and also the FIPN (Force d’intervention de la police nationale -- Intervention Force of the National Police). They blocked off the road, halted public transport running through the area, locked down the schools, and ordered all shops in the area to close. The police also ordered all shops in Paris’s Jewish quarter, the Marais, to close.\n\nEarlier that morning Paris’s Préfecture de Police (Police Headquarters) had issued a Call For Witnesses. The police were looking for two individuals: a man and a woman, considered armed and dangerous. They were wanted in connection with the shooting in Montrouge.\n\nThe two were Amedy Coulibaly, 33, of Malian descent, and Hayat Boumeddiene, 27, of Algerian descent. Boumeddienne was Coulibaly’s common-law wife: the couple were religiously married, but in France a marriage is only legal if it had been performed by a mayor at a town hall, so French law did not consider the two legally husband and wife.\n\nSoon the police confirmed that the man holding the people hostage in the store was Coulibaly. The latter had identified himself as such to those he was holding hostage. Whether Boumeddienne was in the store with him the police again could not, or would not, say.\n\nThe police reported that at least one person had been shot dead when the assailant had burst into the store which was busy in the wake of the start of the Jewish Sabbath.\n\nNo sooner had the news been reported that another terrorist attack was under way in Paris, than news broke that the two Kouachi brothers had been involved in a shoot-out with police and that the two were holed up in a printing warehouse in the small community of Dammartin-en-Goële (8,000 inhabitants), 22 miles northeast from Paris and six miles from Charles de Gaulle International Airport -- and not far from where they had held up the gas station. Saïd, the younger of the two, had been slightly wounded in the neck.\n\nThe two were holding one or two hostages according to reports.\n\nAt 5 p.m., night having fallen, a cold wind sweeping over the countryside and the temperature hardly above freezing, heavily-armed police stormed both the printing warehouse in Dammartin-en-Goële and the kosher supermarket in Paris.\n\nSome reporters said later that the order to the police to attack was a joint decision of President Hollande, Prime Minister Vals and Interior Minister Cazeneuve and they had made the decision because the two Kouachi brothers had burst from the warehouse’s entrance, guns blazing.\n\nFor the Dammartin-en-Goële attack the militarized Gendarmerie was in charge, its GIGN (Groupe d’intervention de la Gendarmerie nationale -- National Gendarmerie Intervention Group) in action. The GIGN is the Gendarmerie’s equivalent of the state police’s RAID. Assisting the GIGN was the FIPN already in action in Paris at the Porte de Vincennes.\n\nThe Kouachi brothers went down under a hail of fire and in Paris the moment the police stormed the kosher supermarket making an ear-splitting noise with explosions, Coulibaly, in full battle dress, an AKS-74U assault rifle in his hands, sprinted to the glass doors of the entrance, but went down instantly under FIPN fire.\n\nInside the store four hostages, all Jewish men, lay dead. Coulibaly had shot them when he had burst into the store that morning.\n\nSome of the survivors had hidden in a walk-in freezer in the basement having been led there by one of the store’s employees, Lassana Bathily, 24. The latter a Mali immigrant, and a Muslim, is today a hero because having seen the hostages safe in the freezer which he had switched off, he crawled through a tiny service exit and ran to the police who at first thought he was a terrorist and hurled him down to the ground, sitting on him to handcuff him. He told the police what the interior of the shop looked like and even drew maps of the interior for them.\n\nBathily has for some years been trying unsuccessfully to obtain French nationality. He has now been given French nationality and his new passport will be handed to him in a short televised ceremony.\n\n“Following the acts of bravery by Mr. Bathily during the hostage taking in the Hyper Casher market on January 9, the Interior Ministry has fast-tracked his request for citizenship,” read a statement issued by the Interior Ministry.\n\nOne hostage Bathily had led to the basement had his baby with him. Another had his young child with him.\n\nA few days after their ordeal, having recovered slightly, some of the hostages spoke to the media. Those who had been in the basement freezer told of how they had all desperately tried to keep the two children from crying so as not to alert the gunman of their presence. They also told of how Coulibaly had, on entering the store, asked one of the store’s customers what his name was. The man had obligingly told Coulibaly his first name. Coulibaly then said that he wanted to know his surname and when the man told him, he cold-bloodedly shot him in the head.\n\nOn the same day as the Charlie Hebdo attack the non-fatal shooting of a jogger in a park outside the community of Fontenay-aux-Roses, southwest of Paris, had received little media attention. At 8 that night the jogger, 32, had knocked on the door of a house and had asked the homeowner to summon the police because he had been shot: he was shot in the shoulder and he did not know his assailant but he told the police that he was un type européen -- white. Because of that description the police did not link the shooting to the two Kouachi brothers, and indeed not later to Coulibaly. Now though the shooting has been linked to Coulibaly because ballistic tests conducted on five bullet cartridges found at the site in Fontenay-aux-Roses matched the Russian automatic Tokarev pistol which Coulibaly had used in the supermarket and which he had left behind along with the arsenal of firearms and firebombs he had in his possession.\n\nTherefore, the Fontenay-aux-Roses assailant is still being sought by the police.\n\nBoumeddienne, Coulibaly’s common law wife, was also nowhere to be found, but she was soon traced to Istanbul airport. On Friday, January 2, the airport’s short circuit spy cameras had filmed her and a man checking through customs after having arrived on a flight from Madrid, Spain. The two -- he has been identified -- are now thought to have made their way from Istanbul to join ISIS in Syria.\n\nReasons\n\nWhile the French are asking themselves why some young first generation French hate them so much, the family backgrounds of the two Kouachis and Coulibaly receive much media attention.\n\nCoulibaly, born just outside Paris, was the only son to a Malian immigrant family of 10 children. At the age of 17 he had started off on a life of armed robbery and drug dealing for which he had gone to jail, having met Chérif Kouachi during one of his incarcerations, then becoming friends also with Saïd Kouachi.\n\nIn a video released on-line on the morning of Sunday, January 11, he pledged allegiance to ISIS -- Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- and claimed that the attacks had been coordinated by himself and his “brothers” in “retribution” for what is done to “Palestinians in Gaza and Muslims in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.”\n\nHe said, rather incomprehensibly: “What we are doing is completely legitimate given what they are doing. You cannot attack and not expect retribution so you are playing the victim as if you don’t understand what’s happening.”\n\nHe continued: “The brothers of our team were split into two groups. I went out a bit against the police. If we did things a bit together and a bit separately it was to have more impact.”\n\nThe two Kouachis, born in Paris’s working-class 10tharrondissement (district), had a youth of smoking pot, drinking beer, making and dancing to rap music, and of dead-end jobs and jail for hold-ups. In jail Cherif, the younger brother, had become radicalized with resulted in another jail term when he was arrested on his way to Charles de Gaulle Airport to fly to Syria. Saïd too had become radicalised, but he got married and fathered two children.\n\nThe police having somehow decided that the two brothers were no longer a danger to society when Saïd got married and fathered two children, had stopped keeping on an eye on them.\n\nIt has now been reported that in the time when police were no longer watching them they had set off for Yemen where they had received military training, training which they had made use of in their attack on Charlie Hebdo.\n\nAccording to some media reports during the attack on the magazine they had said that they were with “al-Qaeda in Yemen.” It is thought that they were referring to another Islamist movement - AQAP (al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) which has after the death of Osama Bin Laden been under the control of Nasser al-Wuhayshi, 38, of Yemen. (http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/08/aqap_emir_also_serve.php)\n\nAQAP has since confirmed in a video entitled “A message regarding the blessed battle of Paris” that it had through the two Kouachis carried out the Charlie Hebdo attack.\n\nSaid one of its leaders, Nasr al-Ansi, in the video: “We, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, claim responsibility for this operation as vengeance for the messenger of Allah.”\n\nThat the two Kouachis were linked to al-Qaeda while Coulibaly was linked to ISIS, yet they had coordinated their terrorist attacks, has confirmed that the various Islamist groups despite being rivals do work together. They are rivals in that all are competing for the same funding sources and are vying with each other to win followers among the same nationalities.\n\nPolice are still investigating who had filmed the Coulibaly video, but as he referred to the shooting of the policewoman, and indeed to the Charlie Hebdo attack, it was filmed after those attacks. In other words on or around Thursday night.\n\nThe French and religion\n\nSince France’s 1789 Revolution and its Déclaration des droits de l’homme et du citoyen– \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen,\" freedom of religion has been guaranteed French citizens. Reinforced in 1905 with the \"Separation of the Churches and the State\" law it means that in France the Church has no right in State affairs and the State has no right in Church affairs. The Church in question is the Roman Catholic Church, which along with Judaism, were the only religions practised at the time of the French Revolution.\n\nFrance is therefore a secular country: here in France the word laïque is used. This means that France’s laïcite -- separation of church and state -- allows French citizens total freedom regarding religion.\n\nTherefore, today in France a child receives religious instruction only if the child attends a Catholic or Jewish or Muslim school. In fact, if a teacher in a State school speaks to a child of God the teacher can be dismissed. It also means that France’s head of state is not allowed to deliver a eulogy or sermon in any place of religion - Catholic church, Protestant temple, mosque or synagogue.\n\nAlso because of the country’s laïcité excessive signs of religion -- like a woman wearing the hijab -- are forbidden in France. This is something France’s Muslims find difficult to understand and obey.\n\n(Despite that the classification of people by their religion, or the color of their skin, is also not allowed, a 2011 survey showed that Christianity is the dominant religion in the country with 44 percent of the French being Christian. Of these 41 percent are Roman Catholic, 1 percent Protestant, and the remaining 2 percent belongs to the other Christian churches like the Greek or Russian Orthodox churches. The percentage of agnostics is 29 percent and the percentage of atheists is 13 percent. Two per cent is Muslims and 1 percent is Buddhist, and 1 percent is Jewish, and the remaining 10 percent are French who say that they are not one thing or another.)\n\nOf the Muslims of whom there are about 6 million, 75 percent are believers but only 41 percent practice their religion. (France had experienced an influx of Muslims after the independence of her African colonies which had begun in the 1950s.)\n\nNo one knows what percentage of the 41 percent thinks that Charlie Hebdo should have be silenced. In other words the government should have banned it. Or ban it now.\n\nAlways had only a small following\n\nCharlie Hebdo has been losing money for some time. A few months ago it even appealed to its readers -- a measly 60,000 -- for donations in order to keep going. Having started publication in 1969 it already had to close for lack of funds in 1981 but had managed to restart publication in 1992.\n\nNever popular, often disliked, the weekly featured cartoons and jokes, no individual and no religion, untouchable.\n\nIn 2014 Charlie Hebdo had a go at President François Hollande after the French gossip magazine Closer had published on its cover photos of him visiting a French actress at night when he had a live-in lover, the journalist Valérie Trierweiler, known then as France’s “First Lady” and she receiving an allowance from the State as such.\n\nCloser had snapped the President riding pillion on a scooter to an apartment he and the actress were using as a love nest and he was wearing a crash helmet as the law required and which conveniently made it possible for him to hide his face from passersby when out on his nightly love shenanigans.\n\nCharlie Hebdo’s cover showed a cartoon of a topless Trierweiler holding up a banner that read phallocratie -- male chauvinism -- and over her naked torso were written the words \"Fuck the Macho.\"\n\nAnother 2014 Charlie Hebdo cover after Closer’s revelation showed President Hollande in a suit but his penis in the air and the penis saying, “Moi, Président” referring to how during his presidential campaign in 2012 he had always begun speeches with, “Moi, Président” -- When I am President.\n\nThe news weekly Nouvel Observateur had then asked its readers whether the satirical magazine had not gone too far and its readers had massively replied “oui” - yes.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad and Islam were however Charlie Hebdo’s pet subjects for ridicule.\n\nIn July 2013 the magazine’s cover showed the Prophet Muhammad holding the Koran in front of him for protection against bullets being fired at him but a bullet hitting him all he same. Written on the red cover were the words, “Tuerie en Egypte” and “Le Coran c’est de la merde” and “Ça n’arrête pas les balles” an arrow under the last pointing to the Koran meaning that the Koran could not stop bullets. (Translation: \"Death in Egypt, The Koran is Shit, and This Doesn’t Stop Bullets.”)\n\nChristianity also received its fair share of ridicule. As recently as December of 2014, the cover showed a spread-eagled Virgin Mary giving birth to Jesus under the heading, “Le veritable histoire du Petit Jésus” - The True story of Little Jesus.\n\nIn 2011, because of such cartoons, the magazine’s offices were firebombed and in 2012 its website was hacked and when the magazine republished the cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad from the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten the Great Mosque of Paris and the Union of Islamic Organisations of France failed in their bid to sue the magazine for blasphemy, the French court having ruled that the cartoons had not incited religious hatred.\n\nNow, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo and on Hyper Kosher and a great show of solidarity manifested on Sunday, January 11, when 3.7 million people and 50 world leaders, 1.5 million of the people in Paris, had marched in France holding up Je suis Charlie signs, a few voices are beginning to be heard and they ask if Charlie Hebdo had not gone too far with its cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad: If there is not a point where satire stops and disrespect begins.\n\nBurial and a new issue of Charlie Hebdo\n\nThose who had lost their lives have been laid to rest.\n\nThe Jews were buried in Israel. The Charlie Hebdo staff in their respective villages or towns. The policemen in theirs: they had been awarded France’s highest honour, the Légion d’honneur -- Legion of Honor.\n\nIn the darkness of the night of Friday, January 16, Saïd Kouachi was buried in the cemetery of the town of Reims where he had lived with his wife and two children. His wife and mother were at the graveside: both had condemned his act.\n\nChérif Kouachi was buried on Saturday, January 17, in the cemetery of the Paris community of Gennevilliers, the last place where he had lived. He was also buried after night had fallen. Not one of his relatives or friends had attended his funeral.\n\nNeither the mayor of Gennevilliers or of Reims wanted the two terrorists buried in their communities but French law forces a mayor to allow someone who had lived in the community to be buried in its cemetery.\n\nThe two graves will remain unmarked to prevent them being vandalised or from becoming Muslim shrines.\n\nNo one knows where Coulibaly will be buried, but there is a rumor that his body will be flown to Mali to be buried there.\n\nCharlie Hebdo’s post-attack edition, published on Wednesday, January 14, sold out within 10 minutes of its appearances on the shelves at 6 in the morning. The magazine’s surviving staff had printed one million copies for French distribution only and these having been sold out immediately they had another two million printed. When those had also sold out within hours of being put on the shelves, it was announced that another four million in five languages will be printed. The magazine is selling for €3 ($3.50).\n\nThe magazine yet again had a go at the Prophet Mohammad. He is on the green cover, crying and holding up a Je suis Charlie sign. Above him is written, \"Tout est pardonné\"- All is forgiven.\n\nOn Sunday, January 18, France’s Sunday paper Journal du Dimanche reported that in a poll they had held 42 percent of French people thought that cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad should not be published. However, 57 percent thought that they should. One per cent had no opinion.\n\nRespecting France’s 1789 \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\" the paper did not give a breakdown of the religion of those they had polled.\n\nAnd now?\n\nWhile mosques and synagogues, and Jewish schools, are guarded by heavily-armed police and soldiers, kosher and halal shops are not and they are being vandalised. The words \"sale juif\" --dirty Jew - have been painted on some of the kosher ones and cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad on some of the halal ones. A doctor known in his village as a Muslim but who is married to a Catholic woman even found a pig’s ear on their front lawn. He told a television network that their little daughter cries at night because she is scared that terrorists will come to kill them.\n\nFive days after General Lee surrendered to General Grant at Appomattox, ending the Civil War, John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Lincoln at Ford's Theatre.\n\nby Cal Schoonover\n\nBy the time President Abraham Lincoln and his party arrived at Ford’s Theatre, the play Our American Cousin had already begun. Lincoln, along with his wife Mary and two other guests, Major Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris, had a box reserved for them. As the party made its appearance, the play was stopped and the tune \"Hail to the Chief \"began. The crowd rose and applauded the President as his group made its way to the awaiting box. Lincoln nodded and waved to the crowd of his admirers.\n\nOnce the President was seated, the play resumed. It was just after 8:30 p.m. and Lincoln, although exhausted, was anxious to relax and enjoy the play. The last few years had been rough not only on President Lincoln and his family, but the country as well. In April, 1861 the Civil War began and turned the nation into complete chaos. Brother against brother, father against son and neighbor against neighbor. The devastating effect of the Civil War cost the country over 600,000 lives. The war ended just five days prior on April 9 and the night of April 14, Good Friday, Lincoln was looking forward to putting his thoughts of war to rest.\n\nA few minutes before 10 p.m. the play was near the half-way point and it was around this time that legendary actor John Wilkes Booth entered the saloon next door and ordered a whiskey. After finishing his drink, Booth exited the saloon and walked over to Ford’s Theatre. As he entered he made his way up stairs. Upon arriving at the top of the stairs, Booth saw the balcony was filled with people. There were several people standing against the wall Booth noted and after a few minutes of looking around, he made his way across the rear circle. “I walked with a firm step through a thousand of his friends,” Booth would later write in his diary.\n\nNearing the door to the presidential box, Booth encountered Charles Forbes, Lincoln’s personal valet. Forbes had taken a seat just outside of the box and when Booth approached, Forbes stood and Booth handed him something. While it is not known for sure what Booth handed Forbes, it has been assumed by historians and writers that it was Booth’s personal calling card. Either way, Forbes looked at it and allowed Booth to proceed into the box. Booth entered the box and waited for the right moment to strike.\n\nPresident Lincoln sat in a rocking chair directly beyond the door and was in the perfect position for Booth. Having only a matter of seconds to act, Booth had to make his attempt count and as he took a step forward, he drew his derringer from his vest. He cocked the hammer on the pistol and slowly approached behind Lincoln.\n\nAs he stepped forward, he raised the derringer to Lincoln’s head. Booth was less than two feet away when he squeezed the trigger. The loud explosion came and the lead ball the size of the tip of a finger tore through the back of Lincoln’s head. The President slumped in his chair and Major Rathbone leaped from his seat toward the assassin. While the two struggled, the theater grew quite. The sharp scream let out by Mary Lincoln startled the audience and gave an indication something was terribly wrong.\n\nBesides being armed with the derringer, Booth also had a large knife. He drew the knife and began slashing at Major Rathbone as the major tried to stop him from exiting the box. Rathbone received a deep wound between “the shoulder and elbow.” Booth was able to free himself from the major’s grip and he leaped over the banister of the presidential box and onto the stage. History tells us here that Booth broke his ankle as he landed, but there is evidence to contradict this theory and it is more probable that Booth actually broke his leg when his horse fell while making his escape from Washington.\n\nUpon landing on the stage, Booth regained his balance and ran across the stage shouting “Sic Semper Tyrannis” (\"Thus always to tyrants\") and exited the back door. Booth’s horse was waiting, so his escape was rather easy. Making his way across town, Booth arrived at the Navy Yard Bridge that goes into Maryland and when he was allowed to pass by Sgt. Cobb, Booth was on the run and the chase for Lincoln’s killer was about to begin.\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth's gun\n\nBack at Ford’s Theatre, the President was being looked after by a young army surgeon named Charles Leale. Upon entering the presidential box he later wrote, “As I looked at Lincoln he appeared dead. His eyes were closed and his head had fallen forward.” Leale felt for a pulse but could not find one and chose to lay Lincoln on the floor. As he did so, he saw his hand that had been on the back of the President’s head had blood on it. Not knowing where exactly the wound was or for that matter what exactly caused the wound, Leale used a pen-knife and started cutting away Lincoln’s collar and then split his shirt open from his neck down.\n\nWhen no wound was found, Leale lifted one of Lincoln’s eyelids and noted the left eye was dilated, which is an indication of a brain injury. Leale ran his fingers through Lincoln’s hair and finally found the wound. Behind Lincoln’s left ear was a small round hole which had begun to clot at this time. Leale carefully removed the clot and suddenly Lincoln began breathing again. “The history of surgery fails to record a recovery from such a fearful wound and I have never seen or heard of any person with such a wound, and injury to the sinus of the brain and to the brain itself, who lived even for an hour,” Leale wrote in his 1909 account. He then stated “His wound is mortal; it is impossible for him to recover.”\n\nIt was suggested by someone in the crowd to move Lincoln to the White House. However, fearing the long and bumpy ride back would cause more damage to Lincoln, that idea was disregarded. Leale knew he had to get Lincoln out of the theater and fast. When Lincoln’s breathing became steady, he would have Lincoln moved “to the nearest house.”\n\nWhile Leale was tending to Lincoln, two other doctors arrived to help. They were Dr. Charles S. Taft and Dr. Albert F. A. King. Dr. Leale “expressed the desire to have the President taken, as soon as he had gained sufficient strength.” When that time came, Dr. Taft was assigned by Leale to “carry his right shoulder, Dr. King to carry his left shoulder and detailed a sufficient number of others” to assist in carrying the President. They lifted Lincoln’s body and made their way through the heavy crowd and once outside the theater, Lincoln’s body was brought across the street to the home of William Petersen. Petersen had been standing on his porch as Lincoln’s body was brought out and he yelled for them to bring Lincoln inside. Once inside the house, the men carried Lincoln into a small bedroom located at the far end of the hallway.\n\nThe bed located in the room was too small for Lincoln’s 6-foot 4-inch frame so he was laid diagonally. The bed was pulled away from the wall as well, making it easier for the doctors to maneuver around the bed since the little room had filled with members of Lincoln’s cabinet. Dr. Leale did his best to make the President as comfortable as possible, knowing there was nothing more that could be done. “It is not probable that the President will live through the night,” wrote Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton.\n\nThe room was ordered cleared by Dr. Leale except for medical personnel who needed to continue to treat Lincoln. When Lincoln’s breathing became labored again another clot was removed from Lincoln’s wound. In Dr. Leale’s 1909 account, he doesn’t say how he removed the blood clots, but in his original 1867 report Leale writes “I passed the little finger of my left hand through the perfectly smooth opening made by the ball…” He continued with “when I removed my finger which I used as a knife an oozing of blood followed…”\n\nShortly after the assassination, Mary Lincoln sent word to have the President’s personal physician, Dr. Robert King Stone, examine her husband. Dr. Stone stated in May, 1865, “I proceeded to examine the President, and found that he received a gun-shot wound in the back part of the left side of his head, into which I carried my finger.” Historians and students of modern medicine today debate weather Lincoln could have survived his wound had treating doctors not stuck their fingers into his brain. While fingers to the brain most definanitly caused damage and likely infection, chances are the President would have died given due to the medical profession's limited knowledge about brain injuries.\n\nSecretary Stanton moved to the back parlor and began issuing orders and taking witness statements. Within two hours of taking testimony there was enough evidence to order the arrest of John Wilkes Booth. “It is now ascertained with reasonable certainty that two assassins were engaged in the horrible crime, Wilkes Booth being the one that shot the president,” Stanton wrote. The other assassin, who at this time was not known, was Lewis Thornton Powell, who had attacked Secretary of State William H. Seward the night of Lincoln’s assassination.\n\nAs the night wore on, Lincoln’s breathing became labored. At 7:22 a.m., April 15, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln died. He was the first President to be assassinated.\n\nThe people in the death room were in grim silence. It wasn’t until Stanton asked the doctor to say a few words that the silence was broke. Stanton then spoke his famous words, “Now he belongs to the ages.”\n\nSome people closest to Lincoln blamed themselves for allowing him to be killed. General James H. Van Alen, in a letter to the President, asked him not to attend the theater. Lincoln, on the day of the assassination, responded to Alen with a letter. “My Dear Sir: I intend to adopt the advice of my personal friends and use precaution…”\n\nThe Chase\n\nThe manhunt was well under way by the time the public was notified of Lincoln’s death. Booth along with his co-conspirator David Herold, rode their horses about 13 miles into Maryland to their first stop. The destination was Surratt’s Tavern, owned by Mary Surratt. It was at Surratt’s Tavern that Booth, along with Herold, Powell and John Surratt, Mary’s son, plotted kidnapping Lincoln as recently as March 1865. There Booth and Herold picked up supplies; included were two carbines and shells. Whiskey was also a must for the ailing Booth.\n\nAfter picking up what they needed, the two men rode on and sought out medical treatment for Booth. They arrived at a small community called Beantown and two miles beyond that, was the farm of Dr. Samuel Mudd. Booth and Herold arrived at the farm around 4 a.m. and knocked on the door, waking the Mudd family. When the door was answered by Mudd, who was dressed in a long nightshirt and holding a candle. Herold spoke first, he explained to the doctor his friend was hurt after his horse fell. A few feet away, sitting on his horse sat Booth.\n\nThe two men were asked to step inside and upon examining Booth’s leg, Mudd determined it was broken and asked Herold to help get the injured Booth upstairs to one of the bedrooms. Mudd set Booth’s leg with a splint and allowed him to rest for the night. The two men rested for the night and later in the day of April 15, Dr. Mudd had to ride into town. According to Mudd, it was there he learned of Lincoln’s assassination and then it may have clicked to him about his 4 a.m. visit. Leaving town as quickly as possible without causing suspicion, Mudd went back to his farm.\n\nWhen Dr. Mudd arrived he told the two men about the soldiers in town and asked the men to leave his farm. Abraham Lincoln was not poplar in the Mudd home, but Mudd did not want to be tied to Lincoln’s murder. However, not wanting to betray Booth, Mudd gave the two men a few names of people that could aid their escape. The two men left and it was not long after that the Federal authorities had been on the move south and they soon learned Dr. Mudd had treated a person fitting Booth’s description. A search of Mudd’s house revealed a boot with the initials J.W.B scratched on the inside. Dr. Mudd was later arrested and taken into custody for his role in harboring the assassin.\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth\n\nHerold, who knew the country better than Booth, led them toward Virginia where they thought they would be safe. Over the next several days, the two men stopped at one of the houses Dr. Mudd had mentioned to them. It was the home of Samuel Cox. Herold knocked on the door while Booth waited on his horse. When Cox answered, he claimed he had a sense something was wrong. After talking to Herold for a few minutes, Cox did not believe what Herold told him. Booth pleaded with Cox for help and finally Cox invited the two men in for rest.\n\nA few hours later, Cox knew it was not safe for his two guests to stay, so he told them he would hide them in a pine thicket. Cox assured the two men they would be safe there and no one would think to look for them there. It had been two days since the assassination and the two fugitives knew they could not stay in one location for long. Cox had his overseer lead the two men to safety and assured them someone would be along to help aid their escape.\n\nAt the pine thicket, Booth and Herold tied off their horses and rolled out their blankets on the damp ground. The two men were exhausted from their travels and could not do anything now but wait. When the sun started shining, Booth woke and started writing in his diary.\n\nThomas Jones, a friend of Samuel Cox, arrived at the pine thicket to aid Booth and Herold. Jones, during the Civil War was a master at navigating the Potomac River. On more than one occasion Jones ran Confederate spies, supplies and mail across the river. Avoiding detectionfrom the patrolling Union Army, Jones was considered one of the better Confederate agents in the Maryland area.\n\nJones told Booth and Herold he would help them, but they needed to wait until he felt it was safe enough to cross into Virginia. Jones stressed to the two men they must wait in the pine thicket for however long it takes. Booth did not like hearing this, but knew he had little choice.\n\nAfter five days in the pine thicket, Jones saw the time was right and put his plan in action. After dark on April, 20, Jones met up again with Booth and Herold. He led the two fugitives out of the pine thicket and down a public road, walking slowly and carefully doing their best to avoid detection. Finally, Jones arrived back at his own farm and retrieved food for the men. The men ate and Jones then led them down to the river where a small boat was waiting.\n\nJones and Herold helped Booth get settled into the boat. Once Herold was in, the two men started off again on their own. Herold grabbed the oars and rowed toward the Virginia shore, two miles away. Herold rowed the boat for more than five hours before realizing something was wrong. At the mouth of a creek the two men could see a farm Herold recognized. The bad news was they were still in Maryland. The two fugitives had been turned around and Herold was exhausted from rowing all night.\n\nBooth was frustrated. Like he had done just after the assassination, he wrote his thoughts down in his diary: “After being hunted like a dog through swamps, woods, and last night being chased by gun boats till I was forced to return wet cold and starving, with every mans (sic) hand against me, I am here in despair. And why; for doing what Brutus was honored for... And yet I for striking down a greater tyrant than ever knew am looked upon as a common cutthroat.”\n\nHerold ended up going ashore and meeting up with a friend, who provided food and sent them on their way. This was Friday, April 21. One the evening of April, 23, Herold made another stop at a person’s home who his last contact mentioned. She was a 39–year-old widow named Elizabeth Quesenberry and she was a Confederate signal agent during the war. She prepared food for Herold, never setting eyes on Booth, and sent Herold away.\n\nAfter Booth and Herold finished their meal, the two men met up with a man named Thomas Harbin, who arranged to get horses for them. Harbin led the two men to a few more locations before parting company. Booth and Herold were finally in Virginia.\n\nThe End of the Chase\n\nTheir next stop was at a small tobacco farm near Port Royal, Virginia, owned by the Garrett family. The farm's owner, Richard Garrett, met the two men and allowed them to take shelter in his barn. However, as the night continued, fearing the two men who he felt acted odd, would steel his horses he locked the barn door. Booth and Herold were trapped. Little did anyone know, Federal troopers were only thre"
