Dr. Beehler was born Nov. 6, 1946, in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on his mother’s birthday, which he often said was the best birthday present she ever received. He grew up in Fairhaven, Minnesota, and graduated high school in nearby Kimball. He attended St. Cloud State University for seven years, where he excelled playing bass guitar at many rock ’n’ roll shows. After all his schooling, he wanted even more knowledge. He then graduated medical school in Kirksville, Missouri, as a doctor of osteopathic medicine. He went on to become an amazing family physician, delivering most the babies in his new hometown of Sauk Centre, Minnesota. He later became a dedicated and well-respected emergency medicine physician.\n\nDr. Beehler met Mary, his wife, while working in Sauk Centre, and they spent 37 years with each other. They enjoyed numerous activities together including stained glass and Costco shopping, and he even became her meticulous sous chef. He prided himself in his vegetable slicing skills. Together they raised four kids, Jessica, Jay, Amanda, and Elise, and their journey brought them to Arizona and eventually back to Detroit Lakes. Three of his four kids remain in Detroit Lakes and that was always a big point of pride for him. Their fourth child lives in sunny Arizona, which they gladly visited several times a year. He became president of the American Osteopathic Association in 2003 and was able to travel the world fulfilling his duties in places such as Ireland, Hawaii, and Switzerland. He continued to work as an emergency medicine physician in Park Rapids before eventually moving to Detroit Lakes.\n\nHis profession as a physician touched many lives, not only his patients, but co-workers as well, as he loved to teach and mentor to those around him. One of his greatest joys, besides Fox News, was his cabin on Buffalo Lake, and when he wasn’t working or doing any sort of home improvement project, he loved spending time at the cabin watching the sun rise over the lake. He created such a fun, loving environment that his family also loved to congregate up at the lake all summer long, despite the limited space. Everyone enjoyed his hospitality and vitality for life, and he will be greatly missed.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Mary; daughter, Jessica (Jon); son, Jay (Leah); daughter, Amanda (Mike); and daughter, Elise, as well as eight grandchildren (Adam, Zach, Macey, Griffin, Bennett, Addisyn, Asher, and Lauren), two brothers (Bryant R.

During his half century of work as a physician, he also served as medical director for not only Bay Osteopathic Hospital, but also several nursing homes, Heartland Hospice, and the Freeland Prison.

He liked to camp, fish, waterski, sail, and engage in a rigorous game of bridge or euchre. He and Rosemary moved to Victoria in 2006 where they have been active members of the Cordova Bay United Church and the 55+ Club. Always a true gentleman in all aspects of his life, he would never think of passing a stranger on the street and not give them a friendly smile and say hello.

His parents, Therese and Stephan, who immigrated to this country as teenagers, raised five children in New York Mills, a small town in central New York state. He was able to take his 86-year-old mother back to her “old country” in 1972 and visit there again with family in 2016. His zest for life showed in his patience, compassion, kindness, generosity, faith, and love toward his family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nEducation was always a goal for Dr. Dubiel and his children. After graduation from high school at 19, he joined the U.S. Navy and served aboard ship as a damage controlman for more than three years, during which time he actually sailed around the world – a much-told story with pictures and souvenirs. His formal education began with the GI Bill enabling him to receive a BS degree in physical education from Cortland State, followed by a March of Dimes scholarship to receive a certification in physical therapy from the University of Pennsylvania. After working for several years in a hospital, then as a sports medicine therapist, he once again attended school, this time graduating as an osteopathic physician and surgeon from ATSU-KCOM.\n\nAfter an internship in Grand Rapids, Michigan, he became a “country doc” in Grove City/Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, where he lived and worked for more than 20 years.

As a senior, he also captured the conference championship in the one-mile run.\n\nIt was at DePauw where he went on a double date that changed his life. In spring 1956, Dr. Hershberger and Jo Petry were on a double date but not with each other. It didn’t take long for him to discover that the love of his life was actually sitting diagonally from him rather than across the table. From there, he and Jo went on to marry, raise four children, share far more laughter than tears, and travel through all 50 states and several countries in Europe.

He had staff membership at Michiana Community Hospital and St. Joseph’s Medical Center in South Bend. A member of several professional organizations, he was active in his community and the Walkerton United Methodist Church.\n\nDr. Hershberger was never happier than when he was spending time with his family, especially at Lake Wawasee.

In November 2016, the Osteopathic Foundation of West Michigan announced a gift to the Richard G. and Patricia R. Huff Children’s Support Fund, a donor-advised fund of the Grand Haven Area Community Foundation. The gift was made in honor of Dr. Huff and his nearly 50-year career as a master practitioner and teacher of osteopathic manipulative medicine. Throughout his career, he treated thousands of western Michigan patients and trained many osteopathic residents who now treat patients nationwide.

This wonderful decision would define her life as she served Him and became a beautiful example of His unconditional love. Janet was incredibly smart and tutored countless students over the years in all disciplines of mathematics. She loved Michigan State athletics.

Wickens, DO, ’69, Clinton Township, Michigan, died Oct. 7, 2018, at age 74. He was born in Toronto, Canada, on Oct. 23, 1943, son of the late Dr. Arthur and Phyllis (Gurney) Wickens. From the start, he was blessed with a curious mind, keen sense of adventure, and irreverent sense of humor. As a young boy, an experiment disassembling a clock led him to wondering how the human body worked. Encouraged by his father, an osteopathic pathologist and cofounder at Mount Clemens General Hospital, Dr. Wickens followed his curiosity to Truman State University, where he earned a BS. He continued his education at ATSU-KCOM, earning a doctorate degree in 1969.\n\nDr. Wickens returned to Mt. Clemens for his residency and became an attending physician at Mount Clemens General Hospital. In 1981, he was named the hospital’s chief of staff. He later became a member of the Medical Staff Executive Committee and Corporate and Foundation Board and served as chair of the Intern and Resident Training Committee. He was a trainer for the Des Moines and Michigan State Osteopathic Colleges and University of Detroit-Mercy PA program and was appointed to the Governor of Michigan’s Prescription Drug and Opioid Abuse Commission.\n\nIn addition to his work at Mount Clemens General Hospital, Dr. Wickens held a private family practice as a general practitioner of osteopathic medicine in Macomb County for more than four decades. Throughout his lengthy career, he was affiliated with the Macomb County Osteopathic Society (1981 president), Michigan Osteopathic Physicians Association (state delegate for 20 years), and the American Osteopathic Association. He was board certified in family practice and by the American Board of Quality Assurance and Utilization Review. He was also the longtime attending physician at the Detroit Hydroplane Races. In his family practice, he was a true country doctor with a knack for being able to convey complex medical issues in layman terms. He delivered numerous children into the world and was always willing to offer counsel in times of need. He would often make house calls to his patients – stopping by just to check in, say hello, and share a cup of coffee at the kitchen table.\n\nThrough his distinguished medical career and beyond, Dr. Wickens was always looking to better understand the world around him. He was fascinated by nature, science, and history. He had a copy of the Warren Report that was full of tabs organizing the detailed notations he had made. He collected dozens of different versions of the Holy Bible to see how the texts might differ. In addition, he assembled binders full of clippings and notes on topics that he found to be important or interesting, covering just about every conceivable subject. He kept the most essential bits of information in his wallet – hand-written in near microscopic lettering. A selection of these notes includes highlights from the Detroit Tigers’ 1945 World Series victory; details of an acrostic poem written by Virginia Clemm Poe, wife of Edgar Allan – the only poem she was known to have written; a list of types of fish; a poem by Muhammad Ali written in anticipation of the legendary 1974 Rumble in the Jungle boxing match (“Imma show you, how great I am. Last night I cut the light off in my bedroom and was in bed before the room was dark…”); listings of executive orders by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Gerald Ford; significant dates in American Revolutionary and Civil War history; the lyrics to “Yo-ho-ho and a Bottle of Rum”; beer tasting notes; phone numbers and addresses; and pictures of his children.\n\nHe often subjected his family to his thirst for discovery and spontaneity. To their frequent delight – and occasional terror – he would pile everyone into the car and take them on adventures. With no hints as to the destination, these were dubbed “mystery trips.” Wickens family mystery trips would lead to winding backcountry dead-end dirt roads, places of historical significance, museums and art exhibits, and, at least one time, the local water treatment facility. This incessant curiosity was also evident in his love for the earth; he was a devoted farmer. He kept a vegetable garden that included some 25 varieties of heirloom tomatoes. At the Wickens U Pick Peach Farm in Lexington, Michigan, he and his family maintained an orchard with more than 2,500 peach trees and 1.5 acres of grapes. Dr. Wickens made wine. He kept bees and harvested their honey. He was a member of the Southeastern Michigan Fruit Growers Association and the Winegrape Growers of America.\n\nDr. Wickens also loved working on tractors, cars, and boats. He and his wife, Leeann, were members of the Michigan Chapter of the Antique and Classic Boat Society (ACBS). They traveled extensively to attend antique boat shows, entering his pride and joy, Nicodemus, into competitions throughout Michigan. A 35-foot John’s Bay lobster boat, Nicodemus won many awards, including the People’s Choice and Rear Commodore awards at the Detroit Yacht Club’s 30th Antique and Classic Boat Show, the President’s Cup, and first place in the replica/contemporary classic category at the Michigan chapter ACBS.\n\nAlthough Dr. Wickens became a U.S. citizen in 1970, he always cherished his Canadian and Scottish heritage. He was a member of the Commonwealth Club, and he boldly professed love for mushy peas, butter tarts, canned fish, haggis and spam. Through it all, he was a down-to-earth, practical man who was never intimidated by what others might think of him. Behind a gruff and at-times cantankerous exterior was a boundless reservoir of empathy. Although he could be a tough critic, he was always honest and always willing to help people in need, whether neighbors, friends, or patients. He left lasting impressions on people from many walks of life. The legacy of his curious mind and warm heart glows brightly in the memories of all who knew him.\n\nDr. Wickens was the loving husband of 34 years to Leeann; cherished father of Kimberly (Heidi) Wickens, Katherine Wickens, and David (Laura) Wickens (with first wife, Jane), and Erin (Eliahu) Wickens Sussman (with Leeann); dear brother of Rebecca Wickens; and beloved grandfather of Andrew, Jessica, Jamie, and Lauren Westrick.\n\nBernard I.
