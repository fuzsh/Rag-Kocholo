        "text": "Ukiah Daily Journal\n\nAs the nation today marks the 50th anniversary of the day John F. Kennedy was fatally shot in Dallas, local residents reflect on that moment in their lives, and its lasting impression on the American people.\n\nTerri Nichols, assistant manager at the Ukiah Senior Center Thrift Store, was in high school in Glendale, Ariz. when she heard the news on the morning of Nov. 22, 1963.\n\n“I was in speech class in high school, and it came over the intercom, Our president has been killed.” Everyone in the class started crying,” Nichols said.\n\nAs a senior at Marysville Union High School at the time, now-retired journalist Mike Geniella was tasked with delivering the bad news to his teachers.\n\n“I was sent down by my civics teacher to the office to find out what was going on,” Geniella said. “I walked into the office, and the secretary was crying. She informed me that the president had just been assassinated.”\n\nOnce he reported back, his civics teacher sent him to the other classrooms to deliver the unwelcomed news.\n\nSenior Center volunteer Denise Satterfield, then 13, got the news at her private school in Beverly Hills.\n\n“The school shut down, like all the other schools. Everyone was crying, and I was just — I couldn”t believe it. I couldn”t believe it,” Satterfield said.\n\nMendocino County Sheriff”s Office Deputy Orell Massey doesn”t remember how old he was when the nation”s second-youngest president was shot, but remembers his grammar school teacher”s reaction as she informed her students.\n\n“I was in class, and I remember being told by my teacher,” Massey said. “It was in the morning…and the teacher burst into the classroom and said President Kennedy had just been shot. We all stopped and stared. The teacher was extremely upset and crying.”\n\nAs a young child, he said the emotional impact came more from the adults around him than from his own understanding of the gravity of what had just happened. “We did feel something terrible had happened.”\n\nHe was also the one to tell his parents about the assassination, who later turned on the television to find the news on every channel.\n\nZephyr Bergera had just begun teaching special education students at Townsville High School in Pennsylvania, where students were separated by IQ, and her students — classified as having an IQ of 70 or less, were in a separate building.\n\nThe announcement didn”t come to her building, her students or the other special education teachers, she said.\n\n“It made me feel even more how prejudicial our society was. When school was out and I was walking through the main halls of the school, I was in shock,” Bergera said.\n\nThe shock came in part from the fact that, aside from reading in the history books about the assassinations of President Abraham Lincoln nearly a century earlier and President William McKinley in 1901, no one her age had seen a president shot before, according to Satterfield.\n\n“If they could kill the president, they could get anybody,” Nichols said. “If they could shoot the president, they could shoot us.”\n\n“We felt more vulnerable, certainly,” Geniella said. “When I was growing up, we lived in a nice, safe, secure bubble.”\n\nThe foreign conflict involving the Soviet Union, he said, “seemed quite a distance away. John F. Kennedy put a wonderful, glamourous spin on Washington … That ended in Dallas, that picture of America.”\n\nThe ”60s saw three assassinations, including that of JFK in November 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968 and Robert F. Kennedy in June 1968, and sent the nation”s optimism plummeting, according to Mendocino College history professor Rebecca Montes.\n\n“A lot of people get hung up on who killed JFK — was it a conspiracy — and that”s not really what was important about it, but rather that his death changed America in a lot of ways,” Montes said. All three assassinations in the ”60s “really challenged people”s faith in Democracy and the optimism people had. There was a significant decline in the ”60s in optimism.”\n\nJohn F. Kennedy”s youth, his fashionable wife, his passion and even his religion helped fuel that optimism when he took office in January 1961.\n\n“The young people were so excited to have a young, energetic somebody looking ahead, and not just a stoic, I am the president,” person in office,” said Nichols. “He was so well-liked; he was young, he was cool and he partied with Willie (Nelson) and Marilyn Monroe.”\n\nHaving grown up in Protestant families, Nichols and Satterfield remembered part of the optimism they felt in the fact that he was America”s first Catholic president.\n\nNichols” parents hadn”t allowed her to play with the Catholic children down the street, she recalls, laughing. “They were the fun ones.”\n\n“My whole family was totally Republican, but I loved the guy,” Satterfield said, remembering especially how impressed she was by his desire for racial equality.\n\n“Our community, especially as a black community, we really liked President Kennedy,” Massey recalls.\n\nNichols said although the president”s religious persuasion didn”t sway her parents” views on suitable playmates, “It was the first time I really got involved in politics. He was young and exciting, and he made us want to learn things about politics that we didn”t know before.”\n\nGeniella, who grew up in a very politically-aware family, also notes that JFK was his first introduction to politics.\n\n“When JFK ran in the ”60s, … I shook hands with him in Marysville,” Geniella said, recalling the young presidential hopeful”s train trip to his hometown. “It was thrilling. I was already interested in politics, but he was my first political hero.”\n\n“I just thought he was a great president; I thought Jackie (his wife) was gorgeous — fashion icon and all that — and it was devastating,” Satterfield said. “Everybody was just in shock.”\n\n“People were just dumbfounded,” Bergera said. “How could that possibly happen? It changed society.”\n\n“I, like millions of other people, was glued to the TV for days afterward,” Geniella said. “It was incomprehensible how the country would go ahead and move forward.”\n\nNichols remembers that as Kennedy”s vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, assumed the role of the nation”s 36th president, and “there was such an air of nervousness, of unrest, of everyone wondering, what if it happens again?”\n\n“We were eager to find out who had done it,” Massey said.\n\nMore important than the one-bullet theory and the myriad conspiracy theories that emerged, according to Montes, was the fact that Kennedy”s death fueled a boom of legislation between 1964 and 1965 under Johnson”s leadership that “facilitated the people”s greater support for equality,” and established the Civil Rights Act, and led to Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nBergera said Kennedy”s death, though tragic and shocking, had an “overall positive effect,” including, in part, its effect on the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n“It started my involvement with the movement to do black voter registration in Charleston, South Carolina,” Bergera said. “I had a big desire to work against anything that separated people, whether it was for color, or intelligence or money … it took the death of JFK for me to become so aware of it.”\n\n“We became part of a larger, global community,” Geniella said. “People in my day didn”t know much about the larger, global community. We”re wiser, and I think we”re a little more wary.”\n\nIt”s hard to say what kind of president JFK would have been in the longterm, because his first term was cut short, Geniella noted.\n\n“As a nation, we did not see enough of him,” Massey said, going on to add that Kennedy likely would have gone on to be fair, and an advocate for civil rights. His untimely death at age 46 left a scar on America, he said. “We suffered as a nation.”\n\nTiffany Revelle can be reached at udjtr@ukiahdj.com, on Twitter @TiffanyRevelle or at 468-3523."
