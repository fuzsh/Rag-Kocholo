Two prints of this series, \"Hellfighters\" of Harlem and \"Cuidado\"--Take Care--Bushmaster with Bolo!, are adapted from paintings of the U.S. Army in Action series, and used with permission by the Department of the Army.\n\nPaintings are commissioned for public affairs purposes, and prints of these paintings are available to National Guard units and to the general public.\n\nImages of these paintings may also be used for educational purposes with an appropriate permission statement, such as: \"[name of painting], a National Guard Heritage Painting by [name of artist], courtesy the National Guard Bureau.\" The U.S. Government retains all copyrights to these paintings.
