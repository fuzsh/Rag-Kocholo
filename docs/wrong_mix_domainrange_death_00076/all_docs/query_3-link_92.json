        "text": "William Mckinley was the 25th President of the United States (Israel 89). He was following a President who to many was held in high regard; this lead to McKinley having to follow in big footsteps. Even so, he had many accomplishments of his own as president, including leading America in the Spanish-American War (Andrews). Everything looked like it was going well for the President. Sadly, everything ended for McKinley on September 6, 1901, when Leon Czolgosz shot the President (Andrews). William McKinley gave his last speech at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York before being shot later that day (Baughman). Our 25th President’s legacy was all brought to a halt because of a self-described anarchist and his beliefs about people in …show more content…\n\nCzolgosz had strong beliefs that no one person should have power over others. He thought that if someone was ruling over others, they should be assassinated (Andrews). With his beliefs, he joined the American Anarchist group, although, he was very loosely affiliated with them, some even thought he was a spy trying to shut their group down (Andrews). When Leon Czolgosz heard that President McKinley was delivering speeches at the Pan-American Exposition Czolgosz thought this was the perfect time to assassinate the President; the exposition was very close to where he was staying at the time (Israel 105). On top of this Leon Czolgosz was very irritable due to things happening in his life days prior. He was part of a strike at his workplace, where many, including him, were fired, which left him in a very depressed state (Miller 73). Between this and Czolgosz being a supporter of anarchism, many businesses put him on a blacklist (Miller 72). With all this going through his head, Leon Czolgosz decided to purchase a .32 caliber Iver Johnson revolver just days prior to the Exposition (Andrews). This was the same type of gun used in the assassination of the Italian King the previous summer …show more content…\n\nOne of the first things that happened after the death of McKinley was the official swearing in of the former Vice President Theodore Roosevelt (Andrews). Even though the assassination was of an American President and took place in the United States, people and leaders all over the world mourned for the fallen President. Cities from countries all over the world came to a halt to grieve McKinley’s death (Andrews). The British King Edward VII and other monarchs declared national grief (Andrews). The next thing on people's mind was the fate of the assassin. After pleading guilty to the murder of William McKinley, Leon Czolgosz was sentenced to death by electric chair. To remember the fallen President people and leaders from all over the world came to see the McKinley’s body at his public funeral (Andrews). William McKinley will now be forever remembered by his statue in Canton, Ohio, his burial location, of him giving his final speech as the President of the United States of America"
