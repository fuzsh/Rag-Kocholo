        "meta_description": "MCKINLEY, William (1843-1901). Partly printed check, accomplished and signed (\"William McKinley\"), AS PRESIDENT, drawn on American Society and Trust Company, Washington, D.C., 3 January 1899. 1 p., oblong, 3 x 7 in., with silhouette engraving of 2-cent Internal revenue stamp at center. A check to \"A. M. Van Dyke, Recorder\" in the amount of $5.00. Evidently a dues payment for the Ohio Commandery Loyal Legion, a Civil War Veteran's group. McKinley had a highly distinguished war record and was decorated for valor at Antietam and Winchester. -- TAFT, William H. (1857-1930). Partly printed check, accomplished in secretarial hand and signed (\"Wm. H. Taft\"), drawn on Riggs National Bank, Washington, D.C., 27 March 1919. 1 page, oblong (2¾ x 8¼ in.) in variety of decorative typefaces, cartouche design along borders, engraved image of the bank at left, and Taft's name printed at far left edge. A check for $11.00 to his brother, Horace D. Taft, founder of the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut. -- HARDING, Warren G. (1865-1923). Partly printed check accomplished and signed (\"W. G. Harding, personal\"), drawn on the Marion County Bank Co., Marion, Ohio, 20 November 1916. 1 p., oblong (2½ x 5 7/8 in.), on blue paper. A substantial check for $1,042.58, payable to Henry A. Friedman for \"bills.\" He also wrote \"personal\" under his signature. Harding makes this payment one year after taking his seat in the U.S. Senate. -- COOLIDGE, Calvin (1872-1933). Partly printed check accomplished and signed (\"Calvin Coolidge\"), drawn on Northampton National Bank and Trust Co. Northampton, Mass., 24 August 1932. 1 p., oblong A check for $8.56 to the Rutland Railroad Co., presumably for train tickets, written just five months before Coolidge's death from a coronary thrombosis on 5 January 1933, after spending a morning working on a jigsaw puzzle of George Washington. Fittingly, he disposed of his $700,000 estate in a curt, 23-word last will and testament. Together four items. \t (4)",
