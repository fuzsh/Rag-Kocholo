        "text": "The World of Red Dead serves as the setting of the Red Dead series. The series primarily takes place in the real-life continent of North America.\n\nUnited States of America[]\n\nIn the Red Dead franchise, the vast majority of locations are based on towns and states found in the real-life United States of America. The Old West genre of the series makes the United States a logical choice for the primary setting.\n\nMain Locations:[]\n\nNew Austin — Geographically, New Austin appears to correspond with Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas; from the geographic perspective of the Red Dead Redemption games, as well as terrain clues in off-limits areas, it appears that areas representing central and eastern Texas exist between New Austin (and its Mexican southern neighbor, Nuevo Paraíso) and the state of Lemoyne.\n\nWest Elizabeth — West Elizabeth is an amalgamation of several states in the Western United States. Geographically, West Elizabeth appears to correspond roughly to Texas, Utah, Kansas, and Colorado, although visually Big Valley and Tall Trees more closely resemble rural California.\n\nAmbarino — Ambarino takes influence from many states of the Rocky Mountains such as Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho; its approximate geographic location seems to correspond best with Colorado, and the state's name suggests this (Ambarino means 'amber' in Spanish, while Colorado means 'reddish').\n\nNew Hanover — New Hanover, for the most part, is a widespread grassland. It combines elements from several states including: Oklahoma, Arkansas, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and South Dakota.\n\nLemoyne — Lemoyne is directly based on the State of Louisiana, the two even share similar names. A giant forest-like swamp near the Gulf of Mexico, both Lemoyne and Louisiana have significant metropolitan areas (Saint Denis and New Orleans, respectively), as well as French/African-American heritage and a history involving the Civil War.\n\nMexico[]\n\nMexico also serves as a popular setting in the Red Dead franchise, playing a role in both and Red Dead Revolver and Red Dead Redemption. Although is mentioned sparingly in the second Redemption game, Mexico is inaccessible without glitches.\n\nMain locations:[]\n\nNuevo Paraíso — Nuevo Paraíso corresponds with Nuevo Leon, while its geographic elements resemble Sonora as well as the American states of Arizona and Utah.

These include both fictional and real-life individuals. Fictional U.S. politicians are used to parody several real-life individuals as well as the U.S. and local governments.\n\nRed Dead Revolver[]\n\nPresident: The president during the events of Revolver is never explicity stated, although the real-life president during the events of the game was Grover Cleveland.\n\nGovernor: Griffon, the governor of Mississippi territory, based in the capital city of Brimstone.\n\nRed Dead Redemption[]\n\nPresidents: Never explicitly stated. During the year of 1911, the actual president was William H. Taft, and in 1914 Woodrow Wilson.\n\nAbraham Lincoln - Herbert Moon occasionally mentions him.[28]\n\nWilliam McKinley - displayed on the $10 bill.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt - occasionally mentioned by the newspaper man in Armadillo.[29]\n\nGovernors: Nate Johns is running for governor of West Elizabeth at the beginning of the story, then manages to get more votes and support thanks to the actions of John Marston and the Bureau, and is finally elected in 1911. His governorship is removed in 1914 due to being implicated in acts of corruption.\n\nArchibald Atkinson ran for governor of West Elizabeth during the elections of 1911. Rival of Nate Johns.\n\nMayors: \"Mayor of New Austin\" - mentioned in a campfire conversation.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2[]\n\nPresidents: In 1899, the current US President is Alfred MacAlister. He was likely assassinated, since his real-life counterpart, William McKinley was killed in 1901.\n\nBy 1907, the present was former senator and war hero, Thaddeus Waxman. He is likely based on Theodore Roosevelt, who also fought in the Spanish American War in 1898, and had prior political positions.\n\nPresident Fisher - Was president prior to the events of 1899.\n\nPresident Hardin -Was president prior to the events of 1899.\n\nGeorge Washington - seen on the collectable quarter in Red Dead Online.\n\nGovernors: Unidentified \"Governor of Ambarino\" mentioned on a bounty poster.\n\n\"Governor of California\" - possibly James Norris Gillett.[30]\n\nSenators: Antoine Ricard is a senator who wanted to highlight the state of Lemoyne at the \"States' Fair\" in Sacramento, California. It is unknown what happened to him after the events of Red Dead Online set in 1898.\n\nSenator Thomas Sharpe - killed by a gang of outlaws.\n\nSenator Lancing - A senator from New York in 1899.

Depending on the player, Lemieux can be impeached and kicked out of office, or remain in office, giving the player a 10% discount in all stores in Saint Denis.\n\nJean Marc Mercier can be the mayor of Saint Denis in 1899 and 1907, depending on the player. If the player chooses to spare Jean Marc, he will become the new mayor after impeaching Lemieux, and remain in that position until sometime after 1907.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nLocations[]\n\nBrimstone has not been officially confirmed to exist in the later Red Dead Redemption continuity, as it is only mentioned during campfire segments, with the narrators likely recounting old Western legends.[31]\n\nSaint Denis is based on the real-world city of New Orleans, Louisiana. They share a number of similarities, just as Lemoyne does with the real-world state of Louisiana.\n\nIn Red Dead Revolver's continuity, the real-life counterpart of Saint Denis does exist and it is implied to be where Natalie Kelley hailed from before joining her uncle in Brimstone.\n\nIn early stages of development, Saint Denis was located further below its placement in the final game and was initially named \"New Bordeaux\". However, the name would be used in Mafia III, another game published by Rockstar Games' parent company, Take-Two Interactive. New Bordeaux is mentioned on a Limping Williams whiskey label and in a campfire song.\n\nThere are several communities throughout the United States that are named \"Deer Creek\" in states: Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nHowever, the one in Oklahoma was not founded until 1898 (the year Red Dead Online took place).\n\nSeveral places in the United States are named \"Crenshaw\", including: Alabama, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania. However, the location \"Crenshaw Hills\" mentioned by Micah Bell is possibly named after the one in Los Angeles, California.\n\nRockstar San Diego is located in California, it is most likely to be a reference to this real location.\n\nTexas co-exists with New Austin in the Red Dead Redemption canon, even though New Austin is directly based on the state of Texas.\n\nThe real world Mississippi River and State of Louisiana are reference several times throughout the Red Dead series.[32] Louisiana is said to be the real-life state from which Natalie Kelley is home to in the Revolver universe.\n\nWith the release of Red Dead Redemption II confirming the Lannahechee being located in the State of Lemoyne in this universe, confirms the case of retcon, with all previous mentions to the Mississippi River since Red Dead Redemption being retconned as Lannahechee mentions.\n\nPoliticians[]\n\nPresident Fisher could be based off real life U.S. President Martin Van Buren, as he bears close facial resemblance to him.\n\nAlfred MacAlister shares a number of similarities with U.S. President William McKinley, including the period in which he was elected, assassination and similarities in overall appearance.\n\nThis is complicated by the fact William McKinley appears on the $10 bill in Red Dead Redemption. However, this could have been retconned in favor of deviating from famous real world figures.\n\nThaddeus Waxman is based on U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, given both his appearance and reputation as a military leader before his ascendance to the presidency.\n\nHowever, in Red Dead Redemption it is mentioned that Theodore Roosevelt exists and is president, as the newspaper vendor in Armadillo regularly says variations of \"Teddy Roosevelt, first president to fly in aeroplane\". This is another retconned minor character out of the original game."
