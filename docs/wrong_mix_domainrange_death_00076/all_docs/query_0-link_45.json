PRW Career Mapper compiles previously published lists of Williams’ building projects and maps them based on date, location, use, and client type. The goal is to allow researchers a means of exploring the trajectory of his career.\n\nThe PRW Career Mapper consists of an interactive timeline and a corresponding map that displays the location of projects from the timeline. A side bar also lists the projects that are being displayed in text form."
