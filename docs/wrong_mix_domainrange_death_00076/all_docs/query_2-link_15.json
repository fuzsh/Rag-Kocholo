        "text": "Today is Saturday, September 6, the 249th day of 2014. There are 116 days left in the year.\n\nToday's Highlight in History:\n\nOn September 6, 1944, during World War II, the British government relaxed blackout restrictions and suspended compulsory training for the Home Guard.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1861, Union forces led by Gen. Ulysses S. Grant occupied Paducah, Kentucky, during the Civil War.\n\nIn 1901, President William McKinley was shot and mortally wounded by anarchist Leon Czolgosz (CHAWL’-gawsh) at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. (McKinley died eight days later; Czolgosz was executed on October 29.)\n\nIn 1916, the first self-service grocery store, Piggly Wiggly, was opened in Memphis, Tennessee, by Clarence Saunders.\n\nIn 1939, the Union of South Africa declared war on Germany.\n\nIn 1943, 79 people were killed when a New York-bound Pennsylvania Railroad train derailed and crashed in Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1954, groundbreaking took place for the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in western Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1966, South African Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd (fehr-FOORT’) was stabbed to death by an apparently deranged page during a parliamentary session in Cape Town.\n\nIn 1970, Palestinian guerrillas seized control of three U.S.-bound jetliners. (Two were later blown up on the ground in Jordan, along with a London-bound plane hijacked on September 9; the fourth plane was destroyed on the ground in Egypt. No hostages were harmed.)\n\nIn 1984, country music's “Texas Troubador,” Ernest Tubb, died in Nashville at age 70.\n\nIn 1991, the Soviet Union recognized the independence of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Russian lawmakers upheld a decision by residents of Leningrad to restore the city's pre-revolutionary name, St. Petersburg.\n\nIn 1997, a public funeral was held for Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in London, six days after her death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nIn 2002, meeting outside Washington D.C. for only the second time since 1800, Congress convened in New York to pay homage to the victims and heroes of September 11.\n\nTen years ago: Former President Bill Clinton underwent successful heart bypass surgery during a four-hour procedure at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia. In Iraq, seven members of the First Marine Division from Camp Pendleton, California, and three U.S.-trained Iraqi soldiers were killed by a car bomb near Fallujah. Former hurricane Frances pounded the Florida Panhandle as a tropical storm.\n\nFive years ago: The White House announced the resignation of President Barack Obama's environmental adviser Van Jones, who'd become embroiled in a controversy over past inflammatory statements; Jones cited what he called a “vicious smear campaign” against him.\n\nOne year ago: Debra Milke (MIHL’-kee), who'd spent more than two decades on Arizona's death row, was released on bond after a judge ruled there was no direct evidence linking her to the death of her 4-year-old son Christopher, other than a purported confession to a detective whose credibility has been called into question. (Milke faces a retrial in 2015.) NASA's newest robotic lunar explorer, LADEE, rocketed into space in an unprecedented moonshot from Virginia that dazzled sky watchers along the East Coast.\n\nToday's Birthdays: Comedian JoAnne Worley is 79.
