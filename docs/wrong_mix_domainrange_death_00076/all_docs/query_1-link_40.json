        "text": "1901 Â· Assassination of Mckinley\n\nPresident William McKinley was shot at the Temple of Music, in the Pan-American Exposition, while shaking hands with the public. Leon Czolgosz shot him twice in the abdomen because he thought it was his duty to do so. McKinley died after eight days of watch and care. He was the third American president to be assassinated. After his death, Congress passed legislation to officially make the Secret Service and gave them responsibility for protecting the President at all times.\n\n1901 Â· City Hall Built\n\nThe Old Colorado Springs city Hall was built between 1901-1905. It was in use until 1997. The historical building was designed by Thomas Barber and Thomas MacLaren."
