Welcome to our community website, providing information and images relating to our vibrant community on the South Coast of England. Historic, picturesque, rural yet close to the seaside town of Eastbourne it is a special place to live in, work in or to visit.

Westham Parish Council is made up of three communities, Westham Village, Stone Cross and Hankham each with their own distinctive images of the Heron, the Windmill and the Anvil respectively. As you enter each of these areas you are greeted by beautifully crafted community signs.
