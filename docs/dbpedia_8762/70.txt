Balfour Beatty is working in partnership with East Sussex County Council to manage the highways service across East Sussex. As part of this, we will be investigating and repairing a footway outside number 37 in Springfield Close, Westham

When do they start?

Work will be carried out on Thursday 25 April & Friday 26 April, between the hours of 8am - 4pm.

We will inform you of any changes to the dates or times via advanced warning signs on site.

How will this impact highway users?

The road will remain open with some carriageway incursion whilst the work is undertaken.

Information for residents and businesses

Parking: We will put out ‘no parking’ signs and cones on the site to advise where parking is restricted. Please avoid parking in these locations as it will delay our works.

Weather: All of these works are subject to favourable weather conditions, for example heavy rain may affect the progress of the works.

Properties close to the carriageway may experience a temporary disturbance as this can be a noisy process and those properties may experience flashing lights and reversing sirens.

Permit Reference: EA222-54080-01

We would like to take this opportunity to apologise in advance for any inconvenience or disruption this work may cause, however this forms part of our continuing improvement for the East Sussex highway network.

Please let us know how we did by leaving feedback. Please note you will be redirected to the East Sussex County Council consultation website.
