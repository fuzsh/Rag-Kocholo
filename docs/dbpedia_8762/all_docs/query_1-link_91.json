        "text": "Former West Ham United Player and International Coach George Cowie has 17 years experience organising and overseeing football tours to the UK. George joined West Ham United as a professional player in 1977. During his time, West Ham won the FA Cup and were League Cup runners-up, George being on the substitutes bench against Liverpool at Wembley Stadium in the 1980 FA Charity Shield.\n\nGeorge Cowie Football\n\nGeorge has played in top level games against Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham and he was the captain of the Scotland U18 Professional Youth team in 1978. In 1983 George returned to his native Scotland where he went on to make nearly 100 appearances for Hearts in the Scottish Premier League before injury cut short his career. Following relocation to Australia, George has remained involved in the game as a coach at various levels including, Technical Manager of Football Queensland, National Coach of Papua New Guinea Under 23 Olympic Team, National Coach of the Solomon Islands.\n\nGeorge has many years of experience at the highest level of football both as a coach and a player. This has enabled him to create some extremely strong relationships with coaches at many top clubs to give him direct contact with the right people in the right places to enable him to deliver a very personal football experience whether that is on a tour or assisting talented players to reach their full potential.\n\nWe conduct many Regional Camps in Australia & New Zealand, progressing to a four-day Residential Camp on the Gold Coast, Queensland and amazing “Professional Football Experience” trips to the UK. We can’t make you a professional football player, only YOU can do that with lots of hard work and dedication but we can help you on your journey with quality coaching sessions from top class experienced coaches and give you the opportunity to visit Professional Academies at top clubs in the UK which will inspire you to work even harder to achieve your dreams. At the very worst it will be an fantastic experience which you can enjoy with your family and will give you life-long memories.”"
