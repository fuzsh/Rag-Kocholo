        "text": "About West Ham\n\nWest Ham is in the London Borough of Newham in London. In the west it is a post-industrial neighbourhood abutting the site of the London Olympic Park and in the east it is mostly residential, consisting of Victorian terraced housing interspersed with higher density post-War social housing. The place lends its name to West Ham United F.C. West Ham is located 6.1 miles (9.8 km) east of Charing Cross. West Ham station on Manor Road is served by the London Underground Jubilee, Hammersmith and City and District lines; the National Rail c2c services; and the Docklands Light Railway. Plaistow and Stratford stations are also close by. Post-industrial land and a network of waterways separate West Ham from Bromley-by-Bow. To the north and east the area bleeds into Stratford and Plaistow, with Canning Town to the south. The array of transport available which links West Ham to the rest of the City of London has made West Ham a sought after location to reside in.\n\nFind out how much your flat or house is worth in West Ham.\n\nLocal Estate Agencies\n\nWest Ham estate agents\n\nE15 estate agents\n\nWhy not explore some other local areas\n\nStratford area guide\n\nPlaistow area guide\n\nUpton area guide\n\nMaryland area guide\n\nBow area guide\n\nUpton Park area guide\n\nForest Gate area guide\n\nPlashet area guide\n\nPoplar area guide\n\nVictoria Park area guide\n\nE15 area guide\n\nPerformance cookies\n\nPerformance cookies let us collect information about how the website is used.
