        "text": "With West Ham having one eye on the Europa League, could this be our first win at the London Stadium? Here’s our guide.\n\nGETTING TO THE LONDON STADIUM\n\nBY CAR\n\nFulham fans should note that the London Stadium, purpose-built for the 2012 Olympic Games and subsequently taken over by West Ham, was designated a public transport venue and driving is actively discouraged. The stadium is sited within the Olympic Park and all the surrounding roads are self-contained within a well-patrolled controlled parking zone for local residents.\n\nThere is very little parking but if you still want to drive, exit the North Circular (A406) for the A12, taking the fourth exit from the roundabout and follow the signs for Central London and Stratford. After approximately four miles, the velodrome will come into view on your left. Leave the A12 for the A106 – with signs for Stratford and Westfield – and filter left at the traffic lights. Follow the flow of traffic straight on and Westfield Shopping Centre will appear on your left with the London Stadium on the right. The closest parking option will be at Westfield, with all-day spaces available for £10.\n\nBY TUBE AND TRAIN\n\nThe London Stadium is served by three major stations that are about 10-15 minutes walk away. Stratford is right next to Westfield and is served by national rail and overground trains from Clapham Junction and Liverpool Street as well as the Central Line, Jubilee Line and the Docklands Light Railway.\n\nStratford International is located on the other side of Westfield, with trains arriving from London St. Pancras as well as other destinations on the Docklands Light Railway.\n\nHackney Wick is on the western side of the London Stadium in comparison to the pair of Stratford stations. It is the closest station to the away end, but is smaller in size to Stratford and Stratford International and can become crowded. Overground trains will take you to Highbury and Islington, Clapham Junction, Richmond and Stratford.\n\nAWAY PUBS\n\nDue to the fact that almost all of the pubs within the vicinity of the London Stadium have been designated as for home supporters only, most Fulham fans have drunk in Central London or at Liverpool Street before heading east to the stadium.\n\nThere are a number of eateries within the Westfield Shopping Centre that serve alcohol, including the Cow on Westfield Avenue, whilst the Aspers Casino and the Holiday Inn have several easily accessible bars. There are a number of pop-up brewery options close to the various railway stations. From Stratford International, you might want to try the Tap East (7 International Square, London, E20 1EE), which boasts sixteen on tap and around 100 bottled beers. Closer to Hackney Wick station, you will find The CRATE (Unit 7 Queen’s Yard, White Post Lane, London, E9 5EN) and The Howling Hops (Unit 9A Queen’s Yard, White Post Lane, London, E9 5EN) right next to each other.\n\nAlcohol is available inside the London Stadium at the various bars and kiosks but it is very expensive with prices raised this season. The options on offer will include Amstel, Heineken Bulmers with small bottles of wine and cans of gin and tonic. There is usually a ‘pie and pint’ promotion as well."
