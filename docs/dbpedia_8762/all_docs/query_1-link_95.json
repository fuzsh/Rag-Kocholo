        "text": "“I’m delighted to be here, and I can’t wait to get out on the pitch with my new teammates,” the 31-year-old forward said.\n\n“I think the Premier League is the best league in the world, and for me it is the right time to move over to England and play for a big club like West Ham.\n\n“I have been thinking about West Ham for a long time now – I know the technical director Tim Steidten very well, because we have history at Werder Bremen together, and I have watched some games and seen how much quality there is in the team.\n\n“The chance to play under the head coach is also really exciting. His playing style is important for me, and I am confident that under him I will be able to perform at my best, and score lots of goals.\n\n“I love being close to supporters, and I’m really looking forward to meeting the West Ham fans. I have a very good feeling at the moment – I’m strong, fit and in shape – and I just want to get out there and start playing for them.”\n\nFüllkrug scored 16 goals in 46 appearances for Dortmund last season, helping them to reach the Champions League final which they lost to Real Madrid.\n\nLopetegui has also signed the winger Crysencio Summerville for £25m from Leeds and the £40m defender Max Kilman from Wolves, as well as the goalkeeper Wes Foderingham and the Brazilian winger Luis Guilherme.\n\nWest Ham are also close to completing the free-transfer signing of the Argentina midfielder Guido Rodríguez."
