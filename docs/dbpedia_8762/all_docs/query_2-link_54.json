There is at least one wheelchair bay per train, so book in advance to be sure to reserve the spot. Powered scooters come in all shapes and sizes, and unfortunately some are unsuitable for train travel. If you wish to take a scooter on a train, you’ll need to complete a Scooter Card application form – and then send it to South Western Rail. They recommend doing this early as it takes up to two weeks to process.\n\nThere are accessible toilet facilities opposite platform 19 at London Waterloo through the main arch (exit 3) on the left. A Radar key is required.\n\nThere is step-free access to the London Underground from Waterloo Station. You will need Exit 2 (via lifts to Waterloo Road and level Access to the Jubilee line).

Please note, road closures are in place post-match to provide safe routes for home and away supporters leaving the stadium and so the shuttle buses do not leave until the traffic restrictions have been lifted.\n\nIf you require any assistance please contact Julie or Joanne in the accessibility team at West Ham on\n\n0333 030 0174\n\nor by email at [email protected].
