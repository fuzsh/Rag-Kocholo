        "text": "Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s transfer to West Ham was thought to be close, but reports suggest the Hammers may look elsewhere for a new right-back.\n\nAccording to Mike Keegan of The Telegraph, Kieran Trippier is on West Ham’s radar as they step up attempts to get a right-back in the door before the new Premier League season starts next week.\n\nThe same report states that the Hammers are still looking at Wan-Bissaka as well as Southampton’s Kyle Walker-Peters but they’ve not been able to thrash out a deal for either of them.\n\nKeegan reports: “Newcastle right-back Trippier, 33, is among the possible options for West Ham to look at, depending on whether he is available from his club. While the England international, who started six games at Euro 2024 has been linked with Saudi Arabian clubs, his situation at St James’ Park and whether he would be on the market is yet to be determined.”\n\nMeanwhile, there is widespread belief within Spanish media that West Ham have already made contact with Girona defender Arnau Martinez.\n\nMundo Deportivo claims an opening offer – fee unknown – is likely to be sent to the Catalan club in the coming days.\n\nArnau’s contract at Girona expires in 2025, but this shows that West Ham seem happy to brief that they are considering other targets. Is this all just a tactic while they finalise a deal with United for Wan-Bissaka?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\nWill Wan-Bissaka leave United this summer?\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nWest Ham want Wan-Bissaka and the player is open to the move.\n\nJust a few days ago, the media suggested a move was almost set in stone – so it was odd seeing him start against Liverpool in the final pre-season tour friendly.\n\nI still think Wan-Bissaka will end up at West Ham this summer. Otherwise he can leave as a free agent next summer, after entering the final 12 months of his deal at Old Trafford.\n\nSubscribe to the Stretty News podcast Strettycast for weekly episodes on Manchester United.
