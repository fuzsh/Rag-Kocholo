        "text": "London taxpayers are absorbing a loss of about $634,000 (all figures U.S.) per West Ham United home match as the city, which owns London Stadium through London Legacy Development Corporation subsidiary E20 Stadium LLP, lost $26.54M in the last financial year. The long-term costs of running London Stadium compared to the income received from the Premier League club and U.K. Athletics are \"so great that its value to the LLDC is stated in the accounts as only\" $1.15M. E20 Stadium's \"underlying operating position for the group is a loss\" of $17.9M \"even when excluding capital investment in the stadium and changes in the provisions made for 'onerous contracts.'\" West Ham pays $4.57M in rent per season, but does not pay for maintenance and they \"keep all the ticket money and a share of the catering income.\" West Ham signed a 100-year lease agreement that has 91 years left (London TIMES, 8/7)."
