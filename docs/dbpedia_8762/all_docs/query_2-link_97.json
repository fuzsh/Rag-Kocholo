        "text": "By Car\n\nFrom The North\n\nLeave the M25 at Junction 27 and take the M11 towards London. At the end of the M11, join the A406 towards Docklands (A13) and London City Airport. At the junction with the A13, turn onto this road towards Dartford Crossing. At the junction with the A1306, exit the A13 and merge onto the A1306 towards Dagenham. At the third traffic light, turn left onto Ballards Road. At the end of this street, you’ll come to a large roundabout. Turn left onto Rainham Road, head straight, and you’ll see Dagenham East tube station should be on the left. Victoria Road is a quarter-mile down the same side of the street.\n\nFrom The South\n\nLeave the M25 at Junction 31 and take the A13 towards Central London. After approximately 7.4 miles, exit the A13 onto the ramp which is signposted Dagenham / Dagenham East. At the end of the driveway, turn right at the double roundabout and go under the A13. At the intersection, turn left onto A1306. At the second traffic light, turn right onto the B178 (Ballards Road). At the end of this street, you will come to a large roundabout where you will turn left onto Rainham Road. Head up Rainham Road past Dagenham East tube station on the left. Victoria Road should be a quarter mile down the same side of that street.\n\n​\n\nBy Train\n\nTake the District line to Dagenham East, not Dagenham Heathway. When you exit the train station turn left and the ground is clearly marked and only a five minute walk away. Note that the tube ride from central London can take about 45 minutes. The tube ride can be a nightmare and it is probably best to take a train from Fenchurch St to Barking station and from there take a tube to Dagenham`. Oyster and Travelcard are valid for this trip.\n\nWhere to Park"
