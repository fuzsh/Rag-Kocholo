        "text": "Balfour Beatty is working in partnership with East Sussex County Council to manage the highways service across East Sussex. As part of this, we will be investigating and repairing a footway outside number 37 in Springfield Close, Westham\n\nWhen do they start?\n\nWork will be carried out on Thursday 25 April & Friday 26 April, between the hours of 8am - 4pm.\n\nWe will inform you of any changes to the dates or times via advanced warning signs on site.\n\nHow will this impact highway users?\n\nThe road will remain open with some carriageway incursion whilst the work is undertaken.\n\nInformation for residents and businesses\n\nParking: We will put out ‘no parking’ signs and cones on the site to advise where parking is restricted. Please avoid parking in these locations as it will delay our works.\n\nWeather: All of these works are subject to favourable weather conditions, for example heavy rain may affect the progress of the works.\n\nProperties close to the carriageway may experience a temporary disturbance as this can be a noisy process and those properties may experience flashing lights and reversing sirens.\n\nPermit Reference: EA222-54080-01\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to apologise in advance for any inconvenience or disruption this work may cause, however this forms part of our continuing improvement for the East Sussex highway network.\n\nPlease let us know how we did by leaving feedback. Please note you will be redirected to the East Sussex County Council consultation website."
