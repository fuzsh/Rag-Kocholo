        "text": "West Ham United have a relationship with the United States that stretches back to the 1960s. They became the first team ever to play a soccer match indoors when they played Real Madrid at the Houston Astrodome in 1967. The East London club also took on Pele’s Santos at Randall’s Island in New York in 1970. Since then, many ex-Hammers have moved to the States to ply their trade including World Cup winners Geoff Hurst and Bobby Moore, as well as Harry Redknapp, Frank Lampard and Robbie Keane, amongst others.\n\nNow, with the English Premier League proving to be more popular than ever on this side of the pond, there are West Ham supporters groups springing up all over the country. This page will guide you through all of the places to watch the Hammers and connect with fellow supporters in the USA.\n\nA small but hard-core group of West Ham Supporters, the Copper City Irons can be found on matchdays at Yucca Tap Room in Tempe, or any other time on social media.\n\nThe Fresno Irons came into being in 2016 and now claim to be the loudest and most fun supporters group in the Central Valley. You can catch up with them on social media for information on game meet ups.\n\nNot to be confused with The Hollywood Hammers (or are they?) LA Hammers are based at the Los Angeles Soccer Club in North Hollywood – open for all early Hammers games, but check the club’s highly informative Facebook page first.\n\nSince forming back in 2018, The Mile High Hammers have expanded their ranks year on year. Join them for a match at Celtic On Market, Denver’s best soccer pub that opens for early games where you can also have a flutter on the horses.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Hammers were formed by Cameron Bixby in 2015. They meet for games at MacDinton’s Irish Pub in Tampa where the West Ham flag is displayed inside for the matches. Sign up here if you live in the Tampa Bay area and wish to become a Tampa Hammer.\n\nThe Baltimore Hammers welcome you to join them at Abbey Burger in Fells Point to watch a West Ham game. Follow them on social media for more info.\n\nThe Boston Hammers are a well-established West Ham supporters group who welcome newcomers to join them at the famed Banshee soccer bar for live matches. You can also follow them on social media.\n\nThe gateway to the West Ham fans in St. Louis is through the Amsterdam Tavern, a renowned local soccer bar. Here you’ll find the St. Louis Hammers cheering on the Irons on matchdays. The group was formed back in 2014. They also have an informative and up to date social media page.\n\nThe Minneapolis Hammers extend a warm welcome to all local West Ham fans in Missouri. You can join them for a game at the Brit’s Pub that opens for early games and also boasts its very own bowling lawn!\n\nNYC Hammers was formed back in 2001 by Sean Fewel. Their home is at midtown’s famed soccer bar Smithfield Hall – where all the best supporters clubs are. Join them for a game with a great atmosphere and follow them on social media.\n\nSign up with the Queen City Hammers on social media and you can purchase an original tee-shirt commemorating their recent European triumph. You can also join them for a live game in Charlotte at the Big Ben Pub on Elizabeth Avenue.\n\nThe Columbus E13 were formed back in 2016.
