        "text": "West Ham’s new ‘London Stadium’ is served by three main railway stations, all of which are around a 15 minute walk away. Stratford Station is considered to be the main station as it has over ground connections to London Liverpool Street and Clapham Junction, as well as an Underground station on both the Jubilee and Central lines. It is also on the Docklands Light Railway. Away fans that get off at Stratford Station will be able to visit the Westfield Shopping Centre, where you’ll find a number of places serving alcohol.\n\nThere is also Stratford International Railway Station, which is on the other side of the Westfield Shopping Centre, and is served by London St Pancras, which is just over a 5 minute journey. This is another station which is on the Docklands Light Railway.\n\nFinally, there is Hackney Wick Railway Station which is situated on the opposite side of the stadium to the two Stratford Stations. Hackney Wick is served by London Waterloo and Stratford. Stops at Highbury and Islington can connect fans to the Victoria Line on the Underground, for those travelling to London Euston.\n\nFind train times and book your tickets for the best available prices by clicking through to the trainline website below:\n\nThere are a number of pubs near the London Stadium.\n\nOver the coming months we will be building up fans reviews of the best places to drink on an away trip to West Ham, and you’ll be able to find them here.\n\nIn the meantime, we’ve included a map below with a few pubs near the stadium highlighted for you."
