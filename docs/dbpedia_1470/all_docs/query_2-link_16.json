        "meta_description": "The endometrium in early pregnancy undergoes decidualization and functional changes induced by local trophoblast, which are not fully understood. We hypothesized that endometrium from tubal ectopic pregnancy (EP) could be interrogated to identify novel genes and pathways involved in these processes. Gestation-matched endometrium was collected from women with EP (n = 11) and intrauterine pregnancies (IUP) (n = 13). RNA was extracted from the tissue. In addition, tissues were prepared for histological analysis for degree of decidualization. We compared a) the samples from EP that were decidualized (n = 6) with non-decidualized samples (n = 5), and b) the decidualized EP (n = 6) with decidualization-matched IUP (n = 6) samples using an Affymetrix gene array platform, with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, combined with quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of PRL and IGFBP1 was used to confirm the degree of decidualization in each group. There were no differences in PRL or IGFBP1 expression in the decidualization-matched samples but a marked reduction (P<0.001) in the non-decidualized samples. Decidualization was associated with increased expression of 428 genes including SCARA5 (181-fold), DKK1 (71-fold) and PROK1 (32-fold), and decreased expression of 230 genes including MMP-7 (35-fold) and SFRP4 (21-fold). The top canonical pathways associated with these differentially expressed genes were Natural Killer Cell and Wnt/b-Catenin signaling. Local trophoblast was associated with much less alteration of endometrial gene expression with an increase in 56 genes, including CSH1 (8-fold), and a reduction in 29 genes including CRISP3 (8-fold). The top associated canonical pathway was Antigen Presentation. The study of endometrium from tubal EP may promote novel insights into genes involved in decidualization and those influenced by factors from neighboring trophoblast. This has afforded unique information not highlighted by previous studies and adds to our understanding of the endometrium in early pregnancy.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nEndometrial decidualization has a fundamental role in the establishment of human pregnancy [1], [2]. Increasing our understanding of the genes and pathways involved in this key process will facilitate the development of strategies to manipulate endometrial function in order to promote normality or inhibit fertility. While there are established in vitro models of decidualization [4], [9] these lack the cellular complexity and paracrine interactions that occur in vivo. In vivo assessment of decidual changes in early pregnancy is challenging [10], [11] as there are difficulties in controlling for temporal and local factors. In addition, it is not known if trophoblast locally affects or regulates the process of decidualization in early pregnancy or indeed what paracrine effects the trophoblast may have on the endometrium.\n\nWe have previously established that decidualization of the endometrium in tubal ectopic pregnancies is variable [4]. In this study, we collected gestation-matched endometrium from ectopic pregnancy and stratified for degree of decidualization to assess genes involved in decidualization in early pregnancy in the absence of the local effects of trophoblast. In addition, using the same strategy, using gestation matched ectopic and intrauterine pregnancies stratified for degree of decidualization, we assessed the contribution of local trophoblast to endometrial function. We used microarray analysis to interrogate these samples and to highlight novel endometrial genes associated with decidualization and those regulated by trophoblast.\n\nThe use of microarray technology to assess endometrial decidualization is not novel. Popovici et al. used microarrays to examine genes differentially expressed in human endometrial stromal cells decidualized in vitro [9]. They reported changes in numerous genes including an up-regulation of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors [9]. Chen et al. examined genes differentially expressed between the decidua and trophoblast of early human pregnancy [12]. They highlighted differences in extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules [12]. Other studies have focussed on the effects of exogenous molecules on cultured human decidual cells [13], [14]. Although decidua from ectopic pregnancy has been compared against mid-secretory endometrium [11], this is the first study to our knowledge, to investigate the genes associated with decidualization and dissect out the local effects of trophoblast by using gestation matched ectopic and intrauterine pregnancies stratified for degree of decidualization. This has afforded unique insights not highlighted by previous studies and adds to our understanding of the endometrium in early pregnancy.\n\nThe crucial importance of decidualization in early pregnancy was highlighted in the this study as the gene expression profiles of the endometrium from patients clustered based on the degree of decidualization, irrespective of the location of the pregnancy. However, as expected [4] endometrium from ectopic pregnancies was less decidualized. We used the expression of PRL and IGFBP1 as known markers of endometrial decidualization. These genes are universally accepted as markers of decidualization [4], [10]. When we grouped the endometrium from ectopic pregnancies on the degree of their histological decidualization, and assessed endometrium from ectopic pregnancies matched for decidualization with intrauterine pregnancies, the differential expression of PRL and IGFBP1 supported these groups and our strategy for gene and pathway discovery.\n\nSurprisingly IGFBP1 was not highlighted in the array decidualization gene discovery study. Although the array showed a 20-fold increase in IGFBP1 in the partially decidualized endometrium from ectopic pregnancies when compared to the non-decidualized samples, this difference failed on statistical test correction and was not included. We had previously showed that INHBB increased during decidualization and reduced expression could be a biomarker of EP [4]. Interestingly this gene was not identified in the decidualization studies but was shown to be increased by the presence of local trophoblast. Overall these examples highlight that although we have identified novel genes there may be additional differentially expressed important genes masked by the robust statistical analysis and that gene regulation may be complex and multiple approaches are required. However reassuringly these studies reinforced our previous discovery that CRISP3 is a trophoblast-inhibited gene [5].\n\nThe success of our strategy is further highlighted by the discovery of a notable increase in DKK1 with increasing decidualization. DKK1 is known to be a marker of increasing decidualization [15], [16]. We showed that the gene with the highest fold change associated with endometrial decidual change detected in the microarray study was SCARA5 and confirmed differential expression using quantitative RT-PCR. This gene has not previously been associated with decidualization and was not highlighted when ectopic decidua was compared to mid-secretory endometrium [11] or when endometrial stromal cells were decidualized in vitro [9]. It is of interest however, not only because of the marked differential expression, but because its expression is known to be altered by allelic imbalance or methylation [17], [18]. It is expressed by epithelial cells [19] and has been described in the bovine endometrial stroma particularly during pregnancy [20]. Nevertheless, the function of SCARA5 is not entirely clear. It has been postulated that it has a role in innate immune activity [19], [20] as well as lipid and ferritin trafficking [21]–[23]. It is likely that SCARA5 has a role in the endometrial decidualization and highlights how potentially important novel genes may be detected by our approach.\n\nPROK1 is another gene highlighted by our approach that is also worthy of discussion. It is expressed in the endometrium and is increased in the secretory phase [24]. It has also been reported to be expressed in the decidua of early pregnancy and has been linked to the regulation of COX2, LIF and other genes known to be involved in implantation [25]. Although its secretion is promoted by local hCG administration [26], we have shown that it is related to decidualization in the absence of local trophoblast. Although it is related to decidualization it may not be regulated in the same way or at the same time as PRL. In recurrent pregnancy loss the mid-secretory endometrium has a decreased PRL expression but increased PROK1 expression [27]. Our study has further emphasized the importance of this molecule and the need for further study.\n\nMMP7 was the gene whose expression was most down-regulated by decidualization of the endometrium. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP7 and MMP11, also found to be decreased in this study, are involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and control of MMPs during implantation is necessary for the maintenance of tissue stability in the uterus [28], [29]. This, and the up-regulation of the MMP inhibitor TIMP3 found here, suggests that decidualization is associated with a suppression of genes involved in ECM remodelling and this occurs in the absence of local trophoblast. In their comparison of ectopic decidua with the mid-secretory endometrium, Savaris et al. reported MMP7 and MMP11 were the most up-regulated genes in ectopic decidua [11]. The discrepancy between this and our findings may be because the endometrium in ectopic pregnancy is less decidualized or because in pregnancy there is higher MMP7 and MMP11 expression than in the non-pregnant endometrium even although it is modified by decidualization. Interestingly, Sherwin et al. showed that exposure to hCG during simulated pregnancy in the secretory phase increased endometrial MMP7 expression [3].\n\nOther notable genes markedly down-regulated by decidualization, in the present study, were SFRP4 and SFRP1. In the pregnant rat uterus, however, SFRP4 expression was found to increase during decidualization and this was estrogen regulated [31]. This highlights species differences in the endometrial response to pregnancy. In contrast, in primates, a reduction in endometrial SFRP4 was seen during hCG exposure of the endometrium in vivo [30]. The secreted frizzled-related proteins such as SFRP4 contain Wnt-binding domains and are soluble regulators of Wnt signalling pathways [31]. This would suggest that the Wnt pathway has a role in the promotion of decidualization. However, DKK1 was markedly upregulated during decidualization. As DKK1 works by inhibiting the Wnt signalling pathway the role of Wnt in decidualization is complex. Interestingly, in the secretory compared to proliferative endometrium DKK1 is upregulated while SFRP4 is downregulated [32] suggesting co-ordinated inverse regulation of these pathways. In addition, SFRP4 expression is also reduced in endometrial carcinomas [33] and sarcomas [34] confirming an important role in normal endometrial function.\n\nHowever, the role of specific Wnts and their signalling pathways in the endometrium in early human pregnancy is not well understood [35]. This gap in knowledge is highlighted in the current study. We found the top canonical pathways involved in decidualization as natural killer cell (NK) signalling and Wnt-ß-catenin signalling. The importance of uterine NK cells in endometrial and decidual function is well known [10], [36], [37]. Further study of the complex Wnt system and its regulatory and signalling molecules in the human decidua is urgently required.\n\nWhen endometrium from intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancies with matched decidualization status was examined, we were surprised by how few genes were significantly differentially expressed. Although trophoblast may have a direct paracrine effect on the neighboring endometrium, we have shown that differences in gene expression are modest. This would be consistent with the endometrium having a facilitory rather than dynamic response to pregnancy. However, as decidua could not be stratified by distance to implantation site this may imply that local effects of trophoblast are spatially limited in the endometrium and not seen in decidua more distant to the implantation site.\n\nFour of the most up-regulated genes in the presence of local trophoblast, CSH1, CSH2, CGA and CSHL1 are known trophoblast gene products [38], [39]. This would be consistent with possible trophoblast cell contamination not detected on initial immunohistochemical analysis. We confirmed however that non-trophoblast cells are able to express these chorionic related genes. We looked for CSH1 and CGA transcripts in an epithelial cell line and found that, not only could they be detected, but there was a non-significant trend for their increase when exposed to physiologically relevant local concentrations of hCG [5]. This suggests that the endometrial expression of these genes may well by increased by trophoblast. If there was decidual microcontamination with trophoblast it is surprising how few genes were changed but more importantly it would further argue against significant global endometrial changes influenced by local trophoblast.\n\nAnother intriguing observation is that CPA3, TPSAB1 and TPSB2 were increased by local trophoblast. These are all mast cell products and this highlights another possible interaction of trophoblast with immune cells. It has been shown that mast cells are increased in choriocarcinoma and molar pregnancy and are thought to be involved in controlling trophoblast invasion [40]. The role of mast cells in successful pregnancy is unknown [41] but they have been linked to pregnancy failure [42]. A reduction in mast cells in ectopic pregnancy is unlikely as the cellular composition of uterine decidua in tubal and intrauterine pregnancies are similar [7], [8]. Some women in the matched decidualization intrauterine group had a non-viable pregnancy and, as pregnancy failure is associated with increased mast cells [41], [42], this may explain the difference. However even in this case it highlights the role of trophoblast in the regulation of decidual mast cells.\n\nAlthough fewer genes were down-regulated by local trophoblast the top down-regulated gene has been described to be regulated by hCG. CRISP3 is expressed in the endometrial epithelium and we have previously reported that its expression is increased in the decidua of ectopic pregnancy [5]. In addition CRISP3 was reduced in ectopic decidua when compared to the mid-secretory endometrium [11]. CRISP3 expression in an endometrial epithelial cell line was inhibited by physiological concentrations of hCG [5]. These data further support the concept that trophoblast can inhibit the expression of genes. CRISP3 is widely expressed in the reproductive tract of males [43] and females [5], [44] with several functions attributed to it including a supporting role in localized tissue inflammation and immune response [45], [46]. It is therefore not surprising that pathway analysis confirmed pathways regulated by local trophoblast to include those involved in immune function and inflammation.\n\nAs well as CRISP3 it seems that other molecules involved in the response to injury such as UPK1B are also down regulated by trophoblast. UPKB1 was initially described in the bladder epithelium but has recently been reported in the glandular-epithelial cells of the endometrium [47]. It was increased after endometrial injury also suggesting a role in local inflammation. Indeed GAST is also up-regulated during inflammation [48], [49]. Although there may well be genes specifically inhibited by trophoblast it is notable that both CRISP3 and GAST are also regulated by decidualization. This further highlights the fundamental importance of the decidualization process in early human pregnancy.\n\nIn conclusion, this study used a novel strategy to use tubal ectopic pregnancy to study genes associated with decidualization in the absence of local trophoblast. As well as confirming genes and pathways already implicated in endometrial decidual change, we have highlighted additional genes worthy of further study. In addition, we used decidualization matched tubal ectopic and intrauterine pregnancies to study the genetic effects of local trophoblast on the endometrium. This highlighted how few endometrial genes are regulated by trophoblast and further confirmed the fundamental importance of the decidualization process. We have shown that tubal ectopic pregnancy may be used to study decidualization and believe findings from this approach will further our understanding of the biology of embryo implantation and early pregnancy and its manipulation."
