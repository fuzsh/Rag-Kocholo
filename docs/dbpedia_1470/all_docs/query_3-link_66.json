        "text": "Target Information\n\nInterleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a proinflammatory cytokine expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. IL-1 beta is synthesized in response to inflammatory stimuli as a 31 kDa inactive pro-form that accumulates in the cytosol. Cleavage of pro-IL-1 beta into the active 17 kDa protein requires the activation of inflammasomes, which are multi-protein complexes that respond to pathogens, stress conditions, and other danger signals. Inflammasome activation triggers the processing of the caspase-1 precursor into its active form, which in turn cleaves pro-IL-1 beta. IL-1 beta lacks a signal sequence peptide for classical ER/Golgi pathway and is secreted alongside caspase-1 via an alternate and incompletely understood mechanism. Although IL-1 beta is most often secreted in its active form, secretion of the uncleaved protein may be detectable under some biological conditions. IL-1 beta signals through two receptors, IL-1RI and IL-1RII, both of which are shared with IL-1 alpha. IL-1 beta activity can be moderated by IL-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1RA), a protein produced by many cell types that blocks receptor binding through competitive inhibition. IL-1 beta play an important role in innate host defense by triggering the production of other proinflammatory cytokines in target cells and initiating acute-phase responses to infection and injury. Elevated levels of IL-1 beta have been associated with many chronic inflammatory conditions IL-1 beta neutralizing antibodies potential therapeutic value."
