Here we show that this locus including the gene encoding the telomerase reverse-transcriptase TERT at 5p13.33 is rarely but recurrently targeted by somatic chromosomal translocations to IGH and non-IG loci in B-cell neoplasms, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. In addition, cases with genomic amplification of TERT locus were identified. Tumors bearing chromosomal aberrations involving TERT showed higher TERT transcriptional expression and increased telomerase activity. These data suggest that deregulation of TERT gene by chromosomal abnormalities leading to increased telomerase activity might contribute to B-cell lymphomagenesis.\n\nAn immortalized goat mammary epithelial cell line induced with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene transfer.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Y L; Wu, Y H; He, X N; Liu, F J; He, X Y; Zhang, Y\n\n2009-06-01\n\nAlthough mammary epithelial cell lines can provide a rapid and reliable indicator of gene expression efficiency of transgenic animals, their short lifespan greatly limits this application. To provide stable and long lifespan cells, goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) were transduced with pLNCX2-hTERT by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Transduced GMECs were evaluated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), proliferation assays, karyotype analysis, telomerase activity assay, western blotting, soft agar assay, and injection into nude mice. Non-transduced GMECs were used as a control. The hTERT-GMECs had higher telomerase activity and extended proliferative lifespan compared to non-transfected GMECs; even after Passage 50, hTERT-GMECs had a near diploid complement of chromosomes. Furthermore, they did not gain the anchorage-independent growth property and were not associated with a malignant phenotype in vitro or in vivo.\n\nTelomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is a therapeutic target of oleanane triterpenoid CDDO-Me in prostate cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Yongbo; Gao, Xiaohua; Deeb, Dorrah; Arbab, Ali S; Gautam, Subhash C\n\n2012-12-11\n\nMethyl-2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oate (CDDO-Me) is an synthetic oleanane triterpenoid with strong antiprolifertive and proapoptotic activities in cancer cells. However, the effect of CDDO-Me on human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and its telomerase activity in prostate cancer cells has not been studied. We investigated the role of hTERT in mediating the anticancer activity of CDDO-Me in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis by CDDO-Me in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines was associated with the inhibition of hTERT gene expression, hTERT telomerase activity and a number of proteins that regulate hTERT transcriptionally and post-translationally. Furthermore, ablation of hTERT protein increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to CDDO-Me, whereas its overexpression rendered them resistant to CDDO-Me. In addition, inhibition of progression of preneoplastic lesions (i.e., low and high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasms, PINs) to adenocarcinoma of the prostate by CDDO-Me in TRAMP mice was associated with significant decrease in TERT and its regulatory proteins in the prostate gland. These data provide evidence that telomerase is a potential target of CDDO-Me for the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.\n\nhTERT gene immortalized human adipose-derived stem cells and its multiple differentiations: a preliminary investigation.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, L; Song, K; Qu, X; Wang, H; Zhu, H; Xu, X; Zhang, M; Tang, Y; Yang, X\n\n2013-03-01\n\nHuman adipose-derived adult stem cells (hADSCs) can express human telomerase reverse transcriptase phenotypes under an appropriate culture condition. Because adipose tissue is abundant and easily accessible, hADSCs offer a promising source of stem cells for tissue engineering application and other cell-based therapies. However, the shortage of cells number and the difficulty to proliferate, known as the \"Hayflick limit\" in vitro, limit their further clinical application. Here, hADSCs were transfected with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene by the lentiviral vector to prolong the lifespan of stem cells and even immortalize them. Following to this, the cellular properties and functionalities of the transfected cell lines were assayed. The results demonstrated that hADSCs had been successfully transfected with hTERT gene (hTERT-ADSCs). Then, hTERT-ADSCs were initially selected by G418 and subsequently expanded over 20 passages in vitro. Moreover, the qualitative and quantitative differentiation criteria for 20 passages of hTERT-ADSCs also demonstrated that hTERT-ADSCs could differentiate into osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis phenotypes in lineage-specific differentiation media. These findings confirmed that this transfection could prolong the lifespan of hADSCs.\n\nThe correlations between DNA methylation and polymorphisms in the promoter region of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene with postoperative recurrence in patients with thyroid carcinoma (TC).\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Jian-Jun; Zheng, Ping Chen Jue-Ru; Wang, Yao-Zong\n\n2017-06-06\n\nThis study aims at exploring the correlations between DNA methylation and polymorphisms in the promoter region of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene and postoperative recurrence in patients with thyroid carcinoma (TC). A total of 312 patients diagnosed with TC were chosen for the study and categorized into recurrence (nâ=â75) and non-recurrence (nâ=â237) groups. The hTERT rs2736100 and rs2736098 polymorphisms were detected by performing polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. DNA methylation in the promoter region of hTERT gene was evaluated by pyrosequencing. A telephonic and/or outpatient follow-up was conducted for all patients. The correlations of DNA methylation and polymorphisms in the promoter region of hTERT with postoperative recurrence of TC patients underwent analysis. The patient in the recurrence group showed evidently different pathological types and tumor stages in comparison to the non-recurrence group. The GG genotype of hTERT rs2736100 might increase the recurrence risk of TC patients. No correlations between hTERT rs2736098 polymorphisms and recurrence risk were observed. Compared to the TT + TG genotype frequency, the rs2736100 GG genotype frequency increased in patients without multicentricity, patients with extrathyroidal invasion, patients with lymph node metastasis, patients with undifferentiated carcinoma, and patients in the III + IV stage. The recurrence group showed significantly higher DNA methylation level compared to the non-recurrence group. The DNA methylation level was closely associated to tumor stage and lymph node metastasis of TC patients in the recurrence group. The DNA methylation and rs2736100 polymorphisms in the promoter region of hTERT gene might be in correlation to postoperative recurrence of TC patients.\n\nTransgenic rat model of childhood-onset dermatitis by overexpressing telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT).\n\nPubMed\n\nKaneko, Ryosuke; Sato, Atsuko; Hamada, Shun; Yagi, Takeshi; Ohsawa, Ichiro; Ohtsuki, Mamitaro; Kobayashi, Eiji; Hirabayashi, Masumi; Murakami, Takashi\n\n2016-08-01\n\nChildhood-onset dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders in children. Although various mouse models that mirror aspects of dermatitis have become available, there is still a need for an animal model that develops dermatitis in childhood and is more suitable for performing tissue transplantation experiments. There is emerging evidence that peripheral blood T lymphocytes from patients with dermatitis have significantly increased telomerase activity. Here, we developed telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)-expressing transgenic (Tg) rats that spontaneously developed eczematous skin inflammation in childhood. Newborn TERT-Tg rats developed visible dermatitis in 56Â % of cases, and the skin lesions microscopically showed spongiosis and acanthosis with infiltration of lymphocytes, eosinophils and mast cells. TERT-Tg rats with dermatitis exhibited increased CD4 (2.5-fold) and CD8 (fivefold) T cell numbers compared with dermatitis-free TERT-Tg rats. Stronger TERT activity was observed in the peripheral lymphocytes of dermatitis-positive TERT-Tg rats than those of dermatitis-free TERT-Tg rats. RT-PCR analysis revealed that IL-4 was markedly elevated in the spleen of dermatitis-positive TERT-Tg rats, and that interferon-gamma was increased in the dermatitis lesions. Moreover, skin grafting of TERT-Tg rats with dermatitis onto T cell-deficient nude rats demonstrated that the inflamed skin lesions could not be maintained. Taken together, the results suggest that TERT activation in T lymphocytes is one of the potential predisposing factors for dermatitis. Moreover, our results demonstrated that the TERT-Tg rats mirror aspects of human childhood-onset dermatitis and that these animals represent a potential animal model system for studying childhood-onset dermatitis.\n\nTelomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) - enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) network regulates lipid metabolism and DNA damage responses in glioblastoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmad, Fahim; Patrick, Shruti; Sheikh, Touseef; Sharma, Vikas; Pathak, Pankaj; Malgulwar, Prit Benny; Kumar, Anupam; Joshi, Shanker Datt; Sarkar, Chitra; Sen, Ellora\n\n2017-12-01\n\nElevated expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone H3K27 methyltransferase, was observed in gliomas harboring telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations. Given the known involvement of TERT and EZH2 in glioma progression, the correlation between the two and subsequently its involvement in metabolic programming was investigated. Inhibition of human telomerase reverse transcriptase either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation not only decreased EZH2 expression, but also (i) abrogated FASN levels, (ii) decreased de novo fatty acid accumulation, and (iii) increased ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) phosphorylation levels. Conversely, diminished TERT and FASN levels upon siRNA-mediated EZH2 knockdown indicated a positive correlation between TERT and EZH2. Interestingly, ATM kinase inhibitor rescued TERT inhibition-mediated decrease in FASN and EZH2 levels. Importantly, TERT promoter mutant tumors exhibited greater microsatellite instability, heightened FASN levels and lipid accumulation. Coherent with inÂ vitro findings, pharmacological inhibition of TERT by costunolide decreased lipid accumulation and elevated ATM expression in heterotypic xenograft glioma mouse model. By bringing TERT-EZH2 network at the forefront as driver of dysregulated metabolism, our findings highlight the non-canonical but distinct role of TERT in metabolic reprogramming and DNA damage responses in glioblastoma.

The mutation drives unusual monoallelic expression of TERT, allowing immortalization. Here we find that DNA methylation of the TERT CpG Island (CGI) is also allele-specific in multiple cancers. The expressed allele is hypomethylated, which is opposite to cancers without TERT promoter mutations. The continued presence of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) on the inactive allele suggests that histone marks of repressed chromatin may be causally linked to high DNA methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, TERT promoter DNA containing 5-methyl-CpG has much increased affinity for PRC2 in vitro. Thus, CpG methylation and histone marks appear to collaborate to maintain the two TERT alleles in different epigenetic states in TERT promoter-mutant cancers. Finally, in several cancers DNA methylation levels at the TERT CGI correlate with altered patient survival.

Since this region is characterized by low linkage disequilibrium (LD), we sought to identify additional SNPs could be related to pancreatic cancer risk, independently of rs401681. We performed an in-depth analysis of genetic variability of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and the telomerase RNA component (TERC) genes, in 5,550 subjects with pancreatic cancer and 7,585 controls from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) and the PanScan consortia. We identified a significant association between a variant in TERT and pancreatic cancer risk (rs2853677, OR=0.85; 95% CI=0.80â0.90, P=8.3Ã10â8). Additional analysis adjusting rs2853677 for rs401681 indicated that the two SNPs are independently associated with pancreatic cancer risk, as suggested by the low LD between them (r2=0.07, DÂ´=0.28). Three additional SNPs in TERT reached statistical significance after correction for multiple testing: rs2736100 (P=3.0Ã10â5), rs4583925 (P=4.0Ã10â5) and rs2735948 (P=5.0Ã10â5). In conclusion, we confirmed that the TERT locus is associated with pancreatic cancer risk, possibly through several independent variants.

Telomerase is rate limiting for tissue renewal and cell replication; however, the physiological role of telomerase in vascular diseases remains to be determined. The goal of the present study was to determine whether telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) affects proliferative vascular remodeling and to define the molecular mechanism by which TERT supports SMC proliferation. We first demonstrate high levels of TERT expression in replicating SMC of atherosclerotic and neointimal lesions. Using a model of guidewire-induced arterial injury, we demonstrate decreased neointima formation in TERT-deficient mice. Studies in SMC isolated from TERT-deficient and TERT overexpressing mice with normal telomere length established that TERT is necessary and sufficient for cell proliferation. TERT deficiency did not induce a senescent phenotype but resulted in G1 arrest albeit hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. This proliferative arrest was associated with stable silencing of the E2F1-dependent S-phase gene expression program and not reversed by ectopic overexpression of E2F1. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation and accessibility assays revealed that TERT is recruited to E2F1 target sites and promotes chromatin accessibility for E2F1 by facilitating the acquisition of permissive histone modifications. These data indicate a previously unrecognized role for TERT in neointima formation through epigenetic regulation of proliferative gene expression in SMC.

The current study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of plasma telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) levels in predicting tumour response and clinical outcome. Methods: 176 rectal cancer patients were included. Plasma samples were collected at baseline (before CRT=T0), 2 weeks after CRT was initiated (T1), post-CRT and before surgery (T2), and 4â8 months after surgery (T3) time points. Plasma TERT mRNA levels and total cell-free RNA were determined using real-time PCR. Results: Plasma levels of TERT were significantly lower at T2 (P<0.0001) in responders than in non-responders. Post-CRT TERT levels and the differences between pre- and post-CRT TERT levels independently predicted tumour response, and the prediction model had an area under curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73â0.87). Multiple analysis demonstrated that patients with detectable TERT levels at T2 and T3 time points had a risk of disease progression 2.13 (95% CI 1.10â4.11)-fold and 4.55 (95% CI 1.48â13.95)-fold higher, respectively, than those with undetectable plasma TERT levels. Conclusions: Plasma TERT levels are independent markers of tumour response and are prognostic of disease progression in rectal cancer patients who undergo neoadjuvant therapy.

Effective targeting in gene therapy requires accurate spatial and temporal control of gene expression. To develop a sufficient and accurate tumour-targeting method for cancer gene therapy, we have investigated the use of hyperthermia to control the expression of a transgene under the control of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter and eight heat shock elements (8HSEs). Luciferase reporters were constructed by inserting eight HSEs and the hTERT promoter (8HSEs-hTERTp) upstream of the pGL4.20 vector luciferase gene. The luciferase activity of the hTERT promoter and 8HSEs-hTERT promoter were then compared in the presence and absence of heat. The differences in luciferase activity were analysed using dual luciferase assays in SW480 (high hTERT expression), MKN28 and MRC-5 cells (low hTERT expression). The luciferase activity of the Hsp70B promoter was also compared to the 8HSEs-hTERT promoter in the above listed cell lines. Lentiviral vector and heat-induced expression of EGFP expression under the control of the 8HSEs-hTERT promoter in cultured cells and mouse tumour xenografts was measured by reverse transcription polymerase (RT-PCR), Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. hTERT promoter activity was higher in SW480 cells than in MKN28 or MRC-5 cells. At 43âÂ°C, the luciferase activity of the 8HSEs-hTERT promoter was significantly increased in SW480 cells, but not in MKN28 or MRC-5 cells. Importantly, the differences in luciferase activity were much more obvious in both high (SW480) and low (MKN28 and MRC-5) hTERT expressing cells when the activity of the 8HSEs-hTERT promoter was compared to the Hsp70B promoter. Moreover, under the control of 8HSEs-hTERT promoter in vitro and in vivo, EGFP expression was obviously increased by heat treatment in SW480 cells but not in MKN28 or MRC-5 cells, nor was expression increased under\n\nElucidation of the TMab-6 Monoclonal Antibody Epitope Against Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaneko, Mika K; Yamada, Shinji; Itai, Shunsuke; Chang, Yao-Wen; Nakamura, Takuro; Yanaka, Miyuki; Harada, Hiroyuki; Suzuki, Hiroyoshi; Kato, Yukinari\n\n2018-05-03\n\nTelomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and mutations of the TERT promoter are significant in the pathogenesis of 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas and isocitrate dehydrogenase gene wild-type glioblastomas, as well as melanomas and squamous cell carcinomas. We previously developed an antihuman TERT monoclonal antibody (mAb), TMab-6, which is applicable in immunohistochemistry for human tissues. However, the binding epitope of TMab-6 against TERT is yet to be elucidated. In this study, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry were utilized for investigating the epitope of TMab-6. The findings revealed that the critical epitope of TMab-6 is the TERT sequence PSTSRPPRPWD; Thr310 and Ser311 of TERT are especially significant amino acids for TMab-6 recognition.\n\nImmortalization of pig fibroblast cells by transposon-mediated ectopic expression of porcine telomerase reverse transcriptase.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Shan; Li, Yangyang; Chen, Yang; Zhu, Yue; Zhang, Xinyu; Xia, Xiaoli; Sun, Huaichang\n\n2016-08-01\n\nPigs are the most economically important livestock, but pig cell lines useful for physiological studies and/or vaccine development are limited. Although several pig cell lines have been generated by oncogene transformation or human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) immortalization, these cell lines contain viral sequences and/or antibiotic resistance genes. In this study, we established a new method for generating pig cell lines using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-mediated ectopic expression of porcine telomerase reverse transcriptase (pTERT). The performance of the new method was confirmed by generating a pig fibroblast cell (PFC) line. After transfection of primary PFCs with the SB transposon system, one cell clone containing the pTERT expression cassette was selected by dilution cloning and passed for different generations. After passage for more than 40 generations, the cell line retained stable expression of ectopic pTERT and continuous growth potential. Further characterization showed that the cell line kept the fibroblast morphology, growth curve, population doubling time, cloning efficiency, marker gene expression pattern, cell cycle distribution and anchorage-dependent growth property of the primary cells. These data suggest that the new method established is useful for generating pig cell lines without viral sequence and antibiotic resistant gene.\n\nThe unusually large Plasmodium telomerase reverse-transcriptase localizes in a discrete compartment associated with the nucleolus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFigueiredo, Luisa M.; Rocha, Eduardo P. C.; Mancio-Silva, Liliana; Prevost, Christine; Hernandez-Verdun, DaniÃ¨le; Scherf, Artur\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTelomerase replicates chromosome ends, a function necessary for maintaining genome integrity. We have identified the gene that encodes the catalytic reverse transcriptase (RT) component of this enzyme in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PfTERT) as well as the orthologous genes from two rodent and one simian malaria species. PfTERT is predicted to encode a basic protein that contains the major sequence motifs previously identified in known telomerase RTs (TERTs). At â¼2500 amino acids, PfTERT is three times larger than other characterized TERTs. We observed remarkable sequence diversity between TERT proteins of different Plasmodial species, with conserved domains alternating with hypervariable regions. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that PfTERT is expressed in asexual blood stage parasites that have begun DNA synthesis. Surprisingly, rather than at telomere clusters, PfTERT typically localizes into a discrete nuclear compartment. We further demonstrate that this compartment is associated with the nucleolus, hereby defined for the first time in P.falciparum.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer CDDO-Me inhibits hTERT protein expression. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer CDDO-Me inhibits hTERT telomerase activity. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer CDDO-Me inhibits hTERT regulatory proteins. -- Abstract: Methyl-2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oate (CDDO-Me) is a multifunctional oleanane synthetic triterpenoid with potent anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic properties. The mechanisms of the antisurvival and apoptosis-inducing activities of CDDO-Me and related derivatives of oleanolic acid have been defined; however, to date, no study has been carried out on the effect of CDDOs on human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene or telomerase activity. Here we report for the first time that inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosismoreÂ Â» by CDDO-Me in pancreatic cancer cell lines is associated with the inhibition of hTERT gene expression, hTERT telomerase activity and a number of proteins that regulate hTERT expression and activity. Furthermore, abrogation or overexpression of hTERT protein altered the susceptibility of tumor cells to CDDO-Me. These findings suggest that telomerase (hTERT) is a relevant target of CDDO-Me in pancreatic cancer cells.Â«Â less\n\nOverexpression of Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Induces Autism-like Excitatory Phenotypes in Mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Ki Chan; Rhee, Jeehae; Park, Jong-Eun; Lee, Dong-Keun; Choi, Chang Soon; Kim, Ji-Woon; Lee, Han-Woong; Song, Mi-Ryoung; Yoo, Hee Jeong; Chung, ChiHye; Shin, Chan Young\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn addition to its classical role as a regulator of telomere length, recent reports suggest that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression such as Î²-catenin-responsive pathways. Silencing or over-expression of TERT in cultured NPCs demonstrated that TERT induced glutamatergic neuronal differentiation. During embryonic brain development, expression of transcription factors involved in glutamatergic neuronal differentiation was increased in mice over-expressing TERT (TERT-tg mice). We observed increased expression of NMDA receptor subunits and phosphorylation of Î±-CaMKII in TERT-tg mice. TERT-tg mice showed autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like behavioral phenotypes as well as lowered threshold against electrically induced seizure. Interestingly, the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine restored behavioral abnormalities in TERT-tg mice. Consistent with the alteration in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio, TERT-tg mice showed autism-like behaviors, abnormal synaptic organization, and function in mPFC suggesting the role of altered TERT activity in the manifestation of ASD, which is further supported by the significant association of certain SNPs in Korean ASD patients.\n\nA second chance for telomerase reverse transcriptase in anticancer immunotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nZanetti, Maurizio\n\n2017-02-01\n\nTelomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is a self-antigen that is expressed constitutively in many tumours, and is, therefore, an important target for anticancer immunotherapy. In the past 10 years, trials of immunotherapy with TERT-based vaccines have demonstrated only modest benefits. In this Perspectives, I discuss the possible immunological reasons for this limited antitumour efficacy, and propose that advances in our understanding of the genetics and biology of the involvement of TERT in cancer provides the basis for renewed interest in TERT- based immunotherapy. Telomerase and TERT are expressed in cancer cells at every stage of tumour evolution, from the cancer stem cell to circulating tumour cells and tumour metastases. Many cancer types also harbour cells with mutations in the TERT promoter region, which increase transcriptional activation of this gene. These new findings should spur new interest in the development of TERT-based immunotherapies that are redesigned in line with established immunological considerations and working principles, and are tailored to patients stratified on the basis of TERT-promoter mutations and other underlying tumour characteristics. Thus, despite the disappointment of previous clinical trials, TERT offers the potential for personalized immunotherapy, perhaps in combination with immune-checkpoint inhibition.\n\nA new fluorescence/PET probe for targeting intracellular human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) using Tat peptide-conjugated IgM\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJung, Kyung oh; Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine; Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine\n\nDespite an increasing need for methods to visualize intracellular proteins inÂ vivo, the majority of antibody-based imaging methods available can only detect membrane proteins. The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an intracellular target of great interest because of its high expression in several types of cancer. In this study, we developed a new probe for hTERT using the Tat peptide. An hTERT antibody (IgG or IgM) was conjugated with the Tat peptide, a fluorescence dye and {sup 64}Cu. HT29 (hTERT+) and U2OS (hTERTâ) were used to visualize the intracellular hTERT. The hTERT was detected by RT-PCR and western blot. FluorescencemoreÂ Â» signals for hTERT were obtained by confocal microscopy, live cell imaging, and analyzed by Tissue-FAXS. In nude mice, tumors were visualized using the fluorescence imaging devices Maestroâ¢ and PETBOX. In RT-PCR and western blot, the expression of hTERT was detected in HT29Â cells, but not in U2OS cells. Fluorescence signals were clearly observed in HT29Â cells and in U2OS cells after 1Â h of treatment, but signals were only detected in HT29Â cells after 24Â h. Confocal microscopy showed that 9.65% of U2OS and 78.54% of HT29Â cells had positive hTERT signals. 3D animation images showed that the probe could target intranuclear hTERT in the nucleus. In mice models, fluorescence and PET imaging showed that hTERT in HT29 tumors could be efficiently visualized. In summary, we developed a new method to visualize intracellular and intranuclear proteins both inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo. - Highlights: â¢ We developed new probes for imaging hTERT using Tat-conjugated IgM antibodies labeled with a fluorescent dye and radioisotope. â¢ This probes could be used to overcome limitation of conventional antibody imaging system in live cell imaging. â¢ This system could be applicable to monitor intracellular and intranuclear proteins inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo.Â«Â less\n\nRearrangement of Upstream Sequences of the hTERT Gene During Cellular Immortalization\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhao, Yuanjun; Wang, Shuwen; Popova, Evgenya Y.; Grigoryev, Sergei A.; Zhu, Jiyue\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTelomerase expression, resulting from transcriptional activation of the hTERT gene, allows cells to acquire indefinite proliferative potential during cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis. However, mechanisms of hTERT gene activation in many immortal cell lines and cancer cells are poorly understood. Here, we report our studies on hTERT activation using genetically related pairs of telomerase-negative (Telâ) and -positive (Tel+) fibroblast lines. First, whereas transiently transfected plasmid reporters did not recapitulate the endogenous hTERT promoter, the promoter in chromosomally integrated bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) reporters was activated in a subset of Tel+ cells, indicating that activation of the hTERT promoter required native chromatin context and/or distal regulatory elements. Second, the hTERT gene, located near the telomere of chromosome 5p, was translocated in all three Tel+ cell lines but not in their parental pre-crisis cells and Telâ immortal siblings. The breakage points were mapped to regions upstream of the hTERT promoter, indicating that the hTERT gene was the target of these chromosomal rearrangements. In two Tel+ cell lines, translocation of the endogenous hTERT gene appeared to be the major mechanism of its activation as the activity of hTERT promoter in many chromosomally integrated BAC reporters, with intact upstream and downstream neighboring loci, remained relatively low. Therefore, our results suggest that rearrangement of upstream sequences is an important new mechanism of hTERT promoter activation during cellular immortalization. The chromosomal rearrangements likely occurred during cellular crisis and facilitated by telomere dysfunction. Such translocations allowed the hTERT promoter to escape from the native condensed chromatin environment.

TERT promoter mutations in inverted papilloma, urothelial carcinoma with inverted growth, urothelial carcinoma and cystitis glandularis were found in 15% (four of 26), 58% (15 of 26), 63% (45 of 71) and 0% (none of 25), respectively. C228T mutations were the predominant mutations (97%) found in bladder tumours, while C250T aberrations occurred in approximately 3% of bladder tumours. In the inverted papilloma group, TERT mutation occurred predominantly in female patients (P = 0.006). Among urothelial carcinomas, TERT promoter mutation status did not correlate with gender, histological grade or pathological stage. TERT promoter mutations were found in 15% of inverted papillomas. Our data suggest that there is a subpopulation of inverted papilloma that shares a carcinogenetic pathway with urothelial carcinoma with inverted growth and conventional urothelial carcinomas. Caution is warranted in exploring TERT promoter mutation status as a screening or adjunct diagnostic test for bladder cancer.

Dysplastic nodules (DNs) appear to be preneoplastic lesions of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). In this study, in order to characterize DNs, hTERT mRNA, hTERT gene dosage, and mRNA for c-myc, a transcriptional activator of hTERT were studied in human multi-step hepatocarcinogenesis. Fifty four hepatic nodules including 5 large regenerative nodules, 14 low-grade DNs, 7 high-grade DNs, 11 DNs with HCC foci and 17 HCCs, 23 livers with chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis, and 6 normal livers were examined. Transcript levels were measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and gene dosages by real-time PCR and Southern blotting. The hTERT mRNA levels increased with the progression of hepatocarcinogenesis, and a significant induction in the transition between low- and high-grade DNs was seen. Most high-grade DNs strongly expressed hTERT mRNA at levels similar to those of HCCs. Twenty-one percent of low-grade DNs had high levels of hTERT mRNA, up to those of high-grade DNs and there was no difference in the pathological features between low-grade DNs with and without increased hTERT mRNA levels. No correlation was found between hTERT mRNA levels, hTERT gene dosage, and c-myc mRNA levels. These results suggest that the induction of hTERT mRNA is an important early event and that its measurement by real-time quantitative RT-PCR is a useful tool to detect premalignant/malignant tendencies in hepatic nodules. However, hTERT gene dosage and c-myc expression are not the main mechanisms regulating hTERT expression in hepatocarcinogenesis.\n\nComprehensive Analysis of Interaction Networks of Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase with Multiple Bioinformatic Approaches: Deep Mining the Potential Functions of Telomere and Telomerase.\n\nPubMed\n\nHou, Chunyu; Wang, Fei; Liu, Xuewen; Chang, Guangming; Wang, Feng; Geng, Xin\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTelomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is the protein component of telomerase complex. Evidence has accumulated showing that the nontelomeric functions of TERT are independent of telomere elongation. However, the mechanisms governing the interaction between TERT and its target genes are not clearly revealed. The biological functions of TERT are not fully elucidated and have thus far been underestimated. To further explore these functions, we investigated TERT interaction networks using multiple bioinformatic databases, including BioGRID, STRING, DAVID, GeneCards, GeneMANIA, PANTHER, miRWalk, mirTarBase, miRNet, miRDB, and TargetScan. In addition, network diagrams were built using Cytoscape software. As competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) are endogenous transcripts that compete for the binding of microRNAs (miRNAs) by using shared miRNA recognition elements, they are involved in creating widespread regulatory networks. Therefore, the ceRNA regulatory networks of TERT were also investigated in this study. Interestingly, we found that the three genes PABPC1, SLC7A11, and TP53 were present in both TERT interaction networks and ceRNAs target genes. It was predicted that TERT might play nontelomeric roles in the generation or development of some rare diseases, such as Rift Valley fever and dyscalculia. Thus, our data will help to decipher the interaction networks of TERT and reveal the unknown functions of telomerase in cancer and aging-related diseases.\n\nP. berghei Telomerase Subunit TERT is Essential for Parasite Survival\n\nPubMed Central\n\nReliga, Agnieszka A.; Ramesar, Jai; Janse, Chris J.; Scherf, Artur; Waters, Andrew P.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTelomeres define the ends of chromosomes protecting eukaryotic cells from chromosome instability and eventual cell death. The complex regulation of telomeres involves various proteins including telomerase, which is a specialized ribonucleoprotein responsible for telomere maintenance. Telomeres of chromosomes of malaria parasites are kept at a constant length during blood stage proliferation. The 7-bp telomere repeat sequence is universal across different Plasmodium species (GGGTTT/CA), though the average telomere length varies. The catalytic subunit of telomerase, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), is present in all sequenced Plasmodium species and is approximately three times larger than other eukaryotic TERTs. The Plasmodium RNA component of TERT has recently been identified in silico. A strategy to delete the gene encoding TERT via double cross-over (DXO) homologous recombination was undertaken to study the telomerase function in P. berghei. Expression of both TERT and the RNA component (TR) in P. berghei blood stages was analysed by Western blotting and Northern analysis. Average telomere length was measured in several Plasmodium species using Telomere Restriction Fragment (TRF) analysis. TERT and TR were detected in blood stages and an average telomere length of â¼950 bp established. Deletion of the tert gene was performed using standard transfection methodologies and we show the presence of tert â mutants in the transfected parasite populations. Cloning of tert- mutants has been attempted multiple times without success. Thorough analysis of the transfected parasite populations and the parasite obtained from extensive parasite cloning from these populations provide evidence for a so called delayed death phenotype as observed in different organisms lacking TERT. The findings indicate that TERT is essential for P. berghei cell survival. The study extends our current knowledge on telomere biology in malaria parasites and validates further investigations\n\nElevated Human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene expression in blood cells associated with chronic and arsenic exposure in Inner Mongolia, China\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nBACKGROUND: Arsenic exposure is associated with human cancer. Telomerase containing the catalytic subunit, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), can extend telomeres of chromosomes, delay senescence and promoting cell proliferation leading to tumorigenesis. OBJECTIVE:...\n\nMitochondrial telomerase reverse transcriptase binds to and protects mitochondrial DNA and function from damage.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaendeler, Judith; DrÃ¶se, Stefan; BÃ¼chner, Nicole; Jakob, Sascha; Altschmied, Joachim; Goy, Christine; Spyridopoulos, Ioakim; Zeiher, Andreas M; Brandt, Ulrich; Dimmeler, Stefanie\n\n2009-06-01\n\nThe enzyme telomerase and its catalytic subunit the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) are important for maintenance of telomere length in the nucleus. Recent studies provided evidence for a mitochondrial localization of TERT. Therefore, we investigated the exact localization of TERT within the mitochondria and its function. Here, we demonstrate that TERT is localized in the matrix of the mitochondria. TERT binds to mitochondrial DNA at the coding regions for ND1 and ND2. Binding of TERT to mitochondrial DNA protects against ethidium bromide-induced damage. TERT increases overall respiratory chain activity, which is most pronounced at complex I and dependent on the reverse transcriptase activity of the enzyme. Moreover, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species are increased after genetic ablation of TERT by shRNA. Mitochondrially targeted TERT and not wild-type TERT revealed the most prominent protective effect on H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Lung fibroblasts from 6-month-old TERT(-/-) mice (F2 generation) showed increased sensitivity toward UVB radiation and heart mitochondria exhibited significantly reduced respiratory chain activity already under basal conditions, demonstrating the protective function of TERT in vivo. Mitochondrial TERT exerts a novel protective function by binding to mitochondrial DNA, increasing respiratory chain activity and protecting against oxidative stress-induced damage.\n\nTelomerase Activation in Atherosclerosis and Induction of Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Expression by Inflammatory Stimuli in Macrophages\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGizard, Florence; Heywood, Elizabeth B.; Findeisen, Hannes M.; Zhao, Yue; Jones, Karrie L.; Cudejko, CÃ¨line; Post, Ginell R.; Staels, Bart; Bruemmer, Dennis\n\n2010-01-01\n\nObjective Telomerase serves as a critical regulator of tissue renewal. Although telomerase activity is inducible in response to various environmental cues, it remains unknown whether telomerase is activated during the inflammatory remodeling underlying atherosclerosis formation. To address this question, we investigated in the present study the regulation of telomerase in macrophages and during atherosclerosis development in LDL-receptor-deficient mice. Methods and Results We demonstrate that inflammatory stimuli activate telomerase in macrophages by inducing the expression of the catalytic subunit telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). Reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified a previously unrecognized NF-ÎºB response element in the TERT promoter, to which NF-ÎºB is recruited during inflammation. Inhibition of NF-ÎºB signaling completely abolished the induction of TERT expression, characterizing TERT as a bona fide NF-ÎºB target gene. Furthermore, functional experiments revealed that TERT-deficiency results in a senescent cell phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate high levels of TERT expression in macrophages of human atherosclerotic lesions and establish that telomerase is activated during atherosclerosis development in LDL-receptor-deficient mice. Conclusion These results characterize TERT as a previously unrecognized NF-ÎºB target gene in macrophages and demonstrate that telomerase is activated during atherosclerosis. This induction of TERT expression prevents macrophage senescence and may have important implications for the development of atherosclerosis.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains an insurmountable challenge among neurodevelopmental disorders due to its heterogeneity, unresolved pathological pathways and lack of treatment. We previously reported that VPA-exposed rats and cultured rat primary neurons have increased Pax6 expression during post-midterm embryonic development which led to the sequential upregulation of glutamatergic neuronal markers. In this study, we provide experimental evidence that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a protein component of ribonucleoproteins complex of telomerase, is involved in the abnormal components caused by VPA in addition to Pax6 and its downstream signals. In embryonic rat brains and cultured rat primary neural progenitor cells (NPCs), VPA induced the increased expression of TERT as revealed by Western blot, RT-PCR, and immunostainings. The HDAC inhibitor property of VPA is responsible for the TERT upregulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that VPA increased the histone acetylation but blocked the HDAC1 binding to both Pax6 and Tert genes. Interestingly, the VPA-induced TERT overexpression resulted to sequential upregulations of glutamatergic markers such as Ngn2 and NeuroD1, and inter-synaptic markers such as PSD-95, Î±-CaMKII, vGluT1 and synaptophysin. Transfection of Tert siRNA reversed the effects of VPA in cultured NPCs confirming the direct involvement of TERT in the expression of those markers. This study suggests the involvement of TERT in the VPA-induced autistic phenotypes and has important implications for the role of TERT as a modulator of balanced neuronal development and transmission in the brain.\n\nRecurrent TERT promoter mutations identified in a large-scale study of multiple tumour types are associated with increased TERT expression and telomerase activation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Dong-Sheng; Wang, Zhaohui; He, Xu-Jun; Diplas, Bill H; Yang, Rui; Killela, Patrick J; Meng, Qun; Ye, Zai-Yuan; Wang, Wei; Jiang, Xiao-Ting; Xu, Li; He, Xiang-Lei; Zhao, Zhong-Sheng; Xu, Wen-Juan; Wang, Hui-Ju; Ma, Ying-Yu; Xia, Ying-Jie; Li, Li; Zhang, Ru-Xuan; Jin, Tao; Zhao, Zhong-Kuo; Xu, Ji; Yu, Sheng; Wu, Fang; Liang, Junbo; Wang, Sizhen; Jiao, Yuchen; Yan, Hai; Tao, Hou-Quan\n\n2015-05-01\n\nSeveral somatic mutation hotspots were recently identified in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter region in human cancers. Large scale studies of these mutations in multiple tumour types are limited, in particular in Asian populations. This study aimed to: analyse TERT promoter mutations in multiple tumour types in a large Chinese patient cohort, investigate novel tumour types and assess the functional significance of the mutations. TERT promoter mutation status was assessed by Sanger sequencing for 13 different tumour types and 799 tumour tissues from Chinese cancer patients. Thymic epithelial tumours, gastrointestinal leiomyoma, and gastric schwannoma were included, for which the TERT promoter has not been previously sequenced. Functional studies included TERT expression by reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), telomerase activity by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay and promoter activity by the luciferase reporter assay. TERT promoter mutations were highly frequent in glioblastoma (83.9%), urothelial carcinoma (64.5%), oligodendroglioma (70.0%), medulloblastoma (33.3%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (31.4%). C228T and C250T were the most common mutations. In urothelial carcinoma, several novel rare mutations were identified. TERT promoter mutations were absent in gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), thymic epithelial tumours, gastrointestinal leiomyoma, gastric schwannoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gastric and pancreatic cancer. TERT promoter mutations highly correlated with upregulated TERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity in adult gliomas. These mutations differentially enhanced the transcriptional activity of the TERT core promoter. TERT promoter mutations are frequent in multiple tumour types and have similar distributions in Chinese cancer patients. The functional significance of these mutations reflect the importance to telomere maintenance and hence tumourigenesis, making them\n\nFine-mapping identifies multiple prostate cancer risk loci at 5p15, one of which associates with TERT expression\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKote-Jarai, Zsofia; Saunders, Edward J.; Leongamornlert, Daniel A.; Tymrakiewicz, Malgorzata; Dadaev, Tokhir; Jugurnauth-Little, Sarah; Ross-Adams, Helen; Al Olama, Ali Amin; Benlloch, Sara; Halim, Silvia; Russel, Roslin; Dunning, Alison M.; Luccarini, Craig; Dennis, Joe; Neal, David E.; Hamdy, Freddie C.; Donovan, Jenny L.; Muir, Ken; Giles, Graham G.; Severi, Gianluca; Wiklund, Fredrik; Gronberg, Henrik; Haiman, Christopher A.; Schumacher, Fredrick; Henderson, Brian E.; Le Marchand, Loic; Lindstrom, Sara; Kraft, Peter; Hunter, David J.; Gapstur, Susan; Chanock, Stephen; Berndt, Sonja I.; Albanes, Demetrius; Andriole, Gerald; Schleutker, Johanna; Weischer, Maren; Canzian, Federico; Riboli, Elio; Key, Tim J.; Travis, Ruth C.; Campa, Daniele; Ingles, Sue A.; John, Esther M.; Hayes, Richard B.; Pharoah, Paul; Khaw, Kay-Tee; Stanford, Janet L.; Ostrander, Elaine A.; Signorello, Lisa B.; Thibodeau, Stephen N.; Schaid, Dan; Maier, Christiane; Vogel, Walther; Kibel, Adam S.; Cybulski, Cezary; Lubinski, Jan; Cannon-Albright, Lisa; Brenner, Hermann; Park, Jong Y.; Kaneva, Radka; Batra, Jyotsna; Spurdle, Amanda; Clements, Judith A.; Teixeira, Manuel R.; Govindasami, Koveela; Guy, Michelle; Wilkinson, Rosemary A.; Sawyer, Emma J.; Morgan, Angela; Dicks, Ed; Baynes, Caroline; Conroy, Don; Bojesen, Stig E.; Kaaks, Rudolf; Vincent, Daniel; Bacot, FranÃ§ois; Tessier, Daniel C.; Easton, Douglas F.; Eeles, Rosalind A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAssociations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 5p15 and multiple cancer types have been reported. We have previously shown evidence for a strong association between prostate cancer (PrCa) risk and rs2242652 at 5p15, intronic in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene that encodes TERT. To comprehensively evaluate the association between genetic variation across this region and PrCa, we performed a fine-mapping analysis by genotyping 134 SNPs using a custom Illumina iSelect array or Sequenom MassArray iPlex, followed by imputation of 1094 SNPs in 22 301 PrCa cases and 22 320 controls in The PRACTICAL consortium. Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis identified four signals in the promoter or intronic regions of TERT that independently associated with PrCa risk. Gene expression analysis of normal prostate tissue showed evidence that SNPs within one of these regions also associated with TERT expression, providing a potential mechanism for predisposition to disease.

In the current study, we made the surprising finding that catalytically inactive hTERT (hTERT-D868A), elongation-defective hTERT (hTERT-HA), and telomere recruitment-defective hTERT (hTERT N+T) also cooperate with E7 in mediating bypass of the senescence blockade and effecting cell immortalization. This suggests that hTERT has activities independent of its telomere maintenance functions that mediate transit across this restriction point. Since hTERT has been shown to have a role in gene activation, we performed microarray studies and discovered that E6, hTERT and mutant hTERT proteins altered the expression of highly overlapping sets of cellular genes. Most important, the E6 and hTERT proteins induced mRNA and protein levels of Bmi1, the core subunit of the Polycomb Group (PcG) complex 1. We show further that Bmi1 substitutes for E6 or hTERT in cell immortalization. Finally, tissue array studies demonstrated that expression of Bmi1 increased with the severity of cervical dysplasia, suggesting a potential role in the progression of cervical cancer. Together, these data demonstrate that hTERT has extra-telomeric activities that facilitate cell immortalization and that its induction of Bmi1 is one potential mechanism for mediating this activity. PMID:23592995\n\nVariants in TERT influencing telomere length are associated with paranoid schizophrenia risk.\n\nPubMed\n\nRao, Shuquan; Ye, Ning; Hu, Huiling; Shen, Yan; Xu, Qi\n\n2016-04-01\n\nSchizophrenia is one of the most severe psychiatric disorders, with a high heritability of up to 80%. Several studies have reported telomere dysfunction in schizophrenia, and common variants in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene. TERT is a key component of the telomerase complex that maintains telomere length by addition of telomere repeats to telomere ends, and has repeatedly shown association with mean lymphocyte telomere length (LTL). Thus, we hypothesized that TERT may be a novel susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Using a Taqman protocol, we genotyped eight tag SNPs from the TERT locus in 1,072 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 1,284 control subjects from a Chinese Han population. We also measured mean LTL in 98 cases and 109 controls using a quantitative PCR-based technique. Chi-square tests showed that two SNPs, rs2075786 (Pâ=â0.0009, ORâ=â0.76, 95%CIâ=â0.65-0.90) and rs4975605 (Pâ=â0.0026, ORâ=â0.73, 95%CIâ=â0.60-0.90), were associated with a protective effect, while rs10069690 was associated with risk of paranoid schizophrenia (Pâ=â0.0044, ORâ=â1.23, 95%CIâ=â1.07-1.42). Additionally, the rs2736118-rs2075786 haplotype showed significant association with paranoid schizophrenia (Pâ=â0.0013). Moreover, mean LTL correlated with rs2075786 genotypes was significantly shorter in the patient group than the control group. The present results suggest that the TERT gene may be a novel candidate involved in the development of paranoid schizophrenia.

Cancer cells can attain immortality by activating TERT to maintain telomere length and telomerase activity, which is a crucial step of tumorigenesis. Two somatic mutations in the TERT promoter (C228T; C250T) have been identified as gain-of-function mutations that promote transcriptional activation of TERT in multiple cancers, such as melanoma and glioblastoma. A recent study investigating TERT promoter mutations in ovarian carcinomas found C228T and C250T mutations in 15.9% of clear cell carcinomas. However, it is unknown whether these mutations are frequent in other ovarian cancer subtypes, in particular, sex cord-stromal tumors including adult granulosa cell tumors. We performed whole-genome sequencing on ten adult granulosa cell tumors with matched normal blood and identified a TERT C228T promoter mutation in 50% of tumors. We found that adult granulosa cell tumors with mutated TERT promoter have increased expression of TERT mRNA and exhibited significantly longer telomeres compared to those with wild-type TERT promoter. Extension cohort analysis using allelic discrimination revealed the TERT C228T mutation in 51 of 229 primary adult granulosa cell tumors (22%), 24 of 58 recurrent adult granulosa cell tumors (41%), and 1 of 22 other sex cord-stromal tumors (5%). There was a significant difference in overall survival between patients with TERT C228T promoter mutation in the primary tumors and those without it (pâ=â0.00253, log-rank test). In seven adult granulosa cell tumors, we found the TERT C228T mutation present in recurrent tumors and absent in the corresponding primary tumor. Our data suggest that TERT C228T promoter mutations may have an important role in progression of adult granulosa cell tumors.\n\nCancer-associated TERT promoter mutations abrogate telomerase silencing\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChiba, Kunitoshi; Johnson, Joshua Z; Vogan, Jacob M; Wagner, Tina; Boyle, John M; Hockemeyer, Dirk\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMutations in the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter are the most frequent non-coding mutations in cancer, but their molecular mechanism in tumorigenesis has not been established. We used genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells with physiological telomerase expression to elucidate the mechanism by which these mutations contribute to human disease. Surprisingly, telomerase-expressing embryonic stem cells engineered to carry any of the three most frequent TERT promoter mutations showed only a modest increase in TERT transcription with no impact on telomerase activity. However, upon differentiation into somatic cells, which normally silence telomerase, cells with TERT promoter mutations failed to silence TERT expression, resulting in increased telomerase activity and aberrantly long telomeres. Thus, TERT promoter mutations are sufficient to overcome the proliferative barrier imposed by telomere shortening without additional tumor-selected mutations.

Extended-life-span cells have been generated by transfection with the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene. hTERT transfected cell lines may be of outstanding interest to monitor the effect of drugs targeting the telomerase activity. The incidence of hTERT gene transfection at the proteome level is a prerequisite to that purpose. The effect of the transfection has been studied on the proteome of human fibroblast (WI38). Cytosolic and nuclear fractions of WI38 cells, empty vector transfected WI38 (WI38-HPV) and hTERT WI38 cells were submitted to a 2D-DIGE (Two-Dimensional Differential In-Gel Electrophoresis) analysis. Only spots that had a similar abundance in WI38 and WI38-HPV, but were differentially expressed in WI38 hTERT were selected for MS identification. This method directly points to the proteins linked with the hTERT expression. Number of false positive differentially expressed proteins has been excluded by using control WI38-HPV cells. The proteome alteration induced by hTERT WI38 transfection should be taken into account in subsequent use of the cell line for anti-telomerase drugs evaluation. 2D-DIGE experiment shows that 57 spots out of 2246 are significantly differentially expressed in the cytosolic fraction due to hTERT transfection, and 38 were confidently identified. In the nuclear fraction, 44 spots out of 2172 were selected in the differential proteome analysis, and 14 were identified. The results show that, in addition to elongating telomeres, hTERT gene transfection has other physiological roles, among which an enhanced ER capacity and a potent cell protection against apoptosis. We show that the methodology reduces the complexity of the proteome analysis and highlights proteins implicated in other processes than telomere elongation. hTERT induced proteome changes suggest that telomerase expression enhances natural cell repair\n\nDistinct profiles of TERT promoter mutations and telomerase expression in head and neck cancer and cervical carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnnunziata, Clorinda; Pezzuto, Francesca; Greggi, Stefano; Ionna, Franco; Losito, Simona; Botti, Gerardo; Buonaguro, Luigi; Buonaguro, Franco M; Tornesello, Maria Lina\n\n2018-03-31\n\nTwo recurrent mutations (-124 Gâ>âA and -146 Gâ>âA) in the core promoter region of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene create consensus binding sites for ETS transcription factors and cause increased TERT expression in several tumour types. We analyzed TERT promoter mutations and TERT mRNA levels in head and neck cancer, cervical carcinoma and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) as well as in C-4I, CaSki, HeLa and SiHa cervical cell lines. Nucleotide sequence analysis of TERT promoter region showed that 33.3% of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 16.8% of cervical SCC harboured mutually exclusive G to A transitions at nucleotide position -124 or -146. TERT promoter was mutated at nucleotide -146 (Gâ>âA) in SiHa cell line. Other nucleotide changes creating in some cases putative ETS binding sites were more frequent in oral SCC (26.7%) than in cervical carcinoma (4.8%). The frequency of mutations was independent of human papillomavirus (HPV) tumour status in both cervical and oral cancer. Expression of TERT gene was significantly higher in TERT promoter mutated (-124Gâ>âA or -146Gâ>âA) cervical SCC compared to not mutated SCC irrespective of HPV16 E6 and E7 levels. Such hot spot changes were not detected in oropharyngeal SCC, cervical adenocarcinoma and CIN lesions. Our results suggest that TERT promoter mutations play a relevant role in oral SCC as well as in cervical SCC, besides the already known effect of HPV16 E6 protein on TERT expression.

The limiting determinant of telomerase activity is the catalytic component TERT, and TERT expression is closely correlated with telomerase activity and cancer initiation and disease progression. For this reason the regulation of TERT levels in the cell is of great importance. microRNAs (miRs) function as an additional regulatory level in cells, crucial for defining expression boundaries, proper cell fate decisions, cell cycle control, genome integrity, cell death and metastasis. We performed an anti-miR library screen to identity novel miRs, which participate in the control of telomerase. We identified the tumor suppressor miR (miR-128) as a novel endogenous telomerase inhibitor and determined that miR-128 significantly reduces the mRNA and protein levels of Tert in a panel of cancer cell lines. We further evaluated the mechanism by which miR-128 regulates TERT and demonstrated that miR-128 interacts directly with the coding sequence of TERT mRNA in both HeLa cells and teratoma cells. Interestingly, the functional miR-128 binding site in TERT mRNA, is conserved between TERT and the other cellular reverse transcriptase encoded by Long Interspersed Elements-1 (LINE-1 or L1), which can also contribute to the oncogenic phenotype of cancer. This finding supports the novel idea that miRs may function in parallel pathways to inhibit tumorigenesis, by regulating a group of enzymes (such as RT) by targeting conserved binding sites in the coding region of both enzymes.

While most somatic tissues silence TERT transcription resulting in telomere shortening, cells derived from cancer or cardiovascular diseases express TERT and activate telomerase. In the present study, we demonstrate that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition induces TERT transcription and promoter activation. At the protein level in contrast, HDAC inhibition decreases TERT protein abundance through enhanced degradation, which decreases telomerase activity and induces senescence. Finally, we demonstrate that HDAC inhibition decreases TERT expression during vascular remodeling in vivo. These data illustrate a differential regulation of TERT transcription and protein stability by HDAC inhibition and suggest that TERT may constitute an important target for the anti-proliferative efficacy of HDAC inhibitors.

Telomerase activity is primarily attributed to the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). It has been reported that introduction of an intact human chromosome 3 into the human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC3 suppresses the tumorigenicity of these cells. However, the mechanisms that regulate tumorigenicity have not been elucidated. To determine whether this reduction in tumorigenicity was accompanied by a reduction in telomerase activity, we investigated the transcriptional activation of TERT in HSC3 microcell hybrid clones with an introduced human chromosome 3 (HSC3#3). HSC#3Â cells showed inhibition of hTERT transcriptionmoreÂ Â» compared to that of the parental HSC3 cells. Furthermore, cell fusion experiments showed that hybrids of HSC3 cells and cells of the RCC23 renal carcinoma cell line, which also exhibits suppression of TERT transcription by the introduction of human chromosome 3, also displayed suppressed TERT transcription. These results suggested that human chromosome 3 may carry functionally distinct, additional TERT repressor genes. - Highlights: â¢ hTERT mRNA expression level decreased in the chromosome 3 introduced HSC3 clones. â¢ hTERT mRNA expression level was tend to suppressed in HSC3 and RCC23 hybrid cells. â¢ We provide evidence that human chromosome 3 carries at least two distinct hTERT regulatory factors.Â«Â less\n\nBiological significance of TERT promoter mutation in papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Chung-Chieh; Huang, Chao-Yuan; Jhuang, Yu-Lin; Chen, Chih-Chi; Jeng, Yung-Ming\n\n2018-04-01\n\nMutations in FGFR3 and the promoter region of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene have been found frequently in urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder. However, related data for papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) are limited. In this study, we investigated the mutation status of the TERT promoter, FGFR3 and HRAS in low-grade papillary urothelial neoplasms and evaluated their prognostic significance. The cases included in this study comprised 21 inverted papillomas, 30 PUNLMPs and 34 low-grade non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinomas (NIPUCs). TERT promoter mutations were observed in 10 (33%) PUNLMPs and 17 (50%) low-grade NIPUCs, but not in any inverted papilloma. FGFR3 mutations were observed more frequently in PUNLMP and low-grade NIPUC than in inverted papillomas (PÂ =Â 0.009), whereas the opposite trend was noted for HRAS mutations (PÂ <Â 0.001). Regarding the clinical outcome, TERT promoter mutation was associated with a higher recurrence rate in PUNLMP (PÂ =Â 0.024) but not in low-grade NIPUC (PÂ =Â 0.530). Notably, PUNLMP cases with TERT promoter mutations had a similar recurrence rate to that in low-grade NIPUC cases (PÂ =Â 0.487). Our results suggest that the status of the TERT promoter mutation may serve as a biomarker of prognostic stratification in patients with PUNLMP.

First of all, guandinylated 3-gluconamidopropyl methacrylamide-s-3-aminopropyl methacrylamide copolymers (guanidinylated GAPMA-s-APMA, abbreviated as GGA) were prepared via aqueous reversible addition--fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT). Then, three target hTERT siRNA TERT-1, TERT-2 and TERT-3 were designed and combined with GGA copolymers to form siRNA/GGA polyplexes. The polyplexes were examined by dynamic light scattering and agarose gel electrophoresis. The results indicated that GGA copolymers can condense siRNA effectively to form particles with the diameter from 157ânm to 411ânm and zeta potential values in the range from +3.7 to +15.8âmV at various charge ratios (N/P). The MTT assay data of siRNA/GGA polyplexes on human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) indicated that GGA copolymer had better cell viabilities than polyethylenimine (PEI). Furthermore, the transfection of siRNA/GGA polyplexes was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in HepG2. It was found that siRNA/GGA polyplexes could effectively silence hTERT mRNA expression in serum-free media (p<0.01). In the presence of serum, the hTERT mRNA expression in HepG2 cells have significant difference (p<0.01) between siRNA/GGA3 polyplexes and blank. The results showed that the GAPMA component can reduce the aggregation of protein in serum media. Therefore, the enhancement of transfection may be attributed to the combination of guadino groups and glucose component. And, the guandinylated 3-gluconamidopropyl methacrylamide-s-3-aminopropyl methacrylamide copolymers might be promise in gene delivery.\n\nTelomerase reverse transcriptase protects against angiotensin II-induced microvascular endothelial dysfunction.\n\nPubMed\n\nAit-Aissa, Karima; Kadlec, Andrew O; Hockenberry, Joseph; Gutterman, David D; Beyer, Andreas M\n\n2018-05-01\n\nA rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) may contribute to cardiovascular disease by reducing nitric oxide (NO) levels, leading to loss of NO's vasodilator and anti-inflammatory effects. Although primarily studied in larger conduit arteries, excess ROS release and a corresponding loss of NO also occur in smaller resistance arteries of the microcirculation, but the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic targets have not been fully characterized. We examined whether either of the two subunits of telomerase, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) or telomerase RNA component (TERC), affect microvascular ROS production and peak vasodilation at baseline and in response to in vivo administration to angiotensin II (ANG II). We report that genetic loss of TERT [maximal dilation: 52.0âÂ±â6.1% with vehicle, 60.4âÂ±â12.9% with N Ï -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), and 32.2âÂ±â12.2% with polyethylene glycol-catalase (PEG-Cat) ( P < 0.05), means Â± SD, n = 9-19] but not TERC [maximal dilation: 79âÂ±â5% with vehicle, 10.7âÂ±â9.8% with l-NAME ( P < 0.05), and 86.4âÂ±â8.4% with PEG-Cat, n = 4-7] promotes flow-induced ROS formation. Moreover, TERT knockout exacerbates the microvascular dysfunction resulting from in vivo ANG II treatment, whereas TERT overexpression is protective [maximal dilation: 88.22âÂ±â4.6% with vehicle vs. 74.0âÂ±â7.3% with ANG II (1,000 ngÂ·kg -1 Â·min -1 ) ( P = not significant), n = 4]. Therefore, loss of TERT but not TERC may be a key contributor to the elevated microvascular ROS levels and reduced peak dilation observed in several cardiovascular disease pathologies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study identifies telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) but not telomerase RNA component as a key factor regulating endothelium-dependent dilation in the microcirculation. Loss of TERT activity leads to microvascular dysfunction but not conduit vessel dysfunction in first-generation mice.

However, the precise location and identity of the sequence(s) responsible for hTERT transcriptional repression remains elusive. In order to identify critical hTERT repressor sequences located within human chromosome 3p12-p22, we investigated hTERT transcriptional activity within 21NT microcell hybrid clones containing chromosome 3 fragments. Mapping of chromosome 3 structure in a single hTERT-repressed 21NT-#3fragment hybrid clone, revealed a 490kb region of deletion localised to 3p21.3 and encompassing the histone H3, lysine 36 (H3K36) trimethyltransferase enzyme SETD2; a putative tumour suppressor gene in breast cancer. Three additional genes, BAP1, PARP-3 and PBRM1, were also selected for further investigation based on their location within the 3p21.1-p21.3 region, together with their documented role in the epigenetic regulation of target gene expression or hTERT regulation. All four genes (SETD2, BAP1, PARP-3 and PBRM1) were found to be expressed at low levels in 21NT. Gene copy number variation (CNV) analysis of SETD2, BAP1, PARP-3 and PBRM1 within a panel of nine breast cancer cell lines demonstrated single copy number loss of all candidate genes within five (56%) cell lines (including 21NT cells). Stable, forced overexpression of BAP1, but not PARP2, SETD2 or PBRM1, within 21NT cells was associated with a significant reduction in hTERT expression levels relative to wild-type controls.

However, research related to astrocytoma, the most common primary brain neoplasm, is rare. In this study, we chose 21 tagging SNPs (tSNPs), previously reported to be associated with glioma risk in a Chinese case-control study from Xi'an, China, and identified their contributions to astrocytoma susceptibility. We found an association with astrocytoma susceptibility for two tSNPs (rs6010620 and rs2853676) in two different genes: regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), respectively. We confirmed our results using recessive, dominant, and additive models. In the recessive model, we found two tSNPs (rs2297440 and rs6010620) associated with increased astrocytoma risk. In the dominant model, we found that rs2853676 was associated with increased astrocytoma risk. In the additive model, all three tSNPs (rs2297440, rs2853676, and rs6010620) were associated with increased astrocytoma risk. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the potential roles of RTEL1 and TERT in astrocytoma development.\n\nInsights into the evolution of mammalian telomerase: platypus TERT shares similarities with genes of birds and other reptiles and localizes on sex chromosomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nHrdliÄkovÃ¡, Radmila; Nehyba, JiÅÃ­; Lim, Shu Ly; GrÃ¼tzner, Frank; Bose, Henry R\n\n2012-06-01\n\nThe TERT gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex and is responsible for maintaining telomere length. Vertebrate telomerase has been studied in eutherian mammals, fish, and the chicken, but less attention has been paid to other vertebrates. The platypus occupies an important evolutionary position, providing unique insight into the evolution of mammalian genes. We report the cloning of a platypus TERT (OanTERT) ortholog, and provide a comparison with genes of other vertebrates. The OanTERT encodes a protein with a high sequence similarity to marsupial TERT and avian TERT. Like the TERT of sauropsids and marsupials, as well as that of sharks and echinoderms, OanTERT contains extended variable linkers in the N-terminal region suggesting that they were present already in basal vertebrates and lost independently in ray-finned fish and eutherian mammals. Several alternatively spliced OanTERT variants structurally similar to avian TERT variants were identified. Telomerase activity is expressed in all platypus tissues like that of cold-blooded animals and murine rodents. OanTERT was localized on pseudoautosomal regions of sex chromosomes X3/Y2, expanding the homology between human chromosome 5 and platypus sex chromosomes. Synteny analysis suggests that TERT co-localized with sex-linked genes in the last common mammalian ancestor. Interestingly, female platypuses express higher levels of telomerase in heart and liver tissues than do males. OanTERT shares many features with TERT of the reptilian outgroup, suggesting that OanTERT represents the ancestral mammalian TERT. Features specific to TERT of eutherian mammals have, therefore, evolved more recently after the divergence of monotremes.\n\nImplication of human telomerase reverse transcriptase in cervical carcinogenesis and cancer recurrence.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, P-H; Ko, J-L\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the implication of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in cervical carcinogenesis and cancer recurrence. One hundred three cases of uterine cervix, including 20 normal, 13 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 30 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and 40 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tissues, were evaluated for hTERT immunoreactivity. The expressions of hTERT in normal, LSIL, HSIL, and SCC tissues were compared by Fisher exact or Chi-square test. The relationships between hTERT and clinicopathologic variables of SCC were also assessed. Furthermore, SCC patients were subdivided into negative and positive hTERT expression subgroups, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to plot the cumulative recurrence hazard for 5 years. There was a significant difference for hTERT expression between LSIL and HSIL subgroups (P < 0.001) but no significant difference between normal and LSIL as well as HSIL and SCC subgroups. For SCC patients, hTERT expression was positive in lymph nodes, vagina, and parametrium metastastic cases. However, it did not reach a significant difference. The cumulative recurrence hazard for 5 years was about 29% in positive hTERT expression subgroup compared to 0% in negative hTERT subgroup (P = 0.2866). In conclusion, a point stage of HSIL exists in the progression of cervical carcinogenesis when the hTERT expression increases significantly. Moreover, SCC patients with positive hTERT expression may have higher cumulative recurrence hazard.\n\nInsights into the evolution of mammalian telomerase: Platypus TERT shares similarities with genes of birds and other reptiles and localizes on sex chromosomes\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground The TERT gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex and is responsible for maintaining telomere length.

After statistically analyzing the results, we found significant effects of TERT overexpression in sociability, social novelty preference, anxiety, nest building, and electroseizure threshold in the males but not their female littermates. Along these differences are the male-specific increased expressions of postsynaptic proteins which are the NMDA and AMPA receptors in the prefrontal cortex. The vGluT1 presynaptic proteins, but not GAD, were upregulated in both sexes of TERT-tg mice, although it is more significantly pronounced in the male group. Here, we confirmed that the behavioral effect of TERT overexpression in mice was male-specific, suggesting that the aberration of this gene and its downstream pathways preferentially affect the functional development of the male brain, consistent with the male preponderance in ASD.\n\nnm23-H1 gene driven by hTERT promoter induces inhibition of invasive phenotype and metastasis of lung cancer xenograft in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nFan, Yu; Yao, Yibing; Li, Lu; Wu, Zhihao; Xu, Feng; Hou, Mei; Wu, Heng; Shen, Yali; Wan, Haisu; Zhou, Qinghua\n\n2013-02-01\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women worldwide. Tumor metastasis is an essential aspect of lung cancer progression and patient death. The nm23-H1 gene has been extensively investigated as a metastasis suppressor gene. Our previous studies have revealed: that a significant relationship exists between the low-level expression nm23-H1 in primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with increased metastasis and a poor prognosis; that L9981-nm23-H1 cells (a nm23-H1 transfactant cell) exhibited lower cell proliferation rates, more G0/G1 phase growth, and an increase in apoptosis with a dramatic decrease in the tumor cells' ability to invade than L9981 cells did; and that L9981- nm23-H1 cells also demonstrated a significantly reduced lymph node and distant metastatic capacity in vivo than L9981 cells did in nude mice. In this study, we construct a plasmid containing the nm23-H1 gene, which was driven by the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter. We evaluated the anti-invasion and anti-metastatic effects of pGL3-hTP-nm23 on L9981, a human large cell lung cancer cell line with nm23-H1 negative expression, by transwell assay in vitro and bioluminescence in nude mice models. The toxicity of pGL3-hTP-nm23 and its effects on tumor growth were evaluated in nude mice models after gene therapy. The cell cycles, apoptosis, and proliferation of the nm23-H1 transfactant were also detected by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT assay) and flow cytometry (FCM). The results showed that the hTERT-promoter dramatically drives nm23-H1 gene expression, and induces inhibition of cell growth and migration in L9981-luc cells and MRC-5 cells in vitro. nm23-H1 also significantly inhibited the tumorigenesis and distant metastasis of L9981-luc cell in vivo. Moreover, no obvious side effect was detected in normal mouse tissues after intratumoral injection of the vector. The treatment of the nm23-H1 gene driven by hTERT\n\nExcitotoxic and Radiation Stress Increase TERT Levels in the Mitochondria and Cytosol of Cerebellar Purkinje Neurons.\n\nPubMed\n\nEitan, Erez; Braverman, Carmel; Tichon, Ailone; Gitler, Daniel; Hutchison, Emmette R; Mattson, Mark P; Priel, Esther\n\n2016-08-01\n\nTelomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is the catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that elongates telomeres at the ends of chromosomes during DNA replication. Recently, it was shown that TERT has additional roles in cell survival, mitochondrial function, DNA repair, and Wnt signaling, all of which are unrelated to telomeres. Here, we demonstrate that TERT is enriched in Purkinje neurons, but not in the granule cells of the adult mouse cerebellum. TERT immunoreactivity in Purkinje neurons is present in the nucleus, mitochondria, and cytoplasm. Furthermore, TERT co-localizes with mitochondrial markers, and immunoblot analysis of protein extracts from isolated mitochondria and synaptosomes confirmed TERT localization in mitochondria. TERT expression in Purkinje neurons increased significantly in response to two stressors: a sub-lethal dose of X-ray radiation and exposure to a high glutamate concentration. While X-ray radiation increased TERT levels in the nucleus, glutamate exposure elevated TERT levels in mitochondria. Our findings suggest that in mature Purkinje neurons, TERT is present both in the nucleus and in mitochondria, where it may participate in adaptive responses of the neurons to excitotoxic and radiation stress.\n\nHuman telomerase reverse transcriptase is a promising target for cancer inhibition in squamous cell carcinomas.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Young-Jin; Kim, Eun-Kyoung; Moon, Sook; Hong, Doo-Pyo; Bae, Jung Yoon; Kim, Jin\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe present study aimed to investigate whether the down-regulation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) may induce an anti-invasive effect in oral squamous cell cancer cell lines. A genetically-engineered squamous carcinoma cell line overexpressing hTERT in immortalized oral keratinocytes transfected by human papilloma virus (HPV)-16 E6/E7 (IHOK) was used. In vivo tumorigenicity was examined using an orthotopic xenograft model of nude mice. For evaluating anti-invasive activity by knockdown of hTERT expression, transwell invasion assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) were employed. The down-regulation of hTERT expression reduced the invasive activity and MMP expression. This result was re-confirmed in the HSC3 oral squamous carcinoma cell line. Targeting hTERT may lead to novel therapeutic approaches. CopyrightÂ© 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G. Delinassios), All rights reserved.\n\nClinicopathological ch"
