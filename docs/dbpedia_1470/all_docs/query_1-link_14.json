RXFP1 activates pleiotropic signaling pathways including the signalosome protein complex that facilitates high-sensitivity signaling; coupling to Gαs, Gαi, and Gαo proteins; interaction with glucocorticoid receptors; and the formation of hetero-oligomers with distinctive pharmacological properties. In addition to relaxin-related ligands, RXFP1 is activated by Clq-tumor necrosis factor-related protein 8 and by small-molecular-weight agonists, such as ML290 [2-isopropoxy-N-(2-(3-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)phenylcarbamoyl)phenyl)benzamide], that act allosterically. RXFP2 activates only the Gαs- and Gαo-coupled pathways. Relaxin-3 is primarily a neuropeptide, and its cognate receptor RXFP3 is a target for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and autism. A variety of peptide agonists, antagonists, biased agonists, and an allosteric modulator target RXFP3. Both RXFP3 and the related RXFP4 couple to Gαi/Gαo proteins. INSL5 has the properties of an incretin; it is secreted from the gut and is orexigenic. The expression of RXFP4 in gut, adipose tissue, and β-islets together with compromised glucose tolerance in INSL5 or RXFP4 knockout mice suggests a metabolic role. This review focuses on the many advances in our understanding of RXFP receptors in the last 5 years, their signal transduction mechanisms, the development of novel compounds that target RXFP1–4, the challenges facing the field, and current prospects for new therapeutics.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nRelaxin family peptides are heterodimeric and closely related structurally to insulin. Four of these peptides, relaxin, insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), relaxin-3, and insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5) are the cognate ligands for the relaxin family peptide receptors RXFP1–4, respectively (Bathgate et al., 2006a). Humans and higher primates have two (RLN1 and RLN2) relaxin genes, whereas other mammals have only one (Rln1). The peptide encoded by the human RLN2 gene and the Rln1 gene from other mammals generates the circulating relaxin peptide originally detected during pregnancy (referred to herein as relaxin). The function of the RLN1 gene in humans and higher primates is unknown (relaxin-1). In humans, the relaxin family peptide genes have a similar structure and all synthesize prepropeptides (Hsu, 2003) that are processed by convertases to produce the mature two-chain peptides; an A-chain linked to a B-chain by two disulfide bonds, and an additional intrachain disulfide in the A-chain.\n\nRelaxin circulates in the blood of all mammals during pregnancy, although the levels and roles vary widely in different species. In humans, relaxin levels are highest in the first trimester and are probably associated with implantation and initiation of the cardiovascular changes that accompany pregnancy. However, relaxin is also produced in many tissues in both male and female mammals as a paracrine or autocrine factor to exert other physiologic roles (Sherwood, 2004; Bathgate et al., 2006a,c, 2013a).\n\nRelaxin-3 is the most recently identified relaxin family peptide; it was named as a “relaxin” peptide because of the presence of the characteristic RxxxRxxI/V relaxin-binding motif in the B-chain but otherwise has relatively low sequence homology to other relaxin peptides. In contrast to other relaxins, the sequence of relaxin-3 is well conserved across species (Wilkinson et al., 2005b; Yegorov et al., 2009). Relaxin-3 is believed to be the ancestral peptide of the family (Wilkinson et al., 2005b) and in mammals is primarily a neuropeptide (Bathgate et al., 2002) involved in stress, memory, and appetite regulation (McGowan et al., 2005; Tanaka et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2007a; Banerjee et al., 2010; Ganella et al., 2013a,b; Ryan et al., 2013a,b; Smith et al., 2014).\n\nINSL3 (formerly Leydig insulin-like peptide) was discovered in the Leydig cells of the testis (Adham et al., 1993) where it is highly expressed in all species that have the INSL3 gene (Bathgate et al., 2006c). INSL3 expression in other tissues occurs at much lower levels. INSL3 has a critical role in testis descent, and INSL3 knockout mice are cryptorchid and infertile (Nef and Parada, 1999; Zimmermann et al., 1999). It plays an important role in gubernaculum development, which is involved in the first stage of testis descent, and also appears to have a role in the maintenance of ovarian function (Spanel-Borowski et al., 2001; Kawamura et al., 2004; Glister et al., 2013).\n\nINSL5 is widely distributed with high expression in the gastrointestinal tract (Conklin et al., 1999) particularly in L cells isolated from mouse colon/rectum but also in ascending, transverse, and descending colon and proximal rectum, with lower levels in the cecum and distal rectum (Grosse et al., 2014). Low levels of Insl5 mRNA were found in the pancreas, thymus, and eye (Grosse et al., 2014). INSL5 knockout mice display dysfunctional glucose homeostasis (Burnicka-Turek et al., 2012). INSL5 activates RXFP4, but not RXFP1 or RXFP2, with high potency and is a weak antagonist at RXFP3 (Liu et al., 2005b).\n\nThus, although relaxin peptides resemble each other closely in structure, each is the cognate ligand for a specific G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) and each possesses a wide variety of physiologic functions. Relaxin has roles in reproduction, cardiovascular system, organ protection, metabolism, and as a neuropeptide in the brain; INSL3, although acting on a similar receptor, has highly specialized roles in reproduction; relaxin-3 is a neuropeptide, and INSL5 acts as an incretin.\n\nA. Receptors for Relaxins and Insulin-Like Peptides\n\n1. Relaxin Family Peptide Receptors 1 and 2—The Leucine-Rich Repeat-Containing Receptors for Relaxin and Insulin-Like Peptide 3.\n\nEarly studies showed an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 220-kDa protein in response to relaxin (Palejwala et al., 1998), suggesting that relaxin receptors, like those that respond to insulin, were tyrosine kinases. However, Insl3 knockout mice (Nef and Parada, 1999; Zimmermann et al., 1999) displayed abnormal testis descent as did mice with disruptions in the GPCR encoded by the GREAT gene (later shown to be the mouse ortholog of human LGR8 or RXFP2) (Overbeek et al., 2001). This led to the deorphanization of LGR7 (RXFP1) and LGR8 (RXFP2) (Hsu et al., 2002), two family A GPCRs.\n\nIn humans, RXFP1 is the cognate receptor for human relaxin; it has the classic seven-transmembrane (TM) spanning regions of a GPCR as well as a large extracellular domain containing 10 leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and a unique N-terminal low-density lipoprotein receptor type A (LDLa) module (Hsu et al., 2002). RXFP1 mRNA and protein is found in ovary, uterus, placenta, mammary gland, prostate, and testis but also in the heart, arteries, kidney, lung, liver, and blood cells as well as in a number of areas of the brain, such as cortex, hippocampus, arcuate nucleus, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), and subfornical organ (SFO) (for details, see Novak et al., 2006, and Bathgate et al., 2013a). Thus, relaxin, in addition to autocrine and paracrine roles, also acts as a neuropeptide. Interaction of relaxin with RXFP1 to trigger cell signaling involves at least three stages: high-affinity binding between the B-chain of relaxin and the RXFP1 LRR region, lower affinity binding to the TM extracellular loops (ECLs), and finally an essential interaction involving the LDLa module (Sudo et al., 2003; Halls et al., 2005b). Although RXFP1 couples to numerous signal transduction pathways, many early studies in reproductive tissues indicated that relaxin caused increases in cAMP levels (Braddon, 1978; Cheah and Sherwood, 1980; Sanborn et al., 1980; Chen et al., 1988), and a constitutively active receptor mutant also generates cAMP (Hsu et al., 2002). The pattern of cAMP production after stimulation of HEK293 cells expressing RXFP1 is complex and involves at least three G proteins (Halls et al., 2006, 2009a,b). RXFP1 also activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), tyrosine kinase(s), gene transcription, and nitric oxide (NO) signaling, and relaxin interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The full implications of the pleiotropic effects of relaxin are still to be elucidated.\n\nRXFP2 is the cognate receptor for INSL3 and is structurally similar to RXFP1 (Hsu et al., 2002; Kumagai et al., 2002). It is primarily expressed in the ovary, testis, and gubernaculum (for details, see Bathgate et al., 2013a). It has a specialized role in the gubernaculum during testicular descent, it is expressed in the testis and ovary affecting gonadal function (Kawamura et al., 2004) and it influences bone metabolism (Ferlin et al., 2009). RXFP2 signaling also involves adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation and cAMP generation, utilizing a subset of the G proteins used by RXFP1. Although in vitro cell systems that are often used to study RXFP2 show increases in cAMP levels, in endogenously expressing systems both increases and decreases in cAMP may be seen. Thus, in gubernacular cells (Kumagai et al., 2002) or osteoblasts (Ferlin et al., 2009), activation of RXFP2 causes increased cAMP, but in male germ cells and oocytes, decreased cAMP is observed (Kawamura et al., 2004), perhaps reflecting expression patterns of signaling proteins in different cells (Halls et al., 2009a). Although the relaxins of some species activate RXFP2 in vitro (Hsu et al., 2002; Kumagai et al., 2002; Scott et al., 2005a; Bathgate et al., 2006b), there is no evidence that relaxin activates RXFP2 in vivo.\n\nThus, RXFP1 and RXFP2 are structurally similar receptors that use some common signaling mechanisms. However, current evidence suggests that the relaxin/RXFP1 system has a much wider range of distribution and functions than the INSL3/RXFP2 system.\n\n2. Relaxin Family Peptide Receptors 3 and 4—Receptors for Relaxin-3 and Insulin-Like Peptide 5 That Resemble G Protein–Coupled Receptors Activated by Small Peptides Like Somatostatin or Angiotensin.\n\nRXFP3 and RXFP4 are the targets for relaxin-3 and INSL5, respectively (Liu et al., 2003a,b). They are distinctly different in structure from RXFP1 and RXFP2 and instead resemble the class A small peptide receptors. RXFP3 was originally named SALPR or somatostatin and angiotensin-like receptor (Matsumoto et al., 2000), whereas RXFP4 was thought to be a bradykinin receptor (Boels and Schaller, 2003) before pairing with their cognate ligands relaxin-3 (Liu et al., 2003b) and INSL5 (Liu et al., 2005b). The receptor expression profiles suggest that RXFP3 is a neuropeptide receptor and RXFP4 is a gut hormone receptor (Bathgate et al., 2013a; Grosse et al., 2014). RXFP3 couples to Gαi/o to inhibit AC (Liu et al., 2003b; van der Westhuizen et al., 2007) and also causes ERK1/2 phosphorylation (van der Westhuizen et al., 2007). Based on binding and signaling studies, relaxin can also bind to a subtly different region on RXFP3 to activate a subset of the pathways activated by relaxin-3 (van der Westhuizen et al., 2010; Kocan et al., 2014). Relatively little is known about RXFP4 signaling, but like RXFP3 it couples to inhibitory G proteins.\n\nRXFP3 and RXFP4 are closely related receptors with structurally similar cognate ligands. However, RXFP3 and relaxin-3 are predominantly involved in central nervous system neurotransmission, whereas INSL5 is an incretin that targets RXFP4 located in the gastrointestinal tract and tissues controlling metabolism.\n\nB. Structural Features of Relaxin Family Peptide Receptors\n\nThe relaxin family peptide receptors are four highly conserved family A GPCRs that can be considered as two distinct pairs based on their architecture and signaling properties. Genes encoding RXFP1 and RXFP2 have introns giving rise to a large number of splice variants with functions that are mostly yet to be established (Muda et al., 2005; Kern et al., 2008), whereas genes encoding RXFP3 and RXFP4 are intronless. RXFP1 and RXFP2 have a large extracellular N terminus with an LRR domain containing a high-affinity ligand binding site complemented by a low-affinity binding interaction within ECL2 and uniquely, an N-terminal LDLa module that is essential for signaling, and a role in trafficking ( ). RXFP1 and RXFP2 show similarities in ligand binding and signaling, but only RXFP1 has a C terminus that contains motifs that induce the formation of protein signaling complexes termed signalosomes (see section III.A.3) (Halls and Cooper, 2010; Halls, 2012) ( ). The third intracellular loop (ICL3) is likely essential for G protein coupling in all RXFP receptors. Both RXFP1 and RXFP2 couple to Gαs and to inhibitory GαoB, which modulates the effect of Gαs coupling, but only RXFP1 is able to couple to Gαi3 to produce a delayed surge in cAMP accumulation that occurs in many but not all cell types (Halls et al., 2009a). In contrast, RXFP3 and RXFP4 have a very small N-terminal domain and couple solely to Gαi and Gαo proteins. For all receptors, the pattern of G protein coupling is dependent on the cell type in which the receptor is expressed.\n\n1. Functional Domains of Relaxin Family Peptide Receptors 1 and 2.\n\nThe similarity between RXFP1 and RXFP2 has helped the identification of the functional domains of the two receptors. Initial work used chimeric receptors and relaxin-3, because it is selective for RXFP1 over RXFP2, and revealed that the peptide interacts with both the LRR domain and ECL2 of the TM domain of RXFP1 to produce the full binding and cAMP signaling profile (Sudo et al., 2003) ( ). This mechanism was later shown to be a feature of both receptors (Halls et al., 2005b). Support for two binding sites also came from functional assays, with high-affinity LRR binding producing cAMP accumulation more effectively than the lower affinity ECL site (Halls et al., 2005b). In addition to the LRR region, the N-terminal LDLa module is essential for signaling ( ) but has no role in ligand binding (Scott et al., 2006; Hopkins et al., 2007; Kern et al., 2007). The LDLa module likely interacts with other receptor domains (potentially the ECLs and TM domains) in a manner analogous to a tethered ligand ( ).\n\na. Low-density lipoprotein receptor type a module.\n\nA unique feature of RXFP1 and RXFP2 is the LDLa module, originally defined by the structure of the LDL receptor (Yamamoto et al., 1984; Daly et al., 1995) but now recognized in a number of other proteins including the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (Gafvels et al., 1993), the LDL receptor-related protein (Herz et al., 1988), renal glycoprotein gp330 (Lundgren et al., 1994; Hjalm et al., 1996), the C9 component of complement (DiScipio et al., 1984; Stanley et al., 1985), the Tva receptor for Rous sarcoma virus (Bates et al., 1993), and retina- and brain-specific neuropilin and tolloid-like protein 1 transmembrane protein (Stohr et al., 2002). RXFP1 and RXFP2 are the only known human GPCRs to contain this module (Bathgate et al., 2006a). The NMR solution structure of the RXFP1 LDLa module has been solved and reveals a typical fold generated by six essential cysteine residues and the incorporation of a calcium ion by a largely conserved motif of acidic residues (Hopkins et al., 2007). The role of the LDLa module was first discovered during characterization of a splice variant of RXFP2 that is missing the LDLa module. This receptor and a similar RXFP1 mutant were expressed at the cell surface and bound their native ligands normally but were not able to signal through cAMP (Scott et al., 2006). More recent studies used a panel of GPCR-relevant signaling reporter genes to demonstrate that the RXFP1 receptor lacking the LDLa module does not signal through any pathway tested (Kong et al., 2013). Importantly, a soluble recombinant form of the RXFP1 LDLa module acts as an RXFP1 antagonist when introduced into cells expressing RXFP1 (Scott et al., 2005c, 2006). These data suggest that the LDLa module may act as an RXFP1 tethered ligand and its actions can be blocked by the addition of recombinant LDLa. Further mutagenesis studies have provided evidence of a specific LDLa-RXFP1 interaction that drives receptor activation. Mutation of residues involved in the folding of the LDLa module produce mutants that are unable to signal but maintain intact ligand binding profiles (Scott et al., 2006; Hopkins et al., 2007; Kern et al., 2007) ( ). Specifically, mutation of cysteines (C47A and C53A) involved in folding or of D58E involved in calcium-binding produces RXFP1 receptors that are unable to increase cAMP accumulation in response to relaxin (Kern et al., 2007). Other mutations that affect calcium ligation and hence folding (corresponding to C27S and C40S within the full-length RXFP1 sequence) also abolish signaling (Hopkins et al., 2007) ( ). Similar studies at human RXFP2 with mutations of the calcium ligating residue D70Y or conserved cysteine C71Y also resulted in a loss of signaling, again highlighting the common mechanism of activation of the two receptors (Bogatcheva et al., 2007).\n\nFurther evidence for a specific interaction between the LDLa module and RXFP1 that drives receptor activation comes from studies on chimeric and mutant RXFP1 receptors (Hopkins et al., 2007; Kong et al., 2013). A chimera where the RXFP1 LDLa module is swapped for a homologous LDLa module from the second ligand-binding domain of the LDL receptor produces a receptor (LB2-RXFP1) that is unable to signal in response to relaxin but binds ligand normally (Hopkins et al., 2007). Mutagenesis of specific conserved residues in the RXFP1 LDLa module highlighted potential roles for L29 and Y31 in receptor activation (Hopkins et al., 2007). Further studies have used the signaling-deficient LB2-RXFP1 receptor to define the potential “signaling surface” of the LDLa module. Within the signaling-deficient LB2-RXFP1, gain of function mutations, loss of function mutations, and judicious amino acid substitutions were able to confirm the key role of L29 and Y31 and to additionally identify K39 as important residues in the RXFP1 LDLa module that are involved in the hydrophobic interactions that drive the active receptor conformation (Kong et al., 2013) ( ). Studies using chimeric RXFP1 and RXFP2 receptors with their LDLa modules swapped C-terminally to the final cysteine residue of the module demonstrate that RXFP2 likely uses a similar mechanism to drive receptor activation. Importantly the chimeric receptors were still able to bind ligand normally and were also able to signal, albeit with altered activity compared with wild-type receptors (Bruell et al., 2013). Furthermore, when the TM domains of the RXFP1 chimera with an RXFP2 LDLa (RXFP211) were swapped to match the LDLa module (RXFP212) the activity of the receptor approached wild type, suggesting a specific interaction between the LDLa module and the receptor TM domains. It also highlights that the RXFP1 and RXFP2 LDLa modules function by similar but distinct mechanisms.\n\nThe LDLa module may also be involved in receptor maturation and translocation to the cell surface. When expressed recombinantly in HEK293 cells, a large proportion of wild-type RXFP1 receptors exist in an immature form containing high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharides within the endoplasmic reticulum (Kern et al., 2007). In the case of other glycoprotein hormone receptors, such as the leutenizing hormone receptor (Ascoli et al., 2002; Tao et al., 2004; Pietila et al., 2005) and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (Quintana et al., 1993; Davis et al., 1995), this has been suggested to be a mechanism controlling cell surface expression. In the same study it was demonstrated that an RXFP1 mutant lacking the LDLa module was expressed as the mature form only, as was a chimeric RXFP1 receptor containing the LDLa module of RXFP2 (Kern et al., 2007). In addition, mutation of a conserved glycosylation site within the LDLa module results in a receptor with a reduced ability to generate cAMP, attributed to a decrease in cell surface expression (Kern et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2008). However, similar studies on RXFP1 mutants with a disruption of the LDLa glycosylation site show only a minor (Yan et al., 2008) or no effect (Kong et al., 2013) on signaling and cell surface expression. Additionally, studies using LDLa-less RXFP1 and RXFP2 (Scott et al., 2006), LB2-RXFP1 mutants, RXFP1 LDLa loss of function mutants (Kong et al., 2013), or misfolded RXFP1 LDLa mutants (Hopkins et al., 2007) demonstrated no effect on cell surface expression. In RXFP2, mutations of amino acid residues that form the disulfide bond or coordinate calcium binding in the LDLa module (C70Y and D71Y) did reduce cell-surface expression (Bogatcheva et al., 2007).\n\nThe LDLa module clearly plays an important and specific role in protein maturation, cell surface expression, and in the activation of both RXFP1 and RXFP2.\n\nb. Leucine-rich repeat region.\n\nGlycosylation, a post-translational modification common to many GPCRs, is important for receptor delivery to the cell surface, ligand binding, and signal transduction. In addition to sites within the LDLa module, the LRR region is also glycosylated at a number of residues (N105, N250, N303, and N346), all of which are important for the translocation of receptors to the cell surface and full signaling efficacy but not ligand binding (Yan et al., 2008). The glycosylation status of RXFP2 has yet to be studied in detail.\n\nIn addition to a role in cell surface delivery, the LRR region is essential for ligand binding and signal transduction. Similar to other members of the LGR family, the primary high-affinity ligand binding site for relaxin and INSL3 is in the LRR region of RXFP1 and RXFP2 (Sudo et al., 2003; Halls et al., 2005b). Studies based on peptide mutagenesis and radioligand binding for both relaxin and INSL3 (outlined in sections II.A.1 and II.B.1) highlight that B-chain residues of the peptides contribute most to the binding affinity. Subsequently, two independent studies used homology modeling of the LRRs and mutagenesis to define the relaxin and INSL3 binding sites in RXFP1 and RXFP2, respectively. The RXFP1 LRRs were modeled based on the crystal structure of the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (a protein with LRRs) together with in silico peptide docking and targeted receptor mutagenesis. Relaxin used the well characterized RxxxRxxI binding motif within the peptide B-chain at a 45° angle across five of the parallel LRRs (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 2005b). Hence the relaxin B-chain residues R13 and R17 were predicted to interact with acidic groups within the concave face of the LRRs (E277 and D279 in LRR8 and D231 and E233 in LRR6) (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 2005b) ( ). The B-chain I20 was predicted to form a hydrophobic interaction with W180 and I182 within LRR4 and L204 and V206 within LRR5 (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 2005b) ( ).\n\nThe interaction of INSL3 with RXFP2 uses different residues in the B-chain as determined from peptide studies (see section II.B.1). Modeling of the INSL3 interaction with the RXFP2 LRRs used the NMR solution structure of INSL3 (Rosengren et al., 2006b) and a molecular model of the RXFP2 LRR based upon the crystal structure of the Nogo receptor (which shares higher amino acid sequence homology than the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor; Scott et al., 2007). With the use of a combination of peptide and LRR mutants in conjunction with in silico docking of the INSL3 B-chain to the LRR of RXFP2, seven residues within RXFP2 that potentially make contact with INSL3 were defined. The B-chain residue R16 was predicted to interact with RXFP2 D227, H12 with RXFP2 W177, V19 with RXFP2 I179, R20 with RXFP2 E229 and D181, and W27 with RXFP2 F131 and Q133 (Scott et al., 2007). Interestingly, although five of the RXFP2 residues that potentially interact with INSL3 are also found in RXFP1, the affinity of INSL3 for RXFP1 is very low (Sudo et al., 2003; Halls et al., 2005b). Another study that investigated this apparent contradiction used the RXFP1 extracellular domain construct linked to a single CD8 TM domain, termed 7BP (Hsu et al., 2002). This construct has a high affinity for INSL3 (Halls et al., 2005b) and was used as a template to further explore the interaction of INSL3 and the RXFP1 LRRs (Scott et al., 2012). Only four amino acid changes were necessary to obtain the equivalent RXFP2 affinity for INSL3 in the RXFP1 LRRs, but when these mutations were inserted into full-length RXFP1 there was only a modest gain of function for INSL3. This, in conjunction with previous studies (see section I.B.1.c), confirmed an important role for the TM domains in modulating ligand binding. Molecular modeling studies demonstrated that relaxin and INSL3 have distinct orientations of binding to the LRRs. Taken together the results suggest that there are critical differences both in the extracellular domain binding and the coordination of this binding with the TM binding site between RXFP1 and RXFP2 (Scott et al., 2012). Relaxin clearly binds to RXFP2 in a different manner from RXFP1 and also in a different manner from INSL3 binding to RXFP2.\n\nc. Transmembrane domains and dimerization.\n\nThe information above highlights the essential coordination of the LRR binding site with the binding site in the TM domains. As mentioned earlier, studies using chimeric receptors and the selectivity of relaxin-3 for RXFP1 versus RXFP2 suggest that this additional binding site is in ECL2 (Sudo et al., 2003) ( ). The presence of this additional binding site within the TM was confirmed using the same chimeric receptors together with relaxin peptides that have selectivity for RXFP1 or RXFP2 (rat relaxin, RXFP1 > RXFP2; INSL3, RXFP2 > RXFP1) (Halls et al., 2005b). Modeling studies suggest that A-chain residues in relaxin and INSL3 interact with this potential binding site (Hartley et al., 2009), but this has yet to be fully characterized. The current model of activation of RXFP1 and RXFP2 suggests that ligand binding to the LRRs and TM ECLs directs the LDLa to interact with the TM domain of a receptor homodimer partner to drive receptor activation (Kong et al., 2010; Bruell et al., 2013). However this model still requires experimental verification using site-directed mutagenesis or other methods that prevent dimer formation.\n\nAs with many other class A GPCRs, RXFP1 and RXFP2 form homo- and heterodimers (Kern et al., 2008; Svendsen et al., 2008a,b). Dimerization occurs in the absence of, and is independent, of ligand occupation of the receptor (Svendsen et al., 2008a,b). Heterodimers also form between the haloreceptor and a number of splice variants and are present at all stages of receptor translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (Kern et al., 2008). Dimerization can also occur with a TM-only domain receptor (Svendsen et al., 2008a,b), highlighting that the TM domains likely drive dimerization as with other GPCRs. The authors suggested that the receptor ecotodomains could be required for stabilization of the dimer because of the lower dimerization efficiency observed for the TM-only receptors. However, a relatively poor expression of the TM-only receptors could also explain these results (R. A. D. Bathgate, unpublished data).\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that dimerization is associated with negative cooperativity (Svendsen et al., 2008a,b), whereby the affinity of unoccupied receptor binding sites progressively decreases as receptor occupancy increases. Two consequences of this are an increase in the functional concentration range of the ligand and a decrease in ligand residence time corresponding to an increase in free ligand concentration, potentially allowing selective activation of different signaling pathways (Shymko et al., 1997). This may provide one explanation for the observation that in many experimental and clinical situations the concentration-response curves for relaxin acting at RXFP1 are bell shaped (also see section III.A.4).\n\nd. Intracellular receptor domains.\n\nThere is evidence that ICL3 and the C-terminal tail have important roles in signaling. ICL3 has an important role in coupling RXFP1 to Gαs and is therefore essential for activation of AC and cAMP signaling ( ). Peptide fragments based on the N-terminal region of ICL3 [residues 615–629, and 619–629-Lys(Palm)] increased AC activity (Shpakov et al., 2007). These peptides functionally \"antagonized\" the cAMP response to relaxin activation of RXFP1 endogenously expressed in rat striatum and rat cardiac muscle (Shpakov et al., 2007). A synthetic peptide based on the C terminus of Gαs (residues 385–394) inhibited AC activity that was stimulated by relaxin or the ICL3 peptides (Shpakov et al., 2007), suggesting an interaction between Gαs and ICL3. This is a region that in many GPCRs interacts with G proteins (Kjelsberg et al., 1992; Ren et al., 1993; Herrick-Davis et al., 1997; Egan et al., 1998). ICL3 may also direct coupling to GαoB for both RXFP1 and RXFP2, although direct evidence is lacking; however, truncation of the C-terminal tail of either receptor did not affect the Gαs or the GαοB components of the cAMP signaling response, suggesting a common interaction site. Constitutive activation of RXFP1 involving Gαs (and Gβγ) activation of AC2 (Halls and Cooper, 2010) is also likely to depend upon Gαs coupling to ICL3 (see section III.A.3).\n\nThe C-terminal tail of RXFP1 has two clear roles in signaling; it controls cAMP accumulation through the Gαi3 pathway and is essential for signalosome formation (see sections III.A.1 and III.A.3). Only RXFP1 increases cAMP accumulation by coupling to Gαi3 (Halls et al., 2006) and activation of AC5, utilizing a Gβγ-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase C (PKC)ζ pathway. Coupling of RXFP1 to this pathway involves the final 10 amino acids of the C terminus and absolutely requires R752; truncation of the C terminus or substitution of R752 selectively removes coupling to Gαi3 (Halls et al., 2009b) ( ). As yet the precise mechanism by which the terminal 10 residues of RXFP1 direct Gαi3 coupling is unclear. The possibilities include direct Gαi3 coupling (although not observed for any other GPCR), Gαi3 coupling after receptor phosphorylation, or recruitment of scaffolding proteins for colocalization of the receptor with Gαi3.\n\nThe C-terminal tail of RXFP1 also controls a small degree of constitutive activity (Halls and Cooper, 2010), and the receptor constitutively couples to AC2 via an association between helix 8 and A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79). The protein complex facilitates Gαs-and Gβγ-mediated stimulation of AC2 to cause cAMP accumulation in response to subpicomolar concentrations of relaxin. The amount of cAMP generated by this complex is tightly controlled by protein kinase A (PKA)–stimulated phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4D3, which is scaffolded to the receptor C terminus by an association between β-arrestin-2 and S704 of RXFP1 ( ). This protein complex, termed a signalosome, directed and maintained by the RXFP1 C-terminal tail, mediates a cAMP response to low concentrations of peptide and may provide a novel cellular response to low levels of relaxin in some physiologic situations.\n\nThe RXFP1 C-terminal tail also contains a number of potential consensus sequences for phosphorylation and protein–protein interactions and is the region of most variation between RXFP1 and the highly-related RXFP2 (Halls et al., 2007b). As such, it represents an area of functional divergence between the two receptors that may relate to the more varied physiologic roles of relaxin in relation to INSL3.\n\nRXFP1 and RXFP2 therefore have similar structures, binding sites, and signaling mechanisms. Both receptors possess a high-affinity binding site in the LRR region, a lower affinity site in ECL2 of the TM domain, and require an intact LDLa module for signaling. RXFP1 has a more complex C-terminal region that contains residues essential for signaling involving Gαi3 and interactions with signalosomes. Both receptors form homo- and heterodimers, but the functional significance of this is unclear at present.\n\n2. Functional Domains of Relaxin Family Peptide Receptors 3 and 4.\n\nRXFP3 and RXFP4 are classic peptide receptors of the Rhodopsin family of class A GPCRs and possess small N-terminal domains that are markedly different from those described for RXFP1 and RXFP2. Additionally, the relaxin-3 B-chain alone can bind and activate RXFP3, although with lower potency than the two-chain peptide, whereas both chains are required for interaction with RXFP1 (Kuei et al., 2007; Hossain et al., 2008). Thus the mode of binding and activation differs from the relaxin/RXFP1 activation mechanism. Alanine scans show that R8, R12, R16, I15, and F20 in the B-chain central helix are required for human relaxin-3 binding, whereas R26 and W27 are essential for receptor activation (Kuei et al., 2007). The first study to investigate the interaction between relaxin-3 and the RXFP3 receptor used peptide selectivity for RXFP3 and RXFP4: relaxin-3 binds to and activates both RXFP3 and RXFP4, whereas INSL5 only activates RXFP4. Chimeric RXFP3 and RXFP4 receptors were used to identify potential functional roles for the extracellular domains and TM helices (Zhu et al., 2008; Bathgate et al., 2013a). Chimeras with swapped N-terminal domains suggested that the N terminus of RXFP4 is required for INSL5 and possibly relaxin-3 binding. Chimeras of RXFP3 with RXFP4 ECL1 or ECL3 domains demonstrated that these ECLs were not important for INSL5 binding to either receptor (Zhu et al., 2008). However, chimeras with swapped ECL2 domains revealed that ECL2 in RXFP3 and RXFP4 are required for ligand binding and possibly receptor activation. Furthermore, insertion of the N terminus and ECL2 of RXFP4 into RXFP3 produced a chimera with full INSL5 binding, demonstrating that these domains are necessary for INSL5 binding in RXFP4 (Zhu et al., 2008). However, this chimera did not increase GTPγS binding, showing that these domains are not sufficient for receptor activation by INSL5.\n\na. Extracellular regions.\n\nA recent study performed comparative sequence analysis of multiple mammalian RXFP3 sequences, molecular modeling, and mutagenesis to map the relaxin-3 binding site in RXFP3 (Bathgate et al., 2013b). The truncation of the first 33 amino acids of the RXFP3 N terminus demonstrated that none of these residues were involved in relaxin-3 binding ( ). Rather, relaxin-3 used multiple arginine residues across a large peptide surface to interact with RXFP3, leading to a focus on potential glutamic and aspartic acid residues in the ECLs that may form electrostatic interactions with these critical arginine residues. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that E141 and D145 in ECL1 and E244 in ECL2 were essential for relaxin-3 binding ( ). These data were then used to dock the NMR solution structure of relaxin-3 (Rosengren et al., 2006b) into a homology model of RXFP3 based on the CXCR4 crystal structure bound to a peptide antagonist (Wu et al., 2010). The subsequent model describing the relaxin-3/RXFP3 interaction demonstrated that the three acidic residues E141, D145, and E244 likely coordinate binding to the three arginines in relaxin-3. Hence, R12 and R16 on the B-chain helical segment of relaxin-3 interact with RXFP3 residues E244 and D145, respectively. This model allows for the relaxin-3 C-terminal tail that was shown to be flexible in the NMR solution structure to insert into the classic “GPCR binding pocket” within the TM domains where relaxin-3 R26 can potentially form a salt bridge with RXFP3 E141 (Bathgate et al., 2013b). This model is consistent with the data showing that relaxin-3 residues in the core β-helix are involved in RXFP3 binding, whereas the relaxin-3 C-terminal RW residues likely drive activation by interactions in the RXFP3 TM core. A slightly different relaxin-3/RXFP3 interaction model was recently described that is nonetheless still consistent with the activation mode described above (Zhang et al., 2014) ( ).\n\nb. Transmembrane spanning regions.\n\nChimeras were used to investigate the role of the TM spanning regions of RXFP3 and RXFP4. Replacement of TM3 or TM5 of RXFP4 with those of RXFP3 decreased affinity and abolished INSL5 activity (Zhu et al., 2008; Bathgate et al., 2013a), suggesting that these regions are necessary for INSL5 binding and activation. However, the reverse chimera of RXFP3 with TM3 and TM5 from RXFP4 had increased INSL5 binding affinity but did not activate GTPγS binding (Zhu et al., 2008), demonstrating that TM3 and TM5 alone are not sufficient for INSL5 activation of RXFP3. A chimera of RXFP3 with TM2, TM3, TM5, and ECL2 of RXFP4 displayed similar affinity for both relaxin-3 and INSL5 to wild-type RXFP4 (Zhu et al., 2008), suggesting that all regions influence binding. Relaxin-3 activated GTPγS binding at this chimera similarly to wild-type RXFP4, and although INSL5 showed increased potency, it was still slightly lower than at wild-type RXFP4 (Zhu et al., 2008). This suggests that TM2, TM3, TM5, and ECL2 are all involved in ligand binding and activation of RXFP3 and RXFP4.\n\nThe mode of activation of RXFP3 and RXFP4 by their cognate ligands is more conventional than that observed for RXFP1 and RXFP2 and involves an interaction of the ligand with just the receptor N terminus and ECL2.\n\nII. Ligands That Act at Relaxin Family Peptide Receptors\n\nAll of the relaxin family peptides that are the cognate ligands for relaxin family peptide receptors are synthesized and processed in a manner similar to insulin and have a conserved preprohormone structure (signal peptide, B-chain, C-chain, and C-terminal A-chain) that necessitates modification to produce the mature, active peptide. The signal peptide is removed first, followed by the C peptide, to form a mature heterodimeric peptide with two disulfide bonds between the A- and B-chains and an additional intra-A-chain bond. However, cleavage of the C peptide has been directly demonstrated for only some of the peptides.\n\nRelaxin has been isolated and characterized from many species, and all show the two-chain, three disulfide-bonded structure similar to insulin (Bathgate et al., 2006a) ( ). Similar processing has been demonstrated for porcine relaxin-3 (Liu et al., 2003b) but not yet for INSL5. INSL3 has been isolated as both a prohormone form in the goat (Siqin et al., 2013) and boar (Minagawa et al., 2012) and as a processed form in the bovine (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 2002). Importantly, and as for relaxin, both processed and unprocessed forms of INSL3 are bioactive, although relaxin-3 must be processed to be active at RXFP3 (Ganella et al., 2013a). Structural studies on recombinant human relaxin (Eigenbrot et al., 1991), synthetic INSL3 (Rosengren et al., 2006b), human relaxin-3 (Rosengren et al., 2006a), and INSL5 (Haugaard-Jonsson et al., 2008) have determined the three-dimensional structures of the peptides.\n\nThe crystal structure of the human relaxin peptide reveals an overall fold similar to insulin (Eigenbrot et al., 1991) as well as the formation of an asymmetric dimer, albeit in a different orientation. The main differences between relaxin family peptides occur around their termini (Rosengren et al., 2009). NMR studies of human relaxin-3 show similarities to human relaxin and insulin, although relaxin-3 has a more hydrophobic core with a condensed B-chain α-helix, allowing interaction with W27 (Rosengren et al., 2006a). In human relaxin, the B-chain α-helix is one turn longer, forcing the tryptophan to face away from the core of the molecule and making it solvent exposed (Rosengren et al., 2006a). NMR studies suggest that this is similar in INSL5 (Haugaard-Jonsson et al., 2009). In INSL3, the C-terminal orientation is superficially similar to that observed for human relaxin-3, with the C terminus contacting the hydrophobic core (Rosengren et al., 2006a). However, the C termini show disparity in their precise orientation that has direct ramifications for the key role of the C-terminal tryptophan in the activity of these peptides.\n\nA. Ligands That Act at Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 1\n\n1. Relaxin Family Peptide Agonists.\n\nAlthough the relaxin peptides show considerable variation across species, alignment of amino acid sequences showed that in addition to the cysteines necessary for the two-chain structure there was a conserved RxxxRxxI/V motif in the B-chain. Examination of the X-ray crystal structure of relaxin indicates that the arginines are outward facing and located on the first and second loop of the α-helix (Eigenbrot et al., 1991) where together with an isoleucine or valine residue they form the receptor binding site for relaxin (Schwabe and Bullesbach, 1994; Tan et al., 2002). Replacement of the arginine, isoleucine, or valine residues in this motif (RxxxRxxI/V) markedly reduces or abolishes activity (Schwabe and Bullesbach, 1994; Tan et al., 2002). The relaxin A-chain shows greater sequence variation than the B-chain across species (Sherwood, 1994). Other than the conserved cysteine residues, G14 is also highly conserved and necessary for chain flexibility and structure (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 1994). Truncation of the A-chain of human relaxin produces peptides that progressively lose the ability to bind to and activate RXFP1 and RXFP2 (Hossain et al., 2008) ( ). Studies using targeted point mutations within the A-chain show an influence of the A-chain on receptor binding and activation. T16A and K17A mutations had little effect on the cAMP response to RXFP1 activation but enhanced cAMP responses after activation of RXFP2; conversely, the R22A and F23A mutations markedly reduced the activity of human relaxin at RXFP2 without reducing binding or activity at RXFP1 (Park et al., 2008); mutations S19A and L20A are also known to reduce peptide binding and activity at RXFP1 (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 1994) ( ). More recent detailed studies of the key A-chain residues (Chan et al., 2012) show that no single amino acid drives the interactions between RXFP1 and human relaxin, although Y3, L20, and F23 all have some role. These studies also identify differences in the mechanisms by which relaxin binds to and activates RXFP1 compared with RXFP2, leading to the development of a potent and selective peptide agonist for RXFP1, H2:A(4–24) (F23A) that has similar potency and biologic activity to human relaxin but no significant activity at RXFP2 (Chan et al., 2012) ( ). The contention that human relaxin binds to RXFP1 and RXFP2 by distinct mechanisms is further supported by the species-specific nature of these structure activity relationships: neither mouse nor rat relaxin is able to bind to or activate RXFP2 (Scott et al., 2005b), and although human relaxin-3 binds with good affinity to RXFP1, it has only a poor affinity for RXFP2 (Bathgate et al., 2006b). The importance of the peptide A-chain is also emphasized by the structure activity relationships displayed by relaxin-3. Replacement of the relaxin-3 A-chain with that of INSL5 produces a chimeric peptide (R3/I5) that no longer binds to or activates RXFP1 but has unchanged activity at RXFP3 (Liu et al., 2005a) ( ). A similar profile is attained after truncation of the relaxin-3 A-chain (Hossain et al., 2008).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nLigandBinding Affinity pKi, pKDcAMP pEC50pERK1/2 pEC50ReferenceHuman relaxin-1AG8.849.1Bathgate et al.

(2013)\n\nExamination of the role of the B-chain in activation of RXFP1 demonstrates that it is possible to truncate both ends while still retaining binding and functional activity (Hossain et al., 2011). Peptides with a reduced B-chain [H2:(B7–24)] or reduced A- and B-chains [H2:(A4–24) (B7–24)] show some reduction in binding activity and ability to generate cAMP but have similar antifibrotic activity to human relaxin and less activity at RXFP2 (Hossain et al., 2011) ( ).\n\n2. C1q-Tumor Necrosis Factor–Related Protein 8: An Additional Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 1 Ligand?\n\nShort linear peptides derived from a naturally occurring protein containing a collagen-like repeat have been reported to act at RXFP1 (Shemesh et al., 2009). Although the effects produced by the peptides CGEN-25009 and CGEN-25010 in several systems were extremely variable and the effects of human relaxin in these systems unusual (Shemesh et al., 2008, 2009), there is some evidence to suggest relaxin-like activity of these peptides in THP-1 cells and in a fibrosis model (Pini et al., 2010). In the latter study, CGEN-25009 and human relaxin increased cAMP, cGMP, and nitrite and decreased collagen deposition and increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity in human dermal fibroblasts (Pini et al., 2010). More recent studies with these peptides and the precursor protein C1q-tumor necrosis factor–related protein 8 (CTRP8) demonstrated activation of RXFP1 (Glogowska et al., 2013) with cAMP production and a PI3K-mediated promigratory phenotype in glioblastoma cell lines and primary cells. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated a direct interaction between human CTRP8 and RXFP1. Although these studies suggest that CTRP8 or peptide fragments are able to activate RXFP1, it remains to be seen whether they are native ligands and/or whether activation of RXFP1 by CTRP8 occurs specifically in glioblastomas.\n\n3. Small-Molecular-Weight Agonists.\n\nThe recent success of the phase III clinical trial of relaxin for acute heart failure (see below) encouraged a screening campaign to identify small molecule agonists of RXFP1. By using HEK293 cells stably expressing RXFP1, 365,677 compounds were screened for their ability to cause cAMP accumulation. Both of the hits obtained contained a 2-acetamido-N-phenylbenzamide structure that was used as a basis for medicinal chemistry optimization (Chen et al., 2013; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK153218/). Of these compounds, a number showed reasonable potency for cAMP generation in both HEK293-RXFP1 and THP-1 cells (that endogenously express RXFP1) and had good specificity for RXFP1 versus RXFP2 (Xiao et al., 2013) ( ). Several of the compounds increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression in THP-1 cells with similar efficacy to relaxin, and compound 8 [ML290; 2-isopropoxy-N-(2-(3-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)phenylcarbamoyl)phenyl)benzamide] was also shown to increase cellular impedance in a label-free system albeit with at least 500-fold lower potency than relaxin (Xiao et al., 2013). In addition, comparison of the binding mode of action of ML290 with that of relaxin suggests that the small-molecule agonist acts as an allosteric agonist at RXFP1 (Xiao et al., 2013; Christopoulos et al., 2014). Relaxin binds with high affinity to the LRR region of RXFP1 followed by a lower affinity interaction with ECL2 (Sudo et al., 2003; Halls et al., 2005a,b). This triggers an interaction involving the LDLa module that is essential for signaling (Scott et al., 2006; Kern et al., 2007; Kong et al., 2013). Mutations of the calcium binding asparagine within the LDLa module (D58E), produce a receptor where the cAMP response to relaxin is completely abolished but that to ML290 (compound 8) is unaffected (Xiao et al., 2013). Because, unlike the human receptor, mouse RXFP1 does not respond to ML290, chimeric constructs of human and mouse RXFP1 were used to identify the region of RXFP1 that interacts with ML290. Examination of the chimeras narrowed the region of interest down to ECL3, and two pairs of amino acids divergent between human and mouse RXFP1 were identified. The substitution of the N-terminal IL within mouse ECL3 to the VV of human RXFP1 did not rescue function (Xiao et al., 2013). C-terminal substitution of GT within human RXFP1 to the DS of mouse RXFP1 produced a chimeric human RXFP1 that did not respond to ML290. The converse substitution of DS to GT in mouse RXFP1 created a partially active receptor. The mouse receptor with a double substitution of the mouse to the human residues, IL to VV and DS to GT, produced a fully active mouse RXFP1 that responded to ML290 in a similar fashion to the human receptor (Xiao et al., 2013). The 2-acetamido-N-phenylbenzamide derivatives represent the first synthetic small-molecule agonists at RXFP1. They show good potency, selectivity, and a number of relaxin-like functions in cell-based assays. They appear to behave as allosteric agonists acting at the ECL3 loop of RXFP1 ( ). It remains to be demonstrated whether the profile of activity of ML290 and similar compounds matches that of relaxin in a variety of cellular and animal disease models.\n\n4. Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 1 Antagonists.\n\nIn contrast to the other members of the RXFP receptor family there have been few examples of peptides with antagonist properties at RXFP1. Peptide AT-001 (Neschadim et al., 2014) contains mutations of the B-chain residues R13 and R17 [that are essential for relaxin-like activity (Büllesbach et al., 1992)] to K13 and K17 (B-R13/17K relaxin). Initially, antagonism was demonstrated by lentiviral expression of the B-R13/17K relaxin, which decreased prostate cancer xenograft growth (Silvertown et al., 2007). In addition, medium from cells infected with the lentivirus showed human relaxin immunoreactivity and antagonized cAMP production from THP-1 cells in response to relaxin (Silvertown et al., 2007). However, a subsequent synthesis of the B-R13/17K peptide showed that although it competed for relaxin binding, the peptide was actually a partial agonist for cAMP production in cells overexpressing RXFP1 (Hossain et al., 2010; Neschadim et al., 2014) ( ). In cells expressing RXFP1 at lower (more physiologic) levels, B-R13/17K relaxin displayed functional antagonism, inhibited MCF-7 cell invasion, and prevented the inhibitory effect of relaxin on renal myofibroblast differentiation (Hossain et al., 2010). In androgen-independent PC3 prostate cancer xenografts, B-R13/17K suppresses growth and has antiangiogenic effects and synergizes with the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel (Neschadim et al., 2014). The activity of B-R13/17K at other RXFP receptors has not been examined.\n\nThe detailed understanding of the mode of interaction of peptide ligands at RXFP1 has led to the development of potent and selective agonists and also partial agonists that have antagonist properties in systems with low levels of receptor expression. An exciting recent development is the small molecular weight allosteric agonists, typified by ML290, that are currently being characterized in terms of their ability to activate the full repertoire of RXFP1 signaling.\n\nB. Ligands That Act at Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 2\n\n1. Relaxin Family Peptide Agonists.\n\nINSL3 is the cognate ligand for RXFP2 that interacts with RXFP1 only at extremely high concentrations (Kumagai et al., 2002; Halls et al., 2005b), suggesting that it does not bind to or activate RXFP1 in a physiologic setting. In contrast, the cognate ligand for RXFP1, human relaxin, potently activates RXFP2, although the mode of interaction of both human relaxin and INSL3 with RXFP2 shows significant differences compared with the interaction of human relaxin with RXFP1 (see section II.B.1) ( ). Mutated INSL3 peptides demonstrate the utilization of distinct amino acids in the B-chain to bind to and activate RXFP2. W27 within INSL3 is critical for RXFP2 binding and activation (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 2004, 2005a), although other single amino acid replacements with either alanine or valine suggest that there are additional influences within the B-chain. Although individual substitutions only slightly reduce INSL3 binding to RXFP2, the combined mutation of H12A, R16A, V19A, R20A, and W27A abolishes binding (Rosengren et al., 2006b).\n\nTABLE 2\n\nLigandBinding Affinity pKi, pKDcAMP pEC50ReferenceRelaxinAG8.489.13Hossain et al.

(2011)ML290AAN.A.Xiao et al. (2013)\n\nTruncation of the A-chain of human relaxin results in a peptide that progressively loses the ability to bind to and activate both RXFP1 and RXFP2 (Hossain et al., 2008), possibly because of a loss of structure in the B-chain. However, truncation of the A-chain of INSL3 completely abolishes activation with no effect on binding (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 2005a) ( ). Additionally, targeted point mutations within the A-chain selectively alter the receptor binding and activation profile: the T16A and K17A mutations do not markedly alter cAMP responses to RXFP1 activation but enhance cAMP responses at RXFP2; the R22A and F23A mutations reduce human relaxin activity at RXFP2 but not at RXFP1 (Park et al., 2008). The double S19A and L20A mutations reduce peptide binding and activity at RXFP1, again suggesting a role of the A-chain in receptor binding and activation (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 1994) ( ). Differences in the mechanism of binding and activation between RXFP1 and RXFP2 are further supported by the species-specific nature of these structure activity relationships; thus neither mouse nor rat relaxin can bind to or activate human, rat, or mouse RXFP2 (Scott et al., 2005b), and human relaxin-3 has only a poor affinity for RXFP2 (Bathgate et al., 2006b). All of these studies highlight the importance of both the A- and B-chains for INSL3 activation of RXFP2 and show that the mechanism of action is different from the relaxin-RXFP1 interaction (Hossain et al., 2008).\n\n2. Relaxin Family Peptide Antagonists.\n\nIn contrast to RXFP1, there are numerous peptide antagonists of RXFP2 due to the difference in the mode of activation of RXFP2 by INSL3. Thus deletion of 10 residues from the N terminus of the INSL3 A-chain produces a peptide that still binds to RXFP2 but no longer increases cAMP accumulation (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 2005a). This truncated peptide is a specific competitive inhibitor of INSL3 at RXFP2 (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 2005a) ( ). In addition, deletion of eight N-terminal residues of the B-chain produces an INSL3 peptide that retains binding affinity but loses agonist activity (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 2005a). Substitution of eight A- or B-chain residues with alanine does not affect receptor signaling (Bullesbach and Schwabe, 2005a). Disruption of the intra-A-chain disulfide bond (C10S/C15S; or C10del/C15del) produces peptides that retain RXFP2 binding but do not activate cAMP signaling (Zhang et al., 2010) ( ). The INSL3 B-chain alone is also a RXFP2 antagonist, although it only has low affinity for the receptor (Del Borgo et al., 2006; Shabanpoor et al., 2007). Modifications of the single-chain structure result in modest gains in affinity, but larger gains are obtained by linking two B-chains using the native cysteine residues (Shabanpoor et al., 2010) ( ). Modifications of this B-chain dimer resulted in antagonists with affinities only slightly lower than INSL3 (Shabanpoor et al., 2011).\n\nDespite the similarity between RXFP1 and RXFP2 and their cognate ligands relaxin and INSL3, the precise mode of peptide activation of the receptors is quite different. This has facilitated the successful development of a number of antagonists for RXFP2.\n\nC. Ligands That Act at Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 3\n\n1. Relaxin Family Peptide Agonists.\n\nHuman relaxin-3 has a tertiary structure, determined by solution NMR spectroscopy, that is similar to insulin and other relaxin family peptides (Rosengren et al., 2006a). However, unlike the interaction of human relaxin with RXFP1 that requires both A- and B-chains for binding and activation, the human relaxin-3 B-chain alone can bind to and activate both RXFP3 and RXFP4 (Liu et al., 2003b). Replacement of the human relaxin-3 A-chain with the INSL5 A-chain (R3/I5) does not influence RXFP3 binding or activation but markedly reduces the ability of the peptide to bind to and activate RXFP1 (Liu et al., 2005a) ( ). Similarly, truncation of the human relaxin-3 A-chain reduces binding to and activation of RXFP1 but retains full activity at RXFP3 (Hossain et al., 2008). The additional deletion of the A-chain disulfide bond results in the complete loss of RXFP1 binding and activation with little effect on RXFP3 binding and activation (Shabanpoor et al., 2012). Further development of this analog with a B23–27 deletion and addition of an arginine at B23 led to a high-affinity, RXFP3-selective, competitive antagonist (analog 3) ( ).\n\nTABLE 3\n\nLigandBinding Affinity pKi, pKDcAMP pEC50GTPγS pEC50pERK 1/2 pEC50P38 MAPK pEC50ReferenceRelaxin-3AG8.488.26Hossain et al.

(2003b)Liu et al. (2005a)\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis of B-chain residues reveals that R8, R16, I5, and F20 are important for human relaxin-3 binding to RXFP3 and RXFP4 (Kuei et al., 2007), with R12 also required for binding to RXFP3 but not RXFP4 (Kuei et al., 2007). R26 and W27 toward the C terminus of the B-chain are required for activation of RXFP3 (Kuei et al., 2007). Truncation of the C terminus of the B-chain to C22 and the serendipitous addition of an additional arginine residue at the N terminus in the recombinant production system, when combined with the A-chain of INSL5, led to the discovery of a high-affinity RXFP3-selective antagonist R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 (Kuei et al., 2007) (see section II.C.4; ). A single-chain antagonist has since been developed based on the B-chain of R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 with the cysteine residues mutated to serine (H3 B1–22R) (Haugaard-Kedstrom et al., 2011) ( ).\n\n2. Biased Agonists Acting at Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 3.\n\nLigand-directed signaling bias is increasingly common in GPCR pharmacology and describes stabilization of distinct receptor confirmations by ligands, resulting in selective activation of downstream signal transduction pathways (Baker and Hill, 2007; Evans et al., 2010; Kenakin and Miller, 2010). Although the original studies suggested that only relaxin-3 and its B-chain bound to and activated RXFP3, it is now clear that several relaxin peptides interact with RXFP3 to activate distinct signaling profiles through different, although sometimes overlapping pathways ( ). Initial studies showed that human relaxin-3 was selective for RXFP3 in both binding and AC inhibition assays, with no receptor activation by human relaxin or INSL3 (Liu et al., 2003b). However, cross-reactivity with other relaxin peptides was not examined over a wider range of signal transduction pathways, and the sensitivity of inhibitory cAMP assays can be influenced by the degree of activation of AC by forskolin and the time of stimulation (for detailed description see section III.C.2).\n\n3. Allosteric Modulators.\n\nA novel selective allosteric modulator of RXFP3 has been described (Alvarez-Jaimes et al., 2012). 135PAM1 (3-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1-[2-(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]urea) is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) that curiously only displays activity with C-terminal amidated relaxin-3 or R3/I5 (probe selectivity). Binding studies conducted in HEK293-RXFP3 cell membranes showed that 135PAM1 does not compete with [125I]R3/I5(amide) binding at up to 1 μM but at higher concentrations enhances binding consistent with activity as a PAM. The R3/I5(amide) peptide itself competes for [125I]R3/I5(amide) binding in a conventional manner (Alvarez-Jaimes et al., 2012). In HEK293-RXFP3 cells coexpressing Gαqi5, 135PAM1 increased calcium responses to EC20 concentrations of relaxin-3(amide) or R3/I5(amide) but not the free-acid (OH) peptides. Concentration-response curves to the amidated but not the free-acid form of the peptides were shifted in a limiting manner by 135PAM1. Similar specificity of 135PAM1 was also displayed in a reporter gene assay that measured inhibition of CRE activity in cells expressing RXFP3 ( ). This is the only published example to date of a small molecule compound with activity at RXFP3. The discovery of 135PAM1 identifies an allosteric site on RXFP3 that can be modulated by small molecules.\n\n4. Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 3 Antagonists.\n\nThe synthetic peptide R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 that was discovered as a RXFP3 antagonist has been instrumental in defining the physiologic functions of the receptor. Specificity for RXFP3 was initially achieved by synthesizing a chimeric peptide featuring the A-chain of INSL5 in combination with the B-chain of relaxin-3. The RXFP3 agonist properties of this peptide chimera were then markedly reduced by truncation of the relaxin-3 B-chain (Kuei et al., 2007; Hossain et al., 2009). Serendipitously, upon recombinant production of R3(BΔ23–27)/I5 an extra arginine remained at the N terminus due to incomplete peptidase “trimming of the RR from the RRRR furin cleavage domain” to produce the peptide R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5. This peptide binds to RXFP3 and RXFP4 with high affinity and is a potent antagonist at RXFP3 in both rats and in human in vitro systems. Synthetic R3(BΔ23–27)/I5 (lacking R23) has lower affinity at RXFP3 and has weak agonist properties (Hossain et al., 2009), highlighting that the extra R23 creates an additional interaction with RXFP3 ( ). Administration of R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 intracerebroventricularly to rats blocks food intake stimulated by the RXFP3 agonist R3/I5. It recently became apparent that R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 has a complex antagonist profile and blocks some but not all pathways activated by RXFP3. It also has weak biased agonist properties (see section III.C.2). In addition, studies have revealed that the intra-A-chain disulfide bond in relaxin-3 is not important for interaction with RXFP3 but is necessary for the interaction of relaxin-3 with RXFP1. Analogs without this A-chain disulfide bond together with truncation of 10 amino acids from the N terminus of the A-chain remain potent RXFP3 agonists. If in addition, GGSRW is removed from the B-chain and replaced with R, the peptide becomes a high-affinity antagonist with similar biologic activity to R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 (Shabanpoor et al., 2012) ( ).\n\nStudies with R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 suggested that the additional RXFP3 affinity provided by the R23 residue might result in the B-chain only R3(BΔ23–27)R having significant affinity for RXFP3 ( ). This has been proved experimentally and H3 B1–22R is a high-affinity antagonist of RXFP3 that is far easier to produce than the two-chain peptides (Haugaard-Kedstrom et al., 2011). Importantly this peptide is also specific for RXFP3 and has no activity at RXFP4. The peptide was shown to have efficacy in vivo and blocks increases in feeding produced by intracerebroventricular injection of R3/I5 in rats (Haugaard-Kedstrom et al., 2011). It was subsequently used to demonstrate a role for the endogenous relaxin-3 system in addiction in rats (Ryan et al., 2013b) and in motivated food seeking and consumption in mice (Smith et al., 2014).\n\nThe structure-activity relationships for the interaction of relaxin peptides with RXFP3 are now well understood. Unlike RXFP1 and RXFP2, RXFP3 can be activated by peptides comprising only the B-chain, and a number of selective agonists and antagonists have been developed. Both relaxin and some RXFP3 antagonists display biased agonist properties at RXFP3. However, the utility of a small molecule allosteric modulator in vivo is currently limited by probe selectivity.\n\nD. Ligands That Act at Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 4\n\n1. Relaxin Family Peptide Agonists.\n\nINSL5 is the cognate ligand for RXFP4 (Liu et al., 2005b). INSL5 has many of the characteristics of an incretin being secreted from enteroendocrine L cells and regulating insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis (Burnicka-Turek et al., 2012). Synthesis of human INSL5 represents considerable challenges so that some of the characterization of the peptide has been performed with mouse INSL5 that has 71% homology (Belgi et al., 2011). Compared with human INSL5, mouse INSL5 displays an 8-fold increase in affinity in binding assays and a 5-fold greater potency in cAMP inhibition assays, possibly related to the overall greater positive charge associated with the nonconserved residues (Belgi et al., 2011) ( ). In addition, the amidated peptides show a considerable reduction in potency compared with the free acids (Belgi et al., 2011). Although relaxin-3 binds both RXFP3 and RXFP4 with high affinity, INSL5 is actually a weak antagonist at RXFP3 (Zhu et al., 2008) ( ). Furthermore, although the relaxin-3 B-chain alone was sufficient to bind and activate RXFP3, the INSL5 A- and B-chains alone are inactive at RXFP4 (Belgi et al., 2013).\n\nTABLE 4\n\nLigandBinding Affinity pKi, pKDcAMP pEC50GTPγS pEC50ReferencehINSL5AG7.338.51Shabanpoor et al.

Up to seven residues of the N terminus of the B-chain of relaxin-3 can be deleted with little effect on binding or activation of RXFP4 (Kuei et al., 2007; Hossain and Wade, 2010), whereas the α-helical region of the B-chain is important for activity at RXFP4 (Hossain and Wade, 2010). R12 and R16 are important for binding to both RXFP1 and RXFP3, whereas only R16 is important for RXFP4 binding (Kuei et al., 2007). A critical residue for RXFP4 and RXFP3 binding appears to be F20, and mutations of this residue are associated with a marked loss of affinity (Kuei et al., 2007; Hossain and Wade, 2010). In addition, the C terminus of the relaxin-3 B-chain appears to be important for activation of RXFP4, and mutation of these residues blocks agonist activity without influencing affinity (Hossain and Wade, 2010).\n\n2. Modified Peptide Agonists.\n\nThe potential of RXFP4 as a therapeutic target and the difficulty involved in the synthesis of human INSL5 has led to the search for more easily synthesized and selective analogs. Minimized analogs of relaxin-3 display some interesting properties. Removal of the first eight residues of the A-chain of relaxin-3 produces an analog (analog 2) with similar binding affinity and potency to relaxin-3 at RXFP3 and RXFP4 but no activity at RXFP1 (Shabanpoor et al., 2012) ( ). This activity is retained in a peptide where the B-chain is truncated by nine residues (Shabanpoor et al., 2012). These studies indicate that the C terminus of the B-chain and the interchain disulfide bonds are the major structural features required for activity at RXFP4.\n\n3. Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 4 Antagonists.\n\nSeveral of the compounds developed as antagonists of RXFP3 also have antagonist properties at RXFP4. These peptides include the minimized relaxin-3 analog 3 (minimized A-chain and truncated B-chain) that has no agonist activity at RXFP4 but only a slightly reduced binding affinity (Shabanpoor et al., 2012) ( ). Likewise the R3(BΔ23–27)R/I5 RXFP3 antagonist also is a high-affinity antagonist at RXFP4 (Kuei et al., 2007). Interestingly, the single-chain variant of this peptide H3 B1–22R does not bind to RXFP4 (Haugaard-Kedstrom et al., 2011) ( ).\n\nMuch less information is available on RXFP4 compared with the other family members, but this has been accelerating due to the identification of INSL5 as a likely incretin. There is now a good understanding of the mode of interaction of INSL5 with RXFP4 and an increasing range of synthetic peptide agonists and antagonists have been developed.\n\nIII. Signal Transduction Pathways\n\nA. Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 1 Signaling\n\n1. Canonical Signaling Pathways.\n\nRXFP1 displays pleiotropic signaling to a variety of pathways including cAMP accumulation, activation of MAP kinases, tyrosine kinases, and NO as well as pathways associated with connective tissue metabolism ( ). Early studies before receptor identification, showed that treatment with relaxin increased cAMP accumulation in THP-1 cells (Parsell et al., 1996), MCF-7 cells (Bigazzi et al., 1992), the mouse pubic symphysis (Braddon, 1978), uterine strips (Sanborn et al., 1980), uterine longitudinal muscle (Osa et al., 1991) from estrogen-primed rats, and in cultures of human endometrial cells (Fei et al., 1990), human endometrial glandular epithelial cells (Chen et al., 1988), newborn rhesus monkey uterine cells (Kramer et al., 1990), rat myometrial cells (Hsu et al., 1985), and rat anterior pituitary cells (Cronin et al., 1987). The importance of cAMP as a signaling pathway for relaxin was confirmed on RXFP1 deorphanization, because constitutively active mutants of RXFP1 (TM6: D637Y) increased cAMP accumulation in a ligand-independent manner (Hsu et al., 2000, 2002). RXFP1 couples to Gαs to increase cAMP (Hsu et al., 2000, 2002; Halls et al., 2006), an effect that is negatively modulated by coupling to GαoB (Halls et al., 2006) ( ). RXFP1 also couples to Gαi3 to activate a delayed surge of cAMP accumulation via a Gβγ-PI3K-PKCζ pathway that activates AC5 (Nguyen et al., 2003; Nguyen and Dessauer, 2005b; Halls et al., 2006, 2009b). The delayed pathway was initially identified in THP-1 cells that endogenously express RXFP1 where relaxin causes a biphasic increase in cAMP accumulation, with the later phase partially blocked by the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 [2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride] and Wortmannin. This was confirmed when relaxin stimulation of RXFP1 was also shown to increase PI3K activity (Nguyen et al., 2003). PKCζ was proposed as the candidate protein that linked PI3K activation to cAMP formation and is an atypical isoform that is insensitive to diacylglycerol and calcium but activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and other lipids (Ono et al., 1989; Nakanishi et al., 1993; Standaert et al., 2001). Treatment with porcine relaxin causes a concentration-dependent translocation of PKCζ to the cell membrane in MCF-7 (human breast cancer), PHM1-31 (pregnant human myometrial), MMC (mouse mesangial), and THP-1 cells (Nguyen and Dessauer, 2005b), with translocation dependent upon PI3K activation by relaxin but independent of cAMP accumulation. cAMP increases mediated by relaxin were also dependent upon PKCζ expression (Nguyen and Dessauer, 2005b). Although in MCF-7 cells, relaxin stimulation activates PI3K and causes translocation of PKCζ without increasing cAMP accumulation, transfection of AC5, but not AC2 or AC4, into these cells produces a cAMP response to relaxin (Nguyen and Dessauer, 2005a). Thus RXFP1 activates PI3K and causes translocation of PKCζ to the cell membrane, which in turn stimulates AC5 ( ).\n\nThis pathway also occurs in HEK293 cells transiently or stably expressing RXFP1 (Halls et al., 2006, 2009b) and is downstream of Gα and Gβγ subunits, because transfection of cells with Gαi/o mutants that are insensitive to ADP ribosylation by pertussis toxin (PTX) show coupling of RXFP1 to Gαi3 (in addition to Gαs and inhibitory GαoB) as the mediator of the Gβγ-PI3K-PKCζ-AC5 pathway. This also occurs in endogenous settings: in rat left atria, relaxin increases cAMP accumulation that is reduced by PTX pretreatment, which also reduced the inotropic and chronotropic responses to relaxin (Kompa et al., 2002); in the failing human heart there is increased Gαi/o expression (Eschenhagen et al., 1992; Bohm et al., 1994), and the positive inotropic effects of relaxin in humans are preserved in this condition (Dschietzig et al., 2011).\n\nThe final 10 amino acids of the RXFP1 C terminus, particularly R752, are essential for activation of the Gαi3 pathway (Halls et al., 2009b) ( ), as is the presence of lipid-rich membrane domains, suggesting compartmentalization of the RXFP1-stimulated cAMP response (Halls et al., 2009b). GTPγS-immunoprecipitation studies show that Gαi3 is activated immediately after RXFP1 stimulation, suggesting that the delay observed is downstream of the G protein and probably involves the translocation of PKCζ (Halls et al., 2009b). In HEK293 cells, only activation of Gαs- and GαoB-dependent cAMP signaling pathways increases CRE-mediated gene transcription, whereas Gαi3-mediated signaling appears to selectively regulate nuclear factor-κB (NFκB)–dependent gene transcription (Halls et al., 2007a), again suggesting that there is compartmentalization of signaling events and inferring that distinct physiologic outcomes can be anticipated downstream of different cAMP signaling branches (Halls et al., 2007a). cAMP accumulation may also occur in response to relaxin by a G protein–independent mechanism, and in some cells may be downstream of a tyrosine kinase. In THP-1 cells and cultures of primary human myometrial or endometrial stromal cells, porcine relaxin increased cAMP accumulation that was blocked by inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity (Kuznetsova et al., 1999; Bartsch et al., 2001; Anand-Ivell et al., 2007; Heng et al., 2008). This response could be potentiated by the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors [bpV(phen) and mpV(pic)] that mimic tyrosine kinase activation (Bartsch et al., 2001). In human lower uterine segment fibroblasts, relaxin stimulation caused tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular extracts, with no effect upon cAMP accumulation (Palejwala et al., 1998). The tyrosine kinase–dependent increase in cAMP accumulation may occur by inhibition of a PDE, thereby preventing cAMP hydrolysis and thus reflexively increasing cAMP levels. However, the same tyrosine kinase inhibitors do not affect relaxin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HEK293 cells expressing RXFP1 (Anand-Ivell et al., 2007), emphasizing the variation in cellular responses between different cell types. In cells using the tyrosine kinase pathway, there was some degree of cAMP inhibition by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Anand-Ivell et al., 2007; Heng et al., 2008) and evidence of a negative feedback loop involving PKA (Anand-Ivell et al., 2007).\n\nThe stimulation of NO production, cGMP generation, and PKG activation provides another crucial pathway by which relaxin exerts its effects. Depending on the cell type under investigation, relaxin may activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (Baccari et al., 2007; Dschietzig et al., 2012) and neuronal NOS (nNOS) (Baccari et al., 2004; Mookerjee et al., 2009) or stimulate the expression of inducible NOS (iNOS) (Bani et al., 1998a; Alexiou et al., 2013) ( ). In rat isolated lungs, the relaxin-mediated iNOS upregulation depends on a subtle balance between stimulatory ERK1/2 activation and counterregulatory PI3K stimulation (Alexiou et al., 2013).\n\nIn addition to cAMP accumulation, many cells that express RXFP1 such as human endometrial stromal cells (Zhang et al., 2002), THP-1 cells and primary cultures of human coronary artery cells, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, renal myofibroblasts (Mookerjee et al., 2009), and fibrochondrocytes (Ahmad et al., 2012) respond to relaxin with a rapid activation of ERK1/2 ( ). In normal human endometrial cells relaxin causes rapid but transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2, with a peak response between 5 and 10 minutes (Zhang et al., 2002). The same time course was observed for phosphorylation of MEK and CREB, but relaxin treatment did not affect Akt or JNK phosphorylation and treatment with a MEK inhibitor blocked phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to relaxin, suggesting that MEK is activated upstream of ERK1/2 (Zhang et al., 2002). Increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) in response to relaxin is also observed in THP-1 cells and cultures of human coronary artery and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and is associated with increased transcription of VEGF (Zhang et al., 2002).\n\nIn HeLa cells and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the pERK1/2 response is more prolonged (Dschietzig et al., 2003). In HeLa, EAhy926 (an endothelial cell line), HT-29 (a colonic cell line), and in primary fibrochondrocyte cells, relaxin increased the phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and Akt after 30 minutes (Dschietzig et al., 2009a; Ahmad et al., 2012). In primary fibrochondrocytes, treatment with relaxin also activates PI3K, PKCζ, NFκB, c-fos, and Elk-1, all of which influence the expression of MMP-9 (Ahmad et al., 2012). Relaxin also produces a sustained increase in pERK1/2 in rat renal myofibroblasts, potentiated by inhibition of Gαi/o by PTX, suggesting that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 may be downstream of G protein coupling (Mookerjee et al., 2009). In contrast, in human vascular smooth muscle cells, relaxin stimulation did not affect pERK1/2 levels but instead increased the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Dschietzig et al., 2003). In rat pulmonary arterial endothelial and smooth muscle cells, relaxin increased iNOS activity and expression dependent on a balance of pERK1/2 and PI3K pathway activation (Alexiou et al., 2013). Thus, although relaxin increases phosphorylation of a number of kinases in multiple cell types, the precise isoform and mode of activation appears to vary, and the physiologic consequences of activation of these pathways are as yet unclear.\n\nSeveral of the aforementioned canonical pathways are involved in the well established antifibrotic actions of relaxin. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is profibrotic, causing Smad2/3 phosphorylation, translocation of the Smad complex to the nucleus, and activation of profibrotic genes. Inhibition of this process by relaxin involves activation of PI3K and NOS-NO-cGMP signaling (Ahmad et al., 2012; Chow et al., 2012). There is also recent evidence that suggests that relaxin influences differentiation of neonatal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts by preventing the inhibition of Notch-1 signaling by TGF-β1. Notch-1 signaling controls cell differentiation and fate and is involved in fibrosis (Fan et al., 2011). The Notch-1 pathway comprises Notch-1 receptors that, when activated by the TM ligands Jagged1/2, release the Notch intracellular domain that migrates to the nucleus to inhibit transcription (Chillakuri et al., 2012). Downregulation of Notch-1 is a necessary step in the differentiation of rat cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and is induced by TGF-β1 (Fan et al., 2011). A recent study demonstrates that relaxin prevents the enhancement by TGF-β1 of cytoskeletal assembly in 3T3 cells and primary neonatal fibroblasts as measured by F-actin and vinculin staining (Sassoli et al., 2013). In addition, relaxin prevented the TGF-β1–mediated increases in α-SMA, type 1 collagen, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2, while preventing the TGF-β1–mediated decreases in MMP-2 and MMP-9. Relaxin treatment also prevented the downregulation of Notch-1 expression by TGF-β1 as well as the inhibition of Notch intracellular domain and Jagged-1 release (Sassoli et al., 2013).\n\n2. Noncanonical Signaling Pathways.\n\nRelaxin activates the GR, a nuclear receptor that acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor (Dschietzig et al., 2004). The activation, and the subsequent changes in gene transcription, may account for the many effects of relaxin upon the expression levels of a variety of proteins, including those involved in connective tissue metabolism (see above). Relaxin treatment of THP-1 cells that have differentiated into a macrophage phenotype blunts the stimulated production of cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and this effect is abolished by the GR antagonists RU-486 [mifepristone; 17β-hydroxy-11β-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)- 17α-(1-propinyl)estra-4,9-dien-3-on] and D06 [bis(4-N,N-dimethylaminophenyl)(2-chloro-5-nitrophenyl) methane] (Dschietzig et al., 2004, 2009a). Relaxin coimmunoprecipitates with the GR, and the amount of the GR within the nucleus increases after 30-minute stimulation with relaxin. In whole cell and in fluorescence polarization assays, relaxin displaces classic glucocorticoids from the GR (Dschietzig et al., 2004, 2009a). The region of relaxin that binds to the GR differs from that involved in relaxin binding to RXFP1, because a modified relaxin that was unable to activate RXFP1 could still interact with the GR, and relaxin was found to cause phosphorylation of S211 of the GR, which is used as a biomarker of agonist-related receptor activation (Dschietzig et al., 2009a). Indeed relaxin, via its interaction with the GR, is also able to autoregulate its own expression by binding to half-sites of glucocorticoid response elements located 160–200 bp upstream of transcription start at the human RLN2 promoter (Dschietzig et al., 2009b). Actions at the GR are also involved in the vasodilator effects of relaxin. In rat aortic rings, relaxation responses to acetylcholine are impaired by TNF-α in a model of endothelial dysfunction, and the effect is reversed by relaxin (Dschietzig et al., 2012). The reversal of the effect of TNF-α by relaxin is blocked by the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin but also by the GR and progesterone receptor antagonist RU-486. In rat primary aortic endothelial cells TNF-α treatment increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) and arginase II expression, decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1 expression, and stimulated superoxide and nitrotyrosine formation (Dschietzig et al., 2012). All of these effects were restored or attenuated by relaxin treatment acting at the GR (Dschietzig et al., 2012). The findings suggest that relaxin has a protective effect on endothelial dysfunction mediated not only by actions on the canonical PI3K-Akt-eNOS pathway but also by its actions at the GR, with SOD-1 upregulation being dependent on relaxin-GR-c/EBP-β signaling (Dschietzig et al., 2012). Reports that appear to confirm the principal relaxin-GR finding include relaxin-related protection in a rodent model of severe acute pancreatitis that is markedly attenuated after cotreatment with RU-486 (Cosen-Binker et al., 2006), relaxin-induced GR activation in reporter gene experiments (Halls et al., 2007a), and blockade of relaxin-mediated decreases in granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-8 secretion from primary decidual macrophages by RU-486 (Horton et al., 2011).\n\nHitherto, the precise mode of interaction between relaxin and GR has been unclear and there are contradictory findings regarding RXFP1 involvement in the relaxin-GR pathway. Although relaxin seems to interact with GR in spleen cells that do not express RXFP1 (Dschietzig et al., 2004) and also after chemical modification to destroy RXFP1 affinity (Dschietzig et al., 2009a), RXFP1 was necessary for relaxin to activate the GR in an in vitro study using reporter genes (Halls et al., 2007a).\n\n3. The Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 1 Signalosome—A Protein Complex That Facilitates High-Sensitivity Signaling in Response to Relaxin.\n\nResponses to relaxin produced by activation of canonical signaling pathways occur in the nanomolar concentration range (Bathgate et al., 2013a). However, circulating concentrations of relaxin are usually lower than those required to produce cellular responses by canonical mechanisms (Sherwood, 2004). Recently, a constitutive RXFP1-dependent cAMP response has been identified using Förster resonance energy transfer-based cAMP biosensors in single rat cardiac fibroblasts, HeLa cells, and HEK293 cells expressing RXFP1 (Halls and Cooper, 2010). The response is dependent upon a protein complex, or signalosome, linked to the relaxin receptor, and the signalosome is highly sensitive to attomolar concentrations of relaxin. Importantly, this may provide the basis for some of the physiologic responses to relaxin when it is present in the circulation at levels below those necessary to activate canonical signaling pathways. The signalosome consists of RXFP1 that is scaffolded to AC2 by AKAP79, facilitating efficient activation of the AC by Gαs and Gβγ subunits ( ). The levels of cAMP produced are tightly regulated by the activity of PKA-activated PDE4D3 that itself is scaffolded to the receptor C terminus (specifically requiring S704) by β-arrestin-2 (Halls and Cooper, 2010). The signalosome possesses stimulatory (AKAP79 and AC2) and regulatory (β-arrestin-2, PKA, and PDE4D3) arms that are both spatially and functionally distinct. Knockdown of AKAP79 has no effect on the regulatory arm, and knockdown of β-arrestin-2 does not influence the stimulatory arm of the signalosome. In addition, there is no effect of inhibitors of classic pathway specific proteins (including Gαi/o, PI3K, and PKC) on cAMP generated in response to subpicomolar concentrations of relaxin and no effect of inhibition of signalosome-specific proteins (including AC2, AKAP79, and β-arrestin-2) upon classic relaxin cAMP signaling. The pathways also generate cAMP in quite distinct regions of the cell. Thus signalosome-specific AC2 is known to be preferentially excluded from lipid-rich domains (Willoughby et al., 2007), whereas activation of the Gαi3 pathway with nanomolar relaxin concentrations depends upon lipid-rich domains in HEK293 cells (Halls et al., 2009b). Because AC2 expression occurs predominantly in brain, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, and uterine myometrium (Defer et al., 2000; Willoughby et al., 2007; Sadana and Dessauer, 2009), it is likely that some tissues display RXFP1 signalosome signaling, whereas others do not, which may help to determine the physiologic role of signalosome-localized RXFP1.\n\nTargeted protein knockdown or overexpression of dominant negative mutants (Halls and Cooper, 2010) suggests that the regulatory arm is isoform-specific (i.e., interacts only with PDE4D3) and that assembly of the components depends upon constitutive association between the receptor and β-arrestin-2 (not β-arrestin-1) (Halls and Cooper, 2010). The regulatory arm also has some unusual features that call into question some of the current paradigms surrounding β-arrestins and receptor desensitization and internalization (DeFea, 2011). For example, the β2-adrenoceptor is phosphorylated by G protein receptor kinase (GRK)-2 after receptor activation, and subsequently becomes a substrate for β-arrestin-2 that triggers formation of clathrin-coated vesicles and internalization (for review, see Luttrell and Gesty-Palmer, 2010). However, and in contrast, the interaction between RXFP1 and β-arrestin-2 is constitutive and does not involve receptor activation or phosphorylation and does not appear to be involved in desensitization (Halls and Cooper, 2010). Although the interaction involves S704 of RXFP1 (Halls and Cooper, 2010), there is no significant increase in RXFP1 phosphorylation after stimulation with high concentrations of relaxin nor any effect of receptor activation on desensitization or internalization (Tan et al., 1998; Callander et al., 2009). Thus β-arrestin-2 appears to act solely as a scaffold for the formation of the regulatory complex and has no role in receptor desensitization or internalization. On the other hand, the stimulatory arm of the signalosome depends upon a specific and constitutive association between helix 8 of the receptor and AKAP79 ( ). However, AKAP79 is also known to scaffold many other proteins including other GPCRs, PKC, several ion channels, and a number of AC isoforms (see Baillie et al., 2005; Dessauer, 2009; Skroblin et al., 2010; Halls, 2012). The activity of AC isoforms may be variably influenced by interaction with AKAP79 and AC2 activity is inhibited (Efendiev et al., 2010), although this appears to be primarily offset in RXFP1 signalosomes by the scaffolding of RXFP1 and AC2. Signalosome signaling occurs quite separately from canonical signaling, and the signalosome complex dissociates when exposed to nanomolar concentrations of relaxin (Halls and Cooper, 2010).\n\nHigh-sensitivity signaling such as that exhibited by the RXFP1 signalosome has been previously shown for suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production by IL-15 (Alleva et al., 1997), proliferation of helper T cells by IL-1 (Orencole and Dinarello, 1989), the effects of neuropeptides and neurosteroids in nociception (Sanchez-Blazquez and Garzon, 1995; Ueda et al., 2001), and the long-term effects of TGF-β on basal follicle-stimulating hormone levels (Ying et al., 1986). Thus the RXFP1-signalosome represents a highly sensitive signaling platform that produces tightly regulated cAMP responses over a wide range of subpicomolar relaxin concentrations. Although this represents a mechanism whereby cells and tissues could respond to low circulating levels of relaxin, a precise physiologic role for the mechanism has yet to be determined.\n\n4. Homo- and Hetero-Oligomerization of RXFP1 and Its Functional Consequences.\n\nLike many other class A GPCRs, there is evidence from bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) studies that RXFP1 receptors form homo- and heterodimers (Kern et al., 2008; Svendsen et al., 2008a,b) in the absence of, and independent of, ligand occupation of the receptor (Svendsen et al., 2008a,b). It has been suggested that dimer formation is necessary for signal transduction, with ligand binding occurring at the LRR region of one dimer partner, followed by interaction of the bound ligand with the ECL2 of the second partner and initiation of signaling (Kong et al., 2010). However, at present there are no experiments with two inactive mutant receptor dimer partners that show complementation and rescue of function by dimerization to support this concept. One functional consequence of dimerization is negative cooperativity (Svendsen et al., 2008a,b), where the two binding sites do not have a fixed affinity and the affinity of each remaining unoccupied receptor binding site decreases as occupancy increases. The evidence for negative cooperativity at RXFP1 comprises receptor kinetic studies where the rate of dissociation after incubation of cells expressing RXFP1 with [125I]human relaxin was determined after equilibration followed by infinite dilution in the absence or presence of unlabeled ligand. The presence of unlabeled ligand was associated with modest increases in the rate of dissociation, suggesting negative cooperativity. It should be borne in mind, however, that such behavior does not necessarily reflect the formation of dimers (Chabre et al., 2009), and studies are required using receptors that retain function but are unable to form dimers or on receptors expressed in model phospholipid bilayers that allow examination of their functional characteristics when in monomeric form (Whorton et al., 2007; Velez-Ruiz and Sunahara, 2011). Nevertheless, there are two intriguing, functionally relevant consequences of negative cooperativity: an increased functional range of the ligand over a wider concentration range and a decrease in ligand residence time at the receptor as the free ligand concentration increases, potentially allowing selective activation of different signaling pathways (Shymko et al., 1997). The negative cooperativity concentration-response curve for relaxin binding to RXFP1 is linear, although the absence of a protein structure precludes conclusions regarding the functional consequences of this observation (Svendsen et al., 2008b).\n\nReceptor oligomerization has been suggested to explain one intriguing aspect of relaxin-RXFP1 pharmacology, the phenomenon of bell-shaped concentration-response curves that are observed in many bioassays from studies in recombinant and primary cell systems (Halls et al., 2006; Sarwar et al., 2015), animal studies (Danielson and Conrad, 2003; Debrah et al., 2005), and clinical trials (Teerlink et al., 2009). Negative cooperativity could be a potential explanation, but currently available information does not appear to support this mechanism. Although both RXFP1 and RXFP2 display negative cooperativity, bell-shaped curves for cAMP accumulation are observed only in response to 3- or 30-minute activation of RXFP1 or 30-minute activation of RXFP2, but not 3-minute activation of RXFP2 (Halls et al., 2006). It could be argued that the RXFP2 system at 3 minutes is not in equilibrium and that the effect of increasing receptor occupation balances out the reduced receptor affinity, but this does not convincingly explain the difference between RXFP1 and RXFP2 at the same time point. In studies of human vascular cells that endogenously express RXFP1, venous endothelial and smooth muscle cells displayed pronounced bell-shaped concentration-response curves, yet arterial smooth muscle cells showed conventional sigmoidal concentration-response curves (Sarwar et al., 2015). This would appear to be incompatible with an explanation based on RXFP1 homodimer formation and negative cooperativity.\n\nThere is also evidence for dimer formation between the haloreceptor and a number of splice variants (encoding the LDLa module only and up to eight LRR) and dimers are present at all stages of receptor translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (Kern et al., 2008). This suggests an important role of dimerization over the lifetime of the receptor. Dimers were also formed between the haloreceptor and a TM-only domain receptor, although the BRET2 ratio was decreased compared with that obtained for haloreceptor dimers (Svendsen et al., 2008a,b). This suggests that although the TM domain is sufficient for dimerization, the ectodomains play an important role in stabilizing the oligomer. Examination of three of the splice variants cloned from human fetal membranes showed that although their expression in HEK293 cells produced no response to relaxin (Kern et al., 2008), coexpression with RXFP1 produced a parallel shift to the right of the cAMP concentration-response curve. Because the splice variants also markedly reduced cell surface expression of RXFP1, the reduced responses are likely due to a dominant negative effect of the splice variants (Kern et al., 2008).\n\nRecent studies also suggest that there is heterodimer formation between RXFP1 and other GPCRs. The antifibrotic actions of relaxin are believed to be mediated through a RXFP1-pERK1/2-nNOS-NO-cGMP dependent pathway, leading to regulation of collagen-degrading MMPs (Chow et al., 2012). The effect of relaxin is completely absent in angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R)−/y mice or in mice treated with the AT2R antagonist PD123319 [S-(+)-1-[(4-(dimethylamino)-3-methylphenyl)methyl]-5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine-6-carboxylic acid di(trifluoroacetate)], suggesting that the AT2R is necessary for the antifibrotic actions of relaxin. Interestingly BRET studies show that RXFP1 and AT2R form constitutive heterodimers, indicating that the receptor complex is responsible for the novel pharmacology observed ( ). There is no direct binding of relaxin to the AT2R, and the peptide does not affect the BRET signal from RXFP1-AT2R complexes (Chow et al., 2014). Importantly, the findings also explain why the antifibrotic actions of relaxin are only observed in pathologic states: under normal physiologic conditions AT2R are expressed at low levels but are dramatically increased with injury and disease (Siragy and Carey, 1997; Matsubara, 1998; Carey, 2005; Savoia et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2008).\n\nIt is interesting to note that the expression of relaxin-RXFP1 as measured by immunohistochemistry and expression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may both be increased during pregnancy (Ferreira et al., 2009; Cheung and Lafayette, 2013), suggesting another state where RXFP1-AT2R heterodimers may have a functional role. However, a study in rat primary mesangial cells did not corroborate this suggestion (Carvalho et al., 2012). Although RXFP1 and AT2R were increased in cells obtained from pregnant rats compared with virgin animals and the hyporesponsiveness of cells from pregnant animals to angiotensin II could be attributed to increased endogenous relaxin production, the AT2R antagonist PD123319 had no effect"
