Specifically, the present invention relates to active agents or compounds as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds, which are capable of reducing or inhibiting or blocking the enzymatic activity of the glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase (QPCT) protein and/or glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like protein (QPCTL) protein or the expression of QPCT gene and/or QPCTL gene. Also provided are methods for screening or selecting for said compounds. The present invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a first active agent (e.g. drug such as an anti-CD47 antibody or an anti-PD-L1 antibody) for use in a method of treating a condition in a subject that would benefit from reducing signaling or binding between SIRPa and CD47 in the subject (e.g. cancer), wherein the method of treating comprises reducing expression or enzymatic activity of QPCTL and/or QPCT in the cell with CD47 on the surface (e.g. by using the compounds as taught herein (QPCT inhibitors and/or QPCTL inhibitors)). The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be particularly useful for treating a subject suffering from a disease or condition involving the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis such including e.g., various cancer types, atherosclerosis, fibrotic diseases, and infectious diseases.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nCancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for more than 8.8 million deaths in 2015. Several therapies to treat and/or cure cancer have been developed over the years including e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and cancer immunotherapy.\n\nCancer immunotherapy represents a type of cancer treatment designed to boost the body's natural immune defenses to fight cancer. Overall, the purpose of cancer immunotherapy is to promote the ability of the immune system, including the innate immune system, to specifically detect and destroy cancer cells (e.g. via phagocytosis) while leaving healthy cells unaffected. However, cancer cells are able to evade immune surveillance in many ways, for instance by evading phagocytosis by phagocyte cells (e.g. macrophages or neutrophils) through the expression of so-called \"anti-phagocytic\" or \"don't eat me\" signals. One prominent example of such signal is the transmembrane protein \"cluster of differentiation 47\" (abbreviated as \"CD47\"). CD47 is expressed by virtually all cells in the body and is involved in a range of cellular processes, including apoptosis, proliferation, adhesion, and migration as well as angiogenic and immune responses. CD47 binds or interact with several ligands with signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa) being considered as a main ligand for CD47. SIRPa is an inhibitory transmembrane receptor present on myeloid cells such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes, and dendritic cells. The interaction between CD47 and SIRPa mediates or conveys \"antiphagocytic\" or \"don't eat me\" signals between two cells, which ultimately inhibit phagocytosis. In the case of cancer, it was found that cancer cells upregulate the expression of CD47 at their cell surface compared to the CD47 levels found in normal/healthy cells. As a result, cancer cells can evade destruction by the immune system or evade immune surveillance, e.g. by evading phagocytosis by immune cells such as phagocyte cells (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils). This phenomenon is not limited to cancer. It was also found that diseased cells in conditions other than cancer, such as e.g. atherosclerosis, fibrotic diseases as well as infectious diseases caused by pathogens (e.g. virus), also upregulate the expression of CD47 at their cell surface compared to the CD47 levels found in normal/healthy cells to evade phagocytosis by phagocytes. In the case of cancer, current approaches to antagonize the CD47-SIRPa interactions have principally targeted CD47. For instance, several anti-CD47 antibodies aimed at interfering or blocking CD47-SIRPa interactions are currently being developed or tested in clinical trials. Although promising, such strategies are not optimal since antibodies are known to have poor tissue penetration, especially into solid tumors due to their large molecular weight. Further, such antibodies, particularly antibodies targeting CD47 lack specificity since CD47 is widely distributed throughout the body, including healthy tissue, which may cause on-target toxicity to normal cells. Other disadvantages associated with the use of anti-CD47 antibodies include the lack of oral bioavailability and undesirable side effects such as the development of anemia (which may occur as a result of a dose- dependent loss of red blood cells and platelets) as well as hemagglutination (clumping of red blood cells). Therefore there is a need for CD47-targeting therapies that do not cause significant levels toxicity, and/or platelet depletion and/or hemagglutination (clumping of red blood cells together) and/or red blood cell depletion, and/or anemia when administered to a subject and/ or that have the potential of oral bioavailability. There is also a need for methods for screening or selecting for such compounds, as well as methods for identifying subjects susceptible from benefiting from treatment with an effective amount of said compounds. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nDescribed herein are methods and compositions for reducing binding between CD47 and SIRPa by reducing expression or enzymatic activity of glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase (QPCT) as well as its related isoenzyme, the glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like (QPCTL), or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the reduction of binding between CD47 and SIRPa results in an inhibition or reduction of the CD47-SIRPct signaling axis.\n\nIn one aspect, compositions disclosed herein comprise an active agent for use in a method of treating a condition in a subject that would benefit from reducing binding between CD47 on the surface of a first cell and SIRPa on the surface of a second cell in the subject, wherein the active agent reduces expression or enzymatic activity of glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase (QPCT) as well as its related isoenzyme, the glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like (QPCTL), or combinations thereof, in said first cell with CD47 on the surface.\n\nIn some embodiments reducing expression or enzymatic activity of QPCT, QPCTL, or combinations thereof, comprises reducing the transcription, translation or combinations thereof of the genes encoding QPCT, QPCTL, or combinations thereof.\n\nIn some embodiments, the composition disclosed herein comprises a double stranded RNA molecule, a small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) molecule, an inhibitory RNA (RNAi) molecule, or combinations thereof designed to reduce expression of QPCT, QPCTL, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the composition disclosed herein comprises an inhibitor of QPCT, QPCTL, or combinations thereof.\n\nAlso disclosed herein, are compositions comprising a CD47 inhibitor (e.g. a CD47 antibody, or a CD47 IgA antibody) for use in a method of treating a condition in a subject, wherein the subject would benefit from reducing binding between CD47 on the surface of a first cell and SIRPa on the surface of a second cell, and wherein the CD47 inhibitor is an inhibitor that binds said CD47 on the surface of said first cell and thereby reduces the binding of said CD47 to said SIRPa on the surface of said second cell, and wherein the method of treating comprises reducing expression or enzymatic activity of QPCTL, QPCT, or combinations thereof in said first cell. In some embodiments, the CD47 inhibitor is an antibody.\n\nAlso disclosed herein, are compositions comprising a SIRPa inhibitor (e.g. a SIRPa (or \"SIRPa\" or \"SIRP alpha\") antibody) for use in a method of treating a condition in a subject, wherein the subject would benefit from reducing binding between CD47 on the surface of a first cell (e.g. a diseased cell such as a cancer cell) and SIRPa on the surface of a second cell (e.g. macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells), and wherein the SIRPa inhibitor is an inhibitor that binds said SIRPa on the surface of said second cell and thereby reduces the binding of said SIRPa to said CD47 on the surface of said first cell, and wherein the method of treating further comprises reducing expression or enzymatic activity of QPCTL, QPCT, or combinations thereof in said first cell. In some embodiments, the SIRPa inhibitor is an antibody.\n\nIn some embodiments, the condition that would benefit from reducing binding between CD47 on the surface of a first cell and SIRPa on the surface of a second cell in the subject is selected from the group consisting of cancer, atherosclerosis, fibrotic disease, and infectious disease.\n\nIn some embodiments, reducing binding between CD47 and SIRPa targets the cell expressing CD47 for phagocytosis or targets cells expressing CD47 for antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or targets cells expressing CD47 for antibody- dependent cellular phagocytosis (abbreviated ADCP). Also disclosed herein are in vitro methods for selecting or screening for active agents that reduce binding between CD47 on the surface of a first cell and SIRPa on the surface of a second cell, the method comprising screening for active agents that reduce expression or enzymatic activity of QPCTL, QPCT, or combinations thereof.\n\nAlso disclosed herein is the use of an inhibitor of QPCTL, QPCT, or combinations thereof for reducing binding between CD47 on the surface of a first cell and SIRPa on the surface of a second cell in a subject.

Such terms are to be given their ordinary meaning in the art to which the invention pertains, unless otherwise indicated. Other specifically defined terms are to be construed in a manner consistent with the definition provided herein. Any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice for testing of the present invention. For purposes of the present invention, the following terms are defined below. As used herein, the singular forms \"a,\" \"an\" and \"the\" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, a method for administrating a drug includes the administrating of a plurality of molecules (e.g. 10's, 100's, 1000's, 10's of thousands, 100's of thousands, millions, or more molecules).\n\nAs used herein, the term \"and/or\" indicates that one or more of the stated cases may occur, alone or in combination with at least one of the stated cases, up to with all of the stated cases.\n\nAs used herein, \"to comprise\" and its conjugations is used in its non-limiting sense to mean that items following the word are included, but items not specifically mentioned are not excluded. It also encompasses the more limiting \"to consist of.\"\n\nThe term \"about\" and \"approximately\" as used herein refer to a measurable value such as an amount, a temporal duration, and the like, is meant to encompass variations of Â±20% or Â±10%, more preferably Â±5%, even more preferably Â±1 %, and still more preferably Â±0.1 % from the specified value, as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed methods.\n\nThe term \"conventional techniques\" or \"methods known to the skilled person\" as used herein refers to a situation wherein the methods of carrying out the conventional techniques used in methods of the invention will be evident to the skilled worker. The practice of conventional techniques in molecular biology, biochemistry, cell culture, genomics, sequencing, drug screening, and related fields are well-known to those skilled in the art. The term \"diseased cells\" as used herein refers to a cell which is found in a diseased individual (suffering from a disease or pathological condition, e.g. cancer) and which is abnormal in terms of its structure and/or functioning and/or metabolism and/or genome compared to a cell having a structure, function, metabolism, and genome that are characteristic of a cell found in a healthy individual (not suffering from a disease or condition, e.g. cancer). In the context of the present invention, non-limiting examples of diseased cells include cancer or tumor cells (e.g. in the case of cancer), diseased vascular smooth muscle cells and diseased endothelial cells (e.g. in the case of atherosclerosis), diseased cells infected by a pathogen such as a virus (e.g. in the case of infectious diseases), diseased cells undergoing fibrosis (e.g. in the case of fibrotic diseases), and others. It is further understood that the phenotype, physical aspects or characteristics of the diseased cells will vary depending on the disease or condition (e.g. cancer, atherosclerosis, fibrotic disease and infectious disease, etc.). For instance, in the case of cancer, diseased cells divide relentlessly, forming solid tumors or flooding the blood with abnormal cells (e.g. expressing specific markers at their cell surface, having an altered morphology, altered cell cycle, altered genome, etc., which are distinct from (healthy) cells derived from a non-diseased or healthy individuals (e.g. not suffering from cancer)). The skilled person knows how to distinguish, using standard techniques and knowledge (e.g. using disease-specific markers), a diseased cell from a non-diseased or healthy cell depending on the diseases or conditions, e.g. cancer, atherosclerosis, fibrotic disease and infectious disease, etc., including various cancer types, fibrosis disease type as well as infectious disease types. In addition to the presence of disease-specific markers, the diseased cells also express or overexpress CD47 (although overexpression is not necessary for detecting a diseased cell according to the present invention) at its surface. /pet\n\nThe term \"don't eat me signal\" or \"anti-phagocytic signal\" as used herein is a term commonly used in immunology to refer to a signal (e.g. molecular or chemical signal(s)) that impedes or interferes or prevents or reduces the action of phagocytes (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils) towards a given cell or substances or material, e.g. reducing or preventing or blocking or inhibiting phagocytosis. The term \"small molecule\" as used herein refers to a term commonly used in molecular biology and pharmacology for referring to an organic compound having a low molecular weight (< 900 daltons) with a size on the order of 1 nm. Small molecules are actively sought after for their ability to regulate biological processes, which explains why most drugs are small molecules. Because of their upper molecular-weight limit of approximately 900 daltons, small molecules can rapidly diffuse across cell membranes to reach intracellular sites of action (e.g. Golgi). Although not essential, a lower molecular-weight limit of approximately 500 daltons is often recommended for small molecule drug development candidates based on the observation that clinical attrition rates are significantly reduced if the molecular weight is kept below this 500 dalton limit. Small molecules are selected or categorized based on ability to bind to a specific biological target, such as a specific protein (e.g. QPCTL or QPCT protein) or nucleic acid (e.g. QPCTL or QPCT gene), and for their ability to act as an effector (e.g. activating or inhibiting) for altering the activity or function of the target (e.g. blocking or reducing enzymatic activity, prevent binding to a target, prevent posttranslational modification of a target, etc.). Small molecules may be natural (such as secondary metabolites) or artificial (e.g. drugs); they may have a beneficial effect against a disease (e.g. drugs for treatment of cancer) or may be detrimental (e.g. teratogens and carcinogens). Very small oligomers may also be considered small molecules, such as dinucleotides, peptides such as the antioxidant glutathione, and disaccharides such as sucrose. Small molecules may also be used as research tools to probe biological function as well as leads in the development of new therapeutic agents. Some can inhibit a specific function of a multifunctional protein or disrupt protein-protein interactions (e.g. block the interaction or binding between CD47 and SIRPa), etc. In the present invention, the small molecule may be an enzyme inhibitor, i.e. a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity.\n\nThe term \"biological sample\" or \"sample from a subject\" or \"biopsy\" as used herein encompasses a variety of sample types (for instance biological cancer sample) obtained from an organism or a subject and which can be used in a diagnostic or monitoring assay or screening assays as taught herein. The term encompasses blood and other liquid samples of biological origin, solid tissue samples, such as a biopsy specimen or tissue cultures or cells derived therefrom and the progeny thereof. The term encompasses samples that have been manipulated in any way after their procurement, such as by treatment with reagents, solubilization, or enrichment for certain components. The term encompasses a clinical sample, and also includes cells in cell culture, cell supernatants, cell lysates, serum, plasma, biological fluids, and tissue samples. The terms \"treatment\", \"treating\", \"treat\" and the like as used herein, generally refer to obtaining a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect (e.g. reduction of tumor size or cancer remission). The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a disease (e.g. a certain cancer) or symptom thereof and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete stabilization or cure for a disease (e.g. cancer comprising cells positive for CD47 or involving the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis) and/or adverse effect attributable to the disease. \"Treatment\" as used herein also covers any treatment of a disease (e.g. cancer such as a cancer comprising cells positive for CD47 or involving the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis) in a mammal, particularly a human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease or symptom from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease or symptom but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting or alleviating or reducing the disease symptom or consequences, i.e., arresting its development (e.g. reducing tumor size); or (c) relieving the disease symptom, i.e., causing regression of the disease or symptom. With respect to the pharmaceutical compositions used in the treatments disclosed herein, it will be understood these may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. As is known to those skilled in the art, the amount of active ingredient per dose will depend on the condition being treated, the route of administration and the age, weight and condition of the patient. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art.\n\nThe compounds used in the treatments as disclosed herein may be administered by any appropriate route. Suitable routes include oral, rectal, nasal, topical, buccal, sublingual, vaginal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal, by inhalation, and epidural. A preferred route of administration may depend, for example, on the condition of the patient and the disease to be treated. It will also be understood that, in case of combination treatments, each of the active compounds may be administered by the same or different routes.\n\nPharmaceutical compositions may be presented as capsules, tablets, powders, granules, solutions, suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids, edible, oil-in-water liquid emulsions, water-in-oil liquid emulsions, solution, syrups and elixirs, in microencapsulated form, liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles, transdermal patches, ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, drops, sprays, aerosols, oils, lozenges, pastilles, mouth washes, suppositories, enemas, aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions, and so on.\n\nIt will be appreciated that the compositions may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation.\n\nDepending on the agent to be administered, the pharmaceutical compositions and compounds as disclosed herein may suitably be provided several times per day, once every day, once every other day, once per one, two or three week, once per one, two, three or four months, and so on. In some embodiments treatment with the compound is performed for a certain period of time, for example, for one, two, the, four, five weeks or months and then discontinued for a certain period of time, for example, for one, two, the, four, five weeks or months.\n\nWith respect to any of the combination treatments as described herein, the compounds in such combination treatment may be employed in combination in accordance with the invention by administration simultaneously in a pharmaceutical composition including both compounds. Alternatively, the combination may be administered separately in separate pharmaceutical compositions, each including different compound(s) and in a sequential manner wherein a first compound is administered first and the other second. Sequential administration may be close in time (e.g. simultaneously) or remote in time. Furthermore, it does not matter if the compounds are administered in the same dosage form or the same route of administration.\n\nThus in one embodiment, one or more doses of a first compound is administered simultaneously or separately with one or more doses of a second (or third, fourth, ... ) compound.\n\nSuitably the combinations of this invention are administered within a \"specified period\" (the interval of time between the administration of the first compound of the combination and last compound of the combination). For example, within 1 , 2, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours, two, three, four, five, six, seven days, one, two, three, four weeks, one, two, three, four, five, six or more months. For example, a first compound may be provided daily whereas the second compound is provided weekly; in such example the specified period wherein the combination of the invention is provided is one week.\n\nAlternatively, the compounds in the combination are administered sequentially. For example, the first compound is provided to the patient for a certain period, e.g. for two or more consecutive days or weeks, then followed by administration of a next compound of the combination of the invention as disclosed herein, for example for a period of two, three or four days or weeks. As mentioned, also, contemplated herein is a drug holiday utilized among the administration of the compounds (either single or in the combination of the inventions).\n\nAn example of a dosage regimen may be that a first compound is administered for from 1 to 30 consecutive days, followed by an optional drug holiday, followed by administration of second compound for from 1 to 30 consecutive days, followed by an optional drug holiday. Another example may be that a first compound is administered once every two weeks for from 2 to 10 weeks and, optionally a second compound is administered daily for from 1 to 30 consecutive days or longer.\n\nIt will be understood that a \"specified period\" administration and a \"sequential\" administration can be followed by repeat dosing or can be followed by an alternate dosing protocol, and a drug holiday may precede the repeat dosing or alternate dosing protocol.\n\nThe terms \"recipient\", \"individual\", \"subject\", \"host\", and \"patient\" are used herein interchangeably and refer to any mammalian subject (e.g. human, rat, mouse, cat, dogs, horses, etc.) for whom diagnosis, treatment, or therapy is desired, particularly humans. The term \"condition or disease involving the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis\" as used herein refers to any conditions or diseases, wherein cells (e.g. diseased cells such as cancer cells, diseased vascular smooth muscle cells, diseased endothelial cells, diseased cells infected by a pathogen (e.g. virus), diseased cells undergoing fibrosis, etc.)) make use of the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis, for example, so as to convey a \"anti-phagocytic signals\" or \"don't eat me signals\" for the purpose of evading or escaping or avoiding phagocytosis by phagocytes (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils). Non-limiting examples of conditions or diseases involving the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis include various cancer types, atherosclerosis, various fibrotic diseases as well as various infectious diseases, specific examples of which are as taught herein. The term \"condition or disease involving the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis\" also encompasses conditions wherein it is beneficial to perform cell depletion or cell replacement from the body, and wherein CD47 expression on said the depleted cells (e.g. hematopoietic stem cells) or said replaced cells (e.g. hematopoietic stem cells) impede or reduce the efficiency or benefit of said depletion or replacement. Non-limiting examples of such conditions include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, blood transfusion or other administration of other blood products to treat blood cell deficiencies (such as, e.g., thrombocytopenia).\n\nThe term \"a condition in a subject that would benefit from reducing signaling or binding between CD47 and SIRPa\" as used herein refers to any conditions or diseases wherein the diseased cells make use or take advantage of the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis, for example to evade elimination, by e.g. phagocytosis by phagocytes (e.g. macrophages) by expressing anti-phagocytic signals such as CD47 (e.g. by expressing or overexpressing CD47 at their cell surface) to convey a \"don't eat me signal\". In the context of the present invention, non-limiting examples of a conditions or diseases in a subject that would benefit from reducing signaling or binding between CD47 and SIRPa include various types of cancer (e.g. leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), ovarian cancer, gliomas, colon cancer, breast cancer, leiomyosarcoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, small cell lung cancer, and bladder cancer, HNSCC, Gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, T-ALL, glioma, mesothelioma, glioblastoma, melanoma and NSCLC, and others), various type of fibrotic diseases (e.g. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), scleroderma, myelofibrosis, kidney fibrosis, liver fibrosis, lung fibrosis, pancreas fibrosis, heart fibrosis, and bladder fibrosis, and others), various type of infectious diseases caused by a pathogens such as a virus (e.g. infectious diseases caused by lentivirus, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), an hepadna virus, hepatitis B virus, a herpes virus, human papilloma virus, la crosse virus, Yersinia sp., Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Franciscella sp., Helicobacter sp., Helicobacter pylori, Pasturella sp., Vibrio sp., Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahemolyticus, Legionella sp., Legionella pneumophila, Listeria sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Mycoplasma sp., Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Mycobacterium sp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Rickettsia sp., Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia typhi, a Plasmodium, a Trypanosoma, a Giardia, a Toxoplasma, and a Leishmania, and others), atherosclerosis, and others.\n\nThe term \"cell with CD47 on the surface\" or \"cell expressing or overexpressing CD47 on its surface\" as used herein refers to the phenotype of said cell, such as a diseased cell as taught herein, wherein the phenotype is defined by the presence of the CD47 protein or polypeptide, preferably at the cell surface of said cell. Non-limiting examples of cells expressing or overexpressing CD47 on their surface include diseased cells such as cancer cells, diseased vascular smooth muscle cells, diseased endothelial cells, diseased cells infected by a pathogen (e.g. virus), and diseased cells undergoing fibrosis. Cells expressing CD47 can be identified by flow cytometry using a suitable anti-CD47 antibody as the affinity ligand or by immunohistochemistry using a suitable anti-CD47 antibody or by in situ hybridization techniques using suitable CD47 mRNA probes, or by any other suitable methods leading to the detection of CD47 protein or fragments thereof and/or CD47 gene (DNA or mRNA) or variants thereof. The cells examined for CD47 phenotype may be cells derived from standard biopsy samples including tissue or cell samples and/or blood samples taken from a subject.\n\nThe term \"active agent\" as used herein refers to a compound such as a pharmaceutical compound or an effective drug or therapeutic, which has biological or pharmacological activity in a living system. To be an effective drug (with biological activity), a compound not only must be active against a specific target, but also possess the appropriate ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) properties necessary to make it suitable for use as a drug in a living system (e.g. in humans). It is further understood that the biological activity of a given active agent or compound is generally dosage-dependent. Further, the term \"active agent capable of reducing the expression or the enzymatic activity of the QPCTL protein and/or QPCT protein or the expression of the QPCTL gene and/or QPCT gene in a cell expressing CD47 at its surface\", and related terms, as used herein also refers to any compound, such as those described herein, capable of down-regulating or reducing or blocking the enzymatic activity of the QPCTL protein and/or QPCT protein or down-regulating or reducing or blocking the expression of the QPCTL gene and/or QPCT gene in a cell (e.g. cancer cell) contacted or treated with said compound, by at least about 5% or up to about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or about 95% or more or up (preferably at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and more) compared to the level of enzymatic activity of the QPCTL protein and/or QPCT protein or the level of expression of QPCTL gene and/or QPCT gene in a cell (e.g. cancer cell) not contacted or not treated with said compound.\n\nThe term \"active agent (compounds as taught herein) capable of reducing the binding between CD47 and SIRPa\", and related terms, as used herein also refers to any compound, such as those described herein, capable of down-regulating or reducing or blocking the binding between CD47 on the surface of a first cell (e.g. cancer cell) and SIRPa on the surface of a second cell (e.g. immune cell such as a macrophage) when said first cell is contacted or treated with said compound, and wherein the binding between CD47 and SIRPa is down-regulated or reduced or blocked by at least about 5% or up to about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or about 95% or more or up (preferably at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and more) compared to the level of binding between CD47 on the surface of a first cell (e.g. cancer cell) and SIRPa on the surface of a second cell (e.g. macrophage, neutrophils) when said first cell is not contacted or treated with said compound.\n\nThe term \"active agent (compounds as taught herein) capable of \"modulating (e.g. boosting or up-regulating or increasing) phagocytosis of a diseased cell\" and related terms, as used herein also refers to any compound, such as those described herein, capable of modulating or boosting or increasing phagocytosis of a diseased cell, when said diseased cell is contacted or treated with said compound, and wherein the modulating (e.g. up-regulating or boosting or increasing) phagocytosis of a diseased cell is boosted or up-regulated or increased or modulated by at least about 5% or up to about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or about 95% or more or up (preferably at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and more) compared to the level of phagocytosis of a diseased cell when said diseased cell is not contacted or treated with said compound. Phagocytosis or levels of phagocytosis of diseased cells can be measured using standard techniques (e.g. Ring et al (2017), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 114(49), E10578-E10585, hftp://doLorq/10.1073/pnas.171087711 ; Ho et al (2015), The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 290(20), pages 12650-12663, &^doLor^ Sockolosky et al (2016), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 1 13(19), E2646-54,\n\nThe term \"phagocytosis of a diseased cell\" as used herein encompasses all means by which a cell (e.g. a diseased cell) can be eliminated from the body or system as a result of phagocytosis by a phagocyte cell (e.g. macrophage, monocyte, neutrophil, basophil, eosinophil, or dendritic cell). For instance, phagocytosis of a diseased cell can be achieved by a process wherein a phagocyte cell engulfs a solid particle or a cell (e.g. diseased cell) to form an internal compartment known as a phagosome. The phagosome of ingested material (e.g. cell) is then fused with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. Within the phagolysosome, enzymes and toxic peroxides digest the ingested material (e.g. diseased cell), resulting in its elimination from the body. Another example by which phagocytosis of a diseased cell may be achieved is through \"antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis\" (abbreviated (ADCP)). Briefly, ADCP involves Fc receptors, which are proteins found on the surface of certain cells including, among others, B lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, human platelets, and mast cells. The Fc receptor binds specifically to a part of an antibody known as the Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis occurs when Fc receptors on cells (e.g. B lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and others) bind to antibodies (e.g. CD47 antibody such as a CD47 IgA antibody) that are attached to diseased cells (e.g. cancer cells) or infected cells or invading pathogens. This in turn stimulates phagocytic cells (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils) or cytotoxic cells to destroy diseased cells (e.g. cancer cells) or microbes, or infected cells by antibody-mediated phagocytosis or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In the present invention, it was found that the killing of diseased cells (e.g. cancer cells) via ADCP (using compounds as taught herein) is greater or enhanced when the Fc receptors on cells (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils) bind to IgA antibodies (e.g. any type of IgA antibodies, e.g. a CD47 IgA antibody) compared to IgG antibodies.\n\nThe term \"active agent (compounds as taught herein) capable of \"modulating (e.g. boosting or up-regulating or increasing) the killing or the death of a diseased cell via ADCP and related terms, as used herein also refers to any compound, such as those described herein, capable of modulating or boosting or increasing the killing or the death of a diseased cell via ADCP, when said diseased cell is contacted or treated with said compound, and wherein the modulating (e.g. up-regulating or boosting or increasing) the killing or death of a diseased cell via ADCP is boosted or up-regulated or increased or modulated by at least about 5% or up to about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or about 95% or more or up (preferably at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and more) compared to the level of killing or death of a diseased cell via ADCP when said diseased cell is not contacted or treated with said compound. Killing or death or levels of killing or death of diseased cells via ADCP can be measured using standard techniques (e.g. Treffers et al (2017), European Journal of Immunology., Vol. 48. 10.1002/eji.201747215, e.g. using macrophages as effectorcells to assay ADCP). In some embodiments, the \"modulating (e.g. boosting or up-regulating or increasing) of the killing of a diseased cell (e.g. cancer cells) via ADCP (using compounds as taught herein) involves or uses IgA antibodies (e.g. anti- Her2-lgA1 antibody or anti-CD47-lgA antibody, and others).\n\nThe term \"active agent (compounds as taught herein) capable of \"modulating (e.g. boosting or up-regulating or increasing) immune-cell mediated killing of a diseased cell\" and related terms, as used herein also refers to any compound, such as those described herein, capable of modulating or boosting or increasing immune-cell mediated killing of a diseased cell, when said diseased cell is contacted or treated with said compound, and wherein the modulating (e.g. up-regulating or boosting or increasing) of immune-cell mediated killing of a diseased cell is boosted or up-regulated or increased or modulated by at least about 5% or up to about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or about 95% or more or up (preferably at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and more) compared to the level of immune-cell mediated killing of a diseased cell when said diseased cell is not contacted or treated with said compound. Immune-cell mediated killing or levels of immune-cell mediated killing of diseased cells can be measured using standard techniques (Treffers et al (2017), European Journal of Immunology., Vol. 48. 10.1002/eji.201747215, using neutrophils as effector cells to assay ADCC or macrophages as effector cells to assay ADCP; Ring et al (2017), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 1 14(49), E10578-E 10585, http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1710877114 (to assay phagocytosis); Ho et al (2015), The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 290(20), pages 12650-12663, http://doi.org/10.1074/ibc.M115.648220 (to assay phagocytosis); Sockolosky et al (2016), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 1 13(19), E2646-54, http://dol.Org/10.1073/pnas.1604268113 (to assay phagocytosis). In some embodiments, the \"modulating (e.g. boosting or up- regulating or increasing) of the killing of a diseased cell (e.g. cancer cells) via ADCP (using compounds as taught herein) involves or uses IgA antibodies (e.g. anti- Her2-lgA1 antibody or anti-CD47-lgA antibody, and others). In some embodiments, the \"modulating (e.g. boosting or up-regulating or increasing) of the killing of a diseased cell (e.g. cancer cells) via ADCC (using compounds as taught herein) involves or uses IgA antibodies (e.g. anti- Her2-lgA1 antibody or anti-CD47-lgA antibody, and others).\n\nThe term \"immune-cell mediated killing of a diseased cell\" as used herein refers to ways by which a diseased cell (e.g. cancer cell) may be killed or eliminated by the immune system (or immune cells, e.g. macrophages, myeloid cells) and include killing cell s or inducing cell death via phagocytosis or via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or via antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis\" (abbreviated (ADCP) of diseased cells. The term \"antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC refers to a mechanism of cell-mediated immune defense whereby an effector cell of the immune system (e.g. neutrophil such as neutrophil Fey) actively lyses a target cell (e.g. diseased cells such as cancer cell) whose membrane-surface antigens have been bound by specific antibodies (e.g. a CD47 antibody). It was shown that ADCC can be promoted by interference with CD47-SIRPa interactions, e.g. blocking or reducing the interaction or binding between CD47 and SIRPa results in enhanced or increased phagocyte ADCC (Treffers et al (2017), Eur. J. Immunol., Vol 48(2), pages 1-1 1). Contrary to ADCP, killing or death of a diseased cell (e.g. cancer cell) via ADCC occurs as a result of direct toxicity and not via phagocytosis. In the present invention, it was found that the killing of diseased cells (e.g. cancer cells) via ADCC (using compounds as taught herein) is greater or enhanced when the Fc receptors on cells (e.g. neutrophils) bind to IgA antibodies (e.g. any type of IgA antibodies, e.g. a CD47 IgA antibody) compared to IgG antibodies.\n\nThe term \"active agent (compounds as taught herein) capable of \"modulating (e.g. boosting or up-regulating or increasing) the killing or the death of a diseased cell via ADCC and related terms, as used herein also refers to any compound, such as those described herein, capable of modulating or boosting or increasing the killing or the death of a diseased cell via ADCC, when said diseased cell is contacted or treated with said compound, and wherein the modulating (e.g. up-regulating or boosting or increasing) the killing or death of a diseased cell via ADCC is boosted or up-regulated or increased or modulated by at least about 5% or up to about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or about 95% or more or up (preferably at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and more) compared to the level of killing or death of a diseased cell via ADCP when said diseased cell is not contacted or treated with said compound. Killing or death or levels of killing or death of diseased cells via ADCC can be measured using standard techniques (e.g. Treffers et al (2017), Eur. J. Immunol., Vol 48(2), pages 1-1 1 , using neutrophils as effector cells). In some embodiments, the \"modulating (e.g. boosting or up-regulating or increasing) of the killing of a diseased cell (e.g. cancer cells) via ADCC (using compounds as taught herein) involves or uses IgA antibodies (e.g. anti- Her2-lgA1 antibody or anti-CD47-lgA antibody, and others).\n\nIn the context of the present invention, in some embodiments, the compounds as taught herein (e.g. compounds selected from compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a compound disclosed in Table A, B, C, D, or E, e.g. PBD150, PQ912, PQ1565, 000051 , 000054, 00016, 000034, 000035, 000037, 000055, 000024, 000027, 000050, 000020, 000021 , 000022, 000023, 000025, 000010, 000026, 00001 1 , 000036, 000029, 000048, 000049, 000012, 000030, 000031 , 000013, 000014, 000032, 000052, 000053, 000064, 000044, and 000066, may be advantageously used to promote or increased or enhance or boost phagocyte ADCC of diseased cells (e.g. cancer cells) as taught herein.\n\nIn the context of the present invention, the terms \"phagocyte cells\", \"phagocytic cells\" and \"phagocytes\" are used interchangeably herein to refer to cells that are capable of phagocytosis. Non-limiting examples of phagocytes include macrophages, mononuclear cells (e.g. histiocytes and monocytes), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (e.g. neutrophils), and dendritic cells, basophil, eosinophil, and others.\n\nThe term \"active agent (compounds as taught herein) capable of \"modulating or preventing or inhibiting or reducing the formation of a pyroglutamyl residue (pGlu) at the N-terminus of the CD47 protein expressed at the surface of a diseased cell\", and related terms, as used herein also refers to any compound, such as those described herein, capable of down-regulating or reducing or blocking or modulating the formation of a pGlu residue at the N-terminus of the CD47 protein expressed at the surface of a diseased cell, when said diseased cell is contacted or treated with said compound, and wherein the formation of a pGlu residue at the N-terminus of the CD47 protein expressed at the surface of a diseased cell is down-regulated or reduced or blocked by at least about 5% or up to about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or about 95% or more or up (preferably at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and more) compared to the level of the formation of a pGlu residue at the N-terminus of the CD47 protein expressed at the surface of a diseased cell, when said diseased cell is not contacted or treated with said compound. The formation of a pyroglutamyl residue (pGlu) at the N-terminus of the CD47 protein expressed at the surface of a diseased cell can be measured using standard methods, e.g. flow cytometry using an CD47 antibody capable of binding the pGlu residue on CD47 (e.g. antibody clone CC2C6, as taught herein). The term \"diseased cells\" as used herein refers to e.g. cancer cells or other diseased cells such as diseased vascular smooth muscle cells, diseased endothelial cells, diseased cells infected by a pathogen (e.g. virus), diseased cells undergoing fibrosis, expressing or overexpressing CD47 at their cell surface, and which are derived from- or are like diseased cells (e.g. cancer cell lines) derived from subjects suffering from a disease or condition involving the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis, such as e.g. cancer, atherosclerosis, fibrotic diseases as well as infectious diseases. The term \"glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase\" (abbreviated \"QPCT protein\" or \"QC protein\", also known as glutaminyl cyclase) as used herein refers to an enzyme (EC 2.3.2.5) that is encoded by the QPCT gene (NM_012413, in human), and which is found in a secreted form due to the absence of a membrane anchor in its sequence (i.e. not membrane bound). QPCT protein is abundantly expressed in neuroendocrine tissues (e.g. pituitary) and has been implicated in disease conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease. QPCT has also been found to be expressed, although to a lesser extent, in peripheral blood lymphocytes and other blood cells. QPCT has also been shown to be expressed by thyroid cancer cells (Kehlen et al (2013), Endocrine-Related Cancer, Vol. 20, pages 79-90) and melanoma cells (Gillis J. S. (2006) Journal of Translational Medicine, Vol. 4:27, page 1-7).\n\nThe term \"glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like\" (abbreviated \"QPCTL protein\" or \"QCL protein\", also known as \"iso-glutaminyl cyclase\") as used herein refers to the isoenzyme (i.e. enzyme that differs in amino acid sequence but catalyzes the same chemical reaction) form of QPCT (E.C. 2.3.2.5). QPCTL protein is encoded by the QPCTL gene (NM_017659, in human). QPCTL protein is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body but is particularly abundant in peripheral blood lymphocytes and other blood cells. QPCTL protein has also been shown to be expressed by cancer cells (Kehlen et al (2013), Endocrine-Related Cancer, Vol. 20, pages 79-90). In contrast to QPCT protein (which is secreted), QPCTL protein is exclusively localized within the Golgi complex (e.g. is Golgi bound and is not secreted within or outside the cell) due to the presence of a membrane anchor in its sequence. QPCTL (a protein of 382 amino acid) shares 46% (DNA) sequence identity with QPCT protein and exhibits nearly identical enzymatic activity in vitro, i.e. both proteins are responsible for posttranslational modifications consisting of catalyzing the formation of pyroglutamyl (or pyroglutamate (pE or pGlu)) residues at the N-terminus portion of several peptides/ proteins (Cynis et al (2008), J, Mol Biol, Vol. 379, pages 966-89; Stephan et al (2009), FEBS Journal, Vol. 276, pages 6522-36). The term \"reducing the expression or enzymatic activity of QPCTL, QPCT, or combinations thereof in the cell with CD47 expressed on its surface\" is understood to include reducing transcription and/or translation of the gene(s) encoding QPCTL, QPCT, or combinations thereof, as taught herein.\n\nThe term \"CD47 inhibitor\" as used herein refers to any active agents or compounds capable of binding to CD47 expressed on the surface of a cell (e.g. a diseased cell such as a cancer cell) so as to hinder or prohibit the binding of CD47 to SIRPa, thereby reducing or preventing the binding of CD47 to SIRPa expressed on the surface of another cell (e.g. a macrophage). In the context of the present invention, non-limiting examples of CD47 inhibitors include anti-CD47 antibodies and SIRPa-based fusion proteins (e.g. Hu5F9-G4 (Forty Seven, Inc.); CC-90002 (Celgene); TTI-621 (Trillium Therapeutics Inc.); as well as others currently under development including Novimmune, NI-1701 (CD47-CD19 bispecific), NI-1801 (CD47-meso bispecific), Tioma Therapeutics anti-CD47, Surface oncology SRF231 anti-CD47. In some embodiments, the CD47 inhibitor is a CD47 IgA antibody.\n\nThe term \"SIRP alpha inhibitor\" (abbreviated as SIRPa or SIRPalpha) as used herein refers to any active agents or compounds capable of binding to SIRPa expressed on the surface of a cell (e.g. macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells) so as to hinder or prohibit the binding of SIRPa to CD47, thereby reducing or preventing the binding of SIRPa to CD47 expressed on the surface of another cell (e.g. a diseased cell such as a cancer cell). In the context of the present invention, non-limiting examples of SIRPa inhibitors include anti-SIRPa antibodies (e.g. OSE-172 from Ose Immunotherapeutics, Nantes, France); other non-limiting examples include recombinant human CD47Fc chimera (fusion)protein, which consists of an engineered CD47 protein coupled to a Fc domain (e.g. Trillium Therapeutics).\n\nThe \"Programmed Death-1 (PD-1)\" receptor as used herein refers to an immune-inhibitory receptor belonging to the CD28 family. PD-1 is expressed on previously activated T cells in vivo but also on myeloid cells, and binds to two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. The term \"PD-1\" as used herein includes human PD-1 (hPD-1), variants, isoforms, and species homologs of hPD-1 , and analogs having at least one common epitope with hPD-1. The complete hPD-1 sequence can be found under GENBANK Accession No. U64863. PD-1 is expressed on immune cells such as activated T cells (including effector T cells), B cells, myeloid cells, thymocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells (Suya Dai et al (2014) Cellular Immunology, Vol:290, pages 72-79; Gianchecchi et al (2013), Autoimmun. Rev. 12 (2013) 1091-1 100).\n\n\"Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1)\" as used herein refers to one of two cell surface glycoprotein ligands for PD-1 (the other being PD-L2) that down-regulates immune cell activation and cytokine secretion upon binding to PD-1. The term \"PD-L1\" as used herein includes human PD-L1 (hPD-L1), variants, isoforms, and species homologs of hPD-L1 , and analogs having at least one common epitope with hPD-L1. The complete hPD-L1 sequence can be found under GENBANK Accession No. Q9NZQ7. PD-L1 is expressed on a variety of cells including cells of hematopoietic lineage such as activated T cells, B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), mast cells, and macrophages. PD-L1 is also expressed on peripheral non-hematopoietic tissue such as heart cells, skeletal muscle cells, pancreatic islet cells, placenta cells, lung cells, hepatocytes, epithelium cells, kidney cells, mesenchymal stem cells, liver cells, and others (Suya Dai et al (2014) Cellular Immunology, Vol:290, pages 72-79).\n\nThe term \"PD-1/PD-L1 axis\" as used herein consists of the PD-1 receptor and its ligand PD-L1. The term \"PD-1/PD-L1 axis signaling\" is a way of communication between cells (cell signaling), for instance between a first cell expressing PD-1 and a second cell expressing PD-L1 , and which involves the release of a biochemical signal (e.g. release of proteins, lipids, ions, neurotransmitters, enzymes, gases, etc.), which in turn causes an effect (e.g. inhibition, activation, blockade, etc.) on one or both cells. An example of \"PD- 1/PD-L1 axis signaling\" is when PD-L1 expressed at the cell surface of a first cell (e.g. cancer cells or a cancer-infiltrating immune cells) binds to its receptor PD-1 expressed at the cell surface of a second cell (e.g. a T cell, such as an effector T cell). The binding of PD-L1 to its receptor PD-1 transmits an inhibitory signal to the T-cell which results in a decrease in T cell proliferation (e.g. effector T cells) as well as T cell activity (e.g. secretion of cytokines and chemokines as discussed herein; Wei F et al (2013) PNAS; Vol: 110, E2480-2489). Thus, one possible end result of PD-1/PD-L1 axis signaling is the dampening or inhibition of immune activity or function mediated by T cells (e.g. effector T cells). Such situation may be detrimental in the context of cancer. Further, it has been hypothesized that PD-1 may also mediate an anti-phagocytic signal on macrophages (Gordon et al (2017), Nature, Vol. 545, pages 495-499) and inhibition of the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis has been shown to enhance the anti-tumor effect of blockade of the PD-1 - PD-L1 axis (Manguso et al. (2017), Nature, Vol. 547, pages 413-418.\n\nThe term \"providing to the subject an active agent that reduces expression or enzymatic activity of QPCTL, QPCT, or combinations thereof in a cell with CD47 on the surface\" as used herein refers to providing said subject with an effective amount of said active agent. The term \"effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" as used herein refers to an amount of a given compound (e.g. an active agent and pharmaceutical composition thereof as taught herein) which is effective, at dosages and for a particular period of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result (e.g. treat cancer, e.g. reduction of tumor size or promoting or increasing phagocytosis of cancer cells expressing the CD47 protein, or treating atherosclerosis or fibrotic diseases or an infectious diseases caused by pathogens (e.g. virus)). A therapeutically effective amount of the pharmacological agent or compound (e.g. an active agent as taught herein) may vary according to factors such as the disease state, disease type, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the pharmacological agentto elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount of a given compound is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects (if any) of the pharmacological agent or compound (e.g. a compound as taught herein) are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.\n\nThe term \"test compound\" as used herein refers to a chemically defined molecule whose ability to: 1) reduce or inhibit or block the enzymatic activity of the QPCTL protein and/or QPCT protein or the expression of the QPCTL gene and/or QPCT gene in a cell, and/or 2) reduce or inhibiting or block or prevent the formation of a pyroglutamyl residue at the N-terminus of the CD47 protein expressed in a cell is assessed in an assay or method according to the invention. Test compounds include, but are not limited to drugs, ligands (natural or synthetic), polypeptides, peptides, peptide mimics, polysaccharides, saccharides, glycoproteins, nucleic acids, polynucleotides, antibodies, enzymatic inhibitors, and small organic molecules. The test compound may also be candidate drug or lead compound, a chemical intermediate, environmental pollutant, or a mixture of compounds. In one embodiment, the test compound may be comprised within an existing library of compounds. In another embodiment, test compounds may be comprised within a novel library of compounds. In other words, the test compound(s) may be a known compound(s) or an unknown (novel) compound(s). In an embodiment, the test compound may be any of the active agents (capable of reducing the expression or the enzymatic activity of QPCT and/or QPCTL) and pharmaceutical compositions thereof as taught herein, e.g. compounds selected from Tables A, B, C, D and/or E, e.g. PBD150, PQ912 and PQ1565, and compounds 000051 , 000054, 00016, 000034, 000035, 000037, 000055, 000024, 000027, 000050, 000020, 000021 , 000022, 000023, 000025, 000010, 000026, 00001 1 , 000036, 000029, 000048, 000049, 000012, 000030, 000031 , 000013, 000014, 000032, 000052, 000053, 000064, 000044, or 000066, as taught herein. Such compounds may also be referred to as \"reference compound\".\n\nThe term \"reference compound\" as used herein refers to a compound which is known (a priori) to: 1) reduce or inhibit or block the enzymatic activity of the QPCTL and/or QPCT protein or the expression of the QPCTL and/or QPCT, and/or 2) reduce or inhibit or prevent or block the formation of a pyroglutamyl residue at the N-terminus of the CD47 protein. Such reference compounds may be useful to validate and/or optimize the method as taught herein for the purpose of finding or detecting or screening for new (not a priori known for) compound(s) capable of: 1) reducing or inhibiting the enzymatic activity of the QPCTL and/or QPCT protein or the expression of the QPCTL and/or QPCT gene in a cell, and/or 2) reducing or inhibiting the formation of a pyroglutamyl residue at the N-terminus of the CD47 protein expressed in a cell. CD47\n\nThe term \"Cluster of Differentiation 47\" (abbreviated as \"CD47\") as used herein refers to a 50 kDa transmembrane protein (receptor) encoded by the CD47 gene (Ensembl reference: ENSG00000196776 in human). CD47 is also known as integrin associated protein (IAP). CD47 belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and is characterized by the presence of an extracellular N-terminal IgV domain, five transmembrane domains, and a short C-terminal intracellular tail. CD47 is expressed by all normal/healthy mammalian (e.g. human, mouse, rat, etc.) tissues and cells (e.g. red blood cells such as erythrocyte cells), as revealed by CD47 mRNA expression and CD47 immunohistochemical staining studies (Wiersma et al (2015), Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology, Vol. 19, pages 417-431 ; Lindberg et al (1993), Journal of Cell Biology, vol. 123, pages 485-496).\n\nCD47 has also been found to be expressed in several cancer types, such as e.g. leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), ovarian cancer, gliomas, colon cancer, breast cancer, leiomyosarcoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, HNSCC, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, T-ALL, glioma, mesothelioma, glioblastoma, melanoma, NSCLC, and others (Chao et al (2012), Current Opinion Immunol., Vol.24, pages 225-3; Matlung et al. (2017), Immunol Rev. Vol.276, pages145-164).\n\nIt was reported that cancer cells upregulate the expression of (or overexpress) CD47 at their cell surface, which results in CD47 levels which are higher compared to CD47 levels found in normal cells (which are relatively low) (Majeti et al (2009), Cell, Vol.138, pages 286-99; Chao et al (2012), Curr Opin Immunol, Vol.24, pages 225-32). Overexpression of CD47 in cancer was first found in ovarian cancer in the 1980s (Poels et al (1986), J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Vol.76, pages 781-91). In the context of the present invention, the term \"overexpression of CD47\" in a diseased cell (e.g. cancer cells but also diseased vascular smooth muscle cells, diseased endothelial cells, diseased cells infected by a pathogen (e.g. virus), diseased cells in tissues undergoing fibrosis, can also express anti-phagocytic signals such as CD47) refers to CD47 levels in said cell, which are higher than the CD47 levels found in a normal cells (e.g. non-diseased or healthy cell of the same cellular type) such as 1.5-fold higher, 2.0-fold higher, 2.5-fold higher, 3-fold higher or more.\n\nSIRPa\n\nThe term \"signal-regulatory protein alpha (abbreviated \"SIRPa\" or \"SIRP a\", also termed CD172a or SHPS-1) as used herein refers to a regulatory transmembrane glycoprotein from the SIRP family, which is encoded by the SIRPa gene (Ensembl reference: ENSG00000198053 in human). SIRPa is characterized by the presence of three extracellular Ig-like domains, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular tail containing four immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) (Barclay and Van den Berg (2014), Annu Rev Immunol, Vol. 32, pages 25-50). The SIRP family comprises 3 members, namely SIRPa, SIRPp and SIRPy, which are closely related in terms of sequence and overall structure but have different activity. X-ray crystallography studies have shown that despite sequence and domain similarities, SIRPa, SIRPp and SIRPy differ in their abilities to bind to CD47. While SIRPa binds to CD47 with reasonably high affinity, binding of SIRPp and SIRPy to CD47 is negligible or not possible because of differences in the three dimensional structure (e.g., loops) of the protein (Hatherley et al (2008), Molecular cell, Vol. 31 , pages 266-77).\n\nSIRPa is mainly expressed by myeloid cells (e.g. macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells), neurons, and (in vitro) cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (Matozaki et al (2009), Trends Cell Biol., Vol.19 (2), pages 72-80; and Dubois et al (2011), Nature Biotechnology, Vol. 29, pages 101 1-1018). SIRPa acts as inhibitory receptor by interacting with or binding to CD47, i.e. as part of the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis, as described herein. This interaction leads to inhibition of cell killing by immune cells, such as inhibition of cell killing through phagocytosis of cells expressing CD47 at their cell surface (e.g. cancer cells positive for CD47) by immune cells such as phagocytes (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils), and also inhibition of killing through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of cells expressing CD47 at their cell surface, as explained herein.\n\nCD47-SIRPa Signaling Axis\n\nThe term \"CD47-SIRPa signaling system or axis or pathway\" as used herein refers to a signaling axis or system characterized by the interaction or binding between CD47 expressed on the cell surface of one cell (e.g. expressed at the cell surface of a diseased cell such as a cancer cell) and SIRPa expressed on the cell surface of another/different cell (e.g. expressed at the cell surface of an immune cell such as a phagocyte (e.g. macrophage, neutrophil) and includes the molecular (e.g. phosphorylation events, gene and protein expression, recruitment, transport, etc.) and physiological responses (e.g. generation of a \"don't eat me signal\" resulting in the inhibition of phagocytosis, ADCC and ADCP, e.g. CD47 positive cells engaged into CD47-SIRPa signaling will evade phagocytosis by an immune cell such as a macrophage and/or cell death via ADCC derived from or triggered by this interaction.\n\nCD47 has several binding ligands including the signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa). Depending on its binding ligand as well as its expression pattern (e.g. level of expression, location), CD47 plays various biological roles including in apoptosis, proliferation, adhesion, migration as well as angiogenic and immune responses.\n\nOne prominent role of CD47 is to control phagocytic activity through its interaction or binding with SIRPa. When CD47 interacts or binds with SIRPa (CD47-SIRPa interaction), it initiates a cascade of signaling events in the cells (i.e. the cell expressing CD47 and the cell expressing SIRPa). Specifically, CD47-SIRPa interaction causes tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRPa cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) motifs, which in turn leads to concomitant activation or recruitment of Src homology 2 domain tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1 ) and Src homology 2 domain tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2). SHP-1 and SHP-2 are cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatases, which mediate signaling events causing inhibition of phagocytosis by for instance dephosphorylating myosin-IIA (Wiersma et al (2015), Atlas of Genetics and Cytogenetics in Oncology and Haematology, Vol. 19, pages 417-431). Myosin-IIA is an important feature of the actin-myosin contractile system, which mediates the engulfment of material (e.g. cell to be eliminated) by phagocytes (e.g. macrophage, neutrophil) during phagocytosis.\n\nTherefore, for these reasons (i.e. because it triggers a cascade of signaling events leading to inhibition of phagocytosis by binding or interacting with SIRPa), CD47 is often referred to as a \"don't eat me signal\" or \"anti-phagocytic signal\". In addition, the binding of CD47 to SIRPa can also inhibit death of CD47 expressing cells by other mechanisms, such as ADCC. In all CD47-SIRPa interaction-dependent mechanisms of cell death, inhibition of this interaction may be exploited to enhance death of the CD47 expressing cells.\n\nUnder normal conditions, the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis serves an important role in preventing removal of healthy/normal cells expressing CD47 (e.g. healthy red blood cells or erythrocytes). On the other hand, (naturally-occurring) down-regulation of CD47 on damaged, aged and superfluous cells (e.g. old red blood cells) ensures their timely removal from the body.\n\nUnder pathological situations, such as in the context of cancer, the CD47-SIRPa signaling system or axis may be used by cancer cells (e.g. cancer cells positive for CD47 or expressing CD47 at their cell surface) to evade immune surveillance, e.g. to escape phagocytosis by immune cells such as macrophages. As discussed earlier, it was shown that as a result of expressing or overexpressing CD47, cancer cells can evade destruction by the immune system or evade immune surveillance (e.g. evading phagocytosis) by activating the CD47-SIRPa signaling system or axis (i.e. through interaction or binding between CD47 and SIRPa) (Oldenborg et al (2000) Science, Vol. 288, pages 2051-2054; Jaiswal et al (2009) Cell, Vol.138, pages 271-285). Overall, it was found that expression (increased expression or overexpression) of CD47 in several cancers, e.g. leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), ovarian cancer, gliomas, colon cancer, breast cancer, leiomyosarcoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, HNSCC, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, T-ALL, glioma, mesothelioma, glioblastoma, melanoma, NSCLC, and others, was associated with worse clinical prognosis and greater chances of refractoriness (no response) to chemotherapies (Majeti et al (2009), Cell, Vol.138, pages 286-99).\n\nRole of the CD47-SIRPa Signaling Axis in Cancer and other Conditions\n\nCancer cells are able to evade immune surveillance in many ways, for instance by evading phagocytosis by phagocyte cells (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils) through the expression of so-called \"anti-phagocytic\" or \"don't eat me\" signals. One prominent signal is the transmembrane protein \"cluster of differentiation 47\" (abbreviated as \"CD47\"). CD47 is also known as integrin associated protein (IAP). CD47 is expressed by virtually all cells in the body, e.g. blood cells such as erythrocyte cells, and is involved in a range of cellular processes, including apoptosis, proliferation, adhesion, and migration as well as angiogenic and immune responses. CD47 binds or interact with several ligands including the signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa), thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1 ) and membrane integrins (e.g. Î±Î½Î²3 integrin, Î±2Î²Î¯ integrin), with SIRPa being considered as a main ligand for CD47. SIRPa is an inhibitory transmembrane receptor present on myeloid cells such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes, and dendritic cells.\n\nThe interaction or binding between CD47 and SIRPa has been widely studied because it mediates or conveys \"anti-phagocytic\" or \"don't eat me\" signals between two cells, e.g. a cancer cell and a phagocyte cell (e.g. macrophage), which ultimately inhibit phagocytosis (i.e. the cells positive or expressing CD47 at their cell surface (e.g. red blood cell) will not undergo phagocytosis or will be less prone to phagocytosis by phagocyte cells expressing SIRPa (e.g. macrophages). For this reason, CD47 is often referred to as a \"don't eat me signal\" and a marker of self, as loss of CD47 leads to homeostatic phagocytosis of aged or damaged cells. Expression of CD47 in normal/healthy cells serves to maintain tissue homeostasis (e.g. to prevent immune attacks against tissues or cells that are constituents of the \"self\" (e.g. prevent auto-immunity) and to rid the body of old or defective cells or foreign cells.\n\nHowever, CD47 expression is not limited to normal/healthy cells. Specifically, diseased cells (such as cancer cells, diseased vascular smooth muscle cells, diseased endothelial cells, diseased cells infected by a pathogen (e.g. virus), or diseased cells undergoing fibrosis) can also express anti-phagocytic signals such as CD47, and thus can convey a \"do not eat me signal\" or \"anti-phagocytic signal\".\n\nIn the case of cancer, cancer cells upregulate the expression of CD47 at their cell surface compared to the CD47 levels found in normal/healthy cells (which are relatively low) (Majeti et al (2009), Cell, Vol.138, pages 286-99; Chao et al (2012), Curr Opin Immunol, Vol.24, pages 225-32). As a result of having their CD47 expression, cancer cells can evade destruction by the immune system or evade immune surveillance, e.g. by evading phagocytosis by immune cells such as phagocyte cells (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils) (Oldenborg et al (2000) Science, Vol. 288, pages 2051-2054; Jaiswal et al (2009) Cell, Vol.138, pages 271-285). Overall, increased expression (or overexpression) of CD47 in several cancers (e.g. hematologic cancers or blood cancers such as leukemia) is associated with worse clinical prognosis and greater chances of refractoriness (no response) to chemotherapies (Majeti et al (2009), Cell, Vol.138, pages 286-99). Expression of CD47 in cancer was first found in ovarian cancer in the 1980s (Poels et al (1986), J. Natl. Cancer Inst. Vol. 76, pages 781-91). Since then, a large body of evidence has been gathered documenting the expression of CD47 as well as the involvement of the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis in many cancers including e.g. leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), ovarian cancer, gliomas, colon cancer, breast cancer, leiomyosarcoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, HNSCC, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, T-ALL, glioma, mesothelioma, glioblastoma, melanoma, NSCLC, and others (Matlung et al. (2017), Immunol Rev. Vol.276, pages145-164.)\n\nDiseased cells in conditions other than cancer, such as e.g. atherosclerosis, fibrotic diseases as well as infectious diseases caused by pathogens (e.g. virus), also upregulate the expression of CD47 at their cell surface compared to the CD47 levels found in normal/healthy cells to evade phagocytosis by phagocytes (Kojima et al (2016) Nature, Vol. 536, pages 86-90; Wernig et al (2017) PNAS, Vol.1 14, pages 4757-4762; and WO2014124028).\n\nThese results have prompted increasing interest in using the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis as a clinical target not only for cancer immunotherapy but also other conditions such as atherosclerosis, fibrotic diseases as well as infectious diseases caused by pathogens (e.g. virus).\n\nIn the case of cancer, current approaches to antagonize the CD47-SIRPa interactions in cancer have principally targeted CD47 (Chao et al (201 1), Cancer Res., Vol. 71 , pages 1374-84). For instance, several anti-CD47 antibodies aimed at interfering or blocking CD47-SIRPa interactions are currently being developed or tested in clinical trials. The anti- CD47 monoclonal antibody (mAb) B6H12 has shown pre-clinical efficacy in several hematologic malignancies and solid tumor models through its ability to block SIRPa binding to CD47 (Chao et al (201 1) Cancer Res. Vol. 71 , pages 1374-1384; Edris et al (2012) PNAS, Vol. 109, pages 6656-6661 ; Willingham et al (2012) PNAS, Vol. 109, pages 6662-6667). Other non-limiting examples of anti-CD47 antibodies and SIRPa-based protein therapeutics being developed or being considered for clinical applications include Hu5F9-G4 (Forty Seven, Inc.) for the treatment of solid tumors and advanced colorectal cancer, CC-90002 (Celgene) for the treatment of AML as well as advanced solid and hematologic cancers, and the SIRPa-FC fusion protein TTI-621 (Trillium Therapeutics Inc.) for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Other non-limiting examples being developed (in preclinical stage) include Novimmune, NI-1701 (CD47-CD19 bispecific), Nl- 1801 (CD47-meso bispecific), Tioma Therapeutics anti-CD47, Surface oncology SRF231 anti-CD47, OSE immunotherapeutics Effi-DEM anti-SIRPct. Another non-limiting example of anti-CD47 compound is ALX148 (Alexo Therapeutics, Inc., an engineered protein coupled to a Fc domain) for the treatment of solid tumors and lymphoma. Other approaches consist of the use of agents such as anti-SIRPa antibodies (Sarfati et al (2008), Curr Drug Targets, Vol.9, pages 842-50, Zao et al (2011) PNAS, Vol. 108, pages 18342-18347).\n\nAlthough promising, such strategies are not optimal since antibodies are known to have poor tissue penetration, especially into solid tumors due to their large molecular weight. Further, such antibodies, particularly antibodies targeting CD47 lack specificity since CD47 is widely distributed throughout the body, including healthy tissue, which may cause on-target toxicity to normal cells (Ho et al (2015), J. Biol. Chem, Vol. 290, pages 12650- 12663).\n\nOther disadvantages associated with the use of anti-CD47 antibodies include the lack of oral bioavailability and undesirable side effects such as the development of anemia (which may occur as a result of a dose-dependent loss of red blood cells and platelets) as well as hemagglutination (clumping of red blood cells). For instance, such undesirable side effects were observed during clinical trials led by Forty Seven, Inc. Specifically, a humanized monoclonal anti-CD47 antibody (Hu5F9-G4) was administered to patients with diverse (advanced) solid tumors. It was observed that patients who received the highest dose of the anti-CD47 antibody (Hu5F9-G4, 3 mg/'kg) experienced toxicity including abdominal pain, red blood cell hemagglutination and headache (Sikic et al (20 6), J Clin. Oncol, , Vol. 34).\n\nThe disadvantages associated with the use of anti-CD47 antibodies in the context of cancer therapy, as discussed above, will also manifest in other therapies where the use of anti-CD47 antibodies may be indicated such as for instance in the treatment of atherosclerosis, fibrotic diseases as well as infectious diseases caused by pathogens (e.g. virus) (Kojima et al (2016) Nature, Vol. 536, pages 86-90; Wernig et al (2017) PNAS, Vol.1 14, pages 4757-4762; and WO2014124028).\n\nTherefore there is a need for CD47-targeting therapies that do not cause significant levels toxicity, and/or platelet depletion and/or hemagglutination (clumping of red blood cells together) and/or red blood cell depletion, and/or anemia when administered to a subject and/ or that have the potential of oral bioavailability. Further, there is also a need for additional, adjuvant, alternative, or improved strategies including compounds and pharmaceutical compositions, use of such compounds and pharmacological compositions, and/or methods, which are devoid of at least some of the limitations and which confer the following advantages or uses: 1) Blocking or reducing or inhibiting the activity of the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis, particularly in conditions or diseases involving CD47-SIRPa signaling axis (i.e. where diseased cells use the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis to evade or escape killing by immune cells, such as phagocytosis by phagocytes); and/or 2) Blocking or reducing or inhibiting the interaction or binding between CD47 and SIRPa, particularly in conditions or diseases involving CD47-SIRPa signaling axis; and/or\n\n3) Treating subjects suffering from a disease or condition involving the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis, such as e.g. cancer, atherosclerosis, fibrotic diseases as well as infectious diseases; and/or\n\n4) Modulating (e.g. boosting or increasing) immune cell-mediated killing (e.g. via phagocytosis or via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or via antibody- dependent cellular phagocytosis\" (abbreviated ADCP) of diseased cells (e.g. cancer cells or other diseased cells such as diseased vascular smooth muscle cells, diseased endothelial cells, diseased cells infected by a pathogen (e.g. virus), diseased cells undergoing fibrosis) expressing or overexpressing CD47 at their cell surface by phagocytes (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils) in subjects suffering from a disease or condition involving the CD47-SIRPa signaling axis, such as e.g. cancer, atherosclerosis, fibrotic diseases as well as infectious diseases. In some embodiments, the \"modulating (e.g. boosting or up-regulating or increasing) of the killing of a diseased cell (e.g. cancer cells) via ADCP or ADCC (using compounds as taught herein) involves or uses IgA antibodies (e.g. anti-Her2-lgA1 antibody or anti-CD47-lgA antibody, and others); and/or\n\n5) Complementing or enhancing the effects of a therapeutic treatment (monotherapy) with a first active agent (e.g. drug), e.g. anti-CD47 antibody (e.g. an anti-CD47 IgA antibody) or an anti-SIRPa antibody or other active agents including for instance anti- CD20 antibody, anti-PD-L1 antibody, anti-Her2 antibody, anti-EGFR antibody, anti-CD20- CD47 bispecific antibody, anti-CD56 antibody, anti-TRP-1-PD-L1 bispecific antibody, and anti-CD271-sporin antibody. In some embodiments, the first active agent is an IgA antibody; and/or 6) Complementing or enhancing the effects of a therapeutic treatment consisting of a combination of two active agents (i.e. combination therapy), where the first active agent (e.g. drug) is"
