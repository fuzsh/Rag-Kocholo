UEFA competition finals veteran Jose Mourinho has set his team Roma's sights on their maiden UEFA Europa League trophy.

To date, the Portuguese head coach has clinched all five of the UEFA competition finals he reached.

He won the 2003 UEFA Cup (rebranded UEFA Europa League in 2009) and the 2004 UEFA Champions League title with Portuguese club Porto, guided Italian side Inter Milan to 2010 Champions League success, and bagged the 2017 Europa League trophy with England's Manchester United before clinching the UEFA Europa Conference League trophy with Roma in 2022.

He is the only manager to win all three major UEFA club football trophies: the Champions League, Europa League, and Europa Conference League.

As for his current team, Roma have now reached the UEFA Cup/Europa League final for the first time in 32 years.

In 1991, they lost to Inter Milan 2-1 on aggregate in the UEFA Cup final, which was held in two legs.

The 2022 Europa Conference League win was Roma's first-ever UEFA trophy.

Europa League record-holders Sevilla

The other Europa League finalist, Sevilla, are the most successful club in the competitionâ€™s history.

The Spanish side, which won the trophy in 2006, 2007, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2020, will fight for their seventh championship.

Tournament mainstay Sevilla have won all the UEFA Cup/Europa League finals they competed in.

Sevilla's Spanish coach Jose Luis Mendilibar, with no major title wins under his belt, will be looking for a major triumph in the upcoming final at Puskas Arena in Budapest on Wednesday evening.

The Sevilla vs. Roma final will kick off at 1900GMT.
