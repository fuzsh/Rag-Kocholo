        "text": "The brilliant 2-1 victory against favourites Barcelona in Rotterdam on 15 May 1991 secured the club's first continental silverware since Sir Matt Busby's legendary side famously won the European Cup in 1968.\n\nFive-and-a-half years into Sir Alex Ferguson's tenure, it was a significant feat for the Scot, who had ended a worryingly barren start to life as the United boss by lifting the FA Cup in the previous May.\n\n\"It was a major step forward, there's no doubt about that,\" the legendary manager acknowledged, when asked to reflect on the Cup Winners' Cup success many years later in Inside United.\n\n“Sharpey [Lee Sharpe] was coming through, so was Giggsy [Ryan Giggs]. We had Sparky [Mark Hughes] and Choccy [Brian McClair], [Paul] Ince and [Bryan] Robson and, soon after, we bought Paul Parker, Andrei Kanchelskis and Peter Schmeichel.\n\n“They were key signings that gave us a really strong group.”\n\nAs the former United manager recalled, the final in the Netherlands was something of a battle.\n\n\"The way Barcelona set up tactically in the final made things very difficult for us in the first half. They played two wide players and no centre-forward, and crowded the midfield.\n\n\"Once we got organised at half-time, we were the better team in the second half and it was a fantastic night for us.\"\n\nFew pundits had backed United to beat Johan Cruyff's much-vaunted side but Reds striker Mark Hughes was a man on a mission, following his short-lived and unsuccessful stay at Camp Nou.\n\nAfter a goalless 66 minutes, the Welshman claimed a close-range opener from Steve Bruce's header.\n\nSeven minutes later, the fired-up Sparky produced a decisive demonstration of his shooting power as he burst through and, although forced wide by keeper Carles Busquets, his blockbuster finish still found the net."
