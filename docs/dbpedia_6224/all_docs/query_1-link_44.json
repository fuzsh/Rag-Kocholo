        "text": "Karl Matchett@ @karlmatchettFeatured Columnist\n\nAtletico Madrid, Real Madrid and All 20 Same-Country European Football Finals\n\n0 of 20\n\nDenis Doyle/Getty Images\n\nThe city of Madrid is eagerly anticipating the final of the 2014 UEFA Champions League, after Atletico clinically dispatched of Chelsea in the semi-finals one day after Real did the same to Bayern Munich.\n\nIt will be the first time in the long history of the European Cup/Champions League that two clubs from the same city have contested the final—but it's the 20th occasion that two teams from the same country meet to challenge for continental honours.\n\nHere are all the previous such occurrences, taking in four different competitions: the Champions League, the UEFA Cup/Europa League, the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the UEFA Super Cup.\n\n*There were no same-country finals in the Cup Winners' Cup, which ran from 1961 to 1999.\n\nReal Madrid vs. Atletico Madrid, Champions League 2014\n\n1 of 20\n\nClive Rose/Getty Images\n\nNeither Real nor Atleti won Spain's top flight last season, but they look set to be numbers one and two both at home and in Europe this year.\n\nReal finished top of Group B before seeing off all three German sides: Schalke 04, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich.\n\nAtletico were top of Group G and knocked out AC Milan, Barcelona and Chelsea en route to the final.\n\nThe final itself is set to be held in Lisbon, Portugal on May 24.\n\nReal Madrid vs. Valencia, Champions League 2000\n\n2 of 20\n\nGraham Chadwick/Getty Images\n\nThe first ever European Cup/Champions League final to feature two clubs from the same country also featured Real Madrid and only occurred 14 years ago.\n\nReal Madrid beat Valencia 3-0 in the final, with Steve McManaman, Raul and Fernando Morientes all on the scoresheet.\n\nValencia also contested and lost the next year's final, too.\n\nAC Milan vs. Juventus, Champions League 2003\n\n3 of 20\n\nAlex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nOne of the less-memorable Champions League finals of the past couple of decades was the all-Italian affair at Old Trafford in 2003, when AC Milan beat Juventus on penalties.\n\nWith Pavel Nedved missing through suspension, the game lacked any real invention or excitement, with both sides settling for a 0-0 draw and the shootout the shootout.\n\nAfter Juve had missed three of their five kicks, Andriy Shevchenko scored the final spot-kick to help Milan win 3-2.\n\nManchester United vs. Chelsea, Champions League 2008\n\n4 of 20\n\nAlex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nThe mid-to-late 2000s saw English clubs dominate the latter stages of the Champions League, but only once did it result in a same-nation final.\n\nChelsea and Manchester United also went to penalties. Chelsea captain John Terry slipped and missed his chance to win the shootout for his side, before Manchester United came back to win 6-5 in sudden death.\n\nThe match had ended 1-1 after 90 minutes and extra time.\n\nBayern Munich vs. Borussia Dortmund, Champions League Final 2013\n\n5 of 20\n\nAlex Grimm/Getty Images\n\nLast season's Champions League final saw two German sides, Bayern and Dortmund, play at Wembley.\n\nBoth had been the standout teams in the competition for their fast and aggressive styles of play.The game looked as though it would end 1-1 as it moved into the final minutes.\n\nHowever, Arjen Robben scored in the 89th minute to gift the cup to Bayern.\n\nTottenham Hotspur vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers, UEFA Cup 1972\n\n6 of 20\n\nTony Duffy/Getty Images\n\nThe first-ever UEFA Cup final was played between two English sides, with Tottenham emerging triumphant over two legs.\n\nThey won the first leg 2-1 at Wolves, with a 1-1 draw at home enough to claim the trophy on aggregate.\n\nMartin Chivers, pictured, was the Spurs hero who netted both goals at Molineux.\n\nEintracht Frankfurt vs. Borussia Monchengladbach, UEFA Cup 1980\n\n7 of 20\n\nStill as a two-legged tie, the UEFA Cup was fought out between Frankfurt and 'Gladbach in 1980, with plenty of late drama in both fixtures.\n\nThe first leg was 1-1 with 20 minutes to play, before a spate of goals saw the game end 3-2 to 'Gladbach.\n\nAn 81st minute strike in the second leg from substitute Fred Schaub—who had only been on the pitch for four minutes—won the cup for Frankfurt on away goals.\n\nJuventus vs. Fiorentina, UEFA Cup 1990\n\n8 of 20\n\nSimon Bruty/Getty Images\n\nTen years after the all-German final, Italy began a run which saw teams from the country contest almost every final for a full decade.\n\nIn 1990, Juventus saw off Fiorentina 3-1 in the first leg, with Pierluigi Casiraghi—pictured—scoring the all-important second goal, before a 0-0 draw in Avellino in the return fixture.\n\nJuve finished a full nine places and 16 points above Fiorentina in that season's Serie A table.\n\nInter Milan vs. Roma, UEFA Cup 1991\n\n9 of 20\n\nShaun Botterill/Getty Images\n\nA year later, two more Italian sides played off. This time, Internazionale beat AS Roma by a 2-1 aggregate scoreline.\n\nLothar Matthaus' penalty and another goal from Nicola Berti gave Inter a commanding lead that meant Ruggiero Rizzitelli's late goal in the second leg wasn't enough for a comeback.\n\nIt marked a third successive year in which the UEFA Cup was won by a Serie A team.\n\nParma vs. Juventus, UEFA Cup 1995\n\n10 of 20\n\nLUCA BRUNO/Associated Press\n\nIt was all Italy again in '95, with Parma and Juventus contesting one of the last two-legged finals before they were discontinued after 1997.\n\nDino Baggio was Parma's big hero, scoring the only goal of the first leg and then adding another in the second leg to equalise on the night and give Parma an aggregate 2-1 victory.\n\nGianluca Vialli scored Juve's sole strike of the final.\n\nInter Milan vs. Lazio, UEFA Cup 1998\n\n11 of 20\n\nLUCA BRUNO/Associated Press\n\nThe first UEFA Cup final to be held as a single fixture was yet another all-Italian occasion.\n\nIt also remains the last time either of these two clubs reached the final of the UEFA Cup, and only one other Italian side has done so since: Parma in 1999.\n\nInter ran out comfortable 3-0 winners on this occasion, with their South American contingent of Ivan Zamorano, Ronaldo and Javier Zanetti scoring the goals.\n\nSevilla vs. Espanyol, UEFA Cup 2007\n\n12 of 20\n\nMANU FERNANDEZ/Associated Press\n\nIt was almost a decade before the next same-nation final, when Sevilla and Espanyol met in 2007.\n\nSevilla had won the previous year's final, and they retained their trophy with a penalty shootout victory over their opponents.\n\nThe 90 minutes finished 1-1, extra time ended 2-2 and Espanyol missed three of their four spot kicks, which allowed Sevilla to claim a 3-1 win.\n\nPorto vs. Braga, Europa League 2011\n\n13 of 20\n\nArmando Franca/Associated Press\n\nBy the time the next same-nation meeting occurred, the UEFA Cup had become the Europa League and Portuguese sides Porto and Braga met in the final.\n\nBraga knocked out fellow Portuguese side Benfica in the semi-finals, as the Iberian nation—nations, technically, as Villarreal were the other semi-finalist—dominated the last four line up.\n\nRadamel Falcao scored the only goal of the final to give Porto a 1-0 win.\n\nAtletico Madrid vs. Athletic Bilbao, Europa League 2012\n\n14 of 20\n\nDarko Vojinovic/Associated Press\n\nTwo years ago, this season's Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid were competing in the final of the Europa League against compatriots Athletic Bilbao.\n\nA terrific final ended 3-0 to Atleti, with Falcao netting twice in the first half to score in successive Europa League finals for two different teams.\n\nDiego also scored late on to wrap up the win for a team on the rise.\n\nValencia vs. Barcelona, Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1962\n\n15 of 20\n\nBefore the organised \"second\" competition in the form of the UEFA Cup was launched, clubs competed in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, with no initial qualification via league performance necessary.\n\nThe first same-nation final was contested between Spanish sides Valencia and Barcelona, with the former triumphing 7-3 on aggregate thanks to a hefty 6-2 win in their home leg.\n\nWith no footage or images of the final available, this video is actually of the final two years previous, when Barcelona emerged triumphant over Birmingham City.\n\nReal Zaragoza vs. Valencia, Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1964\n\n16 of 20\n\nThe '64 version of the final was played over a single game instead of two legs, with the Spanish dominance of the competition continuing.\n\nReal Zaragoza beat Valencia 2-1 in the final, the fifth time in six years of the competition where a Spanish side lifted the trophy.\n\nThis time the video is for the following year's final—Ferencvaros beat Juventus 1-0.\n\nBarcelona vs. Real Zaragoza, Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1966\n\n17 of 20\n\nAC Milan vs. Sampdoria, UEFA Super Cup 1990\n\n18 of 20\n\nBefore it was abolished in 1999, however, the place of the UEFA Cup/Europa League winner was filled by the winner of that year's Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nAC Milan beat Sampdoria 3-1 on aggregate in 1990, 1-1 in the first leg and 2-0 in the second.\n\nDutch duo Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit were the scorers in the telling second fixture.\n\nParma vs. AC Milan, UEFA Super Cup 1993\n\n19 of 20\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nMilan were back in the final three years later, again against Italian opposition, but they fell this time to a 2-1 aggregate defeat.\n\nParma were the victors despite losing the first leg 1-0, as Nestor Sensini's second-leg goal sent the tie to extra time. Massimo Crippa scored just a few minutes after the restart, with Nevio Scala's side holding on to emerge triumphant.\n\nSevilla vs. Barcelona, UEFA Super Cup 2006\n\n20 of 20\n\nCLAUDE PARIS/Associated Press\n\nThe last Super Cup to date to feature two teams from the same country came in 2006.\n\nSpain had seen Sevilla win the UEFA Cup and Barcelona lift the Champions League, but it was a surprise victory for the Andalucian team in the Super Cup.\n\nThey defeated Barca 3-0 with goals from Renato, Freddy Kanoute and Enzo Maresca to lift another title.\n\nFollow @karlmatchett\n\nX"
