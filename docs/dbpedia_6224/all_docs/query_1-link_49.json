        "text": "Inter Milan, a two-time winner of the event, lost on Tuesday but still managed to join Schalke of Germany in advancing to the UEFA Cup final. Playing at Monaco, Inter Milan reached the UEFA Cup finals for the third time in six years despite suffering a 1-0 second-leg semifinal defeat to AS Monaco.\n\nInter Milan had won the first-leg match 3-1 in Milan and moved on with a 3-2 edge in aggregate score. Schalke notched its biggest success in team history with a 2-0 triumph over CD Tenerife in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. The victory overcame a 1-0 loss earlier at Tenerife and allowed the Germans to move on by a 2-1 aggregate over the Spanish side. At Monaco, Victor Ikpeba's 69th-minute goal was not enough for French side AS Monaco, to the disappointment of a crowd of 18,500. The Italians maintained a perfect record in UEFA Cup finals, having won the trophy in both previous appearances 1991 and 1994. Italian teams have won the UEFA Cup in six of the last eight years. Monaco had a seventh-minute goal from Martin Djetou disallowed because Marco Grassi was called for a foul for taking down defender Inter Milan defender Giuseppe Bergomi. Inter Milan goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca produced several brilliant saves to preserve the aggregate lead, most notably against Sylvain Legwinski's header in the 26th minute of play. Monaco also nearly got a second goal in the 62nd minute but an apparent goal by substitute Thierry Henry was disallowed by Dutch referee Mario van der Ende, who called the hosts for offsides. At Gelsenkirchen, Germany, Schalke got goals from Thomas Linke in the 68th minute and Marc Wilmots in the 107th minute to turn back the defensive-minded Spaniards before a sellout crowd of 56,824."
