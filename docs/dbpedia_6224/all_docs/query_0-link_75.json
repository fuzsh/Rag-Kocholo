        "text": "Roma’s whole story is wrapped round the European Cup, from the defeat on penalties to Liverpool in the 1984 final at the Stadio Olimpico to the need now to be Champions League heavyweights to fund the club’s transformation.\n\nWith a billionaire Bostonian owner, James Pallotta, and plans for their own stadium in 2021, Roma are locked in combat both with the ghosts of 34 years ago and Italy’s bigger names: Juventus, Napoli, and the two Milans. \"It was like discovering Santa doesn't exist,” says Luca d’Alessandro a director of the Voce Giallorossa website and Roma scout, of the 1984 defeat, from which captain Agostino Di Bartolomei’s descent towards suicide 10 years to the day after the final is viewed as the ultimate symbol of the club’s distress.\n\nAt Roma’s training a ground an all-weather practice pitch (Campo A) with bleachers memorialises Di Bartolomei as idol and lost son. \"Di Bartolomeo – \"Ago\" for fans – was the last great AS Roma captain until Francesco Totti's rise,” D’Allesandro says. “He was a humble person outside the pitch. He was a great playmaker with a great long pass and long shot. It's a sad story. If you ask a Roma fan the question about how damaged the club was after 1984, their first answer will be: look what happened to Di Bartolomei…”\n\nIn their Tyrian purple and gold shirts, Roma have won three Serie A titles, in 1942, 1983 and 2001, and have fielded many Serie A legends: Totti, Aldair, Cafu, Gabriel Batistuta, Bruno Conti, Falcao, Carlo Ancelotti and Franco Tancredi among them. But the current quest is to move into the front-rank of European powers at a time when operating losses have been softened by player sales.\n\nAs the respected ‘Swiss Ramble’ financial analyst pointed out on the eve of the first-leg, Roma’s TV, matchday and commercial income fell sharply last season on the back of their absence from the Champions League, and “their €36 million loss before tax was the second highest in Serie A” behind Milan’s €70m. Juventus, Napoli and Roma’s cross-town rivals Lazio were all in profit. Swiss Ramble say Roma’s “loss would have been even higher without [a] €95m profit on player sales, mainly Mo Salah to Liverpool, Antonio Rüdiger to Chelsea and Leandro Paredes to Zenit St Petersburg.”\n\nEdin Dzeko, their star player, meanwhile, articulates the sporting reasons for always wanting to go far in Europe. “In Serie A we’re not doing the best we can do, but we’re still fighting for the Champions League,” Dzeko says. “As you’ve seen this year, the Champions League is very important. It’s the best competition in the world: best teams, the best players, and we want to do it again next year.”\n\nThe 1984 final will be a relic to most young Roma fans, but such traumas have a way of permeating club culture. D’Allesandro says: “That match was a point of no return. Yes, Roma won a few Coppa Italias and reached [and lost] the 1991 Uefa Cup final, but that [’84] final signalled the moment in the club's storyline where it could go up a level and failed to do so.\n\n\"Di Bartolomei and [Nils] Liedholm [the manager] left. Sven Goran Eriksson came in as the coach. But the season after that final was poor: we finished in seventh position in Serie A. For a great victory we had to wait until 2001. This means 17 years of purgatory after being so close to reaching heaven.\n\n“For AS Roma, a sort of Cinderella in the competition, to come so far is a sort of victory. It's a good team. The stars are captain Daniele De Rossi, born and raised at AS Roma, like Totti; Edin Dzeko was criticised in his first season but now is an idol. This year we bought Aleksandr Kolarov who has given the team the international experience needed. Nainggolan and Strootman are potentially world-class-players. This year we discovered Alisson, one of the best goalkeepers in the world. And during the season, Under's star has risen.”\n\nAccording to D’Allesandro, “Liverpool means two things to Roma: Mohamed Salah and the 1984 final.” Exactly 10 years after that night, Di Bartolomei, who, at Roma, carried a gun in a bag after being mugged in a restaurant, walked onto the balcony of his villa in San Marco di Castellabate and shot himself through the heart. He called the 1984 final “the game of my life.” It was also the game of his death."
