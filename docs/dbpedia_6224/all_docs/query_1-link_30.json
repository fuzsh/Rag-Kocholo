        "text": "Cup Winners' Cup\n\nThe UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (also referred to as the European Cup Winners' Cup), the tournament between the domestic cup winners, existed from 1960 to 1999. The structure was a knock-out tournament in which the matches were decided by two-legged ties except the final that was played as one game on neutral ground (the final was actually decided by two matches once, in the first 1960-1961 edition). After the UEFA Champions League was established in successful terms and started to include more teams, the status of the Cup Winners' Cup was steadily declining. Therefore, the decision was taken to bring the Cup to an end after the 1998-1999 season and instead merge it with the UEFA Cup in the sense that domestic Cup winners would be included in that tournament.\n\nWinners and runners-up\n\nAll the winners and runners-up trough the years of the UEFA Cup Winner's Cup.\n\nSeason Winner Runner-up 1998-1999 Lazio Mallorca 1997-1998 Chelsea Stuttgart 1996-1997 Barcelona PSG 1995-1996 PSG Rapid Wien 1994-1995 Real Zaragoza Arsenal 1993-1994 Arsenal Parma 1992-1993 Parma Royal Antwerp 1991-1992 Werder Bremen Monaco 1990-1991 Manchester United Barcelona 1989-1990 Sampdoria Anderlecht 1998-1989 Barcelona Sampdoria 1987-1988 Mechelen Ajax 1986-1987 Ajax Lokomotive Leipzig 1985-1986 Dynamo Kyiv AtlÃ©tico Madrid 1984-1985 Everton Rapid Wien 1983-1984 Juventus Porto 1982-1983 Aberdeen Real Madrid 1981-1982 Barcelona Standard LiÃ¨ge 1980-1981 Dinamo Tbilisi Carl Zeiss Jena 1979-1980 Valencia Arsenal 1978-1979 Barcelona Fortuna DÃ¼sseldorf 1977-1978 Anderlecht Austria Wien 1976-1977 Hamburg Anderlecht 1975-1976 Anderlecht West Ham 1974-1975 Dynamo Kyiv FerencvÃ¡ros 1973-1974 Magdeburg Milan 1972-1973 Milan Leeds United 1971-1972 Rangers Dynamo Moscow 1970-1971 Chelsea Real Madrid 1969-1970 Manchester City GÃ³rnik Zabrze 1968-1969 Slovan Bratislava Barcelona 1967-1968 Milan Hamburg 1966-1967 Bayern Munich Rangers 1965-1966 Borussia Dortmund Liverpool 1964-1965 West Ham 1860 Munich 1963-1964 Sporting MTK HungÃ¡ria 1962-1963 Tottenham AtlÃ©tico Madrid 1961-1962 AtlÃ©tico Madrid Fiorentina 1960-1961 Fiorentina Rangers\n\nHistory\n\nThe establishment of the Cup Winner's Cup was a result of the growing interest among fans and the success of European Cup that started in 1955. The tournament was originally organized by the Mitropa Cup committee until UEFA took over in 1963.\n\nAt the time the first tournament was held in the 1960-1961 season it included only ten teams. The interest among the clubs was at this time not very big, but the competition would, however, start growing both in regards of teams and prestige. By the late 1960s all UEFA members were represented by a team.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Cup Winners' Cup would lose more and more status due to the increasing popularity of the Champions League. As Champions League expanded several times by including more teams from the European leagues, the teams qualified for the Cup Winners' Cup were no longer among the top clubs. Because of the decreased status, UEFA decided to end the competition after the 1998-1999 tournament. Lazio would become the last cup champions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStatistics\n\nThe club that won the tournament the most times were FC Barcelona with four trophies (1979, 1982, 1989, 1997). Besides that Barcelona were also runners-up twice (1969, 1991).\n\nTable 2.
