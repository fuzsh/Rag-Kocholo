        "text": "Italy kick off the European Championship finals on Friday evening when they host Turkey at the Stadio Olimpico. Leonardo Spinazzola and Bryan Cristante are the two remaining Roma players in the Azzurri ranks following Lorenzo Pellegrini's withdrawal.\n\nOnly two footballers have won the Euros as Roma players: Vincent Candela, when France triumphed over Italy (whose squad included Francesco Totti, Vincenzo Montella, Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Antonioli) in 2000, and Traianos Dellas, when Greece stunned the continent by climbing to the top of Europe in 2004.\n\nHowever, if we consider players who won the tournament before or after playing for the Giallorossi, the total number is seven.\n\nSpain 1964: Luis Del Sol\n\nLuis Del Sol joined Roma in 1970 as part of the deal which saw Fabio Capello, Fausto Landini and Luciano Spinosi move to Juventus. Six years earlier, the talented midfielder tasted European glory with Spain, although he didn't feature in the 2-1 final victory against the Soviet Union.\n\nItaly 1968: Giancarlo De Sisti and Pierino Prati\n\nGiancarlo De Sisti and Pierino Prati helped the Azzurri claim their only Euros success to date in 1968 but neither plied their trade for Roma at the time.\n\nDe Sisti came through the Giallorossi youth ranks and made his senior debut in 1960 but switched to Fiorentina in 1965. There he won a Scudetto before returning to Roma in 1974. He was subsequently inducted into the AS Roma Hall of Fame.\n\nPierino Prati is widely remembered as an AC Milan legend, winning the European Cup and two Cup Winners' Cups in a seven-year spell with the Rossoneri, but he left an indelible mark at Roma too. After moving to the capital in 1973, he wrote his name in Giallorossi folklore by scoring the winning goal in the derby on 23 March 1975, helping Roma overtake Lazio in the table.\n\nGermany 1996: Thomas Haessler\n\n\"Po-po-po-po-po\" Tommassino Haessler go', as the Roma fans used to sing.\n\nA free-kick specialist and midfield playmaker, World Cup winner Thomas Haessler joined Roma in 1991 after a season at Juventus. He spent three years in yellow and red before returning to his homeland.\n\nAs a Karlsruhe player, he scored a penalty in Germany's semi-final success over host nation England on the way to Euros glory.\n\nFrance 2000: Vincent Candela\n\nVincent Candela was the first Roma player to win the Euros and he is still revered as a Giallorossi idol to this day. He had to contend with Bixente Lizarazu for the France left-back spot, though, with the Bayern Munich man starting the 2000 final won by David Trezeguet's golden goal after Marco Delvecchio's strike had almost given Italy victory in regular time.\n\nGreece 2004: Traianos Dellas\n\nWhile Candela didn't play as much as he deserved for his national team, the same cannot be said of Traianos Dellas.\n\nThe rugged centre-back, much loved by Romanisti, was an integral part of the Greece side that defended their way to success in 2004, beating favourites Portugal in the final. Dellas scored the silver goal against the Czech Republic in the semi-final and was named in UEFA's team of the tournament.\n\nSpain 2012: Pedro\n\nThe most recent Roma player to be crowned European champion is Pedro.\n\nThe former Chelsea and Barcelona winger came on in the 59th minute of the final with Spain leading Daniele De Rossi's Italy by two goals."
