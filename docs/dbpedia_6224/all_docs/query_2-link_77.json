        "text": "In this latest update, we’ve considered recent performances, records, and major milestones. With Lionel Messi’s recent move to Inter Miami and his incredible debut season in the MLS, he continues to amaze fans worldwide. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo’s consistent scoring for Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League keeps him in the spotlight.\n\nAdditionally, current stars like Kylian Mbappe (PSG), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Erling Haaland (Man City), and Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) are making waves and earning their place among the greats. Their outstanding performances and remarkable statistics further enhance this list.\n\nTop 10 Football Players in the World\n\nHere are the best footballers with top ranking in 2024:\n\n1. Kylian Mbappé (PSG): A World Cup-Born Megastar\n\nKylian Mbappé has established himself as a football megastar through his stellar performances on the grandest stage of all: the World Cup. While the Champions League and Premier League often dominate the spotlight, Mbappé’s international heroics have cemented his place among the elite. His hat-trick in the World Cup final is already legendary, showcasing his immense talent and mental strength.\n\nMuch like Neymar and Messi, Mbappé has excelled in Ligue 1, but his exceptional form for both club and country sets him apart. His consistent big-time performances on the global stage affirm his greatness and leave no doubt about his abilities.\n\nWith 802 goals and 42 trophies, Lionel Messi tops the the list of top football players of all time. Known for his exceptional dribbling, precise passing, incredible vision, and prolific goal-scoring ability, Messi has set numerous records during his illustrious career. He spent the majority of his career with FC Barcelona.\n\nFull Name: Kylian Mbappé Lottin\n\nBorn: December 20, 1998, in Bondy, France\n\nPosition: Forward\n\nClubs:\n\nAS Monaco (2015-2018)\n\nParis Saint-Germain (2018-present)\n\nAchievements:\n\nWith AS Monaco:\n\nLigue 1 Championship: 2016-2017\n\nWith Paris Saint-Germain:\n\nMultiple Ligue 1 Championships\n\nCoupe de France Titles\n\nCoupe de la Ligue Titles\n\nWith the France National Team:\n\nFIFA World Cup Champion: 2018\n\nFIFA World Cup Golden Boot: 2022\n\nUEFA Nations League: 2021\n\nKylian Mbappé has rapidly ascended to football superstardom, showcasing his talent and mental fortitude on the global stage. His hat-trick in the World Cup final stands as a testament to his exceptional skills and big-game prowess.\n\n2. Harry Kane (Bayern Munich)\n\nHarry Kane has been making headlines at UEFA EURO 2024 with his crucial contributions to England’s progress in the tournament. Recently, in a dramatic last-16 match against Slovakia, Kane scored a vital goal in extra time, securing a 2-1 victory for England. This win ensured England’s place in the quarter-finals, where they will face Switzerland. Kane’s goal came just 50 seconds into the additional period, following a stunning equalizer by Jude Bellingham in the dying moments of regular time​.\n\nFull Name: Harry Edward Kane\n\nBorn: July 28, 1993, in Walthamstow, London, England\n\nPosition: Striker\n\nClubs:\n\nTottenham Hotspur (2009-2023)\n\nBayern Munich (2023-present)\n\nAchievements:\n\nWith Tottenham Hotspur:\n\nPremier League Golden Boot: Multiple times\n\nNumerous top-four Premier League finishes\n\nUEFA Champions League Finalist: 2019\n\nWith Bayern Munich:\n\nBundesliga Champion: 2024 (anticipated)\n\nWith England National Team:\n\nFIFA World Cup Golden Boot: 2018\n\nUEFA European Championship Runner-up: 2020\n\nEngland’s All-Time Leading Goal Score\n\nThe England captain’s finishing is exemplary, his positioning to accommodate for a lack of raw pace is second-to-none, though his unique selling point is his uncanny playmaking ability, to pick a pass from deep, to swing a cross in, to play the No.10 and No.9 roles simultaneously and effectively and he achieved all of that in a Tottenham team that, with the greatest respect, was simply not at his level and rarely has been near his standard. He is the greatest natural No.9 in world football right now.\n\n3. Erling Haaland (Man City): The Prolific Goal Machine\n\nErling Haaland continues to dominate headlines with his remarkable performances for Manchester City. The Norwegian striker recently secured his second successive Premier League Golden Boot by scoring 27 goals in the 2023-2024 season, outpacing Chelsea’s Cole Palmer, who scored 22 goals. Haaland’s incredible goal-scoring prowess has been pivotal in Manchester City’s successful campaign, helping them win their fourth consecutive Premier League title​.\n\nHaaland’s impact extends beyond the Premier League. He scored hat-tricks against Fulham and Wolves and delivered crucial goals against top teams like Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United, and Chelsea. His efforts contributed significantly to City’s historic achievements, including a potential successive Premier League and FA Cup double.\n\nFull Name: Erling Braut Haaland\n\nBorn: July 21, 2000, in Leeds, England\n\nPosition: Forward.\n\nClubs:\n\nBryne FK (2016)\n\nMolde FK (2017-2018)\n\nRed Bull Salzburg (2019-2020)\n\nBorussia Dortmund (2020-2022)\n\nManchester City (2022-present)\n\nAchievements:\n\nWith Red Bull Salzburg:\n\nAustrian Bundesliga titles\n\nAustrian Cup\n\nWith Borussia Dortmund:\n\nDFB-Pokal title\n\nBundesliga Player of the Season\n\nWith Manchester City:\n\nPremier League Golden Boot\n\nUEFA Champions League top scorer.\n\nOverall, Haaland has amassed an astonishing 90 goals in 96 games for Manchester City, with 38 goals scored in the current season alone. His rapid rise and record-breaking performances have solidified his reputation as one of the most prolific strikers in modern football​.\n\n4. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\n\nMohamed Salah, the Egyptian football star and Liverpool forward, has recently signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool, putting an end to speculation about his future at Anfield. This new deal, which reportedly makes him the highest-paid player in the club’s history with weekly earnings exceeding £350,000, extends his stay and reflects his commitment to helping the team secure more trophies​​. Salah expressed his excitement and readiness to continue contributing to Liverpool’s success, emphasizing his desire to win more titles with the club.\n\nFull Name: Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly\n\nBorn: June 15, 1992, in Nagrig, Egypt\n\nPosition: Forward/Winger\n\nClubs:\n\nEl Mokawloon (2010-2012)\n\nBasel (2012-2014)\n\nChelsea (2014-2016)\n\nFiorentina (loan, 2015)\n\nRoma (2015-2017)\n\nLiverpool (2017-present)\n\nAchievements:\n\nWith Liverpool:\n\nPremier League Champion: 2019-2020\n\nUEFA Champions League Winner: 2018-2019\n\nFIFA Club World Cup Winner: 2019\n\nNumerous individual awards, including Premier League Golden Boot\n\nWith Egypt National Team:\n\nAfrica Cup of Nations Runner-up: 2017\n\nBBC African Footballer of the Year: 2017, 2018\n\nFor a player with a relatively simple playing style, he remains an enigma to halt. We say ‘simple’ in the least derogatory way possible. Salah is a touchline-hugging, direct winger with the ability to drive inside as he approaches the box. It should be easy to see it coming, but nobody has found a way to stop him.\n\nIf he racks up another couple of 20+ goal seasons, he will hit the 200 Premier League goals mark, an unbelievable achievement for any player, let alone a winger playing out wide.\n\n5. Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid): Rising Star of English Football\n\nJude Bellingham has recently been in the spotlight due to his performances and a controversial incident during Euro 2024. In England’s last-16 victory over Slovakia, Bellingham scored a dramatic bicycle kick to level the match in stoppage time, taking it into extra time, where England eventually won. However, following his goal, Bellingham made a gesture that led to an investigation by UEFA. The gesture, which he insisted was an “inside joke” among friends, resulted in a suspended one-match ban and a fine of €30,000 (£25,406). Despite the controversy, Bellingham has been cleared to play in England’s quarter-final match against Switzerland​.\n\nFull Name: Jude Victor William Bellingham\n\nBorn: June 29, 2003, in Stourbridge, England\n\nPosition: Midfielder\n\nClubs:\n\nBirmingham City (2010-2020)\n\nBorussia Dortmund (2020-2023)\n\nReal Madrid (2023-present)\n\nAchievements:\n\nWith Borussia Dortmund:\n\nDFB-Pokal Winner: 2021\n\nNumerous Bundesliga accolades\n\nWith Real Madrid:\n\nLa Liga accolades\n\nWith England National Team:\n\nUEFA European Championship Runner-up: 2021\n\nFIFA World Cup appearances: 2022\n\nBellingham’s rapid rise to prominence has been marked by his exceptional performances and maturity beyond his years, making him a key player for both club and country\n\n6. Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\n\nKevin De Bruyne, the star midfielder for Manchester City and the Belgian national team, is currently facing a challenging period due to a significant injury. De Bruyne sustained a hamstring injury during Manchester City’s Premier League opener against Burnley in August 2023, which is expected to sideline him for several months. This injury has put a damper on his season, potentially causing him to miss up to 26 matches, including critical Champions League fixtures and the FIFA Club World Cup​.\n\nIn addition to his injury woes, De Bruyne has been at the center of transfer rumors. Reports suggest he has a verbal agreement to join Al-Ittihad, a Saudi Pro League club, in the upcoming transfer window. While Manchester City has been considering a new contract for their playmaker, his injury history and the lucrative offer from the Saudi club might influence his decision\n\nFull Name: Kevin De Bruyne\n\nBorn: June 28, 1991, in Drongen, Belgium\n\nPosition: Midfielder.\n\nClubs:\n\nKRC Genk (2008-2012)\n\nChelsea FC (2012-2014)\n\nVfL Wolfsburg (2014-2015)\n\nManchester City (2015-present)\n\nAchievements:\n\nWith Manchester City:\n\nMultiple Premier League titles\n\nFA Cup titles\n\nEFL Cup titles\n\nUEFA Champions League winner\n\nWith Belgium National Team:\n\nFIFA World Cup Third Place: 2018\n\nUEFA European Championship top performances.\n\nDespite these setbacks, De Bruyne continues to shine on the international stage. He recently scored in Belgium’s 2-0 victory over Romania in the Euro 2024 group stage, demonstrating his enduring impact and leadership as the team captain​.\n\n7. Lionel Messi (Inter Miami)\n\nLionel Messi continues to make headlines with his stellar performances and significant milestones in 2024. Playing for Inter Miami, Messi has been a key player in the Major League Soccer (MLS) season, scoring 12 goals and providing 13 assists in just 12 games, showcasing his extraordinary talent and impact on the field. His remarkable form has earned him a place in the 2024 MLS All-Star team, where he will be joined by teammates Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba, and Sergio Busquets for the match against Mexico’s Liga MX All-Stars on July 24 in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nIn addition to his club success, Messi continues to play a crucial role for the Argentina national team. He is currently competing in the 2024 Copa America, where Argentina is striving to defend their title. Despite some recent injury concerns, Messi remains a vital part of Lionel Scaloni’s plans and has been pivotal in Argentina’s progress in the tournament​.\n\nFull Name: Lionel Andrés Messi\n\nBorn: June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina\n\nPosition: Forward/Attacking Midfielder\n\nClubs:\n\nFC Barcelona (2000-2021):\n\nNumerous La Liga championships\n\nMultiple UEFA Champions League titles\n\nNumerous Copa del Rey titles\n\nMultiple FIFA Club World Cup titles\n\nNumerous Ballon d’Or awards\n\nInter Miami (2023-present):\n\nContinuing to showcase his incredible talent in Major League Soccer (MLS)\n\nAchievements:\n\nWith Argentina National Team:\n\nCopa America champion: 2021\n\nOlympic Gold Medal: 2008\n\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball (best player): 2014, 2022.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are no longer the undisputed top two in world football. There are plenty of superstars across the planet, with the bulk of the most talented players plying their trade in Europe, but when it comes to comparing the top performers, the playing field is significantly more level.\n\n8. Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan)\n\nLautaro Martínez has been making significant contributions to Argentina’s success in the Copa America 2024. The 26-year-old Inter Milan captain has been in stellar form, scoring four goals in the group stage matches, including a decisive brace in a 2-0 victory over Peru. His performance has been instrumental in helping Argentina finish the group stage with a perfect record, winning all three matches against Peru, Chile, and Canada​.\n\nFull Name: Lautaro Javier Martínez\n\nBorn: August 22, 1997, in Bahía Blanca, Argentina\n\nPosition: Forward\n\nClubs:\n\nRacing Club (2015-2018):\n\nShowcased his potential as a prolific striker in the Argentine Primera División.\n\nInter Milan (2018-present):\n\nKey player in winning the Serie A title (2020-2021).\n\nAchievements:\n\nWith Inter Milan:\n\nSerie A Champion: 2020-2021.\n\nCoppa Italia winner: 2021-2022.\n\nSupercoppa Italiana winner: 2021.\n\nWith Argentina National Team:\n\nCopa America Champion: 2021.\n\nFIFA World Cup: Quarter-finalist (2022).\n\nIn addition to his Copa America heroics, Martínez has reaffirmed his commitment to Inter Milan by reportedly agreeing to a new contract, which underscores his importance to the club​​. As the tournament progresses, all eyes will be on Martínez to see if he can continue his excellent form and lead Argentina to further glory\n\n9. Rodri (Man City)\n\nRodri, the influential Spanish midfielder, has been making headlines both for his club, Manchester City, and his national team. Recently, he played a crucial role in Spain’s 4-1 victory over Georgia in the Euro 2024, scoring a pivotal goal that helped secure their place in the quarter-finals against Germany​​. His performance at the Euros has been widely praised, further cementing his reputation as one of the best midfielders in the world​.\n\nOn the club front, Manchester City is reportedly preparing a new lucrative contract for Rodri to ensure his long-term future at the Etihad Stadium. The new deal, which will significantly increase his current wages of £220,000 per week, is a testament to his indispensable role in Pep Guardiola’s squad​. This move comes as no surprise, given Rodri’s consistent top-level performances and his ability to control the midfield, making him a vital part of City’s recent successes.\n\nFull Name: Rodrigo Hernández Cascante (Rodri)\n\nBorn: June 22, 1996, in Madrid, Spain\n\nPosition: Defensive Midfielder\n\nClubs:\n\nVillarreal CF (2015-2018)\n\nAtlético Madrid (2018-2019)\n\nManchester City (2019-present)\n\nAchievements:\n\nWith Manchester City:\n\nPremier League championships\n\nUEFA Champions League title\n\nFA Cup titles\n\nEFL Cup titles\n\nWith Spain National Team:\n\nUEFA Nations League champion: 2023\n\nEuro Under-21 champion: 2019\n\n10.
