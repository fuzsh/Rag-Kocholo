        "text": "The UEFA Europa League originated as the UEFA Cup in 1971, succeeding the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Like the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League), it began as a straight knockout competition.\n\nTottenham Hotspur won the first UEFA Cup in 1971. From 1971 to 2009, three clubs — Inter Milan, Juventus, and Liverpool — each lifted the trophy three times.\n\nSevilla have been the most successful club in the history of the UEFA Cup/Europa League, with seven titles to date, including three consecutive wins in 2014, 2015, and 2016.\n\nSpanish teams have historically dominated the competition, with 14 victories. English and Italian clubs, meanwhile, are tied for second, each with nine titles. German teams, including those from the former West Germany, have won the competition seven times.\n\nInitially, from 1971 to 1997, all UEFA Cup finals were played over two legs, before the 1997/98 final between Inter Milan and Lazio was the first to adopt a single-match format.\n\nHere, The Sporting News takes a look at the most Europa League titles by club, as well as the history and scores from each final to date.\n\nMORE: Atalanta beat Bayer Leverkusen in 2024 Europa League final\n\nWho has won the most Europa League titles?\n\nThe Europa League has been dominated by Spanish side Sevilla this century as they've won the trophy on seven occasions and have never lost a Europa League final.\n\nNo side has won more Europa League titles than Sevilla.\n\nTheir most recent triumph came on penalties in the 2023 final, when they faced Jose Mourinho's Roma.\n\nAfter Sevilla, four teams have won the competition on three occasions: Inter Milan, Liverpool, Juventus and Atletico Madrid.\n\nClubWinnersYears wonSevilla72006, 2007, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2020, 2023Inter Milan31991, 1994, 1998Liverpool31973, 1976, 2001Juventus31977, 1990, 1993Atlético Madrid32010, 2012, 2018Borussia Monchengladbach21975, 1979Tottenham Hotspur21972, 1984Feyenoord21974, 2002Eintracht Frankfurt21980, 2022IFK Gothenburg21982, 1987Real Madrid21985, 1986Parma21995, 1999Porto22003, 2011Chelsea22013, 2019Anderlecht11983Ajax11992Manchester United12017PSV Eindhoven11978Ipswich Town11981Bayer Leverkusen11988Napoli11989Bayern Munich11996Schalke 0411997Galatasaray12000Valencia12004CSKA Moscow12005Zenit Saint Petersburg12008Shakhtar Donetsk12009Villarreal12021Atalanta12024\n\nMORE: All-time list of UEFA Champions League winners, including every club to lift the trophy\n\nEuropa League finals history and scores\n\nYearWinnersScoreRunners-up1971–72Tottenham Hotspur2–1, 1–1Wolverhampton Wanderers1972–73Liverpool3–0, 0–2Borussia Monchengladbach1973–74Feyenoord2–2, 2–0Tottenham Hotspur1974–75Borussia Monchengladbach0–0, 5–1Twente1975–76Liverpool3–2, 1–1Club Brugge1976–77Juventus1–0, 1–2Athletic Bilbao1977–78PSV Eindhoven0–0, 3–0Bastia1978–79Borussia Monchengladbach1–1, 1–0Red Star Belgrade1979–80Eintracht Frankfurt2–3, 1–0Borussia Monchengladbach1980–81Ipswich Town3–0, 2–4AZ1981–82IFK Gothenburg1–0, 3–0Hamburg1982–83Anderlecht1–0, 1–1Benfica1983–84Tottenham Hotspur1–1, 1–1*Anderlecht1984–85Real Madrid3–0, 0–1Videoton1985–86Real Madrid5–1, 0–2Cologne1986–87IFK Gothenburg1–0, 1–1Dundee United1987–88Bayer Leverkusen0–3, 3–0*Espanyol1988–89Napoli2–1, 3–3VfB Stuttgart1989–90Juventus3–1, 0–0Fiorentina1990–91Inter Milan2–0, 0–1Roma1991–92Ajax2–2, 0–0Torino1992–93Juventus3–1, 3–0Borussia Dortmund1993–94Inter Milan1–0, 1–0Austria Salzburg1994–95Parma1–0, 1–1Juventus1995–96Bayern Munich2–0, 3–1Bordeaux1996–97Schalke 041–0, 0–1*Inter Milan1997–98Inter Milan3–0Lazio1998–99Parma3–0Marseille1999–2000Galatasaray0–0*Arsenal2000–01Liverpool5–4§Deportivo Alavés2001–02Feyenoord3–2Borussia Dortmund2002–03Porto3–2†Celtic2003–04Valencia2–0Marseille2004–05CSKA Moscow3–1Sporting CP2005–06Sevilla4–0Middlesbrough2006–07Sevilla2–2*Espanyol2007–08Zenit Saint Petersburg2–0Rangers2008–09Shakhtar Donetsk2–1†Werder Bremen2009–10Atletico Madrid2–1†Fulham2010–11Porto1–0Braga2011–12Atlético Madrid3–0Athletic Bilbao2012–13Chelsea2–1Benfica2013–14Sevilla0–0*Benfica2014–15Sevilla3–2Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk2015–16Sevilla3–1Liverpool2016–17Manchester United2–0Ajax2017–18Atletico Madrid3–0Marseille2018–19Chelsea4–1Arsenal2019–20Sevilla3–2Inter Milan2020–21Villarreal1–1*Manchester United2021–22Eintracht Frankfurt1–1*Rangers2022–23Sevilla1–1*Roma2023-24Atalanta3-0Bayer Leverkusen\n\n*Note: Scores with an asterisk () indicate the match was decided by penalties.\n\n†Note: Scores with a dagger (†) indicate the match was decided after extra time.\n\n§Note: Scores with a section symbol (§) indicate the match was decided by a golden goal."
