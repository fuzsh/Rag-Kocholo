        "text": "Roma are an Italian football club who feature in the Italian Serie A. They have won their domestic league title on three occasions and the Coppa Italia nine times, as well as finishing as runners-up in the 1984 European Cup. Roma, also known as the Giallorossi, have an established local rivalry with fellow Roman side, Lazio, with whom they contest the Derby della Capitale. Historically, their most famous and celebrated players are Agostino Di Bartolomei, Aldair, Giacomo Losi, Amedeo Amadei, Daniele De Rossi, Paulo Roberto Falcao, Roberto Pruzzo, Giuseppe Giannini, Bruno Conti, Gabriel Batistuta, and Francesco Totti. Nils Liedholm has been in charge of the club an incredible four times, and took them to their only European Cup final in 1984. Their home since 1953 has been the Stadio Olimpico which has a capacity of nearly 71,000 spectators and has hosted the World Cup final and several European Cup finals in the past."
