        "text": "Following a strong run through the group stage that saw the USA score a program-record nine goals and claim all nine points available, the U.S. Olympic Women’s Soccer Team kicks off the knockout rounds of Paris 2024, taking on longtime foes Japan on Saturday, August 3 at famed Parc des Princes. Kickoff is at 9 a.m. ET / 3 p.m. local in Paris with broadcast coverage on USA Network, Telemundo, Universo and Peacock.\n\nThe matchup between the USWNT – winners of Group B – and Japan – runners-up in Group C – will be the first Olympic meeting between the teams since the gold medal match at London 2012, which the Americans famously won 2-1 behind a brace from Carli Lloyd.\n\nTwelve years later, the teams are set to meet again in Paris with the winner advancing to the August 6 semifinal in Lyon to face the winner of the quarterfinal meeting between Germany and Canada.\n\nFans can follow the action from the Olympics via X (formerly Twitter - @USWNT),Instagram (@USWNT), Facebook and the official U.S. Soccer App. Click here for more information on how to follow all of Team USA at Paris 2024.\n\nTOP OF THE GROUP\n\nFor the second time in program history and first since 2012, the USWNT won all three group stage games at the Olympics, rattling off wins over Zambia (3-0), Germany (4-1) and Australia (2-1) to finish at the top of its group for the sixth time in eight Olympic appearances. Three of the last five times the USA took first in its group, it went on to win the gold medal.\n\nThe USWNT’s young starting front line has led the way so far in the tournament, with 26-year-old Mallory Swanson (3 goals, 1 assist), 23-year-old Sophia Smith (2 goals, 2 assists) and 22-year-old Trinity Rodman (2 goals, 1 assist) scoring seven of the USA’s nine goals so far this tournament. Lynn Williams and Korbin Albert also found the back of the net, helping the USA to its highest-scoring Olympic group stage ever.\n\nDefensively, the U.S. has conceded just twice – trailing only Spain (one goal against) for the fewest in the tournament field – and has limited the opposition to just 12 shots on target.\n\nU.S. OLYMPIC WOMEN’S SOCCER TEAM ROSTER BY POSITION (CLUB)\n\nGOALKEEPERS (2): 18-Casey Murphy (North Carolina Courage), 1-Alyssa Naeher (Chicago Red Stars)\n\nDEFENDERS (6): 12-Tierna Davidson (NJ/NY Gotham FC), 2-Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG), 4-Naomi Girma (San Diego Wave FC), 6-Casey Krueger (Washington Spirit), 13-Jenna Nighswonger (NJ/NY Gotham FC), 14-Emily Sonnett (NJ/NY Gotham FC)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (4): 3-Korbin Albert (Paris Saint-Germain, FRA), 17-Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC), 10-Lindsey Horan (Olympique Lyon, FRA), 16-Rose Lavelle (NJ/NY Gotham FC)\n\nFORWARDS (6): 7-Crystal Dunn (NJ/NY Gotham FC), 5-Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit), 15-Jaedyn Shaw (San Diego Wave FC), 11-Sophia Smith (Portland Thorns FC), 9-Mallory Swanson (Chicago Red Stars), 8-Lynn Williams (NJ/NY Gotham FC)\n\nALTERNATES (4): 20-Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit), 22-Jane Campbell (Houston Dash), 19-Hal Hershfelt (Washington Spirit), 21-Emily Sams (Orlando Pride)\n\nAND THEN THERE WERE EIGHT\n\nFollowing a highly competitive group-stage, the field for the knockout rounds of the 2024 Olympic Women’s Soccer Tournament is set. The top two teams from each group – France and Canada from Group A, the USA and Germany from Group B, and Spain and Japan from Group C – advanced to the quarterfinals, along with the two best third-place finishers, those being Colombia from Group A and Brazil from Group C.\n\nThe USA and Japan will open play at 9 a.m. ET / 3 p.m. local in the quarterfinals at Parc des Princes in Paris, followed by Spain taking on Colombia at 11 a.m. ET / 5 p.m. local in the Lyon in the other quadrant of the bracket. Canada and Germany square off at 1 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. local in Marseille with the winner going on to face the winner of USA-Japan in the semifinal. Hosts France take on Brazil at 3 p.m. ET / 9 p.m. local to close out quarterfinal play in Nantes.\n\nOf the eight teams in the knockout rounds, five have previously reached the podium at the Olympics. The U.S. has the most Olympic gold and most total medals in the history of the competition, winning four golds, one silver and one bronze. Germany, the 2016 gold medalists, has also won three bronze medals while Canada, the 2020 champions, has two bronze medals to go with the gold from last tournament. Brazil has two silver medals while Japan took silver in 2012, finishing runners-up to the USA.\n\nMARQUEE MATCHUP\n\nSaturday’s match at Parc des Princes will be the seventh meeting all-time between the USA and Japan in the knockout rounds of a World Cup or Olympics, passing USA vs. Brazil to become the most played knockout-round matchup in the history of women’s world championships.\n\nIt will be the fifth meeting between the USWNT and Japan at the Olympics, tying Brazil vs. Germany for the most-played match in women’s Olympic history.\n\nAlong with the gold medal match at London 2012, the USA and Japan also squared off twice at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing – a 1-0 win for the Americans in the group stage and 4-2 USA victory in the semifinals – as well as the quarterfinals of the 2004 Olympics in Athens, a 2-1 win for the U.S. enroute to its second gold medal.\n\nThe USA and Japan met in back-to-back FIFA Women’s World Cup finals in 2011 and 2015. Japan prevailed 3-1 on penalty kicks in 2011 to win its first-ever World Cup title after the teams were level at 2-2 through the end of regulation and overtime. Four years later in Canada, the USA earned its third star in a match for the ages, winning 5-2 behind a hat-trick from Lloyd in the opening 16 minutes. The teams also met in the quarterfinals of the 1995 World Cup, a 4-0 victory for the U.S., preceded by a 3-0 USA victory in the group stage of the inaugural Women’s World Cup in 1991.\n\nWith the penalty kick shootout officially listed as a draw, the U.S. has an overall record of 7W-0L-1D when facing Japan at world championship events, including a 4W-0L-0D record when facing the Japanese at the Olympics, tied for its most wins against any one opponent at the Olympics.\n\nINSIDE THE SERIES: USA vs. JAPAN\n\nThe quarterfinal clash in Paris with be the 41st meeting all-time between the USA and Japan and the second matchup between the teams this year.\n\nThe U.S. and Japan faced off in the semifinals of the 2024 SheBelieves Cup in Atlanta on April 6. Playing in front of a crowd of 50,644 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium – the largest crowd to watch the USWNT on home soil since the 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup Final – the U.S. came back from an early deficit to win 2-1 and advance to the SheBelieves Cup final, where it went on to hoist the trophy for the fifth consecutive year. Japan scored just 31 seconds into the match, taking the lead on a goal from Kiko Seike, but the Americans equalized in the 21st minute with a strike from distance by Jaedyn Shaw and Lindsey Horan converted the game-winning penalty kick in the 77th.\n\nThe last four meetings between the teams have come at the SheBelieves Cup – a 2-2 draw in 2019 followed by three consecutive wins for the Americans (3-1 in 2020, 1-0 in 2023 and 2-1 in 2024). Overall, the USA leads the all-time series against Japan with a record of 31W-1L-8D, with its lone loss in the series came during the 2012 Algarve Cup. Since then, the USA is unbeaten in the last 13 meetings between the teams, with nine wins and four draws in that span, including victories in the 2012 Olympic Final and the 2015 World Cup Final. The U.S. has scored multiple goals in eight of its last nine matchups with Japan.\n\nRETURN TO PARC DES PRINCES\n\nThe USWNT heads into Saturday’s match in Paris having won each of its last 11 games in France, a streak that dates back to the start of the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Two of the victories during the USA’s run to the 2019 title came at Parc des Princes, beating Chile 3-0 in the second group stage match on June 16 and then besting hosts France 2-1 in the quarterfinals in one of the most memorable matches of the tournament.\n\nSeven players on this Olympic squad – Tierna Davidson, Crystal Dunn, Lindsey Horan, Rose Lavelle, Alyssa Naeher, Emily Sonnett and Swanson – were on the roster for the 2019 Women’s World Cup. Davidson tallied two assists in the group stage win over Chile at Parc des Princes while Naeher, Dunn, Lavelle and Horan all featured in the quarterfinal victory over France, which the USA won behind a brace from now-retired Megan Rapinoe.\n\nParc des Princes is home to famed France club Paris Saint-Germain and one of the home venues for Albert, who joined PSG in January of 2023, giving up her final two seasons of collegiate eligibility. Albert had a strong 2023-24 campaign for PSG, appearing in 27 matches across all competitions and scoring three goals while helping PSG win the French Cup and take second in the league behind perennial powers Olympique Lyon. Albert made history in the USA’s July 31 win over Australia, coming on in the second half and scoring what proved to be the game-winning goal in the 77th minute. The strike from distance was Albert’s first international goal, making her the first player in USWNT history to score her first career goal at an Olympics.\n\nHoran, who led Lyon to the league title and this year’s UEFA Women’s Champions league final, kicked off her professional career with PSG, joining the club straight out of high school at the age of 18 and becoming the first American woman to skip college soccer to turn pro. Horan played for PSG from 2012 to 2016 and scored nearly 60 goal across all competitions before returning stateside to play for the Portland Thorns.\n\nEMMA ERA STARTING STRONG\n\nThe longtime head coach at Chelsea FC before officially taking over the helm of the USWNT in late May, USWNT head coach Emma Hayes is unbeaten (6W-0L-1D) in her first seven matches with the USWNT, with the first five results coming via shutout.\n\nHayes is the eighth head coach to lead the USWNT at a major tournament and the first to win his or her first major tournament match by a margin of three or more goals. Hayes joins Anson Dorrance as the only head coaches in USWNT history to win their first three matches at a major tournament, with Dorrance winning all six games with the USWNT at the inaugural FIFA Women’s World Cup in 1991.\n\nHayes is looking to become just the fourth USWNT head coach to win their first major tournament, with Dorrance leading the U.S. to the 1991 FIFA Women’s World Cup, Pia Sundhage leading the Americans to a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics and Jill Ellis helping the U.S. to its third World Cup title in 2015.\n\n2024 MEDIA GUIDE\n\nThe 2024 U.S. Olympic Women’s Soccer Media Guide and the 2024 USWNT Media Guide are now available for download. The Media Guides features all the history and statistics for the USWNT, as well as full bios on technical staff and the current top players, information on the USA’s Youth Women’s National Teams and general important information on U.S. Soccer.\n\nUSA TEAM & OLYMPIC ROSTER NOTES\n\nFour of the players on this roster have 100+ caps, led by midfielder and captain Lindsey Horan with 153.

He led Japan to the championship at the 2017 AFC U-19 Championship and qualified for the 2018 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup, which Japan won. He also a former coach for the Japan U-17 Women’s National Team, making him very familiar with Japan’s young talent and their pathway to the senior side.\n\nIn a testament to the growth of Japanese women’s soccer, 11 of the 18 players on the roster play professionally outside of Japan.\n\nJapan qualified for the 2024 Olympics via the 2024 AFC Women’s Olympic Qualifying Tournament, a difficult competition that Japan entered in the Second Round. In Group C of the Second Round, Japan won all three games by an 11-0 aggregate, toping Uzbekistan (2-0), Vietnam (2-0) and India (7-0). That earned Japan a spot in the Third Round where it defeated North Korea 2-1 on aggregate to earn its Olympic berth. Japan tied the first leg 0-0 in a match played in Saudi Arabia before winning the returning leg 2-1 on goals from Hana Takahashi and Aoba Fuino in front of 45,787 fans at Japan’s National Stadium in Tokyo.\n\nWhile Japan’s Senior National Team has not reached a world championship final since 2015, its Women’s Youth National Teams – particularly the Under-20s -- have had a great run of recent success. Japan won the 2018 FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup and finished runner-up at the 2022 FIFA U-20 World Cup contested in Costa Rica.\n\nThen Eighteen-year-old Maika Hamano won the Golden Ball as the top player at the 2022 FIFA U-20 World Cup and also took home the Silver Boot after finishing the tournament with four goals.\n\nJapan fell to eventual champions Spain 2-1 in the quarterfinal of the 2022 FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup in a thrilling match that saw three goals scored in the final 24 minutes of the game. They were also eliminated in the quarterfinals of the U-17 World Cup in 2018, falling to New Zealand on penalties."
