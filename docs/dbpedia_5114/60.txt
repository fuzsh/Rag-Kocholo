Beasley’s WYUU-FM/Tampa (92.5 MAX!MA) raised a record $174,715 during its 10th Annual Promesa y Esperanza Radio-Thon to benefit St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. The event took place 7 a.m. – 7 p.m. December 5 and 6 at the Beasley Media Group broadcast facility located in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Throughout the month of November, WYUU recruited community volunteers to join 92.5 MAX!MA’s on-air team for the two-day fundraiser. The hospital staff worked closely with station engineers setting up the in-house call center.

“It is with events like the St. Jude radio-thon that radio stations and media outlets can apply their reach and messaging power to do something incredibly meaningful,” said WYUU-FM PD Nio Encendio. “Thanks to the contributions of station fans, the children of St. Jude are given a chance to defeat cancer and live their lives while never having to pay a single cent for anything.”
