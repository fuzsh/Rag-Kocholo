        "text": "Laverne Waddington: born in India, raised in Australia and now living in South America. I have been here since 1993.\n\nI spent the first five years in the southernmost city on the South American continent – a wild and windy place called Punta Arenas. My winters were spent backpacking around Peru and Bolivia learning to weave with indigenous teachers. The beautiful long summer days allowed me to explore Tierra del Fuego and the spectacular parks, fjords and glaciers of southern Chile. And, between seasons, I taught English to private students and wove.\n\nIn 1998, I moved to Santa Cruz in land-locked Bolivia – a large city with a small town feel. Life here is simple and laid back despite the crazy traffic and the blaring tropical rhythms. Quite a change from Punta Arenas with its whistling wind and tossing seas. It was an interesting change of scene and climate but I had no intention of living here. The plan was to stay and work for three to six months in several places before heading home to Australia. Well, I found a great job teaching English here, my students and colleagues were friendly and enthusiastic, I made some friends in my new hostel home, met my ”gaucho” boyfriend and here I am fifteen years later. It is a perfect base from which to travel and continue learning to weave, braid and spin as it shares borders with Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile and Peru. Since moving here, I have continued to travel and learn to weave beyond the neighboring countries in Ecuador and even further afield in Guatemala.\n\nI have kept journals in which I have meticulously documented all the techniques I have learned here over the years with diagrams and step-by-step photos and it is only recently that I have found a forum in which to share all this with other weavers around the world.\n\nSo welcome to my blog. I hope to be able to tell you all a little about my life here in Santa Cruz and my weaving and learning experiences. But let’s try to make this as interactive as possible-leave comments, ask questions, give me suggestions. I would love to hear from you all.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHi Laverne,\n\nWell, I am plugging away at my attempt to learn to weave. I have just finished the backstrap and am about to try something else. I am still having problems with setting up the warp and keeping the warps straight. Mine seem to get all over the place. Hopefully that will improve with practice. I am considering approaching one of the women who sit on our plaza and weave in Ajijic to get some help. I was also wondering if you happen to know any teachers in the Chiapis area of Mexico around San Cristobal? We are hoping to spend October and November there and I thought that this might be a good time to get in some lessons. Your tutorials are wonderful, but I think I might benefit from some hands on teaching.\n\nThank you that is a good suggestion. What seems to happen is that when I move my warps onto the loom bars the warps seem to tangle and get twisted. They are straight at the cross, but are not the same at the loom bars. Last time I resorted to using scotch tape to tape the warps in place before I moved them. That seemed to help.\n\nI thought I had read somewhere that you had been to Oaxaca, but I must have been wrong. I know a few people connected to the Mayan community and maybe they will be able to help me find a teacher in Chiapis. I plan on taking Spanish classes which I keep doing on an ongoing basis, painting in plein air and weaving classes. That should make for a busy 2 months.\n\nHi Laverne, I am so happy that I happened onto your website. I am in the midst of learning card weaving and I came across your website. I finished my card weaving project and began instantly to gather the materials for my loom. All of which I had already in my garage, short of broom handles. I went to work the next day and came home with a bountiful supply of used broom handles. Now I am starting to go through your lesson plan. I have warped for my backstrap. I am so excited. On your Faq Index #13 , 14, 15 through the end of the list don’t link to anything. Is that because you are not done? Your attention to detail on your blog and tutorials are awe inspiring. I look forward to reading updates every day and check for new posts several times a day.\n\nBobbie\n\nHey Laverne, I’m in a bit of a pinch. My wife is experienced in all forms of fibers (spinning, knitting, etc…….all the usuals) and she’s been wanting to give a go at weaving. She’s mentioned backstrap looms in passing. I’m confident that she’ll be able to pick this up without too much trouble.\n\nSo…..now it’s Christmas time and I was thinking about making a backstrap loom (as well as a book) for her. I’m pretty handy with woodworking and it looks fairly straightforward. I was wonder about the actual width of the loom though. I think my wife is interested in tapestry-sized wall hangings. It seems like all of the looms I’ve seen are in the 6″ wide range. Would 12″ be too unwieldy? I’m assuming the width of the final product is limited by the loom width (correct me if I’m wrong). I guess what I’m wondering is…….is there an advantage to using a narrower loom as opposed to a wider one?\n\nThanks!\n\nHi My Dear Teacher Laverne !!\n\nI am going quiet good. Thanks again. I am still making cords but, after some more, would like to begin with wider pieces. It is really fun to wave. I am 41 and male but, to wave is over sex and I also spin wool too. In the near future, want to wave some fabrics from my own spun wool yarns. I am still afraid to wave wool but, I’ll try…\n\nI would like to ask two questions to you: First, may I use your designs to wave some bracelets and small nack bags and sell them? I can’t do this without your permission. Than, when I need may I writte and ask you? Or, if I writte and ask, do you bore?\n\nBest wishes.\n\nDevrim\n\nHi,\n\nI purchased two “antique quilt racks”…which my quilting friends and I knew were NOT quilt racks. But the two peices were so beautiful with wonderful carvings!!!!\n\nHave been researching on the internet to solve the mystery. We knew they were loom parts as we recognized the reeds, but we were only familiar with a table loom.\n\nSaw your blog with the picture of the Thai reed loom you were given as a gift and was thrilled!!!\n\nWhat I have are two Thai reed backstrap looms! They are identical to yours, except in size. They are 39 inches wide and 8 inches tall.\n\nI had planned to use them to display antique laces and baby clothes that I have, now I may have to learn to weave!!!!\n\nThis is such a unique loom! I have never seen anything like it…so lovely!\n\nThank You for posting the picture!!\n\nLinda\n\nI am a self taught weaver who has luckily owns a 4 harness floor loom, a small portable 4H table loom, and an ‘as yet’ tested tapestry loom. I guess you can tell I love everything weaving! I must say however, that my recent experimentation in backstrap weaving (prompted by your excellent basic beginners instructions, videos and photos), has lead me down a new path. There is something inexplicably satisfying about the backstrap weaving process…where the weaver is so intimately “tied” (in every sense of the word), to the creative process. “Weaver” alone, becomes the mechanism by which creativity, color or patterning, and a little bodily coordination seem to yield an insurmountable variety of textile possibilities. There is something truly “organic” about it…for I have found that this early on, (in my backstrap foray), that it involves mind, body and spirit in a way that I have not found in my weaving journey before. As a history buff, it also places me alongside weaving women who have practiced this form of weaving for generations, by simple means,and from simpler times. I am very grateful that you have shared your weaving journey with us, and that you continue to document techniques, patterns, equipment and styles of the indigenous South American people. I am hoping to inspire others in my neck of the woods, (Northern Canada), to ‘strap one on’ with me! Keep up the great work! Lorraine\n\nI recently got interested in weaving and your blog is constantly coming up in all my searches. I made my own backstrap loom after seeing the prices on other types of looms. After my first project I almost gave up on it (tried doing a weft faced weave and my warps wouldn’t stay spaced correctly). I realized I was starting on something a little too hard so I just did a plain warp faced weave in one color. I’m in love with it now and I plan to keep weaving with it. I absolutely love that I can take it places with me and I feel most comfortable using my feet to hold the end warp bar for tension. Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for all this information you took the time to compile for people like me. If your blog wasn’t here I’m not sure I could have figured it all out.\n\nApril 11, 2014\n\nDear Laverne,\n\nI have been enjoying your tutorials and passionate sharing of all these beautiful people, pieces and skills.\n\nI am not much of a weaver, but I love even dabbling in it.\n\nA few years ago, while I was at the Maryland Sheep and Wool Festival, I saw a purse from Peru that took my heart. But when I returned from asking a sales person more about it, someone else was purchasing it! I at least had the presence of mind to ask the purchaser for permission to photograph it, and she kindly consented.\n\nThe knitting (and perhaps crocheting of the flap edge) seems to be straight forward enough, but the strap is a mystery to me. I called the people who were selling it and they said it was braided on toes and fingers in a most complicated way. My first impression was that it was card woven, but I am no longer convinced. I have yet to try to duplicate it with card weaving.\n\nThen I came across your blog with the descriptions of the Ñawi Awapa, and thought it might be that, but I still wonder. It does not seem to have the same structure.\n\nI would like to send you the one photo I have of the strap (and bag). If you would look at it, would you please let me know how I may attach this jpeg file? Thank you.\n\nI would be very grateful to you for looking at it and letting me know how you think it was made, and – if possible – how to make it!\n\nI saw something that reminded me of it on your blog, a Bolivian amulet bag with a wonderful strap. Would you be able to tell me more about that strap, as well.\n\nThank you so much, Laverne, for all you share, and for looking at this.\n\nBest regards,\n\nVivian\n\nHello Laverne,\n\nI am a rigid heddle and inkle loom weaver. Now I want to start backstrap weaving as I am excited about its portability since my hubby and I spend our summers camping around the US. I do have a couple questions if you don’t mind. First I am planning to get your video on Taproot but I was also looking at your books, can any of the pattern books be worked on a backstrap loom? And second, If I am limited on space but want to do along band, can I roll up the warp on the back and release it as I roll up my woven section on the front? I am thinking then I can find a spot, secure the end opposite me to something and wind both ends as I work so I do not have to move as I work? I hope this makes sense.\n\nthank you\n\nAnja"
