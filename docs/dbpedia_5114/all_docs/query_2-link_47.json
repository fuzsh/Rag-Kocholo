        "text": "Dear Readers, The latest drama in purported radio obscenity again centers on a Clear Channel Communications program.\n\nInterestingly, it's also the show that replaced Bubba \"The Love Sponge\" Clem (who was fired by Clear Channel after incurring the wrath of the Federal Communications Commission and a $495,000 fine for \"indecent\" material) on Tampa's WXTB 98.7 FM -- \"The Monsters,\" whose hosts have been remanded into \"sensitivity training.\"\n\nYes, 98Rock hired Orlando's Monsters because of its humor, yet after a St. Petersburg Times story outlined the program's stereotypical (yet common for them) racial and homophobic slurs, a round of complaints caused Clear Channel to remove their live broadcasts.\n\nIt was airing thoroughly dissected \"Best of\" shows until their return, some say today.\n\nRadio Babe doesn't exactly disagree with Clear Channel, but she doesn't side with the Monsters, either -- she merely wonders where this, er, censoring will end . how long until station owners and management simply tell announcers exactly what's to be read, word-for-word? What's to prevent that from happening?\n\nEven fancy corporate machinery that controls broadcast delays can't prevent \"insensitive\" opinions from seeping through.\n\nMORE POWER -- Speaking of Clear Channel, its chairman, Lowry Mays, is top man on Radio Ink's \"40 Most Powerful People In Radio\" this year.\n\nIts president and chief operating officer/interim chief executive officer (and Lowry Mays' son), Mark Mays, follows in the second spot, while John Hogan, president and COO at Clear Channel Radio, sits in fourth place.\n\nInfinity Broadcasting's Chairman/CEO John Sykes is number three, while its president and COO Joel Hollander is number five.\n\nUnbelievably (or not), FCC chairman Michael Powell is only sixth \"most powerful.\" Cumulus Media's Chairman/CEO Lew Dickey made number seven. Clear Channel Communications' executive vice president and chief financial officer Randall Mays is eighth.\n\nEntercom President and COO David Field, ninth, and Emmis Communications' Chairman/CEO Jeff Smulyan, tenth, finish off the top ten.\n\nFor the entire list, see www.radioink.com/listingsEntry.asp?ID=108277&PT=radioinklists.\n\nJOY GAL -- Former \"Country 92-5\" WYUU co-host Carmen Brown from \"Dave and Carmen in the Mornings\" jumped to \"The Joy FM\" (WJIS 88.1 and 91.5 FMs).\n\nAfter eight years in the area's radio \"circuit,\" Brown is now the contemporary Christian station's new promotions director.\n\nSAT GETTIN' FAT -- Both satellite radio companies recently reported subscription milestones.\n\nThe biggest, XM Satellite Radio, surpassed 2 million members, signing a million since October -- in only eight months!\n\nIts president and CEO, Hugh Panero, forecasts 20 million by 2010. Sirius Satellite Radio is seriously chugging along, reporting more than 500,000 subscribers to its services.\n\nJoseph Clayton, Sirius' CEO, plans on 1 million by year's end.\n\nE-RADIO WEEKLY -- An e-mail from Sarasota poet Justin Spring, an originator of Soulspeak (spontaneous spoken words) reads:\n\n\"Nice article on 365. Thanks to some input from you a few years ago, I eventually found my way to 365. You can hear us by clicking on the URL in our signature at the bottom of this message. I would rate their service very good and easy to work with as a broadcaster.\"\n\nSpring refers to Live365.com, where one can become a broadcaster nearly as easily as listening to the media offerings on its 20,000 individual stations/channels.\n\nHis description followed: \"SOULSPEAK: The Outward Journey of the Soul . if you're broke, go to www.soulspeak.org and download both for FREE. If you have Broadband or DSL, RADIO SOULSPEAK has a sound like no other: www.live365.com/stations/soulspeakspring?play.\"\n\nDirect queries and comments to Radio Babe c/o the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, P.O.
