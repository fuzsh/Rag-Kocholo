        "text": "Hunger is a problem without borders. No one can truly understand the devastating physical and emotional impact of hunger unless they experience it. Lions Clubs International Foundation (LCIF) is empowering Lions to improve food access for all through investments in infrastructure and improved transportation systems that increase the capacity of food banks, feeding centers, and food distribution facilities. Through the LCIF Hunger Grant Program, Lions can support school-based feeding programs, food banks, feeding centers, and similar facilities that provide food to people when they need it most.\n\nLions extend a hand to kids going hungry\n\nHunger is a terrible reality for people of all ages, all around the world. In fact, more than 800 million people are going to bed without a meal on a regular basis. La Guajira, one of 32 departments of Colombia, is home to the Wayuu—Colombia’s largest indigenous group. The Wayuu people depended on access to the Ranchería River to grow their crops. However, in 2011, a nearby dam was built diverting the river away from the Wayuu and to neighboring municipalities. As a result, without access to water for their crops, nearly 5,000 Wayuu children died of malnutrition.\n\nWithout access to water for their crops, nearly 5,000 Wayuu children died of malnutrition.\n\nWith grant funding from LCIF, Lions responded to this urgent crisis through construction of six nutrition centers close to the Wayuu people, two of which have been fully constructed and open since December 2017. The centers are located near local schools, each built with a dining hall, a kitchen, space for food storage, and restroom facilities. Since the opening of these nutrition centers, hundreds of local Wayuu children have regular meals with the nutrition they need to grow into strong, healthy individuals.\n\nDid you know\n\nMore than 820 million people worldwide are chronically hungry, and the number has increased steadily in recent years. Lions are working to combat hunger, and LCIF is offering its support to make a large impact. With a LCIF Hunger grant, Lions can make an impact in many different ways. They can establish a school feeding program to ensure children have the proper nutrition so they can concentrate at school. They can establish community soup kitchen or pantries to provide food for those who are hungry. Lions can also purchase vehicles that deliver food to homebound seniors. The Hunger grant program will help Lions leverage their impact against food insecurity throughout the world.\n\nIn hopes that one day, no one will ever have to live without knowing when their next meal will come, please make a donation today.\n\nYes, I Want to Donate\n\nLCIF is the grant-making body empowering Lions to create greater impact in their communities and around the world. The vast majority of funding LCIF receives is from Lions; 100 percent of every donation supports Lions service through LCIF grants and programs.\n\nHunger is just one cause area supported by LCIF and Campaign 100: LCIF Empowering Service. With financial support from Lions and clubs worldwide, Campaign 100 is empowering Lions to increase service impact in vision, youth, disaster relief, and humanitarian efforts; fight the global epidemic of diabetes; and make important progress in the expanded cause areas of childhood cancer, hunger, and the environment.\n\nJamie Konigsfeld is a marketing content specialist at Lions Clubs International Foundation.
