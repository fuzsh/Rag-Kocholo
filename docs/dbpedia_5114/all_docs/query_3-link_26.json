        "text": "The isolation could be in a rural hamlet where it becomes a social action, where food is shared for as long as needed and to which anyone can come, according to what the Ouutsü decides. The Yonna dance is performed non-stop, at all times. The dancers spin around and there must be food offerings such as fiche with bread or arepa; coffee or chicha; goat stew or rice with guajiro beans, lots of food, an order from the Ouutsü. That way you keep the spirits contented—which is necessary for the ritual to have its effect.\n\nMIR: So as a Wayuu, do you believe someone can ask for help, or fight, from the supernatural realm, to solve specific problems in the everyday world?\n\nES: Naturally. You can ask the supernatural for help or to steer situations of conflict. That’s what happens with feuds between clans, family groups like the Ipuana in my case. If we want to know what’s the best way to act, we arrange a consultation and keep the interpretation in mind as a way to move forward. You can also get “antidotes,” that serve to drive problems away. There are lots of ways to do things.\n\nMIR: Who are your allies in the supernatural world? What natural or supernatural forces do you trust, or from which do you ask for support, in the realm of the unseen?\n\nES: My spirits, who somehow send signs through dreams or circumstances. I’ve learned to watch out for disturbances and to put a bit of red fabric beneath my pillow to ward them away. To take certain precautions against the uncommon. I believe a thread or a red scrap is a transmitter of energies. I’ve had uncommon experiences. Knowing my grandmother was a dreamer and understanding that because of that, this faculty can be handed down, has allowed me to interpret this in my own manner as a way of knowing how to act. Presenting this experience through art contributes to the land and strengthens Wayuu customs in the various spaces where I can share experiences. It means I can be consulted and can offer guidance.\n\nMIR: Why do the Wayuu believe we inhabit such different worlds? Put another way, why does it seem like we don’t understand you or your problems or that we can’t help you?"
