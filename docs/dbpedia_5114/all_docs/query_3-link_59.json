        "text": "Howdy! I’m Ginna the gringa, and I’m on a mission to explore all 32 departments of Colombia!\n\nWhen I first started this project, I knew Colombia was a country rich in cultural and natural diversity. But nothing could have prepared me for all the stories I would find as I drove my moto around the country (and broke my muffler multiple times in the process!)\n\nColombia is an extraordinary country, and not just for its snowy peaks and powdery beaches. It’s a country with a rich cultural identity – from traditional dance and music to delicious cuisine and coffee. Yes, it’s a country with a challenging past, but the pride, resilience, and passion of the Colombian people have made a tremendous effort to move the country into a new light, and I’m honored to be able to discover it.\n\nSo with all this in mind as I explore Colombia, I decided to keep a virtual journal here of my favorite discovery in each department. This could be a place, an activity, or even a dish, but consider it an ongoing record of the extraordinary diversity of Colombia, and proof that every department has something to offer.\n\nBut hey – before we get into it, I’m just one person! Let me know in the comments what your favorite thing is about your department.\n\nThis site uses affiliate links to share products that I use and love! If you click on one of the links I may receive a small commission at no additional cost to you.

Check out my full 3-week itinerary!\n\nATLÁNTICO – Attend Barranquilla Carnival\n\nBarranquilla Carnival is Colombia’s biggest party of the year, a celebration of coastal Colombian culture that can’t be missed!\n\nFrom dance to music to all-night-rumba, Barranquilla Carnaval is an extraordinary celebration of the diversity of the Colombian coast, combining afro Colombian, indigenous, and Spanish tradition that is present in the department of Atlántico. In fact, this colorful festival was declared a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity and is the second-largest Carnival celebration in the world, right after Rio de Janeiro.\n\nCarnival takes place yearly, usually in the months of February and March, though you can check upcoming dates here. I was actually able to be a part of the Batalla de Flores of Carnival 2024 — the most emblematic parade of the event!\n\nPerhaps it seems like an obvious choice in Atlántico, but there’s a reason millions of people flock in the masses to Barranquilla every year for this celebration. So grab your glitter and your aguardiente and get ready to celebrate everything that makes coastal Colombia amazing!\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO: The BIGGEST CARNIVAL in Colombia! | ATLÁNTICO – 4/32\n\nBOLÍVAR – Visit San Basilio de Palenque\n\nThe small, dusty town of San Basilio de Palenque might not look like a lot at first glance, but is one of the most extraordinary pieces of Colombian history, located in the department of Bolívar.\n\nThe town was founded by escaped slaves, who found refuge in the ciénagas (swamplands) outside of the city of Cartagena. For years, the town remained a secret, its hidden location communicated amongst the enslaved population through maps intricately woven into the braids of their hair.\n\nThis isolation allowed the town to develop independent from the culture on the Colombian coast, with many customs, foods, and even language heavily influenced by various African traditions. To this day, it’s often referred to as “Africa in Colombia.”\n\nBesides its unique culture, San Basilio de Palenque is also notable for being the first freed town in the Americas, established as a free town in 1603. It’s a vital piece of understanding afro Colombian history and tradition along the Caribbean coast, as well as an easy day trip from Cartagena. It’s easily one of the most incredible places I’ve seen on any of my travels, anywhere in the world.\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO: What to do in CARTAGENA (and beyond!) | BOLÍVAR – 5/32\n\nBOYACÁ – Drive the Ruta Navideña\n\nChristmas is a BIG DEAL in Colombia, and no department goes harder than Boyacá. It’s home to the famous Ruta Navideña — a collection of pueblos throughout the department that go all out for the Christmas season. If you’re visiting Colombia during the Christmas season, making this Christmas pilgrimage is a must.\n\nThe most famous route through Boyacá begins in the pueblo of Nobsa and continues through the towns of Corrales, Tibasosa, and Paipa. Most pilgrimages end with a visit to El Puente de Boyacá, the famous site of the final battle of the Colombian Revolution.\n\nYou can visit this route on your own, or join a tour, usually leaving from Bogotá or Boyacá’s capital city of Tunja. Make sure to come hungry and try as many of the Christmas treats as you can along the way — the buñuelos in Nobsa are famous for a reason!\n\nA couple other favorite treats we tried along the way were natilla, a milky custard flavored with arequipe, and canelazo, a hot drink made with brandy, cinnamon, panela, and of course, aguardiente! Part of the fun of the Ruta Navideña is the food, so come prepared to get in the Christmas spirit!\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO: The BEST PLACE to Spend Christmas in Colombia | BOYACÁ – 1/32\n\nCESAR – Visit the Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata\n\nThe Department of Cesar is the birthplace of Vallenato music, so there’s no better event to visit than the Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata! This annual festival celebrates all that makes Vallenato unique — from it’s indigenous roots to it’s African influences to the musical instrument at it’s core, the accordion!\n\nThe Vallenato festival takes places annually in the spring in the capital city of Valledupar. There’s a lot to see and do during the festival, from concerts to parades to day trips to the homes of famous Vallenatos. People flock from around Colombia and beyond to experience the festival, and some of Vallenatos biggest names also visit the city in order to be a part of the celebrations. It’s truly a can’t-miss event in this region.\n\nVallenato was born in the department of Cesar, and even during the off-season of the Vallenato Festival the city is buzzing with Vallenato fans and musicians alike. Trios gather on street corners to play their favorite Vallenato songs, murals cover the city telling the stories of the genre, and Vallenato is truly the heart and soul of the region.\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO: The Biggest VALLENATO FESTIVAL in the World! | CESAR – 10/32\n\nCÓRDOBA – Learn about Sombrero Vueltiaos\n\nThe department of Córdoba is the birthplace of the Sombrero Vueltiao, the black and white hat that has become a national symbol of Colombia. While you can find hats for sale throughout the region, there’s no better place to learn the history and process than Tuchín, the unofficial birthplace of the sombrero vueltiao.\n\nThe sombrero vueltiao is made from caña flecha, a plant native to the coastal regions of Colombia that is processed, braided, and dyed before being woven into a number of products. The sombrero vueltiao might be the most iconic of the bunch, but you’ll also find bags, earrings, and practically anything you can imagine.\n\nThe streets of Tuchín are lined with artisans crafting caña flecha products at all times of day, so make sure to stop in and take a look for yourself! Or better yet, visit a local finca where the process is done from start to finish. I was able to visit Finca Las Palmas, one of the fincas associated with Sombvueltio during my time in Córdoba, but I highly recommend asking around in Tuchín, as the entire area is filled with artisans and fincas dedicated to the craft!\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO: I MILKED A BUFFALA in Montería | CÓRDOBA – 7/32\n\nLA GUAJIRA – Visit Punta Gallina\n\nPunta Gallina, or “the end of the world,” isn’t just the northernmost point in Colombia, but in all of South America! It’s home to otherwordly landscapes that closer resemble Mars than anywhere else I’d visited in Colombia, and is a must-do for any adventure traveler.\n\nThe department of La Guajira is the indigenous homeland of the Wayuu people, and the desert landscapes hold a special significance for the people in the region. Each territory is owned by a specific clan, and land is passed down through the maternal side of the family. Due to the challenging conditions of these arid desert landscapes, the Wayuu people were one of the only indigenous groups in Colombia not to be fully evangelized by the Spanish, and resultantly, many indigenous traditions live on throughout the department.\n\nI highly recommend visiting Punta Gallina from Cabo de la Vela, a town in La Guajira Alta that serves as the best jumping off point for excursions deeper into the desert. You can reserve a guided tour in a vehicle, or trek out into the desert on the back of a motorcycle like I did! Whatever route you chose, this is sure to be one of the most extraordinary adventures you’ll find in Colombia.\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO: Welcome to the END OF THE WORLD | LA GUAJIRA – 8/32\n\nMAGDALENA – Hike to the Ciudad Perdida\n\nMagdalena’s Ciudad Perdida is not for the faint of heart — we’re talking 4-5 days of trekking through the jungle. But the reward is worth it, the remains of an ancient city once built by the Precolombian Tairona people, estimated to be more than 700 years older than Machu Picchu. Add in stunning mountain views, indigenous traditions, and a number of chilly mountain streams, and you’re in for one of the biggest adventures in Colombia.\n\nLocated high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the area surrounding La Ciudad Perdida is the ancestral homeland of four indigenous groups — the Kogi, the Wiwa, the Arahuaco, and the Kankuamo. These groups still have a major presence in the area, especially at La Ciudad Perdida. Taking a hike to the city is one of the most unique ways to learn about these cultures in a respectful way, as well as support the restoration efforts taking place to maintain the city.\n\nHikes to La Ciudad Perdida are often 3, 4, or 5 days treks, depending on your speed and skill level. We did a 4-day trek with Magic Tour Colombia which I highly recommend.\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO: We Hiked Four Days Through the Jungle… For This! | MAGDALENA – 9/32\n\nQUINDÍO – Hike in the Valle de Cocora\n\nQuindío‘s Cocora Valley feels like stepping into another world. It’s home to the largest concentration of Palmas de Cera in the country — Colombia’s National Tree and the tallest palm tree in the world, often growing up to 60 meters tall.\n\nThe Valle de Cocora is home to a number of hiking trails, or visitors can even explore the area on horseback. Besides Palmas de Cera, the valley is also home to a diverse number of bird species, including a hummingbird sanctuary deep within the valley. It’s one of the most unique landscapes not just in Colombia but in the world.\n\nThe Valle de Cocora has become a popular spot along the tourist trail in recent years, but I highly recommend wandering past the photo ops deeper into the valley for some of the most incredible sights. No matter where you turn, you’ll be rewarded with absolutely stunning mountain views, spotted with towering Palmas de Cera.\n\nFor the true Valle de Cocora experience, I highly recommend staying the night in the colorful nearby town of Salento and riding a Jeep Willy into the valley — one of the most unique experiences in the coffee region!\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO: Exploring Colombia’s COFFEE REGION and Valle de Cocora | QUINDÍO – 2/32\n\nSAN ANDRÉS – Visit Providencia Island\n\nColombia’s department of San Andrés is actually made up of three islands — San Andrés, Providencia, and Santa Catalina. While San Andrés is the most visited, the tranquil, untouched shores of Providencia are truly one of the most extraordinary places I’ve ever seen.\n\nYet to be dominated by beach resorts and tiki bars, Providencia Island embodies the true essence of island life in the Caribbean, from the reggae music drifting over the wide beaches to the towering green peaks ripe with sugarcane. The locals of Providencia are deeply proud of their island home — as seen in their resilience post-Hurricane Iota but also in the deep sense of community that exists on the island (it’s home to just over 5,000 residents after all!)\n\nIf you’re looking for a true island paradise, there’s certainly no other place in the world like Providencia Island. It’s a disconnect from the outside world, a place rooted in the deep pride of the local culture, history, and tradition. I truly believe there’s no other place like it — in Colombia or the world.\n\nI’ve actually written more in depth guides to both Providencia Island and San Andres Island, so go check them out if you want to plan your own trip!\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO: Colombia has CARIBBEAN ISLANDS? | SAN ANDRÉS & Providencia – 3/32\n\nSUCRE – Watch the Sunset in Rincón del Mar\n\nSucre is one of the most diverse departments in Colombia, home to 5 distinct regions each with their own unique cultures, foods, and stories. While many flock to the department’s capital of Sincelejo for the annual corralejas — or bullfights — the Caribbean Coast of Sucre truly stole my heart. Specifically, the epic sunsets in the beachside town of Rincón del Mar.\n\nHome to the Reserva Natural Sanguare, Rincón del Mar is home to a diverse number of species and landscapes — from winding tunnels through the mangroves to countless colorful birds that call them home. Take a boat from the beach for the best sunset views and then swim with the bioluminescent plankton once the sun goes down. It literally feels like swimming in the stars.\n\nBesides epic sunsets, Rincón del Mar is a great beach spot along the Atlantic coastline that has yet to see some of the hyper-tourism of beaches closer to Cartagena and Barranquilla. It’s a great place to spend a few days, coconut in hand!\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO: Inside Colombia’s BULL FIGHTING Culture | SUCRE – 6/32\n\nKeep Exploring Colombia\n\nI’ll be updating this post as I travel around Colombia, but if you’re looking to plan your own trip to el país de la belleza, I’ highly recommend checking everything I’ve written about Colombia, I’ve also written more in-depth guides to all corners of Colombia!
