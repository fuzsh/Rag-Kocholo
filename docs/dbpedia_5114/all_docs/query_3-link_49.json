        "text": "Night had already fallen as the reporter Isayen Herrera and I drove through stretches of plains in eastern Venezuela last November. As we came around a bend in the road, the sky suddenly filled with light. Everything around us was tinted orange.\n\nOur destination was Punta de Mata, a modest city that from space is one of the brightest spots in South America. Gas flares from oil wells neglected by PDVSA, the state oil company, emit light and send huge quantities of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The emissions rain down as an oily residue, polluting homes and farms.\n\nWe were there to report an article for The New York Times and speak with residents who said they lived on poisoned land and complained of respiratory problems. We also wanted to witness life in a place without the darkness of night.\n\nI have always felt that these kinds of stories — the ones that feel otherworldly, magical and, more often than not, heartbreaking — best explain Venezuela. And they are why I returned to the country in 2017 to work as a photojournalist.\n\nI was born in Venezuela in 1988, and raised during what was then called a revolution. President Hugo Chávez, first elected in 1999, introduced a series of social welfare programs intended to reduce economic inequality. He funded the programs with Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. There was social change but also increasing violence and upheaval in the country’s political order, which Mr. Chávez came to rule with absolute power.\n\nI left Venezuela in 2015 to study journalism in the United States. In the two years I was away at school, my country descended into a humanitarian crisis. The oil boom that had fueled government spending had ended. Desperation spread as basic services failed. Hospitals ran out of medicine, and food shortages became so severe that armed guards accompanied delivery trucks.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
