        "text": "Cleveland Wheeler has left oldies U92 (WYUU-FM 92.5) as morning host after his contract, due to expire March 4, was not renewed. Wheeler, a veteran of Tampa Bay area radio since 1978 (WRBQ's old Q Morning Zoo), said Monday that he does not foresee a return to local radio. \"I'll be around to play again if somebody calls,\" he said.\n\nWheeler's other Tampa Bay radio stop was at country station WQYK (1995-96). He was out of the area from 1991 to 1995. A permanent morning replacement has not been hired, said Mark Gullett, director of marketing and promotion at U92. Entercom, U92's parent company, is making room for WYUU sibling WISP-FM 98.7, to share the St. Petersburg headquarters. An easy-listening station based in Holmes Beach, WISP will upgrade to serve a wider area.\n\nElsewhere . . .\n\nA shake-up in management at Clear Channel Communications local stations (FMers WSJT 94.1, WMTX 95.7, WILV 101.5, WHPT 102.5, WRBQ 104.7; AMers WHNZ 570, WZTM 820, WRBQ 1380) leaves no one, at least temporarily, to officially comment. A receptionist at the Point et al in St. Petersburg confirmed the departure of Drew Rashbaum, general manager of the Point, Smooth Jazz, Love 101.5, the Team and WHNZ. Dave Manning, until now in command at Clear Channel's WRBQ and WMTX in Tampa, said Monday he is moving to Tallahassee to run five Clear Channel properties.\n\nWQYK-AM talker has added Tampa Tribune columnist Dan Ruth to its weekday lineup. He replaced the taped replay of G. Gordon Liddy from 2 to 3 p.m.\n\nPerhaps otherwise overshadowed by Devil Rays hoopla, WZTM-AM 820 will broadcast its first New York Yankees game of 1998 at 1:15 p.m. Friday when the Detroit Tigers visit Legends Field in Tampa. WZTM program director Rob Weingarten will call the play by play."
