        "text": "In October 2022, CDP provided a $200,000 grant to the Wayuu Taya Foundation, which supports the Indigenous Wayuu people located primarily along the Guajira Peninsula on the Colombia and Venezuela border. Through this grant, CDP worked with Wayuu Taya to develop an entrepreneurial model for sustainable water solutions that will continue generating income and allow them to build wells in remote indigenous communities, schools and health care centers along the border for years.\n\nThis grant is the second CDP grant to Wayuu Taya. The first grant, for $100,000 in 2020, had an outsized impact. Wayuu Taya Foundation’s President, Patricia Velasquez, attributes much of their success – shown in this video – to that first grant to build their first well, from which their other programming, including sustainable water, agricultural farming, training programs and school hygiene programs stemmed. After CDP’s initial grant, the Wayuu TayaFoundation was able to leverage this to secure more partnerships with many other international funders. This demonstrates what a huge impact can come from even small investments in organizations seeking to implement local, long-term solutions in their communities.\n\nCDP provided a $250,000 grant in August 2022 to International Medical Corps from its COVID-19 Response Fund to improve COVID-19 vaccine access in remote Indigenous communities in the Cedeño municipality of Bolívar state in Venezuela by providing logistics support to transport and store vaccines, donating equipment to hospitals to store vaccines; strengthening the capacity of local vaccinators; and raising awareness about COVID-19 vaccines through community activities.\n\nSimón Bolívar Foundation Inc., the nonprofit private foundation of CITGO Petroleum Corporation, awarded seven organizations $1.68 million in grant funding as part of its Colombia-Ecuador-Peru Humanitarian Health Grants program in November 2022. These grants were designed to support projects addressing “the health needs of the vulnerable migrant community and host populations in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru … The projects are estimated to benefit more than 30,000 people in need, including mothers and children, train more than 300 health professionals and provide more than 270,000 healthy and nutritious meals.”\n\nThe Ford Foundation has made several grants to support work in Venezuela, including a $2 million, two-year grant in 2022 to the Pan Health America Organization to increase equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and diagnostic and clinical care for populations in situations of vulnerability in the Americas. They also provided a $500,000 grant in 2021 to People in Need to create a Venezuelan Resilience Fund to enable civil society organizations and human rights defenders in Venezuela to overcome the challenges generated by closing civic space and the consequences of COVID-19. A 13-month grant of $110,000 was made in 2021 to openDemocracy Limited to expand coverage and reporting on the Venezuelan crisis, including the closing of civic space, the migration exodus and the consequences of the complex humanitarian emergency on vulnerable populations of ethnic communities and women. A grant in 2020 for $90,000 to Grupo de Trabajo Socioambiental de la Amazonía, Wataniba, supported the protection of the rights of the Yanomami and Uwottja People as they struggle against the effects of illegal mining, COVID-19 and the Venezuelan humanitarian crisis.\n\nSince 2017, U.S. foreign assistance in response to the crisis in Venezuela has totaled $2.9 billion in humanitarian aid. In addition to $376 million in aid in September 2022, the Biden Administration announced nearly $451 million in humanitarian assistance to support those affected by the Venezuelan regional crisis in November 2023. This new assistance will provide direct relief for those in the country and support Venezuelan refugees and migrants in host communities across the region.\n\nDuring the Mexico City negotiations in November 2022, the Maduro administration and the opposition party had agreed “to create a $3 billion social fund drawn from various Venezuelan seized assets to invest in education, healthcare and infrastructure repairs. The UN will be in charge of distributing the money while a Venezuelan joint commission would follow and verify its correct implementation.”\n\nIn October 2023, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres approved for the UN to start administering the new fund to address emergency needs in Venezuela. The fund is estimated to be progressively unfrozen, starting with $600 million. The latest rollback of sanctions relief by the U.S. could impact the status and administration of the UN fund.\n\nThe 2024 HRP is only 1.6% funded, requiring an additional $607.4 million. The Government of Switzerland is the largest single donor, covering 3.7% of the funding requirement.\n\nBy the first half of 2023, Venezuela’s HRP was the second most underfunded globally, with just 14% of the required funding. After advocacy work by humanitarian partners with donors, the HRP was 52% funded by the end of the year.\n\nThe 2024 RMRP has reached 2.1 million out of the targeted 3.41 million people as of March 5, 2024, and stands at 22.1% funded ($378 million out of $1.72 billion)."
