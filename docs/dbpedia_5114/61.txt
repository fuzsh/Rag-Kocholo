Beasley Broadcast Group said Thursday that it is acquiring six FM radio stations in the Tampa Bay area as part of a larger station swap with CBS Radio.

Through the swap, Beasley will also acquire seven stations in Charlotte, N.C., and one AM station in Philadelphia. In return, CBS Radio will get two FM stations in Philadelphia and three stations in Miami, where CBS already owns two television stations.

Pending regulatory approval, Beasley will take over these Tampa Bay area stations: WHFS-AM 1010, WHFS-FM 98.7, WLLD-FM 94.1, WQYK-FM 99.5, WRBQ-FM 104.7 and WYUU-FM 92.5.

Based in Naples, Beasley owns 44 stations — 28 FM and 16 AM — in 11 large and midsize markets nationwide and has 7.1 million weekly listeners.

The deal was expected to close by the end of the year and involves no exchange of money.
