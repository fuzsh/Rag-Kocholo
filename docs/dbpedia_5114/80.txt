Beasley Media Group’s Director of Latin Formats Nio Fernandez has renewed a multiyear deal to continue his oversight of all Latino brands for the company while continuing his programming duties at 92.5 Maxima (WYUU) in Tampa.

Fernandez took the national role in 2021. Beasley operates three Spanish CHR stations in Atlanta and Tampa along with a Tropical Latin format in Ft. Myers, FL.

Beasley Tampa Market Manager Ron deCastro said, “The most important part of building the only Multi-Cultural cluster in Tampa is finding and keeping the best people. Nio is an important figure in the Hispanic and overall Tampa community. He understands this area like no one else. I am glad that we can keep Nio at Maxima, Playa and Beasley into the future.”

Nio Fernandez added, “2024 marks my 15th year with WYUU in Tampa and working closely with Beasley Media Group on the expansion of their Hispanic footprint has been one of the great honors of my life. The commitment the organization has made to serve Spanish Language audiences is an important one and I am proud to contribute and work alongside the Beasley’s in every way possible.”
