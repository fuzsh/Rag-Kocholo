        "text": "I want to insert a video clip that I took with my digital camera into a PowerPoint file. The movie is in the QuickTime format, which doesn't work with my version of PowerPoint for Windows. Is there a way to make this work?\n\nMicrosoft's PowerPoint for Windows does not play nicely with most versions of Apple's QuickTime multimedia software, but there are at least a couple of ways to get your camera's movie clip working in your PowerPoint presentation.\n\nOne way is to convert the QuickTime clip into a format like AVI that works with the Windows version of PowerPoint. While QuickTime Pro can do this for you, upgrading from the free QuickTime Player to the more full-featured edition of the software costs $30.\n\nA Web search for \"quicktime to avi\" or \".mov to .avi\" brings up plenty of downloadable software, and most shareware sites have a few video-conversion programs on hand. (When downloading software from the Web, it's a good idea to have fully updated anti-virus and spyware programs installed on your computer.)\n\nOne free program that may work for you is the RAD Video Tools at www.radgametools.com/binkhlp2.htm. You can find a detailed explanation of how to use the software on the Pain in the Tech site at snipurl.com/2e51q. The open-source program MediaCoder (mediacoder.sourceforge.net) may also work for you.\n\nAnother option is to create a hyperlink in PowerPoint and point it back to the QuickTime movie file. When you are displaying your presentation, you can click the link to fire up the clip in the free Windows QuickTime Player. You can find Microsoft's instructions on creating hyperlinks in PowerPoint at snipurl.com/2e54b. If you don't have the free QuickTime Player for Windows, you can get it at www.apple.com/quicktime.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
