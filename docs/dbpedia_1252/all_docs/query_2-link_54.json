File \"Tkinter.pyc\", line 1448, in wm_iconbitmap _tkinter.TclError: bitmap \"media\\pwytter.ico\" not defined\n\nGive me a moment. I'll check something. Yup, that's it, just add a SetOutPath \"$EXEDIR\\App\\pwytter\" before each ExecWait. Did you try it before releasing. ;P\n\nAnd now for the rest of the usuals. I'll go create a Twitter account after this.\n\nhelp.html -> General Pwytter Issues is bulletless.\n\nhelp.html -> 'Go to the MediaCoder Portable Homepage >>'\n\nFTR, all apps are going full out case for all directories now App\\'Appname', John mentioned it in the Specs thread too.\n\nWe need to think of a standard to & Contributors, and contributors, and Contributors, etc. The menu about uses & Contributors, but the installer uses and contributors. I like & Contributors.\n\nOther\\Source\\Readme.txt is for MediaCoder.\n\nYou have a lot of unneeded includes. I think all of them, actually.\n\nappinfo.ini -> I do not believe Multimedia is a category.\n\nWe'll need to add in the language switching by Environment Variable, I can help!\n\nThat's it! Nicely done, and nice app choice. I hope it doesn't get be hooked on Twitter.\n\nJust installed 0.8 Test 2 on my micro Cruzer drive.\n\nI can not manage to get the portable app to start with my personal Twitter username/password. The contents of the pwytter.xml are not being picked up. I am assuming there must be some sort of path error in the INI or somewhere but I have not been smart enough to chase it down.\n\nTwitter changed their API around a few days ago, and if I'm correct Pwytter will no longer work. The Pwytter website looks rather dead, so I'm going to have to abandon this project until anyone can find a good open source Twitter client. The actual Twitter site will have to suffice for now, unfortunately.\n\njust loaded it for the first time just a few minutes ago, and it worked fine for me, i use vista, on this specific computer which is not my own, its home premium, and loaded fine, no errors, and love it so far...very nice theme, the black one... i will definately be using this quite often when im at school...ROFL...heres hoping its not blocked, so in case it is, if you can and might consider it, could you possible configure it to run using a proxy maybe... just a thought... and if you could also make it so that you can view twitter somehow within it, like maybe using a tab... i dont know, but i think that might be nice...your choice...\n\noverall i love the app so far...GREAT WORK..\n\n5/5\n\nIt really look promising... Still now works fine... I hope that in future it will have functionality like TweetDeck or Seesmic\n\nNow I'm using TweetDeck for normal use and Pwytter for testing... So will update if will have any issues.\n\nEDIT: Does anybody is still working on this app?"
