        "text": "1 . Â What does the package include?\n\nYouâll get the source code of ready-made PHP software with customizable features, and a license to use and install the software. With a Commercial License, youâll be allowed to launch your AI SaaS business quickly and start generating revenue fast.\n\n2 . Â Is this a website template?\n\nNo, itâs not just a template. Itâs a customizable, ready-made software built in PHP. You can install it on your server and start a SaaS business in a day. The software includes everything you need to run a successful SaaS business.\n\n3 . Â How often is the software updated?\n\nWe typically release new features once or twice a month. After each major release, we provide updates every 2-3 days to address bug fixes and improvements.\n\n4 . Â What is the difference between a Personal and a Commercial License?\n\nThe main difference lies in the use cases and legal permissions. The Personal License is intended solely for personal use, development, and testing purposes, and cannot be used to monetize the app. If you intend to earn money from the app, you will need a Commercial License.\n\n5 . Â Which license do I need to monetize the software (SaaS)?\n\nTo monetize the software, you will need a Commercial License.\n\n6 . Â Can I use a single license on multiple domains?\n\nNo, each license can only be used on one domain in production. If you want to install the app on multiple domains, you will need to obtain a separate license for each domain.\n\n7 . Â Can I get a refund?\n\nAll sales are final. To ensure Aikeedo is right for you, we are happy to answer any questions you may have before purchasing. Additionally, we provide a live, up-to-date demo where you can familiarize yourself with and test the features. You can access the demo at demo.aikeedo.com.\n\n8 . Â Do you offer support?\n\nYes, each license includes 6 months of free support during which you can reach out to us with any questions. Additionally, we provide detailed documentation and frequent updates to assist you.\n\n9 . Â What does the 6-month support include?\n\nThe 6-month support includes our availability to answer all your questions regarding the app. We generally reply to all emails within a few hours; however, depending on the volume of support requests, response times may take up to 2 business days. Please note that support does not include customization or installation of the software.\n\n10 . Â Will I receive updates after my 6-month support expires?\n\nYes, regardless of your support status, you will receive all lifetime updates for free.\n\n11 . Â How can I get support?\n\nYou can get support by reaching out to us via email at support@aikeedo.com."
