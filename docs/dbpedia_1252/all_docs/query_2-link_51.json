        "text": "I have been running a media server for years, and would disagree with your sentiment on compression. I can get my 40+ GB BR down to around 15 GB with hi-fi audio without any noticeable decrease in quality. If you want to compress audio, you can easily get them to 5-8 without noticeable quality loss. That has been my experience, but it obviously depends on your computer's processing capabilities, how many times you pass through and remuxing. Depending on your library, that might be something to consider in the future.\n\nNot having EVER even tried to rip a blu ray before today I will defer to your expertiese on the entire matter LOL! all I have found is that it is not nearly as easy as ripping DVDs and is enough of a pain in the ass to make me decide to put off ripping them until I get done in Afghanistan, whether it is in a year (minimum) or 3 or 4 years.\n\nright now my computer I am using is an alienware M17x with 8GBs of memory. my desk top is still running xp but has a faster processor but less memory so an upgrade may be in order before I start on the blu ray stuff.\n\nAs for ripping, I like Slysoft's AnyDVD HD for full ripping. You can, essentially, drag and drop the folders with it. Post-processing options are limitless after that.\n\nI will take a look at that as well. sounds like more along what I was thinking of.\n\nBy the way, what type of software configuration are you running to keep things backed up? I have some good solutions, if you're interested.\n\nright now I have everything on smaller transportable 1tb wd passports. each drive has a back up companion drive and I have a Pelican case that contains them all. Data drive back ups, photo drive, and the rest are movies and TV shows. I know it is not the preferred method but it worked well in iraq and will suit my needs in afghanistan as well. the media server is going to have to wait till I get done in Afghan now because I don't want to buy stuff now only to have it seriously obsoleted by the time I get done. so I am really not sure what direction I am going to take.\n\nGood luck! Media servers are a great tool.\n\nthanks and I agree. I was hoping to have one up and running by now but I am going to have to do some serious research on what is available when I come back and will hit you up then for more advice.\n\nWell, software options are really so prolific anymore, that you can decide for yourself which interface you prefer. Take a look at some of the selections that others have recommended, and let us know what you decide to go with. As I said, AnyDVD HD is nice because they quickly update their software for the new DRM signatures. I'm not too familiar with others because it has worked for me, but I am sure there are other (possibly, even free) alternatives that will suit your needs just fine.\n\nAs for the data management, I will tell you what I decided on after months of learning and planning (for reference, my setup currently has ~7TB of secured data on it, so it's a relatively small media center): I am running a NAS4Free server in a ZFS software raid system. There are multiple parity options, but the one I have will allow one total drive failure and can resilver any lost data once a new drive of equal size has been entered. It has worked awesome for me because it is designed for high-data management and has options for drive scrubbing and SMART checks. They can all be run automatically and a daily status report can be sent to you via email. At anytime, the entire array can be increased in size, but that can only be done if every hard drive is replaced with the new, larger size (i.e. you could go from 4x1TB to 4x3TB and it will handle the resilvering for you). You are also able to control this entire system from the web, anywhere. Some basic port-forwarding (I am sure you are familiar with the DMZ options in routers, considering your location), and you will be able to access your media anywhere, with any device. You probably won't get away with streaming unless your connection is strong, but you can still download things onto your various devices (you will have your own cloud). Lastly, if you have this setup on a home network (or work, in your case), you can set access codes and restrictions on everything. You can give yourself full access on your laptops/tablets/phones and you can give restricted access to others on your network, limiting them to either read-only, read/write or neither. Linux commands are really basic and you can batch the permissions for everything. If this is beyond your desired scope, you can just leave it as a media server and keep it off the network--still awesome. There's the alternative of skipping NAS4Free if you want, and you can just run a system in a hardware RAID config with W7 and use XBMC like that. Not quite as diverse, but will still do the job and keep your data from being lost if a failure occurs. Of course, the HD health options aren't there, and the design isn't quite as good as ZFS, but it is still a good option if you don't want to mess with N4F.\n\nFrom there, I built a small HTPC that runs W7 basic, but I have it set for XBMC to be the automatic boot skin. I'm not sure how familiar you are with XBMC, but it is extremely versatile and handles media like no other interface I have used. It will scrape all of your movies/TV shows and offer you IMDB ratings, fan art, synopses and keep track of what you've watched. There are even options to have new media automatically downloaded each week, if you're into torrents. It makes it so you never have to leave XBMC, as it will show you everything about all of your media. There is also some sweet apps for your cell phone or tablet that will allow you to control the whole thing.\n\nAs for your BR rig: I have a i5 OC'd to 4Ghz and 16Gb of ram. The ram is overkill for BR applications, so you should be fine with 8. Also, I have a Radeon GFX card that allows its CPU to be utilized in the converting/encoding, which helps a bit. You may want to look into it. Mostly, this is CPU intensive work, so the better the CPU, the less time you will spend encoding. If you're just straight ripping, that's really only up to the size of your specimen and the speed of your drive. Any system can handle that. The encoding is what takes the time.\n\nSorry for the retarded-long post. Just wanted to cover as much as possible. Let me know if you have any other questions/concerns.\n\nI am actually about to buy a fully loaded mac book pro once I get the final OK to deploy to Afghanistan. will have 16gb of ram and 758GB solid state HD. for things like this I will likely use the mac versions. I will dual boot it to windows 8 most likely so I can avoid having to buy a bunch of duplicate programs like office and what not.\n\nI'll upload the files and pm you the link, and then you don't need to buy the software.\n\n:beer:\n\nfyi, if you want to speed up the blu-ray rip process...purchase the fastest blu-ray writer you can afford.\n\nthat will cut the time down substantially.\n\nSearch Results for external blu ray at MacSales.com\n\noh on your MBPro...here's a tip. get the minimum ram and the minimum HD size when you order it from Apple.\n\nthen go to Performance Upgrades; FireWire USB SATA Storage; Memory, more at OWC\n\nand get your memory for significantly less than what Apple will charge you.

Keep the original HD for a spare in case something goes wrong.\n\nI stuck 16GB from macsales in my 27\" iMAC...cost me $100.\n\nI stuck a pair of 4GB sticks in my MBPro...cost me $50.\n\nif you upgrade through Apple, they'll charge you $250-$400+ to get a full 16GB. **** that!\n\nand of course...get the screwdriver kit. you'll need it.

The\n\nHd is solid state and on the motherboard so getting it smaller and upgrading is not an option. I wanted the most powerful I could get while maintaining a light weight for traveling. There are some potential downsides to having it integrated on the MB but hopefully it won't give me fits while I am overseas. Once I get my final confirmation of having the job I can qualify for the military discount so will get it at a pretty decent price.\n\nI'll upload the files and pm you the link, and then you don't need to buy the software.\n\n:beer:\n\nfyi, if you want to speed up the blu-ray rip process...purchase the fastest blu-ray writer you can afford.\n\nthat will cut the time down substantially.\n\nSearch Results for external blu ray at MacSales.com\n\noh on your MBPro...here's a tip. get the minimum ram and the minimum HD size when you order it from Apple.\n\nthen go to Performance Upgrades; FireWire USB SATA Storage; Memory, more at OWC\n\nand get your memory for significantly less than what Apple will charge you.
