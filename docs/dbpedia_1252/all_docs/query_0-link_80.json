        "text": "MediaCoder 0.8.47 comes with native 10-bit pixel depth support. 3 color space options were added:\n\nI420 10-bit,\n\nI422 10-bit\n\nI444 10-bit\n\nFormerly in MediaCoder, 10bpp video content are down scaled to 8bpp for processing. The native 10-bit pixel depth support is ideal for transcoding 10bpp content to 10bpp output. Currently only x264 and NVENC support 10bpp input. When encoding 10bpp H.264, make sure to choose correct profile on x264 tab.\n\nRead the rest of this entry >>\n\nMediaCoder 0.8.46 is released, with support for NVENC 7.0 and Intel MSDK 2016. Try some ultrafast H.264 and HEVC encoding with your cutting-edge GPU! Make sure to update your graphic driver to latest.\n\nMediaCoder 0.8.41 is released with NVENC 6.0. Two-pass encoding can be used with NVENC in MediaCoder now. Simply set video encoder to NVENC and rate mode to Two-Pass and you are ready to go. In advanced settings, you can find new option for 3 types of NVENCâ€™s two-pass mode.\n\nWhatâ€™s New in NVIDIA Video Codec SDK 6.0\n\nNVIDIA Video Codec SDK 6.0 adds following new features.\n\nUnified SDK for video encoding and decoding\n\nWindows 10 official support\n\nSupport for H.264 Motion Estimation only mode\n\nSupport for input surfaces in RGB format\n\nSupport for SEI and VUI fields for H.265\n\nSupport for Adaptive Quantization for improved subjective visual quality with H.265 (adaptive quantization for H.264 is already supported)\n\nGPUs supported for H.265 (HEVC) encoding\n\nGeForce GTX 960, GTX 980. GTX Titan X\n\nQuadro M4000, M5000, M6000\n\nTesla M4, M6, M60\n\nVarious quality and performance improvements in encoding\n\nSDK samples no longer require the CUDA toolkit installed in order to build.\n\nMediaCoder 0.8.37 is released. In this release, the NVENC encoding bitrate control issue in ABR and CQP rate mode, which has been reported by many users who use NVENC to encode H.265/HEVC, is finally fixed. Other updates include upgrade of x264 and x265. MPlayer and MEncoder for x64 have also been updated to latest SVN revision. From this release, MediaCoder is built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\n\nIn this release, 2-pass and 3-pass H.265 encoding have been added, and not many changes besides some routine update of codecs and minor bug fix. Anyway I know many people are demanding for the multiple-pass H.265 encoding. ðŸ˜‰\n\nAs always, head for the download page for the latest version."
