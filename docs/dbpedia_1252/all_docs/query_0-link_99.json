        "text": "For all the encoding nuts, MediaCoder has you covered. Latest version 0.8.52 has improved 10-bit color depth encoding. If you happen to have some 10bpp video contents and a powerful box, you can do some insanely highly quality 10bpp HEVC transcoding with x265 and NVENC (requires Geforce GTX 10XX). Just change “Color Space” option from default I420 to I420 10-bit or I444 10-bit and you are ready to go.\n\nThe year 2018 is coming very soon. It will be the 13th year since MediaCoder was born in 2005. Time flies and it is still getting better! Let’s all keep up in the new year."
