        "text": "I've set up OBS Studio on a Windows 10 (64 bit) machine to capture a conference using a Logitech webcam.\n\nI chose the X264 codec (software) and the MKV container.\n\nBefore actually recording the conference, I shot a few short videos (less than one minute) to confirm all was working. These videos were playable in my media player (PotPlayer) without problems so I assumed the actual recording would go down well.\n\nWe recorded the entire conference and ended up with a 2.3 GB MKV file. I've tried to play this file with a handful of media players, to no avail. The video won't play. PotPlayer displays an unknown codec error; VLC just refuses to play the video.\n\nI've also noticed that the MKV file has no thumbnail preview, whereas the short test videos I'd made with the same settings did have it.\n\nWhat can have happened? How can I play back this video?\n\nHere is the error I get when trying to play the video in PotPlayer:\n\n---\n\nAsync Reader::Output\n\n==========================\n\nUnable to read audio/video data (caption translated from Italian)\n\n==========================\n\nMedia Type 0:\n\n--------------------------\n\nUnknown\n\n[ AM_MEDIA_TYPE ]\n\n+ majortype: MEDIATYPE_Stream {E436EB83-524F-11CE-9F53-0020AF0BA770}\n\n+ subtype: Unknown GUID Name {1AC0BEBD-4D2B-45AD-BCEB-F2C41C5E3788}\n\n+ formattype: TIME_FORMAT_NONE {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\n\n+ bFixedSizeSamples: 1\n\n+ bTemporalCompression: 0\n\n+ lSampleSize: 1\n\n+ cbFormat: 0\n\n---\n\nHere is the log.\n\nThis is from day #2 of the event, when we recorded the whole day.\n\nThis resulted in a >4GB mkv file to be generated.\n\nThis file is also unreadable exactly like the first one (which was 2.4 GB in size).\n\nAs you can see, the recording started at 9:05am and ended at 6:13pm.\n\nI hope you can make some sense out of the logs and suggest a course of action, I can't believe the video stream is there and there is no way to recover it.\n\nAgain, the short (1 minute) test videos I shot with the exact same settings did result in viewable .mkv files so the problem should be related to length/size somehow.\n\nThanks\n\n---\n\n09:00:04.752: CPU Name: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2430M CPU @ 2.40GHz\n\n09:00:04.752: CPU Speed: 2395MHz\n\n09:00:04.752: Physical Cores: 2, Logical Cores: 4\n\n09:00:04.752: Physical Memory: 4030MB Total, 2245MB Free\n\n09:00:04.752: Windows Version: 10.0 Build 10586 (revision: 589; 64-bit)\n\n09:00:04.752: Running as administrator: false\n\n09:00:04.752: Aero is Enabled (Aero is always on for windows 8 and above)\n\n09:00:04.753: Portable mode: false\n\n09:00:04.774: OBS 17.0.2 (64bit, windows)\n\n09:00:04.774: ---------------------------------\n\n09:00:04.775: ---------------------------------\n\n09:00:04.775: audio settings reset:\n\n09:00:04.775: samples per sec: 44100\n\n09:00:04.775: speakers: 1\n\n09:00:04.776: ---------------------------------\n\n09:00:04.776: Initializing D3D11..\n\n09:00:04.776: Available Video Adapters:\n\n09:00:04.777: Adapter 1: Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000\n\n09:00:04.777: Dedicated VRAM: 1061888000\n\n09:00:04.777: Shared VRAM: 2113067008\n\n09:00:04.777: output 1: pos={0, 0}, size={1024, 768}, attached=true\n\n09:00:04.780: Loading up D3D11 on adapter Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000 (0)\n\n09:00:04.883: D3D11 loaded sucessfully, feature level used: 45056\n\n09:00:05.506: ---------------------------------\n\n09:00:05.506: video settings reset:\n\n09:00:05.506: base resolution: 1024x768\n\n09:00:05.506: output resolution: 1024x768\n\n09:00:05.506: downscale filter: Bicubic\n\n09:00:05.506: fps: 30/1\n\n09:00:05.506: format: NV12\n\n09:00:05.507: ---------------------------------\n\n09:00:05.510: [CoreAudio encoder]: CoreAudio AAC encoder not installed on the system or couldn't be loaded\n\n09:00:05.511: [AMF Encoder] Unable to load 'amfrt64.dll', error code 126.\n\n09:00:05.517: LoadLibrary failed for 'nvEncodeAPI64.dll': (null) (126)\n\n09:00:05.529: Couldn't find VLC installation, VLC video source disabled\n\n09:00:05.533: No blackmagic support\n\n09:00:05.541: ---------------------------------\n\n09:00:05.541: Loaded Modules:\n\n09:00:05.541: win-wasapi.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: win-mf.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: win-dshow.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: win-decklink.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: win-capture.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: vlc-video.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: text-freetype2.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: rtmp-services.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: obs-x264.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: obs-transitions.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: obs-text.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: obs-qsv11.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: obs-outputs.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: obs-filters.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: obs-ffmpeg.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: image-source.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: frontend-tools.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: enc-amf.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: coreaudio-encoder.dll\n\n09:00:05.541: ==== Startup complete ===============================================\n\n09:00:05.542: Service '' not found\n\n09:00:05.543: All scene data cleared\n\n09:00:05.543: ------------------------------------------------\n\n09:00:05.574: WASAPI: Device 'Tel. viva voce annull. eco (BCC950 ConferenceCam)' initialized\n\n09:00:05.588: WASAPI: Device 'Tel. viva voce annull. eco (BCC950 ConferenceCam)' initialized\n\n09:00:05.592: WASAPI: Device 'Tel. viva voce annull. eco (BCC950 ConferenceCam)' initialized\n\n09:00:05.598: Switched to scene 'Scena'\n\n09:00:05.599: ------------------------------------------------\n\n09:00:05.599: Loaded scenes:\n\n09:00:05.599: -
