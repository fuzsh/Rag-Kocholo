        "text": "Because Windows doesn’t have dd, and I want to write the latest Mint LTS release to a USB task, I had to face the unpleasant task of finding a Windows tool to perform what’s a basic Unix operation. The good news is that I found one, and it’s open source: Win32 Disk Imager. It even has a version ≥ 1, titled: “Holy cow, we made a 1.0 Release”.\n\nI found another open source tool, UNetbootin, but that tool didn’t recognize my non-MS-format formatted USB stick (which already tauted the installer for a previous Mint release).\n\nIn the end, Win32 Disk Imager also choked on the funky partition table left by the previous boot image, so I had to find out how reset the USB disk’s partition table in Windows:\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32>diskpart Microsoft DiskPart version 10.0.16299.15 Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

C:\\WINDOWS\\system32>\n\nWindows 7 update service is slow to begin with, but trying it on a computer that has been off for a while is damn near impossible. This is a known issue, apparently.\n\nYou need KB3172605 to fix it.\n\nThen supposedly, to make Windows Update faster, you can install KB2852386 to be able to remove old updates with the cleanup wizard. But, the option to remove unneeded Windows Update files never appeared for me.\n\nSources:\n\nSuperuser – windows-7-sp1-windows-update-stuck-checking-for-updates\n\nSeven Forums – windows-updates-remove-outdated-updates-windows-7\n\nWindows 7 has a sort of hard link, a junction file, which it uses to link the old location “Documents and Settings” to /Users/. Because of all this junctioning, you can’t just copy files with a Cygwin program like Deltacopy, because it will hang in infinite loop and copy a whole lot of things twice.\n\nTo identify junction files, run:\n\ndir /AL /s\n\nHere is an example exclude list for deltacopy for a standard windows 7 machine. Path names are specified assuming every user dir is supplied as separate dir to copy (because there are references to root, like ‘/Mijn documenten’:\n\n--delete-excluded --exclude \"/Application Data\" --exclude \"**/Downloads\" --exclude \"**/AppData/Local/Application Data\" --exclude \"/Local Settings\" --exclude \"**/Temporary Internet Files\" --exclude \"**/Flash Player\" --exclude \"**/Temp\" --exclude \"**/VirtualStore\" --exclude \"NTUSER.DAT*\" --exclude \"UsrClass.dat*\" --exclude \"ntuser.dat*\" --exclude \"parent.lock\" --exclude \"/Mijn documenten\" --exclude \"/Mijn afbeeldingen\" --exclude \"/Mijn muziek\" --exclude \"/Mijn video's\"\n\nThe ‘Mijn Documenten’ and such is a link to other dirs, so it doesn’t skip them. Be sure not to use these statements when running this on Windows XP…\n\nI don’t really trust the security of RDP, so therefore I’d like to take some extra security measures. I found this article explaining a lot.\n\nFirst put users in the remote desktop group. You can do this by right clicking on my computer, or through the conventional manager.\n\nAdministrators are always allowed access and you may want to disable this. To do that, click Start – Programs – Administrative Tools (%SystemRoot%\\system32\\secpol.msc /s), then Local Security Policy. With “Allow logon through Terminal Services” you can define the groups that can logon with RDP. Remote Administrators if you want.\n\nNow you want to have some kind of automatic block after a certain number of failed attempts. In the same policy editor, go to “Account Policies – Account Lockout Policy”. Set the threshold to something useful, with useful values. I prefer not to use indefinate timeouts, to avoid legitimate people from being blocked forever.\n\nNext you want to change the encryption level. You can do this by running “%SystemRoot%\\system32\\gpedit.msc /s”, going to Administrative Templates – Windows Components – Terminal Services. From there it depends on the windows version, but look for security and change:\n\nSet client connection encryption level. Enabled, to high.\n\nAlways prompt client for password upon connection. Enabled.\n\nRequire Secure RPC Communication. Enabled.\n\nUnfortunately, forcing SSL is incompatible with the linux rdesktop client.\n\nYou may need to run gpupdate (source).\n\nJust a a kind of bookmark, I used this blog post as a base to find out how to install Windows as a DomU on Xen. I might at some point reconstruct my steps, but for now this link is all… (judging by the URL the blog won’t exist much longer, but oh well…)\n\nEwald wants to be able to make video/photo montages of his life at la Boucoule. While there last month, I helped him along with Windows Movie Maker (WMM) a bit. WMM doesn’t like Quicktime video’s (as outputted by his camera), so I found a simple Windows program that wraps around ffmpeg to convert these movies to AVI format: Pazera Free MOV to AVI Converter 1.2.\n\nTo make the generated AVI work in WMM, a few settings need to be changed away from the default. For this purpose I added a custom profile. Here’s the INI file, “00 - Geschikt voor Windows Movie Maker.ini”:\n\n[MAIN] AppName=Pazera Free MOV to AVI Converter AppVer=1.2 OutputFormat=AVI [AVI] VideoCodec=1 VideoBitrate=Auto VideoFPS=Auto Video2Pass=0 DoNotCopyVideo=0 [MPG] VideoFormat=0 MPEGVersion=0 VideoBitrate=Auto VideoFPS=Auto Video2Pass=0 DoNotCopyVideo=0 [AUDIO] AudioCodec=0 AudioBitrate=Auto AudioSampling=Auto AudioChannels=0 DoNotCopyAudio=0 Volume=100 [ADVANCED] Resolution=0 ResWidth=320 ResHeight=240 ForceVideoTag=0 VideoTag=XVID CropTop=0 CropBottom=0 CropLeft=0 CropRight=0 AdditionalParams=\n\nNow, Ewald will only need to select the right profile if he wants to prepare his Quicktime movies for editing with Windows Movie Maker:\n\nEwald wanted to be able to create DVDs from the Quicktime movies exported by his digital camera. As a result of being away from my familiar Linux tools, I had to find something that´d work on Windows XP.\n\nFirst, I tried MediaCoder, a Windows front-end (done in XUL) for mencoder, ffmpeg and more of these familiar tools. It was flexible enough, but quite awkward from an end-user perspective and also frustrating if you’re used to calling the supporting commands directly from the CLI.\n\nLuckily, I stumbled upon ConvertXtoDVD, a commercial Windows-only program which proved to be very user-friendly and intuitive without requiring the user to understand the ins and outs of each an every supported media format.\n\nAt 40 euro it’s a bit expensive if, like me, you’re used to staying at the free software side of things, but I’d daresay it’s actually worth the money if you’re not an obsessive geek with obscene amounts of free time on his hands."
