        "text": "Today I happened to see my very first post on hydrogenaudio.org telling people that I have made a audio transcoder software. My little piece of software, which I named MediaCoder later, turned out to be popular on the forum for a while. It was that good beginning kept me working continuously on the same software for nearly 7 years!\n\nI also found a really long web page which archieved all my changelogs through the years which I myself didnâ€™t do.\n\nJust want to say thank you to all the people supporting me!\n\nI finally decided not using year number as MediaCoderâ€™s version number any more, as this will force me to change the it every year, which I feel is a pressure on me. I switched back to the traditional and continuous version numbering scheme of AA.BB.CC.BUILD. Current major version number of MediaCoder is 0.8.12 which is equilivant to former 2011-R12.\n\nI am planning for and working on some new features, including better image overlaying feature, better paralell tasks handling and improving distributive transcoding. Next major version will be MediaCoder 0.9.\n\nMediaCoder 2011 R10 build 5226 was released last week. It has several minor fixups and updates of encoders and tools. I donâ€™t know if this will be (or not) the last revision of version 2011 as I am preparing for the major update and release of MediaCoder 2012 which will feature:\n\nXML-layouted images/texts/dynamic data overlay on video (last year Iâ€™ve developed a rendering engine for another project and I am going to integrate it into MediaCoder)\n\nmore detailed report on complete of tasks\n\nfixing the annoying blocking issue on parallel task processing from the root\n\nbetter distributed transcoding support\n\na new splash screen that I change every year\n\nBecause right now I am involed in so much other work (e.g. I am absorbed in Arduino and is about to develop a simulator for it) in addition to MediaCoder development which I have enjoyed and continued for more than 5 years, I just want to make sure the new version 2012 will be out before too many days of year 2012 are passed away. ðŸ˜‰ If you like MediaCoder, please stay tuned with me here on Google+ or on the MediaCoder blog."
