And it works very well. However, the user interface is a complete disaster. The most baffling thing is the inclusion of certain XUL-based user interface elements which are slow and painful to use, and worst of all, completely unnecessary. I also don't need a Firefox page to pop up every time you want to tell me something, thank you. There also doesn't seem to be any way to disable automatic updates permanently. All of this brings down the rating to 2 stars."
