        "text": "Hi Everyone, many thanks in advance for helping ^_^\n\nI've been searching forum and can't find an answer anywhere.\n\nI've downloaded video snaps, and game list, checked my path in the gamelist xml, and everything appears to be correct (I mean video preview plays sound, so is definitely finding the video file).\n\nThe problem is that I only get sound and no video. I tried different theme (carbon, CRT), I tried different sources for the video (progetto snaps, emumovies,...) I even tried recoding my videos using Mediacoder (videos are 30fps and standard resolution, so shouldn't be too taxing). I always get to the same result, I get the sound of the video preview but no video.\n\nAnybody has any idea what the problem could be? this is a brand new install of the latest Retropie 4.2.\n\nMany thanks for your help!\n\nCheers,\n\nKalime\n\nWhat video player are you using? And what version of EmulationStation are you using? And what Pi do you have?\n\nIn \"Other Settings\" you may be able to choose to use OMXPlayer as an option, which may alleviate or remedy those issues. Or, if you're already using OMXPlayer, then disabling that and using VLC may help with it.\n\nBest of luck, and let us know how it goes.\n\nMany thanks for the answer. I'm assuming I'm using base video player. This is a brand new install of retropie 4.2 's latest version available. Not sure what version of EmulationStation but should be the latest one, part of that latest retropie install. I have a Pi 3 B.\n\nI've checked other settings and don't have option to change video player.... I'm losing my mind ^_^\n\ngiven it was the latest version of retropie, which I assumed contained the latest version of emustation. Anyway, having lots of fun with it, and the kids can browse through the videos to find something they like rather than having to figure out from names that don't mean anything to them ^_^\n\nI'll give the video screensaver a go as well ^^ but first rom and video upload ^^\n\n@Kalime Well, EmulationStation is in constant development, so it's normal that the image itself (which takes time and effort to put together) isn't necessarily reflective of the latest changes.\n\nGlad it's sorted.\n\nI'm biased, but I strongly recommend using OMX Player in the options, if your theme doesn't render anything on top of the video. It uses hardware acceleration, so the performance is better and it won't lead to overheating the Pi.\n\nEnjoy!"
