        "text": "i know that codecs are a big subject and have been discussed a lot and there is lot of information, but i am simply desperate. since hours i try to tryout lw and i cant since i dont get any file to import. i was hoping to find somewhere a simple list of settings i need to choose in mediacoder, but i couldnt. is it really so difficult? i found from drkuli the xml but it doesnt work either, the transcoded files are said to have codec unsupported (i have the actual lw 10.0.4.2 and my mediacoder is 0.8.1 5200).\n\ni am not very technical with this so i have a problem if someone talks in a post about AAC and in the options of mc i find LC-AAC, HE-AAC, HE-AAC2. so many options and i am completeyl lost. (this is why also http://www.lightworksbeta.com/index.php?option=com_kunena&func=view&catid=19&id=1277&Itemid=269 doesnt help me much)\n\nalso it makes it difficult that mp4 files are not listed in my import window (but as far as i read they should).\n\ni would love to simply receive a list as:\n\nvideoformat H.264\n\naudioformat LC-AAC\n\nencoders on automatic\n\nformat AVI\n\nmuxer on automatic\n\ngo\n\nor a ready xml where everything is done, and i can take aaaaall files of whatever type and transcode them into a format that is importable into lw.\n\nor maybe another easier prog than mediacoder that comes with a built-in preset that works (in the wiki there are some more f.e. xmedia recode but there are no further infos.\n\nexcuse me, i am not a pro and i am simply lost now into codecs and i just want to use lw, is it really that difficult? if not, please let me know what to do.\n\nthank you all\n\nsofian\n\nYes, the best thing is if we find our answers by ourself ... and share them\n\nso my long trip through converters ended up in an amazing tool ... as drkuli described. XMediaRecode is so wonderful, it has all the detail possibilities while being nice and structured done. Thousands of presets (i simply take one of the apple ones and give it manually the framerate i chose in the lw project) and all settings one needs. and did i mention that it is nice and structured? i simply love it! it is what i searched for years. and the best: its free. and the nearly incredible: its even portable officially. i am overwhelmed.\n\nbut my problem solved also because now lw can see mp4! if anyone wonders why his lw doesnt show mp4 files, simply download quicktime and install. sometimes it is so easy. :silly:\n\nso, now i am happy, more than happy, and i hope this post helps some who are as me"
