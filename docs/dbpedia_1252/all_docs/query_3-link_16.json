        "text": "MediaCoder is a free audio/video batch transcoder, putting together many excellent audio/video softwares from the open source community into one friendly GUI. It is a great info that the latest MediaCoder 0.8.32 is just released with multiple-pass H.265 encoding!\n\nI have been working on adding H.265 encoding support to MediaCoder. Today, everything finally gets to work since this app is open for beta testing. Here is my MediaCoder H.265 encoding test, read as below:Software Download\n\nFor users who want to involve in the beta testing, please download the update package (both x86 and x64) and apply it on the installation of MediaCoder 0.8.32.\n\nFor uses who haven’t installed MediaCoder or your MediaCoder is out-dated, please go here to download the latest MediaCoder full installer and install MediaCoder with it before applying the update.\n\nx265 0.7 is used as the H.265/HEVC encoder. Current limitations of H.265 encoding in MediaCoder are:\n\nOnly MP4 and MKV container work with H.265\n\n2-pass and 3-pass mode are not supported\n\nProfile and level can’t be manually specified\n\nLimited type of tune options\n\nGPU encoding not supported yet\n\nMediaCoder’s Segmental Video Encoding not working with H.265\n\n(Update 2/17: SVE now working with H.265+MP4)\n\nBe aware the encoding of H.265 is extremely CPU hungry. Make sure you have a powerful enough CPU. The good thing is the saving on bitrate is about 50% over H.264 at same visual quality. Another good thing is that you can warm up your CPU and maybe your room by doing H.265 encoding in this cold winter. Please don’t hesiste to leave you feedbacks here.\n\nFollowing are some sample H.265 video clips encoded by MediaCoder. The visual quality is quite amazing. Right click the link (browser can’t play it), “Save As” to download it, and play with latest VLC or any media player if your system has a latest codec pack installed.\n\nMediaCoder_hevc_demo_720p_512kbps.mp4 (8.2MB 2:00)\n\nMediaCoder_hevc_demo_1080p_700kbps.mp4 (5.4 MB 1:01)\n\nMediaCoder_hevc_demo_1080p_1100kbps.mp4 (4.5 MB 0:33)\n\nMediaCoder_hevc_demo_720p_512kbps_dual_audio.mp4 (33.5MB 4:22)\n\nThe drawbacks\n\nIt requires software download and installation prior to converting your media files.\n\nIts platform is somewhat perplexed for newbie.\n\nOnly support Windows OS.\n\nSlow file conversion rate.\n\nCan’t rip Blu-ray, DVD to H.265 video\n\nThis program is indeed a good converter, but it is also necessary to have a mediacoder alternative or an additiona tool available in case you experience some hassle that this tool possess. Here Pavtube BDMagic is a similar tool for encoding H.265 MP4 video from Blu-ray and DVD. User interface is simple which is not confusing to use. And there are some advanced added features of this program include subtitle adding, video editing, BD/DVD copying and 3D video creating.\n\nNEWS!!! Recently, Pavtube Studio has upgraded its top-ranked Pavtube BDMagic to version 4.9.0.0 with supporting the most advanced hardware acceleration NVIDIA CUDA & AMD APP by H.264/H.265 codec, which can give users 30x video transcoding speed than before."
