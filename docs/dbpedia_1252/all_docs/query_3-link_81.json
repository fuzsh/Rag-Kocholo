With Turbo Boost technology, it is capable of overclocking up to 4.1GHz.\n\nIt further features Hyper-Threading technology (12 threads total), a 9MB L3 cache, and a power rating of 45W.\n\nThe processor is paired with Intel HD Graphics 630. It handles everyday tasks well.\n\nHowever, there’s also the Nvidia GTX 1060. It houses 6GB of GDDR5 video memory. This series is quite popular on the market. For example, it is the most common card among Steam users.\n\nThe very switching between video cards is done automatically with Nvidia Optimus technology.\n\nDuring testing with FurMark, the graphics card scored 1544 MHz. The device has two bays for using SO-DIMM memory modules. It is equipped with 1 DDR4-2666 RAM chip with a capacity of 16GB. Nevertheless, there is a possibility of further upgrades. The maximum claimed capacity is 32GB.\n\nTwo hard drives are provided: a 256GB WDC SN520 NVMe SSD and a 1TB 2.5″ Toshiba MQ04ABF100 HDD.\n\nThe SSD is installed in a standard M.2 slot, works with a PCIe 3.0×4 interface, and has a 2280 form factor. It can be used for the operating system. And a Toshiba hard drives for storing personal files.\n\nThis Asus TUF Gaming FX705G laptop is equipped with dual-band (2.4 and 5 GHz) Wi-Fi thanks to Intel Wireless-AC 9560. In addition, there is a Realtek RTL8168 network interface.\n\nThe audio system is based on a Realtek codec (ALC235). There are two standard speakers on the sides.\n\nThe device is equipped with an integrated webcam. It is located in the center of the upper frame of the gaming monitor.\n\nThe camera is capable of transmitting images in 720-HD format at 30 fps.\n\nIt remains to add that the model is equipped with a standard 64Wh non-removable battery.\n\nAppearance and chassis ergonomics\n\nThe appearance is similar to the ROG Strix series. The difference lies in the port set, chassis material, and other minor details. The device is made of gray plastic with a silver metallic finish. In the center is a mirrored brand logo.\n\nAlthough the Asus TUF Gaming FX705G laptop’s cover is only 7.5mm thick, it’s quite stiff and strong.\n\nBoth the gaming keyboard and the touchpad have a black plastic surface resembling metal. It is not glossy, so fingerprints are not very noticeable on it. The lower panel has large air vents for ample cooling. For a more stable position, rubberized feet are provided.\n\nThe width of the screen frame is only 7 mm. Due to this, the 17-inch version is not much different from the 15-inch device with a conventional bezel.\n\nAt the top right, the power button is located. There are also cooling vents in the center, just above the keyboard.\n\nThe operation indicators are located at the top right. There are 4: power light, battery level, hard drive activity, and WI-Fi mode.\n\nAttached to the chassis is a hinge at the bottom of the cover. It allows the screen to be tilted back about 120 degrees.\n\nOn the left frame, there are 2 USB 3.0 ports. Also 1 USB 2.0, HDMI, RJ-45, a mini-jack, and a charging socket.\n\nAlong the right edge, there is a ventilation hole and a hole for the Kensington lock.\n\nFinally, at the back, there are ventilation holes to vent the hot air from the chassis.\n\nDisassembly options\n\nIf you remove the bottom panel, you can access almost all parts of the Asus TUF Gaming FX705G laptop.\n\nAsus TUF Gaming Laptop – Input devises\n\nKeyboard\n\nThe Asus TUF Gaming FX705G laptop uses a keyboard with the marketing name HyperStrike. It is a membrane-type device with increased key spacing. The distance is 1.8 mm. They are standard size and the distance between them is about 4 mm. The color of the buttons is black and the characters are white.\n\nRGB backlighting is available. You can use the special program TUF Aura Core to adjust it.\n\nThe WASD area is highlighted in its color. They are transparent, it is made for fans of action games.\n\nThe model’s keys are capable of handling any number of simultaneous presses. The special ROG Overstroke technology helps fine-tune typing settings. So you can easily adjust your comfort to match your gaming preferences.\n\nIt’s quite durable. The manufacturer claims it can handle up to 20 million taps. The construction of the device is quite tight. It doesn’t deform under pressure when pushed.\n\nTouchpad\n\nThe Asus TUF Gaming FX705G laptop’s touchpad is made with simulated pressure. The working surface is 105×74 mm. It is slightly recessed for greater ease of use.\n\nSound System\n\nAs written above, the audio system is based on the Realtek ALC235 HDA codec. TheAsus TUF Gaming FX705G laptop is equipped with 2 speakers.\n\nThe integrated speakers performed decently when tested. They do not hum or rattle. At the same time, it is quite loud. The sound itself is of good quality, it is quite deep and rich.\n\nTo evaluate the audio output, we tested the Asus TUF Gaming FX705G laptop with the Creative E-MU 0204 sound card. For this purpose RightMark Audio Analyzer 6.3.0 was used. The result is a rating of “very good”.\n\nScreen\n\nFor the business segment, screens are very often noticeably spared. Then in our case, this would be a huge omission. The laptop uses an AUO B173HAN04.0 IPS matrix with a white LED backlight. It showed good calibration and even compared to premium displays, this one looks good.\n\nThe diagonal size is 17.3″.The screen resolution is 1920×1080, at 144Hz. But that’s in the higher-priced version. The more affordable version got the standard 60 Hz. It’s also worth noting that the display is matte and completely glare-free.\n\nAfter testing it can be concluded that the maximum brightness of the display is 280 cd/m². The maximum gamma value is 2.1. At the same time, the minimum screen lightness was 12 cd/m².\n\nScreen test resultsMaximum white brightness:280 cd/m2Minimum brightness white:15 cd/m2Gamma:2,1\n\nGamma coverage is 85.9% sRGB and color gamut is 94.7% sRGB.\n\nThe light filters highlight the primary spectra reasonably well. The only drawback is the narrowing of the screen’s red spectrum.\n\nThe Color temperature is stable throughout the gray range at 7000K. The accuracy does not exceed 3 in all grayscale, which is very good for this class.\n\nThe model has a wide viewing angle. You can look at it from any perspective without any problems.\n\nOverall, the screen of the device turned out to be of good quality. And it handles big games as well as top-quality movies just fine.\n\nPerformance under load\n\nThree levels of CPU utilization was used for the analysis:\n\nMedium\n\nFor this, we used AIDA64 (Stress prog). The clock frequency of the cores is only 3.3 GHz.\n\nIn this case, the temperature is kept at 83 °C (181.4 °F). Power consumption is stabilized at 45W.\n\nIt’s worth noting that at this load the cooling system is already running at full capacity.\n\nHigh\n\nIn this case, the processor is tightly loaded and its operating frequency drops to 2.5 GHz.\n\nThe CPU stabilizes at 82°C (179,6 °F), and the power consumption of the core remains at 45 watts.\n\nSuper-High Load\n\nFor ultra-high-end loading, we used Prime95.\n\nThe frequency of the kernels will drop to 2.3 GHz. The temperature of the cores will be even lower than in the previous case – 75 °C (167 °F), and power consumption will be stabilized again at 45 W.\n\nThe above-mentioned modes refer to the case when only the CPU is loaded. Now let’s see what happens if we load the digital GPU together with the CPU. We will use Prime95 to load the processor and FurMark to load the graphics card.\n\nIn this setting, we will use 2.0GHz for the chip itself.\n\nThis results in 83°C (181,4 °F) temperature and the power consumption is reduced to 35W.\n\nEvaluating the speed of hard drives\n\nAs mentioned above, the Asus TUF Gaming FX705G laptop’s disk memory is a combination of a WDC PC SN520 NVMe drive with an M.2 socket and a 2.5″ Toshiba MQ04ABF100 HDD.\n\nWe evaluated the speed performance of the SSD. In this case, it is used as a system drive.\n\nAccording to the ATTO Disk Benchmark utility, the sequential data transfer speed limit is 1.6GB/s. At the same time, sequential writes – at 1.2GB/s.\n\nAnother program, CrystalDiskMark, showed lower write speed results.\n\nThis may be explained by the fact that it uses a different queuing algorithm.\n\nThe AS-SSD evaluation results are attached below.\n\nNoise level\n\nMeasurements were taken using a sound absorption chamber. The microphone was placed in the conditional head position of the user.\n\nIn simple mode, the noise level was 28 dBA. This corresponds to the natural daytime background in an office environment.\n\nIn High mode, the loudness factor is 40 dBA, which reaches the ergonomic limit. At this level, the model will stand out from other devices in the room.\n\nUnder simultaneous video card and CPU stress load, the noise level is almost the same as when only the CPU is loaded – 43 dBA. Both CPU and GPU simultaneous top-loading modes also achieve 43dBA.\n\nLoad degree:Noise levelIdle mode:28 dBAStress loading the graphics card:40 dBAStress load the processor:43 dBAStress loading of video card and processor:43 dBA\n\nOverall, the gaming laptop can be categorized as a fairly noisy device.\n\nAsus FX705G – Battery life\n\nThe model under review has a 64Wh non-removable battery. For the tests, we used the iXBT Battery Benchmark v1.0 script. It’s worth mentioning that the battery life was measured at a display brightness of 100 cd/m².\n\nFor the benchmark, we used the graphics core of the processor.\n\nThe result is:\n\nLoad degree:Working time:Working with text:4 h. 53 min.Viewing video:4 h. 24 min.\n\nThe gaming laptop provided a battery life that was highly dependent on the type of load (as it should be on the theory of the matter). Its level of autonomy can be said to be good for all modes except gaming. For the latter, it is advisable to connect the Asus TUF Gaming FX705G laptop to the mains.\n\nPerformance Research\n\nThe performance of the device was measured using iXBT Application Benchmark. At the same time, we used iXBT Game Benchmark to assess gaming benchmark performance. For comparison, below is a table of results compared to the Asus ROG Strix GL704GM Scar II on the same processor.\n\nAsus TUF Gaming FX705G versus the Asus ROG Strix GL704GM Scar II\n\nCalculated over 5 attempts for more objectivity in the results. As can be seen, the model is 14% below the benchmark system in terms of output results. The integral score excluding the drive was 62 points. It’s worth noting that a competitor with the same processor scored 83 points, 34% higher.\n\nThis suggests that performance is not only achieved by the CPU type, but also by the frequency at which it runs. And that can vary from one model to another – depending on the configured TDP and how the cooling system works.\n\nNext, let’s take a look at the playback results. In our testing, we used the standard 3 levels of graphics settings. Their resolution was 1920×1080. The device has a GTX 1060 with the ForceWare 411.70 video driver.\n\nResults:\n\nAt this resolution, all the games we’ve used run comfortably on low and medium settings. The desktop consistently shows more than 40 FPS in these titles. Almost all games can be played at maximum settings. Our model can be classified as a performance gaming device.\n\nAccording to the integral result, the Asus TUF Gaming FX705G laptop can be classified as high performance. According to the grading, with a score of fewer than 45 points, the unit belongs to the entry-level performance. A score of 60-75 is categorized as performance. Finally, with a score of over 75, it is a high-performance solution.\n\nFX705G Asus – Conclusions\n\nAt the time of writing for the model ASUS TUF Gaming FX 705GM, it was on sale without an operating system for around US$1,539.99 at Amazon. More common are laptops of the same type with slightly more modest specs. They are equipped with 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD drive. Such variants cost around $1300.\n\nThe device has a stylish design as well as a nice matte IPS screen at 144Hz. With acceptable resolution and a narrow bezel around it. The keyboard and touchpad are also of a high standard.\n\nOverall, the device is interesting, but not without its shortcomings. Chief among which is the noise level at high load. Also worth noting is the short battery life.\n\nMore gaming laptop reviews:\n\nASUS ROG Zephyrus G15 review\n\nASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 Review\n\nASUS ROG Strix Scar 15 review\n\nReview on ASUS ROG Strix SCAR 17 G733\n\nASUS TUF Gaming FX 705 Laptop Review: Price, Features & Specs"
