        "text": "I've seen the vast majority of films discussed in the book and enjoyed mentally comparing notes with Neibaur's takes. I was particularly glad to see his comments on MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (1944), which is one of my all-time favorite films; he concisely sums up some of the film's qualities thusly: \"Vincente Minnelli proved himself to be a brilliant director, with the movie's flow of movement and bright use of color enhancing the committed performances.\"\n\nI also appreciated his admiration for the romantic drama THE CLOCK (1945) which I recently revisited for the first time in years; both the film and Garland's sensitive performance left me wholly impressed. (A still from THE CLOCK with Robert Walker is below.) I think we saw most of Garland's films, also including EASTER PARADE (1948) and SUMMER STOCK (1950), in pretty much the same ways.\n\nIt sometimes makes me sad that Garland didn't make more movies after she left MGM in 1950, but her personal struggles over the years are well known, and in the end I'm grateful for what she gave us, sometimes at great personal cost. Neibaur's book does a fine job capturing her career on the page. I think an editor could have contributed more paragraphing, as some are quite long and it's also occasionally slightly confusing when a topic changes mid-paragraph; that said, since I read an advance review copy it's possible those issues were cleaned up before final publication.\n\nThat's my only criticism, and it's certainly not a significant one in terms of the book's content; it's presented simply in the interest of being thorough. Neibaur is a reliable writer who has clearly researched deeply and shares many insightful opinions. The book works as both an excellent introduction to Garland for new fans and an enjoyable review for those who have loved her work for years.\n\nThe print copy of THE FILMS OF JUDY GARLAND is 202 pages including photos, chapter notes, bibliography, and index. Please visit the publisher website (McFarlandBooks.com) for additional information.\n\nThanks to McFarland and James L. Neibaur for providing an e-copy of this book for review.\n\nTweet"
