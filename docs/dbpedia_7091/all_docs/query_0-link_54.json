        "text": "THIS week's film attractions include a diverting combination of gloss and grit about a teeming hotel in New Orleans, a perceptive World War II gem, a classily spun suspense story about a naive bride and her strange groom and a nocturnal New York whodunit.\n\nRichard Quine's HOTEL (1967) is an entertaining version of Arthur Hailey's popular novel about a large, luxurious New Orleans hotel with problems arising from ownership, management and its guests. Melvyn Douglas as the proprietor and Rod Taylor as his shrewd general manager lead its fight for survival; the guests include Merle Oberon, and Richard Conte as a blackmailer and Kevin McCarthy as a gangster play key roles -- Sunday at 8 P. M. and Sunday/Early Monday on American Movie Classics.\n\nIn THE CLOCK (1945), directed by Vincente Minnelli, Robert Walker, portraying a soldier from Indiana on 48-hour leave before going overseas, meets an office worker (Judy Garland) in World War II Manhattan. Garland is enchanting in this beautifully detailed story of love and marriage, and Keenan Wynn as a garrulous drunk and Jackie Gleason as an affectionate milkman play supporting roles to perfection -- Wednesday at 8 P.M. on Turner Classic Movies.\n\nIn UNDERCURRENT (1946), also directed by Minnelli, an unsuspecting woman (Katharine Hepburn) marries a strange, handsome man (Robert Taylor) and is drawn to his baffling brother (Robert Mitchum). Jayne Meadows stands out in an excellent bit portrayal -- Wednesday at 10 P. M. on Turner Classic Movies."
