        "text": "Today, I want to share with you my most favorite movie costumes from the last 70 years! I have narrowed my rather large list down to just five! A very difficult feat! üôÇ Some are ornate, and some, are very simple.\n\nSo let‚Äôs get started!\n\n#1 Judy Garland in the The Clock (1945)\n\nWhat I love about this dress is the lace detailing around the neck and the waist. It is such a classic example of elegant 1940‚Äôs fashion and comfort. I wish I knew what color the dress was in real life‚Ä¶.but in my head, I picture a sky blue!\n\n#2 Felicity Jones in The Invisible Woman (2013)\n\nThis has to be one of the best examples of an 1850‚Äôs gown that I have seen in a film. The pattern of the fabric, layered skirt, and wide pagoda sleeves make it truly stunning! There are many fabulous gowns in this film to love, but this is my favorite!\n\n#3 Lucille Ball in Follow the Fleet (1936)\n\nIt isn‚Äôt often that Ginger Rogers is upstaged by a supporting actress, but I love the plaid gown that Lucille is wearing! Classic 1930‚Äôs construction with the deep V-neckline, puffy short sleeves, and bias cut dress. Love it!\n\n#4 Winona Ryder in Little Women (1994)\n\nOne of my favorite versions of the book, I choose this gown for its simplistic and gathered details. Light, airy, and perfect for a warm summer day, this gown is made only sweeter by the light blue sash at the waist.\n\n#5 Joan Fontaine in Rebecca (1940)\n\nThis is exactly the sort of outfit that I can picture myself in! I love everything about it! It may not be as flashy as other gowns worn by Ms. Fontaine worn in the film, but it speaks of elegance and femininity.\n\nOkay, so I know I said this was my top five favorite‚Ä¶..but I can‚Äôt let this next one not be included‚Ä¶.so I will make it #5 1/2! üôÇ\n\n#5 1/2 Kirsten Dunst in Marie Antoinette (2006)\n\nThis gown, and this gown alone, is what started my love of 1780‚Äôs fashion. I adore it! It is also the gown that showed me how woefully unskilled I am as a seamstress for I know I could never get my seams as crisp‚Ä¶.maybe someday! üôÇ\n\nWhat are your favorite movie costumes? I would love to hear from you!\n\nHave a wonderful day!\n\nSince I was a young child, I have absolutely loved musicals from ‚ÄúOld Hollywood.‚Äù You know, the ones where only mild drama ensues, the boy always gets the girl, and the background characters always seem to ‚Äúknow‚Äù all the words and the choreography. I started watching them with my grandfather and would always make him laugh when I showed him how I could recite the entire opening scene of The Music Man‚Ä¶at eight years old.\n\nI have continued to enjoy these films and have found new delightful additions to my musical library. In fact, whenever my mom comes to visit me, we pull out our favorites and get ‚Äútaken away‚Äù to another time and place.\n\nAnd since this month is all about ‚ÄúGoing on Vacation‚Äù whether you stay at home or hit the road, I have decided to share with you my top ten favorite ‚Äúvacation-themed‚Äù movies.\n\n1. The Long, Long Trailer ‚Äì 1953 Starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz\n\nAmerica‚Äôs sweethearts play the adorable newlywed couple, Nicky and Tacy, who decide to save money by buying a trailer as they head out to Colorado. This film is full of slapstick comedy, silly stunts, and a fun song or two. The clothes, decoration, and scenery make this trip a must-see!\n\n2. Luxury Liner ‚Äì 1948 Starring George Brent, Jane Powell, and Lauritz Melchior\n\nA young girl, played by Jane Powell, is anxious to become a famous singer, so she stows away on a star-studded ocean liner‚Ä¶.of which her father is the captain. Wonderful cameos of Xavier Cougart and the Pied Pipers add to this colorful ocean musical!\n\n3. Two Weeks with Love ‚Äì 1950 Starring Jane Powell, Ricardo Montalban\n\nAnother of my favorites, this sweet coming-of-age story, stars Jane Powell (she is in many of my favorites) as a teenager joining her family for their yearly trip to the Catskills. Set at the turn of the century, this movie is made even better by a young Debbie Reynolds who adds her usual spunk and energy! With the caption ‚Äúit‚Äôs my first big love affair‚Äù and the promise of amazing singing, this movie is timeless!\n\n4. Roman Holiday ‚Äì 1953 Starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck\n\nNeed I say more? This film is truly a classic. Even though it may not be a musical, it‚Äôs artistic story of a bored princess who finds herself through the help of a news reporter, is as magical as the title..and it‚Äôs location!\n\n5. A Royal Wedding ‚Äì 1951 Starring Jane Powell and Fred Astaire\n\nAnother Jane Powell classic made even better with the addition of Fred Astaire and the debonair Peter Lawford. A dancing brother and sister team (Powell and Astaire) travel to England just in time for Queen Elizabeth II wedding. Each find love in unusual places with the help of their singing and dancing! Another interesting feature of this film is Winston Churchill‚Äôs daughter Sarah, who adds her own charm!\n\nRead More"
