        "text": "Christian Marclayâ€™s acclaimed installation The Clock 2010 has captivated audiences across the world from New York to Moscow.\n\n24-hours long, the installation is a montage of thousands of film and television images of clocks, edited together so they show the actual time. It is a thrilling journey through cinematic history as well as a functioning timepiece.\n\nFollowing several years of rigorous and painstaking research and production, Marclay collected together excerpts from well-known and lesser-known films including thrillers, westerns and science fiction. He then edited these so that they flow in real time. When watching The Clock you experience a vast range of narratives, settings and moods within the space of a few minutes.\n\nDue to limited capacity please be aware that there may be significant waiting times. As this is a free display, admission during normal gallery hours is on a first-come, first-served basis for all visitors, including Tate Members. For those in need of special assistance please call in advance on +44 (0)20 7887 8888.\n\nThe Clock will stay open overnight for a final 24-hour screening on 12-13 January. You will be able to see the late night and early morning section of the installation, which are not normally possible to view.\n\nPlease note the film features brief periods of nudity, strong language and scenes that some visitors may find upsetting. Visitors bringing children should use their discretion."
