        "text": "Please note that due to rain, this event will now be held indoors in Ronay Menschel Hall.\n\nIn The Clock, Vincente Minnelli's classic 1945 wartime romance, Robert Walker plays a small-town G.I. en route to Europe, who, during a whirlwind two-day leave in New York City, falls in love with a secretary played by Judy Garland (in her first dramatic, non-singing role). Directed by Minnelli right before he married Garland, the film offers a glimpse into filmmaking in the first half of the 1940s, when the war hung over everything and completely blocked access to any location shooting in the city. While most of the background footage was shot in NYC, the interiors were filmed on carefully designed replicas of New York landmarks in Hollywood.\n\nIntroduction by film critic Jourdain Searles.\n\nThis screening is part of our year-long series, New York on Film: Decade by Decade, programmed by Jessica Green. The series accompanies the Museum's centennial exhibition, This Is New York: 100 Years of the City in Art and Pop Culture.\n\nEvent Timeline:\n\n7:00 pm - Doors open to Ronay Menschel Hall (ground floor); drinks & popcorn available for purchase\n\n7:45 pm - Short introduction by Jourdain Searles\n\n8:00 pm - Film program begins: The Clock (Vincente Minelli, 1945, 90 min)\n\n9:30 pm - Program ends, Museum closes\n\nAbout Jourdain Searles:\n\nJourdain Searles is a writer, film programmer, and performer originally from Augusta, Georgia.
