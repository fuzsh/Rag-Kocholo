        "text": "News items in HR indicate that director Jack Conway worked on the film for one week in Jun 1944 \"lining up background shots\" of New York City. According to a studio memo dated 27 Jun 1944, Conway withdrew from the film due to illness and was replaced by Fred Zinnemann. The extent of Conway's contribution to the final film has not been determined. A 21 Jun 1944 HR news item indicates that M-G-M originally wanted Tay Garnett to replace Conway. Zinnemann directed the film until the end of Aug 1944, when he was replaced by Vincente Minnelli, whom Garland married in 1945. According to modern sources, Zinnemann's removal from the picture stemmed from his strained rapport with Judy Garland, and came about shortly after Garland had complained to producer Arthur Freed about their incompatibility. Modern sources also note that M-G-M bought the screen rights to Gallico's unpublished short story in 1943 for $50,000 and assigned Margaret Green to write the screenplay. In Jan 1944, Freed, unhappy with Green's script, replaced her with Joseph Schrank and Robert Nathan.\n\nAlthough their appearance in the released film has not been confirmed, various news items in HR list the following actors in the cast: Florence Allen, Jessie Arnold, Paulita Arviza, Estelle Aterre, Charles Bates, Jack Baxley, Mary Benoit, Margaret Bert, Mary Bovard, Volta Boyer, Steve Brodie, Ralph Brooke, Sally Ann Brown, Joan Carroll, Tony Carson, Douglas Carter, Lucille Casey, Alfredo Ceraldi, Wheaton Chambers, Eddy Chandler, Lyle Clark, Lucille Curtis, Kay Deslys, Joe Dominguez, George Dudley, Major Farrell , Nellie Farrell, Julie Gibson, Palmer Gran, Tom Herbert, Gertrude Hoffman , Reed Howes, Teddy Infuhr, Milton Kibbee, ...\n\nMore Less\n\nNews items in HR indicate that director Jack Conway worked on the film for one week in Jun 1944 \"lining up background shots\" of New York City.

HR production charts list Hume Cronyn, Louis Jean Heydt and Audrey Totter in the cast, but they did not appear in the final film.\n\nThe Clock marked Judy Garland's first dramatic, non-singing role in a film. The song \"If I Had You,\" which was used in the film as background music, was recorded by Garland and The Merry Macs and released by Decca in 1945. James and Lucile Gleason, who play \"Al Henry\" and his wife, were also husband and wife in real life. Rogers Edens, who is seen playing the piano in one scene, was the well-known composer and musical arranger who worked on many of Garlands M-G-M musicals. Producer Arthur Freed also has a brief role in the film, as a man lighting a cigarette for \"Joe Allen.\" Although background footage was filmed on location in New York City, contemporary news items indicate that many sequences were filmed at M-G-M's Culver City lot, where reproductions of the interiors of famous New York City landmarks, including Pennsylvania Station and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, were constructed. A biography of Minnelli notes that New York City was recreated through the use of photographic plates. The plates served as backdrops displayed through rear projection while the live action took place in front. Judy Garland recreated her role for the Lux Radio Theatre version of the story, which was broadcast on 28 Jan 1946. John Hodiak co-starred with Garland in the radio version.\n\nLess\n\nSoon after arriving in New York City to begin a two-day leave, Corporal Joe Allen meets Alice Maybery, an attractive secretary, and falls instantly in love with her.

Later that morning, Al brings Joe and Alice to his home, where Al's wife cooks breakfast for everyone. Mrs. Henry sees the love that is now obvious between Alice and Joe and suggests that they marry right away. Alice and Joe agree, but their wedding plans are later spoiled when they become separated in a crowded subway station. Joe and Alice begin a desperate search for each other, but both soon realize that they have too little information about each other to know where to look or ask authorities for help. Joe eventually finds Alice when they meet at Pennsylvania Station, and immediately takes her to City Hall to get married. A series of bureaucratic complications over blood tests delay their marriage, but Alice and Joe eventually get their City Hall wedding when they appeal their case directly to a judge. Disappointed by their rushed and spare wedding, Alice starts to cry, then she and Joe decide to repeat their vows in a church before Joe goes back to his post to resume his military service. With their vows firmly sealed, Joe bids Alice farewell the following morning, confident that they will be reunited as husband and wife when he returns from the war.\n\nLess"
