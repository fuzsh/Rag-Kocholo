        "text": "This weekend was exciting for me, as I was reminded why I have developed such a strong passion for the Great Gatsby: somewhere in the radiant, masterfully concocted world that Fitzgerald built, there is some metaphor that I have not recognized yet; and it is this type of artistry, this suffocating stranglehold Fitzgerald has on his prose that keeps me coming back to the novel. I view the Great Gatsby as the definitive masterpiece of American literature, and like Gatsby’s smile, it is the type of work that I may “only come across four or five times in life”.\n\nWith that said, I’d like to share my newest revelation regarding a specific scene in the novel: when Gatsby is first reunited with Daisy and breaks Nick’s clock. As a disclaimer, I can not call this a self-revelation, as the idea was sparked by a book that I recently read on the Great Gatsby: Chronology, Composition, and Narrative Technique in the Great Gatsby, by Thomas A. Pendleton.\n\nAlso, for those who are unfamiliar with the scene, you can watch the movie version of it here (starts at 2:30):\n\nWhen I first read the novel I thought very little of Gatsby’s blunder; I viewed it as sort of comic relief, and thought it was implemented to show how Gatsby’s cool, collective persona fades away when he is with Daisy. I thought it juxtaposed Gatsby’s character when he dealt with Daisy (clumsy and flustered) and Gatsby’s character when he dealt with every other character (cool, calm, collective) expertly, but I really didn’t see any other significance, which – looking back – was extremely naive of myself. As I wrote in an earlier blog post, themes that Fitzgerald touch on frequently is the permanence of the past and the significant of moving on in life. How I didn’t make the connection between Gatsby knocking over a clock, which is the physical representation of time, and these two themes absolutely bewilders me.\n\nA major internal struggle that Gatsby faces throughout the novel is the inability to move on in life; Gatsby is convinced that he can erase the last five years of Daisy and Tom’s marriage, and continue his relationship with Daisy as if time hadn’t skipped a second since his last encounter with her five years ago. The quote that most perfectly elicits this struggle of Gatsby is as followed:\n\n“Can’t repeat the past?” He cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!”\n\nSo back to the clock scene.\n\nGatsby drops the clock when he is first reunited with Daisy. Given that fact, I believe it is accurate to infer that in that moment, for Jay Gatsby, time stopped; life as he knew it without Daisy suddenly ceased to exist, and it was time to start a new life, built on rekindled love and the ability to be with Daisy. As readers we know for Gatsby, it was not enough for Daisy to simply leave Tom and start a life with him: it was necessary for Daisy to dismiss her marriage with Tom and act as if the last 5 years never happened. Gatsby wanted to vaporize the idea that at any point of time in Daisy’s life, she actually loved Tom; and given other evidence from the text, it is logical to assume that Gatsby’s breaking of the clock represents this.\n\n“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said, nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”\n\nHowever, what makes this scene so exciting is that I think it represents something completely different for the reader. For Gatsby I believe it represents his unrelenting obsession to recreate the past and dismiss the last five years as ever happening. For the reader, however, I believe the scene is meant to foreshadow the temporariness of Gatsby and Daisy’s relationship. One certainty of life is that it goes on. No matter what we do, or how hard we try, it is physically impossible to stop time from moving on. The clock continues to tick.\n\nGatsby drops the clock right before he and Daisy restart their relationship. The clock breaking is meant to signify this temporary relationship that is about to ensue. However, as I just stated, even when the clock breaks, time continues to drag on. Gatsby and Daisy’s relationship throughout the book is a short, non-permanent break from reality; a relationship that as readers we know will ultimately end, with life continuing on like nothing happened. Even when the clock is temporarily broken, we know that time is still ticking, life is still going on. Having the clock fall and break is Fitzgerald’s way of telling the reader, Gatsby and Daisy’s relationship is simply the clock breaking for a while. We can pretend it’s going to last, but eventually the reality of life is going to come crashing down.\n\nSort of like a vacation to Disney World: you go with your family to a magical fantasy land where everything is perfect for a few days, but even when you’re there, real life is happening beyond those walls, and eventually you have to come back to it\n\nGatsby and Daisy’s relationship is like your trip to Disney Word; it’s amazing and magic; but in the end it’s just fantasy.\n\nTime is still ticking, even if the clock is broken for a while.\n\nl\n\nNotes"
