        "text": "If you were wondering exactly how to read those pesky arm clocks in In Time, here's how.\n\nIn the movie, the society it takes place in, when you hit 25-years-old, a biological clock kicks in and you have exactly one year to live. The time is shown on your arm. Time is the commodity in this society. Things cost time and you can make time by working. This is how folks stay alive.\n\nBut some have asked how the bloody heck do you read the arm clock in the movie?\n\nThe arm clocks in In Time actually read as:\n\nyears-weeks-days-hours-minutes-seconds.\n\nThrough various scenes:\n\nAt one point, Will's mother's arm clock read “000-00-2-23-54-36″ or 2 days, 23 hours, 54 minutes and 36 seconds.\n\nBorel's (Will's best friend) baby had one year, and his arm read “0001-00-0-00-00-00.”\n\nAnd the clincher was when Sylvia Weise's arm clock turn on and her one year started, her arm clock read “0000-51-6-23-59-5.”"
