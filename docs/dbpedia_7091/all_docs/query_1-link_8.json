        "text": "I left Christian Marclay’s “The Clock” about twelve minutes after “High Noon.” I’d been there since about 10:30 A.M., thinking that I’d stay for about twenty minutes and get the feel of the thing; any longer, and the minutes might drag. But I was wrong. Time flew—it hypnotized. When I sat down, Bogart was trying to rouse a lady out of bed. (Pills.) A heist seemed to be underway in a train station. (I never found out how it went down, because I had to head to the subway for a doctor’s appointment before the action took place—in “The Clock,” you have to wait along with the criminals; there are no shortcuts here.) People kept waking up, appearing progressively guiltier as the hour grew later. Big Ben—perhaps the hero of this work?—appeared over and over, heroically standing tall against a deep blue sky in one clip. Later, a man hung off its minute hand, trying to stop time. Oh, if only!\n\nFor those who haven’t managed to make it to “The Clock,” it’s back in New York City, through August 1st, as part of the Lincoln Center Festival, and it’s one of those things you have to see. There’s no story in “The Clock,” just a carefully assembled series of film clips featuring clocks and watches, synced to real time (12:12 in life is 12:12 in the film), for twenty-four hours—a cinematic timepiece. The installation seats a limited number of people, so you can expect lines (check the Twitter feed for line updates), but waiting in line for a movie about time—a piece that has no beginning or end, only arbitrary points of entrance and exit—seems fitting. I was ready to be skeptical, having heard so much about the piece’s brilliance—might it not feel like a one-liner, in the end?—but the charms of “The Clock” are real. And there are many of them.\n\nFirst, it’s a kind of “Where’s Waldo?” for adults. “Where’s the clock in this scene?” you wonder. Oh, no clock, just Laurence Olivier with a skull. Right; time isn’t always measured on the face of watch. Second, there’s the pleasure the film buff takes in trying to identify the clips flashing by. (Some are easy: Christopher Walken intoning about the watch he kept up his ass. Delighted laughter in the room.) The joys of “The Clock” are intrinsically connected to its obsessive homage to cinema: to sit for an hour or so is to be treated to Jimmy Stewart’s smile; Jodie Foster, playing brilliant and nervous in “The Accused”; a young Robert Redford, nonchalant in a doorway, waiting for something to go down; Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren; Paul Newman, bursting off the screen. (I kept thinking, crassly, that on one level “The Clock” was the greatest Academy Awards montage ever.) But of course it’s more than that: it’s a meditation on time and our time—all the life spent sitting in front of glowing screens, all the real dreams tinged by Hollywood’s hold on our imaginations.\n\nStrangely enough, as a film, “The Clock” is really suspenseful. That’s because Marclay, who’s a sound artist, has arranged for the audio of various clips to bleed into the following clip, as Daniel Zalewski explains in his profile of Marclay, so that as the second hands tick toward noon, amped-up music from “Run Lola Run” “bleeds” from clip to clip, tricking the viewer (who knows that this is not a narrative film) into wondering “What on earth is going to happen at 12?” It won’t be a surprise to tell you that the bell tolls, the clocks strike noon, the large and small hands sync into a single line. And yet it feels like a momentous moment. Maybe this small pleasure is the piece’s truest one: the way “The Clock” dramatizes time all over again. And over again. “The Clock” is both a comment on and a reminder of how much of our lives we spend watching, not only our TVs and computers but our watches. Even on screen, everyone’s always living in time, checking out what’s going on, trying to find out when, exactly, they are.\n\nThough “The Clock” is a masterpiece, in its way, it’s not always serious: this is a crowd-pleaser, just like Big Ben. Marclay’s not above easy jokes. In one clip, a pink watering can gets kicked, blooming into a fiery explosion in the next. Near the hour, you hear the sound of a countdown—the sound “of actual time approaching.” You wonder what it could be. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper ride onto screen on motorcycles and pause. Fonda looks at his watch, takes it off, and tosses it to the ground before riding away. So much for actual time.\n\nBut for all the brilliant visual pleasures here, the most significant thing about “The Clock” is its sound editing. Marclay has made a movie that at once draws endless attention to its own artificiality and ruthlessly forces us to submit to it. Watch “The Clock” and you’ll be reminded that we’re crude creatures, craving suspense and narrative, however sophisticated we think we are. All Marclay has to do is rig the music from one clip this way or that, raise the volume, and our hearts leap, or fall, or contract in fear. A techno beat layered over Chaplin fussing with a clock’s hands gets our pulses racing, makes us wonder, what’s coming? What’s going to happen to the wife of the bank manager? Will she be shot, as the thieves have threatened? More than ever aware of artifice, we remain just as deeply (or perhaps more deeply than ever) under its power. It’s a delightful conundrum."
