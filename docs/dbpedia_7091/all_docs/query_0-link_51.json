        "text": "“The Clock, at its best, is so good that it inspires ingratitude for not being great”—Time\n\nA Manhattan office worker meets a World War II soldier at the onset of his 48-hour leave in New York City. Their evolving relationship is challenged when they lose each other in the subway; reunited, they attempt to surmount civic red tape in order to wed in the time remaining to them.\n\nGarland’s first non-singing role was lovingly shaped by director Minnelli, warmly complemented by Robert Walker’s sincerity, and atmospherically framed by recreations and process-shots of the “third character,” New York City. James and Lucile Gleason, Keenan Wynn, Ruth Brady, and Marshall Thompson lend vivid, telling support."
