With The House With a Clock In Its Walls, an adaptation of John Bellairs gothic fantasy, the director and Inglorious Basterds actor looks to change that.\n\nStarring Jack Black, Cate Blanchett, and Kyle MacLachlan, along with introducing Owen Vaccaro, the movie looks heaps of fun.\n\nThe new trailer sees Black and Blanchett reveal themselves as powerful controllers of magic who attempt to teach Vaccaro's young character their ways. However, the last tenant of their spooky mansion installed a clock in th walls (hence the title) which is counting down to something ominous happening.\n\n25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren't sequels\n\nShow all 25\n\nProduced by Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and writer Eric Kripke, the The House With a Clock In Its Walls reaches cinemas 21 September.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
