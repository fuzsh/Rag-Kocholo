        "text": "Last night's Academy Awards got us thinking about film and filmmaking. So for you, dear clock enthusiast, we've compiled a list of the must-see movies for clock lovers. Once you're done watching all the Oscar winners, be sure to add these to your list:\n\nTimer (2010) If a clock could predict the moment you'd meet your soul mate, would you want one? In this futuristic romantic comedy, a TiMER implanted in your wrist counts down to the exact minute you'll find true love. For some it's only a matter of days or months, others find they'll have to wait 20 years. But Oona O'Leary's TiMER has been blank since implantation. Tired of waiting for her perfect life partner, Oona breaks her own rules and falls for a charming young supermarket clerk with a countdown of four months. Lively and charming, this quirky film reminds us that the journey is more important than the destination.\n\nThe Clock (2010) is a 24-hour film compilation made up of thousands of scene snippets from classic films, all marking the passage of time minute by minute, sometimes second by second. When it debuted in New York five years ago, it was synchronized in such a way that the time on screen correlated to the actual time in New York. Vulture called it \"A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms; The Clock is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself â€” something almost inhuman.\"\n\nHugo (2011) Directed by Martin Scorcese and based on Brian Selznick's novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret, Hugo is an exhilarating visual masterpiece inspired by the art of cinema. We're first introduced to the movie's hero, 12-year-old Hugo, as he's peering out at 1931 Paris from behind the face of a massive train station clock. We learn that Hugo has just inherited the task of keeping the station's clocks running on time, but his personal quest is to protect a broken automaton and notebook left to him by his late father.\n\nBack to the Future (1985) Would we have ever gone Back to the Future if it weren't for that infamous clock tower? A young man is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence."
