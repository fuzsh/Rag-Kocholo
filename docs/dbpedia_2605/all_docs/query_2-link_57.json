        "text": "“… because it’s always a new experience, always a new fear of putting yourself out there to that extent, and always a new high and level of love when even one person reaches out and says how it affected them, or became a part of their life in some way. If you ever get tired of that or don’t care, you shouldn’t be making music.”\n\nPart III\n\nChapter Nine: Read between the li(n)es\n\nAnother one of my many compulsions is concept albums with thought-provoking track titles. In fact, I have to admit that I have cheekily paraphrased a few in various posts. There isn’t a single bvdub album that doesn’t revolve around a central theme and the titles read more like chapters of a book, epigrams and poem verses, collages of micro-contradictions or parts of a greater story that has to be told in a particular sequence. I also read religiously the liner notes; another fine and intricate detail – a ‘lost art’ which brings back fond childhood memories. Sadly they are often neglected or considered redundant in electronic music. Of course, music should do the talking, but some pieces of art call for an extended narrative.\n\nWalk us through the process of writing an album. You can omit the technical details as we have glorified the medium too often at the expense of the musical experience that matters.\n\nContinue reading “Songs for a life we left behind (w/ Brock Van Wey) – Part III”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n“Both ambient and drum & bass have always been the music of the future. And they always will be. Which is why they’ll always be there; getting stronger, going deeper. And they’ll never need any outsider’s bullshit help to do so”.\n\nPart II\n\nChapter Four: East Of Oceans\n\nI have an affinity for intriguing, memorable or even cryptic artist aliases. An attractive name won’t compensate for dreadful music, but for me it’s definitely a head-start and if there’s a chance to go down in musical history, then it’d better take place in style. ‘East of Oceans’ epitomizes the case and instantly caught my attention, before even knowing it’s a side-project of yours. In fact I’d even argue that it’s a nod to the concepts discussed in Part I; an ocean apart from a life you left behind, eastern promises, the journey to the unknown. Is this an alter ego free from expectations and musical agendas, or just another guise created to accommodate for music that somehow doesn’t fit under the bvdub umbrella?\n\nYeah, with both that and Earth House Hold, I think it took people a lot of time to figure out who it was. Which is fine, it’s about the music, not about who makes it; otherwise I would only use one name for everything I guess. You are correct (once again) in your hypothesis on leaving life behind, promises afar (in the East, where I resided) and the unknown, they’re all definitely part of the name. I think these, among other things, combine to form (or perhaps be free of form) something that, yeah, just “is”. I myself honestly couldn’t tell you how to classify any music I make under that name. It’s a much more euphoric, no-holds-barred project that I am only rarely in the right head-state to journey into (thus the much smaller amount of releases), but when I am, it’s amazing and amazingly free. Again with the whole love or hate thing, but I think that one gets more hate than any other of my stuff (haha). Some people get it, a lot don’t and I’ve gotten a lot of flak over the years from fans of my more well-known work, who said it’s “cheesy” etc. I think they just don’t get where it’s coming from. It’s tapping into times and ideas of pure euphoria and escape, rather than the introspection of my other work, so I can get where it’s a bit of a shock to the system if you’re expecting something else. But you just need to let yourself go and have a good time with it and basically just fucking jam, because that’s what it’s for.\n\nOr you can do none of that and think it’s cheesy and hate it. Also OK (haha).\n\nContinue reading “Songs for a life we left behind (w/ Brock Van Wey) – Part II”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n“The voice of ambient, grown up, grown emotional, grown wiser and grown eloquent.”\n\nFor the last few of years I’ve been on a quest to trace those elusive gossamer links between the drum & bass and ambient cultures. Although as genres they might seem oceans apart, I’d still argue that their musical trajectories converge, unlocking something magical, capturing that moment in time and that beautiful place, which both are tantalizingly at your fingertips, but are always out of reach. In the back of my mind there has been always a certain artist, whose musical work not only envelops the concept, but his poetic eloquence, his flair for the dramatic, his esoteric and philosophical approach to music, art and life has mesmerized a global and varied audience.\n\nI have been too timid to ask for a feature/interview, but this summer the stars aligned and I have the privilege and pleasure to host Brock Van Wey for an in-depth discussion. Aficionados will recognize that the head title is paraphrased from one of my favourite bvdub albums (Songs For A Friend I Left Behind, Distant Noise, 2011). In fact that very album was my introduction to Brock’s music and the title seems even more apt now, that he’s moving back to his home country after 20 years in China.\n\nEnter stage right; Brock revisits old habits from a distance, flips through the chapters of his life book and narrates the stories behind the musical notes, from the obvious to the far-fetched, the tangible to the abstract, the mundane to the profound, essentially what the sleeve notes will never tell you.\n\nContinue reading “Songs for a life we left behind (w/ Brock Van Wey) – Part I”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s no secret that I am a Klute fanboy; I’ve been following him since his first production forays for the Ipswich-based imprint Certificate 18. More than 25 years later, 9 studio albums and countless singles and remixes for literally every label that matters, his sound is still as relevant as ever.\n\nHe has now remastered and re-issued his entire C18 collection of singles for the first time in superior digital format through his revered label Commercial Suicide. It’s a golden chance to re-live and recapture a time and place that has left an indelible print on the d&b history book, or even some great new discovery for a new generation of listeners. Whichever the case, head over to the label’s official webpage here to read one of the genre’s most compelling stories about how it all started, featuring many familiar names, narrated by Klute himself in his unique way of storytelling.\n\nIt is the story of an artist at his very beginning working closely with a label that shared a vision for a finite period before things imploded, a snapshot tracing the dots from the origins of Klute into the new millennium when drum & bass started to splinter off into smithereens …\n\nPreview and purchase links for 17 timeless classics:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWe would talk for hours on the phone, him asking me questions, sharing ideas and tips. Soon we were both releasing music for Tom from Redeye’s labels ‘Deep Red’ and ‘Fresh 86’. The rest, as we say, was history … [Klute]\n\nThis month is my blog’s 9th anniversary. I never really expected that nine years and 120 features later it would be still around, but here we are. Reflecting on those years, so much has changed in my personal life and everywhere around us that it seems like worlds apart from those timid beginnings. Reconciling the arrogance, the naivety, old obsessions and spent ideals of a past life with a new reality of different priorities, the blogging experience has been frustrating and cathartic at the same time, like a confessional love letter to music; wavering between posting and shredding it to pieces.\n\nThe fundamental idea has always been to keep a personal musical diary and document those musical memories before they inevitably fade into oblivion; hidden annexes littered with thoughts left just as they were on the day they were captured, music you’ll probably never have time to listen to again, locked in its own era. Once again, a big heartfelt thank you to all readers, either regulars or those who have stumbled upon the blog by chance; the interaction with like-minded people has been the greatest reward.\n\nContinue reading “Tracks I Wish I’d Written (issue #22): Spirit – Life Goes On”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFollowing the recent release of Illuvia’s d&b album ‘Iridescence of Clouds’ on A Strangely Isolated Place, I’m proud to present my contribution to the ASIP ‘Portals’ series. Tracing the links from the halcyon days of the 90s to the present, from the classic to the obscure, this is a selection of 26 tracks showcasing the evolution of the atmospheric d&b sound or at least my own perception. The feature is supplemented with a mix, liner notes and fan facts. A long trip down memory lane for d&b fans, as well as an introduction of atmospheric drum & bass to a non-d&b audience. I hope this feature served its purpose and that you’ll enjoy it as much as we did.\n\nYou can read the original post here and listen to the mix on Soundcloud, Mixcloud or the ASIP Podcast.\n\nFor archiving purposes, I attach the full transcript of the feature below.\n\nWords and layout by Ryan Griffin/ASIP\n\nComments in italics and track notes by Spyros/GodIsNoLongerADj\n\nContinue reading “Portals: Atmospheric Drum & Bass Vistas”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n“When someone isn’t there any more, the empty space is charged with emotional power. As if the act of vanishing leaves behind an ethereal, supernatural signature. As ever, the closing of one door leads to the opening of another. Without the experience of loss, this album would not be in existence and that is a silver sliver of light in an otherwise clouded sky. Everything at once, then nothing …” – ‘The Sound of Someone Leaving’ Liner Notes\n\nIt’s that time of the year again. Like you haven’t suffered enough, the list with my favourite 2020 releases, which I find worthy of your attention (and your credit card) is here. Amidst a second wave of the pandemic, where our social reflexes have been stretched to the limit, one of the positives in this mess is that home listening is no longer relegated to background music until dinner is ready; it’s become a routine to look forward to, a refuge and a remedy. So, I would like to take the opportunity once again to thank all artists and record labels for gracing this relentless year with their beautiful music, channelling isolation and insecurity into works of art, safeguarding the passion and the romance. A complicated epoch triggers complicated emotions and music can be the nostalgic reminder of simpler times.\n\nBandcamp has launched an initiative to support the many artists, who have seen their livelihoods disrupted by the pandemic this year. On the first Friday of every month since March, they have waived their revenue share and plan to continue accordingly in the next year, on February 5th, March 5th, April 2nd, and May 7th. More details here.\n\nContinue reading “Liner notes on 2020 – Part I”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
