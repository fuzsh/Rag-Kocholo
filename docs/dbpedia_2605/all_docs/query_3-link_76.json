        "text": "While he was at the College, Bray joined his first band, Aftermath, along with Roger O’Donnell (1967), Peter Dimattina (1968) and Terry Shannon (1967). “We were the first “band” to ever play at the De La Salle Amateur night,” he said. Bray initially worked as a civil engineer designing roads, caravan parks and sub-divisions, but by the time he was 24, he realised that engineering wasn’t for him so he turned his talents to music, joined a band and hit the road. A decision that would change his life. “The money I was earning as an engineer was good, but I thought I had to try and “make it”, as they say, so I became a full-time musician.”\n\n“Playing the role of “house-hubby” by day and a musician by night, worked well and I was able to spend more quality time with my wife and kids.” ‘After a while I decided to get a “real job”, so I started working at the Billy Hyde Drum Clinic in the wholesale section. Since then, I have worked in a variety of music companies combining my love of music with a day job.” “My career in the music wholesale industry has lasted 44 years, ending when I retired in June last year. I still play in a band, The Two Dogs Band, and probably enjoy it more now than I ever did - no pressure anymore! I will continue playing music until I can’t. I mainly play guitar, but I sing as well, something I learnt at De La Salle.” “Growing up in the 50’s and 60’s, I was initially influenced by folk music then rock n’ roll and I was fortunate to be able to utilise the skills I learned at school to further my musical career.” “Playing with Mark Gillespie (1966) for two years was one of my career highlights. I was so lucky to reconnect with him last year, before he passed away, it is something that will never leave me…he was special!” “Other highlights were meeting fellow musicians, Carlos Santana, Joe Walsh and many more “stars”!” “I was fortunate to have a very happy childhood, which really started out at the College. I am lucky to have remained close friends with many guys from the College including Mick Brudenell (1967), Chris Meehan (1967), Bob Larkin (1966) and Tim Taylor (1967), to name a few.” ‘Music and theatre were my loves at school (along with studies, of course), providing me a great base to build my life on and I am grateful to have this school as my choice of education.” “Over the years I proudly say that I mentored many musicians and salespeople in the music game, something that has given me immense satisfaction and pleasure.” Bray says his life is full. “My wife, my children and grandchildren, all are very special to me.” As well as a Diploma in Civil Engineering, Bray has completed studies in music and musical instrument distribution."
