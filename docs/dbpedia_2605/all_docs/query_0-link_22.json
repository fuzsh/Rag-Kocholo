        "text": "28 April 2023, Sydney, Australia\n\nYou can read some analysis of this speech in this Speakola newsletter post\n\nWell thank you very much, Kimmy. I was gonna say all that. Now I can’t say anything because you said it all.\n\nYeah, that Olympics gig.\n\nWe we were on our way to that show, that biggest gig in the world, the Sydney Olympics. And first of all, Australians have a strange use of the word \"or\". Like, if you're at an airport and you've got a bunch of musicians and guitars, drums and keyboards, someone will eventually sidle up to you and say, \"youse in a band orrrr.....\". And there's nothing else you could possibly be! You're getting on a plane and you're going to Sydney. There's nowhere else you could be going and they'll say \"youse going to Sydney orrrr...\".\n\nWe were on our way to the Olympics gig and first of all, we're in this minivan with this guy who had a nose like a muscateale grape. He'd done some plucky elbow work and he kept on driving along. It was me and Greg and he's driving along and he's going, \"Oh, I love youse blokes. Yeah I love youse blokes. I don't like this new stuff but oh I love youse blokes.\" And I said, \"Yeah, can you just keep your eyes on the road?\" And he gets to a big hangar where we were rehearsing for three or four days and there's a gate and a guy with a clipboard.\n\nHe goes, \"Who you got there, mate?\n\nAnd he goes, \"Ahhh.... The men from down under?\".\n\nAnd he says \"not down here mate\".\n\n\"Danger? Men at work?\"\n\n\"No danger, mate. No, just men at work.\"\n\n\"Yeah that's it yeah!\".\n\nSo we go in and we get out of the car and this big civilian guy gets out of the car and he goes, \"Don't worry about a thing. On the night, stand on one spot, somebody will come to get you. Stand on that spot, he'll take you to another spot. Stand on that spot and somebody else will come to get you, take you to another spot, all right? And then walk across the field, get on the stage. Don't worry about a thing, mate. We’re professionals.\"\n\nSo we go and we rehearse this thing for three or four days and it's like everybody's there with thousands of big sharks and it's a massive production. And we rehearsed it very well. Eleven times. We went on after Kylie Minogue, and it's 160,000 people going to be in the stadium and, as they said, 4 billion people watching around the world. And it was quite nerve wracking. On the night we're standing in one spot, somebody came to get us, took us to another spot. We stood in that spot, and then somebody gave us ears to put in. We stood in that spot. Somebody took us down the down the tunnel, and it's a big, huge, 160,000 crowd. And we thought \"This is incredible!\" We stood in that spot. And then somebody else took us around to the very last spot before we had to walk across the field to the back of the stage.\n\nAnd we're standing there for what seemed like too long. And I remembered when we rehearsed it at this point, when Kylie was doing her song, we were already walking up to the stage. And we weren't. We were just standing there. And I turned round to Greg, and I don't know what he'd taken, he was foaming at the mouth. And he said, \"I don't think we're supposed to be here, mate …\".\n\nAnd just as he said that, the girl said into the walkie talkie, \"Somebody coming to get you, orrrr ...?\".\n\nAnd then we just sprinted across the field and got on the stage just in time for the guy to say, ‘ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Men At Work’. And we did the thing, and it was incredible singing the song, and Jimmy was there. He sang in the end, if you check out, it's really fantastic. Everyone was there. And afterwards we're out to the green room, and the guy that first met us from the minivan, he stood there and he goes, \"How bloody good was that mate hey? Fuckin' enormous mate, fuckin' enormous! Yers CARVED it!\"\n\nAnd I said, you know how you said to stand in one spot?\n\nHe goes, \"yeah\".\n\nI said, “well, somebody came to get us.”\n\nHe goes \"yeah\".\n\n“And then we went to another spot.”\n\nHe goes, \"yeah”.\n\nI said, “Somebody came to get us”.\n\nAnd he goes, \"yeah\".\n\nI said, “we stood the last spot”. I said, \"Fucking nobody came to get us!\".\n\nHe said \"Nobody came to get yers?\"\n\nI said “no!”.\n\nHe goes, \"Well, mate, you worked it out. You're a professional.\"\n\nSo I'm almost embarrassed at such an effusive intro.\n\nAlmost. But I failed the Leaving Certificate. First of all, I was born on the Southwest coast of Scotland.\n\nOne day my father said, \"Right, pack your bags, were off to Australia\".\n\nI said, \"Is that a long way, Daddy\"?\n\nHe said, \"Oh, yes, it’s as far as you can go before you have to start coming back again\".\n\nSo we came here and everything was different. I had this kind of accent when I came, and people would say to me, \"What kind of accent that you got, mate?\" I said it was a Scottish accent. \"You can't talk like that mate. You gotta learn how to talk like us\".\n\nSo I learned how to speak like an Australian bloke, just to assimilate, not to get into too many fights. And it was very different. Accents were very different. I come from a small town called Saltcoats. You've probably never heard of it.\n\nAnd everything was different from Saltcoats. And you would go surfing and your friend's mother would drive you down the surf and you fancied your friend's mother because she was hot. And that was also very different because you never fancied anybody's mother from Saltcoats. I apologise to all the mothers in Saltcoats.\n\nAnyway, I failed Leaving, the High School Certificate in 1971, and I came to Australia. Over the next few years, I slowly became an idiot.\n\n1971, I failed Leaving. And so I was devastated and so were my parents. I repeated it and now I did the matriculation year. And that's when I met my friend Kim Gyngell, some 51 years ago, as he said, and we connected immediately.\n\nWe would experiment with our respective floor shows for whomever would listen. And indeed, I was Kim's straight man for his first scribblings of Kim's character, Col'n Carpenter, which was born during that time. I was happy to be a straight man and still am. Indeed, Men At Work would not have existed if it hadn't been for Kim, because one day he introduced me to a beautiful, blonde, bright eyed, sharp witted, multitalented lad called Gregory Norman Ham, who I miss every day. So, Kimny, I thank you for your love and friendship this past half century and for making me laugh from a place that no one else does.\n\nIf I hadn't have failed Leaving, though, I would never have met Kim. Proof perhaps that apparent failure can later manifest into a more profound and successful destiny. I would like to thank a few people Milly Petriella, Dean Ormston and everyone at APRA AMCOS for bestowing upon me this prestigious award.\n\nI love APRA. They were the first corporate entity that didn't make me feel weird or insecure about following the path of being a songwriter. I'd like to thank Peter Karpin for signing Men at Work back in 1981, Peter Mclan for producing the Men at Work albums, and John Anderson, who was at EMI Music Publishing for many years. Damien Trotter at Sony Music Publishing for looking after the songs, but also for being my friend these past 40 years or so. Nanette Fox for being such a great manager and friend down here in Australia. Michael McMartin, who received this award in 2007. Michael gave me some great advice in 1991 when I called him up, complaining about something. He said, \"Oh, you're wallowing in self pity. If you try a little harder, you can become your better person\".\n\nAnd he was right. So I thank him for that.\n\nMy friend Mario Maccarone, who's here, who gave me a gig at the Continental down in Melbourne, one of the greatest venues you could ever play at, which is, sadly, no longer there. He gave me a gig when I couldn't get one from anywhere else.\n\nSo tell me, by the way, I know you've been sitting here for a long time, but I'll just speak for a wee while longer, because as Kim said before, hearing Uncle Archie before was quite moving. One Song, that's it. It says all for me. You start with nothing and then hopefully, at the end of some period of time, you have something. And it took me a long time to realize that.\n\nMy old band Men at Work, which I was very proud to be in. Unfortunately, we had a short but extraordinary run, and I'll kind of sum it up in a way with a few words, a little poem:\n\nWe opened up for Fleetwood Mac.\n\nA lucky break. A sneak attack.\n\nIt was only going one way back then\n\nTo the Stratosphere and back again.\n\n15 weeks at number one.\n\nWe toured two trips around the sun.\n\nWe were kings of the world in 1981.\n\nI remember the moment it stopped being fun.\n\nThe end of 83, we were done.\n\nIt was over fast before we begun\n\nTo be sure, the music remains\n\nit floats in the air through the supermarkets and summer state fairs\n\nIt was a once in a lifetime, I don't care.\n\nI got to the summit, I was there.\n\nAt the end of the 80s I had to leave this fair land. I was getting divorced and I was having trouble with the drink. And I had a record deal based in Los Angeles.\n\nSo I thought, off I go. And all my friends thought I was mad. And I had all kinds of beautiful friends, highly functioning, successful people, but big drinkers. And I was becoming an alcoholic. And it's not the kind of thing you want to realise straight away. You want to get at least 35 or 40 years of heavy drinking behind you, before you realise that, but I realized it quite quickly. And they really thought I was crazy. \"What are you going to go and live over there for, you’re fucking mad, mate? Stay here, mate. Stay here, mate. You're fine, mate. You're not an alcoholic. You’re just like us.\"\n\nSo I went to Los Angeles and I made one record. Then I was promptly dropped by MCA Records. So I had no record deal, no booking agent, no management. So I just went on the road around 1991.\n\nAnd I'm still on the road. I thought it would be a temporary thing, a distraction, while I plotted and schemed and figured out how to once again reach the lofty peaks of superstardom, where I firmly believed I belonged.\n\nI thought I'd be offered another record deal from an LA based label. But that was not to be. Indeed, I continued to tour, solo mostly, for 13 years. It's not for everyone, it's not for the faint of heart. But it was the only way to find my audience out there in the world.\n\nGradually, I realized that the path I was on was where I was meant to be. Audiences wanted something from me. Old songs, new songs, in between songs, to connect at a deep level. Playing solo to audiences all over the world was habit forming. Nourishing, unpredictable.\n\nA current forms and I feel connected. It's a frequency that's palpable. When I was finally able to stop drinking all those years ago, I remember standing out in the backyard. I stretched my hands up to the sky, yet my feet were on the ground. I felt plugged in. A part of everything. Not separate. I had a place in the world. I still have a place in the world.\n\nMost of all, I feel useful. And to me, that's an important thing to feel. My professional life involves three stages. Writing songs, producing and recording them, and going on the road and playing for people. The rest of the time, I'm at home perfecting my recipe for seared Brussels sprouts, a much maligned vegetable which has seen, perhaps like myself, a welcome renaissance in popularity in recent times.\n\nSomeone asked me the other day if I would recommend songwriting as a vocation. I answered them by saying I started writing songs when I was 14 years old. I couldn't help it. Some ten years later, I co- wrote Down Under. It took 40 minutes to write (without a flute line) and it has sustained me for 40 years.\n\nBut even if it hadn't, I still would be writing songs. I can't imagine doing anything more worthwhile after breakfast. So, yes, I highly recommend it. Indeed, in the words of the great Kurt Vonnegut:\n\n\"Go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow for heaven's sake! Sing in the shower, dance to the radio, tell stories, write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can.You'll get an enormous reward. You will have created something!’\n\nThank you very much.\n\nAnalysis of this speech in Speakola newsletter\n\n14 March 2005, Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, USA\n\nUno, dos, tres, catorce. That translates as one, two, three, fourteen. That is the correct math for a rock and roll band. For in art and love and rock and roll, the whole had better equal much more than the sum of its parts, or else you're just rubbing two sticks together searching for fire. A great rock band searches for the same kind of combustible force that fueled the expansion of the universe after the big bang. You want the earth to shake and spit fire. You want the sky to split apart and for God to pour out.\n\nIt's embarrassing to want so much, and to expect so much from music, except sometimes it happens -- the Sun Sessions, Highway 61, Sgt. Peppers, the Band, Robert Johnson, Exile on Main Street, Born to Run -- whoops, I meant to leave that one out (laughter) -- the Sex Pistols, Aretha Franklin, the Clash, James Brown, the power of Public Enemy's \"It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back\". This is music meant to take on not only the powers that be, but on a good day, the universe and God himself -- if he was listening. It's man's accountability, and U2 belongs on this list.\n\nIt was the early '80s. I went with Pete Townsend, who always wanted to catch the first whiff of those about to unseat us, to a club in London. There they were: A young Bono -- single-handedly pioneering the Irish mullet; (laughter) the Edge -- what kind of name was that?; Adam and Larry. I was listening to the last band of whom I would be able to name all of its members. They had an exciting show and a big, beautiful sound. They lifted the roof.\n\nWe met afterwards and they were nice young men. They were Irish. Irish! Now, this would play an enormous part in their success in the States. For what the English occasionally have the refined sensibilities to overcome, we Irish and Italians have no such problem. We come through the door fists and hearts first. U2, with the dark, chiming sound of heaven at their command -- which, of course, is the sound of unrequited love and longing, their greatest theme -- their search for God intact. This was a band that wanted to lay claim to not only this world but had their eyes on the next one, too.\n\nNow, they're a real band; each member plays a vital part. I believe they actually practice some form of democracy -- toxic poison in a band's head. In Iraq, maybe. In rock, no! Yet they survive. They have harnessed the time bomb that exists in the heart of every great rock and roll band that usually explodes, as we see regularly from this stage. But they seemed to have innately understood the primary rule of rock band job security: \"Hey, asshole, the other guy is more important than you think he is!\" They are both a step forward and direct descendants of the great bands who believed rock music could shake things up in the world, who dared to have faith in their audience, who believed if they played their best it would bring out the best in you. They believed in pop stardom and the big time. Now this requires foolishness and a calculating mind. It also requires a deeply held faith in the work you're doing and in its powers to transform. U2 hungered for it all, and built a sound, and they wrote the songs that demanded it. They're keepers of some of the most beautiful sonic architecture in rock and roll.\n\nThe Edge. The Edge. The Edge. The Edge. (applause) He is a rare and true guitar original and one of the subtlest guitar heroes of all time. He's dedicated to ensemble playing and he subsumes his guitar ego in the group. But do not be fooled. Take Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, Neil Young, Pete Townshend -- guitarists who defined the sound of their band and their times. If you play like them, you sound like them. If you are playing those rhythmic two-note sustained fourths, drenched in echo, you are going to sound like the Edge, my son. Go back to the drawing board and chances are you won't have much luck. There are only a handful of guitar stylists who can create a world with their instruments, and he's one of them. The Edge's guitar playing creates enormous space and vast landscapes. It is a thrilling and a heartbreaking sound that hangs over you like the unsettled sky. In the turf it stakes out, it is inherently spiritual. It is grace and it is a gift.\n\nNow, all of this has to be held down by something. The deep sureness of Adam Clayton's bass and the rhythms of Larry Mullen's elegant drumming hold the band down while propelling it forward. It's in U2's great rhythm section that the band finds its sexuality and its dangerousness. Listen to \"Desire,\" \"She Moves in Mysterious Ways,\" [sic] the pulse of \"With or Without You.\" Together Larry and Adam create the element that suggests the ecstatic possibilities of that other kingdom -- the one below the earth and below the belt -- that no great rock band can lay claim to the title without.\n\nNow Adam always strikes me as the professorial one, the sophisticated member. He creates not only the musical but physical stability on his side of the stage. The tone and depth of his bass playing has allowed the band to move from rock to dance music and beyond. One of the first things I noticed about U2 was that underneath the guitar and the bass, they have these very modern rhythms going on. Rather than a straight 2 and 4, Larry often plays with a lot of syncopation, and that connects the band to modern dance textures. The drums often sounded high and tight and he was swinging down there, and this gave the band a unique profile and allowed their rock textures to soar above on a bed of his rhythm.\n\nNow Larry, of course, besides being an incredible drummer, bears the burden of being the band's requisite \"good-looking member,\" (laughter) something we somehow overlooked in the E Street Band. (laughter) We have to settle for \"charismatic.\" Girls love on Larry Mullen! I have a female assistant that would like to sit on Larry's drum stool. A male one, too. We all have our crosses to bear.\n\nBono...where do I begin? Jeans designer, soon-to-be World Bank operator, just plain operator, seller of the Brooklyn Bridge -- oh hold up, he played under the Brooklyn Bridge, that's right. Soon-to-be mastermind operator of the Bono burger franchise, where more than one million stories will be told by a crazy Irishman. Now I realize that it's a dirty job and somebody has to do it, but don't quit your day job yet, my friend. You're pretty good at it, and a sound this big needs somebody to ride herd over it.\n\nAnd ride herd over it he does. His voice, big-hearted and open, thoroughly decent no matter how hard he tries. Now he's a great frontman. Against the odds, he is not your mom's standard skinny, ex-junkie archetype. He has the physique of a rugby player...well, an ex-rugby player. Shaman, shyster, one of the greatest and most endearingly naked messianic complexes in rock and roll. (laughter) God bless you, man! It takes one to know one, of course.\n\nYou see, every good Irish and Italian-Irish front man knows that before James Brown there was Jesus. So hold the McDonald arches on the stage set, boys, we are not ironists. We are creations of the heart and of the earth and of the stations of the cross -- there's no getting out of it. He is gifted with an operatic voice and a beautiful falsetto rare among strong rock singers. But most important, his is a voice shot through with self-doubt. That's what makes that big sound work. It is this element of Bono's talent -- along with his beautiful lyric writing -- that gives the often-celestial music of U2 its fragility and its realness. It is the questioning, the constant questioning in Bono's voice, where the band stakes its claim to its humanity and declares its commonality with us.\n\nNow Bono's voice often sounds like it's shouting not over top of the band but from deep within it. \"Here we are, Lord, this mess, in your image.\" He delivers all of this with great drama and an occasional smirk that says, \"Kiss me, I'm Irish.\" He's one of the great front men of the past twenty years. He is also one of the only musicians to devote his personal faith and the ideals of his band into the real world in a way that remains true to rock's earliest implications of freedom and connection and the possibility of something better.\n\nNow the band's beautiful songwriting -- \"Pride (In The Name of Love),\" \"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\" \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,\" \"One,\" \"Where the Streets Have No Name,\" \"Beautiful Day\" -- reminds us of the stakes that the band always plays for. It's an incredible songbook. In their music you hear the spirituality as home and as quest. How do you find God unless he's in your heart? In your desire? In your feet? I believe this is a big part of what's kept their band together all of these years.\n\nSee, bands get formed by accident, but they don't survive by accident. It takes will, intent, a sense of shared purpose, and a tolerance for your friends' fallibilities...and they of yours. And that only evens the odds. U2 has not only evened the odds but they've beaten them by continuing to do their finest work and remaining at the top of their game and the charts for 25 years. I feel a great affinity for these guys as people as well as musicians.\n\nWell...there I was sitting down on the couch in my pajamas with my eldest son. He was watching TV. I was doing one of my favorite things -- I was tallying up all the money I passed up in endorsements over the years (laughter) and thinking of all the fun I could have had with it. Suddenly I hear \"Uno, dos, tres, catorce!\" I look up. But instead of the silhouettes of the hippie wannabes bouncing around in the iPod commercial, I see my boys!\n\nOh, my God! They sold out!\n\nNow...what I know about the iPod is this: It is a device that plays music. Of course their new song sounded great, my guys are doing great, but methinks I hear the footsteps of my old tape operator Jimmy Iovine somewhere. Wily. Smart. Now, personally, I live an insanely expensive lifestyle that my wife barely tolerates. I burn money, and that calls for huge amounts of cash flow. But I also have a ludicrous image of myself that keeps me from truly cashing in. (laughter) You can see my problem. Woe is me.\n\nSo the next morning, I call up Jon Landau -- or as I refer to him, \"the American Paul McGuinness\" -- and I say, \"Did you see that iPod thing?\" And he says, \"Yes.\" And he says, \"And I hear they didn't take any money.\" And I said, \"They didn't take any money?!\" And he says, \"No.\" I said, \"Smart, wily Irish guys.\" (laughter) Anybody...anybody...can do an ad and take the money. But to do the ad and not take the money...that's smart. That's wily. I say, \"Jon, I want you to call up Bill Gates or whoever is behind this thing and float this: A red, white, and blue iPod signed by Bruce \"the Boss\" Springsteen. Now remember, no matter how much money he offers, don't take it!\" (laughter)\n\nAt any rate...at any rate, after that evening, for the next month or so, I hear emanating from my lovely 14-year-old son's room, day after day, down the hall calling out in a voice that has recently dropped very low: Uno, dos, tres, catorce. The correct math for rock and roll. Thank you, boys.\n\n(applause)\n\nThis band...this band has carried their faith in the great inspirational and resurrective power of rock and roll. It never faltered, only a little bit. They believed in themselves, but more importantly, they believed in \"you, too.\" Thank you Bono, the Edge, Adam, and Larry. Please welcome U2 into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n13 March 2019,. Hilton Austin, Texas, USA\n\nI am going to begin today with a quote from Marshall McLuhan from his 1962 book, “The Gutenberg Galaxy”:\n\n“Instead of tending toward a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside.”\n\nI would like to come to you today with a message of unity and love and peace, and I will try to get there by the end, but I have to begin by stating a fact that must be becoming obvious to most people by now- the fact that we are in a battle, a battle for the survival of our species, and our enemy, is within.\n\nThree weeks ago in a landmark report on disinformation and fake news, the British parliament said that Facebook and other big tech companies “should be subject to a compulsory code of ethics to tackle … the abuse of users’ data and the bullying of smaller firms.”\n\nThe report says, “Companies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like ‘digital gangsters’ in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law.”\n\nThe Guardian wrote that this is the first “comprehensive attempt of a major legislative body to peer into the … economy of data manipulation and voter influence.”\n\nDamian Collins, chair of the parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said, “The guiding principle of the ‘move fast and break things’ culture [is] that it is better to apologize than ask permission. We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people.”\n\nIn The New Yorker’s Feb. 25, 2019 report titled “Private Mossad for Hire,” Uzi Shaya, a former senior Israeli intelligence officer, said, “Social media allows you to reach virtually anyone and to play with their minds. You can do whatever you want. You can be whoever you want. It’s a place where wars are fought, elections are won, and terror is promoted. There are no regulations. It is a no man’s land.”\n\nMarshall McLuhan began his work as a follower of the French Catholic idealist philosopher, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Teilhard believed that the electronic universe was an extension of our nervous systems and would knit us together into a godhead, which he called “the Omega Point”. McLuhan, also a Catholic, started there, but by the end of his life, he believed that the electronic universe was a “blatant manifestation of the Antichrist.” Satan, he said, “is a very great electric engineer.”\n\nThe Internet has failed.\n\nHere is a quote from Tim Berners-Lee, who drew the original diagram for the world wide web on a napkin, and who now has Dr. Frankenstein’s remorse.\n\n“We demonstrated that the Web had failed instead of served humanity, as it was supposed to have done, and failed in many places. [The Web] has ended up producing—with no deliberate action of the people who designed the platform — a large-scale emergent phenomenon which is anti-human.”\n\nAs the Internet pioneer Ethan Zuckerman of MIT recently wrote, “It’s obvious now that what we did was a fiasco, so let me remind you that what we wanted to do was something brave and noble.” What they wanted to do was to create a communication system that was decentralized and cooperative. One of the early networks that Stewart Brand and Ken Kesey built was called the Whole Earth Lectronic Link. That’s how utopian their aspirations were. But today there is a growing understanding that the internet has morphed into an insidious surveillance and propaganda machine.\n\nBerners-Lee has said he is “devastated” by what his creation has become, and he is working to “re-decentralize” the web with a new project he calls Solid. I sincerely wish him the best of luck, but from where I stand, we would do well to scrap this first internet project- we should break up these advertising platform monopolies, and we should start from scratch to build an electronic communications system founded on hard and fast ethics rather than utopian fantasies.\n\n(Thomas More coined the word Utopia from two Greek words- eutopia, which meant a good place and outopia, which meant no place at all.)\n\nBy now, it is clear that what was begun as a mission to connect and unite mankind has mutated into a pernicious distortion machine that has disconnected mankind and put us at each other’s throats, and in doing so has destroyed and is destroying institutions and knowledge that have taken centuries to develop.\n\nAs my friend Roger McNamee says, at this point it is all the rest of us against the 130,000 or so employees of Facebook and Google, whose objective it is to hybridize us with machines. Ray Kurzweil, Google’s Director of Engineering, predicts that humans will be hybrids by the year 2030. Their goal is to automate us.\n\nIn the beginning of the last century, Sigmund Freud’s nephew, Edward Bernays, realized that he could use his uncle’s concepts- such as the understanding that we are driven to act by unconscious impulses- to control and manipulate mass culture.\n\nAt the beginning of the first world war, Bernays was the press agent for Enrico Caruso, plying the trade that was then called propaganda. He had run many successful campaigns, and as the United States entered the war, he worked for Woodrow Wilson to promote the idea the we were fighting not to restore the old empires of Europe, but rather to “Make the world safe for democracy.” By positioning Wilson as the “Liberator of the people, who would create a new world were the individual would be free”, he was able to make Wilson a hero of the masses.\n\nThe throngs that greeted Wilson upon his arrival at the Paris Peace talks gave Bernays the insight that if this sort of mass manipulation could be used during war, it could be used during peace.\n\nAfter the war, with the Germans giving propaganda a bad name, Bernays rebranded his practice, opening the Council on Public Relations — a phrase he coined — and began working for various corporations including the American Tobacco Corporation. At the time there was a taboo against women smoking and Bernays was asked to break that taboo so that the company could sell more cigarettes.\n\nDuring the 1929 Easter parade around Central Park in New York, Bernays arranged for a group of debutantes to hide cigarettes under their clothes and, at an arranged corner, pull out and light what he called “Torches of Freedom.” Having notified the international press of the event, there were scores of photographers — including ones hired by Bernays — at that corner, and the pictures went out all over the world. In that one symbolic act, he was able to link a woman’s right to smoke with a woman’s right to vote — with the Women’s Liberation Movement. He linked a woman smoking a cigarette with the Statue of Liberty. Those pictures snapped the world.\n\nThis devious process has now been mechanized and automated.\n\nUntil England recently joined the fray, Germany had been leading the world on the extreme dangers of the Facebook and Google monopolies, because Germany in the 1920s, was the first country to fall into a propaganda created mass hypnosis. The Germans have felt it.\n\nHistorian Robert Ensor wrote at the time that “Hitler puts no limit on what can be done by propaganda; people will believe anything, provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough, and that contradicters are either silenced or smothered in calumny.”\n\nThis, of course, is all too familiar.\n\nTo stay human, to survive as a species, we have to wrest our communications out of the control of the lust for power, the avarice, larceny, hubris, deceit and self-delusion of the heads of Google and Facebook\n\nI am confident that we can do this. Six years ago my friend Jon Taplin and I spoke at a conference at MIT. We caused a lot of trouble because of our assertion that musicians have the right to determine how and where their music is distributed. The Free Culture sect was in ascendance on campuses then, but things have changed.\n\nThe chronicle of reform movements demonstrates that history is made by abrupt transitions. The 1890s are remembered as the Gilded Age, where plutocrats like J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller asserted control over the U.S. economy and politics. By 1906, both Rockefeller and Morgan were being forced by antitrust regulators to break up their vast holdings. When I gave the keynote address at the Americana Music Festival addressing the problem of the tech monopolies in the fall of 2016, I thought we were in 1896, not 1906.\n\nBut today, just three years later, we are, in fact, at the beginning of a profound change in how we view tech monopolies. Since that time, the German led European Union has fined Google 7.7 billion dollars (American), the largest antitrust fines in history, for abusing its search monopoly, the British parliament has picked up the torch, and there is increasing evidence that American politicians and regulators are open to new regulation of these tech monopolies. Within the next six months the FCC will probably fine Facebook billions of dollars for the Cambridge Analytica breach. This is in part because the mounting evidence of the destructive role that both Facebook and Google played in the American election of 2016 proved to be one of the primary causes of Individual One’s so called victory.\n\nBut the crisis Facebook and Google have created goes way beyond the election. We have come to the realization that we have entrusted them with our most intimate data, and that they are not worthy of that trust. They have betrayed our trust by engineering their platforms to be addictive, and by making enormous fortunes selling — monetizing “in the parlance of our times,” to quote Maude Lebowski — surreptitiously selling those data that we have unknowingly handed over to them for free, for nothing.\n\nStewart Brand is often quoted as saying. “Information wants to be free.” The other half of the quotation, always omitted by the Free Culture sect is, “Information wants to be expensive, because it’s so valuable. The right information in the right place changes your life.”\n\nI have come here today to this right place to bring you a right piece of information.\n\nYour information is extremely valuable.\n\nTo realize that, all you have to do is look at the valuations of the companies that have been confiscating your information and making vast fortunes without compensation to you, the owners of that information, companies that have instead manipulated you and your friends and families by that information.\n\nIf we search the internet we find that Facebook is worth somewhere around $475 billion. Google is worth about $785 billion, give or take a few billion — together, about a trillion and a quarter dollars.\n\nThis — and much, much more — is what your collective information is worth. In fact, there is no way to put a monetary value on something such as privacy for which the intrinsic value is immeasurable.\n\nMark Zuckerberg tells us the age of privacy is over. At Harvard, he started what was then called Facemash as a place to rate girls by their pictures — which had been stolen from student housing directories — girls who were, I am certain, thrilled to be rated by the Ivy League incel community. Here is part of a text conversation between him and one of his friends outlining how he was planning to deal with his competition, the website Harvard Connect:\n\nFRIEND: so have you decided what you are going to do about the websites?\n\nZUCK: yea i’m going to fuck them\n\nZUCK: probably in the year\n\nZUCK: *ear\n\nZUCK: yea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvard\n\nZUCK: just ask\n\nZUCK: i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, sns\n\nFRIEND: what!? how’d you manage that one?\n\nZUCK: people just submitted it\n\nZUCK: i don’t know why\n\nZUCK: they “trust me”\n\nZUCK: dumb fucks\n\nHaving been exposed, he now claims to have grown and changed, but by now we have profound evidence that he has not, and in fact, his lust for power has made him worse, has made him into a James Bond villain.\n\nHe may be Zuckerberg, but make no mistake — you are the mark.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States asserts that the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. Well, unreasonable searches and seizures are Google and Facebook’s business models.\n\nThere are laws against phone tapping, yet on the internet, all communications are tapped, at all times, with impunity.\n\nThis has been an epic invasion of privacy.\n\nWhile he buys up all the houses around his house to protect his privacy, neither he nor any of the other one dimensional Randian intellectual lightweights in Silicon Valley gets to declare that the age of privacy is over.\n\nIt is time for him and them to get out of our lives, out of our private lives, out of our common life.\n\nTheirs is a fundamental miscalculation. They don’t know the difference between connection and disconnection. They don’t know the difference between information and disinformation. They don’t know the difference between creation and destruction.\n\nInformation does not want anything. We want information.\n\nBut as the tech companies have made vast fortunes selling our information, they have hidden from us the crucial information we need to survive as a species.\n\nThese technologists lack humanity.\n\nThis era — an era marked by a new field of economics called Surveillance Capitalism — has been a global revenge of the nerds.\n\nFor those to whom surveillance capitalism is a new term, here is Shoshana Zuboff’s definition of that term from her mighty book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism:\n\n1. A new economic order that claims human experience as free material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales;\n\n2. A parasitic economic logic in which the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new global architecture of behavioral modification;\n\n3. A rogue mutation of capitalism marked by concentrations of wealth, knowledge, and power unprecedented in human history;\n\n8. An extrapolation of critical human rights that is best understood as a coup from above: an overthrow of the people’s sovereignty.\n\nThe goal of technology is to create efficiency.\n\nThe goal of art is to create conscience.\n\nArt is not efficient.\n\nEfficiency is not an attribute of the good.\n\nEfficiency can be efficient for good or evil, but as it has worked out in practice, efficiency would seem to be a prime attribute of evil.\n\nWithout conscience, efficiency has the potential for apocalyptic evil.\n\nThese surveillance capitalists do not have the ethical foundation to be able to order society as they have presumed to do.\n\nThey lack conscience.\n\nI will stay with the artists. Artists contain the accumulated knowledge of generations. Artists create conscience. The artists are our only hope.\n\nThe sciences have failed us. The churches have failed us. The politicians have failed us.\n\nI am here today to strongly encourage all of you artists to not give in to the extreme intimidation of a sad group of very rich, emotionally and intellectually stunted people who threaten to destroy centuries of human experience and hard won knowledge, who threaten to destroy our race — the only race we have, the human race — but instead to stand up for yourselves, to stand up for humanity.\n\nAbraham Lincoln said, “America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.” Dr Martin Luther King, Jr said, “And one of the great liabilities of life is that all too many people find themselves living amid a great period of social change, and yet they fail to develop the new attitudes, the new mental responses, that the new situation demands. They end up sleeping through a revolution.” We must ask ourselves, are we sleeping through the Surveillance Capitalism Revolution?\n\nOur understanding of the Internet as a propaganda machine rather than simply a benign, ever-flowing source of information changed in 2016. Jacques Ellul defined propaganda this way, “an inner control over the individual by a social force, which means that it deprives him of himself.”\n\nPlease think of this talk as a prayer that we become reunited with our selves.\n\nAt about the same time as Bernays was fusing his uncle’s innovations with propaganda, the Russian psychologist, Ivan Pavlov, began researching the responses of dogs to being fed that led to our understanding of conditioned responses. If the dog would be fed accompanied by the ringing of a bell, soon the dog would begin to salivate merely at the ringing of a bell, if no food was present.\n\nWe are also susceptible to this sort of manipulation.\n\nOn social media, the like is the bell ringing.\n\nIn 1938, Orson Welles produced a radio play of the HG Wells novel, “War of the Worlds,” which led to a national panic that we were being invaded by aliens (from outer space), demonstrating the power of media to manipulate the mass unconscious, or to put it more clearly, to manipulate masses of people without their being conscious they were being manipulated. With the mechanized, automated electronic programming capabilities of today, we can see how easy it has become to fabricate — for millions of credulous people — an alien (not from outer space) invasion.\n\nRush Limbaugh’s rise paralleled that of Ronald Reagan. Fox News was launched in 1996 and was in enough markets by 2000 to help elect our boy, George Bush. But the hijacking of social media as a propaganda organ is distinctly different from partisan radio and television.\n\nOur smartphones are with us every waking hour, whereas television and radio are not regularly ingested in our workplaces. We check our phones 150 times per day and Facebook alone gets 54 minutes of our time per day.\n\nBut big changes will happen if we approach the problem of monopolization of the Internet with honesty, a sense of history, and a determination to protect what we all agree is important: our cultural inheritance. We all need the access to information the Internet provides, but we need to be able to share information about ourselves with our friends without unwittingly supporting a corporation’s profits.\n\nFacebook and Google must be willing to alter their business models to protect our privacy and help thousands of artists create a sustainable culture for the centuries, not just make a few software designers billionaires.\n\nIn the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA §512), the telecom giants, AT&T, Verizon, et al, negotiated a liability shield for copyright infringement called the Safe Harbor Provision, which stipulated that the digital platforms were not responsible for the material posted on their platforms. This was an unwise decision.\n\nAmong other serious problems, it allowed YouTube to become a massive infringement machine that made tens of billions of dollars for its owners while returning between nothing and a small fraction of that money, to the owners of the material posted on their platform. It also led to the posting of tens of thousands of Isis and Ku Klux Klan recruitment videos, as well as thriving pedophilia communities with untold thousands of photographs and videos of schoolchildren, among other horrors.\n\nThe Safe Harbor provision needs to be amended. Now.\n\nWithout the Safe Harbor provision, these Surveillance Capitalists would have to protect and defend their platforms, and in doing so, protect and defend us.\n\nIf artists do not want their work on YouTube or Facebook for free, they should be able to file a takedown notice, and then it would become the responsibility of the platform to block that content from ever being uploaded. All the tools needed to make this happen already exist.\n\nSecond, we need to reform our privacy regulations. The EU is taking the lead on this with their General Data Privacy Regulation act (GDPR) which went into effect in early 2018. The U.S. should follow the European leadership on this front.\n\nBut we also must understand that the people who run Google, Facebook, etc., are just at the beginning of a long project to change our world, so this battle has only just begun. Yuval Noah Harari, author of Sapiens, calls their project Dataism:\n\n“Dataists further believe that given enough biometric data and computing power, this all-encompassing system could understand humans much better than we understand ourselves. Once that happens, humans will lose their authority, and humanist practices such as democratic elections will become as obsolete as rain dances and flint knives.”\n\nWe need to confront this techno-determinism with real solutions, before it is too late. An autonomous technology has taken over the traditional values of all our cultures and rendered the differences among them superficial. This has led to disruptions and schisms in crucial parts of our lives- the arts, education, journalism, politics, and others, but most alarmingly, in our selves. Marshall McLuhan said that a medium surrounds a previous medium and turns the previous medium into an art form, as film did with novels, as television did with film, and as the internet has now done with television.\n\nThrough the technological advances of the last century, from radio to film to television and now to the world wide web, we have become deft at the treacherous processes of programming and conditioning.\n\nAs you know, programmers make programs, and what they do is called programming. Today, we have programs and programmers everywhere. Where we once had radio programmers and television programs, billions of people now are turning themselves into programmers, and- more significantly- into programs.\n\nAs one result of this programming pandemic, we are losing the ability to discern fact from fiction.\n\nAnother result is that large segments of our societies are subjects of mass hypnosis.\n\nI undertake the pursuit of the solutions to these problems with optimism, because I believe in the power of music, paintings, theater, books, and movies — the power of art — to change the world. As the writer Toni Morrison observed, “The history of art, whether it’s in music or written or what have you, has always been bloody, because dictators and people in office and people who want to control and deceive know exactly the people who will disturb their plans. And those people are artists. They’re the ones that sing the truth. And that is something that society has got to protect.” I know that brave and passionate art is worth protecting and is more than just click bait for global advertising monopolies. Art is not information. Art is above information. Art changes everything.\n\nThe last 10 years have seen the wholesale destruction of the creative economy — journalists, musicians, authors, and filmmakers — wrought by parasitic tech monopolies. The monopolies’ dominance in Artificial Intelligence will extend this creative destruction to much of the service economy, including transportation, medicine, and retail.\n\nThere is not a single politician in America talking about this and, when the flood of unemployment brought about by the Artificial Intelligence revolution is upon us, we will not be ready. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was recently quoted as saying that the robotics and AI revolution would not arrive for 100 years. He said, “I think that is so far in the future — in terms of Artificial Intelligence taking over American jobs—I think we’re, like, so far away from that that it is not even on my radar screen.”\n\nHis radar screen is blank. In actual fact, he has no radar screen. That is an imbecilic statement.\n\nMnuchin’s former employer, Goldman Sachs, recently reported that self-driving cars could eliminate 300,000 jobs per year starting in 2022. Both sides of this argument cannot be true, but we are forging ahead with a vision of an AI universe with almost no political debate. We know this is true because of the deafening silence from the politicians in the last ten years, as 50 percent of the jobs in journalism were eliminated and revenues at both music companies and newspapers fell by 70 percent. Who was there to speak for the creative workers of the world?\n\nThe companies that will win the AI race will be the companies that are already in the forefront: Google, Facebook and Amazon. As AI venture capitalist Kai-Fu Lee recently wrote, “AI is an industry in which strength begets strength: The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the more data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you can attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product.”\n\nThese companies are already pushing out of tech into other sectors of the economy, as Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods demonstrates. Google’s life sciences division, Verily, is producing glucose-monitoring contact lenses for diabetics, wrist computers that read diagnostic nanoparticles injected into the blood stream, implantable devices that modify electrical signals that pass along nerves, medication robots, human augmentation and human brain simulation devices. Google’s autonomous car division is already working with Avis to manage their forthcoming self-driving car fleet. As for Facebook’s brand extension plans into video, they recently bid $800 million for the worldwide rights to broadcast Indian Cricket on their platform, only to be outbid by Rupert Murdoch’s Star India. These are just the start of many initiatives to extend the tech giants’ technologies into many parts of the American economy.\n\nWe need a communications system that is not dependent on surveillance marketing and that allows creative artists to take advantage of the zero-marginal-cost economics of the Web. I have no illusion that the existing business structures of cultural marketing will change and/or go away, but we can build a parallel structure that will benefit all creators. The only way this will happen is if, in Peter Thiel’s “deadly race between politics and technology,” the people’s voice (politics) wins. The leaders of Google and Facebook may seem to some like benevolent plutocrats, but, in fact, they are malevolent and without ethics. On top of that, the time for plutocracy is over.\n\nNeil Postman wrote, “Those who cultivate competence in the use of a new technology become an elite group that are granted undeserved authority and prestige by those who have no such competence.”\n\nOrwell feared that the truth would be hidden from us.\n\nHuxley feared that the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance.\n\nThey were both right.\n\nWe cannot and will not allow the tyranny of the programs and programmers of these electronic philistines to destroy us.\n\nSo, understanding the lesson of the propagandists that people are driven to act not by information, but rather by emotion, I pray that this talk has touched your emotions. To that end, I will leave you with two short poems by Czeslaw Milosz, the first is “You Who Wronged.”\n\nYou who wronged a simple man\n\nBursting into laughter at the crime,\n\nAnd kept a pack of fools around you\n\nTo mix good and evil, to blur the line,\n\nThough everyone bowed down before you,\n\nSaying virtue and wisdom lit your way,\n\nStriking gold medals in your honor,\n\nGlad to have survived another day,\n\nDo not feel safe. The poet remembers.\n\nYou can kill one, but another is born.\n\nThe words are written down, the deed, the date.\n\nAnd you’d have done better with a winter dawn,\n\nA rope, and a branch bowed beneath your weight.\n\nNow, I’m going to reprogram you. Here is Milosz in a better mood in his poem, “Gift.”\n\nA day so happy.\n\nFog lifted early, I worked in the garden.\n\nHummingbirds were stopping over honeysuckle flowers.\n\nThere was no thing on earth I wanted to possess.\n\nI knew no one worth envying him.\n\nWhatever evil I had suffered, I forgot.\n\nTo think that once I was the same man did not embarrass me.\n\nIn my body I felt no pain.\n\nWhen straightening up, I saw the blue sea and sails.\n\nPoetry rings to the high heavens.\n\nWe cannot and will not trade art, privacy, and our souls for the banal trivialities that the surveillance capitalists offer us.\n\nIn 2012, when we first raised these issues at MIT, no one was listening. Now, people are paying attention. We are advancing to higher ground. But the journey is not finished. As Dr. King said, “I may not get there with you, but I believe in the promised land.”\n\nThe goal of art is to create conscience.\n\nYou are equal to the task.\n\nThank you, love to you, and may God bless and keep you always.\n\nThank you SXSW very much for allowing me the incredible opportunity of being this year's keynote speaker. Having been raised by a former DC political speechwriter and a former public speaking teacher, it is practically written in my DNA zipper that I should feel the insatiable need to stand in front of a room of total strangers and BULLSHIT them. As a child, MY father's lectures were legendary. And Frequent. Great works of literature, that stay with me to this day and, if anything . . . taught me how to give loooong lectures myself. Not long ago I was lucky enough to sit down at dinner with another one of my favorite public speakers . . . the one, the only Mr. Bruce Springsteen. Bruce, as you would imagine, is a warm, funny, brilliant man, and a wonderful dinner guest! I congratulated him on last year's amazing keynote, quoting his insight and humor. And then I told him that this year's keynote speaker was . . . me. He stared at me for a moment, slowly cracked that famous smile that we all know and love, that smile that could light up an entire stadium, and then . . . he started laughing. AT ME. As if to say \"GOOD FUCKING LUCK, BUDDY . . . \" But . . . truth be told . . . that's not the first time anyone's ever said that to me, so it is without a doubt my musical life's greatest honor to be asked to share with you what I know about music.\n\nSo. What do I know . . .\n\nThe Musician comes first.\n\nMy mother tells me that I was born to applause. The morning of January 14th, 1969, there was a class of young doctors in a small delivery room in Warren, Ohio, there to witness their first live birth. As I was born, the room burst into applause. My first moments in this world . . . hanging upside down, covered in blood, screaming as I'm being spanked by a complete stranger. Perhaps the most appropriate preparation for becoming a working musician.\n\nNow . . . before we go any further, I have to thank someone. I have to thank Edgar Winter. For allowing K-Tel records to include his legendary instrumental \"Frankenstein\" on their 1975 Blockbuster compilation. It was this record that my sister and I bought at the drugstore down the street and brought home to play on the public-school turntable my mother would borrow from school on the weekends. It was this record that changed my life. A veritable \"who's who\" of 1975 radio hits. But, it wasn't KC and the Sunshine Band's \"That's the way, uh huh uh huh I like it\" song that made me want to pick up the dusty old guitar in the corner. Nope . . . and it wasn't Dave Loggins' \"Please Come to Boston\" or Silver Convention's \"Fly Robin Fly\" that made me want to jump in a van with my friends and leave the world behind for music. No. It was (sings \"Frankenstein\"). A riff. I gave it all up for a riff.\n\nInterestingly enough, though, that song is completely instrumental. There's no vocal. It's drums, guitars, keyboards, percussion, each getting a solo in the song . . . no vocals. But what I heard in all of those solos . . . were voices. The voices of each musician. Their personalities. Their technique. Their feel. The sound of people playing music with other people. It made me want to play music with other people, too.\n\nSo, it wasn't long until I had my first guitar, an old Sears Silvertone with the amp built into the case. It smelled like an old attic full of mothballs and burning wire, and sounded like that \"goats yelling like humans\" YouTube clip that's going around right now (look it up, it's fucking hilarious), but it instantly became my obsession. It was this guitar, and a Beatles songbook that ultimately set my life in . . . ahem . . one direction. Never one for taking lessons or direction, I was left to my own devices and devoted every waking hour to playing music. It became my religion. The record store my church. The rock stars my saints, and their songs my hymns.\n\nSpringfield, Virginia, wasn't necessarily known for breeding rock stars. A \"career\" in music never seemed possible to me. It just seemed too good to be true. Surely the faces on my Kiss posters weren't getting PAID to do this! Gene Simmons? Imagine! But that never mattered to me. Because I had finally found MY VOICE. And that was all I needed to survive from now on. The reward of playing a song from beginning to end without making a mistake . . . well, that could feed me for weeks. The discovery of a new chord, or a new scale could make me forget about that kid at school who wanted to kick my fuckin' ass, or that cute chick with the lip gloss and soft sweater I had a crush on who wouldn't give me the time of day. I liked my new voice. Because, no matter how bad it sounded . . . it was mine. There was nobody there to tell me what was right or what was wrong, so . . . there was no right or wrong.\n\nAs much as I wanted to be in a band, I was there, alone in my bedroom, day in day out with my records and my guitar, playing with myself for hours. I would set up pillows in the formation of a drumset on my bed and play along to records until there was literally sweat dripping down the Rush posters on my walls. Eventually I figured out how to be a one-man band. I took my crappy old handheld tape recorder, hit record and laid down a guitar track. I would then take that cassette, place it in the home stereo, take another cassette, place THAT into the handheld recorder, hit play on the stereo, record on the handheld, and play drums along to the sound of my guitar. Voila! Multi-tracking! At 12 years old! To my chagrin, though, what I got was not \"Sgt. Peppers\" . . . rather a collection of songs about my dog, my bike, and my dad. Nevertheless, I had done this all myself. Therefore making the reward even sweeter.\n\nBut, still, I longed to share this newfound obsession with other people. Eventually, I found a kid up the street with an old drum set. I found a kid down the street with an old bass. I found a kid across the street with an old basement. And we found a kid across town with an old PA. Several awkward jam sessions later, and we had a band. Obstacle one, cleared. When asked what our band name was upon submitting our official entry to our high school battle of the bands, we applied as \"Nameless.\" We just couldn't fuckin' come up with anything better than that. (Finding a good band name is still the fucking hardest part, by the way . . . I mean, Foo Fighters? C'mon . . .) Obstacle two, diverted. That night Kenny Loggins' \"Footloose\" never sounded so brave . . . Unfortunately, our enthusiastic rendition wasn't enough to seize the title of \"Best Band at Thomas Jefferson High School,\" but . . . we carried on. We tried our damnedest at Bowie, Who, Zep, Cream, Kinks, Hendrix . . . we played basements, backyards, keg parties . . . we even played the Rolling Stones' \"Time Is on My Side\" at a fucking nursing home.\n\nAnd then . . . I went to Chicago.\n\nIt was 1982, and on my mother's meager public school teacher's salary, our family had planned a trip to the great city of Chicago to visit our relatives who lived in a suburb up north, right on the lake. We stuffed everything that we could into our tiny, baby-blue Ford Fiesta and started driving. A week and a half of swimming and Italian beef sandwiches was in order, though, upon arrival, the tone of our trip was instantly defined. My older cousin, Tracey, was now a punk rocker.\n\nAt first . . . I HEARD her coming down the stairs. The clanking of chains, the stomping of heavy boots, the sound of a fresh leather jacket creaking like an old ship. And then . . . I saw her. Shaved head, bondage pants, torn Anti-Pasti T-shirt . . . she was a fucking superhero come to life. Something I had only seen on the TV shows Chips or Quincy. My heart started racing. My eyes widened. My throat tightened. I stood there, speechless and in awe. Tracey was my first hero.\n\nShe took me up to her bedroom and showed me her incredible record collection. Stacks upon stacks of seven-inch singles and LP's, with names I'd never heard before . . . Names like: The Misfits. Bad Brains. Minor Threat. Dead Kennedys. The Germs. Flipper. The Circle Jerks. . Discharge. Crass. Conflict. Black Flag. White Flag. Void. Faith. The Dicks. The Dickies. The Minutemen. The Adolescents. The Ramones. The Big Boys GBH. DRI. SOA. DOA. MDC. MIA. CIA. Crucifix. Crucifucks. X. X-Ray Spex. Wire. Sex Pistols. The Buzzcocks. Rights of The Accused. The Necros. Fang. Government Issue. The Descendants. I sat down and played every last one. This was the first day of the rest of my life.\n\nThat night I went to my first \"concert.\" Though, it wasn't in an arena, it was a dingy little hole in the wall directly across the street from Wrigley Field called the Cubby Bear. And it wasn't any band I had ever heard of. It was a local Chicago punk rock band by the name of Naked Raygun. With a \"ONE TWO THREE FOUR\" the band kicked into the most ferocious noise and bodies were flying everywhere, spit and sweat and leather and volume and broken glass and piss and fucking puke . . . I was in heaven. And it was our secret.\n\nThe next day I took the L to Wax Trax records. I bought a Killing Joke T-shirt and the soundtrack to The Decline of Western Civilization. I was converted. I was no longer one of you. I was one of us.\n\nBut, more than the noise, and the rebellion, and the danger . . . it was the blissful removal of these bands from any source of conventional, popular corporate structure, and the underground network that supported the music's independence that was totally inspiring to me. At 13 years old, I realized that I could start my own band, I could write my own song, I could record my own record, I could start my own label, I could release my own record, I could book my own shows, I could write and publish my own fanzine, I could silkscreen my own T-shirts . . . I could do all of this myself. There was no right or wrong . . . because it was all mine.\n\nUpon returning to Washington, D.C., I dove headfirst into the local hardcore punk rock scene. Little did I know that one of the country's most prolific and influential music scenes was right in my own backyard. Minor Threat. Bad Brains. Scream. These local bands were now my Beatles. My Stones. My Zeppelin. My Dylan. And these were the fucking REAGAN YEARS, so protest music was on fire! My first punk rock show back at home was actually the ROCK AGAINST REAGAN concert, July 4th, 1983. With the stage built at the base of the Lincoln Memorial steps on Independence day, it was recipe for disaster. Seven-hundred thousand barefoot, sunburned rednecks from Maryland and Virginia in Lynyrd Skynyrd and Judas Priest T-shirts, stone washed jeans and bandanas, converging on the nation's capital to watch the fireworks, coolers full of beer and Southern Comfort . . . only to find Texas' own Dirty Rotten Imbeciles singing their song \"I Don't Need Society\":\n\nYour number's up, you have to go\n\nThe system says I told you so\n\nStocked in a train like a truckload of cattle\n\nSent off to slaughter in a useless battle\n\nThousands of us sent off to die\n\nNever really knowing why\n\nFuck the system, they can't have me\n\nI don't need society\n\nI don't need society\n\nIt was a fucking riot waiting to happen.\n\nI actually bought that record that day from the lead singer out of the back of his van. It was a 33-song seven-inch. Stuffed in a homemade sleeve. It is still to this day, one of my most prized possessions.\n\nWhen the sun had gone down and the legendary Dead Kennedys finally came onstage, lead singer Jello Biafra pointed and screamed at the Washington Monument, calling it \"The great Klansman in the sky, with it's two blinking red eyes . . . \" Well . . . that was it . . . the powder keg finally blew. Helicopters buzzed overhead, shining spotlights into the crowd as policeman on horses beat their way through the punks with their billy clubs. It was right out of Apocalypse Now. This was my Woodstock. This was my Altamont. This was rock & roll, no matter what T-shirt you wore or what haircut you had. This was fucking REAL. I burned inside. I was possessed and empowered and inspired and enraged and so in love with life and so in love with music that it had the power to incite a fucking riot, or an emotion, or to start a revolution, or just to save a young boy's life.\n\nSo I joined a band, dropped out of high school, and hit the road. I starved. My hands bled. If I slept, I slept on floors. I slept on stages. I slept on the fucking floors under the fucking stages. And I loved every minute of it. Because I was free. And I wanted to incite a riot, or an emotion, or a revolution, or to save someone's life by inspiring them to pick up an instrument just like I did as a kid. I wanted to be someone's Edgar Winter. I wanted to be someone's Naked Raygun. I wanted to be somene's Bad Brains or Beatles. Because THAT was the reward. THAT was the intention. We played THAT type of music, so we were left alone. There was no career opportunity. There was no hall of fame. There were no trophies. There was no A&R credit card buying Benihana dinners. Our reward was knowing that we had done all of this all on our own, and that it was real.\n\nBut . . . inevitably it wasn't long before I found myself stranded in Hollywood without a cent to my name and no way home, crashed out in a Laurel Canyon bungalow with a bunch of female mud wrestlers. Don't ask. That's a whole other fucking keynote address . . .\n\nAnd, that's when I heard the 5 words that changed my life forever:\n\n\"Have you heard of Nirvana?\"\n\nNirvana were one of \"us.\" Raised on Creedence, and Flipper, and Beatles, and Black Flag, they seemed to share the same ideals, the same intentions. But they had something more. They had songs. They had . . . Kurt. What they didn't have . . . was a drummer.\n\nSo, without hesitation, I packed all of my drums into one big, U-Haul cardboard box, grabbed my old army duffle bag, and flew up to Seattle.\n\nWe practiced in a barn. Every day. It was all that we had. There was no sun. There was no moon. There was just . . . the barn. And those songs. Kurt had, without a doubt, found HIS voice. Every practice would begin with an improvisational, free-form jam, which kind of served as an exercise in dynamic and musical collaboration/communication. We were speaking to each other without words. Verbal communication was never really Nirvana's forte, so we spoke to each other with our instruments. And the combination of our three \"voices\" resulted in a sound that eventually caught the ear of a major label record company. Or 10 major label record companies . . .\n\nSuddenly, we were thrown into a bidding war of A&R guys with fancy shoes from Fred Segal, and radio promo dudes with little one-hitters in their glove compartments, and closets full of complimentary box sets, and fucking BENIHANA EVERY FUCKING NIGHT. At one meeting, after playing a demo of our song \"In Bloom\" for Donny Eiener in his high rise office in NYC, Donny turned to Kurt and asked, \"So . . . what do you guys want?\" Kurt, slouched over in his chair, looked up to Donny sitting behind his massive oak desk and said, \"We want to be the biggest band in the world.\"\n\nI laughed. I thought he was fucking kidding. He wasn't.\n\nNow, you have to remember where music WAS at the time. Here are the Billboard year-end Top 10 songs of 1990:\n\n10. Jon Bon Jovi, \"Blaze of Glory\"\n\n9. Billy Idol, \"Cradle of Love\"\n\n8. En Vogue, \"Hold On\"\n\n7. Phil Collins, \"Another Day in Paradise\"\n\n6. Mariah Carey, \"Vision of Love\"\n\n5. Madonna, \"Vogue\"\n\n4. Bel Biv Devoe, \"Poison\"\n\n3. Sinead O'Connor, \"Nothing Compares 2 U\"\n\n2. Roxette, \"It Must Have Been Love\"\n\nAnd the Number One song of 1990 . . . Wilson fucking Phillips, \"Hold On\"\n\nHow Kurt could even THINK we'd make a ripple in this ridiculous mainstream world of polished pop music was beyond me. It was beyond everyone. It made absolutely no sense. It was simply unimaginable. It was the type of hopeless, shallow aspiration that we had been conditioned to reject, ultimately relieving us of any intention other than to just be ourselves. I mean, the very definition of the word \"Nirvana\" in the dictionary is \"A PLACE OR STATE CHARACTERIZED BY FREEDOM FROM OR OBLIVION TO PAIN, WORRY, AND THE EXTERNAL WORLD.\" We had ALWAYS been left to our own devices as musicians, day after day in our bedrooms as children, day after day in that old barn. What did WE need with THAT world?\n\nA few more A&R guys with fancy shoes, a few more box sets, a few more dinners at Benihana, and we signed a deal. Following in the footsteps of our great heroes Sonic Youth, we signed to the David Geffen Company, threw everything in the back of our old Chevy van and headed down . . . to SOUND CITY.\n\nSixteen days. Thirteen songs. We were used to recording 16 songs in ONE DAY. This was the big time. All of those cold, rainy days spent in that barn, chopping away at those songs, speaking to each other without words, finding our \"voice,\" it was all . . . for this.\n\nWhen we pulled into the parking lot of Sound City, I quickly realized that this was not the big, fancy, major label Hollywood recording studio I had imagined. Not at all. It was a shithole. It was a run-down, burned-out, dumpy old joint in a warehouse complex deep in the sunburnt San Fernando valley, miles away from any Fred Segal or Benihana. It was perfect. Famous for such legendary albums like Neil Young's After the Gold Rush, Fleetwood Mac's Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty's Damn the Torpedoes, Cheap Trick's Heaven Tonight and Rick Springfield's Working Class Dog, it was hallowed ground . . . but it looked like no one had cleaned up the place since fucking Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were runners there. Brown shag carpet ON THE WALLS. A couch that they had been RENTING for 10 fucking years. I thought . . . it looked like a Chi Chi's that had a fire.\n\nBut upon listening back to the first take of \"In Bloom,\" we instantly understood Sound City's legacy. That room, and that old Neve board captured something. Something we had never heard before. It didn't sound like our first record, Bleach. It didn't sound like the Peel Sessions we had recorded for the BBC, or the \"Sliver\" single, or any of the demos. Nope. It sounded like Nevermind. It was the sound of three people playing as if their life depended on it, like they had waited their whole lives for this moment to be captured on a reel of two-inch tape.\n\nAfter a week or so at SOUND CITY, for whatever reason, I started getting worried that no one from the label had come to check out what we were doing. I called my manager John Silva and asked \"Hey . . . should we be worried?\" His immediate response was \"FUCK NO! YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY! YOU DON'T WANT THOSE FUCKING PEOPLE DOWN THERE!\" As usual . . . He was right. And, they left us alone.\n\nJust as WE couldn't imagine making the slightest ripple in the mainstream, no one else really seemed to imagine that happening either. The initial pressing of Nevermind was around 35,000 copies. Enough, by their estimate, to last the label a few months. A pretty good indication of everyone's expectations. Well . . . those were gone within a few weeks. Within a month, the record went gold. By Christmas, the record went platinum. By the new year, we were selling 300,000 records a week. That ripple that seemed so unimaginable had become a tidal wave.\n\nI've never really figured out why that happened. Timing? Perhaps. Legions of disaffected American youth fed up with Wilson Phillips? Probably . . .\n\nBut, I like to think that what the world heard in Nirvana's music was the sound of three human beings, three distinct personalities, their inconsistencies and their imperfections proudly on display for everyone to hear. Three people that had been left to their own devices their entire lives to find THEIR voices. It was honest. It was pure. And It was real.\n\nUp until that point, no one had ever told me how to play, or what to play. And now, no one would ever again.\n\nThe follow up to Nevermind, In Utero was a brazen example of this. Twelve songs recorded virtually live in only a few days by infamous record producer and opinionated pundit on the music industry, Steve Albini. It truly was the sound of a band IN A PLACE OR STATE CHARACTERIZED BY FREEDOM FROM OR OBLIVION TO PAIN, WORRY, AND THE EXTERNAL WORLD. Now it was US that had the power. We weren't Nirvana anymore, we were NIRVANA. Now you HAD to fucking leave us alone. The latch key children that unexpectedly inherited the castle? Maybe. More like Lord of the Flies with distorted guitars . . .\n\nBut, where do you go from there? As an artist raised in the ethically suffocating punk rock underground, conditioned to reject conformity, to resist all corporate influence and expectation, where do you go? How do you deal with that kind of success? How do you now DEFINE success? Is it still the reward of playing a song from beginning to end without making a mistake? Is it still finding that new chord, or scale that makes you forget all your troubles? How do you process going from being one of \"us\", to one of \"them\"?\n\nGuilt. Guilt is cancer. It will confine you, torture you, destroy you as a musician. It is a wall. It is a black hole. It is a thief. It will keep you from YOU. Remember learning your first song, or riff, or writing your first lyric? There was no guilt then. Remember when there WAS no right or wrong? Remember the simple reward of just . . . playing music? You are still, and will always be that person at your core. The musician. And, The musician comes first.\n\nFuck guilty pleasure. How about . . . just pleasure? I can truthfully say, out loud, that \"Gangnam Style\" is one of my favorite fucking songs of the past decade. It is! Is it any better or worse than the latest Atoms for Peace album? Hmmmm . . . If only we had a celebrity panel of judges to determine that for us! What would J-Lo do? Paging Pitchfork, come in, come in!!! Pitchfork, we need you to help us determine the value of a song!!! Who fucking cares!!!! I fucking LOVE IT!!! Who is to say what's a good voice and what's not a good voice. The Voice? Imagine Bob Dylan standing there singing \"Blowin in the Wind\" in front of Christina Aguilera. \"Mmmmm . . . I think you sound a little nasally and sharp. Next . . .\"\n\nIt's YOUR VOICE. Cherish it. Respect it. Nurture it. Challenge it. Stretch it and scream until it's fucking gone. Because everyone is blessed with at least that, and who knows how long it will last . . .\n\nWhen Kurt died, I was lost. I was numb. The music that I had devoted my life to had now betrayed me and broken my heart. I had . . . no voice. I turned off the radio, I put away my records, and packed up my drums. I couldn't bear to hear someone elses voice singing about pain, or joy, or love, or hate. Not one note. It just hurt much too much.\n\nBut eventually . . . that feeling that I had Independence Day, July 4th, 1983, at the base of the Lincoln memorial steps, that feeling came back to me. The same feeling that made me feel possessed and empowered and inspired and enraged, and so in love with life, and so in love with music that it had the power to incite a riot, or an emotion, or start a revolution, or just to save a young boy's life. I felt it again.\n\nI found a studio down the street. I booked six days. Loaded all of my gear into the car, bought some good, strong fucking coffee, and got back to work. Fourteen songs in five days, with one day to mix. I played every instrument, running from the drums, to the guitar, to the coffee maker, to the bass, to the vocal mike, to the coffee maker, back to the drums, back to the coffee maker . . . here I was again, left to my own devices, with no one to tell me right or wrong, the same one-man band 20 years later, multi-tracking all on my own. Though, long gone were the two-cassette recorders and songs about my dog, my bike, and my dad . . . I was singing songs about starting over. And, maybe a few about my dad ...\n\nI dubbed 100 cassettes. Gave it the name \"Foo Fighters\" so that people would imagine that it was a GROUP, rather than just one strung-out coffee junkie scrambling from instrument to instrument. I gave them to friends. I gave them to relatives. I gave them to people at gas stations. I was . . . starting over.\n\nIt wasn't long before I got the call. An A&R guy. The tape was getting around. Those six days that I spent alone in the studio that I considered to be a demo, I considered it an experiment, I CONSIDERED IT TO BE FUCKING THERAPY, FOR CHRISTSAKES! They thought it was a record! I didn't even have a band! I called my brilliant friend and lawyer, Jill Berliner, for advice. Know what she told me? The musician comes first.\n\nI started my own label, Roswell records. Yes, that's right, ladies and gentlemen, you are staring at the president of a record company.\n\nAfter all that had happened, deep down I was still the same kid that, at 13 years old, realized I could start my own band, I could write my own song, I could record my own record, I could start my own label, I could release my own record, I could book my own shows, I could write and publish my own fanzine, I could silkscreen my own T-shirts . . . I could do all of this myself. It may have been an entirely different world now, but once again, there was no right or wrong . . . because it was all mine.\n\nFrom day one the Foo Fighters have been fortunate enough to exist within this perfect world. WE write our songs. WE record our songs. WE make our albums. WE decide when the album is the album. WE OWN the album, and we'll license it to you for a little while, but you gotta give it back. Because it's MINE.\n\nBecause I am the musician. And I COME FIRST.\n\nI have to imagine that the reason I am here today in front of you all is exactly this. Am I the best drummer in the world? Certainly not. Am I the best singer-songwriter? Not even in THIS fucking ROOM! But I have been left alone to find MY VOICE since that day that I heard Edgar Winter's \"Frankenstein\" on that public school turntable in my bedroom.\n\nRecently, I directed a full-length feature documentary about the recording studio that Nirvana recorded Nevermind in over 20 years ago: Sound City. In the movie, we not only tell the story of this magical shithole, but we also explore technology and what we refer to as the \"human element\" of music. How do these things coexist?\n\nThere is no right or wrong. There is only, YOUR VOICE. Your voice screaming through an old Neve 8028 recording console, your voice singing from a laptop, your voice echoing from a street corner, a cello, a turntable, a guitar, serrato, a studer, It doesn't matter. What matters most is that it's YOUR VOICE. Cherish it. Respect it. Nurture it. Challenge it. Stretch it and scream until it's fucking gone. Because every human being is blessed with at least that, and who knows how long it will last . . .\n\nIt's there, if you want it. Now, more than ever, independence as a musician has been blessed by the advance of technology, making it easier for any inspired young musician to start their own band, write their own song, record their own record, book their own shows, write and publish their own fanzine (although now I believe you call it a \"blog\"?) . . . now more than ever, YOU can do this, it can be all yours. And left to your own devices, you can find YOUR VOICE.\n\nRecently, I came home with the new Beatles vinyl box set. It's amazing. It's the size of a fucking Tumi suitcase, it weighs 50 pounds. As I walked into the house, my daughters Harper who's three, and Violet who's six, looked up and gasped, \"WHAT IS THAT????\" I said, \"It's all of the Beatles' RECORDS!!!\" Now, I have already spent hours brainwashing them with Beatles songs . . . they're cool. But this was vinyl! They had never seen that before. I set up the turntable in their room, opened the box, and started showing them how it's done. \"Ok . . . you take the record out of the sleeve, here are the songs on this side, here are the songs on the other side . . . carefully place it on the turn table . . . gently put the needle down . . . CAREFUL!\" They were absolutely BLOWN AWAY. I left the room, came back half an hour later, and there they were, dancing to \"Get Back,\" album covers strewn all over the floor . . . sound familiar? We have all been there.\n\nAnd, as a proud father, I pray that someday that they are left to their own devices, that they realize that the musician comes first, and that THEY find THEIR VOICE, and that THEY become someone's Edgar Winter, THEY become someone's Beatles, and that THEY incite a riot, or an emotion, or start a revolution, or save someone's life.\n\nThat THEY become someone's hero.\n\nBut then again . . . what do I know?\n\n15 March 2012, South by Southwest festival, Austin, Texas. USA\n\nGood morning! Why are we up so fucking early? How important can this speech be if we're giving it at noon? It can't be that important. Every decent musician in town is asleep, or they will be before I'm done with this thing, I guarantee you. I've got a bit of a mess up here.\n\nWhen I was invited to do the keynote speech of this year's conference I was a little hesitant because the word keynote made me uncomfortable. It seemed to suggest that there was a key note to be struck that sums up whatever is going on out there in the streets.\n\nFive days of bands, hundreds of venues from morning till night, and no one really hardly agrees on anything in pop anymore. There is no key note, I don't think. There is no unified theory of everything. You can ask Einstein. But you can pick any band, say KISS, and you can go, \"Early Theatre Rock proponents, expressing the true raging hormones of youth\" or \"They suck!\"\n\nYou can go, Phish, \"Inheritors of the Grateful Dead's mantle, brilliant center of the true Alternative community,\" or \"They suck.\" You go, \"Bruce Springsteen, natural–born poetic genius off the streets of Monmouth County, hardest – hardest working – hardest working New Jerseyian in show business, voice of the common man, future of Rock and Roll!\", or \"He sucks. Get the fuck out of here!\"\n\nYou could pick any band, and create your own equation. It's fun. There was even a recent book that focused on the Beatles and decided, you got it, they sucked. So really, instead of a keynote speech, I thought that perhaps this should be a key notes speech, or perhaps many keynote speakers. I exaggerate for effect, but only a little bit. So with that as my disclaimer, I move cautiously on.\n\nStill, it's great to be in a town with ten thousand bands, or whatever . . . anybody know the actual number? Come on, a lot of them, right? Back in late '64 when I picked a guitar that would have seemed like some insane, teenage pipe dream, because first of all, it would have been numerically impossible. There just weren't that many guitars to go around in those days. They simply hadn't made that many yet. We would have all have to have been sharing.\n\nGuitar players were rare. Mostly, music schooled bands were rare, and, until the Beatles hit, played primarily instrumental music. And there wasn't that much music to play. When I picked up the guitar, there was only ten years of Rock history to draw on. That would be, like, all of known Pop being only the music that you know that's occurred between 2002 and now.\n\nThe most groups in one place I had ever seen as a teenager was twenty bands at the Keyport Matawan Roller Dome in a battle to the death. So many styles were overlapping at that point in time that you would have a doo wop singing group with full pompadours and matching suits set up next to our band playing a garage version of Them's \"Mystic Eyes,\" set up next to a full thirteen–piece soul show band. And still that's nothing minutely compared to what's going on, on the streets of Austin right now.\n\nSo, it's incredible to be back. I've had a lot of fun here in Austin since the '70s, and Jim Franklin and the Armadillo World Headquarters. It's fascinating to see what's become of the music that I've loved my whole life. Pop's become a new language, cultural force, social movement. Actually, a series of new languages, cultural forces, and social movements that have inspired and enlivened the second half of the twentieth century, and the dawning years of this one. I mean, who would have thought that there would have been a sax–playing president, or a soul–singing president, you know?\n\nWhen we started, thirty years old for a rock musician was unthinkable. Bill Haley kept his age a relative secret. So when Danny and the Juniors sang \"Rock and Roll is Here to Stay,\" they didn't have a clue as to how terrifyingly, fucking right they were going to be. When I look out from my stage these days, I look into the eyes of three generations of people, and still popular music continues to provide its primary function as youth music, as a joyous argument–starter, and as a subject for long booze–filled nights of debate with Steve Van Zandt, over who reigns ultimately supreme.\n\nThere are so many sub–genres and fashions, two–tone, acid rock, alternative dance, alternative metal, alternative rock, art punk, art rock, avant garde metal, black metal, black and death metal, Christian metal, heavy metal, funk metal, bland metal, medieval metal, indie metal, melodic death metal, melodic black metal, metal core, hard core, electronic hard core, folk punk, folk rock, pop punk, Brit pop, grunge, sad core, surf music, psychedelic rock, punk rock, hip hop, rap rock, rap metal, Nintendo core, huh?\n\nI just want to know what a Nintendo core is, myself. But rock noir, shock rock, skate punk, noise core, noise pop, noise rock, pagan rock, paisley underground, indy pop, indy rock, heartland rock, roots rock, samba rock, screamo–emo, shoegazing stoner rock, swamp pop, synth pop, rock against communism, garage rock, blues rock, death and roll, lo–fi, jangle pop, folk music. Just add neo– and post– to everything I said, and mention them all again. Yeah, and rock & roll.\n\nSo, holy shit, this is all going on in this town right now. For a guy who realizes U2 is probably the last band he is going to know the names of all four members of, it's overwhelming. Perhaps the most prophetic comment I've heard over the past quarter century about rock music was made by Lester Bangs upon Elvis' death. In 1977, Lester Bangs said Elvis was probably the last thing we were all going to agree on – Public Enemy not counting.\n\nFrom here on in, you would have your heroes and I would have mine. The center of your world may be Iggy Pop, or Joni Mitchell, or maybe Dylan. Mine might be KISS, or Pearl Jam, but we would never see eye–to–eye again, and be brought together by one music again. And his final quote in the article was, \"So, instead of saying goodbye to Elvis, I'm gonna say goodbye to you.\"\n\nWhile that's been proven a thousand times over, still here we are in a town with thousands of bands, each with a style, and a philosophy, and a song of their own. And I think the best of them believe that they have the power to turn Lester's prophecy inside out, and to beat his odds.\n\nSo as the records that my music was initially released on give way to a cloud of ones and zeroes, and as I carry my entire record collection since I was thirteen in my breast pocket, I'd like to talk about the one thing that's been consistent over the years, the genesis and power of creativity, the power of the songwriter, or let's say, composer, or just creator. So whether you're making dance music, Americana, rap music, electronica, it's all about how you are putting what you do together. The elements you're using don't matter. Purity of human expression and experience is not confined to guitars, to tubes, to turntables, to microchips. There is no right way, no pure way, of doing it. There's just doing it.\n\nWe live in a post–authentic world. And today authenticity is a house of mirrors. It's all just what you're bringing when the lights go down. It's your teachers, your influences, your personal history; and at the end of the day, it's the power and purpose of your music that still matters.\n\nSo I'm gonna talk, a little bit today, about how I've put what I've done together, in the hopes that someone slugging away in one of the clubs tonight may find some small piece of it valuable. And this being Woody Guthrie's hundredth birthday, and the centerpiece of this year's South–by–Southwest Conference, I'm also gonna talk a little about my musical development, and where it intersected with Woody's, and why.\n\nIn the beginning, every musician has their genesis moment. For you, it might have been the Sex Pistols, or Madonna, or Public Enemy. It's whatever initially inspires you to action. Mine was 1956, Elvis on the Ed Sullivan Show. It was the evening I realized a white man could make magic, that you did not have to be constrained by your upbringing, by the way you looked, or by the social context that oppressed you. You could call upon your own powers of imagination, and you could create a transformative self.\n\nA certain type of transformative self, that perhaps at any other moment in American History, might have seemed difficult, if not impossible. And I always tell my kids that they were lucky to be born in the age of reproducible technology, otherwise they'd be traveling in the back of a wagon and I'd be wearing a jester's hat. It's all about timing. The advent of television and its dissemination of visual information changed the world in the fifties the way the internet has over the past twenty years.\n\nRemember, it wasn't just the way Elvis looked, it was the way he moved that made people crazy, pissed off, driven to screaming ecstasy, and profane revulsion. That was television. When they made an attempt to censor him from the waist down, it was because of what you could see happening in his pants. Elvis was the first modern Twentieth Century man, the precursor of the Sexual Revolution, of the Civil Rights Revolution, drawn from the same Memphis as Martin Luther King, creating fundamental, outsider art that would be embraced by a mainstream popular culture.\n\nTelevision and Elvis gave us full access to a new language, a new form of communication, a new way of being, a new way of looking, a new way of thinking; about sex, about race, about identity, about life; a new way of being an American, a human being; and a new way of hearing music. Once Elvis came across the airwaves, once he was heard and seen in action, you could not put the genie back in the bottle. After that moment, there was yesterday, and there was today, and there was a red hot, rockabilly forging of a new tomorrow, before your very eyes.\n\nSo, one week later, inspired by the passion in Elvis' pants, my little six–year–old fingers wrapped themselves around a guitar neck for the first time, rented from Mike Deal's Music in Freehold, New Jersey. They just wouldn't fit. Failure with a capital F. So I just beat on it, and beat on it, and beat on it – in front of the mirror, of course. I still do that. Don't you? Come on, you gotta check your moves. All right?\n\nBut even before there was Elvis, my world had begun to be shaped by the little radio with the six–inch mono speaker that sat on top of our refrigerator. My mother loved music, and she rahised us on pop music radio. So between 8:00 and 8:30 every morning, as I snowed sugar onto my Sugar Pops, the sounds of early pop and doo wop whispered into my young and impressionable ears. Doo wop, the most sensual music ever made, the sound of raw sex, of silk stockings rustling on backseat upholstery, the sound of the snaps of bras popping across the USA, of wonderful lies being whispered into Tabu–perfumed ears, the sound of smeared lipstick, untucked shirts, running mascara, tears on your pillow, secrets whispered in the still of the night, the high school bleachers, and the dark at the YMCA canteen. The soundtrack for your incredibly, wonderful limp–your–ass, blue–balled walk back home after the dance. Oh! And it hurt so good.\n\nIn the late fifties and early sixties doo wop dripped from radios in the gas stations, factories, streets, and pool halls – the temples of life and mystery in my little hometown. And I would always be enraptured by its basic chord progression. Isn't there supposed to be a guitar around here somewhere? Anybody got one?\n\n(strumming guitar and singing opening lines of song, \"Backstreets\") One soft infested summer, me and Terry became friends...\n\nIt all comes from the same place. Well anyway, then into my thirteen–year–old ears came 60's pop. Roy Orbison, besides Johnny Cash, he was the other Man in Black. He was the true master of the romantic apocalypse you dreaded, and knew was coming after the first night you whispered, I love you, to your new girlfriend. You were going down. Roy was the coolest, uncool loser you'd ever seen. With his Coke bottle black glasses, his three–octave range, he seemed to take joy sticking his knife deep into the hot belly of your teenage insecurities.\n\nSimply the titles, \"Crying,\" \"It's Over,\" \"Running Scared.\" That's right, the paranoia, oh, the paranoia. He sang about the tragic unknowability of women. He was tortured by soft skin, angora sweaters, beauty, and death – just like you. But he also sang that he'd been risen to the heights of near unexpressable bliss by these same very things that tortured him. Oh, cruel irony.\n\nAnd for those few moments, he told you that the wreckage, and the ruin, and the heartbreak was all worth it. I got it, my young songwriters, wisdom said to me: Life is tragedy, broken by moments of unworldly bliss that make that tragedy bearable. I was half right. That wasn't life, that was pop music.\n\nBut at twenty–four, who knew the difference? So I was on my way. Then Spector and the Wall of Sound. Phil's entire body of work could be described by the title of one of his lesser–known productions, \"He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss).\" Phil's records felt like near chaos, violence covered in sugar and candy, sung by the girls who were sending Roy–o running straight for the anti–depressants. If Roy was opera, Phil was symphonies, little three–minute orgasms, followed by oblivion.\n\nAnd Phil's greatest lesson was sound. Sound is its own language. I mean, the first thing you would think of with Phil Spector is (soundbite of mimicking a drum beat). That was all you needed. And then, the British Invasion. My first real guitar, I actually began to learn how to play, and this was different, shifted the lay of the land. Four guys, playing and singing, writing their own material. There was no longer gonna be a music producer apart from the singer, a singer who didn't write, a writer who didn't sing. It changed the way things were done. The Beatles were cool. They were classical, formal, and created the idea of an independent unit where everything could come out of your garage. The \"Meet the Beatles\" album cover, those four head shots. I remember, I seen 'em at J. J. Newberry's. It was the first thing I saw when you ran down to the five–and–ten cent store. There were no record stores. There weren't enough records, I don't think, in those days. There was a little set by the toys where they sold a few albums.\n\nAnd I remember running in and seeing that album cover with those four headshots. It was like the silent gods of Olympus. Your future was just sort of staring you in the face. I remember thinking, \"That's too cool. I'm never gonna get there, man, never.\" And then in some fanzine I came across a picture of the Beatles in Hamburg. And they had on the leather jackets and the slick–backed pompadours, they had acned faces. I said, hey, \"Wait a minute, those are the guys I grew up with, only they were Liverpool wharf rats.\"\n\nSo minus their Nehru jackets and the haircuts – so these guys, they're kids. They're a lot cooler than me, but they're still kids. There must be a way to get there from here. Then for me, it was The Animals. For some, they were just another one the really good beat groups that came of the 60s. But to me, The Animals were a revelation. The first records with full blown class consciousness that I had ever heard. \"We Gotta Get Out Of This Place\" had that great bass riff, that (playing bass line of \"We Gotta Get Out Of This Place) and that was just marking time.\n\n(Singing and strumming \"We Gotta Get Out Of This Place\"):\n\nIn this dirty old part of the city, where the sun refused to shine.\n\nPeople tell me there ain't no sense in trying.\n\nMy little girl, you're so young and pretty.\n\nOne thing I know is true,\n\nYou'll be dead before your time is due, this I know.\n\nSee my Daddy in bed and dying.\n\nSee his hair turning grey.\n\nHe's been working and slaving his life away, yes, I know.\n\nIt's been work – every day\n\nJust work – every day\n\nIt's been work, work, work, work.\n\nWe gotta get out of this place\n\nIf it's the last thing we ever do\n\nWe gotta get out of this place\n\nGirl, there's a better life for me and you.\n\nYes, I know it's true.\n\nThat's every song I've ever written. Yeah. That's all of them. I'm not kidding, either. That's \"Born to Run,\" \"Born in the USA,\" everything I've done for the past 40 years, including all the new ones. But that struck me so deep. It was the first time I felt I heard something come across the radio that mirrored my home life, my childhood. And the other thing that was great about The Animals was there were no good–looking members. There were none. They were considered to be one of the ugliest groups in all of rock and roll.\n\nAnd that was good. That was good for me, because I considered myself hideous at the time. And they weren't nice, you know. They didn't curry favor, you know. They were like aggression personified. It's my life, I'll do what I want. They were cruel. They were cruel, which was so freeing. It was so freeing. When you saw Eric Burdon, he was like your shrunken daddy with a wig on. He never, he never had a kid's face. He always had a little man's face, you know.\n\nAnd he couldn't dance. And they put him in suit, but it was like putting a gorilla in a suit. You could tell he was like, \"Fuck that shit, man.\" He didn't want it. And then he had that voice that was, like, I don't know, the Howlin' Wolf, or something – coming out of some seventeen or eighteen–year–old kid. I don't know how it happened. I found their cruelty so freeing. What was that great verse in \"It's My Life?\" It's a hard world to get a break in, all the good things have been taken. And then, \"Though dressed in these rags I'll wear sable someday, hear what I say. I'm gonna ride the serpent. No more time spent sweating rent.\" Then that beautiful, \"It's my life. Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime. Hurt me sometime. But someday I'll treat you real fine. I love that.\n\nAnd then they had the name. The name was very different from the Beatles, or Herman's Hermits, or Freddie and the Dreamers. The name was unforgiving, and final, and irrevocable. I mean, it was in your face. It was the most unapologetic group name until the Sex Pistols came along.\n\n\"Badlands,\" \"Prove It All Night,\" Darkness On The Edge of Town was filled with, with The Animals. Youngsters, watch this one. I'm gonna tell you how it's done, right now. I took \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,\"\n\n(Singing and strumming beginning of \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\":\n\nDanta, danta, danta, dah.\n\nDah, dah, dah, dah, dah.\n\nDanta, danta, danta, dah\n\nDah, dah, dah, dah, dah.\n\n(Singing melody of \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\" while strumming chords of \"Badlands\":\n\nDah, dah, danta, tadah.\n\nDah, dah, dah, dah, dah"
