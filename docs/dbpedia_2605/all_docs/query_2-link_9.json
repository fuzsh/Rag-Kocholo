        "text": "Bored with ordinary commercial studios, The Cure decided to cut loose for their latest album, and set up their own recording facility in a Tudor house in the country. Nigel Humberstone visited the band on location to discuss the technology that made the move into the country possible, and the group's working methods.\n\nThe Cure are the great survivors of the punk era. They have been together — albeit with an ever‑changing line‑up — for nearly 20 years, during which time their mix of gothic, independent, and quirky pop styles has allowed them to transcend the vagaries of fashion and enjoy enormous, and continuous commercial success.\n\nBut with success comes routine, and after so long in the music business, the album/tour/album/tour treadmill can prove stifling to creativity. One of the many ways musicians can escape this trap, finances permitting, is to invest in an affordable, high‑quality and portable studio system, and move from location to location recording on the same setup wherever they go. U2's enormously successful experiments with portable studio facilities, which resulted in the albums The Unforgettable Fire, Achtung Baby and Zooropa, are well documented (see Paul Tingen's piece on the subject in SOS March '94, for example). When The Cure decided the time had come to record the follow‑up to their 1992 Wish album, they opted for a similar approach, and retreated for 16 months to St Catherine's Court, a secluded Tudor house in Bath, where they recorded and mixed what has become their new album, Wild Mood Swings.\n\nBreaking The Routine\n\nAfter a few years with a seemingly ever‑changing list of members, The Cure sported a new line‑up for the making of this album: Robert Smith (guitar, vocals), Simon Gallup (bass), Perry Bamonte (guitar and some keyboards), and Jason Cooper (drums), with Roger O'Donnell returning to carry out main keyboard duties after a five‑year absence from the group. It was Roger who acted as my host for a short guided tour of St Catherine's when I arrived there to meet the band and their producer/engineer Steve Lyon. As Roger explained, the beauty of the setting had proved to be both a help and a hindrance to the recording:\n\n\"It's been so relaxed here. There wasn't a deadline, so we kept pushing it back. It's comfortable and big enough that you can get away from everybody else — so everyone's not on top of each other.\"\n\nIn keeping with the fresh approach to the project, reflected in the choice of recording location, various long‑standing conventions in the Cure's working methods were broken or altered for the making of this album. The working title, Bare, was ditched when it became obvious to Robert Smith that it wouldn't be appropriate for the album's vibe; instead, he substituted Wild Mood Swings, originally the title of a solo album he started writing 10 years ago. The band also chose to work for the first time with producer/engineer Steve Lyon, best known for his work with Depeche Mode. Smith clarified the group's reasons for the new choice:\n\n\"I thought that it was time to have a change from working with Dave Allen [the group's previous producer/engineer] — I was worried that nothing new was going to happen. We've never really needed anyone to help on the creative or artistic side, but I thought it would be best to get someone in who was younger and didn't have any preconceptions about the group.\"\n\nSteve's approach was to be ready for anything, as he explained: \"I've tried to keep things as open as possible. If, at any time, there's been the opportunity to capture something, I've made provisions so we could do it. Even during rehearsals for the band's festival tour last year, I arranged to record the rehearsal. The four ADATs we've been using have been very useful for that, as they have for putting drum takes together and changing arrangements in songs where lyrics have been added. There have been four or five different versions of some songs, where edits have been tried and sections have been moved around, by sampling from ADAT into our Akais.\"\n\nVocal Inspiration\n\nSuch rearrangement was necessary because Robert Smith's distinctive vocal and lyrical ideas don't usually emerge until late in the songwriting process. Smith explains that after song demos are completed, the most he'll usually come up with is a working title, which is sometimes retained all the way through to the finished track. As Roger O'Donnell puts it: \"you come to know your songs as instrumentals. Then, overnight, they're changed when Robert sings on them.\"\n\nSteve Lyon described the process of recording Robert's vocals: \"Robert would live with a vocal for three or four weeks, then come back and sing through it, and it would become obvious which parts needed backing vocals or not. Then, within 20 to 30 minutes, you'd have the multitracked backing parts — because he knows his own voice so well.\"\n\nIt was at this point that the songs occasionally needed to be rearranged (Smith: \"Sometimes, I'll nick one of the tunes played by an instrument as a melody, so that instrument will have to be scrapped\") — though this was avoided where possible.\n\nDespite the restful surroundings and propitious atmosphere, most of Smith's vocals were recorded elsewhere. \"Somehow, I didn't feel comfortable singing them here. It's different working in an environment that isn't a studio. And because we've actually lived here, and the music room hasn't been just for recording, it's been a social focal point — it's meant that that line has been blurred between making the album and living. Nothing we've done before has been like this. If you're in a studio environment — apart from the fact that you're paying £1,000 plus a day — you know that when you're gone, somebody else is arriving, and you're just part of the treadmill process of making another album. Here, it's never been done before, and there's a different feeling.\"\n\nStrings And Things\n\nAnother notable development for the new album was the use of real strings and brass instruments, with the strings (a quartet) most prominent and effective on the track 'This Is A Lie'. The idea to use strings was formed at an early stage (see the 'Demo‑ology' box for more on The Cure's demoing process). \"That track was originally an acoustic guitar part done by Perry,\" recounts Smith, \"and when I started playing around with it, it evolved into a string piece on the keyboard. I always had in mind that we'd be using strings, right from the very outset. In that way, the house helped — there was an instant atmosphere for any string quartet walking into that room.\"\n\nAudrey Riley's string quartet was chosen for the work: a wise choice, considering Smith's general disdain for classical musicians.\n\n\"I'd looked through a lot of CDs with strings that I thought sounded good; contemporary stuff, because I didn't fancy working with strictly classical musicians. Initially, Audrey Riley wasn't available, so we got another quartet to come down, but the problem with classical musicians is that they can't play in strict time. Well, they can, but they don't, because they feel it's demeaning. Their tuning was awful as well!\n\n\"Audrey, on the other hand, was very aware of recording for contemporary pop, as you might call it. She's very honest about it, and if they are playing something wrong, then she's not afraid to say so. With the other lot, I had to go in myself and say 'Look, can't you hear that you're playing out of tune?'\"\n\nWild Mood Swings also saw the band making greater use of computers than previously. Having been away from the group for five years, Roger O'Donnell was particularly well‑placed to notice this change: \"When I left the group in 1990, there wasn't a computer in sight. I came back, and there's computers everywhere. We've really started using sequencing — all the keyboard parts have gone through it [Cubase Score for Macintosh]. The use of a string quartet and brass section is a strange contrast!\"\n\nStrange, perhaps, but Cubase Score proved a considerable help when it came to communicating with the classical players. Smith: \"It's been good using the Score package, because anything I play in can actually come out as musical score. Audrey would then hand‑write it for the players, but it's really excellent, because you can instantaneously change pieces. Before, it was like trying to put your ideas over in another language.\"\n\nMixing\n\nOf the 14 songs on the album, five were mixed at St Catherine's Court by Smith and Lyon, while eight different people (including Adrian Moulder, Flood and Spike Drake) undertook the remainder. A Neve VRP Flying Fader Console was astutely purchased by Smith for the two‑month mixing session, as he gleefully explains: \"I bought and sold it in the same week! I even made a profit.\" Perhaps the swift resale was a good idea, as the Neve turned out not to be his cup of tea at all: \"The Neve is an engineer's desk. The computer inside it is so archaic — even though Steve will tell you the opposite, and say it's very obvious. I suppose it's because I've worked with SSLs so much that I take the command functions for granted. It's about artist involvement, really — Steve had wanted to work with a Euphonix desk, and I wouldn't, because that has assignable channels, which keeps the artist at bay even more. With the Neve, you might touch a fader and go 'Oh no! The yellow light went on instead of the red!' I just want to be able to maybe push the bass up in level, without having to go back two mixes, or whatever. That is really frustrating — that's why, even though the Amek's got automation, we never turned it on.\"\n\nSmith always gets involved with the mixing of Cure albums, if only as a pair of fresh ears: \"I walk into it towards the end, when it's reached a certain stage. I'm not really interested in the way that things have been routed, or what's plugged up where. Also, a lot of the time, I just haven't had enough time, because we were doing promotion for the record as it was being mixed. After doing six or seven hours of interviews, I was knackered, and Steve would be waiting for me to say what I thought, so that he could move onto the next stage. So, it's been very broken up; more than it should have been.\"\n\nMixes were laid to half‑inch tape at 15ips, not in an attempt to add warmth to the ADAT recordings, but merely as a long‑term preference of both the band and Lyon. Smith: \"With half‑inch tape, at least you get a decent‑sized box, which feels like it's worth something. A DAT is like a Swan Vestas box! I regret the demise of vinyl albums as well — they're so big they actually meant something, and the artwork looked good.\n\n\"Adrian Sherwood mixed a track using 24‑track analogue, but then he mastered onto DAT. His was the only mix returned on DAT, even though he's Mr Analogue! The only difference was that we had to reduce the level compared to all the other mixes from half‑inch. But the difference in sound quality wasn't noticeable.\"\n\nMastering\n\nFinally, and in another break with tradition, Robert Smith's involvement on this album extended to supervision of the album's final mastering at Metropolis, London. Previously, Cure albums had been mastered at another facility, and Smith was not present. But this time, he wanted it done differently: \"I was very frustrated, especially with the last couple of releases we had, where I hadn't turned up. This time, I thought I should get involved. Ian Cooper at Metropolis was recommended to us by Flood.\n\n\"When using a cutting engineer, you have to have faith that the person knows what they're doing — because that's the final link in the chain that you really have no control over. We were discussing all the details for the cut, and I said 'How are you calibrating all this?' — and it was just with his ears, basically. So you've got to trust that he can actually hear!\n\n\"This album was a difficult one to cut, because it's been mixed by so many different people. Steve went down two days before, because I knew that that would be a technical day — for lining everything up, putting it into the computer and EQ'ing. I got a CD‑R the next day, listened through, and there were things I heard that I wasn't really sure were necessary. It was mainly EQ, but also compression. When I went along, I went having heard what they'd done — and heard it in one hit through a hi‑fi, unlike them. They'd spent 12 hours piecing it all together, and by the time you get to the 14th track, you just can't hear the same as you did on the first one.\n\n\"I'd made notes, and felt that if my feelings when I was in the mastering room the following day corresponded to how I'd felt listening in the house, then I'd know I was right. So I made a new set of notes, and asked Ian what he thought, and we agreed on five songs that had been either over‑EQ'd or compressed. In the end, it was quite an easy process.\"\n\nThe album Wild Mood Swings is out now. The Cure's world tour — The Swing Tour '96 — starts on May 21st in Aberdeen."
