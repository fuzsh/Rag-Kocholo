        "text": "The creative process and result of ‘beauty re-envisioned’ was such an amazing experience, that I thought why don’t we give that another go! So basically, ‘Out Of Chaos Comes…’ is to ‘The Storm Before The Calm’ as ‘Beauty Re-Envisioned’ is to ‘Finding Beauty In Chaos’.\n\nWe were again fortunate to be able to turn the creative reins over to an extremely talented cast of Producers, Artists and DJs; including Tim Palmer(The Mission, U2, David Bowie), John Fryer (Cocteau Twins, HIM, Depeche Mode), Film Composer Tyler Bates(John Wick, The Watchmen, Guardians Of The Galaxy), The Cure’s Roger O’Donnell and Marilyn Manson’s Paul Wiley.\n\nLike before, the full 27-track collection is deep and diverse and includes a few surprises. Ashton Nyte’s gorgeous acoustic version of ‘The Outside’, Cinthya Hussey’s (who’s beautiful painting also graces the cover) does a beautiful rendition of ‘The Delicate Balance Of All Things’ and a treasure from ‘FBIC’, an acoustic/mellotron drenched ‘Memory Of Love’ fromJohnny Indovina. You will even find some new and fantastic guitar moments from The Mission’s Simon Hinkler, Richard Fortus(GnR) and Nick Johnston.\n\nI sincerely hope you find some new faves and guilty pleasures amongst these new ‘re-envisions’!\n\nMichael Ciravolo\n\nCurator / Beauty In Chaos\n\n”\"Music is very personal to me, so it's rare that I remix or re-imagine another artist's music. But after decades of sharing our musical experiences through friendship, I was thrilled when Michael Ciravolo urged me to create a new expression of \"Temple of Desire,\" that is truly my own. The original song is already amazing, so the bar was a high mark to reach, but. Rafe Pearlman's evocative lyrics and soulful vocal performance inspired me to explore a new dimension for this track. I love both versions!\" … Tyler Bates (musician/Film-TV composer)\n\n“I had just released a new solo album, Waiting For A Voice, which is a lyric-focussed work, mostly inhabiting a space some have described as “haunting acoustic minimalism.” Michael reached out to see if I could give \"The Outside\" a similar treatment, for the new BIC remix album. So, I re-arranged and re-recorded the song from scratch, and then mixed and produced it so that it could essentially feel at home on Waiting For A Voice. I am rather delighted with how it came out, stripped to its essential elements, making space for a few additions, and highlighting the lyrics, which are sadly still rather timely. I still think it is a song of hope, and appreciate the opportunity and freedom to re-imagine the work for this release.” … Ashton Nyte\n\n'“Loved the song the first time I heard it.. being that it was 6 min long, I approached it trying to make each section aside from the chorus as interesting as the chorus.. I was revisiting Purple Rain and 1999 at the time, so I took a ‘When Doves Cry’ and ‘Little Red Corvette’ approach of sometimes having very little bass line.. and having it serve as a pulse when it was there..” ….Paul Wiley {Marylin Manson}\n\n““I had worked with Beauty In Chaos on their last remix album, so I jumped at the opportunity of working on another song this time with Austin resident Curse Mackey (Pigface, Thrill Kill Cult). The track hints at an electro Punk, feel so my intention was to highlight that, but I also felt that with some surgery it could be a strong single. Early on, my mate Simon Hinkler from The Mission submitted a really cool new guitar solo for the song so I was already off to a good start.\n\nAs always BIC gave me complete freedom to experiment with the song and arrangement so I really enjoyed contributing to the music and adding a sort of cinematic goth quality to the song”\n\n… Tim Palmer (The Mission, U2, David Bowie, Psychedelic Furs, The Cure. HIM)\n\n“This was the first song I wrote for ‘The Storm Before The Calm’ and still one of my favorites. When I heard Cinthya do her cover of The Smiths “Every Day Is Like Sunday”, I really feel in love with her voice. When I initially sent this stripped down version to her and Wayne, I thought she would sing more of the backups and harmonies to Wayne, but when Wayne sent the track back it was like WOW! She really took the song over and to a different beautiful place, and I knew it was something special. I reached out to two of the most tasteful and melodic players I knew to help embellish this new version. Mike Mallory, a monster of a bassist who I have played and recorded with in Human Drama. While I love my guitar solo on the original, I felt this needed something special and above my skillset. Nick Johnston is simply one of the best guitarists I know and he brought a real ‘Gilmour’ vibe and more to the outro. … Michael Ciravolo (Beauty In Chaos)\n\n“I started this remix idea at my home studio. When I stripped out some of the layers, I was drawn to Dirk’s drum beat, which reminded me of something Boris Williams of The Cure would do. It was pretty hypnotic with the bass guitar, so I just grabbed a couple of Seibold’s vocal lines and put them in a lot of delay. I even got him to record and send over sort of ‘spoken word’ verses. I felt I was on to something that would be a bit of a different approach on this song. I then sent my ‘sonic sketch’ over to Kevin Kipnis, who added some nice noisy drums and textures that helped dirty it up just a bit. Kirk Hellie added some nice guitar/theremin textures that I think threw a cool ‘left turn’ into the outro section. Michael Rozon then took all of these pieces of this puzzle and added his twists and made it all cohesive. … Michael Ciravolo / Curator -BEAUTY IN CHAOS\n\n“First of all I was pissed at Michael for not asking me to play on his album but then I forgave him when he asked me to do a remix and with the incredible Kat Leon on vocals, how could I say no? He wanted to tell me the chords and the structure and I was like fuck that all I need are the vocals hahahahaha and at the end just for him I played a Moog guitar solo. It took me a lot longer than usual as I really wanted this remix to be special as Michael is a very good and long time friend and I love his passion for music and this Beauty In Chaos project.” … Roger O’Donnell (The Cure)\n\n“The truth of the matter is that I DID ask Roger to play on it and his reply was; and I quote … 'You couldn’t afford me!”, which is probably true but I am eternally grateful for to call Roger a friend and all of the laughs and jabs we share … and his remix is world-class!” …. Michael Ciravolo (curator / Beauty In Chaos)\n\n“The combination of Ashton’s vocals and BIC is perfect...Dark, brooding and romantic. As always when attempting a ‘remix’ I tried to add some new elements and feelings. I came up with a guitar riff at the top of the song that set the new direction which became a combination of electronics and guitars. The tracks supplied are always so great that it is always a joy to be able to re-imagine these songs. … Tim Palmer\n\n\"I was asked to do the remix for “The Outside”, a couple months into the quarantine. I don’t know what the lyrics were actually written about, but to me, it was a song about this strange isolated world we were living in. The lyrics to the songs chorus are, “as we say goodnight and dream of the outside”. It was as though we were dreaming of getting back out to our normal lives. But right at this time we started having the riots and curfews here in Los Angeles. Chaos like I’ve never seen before. People running through the streets, stealing, smashing cars, burning buildings. It was such an uncertain and uncomfortable time. Being I was just about to begin creating my remix, I decided to take all of this insanity I was seeing and use that as the mood for this remix. Make it feel like this was the soundtrack that would be playing if you wandered out into the streets into the middle of all this craziness.” … Roman Marisak\n\n“Having heard my version of ‘Everyday Is Like Sunday’ I was thrilled to bits that Michael thought it a good idea to ask me to sing alongside Wayne’s original vocal on a new, chilled version of ‘The Delicate Balance Of All Things’.\n\nWe received the backing track and I spent a few days recording various vocal ideas onto my laptop.\n\nThen, when I was ready, we went into the studio and started recording.\n\nWayne heard the slight eastern feeling I was going for with the main voice and helped me work out some of the harmonies and innumerable layered vocal parts. For which I blame my love of the Cocteau Twins!\n\nIt was a challenge for me, never having done anything like this before, but it was fun and I enjoyed the process and am very proud of the end result and to be part of this new Beauty In Chaos release.\n\nI think the mix that Tim Palmer has done is amazing and can’t believe I’m singing on something that sounds so good!\n\nI'd like to thank Tim, and Wayne for his help, Michael Rozen for his, but most of all Michael Ciravolo for asking me to be a part of the BIC family.” … Cinthya Hussey\n\n“Choosing a song to remix from 'The Storm Before the Calm' was tough, as they all speak to me in various ways. I gravitated towards 'The Outside' due to it's deep and brooding nature. The instrumentation felt very natural with Ashton's voice, and I did not want to steer far away from that. I chose to sample and manipulate tracks from the original tune in order to create new grooves and riffs, with some subtle additions and textures here and there. It was a great pleasure (and a fun challenge) to see this song from under the hood, and I'd like to thank Michael and Beauty In Chaos for the opportunity! “ … The Phoenix Supernova\n\n\"When I heard the original track, the lyrics struck me as having the ability to go to a sort of Underworld place- but once I got in the studio with the stems things just kind of took a shape of their own. I gradually found myself building around a guitar riff I had originally intended to guide my structure once I edited the lyrics down. I found myself stomping and singing along as I got toward the finish line with things!\" … Luxury Noise\n\n‘Stranger’ is a favourite of mine, but when I read in the press that several other producers were remixing this song I paused. I had to figure out the one thing that I could bring to the song that nobody else could…... and in the end that was me! To me, the original always sounded like a conversation with your inner demon. So for my remix I gave that demon a voice and some conversational lyrics. The production is the style of dream pop I’ve been playing with on my own album this year to maintain the immersion of the original, just shifted slightly towards a different genre.” … Bentley Jones\n\n“Simply a little nip here and a tuck there! .When we released the song as a video/single from “The Storm Before The Calm’, several radio stations asked if we had a shorter, edited version as the original was over 6-minutes (as are many of our songs). So Michael Rozon and I went in the studio went in the studio and did a bit of dissection … which was honestly harder than it sounds as I had grown very accustomed and fond of the original!” … Michael Ciravolo (Curator/ Beauty In Chaos)"
