        "text": "They play seven shows as part of a huge European tour\n\nThe Cure have announced a seven-date UK & Ireland arena tour for December 2022.\n\nThe music legends will play an extensive run of shows throughout Europe next October and November before the UK & Ireland leg kicks off at Dublin 3Arena on Thursday 1st December.\n\nThe tour then visits Belfast SSE Arena, Glasgow OVO Hydro, Leeds First Direct Arena, Birmingham Utilita Arena and Cardiff Motorpoint Arena before concluding at London The SSE Arena on Sunday 10th December.\n\nThe Cure UK tour tickets:\n\nTickets to The Cure’s shows in Scotland, Wales and England go on sale from Absolute Radio Tickets at 10am on Friday 10th December 2021.\n\nThe Cure’s last studio album ‘4:13 Dream’ was released way back in 2008, however the band have spoken about fresh material in multiple interviews.\n\nReflecting upon the pressures of making a new album, keyboardist Roger O’Donnell told Classic Pop magazine: “Four years ago, I said to Robert (Smith), ‘We have to make one more record. It has to be the most intense, saddest, most dramatic and most emotional record we’ve ever made, and then we can just walk away from it.’\n\n“He agreed. Listening to the demos, it is that record. I think everybody will be happy with it.”\n\nO’Donnell continued: “The problem is, it’s 12 years since the last album so it becomes precious. When you’ve got a back catalogue like The Cure, it’s a lot to live up to. Robert has said, ‘if The Cure say any more, it had better be important and it had better be f---ing good’.\n\n“It is, it’s going to be an amazing record. I just suggest a little patience.”\n\nIn August 2021, bassist Simon Gallup announced he was leaving The Cure after becoming “fed up of betrayal.”\n\nGallup wrote at the time: “With a slightly heavy heart I am no longer a member of The Cure! Good luck to them all...”\n\nTwo months later, Gallup confirmed he’s still a member of the legendary band.\n\nThe Cure’s UK tour dates:\n\nDECEMBER 2022\n\nDublin 3Arena – Thu 1st\n\nBelfast SSE Hydro – Fri 2nd\n\nGlasgow OVO Hydro – Sun 4th\n\nLeeds First Direct Arena – Tue 6th\n\nBirmingham Utilita Arena – Wed 7th\n\nCardiff Motorpoint Arena – Thu 8th\n\nLondon SSE Arena Wembley – Sun 11th\n\nBuy The Cure tickets\n\n34 of your favourite artists: Then and now:\n\nListen to Absolute Radio across the UK on your digital radio, the free Rayo app, by hitting that play button on the bottom of your screen or by asking your smart speaker to \"play Absolute Radio\"."
