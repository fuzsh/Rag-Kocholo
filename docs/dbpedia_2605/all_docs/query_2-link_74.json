        "text": "The Get In Her Ears team have put together another eclectic mix of guitar tunes, indie gems & immersive electronic sounds for your listening pleasure. Take some time to scroll through our track choices below and make sure you hit play on the Spotify playlist at the end of this post.\n\nFollow GIHE on Spotify to hear all of our previous playlists too.\n\nVERO – ‘She’s Scared Of Everything’\n\nI can hard relate to this aptly titled track from Stockholm-based trio VERO, who have released their debut album, Unsoothing Interior, today! (6th May). The band feel the fear and do things their own way via swirling guitars, moody vocals and angsty lyrics and I’m a big fan of everything they’ve released so far. I can’t wait to give the vinyl a spin.\n\n(Kate Crudgington)\n\nDeep Tan – ‘Rudy Ya Ya Ya’\n\nThe latest single from London trio deep tan, ‘rudy ya ya ya’ offers a bizarrely witty ode to the former mayor of NYC. Maintaining all the wonderfully wacky yet seductively dark sentiment we’ve come to know and love from the band, it’s beset with haunting, glitchy hooks and sweeping, sultry vocals, resulting in a strangely addictive, fizzing cacophony. diamond horsetail, the upcoming new EP from deep tan, is released digitally today (6th May) and physical copies will be available on 22nd July. (Mari Lane)\n\nMomma – ‘Speeding 72’\n\nNew York-based Momma just keep releasing alternative banger after alternative banger, and this track ‘Speeding 72’ is no exception! It’s taken from their upcoming album Household Name, which is set for release on 1st July via Lucky Number. (KC)\n\nGhum – ‘Some People’\n\nThe latest single from long-term faves, GHUM, ‘Some People’ reflects on the fear of hurting someone who you may have fallen out of love with. Rippling with a seductive ethereal allure and dark hypnotic splendour, a colossal grunge-tinged anthem is created. I’m super excited that Ghum’s debut album is set for release on 17th June via Everything Sucks. (ML)\n\nBad Waitress – ‘Spit It Out’\n\nFollowing the release of their debut album No Taste last year, Toronto-based four-piece punk rock band Bad Waitress are back with a new single ‘Spit It Out’. Showcasing the band’s gritty, fierce energy and empowering drive, it’s a wonderfully raucous, punk-fuelled anthem. And I cannot wait to finally see Bad Waitress live at Moth Club, supporting Gustaf, next Monday 9th May! (ML)\n\nReal Big Sky – ‘Jess’\n\nI love this reverb-heavy, atmospheric guitar tune from Gothenburg four-piece Real Big Sky. The track blurs powerful riffs with melancholic vocals to create a commanding four minutes of brooding indie noise. Keep your eyes peeled for updates on Real Big Sky’s self-titled debut album, which is set for release in July. (KC)\n\nBestfriend – ‘Someplace Else’\n\nFollowing last year’s debut EP, places i’ve lived, LGBTQ Vancouver/Toronto based bedroom-pop duo Bestfriend have now announced the release of their upcoming new EP, due out in the summer. Ahead of the EP, they recently shared an utterly dreamy new offering. Reflecting on the optimistic feelings of a new crush, ‘Someplace Else’ oozes a lush, ethereal soundscape as sugar-sweet harmonies flow with a shimmering, uplifting energy. (ML)\n\nMartha Rose & GRIP TIGHT – ‘Never B Mine’\n\nI am loving this collaboration from Martha Rose and GRIP TIGHT which has such a soft sadness to it. (Tash Walker)\n\nJelly Crystal & Seinabo Sey – ‘I Tryyy’\n\nA truly delightful piece of music from Swedish artists Jelly Crystal and Seinabo Sey. Serving as a fervent love song, with those beautiful vocals from Seinabo Sey soaring over the top of the synthy crescendos. It’s the latest single to be taken from Jelly Crystal’s forthcoming EP, ILY, which is out in June. (TW)\n\nShivum Sharma – ‘Overload’\n\nThis was my Track Of The Show on the May edition of our Soho Radio show, from Indian Irish artist Shivum Sharma. I am loving it! (TW)\n\nHannah Holland x Planningtorock – ‘Planningtobeams’\n\nA collab from two of our faves here at GIHE, Planningtorock and Hannah Holland. What a tune! looking forward to hearing this on our Spring dancefloors. (TW)\n\nNikki & The Waves – ‘The Phone Song’\n\nThe new single from Liverpool band Nikki & The Waves, ‘The Phone Song’ instantly hits you with its jangly, quirky energy. Propelled by an uplifting, vibrant groove, it flows with fizzing hooks and Nikki’s lush, sugar-sweet vocals, as voicemails from those closest to the band – spanning Hong Kong to America – are interwoven into the funk-fuelled musicality. Complete with swooping trombone solos, sparkling harmonies and a relatable witty lyricism, it showcases all there is to love about Nikki & The Waves. (ML)\n\nSecret World Orchestra ft. Circe – ‘It’s All Over’\n\nTaking musical and lyrical cues from Circe’s previous single ‘Mess With Your Head‘, Secret World Orchestra aka Jules Konieczny (who is one half of alt-pop duo APRE) has extrapolated on her original piece and created ‘It’s All Over’. It’s a tender electronic musing on the fluctuating nature of love, designed to capture that end-of-the-night feeling on a lonely dancefloor. (KC)\n\nGrawl!x – ‘Hopelessness’\n\nGrawl!x’s first new music since 2010, ‘Hopelessness’ showcases the band’s newly expanded line-up with front person Maria Micheal Machlin’s lush vocals at the forefront. Flowing with a twinkling, ethereal splendour, it’s an utterly dreamy offering oozing both a joyous energy and reflective vulnerability. A thoughtful, yet uplifting, ode to hope and honesty. Spring, the upcoming new EP from Grawl!x, is set for release later this month via Reckless Yes. (ML)\n\nBeauty Sleep – ‘I Love It Here, I Hate It’\n\nThe latest single from Belfast duo Beauty Sleep, ‘I Love It Here, I Hate It’ is a perfectly shimmering slice of stirring alt-pop. Juxtaposing lush melodic grooves with a rich orchestral splendour, a sweeping, utterly dreamy soundscape is created. (ML)\n\nEthel Cain – ‘American Teenager’\n\nThis Ethel Cain song is absolutely lushhhh and I cannot wait to hear her full album, Preacher’s Daughter, when it’s released on 12th May via her own imprint Daughters Of Cain. Please check her out. Her gorgeous, moody sounds will melt the ears right off the side of your face. (KC)\n\nQueen Kwong ft. Roger O’Donnell – ‘On The Run’\n\nI remember interviewing Queen Kwong before her in-store show at Rough Trae East back in 2018 and being dazzled by her live performance. Her sound has evolved beautifully since then, and I’m loving this moody cut ‘On The Run’, featuring The Cure’s keyboard player Roger O’Donnell. This track is taken from Queen Kwong’s upcoming album, Couples Only, which is set for release on 12th July. (KC)\n\nBloomsday – ‘ISO’\n\nThis earnest, poignant musing from New York duo Bloomsday extrapolates on vocalist Iris Garrison’s journey to become “acquainted with their body and the inner parts of their experience” and to “learn to like themselves and what came with being in transition.” This track is taken from Bloomsday’s debut album, Place To Land, which is set for release on 10th June via Bayonet Records. (KC)\n\nAmaroun – ‘Orchid’\n\nAmaroun’s latest release is a celebration of self-love and queerness. ‘Orchid’ is about slow-motion growth, in Amaroun’s words “It’s a pledge to my lover to bend and grow together, entwined but independence, embracing all our differences. It’s a story of taking your time and staying in the present, a reflection of a beautiful moment.” (TW)\n\nArt Moore – ‘Snowy’\n\n‘Snowy’ is the debut single from new collaborative project Art Moore – aka Taylor Vick (Boy Scouts), Sam Durkes and Trevor Brooks (Ezra Furman’s band). This track is inspired by loss and loneliness, described as “that feeling that someone is right next to you, but you know they can’t be.” (KC)\n\nKindred Fawn – ‘Silver Blanket’\n\nThe new solo project from GIHE faves Naz & Ella’s Ella Patenall, Kindred Fawn has shared her beautiful new single. Inspired by Patenall’s comfort in listening to the shipping forecast, ‘Silver Blanket’ combines rich aural textures with reflective pastoral musings to create a captivating, melancholic soundscape. (ML)\n\nYdegirl – ‘I Need This’\n\n‘I need this’ by Copenhagen-based artist Ydegirl, taken from her 2019 self-titled debut album which I have only just discovered. Some lovely chamber art-pop for you all. I’m looking forward to Ydegirl’s music weaving into my ears more over the coming year. (TW)\n\nMaria BC – ‘Betelgeuse’\n\n“Betelgeuse is about coming to terms with one’s role as a victim, bystander, and perpetrator,” explains Maria BC. Through tender vocals and atmospheric guitar sounds, Maria ruminates on the nature of anticipation, abandonment and disappointment, but despite its melancholy context, the track is an oddly comforting listen. ‘Betelgeuse’ is taken from Maria’s debut album Hyaline, which is set for release on 27th May via Fear Of Missing Out records here in the UK. (KC)\n\nHercules Love Affair, ANOHNI – ‘Poisonous Storytelling’\n\nI was so excited to hear the news that ANOHNI has teamed up again with Hercules & Love Affair, their last collaboration happening back in 2008. This is the latest single from In Amber, producer Andy Butler’s first Hercules & Love Affair album in five years, which also features Siouxsie and the Banshees drummer Budgie. Speaking about the track, ANOHNI explains that this song is an attack on misinformation that permeates the news cycle and social media: “We must be careful with new narratives, because everyone is rotted out from poisonous storytelling.” Hopefully this will not be the last we hear from ANOHNI. I have everything crossed to be able to see them live at some point again in my life. (TW)\n\nErasers – ‘A Breeze’\n\nThe new single from Perth-based ‘dungeon synth’ duo Rebecca Orchard and Rupert Thomas – aka Erasers -, ‘A Breeze’ evokes the raw beauty of their native landscape of Western Australia oozing an immersive ethereal splendour and poignant, layered musicality. ‘A Breeze’ is taking from Erasers’ hypnotic latest album, Constant Connection. (ML)\n\nZola Jesus – ‘Desire’\n\nI am so happy to see that Zola Jesus is releasing new music! This powerful track ‘Desire’ is taken from her upcoming album, Arkhon, which is set for release on 24th June via one of my favourite record labels, Sacred Bones. Her voice makes my heart ache (in the good way) and it’s showcased in all its glory on this emotive and poignant track. (KC)\n\nHaving just released their debut album, No Taste, Toronto band Bad Waitress have been become firm favourites over the last few months with the riotous, raging power of singles such as ‘Strawberry Milkshake‘ and their playful recent video for album track ‘Rabbit Hole‘. With scuzzy, pulsating hooks and immense, seething vocals, we just can’t get enough of their frenzied, empowering drive and dark, swirling energy.\n\nWe spoke to the band to find out more about the new album, what inspires them, and their feelings about how the music scene is for women and non binary people at the moment… Have a read!\n\nHi Bad Waitress, welcome to Get In Her Ears – thanks so much for joining us! How are you doing today?\n\nWe’re doing real good thanks! Thanks for speaking with us.\n\nHow did you all initially meet and start creating music together?\n\nKali came down from the big white north and met Moon, they started jamming occasionally and Katelyn dropped some heavy hints that they wanted in on the jams too. Kali messaged Nicole on Facebook a couple years later when they needed a new bassist… And the rest is history!\n\nWe big fans of your raging, energy-fuelled sound, but who would you say are your main musical influences?\n\nSonic Youth, Idles, PJ Harvey, The Birthday Party, Gang of Four!\n\nYou’ve just released your debut album No Taste, which is super exciting! Are you able to tell us a bit about the album? Are there any particular themes or inspirations running throughout it? And how does the writing process normally work within the band?\n\nA lot of the stuff discussed in the songs is reflective of turbulent childhoods, political unrest, complicated relationships and uncomfortable expectations being forced on you. The band is definitely a place to air out our frustrations and make sense of the world around us. Sometimes Kali will bring lyrics and a structure and the rest of us will work off of that, other times we just start jamming and latch on to a certain riff or beat and it turns into a song somehow. It’s very much a collaborative process – each of us brings something unique to the mix.\n\nHow have you found recording and promoting an album during these strange times? Have you had to adjust the way that you’d normally do things?\n\nWe actually recorded this album in the summer of 2019 – it was originally going to be released in 2020, but we decided to hold on to it until we figured out what the heck was going on with the world. We’ve definitely had to work on our online presence more; we did some weird variety show type stuff on our Instagram live, we did a Twitch stream, we’ve done a couple livestream shows. It’s been a lot more internet based stuff, but it seems like live-in-the-flesh type situations are on the horizon, so maybe we won’t have to figure out how to get big on tiktok just yet.\n\nWe love your latest vibrant Mad Hatters-esque video for album track ‘Rabbit Hole’ – are you able to tell us a bit about the inspiration behind this song and its magnificent visuals?\n\nWe just really like having fun with the videos we make. We’re all into weird horror movies, Kali and Katelyn especially, so we draw from that a lot. It’s a chance for us to live out whatever crazy fantasies we dream up that day. ‘Rabbit Hole’ is a pretty dark song about being trapped in the comfort of depression – we didn’t want to have a drab depressing video for it though, so we went the complete opposite direction visually.\n\nYou’ve previously described the main premise of forming the band as being that you “…just wanted to get together and play music with people who weren’t old men” (which sounds like a great reason to me!). How do you feel the music scene is generally for women and non binary folk at the moment? Do you feel that much has changed or improved over the last few years?\n\nWe love seeing how many more bands there are nowadays made up of women, trans people and non binary people. Honestly though, there’s still a long way to go. We still get backhanded compliments, or weird micro aggressions about how impressed people are that we can actually play our instruments, or people assuming we’re finding some success because we’re not men, or people telling us what we should do with our music or stage presence, as though they know better. There’s also a lot of misgendering (Moon and Katelyn are non binary, Kali and Nicole are women) and that’s exhausting. But there’s also a beautifully supportive community that we’re a part of, full of people that are constantly learning and lifting each other up. There’s lots of work still to do, but there’s also lots of people willing to put in that work and make the scene a better place for everyone.\n\nThe last year has obviously been difficult for everyone in different ways, but has there been anything or anyone specific that has been inspiring you, or helping to motivate you, recently?\n\nOur local music scene is really inspiring. There’s been so many cool things coming out of the pandemic. Houndstooth is a bar that’s been hosting shows safely, with a band playing inside behind windows and people can watch from the street. Our friend Danny Alexander made a short film about local musicians and how they were dealing with quarantine. Ultra is a Toronto-based zine that creatives can contribute anything to – poetry, music, photography, interviews. Lootbag Records put out a few compilation albums, and there’s been a bunch of bands releasing new music. Everything our friends have been making inspires us to keep creating!\n\nAnd it’s obviously quite difficult organising anything right now, but – in addition to the release of the new album – what else does the rest of 2021 have in store for Bad Waitress?\n\nWe’ve got a tour coming up with Kills Birds in December, which we’re really stoked about! We can’t wait to tear it up on stage again; that’s where we’re really at home. Hopefully 2022 is the time for music to really be able to come back full force.\n\nFinally, as we’re a new music focused site, are there any other new/upcoming bands or artists you’d recommend we check out?\n\nThe Effens, Wine Lips, Your Grandad, Burner, Piper Maru, Animatist, Kali Horse, Hot Garbage, Mother Tongues… Just to name a few!\n\nMassive thanks to Bad Waitress for answering our questions! Watch their latest video for ‘Manners’ here:\n\nNo Taste, the debut album from Bad Waitress, is out now via Royal Mountain Records.\n\nPhoto Credit: Kate Dockeray"
