This prestigious award is given to current educators—from kindergarten through college in both public and private schools—who have made a significant and lasting contribution to the field of music education and who advocate for the ongoing inclusion of music education in schools. This year’s quarterfinalists hail from 202 cities and were chosen from more than 2,400 initial nominations. Additionally, 159 legacy applicants from 2024 are also eligible for this year’s award.\n\nSemi-finalists for the 2025 Music Educator Award will be announced later this year. The ultimate recipient will be celebrated during GRAMMY Week 2025.\n\nA collaborative effort between the Recording Academy and GRAMMY Museum, the Music Educator Award invites nominations from students, parents, friends, colleagues, community members, school deans, and administrators. Teachers may also nominate themselves, and those nominated are invited to complete a more detailed application.\n\nEach year, one recipient is selected from among 10 finalists and recognized for their profound impact on students' lives. The 11th annual honoree will be flown to Los Angeles to attend the 67th GRAMMY Awards and participate in various GRAMMY Week events. The nine other finalists will receive a $1,000 honorarium, and the schools of all 10 finalists will receive matching grants. Additionally, fifteen semi-finalists will be awarded a $500 honorarium with matching school grants.\n\nRead More: 8 Artists Who Were Inspired By Their Teachers: Rihanna, Adele, Jay-Z & More\n\nThe Music Educator Award program, including the honorariums and matching school grants, is supported by the Chuck Lorre Family Foundation this year.

An important friend of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and advisor, organizer and funder of the Civil Rights Movement, Belafonte helped organize the 1961 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and contributed to the 1961 Freedom Rides and the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. Belafonte was outspoken throughout his career about American political elections; he performed at President John F. Kennedy's inaugural ball and was later named as a cultural advisor to the Peace Corps by Kennedy.\n\nCreating the gold record standard in the music industry, Belafonte's 1956 RCA album CALYPSO made him the first artist in history to sell over 1 million albums. An advocate for global humanitarian causes including the Anti-Apartheid Movement and USA for Africa, Belafonte, in 1985, was the key organizer for the benefit single \"We Are The World,\" which raised money for famine relief in Africa and ultimately won four GRAMMY Awards; it remains one of the best-selling physical singles of all time. As well, Belafonte became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1987 and traveled internationally to raise awareness for the needs of children across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nA two-time GRAMMY winner and 11-time GRAMMY nominee, Belafonte received the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. Three of Belafonte's recordings are inducted into the GRAMMY Hall of Fame: Belafonte At Carnegie Hall (inducted in 1999), \"Banana Boat (Day-O)\" (inducted in 2009), and Calypso (inducted in 2015).\n\nRead More: Fight The Power: 11 Powerful Protest Songs Advocating For Racial Justice\n\n\"The greatness of Harry Belafonte's artistic legacy is matched by his profound impact of furthering social justice for all,\" Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said in a statement. \"We are honored to recognize his lasting influence with the Harry Belafonte Best Song for Social Change Award and to continue celebrating works that have inspired global communities towards social impact.\"\n\n\"The Belafonte estate is deeply honored and thrilled that the Recording Academy's Best Song For Social Change Award will now be named the Harry Belafonte Best Song For Social Change Award,\" Belafonte's living family members and Belafonte estate representatives Adrienne, Shari, Gina, and Pamela Belafonte said in a statement. \"This recognition not only celebrates Harry Belafonte's enduring legacy in music and activism, but also inspires future generations to continue using their voices and art for justice and positive change.\"\n\nThe original Best Song For Social Change Special Merit Award debuted at the 2023 GRAMMYs. The inaugural award, presented by First Lady Jill Biden, went to \"Baraye\" by Iranian singer/songwriter Shervin Hajipour. At the 2024 GRAMMYs, the award went to \"Refugee\" by K'naan, Steve McEwan, and Gerald Eaton. \"The words [K'naan] wrote for the song resonate with me like not many songs do,\" McEwan said about \"Refugee\" in an interview featured in the 2024 GRAMMYs program book.\n\nMusic's Biggest Night is back!
