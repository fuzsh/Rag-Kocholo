        "text": "This is where we showcase\n\nIndie Music.\n\nHit us up if you are interested in showcasing your project.\n\nGORDON DEPPE / THE SPOONS\n\nCheck out the latest Person Of Interest interview with Gordon Deppe from The Spoons with an exclusive on where the artist is currently at.\n\n​\n\n“New Day New World”, the first studio project to be released by the Spoons in over eight years, is available now!\n\nThis new album plays on the band’s earlier edgy electro-80s sound and evokes the fun, pop sounds of their biggest hits, while transporting them firmly into 2019.\n\n​\n\nThe new album is now available to purchase directly on both CD and Vinyl......\n\nEwan Macfarlane\n\nFORMER Grim Northern Social frontman , and former frontman/singer of electro band Apollo 440, also a member of house music duo Mennska\n\nis just out of the studio with his long awaited brand new solo LP.\n\nIt is an honour to have him\n\nin the studio to reveal his new material & interview.\n\nCheck it out here.\n\nHIPPY\n\nHippy is the creative collaboration between singer songwriter Paul 'Hippy' Hipson and guitarist Hugh Frizell both based in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nPrior to the formation of Hippy, Paul has played many well received local and national shows over time and built an enviable reputation as both writer and performer with several single, album and EP releases. Hugh is also a seasoned musician of many years with many gigs, touring and recording work under his belt.\n\n​\n\nThe guys met by chance in Glasgow back in September 2019 and hit it off personally and musically. In doing so they decided to go into the studio to cut a song and see if it clicked between them. It did. The result of that first studio collaboration was the track 'Aries Girl' which was released in November 2019 and met with critical acclaim.\n\n​\n\nThe subsequent follow up songs including, 'Feelgood', 'Junkyard Babies' and 'Volunteer' were received with genuine positivity from critics and fans alike. At this point - with Paul and Hugh both thoroughly enjoying the experience of crafting their songs and finalising them in the studio - the decision was then made to try to attempt to write and record a full album.\n\nThe album was successfully completed by September 2020 at the HQ Recording Studios, Glasgow and features 12 tracks, 11 written by Hippy/ Hugh Frizell and one live cover taken from an earlier live appearance in Glasgow - 'Waiting For a Friend' previously sung by The Who's Roger Daltrey.\n\n​\n\n'Behind Every Song is a Story’ - Hippy was released digitally on all major platforms on October 9th.\n\nSTEVE WALLER\n\nCanadian musician Steve Waller, has been actively creating music across various musical genres, leaning to the harder / darker forms of this art, Beginning in the mid 80's skate punk / metal scene.\n\nHis introduction to electronic music via skinny puppy, meat beat manifesto, front 242 and others, has curated an addiction to hardware synths, and samplers.\n\nThis has lead to current industrial techno, and cold wave projects with musicians from around the globe .\n\nHOUSE OF FLOWERS\n\nHouse of Flowers\n\nHouse of Flowers are Paul Sumner & Stevie Gell\n\nThey have been creating music in various guises since the mid 90’s when as teenagers their band Ease signed to Beatific records and released the album Cigarette Machine from God This was the height of “Britpop” and although the album had great critical acclaim due to the label going bust the release never got the traction it should\n\n​\n\nSince the early days they have both been on very different journeys but still always stayed close bond by their eclectic taste in music.\n\nPaul is the real traditional musican in the band being a left handed drummer and also accomplished guitar play and top draw singer often referred to as the harmony machine in the studio due to his talent of layering first take harmonies.\n\n​\n\nSince the 90’s Paul has worked as a session musician and Artist development at the infamous Rofl Studios in Nottingham\n\nStevie took a more electronic path when he discovered house music in the late 90’s developing a successful career as a DJ and producer running his own club night Deluxe, he has always written songs on the piano & guitar developing a talent for poignant heartfelt lyrics that seem to resonate with people on many levels.\n\nThe writing process between Paul & Stevie is magical to witness and the type of partnership you can only have when you have spent 20 years writing together.\n\n​\n\nThey take a very relaxed approach often writing whilst has watching football and finishing each others sentences and chord progressions instinctively whilst appearing to put very little effort into the job in hand.\n\nThe debut Single released 30th October on Parloscope International Recordings is the self titled House of Flowers\n\nThe song written in late 2019 which they began recording just before lockdown magically fits the world of uncertainty we live in today.\n\n​\n\nHouse of Flowers is a big song of Hope, Love and Protest that recognises the fragility of life told through nature and the life cycle of a Flower, growing, blooming and giving eternal life from its seeds retuning back to earth and growing again.\n\nIts mature powerful pop music with a message of Love.\n\n2021 is gonna be a big year for House of Flowers with a string of single release planned on Parloscope and number of festival appearances penned in for the summer\n\nSynners of Truth\n\nSynners of Truth are a duo comprising of Joe O'Rafferty and Johnzo Reid and based north of Toronto, Canada.\n\nJoe is originally from Belfast, Ireland and resides in Caledon, Ontario. Joe is the singer and lyricist and also helps arrange the music when required.\n\nJohnzo is originally from the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, England and resides in Wasaga Beach, Ontario. Johnzo composes the music and helps out with backing vocals.\n\nWe met when we played in another band, The Wednesday Boys, way back in the day when Brampton had a great British bar scene and we played Brit alternative songs from the likes of The Smiths, Echo & The Bunnymen, The Jam, The Farm and many other 80's bands.\n\nAs The Wednesday Boys were wrapping up as a band Joe and I hung out at my place and quite by accident began writing our own original songs. By accident I mean I would be quietly strumming what I considered to be 'finger warming exercises' for the guitar until one day Joe implored me to make a basic recording on an old tape recorder. I thought he was losing it to be honest but Joe has that 2nd sight for music and a few days later came over to my place and asked me to play the tune again, I didn't know which 'tune' he meant but we figured it out so I played it and Joe began singing his new lyrics to it.\n\nThat first song grew into more from my 'finger warming' ditty's and we had enough to play the Toronto clubs such as Lee's Palace, The Opera House and The Elmo etc. That band was called 'Less Is More'.\n\nLife got in the way and we went our own ways but I knew we had unfinished musical business and 18 years later I contacted Joe and gradually we got back into our music, the old songs proved timeless and it seemed surreal hearing a couple of them being played on Wasaga Beaches radio station 97.7 The Beach.\n\nWe found it extremely challenging to find other band members due to our music being influenced by our backgrounds in the UK and Ireland and it became inevitable that we market ourselves as a duo today.\n\n2020 changed everything for us as we became fortunate enough to be helped by a musical genius, Damian Spaulding, who is re-recording, playing instruments, mixing and producing our songs one by one starting with Shake Mahone which will be released under Damian's record label (Spaulding Canada) and publishing company.\n\n​\n\ncontact : retech@rogers.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SynnersOfTruth/photos/?ref=page_internal\n\nYAMMA KING\n\nHello world, it’s\n\nYammaKing bringing you the classics, inspired by the greats.\n\n​\n\nMy inspiration comes from Meek Mill, The Game, Dr. Dre, Nipsey Hussle and Jay-Z. I’m very old school when it comes to rap,\n\n​\n\nso the plan is to bring that old style back to the precipice of hip hop.\n\nI've been doing this for awhile but never had the facility to put my work out. My good friend built his own studio, along with a record label to facilitate my passion.\n\nEnnea records and ennea studio is where I call my home when it comes to the music.\n\n​\n\nMy goal is to make people feel emotions while listening to my songs and if it does, well then I've done my job right. You know what it is.\n\n​\n\nCONTACT\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/yammaking\n\n​\n\nNeon Bloom formed in early 2017; rehearsing in a backyard garage located in Toronto’s Annex neighbourhood.
