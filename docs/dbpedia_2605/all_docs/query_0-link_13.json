        "text": "Future X Metro Boomin - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nWriting and Editing by Fiza Javid\n\nPhotography by Bobby Talamine\n\nGrant Park - Saturday August 3, 2024\n\n​I got gas in the tank. I got money in the bank. I got news for you baby, you're looking at the KILLER aka celebrating the fact that the Killers would be one of the incredible headliners this fine Saturday, along with Future X Metro Boomin, and we were looking forward to a rager of a day!\n\nI was jamming my heart out to a couple songs on my drive over to the festival: Guess by Charli XCX ft. Billie Eilish, along with Jane's Addiction's new song \"Imminent Redemption\". Already extra hyped and I didn't even make it to the festival yet.\n\nOnce I made it, I could only think \"letssss gooo!!\" Tom Brady style.\n\nSo many incredible highlights of the day: Brigitte Calls Me Baby, Friko, Killer Mike, Deftones, IVE, ROMY, Dasha, The Killers and Future X Metro Boomin. ALWAYS to name a few because everyone is worth seeing.\n\nFUTURE X METRO BOOMIN. Pyrotechnics. Booming sound. Booming audience. Major bangers all the way through. The future covers were a blast, like \"Low Life\" and Mask Off.\" Every song was just so much fun to watch.\n\nFuture X Metro Boomin - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nFuture X Metro Boomin - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nFuture X Metro Boomin - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nDeftones was truly the rage we needed to see at this year's Lolla. Listening to \"Digital Bath,\" \"Mascara,\" Change,\" and many more, we were genuinely rockin out.\n\nWatching Deftones is like jumping into a time capsule, except they just never lose their touch, ever.\n\nLots of the audience was fresh off their performance at the Metro too, and looked forward to experience them at Lolla.\n\nTruth be told, a band like Deftones knows how to create a unique small venue experience and also turn it up x1000 for a major festival. They have the freedom to let completely loose, jump sky high, and that is precisely what they did. Accolades all around.\n\nKiller MIKE. Another set filled with ragers. Songs like \"THANK YOU LORD,\" \"RUN,\" and \"DOWN BY LAW,\" he brought another element of loose and blow your mind off entertainment.\n\nHe raps his tail off and always knows how to get the crowd truly in the moment with him. Truly unstoppable he is.\n\nDeftones - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nDeftones - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nKiller Mike - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nKiller Mike - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nThen there was Brigitte Calls Me Baby. Fresh off a mindblowing performance on Jimmy Kimmel, they were like the ultimate 80's have returned and took the Killers with them, nostalgic sound we needed. But Wes Leavins is not a time traveller, he is an original true showman.\n\nHis credits include working on the Elvis soundtrack and even playing Elvis on stage. Its no wonder he knows a thing or two.\n\nSeeing him was a marvel, and his voice echoes like the Smiths, just wholesome and genuine.\n\nMore honorable mentions as stated above: Friko, IVE, ROMY, Dasha, Every single one of these artists shined through and through.\n\nIVY was so mesmerizing. Six absolute starlets on stage with pure perfection in every move. Truly a joy to watch.\n\nThe Killers absolutely owned their set, true service men they are, and hands down one of the greatest bands on this planet.\n\nBrigitte Calls Me Baby - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nFriko - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nIVE - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nROMY - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nDasha - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nI CANNOT believe there is only one day left, it always goes by too quickly.\n\n​Until Sunday, fun day - JBTV Music Television\n\nIVE, ROMY, Jerry Nunn, Ava Maybee, Nico Vega, Dasha, The Killers, Skrillex, Tate McCrae, JBTV Music Television, Bobby Talamine, Chicago, Live music, Lollapalooza 2024, Fiza Javid, Jerry Bryant, Grant Park, Hippo Campus, Deftones\n\nStray Kids - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nWriting and Editing by Fiza Javid\n\nPhotography by Bobby Talamine\n\nGrant Park - Friday August 2, 2024\n\nWelcome back! If you're reading this, I made it out of Friday night of Lollapalooza 2024 as exhilarated as ever. While the heat continued to beat down, these incredible acts continued to bring up the heat a couple notches, and we were prepared for a sauna.\n\nSo much spice, so much pizzazz, and so much excitement.\n\nToday's highlights: Stray Kids, Militarie Gun, Faye Webster, Blu DeTiger, Lauffey, Brandi Cyrus in a round two, McKenna Grace (What?! ahhh!!), to name only a few!!\n\nNotable mentions, dare I not say Sexyy Red and SZA, Both were IMPECCABLE!\n\nSTRAY KIDS.\n\nIs a phenomenon. They came out so confident, so self assured and so exhilarated.\n\nIt never ceases to amaze me seeing younger fans learning to speak korean so they can not only sing along but also in case they have a chance to talk to their favorite K-Pop artists.\n\nThe younger generation of today is incredibly brilliant.\n\nStray Kids was the absolute moment.\n\nThey came out with “S-Class” and “FREEZE”\n\nWhile BTS gives the genuine nostalgic pop vibe, Stray Kids, came with an exciting electronic, cinematic and narrative feel of song-story telling and performing.\n\nIt was definitely like no one I had ever seen before.\n\nNot only do I want to continue to see more BTS, but we may be due for a collar between these two power groups.\n\nOne of their closing songs was “MANIAC” and this crowd damn near lost it. Pure energy and ecstasy.\n\nStray Kids - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nStray Kids - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nOmg. PawPaw Rod. You made a HUGE fan out of me.\n\nWith a look straight out of the Jimi Hendrix fashion line, he still had such a thrilling, unique stage presence the moment he addressed that crowd.\n\nThen his voice came through the mic and it was like taking the bite of a new piece of favorite dessert. Smooth. Delectable. Pure joy.\n\nSo funky, so fresh, so original. I could present adjectives for days. But his music made me truly feel like I was put in a happy place.\n\nParticularly the song “Shadow” it was an absolute VIBE. Here I go with the adjectives again!! I can’t help it. I am pretty sure I am in love.\n\nPawPaw Rod - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nPawPaw Rod - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nMilitarie Gun. To go from funky with PawPaw to Prog Rock over her is definitely a beautiful jolt.\n\nWhat a performer. With songs like \"Thought You Were Waving\" he has the makings of an angsty voice of a generation. I wouldn't be surprised if I see a sea of fans singing along in due time, but this crowd sure as hell did too.\n\nWith a rugged name, his music was soothing, his presence and music was relatable and dare I say beautiful again? Ive said it a few times already.\n\nThen a song like \"Do It Faster\" comes on and he's got us all jumping around with some pouring water on themselves. So much fun and this is exactly what Lollapalooza is about. Truly highlighting the best rock artists to date, thats for sure.\n\nFaye Webster. Pure harmonizing elegant voice and the sound of being on a road trip with the love of your life. She has a collab with Lil Yachty called \"Lego Ring\" that needs to be checked out on YouTube, but witnessing this and her live was therapeutic.\n\n​RAYE. Lollapalooza is the Genesis of her, and \"Genesis\" is a piece of 7 minute brilliance exploring phone addiction and societal issues with the utmost cool and clarity. She has rihanna sound elements, hip hop, raps as smooth and as poetically as one can dream of. \"If you're thirsty like me, here is some pity with some self hate\" is definitely the line that captures a lot of intense social media use. But she had us bopping along. While her music can have heartbreaking elements, its her voice that connects it so eloquently. She is another Lolla powerhouse that deserves many many accolades to come, What an incredible show she put on.\n\nMilitarie Gun - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nFaye Webster - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nRAYE - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nBlu DeTiger is a groovy rocking masterpiece. The grooviest basslines in the freaking world, and we were bopping the entire time. When she sang \"Vintage\" we put ourselves right as the star of her music video did, we danced and grooved through the rhythm that she so perfectly delivered.\n\nThere was also the song \"Dangerous Game\" which shows how dangerous she is. What a masterpiece!! \"Call me yoko ono I'll break up the band.\" Girl you could be in a band of your own with your star power alone. What a performer.\n\nLaufey. Queen. Princess. I am \"Bewitched\" as she performed like a crooner truly marveling us with the most elegant voice I have ever heard in my entire life. With songs like \"Fragile\" she was nothing but fragile. She has this Bossa Nova groove, but with such an enchanting voice. If there is anyone who has mastered vocal flexibility, its her. She made us all feel like we were in a disney movie. BEYOND HONORABLE MENTION here. Truly truly grateful she graced the lolla stage!!\n\nBlu DeTiger - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nBlu DeTiger - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nLaufey - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nLaufey - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\n​I've gotttta talk about McKenna Grace. JBTV didn't have a chance to photograph her, but I was there to bring the full scoop.First of all, I adored her prior to knowing she was a musical artist. I know this is her debut, but to know its happening at Lolla is truly a gift. The Conjuring, I Tonya, Handmaid's Tale, Annabelle, Fuller House... she is an on screen QUEEN! I wondered what she would sound like, her stage presence, and all the wrappings.\n\nImmediately the first thing that stood out to me was her voice. The way she commanded the mic, her pop sound, her dominance on stage coupled with her lyrics. Her single \"Swim Team\" is an instant hit that I will be putting on a playlist right next to Haylee Williams. Be sure to check that out along with \"LOSER!!\" and she is the furthest from that.\n\nHer acting chops is really what pays off here, and not because she is pretending. None of this was fake in the slightest. It is her ability to connect emotionally to the song and audience that will keep people coming back for more. For a start of a music career, she is off to a POWERFUL start. And its not easy making the transition from acting to music, and vice versa. But she is going to create the masterclass on this.\n\nI wonder which one she wanted to do first? Either way, I cannot wait to see her headline one day.\n\n​Until tomorrow, and we'll try and sleep through the excitement tonight. Still pinching myself after today. Lets keep it rockin! - JBTV Music Television\n\nLollapalooza 2024, Bobby Talamine, Fiza Javid, JBTV Music Television, Grant Park, Sza, Sexyy Red, PawPaw Rod, Brandi Cyrus, McKenna Grace, Stray Kids Zedd, Perry Farrell\n\nWriting and Editing by Fiza Javid\n\nPhotography by Bobby Talamine\n\nGrant Park - Thursday August 1, 2024\n\nLets gooooo Lollapalooza 2024!\n\nThe streets were lined up with impending Chappel Roan fans ready to camp out.\n\nWhile the potential for thunderstorms loomed, there was no intention for it to rain on any parade.\n\nAnyone ready to go to Chicago's Lollapalooza, which might very well be on the top 3 list of Lollapalooza festivals happening this summer, knows to prepare with a pair of throwaway shoes and a bathing suit under their clothes.\n\nI pretty much did that, only to be graced as everyone by the heat and entirely lack of rain to actually hit us.\n\nThere was so much hospitality in the crowd with festival-goers carrying spray bottles, getting snacks at the Lolla-Bodega and preparing like all hell for any hell-ish heat.\n\nIt did get hot in therrre, but no one took off all their clothes.\n\nAnyways, the highlights were astronomical: Chappell Roan, Tyla, Brandi Cyrus, Been Stellar, Kesha, Saint Levant, and Hozier. Beyond stoked!\n\nFirst up, gotta cover the headliner Hozier.\n\nHozier, tireless, timeless, endless classic, and a damn near spiritual awakening.\n\nThey debuted their new song \"Nobody's Soldier\" exclusively for the Lolla audience, and it was like I was listening to one of my favorites that is on the list to show my children.\n\nThe way his vocal prowess commands the stage, Andrew sings like he doesn't know that his is on a top 5 vocal list of nearly every inspired musician and fan.\n\nSongs like \"Movement\" and \"Take me to Church\" are ofcourse on everyone's list, but \"Jackie and Wilson\" carries an all American air to it (yes I know he is from Ireland), but the feel of this song is everything good about being in the country side. He is so wholesome and the set was a 10/10 masterpiece.\n\nHozier - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nHozier - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nHozier - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nCHAPPELL ROAN. I'm sorry, you had to be there. H.O.T.T.O.G.O., is an understatement of who she was ofcourse, as she came in like fire, powering through the stage like dynamite.\n\nI've never seen a crowd of what felt like 50,000 people dance along like that. It was like witnessing live worship, but if the goddess is doing splits and singing dynamtically.\n\nShe has Lady Gaga level starpower.\n\nIts not to say her and Kesha should ever be compared, but it is a testament that Kesha even loved her so much that she was willing to trade stages with her. They both were equal parts dynamic.\n\nChappell Roan's rapid success should not be underestimated, and her performance, while had the costumes, the body builders and dancers to show for it, was a perfectly sculpted headline act, and not a circus.\n\nOther incredible songs were \"Feminomenon\" and \"Kink is My Karma\" (check out those videos please), and her ability to go from powerhouse physical performer to singing beautiful melodic scales it truly a FEAT.\n\nTYLA!!\n\nRight before Chappell Roan, was not an easy task, but boy she was stunning.\n\nThere was a giant tiger on stage that she stood on the stage setup of. To see Amapiano music on the main stage, her smooth like butter dance moves, and songs like \"Truth or Dare\" and \"Water\", anyone new to her music like I was, was truly locked in. She is going to reach Rihanna level status.\n\nChappell Roan - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nChappell Roan - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nChappell Roan - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nTyla - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nTyla - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nFrom Gaza with love. Lover boy from Levant. The one and only SAINT LEVANT.\n\nWhile a music festival isn't the typical place to find anyone discussing the ongoing world issues, Marwan of Saint Levant wasn't just a reminder of the horrors taking place and how we should not look away, but that this is a homeland, A culture. A people. Traditions. Dance. MUSIC.\n\nWe were right at home as he serenaded us in the audience, but also showcased his genuine love for who he is. Not only does Gaza have a right to live, but right to thrive and be celebrated by Marwan and everyone he represents.\n\nOn the Bacardi stage, he performed the songs off his new album DEIRA, aptly named after the hotel his father owned in Gaza that was destroyed by IOF.\n\nSongs like \"On this Land,\" my personal favorite, \"Nails,\" \"5am in Paris.\" Saint Levant truly takes multi-talented to a global level. It is NOT easy to go from singing in French to English to Arabic, but there he was wooing us in three different languages. And he plays sax?\n\nGrowing up, he spoke French at home, Arabic in Gaza, and English at school. He also has a new song with incredible rapper MC Abdul, who also hails from Gaza as a 15 year old with 1.9 million followers.\n\nThe crowd danced their heart out, sang along, and we all chanted in protest after he left the stage.\n\nThe Palestine flag and Keffiyehs were covering the crowd and the pride and joy was absolutely a beautiful thing to witness on these festival grounds. Saint Levant. LOOK OUT, he is one to remember forever. What a beautiful soul and a talented rapper and multilinguist.\n\nKESHA!! Woke up in the morning feeling like.... KESHA. Because she was ready to hit the city of Chicago and she absolutely gave us a show to remember as well.\n\nFrom \"Tik ToK\" with an edited lyric to \"Freedom\" to \"Die Young.\" We were screaming messes. She brought all the mothering sass with the \"B*ITCH\" bag with her dancers embracing her.\n\n​I want to go back for more.\n\nSaint Levant - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nSaint Levant - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nKesha - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nKesha - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nBrandi Cyrus and Been Stellar:\n\nBrandi brought that incredible Cyrus energy post Camden Cox's first set of the day (yes Camden ALSO went on prior to Hozier but at the Tito's stage.. what tenacity and stage presence!)\n\nand Cyrus was electric. She has the natural charisma that put her in a league of her own, along with the star power.\n\nKicking off Lollapalooza is no easy feat, but her effortless DJ process, the vibes were just right.\n\nBeen Stellar rocked the stage jamming up with a tambourine and pure energy to give. Just like when Taipei Houston rocked out at Lollapalooza, they were also nothing short of stellar.\n\nIts refreshing to come across new alt-rock bands, and for a band in the genre to not sound like anything that has come before, but Been Stellar is effortless in their musical process. Low maintenence look, but able to take on a bigger stage. This set almost felt underground and like a hidden secret. ​\n\nBrandi Cyrus - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nCrowd during Brandi Cyrus - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nBeen Stellar - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nBeen Stellar - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nCheers to an incredible day one. Until tomorrow - JBTV Music Television\n\nLollapalooza 2024, Bobby Talamine, Fiza Javid, JBTV Music Television, Grant Park, Kesha, Been Stellar, Brandi Cyrus, Saint Levant, Hozier, Megan Thee Stallion, Perry Farrell\n\nBrittany Howard - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nWriting and Photography by Bobby Talamine\n\nEdited by Fiza Javid\n\nUnion Park Chicago\n\nSunday - July 21, 2024\n\nPitchfork Music Festival-\n\nAll three days-\n\nJust such a splendid time, with memorable performances throughout, followed by a wonderful vibe throughout while on the Pitchfork grounds.\n\nSunday's lineup- A wide mix of cast and characters.\n\nBrittany Howard- Just so transfixing and uplifting (Including her interview earlier in the afternoon).\n\nModel/ Actriz- That was a show folks.\n\nThe kinda performance you'll never forget- either you were there in the mix, or you weren't.\n\nBut man oh man- Cole Haden- vocalist extraordinaire for Model/ Actriz- now I understand why he's everyone's favorite performer- onstage theatricality followed by a boatload of charisma followed by a guy who knows how to mix it up on the grounds at the front of the stage, both east and west along the middle rail, let alone the red carpet runway walk through the middle rail towards me, eye contact with me intact.\n\n(More on that a bit later in the review).\n\nHow about Mannequin Pussy and particularly Missy Dabice on guitar and vocals?\n\nThat photo pit- PACKED.\n\nAnd how about Grandmaster Flash and his definitive call and response throughout his set?\n\n\"Quick Mix Theory?\" Which he's ever so known for? Talk about a guy who still knows how to read a room, or a crowd.\n\nThe list goes on from there of course- standouts all- however this is the start of starts.\n\nWeather- outside of occasionally hot with the sun beating down...but still- perfect.\n\nBrittany Howard- Just such joy. Immense amounts- boatload amounts of Joy.\n\nThat she takes deep dives into so many styles of music, all with spiritual uplift...the kinda performance you just don't want to end..just go and go, and go some more.\n\nEverything from psyche out jazz, followed by some serious soul, followed by sophisticated funk.\n\nBrittany knows, and feels it all.\n\nI can go on with the superlatives- and all of it well meaning review wise, and from the heart.\n\nBut her set was needed man- especially the earlier in the day announcement in regards to Joe Biden, and dropping out of the Presidential Race.\n\nA lot going through your head from early afternoon, and trying to accept things, settle in, get back to the music.\n\nSo yeah- a set like that from Brittany Howard, offering up a slew of songs from her critically acclaimed latest release \"What Now\", and opening up her set with \"Earth Song\"..soak in the vibe and the gentleness of it all please....delicate ambience now has a permission to enter, and to entertain.\n\nHonest fragments of feelings permeate her set, backed by a band who know things about push and pull, laying out the groundwork of confidence to let Brittany to shine, and shine some more.\n\nBrittany Howard - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nBrittany Howard - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nBrittany Howard - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nBrittany Howard - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nAs for Model/ Actriz- also sorely needed.\n\nThe tension just builds and builds throughout the first two songs of their set, particularly with lead singer Cole Haden, even when calmly coming out from stage left, and applying his lipstick. Followed by slow sashays stage left to stage right, twirling his pocket purse on a chain, let alone the microphone stand, let alone his wicked leg kicks.\n\nLike you think everything could possibly be a weapon, so watch out.\n\nBy song three- Cole is off stage, into the pit, down the main rail runway, and into the crowd, both the east side and the west side.\n\nAnd mixing it up, followed by mixing it up some more.\n\nAnd a microphone cord which stays intact, which by the looks of things could be like a one hundred yards long, handheld by everybody including security, all in support to keep Cole focused on the angst and wickedness, even at like 3:30 in the mid afternoon, with the blazing sun beating down on you- on everybody.\n\nSo yeah- during song three, I'm a bit soaked like Cole.\n\nThis is some serious shit that needs to be documented, mixing it up in the crowd, equal to what Cole is unpredictably doing.\n\nThat's the key takeaway, the key element of it all- NOTHING SCRIPTED.\n\nSure, it's downright fun- but the unpredictability of it all, both east and west of the rail- Cole knows how to read a crowd, and provoke provoke provoke, with a mindset based on danger, and also letting loose.\n\nThat the band Model/ Actriz are still up onstage and their elements of surprises certainly ups the ante in attitude, with Cole roaming the crowd.\n\nThis band-\n\nThe highlight of Day Three, up there with Brittany Howard.\n\nAgain- both of them....Brittany Howard and Model/ Acrtiz- just so damn memorable.\n\nAnd the entire day of Day Three has it's moments, with Mannequin Pussy laying the ground of carpet bombs form the Blue Stage, ready willing and able to provide forthright indie slash punk rock attitude, including fashionista by way of wicked clothing options to show their standoff and draw your line in the sand appeal.\n\nModel/Actriz -

Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nBut right before- definitely the performance of the day / late afternoon-\n\nThe goddess Jessie Ware.\n\n​Of the triumvirate undercard headlining \"DANCE\"- the award goes to Jessie Ware.\n\nThat was a Vegas show I tell ya- with more Vegas on top of Vegas.\n\nBut not dialed in- personal attitude required for a festival setting such as Pitchfork, all the while reminding everyone the joys of the city of Chicago, which she obviously adores.\n\nJessie Ware was having a damn good time, with no letup whatsoever, utilizing her dancers, her backing band, her backup singers as one big gigantic family, from opener \"That! Feels Good!\", all the while fearless in the sexy.\n\nI mean sexy sexy sexy, with an all encompassing retro mood, with such cool and glossy pop songs.\n\nSuch a commanding vocal attack throughout her set, even down to an awe inspiring rendition of Cher's \"Believe\", with literally everybody, I mean everybody all the way to the back- like a 100 yards from the stage swinging along to the dance party.\n\nI mean, how do you top that?\n\nHow do you even follow that?\n\nSo she starts her set on time, but it's a little after 6pm in the early evening, with the sun still out, the entire time, hitting the west facing Green Stage.\n\nAnd this is one big gigantic party at Pitchfork- no letup in sight.\n\nI kept imagining- what if this was Jessie headlining, like after the sun goes down, and you have \"Bada Badass Boom!\" kinda lighting and sexy theatrics?\n\nPitchfork in my opinion, would never be the same.\n\nJust constant mirror ball lit songs throughout her set, emphasis on solid choreography and with a vocal attack with no letup.\n\nYes- Jessie Ware was a transformative and oh so memorable experience.\n\nOh you guys in De La Soul- a fun art rap party- chill, yes, but with a lot of crowd interaction push and pull, brought to you by the two surviving members- Posdnuos and of course Maseo.\n\nSuch cool guys- the kinda rap that you can dance to- an arty and witty vibe, with positive attitude and originality, nothing fake, nothing dialed in.\n\nWater from Your Eyes, a band that has the feel of keeping you at arm's length, and yet provide some tight interplay, although dialed down- nothing jagged, in regards to their brand of indie/ alternative.\n\nSame with Feeble Little Horse- but the delay between songs in their set just lessened the overall mood and energy from the crowd, although still enthusiastic, don't get me wrong, but still, this band has some serious tight energy when performing- just wished the energy flow wasn't diminished with awkward breaks between.\n\nHotline TNT- a band with the what the fucks- that being they don't look the part with this kind of serious and jagged songwriting.\n\nA great set with emphasis on serious noise, with solid melody and a bit of disjointed angst.\n\nL'Rain- concentrating on delicate and complex chill, with a backing band with power, if needed.\n\nHer set was riveting, even at 2:30 in the afternoon, her dreamscapes setting a mood of tranquil thought and solid harmonies.\n\nAnd then leading to all things Lifeguard- a local Chicago trio making some serious waves and critical acclaim, especially important considering how young they are.\n\nTheir set- opening day Two of Pitchfork believe it or not- one of the main highlights from Day Two for me.\n\nJust intriguing and high energy singing and songwriting- brazen hooks throughout, wise beyond their years.\n\nHotline TNT - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nL'Rain - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nLifeguard - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nSuch was the showcase of Saturday at Pitchfork- memorable- just so damn memorable.\n\nHope my photography reflects that.\n\n​\n\nBobby Talamine- JBTV Music Television Chicago\n\nJamie xx, Pitchfork Music Festival, JBTV Music Television, Chicago, Bobby Talamine, Fiza Javid, Carly Rae Jepsen, Jessie Ware, De La Soul, Lifeguard, Feeble Little Horse, L'Rain\n\nEric Burton of Black Pumas - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nWriting and Photography by Bobby Talamine\n\nEdited by Fiza Javid\n\nUnion Park\n\nFriday - July 19, 2024\n\nPitchfork Music Festival for 2024: The overall vibe and feel- relaxing. Chill.\n\nFrom when the gates opened at noon, to around 3 pm- just damn fun, leading up to the Day One headliner- Black Pumas.\n\nAlthough at times a bit hot outside, with direct sunlight, no clouds.\n\nThe chance of rain for all three days- minimal to none.\n\nThe perfect backdrop for this unique music festival, with a wide assortment of acts to pick and choose from, which is always the case for Day One at Pitchfork- everything from indie instrumentals (Black Duck), to renegade rap (Angry Blackmen), to indie electronica (ML Buch)- and the list goes on from there, covering even more genres up to the headliner.\n\n​\n\nAs for the headliner, that being Black Pumas- still worthy of your attention, even though it seems they play here in Chicago what seems like on repeat- the last stop in Chicago being back in January at the Salt Shed, for a multiple night residency.\n\nStill compelling, still full of energy, especially through lead singer Eric Burton, who has \"Entertain\" in his DNA.\n\nThe songs- dynamic, and captivating, made even more so in an outdoor festival setting, with a crowd eager to dance along to the singalongs.\n\nPlenty of that with a performer such as Burton, who wheels and deals from the main stage with occasional forays into the pit and along the rails to engage with his audience, and take a few moments to let everything sink in- audience to stage- sometimes as a fan of his own band looking forward to the stage, and what he's created with Adrian Quesada.\n\nAs always, co-founder Adrian Quesada remains chill and steadfast on the main stage, with guitar parts and songwriting that push and compel the audience to take part with shared vocal, with starry eyed soul front and center, made even more so with a whipsmart backing band embracing all things frenetic and electric energy.\n\nAlways with these guys, their performance seems like they're over in a flash- their musicianship just so solid throughout- making time just whiz on by.\n\nJust a splendid time to start the Festival, with a solid band to headline Day One.\n\nOpening on Friday- Black Duck, who know a thing or two with instrumental this, instrumental that- compelling improv being front and center. That they're local as well, with a solid pedigree in musicianship from serious bands, such as Tortoise and also Eleventh Dream Day, which should tell you lots.\n\nPerforming live- slathered and polished improv- made even more so.​\n\nEric Burton of Black Pumas - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nBlack Pumas - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nBlack Pumas - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nAnd then Angry Blackmen.\n\nWhich are- downright Angry Blackmen.\n\nLocal dudes who make hip hop with fervent energy, and a strong message to boot.\n\nThey started off kinda slow, but picked up steam as their set went along, all the way to mixing it up on the grounds at the front of the stage, ever eager to bring the message with in your face (literally) and sharing in communal mosh and angst.\n\nOne of the memorable highlights from Day One, with Angry Blackmen.\n\nThen enter composer ML Buch, who transcends all things \"Chill\", but done with class, all things electronica.\n\nAnd again, we're all over the map music wise, followed by Tkay Maidza, a Zimbabwean born singer/ songwriter rapper, but with a gentle and sexy vibe to lay down some grooves in the middle of the afternoon on a bright summer day.\n\nBopping around everywhere, taking it all in, even with Doss, a sophisticated electronic DJ, who knows a thing or two with complicated and yet catchy beats.\n\nAngry Blackmen - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nAngry Blackmen - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nTkay Maidza - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nAnd of course, another highlight from Day One, with American singer and DJ Yaeji, who is a firebrand, that's for sure, mixing house music and hip hop with some serious and catchy dance moves, made even more so with her two backup dancers, who are solid in elevating the set to a higher level of theatrical dance- a perfect encapsulation of her sounds and structure.\n\nDylan Brady and Laura Les- better known as 100 gecs- Hyper Pop ambassadors alright, even though stage costumes are dialed down this time around- simple setup and overall feel, not much fanfare and outlandishness like I've seen before- but ever evident in songs that pack a wallop.\n\nAnd their fanbase- their audience- screams of hyper kinetic energy throughout their set.\n\nBritish musician Jai Paul- so looking forward to his set, since he rarely tours and performs.\n\nAnd his set- although dialed down a bit- didn't disappoint.\n\nHe has an elegant state of grace, that's for sure, a sophistication that doesn't need over the top bells and whistles- just some solid backing musicians with elegant songs that matter.\n\n​\n\nAnd then there's Jeff Rosenstock, who brings the angst, the pent up energy needed to balance the whole day out prior to Black Pumas hitting the stage.\n\nGuess what- fun and catchy punk anthems are the order of the day- opening with a tape from System of a Down, the song \"Chop Suey\", the crowd eating it up, followed by Jeff Rosenstock finishing off the song live- punk n' roll style.\n\nDJ Yaeji - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nJeff Rosenstock - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nThat should tell you lots- this band rife with anxiety and uncomfortable this- uncomfortable that.\n\nAnd so goes all things Pitchfork Day One- a slice and dice foray into musical genres of all shapes and sizes, just like you'd expect from them to get the ball rolling into days two and three.\n\nBottom line- memorable and damn fun!\n\nBobby Talamine -

Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nWriting and Photography by Bobby Talamine\n\nEdited by Fiza Javid\n\nThe Salt Shed Chicago\n\nFriday - June 28, 2024\n\nQuite a packed lineup on a Friday night at The Shed- six bands- six bands with somewhat different styles, but still, emotion (EMO) is linked throughout.\n\nHawthorne Heights in particular, from Dayton Ohio, with links to Chicago through Victory Records, which helped solidify their sound and pedigree with their first three albums.\n\nI make note of this, because JT Woodruff made note of it during their set as well, and the joy of playing in Chicago, remembering where they came from and started out back in 2001.\n\n​Nothing like some post hardcore music, mixed with EMO and lots of angst, playing anywhere humanly possible when you're starting out, just playing and playing and playing, with pop up events through word of mouth, developing a following, knowing in your gut that this matters, that it's in your genes.\n\nBands like Hawthorne Heights, up to the present day, even though the stages and venues have gotten bigger and bigger- they still haven't lost that pedigree, that bit of looseness, realizing with hard work, a bit of luck, overcoming misfortunes, that all of this- recording to playing, is just so damn special.\n\nQuite a few photographers in the pit for the headliner, with one old guy- that being me.\n\nMaybe JT noticed me because I have silver hair, look a bit like his dad or grandpa- who knows, compared with the other photographers roaming around.\n\nI tend to smile a lot when photographing bands, bands with lots of energy, with the songs to match.\n\nI do roam the pit, don't get me wrong, full band photos being essential- but still, love making use of the time allotted.\n\nJT- happened to catch him quite a few times in performance pose, hamming it up a bit, me giving him thumbs up and such, with smiles and eye contact as well.\n\nSo the leg kicks, the eye contact- that is ever evident in some of the pics.\n\nI bring all this up because music matters.\n\nPhotography follows.\n\nSo that kind of energy from a band like Hawthorne Heights- I want to reciprocate somewhat- age be damned.\n\nI think JT took note of that- I could be wrong- maybe he was wondering who was the old guy in the pit- who knows.\n\nEither way, I don't care.\n\nHawthorne Heights - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nHawthorne Heights - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nHawthorne Heights - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nHawthorne Heights - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nI just want damn good live photos conveying the energy from within.\n\nI dig this band, now a four piece since the untimely death of Casey Calvert back in 2007, and how they've carried on since, knowing full well that Casey was a no bullshit kinda guy, and in spirit- \"Hey you four knuckleheads- don't let go of this- this is too damn special beyond just one guy\".\n\nAlthough I'm not in on that whatsoever- but you kinda feel that the spirit of Casey pushed them to continue, proceed with angst, proceed honestly, and don't forget the screams.\n\nAnd to the present day they produce killer choruses, followed by crafty melodies and anthems that make you rev things up for a bit.\n\nThat the band still continues to release albums showing their range and skills, and deliver the thunder when necessary, speaks volumes.\n\nEven with a simple stage setup, emphasis on the bright backdrop, with \"20 Years of Tears\" most prominent, \"The Silence in Black and White\" displayed prominently towards the bottom of their backdrop, left and right.\n\nAnd just their gear on the stage, with some cool and bright vertical tube lighting.\n\nA refreshing and open and inviting stage, with room to roam for the guys.\n\nTheir set- some 13 songs total- opening with \"Life on Standby\", into \"Dissolve and Decay\".\n\nThe fun continues, all the way to their anthem of anthems- \"Ohio Is for Lovers\".\n\nLike most of the night, their set was done before you know it.\n\nCool that they brought along some bands that pack a wallop, such as I See Stars, who trailblazed through their set, amping up everything throughout, body surfers by the dozens, followed by mosh pits front and center.\n\nAnberlin had some mishaps unfortunately, all audio and mic related, shortening their set, with Matty Mullins of Memphis May Fire taking over for lead vocals- And even though the songs attempted had some serious energy- It was just so oddball how they attempted to overcome the wrongs- leading to a shortened set that pissed off a few band members.\n\nAs for Armor for Sleep- edgy energy, with nothing cheesy or dialed in- guitar runs front and center.\n\nEmery as well packs a punch, even with a half hour set allotted- making use of full band, duo lead vocals on occasion, and some electronic samples and beats thrown into the mix as well.\n\nAnd of course things started off dialed down a bit, with the acoustic duo of This Wild Life, bringing their mix of lightheartedness to the night, but still with honest energy.\n\n​\n\nAll n' all, six unique bands that want to go out on the road and have a party- such was the vibe from The Salt Shed in Chicago.\n\nBobby Talamine- JBTV Music Television Chicago\n\nThe Wild Life -

June 7, 2024\n\nSo lucky to have Chicago in the itinerary for this short tour with Miki Berenyi, along with openers Lol Tolhurst and Budgie-\n\nOnly eight stops total, since May 29th, with not much of a breather between dates.\n\nZip zip zoom and gone, with apparently a post on Facebook stating that she's looking forward to returning in 2025.\n\nFor a three piece, consisting of Miki on twelve string guitar, along with Oliver Cherer on guitar, and lastly Mick Conroy on bass.\n\nThe missing element would be Moose, who was not involved in the US tour because of the anxiety of flying along with environmental concerns.\n\nSuch delicate overtones throughout their 19 song set, with of course lots of Lush covers, opening with \"Stray\", form their debut album back in 1992- \"Spooky\"- wistful musings and reverberated guitars still intact.\n\nFollowed by other Lush nuggets, such as \"Leaves Me Cold\", and further on down the line with \"Covert\", \"Kiss Chase\", and of course \"For Love\", amongst others.\n\nInterspersed with Piroshka covers and of course a Moose cover in \"Suzanne\", and lastly some Miki Berenyi Trio songs, highlighted by their single release in \"Vertigo\", which fits in ever so nicely into the overall mood of the set.\n\nThis version of the Trio, by this time in Chicago and seven dates into the tour, in my opinion gelling along nicely, even without the use of a live drummer.\n\nWhat that means is intricate and dreamy guitars dominate, although drum patterns are evident in the mix of backing tracks, just not energized into a live band feel.\n\nMy opinion that dials down on the energy from the crowd at the Bottom Lounge, still enthusiastic, don't get me wrong, happy to be in Miki's presence with all things \"Lush this, Lush that\".\n\nBut by intimate club standards, a more hushed crowd, subdued to hear the delicate vocal washes from Miki. let alone the intricate guitar overlays.\n\nAnd so their set was like this throughout, ending with another Lush cover- \"Baby Talk\"- from their mini- album \"Scar\", in 1989.\n\n\"Scar\" from back in the day....such a splendid affair, a work of art for the band Lush, setting the stage for bigger things to come.\n\nAnd to the present day, with this trio, Vertigo being ever evident in the overall mood of the evening- emphasis on mood and melody, mood and melody.\n\nAnd all of this is cool by any standard- better even in my opinion, enhanced because of the intimate club setting.\n\nThe Miki Berenyi Trio -

Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nA larger venue- would have downplayed the mood and chatter form the crowd, with distractions complicating everything for the avid listener.\n\nAnd that's what it is- music hounds and avid listeners, excited to see how Miki presents this trio format live, new songs prepped with older songs.\n\nJust a remarkable and captivating evening, made even more so with openers Lol Tolhurst and Budgie in support, having a blast with their eight song set, with all things \"Los Angeles\"- their collaborative studio album, which was released back in November of '23.\n\nThe songs- approached differently than Miki's Trio format- the obvious being two accomplished live drummers, and yet no singers present, as the album suggests.\n\nThe drumming- the electronic drumming- nary a problem, especially with the lighthearted all in fun showmanship from Budgie.\n\nThese songs from \"los Angeles\"- packed with punch,\n\nA worthy listen or two, with the likes of James Murphy from LCD Soundsystem, or let alone Bobby Gillespie letting out some angst and discord in \"This Is What It Is (To Be Free)\" in particular.\n\nBut live, without the main vocals, just samples thereof...just so soft and buried unfortunately.\n\nYou can tell by the crowd immediately.\n\nThey're digging it, that's a given- but five songs in, by the time of \"Uh, Oh\"- it's like they want more.\n\nThey get it, sort of, towards the end of their set, with \"A Forest\", a mighty Cure cover, but even that is somewhat subdued, even the female vocal parts are like whispers- but still....that damn song captivates, even with Lol out front and center, with the electronic drum stand as his main constant.\n\nThen ending with \"Skins\", which is the most energized song of the night.\n\nHad the vocal sampled elements been more amped into the mix- my opinion, this would've been a party with these two- crowd bouncing around and dancing in place, even with extended versions of the songs, just to get into a sweaty mood.\n\n​\n\n\"Los Angeles\", with Lol and Budgie- thrilling and riveting stuff.\n\nIt deserved so much more when performed live.\n\nBut overall- Miki Berenyi's Trio, along with Lol and Budgie performing in an intimate venue such as The Bottom Lounge- you can't beat that.\n\nHere's to seeing everyone again in 2025, hopefully.\n\nBobby Talamine -

Sunday, June 2, 2024\n\nThe Damned.\n\nThe mighty Damned.\n\nIn full force- with their classic 80's lineup:\n\nCaptain Sensible\n\nDave Vanian\n\nRat Scabies\n\nPaul Gray.\n\nAnd talk about a setlist-\n\nHeavy on the heavy hitters, encompassing lots and lots from albums such as \"Strawberries\"('82), \"Machine Gun Etiquette\"('79), \"The Black Album\"('80), and of course their debut- \"Damned Damned Damned\", from '77, along with some nuggets from \"Phantasmagoria\" ('85), with a smattering of others thrown in for good measure.\n\nSo yeah- this setlist, this solid band, also along with Monty Oxymoron on all things keyboards- doesn't matter the size of the venue apparently, doesn't matter if it's an outdoor festival, doesn't matter if they're playing on a Sunday for crying out loud.\n\nThe show was incendiary, with an open book for a sense of humor, lots of fun and also the key element of camaraderie between bandmates.\n\nOlder and lots wiser, these guys.\n\nWhich certainly helps.\n\nAlong with rehearsals, which by the looks of things, they spent some serious time on.\n\nCan't think of one fault with their set whatsoever.\n\nPaul Gray on bass- he was in fine form, handling the low end with that Rickenbacker bass of his- all bright fire engine red and ready to go.\n\nTo have him in the fold, along with Rat Scabies on the drums- the definition of a mighty fine rhythm section I tell ya.\n\nAs for Captain and Dave- holding down their own throughout, occasionally reaching out with arms, winks and smiles between the two of them.\n\nThat's the cool thing with up close pit photography, and photographing bands you've grown up with- bands you cherish and love and support.\n\nYou see that kinda thing up close, regularly, and you feel good, just like them.\n\nNo bad and negative energy.\n\nThe Dictators -

The Damned were ON FIRE last night, they are the best they have ever been, I am SURE they curated the setlist with me in mind!\"\n\nI think that sums it up nicely.\n\nAs for The Dictators who opened the show-\n\nEven with just two main members remaining, that being Ross \"The Boss\" Friedman on guitars, and Andy Shernoff on bass- with added punch on the drums with Albert Bouchard (original member of Blue Oyster Cult)- have to say that they had a solid set as well.\n\nKeith Roth on lead vocals and guitar provided the necessary swagger and added punch to bring the songs to life.\n\n​\n\nHave to say it couldn't be easy for them, figuring your way through things with a diluted original personnel hanging over your heads.\n\nCertainly the packed crowd on the main floor ate it up, dancing and pogoing in place.\n\nNothing came off fake or dialed in throughout their set.\n\nFor their allotted time- one word- polished.\n\nSo yeah, like Chris said getting back to The Damned.....\n\nBobby Talamine -

Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nWriting and Photography by Bobby Talamine\n\nEdited by Fiza Javid\n\n3 Floyds Brewing - Munster, Indiana\n\nSaturday May 18, 2024\n\nTalk about a well run metal festival.\n\nAn A Plus as far as logistics, such as getting into the festival, let alone leaving, along with overall layout and feel.\n\nI don't say this lightly, especially how some metal festivals I've been to in similar size are more cramped, with not many areas to chill, and especially for the summer months, areas to find shade when things get hot and sweaty.\n\nBut we're talking all things metal, so you have to expect some of those things no matter what- metal being \"Metal\".\n\nYes, 3 Floyds Brewing has been making this an annual \"Go To\" event since 2004, so they've been able to adapt accordingly, tweak things, make this a more memorable metal festival in relation to celebrating all things \"Dark Lord\"- 3 Floyds famous Russian Imperial Stout, let alone exclusive yearly event offerings, such as limited edition and uniques art prints, let alone varieties of and variants of certain brews.\n\nAnd the fans- they come in from all over, especially from overseas.\n\nWhile traversing the grounds, taking things all in besides the main music stage- I met people from Belgium, from Germany, all the Scandinavian countries you can think of, let alone Latin America.\n\nI mean from all over.\n\nBy the looks of things, people definitely arrived super early to claim the main bench tables at the huge beer tent- I mean rows and rows and rows of benches that had bottles upon bottles of a wide variety of beers- what looked like to infinity.\n\nAnd no one was moving out of their space, even for the bands.\n\nAnd overall just so celebratory, and super friendly.\n\nThe vibe was that way no matter where I went to get proper pictures of the festival, and the goings on.\n\nYou have to give credit to the 3 Floyds staff, their management and ownership, let alone the production crew for the bands at the main music stage, and also the hospitality.\n\nWay above board, in all aspects.\n\nAs with most music festivals of this size, there's bound to be hiccups- and getting a proper crew together to pivot accordingly is key, to do your best to keep things on track in regards to set times, let alone curfews.\n\nThe main issue from my vantage point was with the set changes the band 1349 into Fugitive, and two main floor wedges not working properly, let alone lead guitar cables crackling into the same wedges.\n\nAnd when things are kinda on a tight schedule set wise and band wise, it takes time to replace all of the above, and getting them to work properly, knowing full well that shit happens.\n\nKudos to the production team in getting things worked out, and back on track, even if it means cutting some set times down a bit to accommodate the timing of it all.\n\nHigh on Fire - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nHigh on Fire - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nHigh on Fire - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nAbbath - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nAbbath - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\n1349 - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nFugitive - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nSpirit World - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nHave been photographing festivals of all kinds for decades now, and have seen the bottomless pit of disturbances that can derail a show such as this, with tempers flying from the higher ups, then circulating down to the actual crew setting up shop.\n\nAgain- shit happens.\n\nIt's inevitable.\n\nBut the fun and experience of it all, at least for me, is watching crews work, getting to know them a bit, and seeing how they pivot to solve problems, from front of house to back of house, and making sure not to get in their way, but also to be supportive.\n\nSo it goes without saying, before even discussing anything artist and band related, that 3 Floyds know what they're doing, and doing their best to make this weekend in May such a special event, known worldwide.\n\nAnd as for the bands, starting with headliner High On Fire, courtesy of the one and only Matt Pike- He's just as renegade as ever, brandishing crack the whip guitar riffs with nary a break in sweat, uprooted with gnarly and gutteral howls to try to outmatch his super sludgy notes, followed by a rhythm section that knows how to stay afoot of said notes and produce the concrete block pounding, courtesy of Jeff Matz on bass, and Coady Willis on drums.\n\nNot much fanfare needed as well in regards to signage, let alone anything special effects related- just plug in and play kinda guys.\n\nBut again, with 3 Floyds and budgeting for a festival of this type- that PA they brought in....talk about packing a mighty wallop- from subwoofers to floor stacks- that was sternum punch amazing.\n\nLet alone the sophisticated lighting for the stage.\n\nThe enhancement of all this does not go unnoticed- Matt Pike was side stage off and on most of the afternoon, taking in the bands in support, let alone getting a feel of the backstage and how things are handled, and also soaking in the vibes from the stage looking out to the main floor in the gigantic stage tent.\n\nLoved how he shared his thoughts, saying time and time again how much he digs Dark Lord Day, and wanting to play here.\n\nBut High On Fire's set- just so blistering and punishing, teeth rattling awesome.\n\nSame with Abbath, and all things Abbath Doom Oculta.\n\nAnd Abbath strikes me as the kinda guy that prefers to play when the sun is down, not when the sun is up.\n\nNo matter- not much idol chat before he hits the stage with his band- from the coach to the stage- play your heart out- from the stage back to the coach- in the need of air conditioning.\n\nAbbath- poor guy- he was sweating bullets thirty seconds into the first song- \"Acid Haze\".\n\nAbbath- he's the real deal- heavy corpse paint as always, followed by sinister and heavy chest armor, followed by lots of thick black leather, and also knee high and sinister black boots.\n\nSo yeah- eighty degree heat, followed by intense stage presence, followed by that gigantic PA pounding, and ultra heavy red strobe lighting- Abbath brings an inferno to an inferno.\n\nAmazing when you think of it- nothing changes for these guys, sun up, or late at night.\n\nAbbath brings the bludgeoning, and then some, occasionally cracking a wicked smile through the heavy sweat.\n\nAs for the boys of Fugitive- Hardcore as hardcore gets, with songs such as \"Blast Furnace\" which is well - a blast furnace.\n\nNot much coaxing needed, especially for that song in particular, however when main vocalist Seth Gilmore wants a mosh pit for that song- the faithful oblige.\n\nAnd it was huge.\n\nLeft the pit to document that, right along the edge of the mosh, and into the eye of the storm.\n\nHow else to document that equal to the punishment of the band?\n\nAnd yes, I paid a price- got walloped in the back and forced forward, but all well and good.\n\nDoesn't matter if I got a bit of a beating- mosh pits ad to the excitement of it all- risk taking is part of the deal, especially with a band like Fugitive in the middle of a hot and sweaty afternoon.\n\nSame with the Norwegian Black Metal band 1349- who at around 3:30 in the afternoon provided a pounding of their own, just oh so nasty and harsh riffs throughout, and a stage presence heavy on the fog, just to add some more sinister luster.\n\nClouds of doom, in my opinion- great for photography, great for making things feel like you're in an old growth forest north of Oslo while summoning demons to dance.\n\nThey've been around awhile, like since 2003 / 2004- so they know a thing or two in bringing an onslaught of Scandinavian Death to the folks in the midwest.\n\nAs for Spirit World, which went on around 2:30 or so- they bring a party as well, decked out in rhinestone cowboy suits- kinda like hardcore mixed with country punk, if there is such a thing.\n\nDefinitely full on metal electric- but with a gnarly twang that is catchy and barroom brawl kinda worthy in attitude.\n\nThey certainly have boatloads of confidence playing live, immersed in a bit of western horror.\n\nAs for Sybris, couldn't make it in time for their set- the ultra long freight trains off of the Borman Expressway and south on Calumet put a kabash on that.\n\nSo overall- the look, the feel, the overall vibe of all things Dark Lord Day- yeah- just oh so memorable.\n\nThis yearly event, brought to you by 3 Floyds Brewing- a must see, if you haven't seen.\n\nThe kinda event that you have to go back to, putting it on your yearly calendar, up there with all the holidays you have checked off.\n\nBobby Talamine -

Tuesday - May 7, 2024\n\nLots of things definitive of rock shows, especially of the metal kind, that make things memorable.\n\nOne offs, limited short runs of dates, reunions, and on and on.\n\nSpecial, truly special shows, of the magical kind, even before a note is played, and prior amped up energy of the \"I can't wait\" kind- those are rare.\n\nLet alone anything intimate venue related.\n\nMade evident even more so where said band wants to make its debut in the heart of the Midwest, such as Chicago.\n\nGives you chills when you think about it- the kind where you have to arrive a bit early to take it all in, along with your metal brethren faithful, all lined up in their traditional black attire, also feeling the same said excitement.\n\nThat it revolves around a guy such as Kerry King, debuting his solo project \"From Hell I Rise\", at Reggie's in Chicago- well let's just say there's magic in the air, eagerly awaiting entry into all things \"mighty\".\n\nBy the looks of things from the exterior of Reggie's- Not your typical load in for a typical and intimate metal show.\n\nThe semi parked to the north of the venue- the kinda freight that you would see arrive for a larger venue- which tells you lots of things- that this show is gonna be downright special, up to Kerry King standards, minus the typical heavy fire and pyro.\n\nBut excluding that- the lighting- the stage schematic- the fact that Paul Bostaph's drumkit is not on a riser of any sort, that' it's ground level, also says lots.\n\nThis is a full fledged band alright.\n\nA five piece, ready willing and able.\n\nWhat you have:\n\nA fierce and dynamic vocalist in Mark Osegueda, from the band Death Angel.\n\nPhil Demmel on guitars- from Vio-Lence and also Machine Head.\n\nKyle Sanders on bass- from Hellyeah.\n\nAnd of course Paul Bostaph on drums - from Testament, Forbidden , Exodus and of course Slayer.\n\nSo Kerry King has surrounded himself with men that think like him, punishing and unforgiving- elevating the mood in everything.\n\nYou can tell that they've rehearsed a shitload.\n\nNothing seemed out of place whatsoever- however I'm not privy to any band pow wow / huddle after- knowing full well that in accordance to this level of thrash musicianship, mistakes do happen, and there's need to tweak or correct a few things.\n\nTo play at this level of might and fortitude requires serious attention and physical attributes.\n\nThe metal faithful knows this full well.\n\nThat's why the metal faithful are a solid bunch, especially of the rough and tumble Chicago kind.\n\nThe setlist- seventeen songs total, mostly reflecting the solo release from Kerry King- \"From Hell I Rise\", but also punctuated throughout with heavy hitters from the Slayer canon, such as \"Repentless\", \"Hate Worldwide\", \"Chemical Warfare\", amongst others.\n\nBut the crowd was eager to hear the new stuff as well- to see and hear if they deliver.\n\nOh man, do they ever deliver.\n\nEleven new songs in total- all tight, all fierce, all in your face.\n\nOf course we've heard the first single from the long awaited album from back in early February- \"Idle Hands\"- a fast and oh so punishing barn burner of a song- worthy of many repeats.\n\nTo hear \"Idle Hands\" live, which come along as song number eight in the setlist- by this time, a couple of months after its debut- it feels like it's part of the core and family of Slayer- old school, refreshing, full of might and piss and vinegar when played live, with amped up steroid attitude.\n\nMatter of fact, all the songs played \"From Hell I Rise\"- the same feels.\n\nWith so many nuggets and gems to choose from- you leave Reggie's scatterbrained- more so than your typical metal show, simply because the new material is so damn good, and like you've never heard any of this before, everything starts anew, and of course, where the fuck do you go from here.\n\nLook at it this way- The first three songs of the evening- opening with \"Where I Reign\", into \"Toxic\", and then into \"Rage\"- all bangers- from the latest release- unrelenting, concrete block pulverizing.\n\nNow you get the gist of all things Kerry King / solo project.\n\nDefinitive.\n\nExclamation point observatory- throughout.\n\nA five piece with serious bona fides.\n\nThe whole set- level upon next level of brutality, followed by a PA that could whoop your ass, and a tightknit approach to minimal clutter onstage, making the music all things front and center.\n\nDeeply honest, this approach- this fast and concise riffage of thunder with blistering intent.\n\nI know I'm throwing around words that are gushing with praise, more so than usual.\n\nBut it's not like there's a question and answer period after a show like this, with some amount of definitive closure.\n\nI guess in some aspects, that's necessary, all well and good, with lots and lots of questions left unanswered, figure it out yourself and make do.\n\n​\n\nBut I've come into this live review with Kerry King with my head still spinning, finding it hard to decompress, and make some seminal thoughts of what the fuck I just witnessed.\n\nBut damn if the whole night, even prior to the show was downright magical, and just so special.\n\nThis is beautiful and frightful heavy thrash, of the no bullshit kind.\n\nPlayed live- even more so.\n\nAgain- the band is tight.\n\nThe songs are tight.\n\nThe venue- the perfect debut for such a release as this, even on a weekday night.\n\nEasily, easily, one of the best most unforgettable shows of the year.\n\nBobby Talamine -

May 1, 2024\n\nLots of fun.\n\nLots of laughs.\n\nLots of ribbing.\n\nAs a 60th Birthday Celebration should be.\n\nStarting with the tour poster: \"A Primus Circle! A Perfect Puscifer! A Puscifect Primcle!\".\n\nFollowed by what looks like an old school graphic illustration embodying all things campy and yet well worn- \"B- Movie style\".\n\nKinda like a just turned 60 year old, such as Maynard James Keenan, the monthlong tour Birthday Boy.\n\nAlthough he's not alone in the 60 and up society / brotherhood- Les Claypool making that clear from their first foray of four songs in their portion of the set, Act I.\n\nThe ribbing of \"Barnacles on the ass\" not going unnoticed, with laughs of course, joining the 60 and up crowd, prompting a revised refrain of a slight apology late on in the set, which by all intent and purposes, proposes that a roast of the Maynard is proper fun, adding to the chicanery that you kinda know in is par for the course with a show that's set up like this.\n\nTo wit- no headliners. No \"1- 2- 3\".\n\nBands play, and play amongst and between themselves, collaborating being part of the game, in equal measure to accomplished heavy hitter songs for all three bands having their own just do of course.\n\nAnd when you add to that, all three drummers are perched above on a backstage riser, staircases left and right, interspersed with relaxing and comfy couches, followed by a mini ping pong table stage left, and also to vividly display a nice competitive game of Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots between Carina Round and Maynard, which, when on the LED screens left and right, got resounding applause at the fight- I mean good and loud watching this from the main floor.\n\nSo- a show that's all things fun, as a birthday party should be.\n\nIncluding Carina Round rolling out a cart with a lit up cupcake for Maynard to blow out- one candle only.\n\nAgain- lots of ribbing throughout.\n\nAnd I haven't even gotten to the songs yet.\n\nOverall- I did my homework a bit prior to the show in Chicago- not just reviews, and YouTube this, YouTube that, especially for the last song of the evening- \"Grand Canyon\".\n\nThe issues reared their ugly head on this tour, as any typical tour extravaganza usually does- mostly weather and Mother Nature related.\n\nThat they know how to pivot and make due and problem solve- that says lots about crew, and solution solving, let alone character.\n\nThat says lots also about the brotherhood of musicians, and coming in to add support in times of need, especially of the instrument kind.\n\nI bring all of this up, without attending to the song selections and overall review from the Wintrust Arena in Chicago, because it was amazing witnessing the play by play of the problems with the shows at Red Rocks outside of Denver, and the snow storm that entangled their trucks and equipment and gear to make it to \"Sick New World\" 24 hours later- and- what to do. How to proceed.\n\nBilly Howerdel, lead guitarist for A Perfect Circle, put the plea and word out like literally in transit- asking for assistance, since they're literally going to make the attempt to play at Sick New World, and do their best to make a go of it.\n\nAnd the amount of brotherly assistance....just amazing.\n\nI mean gobsmacked amazing.\n\nSo many people, good people, coming to their aid in time of need.\n\nThe way Billy told it- the phone calls and help went out like at 8am, contacting anyone and everyone, from borrowing gear, borrowing instruments, let alone assistance from talented technicians, and all assisting in pulling this show together for Sick New World, with literally zero seconds for help right up to show time.\n\nSo from my perspective, all that does is amp you up even more before their stop in Chicago, knowing that problem solving, what looks like insurmountable hurdles- all of that can be overcome, with the simple ask- and coming through in a clutch.\n\nAnd to add to that, a well oiled machine of a show by this time towards the tour end, at the Wintrust Arena in Chicago, with the deep breath blessing of being indoors, not outdoors, where they have control of a few things, especially near freezing temperatures with anything \"outside\".\n\nAnd the show works, works on many levels, specifically on overall view and display, nary a hiccup in sight, a methodical procedure where all three bands come and go, mainfloor / mainstage not being problematic whatsoever in anything transition related.\n\nBy the looks of things, poster art wise- it's like also a perception of an old school three ring circus, down to the funny \"10 Cents\" encircled in the upper right hand corner of the poster artwork.\n\nAgain, the timing between all three bands was impeccable, starting of course with three songs from A Perfect Circle to set the overall mood- \"The Package\", \"Disillusioned\", and \"The Contrarian\", with Carina Round contributing.\n\nSuch a delicate, yet forceful way to start the proceedings, Maynard in fine voice, decked out in a comfortable three piece suit front and center.\n\nThen immediately up to bat- Les Claypool and the mighty Primus- \"Act 1\"- an ever ready boot stomping bass onslaught- as tight as they've ever been- drum beat fills equal in measure to sub woofer thumping pulverizing bass this- bass that.\n\n​\n\nClever these guys.\n\nOn vinyl and CD- anything Primus related? Decent- kinda cool. How about Primus live?- That's where things get amped and elevated and memorable. Four songs in Act I- opening with \"Those Damned Blue- Collar Tweekers\", and ending Act I with \"Follow the Fool\".\n\nSuch damn gnarly fun, all things Primus.\n\nThen of course- Puscifer's turn at the wheel. Opening with \"Galileo\", into \"Tiny Monsters\", and then \"Indigo Children\". A desolate and observant view of the shape of things, both on a personal level, and also outwardly, at your surroundings and environment.\n\nOf the three, Puscifer is the more introspective and analytical thinking of the mind, and creative stream of consciousness writing.\n\nCompelling, when you think of it, how through all of the \"Acts\" in sequence (there are three, followed by the \"Sessanta E.P.P.P., and of course the finale, \"Grand Canyon\"), the song selections go from high energy/ let loose, to delicate and sophisticated art rock at a moment's notice.\n\nAnd it all works, some 30 songs total, where, with music hounds like me, of the oh- so- observant kind- it bears repeats, if so inclined, if anything to resonate the nuances, and little things that are equal to the big moments.\n\nA big moment for me- \"Weak and Powerless\", from A Perfect Circle, in Act II.\n\nThat song- crafty cranium synapses exploding- that kinda song, especially presented live, fresh and clean.\n\nEqual in might with of course \"Judith\" from APC, coming later in Act III, where the slow build of intensity is equal in measure with Maynard's passionate plea vocals.\n\nSo when examined in full on unity, all three bands- a deep dive immersion to steady the ship with mighty songs, followed by sophisticated production, followed by high IQ judgement of making things a goofy birthday party, intentional that the professors on stage will zip some jokes by you that will go over your head.\n\nBut the appeal is beyond standoffish intent- all three bands incorporate a style and appeal that is discovery related, topics of concern well worth investigating, and well worth the deep dive in knowledge and learning beyond the scope of a mighty riff, followed by a mighty lyric.\n\nLook no further than Maynard's other band Tool as a case in point.\n\nIntellectual shenanigans, sure- for all three. Followed by \"let's just have a damn good time, and- \"Are in or are you out?\"\n\nWell, I'm a devotee, is the correct answer- so of course I'm in.\n\nI'll cover all three of these bands in equal measure, even if I'm on crutches and arthritic pain, as the years progress, and they're still around.\n\nUnforgettable-\n\nThat's the order of the day with Sessanta.\n\nBobby Talamine - JBTV Music Television Chicago\n\nSessanta, Maynard James Keenan, Primus, Puscifer, A Perfect Circle, Carina Round, Les Claypool, JBTV Music Television, Fiza Javid, Bobby Talamine\n\nStabbing Westward - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nWriting and Photography by Bobby Talamine\n\nEdited by Fiza Javid\n\nHouse of Blues Chicago\n\nFriday - April 26, 2024\n\nThe band still lives, thank god.\n\nThey're as fierce and as committed as ever- that being Christopher Hall and Walter Flakus of Stabbing Westward.\n\nSo refreshing, so invigorating to see them performing live, and in their element of embracing high energy with solid songs in a live and intimate venue such as House of Blues Chicago.\n\nIt's like you have to take a deep breath of sorts- that the band is still intact, after some 35 or more or so years of some serious tumult, and rugged ups and downs of staying together, staying intact as a band.\n\n'\n\nI'm not in their shoes obviously, but from interviews, and knowing the guys somewhat over the years- you get a sense that they understand emphatically the amount of courageousness it takes to make attempts throughout to keep things going, let alone find that creative spark to continue to write solid songs, let alone perform.\n\nAnd it's like the oddball potholes never let up, including their Facebook page, let alone other social media sites, which before entering, have this kind of disclaimer: \"Are you sure you want to continue? This search may include content that's graphic or violent, which may be sensitive to some people\".\n\nAll because the word \"Stabbing\" is in the name of the band. And it's not as if there's a hotline or a customer service to Facebook and other social media companies to explain your case direct- let alone if any knucklehead who came up with the disclaimer has investigated their website or social media home pages further to check what they're about, and realize that the statement upon entering said website or homepage is the dumbest thing known to man, or at least pretty close, when actually viewing the website or home page firsthand.\n\nNow you have a brief idea of what Christopher and Walter are up against, compared to other bands of similar genre and feel.\n\nThe definition of oddball- stuff like that to comprehend and overcome.\n\nHowever they certainly know how to rise above so to speak, and just get on with it.\n\nAnd when performing live, with the additions of Bobby Amaro on drums, along with Cyamak Ashtiani on guitars- they have that spark, that chemistry to elevate things, with an 18 song set that delivers, no let up in sight.\n\nStabbing Westward -

Thursday April 11, 2024\n\nFinally, Young Fathers are in Chicago.\n\nSo looking forward to this show- for months on end.\n\nAnd they don't disappoint, even on a weekday / workday night, at The Vic Theatre in Chicago.\n\nWhat's cool from the start, is the amount of real estate they use on The Vic Theatre stage- which is minimal.\n\nThe setup for gear, main floor mics, drums, floor wedges- that's all in the absolute center, recessed back from the main lip of the stage by about seven feet.\n\nSame with stage left and stage right- total dimensions of the main stage floor setup looked like maybe ten feet to twelve feet deep, twenty feet or so in width.\n\nAnd they utilized that space comfortably virtually for the entire show.\n\nLarge stage, small setup, making things more concise, more tight.\n\nThis works on many levels, especially for such a unique band as Young Fathers.\n\nAnd they've been around for awhile, honing their craft in all aspects of renegade hip hop thought, with crafty beats, subdued emphasis on percussion, along with a walloping drummer to provide the necessary fills when needed.\n\nTouring on the strengths of their latest release \"Heavy Heavy\"- from back in early 2023, the Scottish trio of Alloysious Massaquoi, on Vocals and occasional floor tom percussion, along with Kayus Bankole, also vocal duties and some percussion, and lastly Graham \"G\" Hastings, with vocal, percussion and other instruments- the three of them being together as Young Fathers since technically 2008- have constantly redefined their sound, all the while upping the ante in communal hip hop, shared vocal, heavy backbeat electronica, with a solid tribal feel.\n\nA lot to take in in regards to description, sure, but meaningful, nevertheless.\n\nYou can't pigeon hole them, nor in my belief do they wish to be- let alone having a multitude of social subjects to talk about, to shout out about.\n\n\"Heavy Heavy\" in particular, the strengths of that record alone- hit hard and deep.\n\nPerformed live, even more so, especially with the unique and concise floor setup, with songs such as \"Rice\", \"I Saw\", and \"Drum\" in particular.\n\nYoung Fathers - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nYoung Fathers - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nYoung Fathers - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nYoung Fathers - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nEspecially for me throughout- the procedural and communal choruses, followed by shout out call and responses were just mesmerizing to witness live, stopping you in your tracks, and with a sonic punch that never wavered whatsoever.\n\nJust so unique and raw, let alone the slow build from opener \"Get Started\", from \"White Men Are Black Men Too\"- in 2015, and then off to the races with \"The Queen is Dead\", and into \"Get Up\", which by all intent and purposes is a barnburner, with an oh so catchy buildup four to the floor beat.\n\nAnd these first three on the set for tonight- not even from \"Heavy Heavy\".\n\nYes, their back catalog up to the present day equally up for the challenge, and still noteworthy and powerful.\n\nSome seventeen songs total, ending with \"Toy\", all the while immersed in solid optimism, even for troubled times, and navigating though landmines which seem to be coming at you from everywhere.\n\nTheir blend of optimism, followed by deep rooted soul, added with raw emotions and a commitment to perform as if its your last day on earth...all of this leads up to the simplicity of the whole presentation, the layout of the band, that the songs matter, and the delivery thereof, with minimal lighting, mostly orange hues with the occasional white strobes- all of this is meant for the songs and delivery, not nauseating bells and whistles and flashy pizzazz.\n\nThe overall feel they present to you, just so damn heartfelt- they don't need all that extra bullshit whatsoever.\n\n​\n\nSuffice it to say- easily one of the best shows, one of the most anticipated shows of the year.\n\nSo cool that the delivery was from an intimate and awesome venue such as The Vic Theatre- where sound in an intimate listening room such as The Vic matters.\n\nIt matters lots, especially for a band as uniques and astounding as Young Fathers.\n\nBobby Talamine -

Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nWriting and Photography by Bobby Talamine\n\nEdited by Fiza Javid\n\nSleeping Village Chicago - Sunday, April 7, 2024\n\nA stunning showcase was presented this past Sunday at Chicago's Sleeping Village with Brittany Bindrim, celebrating \"Velella Velella\", an album release showcase, one of two, at Chicago's Sleeping Village.\n\nThe first showcase was held a couple nights before, up in Madison Wisconsin at the Crucible.\n\nFrom all intent and purposes, a jumping off point of sorts, to celebrate this amazing new album by Brittany, with a sort of local homecoming, more intimate, more celebratory and most of all supportive.\n\nEven for a Sunday night, a great turnout, and very enthusiastic, and like me, want to see Brittany succeed, and to see her perform live.\n\nShe has a solid history, with I:Scintilla- a post- industrial workhorse of a band dating back to 2003.\n\nAnd as the band evolved and incorporated other musical styles, backed with solid touring throughout- all of this just established feet planted firmly on the ground, solid performing and commitment, and most of all confidence.\n\nRefreshing to see Brittany stretch out on her own, and making headway into by the looks of things from Sunday night, a promising and solid solo career.\n\nI'm sure there's plenty of challenges, not just in recording and actual songwriting, but also in artistic expression, and how to convey the new songs in such a way that what you see in your head, what you hear in your head, can be expressed in a way that captivates and holds an audience, let alone reaching out a bit and adding to the overall sound and aesthetic with some amazing musician friends.\n\nTrust me- there's most likely more questions and answer than that.\n\nBut still- love that she made the push, love that she's making the attempt.\n\nCertainly the first volley of singles and videos, prior to Velella Velella being released- starting with \"Obelisk\" back in early December of last year, followed by \"Fever Dreams\" mid January, and then \"One Fixed Point\" back in February- the lead up to the album release on March 8th was so worth it, each song uniquely different and captivating, showcasing Brittany's breadth of musical tastes and talents, let alone vocal range.\n\nThis encapsulates a wide and splendid musical path, one with many doors to open, and most of all succeeds, not making you feel impatient, and hear partial- just the opposite- take your time and truly listen, these songs are that strong- at least for me and my take on things.\n\nAnd now for the hard part.\n\nSince they're so intricate, these songs- the entire album- how to make this work performing live, and not make them feel somewhat dead in the water surrounded by backing tracks this, backing tracks that.\n\n\"Go live\", they say.\n\nGo live with a couple musician pals who certainly know how to back you up.\n\nNone other than Jim Cookas on guitar, and occasional programming.\n\nAnd also Alex Klausner- a beast of a drummer, with impeccable timing.\n\nThese two guys- they certainly provided the \"Oomph\", to get these majestic songs over the top.\n\nThe setlist- some eleven songs in total, opening with \"Obelisk\" (which certainly set the mood), followed by \"Cast\", and then into \"Fever Dream\"- and by this time the cast has been set, the band full on, and the striking visuals in the background are on full display.\n\nAnd before you know it, it was over in a flash.\n\nAround an hour total, ending with \"Volcano\".\n\nThe beauty of it all (amongst many things)- there was no time to waste, nothing meandering, or going sideways.\n\nA showcase of Brittany's many talents performing live, letting us into her personal world, filled with honest intent.\n\nBrittany Bindrim -

just so approachable, even for ambient fare.\n\nThey succeed so well with captivating and solid melodies- melodies with a message, both environmental and also political.\n\nThe Hartnoll brothers expand and expand sonically, year after year, without losing their initial innocence without confounding expectations and going all out aggressive- (even though the occasional song (\"Dirty Rat\") can induce that claim.\n\nBut it's not like that throughout their catalog- they pounce when they feel the need to.\n\nIt truly depends on their desires to convey whatever message of angst comes to mind- and proceed from there.\n\nOrbital -

intellectual exercises involving left brain/ right brain- meant for everyone, especially the connoisseurs of all things \"electronica\".\n\nCan't give a higher recommendation than that.\n\nThe Hartnoll brothers are that good, that well thought out, that polished.\n\nAll the while by the looks of things, having fun and a damn good time, equal to their fanatical fanbase on the main floor.\n\nThat show could've gone on all night I tell ya- and they have the albums dating back to 1991 to back that up, with again, nothing dated whatsoever.\n\nGotta love the Hartnoll brothers.\n\nOpener Greg Haus-\n\nGot there nice and early, when the doors opened at 10pm to catch his set.\n\nA well thought out mix for that hour he had.\n\nHad a nice exchange on my Facebook page with Greg, posting some photos of him performing and such.\n\nBut Greg said it best in response, and I would rather he explain things on his approach opening for Orbital: \"About 2/3rds of my set were '90's and early 2000's electronica, progressive house and trance tracks, which seemed appropriate for the crowd. Orbital were absolutely phenomenal\".\n\nThat's Greg for ya- Well thought out, wearing his heart on his sleeve.\n\nAll n' all- a most memorable night throughout, with a sophisticated venue such as Radius, and a PA with a wallop.\n\nBobby Talamine - JBTV Music Television Chicago\n\nOrbital, The Green/ Brown Tour 2024, Paul Hartnoll, Phil Hartnoll, Greg Haus, JBTV Music Television, Fiza Javid, Bobby Talamine\n\nAlkaline Trio - Bobby Talamine (c) 2024\n\nWriting and Photography by Bobby Talamine\n\nEdited by Fiza Javid\n\nSaturday - March 16, 2024\n\nMatt Skiba.\n\nDan Andriano.\n\nAtom Willard.\n\nAll decked out in business suits.\n\nAnd ready for business.\n\nBusiness at hand-\n\n\"Blood, Hair, and Eyeballs\" related- their latest release from this past January.\n\nLots to say apparently, up to the present day, all shock / horror style, like diving into local and national news with depictions of violence of all shapes and sizes, local, national, worldwide.\n\nRefreshing to know that they're as confused and confounded as we are, not having answers on the current state of aff"
