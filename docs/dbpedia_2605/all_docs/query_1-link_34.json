        "text": "Today, Roger O’Donnell (keyboard player of The Cure) releases his latest solo project ‘2 Ravens’. The release comes digitally via 99X/10 Records/Caroline International. Nick Taylor recorded and mixed the album in Air-Edel Studio 1.\n\nThe album provides a personal insight into Roger’s world and the influences on his life of rural England. Written in December 2016 during a period of solitude and reflection after a year long tour with The Cure. The starkness and bleak nature of the countryside weighing heavily on the compositions. The album was recorded over five days at Air Edel Studios in London with some of Roger’s favourite musicians: Alisa Liubarskaya, Miriam Wakeling, Aled Jones, Nadine Nagen and Daniel Gea.\n\n‘An Old Train’ came as the first release from the album, a piece featuring Jennifer Pague. The track encapsulates the tone of the project with Pague’s intense vocals and edgy lyrics taking the track to sensational peaks over a sundry of strings. 2 Ravens works as a collaboration, in part, with vocalist and lyricist Jennifer Pague of Vita and The Woolf. The record first began as an instrumental record, side one featuring two cellos and piano with side two featuring a string quartet. However, when Roger was introduced to Jennifer he sent it to her for input. Jennifer then sent back 90 seconds of vocals on one track and Roger was blown away by her interpretation. The piano plays the supporting role rather than taking the lead and the instruments make frames for the paintings that are Jennifer’s vocals. The instrumentals tell stories words simply can’t."
