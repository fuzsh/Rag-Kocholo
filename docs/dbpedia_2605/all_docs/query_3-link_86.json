        "text": "Youtube\n\nMany know me from my YouTube channel Matthew North Music. I started this firstly as just a platform for my music but in later 2020 I took it a bit more seriously and now produce content on a regular basis with my subscription count going up all the time. If you do not follow then take a look at http://youtube.com/matthewnorthmusic\n\nMatthew on 'The Late Show' BBC Local radio in the South West\n\nFrom 2009 to 2015 I was a contributer to the BBC Radio programme 'The Late Show' presented by Vic Morgan was on BBC Local Radio in Devon, Cornwall and the Channel Islands until Vic retired from the BBC.\n\nAbove Vic Morgan\n\nSome of the bands and artists that we featured include\n\nDavid Gilmour, The Mission, Leadbelly, Lonnie Donegan, Frank Zappa, Deep Purple, Curve, The Belltower, Manfred Mann, Sky Saxon, Patrick Cleandenim, Black Widow, Reeves Gabrels, Alice Cooper, The Cult, Balaam and the Angel, Chickenfoot, Simon Hinkler, Altered States, Jeff Healey Band, Roger O'Donnell, Erin Lang, Eureka Machines and more.....\n\nin 2019 I was on BBC radio 4's Today Programme along with BBC radio Solent, BBC Radio Devon and BBE Radio 5 Live talking about the Discovery of Audio from Scott Walkers first solo telelvision performance in 1967. I located the tapes some years ago, but the story got traction after Scott passed away.\n\nI am often used as a talking head on radio and television for various music related matters. Mostly in BBC local radio but often other stations as well.\n\nMusic for Television and Radio\n\nI have recorded and composed music for various TV and Radio over the years incuding in 2008 the opening music for BBC One's 'The Estate We're In' Series 2 Episodes 3,4 & 5.\n\nIn 2006 I did the theme music to BBC South West's music sequence 'The White Labels' a forerunner to BBC Introducing. I have also contributed music to other shows such as BBC Children in Need.\n\nI stepped away from doing TV music as I had many other projects on the go, though I intend to get back to it.\n\nTelevision Film work\n\nI have spent most of my life working in Television as a picture editor and news telelvision director though I have also worked on a number of other projects ranging from concert films and doccumentries to live events and promotional films."
