        "text": "Biography\n\nI have been a touring musician for over 25 years and has appeared on over 15 CD releases and performed hundreds of live shows both as part of bands and as a solo artist.\n\nMy day job (Always been semi pro musician never pro!) Is in the world of television as a video editor but music is very much my main passion.\n\nI enjoy touring and traveling and love to do more of it whenever possible.\n\nI started playing guitar when I was in primary school mostly playing along to my dads old Lonnie Donegan records as well as strumming along to bands like Status Quo and The Human League. I learned early on a technique of using 2 reel to reel tape machines to bounce from one to another via a mixer and this was my first experimentation to multitrack recording. After I left college myself and student friend Steven Howson went to see The Sisters Of Mercy and shortly after we formed the band All Living Fear.\n\nAll Living Fear became a moderately successful DIY Gothic Rock band we played around 200 shows all over the UK and released many albums. I put the band on indefinite hold in 2010 though we have played the odd show since.\n\nWith former All Living Fear vocalist Paul Roe we formed the electronic based rock band Corrosion in 2001 and released 2 eps and 1 album however this was very much seen as All Living Fear Mk 2.\n\n2011 and a total change in direction as well as starting to perform as a solo singer / songwriter I formed the band 'Secrets For September' initially as a recording project it became a fully fledged band and have so far released 3 CD and several singles with a full album currently in the works. This band is more in the vein of All About Eve, Pink Floyd and other more progressive influenced music.\n\nMy most recent project in 2014 I Was asked to perform with Jazz legend Mike Westbrook, I was brought up on his music by my late Father and I got to meet him in 2012 when I Started making films of his concerts. This lead on to me joining the band as a guitarist on his new work 'A Bigger Show' that was released in 2015. Since then I have appeared on several other CDs and have toured all over the UK and in Italy and Germany. Still doing it and enjoying it very much. Recently also played a sold out show at the legendary Ronnie Scott's in Lodon.\n\nFrom the end of the 90s I have also been running the fan club for The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown, I have also played the odd guest performance with Arthur as well as tour managing and front of house sound.
