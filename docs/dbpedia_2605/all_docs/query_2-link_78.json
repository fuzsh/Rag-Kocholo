I’ve chosen an old song, “Poppaldin” of the indie rock band Maus.\n\nThe band was formed in 1993 by Birgir Örn Steinarsson (Biggi), vocalist & guitarist, Daníel Þorsteinsson (Danni, “Krei-C”), drummer, Eggert Gíslason, bass player, and guitarist Páll Ragnar Pálsson (Palli). They have been supporting act for Placebo, Keane, Ash, Ian Brown & Coldplay.\n\nMembers are now involved in several other music projects: Fræ (Palli‘s band), Sometime (Danni‘s band) and Biggi made a Solo Album.\n\nSong of the 100. Week is taken from their Album “Lof Mér Að Falla Að Þínu Eyra” (1997). Roger O’Donnell of The Cure fame, was a guest keyboardist on this album.\n\nwww.myspace.com/mausiceland"
