        "text": "This is the weekly installment where we recap what we’ve been spinning at The Synthesizer Book headquarters during the week. If it’s on this list, it got played more than once!\n\n1.Alabama 3 (A3)-Woke Up This Morning\n\nThis track popped up randomly. It played at the end of something I was playing in iTunes. I can’t even remember what came before it now. I had no idea these guys were from Brixton, London. Great track. At first I thought it was Shriekback. The singer reminds me of Barry Andrews. I love vocals in the baritone range. Jhonn Balance had that appeal too. Great track to end the week. There are some great remixes of this track too on iTunes.\n\n2.Coil-The Hills Are Alive (Unnatural History II)\n\nI tend to consume myself in topics. I’m either an all in or forget it type of person. I’m not a big believer in sound-bytes, and brief explanations rarely work with me. So, this week, after the very unfortunate passing of Peter ‘Sleazy’ Christopherson, I’ve been thinking, reading, writing and listening to just about everything I can of his. I was reading an obituary on The Quietus and one of the writers mentioned this track. It’s a dance track of sorts, but not just any dance track. The track is filled with slight unexpected twists throughout. That alone easily makes it a standout. Jonny Mugwump mentioned that it stood out for him from a compilation he had purchased. It’s easy to see the how and why. If the experimentalism of Coil is hard for you to digest (why would it!?), seek out some of their more uptempo dance oriented tracks. Christopherson and Balance were raving and making dance type tracks before it would become the cliche it is today. I like my uptempo beats to have a dark bent. Seek this track out if you’re tired of the genre type formulas.\n\n3.John Foxx-Metamatics\n\nThis is another album that gets played a lot in the car. It’s actually my 3 year old that demands this one all the time now. It used to be my older son, but he’s moved onto Stray Cats, Bonobo and Massive Attack’s Heligoland. Yeah, my sons make listening to music fun. Foxx used minimal electronic gear to make this album. His departure from Ultravox couldn’t have come at a better time. In 1980 he and Gareth Jones did a monumental job with an ARP Odyssey synthesizer, a Roland CR-78 drum machine, a string synthesizer, some pedals, Foxx’s voice, and not much else. They created a new sound that would make this a vital album for the synthesizer-pop genre. There is another Hackney duo that should be mentioned, but I’ll let you figure that one out!\n\n4.Coil- The Ape of Naples\n\nThis is the last album Coil would make before the passing of Jhonn Balance. It’s become one of my favorite Coil LP’s. Great name and I’d love to hear about the inspiration for that from someone. A great album you should purchase. I had to cut a lot of wood this past weekend and this is what I had on in my headphones. I played it at least 6 times that day.\n\n5.Coil- Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 1 & 2\n\nSee above and throughout the site and you’ll figure it out. From the moment Are You Shivering comes on, we know we’re in for a special treat. It’s instant dread followed by more of Coil’s unexpected. Beautiful riffs, melodies, grooves and the type of lyrics only Coil could do. I ordered these 2 albums earlier in the year on CD. Never got my hands on the limited editions and they fetch a few hundred dollars sometimes. Worth it?…Absofreakinlutely.\n\n6.Group Home-Livin’ Proof\n\nSomething happens to me every winter. I tend to gravitate toward my Akai MPC’s. Not contrived, but almost naturally. It’s been Logic world for me this past month and the switch in gears to Akai only was welcome. I tend to listen to Hip-Hop more now than any other part of the year too. I’m not sure why, really. This album reminds me of a few cold winters back. We had a massive snowstorm. I had to go to a very lavish Christmas party at the Vancouver Aquarium. It was a corporate sponsored event. I just remember the Beluga whales and the steam coming off their spouts. I remember lots of snow and some weird (or not!) happenings in the bathrooms and by the shark tanks. You gotta love corporate events from dot-coms! People just let their hair down and cut loose. This album was playing at a pre-party event I had gone to earlier that evening. This got played again this week. Hip-Hop heads might accuse me of being “backpacker-ish.” I don’t care. This is the type of Boom-Bap I dig. Great album for this cold weather.\n\n7.Bonobo-Black Sands\n\nCheck out some iPhone photos from the sold out show this past week. What a great artist and his live band really impressed me. This album is not a new listen for me. My youngest son is a very big fan of Bonobo. He makes me play track 3, 6, & 9 over and over and over again. That’s how he remembers them. Kids love repetition! Black Sands will be on my yearly list of top albums. It’s a fantastic album that deserves repeated listens. Even if it’s at the repeated request of a young boy! He didn’t get to go the concert. He asked if he could. I did get him a 7 inch record, which he really liked.\n\n8.Adem-Homesongs\n\nEarlier in the week I talked about Four Tet. Adem is 1/3 of Fridge. I played this album so much when it was first released back in 2004. Like the minimalism of Nico’s Desertshore, this too comes in handy this week, as I was seeking something to remind me that good songwriting need not always contain step sequencers, massive plug-ins and banks of synthesizers. This was a favorite of Roger O’Donnell (The Cure) too, I remember.\n\n9.Scanner Vs. DJ Spooky-The Quick and the Dead\n\nRobin Rimbaud (Scanner) launched his online shop earlier this week. Check the post below. There is some albums of his that I do not have and will be getting soon. This one is not on there, but one I played this week. This collaboration was again, something unexpected at the time. The New York DJ vs. the London experimentalist. That alone should make you pause, right? It’s a great album filled with beats, turntable-isms, soundscapes, samples, and the standouts for me are Guanxi and Journey. This 1999 release still sounds good to my ears. I’m glad I purchased it and really enjoyed playing this again. I think I had just moved to Seattle when I purchased this.\n\n10.Scanner-Reason By Heart, Sleep By Twilight\n\nGreat atmospheric sounding album. I love the cover (see above). I think that was a motivator for purchase. The music is noteworthy as well. Close your eyes, and listen. Mesmerizing. Then go check out his new shop at http://scanner.greedbag.com\n\nThis is the weekly installment where we recap what we’ve been spinning at The Synthesizer Book headquarters during the week. If it’s on this list, it got played more than once!\n\nThis week’s platter is dedicated to the memory of an unsung musical icon and one of my biggest and most treasured idols… RIP Sleazy. You will always be remembered.\n\n1. Coil-Horse Rotorvator\n\nWith much sadness I am playing this album right now. It was my first Coil album and certainly not my last! I loved all of the work of Peter Sleazy Christopherson immensely. It was my wish to have seen him perform live. I will never get that opportunity. You will be missed terribly.\n\n2. Throbbing Gristle – Part Two: Endless Not\n\nI just purchased The Third Mind Movements via their website. Just in time for the holidays too. The Greedbag should be arriving soon. I usually start to get antsy when waiting for an album to arrive in the mail. In the meantime, I’ve consoled myself with this great recording. I think this is going to be one of my favorite Throbbing Gristle recordings that I own. Not sure if it’s the weather, my head-space, or what, but I’m glad this landed back into my rotation of things to play on my iPod. Also, for some strange reason, this album gets me thinking about mortality. Not in a dark and eerie way as has been described in other reviews, though. More like in the reflective manner of a man walking down the dark river of death and wondering if he has fought the good fight. As if he was deep in thought, as the chilled waters dampened his feet just before the gates of death. I think it’s a valid visual and this works as its background. I’ve been quite pensive this week. This has helped. It could also have something to do with the still air just before the impending snow storm. It is insanely quiet outside this week. Although the Annual Report series are among my favorites, I could see this album making its way to the top. This experimental recording works well. This is evidence here, experimentation captured in high quality sound. I think Almost a Kiss is now my favorite Genesis P. Orridge vocal. Greasy Spoon, After the Fall, Lyar Liar and The Worm Waits Its Turn are standout tracks.\n\n3. The The – Hanky Panky\n\nI’m not sure what possessed Matt Johnson to go with a Hank Williams cover album. I’ll have to go back and dig up the CD and read the liner notes. Either way, this album always brings me back to great places I lived. I got this back in 1994 from Big B’s in Las Vegas. RIP. I miss the abundant record shops that existed while I went to university. They’ve almost all disappeared in recent years. Damn downloads! I always thought Matt Johnson was a great lyricist. I’ve been a fan of The The since the first release on the Some Bizzare compilation.\n\n4. The The – Dusk\n\nPart of my day is taken up driving the kids to school, swimming and soccer games. This one has been played by request by them. It appears my sons have taken to liking Helpline Operator very much. Makes me think about all the good music parents don’t play for their children. Instead they play nursery rhyme nonsense for them when what they want to listen to is right in your record, cd, or MP3 collection.\n\n5. Clock DVA- Man Amplifiers This album is so off-kilter, but that’s what I dig about it. It dates back to 1991. What I’ve really been wanting is a legit copy of White Souls in Black Suits. Still, this album got the heavy rotation this week. If you are interested in electronic music, tape loops and lots of synthesizer goodness, check out this Sheffield outfit. I really do get why Clock DVA gets copied by the darkset! This music is damn good. I love Nitzer Ebb because they remind me of CDVA a bit, but ain’t nothing like the real thing.\n\n6. Cabaret Voltaire- 1974-1976\n\nI think I mentioned Chris Watson in last week’s platter. He was around for these sessions from 1974-1976. In fact, I think these may have even been recorded at his house. I’ll have to do some more digging up on the history of this. How could you not like a band that gives homage to things Dada with a band name and track names like The Dada Man. Do The Shake makes you realize that perhaps all was not doom and gloom during this period of time. These so called experimental industrialists created some good music. I only wish I was there to see how they did it. Lots of great loops on the album. Venusian Animals is one of my favorites on this. I had to order this from Amazon in the UK as the prices stateside are just too much for this one.\n\n7. The Raconteurs – Steady As She Goes\n\nI like Jack White. My son loves that video he was in with Alicia Keys for the Bond movie,…Another Way To Die. I like this Raconteurs song quite a bit. So, that’s why it’s here. Jack White fit in well with Jimmy Page and the Edge of U2. Yeah, I finally got to see It Might Get Loud on HDtv. That was really entertaining. From the Edge’s 4 track tape recordings, to Jimmy Page doing Whole Lotta Love, what a great documentary. If you haven’t already seen it, do. Lots of guitar talk and just plain awesome seeing Jimmy Page. I had a much older brother that would play me Led Zeppelin songs.\n\n8. Led Zeppelin- Whole Lotta Love\n\nWhen Jimmy Page played this riff on It Might Get Loud, I got misty eyed. I had a much older brother. He was into The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. No matter where I am, every-time I hear Led Zeppelin I think of him. Regrettably, he and I were never really close nor had much in common. Still, one thing is certain, I owe my love of the Zep to him. Thank you brother.\n\n9. The Smiths-The Queen Is Dead\n\nOne of the ways we boys judged girls we wanted to court in high school, was whether or not they had this album in their record and cassette collections. Some other bands like the Cure or Depeche Mode could excuse you, but if you had this, we were impressed. I got a few texts earlier in the week from my oldest friend. He was listening to BBC Radio on satellite radio. They had a Smiths marathon going on with interviews with some of the band members. It was really funny. I would get texts as they must’ve moved through the songs with some reminder of things past. This was an album of my youth and I treasure it like I treasure my Brett Easton Ellis books. What a great album in such a large body of work – that I admire.\n\n10. Roger Waters -Amused To Death\n\nA friend of mine is lamenting missing Waters’ rendition of The Wall. The show is sold-out. It was a little fun rubbing in the fact that I got to see Roger Waters perform The Wall in Seattle a few years back. What a great show that was. First half was a mix of a lot of his solo work. After intermission, it’s a full on rendition of The Wall, with an EMS Synthi AKS and everything! A few of us were talking just before a Logic tutorial and this album was recommended to me. A friend of mine insisted I listen to it this week. Thanks for letting me borrow the CD, PM. It’s a really good album with some great production and some brilliant stereo imaging. If you love the guitar and some fantastic sound fx mixed all around the aural space, then give this a listen. It’s a good to contrast to all the other things I have been submersing myself in.\n\nMy research of Carter, Tutti, Christopherson and P. Orridge continues with passion. The more I look, the more I to want to write about them and digest information. This isn’t helping my time-line for completing my book. Nonetheless, they are worthy of all the research I have put into them and still I have no regrets! To think I haven’t even reached out to them for an interview yet! What might happen then, I wonder!?! I just keep finding new media to share insights into their careers as artist and musicians. Yes, they make for that great of a subject. The endless media on them has become for me, like finding a rare record. Each discovery revealing new insight and adding to the adoration of this collector. You need not look further than some of the post on here, and on my Twitter feeds to arrive at the conclusion that I have become a devout follower.\n\nMy list of influences is immense. Yet, somehow they have managed to make their way to the top of it. Everything from their archetype to their visualizations has become vital and worthy of investigation. More importantly though, it is the music that matters to me most. Their use of synthesizers, handmade tone generators and instruments will be my focus, but their is much more to them than that. There is very little that is conventional about them. They fit no mold or trend. Their ability to defy norms and trends is perhaps why I find their music so compelling too. Listen to their music and see just how much they have, whether overtly or covertly influenced much of what has come after them.\n\nSo, here (below) is another bit of media to add to your list of research. This was conducted sometime this year in London at RBMA. This is Cosey Fanni Tutti. Enjoy.\n\nWords from the Red Bull Academy… CTI, London, UK\n\n“Cosey Fanni Tutti is a seismic force in cultural terms. Whether delivering confrontational performances in radical Dadaist art group COUM Transmissions, shaping the mould for industrial music as one quarter of Throbbing Gristle, constructing a prototype for techno and acid house with her partner Chris in Carter Tutti (nee Chris & Cosey), or discombobulating the bounds of art with her explorations in glamour modelling, her work has frequently been years ahead of its time. Cosey’s work has influenced thought across the creative spectrum. The seminal TG album 20 Jazz Funk Greats was so influential that Carl Craig directly referenced it in his 1991 EP under the 69 guise, 4 Jazz Funk Classics. Cosey has collaborated widely with artists including Monte Cazazza, Coil, Current 93, John Duncan, Erasure, Eurythmics, Boyd Rice, and Robert Wyatt, and always with a distinctly original and genuine approach to music. She continues to produce music, art and video work from the London studio she owns with Chris Carter.”\n\nHere is a clip from Youtube where she is discussing 20 Jazz Funk Greats:\n\nFor the full interview, transcript, and MP3 Podcast, go to Red Bull Academy’s Video Archive:\n\nhttp://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/video-archive/lectures/cosey_fanni_tutti_visceral_sounds"
