        "text": "Echo & the Bunnymen kicked off their Crocodiles/Heaven Up Here tour on May 5 in Atlanta, where they play their first two albums in their entirety. Former members Lol Tolhurst and Roger O’Donnell will join The Cure for shows in Sydney to perform their first three albums, Three Imaginary Boys (e.g. Boys Don’t Cry), Seventeen Seconds and Faith on May 31 and June 1. This fall The Mission and Gene Loves Jezebel will play a 25th anniversary concert. Last year I saw Psychedelic Furs perform a selection of their best 80s songs. Nearly all of these shows have been or will sell out. These post-punk bands that became the cream of college rock radio in the mid-eighties are likely playing to bigger crowds now than they were 30 years ago.\n\n“College Rock” was used to describe the music that populated the playlists of American college radio stations in the 80s, just before commercial stations began using the term “modern rock” in the late 80s, and then “alternative rock.” My first exposure to college rock began with KUNI, the radio station of the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, which also transmitted in four other cities, including my hometown of Dubuque. I was introduced to all sorts of post-punk and indie rock on shows often hosted by KUNI mastermind Bob Dorr. While I got turned onto American bands like R.E.M. and the Replacements, British and Australian bands overall seemed to have more allure. The less I knew about them, the more mysterious they were. At least until they started showing up in soundtracks to movies that defined the adolescent years of my generation, such as John Hughes’ Pretty In Pink (1986) and Some Kind Of Wonderful (1987).\n\nSeeing the row of cassettes in the banner of the Slicing Up Eyeballs website, which tracks reunions, tours, reissues and new releases of college rock era bands, reminds me of when I’d discover to my surprise and delight, that Target stocked a lot of these in their $5.99 cassette sales. By 1986 most of these bands had pretty solid major label distribution, were all pretty well produced, but had a refreshing array of styles as colorful as their cover art. My friend Mike and I would often buy something like The Church, Love & Rockets, The Woodentops or Screaming Blue Messiahs based on just one track I heard via KUNI, or even unheard based on a record review. The charts and MTV were still dominated by mainstream pop and hair metal like Bon Jovi and Poison, but at least some of college rock wasn’t so underground that they were impossible to find by then. With the demise of Trouser Press and The Record magazines, SPIN and Rolling Stone seemed to pick up some slack in reviewing college rock.\n\nBy the time I actually got to college, I started to lose track of the bands that hadn’t already broken up. I played some of the bands on my first couple radio shows in the spring and summer of ’88, but then became immersed in my pre-punk, punk and post-punk show. Time spent listening to new music in 1988-89 was limited mostly to Sonic Youth, The Pixies, Slayer, Dinosaur Jr., Godflesh, Fugazi, Melvins and Bad Brains. I rarely heard commercial radio, which was apparently playing hits by The Church, Love And Rockets, New Order and The Cure. But to my ears at the time they sounded completely different than a couple years before, way too mellow, overproduced, dancey or mellow next to Wire, Joy Division, Buzzcocks, Gang Of Four, The Birthday Party and Pere Ubu. Some of the releases in 1989 (XTC, The Jesus And Mary Chain, The Screaming Blue Messiahs, Hoodoo Gurus) I heard in full and was bitterly disappointed, others (The Cure, New Order, Love And Rockets, The Stone Roses) I completely ignored. I didn’t get around to hearing most of them for another decade, when I first started to miss that kind of music. I’ve gradually appreciated them for what they are, the last glimmer of some pretty awesome bands (or in the case of The Stone Roses, the only burst of creativity from a hugely overrated, but still enjoyable band). Every couple years I revisit this era (1987: 20th Year Reunion, Revisiting Music After 20+ Years, 1986: One Boy’s Quest to Avoid Bon Jovi and Find Cooler Bands) and get reaquainted with albums I hadn’t listened to in ages, or missed at the time.\n\nOne band I completely missed was The House Of Love. Their debut album made a big impact in England in 1988, picking up the torch from The Smiths as the next big guitar pop band. They were totally off my radar as I was focused on noiser fare at the time. It wasn’t until 2000 that I finally got a comp courtesy of Julian White, of the first album and singles from 1986 and 1987. Their first single “Christine” was supposedly their pinnacle, which threw me because it just sounded like an okay rip-off of early Jesus and the Mary Chain. It wasn’t until this past month that I really dug into their catalog and developed an appreciation for them, especially the immaculate guitar that can evoke melancholy or vivid, swirly psychedelia.\n\nTwo other bands I completely ignored were on the goth end of the spectrum, The Mission U.K. and Gene Loves Jezebel. The Mission U.K. consisted of a couple ex-members of The Sisters Of Mercy, who I liked pretty well. I don’t think there was a goth-shaped hole in my life, but the albums are enjoyable. What’s surprising is that I heard very little of the darker goth influences of Bauhaus, Joy Division and Siouxsie & the Banshees, and more of the arena-ready stylings of contemporaries U2 and The Simple Minds. I might have been scared off by the entry in the Trouser Press Record Guide, “The dull and insipid guitar/keyboard/string bombast of Gods Own Medicine (1986) proceeds from a horrible amalgam of Led Zeppelin, Yes and Echo & the Bunnymen.” It’s enjoyable in a shameless classic rock inspired way as The Cult. Children (1988) actually employ’s Led Zep’s John Paul Jones as producer. Gene Loves Jezebel is fairly similar, but with the vocals a more acquired taste, full of pre-Perry Farrell yelps and squawks.\n\nFurniture are one of those lost bands dug up by Cherry Red and reissued in 2010. Their song “Brilliant Mind” was featured on the Some Kind Of Wonderful soundtrack, which featured unusually obscure artists, even for John Hughes, including Pete Shelley (Buzzcocks), Blue Room, Flesh For Lulu, Lick The Tins, The Apartments and March Violets. The singer uses a deep baritone that’s somewhere between Peter Murphy and Stephen Merritt.\n\nUK Albums\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (WB) 85\n\nThe Fall – This Nation’s Saving Grace (Beggars Banquet) 85\n\nU2 – The Unforgettable Fire (Island) 84\n\nEcho & the Bunnymen – Ocean Rain (Sire) 84\n\nThe Smiths – The Queen Is Dead (Sire) 86\n\nXTC – Skylarking (Geffen) 86\n\nThe Woodentops – Giant (Rough Trade/Columbia) 86\n\nScreaming Blue Messiahs – Gun Shy (Elektra) 86\n\nNew Order – Low-Life (Factory/Qwest) 85\n\nThe Blue Nile – A Walk Across The Rooftops (Linn/Virgin) 84\n\nThe Fall – The Wonderful And Frightening World Of The Fall (Beggars Banquet) 84\n\nTalk Talk – Spirit Of Eden (EMI) 88\n\nMy Bloody Valentine – Isn’t Anything (Creation) 88\n\nThe House Of Love (Creation) 88\n\nThe Cult – Love (Beggars Banquet) 85\n\nThe Pogues – Rum Sodomy & The Lash (WEA) 85\n\nNick Cave & the Bad Seeds – Your Funeral . . .
