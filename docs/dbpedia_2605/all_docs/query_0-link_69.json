        "text": "Our founder, Brad Birzer, recently did a two-part episode of National Review’s music podcast, Political Beats. If you are not familiar, this podcast usually features a guest and a discussion of a particular band.\n\nFor this two-parter, Brad and the normal panel discuss the career of progressive rock giants Yes, album-by-album. I’ve conversed with Brad in a group chat about the episode, and he liked my comments enough to ask me to present them here. As such, here they are, unedited save for a few interjections.\n\nFirst comment, after listening fully to Part 1 and a little bit of Part 2 (in italics, my additional interjections in brackets]:\n\nHi Brad – I just finished listening to the first Yes episode and have listened up through the discussion on GFTO in the second episode. I loved the discussion on TFTO, and I think “beautiful failure” is an apt description, although I would also add it was a necessary failure. They found their limits on that album because they tested those limits, and I think that allowed them to be more concise and focused with their next two albums. [Tales from Topographic Oceans was Yes’s most ambitious album, and to paraphrase what Jon Anderson said about it, it was the meeting of high ideals and low energy. It certainly has some brilliant music on it but also has a lot of mindless noodling. Most of the panel thought the first and last pieces of the album – The Revealing Science of God and Ritual, respectively – were the best pieces. For my money, it’s actually the second piece, The Remembering, which holds together best (although even it suffers a little from needless padding). On that note, I think the bass playing in that piece is brilliant, often subtle and understated (not often a Chris Squire trademark), and he says as much that he was proud of that in YesStories by Tim Morse]\n\nI also liked the observation that at times on TFTO, they were fitting the art to the format instead of just letting it flow organically. That’s one reason I’m not as down on the digital formats as some are today, because it essentially removes such restraints an allows the artist to just create without having to adapt the art to the format. I think Gazpacho’s Night is a great example of that, as I just don’t think it would flow anywhere near as well if it had to be adapted to (and possibly compromised by) the LP format. [In line with the discussion above, I think a lot of the problem with TFTO was directly related to this observation. Multiple panelists stated this album could have been better with some editing, but such editing within the limitations of the LP format would have been much more difficult.]\n\nI would have been a slightly dissenting voice in the GFTO discussion with regard to Awaken, which I think is pure, magical, utter freakin’ brilliance and even in a catalog that includes Close to the Edge, it’s my favorite Yes composition. The production, the dynamics of the piece, the playing, the shifts in mood … all of that adds up to me as just an incredible musical journey that leaves me satisfied every time I hear it, and yet wanting more of it at the same time. [This was my biggest dissent with the panel. Not that they disrespected Awaken, but they certainly didn’t see it the way I do. Progressive rock (particularly, symphonic progressive rock) was often described as the fusion of rock and classical music, and this piece more than any exemplifies that fusion in its best form to my ears. The tone and timbre of the instrumentation here (especially with the harp and the church organ) really give it a classical feel in a way that exceeds event hat of Close to the Edge. The crescendo that consumes the second half of the piece, beginning with a few quiet plucks of the harp by Anderson is brilliance, slowly, patiently building to a powerful conclusion. Give it another try. On the other hand, I loved that they all showed so much love to Parallels, my second favorite song on this album, which features incredible playing (and interplay) among Howe’s guitar, Squire’s bass, and Wakeman’s keyboards. I had a lot more to say about this album some years ago on Progarchy, that piece can be found here.]\n\nWill let you know what I think of the rest of it when I finished. Really looking forward to the discussions of Drama and 90125.\n\nSecond Comment after listening to Part 2:\n\nFinished the second episode now. Definitely enjoyed the discussion and agreed with a majority of the takes. After Magnification, the only Yes album that has interested me is Fly From Here: Return Trip because of the Drama connection. Drama, BTW, might be my favorite Roger Dean cover. I love the album, although I will admit that the overselling of “Yes” on Tempus Fugit wore on my after a while (but instrumentally, it’s an incredible song). [That’s about my only issue at all with Drama, which is a great album in its own right. I share the sentiments with others on the panel that wonder what might have been had that lineup continued.]\n\nThought the observation that some of the ideas on Tormato were good ideas poorly executed was a good one. My pick for that would by Onward, which I actually liked much better on Keys to Ascension when Howe brought in the nylon string guitar in place of the electric in the studio version. [Onward is one of many pieces by bands I love that seem to come off better live than in the studio, and Howe’s nylon string guitar on the KTA version is the reason why here. Gates of Delirium is another Yes piece l like better live than in the studio due to some production issues (although the Steven Wilson remaster seemed to fix most of those).]\n\nAs for Release Release, I’ve always preferred a cover by Shadow Gallery (from the tribute album Tales from Yesterday) to the original studio version, as it has the punch that the original was lacking. [That song just needed to rock more. While Howe was excellently versatile in many styles of guitar, he didn’t seem to have an affinity for the kind of bone-crunching power chords that song needed, or at least he saved that for Machine Messiah on the next album]\n\nLike you and the rest of the panel, I was pretty disappointed with Big Generator, other than Shoot High Aim Low, it was pretty forgettable. Trivia note: I heard a Rabin interview where he stated that Love Will Find a Way was a song he had originally written for Stevie Nicks, but the rest of the band wanted to keep it for themselves. [Yeah, what a disappointment after 90125. On the other hand, I loved the discussion of 90125, and was happy that nobody on the panel was such a prog snob that they dismissed the album as other prog snobs are wont to do. Sure, it was a lot different from their previous work, but it was undoubtedly Yes, and it was the kind of reinvention that only a band like Yes could pull off in such a spectacular fashion.]\n\nIf you’re a Yes fan and haven’t listened to these this two-part episode, I strongly recommend you do so. You won’t be sorry!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSpirit of Cecilia loves the prog group IZZ! It’s always a cause for rejoicing when they release a new album, and member John Galgano was kind enough to share an advance copy with us. It’s called Collapse the Wave, and it contains some of the best music they’ve ever recorded. Brad Birzer and Kevin McCormick share their thoughts on this new set of songs.\n\nBrad: I always love doing these with you guys. Kevin, thanks for being my partner here.\n\nI absolutely love IZZ. Indeed, the band represents best what we try to do at Spirit of Cecilia. Art for the sake of intellectual and spiritual edification, understanding the dignity of the human person, and playing like men and women possessed by the muses. Lyrics that read like T.S. Eliot wrote them based on the theology of John Paul II and the philosophy of C.S. Lewis. What’s not to love?\n\nEvery part of the band is incredible–from John Galgano’s excellent voice and bass to Laura Meade’s rather heavenly vocals. Tom Galgano (I love that this is a family affair)’s majestic keyboards and vocals, to Paul Bremner’s astounding guitar work, to the two profound drummers, Brian Coralian and Greg Dimideli. Amazing. Astounding. “This is the real thing.”\n\nTo be sure, IZZ and Glass Hammer are my two favorite rock bands from the U.S. If anything, I just can’t believe that IZZ isn’t HUGE! They deserve to be adored and well loved. Frankly, they should be as loved here in the States as Big Big Train is in the U.K. and Europe.\n\nI also love how the band–though unique in its own sound–reflects the loves of the members of IZZ: Gentle Giant, Genesis, ELP, Yes, Jethro Tull, and others. In other words, they readily blend tradition with innovation, no mean feat in 2024.\n\nMy own history with the band goes back over a dozen years now. In fact, I was introduced to the band by their 2012 album, Crush of Night. I’m not sure, now, how I came across it. It was probably a submission to Progarchy, and I was reviewing for CatholicVote and The Imaginative Conservative, then, too. Man did I fall in love with that album or what? To me, it was (and remains) a perfect album. Composition, lyrics, mood . . . everything rock deserves. To this day, it remains one of my all-time favorite albums. And, it was a part of a trilogy of albums, including The Darkened Room from 2009 and Everlasting Instant from 2015. A trilogy of albums! Aside from Riverside and Glass Hammer, what band does this anymore? Dang, I loved it.\n\nAnd, here’s just a sampling of the lyrics from Crush of Night:\n\nI could run only half the way\n\nThough she loved me more than I can say\n\nHow could I falter?\n\nHow could I fall?\n\nThough I’d remember I would not call\n\nWhen I was young she said, “Pick out the toys\n\nThat you want\n\nI’ll see what I can do\n\nDid I take care of you?\n\nBy the way\n\nA dollar or two can go a very long way\n\nUse it to buy anything you want.”\n\nThe droning sound of the rosary\n\nEtched in my heart\n\nMore than a memory\n\nIn one of my more obnoxious (or daring!) moments, I wrote the band the year I was living in Colorado (2014-2015 academic year), and they responded by sending me several of their CDs! I still remember opening the mail box in Longmont and discovering such a rich treasure trove. It meant everything to me. This act of kindness predisposed me toward the band, of course, and I immediately back ordered everything–going all the way back to album no 1, 1998’s Sliver of the Sun. If these guys were going to support me, I was most certainly going to support them.\n\nTwo other things convinced me of IZZ’s greatness. First, I bought their live DVD, simply called IZZ LIVE, and I devoured it. [If amazon.com is to be believed, I ordered it on May 4, 2013] I couldn’t believe how cooly normal (and normally cool) these people looked. They didn’t look like long-haired metal heads but like normal, professional people. I would’ve been looking at a video of my history department colleagues. Yet, what they were doing on stage was definitely beyond normal. Cool, sure. But, not normal. Extraordinary passion and talent manifests itself in that DVD. It’s still one of my favorite live concerts, and I would’ve given a lot to have been there at the recording of it. Thank the Good Lord, they preserved the show.\n\nSecond, in 2012, I had also listened to and reviewed John Galgano’s gorgeous solo album, Real Life is Meeting. I thought Galgano was as great alone as he was in his band. The man simply brims with creativity and integrity. Then, we started corresponding through email and social media. Again, Galgano stunned me as a truly genuine person. I know almost as much about Galgano’s love of the Mets as I do about his love of prog!\n\nBut, Kevin, I’ll shut up for a minute and let you jump in.\n\nKevin: Well this is my first exposure to IZZ. What strikes me immediately is the variety of music on this new release, Collapse the Wave. The opening, “We Are 3rd,” is an expansive track that covers a lot of prog ground in its eight and a half minutes running. The keys and drums harken to mid-era Genesis with the guitars and melody lines more-styled on Yes’s similar mid-era work. The bass lines offer an excellent grounding to the dense textures and carry wonderful counter-melodies. And then about two-thirds of the way into it the tune opens up to expose a piano ostinato and glockenspiel in tandem and highlights the lyric:\n\nComing to the brink of change\n\nThe past is shifting out of range\n\nThe wind is at our back\n\nIt’s a beautiful moment and definitely one my favorite sections on the record.\n\nMusically there is a great deal of variety on the record. “We Are 3rd” and “Brace for Impact” have a relatively heavy guitar leads, but with many contrasting sections. “Brace for Impact” in particular has moments reminiscent of King Crimson’s angularities, which almost reprises in the final track “And We Will Go.” Elsewhere we hear solo piano accompanying voice in both “So Many Voices” and “Deep Inside.” The latter piece shifts into a folk-like arrangement with acoustic guitar and bass.\n\nThe title track, “Collapse the Wave” shows hints of jazz meeting Kansas at their most jam-bandish, eventually settling into an almost reggae back beat, the drums holding a tight groove. There are moments that even feel like latter-day XTC—a sound heard again later on the album in “Soak Up the Sunlight.”\n\nI really like the acoustic passages used by IZZ on this record. The aforementioned piano echoes later in the guitar intro to “Sometimes Sublime.” They definitely know how to shift between contrasting styles and thus melding them into their own sound.\n\nBrad: You’ve covered the music brilliantly, Kevin. Thank you! I love your analysis. I will admit, I’d not thought of Kansas and being a jam band. But, relistening to “Collapse the Wave,” I totally agree. This could be something (updated, of course) off of Leftoverature.\n\nAnd, speaking of jam bands, maybe there’s a bit of Phish in here! Oh, those East Coasters. . .\n\nI already noted this above, but when it comes to IZZ, I especially appreciate the vocals and the lyrics. That the band has three vocalists gives us a Yes “Leave It” or Yes, “All Good People” vibe. As much as I love the Galgano voices, I’m especially taken with Laura Meade. Her solo album from last year, The Most Dangerous Woman in America, remains a favorite, even though it’s a bit poppier than IZZ. It’s hard not to fall in love with her–arguably one of the greatest vocalists in rock music today.\n\nWell, there is so much more we could say about IZZ and Collapse the Wave. But, probably the best thing we can do is recommend it. And, we HIGHLY recommend it. Yes, I’m shouting at you. It comes out in a just a few days, and you can pre-order it here: https://izzmusic.bandcamp.com/album/collapse-the-wave\n\nWhat are you waiting for??? Pre order it!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOne of Brad Birzer’s favorite musical artists is The Flower Kings, and one of his favorite albums of theirs is Space Revolver. In this dialog, he and Tad Wert discuss that album and its place in their discography.\n\nTad: Brad, it’s good to be interacting with you again on Spirit of Cecilia! I chose this classic album, because I know it’s a favorite of yours.\n\nMy first exposure to The Flower Kings was their album, Stardust We Are, which I bought because of a Mojo Magazine article on “the new wave of progressive rock”. I have to admit that I tried repeatedly to listen to the whole album, and it never held my interest enough for me to do so. I know that you love Roine Stolt and his Flower Kings, so every time a new album was released, I gave it a try, but there were always other artists’ music that took my attention.\n\nThen, last week, I found an inexpensive copy of Space Revolver, and I don’t know exactly why, but I picked it up. Once I heard the opening chords of I Am The Sun Pt. 1, I was immediately taken with this album! I think Stolt (in my humble opinion), had hit upon a very good balance between power and grace in his music. As I continued to listen to the rest of the album, I was gratified to hear that that high quality of songwriting continued throughout.\n\nBrad: Dear Tad, it’s been too long, my friend. What have I been doing? Too much teaching of the American founding period and too much grading! Ha. No, of course, I love my teaching and my students, but they are distractions from my love of reviewing albums with you and my love of progressive rock! So glad to be done with the semester (and, frankly, it was a great one!!!) and back to reviewing with you. Ahh. . . the good life.\n\nYes, I’ve been a fan of The Flower Kings for a long time, now, and I’ve been an evangelist of the band just as long. Way back in the year 2000, a former student (now the head of our philosophy department) leant me a copy of Flower Power. I was immediately taken with it, and I bought everything available at the time by the band. I fell in love with everything. Absolutely everything, including Roine Stolt’s solo album, The Flower King (which, I assume is just a hippy-ish name for Jesus).\n\nCrazily enough, the band released Space Revolver on July 4th of that year. Coincidence? I have no idea, but it struck me as a perfect Fourth of July album. Especially with those queer lines in the first track–”I left my heart in San Francisco. I left my mind in San Francisco Bay.” Wow, did I laugh hard or what!!! 24 years later, the line still cracks me up.\n\nI’ve had the chance to correspond a bit with Stolt, and I even sent him some books on economics (by Wilhelm Roepke) before a longish tour he took. As far as I know, he took the books with him! How great is that? Frankly, I’d be happy to be his book supplier. At the time I sent him the Roepke books, he was really interested in an anti-Marxist form of economics, that is, the creation of more private property (small family farms) rather than less. Again, how great is that? “Ride this bitch, that is power!”\n\nAnyway, Tad, this is a long way of saying, I love the music, and I love the band. I think the world of both.\n\nTad: Okay, Brad, your off-hand remark about the Flower King being Jesus is something that I’ve wondered about for a while: is Roine a Christian? The 1994 album, Roine Stolt’s The Flower King, is steeped in religious imagery, specifically Christian, and, of course, he has collaborated with Neal Morse in Transatlantic. Anyway, if true, it helps make sense of a lot of his music!\n\nAlso, here’s something else that came to me while listening to Space Revolver – to my ears, it is a huge leap forward in songwriting from Stardust We Are, and I was wondering what might have caused it. Then it hit me: Space Revolver was written and recorded a few months after Stolt was involved in the first Transatlantic album SMPTE! I think Neal Morse must have had an influence on Stolt; that opening piano riff in I Am The Sun Pt. 1 is very Morsian (to coin a word!). Chicken Farmer Song, Underdog, A Slave To Money, and A King’s Prayer all feature outstanding melodies – they’re downright power poppish in their catchiness. Even the jam that closes out A King’s Prayer is focused and tight, with nary a wasted note.\n\nThe tootling mellotron that opens I Am The Sun Pt. 2 is one of my favorite moments of the entire album. I hear it, and I can’t help but smile and bob my head. Actually, the whole atmosphere of this album is one of joy. Stolt seems to be having the time of his life, and he wants the world to know it.\n\nI also want to single out Ulf Wallander’s soprano saxophone work for praise. I love that instrument, but in the wrong hands it can be very annoying. Wallander does a great job zipping off very pleasant improvisations that add a lot to the overall feel.\n\nThe only misstep on this album, in my opinion, is Hans Froberg’s You Don’t Know What You’ve Got, which sticks out like a sore thumb. It just doesn’t fit in with the rest of the album. That said, it’s not a bad song, it just doesn’t work for me in the context of the other tracks.\n\nOkay, I’ve raved enough; your turn!\n\nBrad: Tad, what a fun writeup. Thank you–I think you clearly identify the joy and playfulness that is so prevalent in Space Revolver. Stolt was clearly having the time of his life. I love all the other albums – in fact, I made a meme a years ago expressing what I loved about each album (see below) – and I’m especially taken with Flower Power (the first of theirs I heard) and Paradox Hotel. I really like Stardust We Are, too–but each of these other albums lacks the extreme playfulness of Space Revolver.\n\n[I made the above meme back when Desolation Rose came out. I was rather blown away by the album when it was released, but mostly because it was so intense and lacked the characteristic mischievousness of the previous albums. Indeed, when we were really active at Progarchy, I even planned out a book on the Flower Kings (never realized, except for some snippets, here or there), following the meme’s albums’s themes. I was planning on arguing that The Flower Kings were to Europe what Big Big Train was to England and what Glass Hammer was to America.\n\nThe book would’ve come out before my Neil Peart biography and even before what you and I, Tad, wrote on Big Big Train. I was, at the time, emailing with Stolt, and I was rather taken with him (still am) as an artist and as a human being. He was extremely active on Facebook at the time, as was his wife, and they were always interesting. We disagreed radically on the meaning and legacy of President Obama, but, again, he was always a total and intelligent gentleman.\n\nIt’s about the time I sent him the Roepke book.\n\nI did try to interview Stolt about Rush, but he very kindly responded that he didn’t know enough about the band to offer anything substantive. He was genuine, kind, and humane in his response.\n\nOne of many grand schemes never realized. . .]\n\n[Above photo, my fantasizing. In the middle of my then-Flower Kings collection, I’ve placed three of my own books, my biographies of (right to left) Christopher Dawson, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Yes, I desperately wanted my work to be tied to Roine Stolt and the Flower Kings. I thought–and still do–that if any of my biographies could reach the majesty of Stolt’s artistry, I would truly have made a mark on the world.]\n\nA few responses to you directly, Tad. It’s funny, I had always assumed that Neal Morse was influenced by Roine Stolt, rather than the other way around. And, Stolt, to me, seems deeply influenced by King Crimson, Yes, and Genesis. This seems especially clear on his solo, The Flower King, and Retropolis, both of which came before Transatlantic. But, I assume this is like a chicken or the egg question. At this point (2024), the two must’ve influenced each other so completely that one can’t any longer disentangle which idea or person came first. Together, Stolt and Morse are the heart of rambunctious third-wave prog.\n\nAs to Stolt being Christian, I have no idea. In our brief correspondence, I obnoxiously asked him directly about his faith, and he never responded or hinted, one way or the other. Being Swedish, he was almost certainly raised nominally Lutheran, even if the Swedes only attend services on Easter and Christmas.\n\nRegardless, Stolt employs Christian symbolism frequently, especially in the early The Flower King’s albums. Again, I think that “The Flower King” is a sort of hippie Cosmic Christ. Here are the lyrics from the first album:\n\nFalling out of the sky, falling into a dream\n\nAll I need is the heart where it all can begin\n\nIt’s just a matter of time, it’s just a matter of trust\n\nIt’s just a matter of faith when we all sleep in the dust\n\nDon’t deny, just verify the genius of it all\n\nIt’s the cycle of all living thing, hear the children\n\nHear the children call !\n\n“We believe in the light, we believe in love every precious little thing\n\nWe believe you can still surrender you can serve the Flower King”\n\nGoing out into the grey, into purple and red\n\nSee, all the beautiful shapes flowing out of my head\n\nIt’s just a matter of time, it’s just a matter of trust\n\nIt’s just a matter of faith when we all sleep in the dust\n\nDon’t deny, just verify the genius of it all\n\nIt’s the cycle of all living, hear the children\n\nHear the children call !\n\n“We believe in the light, we believe in love every precious little thing\n\nWe believe you can still surrender you can serve the Flower King”\n\n“We believe in the heart, we believe in healing in a house where angels sing\n\nWe’ll unite the divided and the fallen one will serve the Flower King”\n\n“We believe in the heart, we believe in healing in a house where angels sing\n\nWe’ll unite the divided and fallen one will serve the Flower King”\n\nAgain, I don’t quite think this is the orthodox Jesus Christ of Christian faith, but a rather humanistic but still supernatural Flower King. When the band becomes “The Flower Kings,” they’re not divinizing themselves but rather becoming disciples.\n\nWhat strikes me most, though, is that Stolt’s use of mythological symbols is not Lutheran, but deeply Roman Catholic.\n\nOn track four of Space Revolver, “Monster Within,” Stolt sings “Mother Mary, she’s left the building crying/silent tears rolling down her cheek.” Granted, this could just be a Beatles’ reference, but Mary, here, seems more supernatural than Paul McCartney’s mother. After all, Mary is the opposite of some kind of demagogue trying to seduce our children and who feeds on power and who controls the bats.\n\nOne of my favorite The Flower King’s albums, Unfold the Future, posits a war between the devil and Mary. On the final track:\n\nClueless\n\nLiving in a business cluster, predator to suit your needs\n\nRaven sitting on your shoulder, lurking the suburban weeds\n\nThink I saw you in the bank, think I saw you in a talkshow\n\nSwear I saw your mindless grin, justify the final blow\n\nSwallowing the endless laughter, cultivate the deadly sins\n\nGetting even altogether, hiding from the Holy Mother\n\nThis is how you raise the Cain, this is what you teach our children\n\nBack on duty dog eat dog, they’re clueless in the Devil’s playground\n\nThen, of course, on Space Revolver, on track 6, “Underdog,” there’s that really weird line/sound byte: “John Paul’s pizza, the biggest pizza you’ve ever seen.” When this album came out, in the year 2000, the only John Paul that mattered was John Paul II.\n\nSo, is Stolt Christian? I have no idea, but he’s an awesome ally, a man of integrity, and a grand myth maker. Taken together, this is so much what I love about Stolt and the band. Never once I have listened to them without my imagination being stimulated, expanded, and made manifest!\n\nTad: Wow, Brad! I knew you were a fan of Stolt, but I wasn’t aware of all the thought you’ve put into his music. I now have a much greater appreciation for his overall oeuvre than before. I think you’re probably correct about who influenced whom – Morse had to be aware of Stolt while he was in Spock’s Beard, and Stolt had to be aware of Morse. They likely influenced and appreciated each other, which led to the formation of another outstanding prog group, Transatlantic.\n\nI kind of like it that Stolt is mum about his faith; it allows different interpretations of his music. What’s important to me is that he seems to be a light-bearer, as opposed to a dark nihilist like so many Scandinavian death metal artists. Stolt is always positive and optimistic, even when he is singing about something he’s unhappy about. In that regard, Desolation Rose seems to be his “darkest” work, and it is still uplifting to my ears.\n\nSo here’s my takeaway on Space Revolver: it is the perfect introduction to The Flower Kings for someone who is new to them. In it, the group hits the perfect combination of melodicism, progginess, and improv jamming. Once you’ve absorbed this album, all the others make sense. They’ve had an amazingly productive run the past 30(!) years, and I hope they go for 30 more!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nGreetings, Spirit of Cecilia readers! In this post, Brad Birzer, Erik Heter, and Tad Wert revisit three progressive classics: Discipline, Beat, and Three of a Perfect Pair, from King Crimson.\n\nTad: Brad and Erik, I am so looking forward to hearing your thoughts on these albums! We haven’t really delved into the incredibly large and diverse discography of King Crimson, and Discipline is a personal favorite of mine. It came out in 1981, after most fans assumed Robert Fripp had put King Crimson to rest for good. As a matter of fact, on their previous album, the 1974 live set USA, Fripp put R.I.P. on the back cover. That album is another favorite of mine, featuring the formidable lineup of Fripp (guitar), Bill Bruford (percussion), John Wetton (bass and vocals), and David Cross (violin). This is the same group that recorded Lark’s Tongues In Aspic (with Jamie Muir added on percussion) and Starless and Bible Black. This group was ferocious in its ability to improvise, but apparently it was exhausting for all involved.\n\nSo it was quite surprising when word got out that Fripp was rehearsing a new lineup for King Crimson: Bruford (again), Tony Levin (bass and stick), and Adrian Belew (guitar and vocals). I was a subscriber to Musician magazine at the time, and it started running a series of “diary” entries from Fripp that detailed his excitement (and worries) about the music they were creating.\n\nAs interested as I was in what this new iteration of KC was going to sound like, nothing could have prepared me for Discipline. I was familiar with Belew from his work with Talking Heads and David Bowie, but I hadn’t heard him sing before. I knew Tony Levin was a much-in-demand bassist, but I didn’t realize how much of a pioneer he was with the Chapman Stick. The shift in style from Starless and Bible Black to Discipline is one of the most radical metamorphoses in rock history. And what is so impressive is that they pull it off – pleasing long time fans and attracting new wave listeners.\n\nWhen it came out, I was in college, and one of my suitemates got a copy. We listened to it several times in one evening, trying to understand what Fripp et al. were doing. To my ears, it was the perfect marriage of challenging, yet accessible rock. The cover art was understated and perfect: Bright red with a basic silver font simply stating, “King Crimson Discipline”, and a Celtic knot that isn’t easily untangled. Rhythmically, it was very straightforward. Melodically, it was almost minimalist in its composition, but it fit in comfortably with what groups like Talking Heads, The Police, Ultravox, and Simple Minds were producing. The more I listened, the more I was taken with it.\n\nOkay, I’ve rambled on for too long! How did Discipline strike you, Brad, when you first heard it?\n\nBrad: Tad, what a wonderful way to start us off. Thank you so much for your many good thoughts on this. Sadly, I won’t be able to match your good introduction. Yet, I loved reading about yours.\n\nThough I grew up with progressive rock–Yes, Jethro Tull, and Kansas, in particular–I knew nothing about King Crimson until my college years. I didn’t start college until 1986 (and the three Discipline-era albums had already come out), and I first encountered the band through a radio station copy of Beat and, in particular, the song “Neal and Jack and me”–which I instantly fell in love with.\n\nI remember being taken with the minimalist cover and diving into the music.\n\nAfter encountering it at the radio station, I purchased a copy of Beat, and, from there, I bought Discipline and Three of a Perfect Pair. To me, these three albums have to go together, one followed by another. I really have a hard time thinking of any one of the three–red, blue, and yellow–in isolation from the other. As such, I came VERY late to In the Court of the Crimson King, and the albums had progressed so much that I had a very hard time thinking of “my” King Crimson as the King Crimson of “In the Court. . .” Much later, I would buy Thrak–which has far more in common with Discipline-era King Crimson than the original King Crimson albums.\n\nI knew very little about Adrian Belew or Robert Fripp, but I’d been a long time fan of Bill Bruford because of Yes and Tony Levin because of Peter Gabriel. So, I was really curious as to what they were up to.\n\nAdditionally–should I admit this here???–though I never had a religious fundamentalist phase, I was returning to my childhood Catholicism (I’m what’s called a “revert” in Catholic circles) at the same time that I first encountered Discipline, Beat, and Three of a Perfect Pair, and I was really freaked out that the band named themselves after the devil! I thought, what a crazy thing to do. Why would you even mess with such a thing?\n\nThat stated. . .\n\nI’ll do my best to focus on Discipline, though, for this dialogue. Tad, for better or worse, I often think of Discipline-era King Crimson as New Wave Prog, in the same way I think of Rush’s Power Windows, Yes’s Drama, or The Fixx’s Reach the Beach. It’s definitely progressive, but in such an early 1980s way.\n\nTad: Brad, I agree that Discipline, Beat, and Three of a Perfect Pair make a seamless trilogy. It must have been deliberate – look at the artwork for them: same font with a single icon on each. As a lover of symmetry, I have always been bowled over by this series of album covers. I even framed them when I was first married, and my understanding wife let me hang them on our den wall!\n\nYour characterization of this music as New Wave Prog is perfect. I think you’ve created a hitherto unknown genre of music, but one that, with hindsight makes sense! At the time, it seemed to just fit in with all the weird and crazy music being produced in the early 80s.\n\nOkay, let’s discuss the songs on Discipline. It opens with “Elephant Talk”, in which Belew bellows,\n\n“Talk, it’s only talk\n\nArguments, agreements, advice, answers\n\nArticulate announcements\n\nIt’s only talk”\n\nwhile his guitar emits sheets of cascading sound. Levin lays down nimble basslines on his Stick, and Bruford plays a cacophonous yet steady racket on drums. All the while, Fripp is furiously pushing out scales on his guitar and creating a soundbed for the others to play on. Each verse is a list of synonyms for verbalizing in alphabetical order: the first is all A’s, the second all B’s, etc. This illustrates an aspect that I love so much about this iteration of KC: their sense of humor. Even though the music can be crushingly dense at times, there is a feeling of fun and sheer joy in it.\n\nErik: Like you, Brad, I was a latecomer to King Crimson – for the most part anyway. I do remember hearing Discipline once or twice when it first came out, but to use a Heinlein-ism, I absolutely did not grok it at all. So I put it aside for well over a decade and a half before finally revisiting it. In the meantime, I had purchased In the Court of the Crimson King, Lizard, and most importantly (for the purposes of priming the pump for Discipline), Larks Tongues in Aspic. While the latter is quite different from Discipline-era Crimson, if one listens close enough they can hear a few stylistic threads connecting them (and indeed, Three of a Perfect Pair includes Larks Tongues in Aspic Part III). If anything, I think the music of Discipline and the subsequent two albums is where they would have ended up anyway if they hadn’t broke up in 1974.\n\nAnother thing Brad – like Tad, I think your description of Discipline-era Crimson as New Wave Prog hits the nail on the head. The music has so much of that quality in other 80’s music that was described by the phrase once uttered by Yes’s Tony Kaye – dimensionally sparse. No previous Crimson album ever left as much space between the instruments as Discipline and its two successors did. This description applies to a majority of the album, with the notable exceptions of Indiscipline and Thela Hun Ginjeet. Because of this approach, Discipline fit in with the contemporaneous music of the early 80’s as well as the early Crimson albums fit in with that of the early 70s.\n\nWhat makes these albums familiar to Crimson fans was the presence of Fripp and Bruford, who were well-established by the release of Discipline. What made them fresh was the presence of newcomers Belew and Levin. Belew brought in the quirky, New Wave-y 80s vocal stylizations that he learned during his time with the decidedly non-prog Talking Heads. Meanwhile, Levin brought in not only a new way of playing bass, but also introduced to Crimson the Chapman stick and the new sounds that came with it. When it was all thrown into the same pot, the result was a type of music that was eclectic and often intricate.\n\nIf I had to pick some favorite songs off of the album, there are three that really stand out to me. First is the easy, breezy Matte Kudasai, the uptempo romp of Thela Hun Ginjeet, and the instrumental The Sheltering Sky. The latter two of these tracks include some of the best percussion work Bill Bruford has ever performed in any of the bands he’s been in – which is quite a statement considering his pedigree. In Thela Hun Ginjeet, Brufords drumming comes in fast and furious yet with exquisite precision. In The Sheltering Sky, Bruford’s percussion is almost understated and yet still manages to demand the listener’s attention. This track also includes both Belew and Fripp on the weird, wonderful guitar synthesizer.\n\nI’m still relatively new to the latter two albums of this trio, so I’ll visit those in my next entry. For now, back to you guys!\n\nTad: Erik, thank you for your insights on this album! I’m glad you brought attention to Bruford’s contributions. One thing I remember from those articles Fripp published in Musician is how he kept trying to rein in Bruford, because he wanted this music to be disciplined.\n\nIf I had to pick my favorite songs, it would be “Frame By Frame” and “The Sheltering Sky”. In the former, I really like the relentless groove that Fripp, Levin, and Belew set up, while Belew’s and Levin’s vocals hover delicately above it all.\n\nI agree with you about Bruford’s excellent percussion work in “The Sheltering Sky” – I have a DVD of a concert they performed at the time this album came out, and Bruford is masterful on congas while Fripp wigs out on guitar. I love the way the song takes its time building – it’s quite a while before Levin enters on Stick, and when he does, it brings the music to another level. I don’t think Fripp ever had another guitarist as empathetic as Belew was with him. The two of them traded phrases off each other as if they were of one mind.\n\nFun fact: “Thela Hun Ginjeet” is an anagram for “Heat In The Jungle”!\n\nBrad: Dear Tad and Erik, what excellent responses. One of the things I love most about Discipline is that it starts off with the utterly bizarre “Elephant Talk.” The band could’ve easily and victoriously started the album with the much more radio and listener friendly “Frame by Frame.”\n\nInstead, they begin with the offbeat one. Again, I love this about the band. They definitely define their own path.\n\nI’m not sure I have specifics about this album. Again, to me, it’s an intimate part of a trilogy of releases, and, Tad, I love that you had the artwork displayed. What would we do without our loving and forgiving wives!\n\nAnd, I would agree, my favorites among these tracks are “Frame by Frame” with its relentless roar, and “The Sheltering Sky” which feels like a Talk Talk song from the same period, at least in terms of its rhythm.\n\nI mentioned this above, but my favorite album of the trilogy is Beat, as it combines the weirdness of “Elephant Talk” with the accessible and intense sounds of “Frame by Frame.”\n\n“I’m a 1952 Studebacker coupe!”\n\nBut, I also really love the title track of Three of a Perfect Pair. So wonderfully quirky.\n\nTad: It’s a tough call, but I think this iteration of King Crimson is my favorite. At least, I come back to these three albums more than any others in Crimson’s long, long career. I don’t think Fripp ever assembled a more talented crew than these four guys, and they are at the top of their game. I never saw them live, but as I mentioned, I have a couple of concerts on DVD, and they make this difficult music look effortless.\n\nAs I have revisited this trio of albums in order, I’m struck by how much the “accessible” songs sound more accessible, while the “out-there” songs are more and more out-there. Brad, maybe that’s why Beat is your favorite – it hits the sweet spot between pop and experiment. While it contains beautiful and gentle love songs like “Heartbeat” and “Two Hands” it also has the atonal and terrifying “Requiem”. I think that’s why this iteration of King Crimson packed it in after Three of a Perfect Pair; by the third album, “things fell apart; the center couldn’t hold” (to paraphrase Yeats!). That album contains their most pop song ever, “Sleepless”, while also giving us “Industry”, which is close to pure noise in places.\n\nErik: While my familiarity with Discipline dates back to about the mid-90s, Beat and Three of a Perfect Pair are both relatively new to me. Yet one thing that strikes me is the consistency of sound across these albums – it’s almost as if they could have all been released as one triple album instead of as three separate albums. From a production standpoint, these albums really stand out as being of a particular time. One odd thought I’ve had listening to these – particularly Beat – is how similar the production (not the music!) was to the first two solo albums of Robert Plant. Indeed, I had to go back and look it up to find out who the respective producers were, but they were different. It must have been just something in the air at the time.\n\nAnother observation about these three albums – they mark some of the best, if not the best work of Bill Bruford in his entire career. As a hardcore Yes fan, I do not say that lightly. One great example of this is Sartori in Tangier from Beat (which, for some reason, I keep reading as Santoni the Tiger … I think I need some Frosted Flakes, but I digress). Another is Sleepless from Three of a Perfect Pair. Sleepless is also one of the songs in this trio that includes Tony Levin’s use of the Chapman Stick, along with Neurotica and The Howler (from Beat), as well as Industry and the title track of Three of a Perfect Pair.\n\nAll that said, by the end of Three of a Perfect Pair, I start to hear a certain sameness in the music, and thus it’s not surprising to me in retrospect that Fripp broke up the band again. Maybe that’s just how Fripp worked best, in bursts followed by long breaks. I do get the impression he wasn’t easy to work with, and have read that both Bruford and Belew were a bit miffed when Fripp split them up again in 1984.\n\nThat being said, I don’t want to close on a sour note, so here goes. You guys, being in the same age range as me, might remember the early 80s TV show Fridays, which was basically ABCs attempt at creating their own version of Saturday Night Live. Both had the same format – sketch comedy, a “news” break, and musical guests. And on one glorious night during the 81-82 timeframe, they had as their musical guests Fripp, Belew, Levin and Bruford, under their collective name of King Crimson – preserved for posterity thanks to YouTube. Enjoy!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThere are a select few artists that Spirit of Cecilia will always love and greet with joy any new release. One of them is Big Big Train, who have just released a new album, The Likes Of Us. Big Big Fanboys Brad Birzer and Tad Wert discuss this latest chapter in their long and varied career, and what it means for BBT’s future.\n\nTad: Brad, my fellow Progling and good friend, it’s always big news when Big Big Train graces us with new music. I have you to thank for making me aware of this wonderful group of musicians. It was when The Underfall Yard had just been released, and we were connecting via social media. You insisted I check them out. I had never heard of BBT, and it was an ear-opening experience to explore all of their music. I fell in love with The Difference Machine along with The Underfall Yard, and the rest is history.\n\nAs I became familiar with their career, I soon learned that The Underfall Yard was the first album to feature vocalist David Longden. He, along with founding member Greg Spawton, went on to produce some of the finest albums of the 2010’s: English Electric, Folklore, Grimspound, Grand Tour, Common Ground. And then tragically, David Longden passed away. I was afraid this was the end for BBT as we knew them.\n\nHowever, they found a new vocalist, Alberto Bravin, and have recorded a new album! Brad, I’m really interested in hearing your first impressions of this iteration of BBT. Is it a worthy successor to previous ones?\n\nBrad: Dear Tad, thank you so much for this, and my apologies (as usual) for being late in replying. Things have been chaotic (good and bad chaos, it turns out–one so quickly and readily becomes the other) in the Birzer household. Let’s just say, I’m not unhappy to see February 2024 in the rear-view mirror, and that all ills (flu and otherwise) have found happy resolutions!\n\nAs I type this on my laptop, I sit beneath an original Jim Trainer painting from The Underfall Yard that proudly adorns my college office. Below it is an award I won over twenty years ago, and above it is an original photo of Geronimo. Next to it is a signed and framed autograph from Neil Peart.\n\nI first encountered The Underfall Yard fifteen years ago. Our very own Carl Olson sent me a mix of his favorite tracks of 2009, and a song from the TUY album was included. To say I was floored would be the understatement of my adult life. I immediately ordered the full album, and I was completely blown away by its brilliance, its creativity, and its unique voice. As to the latter, there’s nothing quite like a classic BBT sound–a perfect mixture of exhilaration and melancholy. I also immediately emailed Greg Spawton, who kindly responded. For years, we had a fairly serious correspondence. We even sent each other books we each loved. I cherish those emails and that friendship.\n\nFrom there, I closely followed the band, and, as I’ve noted elsewhere, we founded Progarchy originally as a BBT fansite. Years later, you and I collected our various essays on the band and e-published Dream of the West through Amazon. That little e-book did very well, I’m proud to say, and I’m deeply honored that our names will always be linked together, Tad. I also had the chance to praise them at National Review, at The Imaginative Conservative, and elsewhere.\n\nThis is all a very long way of stating that I’ve followed the band as closely as possible for a decade and a half. I’ve cheered with and for them, and, with the immense loss of David Longdon, I’ve mourned with and for them.\n\nThey’ve been a part of my life as much as anything else (except for family) over the past fifteen years.\n\nThis past weekend, BBT played its very first show in the United States. It was in Fort Wayne, Indiana–just a 1.5 hour drive for me–but I was, crazily, already committed to leading a seminar/conference in Philadelphia, a commitment I made.\n\nOk, Birzer, shut up and tell us about the new album!!!\n\nTo be sure, BBT has had a rough couple of years, and many folks have wondered if the band could recover after the tragic loss of vocalist David Longdon. Additionally, many of the essential bandmates–such as David Gregory–had left the band for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe Likes of Us proves that BBT is more than the sum of its parts, an idea and concept as much as a concrete band. Whereas the band was once incredibly and quirkily English, it is now quite cosmopolitan and, well, trans-Atlantic. I write this last bit with only the slightest bit of irony, as the new album has, in part, a Neal Morse/Spock’s Beard feel to it.\n\nTad: Brad, as always, I appreciate the context you provide for your love of BBT. I think you have hit the nail on the head with your preceding paragraph: Big Big Train is an idea and concept now, much like King Crimson and Yes are. The personnel may change, but there is definitely a constant thread through all of their albums that makes each one a uniquely “BBT” work.\n\nAs I write this, I am listening to “Beneath the Masts”, Greg Spawton’s ode to the radio masts that dominated the landscape of his childhood. As long as Greg is involved, BBT will always be BBT. He truly has been the anchor of the band, regardless of who sings or plays guitar.\n\nI am intrigued with your reference to Neal Morse/Spock’s Beard. I love their music as well, but it has always been more, hmm… turbulent, than BBT’s in my opinion. BBT’s music has, until this album, always struck me as being pastoral. Kind of like Vaughan Williams’ music is in the classical realm. I could see BBT performing “The Lark Ascending”, but never Spock’s Beard, if that makes sense!\n\nOkay, let’s talk about The Likes Of Us! I love the opening chords of the first song, “Light Left In The Day” – the acoustic guitars are reminiscent of Steve Hackett-era Genesis. It soon develops into quite a majestic production, and, now that you’ve mentioned it, I really hear that Morse influence in it. Another favorite moment is the seamless segue into “Oblivion”, which is a terrific rocker. According to my Spotify app, I’m not alone in really liking this track – it far and away has the most listens. I think it’s a great choice for the single, because the melody is so appealing. Bravin’s vocals are superb here, and despite my initial impulse to compare him unfavorably to Longdon, I think he does a fantastic job leading the band. He’s a wonderful choice to replace an irreplaceable artist, and I am excited for BBT’s future.\n\n“Beneath the Masts” is the big epic, clocking in at 17:26. I have to admit that after several listens, this one hasn’t resonated as deeply with me as previous long-form BBT songs have. It’s very pretty, and there is nothing to not love, but for some reason it’s just not sticking in my memory. However, I do especially like the bit at around the 15:00 minute mark where, after a relatively quiet section, the whole band comes in again and Bravin lets loose with some very good vocals.\n\n“Skates On” reminds me the most of “classic Big Big Train”. It’s just a delightful little tune with wonderful vocal harmonies. The lyrics celebrate going out and having some fun: “Enjoy the Ride/It’s time to get your skates on/We’re here then gone”. I think the more I listen to the album, the more I enjoy this track.\n\nAlright, I’ve written enough – what are your thoughts on the new songs?\n\nBrad: What a wonderful and thoughtful response, Tad. Thank you. Whenever I get a new album–especially if you and I decide to review it–I immerse myself into it fully, allowing it to wash over me multiple times before writing about it. For whatever reason, I had a really hard time getting into The Likes of Us the first few times I listened to it. I definitely heard a Spock’s Beard influence (the new singer sounds VERY much like Nick D’Virgilio), but my initial thoughts were that the band–now labeled as an “international progressive rock collective” had lost its distinctive English voice and that the band was producing someone one might call “generic prog.”\n\nAs I’ve continued to listen to the album, though, I think I was very wrong in my initial assessment. The band has definitely lost its distinctive English voice, but it has also adopted a new one and one that is truly international. And, frankly, it’s quite beautiful in its own, new way. The band really has become something more than it was.\n\nAnd, you’re right, of course, Tad. The center of the band–from its beginning–has always been Greg Spawton. He’s the touchstone and fountainhead of all things BBT. With his bass, his songwriting, and his voice, he will always define BBT whatever other members are there. I’m so glad you reminded all of us of that.\n\nThis said, I’m now utterly taken with the first three tracks of The Likes of Us: “Light Left in the Day” (a pastoral gem for the first few minutes), “Oblivion” (a NVD rocker), and the magisterial “Beneath the Masts” (what BBT does best–long-form prog). Like you, Tad, I love the segue between tracks one and two, and I also agree that “Beneath the Masts,” while excellent, does not quite live up to “Broken English,” “The Wide Open Sea,” or “The Underfall Yard.” Still, it’s close, and, frankly, it’s a privilege to hear such prog beauty, especially when it comes from Spawton’s pen.\n\nAs you note, “Skates On” is simply a delight, something that might have appeared on Grimspound or The Second Brightest Star.\n\nTad: Brad, I’m glad you have had a slight reassessment of the album, and it looks like you and I are in agreement that the first “side” (if albums can have “sides” these days) is really nice. As far as the final four tracks go, “Miramare” is the standout song for me. The vocal harmonies are wonderful, and the guitar solo is very tasteful.\n\nIn the press release that came with the album, the band remarks that this is the first time in a long time that the members recorded the songs together in the same room: In May 2023, six members of Big Big Train left their homes in England (Spawton and Lindley), the United States (D’Virgilio), Sweden (Sjöblom) and Norway (Holldorff) to gather for a week in Bravin’s home town of Trieste in north eastern Italy, at Urban Recording, a studio recommended by Alberto, to lay down the basic tracks. Being face to face in a room, as opposed to emailing sound files, the intimacy of the process generated moments of inspiration that would otherwise have gone unheard.\n\nThe process would prove emotional. “There were some tears; I cried a few of my own,” recalls Nick D’Virgillio, the band’s drummer since 2009. “There are many reasons to explain why we hadn’t worked that way in quite a while, but the process brought out the best in everybody.”\n\nI’m glad that they took the time and trouble to work in person – that bodes well for future music. I always think songs are improved when musicians can bounce ideas off each other in real time.\n\nWell, I think that is a good place to wrap this one up, Brad. I’m going to say that The Likes of Us will probably be thought of as a transitional album when put in the context of their long career; they have successfully incorporated a new vocalist/songwriter into the fold, while maintaining ties to their past. It will be interesting to see what they produce in the years to come!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nGreetings, Spirit of Cecilia music lovers! In this post, Brad Birzer and Tad Wert revisit a classic No-Man album, Schoolyard Ghosts, from 2008.\n\nTad: Brad, I’m so glad you suggested we discuss this album. I picked it up when it first came out. I had just discovered Steven Wilson’s Porcupine Tree, and I was snapping up anything I could find that he was involved in. No-Man is certainly different from Porcupine Tree, but Wilson and Tim Bowness make beautiful music in their own way.\n\nAs I listened to this album once again, I was struck by how calming it is (with the exception of that raucous opening to “Pigeon Drummer”). For me, “Truenorth” is the standout track. When I first got Schoolyard Ghosts, I didn’t take the time to appreciate how great a song it is. It slowly unfolds for nearly 13 minutes, but it never lags. Tim’s vocals are so hushed and warm, while Steven’s acoustic guitar accompaniment is perfect.\n\nBrad: Tad, thanks so much for such a brilliant opening to this dialogue. I think you nailed it all very perceptively. And, I’m with you on all of this.\n\nThe best way to describe the music is, as you so aptly put it, “hushed and warm.” Delicate and lush also come to mind as descriptives as well, though delicate might be taken as derogatory by some readers. I certainly mean it in only the most positive sense.\n\nThis was my first No-man album, and, at the time it came out, I was buying basically everything that the label Kscope was producing. I had already been a Steven Wilson fan–since 2002–but I’d not delved into No-man for some reason. Porcupine Tree, yes. Blackfield, yes. But, bewilderingly, not No-man. This, of course, all changed with Schoolyard Ghosts.\n\nIndeed, Schoolyard Ghosts rather blew me away in 2008, and it continues to do so over a decade and a half later. I never grow tired of this album. I love the lilt of the instruments, Bowness’s plaintively gorgeous vocals, and the fine production of the music. I also love the vocal harmonies that Bowness and Wilson create.\n\nI can state now, in 2024, that I’m as much a fan of Tim Bowness as I am of Steven Wilson–which is saying a lot for anyone who knows me.\n\nSince 2008, I’ve pretty much devoured everything that Bowness has written and released. I’ve come to the conclusion that he’s our generation’s Mark Hollis. He was definitely influenced by Hollis and Talk Talk. One can hear it in his phrasing and in his lyrics. It’s clear that Bowness is in love with words as much as he is with music.\n\nBowness also reminds me very much of our own Kevin McCormick. What an incredible team they would make.\n\nTad: Yes, Brad, the ghost of Mark Hollis is definitely present here! I find it interesting that Schoolyard Ghosts was your first introduction to No-Man. Mine was 1994’s Flowermouth, which was the only No-Man title available at my local used record store. It’s very poppy – almost like Pet Shop Boys – and as I completed my No-Man collection, it became clear that every album had its own unique identity. Initially, I was disappointed that Bowness and Wilson didn’t sound more like Porcupine Tree, but why should they? Wilson has always been a lover of many different genres, and No-Man was a completely different entity for him than PT. As a matter of fact, No-Man was more popular, sales-wise, than PT, which, at the time, was more of a side project.\n\nOkay! Back to the topic at hand. I’ve been listening to the 5.1 surround mix of Schoolyard Ghosts, and it is really good. There are no obvious “whooshes” from front speakers to back and left to right, but rather various sounds pop up and fade away behind me, like the static that closes out “All Sweet Things”, the steel guitar in “Song of the Surf”, or some gentle beeps in “Streaming”. The percussion in the middle section of “Truenorth” has enhanced echo, which is nice.\n\nSpeaking of “Truenorth”, I have to say again that this is a near-perfect song! The 12:48 album version puts the single version to shame. I love the “Sweet surrender to the night” section that closes it out – it brings the song to such a melodically satisfying conclusion.\n\nThe only – literally – jarring song on the album for me is “Pigeon Drummer”. In the right context, I can appreciate raucous dissonance, but “Pigeon Drummer” feels out of place on this album. Based on Wilson’s and Bowness’s delightful podcast, The Album Years, I know they both love avant-garde music and musique concrete. However, I think that song messes with the overall flow of the album. Tell me why I’m wrong, Brad!\n\nBrad: Tad, I’m really impressed that you go all the way back to 1994’s Flowermouth. Do you remember how you came to it? I’d love to read that story.\n\nI don’t want to make too much of the Talk Talk connection, but I really feel that “Pigeon Drummer” is No-man’s take on “Desire” from Spirit of Eden. In that context, to me at least, the song makes perfect sense as a necessary break in an otherwise very delicate and haunting flow. It’s intentionally jarring, thus making the rest of the album even more beautiful. In fact, one of the many things I love about this album is the intensity of the overall flow.\n\nI’m in complete agreement with you regarding “Truenorth.” It is a stunning piece of music, perhaps perfect, even. It builds so well. I must admit, it reminds me of an updated Traffic tune. Not as jazzy as Traffic, of course, but still in a Steve Winwood/Dave Mason vein. And, I love the lyrics:\n\nYou survived another winter\n\nYou survived where nothing grew\n\nThe days felt cold and never changing\n\nSo you just slept the whole way through\n\nWhen you think about the future\n\nIt’s like the past, but hard and small\n\nAn old idea you stole from someone\n\nA borrowed dream that’s born to fall\n\nTake a taxi through the snow\n\nTell them you love them –\n\nDon’t let go\n\nThrough the tunnel moving slow\n\nTonight’s there’s nowhere\n\nYou won’t go\n\nYou survived yourself\n\nYou survived inside the lost world\n\nThe dreams of love\n\nAnd, to be sure, I really love the lyrics to the opening track, “All Sweet Things”:\n\nThe run-down streets, the civil wars\n\nYou don’t go there anymore –\n\nIt’s how you used to live\n\nThe trampled hopes, the made-up laws\n\nThe itchy feet, the pub quiz bores –\n\nIt’s so hard to forgive\n\nWeekend slimmers count their chains\n\nStill wanting someone else to blame\n\nYou watch them come and go\n\nEmpty nightclub escapades\n\nThey tell you more than words can say –\n\nThat open doors get closed\n\nThe empty rooms, the empty house\n\nSomeday soon, you’ll work it out –\n\nStill finding the way back home\n\nThe schoolyard ghosts, the playtime fears\n\nYou take your pills, they disappear –\n\nThe people that you’ve known\n\nI’m curious who wrote these, Bowness or Wilson. Either way, they’re fantastic.\n\nTad: Brad, Flowermouth was my introduction to No-Man, because it was the only No-Man album I could find at the record store, and I couldn’t wait for it to be delivered from an online dealer!\n\nThank you for sharing the lyrics to “Truenorth” and “All Sweet Things”. I think Bowness must have written the ones to “Truenorth” at least, because there is a sweetness (for lack of a better word) to them that I can’t see Wilson pulling off. His lyrics are usually much darker, which is why he might have had a hand in “All Sweet Things”.\n\n“All Sweet Things” is my second-favorite song on Schoolyard Ghosts. It’s a nice opening track, because it sets the mood for the entire album. It has a beautiful melody which slowly unfolds. The mostly acoustic instrumentation is very warm (there’s that adjective again!) and inviting.\n\nI’ll concede your point in defending “Pigeon Drummer”. Without the tension it adds to the overall mix, the album would probably suffer from a sameness in style and atmosphere. You can’t appreciate calm beauty without a little harshness to get through!\n\nBrad: Tad, thanks for such a great dialogue. I was really happy to revisit Schoolyard Ghosts, and it’s always excellent “talking” music with you. As you’ve pointed out here and elsewhere, modern music simply would not be where it is without Bowness and Wilson. Each have contributed so much–as creative talents and as analysts. The current issue of PROG magazine has an excellent article on early No-man. As Wilson notes, the two would rather talk Spirit of Eden than hit the club scene. Amen.\n\nTad: Amen, indeed!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIn this post, Kevin McCormick and Tad Wert discuss The Bardic Depths’ new album, What We Really Like In Stories. It is the third album from them, and it features songwriting by Dave Bandana and Gareth Cole, with lyrics by Bradley Birzer.\n\nTad: Kevin, it’s great to be reviewing this album with you! I know you and Brad go way back in your friendship – did you ever imagine he would someday be the lyricist for a British progressive rock group?\n\nKevin: Thanks Tad–great to be writing it with you as well. It was definitely a surprise when Brad first mentioned he was writing lyrics for a rock recording—we had a good laugh! But in retrospect it seems a natural step. We shared a love of the early prog music from the start of our friendship and he writes constantly, albeit in a more academic setting than rock lyrics. So it’s not as much of a stretch as you might think. One of his favorite aspects of Tolkien’s and Chesterton’s writings are their poems. And he’s a huge fan of T.S. Eliot. But I think his collaboration with Dave on the Bardic Depths albums is a great fit and I’ve enjoyed watching the development of the concepts and sounds over the years. You know, the first album started out as just a friendly experiment. Dave had some music he had written and asked Brad for a lyric to put with it.\n\nTad: Kevin, I always enjoy learning the “behind the scenes” details of albums, so thanks for sharing those.\n\nOkay! Let’s talk about What We Really Like In Stories. As I mentioned, this is the third album from The Bardic Depths, and I think they just improve with every release. I really, really like this one. First, I think these are the best lyrics Brad has written yet. Every song is a tribute to an author, and taken as a collection they illustrate Brad’s love for various genres, primarily fantasy and science fiction. The title track refers to C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, who are responsible for two of the most popular fantasy series of the twentieth century: The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings, respectively. Birzer imagines them discussing their literary aims over a drink and a smoke in the local pub:\n\nCould we write fiction\n\nThat might combine these things:\n\nA love of history; a desire to debate the defenders of the modern world\n\nPromote one’s philosophical and religious thoughts\n\nCould a modern writer create art but not be over blatant?\n\n“You’ve Written Poetry My Boy” is about Ray Bradbury (The Martian Chronicles, Something Wicked This Way Comes, The Illustrated Man, among many others), and refers to some praise that Aldous Huxley gave him. “Vendetta” is dedicated to Alan Moore, who put together the graphic novel, V for Vendetta. “Old Delights” is a delightful little song in honor of midwestern American author Willa Cather, while “The Feast Is Over” recognizes the genius of pulp writer Robert E. Howard (Conan the Barbarian stories). “Stillpoint” pays tribute to Walter M. Miller (A Canticle for Leibowitz), and the last track is about British fantasist Robert Rankin.\n\nIn other words, this is a very literate collection of songs, and they celebrate some of the greatest bards of modern times. I was an avid reader of Bradbury, Lewis, Tolkien, Howard, and Miller when I was in high school, so it is a joy to see them properly honored by The Bardic Depths. I’m not familiar with Rankin’s work, but I am certainly going to check him out now.\n\nKevin: Without a doubt this new album is a real step forward for the band. Everything from the songwriting, to the instrumental performances, to the production is excellent. You can see the maturation process as the band really seems to blend and complement one another so well. The vocal harmonies are tight and solid. The lead lines are powerful and expressive and carry the songs into new spaces.\n\nI think my favorite track at the moment is “You’ve Written Poetry My Boy.” It opens with a beautiful arpeggiating twelve-string guitar evoking memories of early Genesis. But it is soon joined by an equally-beautiful soprano sax (if this is a keyboard patch it’s an extremely natural sound). The unlikely pairing dance around each other’s lines and set up the entrance to the tune proper. Again there are hints of Genesis here, but the band seems to have found a sound of their own. And I love the variety in the instrumentation–string pads, piano, organ, and I think I hear some harpsichord in there. And then mid-song there is a shift to a minor section which briefly darkens the mood and serves as a platform for a sax solo, only to pass through back to the main theme. Shifts like this can be clunky sometimes in prog bands, but TBD avoid this pitfall by carefully crafting the transition compositionally.\n\nOverall I must say that I hear hints and suggestions of so many great prog bands throughout this album. Those hints position the album in a space that sits well with other classic recordings yet still retains its own voice. Moments of the Floyd and Supertramp peak out here and there, and there’s a bluesy hard rock sensibility in the final track, “Whispers In Space,” and some even some techno in Stillpoint. Some of the vocal work has shades of Big Big Train. But again, there is a TBD color in the sound that holds everything together as a part of the larger work.\n\nTad: Kevin, I knew you had excellent taste – “You’ve Written Poetry My Boy” is my favorite track as well! And that is Peter Jones on clarinet and alto sax. I too hear glimmers of classic Genesis (the Steve Hackett years) in this song, and I find that very appealing. There’s no wonder they chose this track to be the first single.\n\nI also want to give a shoutout to Gareth Cole’s guitar work throughout the album – it is truly stellar. His solos in Vendetta are spectacular – driving, melodic, and pure. His slide guitar in “The Feast Is Over” is terrific!\n\nTo wrap things up, I think we can agree that What We Really Like In Stories is a big leap forward for a group that improves upon excellence. They seem to have really gelled as a unit – Dave Bandana, Gareth Cole, and Brad Birzer are at the top of their form as far as songwriting goes, and Peter Jones’ vocal and instrumental contributions are wonderful. I also like Dave’s vocals on “The Feast Is Over” – he’s got an “everyman” sound that is quite inviting.\n\nBefore we close, I’d like to mention how interesting Kevin Thompson’s artwork is. The style is somewhat primitive and whimsical, which complements the songs perfectly. Stylistically, it reminds me of the cover art for the Beach Boys’ Smile album. Thompson’s painting is of a cozy room with a fire blazing away, and piles of books on a table. The authors are the ones featured in the songs, and there are needlepoint hanging that spell out the “The Bardic Depths” and “What We Really Like In Stories”. I’m intrigued by the clock on the mantel: the numbers aren’t the standard 1 through 12! Instead, they run 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37.\n\nWhat We Really Like In Stories is a contender for album of the year in my book. The subject matter of the songs is thought-provoking while remaining playful, while the musicianship is first-rate. This is one album I’ll be enjoying for years to come.\n\nHere’s the video for “You’ve Written Poetry My Boy”:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
