Smith is known for wearing death-white facial makeup, crimson lipstick, and teased black hair; he is rivaled only by Morrissey as a heartthrob for the discontented.\n\nRobert Smith grew up in working-class Crawley, Sussex, a suburb of London. He recalls his childhood years as difficult, a time of run-ins with his parents and the law. At 17 he formed the Easy Cure with childhood friends Laurence Tolhurst and Michael Dempsey as a sort of catharsis for his feelings of frustration. The group’s music has remained therapeutic for Smith.\n\nThe Cure made its initial splash in the U.K. with the 1979 single “Killing an Arab,” which stirred controversy when it reappeared on the mid-Eighties retrospective Standing on a Beach: The Singles. Some U.S. radio DJs used the song, which was inspired by Albert Camus’ The Stranger, to advance anti-Arab sentiments; the group included a disclaimer with subsequent pressings stating that the song “decries the existence of all prejudice and consequent violence.”\n\nWhile the Cure toured in 1979 as the support act to Siouxsie and the Banshees, the headliner’s guitarist quit the band. Smith was recruited to fill in on the tour, beginning an active collaboration with the Banshees. He ultimately devoted much of 1983-84 as a full-time member of the band, recording both the live Nocturne and a studio album, Hyaena. In 1983, he also joined Banshees bassist Steve Severin for a side project called the Glove, releasing one album, Blue Sunshine.\n\nWhen Smith once again devoted himself to the Cure, the music evolved from the sparse punk pop of that song and other early singles (“Boys Don’t Cry,” “Jumping Someone Else’s Train,” “The Lovecats”) to the dirgy, moody music of Faith and Seventeen Seconds, to the more focused hits on the later albums Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Disintegration, and Wish.\n\nAlso that year, MTV honored the band with its Icon award. All was not well within the group, however, and following the tumultuous self-titled release the band, for all intents and purposes, broke up. The hiatus was short-lived — one year later a reconstituted Cure returned. Roger O’Donnell and Pery Bamonte were out, former member Porl Thompson was back in, and Simon Gallup and Jason Cooper remained intact. In 2005, the Cure recorded a version of John Lennon’s “Love” for an Amnesty International charity album.\n\nIn October 2008, the Cure released their thirteenth studio album, 4:13 Dream. What began as a double album was gradually whittled down to 13 songs, and the group embarked on a world tour shortly thereafter, reinventing classic songs to suit the leaner lineup.\n\n__________\n\nContact The Cure Manager or Agent | You May Ask?\n\nHow can I hire The Cure for a corporate event, non-profit or charity event or private performance?
