        "text": "Filmmaker Brad Katz is appealing to music fans to help fund his documentary ‘Just Gimme Indie Rock! The Story of an Underground Uprising,’ a film project he describes as ‘an epic trilogy that spans a generation’ — tracing the rise of the independent label scene in the early ’80s through the alternative explosion of the ’90s and into indie resurgence of the 2000s.\n\nThis week’s installment of Slicing Up Eyeballs on Strangeways Radio featured two new Depeche Mode remixes, new live tracks from Primal Scream and Marshall Crenshaw, plus old favorites by The Mission, Red Lorry Yellow Lorry, Sugar, Dinosaur Jr and Echo & The Bunnymen.\n\nThe Cure has just wrapped up a 44-song, nearly four-hour performance at Australia’s famed Sydney Opera House — a concert that found Robert Smith & Co. running through the band’s first three albums in their entirety and reuniting with former keyboardists Lol Tolhurst and Roger O’Donnell.\n\nTo celebrate the release today of Primal Scream’s CD/DVD set ‘Screamadelica Live’ — filmed/recorded last fall during a performance of the band’s landmark 1991 album ‘Screamadelica’ in London — the folks at Universal Music have given us three copies to award to lucky Slicing Up Eyeballs readers.\n\nThis week’s new releases include concert DVDs/Blu-rays from Primal Scream and David Byrne; a live album of Peter Hook performing ‘Unknown Pleasures’; a reissue of Elvis Costello’s ‘Get Happy!!’ on audiophile vinyl; and the U.S. CD release of Kate Bush’s ‘Director’s Cut.’\n\nFor two months, Depeche Mode has been teasing ‘Remixes 2: 81-11’ with a series of pre-release streams of mixes from the set, but they’ve avoided releasing the two most buzzed-about tracks — new mixes by former band members Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder. Now they’ve leaked.\n\nToday we mark another milestone as goth high priestess Siouxsie Sioux turns 54; to celebrate her birthday, we present the 12-song concert portion from the DVD release of The Banshees’ classic ‘Nocturne’ home video, filmed in 1983.\n\nLast month, we brought you a free download of a haunting dream-pop cover of The Cure’s ‘Disintegration’ — and now we can offer another contemporary take on a Robert Smith & Co. classic. This time it’s a dark, house-influenced cover of ‘A Forest’ by Denver-based electronic trio Ping Trace.\n\nWith his autobiography ‘See A Little Light: The Trail of Rage and Melody’ due out next month, Bob Mould is gearing up for a busy summer that will include a book tour, dates with his Blowoff DJ side project, an opening slot at two giant Foo Fighters shows in the U.K. and the reissue of Sugar’s classic debut ‘Copper Blue’ on audiophile vinyl.\n\nIt’s Wayne Hussey’s birthday today — he’s 53 — and to honor the co-founder of goth-rock luminaries The Mission, we present this 1990 concert filmed in Dusseldorf during the ‘Carved in Sand’ tour and broadcast on German television.\n\nWhat began as a modest U.K. tour this June by Morrissey continues to grow, with a new round of eight European concerts added to the itinerary in recent days — resulting in a trek that now stretches 25 dates and goes into August.\n\nThe surviving members of INXS — accompanied, presumably, by frontman/game show winner J.D. Fortune — will mount a 25-date North American tour this summer in support of the band’s ‘Original Sin’ collection of re-recorded greatest hits. Berlin opens at least 11 of the U.S. shows.\n\nIn their first television appearance in 24 years, The Cars dropped by ‘Late Night with Jimmy Fallon’ on Tuesday night to perform ‘Blue Tip’ off just-released comeback album ‘Move Like This’ as well as 1979 smash ‘Let’s Go.’"
