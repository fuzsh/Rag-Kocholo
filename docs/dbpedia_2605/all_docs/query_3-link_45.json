        "text": "Regular readers of The Sorrowful Putto of Prague will be familiar with the soundtrack that accompanies this comic’s melancholy wandering through the city on the Vltava.\n\nI’ve been lucky enough to have some exceptionally talented musicians contribute to this project over the years, most notably Roger O’Donnell of The Cure. I’m very excited to reveal that as we count down to the publication of the Czech hardback edition of The Sorrowful Putto of Prague this Spring, a very special Czech artist will be adding to our canon of music on this site. More details to follow shortly.\n\nToday I’m proud to unveil a track that I’ve co-written with good friend and former bandmate Adam Howells. Part of a new musical collaboration project ‘And Even After This We Still Won’t Have Any More Hope’, the track is named ‘Farewell, Farewell, You Daughters of Prague’.\n\nThe pair of us actually began working on a version of this tune back in 2003 in Dublin. So, it’s taken us a rather long while to arrive here.\n\nFarewell, Farewell was recorded by Adam based on a shockingly low quality demo provided by myself (using my dismal laptop’s internal microphone and utilising the most basic of free recording software). Adam took my initial premise, ignored the multi tracked heavy breathing that cut through the recording (due to me having to sit almost on top of the laptop to record the demo) and worked his not inconsiderable magic.\n\nWe’ve had a great few months bouncing ideas back and forth over the interweb as we shaped the final version we now present on the website, Bandcamp (available to buy) and our YouTube channel.\n\nSpecial thanks to Al Hughes for mixing and Petr Onufer for the ambient Žižkov street sounds. Please make sure to follow our YouTube channel as we’ll be adding plenty of new content in the coming months.\n\nIt’s always pleasant to see The Sorrowful Putto of Prague get a little publicity, but even more so when that trumpet of support blares out from one of your favourite publications.\n\nLast month the Putto was featured in the UK’s Guardian newspaper, part of its Comic and Graphic novel section.\n\nHumbly sitting alongside reviews of giants like 2000AD and a new title from Image Comics, The Sorrowful Putto of Prague got a plug from the Guardian’s Graeme Virtue in both the print (yay!) and online editions.\n\nThanks to Graeme for the mention and to all those who have visited the Putto or shown an interest in the comic since the review was published.\n\nMeanwhile, we are closing in on publication date for The Sorrowful Putto of Prague in the Czech Republic. Be sure to follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube for news on this, some new musical projects and artist interviews.\n\nThese are very exciting times for The Sorrowful Putto of Prague. Firstly, 2017 will see the first print edition of the comic hit bookstores. As previously mentioned, a Czech edition (Truchlivý amoret pražský) will be released this year by hugely respected Prague based publishers Argo.\n\nI’ve spent the past couple of months finalising the design of the book with the hugely talented art team at Argo. The book was originally pencilled in for late 2016, but we decided to hold off to get the book looking exactly as we wanted.\n\nI can assure you it will be well worth the wait. Argo are famous for the quality of their book designs and the Putto promises to live up to their high standards. We’ll confirm the print date shortly and hopefully have plenty of previews of the book for people to take a look at.\n\nMore sorrowful music\n\nOver the years the online soundtrack to The Putto has gotten lots of positive attention, most notably when The Cure’s Roger O’Donnell kindly provided a superb companion piece to our ‘Disintegratio’ chapter.\n\nTo mark our Czech language publication, 2017 will see more music added to the project. In the coming weeks we should be able to announce the first of the new tracks.\n\nThe first piece even involves yours truly dusting down his old Les Paul, Takemine, Marshall(ova) amp and motley collection of Boss pedals to lay the writing foundation for the first new track. More news to follow.\n\nSpreading the word\n\nWe had some fantastic write ups for The Putto in 2016. We were especially thrilled with a wonderful review from British comic veteran (and a man who wrote many great stories I read in my childhood) John Freeman on his excellent Down The Tubes website.\n\nFingers crossed that 2017 will see even more positive noise bouncing around. We are hoping to press ahead with other print publication plans, most notably trying to secure an English language publisher. As soon as we have any news we’ll be sure to post.\n\nMeanwhile, thanks to all of you who have supported the title to date, it’s massively appreciated.\n\nIf you aren’t already, you can follow us on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Any help in spreading the word across those channels is always much appreciated.\n\nHere’s to a ‘sorrowful’ 2017.\n\nThis winter, The Sorrowful Putto of Prague will be published in print form in the Czech Republic by Argo. The first published edition of our work will contain several stories not online and exclusive to the print edition.\n\nOne such tale is ‘Rusalka Rises (and partakes in a rare and dramatic outing to the opera)’. In the coming weeks we will be posting a short preview of the first third of this tale, based on the Czech legend of Rusalka and made famous globally via Antonín Dvořák’s opera.\n\nThe incredible art in this preview is by Lenka Šimečková of The Republic! (All hail The Republic!)\n\nAs these exquisite images show, it’s going to be quite the visual treat.\n\nLenka was the genius behind our ‘The Eyes of Mother Prague’ preview from last year (which will also be in the Czech print edition).\n\nWe’ll be publishing the preview over the coming weeks and you can start to read by clicking here. We hope you enjoy and please, if you do, spread the word.\n\nHere’s a more than suitable piece of music to go along with your reading, dear reader."
