        "text": "The Cure, circa ‘The Top’: Andy Anderson is second from left\n\nDrummer Andy Anderson, who played in The Glove with Robert Smith and the Banshees’ Steven Severin then joined The Cure and played on that band’s 1984 album The Top, died Tuesday, just nine days after informing fans that he had a terminal Stage-4 cancer diagnosis.\n\nHe was 68.\n\nThe news was confirmed on Twitter by Cure co-founder Lol Tolhurst, whom Anderson replaced when Tolhurst moved over to keyboards. Tolhurst wrote:\n\n“It’s with a heavy heart I have to report the passing of a Cure brother. Andy Anderson was a true gentleman and a great musician with a wicked sense of humor, which he kept until the end, a testament to his beautiful spirit on the last journey. We are blessed to have known him.”\n\nCurrent Cure keyboardist Roger O’Donnell, who first joined the band in the late ’80s, wrote on Facebook:\n\n“Very sad news about Andy Anderson, I only met him once, he was a lovely guy and a great drummer. Shake Dog Shake”\n\nAnderson announced on his Facebook on Feb. 17 that he had signed a do-not-resuscitate order (“I have a next of kin in place and there is no way I would want them to be looking me as a vegetable”), and would be looking at chemotherapy and radiotherapy options in the coming days.\n\nHe managed to strike an upbeat note, however, writing, “Please, no boo-hooing here, just be positive. For me, it’s just another life experience and hurdle that one has to make.”\n\nAnderson first worked with Smith in 1983 on The Cure frontman’s side project with Siouxsie and the Banshees bassist Severin called The Glove, playing drums on that group’s lone album, Blue Sunshine. He then joined The Cure, playing drums on “The Love Cats” and staying on board for The Top and its subsequent touring, captured on the Concert: The Cure Live album.\n\nAfter being dismissed from The Cure and replaced by Boris Williams, Anderson would go on to play with a wide range of artists, including Iggy Pop. He is just one of a handful of members of The Cure who will not be inducted alongside the band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nBelow, see Anderson play in the out-of-print Cure concert film “Live in Japan.”\n\nPREVIOUSLY ON SLICING UP EYEBALLS"
