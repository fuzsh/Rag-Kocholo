Almost a year after the couple announced they were separating, Kris Jenner has filed for a divorce from her husband of 23 years, Bruce Jenner.

In court documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday and obtained by EW, Kris Jenner cites irreconcilable differences for calling off her marriage to Bruce.

The Jenners were married in April of 1991 and have two children together, Kylie and Kendall. According to TMZ, the two will have joint custody of Kylie, who is 17.

“We are living separately and we are much happier this way,” Kris told E! News when the couple announced their separation in October. “But we will always have much love and respect for each other. Even though we are separated, we will always remain best friends and, as always, our family will remain our number one priority.”

A rep for the couple did not immediately respond to EW’s request for comment.

Correction: This story has been updated to clarify the number of years the Jenners were married.
