        "text": "Kris and Bruce Jenner will be starting off the new year single. The longtime couple has finalized their divorce, TMZ reports.\n\nA Los Angeles county judge has signed the legal documents, which stipulate that neither individual will receive spousal support. The two will share joint custody of their only underage daughter, 17-year-old Kylie.\n\nMore shocking celebrity breakups\n\nKris, 59, will get the family house, a 2012 Rolls-Royce Ghost, a 2014 Bentley and a 2014 Land Rover. Bruce, 65, will get a 2011 Porsche 997 Coupe, a 2013 Cadillac Escalade and a 2007 Harley motorcycle.\n\nKris and Bruce Jenner married in 1991 and did not sign a prenuptial agreement. Kris filed for divorce in September, citing irreconcilable differences. They had announced their separation a year earlier, but have continued to appear together, albeit less frequently, on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nSexy celebrity Santas\n\nThey will each legally be allowed to marry other people on March 23, 2015.\n\nThis was the second marriage for Kris, who had four children with her first husband, the late Robert Kardashian, and the third for Bruce, who was previously married to Chrystie Crownover and Linda Thompson. Bruce also has four children from his previous unions.\n\nAre you sad the Jenners are officially kaput?\n\nBest of the Year: Check out our 10 favorite LGBT characters"
