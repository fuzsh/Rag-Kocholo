        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner has revealed why she was first attracted to former wife Kris Jenner and championed her strength and independence.\n\nCaitlyn, previously known as Bruce Jenner before her gender transition, was married to Kris for over two decades before they split in 2013.\n\nThe couple share daughters Kendall, 25, and Kylie, 23, and their marriage and family life was documented on hit reality series Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nCaitlyn and Kris met in 1990 and married in April 1991, five months after they first began dating.\n\nRecalling the early days of their relationship, Caitlyn revealed what it was that first attracted her to Kris and she explained it was the star’s class, strength and independence that reeled her in.\n\nSpeaking on The Skinny Confidential Him & Her Podcast, Caitlyn said: ‘I had four kids, she had four kids… We had 23 really good years together. For me, [Kris] was very different.\n\n‘She was very classy, had a great sense of style. She was very smart. I always liked strong women and she was very strong.’\n\nThe Olympic gold medallist continued: ‘I have always put kind of women up on a pedestal and I’d love strong women, independent women. And she was all of those things and she was very different for me.’\n\n‘I mean, she lived in Beverly Hills,’ Caitlyn joked. ‘And I’m not a Beverly Hills person, she had just been going through a divorce, we kind of hit it off from the beginning.’\n\nCaitlyn credited Kris for helping him to get back to work after a tough few years\n\nKris and Caitlyn’s split was documented on KUWTK, but the pair have remained close despite their marriage ending and Caitlyn is often seen spending time with the rest of the Kardashian clan.\n\nIn fact, she says filming the E! reality show brought her some of the ‘best times of my life’.\n\nIt was revealed last year that KUWTK would be coming to an end in 2021, following 14 years on air and 20 seasons.\n\n‘Some of the best times of my life were with my family shooting that show,’ Caitlyn said. ‘Fortunately all of my kids are doing extraordinarily well and I don’t have to worry about them.’\n\nAs well as being dad to Kendall and Kylie and step-father to Kris’ children Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Rob, Caitlyn also has sons Brody, Brandon and Burt Jenner and daughter Cassandra from previous marriages.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Ana de Armas reveals chic new bob as she chops off her long locks after Ben Affleck split"
