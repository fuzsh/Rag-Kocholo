        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nCaitlyn Jenner is an Olympic gold medalist, a reality-TV personality, and, briefly, a movie star.\n\nIn April, she announced she's running for governor of California.\n\nTake a look at the life of one of the greatest all-time American athletes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaitlyn Jenner was born in Mount Kisco, New York, in 1949.\n\nJenner was born to William and Esther Jenner in Westchester, a suburb about an hour outside New York City, and raised in Tarrytown.\n\nFrom an early age, Jenner showed promise as an athlete.\n\nShe was crowned the most valuable player on her high school's basketball team in Newton, Connecticut, and attended Graceland University in Lamoni, Iowa, on a football scholarship.\n\nHer high-school football coach, Peter Kohut, called her an \"outstanding athlete\" in a 2015 interview with the New York Daily News.\n\nShe \"was always in front of the line when we did warm-up laps and was never winded,\" Kohut said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1976, the 26-year-old Jenner won a gold medal for decathlon in the Summer Olympics in Montreal.\n\nJenner, who had dabbled in water skiing and basketball in her athletic career, tried her hand at Olympic decathlon (a grueling athletic event that combines 10 track-and-field events like the 100-meter-dash, high jump, pole vault, and javelin throw) twice.\n\nIn 1972, Jenner didn't perform quite as well as she might have hoped, placing 10th in the decathlon.\n\nTo make sure she fared better four years later in 1976, she trained under several top athletes, including Al Feuerbach, who at the time held the world record in shot put, and the Olympic gold-medalist sprinter Millard Hampton, according to the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee.\n\nHer hard work paid off: She went on to win the gold medal for decathlon in the 1976 Olympics, and her success cemented her status as one of the greatest American athletes of all time.\n\n\"I do know that if I win and I handle myself well,\" Jenner told Sports Illustrated before her 1976 win, \"I can work off it for years and years.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Jenner was steadily gaining momentum as an athlete, she married her first wife, Chrystie Scott.\n\nJenner and Scott got married in 1972 and had two children together — Burt and Cassandra.\n\nScott was a permanent fixture by Jenner's side throughout her Olympic career and was frequently snapped in pictures with her.\n\nFrank Deford wrote for Sports Illustrated in 1976 that Jenner came to the Olympics that year \"equipped with a pretty blonde wife in a tight-fitting T-shirt, who cried tears of happiness and told lyric tales of her husband in California Gothic.\"\n\nAccording to the publication, Jenner met Scott (nee Crownover), a minister's daughter, at Graceland University.\n\nDeford reported that after Jenner wrapped the final sprint of the 1976 decathlon — making her victory official — Scott \"struggled\" to break through a crowd of police and fans to reach her partner. When they finally made their way to each other, they hugged.\n\nThe couple separated when Scott was pregnant with Cassandra and later divorced in 1981.\n\nWhile not much is publicly known about Cassandra, Burt, Jenner's oldest child, is a race-car driver and father of two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer 1976 Olympics success propelled Jenner to superstardom and landed her on the Wheaties cereal box and inside the pantries of millions of Americans.\n\nIn 1978, the all-around American superstar was photographed on the cereal box, which said \"fueling American champions for decades,\" in her Olympics shorts and numbered jersey.\n\nJenner was also the spokesperson for the cereal company from 1977 to 1979, during which time she appeared in a commercial as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter her divorce from Scott, Jenner married the former model and singer-songwriter Linda Thompson.\n\nJenner was married to Thompson (who was Elvis Presley's girlfriend for a while) from 1981 to 1986, and they had two sons together.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with \"Entertainment Tonight,\" Thompson described Jenner as \"wonderful, athletic, down to earth, free and easygoing\" in the early years of their relationship and added that the two had come to share a \"cordial\" relationship in which they saw each other from time to time.\n\nThompson and Jenner are parents to Brandon, a musician, and Brody, a social-media influencer, who appeared on the MTV reality show \"The Hills.\" The two also later appeared on \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the '80s, around the time of her marriage to Thompson, Jenner took her talents to Hollywood.\n\nJenner's most popular movie role was in the widely panned 1980 musical \"Can't Stop the Music.\" According to The Hollywood Reporter, Jenner played a lawyer who becomes friends with a bunch of musicians.\n\nHer costar Steve Guttenberg told the publication that he's Jenner's \"biggest supporter and lifelong friend.\"\n\nAfter her movie debut in \"Can't Stop the Music,\" Jenner appeared in several TV shows and movies in the '80s, including \"Murder She Wrote.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive years after she divorced Thompson, Jenner married Kris Kardashian.\n\nThe couple met on a blind date in 1990 and dated for five months before getting married.\n\nKris told HuffPost in 2012 that the two bonded over their shared love for motorcycles and meatloaf, which she said Jenner ordered on their first date.\n\nThe wedding took place a month after Kris finalized her divorce from her ex-husband, the lawyer Robert Kardashian (with whom she shared four children — Kim, Kourtney, Khloé, and Robert Jr.).\n\nThey got married in a friend's backyard, and Jenner gave Kris an engagement ring on their 20th wedding anniversary.\n\nThe two were married for 23 years and have two daughters together, Kendall and Kylie Jenner.\n\nKendall is a supermodel, while Kylie founded a lucrative beauty and cosmetics line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kardashian-Jenner family started appearing on the E! reality show \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" in 2007.\n\n\"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" ran for 20 seasons and catapulted the Kardashian-Jenner family to superstardom that extends far beyond reality TV.\n\nThe show, which is coming to an end this year, documented the family's lives as they experienced professional milestones (like growing a billion-dollar empire and gaining hundreds of millions of social-media followers) as well as personal ones (like births, new relationships, and divorces).\n\nJenner was a series regular until season 13 and is back for an appearance in the final season, airing now.\n\n\"Over the 10 years I did the show, I really enjoyed doing the show,\" Jenner told \"Entertainment Tonight\" in March.\n\n\"We went through a lot together. I think I had probably some of the best conversations with my kids on camera,\" she continued. \"A lot of times, you know, things happen and as a parent, you're going, 'Oh, I better talk to the kid about that,' and you just don't do it as quickly.\"\n\n\"It's uncomfortable,\" she added. \"But with the show, you have to talk to them about it, like, right now, and so I think it really brought the family much closer.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter over two decades together, Jenner and Kris separated in 2013 and divorced two years later.\n\nEven though the Jenners had a rocky relationship in the years following their divorce, which was documented on \"KUWTK,\" Jenner told People in September that the separation itself wasn't particularly dramatic.\n\nJenner said that while she might have had a \"shorter\" temper toward the end of their marriage, \"all of a sudden, we didn't have any issues, it was calm.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was going through her divorce with Kris, Jenner was involved in a car crash in February 2015 that left one person dead.\n\nOn February 7, 2015, Jenner crashed into another vehicle that, as a result of the impact, collided with another car.\n\nKim Howe, a 69-year-old who was driving the car Jenner crashed into, died from injuries sustained in the crash. Howe hit a car carrying five people (the Wolf-Millesi family), including an infant, which left one person in that car with serious injuries, including a fractured spine.\n\nAlmost three years after the crash, Jenner was ordered to pay $800,000 in settlements to the Wolf-Millesi family.\n\nIn a lawsuit, however, Jenner blamed paparazzi for the crash, arguing that they \"stalked\" and \"harassed\" her into driving a certain way that night and that the agencies should be partially responsible for the money Jenner was ordered to pay the victims.\n\nIt's unclear whether that suit has been dropped or otherwise resolved.\n\nRepresentatives for Jenner didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment regarding the car crash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2015, Jenner sat down with the ABC journalist Diane Sawyer and shared that she was a trans woman: \"Yes, for all intents and purposes I am a woman.\"\n\nThe interview, which also included chats with Jenner's family members, gave an intimate look at the former Olympian's life over the years.\n\n\"People look at me differently. They see me as a macho male,\" Jenner told Sawyer on \"20/20.\" \"But my heart and my soul, that female side, is part of me, that's who I am. I was not genetically born that way.\"\n\n\"I hate that terminology 'girl stuck in a guy's body,'\" she added. \"I'm me, I'm a person, this is who I am. I'm not stuck in anyone's body, it's just who I am.\"\n\nShe also said that she was \"never attracted to guys.\"\n\nJenner told Sawyer that when she was younger she would try on her mother's and sister's outfits.\n\n\"I marked the closet so when I put it back I could put ... everything back in the exact same spot so I wouldn't get caught,\" she said.\n\nJenner said that she knew she was a trans woman at a young age and that her first wife, Chrystie Scott, was the first person she confided in.\n\nAfter Jenner's interview with Sawyer aired on ABC, her former wives spoke out, each expressing support.\n\nScott said Jenner told her she was a trans woman soon after their 1972 wedding.\n\n\"It was such a shock to me,\" Scott told \"Good Morning America,\" adding: \"Understandably, I was speechless. I didn't really know what to say.\"\n\nShe added that despite her shock, she \"was really pleased\" that Jenner trusted Scott with what Scott called her \"deepest, darkest secret.\"\n\nLinda Thompson wrote a lengthy post about their relationship for HuffPost, documenting their courtship, marriage, the birth of their sons, and their subsequent estrangement.\n\nShe also wrote that about three years into their marriage, Jenner told her she was a trans woman. They went to couples' therapy for six months before separating.\n\n\"Being married to a woman was not what I had envisioned for my life,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nShe added: \"It's impossible for those of us who are comfortable living in our own skin to fully grasp what an imprisonment that must feel like to be born into the wrong body.\"\n\nKris Jenner called Jenner a \"hero\" in a tweet.\n\nJenner's mother, Esther, said that while it was a \"surprise\" when she first found out Jenner was transgender, she said she would \"always love\" Jenner.\n\nPeople outside Jenner's immediate circle also wanted to show the former Olympic hero their support, and her iconic 1978 Wheaties box started selling for several hundred dollars on resale websites like eBay.\n\nA few months after her Diane Sawyer interview, Jenner, photographed by Annie Leibovitz, appeared on the June cover of Vanity Fair magazine. \"Call Me Caitlyn,\" the cover said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July 2015, she accepted an ESPY Award for courage and started appearing in her own E! reality show, \"I Am Cait.\"\n\nJenner appeared onstage in a floor-length white gown and gave a tearful speech while accepting the Arthur Ashe Award for courage.\n\n\"If you want to call me names, make jokes, and doubt my intentions, go ahead because the reality is I can take it,\" she said. \"But for thousands of kids out there coming to terms with the reality of who they are, they shouldn't have to take it.\"\n\nA few days after her ESPY appearance, \"I Am Cait,\" a docuseries about Jenner's life since coming out, debuted on E!. It was canceled after two seasons.\n\nWhen news of the cancellation broke, Jenner tweeted that she was looking forward to her \"next adventure.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few months later, Jenner described herself as a \"traditionalist\" who, initially, didn't support same-sex marriage.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in September 2015, Jenner, who is a Republican, told the host Ellen DeGeneres that when it came to marriage, she had always liked \"tradition.\"\n\n\"It's always been a man and a woman,\" Jenner said.\n\n\"As time has gone on, I think, like a lot of people, I've really changed the thinking here,\" she continued. \"I don't ever want to stand in front of anybody's happiness.\"\n\nIn keeping with the conservative political views she expressed on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" Jenner supported Donald Trump in his 2016 bid for the Oval Office.\n\nShe denounced Trump in a 2018 opinion essay for The Washington Post, however, for his stance on transgender issues.\n\n\"The reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president,\" Jenner wrote. \"He has made trans people into political pawns as he whips up animus against us in an attempt to energize the most right-wing segment of his party.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenner gave her fans an even more intimate look at her life in a memoir published in 2017, titled \"The Secrets of My Life,\" that caused some friction within her family.\n\nIn the book, Jenner opened up about her relationships, sports, and her conservative political opinions.\n\n\"I did not transition to become a liberal Democrat,\" she wrote.\n\nJenner's memoir was also critical of Kris, which ruffled a few feathers in the Kardashian camp.\n\nJenner wrote that Kris lied to get ahead and that Robert Kardashian, who was famously part of OJ Simpson's legal team, thought Simpson was guilty of murder in the deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"The View,\" Kim Kardashian said she was a \"little shocked\" and \"definitely got upset\" by the book.\n\nIn an episode of \"KUWTK,\" Kim and her sisters also pushed back on Jenner's claim that their father, Robert, did not believe his longtime friend Simpson during the trial.\n\n\"I've always had Caitlyn's back,\" Kim said. \"But she is a liar. She is not a good person.\"\n\n\"If you talk about my dad, I will cut you,\" she added.\n\nKhloé Kardashian, who used to be particularly close to Jenner, also stopped responding to Jenner's texts after the book was released.\n\nIn the years since the memoir was published, Kim and Jenner's relationship appears to have mended, at least on social media, with the two posing together in a photo taken in February 2020 at the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party.\n\nKim and Kourtney also attended a birthday dinner for Jenner in October 2019, though Khloé was missing from the photo Jenner posted on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, Jenner announced she was running for governor of California.\n\nJenner is running for governor of California in a recall election against the Democratic incumbent, Gavin Newsom, who won the position in 2018.\n\n\"California has been my home for nearly 50 years. I came here because I knew that anyone, regardless of their background or station in life, could turn their dreams into reality,\" Jenner's campaign website says.\n\n\"But for the past decade, we have seen the glimmer of the Golden State reduced by one-party rule that places politics over progress and special interests over people,\" the statement continued. \"Sacramento needs an honest leader with a clear vision.\"\n\nRead next\n\nKim Kardashian Kris Jenner Olympics\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
