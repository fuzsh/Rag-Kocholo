        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner opened up about her love life, firmly stating that she has no intention of seeking a romantic partner in the future.\n\nIn a new interview, Jenner also described this phase of her life as a \"fun\" chapter, filled with hobbies like flying airplanes and golf. She reflected on her past, including her marriage to Kris Jenner, describing it as \"love at first sight.\"\n\nCaitlyn Jenner Says She Doesn't See Relationship In Her Life\n\nTrending:\n\nHamas Terrorists Reportedly Slaughter, Behead At Least 40 Babies & Children\n\nShannen Doherty’s Is Close To Settling Divorce With Kurt Iswarienko\n\nBlac Chyna Goes ‘Snap, Crackle, Pop’ During Viral Chiropractic Session\n\nDonald Trump’s Presidential Hopes Mocked By Former Aide: ‘Hard To Run For President From Jail’\n\nPaulina Porizkova Says ‘Staying Silent Is Not An Option’ Amid Hamas Attack On Israel\n\nIn a recent chat with The Times, reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner shared her perspective on her love life, revealing she has no interest in seeking a romantic partner at this point in her life.\n\nThe 73-year-old explained: \"I'm fine. I'm not even close to looking for a relationship. I'll never have a relationship in the future. I just don't see that in my life. I am not looking for that.\"\n\nDespite her resolution to remain single, Jenner is not concerned about loneliness. The reality star shared that she finds fulfillment in the company of her two dogs, Bertha and Baxter, and her extensive extended family, which includes her six children from her three previous marriages to Kris Jenner, Anna Thompson, and Chrystie Scott.\n\n\"Every night of the week I could go to somebody's house and have dinner,\" she added.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner Reminisces On The 'Fun' Chapters In Her Life\n\nBesides spending time with her dogs and family, Jenner shared that she fills her life with various hobbies and interests. The former Olympic champion mentioned her passion for flying airplanes and indulging in golf, describing this phase of her life as the \"fun\" chapter.\n\nReflecting on her past, she noted, \"I raced cars for 20-odd years. Racing cars is not the greatest way to make money or a career or business. You do it because it's fun.\"\n\nJenner also revealed that staying active is crucial to her, and she maintains her fitness and health through regular exercise, even though she doesn't engage in intense workouts. \"I just enjoy good health. I don't go crazy working out, but I get my exercise in all the time,\" she explained.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner Revealed It Was 'Love At First Sight' With Kris Jenner\n\nDuring the conversation, Jenner also delved into her relationship with her former partner, Kris Jenner, recalling their initial encounter in 1990 through a blind date as \"love at first sight.\"\n\nShe stated: \"We hit it off right at the beginning, and we were married after five and a half months. I was infatuated with her because she was very different from me. But yes, I'd have to say, it was love at first sight.\"\n\nHowever, their marriage lasted over two decades until their 2015 divorce, which coincided with Jenner publicly coming out as transgender.\n\nAfter her marriage and divorce, Jenner was often linked to Sophia Hutchins, but both consistently denied romantic involvement and asserted their connection was purely platonic, blending business and friendship.\n\nThe pair appeared side by side at red-carpet events, and in early 2018, Hutchins lived in Jenner's Malibu mansion and also served as her manager. However, in a June 2021 interview with People, Hutchins emphasized their \"parental, familial relationship.\"\n\nWhy She Joined Docu-Series 'House of Kardashian'\n\nJenner opened up about her reason for participating in the documentary series \"House of Kardashians,\" which delves into the ascent to wealth of her family.\n\nJenner, who is a mother to six children, including Kylie and Kendall Jenner, and the stepmother of Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe Kardashian, explained that her motivation was to ensure the family's portrayal was accurate and positive.\n\nShe expressed her disappointment with past media representations of the Kardashians, stating: \"It's very difficult when you're in public life and in the media, especially the Kardashians… Sometimes it's just very disappointing to see how they're represented. And when they approached me about doing this show, once I thought about it, I thought, 'You know what? I want to get involved. I want to do my best to be very positive and really represent the family and the kids in a positive way.'\""
