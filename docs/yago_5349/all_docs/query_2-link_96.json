        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner, 69, is rumoured to be dating Sophia Hutchins, who is also transgender.\n\nJenner’s rumoured girlfriend Hutchins, who is reportedly 47 years Jenner’s junior, is a graduate and businesswoman.\n\nShe was a student at Pepperdine University, which is located near Jenner’s mansion home in Malibu, California, where Hutchins also lives.\n\nLike Jenner, Hutchins is an American transgender woman. She transitioned at 18 years old.\n\nHow old is Sophia Hutchins? What is the age gap between Caitlyn Jenner and her girlfriend?\n\nAccording to online reports, Hutchins was born in Washington on May 6, 1997. Jenner, on the other hand, was born on October 28, 1949.\n\nThis means there is a 47 year age gap between the trans couple.\n\nHowever, other reports suggest that Hutchins was 22 as of last year, which would mean there are actually 46 years between them.\n\nDuring an interview, Hutchins explained: “I don’t see age as a factor in our relationship. We are two souls that are a fantastic match for one another.”\n\nAre Caitlyn Jenner and Sophia Hutchins getting married?\n\nWhile there have been reports about the couple planning to tie the knot, there is yet to be an official confirmation.\n\nIn May 2018, a spokesperson told PinkNews that they are not getting married. But later that year, in July, Hutchins took to her Instagram where she hinted that it may happen soon.\n\n“We’re partners in everything we do, we’re inseparable, we’re business partners, we live together, we share a dog, we share family, we share a life together.”\n\n—Sophia Hutchins\n\nOn Hutchins’ Instagram story, she urged fans to ask her questions. One social media followed asked, “Are you engaged?”\n\nHutchins replied: “I’ll show you the ring when I am,” followed with a cheeky smile emoji.\n\nAnother asked, “R u and Caitlyn dating? Also do you have any pets?”, to which Hutchins replied: “Of course,” adding they “have our little Bertha.”\n\nThen, when another user went on to ask whether the couple were getting married, Hutchins replied with two bride emojis, possibly suggesting that it could be around the corner.\n\nIf they do get married, it would become Jenner’s fourth marriage. She had previously been married to Chrystie Crownover, Linda Thompson and, of course, Kris Jenner.\n\nThe celebrity couple, who starred in Keeping Up with the Kardashians, divorced in 2015, the same year Caitlyn publicly came out as a trans woman.\n\nSophia Hutchins opens up about her relationship with Caitlyn Jenner\n\nHowever, despite suggesting that the two are dating on Instagram, Hutchins said that they are not in a “romantic relationship” during an interview on The Hidden Truth.\n\nShe told Jim Breslo that she wouldn’t label their relationship as “dating,” nor would she call Jenner her “girlfriend.” Instead, they’re simply “partners.”\n\nShe explained, “We’re partners in everything we do, we’re inseparable, we’re business partners, we live together, we share a dog, we share family, we share a life together.”\n\nWhat is Sophia Hutchins’s sexual orientation?\n\nBreslo went on to ask how Hutchins labels herself. He asked: “If you’re a trans woman with a trans woman, does that mean trans lesbian? Is that the right terminology for it?”\n\nHutchins replied: “I wouldn’t even go down that road. My sexual orientation is not something that I need to discuss. [I choose] to be with someone based on the person, and the person happens to be a trans woman, and I think that’s great.”"
