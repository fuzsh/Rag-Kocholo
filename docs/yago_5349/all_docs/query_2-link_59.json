        "text": "The former Olympian has six children: Burt, Cassandra, Brandon, Brody, Kendall, and Kylie Jenner.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner is a well-known American television personality and retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete. She was born on October 28, 1949, as Bruce Jenner and became famous after winning the gold medal in the decathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Caitlyn has since become a prominent figure in the media, particularly through her involvement with the reality TV show “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” which follows the lives of her family members, including her daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner.\n\nThe former Olympic decathlete and motivational speaker has six children with three different wives. Burt Jenner, 45, and Cassandra Marino, 44, are from Caitlyn’s marriage with Chrystie Scott. Brandon Jenner, 43, and Brody Jenner, 40, are from her marriage with Linda Thompson. Kendall Jenner, 28, and Kylie Jenner, 26, are from her marriage with Kris Jenner.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner celebrated Father’s Day by off-roading with her family. She spent the day in Malibu with several of her children, including Burt, Brandon, and Kendall Jenner, as well as stepdaughters Kim and Khloé Kardashian. Kim’s husband Kanye West and their daughter North were also present.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner’s first four children—Burt, Cassandra, Brandon, and Brody—have chosen not to participate in her new E! reality show. This decision stems from their complicated relationship with Caitlyn, which has been strained over the years. Brandon Jenner, for instance, has spoken about the limited interaction he had with his father during his formative years, describing their relationship as largely characterized by staged photo opportunities rather than genuine family moments.\n\nHere’s everything to know about Caitlyn Jenner’s 6 Kids: Burt, Cassandra, Brandon, Brody, Kendall, and Kylie Jenner.\n\nMeet Caitlyn Jenner’s 6 Kids\n\nCaitlyn Jenner is a proud parent of six kids from three different marriages. Her children include Burt Jenner, 45, and Cassandra Marino, 44, with her first wife Chrystie Scott; Brandon Jenner, 43, and Brody Jenner, 40, with her second wife Linda Thompson; and Kendall Jenner, 28, and Kylie Jenner, 26, with her third wife Kris Jenner. Each of her children has carved out their own path, with Kendall and Kylie gaining significant fame through their modeling careers and business ventures​.\n\nGet to know everything about Caitlyn Jenner’s Kids.\n\nBurt Jenner, 45\n\nBurt Jenner, is the eldest son of Caitlyn Jenner and her first wife, Chrystie Scott. He is a professional off-road racing driver and the owner of West LA Dogs, a dog boarding and daycare facility. Burt has carved out a successful career in motorsports, competing in events like the Stadium Super Trucks series and earning a reputation as a skilled driver.\n\nIn his personal life, Burt has welcomed two children with his girlfriend, Valerie Pitalo. Their first child, a son, was born in 2016, and their daughter, Goldie Brooklyn Jenner, was born on March 19, 2022. Burt is known for his close relationship with his father, Caitlyn, and has been a supportive figure throughout Caitlyn’s transition, expressing pride and support for her public journey.\n\nBurt has maintained a relatively private life compared to some of his siblings, choosing not to participate in the family’s reality TV ventures like “Keeping Up with the Kardashians.” He has openly stated that he does not watch the show and prefers to keep his life separate from the reality TV spotlight.\n\nCassandra Marino, 44\n\nCassandra Marino, born on June 10, 1980, is the eldest daughter of Caitlyn Jenner and Chrystie Scott. Unlike her more famous siblings, Cassandra, also known as Casey, has maintained a relatively private life. She is an interior designer and lives in Los Angeles with her husband, Michael Marino, and their three children: Francesca, Isabella, and Luke.\n\nCassandra’s relationship with her parent has seen significant ups and downs. Caitlyn Jenner has admitted to struggling with her gender identity during the formative years of her four older children, which impacted her ability to be present in their lives. As a result, Cassandra and Caitlyn were not very close during Cassandra’s childhood and early adulthood. This absence left a noticeable gap in their relationship, leading to years of limited communication.\n\nHowever, Caitlyn’s transition marked a turning point in their relationship. Since coming out as transgender in 2015, Caitlyn has made concerted efforts to reconnect with her older children, including Cassandra. Cassandra has spoken positively about the changes, noting that her relationship with Caitlyn has improved significantly. They now see each other regularly and have frequent conversations, which was a stark contrast to their earlier years. Cassandra appreciates the newfound softness and happiness in Caitlyn, which has helped them bond more closely​.\n\nIn recent news, Cassandra welcomed her third child, a baby boy, which added to Caitlyn Jenner’s growing number of grandchildren.\n\nBrandon Jenner, 43\n\nBrandon Jenner is an American singer-songwriter and television personality, born on June 4, 1981, to Caitlyn Jenner and Linda Thompson. He grew up in Malibu, California, and made his early television debut with his younger brother Brody Jenner on the reality show “The Princes of Malibu.”\n\nBrandon has had a varied career in music, initially performing as a duo with his first wife Leah Felder in the group “Brandon & Leah.” The couple welcomed their daughter Eva James in 2015 but split amicably in 2018. Brandon has since remarried Cayley Stoker, with whom he welcomed twin boys, Bo and Sam, in 2020. The couple recently announced they are expecting their third child together​.\n\nHis relationship with Caitlyn Jenner has been complex, particularly during his childhood. Brandon revealed that he saw Caitlyn, then Bruce, only a few times between the ages of 8 and 25 due to Caitlyn’s focus on building a new family with Kris Jenner. However, their relationship has improved significantly after Caitlyn’s transition. Brandon now feels they are in a much better place and have developed a deeper connection​.\n\nIn recent years, Brandon and Cayley have embraced a plant-based lifestyle, which they share in their new cooking series “At Home with the Jenners” on UnchainedTV. The show highlights their life in Malibu, featuring farm-to-table recipes and glimpses into their family life with their children and numerous pets.\n\nBrody Jenner, 40\n\nBrody Jenner is a well-known television personality, model, and DJ, born on August 21, 1983, to Caitlyn Jenner and Linda Thompson. He gained fame through his appearances on reality TV shows like “The Hills” and “Keeping Up with the Kardashians.”\n\nIn recent developments, Brody and his fiancée, professional surfer Tia Blanco, welcomed their first child, a daughter named Honey Raye Jenner, on July 29, 2023. The couple announced the birth through a heartfelt Instagram post, sharing their joy and the good health of both mother and baby​.\n\nBrody has expressed his desire to be a very involved and present father, aiming to have a close relationship with Honey, which he feels he missed out on with his own parent, Caitlyn Jenner. Brody has openly discussed his struggles and internal conflict about becoming a father, highlighting his determination to create a nurturing environment for his daughter.\n\nBrody’s relationship with Caitlyn has been complex and strained over the years, particularly during his childhood when Caitlyn was transitioning and starting a new family with Kris Jenner. This led to periods of limited contact between Brody and Caitlyn. However, the relationship has improved somewhat in recent years as Brody has gained a deeper understanding of Caitlyn’s struggles and journey.\n\nKendall Jenner, 28\n\nKendall Jenner, born on November 3, 1995, is a prominent supermodel and TV personality. She recently starred in Calvin Klein’s Spring 2024 campaign, showcasing the brand’s womenswear collection in New York City. As a longtime ambassador of Calvin Klein, Kendall enjoys blending feminine touches with masculine pieces.

She and Devin had previously dated for two years before splitting in November 2022 due to their busy schedules. Despite their breakup, Kendall and Devin have decided to give their relationship another try, navigating a slow restart​.\n\nBesides her fashion endeavors, Kendall continues to be actively involved with her 818 Tequila brand, which has achieved significant success since its launch. Her participation in high-profile events like the Met Gala and major fashion campaigns underscores her influence in the fashion industry​.\n\nKylie Jenner, 26\n\nKylie Jenner, born on August 10, 1997, continues to make waves in the fashion and beauty industry.
