        "text": "After being separated for over a year, celebrity couple Kris and Bruce Jenner finally filed for divorce. Although individually popular in their own right, Kris Jenner (formally married to the late Robert Kardashian) and Bruce Jenner (Olympic Gold Medalist) are more contemporarily known as the parents of Kim, Khloe, Kourtney, Kylie and Kendall stars of the show Keeping up with the Kardashians.\n\nAccording to popular celebrity new outlets such as TMZ, the couple's split is amicable, and the parties filed their divorce paperwork at the Los Angeles County Courthouse, in propria persona, without the aid of attorneys. The couple, who married without a prenuptial agreement, agreed on the division of their marital property and neither party is seeking alimony. Additionally, the couple listed irreconcilable differences and the grounds for divorce, and agreed to share joint physical and legal custody of their only minor child, Kylie. From all indications, it appears the couple used their separation period to come to an agreement concerning property division and child custody, and then simply filed an uncontested divorce."
