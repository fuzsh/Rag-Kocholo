        "text": "In new excerpts from Vanity Fair‘s July cover story, Kris Jenner speaks out about her divorce from Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce.\n\n“He was married to me, and he wasn’t who he wanted to be, so he was miserable,” said Kris of their last years of marriage, using the male pronoun that Caitlyn was assigned at birth. “It was the most passive-aggressive thing I think I’ve ever experienced.”\n\n“Why would you want to be married and have kids, if this is what you wanted since you were a little boy?” Kris asked the magazine. “Why would you not explain this all to me?”\n\n“All I was doing was working very hard for my family so that we could all have a wonderful future, and he was pissed off,” elaborated Kris, claiming Caitlyn ended their relationship with zero warning.\n\nBut Caitlyn said different, telling Vanity Fair Kris knew about her ex’s propensity to cross-dress and had seen Caitlyn (then living as Bruce) in women’s clothing when they lived together, adding that the couple even had an agreement that Caitlyn only would cross-dress when she was traveling alone and not in the Jenner household.\n\nKris acknowledged that she knew her former spouse had taken hormones in the past but had assumed the B-cups Caitlyn had when they first met was a “man-boob situation.”\n\n“When I met Bruce, he told me that he had done hormones back in the early ’80s,” said Kris. “This was a conversation that took place in the early ’90s. So, what he was telling me happened a decade earlier, and he never really explained it.” Caitlyn maintained in the interview that Kris knew she was taking hormones up until when they met.\n\n“Nobody mentioned a gender issue,” said Kris, insisting that she had not seen Caitlyn dressed in women’s clothing before but had just heard someone mention that Caitlyn liked to “dress up.”\n\nCaitlyn said of the reason they split: “Twenty percent was gender, and 80 percent was the way I was treated.”\n\n“A lot of times, [Kris] wasn’t very nice,” she explained, but conceded that “probably a mistake I made was maybe not having her understand — not the severity of it, but that this is a condition you cannot get away from.”"
