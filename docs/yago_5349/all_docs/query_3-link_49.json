        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) – Court records show Kris and Bruce Jenner have finalized their divorce, but they won’t be officially single until March.\n\nA Los Angeles judge on Tuesday signed off on the couple’s divorce judgment that ends the pair’s 23-year marriage.\n\nThe Jenners filed divorce petitions in September, citing irreconcilable differences. California law requires couples to wait six months to become officially divorced.\n\nBruce Jenner won a gold medal in the men’s decathlon in the 1976 Olympics, although he is best known to a younger generation as Kim Kardashian’s stepfather. He and ex-wife Kris frequently appeared on the reality series “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” along with their children.\n\nThe divorce judgment calls for Kris Jenner to pay her estranged husband $2.5 million.\n\nKris and Bruce Jenner married in April 1991 and have two daughters together."
