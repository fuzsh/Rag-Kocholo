Her last marriage was with Kris Jenner from 1991 to 2015.\n\nCaitlyn has had six children from her marriages - Kylie Jenner, Kendall Jenner, Brody Jenner, Cassandra Marino, Brandon Jenner, and Burt Jenner\n\nWho is Caitlyn Jenner?\n\nCaitlyn Jenner was born on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York.\n\nCaitlyn is a well-known media personality and retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete.\n\nShe came out as a trans woman in April 2015, announcing a change in her name from William Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nAfter the transition, she starred in the reality TV series I am Cait.\n\nAs a result of her transition, she is a well-known transgender rights activist.\n\nIn an attempt to boost her political career, she ran as a replacement candidate in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election.\n\nHowever, she received only one percent of the vote, which made her place 13th among candidates that were seeking to replace Gavin Newsom.\n\nWhat is Caitlyn Jenner's net worth?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Caitlyn Jenner has an estimated net worth of approximately $100million, as of October 2022.\n\nHer main source of wealth is said to be her career as a media personality.\n\nShe also earns income from brand endorsements and sponsorships."
