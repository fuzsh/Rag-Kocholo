        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner was a part of the Kardashian machine for 23 years during her marriage to Kris Jenner.\n\nBut since the pair officially divorced in 2015, the former Olympic athlete has had less than flattering things to say about the uber-famous family.\n\nJenner’s latest remarks are set to air in Sky’s docseries “House of Kardashian,” which is set to be released on Oct. 8.\n\nA trailer for the tell-all series teases an interview with Jenner, 73, claiming that her former stepdaughter Kim Kardashian “calculated” fame from early on.\n\n“Kimberly calculated from the beginning, ‘How do I become famous?’” Jenner states.\n\nShe also utters an evil laugh when asked what it was like working with Kris, who managed Caitlyn’s career after the Olympic decathlon in 1976.\n\n“I was happy to participate in the interview process to share my side which points to the strength, influence, and prowess my family has in captivating the world’s attention and keeping it over the years,” Caitlyn said in a statement on her decision to participate in “House of Kardashian.”\n\n“I am incredibly proud of all my children and stepchildren,” she added.\n\nCaitlyn is stepdad to Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Robert Kardashian. She and Kris are also parents of Kendall and Kylie Jenner. The exes announced their separation in October 2013.\n\n“We are living separately and we are much happier this way, but we will always have much love and respect for each other,” their joint statement read at the time. “Even though we are separated, we will always remain best friends and, as always, our family will remain our number one priority.”\n\nThe Post has contacted reps for Jenner and the Kardashian family for comment.\n\nLet’s take a look back at the history of Caitlyn vs. the Kardashians.\n\nApril 2015: Diane Sawyer interview\n\nThe feud between Caitlyn Jenner and the Kardashians all started when Caitlyn told Diane Sawyer on “20/20” that she identified as a woman.\n\nThis was apparently the first time that Kris Jenner and the Kardashian/Jenner women heard Caitlyn say she was transgender.\n\nJune 2015: Vanity Fair cover story\n\nA few months after “20/20,” Caitlyn introduced herself to the world as a woman on the cover of Vanity Fair.\n\nThe Kardashian/Jenner clan also claimed they didn’t know about this until it came out to the masses.\n\nThis was also the first time Caitlyn trashed her marriage to Kris. She claimed the reason for their divorce was “20% gender and 80% the way I was treated.”\n\nCaitlyn and Kris both disagreed on how much the momager knew about her husband’s gender identity issues throughout their marriage.\n\n“A lot of times she wasn’t very nice,” Caitlyn said in the piece. “People would see how I got mistreated. She controlled the money … all that kind of stuff.”\n\nJanuary 2016: Khloe Kardashian appears on Howard Stern\n\nKhloe Kardashian appeared on the “Howard Stern Show” in January 2016 and claimed that Caitlyn had told the family that the rumors about her were untrue.\n\nBut, according to Khloe, the family would go on to find out that their stepdad was transitioning during a meeting with the E! Network when someone mentioned she “was having a TV show about transitioning or something.”\n\nShe added that, at first, Caitlyn would only talk to the family about transitioning in front of cameras.\n\n“Maybe he felt like we couldn’t get as upset or something,” she speculated.\n\nThe Good American founder also claimed the family “didn’t know when he was going to start fully dressing as Caitlyn” and was upset about being kept in the dark about her next steps.\n\nLater in 2016: Caitlyn Jenner gets angry over Khloe’s Howard Stern appearance\n\nIn the Season 12 premiere of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” an upset Caitlyn Jenner calls Kris Jenner to complain about Khloe Kardashian “talking s–t” in her Howard Stern interview.\n\nThe former married couple goes back and forth on Khloe’s intentions before a still hurt Kris takes it back to 2015.\n\n“What do you think I said to you about Vanity Fair?” Kris yelled into the phone. “You f—king say something nice or don’t say anything at all. All you said was negative s–t so now you know how I feel.”\n\n“Khloe is out there telling a bunch of s–t about the family,” Caitlyn says.\n\n“Khloe isn’t out to get you,” Kris said before bursting into tears. “You were her father. You are her dad since she’s been 5 years old. Like, give her a break.”\n\nApril 2017: Caitlyn Jenner releases tell-all book “The Secrets of My Life”\n\nCaitlyn Jenner again discussed Kris Jenner in her 2017 memoir “The Secrets of My Life.”\n\nIn one jaw-dropping claim, Caitlyn wrote, “I tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her. This will always be a subject of dispute between Kris and me as to how much she could intuit about my gender issues.”\n\nShe continued, “She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn…I told her I dressed as a woman, and she knew I did because I did it several times in front of her after we were married.”\n\nThe “lies” in Caitlyn’s book did not go over well with the family — especially Kim and Khloe Kardashian.\n\n“Everything she said is all made up,” Kris claimed to her daughters in an episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”\n\n“Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a bitch and an a–hole?” she said in the episode. “All through the book—Kris knew. Kris knew before I even made love to her. I’m like, ‘What?'”\n\n“I’ve never been so angry and disappointed in somebody in my whole life. I’m done,” Kris claimed.\n\nThe book resulted in the family distancing themselves from Caitlyn and not speaking to them for months or years, depending on the family member.\n\nKim also slammed Caitlyn in an episode of “KUWTK” for claiming in her book that her birth father Robert Kardashian believed his friend OJ Simpson was guilty of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson at one point.\n\n“I have always had Caitlyn’s back. She is a liar. She is not a good person,” Kim said.\n\nIn November, Caitlyn opened up about her estrangement from the family while speaking at Cambridge University.\n\n“They don’t want me in their lives. … In the book, I express some opinions and got shot down. It was not about the Kardashians. They were only mentioned on 20 pages. They made it more about them on television,” Caitlyn fired back.\n\nJanuary 2018: Caitlyn Jenner claims she “doesn’t trust” the Kardashians\n\nCaitlyn Jenner admitted on “Piers Morgan’s Life Stories” that she sent the Kardashians advanced copies of “The Secrets of My Life” — “except for the last few pages when I talked about gender confirmation [surgery].”\n\nWhy?\n\n“I didn’t want them to leak it to the press, okay?” Caitlyn told Morgan. “And there was no reason for them to know about it.”\n\nCaitlyn further admitted that she “didn’t trust” the Kardashians.\n\n“I didn’t tell anybody. Why? It’s none of their business,” Caitlyn said about telling them about her surgery. “It’s not that big a deal.”\n\nApril 2022: Kris Jenner reveals where she stands with Caitlyn Jenner\n\nPerhaps time heals all wounds.\n\nWhen asked by “Good Morning America’s” Robin Roberts about the status of Kris and Caitlyn’s relationship, Kris revealed, “We’re fine. Yeah, we’re friends, and I see her when she’s at a family thing so it’s, you know, settled down a lot.”\n\nRecalling her family’s reaction to Caitlyn’s transition, Kris added, “I think it was a big shock. It’s a scary thing to go through because you know nothing about it. It’s a subject I never thought that I would ever have to directly deal with [or] confront [or] be understanding about. Something that I didn’t you know, understand.”\n\nOctober 2023: Caitlyn Jenner says relationship with Kris Jenner is non-existent\n\nCaitlyn Jenner revealed the broken state of her relationship with ex-wife, Kris.\n\nDuring an interview on UK daytime show, “This Morning on Wednesday,” Caitlyn said the state of their relationship is “really sad.”\n\n“Kris, I really never talk to anymore,” she said. “If there’s any communication, my manager kind of talks to her.”\n\nCaitlyn also said that she is closer to her children, Kendall and Kylie than she is to the rest of the Kardashian Jenner family, which includes her step-children, Kim, Khloe, Kourtney, and Rob.\n\n“When you have as many kids as I have, you’re closer to some than you are to others… I certainly see them and we do this and that,” said Caitlyn. “I’m much closer to the Jenner side, but Kris, I don’t really have any more contact with her. It’s kind of sad because we went through a lot.”"
