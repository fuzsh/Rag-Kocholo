        "text": "She’s definitely not keeping up with the Kardashians.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner has revealed her relationship with ex-wife Kris Jenner is non-existent.\n\nThe Olympic gold medalist, 73, admitted during an interview on UK daytime talk show “This Morning” Wednesday that she and Kris “really never talk” anymore, adding, “It’s sad.”\n\n“If there’s any communication, my manager kind of talks to her and when you have as many kids as I have, you’re closer to some than you are to others … I certainly see them and we do this and that,” she continued, while promoting her new three-part tell-all series, “House Of Kardashian.”\n\n“I’m much closer to the Jenner side, but Kris, I don’t really have any more contact with her. It’s kind of sad because we went through a lot.”\n\nCaitlyn was married to Kris, 67, for 22 years before they divorced in 2015 — the same year the former decathlete came out as transgender.\n\nThey share two children together — Kendall Jenner, 27, and Kylie Jenner, 26 — and Caitlyn was also stepfather to Kris’ kids from her previous marriage to Robert Kardashian: Kourtney Kardashian, 44, Kim Kardashian, 42, Khloé Kardashian, 39, and Rob Kardashian, 36.\n\nThe blended family’s once tight-knit bond was very appealing to viewers, who watched their first reality TV show, “Keeping Up With The Kardashians,” from 2007 to 2021.\n\nOnce Caitlyn and Kris split, however, the former Wheaties spokesperson lost touch with several of her family members.\n\nThe relationships became even more fractured after Caitlyn released her 2017 memoir, “The Secrets Of My Life,” which included a terrible depiction of Kris and their marriage.\n\nIn her book, Caitlyn said Kris claimed she was “surprised” by her choice to transition.\n\nHowever, the former motivational speaker disputed, “I told her I dressed as a woman, and she knew I did, because I did it several times in front of her after we were married.”\n\nFor more Page Six reality TV updates …\n\nListen to our “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe revelations didn’t sit well with Kris or the Kardashian sisters, and things haven’t really improved since then. Caitlyn wasn’t even invited to Kourtney and Travis Barker’s third wedding in Italy in May 2022.\n\nHowever, the “I Am Cait” alum still chose to participate in the new documentary series that will explore the family’s dynamics, along with their scandals, controversial business deals and personal struggles.\n\nCaitlyn told “This Morning” she joined the series so she could defend the Kardashians.\n\n“I was happy to participate in the interview process to share my side which points to the strength, influence, and prowess my family has in captivating the world’s attention and keeping it over the years,” she said. “I am incredibly proud of all my children and stepchildren.“\n\nOnly time will tell how Caitlyn’s new commentary about the family will affect her relationship with them.\n\n“House Of Kardashian” will air on Sky Documentaries on Oct. 8."
