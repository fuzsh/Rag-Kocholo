        "text": "Observing celebrity lives is, in some ways a sport, armchair quarterbacking the lives of strangers who nevertheless have hung their issues out like a billboard. It’s like a bunch of headlines with no story, the Cliff’s Notes version of an existence. If you’re a person who pays attention to such things – and I’m one of those people, at least professionally – these stories, as thinly sketched as they are, can have you measuring your life against those sketches. I would never let my kid wear that! If he were my man, I’d have never let him star in a movie with a 22-year-old Victoria’s Secret model! No way would I accept such a small settlement – I’d own his whole company!\n\nWe don’t know what we’re talking about, but still we play the game of “What If” securely and maybe even a little smugly, like a couch-riding Johnny Unitas.\\So here’s a new one: What if your husband told you he was a woman?\n\nThe couch just got a little quieter, didn’t it?\n\nLinda Thompson‘s achingly honest Huffington Post essay on former husband Bruce Jenner’s body dysphoria, which he announced officially to the world in an ABC interview on Friday but which he told her about 30 years ago during the marriage, posed “What If” I had no real answers before. Even after watching Jenner’s honest, frustrating, fascinating conversation with Diane Sawyer, and being deeply moved by how sweetly adolescent and young this 65-year-old grandfather seemed, I don’t think I really internalized it until Thompson’s column. Of course, it doesn’t really matter what I think about it, because again I don’t know these people and their lives, no matter what his step-family the Kardashians would have you think, are not my business and not that important. (Really, Kim. They’re not.)\n\nBut like Linda Thompson, I am a wife, who chose to legally and emotionally entwine my life and my heart with someone else’s, knowing that the decisions they make about who they are and what they want for their future happiness will in some ways determine mine, whether I’m in it or not. And that’s where the actress, model and songwriter found herself when her famous, handsome husband’s confession shattered their idyllic existence of walking the beach with their two tow-headed angels went “Poof.” Thompson paints a picture of a beautiful celebrity dream , in which she first discovered the attractive Jenner watching the 1976 Olympics while lounging in bed with Elvis at Graceland, and later met him at the Playboy Mansion. She was living a dream, pretty people with pretty houses at pretty parties. They looked like an ad for something, Perfection with a capital “P.”\n\nAnd then in an instant, it all goes “Poof,” hearing that her partner in perfection, the holder of her heart, is unhappy in his own skin and has been for most of his life. Thompson writes that this was decades before most people knew that was possible, and she admits struggling to understand what it meant. And then she handled it the way I hope I would have. She sought the help of mental health professionals who specialized in gender identity. She tried to support her husband, tried to make their family work.\n\nIn the end, she admitted that she couldn’t do it, that if she’d known of her husband’ true identity she never would have married him, because “being married to a woman was not what I had envisioned for my life,” she writes. Even in the enlightened ’80s, I imagined that there was a pressure from society to stop being so selfish and stick it out for the kids. But she chose what she felt was the best thing for those kids, and for her, and I kind of wanted to hug her.\n\nMy husband sometimes walks by the TV as I’m watching some Investigation Discovery show on men who wind up in the compost while their widows s spend the life insurance policy on the handyman, and he says “Seriously, if you ever want to get rid of me, just leave me. I’ll give you anything you want,” and we laugh, because not only can neither of us imagining wanting to kill each other, we can’t imagine not wanting to be together. But we’ve also promised to be very honest about being honest, that if there is ever a moment that a secret truth was threatening to drown us from the inside, that we would honor the vows we made to each other by not hiding it. Marriage, as they say, is not for sissies, and when you share a house and cars and family and bank accounts, it’s hard to imagine untwisting them in any situation. But what if that person that you loved was literally not the person you thought they were? It would be hard not to make their struggle about you, but Thompson’s account is so sensitive, so thoughtful, that she didn’t just go “You lied to me, I’m outta here.” She tried. Would I try? I hope so. My God, who can say?\n\nIn the end, she notes wryly that she didn’t even take what most California celebrity wives would imagine to be their birthright in this situation, a big honking settlement. Thompson, instead, chose to honor the person she’d pledged her life to, because he was in pain, which meant she was in pain, and even if she wasn’t going to be intimately involved anymore, she fulfilled her vows by not taking advantage of his confusion and his truth. I wonder if I’d be so compassionate with the guy who’d blown up the life that he helped me create all the while knowing it was built on a lie? Would I be one of those bitter Jerry Springer harpies going “You better pay up, sucker!” Money can’t replace your life, but it can go a long way in creating a new one, right?\n\nI cannot imagine what Linda Thompson went through as her life imploded three decades ago, but I’m impressed with the woman she is now on the other side of those decades, on this side of that life. She has chosen to illuminate the public’s understanding of this person she used to live with kindness, with humanity. They share kids, even if, as she admits, he wasn’t always the best father. But she can reconcile that long-lost idyll with the separate lives they both lead now with the person Bruce Jenner is now, and give him her admiration. I cannot imagine what that’s like.\n\nBut I can hope that if the unimaginable happened, I’d have this much class."
