        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner 's romantic history is a bit complicated.\n\nThe 70-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star has three ex-wives, six kids, four step-kids and a rumoured fiancée that's almost 50 years her junior.\n\nBut now that Sophia Hutchins, 24, has finally come clean about their relationship status, here's a look back at Caitlyn's former lovers...\n\nChrystie Jenner\n\nChrystie was Caitlyn's first wife, when she was known as Bruce.\n\nBruce and Chyristie were married from 1972 to 1981, and she was there for her husband throughout his training for the Olympics, and after he won gold in the decathlon in 1972.\n\nTogether they welcomed son Burt, 41, and daughter Cassandra, 39.\n\nIn her book Secrets Of My Life, Caitlyn writes about her strained relationship with Chrystie, and how they had split when Burt was a baby.\n\nIt was after that when she met Linda Thompson during a celebrity tennis tournament at the Playboy mansion.\n\nThey liked each other, but Caitlyn felt she should give things another try with Chrystie and they got back together.\n\nShortly afterwards, Chyrstie fell pregnant with Cassandra, but when things didn't work out, one day she moved out of the home, taking the kids with her.\n\nLinda Thompson\n\nElvis Presley's ex Linda and then-Bruce tied the knot in Hawaii on January 5, 1981, within days of his divorce from Chrystie being settled.\n\nTogether they welcomed sons Brandon, 38, and Brody, 36.\n\nBut Caitlyn's relationship with all of her children - and her wife - became strained as she continued to struggle with her gender dysphoria.\n\nCaitlyn admitted she used to steal moments on her own when she could dress up and be her authentic self.\n\nShe and Linda eventually split after she confessed what she was going through and made the decision to transition into a woman.\n\nIn her book, she wrote about taking hormones that caused her to grow breasts as she began living her life as a woman.\n\nShe and Linda separated in 1986 and subsequently divorced, but everything changed for Caitlyn when she met Kris Jenner.\n\nKris Jenner\n\nCaitlyn and Kris met towards the end of 1990 and married just five months later on April 21, 1991.\n\nThey both had four kids, with Caitlyn becoming a step-parent to Kourtney Kardashian, 41, Kim, 39, Khloe, 35, and Rob, 33.\n\nTogether, they went on to welcome daughters Kendall, 24, and Kylie, 22, meaning they soon had 10 kid between them.\n\nCaitlyn admitted in her book that she barely saw her four eldest children after beginning her romance with Kris, and there's been plenty of beef in the family over the years, with Brandon and Brody accusing Kris of keeping them away from their dad.\n\nThe family, of course, went on to star in Keeping Up With The Kardashians together, living their lives in the spotlight.\n\nKris and Bruce were married for years, before they finally decided to separate in June 2013, although the split wasn't made public until the October.\n\nKris filed for divorce in September 2014, citing irreconcilable differences, and the proceedings were finalised in the December.\n\nRonda Kamihira\n\nFollowing her split from Kris and before coming out as Caitlyn, Bruce was rumoured to be dating one of Kris' best friends and former assistant Ronda Kamihira.\n\nAt the time, the reports caused a lot of drama in the Kardashian household.\n\nKris was said to be left devastated by the romance between her ex-husband and her friend of 20 years.\n\nKris was reportedly \"crying herself to sleep every night\" with the betrayal hitting even harder given that Kendall and Kylie grew up as best friends with Ronda's kids.\n\nAt the time, Bruce had grown out his hair and was secretly beginning to make the transition to becoming Caitlyn.\n\nSophia Hutchins\n\nAfter becoming Caitlyn and unveiling herself to the world on the cover of Vanity Fair in 2015, she found her confidence to be the person she'd always wanted to be.\n\nRather than shying away from public gatherings and parties, Caitlyn fully immersed herself in the showbiz world and became a regular attendee of glitzy bashes.\n\nBut everyone was desperate to know who she'd date next.\n\nDuring an interview with Diane Sawyer, Caitlyn said she considered herself to be \"asexual for now\".\n\nCaitlyn struggled with her femininity and admitted on her show I Am Cait that she'd feel more feminine if she dated a man, and said that she \"appreciates the male form\".\n\nCaitlyn had told Sawyer: \"I am, as far as I know, heterosexual.\n\n\"As far as I know, I've never been with a guy. I've always been married, raising kids.\"\n\n\"And you can desire a woman every bit as much?\" Sawyer later asked.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Caitlyn responded.\n\nSawyer continued: \"If you are a male and you become a female, but you like women, are you a lesbian? Are you a heterosexual who…\"\n\nBut Caitlyn jumped in: \"You're going back to the sex thing and it's apples and oranges.\"\n\nBut in 2017, people became convinced she had fallen madly in love with model Sophia Hutchins after the pair became inseparable, with Sophia acting as Caitlyn's plus one wherever she went, be it a red carpet event or a Kardashian family party.\n\nDespite their almost 50-year gap, rumours swirled that they were engaged and planning to have children together.\n\nHowever, Sophia has finally set the record straight in an interview on the Juicy Scoop podcast with Heather McDonald.\n\nShe said: \"It was never romantic. It was never sexual. It was very much friends.\"\n\nSophia met Caitlyn through their hairstylist and they became friends, and Sophia took over managing Caitlyn from her ex-wife Kris following their divorce.\n\nShe later moved in with Caitlyn and became her full time manager, but it seems she may want to move out soon.\n\nShe said: \"That's kind of the extent to our relationship.\n\n\"It's very parental, very protective. But, at the same time, it's also businessy.\n\n\"It's like we're family. All of my family is in Seattle... it's been nice to feel like you have family where you're living.\n\n\"As far as romance, no.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I don't want to leave her by herself, but she also knows and I know that I'm getting older - like I want to be able to kind of have my own life.\"\n\nSophia even said that Caitlyn had caught her in bed with someone else.\n\nShe said: \"[She] kind of saw a lot of things happening, and so it's kind of like living with your parents.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Oh, this might be a turning point where I might need to move out'.\""
