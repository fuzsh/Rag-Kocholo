        "text": "The longer the Queen of All Media has been away from the spotlight to battle a dementia diagnosis, the more we realized she was right about a lot of things that were considered controversial during her time on radio and on her eponymous talk show, The Wendy Williams Show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom closeted rappers and the politics of Hollywood to celebs behaving badly behind the scenes—including Nicki Minaj, Diddy, R.Kelly, Whitney and more—Wendy was among the first to let us know that all is not what it seems. And she mostly kept quiet about everything ... mostly.\n\nNow with chatter circulating that there will reportedly be another installment of her controversial Lifetime docuseries, just as she celebrates her 60th birthday, we thought now would be the perfect time to recognize Wendy for all the hot tea she has poured for pop culture over the years.\n\nBuckle up.\n\nFrom her radio show to the TV, Wendy has always hinted at her “pissing a lot of people off” in the rap game for talking about what allegedly went down behind the scenes. The person she seemed to have pissed off the most was Diddy. When she finally got the Bad Boy mogul on her talk show, it was all “grown” smiles and respect. “Get into,” she urged the audience. Yet many of Wendy’s longtime fans remember a time when she talked about being treated like a pariah for talking about who Diddy really was behind the scenes.\n\nWe have to admit, it takes some serious guts to come on someone else’s talk show and try to insult them, but that’s exactly what Omarosa did just as Wendy was trying to get her talk show off the ground. In hindsight, the interview revealed that the former “The Apprentice” reality star was calculated about courting controversy—which could explain why she later joined Former President Trump’s administration to allegedly help Black people, and we all know how that turned out.\n\nWendy always made it clear that she was not willing to play the Hollywood game: she went home to her husband and son in New Jersey, and she said several times on the air how much she did not like to fraternize with celebrities. This came out the most whenever she was compared to Oprah. She said many times that she was “Noprah,” and liked to keep her distance from celebrities in case she needed to talk about them on Hot Topics. When that whole mess with Mo”Nique, Oprah, Tyler Perry and Lee Daniels popped off, she went absolutely in on everybody involved.\n\nThere is a reason Wendy Williams always referred to Kardashian mastermind Kris Jenner as “That Woman.” According to Wendy, Kris was the mastermind behind making Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian household names—which, according to Ray J, included brokering a deal for that alleged tape to get out to the public. However, as the years went on, Wendy seemed to gain a certain amount of respect for Kris and even began to applaud some of her alleged deals behind the scenes to keep the Kardashian’s in the limelight.\n\nWill Smith knew Wendy Williams liked to talk about him, so much so that he even dissed her in a song, rapping: “Wendy Williams, you don’t know me/I’m not your punching bag, you gon’ blow me/Up, girl, better leave me alone/Before I buy your radio station and send you home.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell that didn’t stop Wendy from being shady on the radio or on her talk show when the topic of Will Smith and his alleged arrangement with Jada came up. Case and point above."
