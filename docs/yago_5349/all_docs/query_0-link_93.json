        "text": "LOS ANGELES (CBSMiami/AP) — After a year of being separated, but still living together, the chaos in the Kardashian home is over.\n\nKris Jenner is ending her 22-year year marriage to Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner.\n\nThe \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" matriarch filed for divorce on Monday in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe pair's relationship and its troubles have been featured prominently on the reality show that focuses heavily on Kris Jenner's daughters from a previous marriage, Kourtney, Kim and Khloe Kardashian.\n\nThe women and their brother Rob were born during Kris Jenner's previous marriage to Los Angeles attorney Robert Kardashian, who she divorced in 1991.\n\nKris and Bruce Jenner have two children together, daughters Kendall and Kylie. The divorce petition seeks joint custody of 17-year-old Kylie Jenner.\n\nBruce Jenner won the gold medal for men's decathlon in the 1976 Olympics.\n\nCourt filings say he and Kris Jenner separated on June 1. The filings do not provide any additional details or how the former couple will split their assets.\n\nThe divorce was first reported by celebrity website RadarOnline.com.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n(TM and © Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
