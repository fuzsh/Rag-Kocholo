        "text": "Working in the modeling industry has been overwhelming at times, for at least one of the Kardashian sisters.\n\n“I’ve had really dark nights where I’ve been in, you know, kind of random cities and hysterically crying myself to sleep because I haven’t been home in three months, and I’ve been pretty much alone the entire time,” Jenner said on Aug. 1.\n\nJenner’s younger sister, Kylie Jenner, is also a model who started her career appearing in “Crush Your Style” TV ads for Sears in 2010.\n\nA licensed clinical psychologist sums up Kendall Jenner’s homesick experience with the modeling industry as relatively normal.\n\n“Like Kendall, many models of a younger age likely experience similar feelings of pressure, homesickness, and emotional exhaustion,” the Boca Recovery Center’s Dr. Alison Tarlow told The Epoch Times.\n\n“The modeling industry is very demanding for young people, so stress and mental health issues are common.”\n\nKendall Jenner is the daughter of Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, and reality television star Kris Jenner, formerly married to the late attorney Robert Kardashian.\n\nKendall Jenner told Chamberlain that the modeling industry can be overwhelming.\n\n“I’m on a job, and something really crazy happens at home that I would love to be there for, and I’m being told I can’t be,” she said. “There’s been a lot of definite moments where I’m like, ‘What is going on … is this all worth it?’”\n\nThe 5-foot-9 model became famous for starring in 20 seasons of her family’s reality television show, “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” from 2007 to 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Kendall Jenner launched the alcohol brand 818 Tequila, where she is the chief creative officer.\n\nKendall Jenner noted that connecting with family and friends and having high self-esteem are important when pursuing a modeling career.\n\nThe 28-year-old said being a successful model requires “a lot of great people around you, a great support system, and great family, great friends.”\n\n“For anyone who would ever want to do it, I think it’s literally having a great relationship with yourself … enough to be able to go home at the end of the night and still look yourself in the mirror and be happy and love yourself,” she added.\n\nIn addition to Kylie Jenner, Kendall Jenner has three older half-brothers and one older half-sister from her father, Caitlyn Jenner, and three older half-sisters and one older half-brother from her mother, Kris Jenner, formerly Kris Kardashian.\n\nTarlow praised Kendall Jenner for revealing that magazine covers are not always as “perfect and shiny” as they may appear.\n\n“There is hair and makeup and lighting, [but] the physical [aspect] of it is not always that way, you know? You’re in the best hands and setting,” Kendall Jenner said on the podcast.\n\n“Kendall’s coming out to share her experience is very important in order to shine a light on the perception of glamour and perfection that is so often associated with the modeling industry,” said Tarlow, a certified addictions professional.\n\n“Such limelight on the pressures and challenges could turn attention to the risks of substance abuse among models and thus provoke the development of better systems of support and prevention.”\n\nKendall Jenner was also honest about the perks of being a top model, which she says include “inspiration,” “friends,” and “meeting cool creative people.”\n\nKendall Jenner could benefit from a grounding routine that includes mindfulness, physical activity, and creative outlets as a way to avoid substance use, according to Tarlow.\n\n“She could add in therapy sessions consistently, and journaling,” Tarlow added. “Photo shoots, fashion shows, and promotional events may be physically and emotionally tiring and allow little time for rest, personal life, or quiet time alone.”"
