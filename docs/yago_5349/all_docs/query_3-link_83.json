Kris is also a mother to Kourtney, 34, Kim, 32, Khloe, 29, and Rob, 26, with first husband Robert Kardashian, who died in 2003.\n\nBruce has four children from previous relationships, including sons Brody, 30, and Brandon, 32.\n\n\"We are happier this way,\" Kris said of the split, which she and her family kept secret for a year."
