        "text": "As Kris and Bruce Jenner announce their split, we take a look through their incredible (by which we mean awfully cringey) family photo album.\n\nManager mum Kris, 57, and former Olympian Bruce, 63, were set up on a blind date back in 1990 and went on to marry less than a year later, with Kris saying that Bruce's marriage proposal was a total surprise.\n\n\"We were at a restaurant and he just dropped to a knee. We had been house-hunting all day and we were thinking about moving in together, and then I thought to myself, driving to the restaurant that we were going to, 'I must be out of my mind that we're house-hunting.\n\n\"We're not even married, we're not even engaged!' And that night he just busted out a move. He said, 'I am totally in love with you and would you marry me?' I was very surprised,\" she revealed.\n\nAll VERY sweet, yes? Love them or loathe them, we reckon 99% of you will always have a special little place in the reality TV section of your hearts for the pair (or just us?).\n\nEven when rumours of a split surfaced last year Kris was quick to squash them, saying: \"That is the most ridiculous... we've been married almost 22 years. We fight all the time. Everybody fights after 21 years, but he kind of stays away, gets to the golf course and tries to stay out of my way.\"\n\nBut now they've finally confirmed their separation with a statement issued on Tuesday, saying: \"We are living separately and we are much happier this way.\n\n\"But we will always have much love and respect for each other. Even though we are separated we will always remain best friends and, as always, our family will remain our number one priority.\n\n\"We ended a marriage, but that's not the end of our friendship. I will always love him, but we are no longer a couple in that way,\" she continued. \"We are happier this way.\"\n\nTogether they have two daughters - Kylie and Kendall - while Bruce has four kids from a previous marriage and Kris has four kids from her marriage with OJ Simpson lawyer Robert Kardashian.\n\nTake a look at our gallery of the couple's best, and most cringey, moments over the years."
