        "text": "Caitlyn’s first wife was Chrystie Crownover, from 1972 until 1981. Their first son Burt was born September 6, 1978, and is 43 years old. The oldest Jenner son has three children with his girlfriend Valerie Pitalo. He is a professional truck racer, and has loved racing since his dad took him go-karting as a child, he revealed in a 2015 Esquire profile, per Hollywood Life. In August 2021, he shared a photo of Netflix’s documentary Untold Caitlyn Jenner with his 263k followers explaining that it was the best feature he has have ever seen about his dad. “I give the director and team a ton of credit, I’ve seen a lot of specials, articles, interviews, etc of my dad, but this one was the best,” he wrote. “I think it was extra special for me because it was cool to finally see my mom get the credit I believe she deserves,” he added, about his mom Chrystie.\n\nCaitlyn’s first daughter is Cassandra Marino. She was born on June 10, 1980, and is Caitlyns and Christie’s second child. The 41-year-old is an interior designer who has kept herself largely out of the public eye and has a private Instagram account. She has three children whom she shares with her husband Michael Marino. In 2016, she gave a rare interview with PEOPLE where she gave an update on her relationship with Caitlyn. “My relationship with Caitlyn is much better than with Bruce, but we still have a lot of work to do,” she explained. “We didn’t talk for years, and now we see each other every couple of weeks and talk on the phone, which I am grateful for.”\n\nYou might remember Brandon Jenner from his brief appearances on Keeping up with the Kardashians. After Caitlyn and Chrystie divorced, she married Linda Thompson and had 2 more sons. Brandon was the first born and the 41-year-old is a musician, singer, and songwriter. He has been married twice and has three children. He and Leah James were married from 2012-to 2019 and welcomed a daughter named Eva on July 22, 2015. He is now married to Cayley Stoker and they welcomed twin sons Bo Thompson and Sam Stoker in February 2020. Brandon has 1.3 million followers on Instagram and is very active on the app, sharing updates with his new music to his fans.\n\nWhen it comes to being a “celebrity” Brody Jenner has followed more in the Kardashian footsteps than the rest of his siblings. Brody is Caitlyn and Linda’s second child and he has a string of TV shows on his resume. Brody actually got his start in reality TV first, starring in The Hills, from 2006-to 2010. He went on to star in The Princes of Malibu, Bromance, Sex with Brody, Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Very Cavallari, and The Hills: New Beginnings. Now Brody has his own line of hard Seltzer called Mamitas. Brody has 3.5 million followers on Instagram and is very close to his brother Brandon and their mom. He recently confirmed that his new girlfriend is Tia Blanco, and he and Kendall are the only Jenner without kids."
