        "text": "What Is Caitlyn Jenner's Net Worth?\n\nCaitlyn Jenner is an American Olympic Gold Medalist and American television personality who has a net worth of $25 million. Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, is a former Olympic athlete as well as a transgender rights advocate. She began her athletic career in college, where she excelled in track and field and earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic team. In 1976, Jenner won the gold medal in the decathlon at the Montreal Olympics, setting a new world record in the process. After retiring from athletics, Jenner became involved in television and media, appearing in numerous commercials, TV shows, and movies. She also launched a line of exercise equipment and other products.\n\nJenner was married to Kris Kardashian (who became known as Kris Jenner) from 1991 to 2015. They welcomed two daughters together, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner. Jenner has four other children from two previous marriages, including model/actors Brandon and Brody Jenner.\n\nIn 2007, Jenner made headlines again when she began appearing on the reality television show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" which followed the lives of her stepchildren and their extended family. Her appearances on the show helped to make her a household name and cemented her status as a celebrity.\n\nHowever, it was not until 2015 that Jenner made her biggest announcement yet. In an interview with Diane Sawyer, she revealed that she was transgender and planned to undergo gender reassignment surgery. She also announced that she would be changing her name to Caitlyn. Jenner's announcement was met with both support and criticism, with many praising her for her courage and honesty, while others expressed skepticism or even outright hostility. Jenner's journey as a transgender woman was chronicled in a documentary series called \"I Am Cait,\" which premiered on the E! network in 2015. Since coming out as transgender, Jenner has become a vocal advocate for transgender rights, using her platform to raise awareness and promote acceptance of the transgender community. She has also been involved in politics, running for governor of California in 2021 as a Republican candidate.\n\nTax Return Income\n\nIn July 2021, as part of her campaign for governor of California, Caitlyn released several years' worth of tax records. Those records revealed the following incomes by year:\n\n2016: $2.5 million (the second season of her reality show \"I Am Cait\")\n\n2017: $1.9 million (the year her memoir \"The Secrets of My Life\" was released)\n\n2018: $550 thousand\n\n2019: $550 thousand\n\nEarly Life\n\nCaitlyn Marie Jenner was born William Bruce Jenner on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York. Her parents are Esther Ruth and William Hugh Jenner, and she is of English, Scottish, Welsh, Dutch, and Irish descent.\n\nJenner attended Sleepy Hollow High School in New York and Newton High School in Newton, Connecticut, graduating in 1968. Jenner struggled with dyslexia but earned a football scholarship to attend Graceland College. She was forced to stop playing, however, due to a knee injury. Graceland's coach recognized Jenner's potential and encouraged her to switch to training for a decathlon. She finished in fifth place at the Drake Relays decathlon in Des Moines, IA.\n\nDecathlon Career\n\nJenner competed at the 1972 Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon. With the last event remaining, Jenner was in fifth place and needed to make up a 19-second gap in the men's 1500 meters. She qualified for the team due to finishing an astonishing 22 seconds ahead of the other runners on her final lap. Following the trials, Jenner finished tenth in the decathlon at the 1972 Olympics, held in Munich. After graduating college in 1973, Jenner married flight attendant Chrystie Crownover and the two moved to San Jose, CA. Jenner trained during the day at the San Jose City College and San Jose State University tracks and sold insurance at night to make ends meet.\n\nJenner was featured on the cover of Track & Field News in August 1974 following an American championship win in the men's decathlon event in 1974. She also won the French national championship the following year and a gold medal at the Pan-American Games. At this point, she was setting new world records. Between 1973 and 1976, Jenner completed 13 decathlons and only lost one.\n\nJenner achieved five personal bests on the first day of the men's decathlon in the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, walking away from the Games that year with the gold medal and a new world-record score of 8,618 points. After the event, Jenner took an American flag from a spectator and carried it during the victory lap, thus beginning a now-common tradition among winning Olympians.\n\nJenner became a national hero after winning the gold, receiving the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States, and being named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year in 1976. Jenner's 1976 world and Olympic record was broken by four points by Daley Thompson at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.\n\nShortly after her success at the Olympics, Jenner's brother Burt was tragically killed in a car accident.\n\nPost-Olympics\n\nJenner experienced further fame and success after the exposure the Olympic win had offered. She posed for covers of popular magazines like \"Sports Illustrated\" and \"Playgirl.\" She became a spokesperson for cereal brand Wheaties and other brands like Tropicana and enjoyed minor success with various small television and movie roles. Jenner had a recurring role on the TV series \"CHiPS\" in 1981 as Officer Steve McLeish. She starred in the reality TV series \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" from 2007 to 2016 and the TV miniseries documentary \"I Am Cait\" from 2015 to 2016. It was announced in November 2019 that Jenner would be appearing in the 19th season of \"I'm a Celebrity…Get Me out of Here!\"\n\nTransition to Caitlyn\n\nJenner cross-dressed and took hormone therapy treatments throughout her life but stopped after meeting Kris Kardashian. After she divorced Kris, she continued on her path toward becoming a woman.\n\nIn April 2015, Jenner sat down for an interview with Diane Sawyer on \"20/20\" to reveal that she had the soul of a female and that she was a trans woman. Later that year, Jenner debuted her new name and image to the public and legally changed her name to Caitlyn Marie Jenner in July 2015.\n\nCaitlyn underwent sex reassignment surgery in January 2017, thus completing her transition. She now speaks movingly about her journey and publicly revealed her transition on the cover of \"Vanity Fair\" magazine in June 2015.\n\nFollowing her transition, Jenner started a Twitter account, which reached one million followers in the Guinness World Record time of 4 hours and 3 minutes. By sharing her journey with the world, Caitlyn Jenner became a high-profile voice for the transgender community. She has been praised and honored for her courage and for sharing her story with the world.\n\nThe E! Network filmed an eight-part series about Jenner's transition that aired following the reveal in \"Vanity Fair.\" For the Jenner children, the issue of the transition is a non-issue. They were already aware of their father's identity as a woman when he told them individually about the transition prior to surgery, and all of them feel both happiness for their father and inspiration at Caitlyn's bravery.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nJenner has been married three times, first to Chrystie Crownover from 1972 to 1981. The two share a son and a daughter. Jenner was married to Linda Thompson from 1981 to 1986, and they have two sons together.\n\nOn April 21, 1991, Jenner and Kris Kardashian got married after just five months of dating. They have two daughters together, Kendall and Kylie. Jenner was also the step-parent to Kris's children Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, and Robert from her previous marriage, who all starred in \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\" Kris filed for divorce in September 2014, and their divorce was finalized in December of that year\n\nJenner was involved in a fatal multi-car collision on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu in February 2015. Kim Howe, an actress and animal rights activist, was killed when Jenner's SUV ran into her car. There were no criminal charges filed, but three civil lawsuits were filed by Howe's stepchildren and drivers of other cars involved. Financial details were not released in either settlement.\n\nMalibu Estate\n\nIn 2013, Caitlyn (then still living as Bruce) leased a beach home in Malibu for $14,500 per month while his marriage to Kris was in doubt. In 2018, the home was listed for sale at $7.99 million. This home was featured in \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\"\n\nIn March 2015, a year after Kris filed for divorce, Bruce paid $3.575 million for a home high up in the hills of Malibu.\n\nSituated on an arid hilltop, the 3,500-square-foot house has four bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms and is surrounded by about 11 acres of private property. The design is clean, spare, and minimalist – almost industrial – and features concrete and glass, plus heavy wood beam accents.\n\nThe interior features bright, neutral walls, hardwood floors, and recessed lighting. The entrance leads almost right away to a step-down living room area, where the stone fireplace is the central focal point of the room. The bright, airy bathroom offers a vanity and Jacuzzi tub. There are plenty of sliding glass doors around the home, particularly in the bedrooms, and it has glass walls that allow for plenty of light.\n\nPolitical Views\n\nIt's worth pointing out that even though Jenner is a transexual woman, she is a practicing Christian and identifies as a conservative when it comes to politics. She is a Republican who voted for Trump in the 2016 elections – although her choice was seen as an act of rejection of Hillary Clinton more than genuine support for Trump.\n\nShe later protested Trump's decision to ban trans individuals from serving in the military and declared that she had made a mistake by voting for him. This echoed the opinions of many within the LGBTQ community who felt they had been misled by Trump during his election campaign.\n\nAdditional Ventures\n\nJenner also had a short career as a racecar driver, winning the 1986 12 Hours of Sebring. In addition, she became involved in a number of entrepreneurial pursuits, such as licensing her name for a franchise of aerobics centers. She started a company called Jenner Aviation, which sells aircraft supplies to various corporations. Jenner also served as vice president for a software company that created an application called JennerNet. Caitlyn later became the face of H&M Sport. In 2022, she founded Jenner Racing, an all-female team in the W Series open-wheel championship.\n\nTV Career\n\nBruce Jenner starred in a number of made-for-television movies and series, including \"The Golden Moment: An Olympic Love Story,\" \"CHiPs,\" and the sitcom \"Silver Spoons.\" Aside from acting, Bruce also became involved in a variety of reality TV series and game shows. These included \"The Weakest Link,\" \"I'm A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!,\" \"Skating With Celebrities,\" \"Pet Star,\" and \"The Apprentice.\" Today, Caitlyn Jenner is probably best known for her past appearances on \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\""
