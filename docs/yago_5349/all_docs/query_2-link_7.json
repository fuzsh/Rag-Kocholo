        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner[1] (born William Bruce Jenner, October 28, 1949) is an American former track and field athlete, television personality and politician.\n\nAfter her Olympic career, her professional career changed into being a television celebrity. By 1981, she had starred in several television movies.\n\nJenner married the socialite Kris Jenner. The couple has two daughters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner. Since 2007, she is best known for the reality television program Keeping Up with the Kardashians. She is the stepmother of the Kardashian sisters.\n\nIn 2015, Jenner came out as transgender. In June 2015, Jenner had completed her transition and changed her name to Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nShe was a candidate for Governor of California in the 2021 recall election as a Republican.[2] She received one percent of the votes, and she finished in 13th place.[3] She was later hired by Fox News as an on-air contributor.[4]\n\nEarly life\n\n[change | change source]\n\nJenner is from Mount Kisco, New York.[5] She studied at Newtown High School in Newtown, Connecticut,.[5] Jenner got a football scholarship to Graceland College (now Graceland University) in Iowa. A knee injury caused her to stop playing football. She changed to the decathlon. Jenner first decathlon was at the Drake Relays in 1970. She finished in fifth place.\n\nOlympic career\n\n[change | change source]\n\nJenner placed third in the decathlon at the 1972 U.S. Olympic trials.[6] She finished in tenth place at the 1972 Munich games.[7] Because she did so well in getting to the Olympics, she chose focus her time almost entirely on training.[8] She sold insurance when not training.[5] In the years before professionalism was allowed in athletics, this kind of full-time training was unusual. During that time, she spent eight hours a day at the San Jose City College track.[5][9] San Jose at the time was a main place for training Olympic athletes. Millard Hampton, Andre Phillips, John Powell, Mac Wilkins, Al Feuerbach and others also trained there.[9][10] In 1974 and 1976, Jenner was the American champion in the decathlon.[11]\n\nAt the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, she won the gold medal in the Decathlon. She set the world record of 8,618 points. Her record was broken by just 4 points by Daley Thompson in 1980. In 1985, the IAAF Decathlon scoring table was changed. Using the new table, Jenner's score was 8634 when comparing her to modern athletes. As of 2011, Jenner is #25 on the world all-time list and #9 on the American all-time list.[12]\n\nJenner was a national hero due to winning the Olympic decathlon. She won the 1976 James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Jenner was also the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year in 1976. She was made a part of the Olympic Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame, the Connecticut Sports Hall of Fame in 1994 and the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1980.\n\nIn the 1970s, Olympic athletes were required to be amateur. They were not allowed to be paid as a sports celebrity. In 1972, three major Olympic sports (basketball, 100 meters and decathlon), were won by Soviet athletes. Winning the decathlon title made Jenner an American hero. After this, Jenner wanted to earn money because of her celebrity. If she did this, she could not take part in the Olympics again. She left her equipment in the stadium. She did not expect to ever use them again. Shortly after the Games, Jenner's picture was used on the front of Wheaties brand breakfast cereal as a \"Wheaties champion.\" Since then, photographs of several hundred athletes have been used on the boxes. Jenner is one of only seven Wheaties \"spokesmen.\" She was asked to go to the White House to meet with President Gerald R. Ford.\n\nOn November 22, 1977, Jenner went to San Francisco to testify in court against complaints that General Mills, the makers of Wheaties, had been using false advertising about her eating Wheaties. Jenner said that she liked the cereal and ate it two to three times per week. Two days later the court case was stopped.[13]\n\nIn 1977, the Kansas City Kings picked Jenner with the 139th pick of the NBA Draft. Jenner had not played basketball since high school. She did not play for them.\n\nJenner decided to try for a television career. She had some success. Jenner starred in the television movies \"The Golden Moment: An Olympic Love Story\" (1980) and \"Grambling's White Tiger\" (1981). In 1981–82, she began acting on the police series CHiPs.
