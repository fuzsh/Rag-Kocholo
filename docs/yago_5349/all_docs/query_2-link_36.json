        "text": "Sophia Hutchins, who lives with Caitlyn Jenner, says that the 70-year-old is absolutely not getting married ever again. In fact, her 23-year-old friend says that Jenner, who has been married and divorced three times, is not really even interested in dating.\n\n\"Caitlyn will never, ever, ever [get married again],\" Hutchins told InTouch Weekly. \"Caitlyn is 70 and has been divorced three times and has 10 kids! She's done.\n\n\"Caitlyn definitely doesn't date,\" Hutchins continued. \"Caitlyn definitely has tried to set me up with people, but Caitlyn has terrible taste. Our taste is so different and I don't even know if Caitlyn could set [me up]. Caitlyn's just weird about dating... We don't set each other up!\"\n\nIronically, there were rumors last month that Hutchins and Jenner could actually be romantically involved with each other. Hutchins was quick to shoot that speculation down in an interview with The New York Times in December.\n\nHutchins said that the rumors started swirling just because neither her nor Jenner addressed them, but she made it clear they were false.\n\n\"I don't feel a need to address my sex life, quite frankly, unless I want to,\" she told the Times, and said that she was simply Jenner's manager.\n\n\"I saw nobody was managing her, and there were all these people taking massive advantage,\" Hutchins said. \"And I was saying, 'Caitlyn, if I don't step in here and start managing you, you're going to go broke.'\"\n\nIn the InTouch Weekly piece, Hutchins says that she, too, is not currently dating anyone, although she was with somebody last month when the New York Times piece was published."
