        "text": "Here’s what you need to know about the former beauty queen who walked away from the love of her life, the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll himself.\n\nPost-Priscilla era\n\nIn an interview on CNN, Thompson described how, while she was living in Memphis and having just won Miss Tennessee Universe in 1972, she was invited to a screening at the Memphian Theatre. Elvis was there and they immediately bonded as they were both Southerners. Thompson said she joked about his collar being up, apparently telling him “dressed a little like Dracula aren’t we?” The joke cemented their connection.\n\nShe said she thought he was still married. Although he and Priscilla were separated, it was not yet public knowledge. Thompson said Elvis pursued her and flew her to Vegas to watch him perform. She said she was still a virgin when she met the Jailhouse Rock singer, telling CNN’s Larry King that it took months before they slept together because she wanted to “make it right”. She soon moved to Graceland and the couple were inseparable for four and a half years.\n\nThe split\n\nThompson said she and Elvis discussed getting married and having children, but she said she realised she wanted a different life. “By the time I reconciled in my mind that this was something that I didn’t want to do, he was ready. I was ready more in the beginning,” she told King.\n\nThompson said the couple were up “literally up all night” and asleep during the day. She said he was loyal to her for the first year, but then he began cheating on her. Thompson said he would apologise profusely but then would do it again anyway.\n\nShe said she broke up with him and explained that, although he was the love of her life, she could not carry on with the life they had been living. They broke up eight months before his death, but remained in contact.\n\nThe best part of Elvis Presley\n\nAlthough Elvis notoriously cheated on all his partners, Thompson says that strangely she felt he did not cheat on her “emotionally”. She said he was an incredibly generous man whose kindness was “unequalled by anyone I’ve ever met”.\n\nThe Elvis Presley legacy\n\nThompson admitted that by the time they split, Elvis had stopped taking care of himself and hit a downward spiral. She called some of his behaviour “self-destructive” and “difficult”, according to Smooth Radio. She said the musician gave his all on stage and despite their split, he had an impact on her perception of life, love, romance, marriage and what it means to be a family, she told CNN.\n\nThe movie\n\nThe release of the Elvis biopic has been criticised for leaving out some key people in the star’s life, one of them being Thompson.\n\nOn Instagram, she addressed the exclusion, posting an image of herself inside Graceland, saying, “Nobody can ever take away your knowledge of the truth.”\n\nThe Kardashian connection\n\nAfter breaking up with Elvis, Thompson married Caitlyn Jenner in 1981. In a twist of fate, Thompson says she was with Elvis in hospital when they watched Jenner compete at the 1976 Olympics. She said at the time she turned to Elvis and said, “I’m going to marry that guy.” He responded, “Over my dead body.” She remarked, “Truth is stranger than fiction.”\n\nThompson and Jenner have two children together – Brody and Brandon."
