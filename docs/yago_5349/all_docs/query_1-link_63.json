        "text": "This month marks seven years since Caitlyn Jenner came out as transgender, but the memory of her big reveal is still fresh for her ex-wife, Kris Jenner. The 66-year-old momager says it came as a “big shock” for their entire family, doubling down on claims that they knew “nothing about it”.\n\n\"It’s a subject I never thought that I would ever have to directly deal with or confront or be understanding about. Something that I didn’t, you know, understand,” she says.\n\nKris has in the past been candid about her ex’s transition. Even though she’s grown to accept it, she says it took a while for her and her family to understand. “It was a process, it was a shock, and then it was a reality, and it was something that we had to absorb and try to wrap our heads around and learn about.”\n\nREAD MORE | The making of a momager: How Kris Jenner went from being clueless about cash to a billionaire\n\nHer comments, however, contradict Caitlyn’s claims that Kris knew about her struggles with her gender. In 2017 Caitlyn, who was married to Kris for 23 years, published a memoir called The Secrets of my Life, where she wrote that Kris knew about her gender crisis long before her transition and the family experienced a rift.\n\nKris called out the 72-year-old former Olympian saying it was “all made up”. “Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a b**** and an a-hole?” she asked her kids in an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians (KUWTK).\n\nKris, who shares daughters Kendall Jenner (26) and Kylie Jenner (24) with Caitlyn, says she was concerned the book will be there for younger generations of the family to read. “Everything was like I am such a bad person. Your children are going to read this book about their grandparent and have a story that’s fabricated,” she told Kendall.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer in 2017, Caitlyn admitted the news affected her relationship with her kids. “Some of my children I have remained very close to. A couple of them . . . I’m a little more distant,” she told Diane.\n\nDespite the tension, Caitlyn appeared on KUWTK until 2021 and it seems the relationships between her, Kris and their kids have been mended. Last year Kris said she and Caitlyn were respectful with one another. “She’s the father of two of my kids, and so that speaks volumes.”\n\nAnd during a recent podcast, Caitlyn also spoke about their family dynamics saying they are all on good terms. “My relationship with the family is, you know, fine. I mean, we do things together, my kids, this and that. I just had my 20th grandchild a couple weeks ago and that’s my son, Burt, the oldest son,” she shared on the Full Send Podcast.\n\nThough they all seem to get along better these days, Caitlyn won’t star in their upcoming Hulu reality show, The Kardashians, which premieres later this month. But she’s not holding no grudges. “To be able to work with my family for all those years on KUWTK, connect with the fans, it was incredible,” she says. “I’m happy that it continues for my family.”"
