        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner burnt bridges with her former family.\n\nKhloé Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Scott Disick discussed their estranged relationship with Caitlyn, 74, during the Season 5 premiere of Hulu’s “The Kardashians” on Thursday.\n\nIn the scene, which was filmed in the fall of 2023, the trio react to Caitlyn’s involvement in the “House of Kardashian” docuseries that aired last year without the family’s involvement.\n\n“There is this new documentary about our family, and apparently whoever has been calling people that have either once been in our lives or are in our lives to do the documentary, and no one has really agreed to do it. Except for Caitlyn,” Khloé, 39, says in a confessional.\n\nKhloé, Kris, 68, and Scott, 40, watch part of the doc where Caitlyn can be heard talking about Kim Kardashian.\n\nAn unnamed woman’s voice in the doc says that Kris “wanted to be more than just a Housewife,” which gets a rise out of the momager.\n\n“Shoot me. I wanted to be more than just a Housewife. Okay, so? Kill me,” Kris says out loud.\n\nCaitlyn was married to Kris for 22 years from 1991 to 2015 (back when Caitlyn was former Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner, before Caitlyn came out as trans in 2015). They had two kids together: Kylie, 26, and Kendall, 28, before they divorced.\n\nIn a confessional, Khloé notes that while her ex-stepdad “is completely free to do whatever she wants,” she finds it “strange” that Caitlyn would do a project that Khloé imagines “isn’t trying to paint us in the most beautiful light.”\n\n“I just know she wouldn’t like that about her,” Khloé says.\n\nKim, meanwhile, shares in a confessional that she’s less bothered over Caitlyn’s actions.\n\n“I got so many text messages saying, ‘Doesn’t that hurt your feelings that this is what your stepdad says about you?’ It honestly doesn’t,” the SKIMS founder explains. “I had such a great stepdad who raised me, so none of those things that are said, even if twisted or whatever, are gonna make me think differently of the life I had.”\n\nBack to the conversation about Caitlyn, Scott defends Kris and says, “People have pointed fingers at her over the years as if she was the one that instigated being mean or being unkind or being this or being that or not understanding.”\n\n“People didn’t,” Khloé interjects. “Caitlyn did. Caitlyn always made you look like that.”\n\n“That’s what I’m trying to say,” Scott clarifies. “But even more so now than ever. Even a few years ago when she [Caitlyn] asked for help with the YouTube channel, and she [Kris] still gave a helping hand. She still tried to help. She still went out of her way. And now this?”\n\nKhloé admits that she’s disappointed in Caitlyn because of how close they were when Caitlyn and Kris were still married.\n\n“This was my dad for 24 years. It hurts me too,” she says to Scott and Kris. “I was very close with Bruce. I used to lay in bed with him and watch ‘Unsolved Mysteries’ and all this s–t all the time.”\n\n“He was an unsolved mystery,” Scott jokingly adds.\n\nCaitlyn previously defended her involvement with “House of Kardashian” when the doc came out last October.\n\n“I was happy to participate in the interview process to share my side which points to the strength, influence, and prowess my family has in captivating the world’s attention and keeping it over the years,” she said in a statement at the time.\n\nWhile doing press for the documentary, Caitlyn revealed that she no longer speaks to her ex-wife.\n\n“Kris, I really never talk to anymore,” she said on a UK daytime show. “If there’s any communication, my manager kind of talks to her.”\n\nCaitlyn also said that she’s “sad” about the state of her relationship with Kris.\n\n“House of Kardashian” is streaming now on Peacock.\n\nNew episodes of “The Kardashians” air Thursdays on Hulu and Disney+ at 12 a.m. ET."
