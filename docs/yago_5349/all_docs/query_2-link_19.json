        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner has sworn off love and revealed she isn't \"even close\" to dating.\n\nThe star confessed that they don't see a relationship in their future, and they 'aren't looking for that' currently. Caitlyn's last partner was 'live-in' partner Sophia Hutchins, who claimed that their relationship was more of a business partnership than a romantic relationship. Yet it appears that romance is not on the cards for Caitlyn who claimed she isn't interested in looking for love.\n\nCaitlyn, who formerly identified as Bruce Jenner, spoke ahead of the upcoming documentary House Of Kardashian, which will premiere on Sky Documentaries and streaming service NOW from tonight.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Sad' Caitlyn Jenner admits she no longer speaks to ex-wife Kris Jenner\n\nSpeaking to The Times, Caitlyn said: \"I’m fine, I’m not even close to looking for a relationship. I'll never have a relationship in the future. I just don’t see that in my life. I am not looking for that.\"\n\nShe then explained that she isn't lonely due to her two dogs Bertha and Baxter, and her \"very large family\". The reality star, who has been divorced three times, then added that she could go to a friend's and have dinner \"every night of the week\".\n\nCaitlyn, who divorced ex wife Kris Jenner in 2015 after 23 years of marriage and then later transitioned to transgender, reportedly never told her ex wife of her plans to transition from Bruce to Caitlyn. Instead Kris first heard about it via network bosses as it would be included in filming for the Keeping Up With The Kardashians reality show. A source told Page Six: \"Kris first found out about Bruce transitioning from E! execs, although Bruce eventually spoke to Kris.\"\n\nThe source continued: \"Caitlyn will always have love for Kris, and even after the divorce — which had nothing to do at all with transitioning — really has come to regret not talking with Kris personally first. It hurt [Caitlyn] to learn that Kris found out from network execs.\"\n\nSpeaking to ITV's This Morning earlier this week, Caitlyn also revealed she and ex wife Kris Jenner no longer speak. She told the programme, \"Well Kris, I never really talk to anymore\" as she was asked whether she still keeps in contact with the Kardashian-Jenner clan.\n\nCalling it \"sad\", Caitlyn said the only way she and Kris communicate now is via her manager. Caitlyn told the ITV daytime show: \"If there’s any communication, my manager kind of talks to her and when you have as many kids as I have, you’re closer to some than you are to others … I certainly see them and we do this and that.\"\n\nShe also revealed she was closer with some of her kids than others as there are so many of them. Caitlyn explained: \"When you have as many kids as I have, you’re closer to some than you are to others… I certainly see them and we do this and that. I’m much closer to the Jenner side with Brandon and Brody, Burt and my daughter Casey (from his first marriage before Kris). But Kris, I don’t really have any more contact with her. It's kind of sad because we went through a lot.”"
