        "text": "By Mustafa Gatollari\n\nUpdated Oct. 19 2023, 2:10 p.m. ET\n\nThe Gist:\n\nAfter Caitlyn transitioned in 2015, she and Sophia Hutchins became very close.\n\nWhile many believed Caitlyn and Sophia were dating, Sophia confirmed in a statement to People that the two share a \"parental, familial relationship.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhen you're involved with one of the world's most (in)famous and wealthy families, people are going to closely watch every single move that you make. This is something that Caitlyn Jenner is no stranger to.\n\nSo when the 1976 Olympic decathlon gold medalist began publicly appearing everywhere with young entrepreneur Sophia Hutchins, people began assuming that the two were dating.\n\nSince the two have continuously denied they are romantically involved, people now wonder if Caitlyn has a partner? Here's what we know.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIf Caitlin Jenner does have a partner, then she's pretty good at hiding her relationship.\n\nSophia insists that the relationship she had with Caitlyn was more of a \"parental\" one than anything else and that the two of them have never been romantically linked. In an interview with David Yontef on the Behind the Velvet Rope podcast, Hutchins said, \"Well, we are girlfriends, but we're not like 'girlfriends.' You know what I mean? We're very good friends.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nShe continued, \"To me, Caitlyn is like a parent figure, but also now we have business together. So, you know, we work together so it's interesting. It really is family. That's the best way to describe it. It was never sexual.\"\n\nThe two are currently roommates and business partners and Caitlyn has had nothing but praise for the LUMASOL CEO.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"Sophia has been my best friend, family, and confidant. She is one of the top minds in her field. Her value in my life is undeniable. The sky is the limit with her entrepreneurial spirit,\" Caitlyn said in a statement to The New York Times.\n\nAfter Caitlyn's divorce, her dating history has been tough to nail down.\n\nShe was seen photographed with Kris Jenner's former assistant and friend, Ronda Kamihira, which understandably caused an uproar in the Kardashian family. You could only imagine Kris's reaction.\n\nWhat made matters worse is the fact that Ronda's kids were best friends with Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner while they were growing up.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nPrior to being married to Kris, Caitlyn was married to Chrystie Jenner from 1972 to 1981 while she trained and won the 1976 Olympics decathlon gold, they had two children together: Burt and Cassandra.\n\nTheir marriage was reportedly \"on the skids\" prior to Chrystie getting pregnant with Cassandra, but shortly after their daughter was born Chrystie packed up her things and left the house with her babies in tow.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nShortly after divorcing Chrystie, Caitlyn and Linda Thompson tied the knot, literally days after she and Chrystie were over. This is reportedly around the time when Caitlyn's exploration of her gender began to take a toll on their relationship. She and Linda separated in 1986 after Caitlyn's decision to commit to transitioning. They had two children: Brandon and Brody, who currently both work in entertainment.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nOf course, there are a lot of people who believe that Sophia and Caitlyn's roommate/business partners/adoptive-esque parent/mentor relationship had more initially sexual vibes than either of them are admitting right now. However, that's just a rumor; there's no way to actually confirm that.\n\nWhat we can tell you that as of October 2023, Caitlyn is \"very single,\" the athlete confirmed to The Times. She further explained that she's \"fine\" and not even close to looking for a relationship.\" She added, \"I’ll never have a relationship in the future. I just don’t see that in my life. I am not looking for that.” So there you have it, Caitlyn is not interested in finding love and settling down."
