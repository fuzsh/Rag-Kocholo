        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner and Sophia Hutchins are making secret plans to tie the knot — despite a nearly 50-year age gap!\n\n“They consider each other soul mates and freely admit they couldn’t imagine a life with anyone else at this point,” said an insider.\n\nJenner’s in a rush to wed for the fourth time after the Kardashians gave her the cold shoulder when new mom Khloé was blindsided by her baby daddy’s alleged serial cheating.\n\n“Caitlyn would have loved to have helped Khloé through the tough time in the delivery room, but the Kardashians have kicked her out of the family,” the source told RadarOnline.com.\n\nJenner, 68, and Hutchins, 21, a Pepperdine University student who transitioned into womanhood when she was a teen, sparked romance rumors last year after they were spotted vacationing in Mexico.\n\nInsiders said they plan to say “I do” this summer on a bluff near Jenner’s Malibu pad with a handful of close friends and family members — not named Kardashian!\n\nBoth will wear bridal gowns and carry floral bouquets.\n\n“Cait has a wedding planner to handle all the details,” noted the source.\n\n“This is a dream come true for Cait because her rejection by the Kardashians — and even her own daughters — had left her feeling isolated and suffering from a crippling depression. Sophia has changed all that.”\n\nThe two have been shacking up in Jenner’s Malibu home for months and were photographed together at the reality star’s favorite eatery, Kristy’s Village Cafe, on April 22."
