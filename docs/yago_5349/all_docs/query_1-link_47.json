        "text": "The former couple had already divorced by the time the 73-year-old former Olympian changed her name in September 2015 with the source further claiming, “It hurt [Caitlyn] to learn that Kris found out from network execs”.\n\nWhile it remains unclear how much Kris knew about Caitlyn’s desires and ultimate choice to transition, the businesswoman told Vanity Fair shortly after their divorce, “When I met Bruce, he told me that he had done hormones back in the early 80s.\n\n“This was a conversation that took place in the early 90s. So what he was telling me happened a decade earlier, and he never really explained it.”\n\nCaitlyn soon hit back in her 2017 memoir, The Secrets Of My Life, that Kris did in fact know about her “gender issues” throughout their 22-year marriage, Daily Mail reported.\n\nThe former decathlon athlete wrote, “This will always be a subject of dispute between Kris and me as to how much she could intuit about my gender issues. She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn.\n\n“I told her I dressed as a woman, and she knew I did, because I did it several times in front of her after we were married.”\n\nIt comes after Caitlyn recently revealed she and her ex-wife “never really talk anymore”."
