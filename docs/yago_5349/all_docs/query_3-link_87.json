        "text": "Kris Jenner makes it official: She's divorcing Bruce\n\nTo no one's surprise, reality caught up with reality pioneers Kris Jenner and Bruce Jenner: After nearly a year of separation, the Kardashian clan's mom and stepdad are making their split official.\n\nKris Jenner filed the papers today, reports E! News, TMZ, the Associated Press, and others. Bruce was expected to follow soon.\n\nThe couple separated 11 months ago, after 22 years of marriage, and reported they were much happier living apart, Bruce in Malibu and Kris in their Calabasas, Calif., mansion, familiar from their reality show.\n\nAccording to the court documents obtained by the websites (the E! network is the home for the Kardashian reality series, Keeping up With the Kardashians), Kris cited the standard irreconcilable differences as the reason for the breakup. She requested joint custody of 17-year-old daughter Kylie Jenner, the only minor left in the Kardashian-Jenner brood.\n\nTMZ says the divorce is being handled without lawyers and that the couple are friendly enough to have agreed on an amicable split and division of their assets.\n\n\"It's a done deal,\" TMZ said.\n\nThe two have continued to say they are still close. They even marked their 23rd wedding anniversary together in April, and she posted a loving message on Instagram.\n\n\"Happy Anniversary to one of the most amazing men I know!!!! I love you, Wow 23 years!!!!! #love #weareofficiallyvintage,\" she wrote.\n\nThe Jenners are the parents of two kids together, including Kylie and Kendall, 18. She has four Kardashian kids with her first husband, the late O.J, Simpson lawyer, Robert Kardashian. And ex-Olympic athlete Bruce has four children from his first two marriages.\n\nWhen Kim Kardashian married Kanye West in Italy in May, Bruce walked her down the aisle."
