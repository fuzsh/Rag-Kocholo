        "text": "Attraction & Intensity\n\nAttraction Index evaluates a scope of qualities you find attractive in each other. From physical attractiveness and behavior to a spectrum of psychological traits and features, your score represents the chemistry or spark that motivated you to be with another person, and them with you. As a rule of thumb, the attraction is necessary but not sufficient for defining true love.\n\nIntensity Index outlines the challenges. Detailed investigation of connections determines which areas of your life are affected the most. It can be sexual intensity, strong desire to dominate, criticism, or deep contradictions in beliefs and lifestyles. While intense passion may work to your benefit, there are some levels of intensity people find difficult to accept. Jealousy, for example, can ruin relationships. Desire to manipulate can tear your safety net. You can be intensely in love for many years, but it shouldn't limit your independence.\n\nPeople with more than fifteen links between them have their scores higher than someone with five connections or less. As a rule, relationships with high-attraction and low-Intensity scores have more chances to survive in the long run and to bring more positive energy and mutual understanding. The excess of intense connections between people leads to break-ups and conflicts. Keep in mind that the level of intensity depends on your personal preferences and traits. Passionate people prefer more intense relationships; they are quickly bored with perfections. Others are looking for a harmonious and caring environment. If you research your previous relationships in-depth, you will discover the Attraction and Intensity Scores that fit you the best.\n\nCompatibility Chart\n\nMeeting someone is never an accident, no matter how long your relationship lasts. There are always lessons, challenges, and virtues. It's easy to see in your compatibility chart, what brought you together in this lifetime and how enjoyable or challenging your relationships are meant to be. If you are aiming for long-term relationships, look for family and benefits indexes. Special connections give you a sense of pre-destined call. Lessons and challenges highlight the problematic aspects that may work for your advantage in the long-run. Intensity adds an edge, while criticism in high doses can make or break your trust."
