        "text": "1990\n\nThe couple attended the 52nd annual Pioneer of the Year awards in December 1990. They married the following year after five months of dating.\n\n1991\n\nThe whole clan posed for a family portrait in 1991. Top row, from left: Brandon Jenner and Burton Jenner. Middle row, from left: Brody Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Bruce Jenner, Kris Jenner, Cassandra Jenner and Kim Kardashian. Bottom row, from left: Robert Kardashian Jr. and Khloe Kardashian.\n\n1995\n\nThe couple posed for photographers at the 1995 Jim Thorpe Pro Sports Awards at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles. At the time, Kris was pregnant with Kendall, their oldest daughter together. The couple welcomed a second daughter, Kylie, two years later. Kris has four children — Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian Jr. — from her previous marriage to Robert Kardashian, while Bruce also has four other children — including The Hills alum Brody Jenner — from previous marriages.\n\n2000\n\nThe former U.S. gold medal decathlete and the future talk show host took their daughters Kylie, left, and Kendall to the premiere of The Emperor's New Groove at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood in December 2000.\n\n2008\n\nFrom left: Khloe, Kourtney, Kim, Kris and Bruce attended the season-two launch of Keeping Up With the Kardashians at Les Deux in Hollywood in March 2008. The hit show has spawned several spinoffs on E!.\n\n2011\n\nBruce and Kris — again in matching black outfits — attended the City of Hope event honoring Shelli and Irving Azoff with the 2011 Spirit of Life award at Universal Studios Hollywood in May 2011.\n\n2012\n\nKris and Bruce attended a game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Los Angeles Lakers at Staples Center in January 2012 — a month after Khloe's husband, NBA star Lamar Odom, was traded from the Lakers to the Mavs."
