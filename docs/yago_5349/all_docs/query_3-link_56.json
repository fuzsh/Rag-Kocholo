        "text": "kris-jenner-bruce-jenner-split.JPG\n\nBruce and Kris Jenner have announced they're separating after 22 years of marriage.\n\n(David Livingston/Getty Images)\n\nThe bad news is that Bruce and Kris Jenner have separated after 22 years of marriage (six televised). The good news: Perhaps there will be one less Kardashian to keep up with.\n\n\"We are living separately and we are much happier this way,\" they tell E! News, their official mouthpiece as their reality show and myriad spinoffs air on the cable network. \"But we will always have much love and respect for each other. Even though we are separated, we will always remain best friends and, as always, our family will remain our number one priority.\"\n\nDivorce rumors have dogged the couple for a couple of years, but Kris Jenner told E! last year, \"We love each other and just laugh about it ...These kind of stories have been circulating for the last couple of years.\"\n\nKris Jenner, whose eponymous talk show was recently canned, is \"momager\" to tabloid fixtures Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Rob (from her marriage to O.J. Simpson defense lawyer Robert Kardashian) as well as her two daughters, Kylie and Kendall, with Bruce Jenner, the former Olympian and television personality. Jenner has four children from two previous marriages, two of which also starred on reality shows.\n\nFOLLOW STAR-LEDGER ENTERTAINMENT: TWITTER â€¢ FACEBOOK"
