        "text": "It's nearly impossible to watch any one of the Kardashians' reality shows without feeling sorry for Bruce Jenner.\n\nThe 63-year-old former Olympian is constantly brushed off and made to feel like he doesn't matter in his own house, and now there are reports that he's preparing to divorce his wife Kris, after 21 years of marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Enquirer (via RadarOnline) claims that Bruce has been secretly consulting with a divorce lawyer and says he's at the breaking point over Kris' flirtations with younger men, and her \"raging egomania\" over the Kardashian empire.\n\n“Bruce feels that Kris treats him like a doormat, and he’s had enough. She constantly belittles his appearance and complains to mutual friends that he’s a boring old fart. Then she has the gall to flaunt her relationships with younger guys in his face,\" a source revealed to the tabloid.\n\nIt's true the couple's marital woes played out on the last season of \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians,\" when Kris admitted to seeing Todd Waterman, the man she cheated on first husband Robert Kardashian with. On camera, Bruce was livid about his wife meeting up with her ex, but this past summer Kris denied rumors her marriage was in trouble because of the incident.\n\n\"[Bruce] has got an extremely crazy amount of patience but he's also so secure in himself -- he's completely secure in his relationship with me.\" Jenner told the hosts of \"The Talk.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it's not just outside temptation that has Bruce at his wits end. Sources told the National Enquirer, that he feels emasculated by Kris because of the perception that Kris is the breadwinner in the family and is \"sick and tired of the humiliation.\"\n\nInsiders say that a divorce could have the couple fighting over their estimated $155 million fortune, and that Bruce already had a friend who works as sports entertainment lawyer value the assets of the Kardashian-Jenner empire, in case he moves forward with a split.\n\nThough Kris has denied there are serious problems in the relationship, she's hinted that this might not be her last marriage. In an episode that aired this past July, Kris spies Bruce golfing with -- and wrapping his arm around -- model Angie Everhart, and becomes extremely jealous. She remarked: \"Sometimes I think there is another chapter for me.\"\n\nThe couple married in April 1991, just a month after Kris finalized her divorce with Kardashian, and Bruce is no stranger to failed marriages himself. The one-time star athlete was married to Chrystie Crownover from 1972 until 1980, and then was married to Linda Thompson from 1981 until 1985.\n\nRequests for comment made to Kris and Bruce Jenner's rep have not yet been returned.\n\nUPDATE: Kris Jenner has denied reports that she and Bruce are divorcing.\n\n\"Life is so good right now. They’re crazy. We’ve been dealing with this weekly for the last couple of years. You just have to take it in stride. I called him this morning and said, 'Honey, I think we’re getting a divorce. This is crazy! This is the new rumor.' We were laughing. He goes, 'I’m at the hobby shop, can you leave me alone with this crap?' It was very funny,\" she told \"Entertainment Tonight.\""
