        "text": "Fans of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” will get to share in some intimate family moments regarding Bruce Jenner’s transgender revelation.\n\nE! will air a two-part special, “Keeping Up With the Kardashians: About Bruce,” which, according to the network, “will reveal intimate conversations that Bruce had with his famous family, in which they discussed his transition.”\n\n“The specials will also explore each family member’s struggle to process his or her own feelings as they all work through hearing from Bruce directly about finally living life as the person he has always known himself to be,” a news release about the special states.\n\nJenner spoke first time publicly to Diane Sawyer in an interview that aired on April 24 about being transgender and transitioning to being a woman. The former Olympian said he has “the soul of a female” and is for all “intents and purposes” a woman.\n\n(CNN is using the pronoun “he” until Jenner expressly states he wants to be called “she.”)\n\nBruce Jenner interview: ‘Yes, for all intents and purposes, I’m a woman’\n\nThe E! special will air in two parts at 9 p.m. on May 17 and May 18. The network also has an as yet not titled eight-part, one-hour series featuring Bruce Jenner set to premiere on July 26.\n\nOn Monday, E! released a clip from the special of Jenner’s ex-wife and Kardashian matriarch Kris being comforted by her daughter Kim after the news. “I have these memories of this life and I feel sometimes like it didn’t exist,” Kris Jenner tearfully says."
