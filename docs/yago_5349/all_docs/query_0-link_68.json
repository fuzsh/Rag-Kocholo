I just don't see that in my life. I am not looking for that.\n\n\"Every night of the week, I could go to somebody's house and have dinner.\"\n\nHaving been divorced three times, Jenner may be right to avoid rushing into anything with anyone and she also claims that, with her dogs and large family, there is always someone to spend time with should she wish.\n\n\"Every night of the week, I could go to somebody's house and have dinner,\" she said.\n\nContact with Kris Jenner\n\nCaitlyn was married to Kris Jenner up until their divorce in 2015, which is when Caitlyn came out as transgender.\n\n\"Well, Kris and I really never talk to anymore,\" she explained on the UK talk show 'This Morning'.\n\n\"If there's any communication, my manager kind of talks to her.\n\n\"When you have as many kids as I have, you're closer to some than you are to others. I certainly see them and we do this and that.\""
