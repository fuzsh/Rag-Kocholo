        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner isn’t searching for love right now — or ever.\n\nThe former Olympian recently got candid about romance and dating, revealing that she’s currently “very single” and not looking to mingle.\n\n“I’m fine. I’m not even close to looking for a relationship,” she told the Times in an interview published Wednesday.\n\n“I’ll never have a relationship in the future. I just don’t see that in my life. I am not looking for that.”\n\nHowever, the reality TV alum — who has been divorced three times — insisted that she’s not lonely at all thanks to her two dogs, Bertha and Baxter, and her “very large family.”\n\n“Every night of the week I could go to somebody’s house and have dinner,” she said.\n\nInstead of focusing on a romantic relationship, Jenner — who describes herself as “a relatively simple person” — finds fulfillment in her hobbies, including flying airplanes and playing golf.\n\n“I raced cars for 20-odd years,” she added. “Racing cars is not the greatest way to make money or a career or business. You do it because it’s fun.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe 73-year-old has also remained dedicated to fitness and staying in shape.\n\n“I just enjoy good health,” she explained. “I don’t go crazy working out, but I get my exercise in all the time.”\n\nCaitlyn’s confession about her love life coincided with another revelation about her non-existent relationship with ex-wife Kris Jenner. The two divorced in 2015, the same year the gold medalist came out as transgender.\n\n“Well, Kris, I really never talk to anymore,” she admitted Wednesday on UK talk show “This Morning.”\n\n“If there’s any communication, my manager kind of talks to her and when you have as many kids as I have, you’re closer to some than you are to others … I certainly see them and we do this and that.”\n\n“I’m much closer to the Jenner side, but Kris, I don’t really have any more contact with her,” Caitlyn added. “It’s kind of sad because we went through a lot.”\n\nHer candid remarks have since reportedly caused “tension” within the Kardashian family.\n\nSources told TMZ Thursday that Caitlyn was feeling “extremely remorseful” for her public comments about the famous momager, 67, after their daughters, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner, took their mom’s side.\n\nShe and Kris were married for 22 years prior to the high-profile split.\n\nDuring that time, Caitlyn was also stepfather to Kris’ four children with Robert Kardashian Sr.: Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian and Rob Kardashian.\n\nThe father of six was also previously married to Chrystie Scott from 1972 to 1981 and Linda Thompson from 1981 to 1986."
