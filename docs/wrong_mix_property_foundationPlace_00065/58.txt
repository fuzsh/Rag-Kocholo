The company says the system has been designed from the ground up entirely in software and as a standards-based offering provides an advanced telephony system for feature-rich voice communications that replaces complex, proprietary telephony hardware. It provides growing and distributed businesses with enterprise class business communications solutions that integrate with Microsoft Office and FrontRange line-of-business applications.

“IP Office Suite is designed to enable our customers to deliver a complete customer contact strategy,” said Kevin J. Smith, vice president of Products for FrontRange Solutions. “This suite of telephony and software integration components are designed to be a foundation that is an all-in-one, complete business phone system, with built-in unified messaging that improves employee effectiveness when interacting with customers and improves the customer experience when interacting with your business.

“What is more,” he added, “this IP Office Suite provides additional value by also serving as an enabling platform for higher functionality. Integration for Microsoft Live Communications Server is included and adding FrontRange GoldMine IP Voice Suite productivity applications and FrontRange IP Contact Center Solutions is easily done.”

“This IP Telephony solution offers us more offering power with its complete, standards-based VoIP business phone system,” said Steven Jacobowitz, president and CEO of Saga Solutions, a FrontRange Reseller Partner.

“As it also leverages the investments in business management solutions from FrontRange and Microsoft, IP Office Suite gives every one of our customers the opportunity to increase the return on their investment, while providing tremendous productivity gains for their power users who have the greatest contact with customers.”
