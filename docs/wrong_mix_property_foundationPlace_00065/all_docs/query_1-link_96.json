        "text": "Front Range Property Management Services\n\n“Dorman Management and Ben Yoder have been wonderful to work with as a Commerical property owner. My only regret is not hiring them sooner than I did. We've been working with them for just over a year now and I can say without a doubt - worth EVERY penny! He is quick to be very pro-active to any situation we've ever had and has helped immensely get our leases, payments, etc in order. HIGHLY recommend Ben & Dorman Mgt.”\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n“Alex Yoder from Dorman Property Management has been managing my home for 5 years. He is phenomenal and he is the best property manager. I am grateful to have Alex Yoder as my property manager and will definitely recommend him to anyone who wants to rent their home. I guarantee that it will be stress-free because Alex will take care of your home.”\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n“Dorman has been managing my property in fountain for over 2 years now. I certainly have the ultimate peace of mind given I live 2 time zones away and my tenants are always taken care off. Dorman charges 10% of your rent and other protection packages that you can add on. Contact them for the most updated info in pricing. Communication has been great. They usually have a manager that they will assign to your account and all communicate goes through that person. They also provide lawn service outsourced to a 3rd party which is something you can opt in for. Most importantly Dorman’s screening process for picking tenants is always pro-owner which makes them stand out as compared to others in the area. I recommend Dorman!”\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"We worked with Drew here at Dorman for 2 years and it couldn't have gone better. The entire experience was so seamless that if it weren't for the hot-sellers market, we'd be sticking with Dorman for years to come. From getting everything started to dealing with unexpected repairs and other scenarios. Drew did a great job at looping us in when it was truly needed, presenting all the info so we were quickly up to speed on whatever the case was. For the full two years we were able to live stress-free in another state, knowing that we have a solid property manager on it should anything come up. We'd 1000% recommend Drew and Dorman anytime!!\"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"As a tenant, I have been incredibly pleased with Dorman property management. They have responded expeditiously to any problem I've had, including a flooded basement that occurred due to a blockage. Not only did they have someone out to the property the same day, on a Sunday, they very quickly booked a contractor to remove carpeting and drywall that had been compromised during the incident. This was particularly important to me, as previously I leased with a property management company that dismissed my suggestions that black mold had been growing in the walls. Because of that agency's disregard, my son had suffered pneumonia due to mold growth. Dorman immediately responded to my concerns, and I could not have been happier with their diligent execution of rectifying the situation. I would highly recommend Dorman to anyone looking to lease a property in Front Range.\"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"Wanted to say it was an absolute pleasure renting from Dorman Realty, specifically Keri and Betsy. Work requests have always been handled promptly and professionally. When it came time to move out, Keri and Betsy returned my fee for breaking my lease vs keeping the funds as I was within 30 days of my contract expiration date. I wouldn’t have known otherwise. It goes to show that Dorman is a fantastic place to do business with and their tenants are their #1 priority. Thank you. \"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"I've used Dorman Property Managment for years and I've been nothing but impressed. They set up my home for pictures, screen tenants and handle the day to day issues that arise. On top of that Drew Bartlett in particular has been AMAZING with helping me when it comes to getting tax documents & invoices as well as answering all the questions I have as an inexperienced owner. I have nothing but good things to say about this company. I definitely recommend them to anyone thinking of renting out their home!\"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"A long review, but worth the time! My husband, brother and I had planned to move up to Front Range in the middle of winter even after many people had told us to wait until spring. There were many obstacles on our journey to Front Range, but the one constant and positive experience we encountered was with this INCREDIBLE TEAM at Dorman Management! Betsy in particular I can tell has such a love for her job and went above and beyond to make our experience an absolutely delight. My credit isn’t they greatest due to identity theft several years ago and most property management companies would see that number and deny instantly. Betsy got to know us as people, not just a number. She let me state my case, provide my evidence, and found my family and I a home. I am forever grateful to Betsy and the entire team! Lydia at the main office is so fun to talk to and explained everything with ease and enthusiasm!! We are hoping to purchase a property soon to rent out as extra income and I know exactly what property management team I will be going through when that time comes. Thank you!!!\"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"Dorman managed my property for almost 10 years and I am very happy with their service. Alex has been very responsive and helpful as I try and get the property ready to sell. For having had tenants in the house for that long, the property looks great. I have lived out of state for all of those 10 years and for the most part any issues have been dealt with very smoothly. It says a lot to do business with someone for a decade and I am glad we chose Dorman all those years ago.\"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"I am very pleased with the services Dorman Property Management provides. Having them manage our house property has been headache free. Every arising problem has been has been handled with expertise and quality work to my satisfaction as well as the tenants. For carefree management of your properties I would highly recommend Dorman. They really know what they are doing and do it with integrity. Dorman Property Management is the name in property management you can Trust! Excellent Company....\"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"We have been with Dorman as tenants for going on 5 years now and we couldn’t be happier. It is very much a scenario of working with real people who care and who can and do communicate with you as a tenant. If I had a property in the future and needed a company to manage it I would use Dorman in a heartbeat. If I ever have a question, Keri has always been wonderful to respond to my requests along with the rest of the office staff.\"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"We recently moved in to one of Dorman's rental properties and the experience has been great so far. Even with all of the obstacles of COVID-19 thrown our way, Dorman has followed through with everything on their part. We had to submit a few maintenance requests within our 1st month and both requests were handled promptly and issues were resolved. The staff is extremely helpful and very responsive whether that's through e-mail, text or phone call. I like that we deal with our property manager and not directly with the landlord as well. Highly recommended.\"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"Dorman management is a great rental property organization to work with. We were having trouble finding a place for our son and his friends for college. Their process for applying with multiple tenants was quick and easy. Just want to thank the staff especially Samantha Kari and Betsy- for all your help and patience and answering all of our questions and concerns. Plus a Big shout out to the maintenance man he was awesome. Sorry I can’t remember his name.\"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"Raegan Lopez was my property manager and I can say she was the best! If I could use her for a future property I would definitely. She is very responsive, professional and attentive. I had no worries while she was over our house for the last 3 years. Our house was returned to us in immaculate condition ready to be put on the market. 😀 I highly recommend Raegan Lopez she is an exceptional asset to this company! My husband and I thank you again Raegan!\"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"We couldn't be more pleased with Dorman Real Estate Management! They really helped my wife and I get into the exact home we wanted, and we were on a significant time crunch. Trying to rent a home in such a seller's market is no easy task. Keri was hands down one of the best people with which I have ever had the pleasure of working. She is a hard working, caring individual who will bend over backwards to make sure you are properly taken care of. We arrived on Memorial Day weekend when no one is around to help...except Dorman. They have an automated process so you may still see homes even though there is no one to physically show them to you. Also, our new Property Manager Alex allowed us to complete all our paperwork prior to our departure just to give us piece of mind. Believe it when I say Dorman is the real deal...look nowhere else! Thank you!!!\"\n\nFront Range Property Management Services\n\n\"I have been renting a house from Dorman for 8 years and right from the beginning have had an A+ experience. When we rented the house, Alex met us and toured us around showing all the ins and outs, giving us keys, explaining the lease...and then leaving us to live in peace all these years, knowing he was just a phone call away 24/7 if anything broke or we needed something. Alex and I have developed a friendship in the larger community...this is a community involved and present company that reaffirms your decision to use their services. I simply don't know what they could do better! Always friendly, responsive, and problem solving...although I must say they stay ahead of the game and we have not had any problems. So, A+\""
