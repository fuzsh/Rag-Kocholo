        "text": "Professional Nursing contributes to care of patients at Penrose Hospital and the surrounding community through the following services:\n\nBariatric Center of Excellence:\n\nPenrose Hospital is currently the only Certified Center of Excellence in the southern Colorado region. Our Bariatric Program Coordinator (RN) provides pre- and post-surgical education to the patients as well as conducts an ongoing monthly support group. While giving post-operative care, our highly trained bariatric nurses continue to reinforce this education and provide support to the patients and their families through this life-changing surgical experience. Nurses and other members of the multidisciplinary team throughout the hospital champion the use of enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery.\n\nCancer center:\n\nPenrose St. Francis cancer program has received designation as Centers of Excellence from the Commission on Cancer (CoC), National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC), National Quality Measures for Breast Centers (NQMBC), National Accreditation Program for Rectal Cancer (NAPRC), American College of Radiology (ACR), Lung Cancer Screening Center of Excellence (LCOE) and is a member of the MD Anderson Physician Network. These Cancer Centers of Excellence demonstrate that our oncology nurses are nationally certified, providing the highest level of expertise in delivering chemotherapy, radiation, medical, surgical, and end-of-life care. Nurse navigators support the patient throughout their cancer journey from diagnosis to survivorship through education, care coordination, support, and facilitation of hospital and community resources. Radiation oncology nurses provide targeted treatments and assist patients in reducing side effects from those treatments. Clinical research nurses provide care and support to patients enrolled in clinical research trials. Palliative care nurses support end-of-life decision-making and pain management throughout the cancer journey. Nurses facilitate multiple community support groups, integrative therapies, cancer screening, and community events to help patients through their cancer experience.\n\nCardiac care:\n\nOur cardiology nurses are dedicated to the care and health promotion of the community. When patients come in with a heart attack or any heart or vascular abnormalities, we offer a quality continuum of care from our emergency room nurses, that provide prompt interventions to our certified nurses on the cardiology floor. Our goal is for heart attack patients to receive care for an average of 60 minutes or less, a full 33% faster than the American College of Cardiology national benchmark of 90 minutes. Patients receive quality skilled care from our vascular center nurses, where we have a vast cath lab and electrophysiology lab services. Our dedicated cardiac unit has cardiac and telemetry trained nurses to support, monitor, and manage any cardiac and vascular symptoms. Our cardiac rehab nurses help with education and help prepare patients physically, mentally, and emotionally for return to work and normal family and social life. We have a strong structural heart program where our structural heart NP helps patients navigate and coordinate all testing and procedures needed for TAVR, mitral clip and watchman procedures from admit to discharge care follow-up.\n\nIntensive care:\n\nICU nurses specialize in caring for a broad spectrum of patients that require extensive monitoring and an advanced level of care. Our patient population includes medical, surgical, trauma, stroke, and post-operative cardiothoracic patients. Our nurses provide care to trauma patients aged 15 years and older and medical/surgical patients aged 18 years and older. The diverse patient population challenges nurses to continually develop an extensive skill set. ICU nurses encounter a variety of patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), valve repairs, aortic aneurysm repair, as well as those that require intra-aortic balloon pumps (IAPB), Impella (left ventricular assist device), and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD/CRRT) support. Stroke care offers both systemic and intracerebral tPA as well as any needed euro interventional radiology (NIR) procedures. We believe in a multidisciplinary approach to providing excellent patient care. Our interdepartmental relationships allow our staff to treat patients and families holistically. The team works together towards a common goal of excellent patient experience and a welcoming work environment. The ICU leadership and staff promote shared governance through the dynamic unit and hospital committee involvement. Nurses are encouraged to further their education and career through certification and continuing education.\n\nEmergency and trauma care:\n\nDelivering a continuum of care through all stages of life, our emergency and trauma nursing team uses evidence-based delivery protocols to provide superior outcomes for sepsis, geriatric, stroke, cardiac, medical, pediatric and trauma patients. Evidence-based triage guidelines help our nurses reduce wait times and provide prompt emergency care for high-acuity patients. Our nursing team has assisted in the achievement of Level II trauma designation from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and Level I trauma verification from the American College of Surgeons. In addition, our hospital holds a DNV Comprehensive Stroke Center certification.\n\nMedical/surgical care:\n\nNurses care with compassion for patients needing general medical and/or surgical services. Acute care nurses have protocols to reduce hospital-acquired infections to influence hospital length of stay and increase patient comfort. Advanced training for our patient population has been completed in order to provide proper care for our various medical diagnoses.\n\nNeurology care:\n\nNurses provide care to patients through the diagnosis, treatment, and surgical intervention process. There are nurse stroke coordinators who lead the Penrose St. Francis Hospital Stroke Certification process, ensuring top-level care for stroke patients.\n\nOutpatient care:\n\nGastro-Intestinal Lab: GI lab nurses prepare and care for patients needing procedures like endoscopies or colonoscopies. Infusion services: Penrose St. Francis provides high-quality short- and long-term infusion services for a variety of illnesses with a focus on comfort, compassion, and convenience. Our infusion centers are staffed with registered nurses certified in chemo/biotherapy administration, pharmacists, pharmacy techs, phlebotomists, and schedulers who all specialize in outpatient Infusion and chemotherapy services. Therapy is provided in a stress-free and comfortable environment. Ostomy clinic: At the Penrose Ostomy Clinic, our specialty nurses, certified in ostomy and wound care, excel in providing care for patients living with stomas and for those patients considering ostomy surgery. Our team provides care to all patients that have had their ostomy surgery at Penrose St. Francis hospitals, and we also see patients that are living with stomas that need additional assistance and/or are interested in updates to their ostomy management systems.\n\nPerioperative care:\n\nNurses work collaboratively with surgeons, anesthesiologists, techs, reps, and other support staff to care for the patient undergoing surgery. Whether preparing patients for surgery, working with them intraoperatively in the operating room, or focusing on their post-operative treatment, nurses remain a vital pillar to patient-centered care. Nurses' primary job functions and interventions in perioperative care include patient education, safety awareness for both patients and staff, infection prevention, and interprofessional communication. Our nurses ensure that they are at the top of their field by achieving certifications including ASPAN, CAPA, CPAN, and CNOR.\n\nPeripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) team:\n\nThe PSF PICC/VA nurses provide ultrasound-guided vascular access via PICC, midline, and difficult PIV placement. They lead CLABSI prevention efforts by providing evidence-based specialty care, as well as patient and staff education at both Penrose and St. Francis campuses.\n\nSpinal care:\n\nNurses provide compassionate care to those undergoing spine surgery or treatment for spinal trauma. Alongside a multidisciplinary team, nursing prioritizes early and frequent mobilization, increased pain control, and the education needed to continue healing after discharge.\n\nAdult Volunteer Program\n\nAfter completing the online application, the prospective volunteer will learn about the Penrose Hospital mission, core values, customer service program, volunteer opportunities offered at each site, and the training requirements needed before their volunteer service can begin.\n\nProspective volunteers will have the opportunity to review all position descriptions that appeal to them. On-the-job training will be provided when the volunteer receives his/her volunteer assignment.\n\nTeen Volunteer Program\n\nWe are currently not taking applications at this time, please check back for updates.\n\nNo One Dies Alone Program\n\nNo One Dies Alone (NODA) is a national volunteer-centered program started by Sandra Clarke, CCRN, at PeaceHealth (Eugene, OR) in 2001. Its goal is to provide companionship and support for dying individuals so that no patient dies alone. The program is now a model for compassionate end-of-life programs in hospitals across the country. The program began at Penrose Hospital oi July 2000 and strives to provide compassionate companionship to the dying who have no family or friends to be with them in their last days to ensure that they do not die alone.\n\nNo One Dies Alone trains hospital associates and volunteers to become compassionate companions who offer end-of-life presence and support to patients who are near the end of life and who have no family or friends at their bedside. Trained volunteers provide 24-hour availability to dying patients who do not wish to be alone. During the vigil, companions may hold the hand of the patient, play soothing music, read to the patient and assist in other comfort care measures. They serve patients in shifts, sitting at the bedside until the patient death or a family member arrives.\n\nThe heart of this work is about being rather than doing, about the compassionate presence and heartfelt intention rather than fixing, solving, answering or resolving issues for others. To be a calming presence and truly compassionate with another requires no small amount of personal and spiritual maturity, as well as a capacity for reflection on the volunteerâs life.\n\nNo One Dies Alone volunteers receive orientation and training that is more process-oriented with an appropriate amount of content and protocol to provide a framework for the volunteer to be successful. All No One Dies Alone volunteers must be either a Penrose Hospital associate or a volunteer through Penrose Hospital Volunteer Services and have been volunteering for at least three months. No One Dies Alone gives Penrose Hospital associates the opportunity to provide comfort care to patients outside of their regular work day. Penrose Hospital associates must register with Volunteer Services, complete a No One Dies Alone application, be interviewed, and be accepted as a No One Dies Alone volunteer, and complete the No One Dies Alone training prior to beginning to sit vigils.\n\nCompetencies\n\nWorks cooperatively with others as well as independently\n\nFollows the organization's confidentiality and infection control guidelines\n\nRespects a patientâs spiritual beliefs\n\nUnderstands and follows directions\n\nDemonstrates compassion\n\nDemonstrates an ability to be a calming presence and use silence well\n\nDemonstrates emotional availability\n\nDemonstrates appropriate personal and professional boundaries\n\nDemonstrates sensitivity to end-of-life issues"
