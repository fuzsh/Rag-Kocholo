        "text": "CCD's advising model is designed to better serve our students with a one-student, one-advisor framework. Please view the Academic Advising Syllabus for details. Ideally, you will meet with one academic advisor throughout your academic career at CCD. We utilize an appointment system and encourage students to plan on several days' advance notice.\n\nDuring the months of January and August, availability for individual meetings is very limited since we move to a walk-in, quick assistance model for last-minute help before the fall and spring semesters begin. If you wish to have an individualized one-on-one appointment, please schedule this for any other month of the year.\n\nAdvisors can meet with students who are enrolled at CCD or who have completed their application to CCD and have a student ID number. Prospective students should contact our Admissions department instead of Academic Advising.\n\nYes, for a 1:1 private meeting that lasts 30-45 minutes. Drop-in advising is offered for quick questions and may be done in a group setting, with the first available advisor during special walk-in hours, which are limited. Appointment scheduling is very limited during last-minute registration prior to the start of each semester. For the best appointment availability, please schedule at least a month before classes start. Most advisors are scheduled about a week or two in advance and are available for in-person, virtual, and phone appointments.\n\nOnce you have completed your SOAR (Student Orientation and Resources) and declared a certificate or degree, you will be assigned to an advisor in your pathway.\n\nYou can also view a list of advisors in all pathways.\n\nIf you are undeclared and need help deciding on a career path and what to declare, the Educational Opportunity Center can help guide you. You can also ask our Chatbot, \"Help me pick a major,\" and you will be guided through some questions and shown programs that match your needs and interests. When you feel ready, schedule an appointment with our Undecided Student Advisor."
