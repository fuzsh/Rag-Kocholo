Our medical assistant apprenticeship program with Centura Health made it happen. For four days a week, Toni is paid to work at St. Anthony North Hospitalâ€”and on a fifth, she takes a full day of class at FRCC. \"For me, this is 20 years in the making,\" she says. \"I finally found a way to make working in medicine a part of my life.\""
