This grant encompasses funding and material opportunities from OIM’s Mobility Services and Electrification & Energy and Programs.\n\nThe CY2024 Round 1 of the OIM Grant opportunities is closed. Do not worry if you miss this round. We expect to open CY2024 Round 2 in the Summer of 2024. Subscribe to OIM Grant Updates for the next round of grant announcements."
