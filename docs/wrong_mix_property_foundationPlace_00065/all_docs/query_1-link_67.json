        "text": "Your vehicles keep your life movingâ€¦until something breaks. When that happens, you want the peace of mind that comes from expert and technically supported diagnosis. You also want the necessary repairs performed by fully trained and certified techs using OEM parts. Lastly, you have a right to enjoy the peace of mind and the assurances that only come through personal service and genuine, face-to-face care for you as a valued customer.\n\nEveryone has a choice when it comes to car maintenance and repair. Dealer shops can be a quality option, but usually an impersonal and expensive one. Front Range Auto Center provides you with dealer quality parts and repairs delivered with personal, trustworthy service at a fair price."
