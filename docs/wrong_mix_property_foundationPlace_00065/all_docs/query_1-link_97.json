Through this partnership, CU employees enrolled in CU’s Anthem-administered Exclusive, Extended, and High-Deductible medical plan can access premier fertility care provided by Shady Grove Fertility Colorado — the exclusive in-network fertility center for CU employees. If you’ve been struggling to conceive, we encourage you to contact WINFertility at 866-430-6068 to learn more about your exclusive fertility benefits.\n\nSGF Colorado’s accepted fertility networks\n\nSGF also partners with several fertility networks or third-party administrators as well as companies/employers who offer additional fertility benefits, negotiate preferred service rates, and process claims on behalf of their employees as an employee benefit.\n\nTo determine your eligibility, please review our network participation list below. Some infertility networks may require patients to enroll directly with their organization before seeking treatment as a condition of eligibility. For more information on SGF’s third-party administrators, please contact your SGF Financial Counselor or ask your HR Department for the best way to contact them."
