        "text": "At Front Range Spine & Neurosurgery, we accept workersâ€™ compensation, Medicare, and most major insurance plans. Please contact your insurance company or call our office at (303) 790-1800 to find out if we accept your plan.\n\nIf your insurance plan requires you to pay a co-payment, co-insurance, and/or a deductible, you will need to pay at the time of your visit. For your convenience we accept cash, checks, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express. If you have a question related to your bill or insurance, please contact our billing specialists at (303) 790-1800.\n\nIf one of our doctors suggests a specialist evaluation or diagnostic testing that requires a referral, we will make every effort to provide this for you as soon as possible. Some referrals require insurance preauthorization and cannot be processed immediately. Insurance guidelines prohibit us from backdating referrals. We require three business days for the processing of routine referrals.\n\nIf your insurance is an HMO/managed care plan and you are required to obtain a referral from your primary care physician, the referral must be obtained before you can be seen for an office visit. Please coordinate this with your primary care physician in advance. Appointments will be rescheduled if required referrals are not received in the office by the time of your visit.\n\nFront Range Spine & Neurosurgery will accept an initial referral by fax, phone, or email from your provider, and we will obtain the needed signed prescription within days of your referral, or you may bring the signed referral form with you to our office.\n\nPrescriptions and refills for established patients of Front Range Spine & Neurosurgery are routinely issued during our regular office hours (see above). You can make your request by calling our office at (303) 790-1800.\n\nNo refills are issued during the evenings, weekends, or holidays, as the doctor does not have access to your medical records during those times. It is helpful to anticipate your refill needs to avoid an interruption in your medication therapy."
