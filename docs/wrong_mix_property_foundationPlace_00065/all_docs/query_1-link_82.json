        "text": "Amnet is a Colorado Front Range-based managed service provider for IT that understands the real value of diligent attention to each and every one of our clients.\n\nAs your partner in making your IT a competitive advantage, we take the time to understand your organization and to listen to your concerns. Our goal is to establish a long-term, win-win relationship.\n\nThe Amnet journey began in 1998 when Trevor Dierdorff left a tech job at a large corporate retailer to strike out on his own.\n\nIt wasn’t long until he had a few small business clients, and his fledgling managed service provider company began to grow. The year 2000 was when things began to take off. That year Trevor hired his first employee and within six months, a second.\n\n“Initially, I didn’t intend to have employees, but the need in the market was too great to keep up with the demands. It was an exciting time, launching and growing Amnet.” – Dierdorff\n\nWith the excitement of launching the managed service provider business came work…lots of work.\n\n“Eighty-hour weeks were not unusual, at first. Bootstrapping a business is difficult. I have so much respect for my fellow entrepreneurs who know the joy, pain, risk, and reward of going out on their own.” – Dierdorff\n\nThat respect for entrepreneurs and business leaders that Trevor developed during those early days has become a source of insight and guiding light for the customer service approach of Amnet.\n\nDo you have Errors and Omissions (E&O) insurance?\n\nErrors and Omissions (E&O) insurance is a kind of specialized liability protection against losses not covered by traditional liability insurance. It protects you and your business from claims if a client sues for negligent acts, errors, or omissions committed during business activities that result in a financial loss.\n\nAmnet has a comprehensive $1,000,000 E&O insurance policy and a $1,000,000 umbrella prolicy. This insurance protects you should we cause a problem with your network that causes you to be down for hours or days, or if you lose data."
