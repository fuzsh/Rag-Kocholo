Following her time in the midwest, she returned to the east coast to enter her residency program in Primary Care and Low Vision with an emphasis on traumatic brain injury. After practicing in Florida for a few years, the mountains were calling her to put down roots in Colorado.\n\nDr. Palmer loves getting to know the patient as a whole to help them in the best way possible to meet all of their vision and medical needs. She enjoys patient education and believes in forming a partnership with her patients and making decisions as a team.

Now that Colorado is one of the nation's leading states for optometry innovation, she looks forward to practicing full scope medical optometry.

She moved to Denver when she was 18, after the loss of her Mother, to be closer to her sister. She started her journey working in the oil business for about 10 years.\n\nAfter the ups and downs of the oil industry, she then went to work for a national non-profit organization in the nutrition field. Vikki worked with the Wheat Foods Council for 16 years and says she enjoyed every minute of it. Sadly, due to the downfall in 2008, the Council needed to downscale and the decision to run the office from the president's home became the economical way to go.\n\nVikki joined Fresenius Medical Care in 2013 and worked at dialysis placement for kidney patients for 5 years. The job was a very high stress role and after the 5 years, it was time to move on.\n\nAn opening in the WalMart Vision Center in Castle Rock became available and it was a good way for her to get her foot into the industry of optician. Vikki joined the Front Range Family Eye Care in November of 2018 and as she states it, âI am glad to have this wonderful opportunity to further in the field of Optician. This is such an exciting time for me as science is finding new technology in eye health care and for preventing certain eye diseasesâ.\n\nBrenda Sherwood, ABOC Optician\n\nBrenda was born and raised in Minnesota.
