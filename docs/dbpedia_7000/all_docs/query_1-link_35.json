        "text": "This paper attempts to reveal the central role of subject matter in teaching thinking, and in so doing, criticise the skill-oriented approach adopted in Singapore. Based upon Dewey&#39;s idea of psychologizing the subject matter, this paper introduces the idea-based approach in which subject matter is used as the most important intellectual resource for developing thinking and as a cen­ tral framework for introducing educative experience. Focusing on the assumptions about subject matter, learning to think, and teaching thinking, a comparison and contrast between the two approaches has been made to reveal the problems inherent in the skill-oriented approach. This paper contends that the skill-oriented approach fails to consider subject matter to be the most im­ portant resource in developing thinking. It is grounded in a faulty assumption which separates subject matter and thinking. It creates a tendency of ignoring the concepts, principles, and criteria embodied in subject matter in...\n\nPaul Natorp, John Dewey and Sergius Hessen are usually considered to represent three different philosophical and pedagogical doctrines developed at the turn of the Twentieth century. These are, respectively: neo-Kantianism, pragmatism and humanistic pedagogy widely rooted in Wil-helm Dilthey' s philosophy. Contrary to this common classification, Hessen himself described his own concept of pedagogy as an applied philosophy as a continuation of Natorp' s thought. However, Hessen also noted that an approach very similar to his one can be found (with some restrictions) in John Dewey' s theory. In this case, the fundamental issue is to determine the relationship between philosophy and pedagogical theory and practise. The main parts of this article will identify the specificity of this relationship: the specificity implied by the concept of pedagogy understood as applied philosophy. The concept of pedagogy, understood as an applied philosophy in its theoretical and practical aspects, is the basis for critical reconstruction of social life in general. It is the opinion shared by all three philosophers that this type of reconstruction should be based on the communal dimension of basic social interactions, that is, on the communal dimension of work. The only way for the renewal of a different form of social life leads through regaining through them an essential communal dimension of human work. All three authors agreed that to regain the communal dimension of human work by another form of social interaction would only be possible when certain conditions are present; that is, when work will be permeated by individual creativity. The presence of such conditions shall be ensured by the educational community. Thus, the educational community should be a starting and end point for any critical social reconstruction as well as for the pedagogy understood as an applied philosophy.\n\nThis paper is on-School Culture as a determinant of Students' Academic Performance in Public Examinations in Mezam Division, North West, Region Cameroon‖ was designed to find out the extent to which school culture influences students' academic performance in public secondary grammar schools within Mezam Division. The study had one specific objective, one research question and one hypothesis. Related literature was reviewed, conceptually, theoretically and empirically. This paper adopted a cross-sectional survey research design with mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative approaches) in the collection and analysis of data. The instruments of questionnaire (for quantitative data) and focus group discussions (for qualitative data) were used in gathering information. The purposive sampling technique, simple random sampling technique and the accidental sampling technique were used to determine the area of study, the area for data collection and the respondents for the study respectively. The sample consists of 48 schools, 48 principals, 313 teachers both male and female, from government secondary grammar schools. Analysis of statistical data was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 20.0 with results presented on tables and figures. The technique of content analysis was used to analyze the focus group discussions. The findings revealed that, all the indicators of school culture (Distributive leadership, principal's effective communication, professional staff development, supportive learning environment, teacher collegiality and teacher commitment) significantly affect students' academic performance. Based on the findings, the researcher recommends that there is need for the government to provide organized and systemic training in educational leadership and management for school principals, in order to enable them effectively handle their-roles as instructional leaders within schools, builders of learning communities among teachers, and developers of strong community participation in schools.\n\nThis paper investigates the importance of the social dimension in the conception of the concept developed by Dewey. It explores the concept as a component of the meaning of the experience. As such, philosophy can be understood as the study of the experience of life, and a process of reconstruction of concepts through the critique of habits and cultural prejudices, and the construction of new hypotheses that operate as a source of both emancipation and enrichment. The concept operates like an instrument in the conduct of intelligent experience, and language plays a basic role in this process as the “instrument of the instruments.” Language makes it possible to represent the uses of the concept, and to enlarge experience indefinitely through free communication. Democratic life is the only form life worthy of human beings. In it, conjoint associated experience reaches its full form in the free and necessary communication of concepts between individuals, and in the shared action that pr...\n\nThis review paper on John Dewey, the pioneering educationist of the 20th century, discusses his educational thoughts, and writings, which gave a new direction to education at the turn of the century. Dewey’s contributions are immense and overwhelming in the fields of education, politics, humanism, logic, and aesthetics. This discussion will focus on Dewey and his philosophy related to educational approaches, pedagogical issues, and the linkages that he made between education, democracy, experience, and society. At the heart of his educational thought is the child. Dewey’s idea on humanism springs from his democratic bent and his quest for freedom, equity, and the value of child’s experiences."
