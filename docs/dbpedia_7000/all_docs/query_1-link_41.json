        "text": "California Education Code requires that all candidates for a teaching credential must demonstrate they are proficient in the subject matter area of their intended credential\n\nSubject matter proficiency may be demonstrated through one of the following options:\n\nCompletion of a subject matter program approved by the commission.\n\nPassage of a subject matter examination (the California Subject Examination for Teachers or CSET)\n\nThrough a major that matches a subject matter in which the commission credentials candidates (see more information below).\n\nSuccessful completion of coursework at one or more regionally accredited institutions of higher education that addresses each of the domains of the subject matter requirements.\n\nThrough a combination of coursework and CSET so that all domains are met.\n\nMore information from CTC: https://www.ctc.ca.gov/educator-prep/subject-matter-requirements\n\nSubject Matter Chart of Options: https://www.ctc.ca.gov/docs/default-source/educator-prep/files/subject-matter-chart-of-options.pdf?sfvrsn=574a20b1_9\n\nMeeting Subject Matter through Major\n\nWith the passing of AB 130, it is possible to meet subject matter through a major that matches the majors specified in the legislation.\n\nThe major match should be done by the approved teacher education program where you will be completing your credential as the credential analyst of that institution must verify the major match when recommending you for a credential at the end of your program.\n\nThe majors (BA/BS/MA/MS) must have been conferred by a regionally accredited university and the academic degree major must match the subject area of the credential being sought.\n\nSubmitted transcripts must show the conferral of the degree. Please do not submit until your degree is posted on your transcripts.\n\nThis option is currently available for candidates who have completed an academic degree in a major that exactly matches one of those identified in the law as indicated below:\n\nSubject Matter for Multiple Subjects may be met by the following majors:\n\nLiberal Studies\n\nElementary Education\n\nLiberal Arts (must say Liberal Arts as the degree)\n\nAB 130 also allows for a bachelor’s degree or higher in a major that includes all of the subject areas identified in Education Code §44282(b): language studies, literature, mathematics, science, social studies, history, arts, physical education, and human development.\n\nSingle Subject Credentials: The major must match in one of the subjects named in Education Code section 44257(a). In addition, any degree major that includes the name of the subject area of the single subject credential will meet subject matter. The credential areas that the CSUDH Teacher Education Division offers are:\n\nArt\n\nBiological Sciences: Biology, biological engineering, or biochemistry\n\nChemistry: Chemistry, chemical engineering and biochemistry\n\nEnglish\n\nFoundational Science: A degree in engineering or another degree offered by a science department\n\nGeoscience: Geology or Earth Science\n\nHealth Science\n\nMathematics (also a degree in statistics or applied mathematics)\n\nMusic: Music\n\nPhysical Education (May say Kinesiology if it also says Physical Education as part of the degree.)\n\nPhysics: Physics, mechanical or structural engineering\n\nSocial Science: BA must say Social Science in the degree or student may submit under course review\n\nWorld Language: May be in any of the languages for which there is a credential. For example, a major in Spanish would meet subject matter for World Languages: Spanish. Also includes World Language: American Sign Language (ASL)\n\nEducation Specialist Credentials (Special Education)\n\nMild/Moderate Support Needs or Extensive Support Needs candidates may utilize subject matter in multiple subjects or in any single subject area.\n\nEarly Childhood Special Education Candidates are not currently required to meet subject matter\n\nAt this time, the Commission will also accept applied majors in the single subject credential areas (e.g., Applied Mathematics, Applied Physics) and exact majors in one of the single subject areas that may have additional modifiers (e.g., Biology: Environmental Biology; Art: Art History; and Physical Education: Kinesiology).\n\nDownload the directions and form below for the major match. The directions will include the link to upload your transcripts to a secure Dropbox. Please, plan ahead as processing may take several weeks.\n\nSubject Matter Through Major Instructions\n\nSubject Matter Verification through Major\n\nMeeting Subject Matter through Coursework Review\n\nCoursework may now be used to meet subject matter for a particular credential type (such as multiple subjects, English, math etc.) instead of CSET or an approved subject matter program. A combination of CSET and coursework may also be used; however, the domains covered by a particular CSET subtest must ALL be met by coursework in lieu of taking that subtest.\n\nPlease read the directions carefully and then upload your folder with all required materials to the Dropbox included in the directions.\n\nDirections:\n\nIMPORTANT: This subject evaluation form is only valid in the College of Education at CSUDH for\n\nadmissions and for a credential application at CSUDH.\n\nPLAN AHEAD: the review may take 6-8 weeks. Some reviews are sent to other departments for review and most reviews take 1-3 hours to complete.\n\nCourse Review for Subject Matter Worksheets:\n\nMultiple Subjects\n\nMultiple Subjects Worksheet\n\nSingle Subject"
