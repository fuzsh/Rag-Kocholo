        "text": "Hey Spiceheads,\n\nI’m the IT Manager for an educational institution, and I frequently receive requests for new laptops from various department heads.\n\nThis got me thinking – what’s your opinion on the usage of laptops in an educational environment? Do you make it work, and if so, how?\n\nI personally am not a fan at all - students tend to break or vandalise things, they could get lost or even stolen and keeping track of them obviously isn’t as easy as fixed PCs. Trouble is, laptops do have the benefit of portability and I can’t think of an alternate solution.\n\nAlso FYI - the laptops wouldn’t be taken off-site at any point in time.\n\nThe traditional British approach to IT was to have IT rooms with the PCs in. Speaking as an ex teacher this was so frustrating because those rooms got booked up and in my case it was rare that I could get into them with a relevant lesson. Some teachers bloc booked the rooms. Laptops allow a more flexible approach to lesson plans and can separate them from the IT room. Also, they can be used for part of a lesson for instance. In my experience, damage was rare and accidental. Hopefully the teachers at your institution have good control of the lesson and the students. So I would not deny or resist the use of laptops in your school.\n\nIf you want to bring in new laptops then there are various approaches. Most UK schools go with Windows offerings but in the USA Chromebooks have taken 58% of the laptop market in about 4 years leaving about 20% each for Windows and Apple products respectively. I have read comments like \" I would prefer 1000 Chromebooks to look after than 10 Windows machines\". Google offer ways of controlling this for schools and it means that there work and log on is available on any machine anywhere. So worth while looking at them.\n\nDo people want them as status symbols? I guess some do but they are part of teaching nowadays and it is expected that they should have the laptops. Whether you expect staff to buy their own or not is a consideration. It depends upon the budget and the ethos at the school.\n\nWe have laptops for grades 6-12 now that are take home (Chromebooks for 6-10 with Windows laptops for 11-12 grade). We will be adding Chromebooks for 3-5 next year that will stay in a cart in the classrooms. Our Windows laptops at the high schools will be phased out year by year and replaced with Chromebooks. We asset tag all of our devices and assign a device to a student based on their student number using a custom database. The students are responsible to bring the laptop to school every morning fully charged, however that does not always happen.\n\nAs far as damage, the student is ultimately responsible. If the damage does not affect functionality, we do not repair or invoice them until the end of their 8th grade year, where they will get a new Chromebook to keep for 9-12 grade. If the damage is caused by another student and it can be proven, then the other student is invoiced. If a device it out for repair, the student gets a loaner until their actual device is repaired. If the device comes up missing, the student is required to file a police report right away and is invoiced for a full replacement device. If they happen to find the lost device, the invoice is then voided.\n\nWe repair all of our own devices. Most are out of warranty, but for those that are still under warranty, we have technicians that are brand trained (HP and Lenovo) to perform warranty repairs. We see a lot of Chromebooks just stop working for one reason or another and necessarily the fault of the student. Our Windows laptops have held up a lot better than the Chromebooks, but were a lot more expensive, so when it comes to Chromebooks, you truly get what you pay for. It seems that all manufacturers of Chromebooks have something they are known for failing. Last year, the Lenovo N22 was known for a particular key on the keyboard to stop working. All seemed to be affected by touchpads that stop working. Sometimes updating the OS fixes it for a while, but not always. Several of the HP Chromebooks we have, had bad touchpads out of the box. From a manageability standpoint, Chromebooks might be easier, but from a repair standpoint, expect to pay out of the nose for parts. We spend about $8000-$12000 a month in parts. An extended warranty would have only been $109K for two years for 4500 Chromebooks, which I highly recommend you look into, if you go that route. Most Windows enterprise computers come with a three warranty, whereas the Chromebooks only come with a 1-year standard warranty. And for those of you looking at getting “enterprise” Chromebooks for $600-$800, just get a Windows laptop of the same cost. It’s the same underlying technology as in the $199 Chromebooks, just in a little better case.\n\nAll teachers have a laptop to take home with them and a desktop in their classroom. I wish we held the teachers to the same standards we do the students when it comes to damage. Currently, we absorb the cost of a new system board when it gets liquid damage and nothing happens to the teacher.\n\nmtarggart very good description of your experience. Your use of laptops is much greater than a typical British school in which SClouston, the starter of this topic, works. I am retired but have 2 cheap refurbished Chromebooks.made in 2014. One (HP14) my wife uses and I never get complaints about it like I used to with earlier laptops (result) and an Acer 720 Model ZHN on which I took out Chrome OS and replaced it with Linux and added a larger ssd. Neither have had a problem. I take the C720 on flights, etc and so far it is robust enough to not suffer any damage. I am using it now and looked at the battery life which says in excess of 5 hours. Obviously with your numbers your experience is much better than mine. I believe that there is a good case for buying cheap Chromebooks knowing that they may not last; but at a third of the cost of their enterprise counterparts are you bothered as much. Also, if you bill parents for broken or lost laptops you will find it easier to get the money from them?\n\nHi OP, it looks like your fellow SpiceHeads have jumped in with some great advice on laptop options for the classroom. As a few mentioned, Chromebooks could definitely be worth considering. Many of the Chromebook options we have at @Samsung_USA are actually specifically designed for the education industry. These Chromebooks come with several curated education solutions from Samsung, as well as some of the top education software companies, integrated into the hardware. To the point that Peter mentioned, some options also come ready for the classroom with methods of control via Google Play for Education and Google Support for School. If you are interested in learning more feel free to check out our technology in education solutions here: Educational Technology | Technology in the Classroom | Samsung Business | US\n\nI also wanted to share, in case it’s ever a helpful resource for you, that we do have a ton of great ideas for tech classroom and learning initiatives that we post on the Samsung Insights Blog- Education Industry sectio n.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions! Wishing you the best of luck finding the right solution for your school!\n\nWe are 1 to 1 chromebooks. The key to breakage is the kids taking ownership of the devices, PERIOD. You can’t limit or not let them take home over the weekends. The more limits you put on them, the more they will NOT take ownership. We have a self insurance policy that they can pay $35 for the year that will pay for the labor (me) and half the cost of a part. Without insurance, it is full price of part and full price of my labor, which we charge $50 an hour. Yes cheaper than other computer stores. The chromebooks is the easiest thing to keep going. Parts are easy to replace. The chromebooks are under $200 for everything. We get a great bag that they have to carry in too. With this move, 2 yrs ago, we have moved to an LMS and are only buying a 1 set of textbooks in the classroom. Most textbooks are online now anyway. The kids love it, the staff is getting use to it and as an IT for the district of 950 kids and over 1600+ devices, that is the easiest part of my job right there. No AD crap to worry about. Just Google Admin and the routers at school for filtering. EASY!!!\n\nWe have been a 1-1 school for more than 10 years. We started with a couple of laptop carts that teachers and students would have to sign out/in. As the use of these laptops increased, we moved to the 1-1 program with tablet pc’s. The students can be pretty rough with the machines. We have seen some strange things. The tablet pc’s come with a quality care program that will fix just about anything during the school year at no cost. Second repairs to the same machine are charged to the family. Most warranty repairs are done onsite by authorized personnel from vendor. We flip flop at times but currently the school leases the pc’s not the families. They are, therefore, owned by us and we can be a bit more strict on what is allowed on “school” machines. We tend to purchase more laptops to be used as loaners than suggested but found that to be necessary. The school is a Windows school though more and more of the things we do are cloud based. The future is looking like BYOD… eventually."
