        "text": "What is wellbeing at school?\n\nWellbeing is a state in which pupils are able to develop their potential, learn and play creatively.\n\nConcretely, wellbeing at school means\n\nfeeling safe, valued and respected\n\nbeing actively and meaningfully engaged in academic and social activities\n\nhaving positive self-esteem, self-efficacy and a sense of autonomy\n\nhaving positive and supportive relationships with teachers and peers\n\nfeeling a sense of belonging to their classroom and school\n\nfeeling happy and satisfied with their lives at school\n\nPupils who experience wellbeing can build and enjoy positive relationships with others and feel belonging to their school community.\n\nWhat are the current challenges?\n\nThe latest Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results indicate that pupils’ sense of belonging at school is declining and (cyber)bullying is widespread.\n\nResearch underlines that school bullying has devastating consequences on learners’ health and academic achievement and increases the risk of early school leaving.\n\nAround 20% of school children experience mental health problems, in particular anxiety and depression.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has made this issue even more prominent, with many pupils suffering from reduced emotional wellbeing and motivation.\n\nThe ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and the challenge of ensuring the inclusion of Ukrainian refugee children in schools across the European Union (EU) makes wellbeing in schools all the more relevant.\n\nSchools and teachers are not sufficiently prepared to deal with these issues and need to be supported.\n\nThe wellbeing of teachers and that of students is closely connected. Teachers need to experience a state of wellbeing themselves in order to be able to contribute to ensuring the wellbeing and mental health of their students.\n\nWhy it is so important to address them?\n\nSchools are key to the promotion of mental health and wellbeing among young people. Children and young people spend a considerable amount time at school during a critical period for the development of their personality and socio-emotional competences.\n\nResearch indicates that incorporating socio-emotional learning, mental health, wellbeing and bullying prevention programmes in schools is one of the most effective ways to support the psychological wellbeing of children and young people, including those experiencing disadvantage and marginalisation.\n\nThis is in line with a more holistic vision of education, which recognises that children and adolescents need a balanced set of cognitive, social and emotional competences to achieve positive outcomes in school and in life.\n\nSuch an approach recognises the social, emotional and physical needs of children and young people and includes wellbeing and mental health as a key learning goal.\n\nThe link between academic and socio-emotional learning has been clearly underlined by empirical evidence, including neuroscientific research, demonstrating that learning is a relational and emotional process. Addressing learners’ wellbeing is therefore key to raising educational outcomes.\n\nWhat is the EU doing to tackle these issues?\n\nThePathways to School Success initiative aims to promote better educational outcomes for all learners and the wellbeing of learners and educators at school.\n\nAn expert group will develop proposals on strategies for creating supportive learning environments for groups at risk of underachievement and for supporting wellbeing at school.\n\nThe expert group will start its activities in 2023."
