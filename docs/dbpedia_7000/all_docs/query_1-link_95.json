        "text": "1-The teacher's professional competence entails a complete understanding of the subject matter he teaches to deliver the lesson appropriately.\n\nIn one, subject matter refers to the subject he or she teaches.\n\n2. Too meet the standardized teaching criteria, one should have a full scale of the subject knowledge in the field he teaches in.\n\n2- in two, subject knowledge pertains the experiences and skills the person has in particular field.\n\nIn one, subject matter refers to the subject he or she teaches.\n\nHere simply 'subject' would be correct.\n\n' . . . a complete understanding of the subject matter he or she teaches . . . '\n\n2- in two, subject knowledge pertains the experiences and skills the person has in particular field.\n\nThis sentence has several errors, and 'subject knowledge' is one of them.

Have you seen it somewhere?\n\n'Knowledge of the subject' might work, but the sentence needs to be significantly rewritten.\n\nHere simply 'subject' would be correct.\n\n' . . . a complete understanding of the subject matter he or she teaches . . .

I hope my understanding of subject knowledge is correct.\n\nCould please specify what mistakes I made in explaining what subject knowledge is?\n\nNow, I am puzzled between subject matter and subject knowledge. ðŸ˜©\n\nThis sentence has several errors, and 'subject knowledge' is one of them. It doesn't make any sense. Have you seen it somewhere?\n\n'Knowledge of the subject' might work, but the sentence needs to be significantly rewritten.\n\nIf the person is well-versed in particular field is this called specialized knowledge or subject knowledge?\n\nSorry for bothering you. Thank you ðŸ˜Š\n\nMay I ask why subject matter is incorrect?\n\n'Subject matter' is the theme or topic or substance of, say, a conversation, or letter, or document. It's not a 'subject', like history, geography, Latin or physics, that a teacher might teach.\n\nsubject matter - WordReference.com Dictionary of English\n\nI can't remember the context of \"subject knowledge\". I hope my understanding of subject knowledge is correct.\n\nI can't imagine any sentence or context that might include \"subject knowledge\". I recommend forgetting it.\n\nCould please specify what mistakes I made in explaining what subject knowledge is?\n\nThere are mistakes in both sentences labelled '2' in your post #3, but I'm afraid we can't proofread or correct entire sentences here.\n\n'Subject matter' is the theme or topic or substance of, say, a conversation, or letter, or document. It's not a 'subject', like history, geography, Latin or physics, that a teacher might teach.\n\nsubject matter - WordReference.com Dictionary of English\n\nI can't imagine any sentence or context that might include \"subject knowledge\". I recommend forgetting it.\n\nThere are mistakes in both sentences labelled '2' in your post #3, but I'm afraid we can't proofread or correct entire sentences here.\n\nSubject knowledge is used in pedagogical context.\n\nThere are many examples:\n\n1-Strong subject knowledge is the most important component of being a good teacher, a major education conference has heard.\n\nSubject knowledge is prime factor in good teaching, experts say - Madrassah\n\n2-Tom points out that subject knowledge adds texture to a lesson â€“ it gives the details. It varies hugely by subject, but Geography is a discipline made of connections. You never quite know what knowledge might be relevant to a lesson until something comes up.\n\nDeveloping subject knowledge\n\nNow another question arises , what is the difference between subject knowledge and specialized knowledge?\n\n1-Strong subject knowledge is the most important component of being a good teacher,\n\nsubject knowledge adds texture to a lesson\n\nThese are both fine. You could exchange subject knowledge for specialized knowledge if you wanted, but since we talk about subjects when discussing teaching, it doesn't improve the sentence to change the wording. It makes sense here to use subject knowledge."
