        "text": "Search Other Databases\n\nEach database has a unique collection of resources. Try several databases to be sure you are finding all of the available articles on your topic.\n\nRefine Your Keywords\n\nSelecting the right keywords, or search terms, is the most difficult aspect of a search. Try to brainstorm a list of any and all search terms you could use for your topic.\n\nSee the Keyword Searching guide for help.\n\nExpand Your Topic\n\nYou may need to think of ways to look more broadly at your topic. There may not be research on a very specifically focused topic, but there is almost always research that is related to a topic in some way. Take out keywords that focus on the more specific parts of your topic. Try using related search terms or looking at different aspects of your topic.\n\nShould you find articles on your specific topic?\n\nDissertation research topics need to fill a gap in current research or practice. Your research question should not already have an answer in the research literature. You will find resources that address different portions of your topic.\n\nHow should you search?\n\nPlace the concepts from your question within the context of the existing literature. Search for portions of your topic, but not all aspects at one time.\n\nThere may be research that looks at a slightly different population, or that addresses a related intervention.\n\nTextbook and course readings\n\nYour required readings should give you a broad background in what is going on in your field. Look for interesting topics you can expand for your own research.\n\nExplore the literature\n\nIf you have experience in your field you may be able to translate it into a research topic. Explore the literature of a topic that interests you and you may find ideas for your topic. Click the \"Explore the Literature\" tab above to learn more.\n\nCurrent events and recent issues of journals\n\nWhile an item in the news may be too recent to use as a topic, you may be able to relate it to an existing area of research. Recent issues of scholarly journals cover topics of current interest to researchers."
