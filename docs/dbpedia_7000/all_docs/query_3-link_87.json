        "text": "Education is a basic human right for all and is important for everyone to make the most of their lives. Other human rights include the right to freedom from slavery or torture and to a fair trial.\n\nHaving an education helps people to access all of their other human rights. Education improves an individual’s chances in life and helps to tackle poverty.\n\nAccording to the the most recent figures available from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics in July 2016, 263 million children and youth are out of school.\n\nThis includes 61 million children who should be in primary school, 60 million of lower secondary school age (ages 12 to 14) and 142 million who are aged between 15 and 17.\n\nGirls and children from sub-Saharan Africa are most likely to be missing out on their education.\n\nArmed conflict also means that children struggle to get an education – 22 million children of primary school age are affected by this. 75 million children and adolescents have had their education directly affected by conflict and emergencies.\n\nEvery person is entitled to a quality education without discrimination, which means:\n\nA compulsory free primary school education for every child\n\nSecondary school (including technical training) must be available to everyone – states must work towards providing this for free\n\nHigher education must be equally accessible, with countries working towards the goal of making this free\n\nFundamental education for those who missed out on primary school should be encouraged and available\n\nIt also means parents have the right to choose schools for their children and for individuals and organisations to set up schools that meet minimum standards.\n\nTheirworld also believes that every child should have access to two years of free, quality pre-primary education.\n\nGovernments must provide good quality education and make sure all children can access it, without discrimination.\n\nThis is an international legal obligation and governments can be held accountable for failing to provide education for all its citizens.\n\nEducation has been recorded as a basic human right in international law since 1948. It is included in many documents and treaties including:\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)\n\nConvention Against Discrimination in Education (1960)\n\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966)\n\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979)\n\nAfrican Charter on Human and People’s Rights (1986)\n\nConvention on the Rights of the Child (1989)\n\nWorld Declaration on Education for All: Meeting Basic Learning Needs (1990)\n\nThe Dakar Framework for Action: Education for All (2000)\n\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006)\n\nUN General Assembly Resolution on the Right to Education in Emergency Situations (2010)\n\nThe international community knows that achieving the full extent of the right to education will take time and resources.\n\nGovernments must put plans in place to meet the minimum standard of free, compulsory primary education and then take steps to extend the right to education to every child.\n\nThe right to education without discrimination is part of the minimum standard and must be created immediately.\n\nIt’s very important that governments continue to work towards the full right to education and don’t allow plans to stall or be delayed.\n\nAs well as governments, other organisations and individuals play a part in making sure that all children can access quality education. These include intergovernmental agencies such as UNESCO, international financial institutions, businesses, civil societies and parents."
