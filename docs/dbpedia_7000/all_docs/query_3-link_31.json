        "text": "About Topics and Subtopics\n\nTopics are broad and will allow you to see the most survey options across these high-level categories and the many subtopics within them. Subtopics are very specific and allow you to see which primary topics a subtopic can be found in.\n\nExample A: Selecting a Topic First:\n\nSelecting the âeconomicâ topic reveals all surveys that collect any type of economic data. Economic data is available across multiple subtopics such as business or household. Using the subtopic dropdown next, will allow you to pick what kind of economic data you want.\n\nExample B, Selecting a Subtopic First\n\nSelecting the subtopic first will reveal all surveys across all primary topics that have your subtopic. If you selected the household subtopic, you will see that data can be found in economic, social, housing, and demographic surveys. Using the topic filter next will allow you to see the type of survey you want.\n\nThese two options should yield the same choices when both topic and subtopic are selected, but depending on the research needs and interests, it may be helpful to select one method or the other."
