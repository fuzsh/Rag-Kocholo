        "text": "The first time the YES (Year End Seminar) took place, in 1987, the main goal of the event was for the students to reflect on their exchange year and prepare them for reverse culture shock before arriving back home. The initiative started from the need to have a more coherent year-end seminar, back when not every YFU organisation was following the LOOP structure or did not even organize post exchange orientations.\n\nTo ensure that all the YFU exchange students have the same quality of post exchange orientation and to create a space where YFU students could meet peers who went in exchange to other countries, central European YFU organisations took the initiative to organize one large seminar, gathering students from all over Europe. The event served as a post-exchange reflection seminar as well as an opportunity for counseling and feedback to the YFU community.\n\nThe first years, the YES took place in Germany, gathering approximately 150 students. Afterwards, YFU Benelux and YFU Denmark also hosted the event in their countries, followed by YFU Czechoslovakia, YFU Switzerland, YFU Finland, YFU Norway, YFU Estonia, YFU Netherlands, YFU Hungary, YFU Romania, YFU Belgium, YFU Turkey, YFU Lithuania, YFU Austria and YFU France.\n\nThe growing number of participants made organizing more challenging, and more volunteers were needed to support the event. From early 2000, the organizing responsibility was shared between multiple countries, creating an international volunteer team that worked one year in advance to prepare the event.\n\nIn 2007, the name of the event was changed from Year End Seminar to Young Europeansâ€™ Seminar, highlighting that the content would include more elements about the European identity and values. Every year, a leading topic was chosen by the Content Team, motivating students not only to reflect on their exchange year, but also on social issues, environment, migration, tolerance, nationalism and history.\n\nSince then, the seminar became even more inclusive, and its goal was not only to empower young Europeans anymore but more widely to empower YFU youth from the entire world."
