        "text": "Demonstration of Subject Matter\n\nCalifornia Education Code requires that all candidates for a teaching credential must demonstrate they are proficient in the subject matter area of their intended credential. Recent action by the Governor and the Legislature on AB 130 (Chapter 44, Statutes of 2021) has expanded the ways in which candidates may demonstrate subject matter proficiency. At this time, some aspects of the new law may be implemented while other aspects require regulatory approval by the Office of Administrative Law. The information below describes the various options allowable by this new law. For more information, please see PSA 23-04.\n\nCandidates interested in taking advantage of the new options should contact their current or prospective program sponsor (college, university, or – for District Interns – employer).\n\nWebinar Technical Assistance for Programs (10/19/21) Available:\n\nWebinar on the Implementation of AB 130: Subject Matter Requirement | Presentation Slides [PDF]\n\nSubject matter proficiency may be demonstrated through one of the following options:\n\n1) Completion of a subject matter program approved by the commission.\n\n2) Passage of a subject matter examination (the California Subject Examination for Teachers or CSET).\n\n3) Successful completion of coursework at one or more regionally accredited institutions of higher education that addresses each of the domains of the subject matter requirements adopted by the commission in the content area of the credential pursuant to Section 44282, as verified by a Commission-approved program of professional preparation.
