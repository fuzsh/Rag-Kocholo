        "text": "Introduction:\n\nJust like any other writing, the introduction sets the foundation for the rest of the paper. In the case of writing a literature review, you will start by mentioning the topic you have chosen to research. In addition to mentioning the topic, you want to include why it’s important to your field of study (i.e. medical, education, politics). You’ll also want to give a brief overview of the literature you have reviewed, this could tie into the way you organize your paper (i.e. What themes did you find? What theories were most prevalent?) Lastly, you’ll want to state your thesis–why should people continue exploring this topic?.\n\nBody:\n\nYour body paragraphs may differ slightly depending on how you organize your paper, however, it should have the same general layout. To begin any of your body paragraphs, you will introduce the reason as to why you are grouping together the articles (i.e. thematically, chronologically). Then, you will go into reviewing your sources. The review will consist of the research questions the literature looked at, methods (i.e. survey, observations) used to find the answers, and findings. If you are organizing your literature review by themes, it’s important to note that you can use one piece of literature multiple times as long as it correlates to your different theme.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the conclusion, you will evaluate the literature in your paper without adding bias. Some key questions that should be answered in your conclusion are:\n\nWhat does this research contribute to the field?\n\nYou may have mentioned something similar in your introduction with why it’s important to look at this literature. But now, since you’ve reviewed the literature, this proposes a great chance to pull out key points you want your reader to take away from your topic; it can also create a segway to restate your thesis.\n\nWhat are the strengths and limitations in this literature?\n\nFocusing on the strengths and limitations show your analysis skills to the readers. When mentioning the strengths and limitations, it’s also important to mention why the strengths and limitations are important to the research or how it can seem outdated. Examples of strengths and weaknesses that you could review are the participants (i.e. group size, race, age), the methods of the studies, or any bias. Looking at strengths and weaknesses can open up a chance for opportunity for other researchers or people interested in the topic.\n\nWhat is missing that would be important to include?\n\nThis can be an opportunity to connect and create conversation between sources. Looking for gaps can include something you saw in one source that you wish you would’ve seen in more sources; it’s important to elaborate why this missing gap should’ve been included more. This can also be a chance to bring in your background knowledge on your topic to create a drive for research you wish you saw more of; again, it is important to explain yourself and why filling these gaps would be essential.\n\nWhat next steps could be taken in future research?\n\nIf you choose to include this in your conclusion, it’s important that, as the critiquer, you mention how new research can make up for the weaknesses and missing gaps. Why should the future research disregard the weaknesses? Why are the missing gaps important to study and how can they include the missing gaps in their research?"
