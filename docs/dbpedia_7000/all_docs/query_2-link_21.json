        "text": "Question A is the best research question.\n\nYour research to answer this question may include observation of print, television and radio advertisements, as well as research into various, current marketing theories and strategies. Both types of research are \"do-able,\" and the question is focused enough to yield a fully-developed research paper.\n\nQuestion A is too broad once you get into the research.\n\nBecause deregulation may have had impact on safety, costs, passenger fees, ability to comply with government regulations, and many other areas of the airline industry, there are too many facets of the question to deal with in depth in one research paper.\n\nQuestion C is the best research question.\n\nYou may use statistics such as question B would uncover as you answer question C, which is focused enough to allow you to research the question in some depth, yet broad enough to allow you to consider the various effects of deregulation on airline safety.\n\nThe best research question is B.\n\nThe topic is broad enough to find more than just one or two sources, but it's limited to one focus--the development of preschool language skills.\n\nThere may or may not be enough information to answer question C.\n\nYou'd need to find more than just one or two studies if you chose to answer question C. If you find that there are enough sources dealing with vocabulary only, then you could choose to pursue question C.\n\nQuestion A is far too narrow to develop into a research paper.\n\nYou could answer this question in one sentence, and the question does not allow you to develop your own thoughts about the topic.\n\nQuestion C is the best choice.\n\nYou might be asking, \"How can I research something whose effect hasn't been felt yet?\" You can posit what \"might happen logically\" in the future based on what \"has happened\" in the past. For example, your research may bring you to the major things thought to have caused obesity in the recent last two to three decades in order to establish a direct relationship between cause and treatment. Once you establish that direct cause-and-effect relationship, you can project similar types of relationships based on the new genetic research.\n\nQuestion A is the best choice.\n\nIt narrows the scope by focusing on only the most positive ways of interaction. It also asks you to use the research to support your own informed judgment, which you provide eventually in the final research paper, thus creating interest as well as focus.\n\nQuestion B may be too broad.\n\nAt first glance, there is not much difference between questions A and B, but there is one major difference: Question B asks for the variety of ways in which adult children of alcoholics interact with their alcoholic parents. Substantial research has identified many patterns of interaction, so this question may be too broad to deal with in the scope of one research paper."
