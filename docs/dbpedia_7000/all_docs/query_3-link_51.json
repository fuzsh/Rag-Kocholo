        "text": "The words that you type into a search box are the key to finding the most relevant articles and books. That's why they're called keywords!\n\nYou'll need to choose keywords carefully. See the steps below (or if you prefer, here is a short video).\n\n1. Write out a brief description (1 or 2 sentences) of your research topic. It can be very helpful to phrase it in the form of a question that you'd like to answer. (See the research question example below.)\n\n2. Identify the most important 2 - 4 words from your research question. These are your key concepts.\n\nTip:\n\nTo decide which words are most important, imagine that you need to explain your topic to someone using no more than 4 words. Words like \"does,\" \"the,\" \"in,\" or \"of\" (while useful in a sentence) won't be specific enough, so you wouldn't use those.\n\n3. For each key concept, make a list of other words with the same or related meanings. These will be your keywords!\n\nTips:\n\nUse a thesaurus to find synonyms.\n\nThink of specific examples or types.\n\nIf your topic is something you don't know enough about yet, it can be hard to think of synonyms or examples. Find some background information on your topic to help jump-start your brainstorming!\n\nLook at an example:\n\nResearch question: \"Does the use of social networking in online classes help students learn?\"\n\nKey concepts and keywords:\n\nstudents\n\nlearners\n\ncollege students\n\nundergraduates\n\nonline classes\n\nonline course\n\ndistance education\n\nremote learning\n\nsocial networking\n\nsocial media\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nlearn\n\nlearning\n\nsuccess\n\nperformance\n\ngrades\n\n1. Go to the library's homepage and find the Everything search box.\n\n2. Choose one keyword from each concept list. Type those keywords into the search box. Type AND between each one (learn about Boolean operators: AND, OR, NOT).\n\nExamples (from our list above):\n\nstudents AND online classes AND social networking AND learning\n\ncollege students AND online courses AND social media AND performance\n\nlearners AND online courses AND Facebook AND grades\n\n3. Click search and explore the results. Try several of your keyword combinations, and keep a list of the keywords that fetch the most relevant articles.\n\nIf you get too many results, try to narrow your search by adding more keywords.\n\nIf you get too few results, try to broaden your search by using fewer keywords.\n\n4. Look closely at the most relevant articles in your search results. You may see new author-supplied keywords or database subject headings that describe your topic. Add those terms to your list.\n\n5. Create new keyword combinations from your refined list of terms, and test them again!\n\nExamples:\n\nundergraduates AND online courses AND social networking\n\nstudent engagement AND higher education AND social networking\n\nlearning communities AND online courses AND social networking"
