        "text": "What Are The Most Popular Trends In Education?\n\nNote: The items below have been changed but the graphic itself still needs updating : )\n\nWhat about the most popular trends in education heading into 2024 specifically? Well, that’s a tricky question.\n\nDeciding what’s ‘trending’ is an important part of digital publishing and social media interaction. Facebook articles, Google News, Apple News, trending hashtags on twitter, and even our own TeachThought website all depend heavily on statistics.\n\nIt’s easy to have a problem with this concept philosophically–namely, the most popular isn’t always the most effective or the ‘best.’ So this post isn’t about the most innovative trends, most exciting trends, or most effective trends, but rather the most popular trends in innovative education insofar as we can see from our necessarily limited data and individual perspective.\n\nThe requirements?\n\n1. It must be ‘popular.’\n\n2. And it must involve some kind of ‘innovation’ or growth in education.\n\nHow We Measured\n\nSo how did we measure the ‘most popular trends’ in education?\n\nWe basically took four quantifiable data points and combined them with fallible but hopefully useful good old-fashioned human awareness and recognition. The result is four objective measures and on subjective ‘sense of things.’ We then combined them to create a ‘score,’ quantified on a scale of 1 through 10 where 10 is the highest.\n\n5 Data Points To Identify The Most Popular Trends In Education\n\n1. Popular search engine data (e.g., Google, Bing, etc.) [objective]\n\n2. TeachThought search data [objective]\n\n3. Traffic and search trends within and across popular education websites [objective]\n\n4. Social media metrics [objective]\n\n5. TeachThought editorial impression [subjective]\n\nBased on our search database trends, analytics data on content, and a decidedly unscientific but daily skimming of industry chatter, press releases, peer content, internal dialogue, and social media usage, here are–in light of the above–most popular 12 trends in innovative education for 2024.\n\nFor each, we’ve also shared one of our top bits of content to get you started reading. Also, feel free to use search to find and share additional resources as well.\n\nThis clearly has plenty of inherent bias built-in, is decidedly non-scientific, and is nowhere close to exhaustive. Take it with a grain of salt as one sampling of modern trends in ‘western’ K-12 public education.\n\n30 Of The Most Popular Trends In Education For 2024\n\n1.
