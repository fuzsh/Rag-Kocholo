        "text": "All education should be built around the social landscape and emotional constitution of a child. These are the two facets that drive the intentions and efforts of children.\n\nChildren should not be over stimulated by multiple subjects and topics that are not correlational with the everyday occurrences in their lives. It renders ideas and concepts as abstract and un-relatable.\n\nCurriculum should not be broken into silos. Singular subject matter is like a sandbox contrary to the unified characteristic of nature, human activity and reality. Focusing on only one subject gives effects similar to that of a radiation but without concentration.\n\nLiterature is by default an interpretation and expression of social and emotional experiences, and language a social tool to enable this. Therefore children may not derive value from texts that talk about something that has not been felt by them or cannot be shared by them.\n\nFrom history we must derive an index of the nuances of life and society through the ages, and apply these references to progress the culture and fabric of our society. If history is presented to children in an inert manner as a distant past which does not allow them to link it to the present “times” they can make no meaning of it.\n\nThe challenge with the teaching of science is that it is taught as detached concepts and experiences one after the other. Instead children should be allowed to reflect and deduce the findings of science from their everyday experiences. This would allow the concepts to be more relatable and encouragingly applicable.\n\nChildren should be made to learn by doing. By participating in basic everyday activities like cooking, cleaning, sewing or exercise children can be introduced to a wide array of subject knowledge in a functional and cohesive manner. Activity based learning should be the standard or norm since it is multi sensory and highly engaging.\n\nReal life is the world’s best classroom so we can conclusively say that everything in life has a scientific, mathematical, cultural, social and emotional aspect. Children develop new attitudes, interests, skills and faculties as they grow. The curriculum should therefore be scaffolded in these developmental terms; closely tied with things children of a particular age will encounter. Not only in terms of subjects and depth of its matter.\n\nGoing through subjects, school and education is a journey of reconstructed experiences and processes. If we try to govern this by defining any goals or ends beyond the journey we put ourselves at risk of being biased by them and treating our children in reference to such external stimuli. We should not lose sight of the fact that this journey is made experiential by the social and emotional worlds of children who do not have a say in choosing this as a pathway for themselves."
