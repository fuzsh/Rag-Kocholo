A person with a shallow but broad understanding of life or a field? Or a person witha deep but marrow understanding of life ro a subject?\n\nI say shallow but broad. If you know a little of something about everything there's almost nothing you can't tackle. Learn the basics and you won't need to get to deep into everything. Don't devote too much time to 1 thing.\n\nThis is a continuation of a debate we had in the calculus section.\n\nWhat kind of student or person would do better. A person with a shallow but broad understanding of life or a field? Or a person witha deep but marrow understanding of life ro a subject?\n\nI say shallow but broad. If you know a little of something about everything there's almost nothing you can't tackle. Learn the basics and you won't need to get to deep into everything. Don't devote too much time to 1 thing.\n\nI would definitely say the person with a narrow, or that of preoccupation. There's really two things that make a good mathematician; attention span and fluid intelligence. Attention span because you need to focus sufficiently to prevent trivial errors which makes solving the problem more tedious, time consuming, and complex...each step matters, in that sense it's exact. Fluid intelligence, because this determines really your potential into how far into the problem you can see. In other words, most people can't advance upon a significant problem while taking a ****.\n\nOne can master calculus in the formal sense, but it's the person who really gets into it that can pioneer the field. In that sense, the superficial understanding of the subject is relatively worthless. Power from mathematics comes from really delving into the subject. Any kind of nobel prize work requires such narrow understanding."
