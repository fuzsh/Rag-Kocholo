        "text": "All applications to the SED Program are assessed by a committee of professors and local secondary teachers in the candidate’s specific subject area department. This subject matter departmental review (SMDR) may include an interview, presentation and/or writing sample. Cal Poly Humboldt also accepts assessment verification from CTC-approved programs on other campuses. The SMDR is distinct from any assessment of subject matter knowledge demonstrated through CSET examination or completion of an education emphasis major.\n\nFor students who are completing their bachelors degree in an approved California Commission on Teacher Credentialing Subject Matter Program at Cal Poly Humboldt, there will not be a separate review by the discipline department. A faculty member from the department will be invited to be on the Secondary Education Program interview panel. At this time questions on subject matter knowledge may be addressed as needed.\n\nFor other students the appropriate discipline department will conduct a review that will be focused on assessing current strengths and weaknesses in subject matter knowledge. This group could include those with an approved program from another university and those who plan to enter the secondary program by passing the appropriate CSET exam.\n\nThis review will focus on subject matter knowledge. Candidates may be asked to present materials and/or evidence of subject matter knowledge, such as by providing a portfolio or other materials relevant to the discipline to support evidence of subject matter knowledge. The review will not include any components of pedagogy. Also, the review will be organized to permit distance candidates to attend without traveling to Cal Poly Humboldt campus. The outcome of the review will be an assessment of the candidate’s current strengths in subject matter knowledge and suggestions for improvement if needed. This assessment will be submitted to the Secondary Education program for their review, and it will be considered in admission decisions.\n\nPlease locate the SMDR committee chair in your subject area, both to introduce yourself and to become fully apprised of the requirements. Assessments are conducted within 3 weeks of the Application Deadline.\n\nDepartment Committee Chairs"
