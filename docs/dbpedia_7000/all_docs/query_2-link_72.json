        "text": "Most scholarly research examines fairly narrow topics and looks at relationships between concepts. For example, cell phones is a pretty broad topic, but looking at the impact of cell phone manufacturing on the environment might be a more manageable topic.\n\nThere are many ways to narrow a topic that is too broad by asking one or more W questions. Let's use cell phones as an example:\n\ncell phones and disposal (what)\n\ncell phones and toxicity (what)\n\ncell phones and interpersonal relationships (what)\n\ncell phones and India (where)\n\ncell phones and corporations (who)\n\ncell phones and teenagers (who) and distracted driving (what)\n\ncell phones and precious metals (what) and Rwanda (where)\n\nUse W questions, to develop a research question on the topic of cell phones:\n\nResearch Question: How can precious metals in cell phones be recycled more effectively?"
