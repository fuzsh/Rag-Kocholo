        "text": "Researching your subject, brainstorming ideas, and sharing your ideas with others are three steps that can help you develop a strong topic.\n\nDo your research\n\nDoing preliminary research will help you to discover what people who work on the topic are interested in or concerned about.\n\nBrainstorm\n\nThere are countless ways to brainstorm ideas for a topic; below are three common approaches.\n\nFreewriting: jot down ideas without revising or proofreading.\n\nQuestioning: write down questions you have about your topic without revising or proofreading.\n\nMapping: starting with a main topic, write down subtopics that come to mind, and drawing links that show how the different subtopics relate.\n\nTalk about your ideas\n\nTalking to others helps you to understand your ideas from a readerâ€™s perspective. It can help you refine the topic or even move in a new direction.\n\nNarrowing your topic makes your work more manageable and your paper more likely to succeed. A good paper takes a smaller portion of a larger issue or problem and investigates that part in depth. Narrowing your topic allows you to choose a problem that is specific enough to research with vigor.\n\nIn our last example, notice that when you begin to narrow a large topic, the initial subtopics that come up are still broad, general ideas. The more you narrow, the more specific your description become. You can use the traditional journalistic questions (Who, What, Where, When, Why) to help you move towards more specific topics."
