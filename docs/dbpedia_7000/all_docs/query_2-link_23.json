        "text": "Brainstorming is the process by which ideas are produced using techniques like concept mapping, free-writing, etc. Choosing a topic can be a difficult process when starting an assignment or writing a paper, and brainstorming can be used to choose a topic or narrow down a broad topic. Narrowing your topic is an important step in the research process. A broad, general topic makes it difficult to find specified research, so narrowing down the topic is needed.\n\nWHAT ARE KEYWORDS?\n\nKeywords are specific words or phrases that relate to your main idea or research question. They are used in brainstorming to determine search terms to use in finding research or narrowing down a topic. Keywords can be specific search words found in your research question, synonyms, phrases, or jargon that are common in the field of study.\n\n3. Using your list of ideas, try to describe Who, What, Where, When, How, and Why about your topic to determine specifics. Do any of these topics sound interesting? Would you be interested in researching them for your assignment?\n\nMeet with a Consultant\n\nHave other questions? Research consultants can help!
