        "text": "3. Narrow Your Topic\n\nOnce you've done some initial background reading, it's time to narrow down your topic to what you really want to write about. Remember your assignment requirements and consider what you've read thus far.\n\nAsk yourself:\n\nWhat aspect of the topic do I want to focus on?\n\nWhat interests me about the topic?\n\nWhat do I want to write about?\n\nAs you start to narrow this down into a thesis, you'll want to continue to look for more sources. As you read, you might tweak or adjust your topic/thesis. In order to help you find more related sources about your topic, you'll want to identify keywords to help you search.\n\nKeywords\n\nAs you think about what concepts you want to write about, think about what particular words might be found in a good article about that topic. For instance, if you are writing about the effects of technology in the classroom. Think of related keywords:\n\nAs you decide what concepts you want to write about, think about what particular words might be found in a good article about that topic. For instance, if you are writing about social media's influence on mood, think about related words that might bring up articles related to the aspects you want to explore.\n\nIt helps to surround search phrases with quotation marks. This lets the computer know you are searching for that specific phrase. For example, you could start with a general search:\n\n\"social media\"\n\nThen, to find more specific information, combine search terms to find specific aspects about social media. Unlike Google, our databases work best when using connector terms, such as andâ€‹ or or. Here are some examples:\n\n\"social media\" and mood\n\n\"social media\" and depression\n\n\"social media\" and anxiety\n\nYou then might decide to look for even more specific information:\n\nInstagram and \"body image\""
