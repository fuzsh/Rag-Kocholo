presented above are a decent starting point for finding a research topic in education, they are fairly generic and non-specific. So, it helps to look at actual dissertations and theses in the education space to see how this all comes together in practice.\n\nBelow, we’ve included a selection of education-related research projects to help refine your thinking. These are actual dissertations and theses, written as part of Master’s and PhD-level programs, so they can provide some useful insight as to what a research topic looks like in practice.\n\nFrom Rural to Urban: Education Conditions of Migrant Children in China (Wang, 2019)\n\nEnergy Renovation While Learning English: A Guidebook for Elementary ESL Teachers (Yang, 2019)\n\nA Reanalyses of Intercorrelational Matrices of Visual and Verbal Learners’ Abilities, Cognitive Styles, and Learning Preferences (Fox, 2020)\n\nA study of the elementary math program utilized by a mid-Missouri school district (Barabas, 2020)\n\nInstructor formative assessment practices in virtual learning environments : a posthumanist sociomaterial perspective (Burcks, 2019)\n\nHigher education students services: a qualitative study of two mid-size universities’ direct exchange programs (Kinde, 2020)\n\nExploring editorial leadership : a qualitative study of scholastic journalism advisers teaching leadership in Missouri secondary schools (Lewis, 2020)\n\nSelling the virtual university: a multimodal discourse analysis of marketing for online learning (Ludwig, 2020)\n\nAdvocacy and accountability in school counselling: assessing the use of data as related to professional self-efficacy (Matthews, 2020)\n\nThe use of an application screening assessment as a predictor of teaching retention at a midwestern, K-12, public school district (Scarbrough, 2020)\n\nCore values driving sustained elite performance cultures (Beiner, 2020)\n\nEducative features of upper elementary Eureka math curriculum (Dwiggins, 2020)\n\nHow female principals nurture adult learning opportunities in successful high schools with challenging student demographics (Woodward, 2020)\n\nThe disproportionality of Black Males in Special Education: A Case Study Analysis of Educator Perceptions in a Southeastern Urban High School (McCrae, 2021)\n\nAs you can see, these research topics are a lot more focused than the generic topic ideas we presented earlier. So, in order for you to develop a high-quality research topic, you’ll need to get specific and laser-focused on a specific context with specific variables of interest. In the video below, we explore some other important things you’ll need to consider when crafting your research topic.\n\nGet 1-On-1 Help\n\nIf you’re still unsure about how to find a quality research topic within education, check out our Research Topic Kickstarter service, which is the perfect starting point for developing a unique, well-justified research topic."
