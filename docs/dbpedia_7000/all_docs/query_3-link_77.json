        "text": "A thesis statement is a sentence (sometimes more than one sentence) in the introduction that tells the reader the following information:\n\nWhat the topic of the paper is\n\nHow the writer intends to discuss that topic\n\nIt gives a blueprint for how the essay will be structured\n\nHow the writer intends to prove or demonstrate his or her main points.\n\nThink of your paper as a human body, and your thesis statement as the spinal cord. Without it, there is no structure.\n\nFor you as the writer, the thesis statement:\n\nDevelops through the interrelationship of thinking, reading, and writing;\n\nLimits your research by providing you with one controlling main idea that intrigues you;\n\nNarrows your writing to one specific claim that you can develop or prove;\n\nOrganizes your ideas so you know the important points you want to make in your paper; and\n\nClarifies your writing by keeping you on target to fulfill your proposed purpose.\n\nFor your readers, the thesis statement:\n\nIdentifies the main point and sub-points of your essay clearly and quickly;\n\nFunctions as a road map so your readers can easily follow your ideas; and\n\nGives satisfaction at the conclusion of the paper when your readers discover you have fulfilled your promise by proving or developing your main point.\n\nAn effective thesis statement must be factual and narrow.\n\n1. Facts\n\nAn effective thesis statement prepares readers for facts and details, but it cannot itself be a fact. It must always be an inference that demands proof or further development. These proofs come from the literature.\n\nUNT Dallas campus has two buildings.\n\nNot factual enough: The UNT Dallas campus is the perfect size.\n\nJust Right: While some might see small universities as a disadvantage, the small campus of UNT Dallas holds many advantages for students, including a close-knit campus community, smaller class sizes, and better support from professors.\n\n2. Narrow Topic\n\nA good thesis should be narrow, and not too broad or too vague. If the topic is too broad, you won’t be able to cover the entire topic in your paper. If it’s too narrow, you might not be able to find research, and your paper probably won’t be long enough.\n\nToo Broad: College students have a lot of responsibilities.\n\nToo Narrow: Student workers in the Learning Commons at UNT Dallas have many responsibilities in their course work and tutoring.\n\nJust Right: College students who are financially independent have many responsibilities as they must maintain good grades, pay living expenses, and balance work and school.\n\nRemember, a thesis statement is not:\n\nA question: Should NASA get more funding?\n\nInstead, you should argue, based on facts and literature, why or why not NASA should receive more funding.\n\nA subjective opinion: Of all flavors, chocolate is the best.\n\nAsk yourself--can I find anything in literature to prove this point, or is this MY opinion?\n\nInstead, you should argue why or why not people like chocolate OR why or why not chocolate is healthy for you based on facts and literature findings.\n\nA religious or political belief: Religion X is better than religion Y. Political party X is better than party Y.\n\nSimilar to the subjective opinion, ask yourself is this statement is based on facts and literature findings or if this is YOUR opinion. Although it is ok to have your own opinion, professors usually do not like to read articles about beliefs (students have been writing about these for years and years).\n\nInstead, you could discuss theories about politics or religions and use literature to prove or disprove those theories.\n\nA statement of fact: The Himalayas were formed from a collision of tectonic plates.\n\nThis is too factual (the Himalayas WERE formed from a collision of tectonic plates), and there is nothing to discuss because this IS a fact in itself.\n\nInstead, you could compare and contrast the tectonic plate formation of different mountains.\n\nA thesis statement for a 5 paragraph essay contains three parts:\n\n1. A Topic: the main idea of the essay\n\n2. The Controlling Idea: what you want to say about the topic\n\n3. The subtopics: usually 3 examples/reasons you will discuss in your paper\n\nHere is an example of a thesis statement.\n\nEx: Regularly visiting the Writing Center at UNT Dallas will help you become the best writer on the planet because it offers superhero tutors, current technology, and fantastic handouts.\n\nThe main topic explores the idea that regularly vsiting the writing center will help you become the best writer on the planet, and the subtopics further expand this opinion with three distinct examples: 1) tutors, 2) technology, and 3) the handouts.\n\nOutline Example\n\nThe paper should be organized around the subtopics. For example, for the thesis written above, the writer would write one body paragraph about the tutors, one about technology, and one about the handouts.\n\nHere is a sample essay outline based on this thesis:\n\nIntroduction (paragraph 1)\n\nIntroduce the topic of tutoring\n\nThesis (last sentence of intro): Regularly visiting the Writing Center at UNT Dallas will help you become the best writer on the planet because it offers superhero tutors, current technology, and fantastic handouts.\n\nBody Paragraphs\n\nParagraph 2: the tutors\n\ntopic sentence\n\nexamples\n\nParagraph 3: technology\n\ntopic sentence\n\nexamples\n\nParagraph 4: the handouts\n\ntopic sentence\n\nexamples\n\nConclusion (paragraph 5)\n\nRestate thesis\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nFor further assistance with the structure, see our handouts on Introductions and Conclusions and Topic Sentences.\n\nA thesis statement for a LONG ESSAY contains two parts:\n\nA Topic: the main idea of the essay\n\nThe Controlling Idea: what you want to say about the topic\n\nThroughout the paper, your thesis promises your readers that you will prove specific facts or develop certain ideas; therefore, every paragraph, sentence, and word in your paper must relate to this controlling idea.\n\nHere are some examples of thesis statements.\n\nBaseball, once a national pastime and even an addiction, has lost its popularity because of the new interest in more violent sports.\n\nSince the space program has yet to provide the American people with any substantial, practical returns, it is a waste of money and should be dissolved.\n\nTo stop the alarming rise in the number of violent crimes committed every year, our courts must hand out tougher sentences.\n\nDetective stories appeal to the basic human desire for thrills.\n\nHemingway's war stories helped to create a new prose style.\n\nBronte utilizes light and fire to symbolize the emotional expressions of the characters.\n\nOutline Example\n\nHere is a suggested outline for a long essay and how that would look in terms of your thesis statement, topic, and controlling ideas:\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduce the novel Jane Eyre and the topic of symbolism\n\nThesis (last sentence of intro): Bronte utilizes light and fire to symbolize the emotional expressions of the characters.\n\nBody Paragraphs\n\nFor each paragraph, discuss a different symbolism example\n\ntopic sentence\n\ntextual examples and elaboration\n\nConclusion\n\nRestate thesis\n\nConcluding remarks"
