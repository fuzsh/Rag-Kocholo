An educational and interactive workshop that helps youth and their parents recognize and develop strategies to avoid making choices they will later regret, strengthen their decision-making skills and improve communications. The attendees also learn The 40-Development Assets which promote healthy, caring and responsible members of society.

These workshops are conducted for school-aged youth and their parents, and they are usually court-referred by Montgomery County Judges.
