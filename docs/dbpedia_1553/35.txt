Cozy has such a nice, lovely songs through his career. He was the most successful drummer in making solo albums (at the time of course). Plus his over the top guests in all his albums.

So here are my top 10 Cozy Powell solo songs:

10. Ride To Win from The Drums Are Back.

《Brian May's guitar + Don Airey's keys = Exciting.》

9. Formula One from Octopuss.

《With Gary Moore's guitar... all is better.》

8. Hot Rock from Tilt

《When The Bros reunited... yes Jeff Beck is playing here. An great great great song!》

7. Princetown from Octopuss

《Nice-powerfull song with a great guitar work courtesy of Mel Galley.》

6. Cat Moves from Tilt

《The Bros again... Jeff Beck's playing here is totally great! The song is kinda repetitive but is worth listening to it to the end. Also... Jack Bruce bassline.》

5. The Loner from Over The Top

《Well, this song is like his signature. You say The Loner and everyone thinks Cozy Powell (or maybe Gary Moore) but in the end is the same. It's a nice, lovely instrumental written by Max Middleton and dedicated to Jeff Beck but... we all know who really is The Loner here.》

4 The Right Side from Tilt

《I personally love this song and the lyrics are lovely! And is such a dynamic song and... that saxophone...》

3 Heidi Goes To Town from Over The Top

《One word: Bass... Jack Bruce's bassline is is... i mean... just play it at my funeral.》

2. The Rattler form Octopuss

《Powerful... just powerful... it's super exciting it's like a trip in a 180 mph car. And don't forget the Jon Lord's organ at the end...》

1. Over The Top from Over The Top

《Well well WELL... This song IS Cozy Powell himself. I put it in the 1st place not for the arrangements but the solo at the of the song. It's like... Cozy's drumming is not Cozy's drumming without 1812 overture. You house starts shaking by the sound of his power it's like an elephant stampede. Cozy is over the top.》
