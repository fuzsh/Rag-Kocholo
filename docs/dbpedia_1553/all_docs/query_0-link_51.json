Sebastian\n\n04.12.2007 15:17 Roger's a great drummer. But Cozy was a hell of a lot better. Micrówave\n\n04.12.2007 15:36 I would venture to say that this forum may not be the best judge of this argument, primarily because 90% of the posters will think that Cozy was simply the drummer in Brian May's band.\n\nAnd so for the sake of that, I'll give a strong edge to ROGER TAYLOR vs Cozy's BM Band tenure:\n\nCozy + Brian = 2 much Hi Hat.\n\nOne of the reasons Another World is my favorite song of Brian's solo is the drumming. una999\n\n04.12.2007 16:24\n\nmatlin wrote: Since my Roger vs Phil Collins Topic I was lisning to the Brian May Band and i rememberd how good cozy was.He made Queen songs a lot faster but who do you think was best.Also do you think that he would have gone on the Queen & Paul Rodgers tour like Jamie Moses did..\n\n??? Cozy obviously had to be good to be a seasoned drummer for acts, whereas Roger didn't need to be that good cos the others could carry him.\n\nWho's better?? coops\n\n04.12.2007 18:15 I remember listening to Cozy before Queen made it big. I don't know what criteria to use to make the decision about one drummer being better than the other, particularly between these two. thunderbolt 31742\n\n05.12.2007 03:07 Roger is a very solid drummer who has a range of styles pretty well figured-out. Cozy was more of a power drummer, but he was a GREAT power drummer. I'd put them both among the best, but trying to rank one above the other is impossible for me, because it's comparing apples to oranges. Raf\n\n05.12.2007 05:22 I don't know much about the drums, but I always have the impression Cozy is a lot more technical than Roger, while on the other hand, Roger has his very own unique style (from what Brian and Roger himself said on the Making of ANATO, on the bonus features, I was under the impression that Roger's drum sounds is just as unique and recognizable for other drummers as Brian's guitar sound for guitarists - but I don't know much about the drums...), so to me, comparing those two would be like trying to compare Brian May and, uh, guitar shredders in general. cmsdrums\n\n05.12.2007 08:14 I've got no qualms with how Cozy played the Queen stuff, but I've never been a great fan of his actual sound, which is quite dead and thick, due partly to huge sticks and thick skins.\n\nI prefer Roger's sound and touch on the Queen tracks, but do like Cozy as a player.\n\nIt is very interesting as to whether, if Cozy hadn't died, whether Brian would ever have played again at any great length with Roger. I know that Cozy wasn't just Brian's drummer, but was a close friend, and sounding board for his new songs, and co-collaborator in many ways. If he had lived, my own thought is that Brian MAY possibly have continued live and stuido work with Cozy as his preferred drummer of choice, and only dabbled with back catalogue stuff and maybe the odd guest appearance with Roger. Benn\n\n05.12.2007 10:12 Cozy was more of an innovater on the drums - in the same way that both Keith Moon and John Bonham were.\n\nRoger is a time-keeper in the same way that Kenney Jones and Phil Colins are. una999\n\n05.12.2007 14:11\n\ncmsdrums wrote: I've ot no qualms with how Cozy played the Queen stuff, but I've never been a great fan of his actual sound, which is quick dead and thick, due partly to huge sticks and thick skins.

The reason why Roger didn't drum on Brian's solo album and Brian wasn't Roger's guitarist in The Cross is to establish a little identity, outside of Queen.\n\nOtherwise, the Brian + Roger is not Queen arguments would've started early in 1992.\n\nNow John? I don't think they speak too often anymore. Danne\n\n08.12.2007 09:56\n\nBenn wrote: Cozy was more of an innovater on the drums - in the same way that both Keith Moon and John Bonham were.
