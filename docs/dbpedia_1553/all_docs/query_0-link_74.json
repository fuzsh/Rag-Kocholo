It’s home to some of the city’s most charming neighborhoods, including St. Johns, Mississippi, Williams and Kenton.\n\nNorthwest Portland\n\nNorthwest Portland stretches from Forest Park in the west to the Willamette River at the east, encompassing the central city’s Old Town Chinatown and Pearl District, Northwest/Nob Hill, Slabtown and miles of wooded hillsides. Its west side is forested and serene; its east side is urban and lively, a vital part of the central city.\n\nNortheast Portland\n\nFor shows, sports and big events, Northeast Portland is hard to beat. In addition to being home to the Moda Center and the Oregon Convention Center, Portland’s largest quadrant boasts striking architecture, historic theaters, a variety of public golf courses and other attractions. You’ll also find numerous colorful neighborhoods, including the Alberta Arts District, Hollywood, Lloyd and many more.\n\nSouthwest and South Portland\n\nBest known for lively downtown Portland — the compact, walkable heart of the City of Roses — Southwest Portland is also home to Washington Park’s numerous attractions, Goose Hollow’s blend of historic and modern, the small-town charm of Multnomah Village and more.
