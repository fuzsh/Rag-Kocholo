        "text": "Got to meet him twice. He was fantastic. Even remembered the first time we had met.\n\nFun facts:\n\nHe played rimshots most of time, including his toms.\n\nOnly drummer considered to replace Bonham, stuck around enough to play on Plant solo album.\n\nAlmost never rode on a tour bus, would drive or ride a motorcycle between gigs (very fast).\n\nCouldn’t read music and didn’t know any rudiments, but performed them quite well.\n\nAgree with Cozy being a great drummer, but not sure about him being the only LZ possible candidate. I recall reading somewhere that Plant and Page were considering bringing over Tony Thompson at one point, but that got shelved when he was injured in a car accident and was out of commission for a while.\n\nAgree with Cozy being a great drummer, but not sure about him being the only LZ possible candidate. I recall reading somewhere that Plant and Page were considering bringing over Tony Thompson at one point, but that got shelved when he was injured in a car accident and was out of commission for a while.\n\nTrue, but I believe that was around Live Aid. Cozy was local and available the period in-between Bonham's death and when the band broke up.\n\nGreat, powerful rock drummer. I must admit I am not familiar with his full body of work, but like someone else stated earlier on in this thread, I do remember the ELP record he was on, and I work the album out - it was fantastic.\n\nTrue, but I believe that was around Live Aid. Cozy was local and available the period in-between Bonham's death and when the band broke up.\n\nAlso, Live Aid was 5 years after the death of Bonham and Tony Thompson was still playing on Disco hits at the time. The Live Aid debacle was the death knell to that thought, if it actually ever was one in the first place.\n\nI wasn't necessarily into the kinds of bands he was playing with, but I always liked his playing. I was a huge Phil Collins fan when Pictures at Eleven came out, but really dug Cozy's playing on the tracks that he's on.\n\nAlways enjoyed the two clips below from British TV. One was a children's television show, and the other a world record breaker contest. He seemed like a good dude (even took a pie to the face at the end of the kid's show). He was also rumored to be a \"ghost drummer\" on many 80's spandex/hair metal records. Some of those drummers could cut it live, but not in the studio in the pre-pro-tools day. NDAs probably prevent most of the disclosures, but I recall Fred Coury from Cinderella admitted to Modern Drummer that it was Cozy on the first two albums even though he was credited. Fred said he was finally click/studio ready by the third album.\n\nI just moved to a new town, and I signed up for this neighborhood/community website called nextdoor.com. They have classifieds, and this is the first listing I saw! Only $125 bucks and you can own one of his road cases.\n\nAttachments\n\n20D2BCCB-00F6-4743-B00C-BD002AE23F8D.png\n\nPhenomenal drummer! Top 2 or 3 spot of Hard Rock Drummers in many circles. Could adeptly get power from both matched or trad grip, and swung his grooves hard. A live concert show unto himself in his solos. He used Symphonic playback, audience participation and pyrotechnics that always brought the house down. First time seeing him in 1975 with Rainbow, I left that theater with my jaw on the floor. I seriously only saw John Bonham as a better hard rock drummer, though some place Paice in the mix as well.\n\nI got to see the ELP tour with Powell, and he was fantastic. He hit hard. When they did the song 'From the Beginning', he strode out to the front of the stage where a pair of congas rose out of nowhere.\n\nAlso, before the show started, the house lights were up, and there was a large curtain hiding the stage. I was talking to my friends, enjoying that pre-show, electric atmosphere. A frisbee sailed out from behind the curtain in a slow graceful arc, and came down perfectly into my raised hand. One of those weird things."
