        "text": "“Piano in the Dark” is a song by the American singer-songwriter Brenda Russell (featuring backing vocals by Joe Esposito). It was the first single to be taken from Russell’s 1988 album, Get Here.\n\nInitially “Gravity” was planned to be released as the first single, however Herb Alpert pushed to have “Piano” released instead feeling that it better represented her as an artist.\n\n“Piano in the Dark” was released in early 1988, nine years after Russell’s previous charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 (1979’s “So Good, So Right”). The song gained heavy airplay and became Russell’s biggest hit, peaking at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 8 on the R&B Chart and number 3 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. The song was also a moderate hit in the UK, peaking at 23. The song earned Russell two Grammy Award nominations in 1989, including one for Song of the Year."
