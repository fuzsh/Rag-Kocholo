The single, \"So Good So Right\", reached Nos. 8, 15 and 30 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary, Hot Soul Songs and Hot 100 charts, respectively.[8][9][10]\n\nThe track, \"\"Think It Over\", written by Russell with her then-husband Brian, was previously recorded by Charlie's Angels star Cheryl Ladd, who would go on to marry Brian following the latter's divorce from Brenda.\n\nSampling and Covers\n\n[edit]\n\nLuther Vandross did a cover of \"If Only For One Night\" on his 1985 album The Night I Fell In Love, and then in 2006, singer Janet Jackson sampled \"If Only For One Night\" in her song \"Do It 2 Me\" off the album 20 Y.O.. In 1998, American rapper Big Pun sampled \"A Little Bit of Love\" on his hit single \"Still Not a Player\". In 2003, Mexican singer Thalía sampled the song in \"I Want You\", and in 2013 Ariana Grande and Mac Miller sampled the same song for their Top 10 hit single, \"The Way\". In 2001, singer Mary J. Blige sampled \"God Bless You\" in her song \"Flying Away\".\n\nIn 2000, the album was re-released on CD with new cover artwork and included Russell's most well known hit \"Piano in the Dark\" from 1988 as a bonus track.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\n\"So Good, So Right\" - 3:20\n\n\"In the Thick of It\" - 3:56\n\n\"If Only for One Night\" - 4:13\n\n\"Way Back When\" - 4:23\n\n\"A Little Bit of Love\" - 4:41\n\n\"You're Free\" – 3:30\n\n\"Think It Over\" - 5:17\n\n\"God Bless You\" - 4:48\n\nAll tracks composed by Brenda Russell, except:\n\n\"You're Free\" (lyrics: Brenda Russell, music: Andre Fischer, Brenda Russell)\n\n\"Think It Over\" (lyrics: Brenda Russell, music: Brian Russell, Brenda Russell).\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nBrenda Russell – lead vocals, backing vocals (1-7), acoustic piano (1, 2, 3, 5), Wurlitzer electric piano (4, 7), Fender Rhodes (5), horn arrangement (5), rhythm arrangements, vocal arrangements\n\nRon Stockert – Fender Rhodes (1, 3, 4, 7, 8), acoustic piano (4, 8), clavinet (5)\n\nIan Underwood – synthesizers (2, 4)\n\nClare Fischer – string arrangements (3, 8), organ (4, 7), concertmaster (6), electric guitar (7)\n\nDavid Wolfert – electric guitar (1, 7), horn arrangements (1), string arrangements (1, 7)\n\nFred Tackett – electric guitar (1, 6), acoustic guitar (2)\n\nGeorge Sopuch – electric guitar (1, 2, 6), guitar solo (6)\n\nEd Brown – bass\n\nAndre Fischer – drums, rhythm arrangements\n\nVictor Feldman – percussion (2, 4), vibraphone (5)\n\nHenry Gibson – percussion (2)\n\nHector Andrade – timbales (5)\n\nTom Saviano – soprano saxophone (1)\n\nDoug Richardson – tenor saxophone (2, 8)\n\nLarry Williams – baritone saxophone (5), alto flute (5, 6)\n\nBill Reichenbach Jr. - baritone (5), bass trombone (5), horn arrangements (5)\n\nJudd Miller – trumpet (1)\n\nSteve Madaio – trumpet (1), flugelhorn (1)\n\nChuck Findley – flugelhorn (5, 6), piccolo trumpet (5)\n\nJerry Hey – trumpet (5)\n\nGary Herbig – English horn (6)\n\nDavid McKelvy – harmonica (7)\n\nJerry Peters – string arrangements (4, 6), horn arrangements (6)\n\nHarry Bluestone – concertmaster (1, 7)\n\nGerald Vinci – concertmaster (3, 8)\n\nAssa Drori – concertmaster (4)\n\nDoublerock Baptist Junior Choir – backing vocals (5)\n\nMichele Aller – backing vocals (5, 7, 8)\n\nSusaye Greene – backing vocals (5, 7, 8)\n\nElaine Hill – backing vocals (5, 7, 8)\n\nJoe Esposito – backing vocals (7)\n\nEddie Hokenson – backing vocals (7)\n\nArnold McCuller – backing vocals (7)\n\nPetsye Powell – backing vocals (7)\n\nBruce Sudano – backing vocals (7)\n\nKathy Collier – backing vocals (8)\n\nVenette Gloud – backing vocals (8)\n\nCarmen Twillie – backing vocals (8)\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nProducer – Andre Fischer\n\nAssociate Producer – Brenda Dash\n\nRecorded by John Rhys\n\nMixed by Al Schmitt\n\nMix Assistants – Don Henderson, Murray McFadden, Phil Moores and Terry More.\n\nMastered by Mike Reese at The Mastering Lab (Los Angeles, CA).\n\nArt Direction – Roland Young\n\nDesign – Amy Nagasawa\n\nPhotography – Claude Mougin\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbum\n\nChart (1979) Peak\n\nposition US Billboard 200 65 US R&B Chart 26\n\nSingles\n\nYear Single Chart Position 1979 \"So Good, So Right\" US Billboard Hot 100[11] 30 1980 \"So Good, So Right\" /\n\n\"In the Thick of It\" UK Singles Chart[12] 51"
