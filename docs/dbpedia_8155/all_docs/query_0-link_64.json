Russell’s rich lead vocals command the background singers and children’s choir, backed by hand percussion and tribal flute flourishes. The song, and arrangement especially, sounds dated, as if it could share a release date with the 1985 Michael Jackson song for Africa. However, the sincerity is welcome when it comes to songs for unity. A forthcoming solo album will make for a great capstone."
