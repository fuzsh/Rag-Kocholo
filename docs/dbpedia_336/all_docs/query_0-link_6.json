WIBZ's selection had nothing to do with WBZ - everyone thought they just sounded good. Same with WADC. It was bought up at that meeting that there had been a station in Akron with the same calls which used the slogan \"Where Advertising Dollars Count\". Don West thought that was really neat. If there was a connection to another station it was WADC in Akron, not WABC.\" However, Andy Blatt writes, \"I know WADC was programmed to sound like WABC. They used the same jingle company, same format, one of ABC's news formats, and stressed the same approach.\"\n\nWCAW -- This page previously indicated that the call stood for \"country and western\", However, Mack Miles writes: My dad, Paul Miles, ran WCAW and Capitol Broadcasting Corp. from 1959 until the late 80's or so. WCAW didn't program country music until around 1966, so it was just luck that CAW stood for Country and Western. I believe that the name came from a tie-in with their on-air mascot \"Matey\" the crow or \"Matey 680\". Matey the crow would say \"caw, caw!\" They even had a crow living in the studio for years and my dad used it as the logo. Our cars all had WCAW and the Matey painted on them for years. In 2004, Bob Moore wrote: Bill Stone told me he was formerly an original partner in Capitol Broadcasting, owner of WCAW and it originally stood for 'Charleston and West Virginia'. The bird of course, which came later only added to the station's stature. In a 2009 email, Chambers Williams wrote: I learned all about radio hanging out at WCAW in Kanawha City as a teenager, and spent many hours there on the weekend doing work for them for free just to learn the business. They told me then that the call letters were a combination of Charleston and West Virginia, and that someone realized later on that the \"CAW\" was the sound a crow makes, so they created \"Matey the Crow\" as the station mascot. They got a real crow -- and it sat in a cage in a corner of the control room. Ed Rabel was there for a while when I was hanging out at WCAW.\n\nWCFC -- A 1947 newspaper article stated: The letters were selected first for ease in pronunciation, understandibility, and in being remembered. Several slogans were selected which fit the call letters WCFC. West Virginia's Cleanest and Finest City or, for use during the summer months, West Virginia's Coolest and Finest City; and WCFC, the World's Cleanest and Finest Coal, describing the famous smokeless coal for which the Beckley area is famous. Other call letter combinations were considered. One of them was WVSC for West Virginia Smokeless Coal but this was not available. The firm also sought a combination of letters which would fit the two newspapers it publishes but nothing satisfactory could be found.\n\nWCIR -- The original owner, Thomas Waldron, told me that WCIR could be interpreted as either \"Christianity in radio\" or \"Christ is risen.\" The station originally carried Christian programming in the midddays and all day on Sundays.\n\nWCKV -- This page previously stated that WCKV stood for Ceredo-Kenova Video. However, Vernon Stanfill, general manager and chief engineer of WFGH writes, \"Here is a correction. There wasa business Ceredo-Kenova Video, BUT they were not an over-the-air entity. WCKV stood for Wayne, Ceredo-Kenova, Vinson -- three high schools in northern Wayne County. The station was to be affiliated with WFGH at Fort Gay and was actually given a Construction Permit with the WCKV call but it never got on the air because there was no money for equipment.\"\n\nWCOZ -- Chris Johnson, former General Manager of WKLC Rock 105 and WCOZ 1300AM writes, \"The WCOZ call letters were parked on AM 1300 by the current owner Lynn Martin. Originally it stood for \"COZY\" and used in conjunction with an easy listening format that Lynn had on one of his stations in the Lexington KY market. When he changed the format on the Lexington station to adult contemporary he moved the WCOZ call to the St. Albans station. At the time, it was programmed with as a 100% simulcast of WKLC/ROCK 105 (105.1 FM, St. Albans). This was done so that the company could keep the WCOZ call letters as he felt they had value in the general radio marketplace. However, in doing so, he gave up WKAZ, which had been on the AM 1300 since Bristol Broadcasting gave them up for WQBE. In the long run, WCOZ was of no value because the easy listening formats are long gone. The WKAZ callsign was immediately taken by West Virginia Radio Corporation and put on their oldies station in Charleston. The WKAZ calls, because of their heritage in the market, proved to be much more valuable.\"\n\nWGYA -- WGYA was the original call for WVOW Logan when it had a construction permit in 1950. I do not know whether the call was ever used.\n\nWHAW -- The original owner was the Lewis Service Corporation, whose pricipal was Harold A. McWhorter. Harold established WPAR Parkersburg in 1935 and WHAW Weston in 1948. Harold wanted his inititals as the call letters, WHAM, but Stromberg-Carlson had those on AM 1180 in Rochester NY. He chose WHAW, telling some they stood for \"Harold and (his wife) Wilda,\" others that he had just turned over the \"M\" in McWhorter.\n\nWHLX -- Chris Carmichael wrote in 2011: The WHLX call letters were for WHLL. WHLX's owner Neal Fondas was the sales manager for WHLL. When he launched WHLX, he had wanted the WHLL calls, but they were unavailable. I worked for Neal from 1991 until the station was sold to Osborne Communications in 1996. Mr. Fondas passed away from lung cance, the same day that Rex Osborne took over.\n\nWITB -- A reader of ths page writes, \"My roommate at Salem College was our school's radio station manager. The station was located in the basement of the administration building, so \"We're In The Basement\"\n\nWKMM -- This page previously stated that WKMM stood for \"Kingwood Mountain Music.\" However, in May 2004 Mike Graham wrote, \"I can tell you, as the first official advertising sales person at WKMM, back in the days before the the soundproofing was done in the studio in the original building (and, also being the brother-in-law of the original owners son), WKMM does not stand for Kingwood Mountain Music. During a discussion in the early days with Sandy Garlitz (the original owner), I had asked if the call letters had any special meaning and she told me no, the original call letters she wanted were WMAX (her husband's first name). WKMM were actually at the time the only call letters available that she liked. At that point, my mother (the station's first news director), Sandy, Greg Bolyard (the station's original morning DJ) and I spent about an hour coming up with phrases created from the call letters. The favorite at the time was We're Kingwood's Music Maker.\"\n\nWMOD -- John M. Taylor, whose father Jake Taylor who owned WMOD around the early to mid 1950's, writes, \"The call letters were aired under the phrase 'Worth More On Daytime radio,' to emphasize both the call letters, and the radio station's marketing for Daytime Radio Advertising.\" I suspect this is a slogan later adopted to match the call letters, and that the call letters perhaps could have been an abbreviation for \"Moundsville\" or \"Modern.\"\n\nWRNR -- In 2007, Albert McGilvray, the WRNR news director wrote, When WRNR-AM went on the air 31 years ago, the call letters stood for We (are) Rock 'n Roll. With the advent of FM, AM 740 began a gradual shift to the news/talk format. We are not related in any way to WRNR-FM in Annapolis, MD.\n\nWTCR -- Judy Jennings of WTCR writes, \"WTCR call letters actually stood for Town and Country Radio, originated by the owner Connie B. Gay, an orginal founding member of the Country Music Association and the Country Music Hall of Fame. Connie was instrmental in bringing the \"pop\" crossover sound to country radio and he wanted to convey the music was for the town and the country audience. In the more recent decade, we began to use Tri-State's Country Radio.\n\nWXCC -- Harold Cremeans, former engineer and builder of the station, writes that WXCC was one of ten calls that became available early in 1977. The calls were retired Navy ship calls from the 1940s. He writes, \"Not realizing what a jewel he had, owner Robert 'Bob' Harvit always regretted not registering the slogan 'Coal Country.' It was too expensive!\"\n\nReturn to front page"
