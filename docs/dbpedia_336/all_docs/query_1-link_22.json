        "text": "9/11 memorials were held across the Ohio Valley to remember the fallen. In Wheeling, the Ohio Valley 9/11 Memorial held a tribute concert at WesBanco Arena.\n\nThis is the third time for the concert. The first was held on the fifth anniversary and the second on the10th anniversary. For the 15th anniversary, they joined together in prayer and song to remember and honor the lives lost that day.\n\n\"The EMS, fire department, police, first responders, it’s for them really but it’s mainly for everyone in the Ohio Valley, but those in particular are the ones we want to remember,” said Phil Wallace, Ohio Valley 9/11 Memorial.\n\nFirst responders from across the area were honored in the concert at WesBanco. Upon arrival, they were greeted by a flag line from the West Virginia Patriot Guard.\n\n\"We want to be there for the fallen. We want to be there to support the families and let them know there are people who do care and understand their sacrifice,\" said Ron Jones, WVPG.\n\nSome in the crowd experienced the sacrifice first hand. Guest speaker and Washington, D.C. Fire Chief Victor Ceglie's battalion was one of the first on scene to the Pentagon that day.\n\n\"We couldn't believe it happened. We were watching the news when it hit and we knew something was going wrong so we knew we could probably get hit. Once the Pentagon did get hit we were called immediately to help,” Ceglie said.\n\nInside, musical acts like the Joseph Sisters and the Pitts Sisters filled the arena to recognize the historic day.\n\n\"We wanted to have youth here because most of them were not born at that time, so we wanted them to hear music that would help them remember what happened,” Wallace said.\n\n“So we can’t forget exactly what happened that day and how many lives it affected: firefighters, EMS, police, everyone involved, how it affected all their lives,” Ceglie said.\n\nThe Ohio Valley 9/11 Memorial plans to continue the concert every five years."
