        "text": "Radio IQ and WVTF Music will debut an exciting new slate of program offerings starting Monday August 17. The five new programs – which will include two of NPR’s most popular programs - will expand the diversity of ideas and voices over WVTF's 2 programming streams and 25 frequencies.\n\nEarlier this year program distributors announced the end of Live From Here (the program that replaced A Prairie Home Companion) and changes coming to On Point (shortening to one hour, weekdays). These changes created an opportunity to review our program schedule.\n\nThe new programs on Radio IQ will help re-define our weekend sound with the addition of It’s Been A Minute with host Sam Sanders (Saturdays at noon) and Hidden Brain with Shankar Vedantam (Sundays at 1 pm). Also new to the schedule is the award-winning regional news program, Inside Appalachia produced by our neighbors at West Virginia Public Broadcasting (WVPB) and distributed by NPR. Finally, replacing Live From Here (on WVTF Music) will be the return of Mountain Stage – also presented by WVPB and distributed by NPR. Performance Today Weekend will also join the lineup (Sundays from 5-7 pm).\n\nIn order to make room for these new programs some of the existing programs have new times. Our new programming grid with highlighted changes is available here.\n\nAs always, we’re interested in your feedback – drop us an email at wvtf@vt.edu.\n\nThank you for Listening,\n\nRoger Duvall\n\nGeneral Manager, WVTF Public Radio"
