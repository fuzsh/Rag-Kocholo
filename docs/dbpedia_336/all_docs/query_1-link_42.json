SAMUEL BAGSTER AND SONS, AT THE WAREHOUSE FOR BIBLES, NEW TESTAMENTS, PRAYER BOOKS, LEXICONS, CONCORDANCES, GRAMMARS, AND PSALTERS, IN ANCIENT AND MODERN LANGUAGES. T •\"■ 4*** PUBLISHERS' PREFACE. The instruction of a competent living Teacher is doubtless the most efficient means of acquiring any Language. Supplied with such help, the Student requires little more than the subject at heart, attention, and perseverance. And there cannot be said to be any lack of Teachers of the Hebrew Language in England ; for, besides the Universities and Colleges with their qualified Tutors, there are numerous private teachers of sufficient ability. Suitable Books too are abundant and accessible. A practical difficulty, however, remains : Students can rarely secure the advantage of oral instruction long enough to obtain a complete knowledge of Hebrew; and those especially who seek to qualify them- selves for the Ministry of the Word of God, too frequently find their College Terms expire without their having attained proficiency : for, unlike the Classics, the Hebrew language is ordinarily taken up during the busiest period of life. It is for such, and for the numerous class of private persons who are anxious to complete and preserve their acquaintance with the Original of the Sacred Oracles, that this Work has been executed. The knowledge of Hebrew is a branch of Education of the highest importance, and it is now attracting the attention it deserves. Public, and the more respectable private Schools, are generally acknowledging its theological value, and are introducing its study. PUBLISHEKS' PREFACE. Notwithstanding, however, the growing desire for the acquisition of the Hebrew Language, and the increasing number of Students, there are in proportion but very few who derive real benefit from their exertions. The present Work aims at the removal of the cause of this general failure in the study of Hebrew. Believing that the real cause of this want of correspondence between effort and result consists in the uncertainty experienced by most of those who pursue the study alone, we have here prepared, in the concisest and most accessible form, a Lexicon of analysed foems, which will supply the inquiring Student with information at every step of his progress, and thus, while he is practising the language, save his valuable time, and encourage him to proceed by the certainty it will impart to all his researches. This important Work occupied upwards of seven years of unremitting labour perseveringly bestowed upon its preparation and execution ; and it is incumbent on the Publishers to acknowledge their obligation to the learned Author, for his unwearied and self-denying assiduity in connection with the Work during so protracted a period. It is hardly necessary to state that the materials thus gathered at so much cost have received all the attention and care it was possible to bestow upon the typography. London: 15, Paternoster Row.

THE OBJECT AND PLAN OF THE ANALYTICAL HEBREW AND CHALDEE LEXICON. From what has been briefly stated in the Preface, it will sufficiently appear that this Work is intended, not so much to teach the first principles of Hebrew Grammar, as to provide the Student who has already begun to read a little (ever so little) with the means of making speedy and sure after progress. Its object is to assist him in his practice of the Sacred Text, by enabling him to apply the Eules he has learned, and may be learning ; and, by supplying him with the Analysis of every single word in the entire language, under every form it can assume, it promises him exemp- tion from the tedium and disappointment of uncertainty in his investigations. Experience has shown that multitudes of Hebrew students, after having overcome the first difficulties under the instruction of a living Teacher, abandon further study for lack of a Guide through the yet untrodden intricacies of the Language. Our aim has been to provide a permanent Instructor, to succeed the living Teacher in his function of solving the difficulties of the inquiring Student ; and we have endeavoured neither to mislead by imperfect information, nor to disappoint by suppressing the explanation of apparently trifling matters. As an Analytical Lexicon, this work embraces especially the Etymology and Signifi- cation of Words. The following summary will exhibit the mode of treatment adopted : — The Etymology op Words. I. The entire body of Words, contained in the Hebrew Scriptures, exactly as they are found in the Text, have been thrown into Alphabetical order ; so that each, accompanied by its THE OBJECT AND PLAN. prefixes, suffixes, and under every modification of form, may be immediately found by an alphabetical reference. II. Each word thus arranged is concisely and fully parsed, its composition is explained, and its simple form and root given. III. Whenever the form of the word analysed agrees with the Tables of Paradigms, a plain but full statement of the nature of the word has been considered sufficient ; but where any peculiar difficulty or irregularity exists, reference has also been made to the section of the Grammatical Introduction in which the deviation is explained. IV. To provide standards of inflexion and comparison, a complete series of Paradigms of the Verbs, Pronouns, and Nouns, of both the Hebrew and Chaldee languages, has been prepared. V. These Tables are accompanied with Explanations and Bemarks, which account for every deviation from the Tables, and comprise a collection of evert single exceptional CASE. In the body of the work, these Explanations are indicated by reference to their number. VI. Every form that happens to occur but once in the Bible has its reference to the passage given at the foot of the page. To this we have attended in the minutest difference of the forms, in order to increase the references, so valuable to the begimier who has no Concordance. \"When, however, the form is especially peculiar, more than one reference is given. %* It is an interesting and important fact, that this collection of citations constitutes a Concordance of more than three-fourths of the forms of the Language. VII. The place of the Accent is throughout indicated by a perpendicular line ( , ) under the tone- syllable, except when the form is affected by a pausal accent, where (\\) is used to indicate the tone-syllable ; while the absence of pausal accent and influence are marked with (,). VIII. Kamets Hhattuph (o) is distinguished from the long Kamets (a) by this sign (@). But this is used only in the forms analysed, in the leading forms of the derivatives under their respective roots, and in those forms where its use requires particular notice. The Signification or Lexicography of Words. IX. A full explanation of the various meanings of the words will be found under their respective Roots, in their alphabetical place. THE OBJECT AND PLAN. X. In preparing the Lexicography, Gesenius has been chiefly relied on for definitions ; but the works of Dr. Lee, Winer, Biesenthal, Flirst, and others, have been compared throughout. XL In addition to the various significations of each root, a Synoptical List of all the words derived from each is given, to aid the student in remembering the connection between the root and its derivatives.

[Sect. II. SECTION L— THE SEPARATE PRONOUN. (Table A). REMARKS. 1 . First Person Singular. *?3N is the ancient and full form, of which. *JK. is an abbreviation, and from the latter are formed the suffixes attached to nouns, verbs, &c. 2. Second Person Singular. Instead of Dagesh forte in nm, %$ (pi. &$K), the kindred dialects have 3 before T\\ (Chald. & Arab. fl|&?), which, however, is not the original form, but T) alone is the characteristic consonant*4 fiK without H occurs only in 1 Sa. 24. 19 ; Ps. 6. 4 ; Job 1.10; Ec. 7. 22 ; Ne. 9. 6 ; it is, however, in each place corrected in the Keri. The feminine form \"m in Ju. 17.2; 1 Ki. 14.2; 2Ki. 4. 16,23; 8. 1; Je. 4. 30 ; Eze. 36. 13, was originally pronounced 'AN (with the feminine designation *t, probably from K*n sAe, properly ^ow she, comp. vPpl?) as in the Syriac and the vulgar Arabic. The pointing with Sheva is agreeably to the Keri $&?, because the Jewish critics, as it appears, did not recognise the form *&$. The same final * appears likewise in the unfrequent form of the suffix *?— , *?Vr. 3. 7%&W Person Singular. The masculine WPI is of common gender in the Pentateuch, and signifies also she (which is expressed by ton only eleven times, viz., Ge. 14.2; 20.5; 38.25; Le. 2. 15; 11.39; 13. 10,21; 16.31 ; 21.9; Nu. 5. 13). The punctuators, however, either from want of appreciating such an idiom, or for the sake of distinction, whenever XI H stands in the text for ton, give it the appropriate pointing of this form, (X1H), and require it to be read fcOfl. It is, however, to be sounded rather according to the old form K-1H. Besides the Pentateuch, XI H occurs also in 1 Ki. 17.15; Job 31. 11 ; Is. 30. 33. 4. First Person Plural. •I^C^X is manifestly the plural of *?JK, with the exchange of 3 for n, as -1JX is of ^X. The form -13X, from which the suffixes (-12, -13—, -13— ) are derived, is found only in Je. 42. 6, Khethib. The Masorites, however, did not recognize so unusual a form, and instead of it put -I^K., which, indeed, some MSS. and editions have even as the reading of the text itself. Nevertheless, -WK. appears also in the Rab- binical. The abbreviated form -131^ is found only six times, viz., Ge. 42. 11 ; Ex. 16. 7, 8 ; Nu. 32. 32; 2Sa. 17. 12; La. 3. 42. 5. Second Person Plural. DFltf & JfiX are blunted forms of B-lfiX (Arab, antum, Chald. PfiX, a form which lies at the foundation of some verbal inflexions, comp. the preterite with suffix), and |^X, the full final vowel giving place to the obtuse sound of e, somewhat in the manner of the third person (QD). \\B$ is found only once, Eze. 34. 31 (where another reading is jflK) ; and H^H (for which some MSS. have also n|JW) occurs only in Ge. 31.6; Eze. 13. 11,20; 34.17. 6. Third Person Plural. EH & ][} are got from X-1H and X*f1 in the same manner as Q^X from HJRX. The H— in both forms (H paragogic) has a demonstrative force. SECTION II.— THE VERBAL SUFFIX, t (Table A). REMARKS. 1 . First Person Singular Has this peculiarity, that the union vowel of the form *?— is invariably Pattah, though in an open syllable we expect Kamets, as in -13~, •1^~; but this Kamets is found only in pause, e. g. Ex. 5. 22. For *)— , the full form W~ is found with the^^. in 1 Ki. 2. 24, Kheth. For *|t see Ps. 118. 18 ; Ge. 30. 6 ; with the Jut. Job 7. 14 ; 9. 34 ; »3- Je. 50. 44. * Comp. Sansc. toa ; Egypt, entok, fern, ento ; ancient and modern Pers. tu ; Greek rv (en.') ; Germ, tu, du [Engl, thou], see Gesenius's Heb. Gram. § 33, note. t Just as the separate suffixes stand for the nominative, so the inseparable, when appended to verbs, stand for the accu- sative, and but rarely for the dative, as with intransitive verbs. Particles having the force of a verb, or where the substantive verb must be supplied, take the verbal suffixes. As, ^IlH behold me! but on the contrary -IS.^NI he (is) not, •\"13'1'iy he (is) yet, where the nominative is designated by the same suffix. The suffixes are but seldom employed with prepositions. Comp. § 3, note. Sect. II. ] THE VERBAL SUFFIX. 11 2. Second Person Singular. The pausal form for the masculine, ^~ , commonly found with the verbs X\\'h k K'/(? (Is. 30. 19; Je. 23. 37; Eze. 28. 15), is seldom attached to other verbs (Is. 55. 5 ; De. 28. 24, 45), but ^~ is the more usual form (Is. 43. 5 ; 44. 2 ; Ps. 30. 13) ; the reverse, however, obtains when appended to the particles. Unfrequent forms are, H3 1 Ki. 18.44, and H3— Pr. 2. 11. ^KpKTpX Ho. 4. 6 is probably pointed incor- rectly for ^NDKftK, a Syriac form of the suffix, which occurs a few times in the Codex Sam. (Ge. 22. 26.) The form 1\\— for the feminine is unusual with the verb (Is. 54. 6), as is also «It when appended to the preterite, and \"5J— , the tone being thrown back (Is. 47. 10, comp. Is. 60. 7). ^, *?t (as in the Syriac) are frequently found in the later Psalms, comp. Ps. 137. 6. 3. Third Person Singular. The forms -13—, H3— occur frequently, and are most common in pause, comp. Ps. 65. 10 ; Job 5. 27; 41. 2. The two forms (viz., with and without epenth. J) are found in immediate succession in Is. 26. 5, f™ ^ d?®P- n^W- he casts her down> casts her down to the earth. The first word ought, doubtless, to conclude the first hemistich, though the accents decide differently. fi— is frequently written without Mappik, comp. H^prini Ex. 2. 3 ; rnp-in Ex. 9. 18 ; VNfW Amos 1.11 (the best mode of explaining the latter passage). H3— is of common occurrence. 4. First Person Plural. In Is. 85. 7, several MSS. and editions have W— instead of -13—. For this suffix the Chaldee uses the form W. Some discover such a Chaldaismin PlJfcOjpJjl Ex. 1. 10, for WK^jpJn {she befalls us). But H3 here may be regarded as the afformative of the fut. 3 pers. pi. fern, agreeing with niortpD, which follows it, in a col- lective sense (wars).* The Samaritan text indeed has such a Chaldaism in De. 32. 3, where nj*r&&6 stands for Wnl>&6, and in Nu. 16. 13. 5. Third Person Plural. That the forms of IB belong exclusively to the poetical style, may be seen from the examples in Noldius, Concordd. Particul. ed. Tympe, pp. 438, 498, 563, 564. But comp. § 5. No. 2, note. In Ex. 15.5, occurs ^P2* with -1 which is found nowhere else. This is, however, the common form in the Ethiopic. For the suffix | (fern.), B is frequently substituted (prob. to prevent its being mistaken for the para- gogic Nun), so that the distinction between masc. and fern, entirely ceases : e. g. D-1BHJJ1 and they drove them (the daughters) away, Ex. 2. 17; WlpN£! and they tied them (the kine), 1 Sa. 6. 10. Comp. Ge. 26.15; Nu. 17. 3,4; Jos. 4. 8; Ho. 2. 14; Pr.6.21. Just the reverse is found in the word PJ|)VT. Is. 48. 7, where I stands for D. 6. The tone invariably rests on the union vowel, or, in the absence of this, on the last syllable of the word. D3, \\2 and DH, |H are excepted, and are therefore called grave, the others light suffixes. 7. The participles and infinitives may take either the verbal, or nominal suffixes. The participle is but slightly affected by their difference, as ^\"gty he who created me, Job 32. 22, and WV my creator; *J*P Is. 47. 10, comp. Is. 28. 4. With the infinitive, however, they effect a change in the signification. JE. g. ^1% my calling, Ps. 141. 1, Hi?? my visiting, Je. 32. 5; but ^xjk to slay me, Ex. 2. 14, Wflf? to help me, 1 Ch. 12. 17. In the first examples, the suffix denotes the genitive, in the latter the accusa- tive. A single exception is found in Eze. 47. 7, *^tt#? in my returning, for O-lfe/'S. * In the same manner may be explained in Job 17. 16, nJ^Pfi, as agreeing with '•H'1!?^ (collect, expectations) of the preceding verse; in Is. 28. 3, rOpEHFI, instead of agreeing with the subject rntDJJ, agrees with the instrumental D v.11 ; and so in Ju. 5. 26, T\\\\TOV}T\\, agrees with the accusative KV (collect, her hands), comp. Ge. 27. 39 ; 31.8; Is. 18. 5, where the verb, instead of agreeing with the subject, agrees with the predicate. Moreover, T\\]Ty2WT\\ Ob. 13, may refer to the people addressed there, in the feminine. Hence several grammarians and commentators have been induced to observe, that the plural form of the future, rtt?bj?fi, frequently stands for the singular ?bj?]j), which, indeed, suits well the several passages, 12 SUFFIXES TO THE NOUN.

When the First Person V is to be appended to a noun terminating in *t, one Yod is dropped, as ?ia my people, Zep. 2. 9, for \"U . *— has the tone, which it loses when the word fol- lowing is either monosyllabic, or dissyllabic, having the tone on the first syllable (Milel) ; e. g. $$ ^m (thou art my sister) Ge. 12. 13; HW ^nb| Jos. 14. 119 comp. Ge. 20. 2, 5; 26.7,9; 49.3; Je. 2.27; 31.9; 2 Sa. 23. 17; Job 19. 25; 20.2; Ps. 140. 7. 2. Second Person /Singular. Unfrequent forms : masc.

It is generally corrected in the Keri, as in Ge. 49. 11 (twice) ; Ex. 22. 26; Le. 23. 13; 2 Ki. 19. 23; 20. 13; but is not corrected in Je. 2. 21 ; Eze. 20. 40. Fl— is also found without Mappik, as in Nu. 15. 28 (Job 31. 22): so that even N— is substituted for it in Eze. 36. 5, ^ b'HK (Edom, the whole of her) for nb. The forms -in— and n-7 are usually attached to nouns ending in H— , e. g. nK*}£ (sight) — •I^^IO, nsoD; nnfc> (field)—' mb; nbv \"(leaf) — -inby ; \"and so with $n, V_!$ for Hjn, njpD (friend). With other words they are seldom used, as -in^D? Ge. 1. 12, comp. Ju. 19. 24 ; Na. 1. 13 ; Job 25. 3. 4. First Person Plural. The form ft— (like the suff. of the verb) instead of ft—, must be regarded as an exception, as Job 22. 20 ; Ru. 3. 2, comp. No. 2. 5. Second and Third Person Plural. Anomalous and unfrequent forms are : 2 pers. rtij Eze. 23. 48 (comp. Eze. 13. 20) ; 3 pers. masc DH- 2 Sa. 23. 6, for DPI- (whence contr. U-) ; fern. Wt)—- 1 Ki. 7. 37; HJ- e. g.

(Table A). REMARKS. 1. The * which distinguishes these suffixes, is occasionally omitted in most of the persons ; e. g. livrl (similar to the pausal form of the singular) for Tffl thy ways, Ex. 33. 13 ; Ps. 119. 37; Jos. 1. 8; ■injn \"for -irpjn his friends, Job 42. 10 ; 1 Sa. 30. 26 ; W#£ for inngfc his felicities, Pr. 29. 18 ; jH^n ^y /a*,' Ge.4.4; brtfil #^r na/fofw, Ge. 10. 5; DH^pV a/fer tfAeiV hinds, Ge. 1.21; IDi??r their hearts, Na. 2. 8. This is most frequent in suffixes of the 3 pers. ' ing. masc, V~, which is very often, and in all the opies alike, written 1~, but the Keri almost always ubstitutes the common form V— . The word 1\"!JD! together, properly his unions) is alone excepted, in which the Keri has made no change, probably because 1~ was not regarded as a suffix. I^Dl occurs only in Je. 46. 12,21 ; 49. 3. 2. Although *~, or the * prefixed to these suffixes, is, doubtless, originally the plural termination of the masculine, they are yet regularly attached to the feminine plural T\\S also ; as *T\\)7\\\\> my voices, THvlp' thy voices. It is hence to be regarded as an exception, when these suffixes are occasionally found appended to T\\) without this * . As, *fnjj my testimonies, Ps. 132. 12 ; ^3£ thy strokes, De. 28. 59 ; WW thy sisters, Ex. 16. 52; DHUN their fathers, Ex. 4, 5; DriiniX their signs, Ps. 74. 4 ; DrnatfJ? their pains, Ps. 16. 4 ; Dnnjf *A«r distresses, Ps. 34. 18. 3. These suffixes with * are found, on the other hand, also with forms of the singular; as, TOf'\"?? thy praise, Ps. 9. 15 ; T$N# thy hatred, Eze. 35. 11 ; TO'tt? % building, Eze. 16. 31 ; D^D'H-jn yowr dis- * The suffixes appended to the noun properly stand for the genitive, as 'D-1D the horse of me, i. e. my horse.

Second Person Singular. Yod in T.T is furtive (like that in IV3 for TO), and the original form ^— is found in the Syriac and Chaldee. The feminine in these dialects is ..o.y . *??T, and so it is likewise in the Hebrew, by a Syriacism, as in Ps. 103.3,4,5; 116.7, and in Kheth. 2 Ki. 4. 3, 7. y~ Ec. 10. 17, is formed in imitation of the singular ^T. The suffix in !\"D3KpB (her mes- sengers) Nah. 2. 14, can hardly be accounted for; other codices read i\"lD— and ^5t. 5. Third Person Singular. The poetic 'in*— is formed in imitation of the sin- gular -in- e. g. Job 24. 23 ; Na. 2. 4.— *ni in ^A-I^n Ps. 116. 12, is strictly a Chaldee form. For W- is found ^vT m Eze. 41.15, comp. Chald.

Some of the older grammarians^ observe, that this form stands occa- sionally also for the singular. Kimchi (incorrectly) assigns as a reason, that this form exhibits both cha- racteristics of the plural and of the singular. But though it cannot be denied that in the passages cited above (De. 32. 37 excepted) this suffix has reference to nouns singular, nevertheless, those nouns being collectives, do not lose their plural signification. Another instance is in Ps. 11. 7, where 10\\3B as re- ferring to nin* may be regarded as a Pluralis majes- tatis. But were this form even to be admitted as strictly a singular, e. g. in Ps. 11.7, we should then have to suppose it a misuse arising from its frequent occurrence in connection with collective. nouns. The passages (Lu. 2. 4; Jo. 19. 27; Ac. 1. 20, from the Ethiopic version) cited by Lud. de Dieu (Crit. Sacra, p. 226, on Is. 53. 6), seem at all events to prove, that the suffix -Itti, answering to the Hebrew ^\"~, does in the Ethiopic stand for the singular.f Other unfrequent forms are, \"\"IDr^— Eze. 40. 16, rurVr Eze. 1. 11 ; n»9>- Eze. 13. 20.

Instead of 'v the form fci? is found several times (according to the Masora on Nu. chap. 11, 21 times) in Kheth., e.g. Ex. 21. 8; Le. 11. 21; 1 Sa. 2. 3, &c. 2. As regards the form \"18/ , grammarians main- tain that it is also a singular, i. q. 17, because it often agrees with nouns singular. Those singulars, how- ever, are all collectives, and can therefore not serve as a proof. The examples are, Ge. 9.26 (where it refers to b$, i. e. the descendants of Shem) ; Ps. 28. 8 (where it refers to the people of ver. 9, and hence some copies read }®U?) ; Ps. 73. 10 (also in reference to BJ?) ; Is. 44. 15 (in reference to /&$ and ?D3, which may likewise be taken in a collective sense) ; and finally Is. 53. 8. Though the subject of this last chapter is throughout given in the singular, yet the change to the plural form in ver. 8 is fully ac- counted for, when the servant of God (chap. 51. 13, like 42. 1, and 49. 3, 6) is considered to stand col- lectively for the prophets, which to me seems quite evident. Some copies have in Is. 44. 15 and 53. 8, V?, which is an exegetical gloss. (Gesenius.)*' 3. Unfrequent forms are : — 2 pers. masc. n3? Ge. 27. 37 ; 2 pers. pi. fern.

The forms in the paradigm are the usual ones ; unfrequent forms are : — 2pers.masc. \"\"I?p^ (in pause) Ex. 29. 35, D?niK Jos. 23. 15, Dn?K Ge. 32. 1, Dn^K Eze. 23. 45 ; fern. fnniK Eze. 23. 47, Pltfn« Ex. 35. 26. 5.

'3D (from me) must not be confounded with *3K> where * is paragogic. 6. -laiffc from him (for WJBD), and MlgD from us (for -I^JOJO) can only be distinguished by the context. 7. The pronouns HDn and n$n often retain their full form after the prepositions, as, HfcnS Ex. 36. 1 ; Hab. 1.16; n£ri3 Je. 36. 32 ; niprb Je. 14. 16; nJOnJO Ec. 12. 12; Je. 10. 2; fern. n|H| Le. 5. 22; Nu. 13. 19 ; n|03 Ge. 41. 19 ; T^rf> Eze. 1. 5, 23 ; 42. 9: nana Le. 4. 2. * But if there were even no other passage to establish the use of )u? in the singular, the passages Is. 53. 8, and 44. 15 alone might have been sufficient for this purpose : the former, where throughout the chapter only the singular appears; and the latter, where the plural does not at all suit the sense, and the writer himself explains it in the same connection by 'l? in ver. 17. Comp. Hengstenberg's « Christology of the Old Testament,\" p. 523 of Prof. Keith's translation. In con- firmation of this we may add the facts, that some copies do really read r? instead of )u7 in both passages, and that the form -T701 in the Ethiopic, answering to the Hebrew ITO1*— , is used in that version for the singular, as Gesenius himself admits (comp. § 5. rem. 6). When we, moreover, consider that this poetic syllable, which never receives the tone as a suffix, almost everywhere occurs in pause, or, which amounts to the same thing, stands with a word preceding the pause (comp. De. 32.27; Ps. 11.7; Job 20. 23; and Lehrgeb. § 52, 4 anm. 1 in reference to Jos. 3.9; De. 32. 37, comp. Is. 21. 14; Ps. 4. 3, comp. also below, § 24. rem. 5), its specific use, in the poetical books, appears to be, that it takes the place of other forms, which must necessarily have the tone upon the ultimate, to suit the pause, the tendency of which is to throw the tone back upon the penultimate. Thus )u? which occurs 55 times, is everywhere in pause, except three times (Ps. 66. 7; 119. 165 ; Job 24. 17) before the word in pause, most probably for Oil? or r?, which, the former with grave suffix and the latter as a monosyllable, never can change the tone. Nor is it improbable that the JO of 1J0? in the singular is merely epenthetic, as in *3*1D|, comp. the poetical forms 1J03, 1J03, \"ID?, as independent words formed from the prefixes 3, 3, ? , and the syllable 1J0.

Besides the five usual forms of conjugation ex- hibited in the preceding paradigm (viz. Kal, Niphal, Piel and Pual, Hiphil and Hophal, Hithpael), there are other unusual forms, which, although they occur but seldom in the regular verb, are, nevertheless, usual in certain classes of the irregular verb. Of the latter conjugations some are connected in form with Piel, and are made by the doubling or repetition of one or more radical letters, or by the insertion of a long vowel, i. e. by changes within the root itself ; 16 UNUSUAL CONJUGATIONS. [Sect. VI. others are analogous to Hiphil, and are formed by the addition of prefix letters or syllables. To the former class, besides a Passive distinguished by the more obscure vowels in the final syllable, belongs also a reflective form with the prefix ^H after the analogy of Hithpael. Those which are analogous to Piel, and which follow it in their inflexion are : — 1. Poel; as hu)\\), reflexive ^'\"IpJ^n, fut. hti\\\\>\\, part. 7ftipD, fut. pass. /t?ip*. In the regular verb it occurs very seldom. Examples are : — ^tpSE'P my judge, Job 9. 15 ; VflJtTP* ? have appointed, 1 Sa. 21.3; WW to take root, Is. 40. 24, denom. from VH$ root. In verbs V\"V it is far more frequent; e. g. Z?in, 2?iD, ]y\\ll. Its signification is mostly analogous to Piel. 2. Pilel, Pulal, Hithpalel ; as 7?t?p and 7/Pp, pass. ??t?p, reflexive ??ppnn (the last radical letter being repeated). In the regular verb, the following are the only examples :— 77B3 Eze. 28. 23, i. q. 7&3 to fall ; ^nriEV it has consumed me, Ps. 119. 139, ^•inntpV Ps. 88. 17, which probably is to be read ^flljlDV* (from HIP'S) they consume me (Dagesh in both in- stances is euphonic) ; with guttural |3K£? to be at rest, }3JJH to be green ; pass. s?l?R to be withered. It is more frequent in verbs )\"]), where it takes the place of Piel and Hithpael. 3. Pealal, as ?E?t3p (the two last letters being re- peated) used especially of slight motions repeated in quick succession ; e. g. \"l£nnp to go about with quick motion, hence of the heart, to beat quick, to palpitate, Ps. 38. 11, from \"IIID to go about; pass. (Poalal) ip^pn to ferment with violence, to make a rumbling sound, La. 1. 20. 4. Pilpel, formed from a biliteral root by doubling both radical letters, as SID, 1D3D ; S-13, ^!?3. This also is used of motion rapidly repeated, e. g. ?|V5¥ to chirp, ?¥/¥ to tinkle, 1X1% to gargle, $]JJQV to flutter (from S|-iy to fly) ; reflex. 73 /Jinn to roll oneself down. With Hiph. are connected : — 5. Tiphel, as ?QpFi, with fi prefixed ; e. g. ?i\")n to teach one to walk, to lead, denom. from ?#JTJ a foot ; milFI, fut. rnnn* to emulate, Je. 12. 5 ; 22. 15 (from PHI! to be ardent, eager). 6. Shaphel, as^DpB* frequent in the Syriac; e. g. 2 rife to burn, from 3 PI?. In the Hebrew it is found only in the noun flirt ?K> flame. Forms of which single examples occur : — ■ 7. ttbpp, pass. P?tpp ; as DBpnp scaled off, having the form of scales, Ex. 16. 14, from Pjpn=^^n to peelt to scale. 8. ?PPp, as fc|*nt Ps. 72. 6, a violent rain, from tjlt. 9. ?tDpPi| (the two first letters repeated) a passive, only ty&il thou art fair, Ps.45. 3, from HB\\ 10. /$prj|l (frequent in the Rabbinic) a form com- pounded of Niph. and Hiph., found in the examples •1\"lp|l!l for •'HpirO they permit themselves to be ad- monished, Eze. 23. 48; 1B33 De. 21. 8; nin^3 Pr.27. 15.f 11. S>bitDp, in itftfCl to blow the trumpet, from \"Tglj, The participle DnixPID occurs 1 Ch. 15. 24 ; 2 Ch. 5. 13 ; 7.6; 13. 14 ; 29. 28 in Kheth., and is doubt- less to be read DHV^Dfr ; but the Keri invariably rejects one V, pointing it either as Hiph. or Piel, Dnsn» or DnsriD. * The supposition that -IDri stands for -inn may be founded upon the principle, that the feeble subordinate sound of vocal Sheva often conforms to the following proper vowel of the syllable, e. g. DID, LXX SoSoju., Sodom ; !\"lb?K> 2oA.o;hc6j/, Solomon (Lehrg. § 14. Gram. § 10. 2). t The form -vfcO} La. 4. 14, is supposed to be likewise a compound, viz. of Niph. and Pual OPNUJ and -1^3), in which form Gesenius discovers a passive of Niphal. Passives of Hithpael are: -llpSsrin for -HpSrin, Nu. 1.47 ; 2.33; N^tSH for KEttJin, De. 24. 4 ; DMH Le. 13. 55, 56 ; jghn Is. 34. 6. Lehrg. § 71. 4. Sect.

The verbs of middle 0 (as |E£)* retain this Hholem in the 2nd and 1st persons, as ^7^1 lam able, Ge. 30. 8 ; Ju. 8. 3 ; Ps. 40. 13 ; £*$, VHJJ thou wast, I was, afraid, De. 28. 60 ; 9. 19 ; ^b£ / am small, Ge. 32. 11 ; W|^ / lay snares, Je. 50. 24. This and the usual form {middle A) are found together in Ge. 43. 14, *{0B? tffcbj? Tg>g3 as I am bereaved, I am bereaved. In those cases, however, where (according to rem. 7) the tone is shifted to the ultimate, viz. in the 2nd pers. pi., before suffixes, and Vav conversive of the preterite, Hholem is shortened to Kamets Hhatuph ; as £??$ and thou shall be able, Ex. 18. 23, ^!Ps.l3.5.' The verbs middle JE generally lose the sound (<>) in their inflexion, e. g. fS>n, n?£n (like ^i?, %%$), and this original vowel appears again only : — (a) in the 3 pers. sing, and pi. standing in pause, as -Vl?! they are strong, 2 Sa. 1. 23 ; nj5Q'!T she cleaves, Job 29. 10 ; •Ipl'l Job 41. 15.

K), usual in the Arabic, is found in the Hebrew ; as \\^h\\\\ Jos. 10. 24. It is but seldom that parag. \\ is appended to the preterite; as, PJHJ De. 8. 3, 16. Examples with euphonic Dagesh, in pause, are : — -1?^n Ju. 5. 7 ; 1 Sa. 2. 5 (where, however, MSS. vary) ; Mf»j Eze. 27. 19. 5. Second Person Singular. Besides the common form ft for the masculine, the full form nri also occurs ; e. g. nP1132 Mai. 2. 14, nJMgt Jos. 13. 1. 2 pers. fern. As was observed above (§ 1. rem. 2), that besides the pronoun £)&?, there occurs another form *flK in Kheth., so it should be remembered in this afFormative derived from it, there occurs, besides n, also the form *? in Kheth., e. g. ^hn Je. 31. 21, * The common form of the 3 pers. pret. has, in the final syllable of the ground-form, either A (Pattahh), E (Tseri pure), or O (Hholem pure), — as IJ^D to reign, f^T] to be sour, pb*1 to be able, — which are found likewise in the irregular verb, e. g. T\\\"0 (for HUD) to die, lix (for 11K) fo 6e Kg-M, ftr^g-M. For the sake of brevity, these are called, after the example of the Arabic grammarians, verbs middle A, middle E, and middle O. The two latter are usual in intransitive verbs, e. g. }j?,T to be old, |bj? to be small (Lehrg. § 66. 3). t It is better, however, to view these as two different forms of the same verb, comp. the Lexicon. + This shortening, however, into , & may properly be from Pattahh, occasioned by the removal of the tone to the next following syllable, comp. DDT for D3T, )1D for HD from ID, comp. especially §11. rem. 1 ; so that there is no need to suppose here a ground-form middle E,' as h$$, G5H\\ ^\\ § Nevertheless, Zakeph-katon may in this instance have the force of a pausal accent. 18 REGULAR VERB— KAL comp. Eze. 16. 13, which is to be read *H??H. In such instances the Keri has the note '* \"VJV (abundat *), and in thus rejecting * the vowel points are suited accordingly. 6. Second Person Plural Feminine. Instead of ffi, the form nJJjl is used in Am. 4. 3, corresponding to a similar form of the pronoun, § 1. rem. 5. 7. In combination with the afformatives 5, *fi, '13 the tone is on the penultima, and the word is said to be Milel (above), but with the other afformatives the tone is on the ultimate, and the word is said to be Milra (below). The tone, however, is shifted, [a) by conversive Vav of the preterite from the penultima to the ultimate (comp. § 18. rem. 1), e. g. ^HP^ and thou shall visit, Job 5. 24, WpS-l Ex. 32. 34, except in pause, comp. however, De. 8. 6 ; (b) by the suffixes, comp. the table of the verb with suffixes ; (c) by the pause in-several of the persons from the ultimate to the penultima, where the original vowel, if it has fallen away, is likewise restored, as njjpjj, ™l?j ^V?*? j $f{?5» &c. ; the tone, however, remains fixed with the grave afformatives, as ^tap. II. On the Infinitive oe Kal. 8. There is but one form for the inf. abs. which is ?M3j5 (with Hholem impure). The Hholem is found written either in full, or defectively (tag) ; the former, however, is the original. 9. For the inf. constr. the usual form is tap (with Hholem pure), besides which there is also an unusual form tap, as 11$ to lie down, Ge. 34. 7; 2 Ki. 14. 22; %f to be humbled, Pr. 16. 19 ; Ec. 12. 4. That they are strictly Segolate forms is seen from their inflexion (vPi?, *??^), which perfectly agrees with the declen- sion of the Segolates (tap or tap ; tap or tap, tap.) comp. § 35. rem. 10. 10. The various infinitive forms, which occur as verbal nouns, will be enumerated farther on (§ 26). Here belong only such as are really construed as in- finitives. They are : — (a) ntag, ntap and i\"ltap, as feminine forms from tap, tap ; e. g. nnib to be lifted up, Zep. 3.-11 ; HXftD? to become unclean, Le. 15. 32; i\"ltar6 to [Sect. VIII. have compassion, Eze. 16. 5; Hn^D? to anoint, Ex. 29. 29 ; n^m? to wash, Ex. 30. 18 ; n3\"lp^ to draw near, Ex. 3G. 2 ; fi&Op?, instead of which by Syriasm, JlfcOpb1 to meet (i. e. against). Moreover, HK\"^ to /ear, De. 4. 10, and TXtiZW to hate, De. 1. 27, occur construed as infinitives, but are besides, more usually verbal nouns. Forms like !\"!E>£>X, T\\\\>}V\\, are pro- duced by the effect of the gutturals. (b) With a preformative ft, as in the Syriac and Chaldee, as BHJD to drive, Eze. 36. 5 ; K^ptS to convoke, Nu. 10. 2; so likewise in some verbs of J\" 2, as fcS'&'D for T - KSMD *o ca7Ti/, Nu. 4.24; ySD to remove, De. 10. 11* (c) Other examples are VW Hab. 3. 13, ttSX Ex. 28. 8, which may, however, be regarded as verbal nouns* (d) WVyi Ezr. 10. 16, for 65>Tl is quite anomalous. (Gesenius, in his Thesaurus, is inclined to regard it as an inf. Piel, for WW, comp. -1^1 Pr. 26. 7, for if?%) III. On the Imperative oe Kal. 1 1 . The verbs which have A in the second syllable of the future retain the same also in the imperative ; as llf lie dozen, 2 Sa. 13. 5 ; Eze. 4. 4 ; &J? put on, 1 Ki. 22. 30 ; Q_V be peaceable, Job 22. 20. With parag. H— the form tap becomes n/^P, the form tap becomes ntap ; as, i\"np^ watch over (from 1»f ) ps'. 25. 20, rript remember (from 13?) 2 Ch. 6. 42 ; T\\ttW &. (/ora, Ge. 39. 12, nnpft 5e#, Ge. 25. 31, fTTCJ (with euphonic Dagesh) from \"^ for \"ft| ^, Ps. 141. 3.f 12. The form yPP, -\"tap is more directly derived from tap than tap, and is chiefly found with im- peratives of the first form, e. g. Tf7, *??£*, though also with those of the latter form. The form VPiJ, however, is comparatively unfrequent ; as, *?ta reign, Ju. 9. 10, 12; ^ re?Mce, Zep. 3. 14; ♦rng make bald, Mi. 1. 16 ; 'fcfQ draw, Eze. 32. 20 (but also ttK^O Ex. 12. 21) ; with composite Sheva, *ODi? wse enchantment, 1 Sa. 28. 8, Keri. Segol is found only with gutturals (§13. rem. 3). In pause the long O or A returns again ; as, -Ittbip judge ye, Zee. 7. 9. Such forms, however, are found also without pause, as Da. 9. 19, with which the fol- lowing may be classed : iTJJPI. HDI^2 — nT3\") tremble — strip thyself and make thee bare, Is. 32. 11, and according to some, also rnurj {gird thyself} which immediately follows in this passage. * The infinitives of b and c, on account of their small number, must, in the Lexicon, be sought for among the nouns. t The lengthened imperative or imp. parag. is, as may be seen from a comparison of the references given above, expressive of wish and entreaty ; and is often emphatic, as Dip stand up, Dftlp up! (comp. rem. 13, and §11. rem. 5). Sect. VIII.] REGULAR VERB— KAL. 19 In some instances Hholem has been retained in the inflexion according to Kheth. ; as HSII^ try, Ps. 26. 2, rDV?D reign, Ju. 9. 8, *D1Dp use enchantment, 1 Sa. 28. 8, where the Keri has invariably cancelled 1. IV. On the Future of Kal. 13. The Hholem in the second syllable of the future is almost exclusively confined to the transitive verbs (middle A) ; while the verbs middle E and O (?££, ?b{3) have regularly Pattahh in the future ; e. g. ^1|, fut. b\"3J» to be great, 123, fut. 13?* to be honoured; |bj3, fut. ]W\\ to be small, hbW, fut. bf! to be childless. In several verbs, however, this dif- ference of form exists only in the future, so that the future 0 stands for the transitive, and the future A for the intransitive signification ; as \"TO to cat off, to reap (Le. 25. 5 ; De. 24. 19, &c), future A, to be cut, i. e. to be short (Ju. 10. 16 ; 16. 16) ; Bnn, future 0, to cat, to plough, future A, to be dumb, (properly, to be blunted)', £^?n, future 0, to subdue, Ex. 17. 13, future A, to be subdued, Job 14. 10 ; DIJ to overlay, cover, fut. A intrans. ver. 8. In a few instances the difference in the signification is of another character; e. g. \"IT 5* he shall cut (eat), Is. 9. 19, ^\\ trop. he shall decide, Job 22. 28 ; ^?n fut. 0, to saddle, fut. A and O, to bind up, Job 5. 18; Eze. 34. 16; 3ny fut. 0, to be surety for, 31.V f^t. A, to be sweet. Very frequently both occur without any difference of signification; as T&f\\ (Le. 26. 35) and T\\2f\\ (ver. 34) he shall rest; *n&, future 0 (Ps. 7. 3 ; Ho. 5. 14), and future A (Ge. 49. 27), to tear; VU fut. O (Nu. 6. 21 ; De. 12. 17, &c), and fut. A (Ge. 28. 20, &c), to vow; \"S|B>3 fut. 0, Ec. 10. 11, and fut. A, Pr. 23. 22, to bite ; 131 fat O, Mai. 2. 15, fut. A, ver. 10, to be treacherous. With parag. H, the form ?bj?£ becomes \"™i?^. This (so called) lengthened future (comp. note to rem. 11) is usually attached to the 1 pers. sing, and pi., and is found in all classes of the regular and irregular verbs, except in the passives, and has the tone, wherever it is taken, by the afformatives -1 and *T, and hence affects in precisely the same manner the final vowel of the ground-form, e. g. Kal iTT.pKW, Piel n$UJ Ps. 2. 3 ; but Hiph. n^SJK * It is, however, sometimes found attached to other persons, as the second and third, comp. Is. 5. 19 ; Eze. 23. 20 ; Ps. 20. 4. The form <\"l- is also some- times found instead of n— as Hfcnpk 1 Sa. 28. 15, n;ri! Ps. 20. 4. 14. In the forms in which, according to the para- digm, Hholem is dropped, something of the O sound seems to have been expressed in the time when the Hebrew was a living language. Thus the vowel of the last syllable is constantly retained in the Arabic, and is lost only in the vulgar dialect. Traces of this are observable, (a) in the old matres lectionis, which the Keri has cancelled : — i\"P1pG5>&0 and I weighed, Ezr. 8. 25, nmpWtt / will rest, Is. 18. 4, £lBO* they stumble, Pr. 4. 16 ; (b) where the vowel remains and is pointed -1, being considered shorter than 1 ; as •Itt-ISK* they shall judge, Ex. 18. 26, *>Ui«3 thou shall pass on, Ru. 2. 8, D\"Tlftlpfi thou shall observe them, Pr. 14. 3 ; (c) in (t:) which the punctuators have occa- sionally substituted for simple Sheva, e. g. n?j5J^N1 and fi^i?.^ in the Keri of the passages quoted above, comp. Ezr. 8. 26 ; Je. 32. 9 ; Hggg / might kiss, 1 Ki. 19.20, D1DK Ho. 10. 10; comp. Is. 27. 3 ; 62.2; Eze. 35. 6. \" ' 15. The vowel of the last syllable is regularly re- stored again in pause, with which it receives the tone. Pattahh is then lengthened into Kamets, e. g. vbjpfl, • vr : • 5 v. : • 16. For the 3 pers. pi. fern. H^bjpfl, the form iljpbj?* is substituted, in three instances, to dis- tinguish it from the 2 pers., viz. «l3*]b3£ they shall arise, Da. 8. 22, comp. Ge. 30. 38 ; 1 Sa. 6. 12. The parag. H in H3 , both for the masc. and fern, is often dropped, so that only \\ remain ; e. g. Jlf |fl Ge. 33. 6. A single anomaly is n^nSJfil, Eze. 16. 50, for njiiajn (comp. Verb Ain gutt.) where *~ is inserted after the manner of verbs W and W . 17. To the forms ending in -1 or *t a parag. f is often appended, most frequently at the end of a period, where the vowel of the second syllable is restored, though this vowel does not (as in No. 15) receive the tone ; e. g. Pt|T. Ex. 15. 14, ]^fP\\ De. 1.17, comp. Ps. 104. 9, 22, 28, 29 ; Joel 3. 1 ; Ex. 9. 29. For instances of this without pause comp. Ru. 2. 8, 9 ; Ps. 4. 3 ; but the vowel is then more fre- quently not restored, comp. Hab.3.7; Ps. 104.28,29; De. 8. 20 ; Ex. 4. 9. V. On the Infinitive, Impeeeect, and Future oe Kae. 18.

Before Makkeph, Hholem is changed into Kamets- hhatuph, as:— iW>Kfe$ 2 Sa. 8. 10; Ps. 78. 18, KrG2>TJ Je. 21. 2, PI3-^2l?n Zee. 9. 2. Where 1 stands in the text, it is cancelled in the Keri, so that it remains only in the Kheth. ; e. g. iWwA Ru. 4. 6 Kh. (Keri iW>N:6), -£-31113 Eze. 24. 2 Kh. (Keri ^flS), ^-nm^N* Ho. 8. 12 Kh. (Keri i^#?$). VI. On the Participle of Kal. 19. ?t?ip is the regular participle of the verbs middle A, like ?£?£. The Hholem is impure, and ought, therefore, to be written fully ; it is, however, more frequently written defectively, not only before an accession at the end, but even in the ground form, ^p. Like the noun, it often has parag. * appended to the construct state ; as n3p *J?K> the inhabitant of the thorn-lush, De. 33. 16, 1-VVn *D5ft who changes the rock, Ps. 114. 8, D?£g>3 *n|P* wAo dtt>e7fo m heaven, Ps. 123. 1, jS.ab npfc «,Ao &/wfo fo the vine, Ge. 49. 11, JKSn npZec.ll.'l7. In its inflexion it differs in nothing from the noun (comp. dec. 7), and by the same analogy Is formed the feminine ; only that it must be noticed, that the feminine form TOtip (with gutt. nyD'^) is here more frequent than n?tpp . When the tone is thrown back on account of a word, with the tone on the penultima, following it, Segol is substituted in the final syllable, as in Is. 41. 7, Slip E?in who smites the anvil. An unfrequent form is «pCWI upholding, Ps. 16. 5, for W^; *|bV *3£l behold lam adding,Is.29. 14; 38.5? 20. The participles of the verbs middle E and O do not differ in form from the preterite ; as K?B he is full, and full; \\$\\ he slept, and sleeping ; \"l3* Ae was afraid, and fearing. Where these forms do not occur as participles, they are at least verbal adjectives f SECTION IX.— NIPHAL. REMARKS. 1. Preterite. There is no positive proof for the existence of preterites like '££*?, ?BjM, corresponding to ?l?j5, ?bj5 of the Kal (comp. § 8. rein. 1, note), in addition to the form }>bjj3; for DintfJ Est. 8. 8, \"linp_ 1 Ch. 5. 20, \"span J Est. 9\". 1, usually'regarded as such preterites, are properly infinitives abs. With regard to the tone and its changes, the remarks already made upon Kal (§ 8. rem. 7) are also applicable to Niphal. 2. The first inf. abs. (?»$), connects itself, in form, with the preterite, to which it bears the same relation as ?itSj3 to ?t?j3 , and is the only infinitive of this kind. Examples are — E'npp warring, Ju. 11. 25, tJD?3 longing, Ge. 31. 30, h'tify asking for oneself, 1 Sa. 20. 6, nhfi sending, Est.' 3. 13. Examples for the second form are— |h|n Je. 32. 4, hhttn Le. 7. 18, once KHIK being inquired of, Eze. 14. 3, which is quite an Arabic form. The construct form is but seldom used instead of the absolute, e. g. 1£>tpn De. 4. 26. In Ps. 68. 3, *\\VP\\ \\&VT Sft?fl| as smole is driven away thou drivest (them) away, the form * This form is, however, not universally acknowledged as a participle. Thus is SpDIfi regarded as fut. of Hiph. thou makest wide, glorious, from sj»», Arab, amplus fuit (Schult, instit. ad fundam. 1 Hebr. p. 298). P)pi> is likewise taken as Hiph. with T^K supplied, and rendered, / am he who shall add. t This is indeed true in principle ; we find it, however, more convenient to class even the participle cited here, ar adjectives, where they will be found in the Lexicon. ^H, as the construct of ^|D, is chosen instead of *Di»?, probably for its agreement of sound with the following *Hf fl . 3. The infinitive, imperative, or future, in those per- sons which have no afformatives, when immediately followed by a word of one syllable, have the tone commonly drawn back to the penultima, and the final syllable having lost the tone receives Segol instead of Tseri; as HJ ^\\ Ec. 7. 26, H| 5f&* Eze. 33. 12, m] ansa ps. 102. 19, & ngpi Ge'. 25. 21 ; 2 Ch. 33. 13, W |OK» 1 Ki. 8. 26, \\V TO$ Is. 4. 3, \"11 K R^ Job 38. 24 ; so in the inf.

In the 2 and 3 pers. pi. the form with Pattahh is more common than that with Tseri, not only in pause (as r\\^W7\\ Zee. 14. 2, napgTFI Is. 28. 3), and with gutturals or 1 (as nrgflil Is. 65. 17, HJOpsn Is. 35. 5), but even in the absence of either of these, e. g. nApKB Je. 24. 2. under the preformative, as V.^^ I swear, Ge. 21. 24, ^T^Eze.14.3, comp. Ge. 19. 20; 1 Sa. 20.29; 27.1; Job 1.15, 16, 17; Is. 1. 24, &c. 6. When the prepositions |, 3 ?, are to be pre- fixed to the infinitive the H is frequently contracted, but not so frequently as in the Hiphil ; e. g. W|3 for i?^|n^L pr. 24. 17. This contraction, however, is more usually with verbs of first guttural, as ^IP^? for *l9?n| La. 2. 11, comp. Eze. 26. 15; Is. 1. 12, &c. 5.

The absence of this Dagesh is sometimes in- timated {a) by the lengthening of the preceding vowel, e.g. Dg<W for Dj?j?rp. 1 Ch. 23. 6; (b) by a Hhatuph under the letter which was to have had the Dagesh, e. g. nnjA for T\\t$? Ge. 2. 23, comp. Ju. 16. 16. I. On Hipelil. 1. The characteristic *t impure of the final syllable is only retained in the 3 pers. preterite of Hiph. (in the participle also, but with some exceptions) so as not to have another form with Tseri. In the imp. inf. and fat. there exists also a form with Tseri in the final syllable, which however differs from the other in signification, as the following remarks will show. Forms in the preterite deviating from the paradigm are, {a) with (v) under H , e. g. Wlpz?n ive are ashamed, 1 Sa. 25. 7, which is still more usual in verbs H\"?, e.g. nibr\\, r\\^[), rn?n; (b) with «, as in the Aramaic; wS]S I have polluted, Is. 63. 3 ; (c) with (0 in the 2 and 3 pers., however only with suffix, as wfl^n 1 Sa. l. 28. 2. The inf. absol. has generally Tseri with or without Yod; as D?^D to rise up early, Je. 7. 13, and D^H Je. 44. 4, &c. ; ^£f D destroying, Is. 14. 23, andTWD Am. 9. 8; ^f H casting, Je. 22. 19; TOj?n burning' incense, 1 Ki. 9.' 25; TDVil Ne. 7. 3 : p^il De. 15. 14, &c. A form with K, by Chaldaism, is D*3fK Je. 25. 3. As such may be taken \"TOK Ge. 41. 42, viz. as an inf. abs. for the imperative, bow the knee, if regarded according to Hebrew etymology. When followed by Makkeph the inf. takes Segol, as D^an|n Pr. 24. 23; 28.21. Unfrequent exceptions are, when the form with Tseri occurs for the inf. constr., as ?0pn De. 32. 8, comp. ch. 26. 12 ; Da. 11. 35, and the form with *— for the inf. abs. Jos. 7. 7. 3. When the prepositions ?, ?, ? are prefixed to the inf. constr. generally no contraction takes place, and the form remains ?*9j?na , ^Pj?r6, &c., differing SECTION XI.— HIPHAL AND HOPHAL. REMARKS. in this respect from the future, where ^Pi?! stands for ?>PpH,:. There are, however, some few excep- tions; e. g. TPfb to destroy, Is. 23. 11 ; Wiyb to put an end to, Am. 8. 4 ; wf> to make white, Da. 11. 35 ; %j?

Infinitives not differing in form from the pre- terite, are more frequent here than in Piel (§10. rem. 2); e. g. ^W H ^ 2 Ki. 3. 25; t^j ^lin.}^ Je. 50. 34 ; D^?6l ™D? ^¥01 |b|-nint $ Is'. 31. 5. These examples may yet be doubted, as they can be regarded as real preterites, and the prepositions before them as mere conjunctions (for \"TC5W 1}) , ^P$. W??) ; there are, however, others which must be recognised as infinitives, e. g. ^p/P^O De. 7. 24 ; moreover lV3nVINI nWpn *H.0.K after the scraping of the house, Le. 14. 43 (where the ending fil of the verb H'v decides for the inf.) 5. In the imp. the leading form (^PPH) does not occur at all ;* instead of it are employed the shortened and lengthened forms, ^t?j?n and n!?»t?j?n (§ 8. rem. 13) ; e. g. )W D make fat, Is. 6. 10 ; ngfcn atod, Job 33. 31 ; ni^pnPs.5.3; 17.1; l^yn prosper, 1 Ki. 22. 12,15, and rin^yn Ps. 118. 25 (nowhere D^yn) ; D3H look, Job 35. 5*, and n^ll La. 1.11; 113 fe#, lSa.25.11; ?3?0 separate, Is. 56. 3 ; nj*BPj?n hearken. Before Makkeph (<<) is changed into (v), as &fcr||pn Job 22. 21 ; KJ-Bjn Ge. 15. 5. 6. In the future, the more usual form is that with Tseri for the shortened future, and has in general the * This remains, however, the ground-form whenever the suffixes are added, as ^^JD^H Ps. 143. 8, and is analogous to the forms with the afformatives having a union vowel, as y^tppn, -I^Dpn, Sect.

In the plural Tseri is sometimes entirely dropped, as is the case with the e of the final syllable in the Aramaic — ^T]!l for •l^'H*]!! and they bent (the bow), Je. 9. 2 ; *pflii and they pursued, 1 Sa. 14. 22 ; 31. 2. 8.

The tone in Hiph. differs from that of the rest of the conjugations, inasmuch as it does not rest upon the afformatives -1 and *t in the pret., imp. and fut. In the pret. however, they receive the tone by conversive Vav; nJ^^Ol and she shall divide, Ex.. 26. 33, but is retained in HTlin \\ and she told, 2 Sa. 17. 17. II. On Hophal. 10. Besides the form with Kamets-Hhatuph given in the paradigm, there is another with Kibbuts equally frequent, and often in one and the same verb, e. g. ^H he is cast, Da. 8. 11, n?^0 Is. 14. 19, *R?hfn Ps. 22. 11, fut. t|^> Is. 34.3,\" Eze. 16. 5, part,' ^bfD 2 Sa. 20. 21 ; 33f n /o oe laid, Eze. 32. 32, imp. fi^S^n ver. 19; \"I^H fo be appointed, Je. 6. 6, part.

Of the inf. constr. as given in the paradigm, there happens to occur no example in the regular verb. 12. Of the participle there occurs, in Eze. 46. 22, the uncontracted form TO?i?njP for TOXJ3D.

The preterite, as in Piel, has frequently also Pattahh in the final syllable, e. g. pjnfln to show oneself courageous, 2 Ch. 13. 7 ; 15. 8. This vowel occurs also in the future and imperative, as B3DJV he thinks himself wise, Ec. 7. 16 ; J3#fln delight thy- self, Ps. 37. 4 ; S^Pfln sanctify thyself Jos. 3. 5, comp. 1 Ki. 20. 22.

The preterite with conversive Vav has some- times HJiirek instead of Pattahh in the penultima which has lost the tone, as W^ni ^inCH / will show myself great and holy, Eze. 38. 23 ; oW^n} and ye shall shoiv yourself holy, Le. 11. 44 ; 20. 7, comp. in Kal the form ^J (§ 8. rem. lb). 3. The Syriac form with HK occurs in 2 Ch. 20. 35, \">5D^K for \"ISD^n he joined himself Note. The T\\ of the syllable HH suffers the following changes : — (a) when the first radical of the verb is a sibilant (D, )£, W) it changes place with T\\, as ItpFl&T} for \"florin, banpn for ^pnri; ¥ causes, more- over, a change of T) into the more nearly related 13, as pUDyn for P1EVH ; (*0 before 1, T, tt & n it is assimilated, e. g. \"12 \"HH from 1-^, -13-Tn from i\"DT Is. 1. 16, intSil, DftfiP!; sometimes also before J & 3, as K23I1, elsewhere K23nn ; $311 for |ibnn. 4.

The form of the future exhibited in the para- digm is that of the verbs fut. 0, as D?n* to dream, ^V.l to serve, \"121?! to pass over, \"=]\"$.! to set in order. The verbs fut. A take Segol under the preform atives, as ?5$* to mourn, PVQ. to be strong, Tip* fa tremble, ^^.! to oe sweet. Less frequently do verbs _/&£ 0 occur with Segol, as *)bx* to collect, ^nj to ma/ce 5are, and once in pause ?3? J°b 10. 20 (elsewhere ?nn.J). Both futures, like nbj£ & pTJjJ, are found in one and the same verb (with or without a difference of sig- nification), as in ^?n to bind, ^?n to be weak, BHn fo cm*, fan fo <fe%A* tn, Snjtf (§ 8. rem. 18). Moreover, V? to #o, n,?nFi (grassari) for n,?nFl (comp. rem. 12) Ex. 9. 23; Ps. 73. 9. Examples with afformatives are : — J'\"!i2!, W)?*, n|\"in« (fo MQ, ijbn:, wan* {to turn) ; ptji, •Iptm ; IIS, -nnnj (to fremjfe). 5. Other verbs have very constantly simple Sheva under the guttural ; but in the same relation as mentioned above. This is most frequently the case with n, as nan* (for l5q») to gird on, bfon» to pity, Sbfy to think ; ^JIT} to cease, DSD* to 6e wi»«. The persons with afformatives remain quite regular, as 'VlfD!, -v^n*. Less frequently are both forms found in the same verb, e. g. 3Pt«; pr. 3. 12, and 2n^J pr. 15. 9, 12, and especially when the leading form has composite Sheva ; but with the afformatives and suffixes, simple Sheva is introduced, as B*3ffi, but ■1E%! 1 Ki. 13. 13, -IH^ni Ho. 6. 1 ; i»hq!De.\"24. 6, pi.\" &n* Job 24.3; P>i?D! , pl. iJp^n* Jos. 14. 5; so also nfe, pi. -in#!; nby.!,'but nn^K, rrayj. 6. Since the punctuation (-:r)> (:-) considered shorter than (v:iv) , (: .,-, , the former is sometimes used where the form is augmented by afformatives, suf- fixes, &c, while the leading form has the latter punctuation. E. g. ^Dg (to collect), but top**!, *ap«fl, and so with suffix; ibg} (to SmoT), with suff. -innD^, •in-no^ &c. ; npn.; (to ^0, pl. -^TO ps. 34. 11 ; Eze. 4. 17.

Besides the form exhibited in the paradigm there is another with simple Sheva, as DPJO (to be guilty), T5DJ (to be glorified).

In Piel, Pnal and Hithpael, Dagesh forte of the middle radical letter is lost, but in the greater num- ber of examples, particularly before H, n & V, the preceding vowel remains short, and the guttural has Dagesh forte implicitum, or Dagesh forte implied, e. g.

On the Preterite oe Kae. 1. Third Person Masculine. In the verbs middle E (§ 8. rem. 1) this characteristic vowel remains also before the suffix, as ^\\)% De. 7. 13; 15. 16; 23. 6, from Sr^ ; D^> Le. 16. 4 ; HW De. 24. 3. 2. Third Person Feminine. The form fPtpp desig- nating the fern, has a twofold peculiarity — (a) it takes the suffixes which form a syllable by them- selves (*3, \\ 'in, n, -13, D3, |3) without a union- vow el, though itself ends with a consonant ; (b) with the rest of the suffixes it indeed takes the union- vowel, but the tone is drawn back to the penultima, so that they appear in the shortened form **[—, D— , )—. E. g. tjnnnx she loves thee, Ru. 4. 15 ; *fp3?'^ ** has per- verted thee, Is. 47. 10; bflg*l^ $Ae 5wm5 Mem, Is. 47. 14; Drta«. ft consumes them, Ho. 2. 14; Dnn3| s^e AaJ stolen Mem, Ge. 31. 32 ; B^ny? it observes them, Ps. 119. 129 ; Dn«VD ft 6e/e# them, Ex. 18. 8; but on the contrary toljfgsj Ps. 73. 6. 3. In the suffix of the third person a kind of con- traction takes place, which may be compared with the form -13— for 'I\"\"1}—, viz. W1JI— contr. ^t, and Hfl— contracted from £^T. In the masculine both occur, the contracted and uncontracted form, as •inrr?<?2: sJie shoivs him, Pr. 31. 12; -in?D| she weaned him, 1 Sa. 1. 24; -inrDDp Is. 59. 16, comp. Ge. 37. 20 ; 1 Sa. 18. 28, and to3Jj Job 21. 18, comp. Ru. 4. 15. With the suffix of the feminine only the contracted form exists, nn]n$ Je. 49. 24 ; Is. 34. 17. For \"3^- -13Jp- r\\T}- the pause exhibits Vry- &c, c. g. \"»3n^S: Ps. 69. 10; «$*»? Nu. 20. 14;' *j£3^. Ca. 8. 5 (where ?1^?D in the first member of the sentence is so pointed for the sake of consonance). 4. The Second Person Masculine assumes in all cases the form fi?Pi?, wherefore the suffix has no union-vowel, except with the suffix of the 1 and 2 pers. sing, masc, where sometimes w?QP appears as the ground-form, and so to it is attached the suffix C?T, 1) by its union-vowel. Hence s3ri^n thou searchest me, Ps. 139. 1 ; ^fiPlD. thou hast overcome me, Je. 20. 7 (elsewhere, however, ^IIV. Ps. 22. 2); ifif 9*^ thou (j a 1.1 wrest him, 2 Ki. 5, 6, comp. Nu. 23.27; Ps. 89. 44; Hab. 1. 12 (elsewhere also •inrns:? Eze. 43. 20). 5. Second Person Feminine. All the forms ex- hibited in the paradigm assume the ground-form *fl?9i?, so that the suffix has no union- vowel. *— is often written defectively, as ^\"Tr* thou hast borne me, Je. 15. 10 ; comp. Ca. 4. 9; 1 Sa.\"l9. 17. The form WPi?, however, occurs also with suffixes which have the union- vowel, as-13Fl*7?j thou hast brought us forth, Je. 2. 27 ; Jos. 2. 17 ; Ca. 5. 9 (for (>) in the final syllable comp. § 8. rem. 1 b). 6. All the persons of the plural follow one rule, as all the verbal forms end here alike in -1, and the suffixes have therefore no union- vowel. These are frequently written defectively, as Snjgh^ \\ q^ 13. 3? which, of course, is immaterial. II. On the In-eenttive oe Kae. 7. The shortened form s®P is found most fre- quently before the suffixes B3 & |3, &?••?- y°w eating, Ge. 3. 5, E3*1E>^ your saying, Mai. 1.7; somewhat less frequent are forms like ErmjJ De. 27. 4 ; DD\"1VI? Le. 23. 22. The same inconstancy is found before the suff. *[, e. g. T$)} thy passing over, De. 29. 11 ; TO^ thy hearing, 2 Ki. 22. 19 ; but also T\\$V. Ob. 1 1 ; ^?$ Ge. 2. 17. There is also a form TO? Le. 23. 22, which agrees with E?1VP in the same verse. 8. When the middle letter is a guttural it takes (t:) instead of simple Sheva, e. g. nn3 my choosing, Eze. 20. 5 ; MnK their loving, Ho. 9.10; and in the 2 pers,, Kamets-Hhatuph, as CDDKD Is. 30. 12, and so also (with 1) MfJ? De. 20. 2.' 9. An anomalous form, otherwise found with guttural (comp. § 13. rem. 12) is QJSXfa for lDNV^1 Ge. 32. 20. In the same way some ex- plain the form DDipKfa for D3pg>| Am. 5. 11 ; this, however, may be regarded as a form of Poel (§ 6. No. 1). 10. The inf. ?®p assumes with suffix the form h^ (comp. § 35. rem. 10), also ?P5, with CD only the form ?£i? is used. As WIS my opening, Eze. 37.13; Dyp? their cleaving, Am. 1.13; )*W? to hinder him, Zee. 3. 1 ; ^VPI thy stamping, Eze. 25-6; DD?3nJ> to be gracious to you, Is. 30. 18. With the middle guttural toj?B? to drive him on, Ju. 13. 25. Sect. XVI.] REGULAR VERB WITH SUFFIXES. 31 III. On the Imperative oe Kal. 11. Examples are — ■?!?£ remember me, Je. 15. 15; •inD\"n pursue him, Ps. 34. 15 ; 03^)3 wnYe them, Pr. 3. 3 ; n\">V3 (with euphonic Dagesh) preserve them, Pr. 4. 13, or (in the other form of the suffix) like nnria Is. 30. 8. \"When a guttural happens to be in the final syl- lable, the vowel of the final syllable is retained and lengthened to Kamets, as *3#DI£> hear me, Ge. 23. 11 ; WW hear #> JoD 5- 27 ; ?2?$ love her\\ Pr- 4- 6- Plur'. WW hear me, Ge. 23.8; ^iW ash me, Is. 45. 11. IV. On the Future of Kae. 12. The verbs future A (§ 8. rem. 13), to which belong all those with 2nd and 3rd radical guttural, retain this A-sound in the sing, and pi., and besides, lengthen Pattahh to Kamets ; e. g. *3t$a?* he will clothe me, Job 29. 14 ; DK>3^. Ex. 29. 30, comp. Ca. 5. 3 ; n|n3?& De. 28. 30; mW- Ex- 6- 125 '^D8J Ge. 29. 32, comp. also Job 22. 27 ; Je. 42. 5. PJw. «lA«J» they pollute him, Job 3. 5 ; ^3* Is. 62. 5 ; •in^m; Job 20. 8, &c. An example, where this is not the case, is \"H^fcO and I shod thee, Eze. 16. 10. Afew examples are already given above (§ 8. rem. 14) in which there are some traces left of the O-sound, either by (t:) or -1 , in the final syllable before suffix. 13. Besides the union-vowel, there is another mode of connecting the suffix with the verbal form, by means of an inserted 3 or the syllable 3—, 3—, 3—, commonly called epenthetic Nun. It is found only with the future before the suffix of the singular, and usually in pause. E. g. <,J^*T.55'1 he will honour me, Ps.50.23; ^m Iwillpluck'thee,Je.22.24:; WflJJE he passes over it, Je. 5. 22 ; ■liljD'iy. he will bless him, Ps. 72. 15, comp. De. 32. 10 ; Ex'. 15. 2. This 3 is for the most part assimilated to the suffix, and hence the separate form of the suffixes with epenthetic Nun in the paradigm. 14. By a Syriacism, the suffixes are sometimes attached, without a union-vowel, to the form j-vlpj?* with the paragogic Nun. E. g. *35jtOj?* they shall call me, Pr. 1.28; ^3-IKSp* ibid. ; V^W\\ they shall praise thee, Ps. 63. 4; ^Trgfr. they shall serve thee, Is. 60. 7, 10; *flJ3?2! it shall pass it, Je. 5. 22; \\&X$?\\ they shall tale him, Pr. 5. 22 ; £3-1 &*¥?*. they shall find her, Je. 2. 24. With a union-vowel occurs *33-1K31* they crush me, Job 19. 2, for which Athias's bible reads *33-1tf|n* more consistently with analogy. . V. On Piel and Hiphil with Sueeix. 15. Examples of Piel are — Pret. 1V?i? he gathers thee, De. 30. 3 ; ^3\"}3 he blesses thee, De. 2. 7. Inf. B3PD1 your pitying, Is. 30. 18 ; E3!p\"lS your spreading out, Is. 1. 15; 03*?-^ your destroying, Eze. 5. 16. Fat. *J¥?J2 he will gather thee,~De. 30. 4; tI^PS I will pollute thee, Eze. 28. 16 ; ^?D'K I will gather thee, 2 Ki. 22. 20; Q3V^X«: / will strengthen you, Job 16. 5. Part. DJgKjM? who sanctifies you, Ex. 31. 13. The same is observed in Poel, e. g. ^JPP'H&S / will extol thee, Is. 25. 1.
