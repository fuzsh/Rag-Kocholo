        "text": "West Virginia Public Broadcasting's public affairs program, The Legislature Today, has been providing vital information about local politics to its viewers for over two decades. The program was started by longtime host Beth Vorhees in 1994 to cover legislative updates.\n\nThe Legislature Today is currently the only live television show covering the West Virginia Legislature. The program consists of reports from the Senate, House and committee meetings with in-depth interviews and analysis of the legislative process in West Virginia.\n\nDuring the program, host Ashton Marra, interviews lawmakers and lobbyists about issues. She also leads a roundtable discussion focused on the top stories of the week with her colleagues from the Capitol press corps.\n\nThe program is an extremely useful political resource for the local community. Thanks to The Legislature Today, lawmakers and their families are able to stay informed about legislative news. Lobbyists also use the program to track how legislation is moving.\n\nIn January 2016, West Virginia Public Broadcasting aired a new television and online channel called \"The West Virginia Channel.\" The channel combines live coverage of The Legislature Today with other public affairs programming.\n\nThe Legislature Today can be seen weeknights on:\n\n6:30 p.m. - WVPB (main channel)\n\n10 p.m. - The West Virginia Channel\n\n11:30 p.m. - WVPB\n\n6:30 a.m. (next day) - The West Virginia Channel\n\nThe Legislature Today can also be heard at 6:30 p.m. weeknights on WVPB's statewide radio network.\n\nYou can watch an episode of The Legislature Today below:"
