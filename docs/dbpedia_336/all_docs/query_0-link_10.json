I am a firm believer in independent, non-commercial community radio.\n\nThe most interesting and creative radio in North America is invariably found over on the left-hand side of the dial, those frequencies between 87 and 92 mHz that in the U.S. are reserved for educational, community and noncommercial use. No matter where you are, if you twiddle your dial over on the left, you're bound to find good, eclectic radio programming, an oasis from the vast wasteland that is commercial radio in this country. If you're hitting the road, find those stations here!\n\nNOTE to radio station webmasters: While compiling this list, I was astonished at the number of radio stations that do not list their broadcast frequency on their web sites. This is essential information, folks! Don't forget!\n\nIf you have any additions or changes -- stations not listed here, or further descriptions and/or web pages of stations that are listed here, out-of-date links (remember, this is a one-man operation and I can't keep on top of all this by myself) -- please e-mail them to me. I especially seek listings for independent radio from outside North America. We hope to make this the Web's most comprehensive and detailed listing of non-commercial radio stations!\n\nClick on the state or province abbreviation for a shortcut, or view listings for stations outside North America.\n\nA couple of other abbreviations explained: NPR = National Public Radio, the largest public radio network in the U.S.; PRI = Public Radio International, a rival network which was originally called American Public Radio after its split from NPR.\n\nJump quickly to a North American state, territory or province:\n\nAB AL AK AR AZ BC CA CO CT DC DE FL GA HI IA ID IL IN KS KY LA MA MB MD ME MI MN MO MS MT NB NC ND NE NF NH NJ NM NS NU NV NW NY OH OK ON OR PA QC RI SC SD SK TN TX UT VA VI VT WA WI WV WY\n\nAMARC - The World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters.

That DJ and the other community and student volunteers on site were then escorted off the premises by campus police. Having secretly decided to sell the station, USF President Stephen A. Privett entered into a complex three-party arrangement with USC and corporate broadcasting giant Entercom. The KUSF license was sold without public hearing or notice, even to USF students or faculty. Our object is to support the preservation of the KUSF FCC license as a local, diverse, Non-Commercial Educational (NCE) station serving its San Francisco Community of License.
