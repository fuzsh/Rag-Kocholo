Take all the attributes you are supposed to associate with Rock 'n Roll: glamour, excitement, being cool, being hip, being \"in\" - and get rid of it. What's left is us. a trio of accountants who figured out a way to make Marshall stacks tax deductable and went with it.-------- Andre Nobels-The musical journey started early for Andr� Nobels. He remembers listening to his father requite 60�s folk tunes on his old Gibson acoustic, creating magic out of thin air. Andr� picked up the guitar early but was unable to attain the depth he felt in his father at this young age. This was not the end of his musical journey but rather the beginning of a deep discovery which fuels the passion behind his creative force today.----------- Michael Sadler- The long-standing mouthpiece for Canadian prog legends Saga steps into the limelight with his first official solo album. Michael Sadler's rich baritone voice is reminiscent of a modern-day Scott Walker or a toned-down Michael Crawford; and now, after 20 years of handling vocal duties across the world stage, Sadler is singing his own song. ------------- Allan Estabillo- is a native to Toronto Canada. From a young age Allan was always enchanted by music. His first record player was given to him at the age of six � a Fischer Price orange and white record player that was virtually indestructible . It was here that Allan fell in love with �oldies� from the 40s, 50s and 60s. Allan attributes much of his current musical taste and influence largely to the music that surrounded him as a child � mostly 80s hits from The Cure, The Smiths, U2 and many other rock and roll hits. Additionally, Allan is an avid visual artist working in both traditional media and new media. --- Digital Leprechaun is highly old skool influenced, featuring off time beats, super basslines, funky grooves, dark sides, rich keys, variety and clearly just damn good drum and bass. New to the Drum and Bass scene, influenced by such great DnB/Jungle DJ/Producers as; Kenny Ken, ShyFX, Capital J, Andy C, Micky Finn and DJ Saigon. On another note, I'd like to hear any feedback from other Drum 'N Bass listeners out there. The more reviews the sooner i can release crazier tracks. -------------- Peter Bowen- The music is best described as contemporary folk rock music that has been compared to Tom Waits, Lou Reed, Donovan and Leonard Cohen. He also works in spoken word and visual expressions both moving and stills. ------------ >Cretins Radio- Pop Rock- and Talk- Moonlyn- The Plath- Andre Nobels- Bit Rock Alumnae- Bachelor of Nothing- Crystal Pontes- Marla Zinger- Cavern- Louden- Chris Field- Adam and Annette- The Charge- Reckon with One- Eternal Instinct- Emily Fennell- Heart and Stone- Emotions Deserted- Rudely Awakened- Christine Donovan- In Silent Code- Cuff the Duke- The Prosthetic Band- Ripped- The Divine- Money Money- Dharma Road- Cat Sass- Pat Johnson- Strub- Boobie Browne- Dendt- Ronn James- Dee Jay Scootz- The Populars- The Frontier Index- Immaculate Machine- The Hustlers- Girl Nobody- The Exchanges- Logan Seed- Scarlet Sins- Osmosis- The Thurstons- Dropping Poppies- Linda Grenier- Ian North- Royal Wood- Osmosis- Pete Kyrie Band- The Rails- Laid Out- Diamond Back- Snoovy- Ripped- Julie Ann Bertran- Tanisha Taitt- The John Henry's- Bakersfield- Skin- All that was Left- Southern Drifters- Lucas Stagg- Manic- The Flashback Band- Breadfan- Driving Lester- Emma Cook - Eternal Bliss- Jerry Can - Jonny Atomic- Luke Andrews - Matt Hryhorsky- Simple- SOWATT- Suni Clay- Terror Lake-Kick Ass Music - The Entrophy - This - TWYG- Vegalite - Fembots - d-sisive - Space Elevator - Steve Strongman - Hidden Agenda - Mad Dogs and Englishman - Blush - Fluid - Jack Dekeyzer - David Rotundo - Grant Lyle - JP Cormier - Form One - Weber Brothers - Anti Hero - Peter 0'Lasch- The Rizdales - Freedom Train - Absolute Whores - Priya Thomas - Poised for the Worm - August - Annattie - Soul Stir - Breathe - Lilia -little Sunday - Convertible Robots - The Silver Hearts - Boy Ballz - The Cretins - Wall Paper - Jon Raven - Len - Utopia Complex- The Weekend- Shannon Weir- Wheels on the Bus- Wintary- Bob Wiseman- The Young Ideas- Jason Bajada- The Barcelona Pavilion Barmitzvah Brothers- Beef Terminal- The Bicycles- Lost by an Echo - Heather Dale - Faith Down- Bryan Sorensen- Tim Isherwood- Julie Crochetiere- PGQ- Linda M- Sarah Kamin- Distant Minds - Walkers Line - Eternal Instinct - Surface Rising - 5th Projekt - Ensuing Silence - Pimpinella - Alex Pangman - In Silent Code - Hill - Stink Ditch - All Stream - Birchview Park Symphonic- The Blameshifter- Boy Ballz- Brian Borcherdt aka Hot Carl aka Holy Fuck- Bit_Rock Alumnae- Obsidian - Stereo Lights - Lorraine Davies - High Holy Days - Paul Brown - 3 Dog Funhouse - The Chosen - Suburbanhermits - zombie fuck - Flat Planet - Ken Brown - Linda Feijo - facade - if nothing - Exact Match - The Exchanges- Fat Cats- Lindy- Paul Barnes - Natasha Kinne - Nelly Shin - The Chrome Yellow Co. - MC Lenny - Radiation K - Candle Light Opera - Eleven Moves - 54 Stance - Shroom Jaw - Tara Oram - Mark Inside - HeAdCaSe - Manic - Scarlet Sins - Brian Macmillan - Cosmic Juice - Never Odd or Even - Steve St. Pierre - Lucid - The Whythouse - Schmange - Cankerworm - Death Pod - Lauren Elfman - Strap-On Tools - Grindig - Trish Bentley - Unit 404 - GM Patterson - Evan Paul- Danny Noronha - Sheldon Baker & Western Star - Adlai Waxman- Moulann- Tier 3- Mind of a Squid- The Kinetics- Angerkain- Frazmosis- Sharon Musgrave- John McConnach- Blazin G- Em and Val- Kathleen McLeod- Zugha- Torn Down Units- Gash- Dylan Wickens- The 78's- Cody Allen- Peter X Anthony- Kazak- Pat Savage- 40 til 5- Lenore- Dave Munkhoff- By Divine Right- Forgery- Artificial Humanity- The Burne- Kat Burns- Chaos for Comfort- Class Riot- Dada Pogrom- Down Right Wrong- Eternal Instinct- Explicity Human- Five Star Trailer Park- Forseen Dilemma- The Fortunates- Half Cab Hailee- Korrie Hall- INITY- Ronn James- Lost Souls Division- No Real Message- Par 3 Quartet- Pirri- Sherry- Nelly Shin- Ace Face- The Adopted- Afflatus- Annekes Star- Aphasia- Ariel's Worm- Mike Audet- The Backstabbers- Aidan Baker- Bare Rump- Marko Partanen- Barzin- Beautiful 2000- Howie Beck- Hennie Bekker- Mike Blackmore Project- CORPUSSE- Cougar Party- Simple Roots- The Spades- The Spares- TSB Band- Underfire- Universal Habit- The Vendettaz- Convertible Robots- The Crawling Kingsnakes-\n\nToronto Actors\n\nSusan Aceron- Doug Guthrie- Naomi Vondell- Dylan Ramsey- Eleonora Barna- Therasa Tova- Hunter Phoenix- Josh Holliday- Julie Laine- Toby Malone-\n\nAnnual Events and Festivals\n\nBarrie Jazz and Blues Festival- Beaches Jazz Festival- Canadian Music Week- Distellery Jazz Festival- Toronto Jazz- Festival of Friends- Ottawa Folk Festival- Limestone City Blues- Markam Jazz Festival- New Market Folk and Blues- North By Northeast- Open Eye Festival- Orangeville Blues and Jazz- Thunder Bay Blues Festival- Toronto Urban Music Festival- Eagle Wood Folk Festival-\n\nLive Music Clubs Toronto\n\nC'est What- Rivoli- Cadillac Lounge - Healey's -Rock Bar/Club 178 Bathurst St. Toronto, ON M5V2R4 Phone: (416) 703-5882 - Guvernment Entertainment Complex 132 Queens Quay E.
