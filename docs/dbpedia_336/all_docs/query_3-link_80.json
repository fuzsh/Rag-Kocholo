Clayton Burch. “The school closure has required us to be creative, flexible and focused on meeting the needs of our children, and I am grateful for West Virginia Public Broadcasting, and their enthusiasm for helping us meet this need.”\n\n\"We are excited to be collaborating with the West Virginia Department of Education in providing an educational resource in this time of need,\" said West Virginia Public Broadcasting Executive Director Chuck Roberts. \"Our mission is to educate, inspire, and inform using our statewide television, radio, and digital network and we are so pleased to work with the WVDE in providing this essential at-home learning service. The hope is that we can help keep teachers and students connected and engaged during this unprecedented time.\"\n\nWest Virginia Public Broadcasting, or WVPB, is available on many cable systems throughout the state, as well was over-the-air.\n\nThe WV Dept. of Education has compiled for resources for educators and families on\n\n, including both technology-driven and screen-free options for grades pre-k through 12.\n\nIn addition to the resources available through the WVDE, West Virginia Public Broadcasting has dedicated a page to the COVID-19 pandemic with information, including additional educational resources, at\n\n."
