        "text": "Thursday, June 13, 2024 | Leipziger People's Newspaper\n\n\"... The lively, very modern, very self-confident Bach that the Malaysians are bringing to the west gallery of St. Thomas Church need not fear international comparison. This is already clear from the first notes of the motet \"Komm, Jesu, komm\". Delicate, immaculately intoned, clearly articulated, smoothly phrased and as intelligent as it is boldly dynamic.\n\nChin integrates the space into his design and places the first of the two choirs on the parapet as a soloist. This compensates for the difference to the second choir, which has multiple members, but does not take away the individuality of the colors. The result is a rounded, yet transparently differentiated, magnificently bright and very eloquent sound.\n\nThey are all about death - but Chin lets the light shine out from the delicately dancing strings and the wonderful oboes d'amore. This is how music is made with content - which sensitively plays around and entwines, illuminates and interprets the choir, which is also fabulous in the cantatas.\n\n... A completely unexotic, first-class concert – and a strong argument for re-inviting David Chin and his Bach ensembles from Malaysia.\"\n\n[Read the full article in German]\n\nMay 24, 2024 | BFM Radio Station | Juliet Jacobs\n\nIn June, Malaysia's Bach Festival Singers and Orchestra are set to be the first ensemble from Southeast Asia to be invited to perform in the most prestigious and important Bach landmarks in Germany: St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, Bach Church in Arnstadt, as well as St. George's Church in Eisenach. The grand concert tour commences with two fundraising concerts right here in Kuala Lumpur. We catch up with Dr David Chin, the Founder and Artistic Director of Bachfest Malaysia, who is also the Director of the Bach Collegium and Music Professor at Augustana University in Sioux (SOO) Falls, South Dakota, and a Senior Fellow of the Bach Archive in Leipzig, Germany, to find out more about the programme in these fundraising concerts.\n\n[Listen to the podcast]\n\nMay 12, 2023 | BFM 89.9 | Juliet Jacobs\n\n​As the saying goes, get them when they're young, and Bachfest Malaysia - an organisation dedicated towards promoting the music of J. S. Bach in Malaysia and beyond through performance and education - are planning just that. The group are holding their first-ever family concert called Hello, Mr. Bach! which has been specially designed for children, where they will meet and interact with “Mr. Bach” through storytelling and live music performances. David who is the Founder, Conductor and Artistic Director of Bachfest Malaysia will be playing the titular role, and he joins us to share more.\n\n[Listen to the podcast]\n\nMarch 17, 2023 | BFM 89.9 | Juliet Jacobs\n\nThis year marks Johann Sebastian Bach’s 338th birthday - he was born on the 31st of March, 1685. To celebrate, Malaysia's renowned artists soprano Ang Mei Foong and pianist Ng Chong Lim will join the Malaysia Bach Festival Orchestra led by international conductor Dr. David Chin in a concert called All Things New, performing two solo cantatas and keyboard concertos.

Aside from the concert, world-renowned Bach scholar Prof. Dr. Michael Maul will be providing pre-concert lectures, and the concert tour is also the official book launch for Michael’s Chinese/English version of the Bach Pictorial Biography. We find out more about this from Dr. David Chin and Prof. Dr. Michael Maul. Both gentlemen share their love and appreciation of the music of seventeenth century German composer, Johann Sebastian Bach and why we should too.\n\n[Listen to the podcast]\n\nCiTiZEN Magazine | October 2021\n\nTiggy Munnelly\n\nDavid made so many plans prior to the pandemic, such as preparing for a grand concert tour with the Malaysia Bach Festival Singers and Orchestra to three different cities in Central Germany and throughout Malaysia, organizing the first ever international Bach festival in South East Asia, and many other conducting engagements. Of course, the pause button had to be pressed on all these projects...\n\n​(click on the image to read more)\n\nWXXI Classical 91.5 | May 2021\n\n​Brenda Tremblay\n\nWhen David Chin graduated with Doctor of Musical Arts and Master of Music degrees from the Eastman School of Music, he embarked on a fascinating journey which has so far carried him from small town America to the sophisticated urban centers of Malaysia.\n\nEverywhere he goes, he carries with him a fierce passion for the music of J.S. Bach.\n\n[Read more]\n\n​October 15, 2019 | CiTi-ZEN Magazine\n\n​Tiggy Munnelly\n\nThe image of a maestro is that of someone who is autocratic, serious – and old! Award-winning David Chin is the epitome of the 21st century maestro – dynamic, articulate, exuberant and, above all, young! He is very passionate about the music of seventeenth century German composer, Johann Sebastian Bach – so much so that David started Bachfest Malaysia in 2015 to promote the music of Bach in Malaysia and beyond. To understand this passion, we need to start at the beginning.\n\nRead the entire story.\n\n​March 20, 2019 | Eastman Journal\n\nDavid Raymond\n\nDavid Chin ‘18E (DMA) recalls that when he started as an Eastman student, he knew little of Bach’s music other than keyboard pieces. After repeated exposure and performances he calls himself “a missionary, an evangelist for Bach, especially for the beauty of his vocal music. Music like his can go deep down into your life.”\n\nDavid’s “missionary work” has included bringing performances of Bach’s music to his native Malaysia, with an award-winning group called BachFest Malaysia which he founded in 2015. The group has made great progress in a short time, performing concerts of cantatas, the Saint John and Saint Matthew Passions, and other Bach masterpieces in Southeast Asia, sometimes for the first time. Bachfest Malaysia will be traveling to the Leipzig Bach Festival in the summer of 2020 – singing Bach’s music in the city where he lived and worked for much of his life.\n\n[read more]\n\n​FEBRUARY 2019 | PIN PRESTIGE MALAYSIA FASHION AND LIFESTYLE MAGAZINE\n\n​TEXT BY TRACY LOW\n\n​\n\nWho the heck is David Chin?

The conductor and singer, of the upcoming performance, take us on a journey to understand this sacred work, and how it gave new form to vocal music.
