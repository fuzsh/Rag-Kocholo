        "text": "CHARLESTON — The state board that oversees West Virginia Public Broadcasting and its educational and journalism programming could be weakened under legislation now before the House of Delegates.\n\nSenate Bill 844, redesignating the Educational Broadcasting Authority as the Educational Broadcasting Commission, passed the state Senate last Friday in a 30-4 vote after having just been introduced four days earlier. The bill is now in the House and awaiting consideration by the House Government Organization Committee.\n\nWhile its title suggests only the name of the EBA would change, SB 844 makes substantial changes to how the board would function in the future. The bill would reduce the number of board members for the renamed EBA from 11 to nine members, including reducing the number of members appointed by the governor from seven to five and reducing their terms from seven to five years.\n\nWhile the new Educational Broadcasting Commission would still select its own chairperson and secretary, the power to select a new executive director to oversee the functions of West Virginia Public Broadcasting (WVPB) would be put in the hands of the curator of the Department of Arts, Culture, and History — a position that could be renamed to cabinet secretary in separate legislation. A request for comment from Curator Randall Reid-Smith was not returned.\n\nThe EBA held an emergency meeting Tuesday afternoon to discuss SB 844. Reid-Smith said the bills are merely “organizational chart moves.”\n\n“All it does is a name change, from the authority to the commission. That’s what that does,” Reid-Smith said. “The one issue that a lot of people had was that the cabinet secretary would appoint the director of the commission … it is an organizational change within the org chart of the department.”\n\n“It probably goes a bit further than just that,” said Bill File, chairman of the EBA. “If you become cabinet secretary, you would basically oversee Public Broadcasting … the authority would no longer be the employer of the executive director.”\n\nReid-Smith said SB 844 would simplify and streamline the board structure within the Department of Arts, Culture, and History. The renamed EBA would provide advice and consent to the cabinet secretary, but EBA members questioned the need for the bill, why the board membership was being reduced, and who requested it.\n\n“Streamlined for who? I can’t imagine it’s any easier for the state,” said member Carol Rotruck. “What’s the value of streamlining or eliminating a couple of board member positions?”\n\n“I didn’t write the bill,” Reid-Smith said. “I can ask the Governor’s Office.”\n\n“Under this new scenario, the person who is the director is basically a will and pleasure appointee of the secretary … but then the day-to-day operations — whether it is the newsroom, the education department, whatever it is — the director would report to the secretary,” said authority member Tom Susman. “This is more than just needing an organizational change. This is a departure from public policy.”\n\nAccording to WVPB’s 2023 annual report, more than 35% — or more than $3.8 million of its funding — comes from state tax dollars, with more than 18% ($1.9 million) coming from federal sources and more than 46% ($4.9 million) coming from private donations. West Virginia is one of nine states that directly fund their public broadcasting systems.\n\nWVPB is supported by two groups: the West Virginia Public Broadcasting Foundation and the Friends of West Virginia Public Broadcasting. The foundation handles major gifts, grants and awards, while the Friends of WVPB handle annual membership donations. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting also provides grants to WVPB.\n\nElliot Hicks, the chairman of the Friends of West Virginia Public Broadcasting, raised concerns about being able to raise needed private funds and sustaining members for WVPB. He said taking away the firewall of the EBA between Public Broadcasting and the Governor’s Office could make it harder to receive private support.\n\n“We have to solicit donations from people, and people aren’t really willing to give donations to state government,” Hicks said. “This looks like it’s being taken so firmly under the wing of state government that I think that is what it’s going to look like to people.”\n\nSome members raised concerns about state funding being pulled from WVPB. Gov. Jim Justice had considered cutting the EBA’s funding in 2017 after taking office, but that funding was restored in the fiscal year 2018 budget.\n\n“I think we’re kind of duty-bound to make sure that people know – eyes wide open – what this means,” Susman said. “Randall, is what you’re saying is if this bill doesn’t pass, the governor’s going to cut $4 million out of our budget?”\n\n“I didn’t say that, Tom. Don’t put words into my mouth,” Reid-Smith said. “The governor has never advocated to cut Public Broadcasting.”\n\nDrama has surrounded the selection of an executive director for West Virginia Public Broadcasting which consists of three TV stations and 12 FM radio stations, as well as multiple digital channels available on most cable networks. WVPB has been a mainstay in the state for more than 50 years, following the motto of “Telling West Virginia’s Story.”\n\nWVPB includes an award-winning news division; popular programs, such as West Virginia Morning, Inside Appalachia, Us and Them, and The Legislature Today; the internationally acclaimed live music program Mountain Stage with host Kathy Mattea; and numerous radio, TV, and documentary programming. WVPB also focuses on educational programming and services in cooperation with the Department of Education and the Higher Education Policy Commission.\n\nEddie Isom, who previously served as chief operating officer and director of programming, was appointed interim executive director of WVPB last August after former WVPB executive director Butch Antolini resigned suddenly.\n\nThe EBA hired Antolini as interim WVPB executive director in October 2021. He replaced Chuck Roberts after the EBA fired Roberts that same month. Antolini was officially made CEO and executive director in December 2021.\n\nAntolini was communications director for Justice for most of Justice’s first term beginning in 2017. He later worked behind-the-scenes for the Executive Branch Communications Hub at the Department of Commerce’s headquarters, leaving that role in March 2021. Antolini was a former newspaper editor and publisher, and a communications director for former agricultural commissioner Walt Helmick from 2013 to 2017.\n\nAntolini came under scrutiny in December 2022 after the firing of a WVPB reporter who accused him of removing her from coverage of the formerly-named Department of Health and Human Resources due to pressure from former DHHR Cabinet Secretary Bill Crouch over her reporting of numerous issues at one of the state’s psychiatric hospitals.\n\nLast March, the EBA held an emergency meeting that went into executive session. Authority members met with Antolini behind closed doors to discuss several personnel issues during his tenure, but no actions were taken against Antolini at that time. Prior to Antolini’s resignation, sources said the Legislature’s Commission on Special Investigations had been looking into WVPB and Antolini, though the commission is unable to confirm or deny active investigations."
