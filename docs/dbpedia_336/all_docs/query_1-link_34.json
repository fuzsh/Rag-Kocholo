THE LATTER HAY SAINTS* ; ■you, I am' with him, and my hand shall be oyer 'him; and the keys which l have given unto him, \\ and also to youward, shall not be taken from him , till I come. ] Verily I say unto you, my servant Thomnd, , thou art the man whom I have chosen to hold , the keys of my kingdom (os pertaining to the , twelve) abroad aniong all nations, that thou mayeftbo my servant to unlock the door of (lie j kingdom in all places where my servant Joseph, , and iny servant Sidney, and n»y Hervant Hyrutn, cannot come; for on them have 1 laid the hurtli* | en of all the churches for a little season: where- fore whithersoever they shall send you, go ye, and I will be with you, and in whatsoever place ye shall proclaim my name, an effectual door shall be opened untoyou, (hut they may receive my word; whosoever receiveth iny word receiv- etu me, and whosoever recei\\elb me, rcceiv. eth those (the first presidency) whom I have j sent, whom I have made counsellors for iny name's sake unto you.” ; j Still it is said “ abroad among all na- tions'” and in the 12th paragraph the su- premacy of the First Presidency is set forth, as woll as the subordination of the Twelve, thus: '* For unto you (the twelve) and those (the first presidency) who are appointed w ith you to be your counsellors and your leaders, is the pow- .or of f his .priesthood given for the last days, and for the last time, in the which is the dispensation | of the fullness of times, which power y.uii hold in j connection with alLthose who liavo received a .dispensation ut any time, from the beginning of Creation: for verily I say unto you the keys oft lie dispensation which ye have received, have come down from the Fathers: and last of ull, being sent down from heaven unto you.” Tne 12th paragraph of Sec. 3d alrca- j ,dy inserted, expressly says that the Twelve act under the direction of the .First Presidency. Much more might be said in support of this position, but the foregoing must suffice for the present, for I want to present to you several other joints or subjects of equal importance, in a brief manner. On the subj ect of Joseph Smith having informed the Twelve that they must bear Off this kingdom to the nations, I an- swer there was no necessity of his re- peating this admonition to them, inas- much as the Lord made this duty obliga* tory upon them by repeated revelations through him; but the Lord never said through Joseph that they should he lead- ers without a head or First Presidency. They assert that the burden of the church was put on them by Joseph. To this 1 reply, they shall have it with all good .^feelings on my part; but then 1 say we have not made it, (the burden,) conse- quently we will not have it. Now sir, j just read the 3d paragraph of 101st see. ! of Book of Covenants. “But verily 1 say unto you, I have decreed that your brethren which have been scattered* shall return to the land of their inheritances, and build up the waste pluces of Zion; so after much tribulation, ns I have said unto you in a former commandment, c'ometh the blessing. Behold^ this is the blessing which I have promised after your, tribulations, and the tribulations of your brethren: your redemption, and the redemption of your brethren; even their restoration to the land of Zion, to bo esfablbhed, no more to be thrown down; nevertheless if they pollute their inheritances, they shall be thrown down, for I w ill not spare them if they pollute their inher- itances. Behold 1 say unto you, the redemp- tion of Zion must come by power; therefore, 1 will raise up unto iny people a man, who shall lead them like as Mose s led the chib, (lien of Israel, for you are the children of Israel, l and of the seed of' Abraham, and ye must need [be led Out of bonduge by power, and with up j outstretched arm: and as your l athers were- led at the first, even so shall .the redemption of Zion be. Therefore, let not your hearts taint,, for 1 say not unto you as 1 said unto your Fat hern, mine angel shall go up before y m, but not -my presence; but I say unto you, mine tuigelH shall go before you, and aim) mV presence, and in time ye shall possess the goodly land. 17 Iti this you. discover that this society of Saints arc. termed the children of Is- | r:\\el, and the seed of Abraham: and now ! compare this with the 23d chap, ot Jer., and lest you should think it docs not ap- ply to this dispensation and people, read carefully the lihh and 20th verses, and mark: “In the latter days ye shall con-. shier it perfectly;” and’ then, to satisfy. I yourself about the burden ol the church, and what it is, read and mark it well from the 23rd verse to the end of the chapter, and I trust it will solve the mys- tery to your entire satisfaction: and then read the whole of the 31th chap, ol Eze- kiel, and mark every word as you pro- ceed, as carefully as though your eternal salvation depended upon it: take partic- ular notice of the concluding sentence of the 4th Verse, “with force and cruelty have ye ruled them ” Ami then examine the 3d and 4th chapters of Isaiah. The first three verses of the 3d chap, tell who the Lord will take away from Jerusalem. (I wiU just say perhaps you will see its application upon Nauvoo fulfilled.) The subsequent part of the chapter tells an awful tale about oppression — the spoil of the poor — the beating of the people to pieces — the sin of Sodom, which was more particularly tvhoredorn ; also wo- men rule over them, the princes, and if you please, the Twelve and others: and mark what is said about the daiighters ol ZLou, and their corruptions; and alter iffrtf f u* : , MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE. _ the Lord positively mentions the horrible | disease which usually follows such abom - ination, ami also the judgment of Clod upon the in. ' In the first verse of the 4th chapter, no* tells a tale about the poor dupes among women in ilieso days ol trouble, .who i wish to lie called by lhu name of their.He- dneers to take vvway their reproneli. This was the ancient law. ol Israel; when a man seduced a woman, lie had to take her: but query, was lie blessed o r cursed? refuseth to submit to the laws of theland, even io tbc laying down of his life, is not , niy disciple.” ; • • - I will now call your attention.yto t'JVft RUi chapter of Isaiah; in the first verse. Wc have an. account ot a father and son, not much, however, is said about the fath- er, but a great dent about the sin-..

Be not ashamed neither confounded; but bo admonished in all your high mindedness and pride, for it bringeth a snare upon your souls. Set. in order your houses; keep sloth- fulness an uncleanness far from you/* Now, I ask where is the school of the prophets organized by, 8. Higdon ? I an- swer it did not exist (mark, one organ! izetj by him,) at the death of Joseph. °In the 95th Sec. of the above book, para- graph 3d, we find he was called and or- dained to be a spokesman to the pie, &c. peo- theLord says in a revelation through Jo- seph, as follows: li And again, verily I say unto you, if my servant Sidney will serve me and bo counsellor to my. ser- vant Joseph, let him arise and come up and stand in the office of his calling, ami humble himself be- fore me; and if he will offer unto me an acceptable offering, and acknowledgments, and remuin with my people, behold, I the Lord your God will heal seph Smith ordained twelve men to the first presidency of the church, I answer peremptorily, that if he did so, he did it without permission from the Lord, for it is said in the Book of Cov., Sec. 14, Par. 2d: • ■ ' ■' \" 14 But verily, verily I say unto you, 'hat none else shall he appointed unto this gift except it be through him, for if it be taken from him he shall, not have power; except to appoint another in hia stead: and this shall be a law unto you, that ye re- ceive not the teachings of any that shall come be- fore you as revelations or commandments: and this I give unto you, tliat you may not be deceived, that you may know they ure not of me. For ver- ily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of mo shall come in at the gate and be ordained as-I have told you before, to teach those revelations which you have received, and shall receive through him whom I have appointed.” Does this authorize him to ordain twelve men to succeed him if he should be takon out of the way? No! no! no! but one. Now, query again, why did Joseph |j Smith ordain Sidney Rigdon more than Again, on the 408th page of this book, ! U™ • onlain'fefdncy Rigdon more than eLord savs in a revelation thrnnn-1. T,, J U lrp ? - VQ!ln ! !l \"° : . 1 answer, because the liim that he shall be healed; and he shall lift up |,i s !j a '> s «ncc of an assistant, am; voice again on the mountains, anu ho a spokesman i a,Jscnt > the other two, both or either of before my face.’ f them, shall net ill his stead. I think it h rom this you discover that the Lord ;| will be admitted to be a fact, that Joseph *}} [ } a calling, which is, i] is absent, and Sidney Rigdon is now the Lord was doing his own work, although at the time neither him nor Joseph under- stood the matter. Now Sir, the 6th par- agrapii of the 5th Sec. of Book Cov. says, || the president shall be appointed by rev- elation, and also acknowledged by the voice of the church, and in case of the absence of an assistant, and in case he be tha;t he, shall be a .spokesman before the Lord’s face, not Joseph Smith; and al- so this very remarkable promise, that he shall again Jilt up his voice upon the mountains. When lie comenced his ministry among the, Campbellites, it was among the mountains of Pennsylva- nia. Recollect that Nephi says, that a spokesman will the Lord raise up unto Joseph, who shall be mighty in word and in writing, and who shall carry the word of th? Lord to the fruit of his loins, (La- na an it es.) Has S. Rigdon ever done this? if not, must He not yet do it, or the word of God fails ? Yes verily. , Again, the Lord never raised up a sec- jj only man standing, in that office; conse- 1 quently the Lord will curse the people if they reject him. And now, after giving you such (testi- mony from the different books, as makes the case a perfectly plain one, as to the necessity of the continuation of the first presidency, and also who that president is, I will now remark to you that the ob- jection is presented at every step by the '1 welve and their adherants, that S. Rig- don i has not been faithful, but conspired against Joseph and the Church, As re- gards his being faithful, I will not assert that he was free from errors; and per- haps he was negligent with regard to the ^ \" i — ‘T * .naps whs negligent wim regaru to tne onu spokesman or ever took that office; discharge of his duty; but I answer, the .iun. Furthermore, we find in theji Lord has said he would scourge him, and prop eues, a great deal o I talk about the ’ I think it will not be pretended to the con- notise of the Lord in or on the mountains, j trary by any one that he has borne more °* j’ , I j persecution, slander, falsehoods, priva? Nom in regard to the sayings that Jo- ; tiers, and afflictions of various kinds, of Book Qf Coven ttiliO. sa\" ; : ; Y‘ * A' &'■ ; MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE. than most men in this age; at all events Joseph said that lie had. And as for Joseph saying he would have him no longer for counsellor, it was not his pre- rogative to shake him off; he did not call and consequently could not reject him, but at any rate we all know when he was tried before the conference last October, every thing, was there disposed of, and Elder Rigdon was sustained by the peo- pie and lionorably .acquitted of all charg- es against him; and Hiram then and there prophesied, that he should conquer and ! triumph over all his enemies, and that lie | should he a mighty mail on the earth. Now truly here is ii pix>p!uu;y : worthy of notice, and on this point I will only add, that two years will tell a tale* that will as- tonish the world; And as to .his having at any time conspired against the church and Joseph, is a baseless fabric built by the Twelve, and like that of all others who run before they were sent; therefore are not worthy of any rcplyV You may ! now ask what our views are relative to Joseph? to which I reply, just what the Lord has said about him, that lve should hold the keys which he had received, which were the keys of Elijah or in oth- er words the keys of the doctrine, hut we do not believe that he has ever received the keys of David, spoken of by John in | the 3d chap, of Rev. which opens and no uian closes, <$*c. Rut, enquires the ob- jector, you believe Joseph transgressed? answer, he himself confessed he was hut. a man and liable to sin like oilier men. ut, says one, do you believe that he was cut off for transgression? I. reply, | He had the promise, if he remained faitli- E | hil, lie should translate the Other plates of the Rook of Mormon, which are now scaled; also that he said and did many dungs in direct. opposition to the word of •God , as given through himself; but we do hot judge him, we leave h‘m in the hands of a just and merciful Gt d. And •tow one word with respect to the plural- ty wife doctrine. It is contrary to the aws of the land, and is therefore wrong; or v/e are told in the Book of Covenants, lli at if we keep the commandments of the f^ord we need nof transgress the laws of |o (? lapel. Agai n , it is posi tiv cl y fo r b id- ||cn in the 7th section of the above book, j i|n reference, to this matttcr, we shall in] Ihe fu lure, answer ; in great plainness and j %ith decision'. 1 * . f : G \\ ' - ' ■■ - 1 vi i Wc p ro fc s s to I > cl i e ve t h at th e Lord' has again the second time (which makes the third time,) ’set his hand to redeem his covenant people, which are left, «$‘C.* according to Isaiah 1 1 th chap., and 11th verse. Mark the Words “again the se* cond lime” first by Moson; secondly by Joseph Smith, and again the 2d time by Elder Rigdon, and others who no\\v stand up for the truth; and tlic principles of virtue. You will doubtless remember that Isa- iah says that the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner; We know that this passage is generally Tiiado to apply to the Jews, rejecting Christ; but look at it for one moment, and see for yurself: that the Jews rejected Christ, is true; but you know they Were not the builders of his kingdom or church, but the apostles were the builders, and they did not reject him 1800 years ago, but the builders in this church, the Twelve, and other big men and builders have rejected Sidney Rig- don, and used# and continue to use their influence with the people against him; and wo be to them for it. The people may reject and for.sake'thcir leader, for they were influenced by euch arguments as were calculated to deceive, if possible, the very elect; but, thank God, the eyes of the people are opening daily to see the truth, and will continue so to do; The Twelve told the people that Joseph had given them their authority in the se- cret chambers, but Christ says go not after them into the secret chambers, nor into the desert;”, or wilderness,, like i Lyman Wyght, who has gone with [ about 300 souls from Nauvoo; and com- I panics arc daily leaving; Wc know these are all delusions, and from the devil; and had not the Lord called a, few to begin with, and re-organized the church j the priesthood would have been taken, and we would have had nothing left but an apostate church, as described by Paul in 1st Tim., 4th chap., 1st and 2d verses, where you find these remark- able words: “Now the spirit speakpth expecssly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith-— giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, 8 peaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience scared with a hot iron.” Ail ' awful state of wickedness indeed: a don-, : ! science so void of truth as to lie in th# 6 THE LATTER DAY SAINTS name of the Lord; even perverting the if eyes, end let the scales dropoff, that they plain word of the Lord, such as “thou shall not commit adultery—* thou , ?h«k liavc* one wife only— thou 8hii.lt be obedi- ent to the law of the land, even unto death /or my name’s sake — thou shalt not kill, nor steal, nor do any manner of! wickedness, but shall observe to keep all the .church covenants, tyc. Now, how does this agree with that odious doctrine as taught in Nauvoo and other places, that a man can have more wives than one. 0 black hearted wick- edness and blasphemy ! as described in the middle of the 10th paragraph of the 104 th Kev elation, addressed to the Twelve, 10 years ago, Where the Lord foresaw and predicated that such an aw- ful shite of things would really exist, even blaspheming his name in the niidst of his House, (People?,) by the very men who professed to know his name; but ac- cording to the 14th Chap, of Ezekiel, may see for themselves, and, believing, come before thee in the depths of humilit atioii, with fasting, and prayer, that if, paradventuxe, they have not sinned unto death, thy judgments may be turned away from them, by observing to do thy will, and keep all thy commandments in the future, and thus become Saviors unto j men, that they may not be cast out, and trodden under feet of men. And again, X ask thee to turn the minds of the work- ers of iniquity unto thee, that they may. even be brought to see their wickedness, and repent, and turn away thy wrath from them in part, like David of old, by doing works of righteousness, if it can be consis- tent with thy will and purposes, and in an especial manner I ask thee, believing that thou wilt grant this one request, that is, make thy servants who have believed thy testimony concerning tins awiul state of wickedness and corruption. to be men may choose their delusions. If they I mighty in their testimony, against these come to the Prophet with an idol in their |j wicked practices and abominations, that hearts, they shall have their heart’s desire | those who are not yet ensnared may not that the Lord may take them in their own | be taken in their snare, by their flatteries snare; because of the plainness of his j| and perversions of thy word; and by ly- word, and of their wicked, lustful; and j ingin thy name, nor by any devices or adulterous inclinations and desires. The |j stratagems that their corrupt hearts and Book of Mormon says that men shall ' have, their hearts desires, although it may be to their (lest ruction. And by reading carefully this chapter, you will find that the Prophet and tie man who sceketh i unto him shall beoome a sign, and a pro-! verb, and shall be destroyed; that the House of Israel may go no more astray. And you will also discover that if a man or woman is clear of these crimes, that he can save neither his sons nor daugh- ters in iniquity, but shall save liis own soul only: and by and by we shall know the cause of all this evil and destruction among the House of Israel, an d this too, has been plainly foretold, that alt Jlmh had became corrupt before the face of the Lord. Again, read in 101st seg. of Book j| of Cov.; read, reflect, and ask yourself, if all flesh has become corrupt? Does item- brace the saints ? I answer, yes, for Isaiah has said in the 3d Chap, that these leaders^ would corrupt the people, and pervert ihe ways of their path, and in his 9th chapter he saysthat the people who are imaginations may invent; but foil them in all their attempts, and let them be confounded and exposed, and brought to shame and disgrace before the face of | thy people, and all the world; and des- troy their influence among men, and pre- vent them from doing violence to thy peo- ple who arc among them, and must contin- ue among them till thou dost open a way for their escape, and dispose the hearts of those who wish to remain, that they may purchase the property of thy people; and grant wisdom unto thy people, that they may know how to conduct them- selves to the best possible advantage for ! themselves, and for the enlightening of j i the minds of those wlio are in darkness; and also that they may confound the| workers and supporters of iniquity, how- ever crafty they may be; yea, let thyj saints, by the assistance of thy spirit, (notwithstanding the exertion the work- ers of iniquity may make against them by inventing and circulating falsehoods, redeem themselves, detect and expost their enemies to the multitude, and .gM led by them will be destroyed:— .

Arid now my dear brother, I will refer you to another chapter, viz: the Hrd of Paul’s epistle to Timothy,, and I will here preface niy remarks upon this chap- ter, by saying, that I have riot applied 11 single v-erse which is not applicable, al- though it may be said that the Mormons have 3 used this very passage against the Catholic church and her offspring. 1 answer yes, and truly too; but remem- ber, there arc very many scriptures which have been fulfilled in | part, in former arid present times, arid in part will be fulfilled in future. I will give you one instance as evidence of this fact. Peter quoted the 2d chapter of Joel as being applicable, and part fulfilled on the •t r r» ...rtf.™ npnrdh snake Now ! shall proceed to call your at- tention to flic inhabitants ol Mauvoo general! vv; and askyott to point the ■” crime named iri the 3d oi 2d Tiro, which has not been committed, but mark especially the 5th, and then more particularly the\" 6th verse, and the 7th; ■ and in the Sth, and in the 9 t b arid 10th. you wjll fied die final result, of this sum of all villante, namely, lhai they shall proceed no farther, butshall be exposed to all men.

I have realized what Paul said about the love of God shed abroad in the heart, and also, that principalities, nor powers, in earth or hell, cannot move me from those things* which ! have written, and God, who tries the reins, and searches the heart of man, as with a lighted candle, knows that I would raiherlay down my life, than deny Eider Rigdon’s mission; or assent to being governed or led by the spirit, It- self, that President Young (who is pre- sumed to speak the mind of the twel ve,} is governed by. Thank God I know the spirit, and want none of it; no, not to s?we my seif from the jaws of death. And now, a lew ideas oh the subject of spirits, ami a liability of bring deceived. The four- teenth Chap, of Ezekiel tells the story ho w men may be decei ved. If a man goes to God and asks him to grant any thing that ho has expressly forbidden. ' The Covenants have given us a key to try spir its, which wiil continue to be on u herring one, for the present and future; if you see o spirit, ask God to give it to you, and if you cannot get it, know assuredly that it is not of God, and again, if ilio spirit con- tradicts the plain and precious things that arc written in the book of Covenants, and book of Mormon ; again, whatsoever spirit admonisheth tb do good, and keep tlie written word apd commandments of God, U of God, for light cleaveth unto light; Ah; but says one, that is no criterion to judge by, well, 1 answer, God says it; and man says no. Who shall I believe T I answer, God; though it makes a liar of every man in the world, even Prophets, Priests, a id Kings, and also apns.les; Well, says the objector, why cannot I get it ? because you are unwilling to have it. Now mark, if a man asks for : a spirit, and and cahimt get it, but gets a spirit. of anger and full of fight, and it arouses all the evil passions and propensities in man, you may know that lie has got an evil spirit ; for instance, I hear Bigin m Yon ng, and am in doubt about the spirit, and I , ask God to give me liie spirit, but I don’t get it, well I know then ft is pot df . God^ or devil, and that is very likely to be correct ; for the devil hates principlfes of truth. (/ Now, no man need tell me that Ke has. ^ got the spirit of Christ, provided he ennnot reason upon the word of Qod Without get* 1 ting mnd; for the Lord has eorrirtianded ti» to pray fur’ them that use 'us dcspil^fullyl atid blrs9 them that cuSb u^i. return good 1 for evil, and in this way gain our enemy. Well, say 8 one; the' covenants teafch, that if our enemies smite tis the third or foiirth time wo may fight them; yes, it does, hut it is speaking of the church collectively, and not individually, and even then, it is said if we continue to suffer wrong, we’ shall be blest; but when a man begins td mock, scoff, and deride, you rAnnot sny ; it is of God; for the angel of God dare hot bring a railing, accusation against Satan* but said, the Lord rebuke thee. Here I have;’ given some fetf testing pointv but read the^Hook, and pray that you niay havh 1 the same spirit tlini indicted it, and nil will be peace and joy in the Holy Ghdsf; and th^n there will lie neither doubt MoV fenr. As for their keys they talk about, X know they don't tell the truth, they’ want to bA wise above the plain simple word of thtf Lord, and therefore become fools. / 1 Now. touching the definition of the W‘6rd kevs, what is it; power 16 mdook, to un- tlerstanrljand for the enduement they (the twelve, V talk about, it is kni^vledge,’ and : thank God„T am not indebted to them for it, for they have not got it to give; I will not say. that X have it, or that j have pot*; but I sav that they have not got it, fop God has rejected them and their ivorks; and I know it. Tho day they rejected Elder Higdon, thev sealed their fate; but they Hve the Lord's anointed, nr, I God reserves the rierht to judge and punish them, and ho will not use any of his saints for that pur* none, hut th^e that are his enemies who are ripening for destruction,; ’ the mail who lays fils hand upon them, ior vioiertfei * will he damned, he he bnhit ior sinmer. or tba* moves with maliep. in his h^artaga*nst them, and bnng« evil upon them; Why then, says one,\" do you/ say anythingytfiat will exapparate the mob f ' * 4 .

It is ray right, it is theirs, and every one elee’s right to believe what they please, and if they are satisfied with their system, and get people to believe it, they may do so, and I will not mock or deride them, \"hut pity and pray for them and the people; and I ih&ll on future occasions, as on the past, takfe the opportunity of warning all men to beware of harming them, or their adherents, and if they should be assailed from any source on account of crimes, or Ipansgreajsiond of the laws of the land, I san only say, that I shall convict none of them, by swearing them guilty; 1 wish, however, not to be understood that I know nothing at all; but matters that were en- trusted to me confidentially, there are not men, nor courts, nor lawyers enough to bring them out of me. It is tru'e, that men have voluntarily entrusted me with their business and secrets; yet they were neces- j eitatsd so to do, and 1 should count myself! the most abandoned wretch to take any ad- 1 vantage of them because of such knowl edge, and should they take the liberty of slandering me, my course will be to tell what I believe, on other people’s testimony and not what I know confidentially, this would not cqnyict any one in courts, of jus- tice, as hearsay is no evidence against any person. .Anil notwithstanding men may be guilty of crime committed against me, for which I might deem it my piiviloge to prosecute at the law, according to the book of Covenants; but here allow me to say, that if any. man has been gnilty of crime, let him be careful for the future, and keep his abominations from my view -or knowl- edge, as my feelings ’for the cause of vir- tue and decency, law and order, will com- pell mo to defend the innocent, and pro- tect those who may not Have sufficient courage to do so for themselves; but I will i •ay that without the interposition of any of those who receive S. Higdon as their lead* er, suits will be instituted and fearful con- sequences may result from such prosecu- tions, the hand of God is upon them, to ar- rest them in their wild career, and this you may mirk, and upon the people ol the city of Nauvoo and county of Hancock. This I believe from the fact that God has said it Now if you inquire, when will these thing’, i come to pass ? I answer, they are now taking piviee in some measure ; and if I shall beam fortunate as to see you, I will tell you things that I would not write, as they f night, come into their enemies month* and do therm much injury; and perhaps lead to serious consequences, and I have said that I do not intend to do or bring evil upon them. Nevertheless, it will come, but by the enemies of God and man, and not by the instrumentality of those who are saints and keep the commandments of God. Now, with reference to the church, gen- erally, l believe them to be honest, indus- trious end good citizens, but nevertheless, I know they have been duped in regardjt » following the counsel of men, instead of following the commandments of God, as given through Joseph Smith— —I have been among the number of those who felt wiU ling to follow counsel to almost any extent, this is wrong, and the people are now told they must follow the counsel of the Twelvef and if they do, I tell you there is no>i virtue enough left in Nauvoo to save them from destruction, temporally and spiritually; temporal, because the excited multitude will not stand it. I ha»c seen the consequences that will result from this course of things, and therefore take the | liberty of 1 telling them in private. I have spoken on the stand once, about three quarters of an hour, and next Sunday X have an appointment on Main street in front of my house. I expect to do and say nothing about men, hut measures I in- tend, to criticise upon. I shall make use of he Bib'e, Botfk of Mormon, and Cov- tenants; and from them I expect to prove to the people, that. serious trouble is at the door. I am compelled to take this course and thus set the minds of the people at Work, and worn them them to repent and forsake their evil ways and doings, and humble themselves before God, and learn his will and then do it, and thus save them- selves and others. * * ,* * * '* I thank God l have . never committed 'any) transgressios against the laws of the ; hn, ba v \\v;l ■■ act- Wii ■car dep ;wir low • ll } u •risk bat . to-i by . wi- ' »iy>. ■ attv ' px , Ik, %■ CO,’- Ja, co : beV ,-tiK ,\\ht of ihl ' \\m,. -W ' ' V/ ' fr..r i ■visa* , ■ '• tv ■ ik V '<Bii ]b - . m • v v>- ■■ • ■ , , , J *LslW s&ibi* *ki niiU . ‘ . t . ^ . . i ' jM£££ii3^ (Mk messenger and ADV OCATE. 11 if . : ; M \"• •I 1 ?-. ,1 • -V» ■yi.

And in the 3d par. it is said, ir they pollute their inheritances, they shall be thrown down. Query, have they. not been driven several times since at which time the persecu lion commenced in the Slate of Missouri and finally expelled from the Stae, and have they not been every ye r since severely scourged in this State? Yes verilv. Do they keep the commandments ? No, or else they would have prevailed against their enemies ; think well on this revelation. In tbs 68th 'oee. 1st paragraph we are expressly told they were driven for transgression; and now l;' look well to the parable in the 6, 7, and 8th paragraphs, and see the 12 onye trees, (apostles,) nobleman, (Lord,) choice Ian , Nauvoo,) tower, (Temple,) the servants began to build, but did not finish;. the olive trees destroyed; the servanta fled and ‘heir works broken down; then the Lord said to one of his servants, (not twelve,) go and i gather together. &c;&c.; and the eervant wentand doneas he was commanded. »id after many days all things .were fulfilled.

The intelligence was cheer- ing) these early evidences of the virtue and firm integrity of the saints speaks volumns in favor of their future pros- pects. What, dear brother, can with- stand the truth when its advocates are uncompromising in their attachment to virtue and holy principles. Since the worid began, all the dispensations deliv- ered to men of the living God, have been thrown into confusion by the introduction ol doctrines and practices which were at war with Godliness, and subversive of all that was good and noble. Hence the distraction of the religious world. At aomd times past so great were tho de- partures from truth, by those who pro- tossed to be the people of God, that if a i\\oah, a Daniel, and a Job.had been amonv them, they could save their own souls 1 * fcrr ; > >■ f MESSENGER AND ADVOCATE. 13 only, and not be able even to save a roi)!| or daughter. Such an attempt has Satan made on us, and was maturing his plan, f o completely to effect our overthrow, that . the lew left who could not be corrupted could do nothing more than save their own souls; but the iniquity was discov- ered before the adversary had gotten the fang3 of his corruption so listened on us that we could not unfasten them. I have been informed, since Mr, Page published his Bull, and subsequent de- parture from this place, that lie had at- ! tempted to teach the doctrine of spiritu- al wives in tins city some time since* j This will account for his sudden depar- •. ture from both this place and yours. j It would seem almost impossible that j there could be found a set of men and j women, in this age of the world, witir the revelations of God in tneir hands, I who could invent and propogatc doctrines so ruinous to society, so debasing and demoralising as the doctrine of a man having a plurality of wives; for it is the existence of this strange doctrine — worse than the strange fire offered on the altar, by corrupted Israel— that was at the root of all the evils which have followed, and are following in the church, the very mention, of which could not fail to redden the cheek of decency with a blush. The whole of the revelations of God in all ages, charge the prophets and lead- ers of the people, with being the authors of the corruptions, which from time to time overrun the people of God. We need not marvel then that like evils have befallen us. The crime of the people was that they loved to have it so, they were not charged with introducing the corruptions, but having pleasure in them after the prophets, and leaders, had intro- aplied to the professing world, are as ap- plicable to th sms elves as to any others how living, or any others who have lived since the days cf Paul. In the 6th verse wc arc told that “For of this sort.are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led a way with divers lusts.!’ Now of what sort are those who creep into houses and lead astray silly women ? The answer is giv- en in the proceeding verse. Persons that can do that arc such is. arc without na- tural affection, boas to vs, proud inventors o f evil tli i ngs, heady, h. gh-rni ruled , lovers of pleasure rather tha t lovers of God. Whcii we see such men as above descri- bed, they, according to Paul, would do other things, that is, en er into houses and lead astray silly women. . That the Twelve and their adherents huve entered into houses and led silly women astray, is a fact susceptible of the highest proof; and we ,j rc authorized by Paul to apply all the rest he has said to town. “For if this sort enter into houses and lead astray silly women,'’ what sort? we ask; the before described .religionists, for says Paul, “they have a form of god- lidcss.” The conclusion then is* that they effected the ruin of silly females, by, or through a form of godliness, Paul says, the corruption he has des- cribed was to take plarce in the last days. Now, from this,, the people of the last lays arc authorized) to call any thing of (hired them. It is no small degree of satisfaction to me, to find the people ri- !; sing in the exercise of their just, rights, | and casting off, not only the leaders, but \\ those who arc. led by those .corrupters ! seducing spirits which introduce doc- trines of demons. the kind wiich may ake its appearance it matters not by whom these corruptions were introduced, Prophet, Apostle, Evan- gelist, (for Pastor, whosoever introduces them, has an account to settle with Paul in the great day when the affaias of the universe shall be adjusted before an um- pire wlvo cannot err, for cither these doc- trines* and practices arc corruptions, or else Paul stands charged with a depar- ture from truth. Those who read the New Testament with care, cannot avoid seeing that the apostles have declared that a corrupting like that we complain of, was to make its appearance in the last days. See Second : Timothy, 3d chapter, from the 1st to the j 9th . verse inclusive. These sayings which the apostles, at Nauvoo* havo ap- From what is said in the 9th verse, the iniquity complained of, was to i)c a thing conducted in secret. “But they shall pro- ceed no further, for their folly shall be manifest unto all men;” Nothing can he plainer than that this abomiurtion of leading silly women astray, was to be a secret thing— carried on privately, and the exposure of it was to put a final stop to their wjckedness. \"Bui they shall proceed no further \\ for their folly shell be made manifest.” 14 THE LATTER DAY SAINTS This secret working in matters of re- ligion is, and always has been evidence of corruption. The saints always have been warned against the secret works of darkness; light and truth not only mani- fest themselves, but also make manifest the secret works of darkness, It is equal- ity plain according to Paul, that no such thing could be carried on, however secret- ly it might be done, without detection, ••/or their folly shall be made manifest. Those leaders of silly women, if they had regarded the scriptures, might have known that their race was a short one, and that their wickedness would be made manifest; for thus had Paul written moro than 1700 years ago, and a3 proof that Paul was inspired behold it has come to pass in our day aud before our eyes. It is a fact, so well known, that the Twelve and their adherents have endeav- ored to carry on this spiritual wife bus- iness in secret, that I hardly need men- tion it here, and have gone to the most seameful and desperate lengths, to keep it from the public. First, insulting inno- cent females, and when they resented the insult, these monsters in human shape would assail their characters by lying, and perjuries, with a multitude of despe- rate men to help tnem to effect the ruin of ( those whom they had insulted, and all • this to enable them to keep these coorrupt practices from the view of the world. I could bring facts which can be estab* lished in any court of justice, in relation to these vile abominations practised un- der the garb of religion that would make •humanity blush. No falsehood too great, and no perjury too daring, in order to conceal these heaven-daring abuses of mankind; but I say in the language of Paul, they shall go no further, for their folly is now being made manifest, and will not cease nntil it is manifest unto all. How often have these men and their accomplices stood up before the congrega- tion, and called God and all the holy An- gels to witness, that there was no such doctrine taught in the church; and it has now come to light, by testimony which ij cannot be gainsaid, that at the time they thus dared heaven and insulted the world, they were living in the practice of these j enormities; and there were multitudes of their followers in the congregation at the time who knew it. These things only tend to confirm the fact that the church of |Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is the true church of God, for we now see in that body fulfilling, what the A postles and Prophets said should take place in that order of things whtch God acknowledged. According to both prophets and apostles, the true church in the last days would be tried, with all the corruptions which had oberthrown all the previous orders, king- doms, or churches which God had set up; and before she could be exalted to her true glory, to overcome all the inventions of Satan or of man: but more of this in our next. Dear Brother, through this letter to you, I would call on all the saints into whose hands this may come, to arise and deliver themselves from the corruption, disorder and ruin, that satan through the twelve as instruments, designs to bring upon the them, know ye that no strange thing has befallen you, that an attempt is being made upon you by those in hiHh authority, and those who are arrogating to themselves authority in violation of the order of heaven. SIDNEY HIGDON. [To be Continued] To all the Members of the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints . Pittsburgh, Oct. 15; 1844. I embrace the present opportunity of say- ing to you all, that after a very careful in- vestigation of the claims of Elder S. Hig- don to the office of the Fust Presidency of the Church, I am satisfied they are not only just but lawful, and as far as this mat- ter is concerned I have made up my mind, not from either any persona! preference or animosity, but from the law or rules of the C. lurch, as found in the book of Doctrine and Covenants and Book of Mormon. It is abundantly evident to my mind that tine quorum of the Twelve and others have excited a certain portion of the Church to reject Elder Higdon, (which is a most hor- rid ou trage upon the laws of the same,) from a fear he would bring them to an account, or in other words, to justice for teaching and practising the doctrine of polygamy. They of ourse reasoned from the well known fact, that h - * has always been a determened op- ponent ?»:.y thing of the kind.

W. PITTSBURGH; OCT. 15, 1844. The ‘-Times and Seasons,” and the “Nuuvoo Neighbour,” published fit Nhiivoo, Illinois, are busying themselves about us exceedingly, though the ediUvr says iie reluctant jy oblridt j 5 our name before tine public. Now if he would be. as re. bictant. to publish falsehoods about us when lie does, obtrude- d.u'r name upo r - die public, it would be as .creditable to him. The old saying that “drowning men catch at ?traws” is fulfilled to the letter in the editor’s weak attempt to injure us. He has strained hard to squeese out something by which he could make n n unfavorable impres* siou on (the public mind. We wrote a letter which wos puhlbhed in the People’s Organ, at St. Louis, Mi*., stHting facts and nothing else but facts, in relation to What took place on onr visit at Nauvoo a few weeks since; and the editor and Mr. Hyde, Who have both written on the subject, knew this as well as we, and they know it now; but by giving puldicity loan Ignorant farce which came off in Nnuvoo, they thought to Impeach our character, but iri this weak and ignorant attempt tliey will fail. What is the matter of compla’nt? It i« this: We said that the only crime we t ommitted was, that there were a number of gentlemen « ho wish- ed to return with us to PiWlHirgli. Tnisibey say w as false, and to prove It, publish art investigation, said to have been bad in Nauvoo, when we were charged with trying to divide the church. Now, > bow we/e wo dividing the church? The only ground of this charge was that aiiumher of per- sons We redesi rd u s of t* t u rn i n g w itli ui <o iHus- burgh, and these defatners knew it. It Ii4h?« they call dividing the church, atid then say they opposed ns. for -dividing the church, and not because that there were those who desired to go with us to Pitt«b«rgh. Now, reader, judge of the character of this attempt, and of the char* aufer Of those who could condescend 1 to it. I here leave them to enjoy all the pleasure their situation can give— they are welcome to it. But there Wj»s another and greater cause for their- opposition to us than the crime of having those at Nauvoo Whose personal friendship made them desire to be where they could enjoy our society. . Gentle render, do you d» sire to know what it was? Well, it is your light, as well as the right of saint and sinner to know it. Know then , that the so called Twelve apostles at Nau- voo, are now teaching the doctrine of, w hat is called Spiritual Wives: that a man may have more ivivWthan one. and t)*y are not only trail- ing it but practising it, and this doctrine is spread, ing alarmingly through that apostate brunch of the church • f Latter Day 3»ints. Their greatest “ objection to us was our opposition to this doc- trine, knowing, as they did, that we had got the fact In possession, it cieated ahum f great alarm, every effort was Used B w bile we were there to ef- fect something that might screen them (rum the consequences of exposure. This is what Mr. Hyde had^nn ullusion to bn the steam boat at St. Louis, when ho felt such an interest in onr welfare, as he said, as to request ui. not for his sake or his fellow apostles s-ke, but for our own sake and salvation, to make any disclosures, fast wi should have to retract and thereby he injured. Kind man! how fatherly and apostolical this! I now call upon the twelve, including Mr. J. E. Page, to deny the existence of such a doctrine among diem, believed taught and practised by Item. This is the doctrine which has made W hat these men call the divisit n in the church. We deny it has made any division in. the Church. The Church |s taking Paul’s advice, •‘From such turn away;” the Church is doing so. B«e the third chapter of Second Timothy, where this a* well as other crimes are declared an apostacy, and (lie saints admonished to turn away from them. Thir the saints are doing, nnd that in great numbers too, and the separation Will continue until all the snoms are ngain foinid united in strict obedience to the Doctrines and Covenants of the Church. This doctrine of a man having more wives than ongi is. the cause which has induced the, twelve to put at defiance the ecclesiastical or- rangeroenls of the Church, snd what is equally criminal, to do di#pUe unto the moral excellence of the Ooctrines and Covenants of the Church, setting up an order of things of their own in vio- lation o all the rules and regulations known to | the saints, and nowhere found in the Doctrine* land Covenants of the Church, but by the author. 16 THE LATTER DAY S A ENTS ity of protended secret communications mfide to bemselves in the Secret Chambers, unknown to the Church only as they and a mi* of their fol- lower* declare them, and these pretended secret communications, in direct contradiction to the written word contained in tue Doctrine and Covenant; of the Church, These matters the saints are now investigating, and riot only in Nauvoo but in other places to avoid these investigations, the twelve are getting up sham trials to step the mouths of those Who are determined to expose the corruptions of these transgressors. Let the saints look well to it. The lime has come when the saints will have to come out and show themselves: the ullerna live with the saints is that they must either deny their faith or espouse the Spiritual Wife system and he taught by tho?e who practise it, or else luridly and manfully join with those who have , and nr** raising their voices against this most ex- traordinary of all doctrine*’, which is destroying fha pence and tapping the foundation of the Church, To satisfy the public that it was the Spiritual Wife system that caused our opponents at Nan voo to oppose ns, we give the fullmving certiri cate, from a gentleman whose character stands too high for truth and veracity to he impeached by any mnn: *•1 whs at Nauvoo during all the time that El- <W -Sidney Higdon was there on lii<; fast visit to that plate, and am well acquainted with the cause of all the difficulties that existed, and now exi-t between him and the twelve and their adherent 4 . It was a dd to me bv many that they had no ol>. jectioH to F.ld^r Rigdon but his opposition to the Spiritual Wife system. •'JOSEPH H. NEWTON.” We inl*«doee this testimony to show that the twelve and their adherents, though they availed themselves of the circumstance of a number of the citizens of that place coming with us to Pittsburgh, to create an excitement against ii.«, yet the whole was designed to guard against the disclosures which they had rea«on to fear would be made of the secret doctrines they were teach- ing at Nauvoo. and which they had openly de- nied in the world. They knew that if the true facts of the case were made known, that they must appear in rdlier an unfavorable point of light before the public, having at various times and on various occasions denied tho existence of such doctrine with all the solemnities wPan oatb. The falsehoods of such assertion are staring them In face. We felt It a duty we owed the public to say so much on this subject, In this number of our pa- per, with the intention to give the doctrine and predict under it an examination hereafter. '/ •' EOR The TLatter Pay Saints’ MESSSENGER AND ADVOCATE. As much doubt still remains on the public mind, as to the true doctrine of the ••church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saiiits; the subscriber proposes to pub- lish a paper in the city of Pittsburgh, for the purpose of relieving the public mind- from all dubiety in relation to the ©re- ceived and acknowledged dccrines of said church. The paper is to be entitled as above. It will be the primary object of the editor to give a full and clear dcvel- velopement of all the doctrines of said church, carefully distinguishing between the true religious bcelief of said church and the strange doctrines which have crept in unawares, and are maintained by some who would fain make toe public believe that they are the only legitimate author- ities of the church whose claims shall be examined and exposed to the condemna- tion to which they are devoted by the doctrines and covenants which have been received, and on which the church was formed and organized. In resuscitating the Latter Day Saints* Messenger and Advocate; it is the inten- tion of the subscriber to contend for the same doctrines,, order of church govern- ment and discipline, maintained by that paper when first published in Kirtland, Ohio. It is to the public the subscriber must look B or patronage to carry out his designs believing as he does, that the paper con- ducted, an he intends it shall be, on the broad principles of Christian charity, will he sufficiently interesting to the read- ing public, whether they do or do not be- long to said church, to secure the neces- sary patronage; and in this belief, eub- roits his proposals to the public, SIDNEY RIGDON.

It does not follow, as a consequence, tlull the religion thus corrupted is false and tiot the (ruth of heaven; hut the very reverse. What system was it that the apostle guarded the saints of his arid all succeeding days against corrupting, as- suring them that in the last days a. cor- ruption would take place, Was it not the true system of heaven? Surely .it was. Was it not the system of heaVcri, where men [monsters] were to avail themselves ol their apostolic and prophetic iuflucnce- and be lifted up in the pride of their hearts become proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, truce breakers, incontinent, and abusers of themselves with mankind ? It was. Was it not those who had a ; place among the wintn, who were so far to depart from the fear of God, and the principles of decency, as to be sufficient- ly daring to put at defiance the laws oi man and the holy priricipics of the insti- tutions of heaven, as to enter into houses and lead astray silly women, laden with sins? Need I answer it was. Was it not the true religion of heaven, which all , sacred writers both of the Old and New Testament; cautioned the world and all ‘ the saints against corrupting, and corrupt- ing by certain defined abominations mi- nutely detailed? All will answer it was. The conclusion then is, that the true or- der of God, in the lasf days, was in dan- ger, imminent danger of being brought in- to reproach and shame, by those who seek to gratify their carnal desires, in de- fiance of all righteousness, aud, with a bold effrontery, claiming the authority of the priesthood, that they might more ef- fectually accomplish their corrupt design, arid thereby bring fhe whole church of God under condemnation before God; and «o far sink it in the estimation of all, as to render it qdious in the eyos of the world. The true church of Christ, ac- cording to the testimony of both prophets i and apostles; of olden time, waa in this I! danger in the last days. As to societies which the sacred writers nc„ v er ponsider- ed as of divine origin, the'y never thought of guarding the world against corrupting. ; Their object, and tfrei / only object was to p.rescry.eThe institutions arid ordinances of of hCavcn from abuse: knowing, as they did, that an abuse there would sooner or Inter prove fatal to the world. What then, Dear Brother, shall we say ? What can any man shy ? Why, the society where those abuses* as defined by the sacred writers, made their appearance, has sure* ly a high degree of testimony that it is the true church of Christ in* the last days. The corruptions which the sacred writers, of former days, said would make their ap- pearance in the church of ; Christ in the last daya, have made their appearance among us. , . , , a Had Paul lived in our days, and looked ; at the church of Jesus Christ oi Matter Day Slain ts, lie could not have described * it more minutely: the very corruptions have made their appearance, that ho said would tak -j place in the Church of Christ in the last days. Had not these corruptions Appeared among us, we should have lacked one im- portant testimony that we were the true church of Christ; but the appearance of these corruptions, has added a testimony to those who desire to know’ the truth, * that the kingdom of heaven is wifh us in •* distinction to all others.. • u It may well give us boldness m the faith, and great confidence before God, Wc may arise in the strength of truth, and purge these things out of our midst; knowing that the Lord will aid us; seeing we are doing as commanded, to “sepa- rate ourselves from all such*’ workers of iniquity. . , - By this you arid the branch of the church under your charge, will see that they have done well, and may , take cour- age, nothing fearing, for the Lord will be with such to bless them. . It may be, that the saints may not be rpprised of the fact, that the scriptures have pointed out the very things which should take place in the last day 8 . . true church of Christ; and ^’.L hear I time before Christ’s coming.
