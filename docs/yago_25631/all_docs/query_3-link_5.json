        "text": "Judith Godrèche, the French actor-turned-filmmaker who recently delivered the semi-autobiographical series “Icon of French Cinema,” has filed a complaint against director Jacques Doillon alleging rape, Variety has confirmed.\n\nGodrèche filed the complaint on Feb. 6, the same day that she filed one against director Benoit Jacquot.\n\nInterviewed by the local radio station France Inter, Godrèche alleged that she was raped twice by Doillon when she was 15 in the late 1980s. She claimed the sexual assault happened at the home that Doillon shared with his then partner Jane Birkin, during the shoot of “La fille de 15 ans.” Godrèche, who was at the time in a relationship with Jacquot, had the lead role in Doillon’s film and starred alongside Melvil Poupaud and Doillon himself. The movie came out in 1989.\n\n“It was hallucinating. He got rid of the actor and took his place and all of the sudden he decided that there was going to be a sex scene between he and I,” Godrèche said on the radio Thursday.\n\nRepresentatives for Doillon did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\nIn her complaint against Jacquot, Godrèche — who met the filmmaker when she was 14 years old and he was 39 — accused him of “predation” and “violent rape of a minor under 15 years old committed by a person in authority.” She has filed her complaint with France’s Juvenile Protection Brigade. According to Le Monde, Jacquot denied the claims, telling the outlet they had a “loving” relationship.\n\nNaman Ramachandran contributed to this report."
