        "text": "Cannes award winner Vincent Lindon (The Measure of a Man) stars as the eponymous bushy-bearded sculptor in this sensuous biopic from veteran filmmaker Jacques Doillon. Unfolding primarily within his cavernous studio, littered with clay limbs and torsos, the film traces 30-odd years of Rodin’s career — beginning in 1880 with the commissioning of “The Gates of Hell” — and his amorous affairs, notably with his talented assistant Camille Claudel (Izïa Higelin). Like the sculptures themselves, there’s plenty of desire, torment, and flesh to go around.\n\nIn French with English subtitles.\n\nOfficial Selection: Cannes Film Festival\n\nA Cohen Media Group release."
