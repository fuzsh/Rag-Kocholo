        "text": "British and French actress and singer (1946–2023)\n\nJane Mallory Birkin ( ; 14 December 1946 – 16 July 2023) was a British and French actress and singer. She had a prolific career as an actress, mostly in French cinema.\n\nA native of London, Birkin began her career as an actress, appearing in minor roles in Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup (1966), and Kaleidoscope (1966). In 1968, she met Serge Gainsbourg while co-starring with him in Slogan, which marked the beginning of a years-long working and personal relationship.[1] The duo released their debut album Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg (1969), and Birkin also appeared in the Je t'aime moi non plus (1976) under Gainsbourg's direction. Though she mostly worked in France where she had become a major star, Birkin occasionally appeared in English-language films such as the Agatha Christie adaptations Death on the Nile (1978) and Evil Under the Sun (1982), as well as James Ivory's A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries (1998).\n\nAfter separating from Gainsbourg in 1980, Birkin continued to work as both an actress and a singer, appearing in various independent films and recording numerous solo albums. In 2016, she starred in the Academy Award-nominated short film La femme et le TGV, which she said would be her final film role.\n\nBirkin lived mainly in France from the late 1960s onwards, and would acquire French citizenship.[2][3] She was the mother of photographer Kate Barry, with her first husband John Barry; actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, with Serge Gainsbourg; and musician Lou Doillon, with Jacques Doillon. In addition to her acting and musical credits, she lent her name to the Hermès Birkin handbag.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nJane Mallory Birkin was born on 14 December 1946,[4] in Marylebone, London.[5] Her father, David Leslie Birkin (1914-1991), grandson of Sir Thomas Birkin, 1st Baronet and a member of the wealthy Birkin family, was a Royal Navy lieutenant commander and World War II spy, whose first cousin was Freda Dudley Ward, a mistress of Edward VIII while he was Prince of Wales.[6][7] Her father was also a cousin of English film director Carol Reed, whom Birkin turned to for advice about becoming an actress when she was a teenager.[8] Reed told her it all depended on if the camera loved her. Her mother, Judy Mary Campbell, was an English actress, best known for her work on stage, whose family was acquainted with the family of Margaret Thatcher, while living in Grantham. Her elder brother is screenwriter and director Andrew Birkin.[9][10] Birkin was raised in Chelsea,[11] and described herself as a \"shy English girl\".[12] She said that she was bullied for her looks; \"I suffered a lot because of my physique, especially at boarding school. The others said I was half boy, half girl. I had no breasts, not even a developing bosom. It was horrible.\"[13][14] She said she wanted to be as pretty as Jean Shrimpton, calling herself a \"bad version\" of her.[15]\n\nHer middle name \"Mallory\" was invented by her mother, partly inspired by the name of Arthurian author Sir Thomas Malory.[16]\n\nBirkin attended Miss Ironside's School in Kensington.[17][18] She was also educated at Upper Chine School, Isle of Wight.[14] In 2021, she said she started taking sleeping pills at 16 and never stopped. At the age of 17, she met composer John Barry, whom she married in 1965, and had her first daughter, Kate, in 1967. After Barry left for the United States, the couple divorced in 1968 and Birkin returned to live with her family in London.[13] She began auditioning for film and television roles in England and in Los Angeles.[12]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly acting credits\n\n[edit]\n\nBirkin emerged in the Swinging London scene of the 1960s, appearing in an uncredited part in The Knack ...and How to Get It (1965).[19] She had a small role in Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup (1966) as a brunette model. At the time, the movie gained notoriety because of Birkin's nude scene, which she later said she did because John Barry had told her she would not have the courage to show up naked on set.[20][13] Birkin also said that on the day of her audition, she had no idea who Antonioni was.[13] She had a more substantial role in the counterculture era film Kaleidoscope (1966) and appeared as a fantasy-like model in the psychedelic film Wonderwall (1968).\n\nIn 1968, she auditioned for the lead female role in the French film Slogan (1969).[21] Though she did not speak French[22] she won the role, co-starring alongside Serge Gainsbourg, and she performed with him on the film's theme song, \"La Chanson de Slogan\", the first of many collaborations between the two. After filming Slogan, Birkin relocated to France permanently.[23] She had a role in the French thriller La Piscine (1969) and said that the movie had enabled her to stay in France after finishing Slogan: \"The film saved me and enabled me to stay in France. I just finished Slogan and was due to go back to England.\"[13] Though her heavy accent in French eventually did prevent her from getting some roles, it turned out to be an asset in her career, as French audiences found it charming. She later stated: \"Without my accent, I would have had a different career.\"[13]\n\nCollaborations with Serge Gainsbourg\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1969, Gainsbourg and she released the duet \"Je t'aime... moi non plus\" (\"I love you ... me neither\"). Gainsbourg had originally written the song for Brigitte Bardot. Birkin said it was \"jealousy\" that drove her to sing the song.[13] It caused a scandal for its sexual explicitness, and was banned by radio stations in Italy,[24] Spain, and the United Kingdom.[25]\n\n\"Je t'aime\" made UK chart history in that on 4 October 1969 and the following week on 11 October, the song was at two different chart positions, despite being the same song, the same artists, and the same recorded version, the only difference being that they were on different record labels. It was originally released on the Fontana label, but due to the controversy, Fontana withdrew the record, which was then released on the Major Minor label. Because Fontana singles were still in the shops, along with the Major Minor release, on 4 October 1969, the Major Minor release was at number three and the Fontana single at number 16. Also at that time, it was the biggest-selling single ever for a completely foreign-language record. Birkin appeared on Gainsbourg's 1971 album Histoire de Melody Nelson, portraying the Lolita-like protagonist in song and on the cover.[27] Reflecting on being a muse and collaborator of Gainsbourg's, Birkin commented: \"[It is] very flattering to have the most beautiful songs, probably, in the French language written for one. [But] how much talent did I really have? Perhaps not that much.\"[26]\n\nDuring the 1970s she released three albums, all mainly written by Gainsbourg: Di doo dah (1973), Lolita Go Home (1975) and Ex fan des sixties (1978).\n\nShe took a break from acting in 1971–1972, but returned as Brigitte Bardot's lover in Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman (1973).[28] She called Bardot \"fabulously beautiful\", saying: \"I observed Bardot in the tiniest detail to find a flaw in her. Her mouth, her nose, her skin, her hair... She was fabulously beautiful.\"[13] The same year, she had a supporting role in the horror film Dark Places with Christopher Lee and Joan Collins.[29] In 1975, she appeared in Gainsbourg's first film as a director, Je t'aime moi non plus, which created a stir for its frank examination of sexual ambiguity, and was banned in the United Kingdom by the British Board of Film Classification. For this performance, she was nominated for a Best Actress César Award.[28]\n\nLater performances and recordings\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1978, Birkin modeled in trade advertisements for Lee Cooper jeans.[30]\n\nGainsbourg kept writing her music after their breakup, including Baby Alone in Babylone (1983) and Amours des feintes (1990). The latter was the last album he wrote before his death in 1991, and the former was their first collaboration after their separation in 1980. Birkin has said: \"This was the album of the break-up when everything changed. All of a sudden, Serge got me to sing of his wounds and his feminine side. It was very unsettling to sing about the wounds that you have triggered.\" While recording the album, she sang as high as she could and said she had become \"tired of singing as the little girl who excites gentlemen in trains\". She also chose \"Les Dessous chics\", as \"a portrait of Serge.\" She said: \"It represents the modesty of feelings, made up outrageously in blood red. Les Dessous chics means keeping one's true feelings deep inside, as fragile as a silk stocking.\"[13] Lost Song (1987) was also written by Gainsbourg.\n\nShe starred in two films directed by Jacques Doillon: as Anne in La fille prodigue (The Prodigal Daughter, 1981) and as Alma in La pirate (1984, nominated for a César Award). She said The Prodigal Daughter (1981) was the first time her performance was well received and \"It touched [her] deeply to be taken seriously\". Before working with Doillon she didn't know about his work and said: \"No one had ever offered me a part like that or asked me to have a nervous breakdown\". She cited this film as her favorite, saying: \"Piccoli and I were really good. If I die, I would like the film to be shown on television, even at midnight.\" Upon screening at Cannes, it caused a scandal, which led to an invitation for Birkin from Patrice Chéreau to star on stage in La Fausse suivante by Marivaux at Nanterre. Recalling her experience on the stage, she said: \"That was my first stage experience, which finally gave me the courage to sing at the Bataclan.\"[13]\n\nShe worked with director Herbert Vesely on Egon Schiele Exzess und Bestrafung in 1980, appearing as the mistress of Austrian artist Egon Schiele, played by Mathieu Carrière. She then appeared in the Agatha Christie films Death on the Nile (1978) and Evil Under the Sun (1982). Jacques Rivette collaborated with her in Love on the Ground (1983) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991, Nominated Césars best supporting actress). In 1985, she co-starred with John Gielgud in Leave All Fair (1985). She won Female Artist of the Year in the 1992 Victoires de la Musique.[28]\n\nShe appeared in Merchant Ivory's A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries (1998) (which also used her song \"Di Doo Dah\") and in Merci Docteur Rey (2002). The end title song for Le Divorce (2003) featured her singing \"L'Anamour\", composed by Gainsbourg.[31] In 2006, she played the title role in Elektra, directed by Philippe Calvario in France.[28]\n\nBirkin recorded the song \"Beauty\" on French producer Hector Zazou's album Strong Currents (2003).[28] The album brought together a number of well-known soloists, features her alongside Laurie Anderson, Irene Grandi and Melanie Gabriel, among others. Jane Birkin and Melanie Gabriel covered songs by Nina Hynes on this album.\n\nThe cover art of Have You Fed the Fish? (2002) by singer-songwriter Badly Drawn Boy features her image and backing vocals by her daughter, Charlotte Gainsbourg.[28] In 2006 she recorded and released the album Fictions,[23] and in 2010, recorded a duet, \"Marie,\" with Brazilian singer Sérgio Dias, which appeared on We Are the Lilies, an album by Dias and French band Tahiti Boy and the Palmtree Family [fr]; the album also featured contributions from Iggy Pop and others.[32]\n\nIn 2016 Birkin appeared in an ongoing campaign for Yves Saint Laurent shot by Hedi Slimane, which featured various female musicians, including Marianne Faithfull, Courtney Love, and Joni Mitchell.[30] The same year, she had the lead role in La femme et le TGV, a short film directed by Swiss filmmaker Timo von Gunten.[33] The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.[34] In a 2017 interview, Birkin stated that La femme et le TGV would be her final acting performance, and that she had no plans to return to acting.[33]\n\nOn 24 March 2017, Birkin released Birkin/Gainsbourg: Le Symphonique, a collection of songs Gainsbourg had written for her during and after their relationship, reworked with full orchestral arrangements.[11] In September 2017, she performed live in Brussels to promote the album.[11]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 16 October 1965, Birkin married British composer and conductor John Barry, 13 years her senior, in a private ceremony at Chelsea Register Office, London.[35] They met in 1964 when Barry cast Birkin in his musical Passion Flower Hotel. Their daughter was photographer Kate Barry (1967–2013).[36] Their marriage ended in 1968.[37] She said she was insecure during the relationship and \"couldn't believe that this sophisticated, talented genius chose [her] and not any of the other girls.\" She did not want him to see her with her \"tiny, piggy eyes\" so she would sleep with an eye pencil under her pillow and put it on if he woke up in the night. He eventually went to the United States and left Birkin with their daughter in England.[13]\n\nBirkin had a romantic and creative relationship with French musician Serge Gainsbourg, 18 years her senior, whom she met on the set of Slogan in 1968. They were together for 12 years[38] but never married, despite rumours and misreporting to the contrary.[39][40][41]\n\nShe eventually became a French citizen.[2][3]\n\nIn 1971, Birkin and Gainsbourg had a daughter, actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg. The couple separated in 1980, due to his alcoholism and violence.[42][43][44][45] She described him as \"a very difficult man to live with\",[46] and said during recording sessions he would scream at her and hit her with a ruler if she could not sing a part.[47][48] She took credit for helping him develop his style later in life, saying: \"It's all about me, he listened to me a lot.\"[13]\n\nOn 4 September 1982, she gave birth to her third daughter, Lou Doillon, from her relationship with director Jacques Doillon.[49] She said: \"Meeting Jacques was a real turning point in my career. In my private life, after I left Serge, Jacques and I lived together for thirteen years, and had Lou.\"[13] She said she was surprised and happy to find out that Doillon was not \"an old man\". They separated in 1993. The Observer reported in 2007 that Doillon \"could not compete with her grief for Gainsbourg\" (who died in 1991), and that she had lived alone since their separation.[50] Birkin said that Doillon lost interest in casting her in his movies, and she felt \"pain for Jacques going off with all these young girls making all these films all the time\". Later, Birkin had a relationship with French writer Olivier Rolin.[51]\n\nIn 2002, she was diagnosed with leukaemia and underwent rounds of treatment.[52] Birkin often spent time with her six grandchildren.[53][54] Her daughter, Kate Barry, died in December 2013 after falling from a fourth floor apartment in Paris.[55]\n\nBirkin mainly resided in Paris from the late 1960s onwards.[56][11] She was described as \"a fixture of the Saint-Germain-des-Prés neighbourhood on the Left Bank\".[57] In 2020, recalling 1970s Paris, she said: \"it was a time of great innocence, and I don't think social problems were as they are today.\"[46] On 6 September 2021, it was reported that Birkin was doing well after having a stroke.[58]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 16 July 2023, Birkin was found dead at home in Paris. She was 76.[2] No cause of death was disclosed. The premiere of the documentary Jane by Charlotte, about Birkin's relationship with her daughter Charlotte, on 8 July 2021, was one of her last public appearances. Her funeral took place at the Church of Saint-Roch in the 1st arrondissement of Paris on the morning of July 24. After the funeral, her remains were cremated at the crematorium of Père Lachaise Cemetery and then, her ashes were interred at Montparnasse Cemetery, in the grave of her daughter, Kate Barry, and in the same cemetery where Gainsbourg was buried.[59]\n\nMany fans gathered to watch the ceremony on a large screen outside of the church. France's First Lady Brigitte Macron and Minister of Culture Rima Abdul Malak, Catherine Deneuve and her daughter Chiara Mastroianni; Vanessa Paradis; Maïwenn; Sandrine Kiberlain; Carole Bouquet; Charlotte Rampling and Anthony Vaccarello were among the attendees.[60]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nBirkin's humanitarian interests led her to work with Amnesty International on immigrant welfare and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Countries she visited included Bosnia, Rwanda, Israel, and Palestine.[61]\n\nPolitical views and activism\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a child, Birkin demonstrated in the streets of London against capital punishment. In the 1970s, she campaigned for the right to abortion and appeared at the Bobigny trial [fr], in support of four women accused of having helped the high school student Marie-Claire Chevalier to have an abortion following a rape.[62]\n\nBirkin campaigned against the far-right in France, participating in a protest denouncing the qualification of Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round of the 2002 presidential election. In 2017, she performed at a free concert at the Place de la République organised in opposition to Marine Le Pen in the 2017 presidential election.[62]\n\nBirkin also demonstrated support for immigrants, denouncing the French government's policy towards undocumented migrants in 2010. The same year, she protested outside the residence of the Minister of Immigration, Éric Besson. She also announced that she was sponsoring a young Congolese who had requested political asylum. In 2015, she marched in Paris in support of refugees.[62]\n\nIn September 2018, following the resignation of French environment minister Nicolas Hulot, Birkin was one of the 200 artists and scientists who signed an open letter published on the front page of the daily Le Monde titled \"The Greatest Challenge in the History of Mankind\", which urged politicians to act \"firmly and immediately\" in fighting climate change and the \"collapse of biodiversity\".[63]\n\nIn late 2022, Birkin, among other French women, cut her hair in support of Iranian women and girls who had been killed in protests at the death of Mahsa Amini after her arrest by Iranian morality police.[64][65][66]\n\nAwards and honours\n\n[edit]\n\nBirkin won the \"Best Actress\" award at the 1985 Orleans Film Festival for Leave All Fair. The jury of the 1985 Venice Film Festival recognised Birkin's performance in Dust as amongst the best of the year, but decided not to award a best actress prize because all of the actresses they judged to have made the best performances were in films that won major awards. Dust won the Silver Lion prize.[67]\n\nIn the diplomatic and overseas list of the 2001 Birthday Honours, Birkin was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire \"for services to acting and UK-French cultural relations\".[68] She received the Order from the Prince of Wales in April 2002.[69]\n\nIn 2013, she and her daughter, Lou Doillon, were appointed to the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres as Chevaliers.[70] In 2022, she was raised to the highest rank in the order – Commandeur.[71] She was also awarded the French Ordre National du Mérite in 2004 and 2015.[72]\n\nIn 2018, she was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun in the Spring Conferment for her efforts in promoting cultural exchanges between Japan and France.[73]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nBirkin basket\n\n[edit]\n\nBirkin was described as having carried a hand-woven straw basket from Castro Marim in Algarve, Portugal, everywhere she went[74]—from the market,[75] to nightclubs,[76] to formal events—until her husband Jacques Doillon intentionally ran over it with his car in the early 1980s.[77][78][79][80]\n\nBirkin bag\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1983, Hermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas was seated next to Birkin on a flight from Paris to London. Birkin had just placed her straw basket in the overhead compartment of her seat when the contents fell out onto the floor, leaving her scrambling to recover them. Birkin explained to Dumas that it had been difficult to find a leather weekend bag she liked.[81] In 1984, he created a black supple leather bag for her: the Birkin bag,[82] based on a 1982 design. She used the bag initially, but later changed her mind because she was carrying too many things in it: \"What's the use of having a second one?\" she said laughingly. \"You only need one and that busts your arm; they're bloody heavy. I'm going to have an operation for tendinitis in the shoulder.\"[83] Nonetheless, Birkin did use the bag for some time.[84] The Birkin bag has, over the years, become a status symbol, with prices ranging from US$10,000 to $500,000.[85]\n\nIn 2015, Birkin wrote a public letter to Hermès requesting her name be removed from the bag,[85] stating she wanted the company to \"debaptise the Birkin Croco until better practices in line with international norms can be put in place\", referring to the cruel methods used to acquire the skins for the crocodile variant of the bags.[86] Hermès announced soon afterwards that it had satisfied Birkin with new reassurances on this.[87]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1965 The Knack ...and How to Get It Girl on a motorbike Uncredited[102] 1966 The Idol A blonde Uncredited[102] 1966 Kaleidoscope Exquisite Thing [103] 1966 Blowup The Blonde [103] 1968 Wonderwall Penny Lane [103] 1969 La Piscine Penelope [103] Les Chemins de Katmandou Jane [103] Slogan Evelyne [103] 1970 Trop petit mon ami Christine Mars / Christine Devone [103] Cannabis Jane Swenson Also known as: French Intrigue[102][103] May Morning Flora Finlake Also known as: Alba Pagana[103] 1971 Devetnaest djevojaka i jedan mornar Milja [102] Romance of a Horsethief Naomi [102][104] 1972 Trop jolies pour être honnêtes Christine [105] 1973 Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye Corringa [106] Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman Clara [107] Dark Places Alta [108] Private Screening Kate / Hélène [109] 1974 Le Mouton enragé Marie-Paule [110] How to Do Well When You are a Jerk and a Crybaby Jane [111] Serious as Pleasure Ariane Berg [112] Lucky Pierre Jackie Logan Also known as: I'm Losing My Temper[113] 1975 La Course à l'échalote Janet [114] Catherine et Compagnie Catherine [115] Sept morts sur ordonnance Jane Berg [116] 1976 Burnt by a Scalding Passion Virginia Vismara [117] Je t'aime moi non plus Johnny Nominated – César Award for Best Actress[118][119] 1977 L'Animal Female film star [120] 1978 Death on the Nile Louise Bourget [103] 1979 Au bout du bout du banc Peggy [121] Melancoly Baby Olga [122] La miel Inés [123] 1980 Egon Schiele – Excess and Punishment Wally Neuzil [124] 1981 The Prodigal Daughter [fr] Anne [125] Rends-moi la clé!
