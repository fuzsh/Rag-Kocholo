        "text": "Shortly after returning home one evening with her husband, Alma is visited by her one-time lesbian lover Carole. In the ensuing emotional torrent, Alma allows herself to be abducted by Carole and taken to a hotel, pursued by a young girl an unnamed friend of Carole and an eccentric bystander posing as a private detective. Before Alma and Carole can resolve their situation, Almas husband Andrew appears on the scene and, in a mad frenzy, attempts to reclaim his wife. Jacques Doillon is no stranger to controversy, and La Pirate revolves around five disparate characters about whom we know nothing. In this film, arguably his most provocative work, he assaults our sensibilities with a puzzling and harrowing portrayal of searing naked emotion."
