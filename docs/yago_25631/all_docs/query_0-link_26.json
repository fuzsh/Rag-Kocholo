        "text": "Don’t miss La Pirate in the double-feature event An Evening with Jane Birkin and Charlotte Gainsbourg, featuring a discussion with Birkin and Gainsbourg, on January 29 at 6:30pm.\n\nOn a rain-slicked night, Alma (Jane Birkin), a married woman, is whisked away to a hotel by her female ex-lover (Maruschka Detmers). So begins a long night’s journey into extreme emotional violence, as the two women make love, quarrel, and confront their love-hate feelings for each other—a volatile situation that’s pushed into overdrive when Alma’s husband (played by Birkin’s brother, Andrew, in a bit of provocatively incestuous casting) shows up. Meanwhile, a mystery: just who is the gun-toting teenage girl and the oddball gentleman seemingly along for the ride? Stylish, sexy, and subtly surreal, this fever-pitch portrait of amour fou is bathed in shadowy neo-noir atmosphere courtesy of cinematographer extraordinaire Bruno Nuytten."
