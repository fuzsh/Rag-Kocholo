        "text": "French director, born in Paris in 1944.\n\nJacques Doillon made his debut as an editor at the age of twenty-three. He then shot many documentary shorts before directing, alongside Jean Rouch and Alain Resnais, one of the three films in the trilogy The Year 01. In 1974, his first feature film, Touched in the Head attracted the attention of François Truffaut, who recommended him to the producer of A Bag of Marbles (1975) for the adaptation of the eponymous novel by Joseph Joffo. A rich filmography of over thirty films was to follow, often intimist films such as The Hussy (1979), The Pirate (1984) – both in official competition at Cannes – The 15 Year Old Girl (1989), The Little Gangster (1990), Young Werther (1993), Ponette (1996) or Love Battles (2013). He also directed a 12-episode series for Arte, Germaine and Benjamin, about the relationship between Germaine de Staël and Benjamin Constant."
