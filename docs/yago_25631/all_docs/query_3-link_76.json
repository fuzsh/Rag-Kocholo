        "text": "French directors Benoit Jacquot (“Farewell, My Queen”) and Jacques Doillon (“The Little Gangster”) were summoned by police on July 1 for questioning in connection with complaints filed by actor Judith Godreche on Feb. 8.\n\nThe two directors were taken in custody by the Juvenile Protection Brigade, according to the AFP.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nCannes Kicks Off With France's Film Industry Engulfed in Belated #MeToo Reckoning: 'It Took Much Longer'\n\nCannes Film Festival Adds Short 'Moi Aussi' Directed by France's #MeToo Figure Judith Godreche\n\n'Tack' Takes Intimate and Powerful Journey Into Charges of Sexual Abuse That Sparked Greece's #MeToo Movement\n\nGodrèche lodged a rape complaint against Jacquot and accused him of “predation” and “violent rape of a minor under 15 years old committed by a person in authority.” She met Jacquot in 1986, when she was 14 years old (the director was then 39) on the set of his movie “Les Mendiants,” and began a relationship with him which went on for six years. She also starred in his 1990 film “La Desenchantée.” The offences were alleged to have taken place between 1986 and 1992. Jacquot has denied all of Godrèche’s accusations.\n\nThe director’s attorney, Julia Minkowski, told Variety that Benoît Jacquot “had requested to be heard since the beginning of the investigation. He will finally be able to express himself before authorities.”\n\nMinkowski also noted that the Paris prosecutor had “refused to give him access to the files of the procedure, despite the continued attacks on the presumption of innocence.”\n\nDoillon, meanwhile, has been accused by Godreche of two counts of sexual assault in the 1980’s when she was a minor. Godreche claimed the sexual assault happened at the home that Doillon shared with his then partner Jane Birkin, during the shoot of “La fille de 15 ans.” Godrèche, who was at the time in a relationship with Jacquot, had the lead role in Doillon’s film and starred alongside Melvil Poupaud and Doillon himself. The movie came out in 1989. Doillon has denied these claims. Variety has reached out to Doillon’s legal representation for comment.\n\nAn actor-turned-filmmaker who presented the short film “Moi Aussi” on opening night of Un Certain Regard at Cannes, Godreche has been credited for spearheading France’s new MeToo reckoning with her allegations against Jacquot and Doillon. Since she filed these complaints against the two directors, other female actors came forward to accuse them. Julia Roy accused Jacquot of sexual assault, while Isild le Besco accused him of rape. Le Besco, who is Maiwenn’s estranged sister, has also accused Doillon of sexually inappropriate behavior, as did Anna Mouglalis.\n\nGodreche’s testimonies have also led the French parliament to approve the creation of a commission whose task is to investigate abuse and sexual violence within France’s film and TV industry, as well as performing arts, advertising and fashion. It remains to be seen whether this commission will be pursued in the wake of France’s overhaul of the National Assembly. The far right party, Rassemblement National, which won the first round of the parliamentary elections and could soon enter the French government, has a lackluster track record when it comes to progressive issues, including women’s rights.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in July 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in July 2024\n\nEmmy Predictions: Guest Acting - 'The Bear,' 'Hacks,' 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' 'SNL' and More Deliver 277 Contenders Across 4 Categories"
