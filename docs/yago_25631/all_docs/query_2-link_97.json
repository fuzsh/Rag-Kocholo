I know I sure as hell do. Enter: Boat Collective. My right-hand and I attended BC’s first Floating Session of the summer (ahhh, it feels good to say […]\n\nIn celebration of Romance Awareness Month, eHarmony asked us for our favourite romantic date ideas. Whether you want to impress that first date, celebrate an anniversary, or rekindle an old flame, you need some dates that turn up the volume. From fine dining to freefalling, here are Perth’s most romantic dates…. For the high […]\n\nThe Blue Room Theatre’s latest offering is everything you’d expect from highbrow contemorary indie theatre: it’s a thoughtful, interrogative piece about isolation and loss; it’s a piece presented by some of the most promising names in the independent theatre scene; and, of course, it’s the kind of thing that makes you think long after it’s […]\n\nFour lanky people in gold morph suits, teased hair speckled with glitter, heads bowed, shuffling silently in line as they enter the space.

There’s the camaraderie, and the intimacy of the one-on-one, and that undeniable thrill of pulling together your best words, to make your story an absolute cracker – one that’ll have your friend going home saying, “you won’t believe what […]\n\nI’ll admit that those fantasies I indulge myself in about my glamorous artistic adult life are lacking reference to an aspect of sophistication I actually see as quite important: an appreciation of ballet. How elegant, how worldly, how knowledgeable one must be to not only enjoy the ballet, but to understand and appreciate the finesse […]\n\nA man in the crowd in front of me was telling his friend some facts about jazz bassist Richard Bona, who we were about to see perform.
