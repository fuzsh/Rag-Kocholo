        "text": "(1996)\n\nDirected by Jacques Doillon\n\nWritten by Jacquest Doillon (with first draft collaboration of Brune Compagnon\n\nStarring Victoire Thivisol\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nChild actors in American films are often problematic. There is a tendency to make them precocious or stagy, removing any sign of the natural. Non-Hollywood films, though, often find ways to get strong and natural performances from children, and one of the best examples of this is Ponette.\n\nPonette (Victoire Thivisol) is a four-year-old girl whose mother dies in a car accident. She goes to live with her aunt, who later sends her off to boarding school. Ponette is too young to understand the concept of death and keeps looking for her mother to return. Other children are helpful and cruel in addressing her hopes.\n\nThe movie succeeds on the performance of Thivisol. She was only four when the film was shot and is just wonderful. Her search for her mother is filled with pathos and is mesmerizing.\n\nThivisol was nominated and won several acting awards for the film. There was some complaints – can we really call what she did on the screen “acting”? – but that doesn’t matter. The result is a sad a beautiful film about moving on.\n\n(1962)\n\nCreated by Bob Kane\n\nStarring Dallas McKinnon\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nBob Kane was an important name in comic books. Known as the creator of Batman,* he tried his hand in other forms, and one of the more successful examples was the animated Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse.\n\nCourageous Cat was a crime fighter, working with his assistant Minute Mouse. He drove a Cat Car, which he kept in the Cat Cave, and sometimes flew in his Cat Plane.** They would discover criminals and take them to justice.\n\nTheir main adversary was Frog, an Edward G. Robinson imitation. Minute Mouse existed solely to point out what was happening,*** so Courageous Cat could take out his gun and save the day.\n\nOr, rather, his many guns. When faced by a threat, he’d have one on hand specifically designed to counteract it.****\n\nThe cartoons were short. I get the impression that it syndicated to morning kids shows across the country as filler. None were particularly outstanding adventures, but they were entertaining enough for kids.\n\nThe most memorable thing was the show’s theme song. It was a variation on Henry Mancini’s Peter Gunn Theme and was often the best thing of any adventure.\n\nI’m not really sure how involved Kane was; he may have just leant his name as a selling point.\n\nThe show ran two years, not a bad run for something like this. But eventually, even Bob Kane’s name couldn’t keep it going.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n*Reports indicate that Kane’s influence was primarily in coming up with the concept and choosing the name “Batman.” Bill Finger did most of the writing on the strip in the beginning, including creating nearly everything we think of when we think of the character. Kane did the art in the early days, but soon left that to assistants . Although Kane often talked about Finger as a collaborator, Kane was the only byline on the strip (and DC was contractually obligated to give him the single credit).\n\n**Fairly obvious where Kane got the idea.\n\n***Probably because it was cheaper than animating action.\n\n****Deus ex Machina gun would be a good description.\n\n(1960)\n\nDirected by Terence Fisher\n\nWritten by Jimmy Sangster & Peter Bryan & Edward Percy\n\nStarring Peter Cushing, Yvonne Moniaur, David Peel, Martita Hunt\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nI love vampire stories. I’ve written a few and tend to like variations on the basic mythology. One small but entertaining example of the genre is The Brides of Dracula.\n\nIt’s the story of Marianne Danielle (Yvonne Moniaur), who we first see in a carriage speeding to get to a village by nightfall. Of course, the villagers act very strangely toward her, leaving the inn. And then the Baroness Meinster (Martita Hunt), arrives and, since there’s no room at the inn, invited her to stay at her castle – much to the consternation of the innkeeper and his wife.\n\nThe Baroness is welcoming but Marianne notices a second setting at the table. And when she is preparing, she sees a man on a terrace just outside her balcony. When she asks the Baroness, she explains he’s just her insane son (David Peel).\n\nBut Marianne has to see for herself.* She finds her way to the son’s room. He is sweet and charming and quickly wins her over. The only problem is that his mother keeps him chained in his room. He asks her to get the key.\n\nYou can probably guess what happens next. The Baron is a vampire and turns his mother, then escapes to terrorize the countryside. Dr.Van Helsing (Cushing) has been called and he works to find the Baron and kill him.\n\nThe movie’s strong point, of course, is Peter Cushing’s performance. His Van Helsing is ruthless toward vampires and kindly toward everyone else.\n\nDavid Peel also makes an excellent vampire. I’m not sure if this is the first time, but it’s clearly a landmark in the portrayal of a seductive vampire. Peel is charming when he needs to be and you can understand Marianne’s attraction.\n\nMartita Hunt is also notable. She had a strong Miss Haversham air to her – not surprising since the played the role years before.\n\nThe movie certainly isn’t perfect. The bat version of the Baron is as bad an example of the effect as you’d ever seen.** And the opening sequence of the ride is the woods is good, but has nothing to do with the story, other than to give us a chance to see Peter Cushing lurking menacingly.\n\nBut the final sequence – set in a old mill*** is nicely designed and staged, with a clever way of killing the vampire.\n\nThis was David Peel’s last credited film. Primarily a TV actor, he retired from acting soon after.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\n*In many ways, Marianne is not particularly smart.\n\n**Reports are that they put a lot of effort into a realistic looking bat, but it somehow got lost before shooting, so they had to improvise.\n\n***Frankenstein’s monster doesn’t show up, alas.\n\n(1962)\n\nMusic, Book, and Lyrics by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley\n\nStarrting Anthony Newley and Anna Quayle\n\nWikipedia Page\n\nI’m a big fan of Broadway musicals and one of the best things about them is that they’re constantly reimagined and restaged, both in New York and on the road, so new audiences can find them. At the same time, small theater company and school dramatic groups will put on the classics. It’s rare that a major musical seems to disappear, but that’s what happed to one musical with one of the best scores of all time, Stop the World, I Want to Get Off!\n\nThe play is the brainchild of Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse, who wore most of the hats when creating it. It’s the story of Littlechap (Newley), who, as his name suggests, is an everyman character. He marries Evie (Anna Quayle) after she becomes pregnant and is soon disillusioned, having affairs with a Russian woman Anya (Quayle), Ilse (Quayle) from Germany, and the All American Ginnie (Quayle). It wasn’t until the end that he begins to realize just how much he wasted his life.\n\nThe strength of the play is the music, with one of the best scores of all time. “Once in a Lifetime,” “Gonna Build a Mountain,” and especially “What Kind of Fool Am I?” are standards, but the rest of the score is excellent. One song – “Typically English/Glorious Russian/Typische Deuche/All American” – is sung, with different lyrics by all four of the women. “Family Fugue/Nag! Nag! Nag!” is a hilarious narrative of a deteriorating marriage. “Mumbo Jumbo” makes fun of politicians, while “Lumbered” shows Littlechap’s second thoughts about his marriage.\n\nThe play was a hit in the UK, and moved to the US, partly because its small cast – four main characters and a chorus, all performed on a single set – made it cheap to produce. It was nominated for four Tonys, and won one, for Anna Quayle.\n\nBut the play seems to have faded away. Much of the plot to too topical about the Cold War and politics of the time. But certainly it has nothing to do with the score. There were two revivals, one with Sammy Davis, Jr. (who love the score) in 1978, and another starring Newley in London in 1989, which did poorly.\n\nNewley and Bricusse continued to work together. Their next attempt, The Roar of the Greasepaint, the Smell of the Crowd, did adequately and produced a couple of standards, but their best known work was writing the songs for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nNewley died in 1999.\n\n(1968)\n\nWritten and Directed by Ingmar Bergman\n\nStarring Liv Ullmann, Max von Sydow, Gunner Bjornstrand\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nIngmar Bergman is considered the master of gloom. While he did do some comedies, most of his work was not even close to being cheerful.\n\nI had a major immersion on Bergman in college, taking a film course that concentrated on his works – 19 films in ten weeks.* It fascinating to see him develop over the years. Shame was one film that really stuck with me.\n\nJan (Max von Sydow) and Eva (Liv Ullman) are living on the remote farmhouse when it becomes caught up in a war. Troops “liberate” them, though they don’t feel very liberated and Col. Jacobi (Gunner Bjornstrand), the former mayor, comes by, seeming to help, but he has plans for Eva, offering to help them out – for a terrible price.\n\nLiv Ullman was one of the 20th century’s greatest film actresses and Max von Sydow is nearly as well regarded, though better known in the US. They make Jan and Eva real and we share their pain.\n\nGunner Bjornstrand is lesser known, but he was a consistent member of Bergman’s stock company, making nearly 20 films with him. He never gained international acclaim, but I began to look forward to his presence as I watched the Bergman film.\n\nAn interesting aside is that the movie was set in the near future, making it science fiction. It’s one of the best evocations of how war can brutalize bystanders.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n*Union College had (and still has) a trimester system: three ten-week terms where you take three courses. It makes transferring credits challenging.\n\n(1949)\n\nDirected by Howard Hawks\n\nWritten by Charles Lederer & Leonard Spigelgass and Hagar Wilde, from a story by Henri Rochard.\n\nStarring Cary Grant, Ann Sheridan\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nCary Grant is generally thought of today as a suave and romantic leading man. But Grant was also a fine comedian, and seemed very much to like playing comic roles. One of the best of these was in I Was a Male War Bride.\n\nIt’s set in Germany after WWII has ended. Cathy Gates (Ann Sheridan) is a American assigned to drive French Army Captain Henri Rochard (Cary Grant) in a mission to recruit a German to join the American side. Cathy and Henri rub each other the wrong way from the start,* but slowly warm to each other and fall in love. They marry, but Cathy is immediately ordered back to the states. Henri wants to go with her, but the only way to do it is to get permission under the War Brides Act.** The problem is that, even though the law does allow this, it happens so rarely that no one believes it.\n\nThe movie has the typical Hawks fast pace, and works very nicely in making the romance seem believable. Red tape can be very funny onscreen, and the movie makes the most of that.\n\nGrant is Grant and is willing to take a pratfall in order to sell a gag.\n\nOne of my favorite running gags is Grant having to repeatedly recite “I am an alien spouse of female military personnel en route to the United States under public law 271 of the Congress” whenever he has to explain what’s going on. The payoff is when they finally get things settle and someone explains to him – in the exact same words he’s been using all along. I’ve had similar things happen to me and they always remind me of the movie.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\n*A typical event in romantic comedies of the era.\n\n**An actual law, that allowed GIs to bring their wives back to the US without being screened out at immigration.\n\n(1906-1972)\n\nWikipedia Page\n\nSome people are famous for being famous. That was how I first noticed Oscar Levant in the 60s, most notably from the title of his autobiography, Memoirs of an Amnesiac. All I knew was that he seemed to show up on talk shows and people regarded him well. It wasn’t until much later that I learned about his genius.\n\nLevant was born in Pittsburg, but moved to New York City in his teens, where he studied piano. He became quite good at it, and moved to Hollywood, where he befriended George Gershwin and worked as a composer, writing both film music and hit songs, as well as working on classical pieces.\n\nIn the early 30s, he came to public attention as one of the panelists on the radio show Information Please. Levant became known for his encyclopedic knowledge and his quick wit. He was a master of ad libbing hilarious one-liners.\n\nThis became his step toward stardom. He started appearing in movies, usually playing a wisecracking pianist. His most extensive role was probably in The Band Wagon, where he’s songwriting parter with Nanette Fabray.* He even briefly had a TV show.\n\nHis piano playing, though, took him into the classical world. He became known as one of the best interpreters of George Gershwin and his recording of Rhapsody in Blue was for many years considered one of the best.\n\nThrough everything, Levant had a rather complicated personal life. He was a massive hypochondriac, and had numerous neuroses, which he was very open about.\n\nHe also tended to do his own thing. Harpo Marx told of how he just showed up on his doorstep one day, announcing he was going to be Harpo’s houseguest and stayed there for months. Levant did that to other of this friends and then, suddenly, announce he was leaving and go somewhere else.\n\nHarpo also praised his piano playing. In one story, he interrupted the performance of a trio, replaced the pianist and finished the piece with them – one he had never played before – so that the others in the group felt like he’d been practicing with them for years.\n\nLevant was a heavy smoker and died of a heart attack in 1972. Much of his radio work has been lost, and the talk show appearances are even harder to find. But I still was able to find one of of his greatest one-liners, the one that showed me he was a comic genius.\n\nThere’s not a lot about him on the Internet, and his book is out of print, but he was a man who was always a delight wherever he appeared – neurotic tics and all.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n*Supposedly, based on Betty Comden and Adolph Green.\n\n(1973)\n\nDirected by Lindsay Anderson\n\nWritten by David Sherman, based on an original idea by Malcolm McDowell\n\nStarring Malcolm McDowell, Ralph Richardson, Rachel Roberts, Arthur Lowe, Helen Mirren\n\nIMDB Page\n\nIn 1968, British director Lindsay Anderson had a success with the movie, If…, starring Malcolm McDowell in his first major film role as a British schoolboy who ends up leading a bloody revolution against his school. McDowell want to work with Anderson again, and the director suggested he write a screenplay based upon his life so far. A few years later, McDowell, now a big name after his lead role in A Clockwork Orange, handed a treatment to screen writer David Sherman.* The result was O Lucky Man!\n\nIn the meantime, Anderson had struck up a friendship with songwriter Alan Price, planning a documentary about the band touring England. That fell through, but Anderson decided to ask Price to write the songs for the movie. These were quickly included and an album released.\n\nThe movie is hard to describe. It shows Mick Travis** trying to find his way in life, starting out as a coffee salesman*** and moving on, trying to keep his principles in a world where success requires he ignore him. It’s a very picaresque movie, where Mick goes from one thing to another, some real, some surreal. Actors play multiple characters throughout the film and there’s an allegorical subtext about the entire enterprise.\n\nThe final scene is memorable: Travis ends up at a casting call, where a director (Lindsay Anderson) is clearly casting If…\n\nThroughout, the Alan Price songs comment on the action.\n\nThe movie was a critical success and eventually Anderson and McDowell were reunited for a third Mick Travis film,Britannia Hospital. The three films a a long allegory about life in the UK in the 60s, and are fun to watch on many levels.\n\n________________________________________________\n\n*Screenwriter of If…\n\n**The same name of McDowell’s character in If…\n\n***A job McDowell had before he became an actor.\n\n(1958 – )\n\nMembers: Don Wilson (rhythm guitar), Bob Bogle (lead guitar, bass), Nokie Edwards (bass, lead guitar), Howie Johnson (drums), Mel Taylor (drums).\n\nWikipedia Page\n\nBand Webpage\n\nOne of my jobs at my college radio station was to listen to new albums as they came in, pick the top tracks, and decide if we wanted to keep them. One day a new album came in from a group I had thought was washed up years ago. But playing it, I discovered that, even though they seemed to be relics of the past, they were still able to put out some excellent stuff, and I immediately gained a new respect for them. That group, of course, was the Ventures.\n\nThe group was formed by Don Wilson and Bob Bogle in 1958. Wilson and Bogle were both guitarists; they added Nokie Edwards as bass, and Howie Johnson as their drummer. Edwards later switched to lead guitar, with Bogle picking up the bass.\n\nTheir first single, “Walk Don’t Run” was a major hit. Like most of the Ventures’ work, it was an instrumental and a cover, but it put the group on the map. The Ventures helped to develop the “surf music” sound that the Beach Boys made their own.\n\nAfter getting hurt in a car accident, Howie Johnson stepped out, and Mel Taylor replaced him to form the longest lived lineup of the group.\n\nThe Ventures were nothing if not prolific. They did dozens of studio albums in the 60s, 3-5 a year. It probably helped that they were a cover band, which allowed them to keep up that sort of pace. But they didn’t remain in the public consciousness. Their albums* did OK, but they had very little success on the singles charts. They fell out of consciousness until 1969, when they were tapped to play the theme song for a new TV show. “The Hawaii 5-0 Theme” was their biggest hit and what they’re best known for today.\n\nThe group is known for pioneering new musical ideas. They created concept albums, with The Colorful Ventures in 1961** and were one of the first to use a fuzzbox.\n\nThough the group stopped making the charts with “Hawaii 5-0,” the continued to perform and record and were especially popular in Japan.***\n\nThe group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. They continue to tour today (mostly in Japan), with Don Wilson still taking part.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n*They were primarily an album band, unusual for the early 60s.\n\n**Each song had a color in the title.\n\n*** Since they mainly did instrumentals, the language barrier isn’t an issue.\n\n( 2016)\n\nCreated and Written by Howard Overman\n\nStarring Clara Theobald, Susan Wakoma, Arinze Kene, Lewis Reeves, Riann Steele, Tony Curran, Lu Corfield\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nThere’s so much good TV around these days that some excellent shows get lost in the shuffle. I didn’t hear about Crazyhead until recently, and when I discovered it was written by Howard Overman of Misfits (the best superhero show ever broadcast), I knew I had to watch it.\n\nThe story starts out with Amy (Clara Theobald), who works at a bowling alley and has been having some strange visions. She thinks she’s cracking up until she runs into Raquel (Susan Wakoma), who sets her straight: the two of them have the ability to see demons, who possess humans, killing them. Amy’s best friend Suzanne (Riann Steele) is one of them, and they have to perform an exorcism, which goes horribly wrong. But they discover that Raquel is an essential element of a plot by Callum (Tony Curran) to set loose the gates of hell and release demons into the world. Callum also is Raquel’s psychologist, and uses this to keep one step ahead of them. The enlist Jake (Lewis Reeves), a guy from work who has a crush on Amy as their ally, while keeping everything secret from Raquel’s brother Tyler – who Amy is attracted to.\n\nThe parallels to Buffy the Vampire Slayer are clear, and the show is much like it, with a sense of humor about everything, like the demon Mercy (Lu Corfield) who has taken over a single mother and laments having to get a babysitter when she goes out to destroy the world.\n\nSusan Wakoma is just plain terrific as Raquel – blunt, foul mouthed, and strongly opinionated. She won an award for best performance and certainly deserves it.\n\nClara Theobald is very good as Amy, a voice of reason against Raquel’s wilder side. Tony Curran makes a great villain – devious but capable of getting off some very good lines.\n\nThe show ran for six episodes, finishing the first story arc. Unfortunately, it was not picked up for a second season. But it’s available on Netflix and is extremely good. Not quite Misfits (but that’s hard to top), but an excellent supernatural comedy horror show.\n\n(1982)\n\nDirected by Richard Loncraine\n\nWritten by Michael Palin\n\nStarring Michael Palin, Maggie Smith, Trevor Howard, Denholm Elliott, Phoebe Nicholls\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nHandMade Films was a UK-based film company that had a long list of good films to its credit in the 1980s. It’s founding was due to a favor. The Monty Python group had discovered that the financing for Life of Brian fell through at the last minute, George Harrison stepped in to produce it.* The studio continued successfully for about twenty years, producing dramas like The Long Good Friday and comedies (often involving the Monty Python actors) like The Missionary.\n\nIn 1906, the Rev. Charles Fortescue (Michael Palin) is returning to England after ten years as a missionary in Africa, where his fiancée, Deborah Fairbanks (Phoebe Nicholls). Fortescue is soon given an assignment by the Bishop (Denholm Elliott) to help fallen women redeem themselves. To help set things up, Fortescue writes for money from Lord Ames (Trevor Howard) and is invited to their home, where he meets his wife Lady Isobel (Maggie Smith), who is especially interested in the project (and in Fortescue). But Fortescue goes into the work and begins to develop a . . . different way to bring the women to his church.\n\nMichael Palin is perhaps the most underrated comedian in Monty Python, and shows off his acting in portraying Fortescue as an innocent who slowly begins to figure out what is going on. Maggie Smith is excellent (of course) as Lady Isobel, who is far from the prim and proper English lady. Phoebe Nicholls is a wonderful surprise as the aggressively naïve fiancée** and the rest of the cast is filled with veteran UK actors who know how to make the most of their roles.\n\nThe movie is more amusing than laugh-out-loud funny, but is an entertaining and somewhat bawdy delight.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n* Eric Idle called it “the most expensive movie ticket every bought.”\n\n** When asked what she thinks a fallen woman is, she says, “Women who have hurt their knees?”\n\n(1964-65)\n\nWikipedia Entry\n\nI was turning twelve when the 1964 New York World’s Fair came to Flushing. It was a couple of hours away from where I lived and its combination of spectacle and education. I loved it.\n\nThe fair was an attempt to repeat the success of the 1939 New York World’s Fair, but it ran into a snag. The Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) had rules as to what could be termed a “World’s Fair,” and the New York one broke several of them, so the fair was not officially sanctioned, and its members were told not to take part. But New York went ahead anyway, and used exhibits from corporations and from countries that were not BIE members.\n\nBack then, I didn’t pay much attention to the politics (though I did know it wasn’t official). It was a World’s Fair as far as I was concerned, and I loved it.\n\nTwelve wasn’t considered too young to be on your own, so several times I wandered the grounds on my own.\n\nSome of the things that still stay in my mind.\n\nThe Vatican Pavilion. One of the must-see items of the fair, since they brought Michelangelo's Pieta to the US for the first time. In order to accommodate the crowds, you stood on a conveyor belt that rushed you past the statue in about 30 seconds. The statue was behind a glass wall with a blue background. I remember being vaguely disappointed by it.\n\nGeneral Electric. A favorite, partially because my father sold GE appliances and TVs. “The Carousel of Progress” was the big draw, showing how electricity had changed everyday life. A similar exhibit was set up in Disney World,* with one essential difference: in the World’s Fair, the audience moved on a carousel around the exhibits in the center. Nowadays, the audience remains in one place while the center turns. That was a big disappointment when I saw the exhibit in Disney World.\n\nThe Ford Motor Company. It had a “Magic Skyway” ride, where you got into an actual Ford convertible and saw models of history from prehistoric times to the future of 2000. I remember the cars more than I do the rides.\n\nGeneral Motors. Their answer was “Futurama.” Their moving chairs were no match for Ford’s cars, but their vision of the future in the 21st century was just what my science-fiction loving heart desired.\n\nPepsi Pavilion. Loosed “It’s a Small World After All” on the world. I found it cloying even back then.\n\nEquitable Life.(above) Not much there except for a giant readout showing the current population of the US. For some reason, I found that fascinating.\n\nNew York State Pavilion. I liked the fact that they showed my (rather small) home town on a giant map of the city. It had three observation towers, who are best known today as a plot element of Men in Black.\n\nBelgian Pavilion I didn’t spend much time here, but it was famous for introducing American to Belgian Waffles and for the fact that it was so delayed that it wasn’t completed until the final day of the first season of the fair.\n\nTad’s Steak House. One of the restaurants at the fair. Hardly the best, but quite a bargain – a steak dinner for $1.29! You got what now I’d call an indifferent grilled steak, baked potatoes, and garlic bread. All during my youth, a trip to NYC included at stop at Tad’s.\n\nI probably went five or six times; toward the end, the novelty had worn off. My mother, who had been to the New York World’s Fair in 1939 said that this was nowhere near as good, but I thought it was great.\n\nOf course, it came to and end. Most of the pavilions were taken down (I had thought that was a waste, though it seems none were built to last more than a few years, anyway). The two that remained were New York and the Unisphere, the symbol of the Fair.\n\nStill, it gave me many happy memories.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n*Disney had created many of the rides at the fair.\n\n(2016- )\n\nCreated by Michael Schur\n\nStarring Kristen Bell, Ted Danson, William Jackson Harper, D'Arcy Carden, Jamella Jamil, Manny Jacinto\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nIt's rare that I talk about a TV show currently in production; I've only done it once. But I'm going to add another with what is both the funniest and cleverest TV currently on major network TV: The Good Place.\n\nThe premise of the show is a little different: the main character dies in the very beginning. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) finds herself in the Good Place, where you go where you live is particularly exemplary. She is briefed by Michael (Ted Danson), who is the architect of the place, designed for eternal bliss and is given a house and a soul mate Chidi (William Jackson Harper). There's only one problem: She's there by mistake.\n\nEleanor's life was far from exemplary, and she knows it. She confesses this to Chidi and learns that there's also a Bad Place, which is just plain awful. So she enlists him to help her pass.\n\nThey are next door to Tahani (Jamella Jamil), a woman who raised billions of dollars for charity and her soul mate Jianyu, a Buddhist monk who's kept a vow of silence since he was a child. Eleanor takes a dislike to Tahani for her goody-goody unctuousness, but doesn't want to risk being found out. She also gets information from Janet (D'Arcy Carden), an information assistant who is there to answer questions.\n\nThings are bad enough for Eleanor, but she discovers that, because she doesn't belong there, bad things start to happen.\n\nOne great thing is that the show is really an ongoing story. And creator Michael Schur is not afraid to tighten the screws on Eleanor and make changes in the situation. It quickly goes beyond the original setup, and Schur is a master of dropping a bombshell at the end of each episode.\n\nAnd it's funny. Tahani's constant namedropping, Chidi's frustration with Eleanor's self-centeredness, Michael's frustration with things going wrong -- all are a constant source of funny lines. One of the cleverest running gags is the fact that you can't swear in the Good Place, which allows Eleanor to be foulmouthed without making the FCC mad.\n\nAnother very funny gag is the list of the point system that gets you into the Good Place.**\n\nIt's hard to talk about the show without giving away too much, but I will say that it's even funnier if you watch it all a second time.\n\nNBC has the entire first season (13 episodes) on line. Watch it, and then go back and watch it again. You won't be disappointed.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n*For example, \"Holy motherforking shirtballs!\"\n\n**There's also a serious discussion of philosophy and what makes someone \"good\" hidden among the jokes and plot.\n\nNote: Any comment containing spoilers will be deleted.\n\n(1961-69)\n\nStarring Joey Bishop, Abby Dalton, Corbett Monica, Joe Besser, Mary Treen\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nThe Rat Pack is back in style and people know all about Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr., who have become Las Vegas icons. But in their original incarnation, there were two others: Peter Lawford, who is best known these days (if at all) for marrying into the Kennedy clan, and Joey Bishop.\n\nBishop was a comedian who actually wrote most of the jokes for the rest of the pack. After he turned to acting, he caught the attention of Danny Thomas, who put him into an episode of Make Room for Daddy, as Joey Mason, a bumbling Hollywood PR agent. The next year, this setup (with the character renamed Joey Barnes) formed the basis for The Joey Bishop Show.\n\nIt wasn’t a success. It stumbled along with mediocre ratings the first year. NBC gave it another chance, with the request it be revamped. So, in 1962, everything had changed.* Bishop was the only cast member retained and the concept was that he was a talk show host who lived in New York. He was married to Ellie (Abby Dalton) and was friends with his head writer Larry Corbett (Corbett Monica). The cast was rounded out by Mr. Jilson (Joe Besser), and Hilda (Mary Treen), their maid.\n\nThe show was filled with gentle comedy. The jokes may have worn a little thin, but the stories hold up surprisingly well. Barnes is a decent guy with a sense of humor and Bishop’s relaxed and subtle style – he never appeared to work to be funny – was charming to watch.\n\nThe cast was a delight. I think I had a little crush on Abby Dalton; her Ellie was well rounded and very grounded. Corbett Monica – a successful standup comedian, too,** and had some of the sharper line.\n\nJoe Besser, of course, is a familiar name. He was the fifth of the Three Stooges, a replacement after Shemp died. He is not well regarded by Stooges fans, but he was usually the best thing in the mostly recycled films of their later career. I remember liking Mr. Jillson mostly because he was one of the Stooges, and he was better here than with the other two.\n\nThe show moved to CBS for its final season. In 1967, Bishop tried to compete with Johnny Carson with a late night show that ran for two seasons. After that, he worked occasionally, but never headlined.\n\nIt’s too bad. Once it found its stride, the show is one of the best of its era.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n*I’m featuring this version of the show, since it’s the one I watched as a teen.\n\n**I was delighted to see him as one of the comedians talking in the deli in Woody Allen’s Broadway Danny Rose.\n\n(2002)\n\nDirected by Niki Caro\n\nWritten by Niki Caro, from a book by Witi Ihmaera\n\nStarring Keisha Castle-Hughes, Rawiri Paratene\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nLike many small countries, New Zealand’s film industry is small* and few of their films make it to the US. Despite being English-speaking, they have the curse of being considered “foreign films,” so few people go see them. But one of the most successful was the powerful coming-of-age film, Whale Rider.\n\nIt’s the story of Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes), the granddaughter of a village leader, who is the descendant of Paikea, a legendary figure who came to the village by riding a whale. Tradition says that the position is passed on to the eldest grandson of the previous leader, but Pai not only has the misfortune of being a girl and thus ineligible, but her mother and her fraternal twin died in childbirth and there are no more siblings. Her grandfather (Rawiri Paratene) blames her for the deaths, and, when she shows some interest in becoming the next leader, refuses to let her try it because of her gender.\n\nThe movie hinges on Keisha Castle-Hughes. She was 13 when the film was shot, but produced a bravura performance. She was nominated for a best actress Oscar, the youngest person at the time to get that honor, and it was certainly well deserved.\n\nOverall, it’s a story about triumph over hide-bound thinking, and a joyous film to watch.\n\n_________________________________________\n\n*Lord of the Rings was shot there, but it was not a New Zealand film any more than Star Wars was a Moroccan film.\n\n(1967-68)\n\nCreated by Bill Persky and Sam Denoff\n\nStarring: Joby Baer, Ronnie Schell, Julie Parrish, Billy De Wolfe, Goldie Hawn\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nGoldie Hawn rocketed to stardom after appearing on Rowan and Martin’s Laugh In. The story of her getting the role is well known: she was a struggling actress who blew a line at her audition, and giggled at her own mistake. The producers loved it, and gave her a part and her stardom began from her very first regular TV gig . . . except that it’s wrong. Hawn had already moved up the ladder of success with a regular part in the CBS comedy, Good Morning, World.\n\nThe show had a great pedigree. It was created by Dick Van Dyke Show writers Bill Persky and Sam Denoff and had as executive producers TV greats Sheldon Leonard (Make Room for Daddy, Andy Griffith, I Spy) and Carl Reiner (The Dick Van Dyke Show). It was designed as a vehicle for Ronnie Schell, who seemed on the verge of stardom after a stint on Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C.).\n\nThe show was about two morning DJs – David Lewis (Joby Baker) and Larry Clarke (Schell). Lewis was married to Linda (Julie Parrish), while Clarke was a bachelor. Lewis and Clarke often run afoul of their by-the-book boss, Roland B. Hutton (Billy De Wolfe). David and Linda’s next door neighbor, Sandy Kramer (Hawn), acted as a sounding board for Linda and a sometime date for Larry.\n\nThe stories showed how the two men balanced their work life (where they were “crazy” DJs of the time) with their home life. Not entirely innovative, but Persky and Denoff were among the top writers of sitcoms in their day, writing many classic episodes of Dick van Dyke and That Girl, so the show was consistently funny.\n\nDuring the show’s run, Laugh-In was cast and Goldie left. It’s unclear if any of her episodes were run while she was appearing on Laugh-In; if they had, she would have joined the list of people who appeared in series on two different networks at the same time (she certainly qualifies if it’s in the same season).*\n\nDespite a good time slot, the ratings were never particularly good for the show, and it was canceled after one season. Schell returned to Gomer Pyle and the sitcom went to an obscure corner of sitcom heaven.\n\n______________________________________________\n\n*The champion of this was Jim Backus, who was on two series on two networks at the same time – and in the same time slot.\n\n(1963,1964, 1965)\n\nCreated by Merrill Heatter & Bob Quigley\n\nHosted by Dennis James, Carl Reiner\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nFrom back the the radio days, there was a specific style of game show, where the game really wasn’t the point. The best-known early example of that was Groucho Marx’s You Bet Your Life, where the game took a back seat to the action. More modern examples include things like The Match Game. In the middle, one nice example of the form was People Will Talk.\n\nThe show, hosted by Dennis James, involved asking a group of nine celebrities simple yes-and-no opinion question. Then the contestants would pick a star and say what they thought the answer would be. If they were right, they won money.* It was not intended to be a serious discussion of the question, but the fun was having the celebrity talk about their answers.\n\nTypical questions were “Should there be a different speed limit for women drivers?” or “Are performers really more self-centered and temperamental than other people?”\n\nThe show only lasted six months in its original run in 1963. But the next year, it was back again under the name The Celebrity Game. Carl Reiner had taken over as host, but otherwise it was the same as before.\n\nThe most memorable part of the show for me was on episode where the question was “Should a man wear a toupee?” It was the second question of the show, and during the commercial break Reiner, who had always worn a toupee, appeared without it.**\n\nThe second run wasn’t much more successful than the first, and was cancelled after five months.\n\nBut things weren’t done yet. It was revived once more a (with Reiner again) in the spring of 1965, probably because it was a relatively cheap filler for a terrible timeslot.*** And it also showed up in reruns in the daytime of late 1967-68.\n\nIt clear that creators Heatter and Quigley loved the concept, and finally were able to make it work, when, the next year, they hit the jackpot with nine-celebrity model in The Hollywood Squares.\n\n___________________________________________\n\n*A $100-dollar top prize!\n\n**This was before the classic Dick Van Dyke Show episode where, as Alan Brady, he appeared sans rug.\n\n***Opposite Hazel and Peyton Place.\n\n(1962-63)\n\nCreated by Leonard Stern\n\nStarring John Astin, Marty Ingels, Emmaline Henry, Dave Ketchum, Frank De Vol, Noam Pitlik\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nOne of the joys of watching old sitcoms is seeing familiar people early in their career. I’m Dickens, He’s Fenster is a prime example, a short-lived series that was a stepping stone for several actors who had long careers – though often not as actors.\n\nThe show is about two friends who worked as carpenters. Harry Dickens (John Astin) is married to Kate (Emmaline Henry), while Arch Fenster (Marty Ingels) is single and who isn’t interested in settling down.\n\nThis was basically a workplace comedy. Most of the scenes happened when they were on the job as builders, which gave ample opportunity for slapstick comedy, which was the strength of the show. The plots were the usual melange of 60s humor and plot contrivances, but managed to be funnier than the usual run of the mill.\n\nJohn Astin is fine at Harry, the straight(er) man of the two, though it’s usually Ingels who gets the best lines. Of course, the show didn’t give Astin the type of off-beat strangeness that he used as Gomez Addams.\n\nThe show was created by Leonard Stern. Stern had written for some of the classic shows of the 50s – The Honeymooners and The Phil Silvers Show. This was his first chances as a producer, and the start of a long career that included He & She, Get Smart, The Good Guys, The Governor and J.J. and McMillan & Wife. He also was a publisher of Price Stern Sloan books – best known for Mad Libs.\n\nNo one has to be told how John Astin’s career went after that,* but other regulars continued in show business. Emmaline Henry had a recurring role in I Dream of Jeannie as Dr. Bellows wife.\n\nOthers in the cast made their marks on TV, though not as actors. Frank de Vol was a composer for TV shows; his best known work was the theme song for The Brady Bunch. Noam Pitlik moved to the director’s chair, most notably for Barney Miller, Taxi, and Wings.\n\nMarty Ingles ended up doing a lot of voice work and leaving acting to be a Hollywood agent, primarily finding ad gigs for his clients. He married Shirley Jones.\n\n______________________________________________\n\n*I was lucky enough to see him onstage at Ford’s Theater (yes, that Ford’s Theater) in a production of Ken Ludwig’s Leading Ladies. It was the final performance of the run, and Astin was wonderful.\n\n(1962)\n\nWritten by Meredith Willson\n\nPerformed by Robert Preston\n\nWikipedia Entry\n\nIn the late 50s and early 60s, the US was in the middle of the Cold War panic, afraid that the Soviets would bury us. And when JFK became president, one of the big concerns was that American youth were not getting enough exercise. To combat this, “Chicken Fat” was created.\n\nThe song was written by Meredith Willson, then riding high with the success of The Music Man. It seems to be his idea to write a song that could be used in gym classes to promote exercising. He wrote the song, and, in the same sessions where they recorded the soundtrack for the movie of The Music Man, they took time to get Robert Preston, star of the show, to record the song.\n\nThe result was a catchy tune that was fun to exercise to and included exercises to be done while the music played.*\n\nI remember our gym teacher playing it, and it was a lot of fun to have a song to do our exercises to. Part of the appeal was that the concept was so unusual: you didn’t do exercises in school to music.\n\nThe song was released as a public service. No one took any money or royalties, and the record company paid for the session and recording and distributed million of copies to gym classes around the country.\n\nIt’s a most a forgotten novelty these days, but there are many people my age who can remember doing sit-ups at Professor Harold Hill cheered you on.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n*The exercises were devised by Bud Wilkerson, who, at the time, was arguable the best regarded college football coach in the US.\n\n(1970)\n\nStarring Robert Klein, Madeline Kahn, Peter Boyle, MacIntrye Dixon, Judy Graubart, Marty Barris. Robert Merrill, Jerry Lacy\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nRowan and Martin’s Laugh-In changed TV comedy, creating a frenetic style filled with oddball (and frankly dumb) jokes. In a year, this was the way to go.* And, at the time, instead of reruns for variety shows, the networks ran summer replacement series. Comedy Tonight was one of the best.\n\nThe show was hosted by Robert Klein and was a series of skits** using a cast of very talented comic actors. The show’s theme, of course, was Stephen Sondheim’s song of the same name and the show would start with the case singing it, then breaking off in the middle for short skits or blackout gags before returning to it.\n\nThe show attempted to be topical. Not in politics, but in various things in society that were open to satire: soap operas, commercials, talk shows, and the like. A subject was chosen, and there would be a series of gags – some quick, some a little more developed – on the theme.\n\nNot much is available about the show, but a couple of things remain vivid to me, even now.\n\nFor a segment on advertising: This was the time when cigarette commercials were going off the air, and Winston was going out with a campaign “What do you want? Good grammar or good taste?”*** Klein replied, “With Madison Avenue, you’re lucky to get either.”\n\nFor a segment on talk shows: Big star (obviously modeled on Judy Garland) is on a talk show. The host asks her to sing “The Trolley Song.” She declines, saying she’s not ready, she hasn’t rehearsed it, she hadn’t expected it, etc. The host finally gets her to give in so she goes to the stage, puts on a tailcoat and hat, and the band starts playing the music, which she sings while doing an elaborate dance routine.\n\nNot much of the show remains; as you can see the IMDB entry is sparse. There were only about a half dozen shows, all in the summer when the audience is low. But Madeline Kahn and Peter Boyle became major names in movies and TV, and Robert Klein is considered one of the deans of standup comedy. Several of the lesser-known names still had long careers, both on stage and in TV.\n\nStill, it was a fine show that seems to have been completely lost. Too bad.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n*Even when it was a mistake. Dean Martin’s Comedy World, a summer replacement series of 1974, had the wonderful idea of showing comedians around the world. They tried to ape Laugh-In with short bits of a joke or two. The problem is that a comedian on stage had a routine that built up in the telling and taking two or three jokes out of context didn’t work at all. The show was the US debut of Monty Python’s Flying Circus, with a couple of very short bits. Oddly, one of the sketches shown used the phrase “naughty bits.” The censors bleeped out the words (maybe the first example of what Jimmy Fallon uses as his “Unnecesary Censorship” videos). Why the show just didn’t pick another Monty Python sketch is inexplicable.\n\n**Similar in some ways to Monty Python, though shorter and less silly.\n\n***For the younger folk, Winston’s slogan for years was “Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.” When it was first used “like” was considered grammatically incorrect (it was supposed to be “as”), but the usage is now unobjectionable. However, that didn’t keep people from the time from kvetching about how bad the error was.\n\n(1941)\n\nDirected by Alexander Hall\n\nWritten by Sidney Buchman & Seton I. Miller, from a stage play by Harry Segall\n\nStarring Robert Montgomery, Evelyn Keyes, Claude Raines, Rita Johnson, James Gleason, John Emery, Edward Everett Horton\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nIt’s always fascinating to see the origins of a well-used movie trope, and especially one that’s been remade many a time. Here Comes Mr. Jordan has been the basis of several films.\n\nIt’s the story of Joe Pendleton (Robert Montgomery), boxer, sax player, and private pilot. When his plane crashes, he dies and finds himself being taken by Messenger 7013 (Edward Everett Horton) to a cloudy place in the sky. The person in charge is Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains), who discovers a mistake has been made: Joe was not scheduled to die for 50 years.\n\nThis is a problem. His body has been cremated, so he can’t go back to that. So Mr. Jordan has to find a new body for Joe. After several tries, he’s given the body of Bruce Farnsworth, a millionaire who has just been murdered by his wife (Rita Johnson) and secretary (John Emery). Joe is reluctant, but he hears Betty Logan (Evelyn Keyes) begging for help. Betty’s father was convicted of a stock scam due to Farnsworth’s machinations, and wants his help. Sympathizing with Betty, Joe takes over Farnsworth’s body and life (to the surprise of his wife and secretary).\n\nThe setup leads to the usual and unusual complications and Joe tries to fix things for Betty* and avoid the murderous plans of the others.\n\nNowadays, the concept is well-worn, but back in 1941, they were new and I think the writers felt the need to make everything clear. Joe seems incredibly slow on the uptake, having to be told things many times before he catches on. But since this all was probably new for the audience, it was necessary to countersink the concept so people understood.\n\nThe movie was a major success in its time, winning a couple of Oscars for writing, and getting several other nominations. It was also the blueprint for Warren Beatty’s Heaven Can Wait.** Several other films also remade the story, and the concept was used in many more.\n\nThe film is a little creaky these days, but still is a lot of fun.\n\n___________________________________________\n\n*Who, of course, he falls in love with.\n\n**The name of the play it was based on.\n\n(1953-1955)\n\nStarring Anne Jeffreys, Robert Sterling, Leo G. Carroll, Lee Patrick, Buck\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nThorne Smith is forgotten today, but he was in some ways the forerunner of Terry Pratchett, Christopher Moore, and anyone writing humorous fantasy, using fantasy ideas in contemporary settings. Topper was his biggest seller, and was soon made into a movie starring Cary Grant. By the time TV came around, it was a prime prospect for a TV series.\n\nGeorge and Marion Kerby (Robert Sterling and Anne Jeffreys*) were a couple of rich bon vivants who were killed skiing in the Alps.** Returning to the US with the alcoholic Saint Bernard, Neil (Buck), they found their old house had been sold to uptight banker Cosmo Topper (Leo G. Carroll), who is the only person who can see or hear them.*** The two play tricks on Topper, harmless pranks that he has to try to explain, and which his wife Henrietta (Lee Patrick) can’t understand.\n\nNeil was a problem all his own, since his favorite drink was a martini, and people would always see a glass on the floor being lapped up by nothing.\n\nThe show ran for two seasons as the Kerbys kept complicating Topper’s life, as he got caught reacting to them and had to explain what was going on. Or making references to them that made no sense to anyone else. The fact that he was a banker – at a time when they were considered the epitome of respectability -- made it even more complicated.\n\nLeo G. Carroll did a great job as the befuddled banker, who tended to be overwhelmed by events. Of course, he managed to come up with a quick explanation of everything, especially when people overheard him talking to George and Marion.\n\nOf special note is one of the writers for the show. Stephen Sondheim wrote eleven episodes. The show was sponsored by Camel Cigarettes, and there was usually a segment where Topper and the Kerby’s hawked the smokes.\n\nCarroll was a UK actor and appeared in several Alfred Hitchcock films, both before and after Topper. He’s best known today as Mr. Waverly from The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Sterling and Jeffreys also continued on TV, with Jeffreys having a long run in General Hospital.\n\nThe special effects were pretty good for the time. Most of them involved objects moving, though there were a few optical effect showing the ghosts in the classic translucent style.\n\nAfter the run, the show continued in syndicate for several years. I remember watching it as a kid (so it couldn’t have been the original run) and loving the fantasy element of it. Even today, I’m a fan of humorous fantasy, and I think Topper was the start of it all.\n\n______________________________________________\n\n*Married to each other in real life.\n\n**The movie version had them dying in a car crash.\n\n***This is probably the origin of that cliché.\n\n(1968)\n\nDirected by Barry Shear\n\nWritten by Robert Thom\n\nStarring Christopher Jones, Shelley Winters, Diane Varsi, Hal Holbrook, Richard Pryor.\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nAmerican International Pictures was the home of the exploitation films of the 50s and 60s – low budget films following particular movie and social trends. In the 50s, it was monsters; in the 60s, they started doing youth-oriented films like the Beach Party movies. And as the youth movement of the 1960s became political, the jumped on that bandwagon with Wild in the Streets.\n\nIt’s the story of Max Frost (Christopher Jones), a rock and roll star who lives the counterculture lifestyle in a Beverly Hills mansion. The group is asked to perform at live televised rally for Senate candidate Johnny Fergus (Hal Holbrook). Holbrook wants to get the youth vote on his side, and campaigned to lower the voting age to 18. Frost upsets the applecart by singing that the voting age be lowered to 14. Of course, the power of your can’t be denied, so states start lowering the voting age. Eventually, the youth take over, and Max become president, where he institutes his “horrifying” agenda.\n\nI was 15 when it was released, and the entire concept seemed silly. The main strength of the film is its soundtrack.* Written by veteran rock and roll songwriters Barry Mann and Cynthia Weill, it was one of the few times a movie used real rock for music to represent rock music.**\n\nThe movie was a big success; given its low budget, it wasn’t difficult for it to make money. It even got one Oscar nomination.\n\nIt certainly isn’t a classic, but, for all its flaws, it’s an energetic bit of alternate history that tells more about the time it was created in than anything else.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n*Usually the sign of a bad movie.\n\n**Too many films of the 50s or 60s used modified big bands to play what they thought was rock music.\n\n(1987)\n\nWritten by M. K. Brown\n\nStarring (voice): Julie Payne\n\nTribute Page\n\nIn 1987, Fox started its foray into network television. It was a bold move: there hadn’t been a fourth broadcast network since Dumont died in 1956. So they had to pick carefully because they couldn’t afford to lose.\n\nOne idea was to give a comedy show to a British comedian, Tracey Ullman. Ullman had some different ideas for the show, most notably to create short animated cartoons for the transition into commercials. They hired two off-beat cartoonists and animated a series of short adventures based on their ideas. Of course, everyone now knows how one of them worked out: The Simpsons. This is about the other one: Dr. N!Godatu.\n\nThe episodes were the creation of M. K. Brown*. Brown was a fixture in the National Lampoon of the 70s, doing “Aunt Mary’s Kitechen” and various one-off strips. She had a very distinct style and sensibility. Her comic strips were more surreal than funny, but they always worked.\n\nIn the cartoon, Dr. Janice N!Godatu** was a cheery doctor who would talk to the audience about her daily life.\n\nThe actual episodes ran a minute or two, cut into even smaller segments. Janice would go about some mundane activity and things seemed to come out of the blue. Julie Payne voiced the character with a plenty of friendly warmth, especially as strange things happened.\n\nI watched the Tracy Ullman Show from the start, and I recognized Brown’s style at once.\n\nThere were a half dozen episodes. By the second season, Dr. N!Godatu was dropped in favor of the Simpsons. It’s not surprising: The bits were just too strange to become a cultural phenomenon. People were were left scratching their heads instead of laughing.\n\nStill, if you liked the weirdness, it was great TV.\n\n___________________________________________\n\n*Married to fellow cartoonist B. Kliban.\n\n**The ! was pronounced as a click. It’s a sound used by some languages in Namibia and South Africa.\n\n(1959-1960)\n\nCreated by Clarence Green, Russell Rouse\n\nStarring Mike Connors\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nIn memory of Mike Connors.\n\nIt’s funny what impresses you about a TV show when you’re a kid. I remembered Tightrope for one reason: the place where the hero kept his gun.\n\nThe premise was that Nick (Mike Connors) was an undercover cop, going on one job after another to try to stop various criminal schemes.* He was in deep undercover, and sometimes the local police didn’t even know his identity. That was the tightrope: he had to walk the line between the law and the criminals. The criminals would kill him if they discovered he was a cop, while the cops often didn’t know he was on their side.\n\nThe series was done in hard boiled style. Nick would narrate the adventure as he infiltrated criminal gangs by showing his toughness and sardonic one liners.\n\nThe half-hour stories had Nick getting in close with the criminal gang, and then managing to stop their efforts. He was smart and tough. Much of the tension was the cat and mouse game Nick was forced to play to stop the criminals without being discovered.\n\nThis was Connor’s first starring role. He had come up in films in the fifties** and was doing various guest stints up until this time.\n\nThe show ran for a year and was cancelled despite good ratings. It came along in the last years of advertisers sponsoring a show. CBS wanted to move it; one of the advertisers balked and the show was cancelled.\n\nOh, and the gun? Nick kept it in a special holster on the back of his belt. When he was frisked, people would find a shoulder holster (or nothing) and figure that was it. Nick would then draw his gun when needed. That was very impressive to a ten-year-old me.\n\nConnors continued doing the guest star route until cast as the lead in the 60s series Mannix,*** where he became a TV icon.****\n\n______________________________________________\n\n*The type of things that are considered small time today – jewelry robberies, racetrack heists, and so fort.\n\n**Starting out billed as “Touch Connors.” He had the same agent as Rock Hudson and Tab Hunter. Conners was born Krekor Ohanan, and picked up “Touch” as a nickname in college. By the time he made Tightrope, he had ditched “Touch” and was billed as “Michael Connors.”\n\n***Now billed as the familiar “Mike Connors.”\n\n****People don’t remember how the show changed between the first and second season. The first year, he was part of a big, high-tech (for the time) detective firm, but that was all dropped the second year when the show was revamped and he became a classic private eye.\n\n(2006)\n\nDirected by Dick Clement, Sam Fell\n\nWritten by Sam Fell and Peter Lord & Dick Clement & Ian La Frenais (story) Dick Clement & Ian La Frenais (screenplay) & Chris Lloyd & Joe Keenan & Will Davies\n\nStarring (voice): Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellan, Jean Reno, Billy Nighy, Andy Serkis, Shane Richie.\n\nIMDB Entry\n\nI have written before of my admiration for Aardman Animations. And Flushed Away is their least impressive film. But that all relative: Aardman sets its bar so high that Flushed Away is still better than 90% of the animated films out there.\n\nIt’s the story of Roddy St. James (Hugh Jackman), a pet rat who lives in luxury in a fancy apartment*. When the family goes away, he enjoys his freedom until Sid (Shank Richie), a sewer rat, joins them. Roddy tries to trick Sid into the toilet in order to get rid of him, telling Sid it’s a Jacuzzi. But Sid knows a toilet when he sees it, and Roddy finds himself flushed into the sewers, where rats and other creatures have an entire city. In order to try to regain his place, he joins up with Rita Malone (Kate Winslet), who has a boat and is being chased by the Toad (Ian McKellan), who has sinister plans in mind for the rats living in the there.\n\nThe broke new ground for the company. They had always done stop motion animation for their films, but the problem of using water required them to switch to CGI.**\n\nThe film had generally good reviews, but not the usual glowing ones you Aaraman usually gets.*** The movie made a profit, but the numbers were lower than for Aardman’s previous two films. Dreamworks Animation, which distributed, was doing far better with Shrek and other films.**** At the same time, Aardman didn’t like the corporate interference. The two companies agreed to part ways. Aardnan went to Columbia/Sony for its next two films, the classics Arthur Christmas and The Pirates! Band of Misfits.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n*Being a cartoon rat, Roddy has a closet full of clothes, one of which is a direct match for the suit worn by Wallace from Aarman’s Wallace and Gromit.\n\n**It’s difficult to get water looking good in stop motion, plus the clay figures of the characters would get quickly ruined.\n\n***Its Rotten Tomatoes score is 72% – good, but Aardman scores are usually in the 90s.\n\n****Flushed Away had Dreamworks’s third-lowest box office numbers – it made money, but not hatfuls of it -- and other Aardman films did not come close to the box office of even minor Dreamworks films like the awful Bee Movie."
