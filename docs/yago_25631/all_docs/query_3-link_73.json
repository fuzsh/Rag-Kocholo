Set against the backdrop of contemporary Marrakech, Raja is a cross-cultural drama about a wealthy middle-aged Frenchman's complex relationship with this poor local girl. Fred's attempts to seduce Raja, and their mutual attempts at manipulation, are fractured by their gross disparity of income, age and cultural sophistication.",

Such a pairing immediately conjures up thoughts of unresolved psychological issues and potential exploitation since chances of successfully pairing such unlikely lovers seems so remote—stretching the cliché about \"opposites attracting\" to the utmost limit. Those issues are explored memorably in Jacques Doillon's brilliantly scripted and remarkably well acted Raja that revolves around 19 year old Moroccan orphan girl Raja (Najat Benssallem) and middle-aged Fred (Pascal Greggory), an idle class Frenchman who lives in a well tended private villa in Marrakech.\n\nForced by poverty into occasional prostitution, Raja splits her time with equally destitute boyfriend Youssef (Hassan Khissal) and her best…"
