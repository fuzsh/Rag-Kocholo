        "text": "When Jane Birkin arrived in Paris, the British actress didn't speak the language. It led her to calling her A-lister co-star the name of a French stew.\n\nIt was 1968 and the 20-year-old's name was on the rise. She was to star opposite iconic French actor and singer songwriter, Serge Gainsbourg.\n\nYet for Birkin it meant living in a foreign place, while nursing both a broken heart and a young child. It changed her life.\n\nBirkin and Gainsbourg – one of France's most culturally influential and stylish pairings of the '60s and '70s – did not hit if off at first glance.\n\nREAD MORE: How Paris became the fashion capital of the world\n\nIn the UK, Birkin was known for her breakthrough performance in the 1966 film Blow-Up, while Gainsbourg, 18 years her senior, was an icon in France.\n\nDuring her early days working together, Birkin cajoled her older brother, Andrew, a scriptwriter and director, to travel and stay with her. His main responsibilities were to keep her company and cheer her up from her \"daily encounters with a 'horrible man'\".\n\n\"He and I became the most famous of couples\"\n\nThe said the 'horrible man' was, of course, Gainsbourg. He mocked and teased Birkin before the pair fell into a romantic entanglement that lasted 13 years.\n\nAs a couple they oozed style. While Birkin opted for casual chic of shrunken t-shirts, cut off jeans, babydoll dresses or Breton jumpers, Gainsbourg chose more gothic leanings.\n\nThe infamous duet\n\nWhen they first met, Birkin didn't know any of Gainsbourg's songs.\n\n\"I even thought his name was Serge 'Bourguignon', the only French dish whose name I could remember,\" Birkin said in a 2013 interview.\n\nOffended by the linguistic slip, Gainsbourg offered her a little red-covered book Chansons Cruelles with the dedication starting \"To Jane, a few cruel songs including Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus. Serge Gainsbourg.\"\n\nFrench style icons who've captivated us through the years\n\nBy 1969, the song Gainsbourg had originally written for his former lover, model and actress Bridget Bardot, was released as a duet with Birkin. It made history.\n\nIt was the first foreign-language track to reached No 1 on the UK charts and it was also banned in a number of countries over its sexual content.\n\n\"It was surprising to be banned by both the Vatican and the BBC, and it was funny to have the BBC orchestra playing it because they wouldn't play it on Top of the Pops,\" she said in 2018.\n\nREAD MORE: Cathy Freeman had 'reservations' about her iconic speedsuit\n\nThe song's success further cemented the duo's life together to the point where Gainsbourg was seldom photographed without his \"muse\", Birkin.\n\n\"He and I became the most famous of couples in that strange way because of Je t'aime and … he went on being my friend until the day he died. Who could ask for more?\" Birkin told CNN in 2006.\n\n\"So Paris became my home. I've been adopted here. They like my accent.\"\n\nThe actress downplayed this, surmising in 2013, that Gainsbourg simply wanted to introduce her to \"the French\". She was the epitome of London \"Cool\", yet, in France she became known as \"the little English girl\".\n\n\"Right from our first collaboration, he put me in the spotlight,\" she told French newspaper, Le Monde.\n\n\"On the cover of the album Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus, he preferred to show my face... with my big teeth\n\n\"It was a very conscious decision. He wanted me to be associated with this success.\"\n\n'The perfect muse'\n\nBirkin once described the timing of her and Gainsbourg's meeting as \"perfect\".\n\n\"I was 20 years younger than him. I amused him: He could play dolls with me, dress me up according to his fantasies,\" she told Le Monde.\n\nTogether, Birkin and Gainsbourg raised Birkin's eldest daughter, Kate, from Birkin's first marriage to British composer, John Barry.\n\nBirkin met Barry when she was just 17.\n\n\"He was amazing in my eyes. My father wouldn't have tolerated me running off to live with a man [so] he gave in and said yes, I could marry him,\" she said in a 2017 interview.\n\n\"He did tell me it would be a complete disaster – and it was. We were together for a few years and had one child, Kate. I went to live with my parents after it ended.\"\n\nKate went on to become a fashion photographer.\n\n\"At first, I was better known because of my family: my mother, my stepfather, my father, my sisters … now I hope I'm known a bit more for my own work,\" Barry said.\n\nTragically, she died after falling from the window of her fourth-floor apartment in 2013. She was 46.\n\nBirkin was left overwhelmed with grief at her eldest daughter's sudden passing.\n\n\"You feel as if someone has pulled the carpet from under your feet,\" she told CBS.\n\n\"You didn't see it coming. I saw it coming on many other occasions and I'd been able to be there and I don't know… this time not. So, it took my confidence away, completely.\"\n\nBirkin and Gainsbourg also shared a daughter, Charlotte.\n\nCharlotte, like her parents has carved out a name for herself as both an actor and singer.\n\nREAD MORE: Every time Gigi Hadid has proven she is a style icon\n\nDuring a 2019 interview, the Melancholia actress recounted how at age 16 there was a plot to kidnap her and demand five million francs from her famous parents.\n\n\"I remember my parents being extremely scared and my father made me go to school with a bodyguard... I was so ashamed,\" she told The Guardian\n\nHow Jane Birkin inspired the world's priciest handbag\n\nThe birth of the Birkin bag\n\nBirkin and Gainsbourg remained a couple until 1980 when his drinking became too much.\n\n\"You are on your way down, I am on my way up,\" Birkin quoted him in her memoir, Post-scriptum, as telling her after their split.\n\nA year later, a chance encounter on a flight etched Birkin 's name in fashion history with the birth of The Birkin bag.\n\nStruggling to get her basket bag into the overhead compartment, Birkin complained that she couldn't find a weekend bag that was both chic and practical.\n\n\"I was on a plane sitting next to Hermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas on a flight from Paris to London [in 1981],\" she told The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n\"I was travelling with a bag that wasn't ideal because everything fell from it.\n\n\"He ended up suggesting they design a bag for me. I thought it was such a good idea and said it was okay if they used my name.\n\n\"I had nothing to do with the design apart from the fact that my name is on it.\n\n\"So yes, a guy sits next to a girl on a plane and the rest is fashion history.\"\n\nREAD MORE: A look back at Lara Worthington's most iconic looks\n\nThree years after that fateful plane journey, the Birkin bag was created and named in her honour.\n\nThen more than 30 years later, the fairytale pairing between Birkin and her namesake bag came to an end.\n\n\"Having been alerted to the cruel practices endured by crocodiles during their slaughter for the production of Hermès bags carrying my name, I have asked Hermès Group to rename the Birkin until better practices responding to international norms can be implemented for the production of this bag,\" she said in a July 2015 statement.\n\nA few months later, in September 2015, Birkin dropped her request for a name change after being satisfied by how Hermès treats its crocodiles.\n\nIn 1981, Birkin took up with French director, Jacques Doillon, after meeting on the set of Doillon's film The Parodical Daughter.\n\nBirkin and Doillon moved in together. During their 13-year relationship they welcomed a daughter, Lou.\n\nLou is now a singer, actress and model.\n\n\"When I meet people in France, I can see in their eyes, they have a very clear idea who I am. Which is funny, because I really have no idea myself,\" she told The UK Telegraph in 2019.\n\n\"There is something terrifying in the ideas people form because they have seen you in a gossip magazine.\"\n\nFor Lou, her home life growing up was focused more on fun than on fame.\n\n\"My mum was curious about absolutely everything. I never saw isolated, bored, multi-millionaire stardom,\" she said.\n\n\"Everyone was constantly making stuff, collaborating with wonderful people.\"\n\nDespite not being together, Birkin continued to perform Gainsbourg's songs.\n\nIn 1991, Gainsbourg died from a heart attack. He was 62.\n\n\"Serge is one of the greatest artists that ever lived in France,\" Birkin said.\n\n\"To know that he wrote about me until his dying day is more than touching. That's why I keep singing his songs and touring his music.\"\n\nAs well as being celebrated in France for her artistic pursuits, she was also praised for her political activism.\n\nShe joined other screen and music stars in France in 2022 by chopping off locks of their hair in support of protesters in Iran.\n\nIn July 2023, Birkin passed away in her Paris home. She was 76.\n\nThe French Culture Ministry hailed her as a \"timeless Francophone icon\".\n\nFrench newspaper Le Figaro reported Birkin had suffered from health issues in the past few years that kept her from performing and her public appearances became sparse."
