        "text": "“Charlotte?”\n\n“Oui,” Charlotte Gainsbourg answered her mother, Jane Birkin, with a giggle.\n\nIt was a little like they were using the telephone for the first time. They last spoke, if you’re curious, about a week ago.\n\n“But we text a lot,” Ms. Gainsbourg said.\n\n“We do,” Ms. Birkin agreed. “But I must get into Skype. Does it work on a mobile?”\n\n“Oh yeah it does,” Ms. Gainsbourg said. “It’s just you’re always ugly, but it does work.”\n\n“Well, if I’m ugly, it’s normal,” Ms. Birkin said.\n\nThey both howled with laughter. But there is something to the notion that as poised as they are, this mother and daughter — celebrated for their acting, their singing, their innate style — aren’t afraid of being ugly when it comes to their art. “I hate films when I have to pretend to be pretty,” Ms. Gainsbourg said. “It’s the thing that makes me lose confidence. The pretend is too much. So each time I have dark circles, that’s what I enjoy the most.”\n\nMs. Birkin, who first came on the scene with a nude cameo in Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 film “Blow-Up,” seemed admiring. “I’ve realized this about you, and I wish I had realized it about myself earlier on,” she said. “When the whole point, when the only point, is that you’re pretty, then it’s horrifying. I’ve done a few with just being really pretty, and it’s very, very stressful. It would be much nicer to have not given a hoot, and I don’t give a hoot anymore now, but it’s a bit late.”\n\nMs. Birkin, 69, who is British-born but made her career in France, was speaking from Paris in the phone interview, while Ms. Gainsbourg, 44, was in New York. As actresses, they share a fearlessness that takes them to extremes. Beginning Friday, Jan. 29, the Film Society of Lincoln Center will underscore that quality in presenting “Jane and Charlotte Forever,” a series of 19 films spanning five decades that also highlights the work of daring directors like Jacques Rivette, Agnès Varda, Jacques Doillon and Lars von Trier.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
