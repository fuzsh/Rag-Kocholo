        "text": "With a selection of over 100+ films, this year’s International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) featured a large variety of works, across its different sections: whether it be retrospectives of filmmakers you may have never heard of (Cinema Regained section), the young exciting voices of up-and-coming filmmakers (Bright Future section), or the competition sections (Tiger and Ammodo Short Tiger Competition). Another section is called Big Screen Competition, a diverse competition bridging the gap between popular, classic and art house cinema, in which we spotted CE2 (Third Grade).\n\nJacques Doillon, a major blind spot in my movie watching experience (Rodin which put me off on his filmography), presented his new film CE2 (Third Grade), where I was pleasantly surprised by his direction of children directing, which had me investigate and excited to venture of his past films such as Ponnette and The Little Gangster. I believe this is what film festivals and venturing into unexpected films are for, to find new discoveries that unlock a new discovery for oneself. In Third Grade, we are looking into the life of Claire and her experience as the victim of bullying by classmate, Kevin. The film explores the many dynamics and causes of bullying and sympathy, in which using the two child actors in two relentless performances."
