        "text": "PARIS: French authorities Monday detained leading arthouse film directors Benoit Jacquot and Jacques Doillon for questioning over accusations of sexual abuse, as a renewed #MeToo reckoning rocks France’s film industry.\n\nTheir interrogation over the alleged abuse, some dating back to the 1980s and all of which they deny, comes as activists say cinema has too long provided cover for abuse.\n\nAn AFP journalist saw Jacquot, 77, and Doillon, 80, arrive at a Paris police station on Monday morning accompanied by their lawyers.\n\nJudith Godreche, a 52-year-old actor and director, earlier this year formally accused Jacquot of rape and Doillon of sexual assault when she was a minor, accusations both men deny.\n\nShe has described Jacquot as having had an unhealthy “hold” over her during a relationship with him that started when she was 14, from 1986 to 1992.\n\nAnd she has accused Doillon of groping her during an unplanned sex scene in one of his films when she was 15.\n\nSeveral other actors have also filed complaints against both men.\n\nIsild Le Besco, 41, has accused Jacquot of raping her between 1998 and 2007 during a toxic relationship that started when she was 16 and he was 52.\n\nJulia Roy, a 34-year-old actor who has appeared in several of his films, has accused him of sexual assault in “a context of violence and moral constraint which lasted several years,” a source close to the case said.\n\nLe Besco has also charged Doillon made advances during work sessions, while actor Anna Mouglalis alleged the filmmaker forcefully kissed her in 2011.\n\nThe directors’ lawyers said there had been no need to detain them in order to question them, and stressed they should be considered innocent until proven guilty.\n\nJacquot’s lawyer, Julia Minkowski, said her client would “finally be able to express himself before the law,” slamming what she called the “unacceptable excesses” of media coverage on the issue.\n\nDoillon’s attorney, Marie Dose, said no legal criteria could justify his being detained for questioning “36 years” after the incident alleged by Godreche, adding he could have answered queries without being held in custody.\n\nSources close to the case said their interrogation could include a confrontation with those accusing them.\n\nGodreche on Instagram said she was deeply moved.\n\n“I’m crying,” she wrote.\n\n“I don’t know if I have the strength, but I will have it. I will have it... For her,” she wrote, posting a picture of her teenage self next to Jacquot, 25 years her senior.\n\nHer lawyer, Laure Heinich, did not wish to comment.\n\nSince breaking her silence, Godreche has become a leading voice in France’s #MeToo movement.\n\nAfter she appealed for a cinema oversight body, parliament in May voted to create a commission to investigate sexual and gender-based violence in the film industry and other cultural sectors.\n\nThe head of France’s top cinema institution, Dominique Boutonnat, stepped down on Friday after he was convicted of sexually assaulting his godson in 2020.\n\nAnd cinema legend Gerard Depardieu, 75, is to stand trial in October for sexually assaulting two women.\n\nHe also risks a second trial after he was charged in 2020 with rape after actor Charlotte Arnould alleged he raped her in 2018 when she was 22 and anorexic.\n\nHe denies all claims.\n\nKOLKATA: Junior doctors in many Indian hospitals remained off the job on Sunday demanding swift justice for a colleague who was raped and murdered, despite the end of a 24-hour strike called by the country’s biggest association of doctors.\n\nDoctors across the country have held protests, candlelight marches and have refused to see non-emergency patients in the past week after the killing of the 31-year old postgraduate student of chest medicine around the early hours of Aug. 9 in the eastern city of Kolkata.\n\nWomen activists say the incident at the British-era R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital has highlighted how women in India continue to suffer despite tougher laws following the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012.\n\n“My daughter is gone but millions of sons and daughters are now with me,” the father of the victim, who cannot be identified under Indian law, told reporters late on Saturday, referring to the protesting doctors. “This has given me a lot of strength and I feel we will gain something out of it.”\n\nIndia introduced sweeping changes to the criminal justice system, including tougher sentences, after the 2012 attack, but campaigners say little has changed and not enough has been done to deter violence against women.\n\nThe Indian Medical Association, whose strike ended at 6 a.m. (0030 GMT) on Sunday, told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that as 60 percent of India’s doctors are women, he needed to intervene to ensure hospital staff were protected by security protocols akin to those at airports.\n\n“All health care professionals deserve peaceful ambience, safety and security at workplace,” it wrote in a letter to Modi.\n\n’COULD STOP EMERGENCY SERVICES’\n\nThe government has urged doctors to return to duty to treat rising cases of dengue and malaria while it sets up a committee to suggest measures to improve protection for health care professionals.\n\nMost doctors resumed their usual activities, IMA officials said, although Sunday is generally a holiday for non-emergency cases.\n\n“The doctors are back to their routine,” said Dr. Madan Mohan Paliwal, the IMA head in the most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. “The next course of action will be decided if the government does not take any strict steps to protect doctors... and this time we could stop emergency services too.”\n\nBut the All India Residents and Junior Doctors’ Joint Action Forum said on Saturday it would continue a “nationwide cease-work” with a 72-hour deadline for authorities to conduct a thorough inquiry and make arrests.\n\nDr. Prabhas Ranjan Tripathy, additional medical superintendent of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in the eastern city of Bhubaneswar, said junior doctors and interns had not resumed duty.\n\n“The demonstrations are there today too,” he told Reuters. “There is a lot of pressure on others because manpower is reduced.”\n\nR.G. Kar hospital has been rocked by agitation and rallies for more than a week. Police banned the assembly of five or more people to protest around the hospital for a week from Sunday and deployed police in riot gear.\n\nBlocking meetings, demonstrations and processions was justified to prevent “breach of peace, disturbances of the public tranquillity,” Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal said in an order.\n\nReuters reporters saw no doctors in their usual protest site around the gates of the hospital on Sunday, as it rained in the area.\n\nPHOENIX: When Denisha Mitchell was asked why she filled out paperwork to serve as an Arizona elector for the independent presidential candidate Cornel West, her first response was “What?!” Her second: What’s an elector?\n\n“I was shocked and surprised by it all. I didn’t even know what an elector was,” Mitchell told The Associated Press on Friday. “The crazy thing is it was all forged. None of it was my handwriting. It was definitely not my signature. My email was wrong, my address was wrong.”\n\nMitchell’s case is the latest example of dubious tactics used in an effort to qualify West, a left-wing academic, for the ballot in states across the US. It’s also among the more egregious. It’s an effort that West himself apparently knows nothing about. His campaign did not immediately respond for comment Friday evening.\n\n“If you produce information that is a false on filing to a government entity in Arizona, you’ve committed a felony. It’s just not that complicated,” said Dennis K. Burke, a former US Attorney in Arizona, who also served as a chief deputy in the state attorney general’s office.\n\nBut as the presidential election enters a critical three-month period, there are efforts around the country to subvert the integrity of the ballot, many of them coming from a collection of conservative activists and Republican-aligned operatives pushing West’s candidacy.\n\nRepublicans and their allies have worked to get West on the ballot in Arizona, Wisconsin, Virginia, North Carolina, Nebraska, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Maine.\n\nTheir hope is West will serve as a spoiler candidate, boosting former President Donald Trump’s chance of winning in November by siphoning liberal support away from the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, in battleground states that could be decided by just a few thousand votes.\n\nWhile it is not clear who is behind the effort — and there is no indication that Trump’s campaign is directly involved — one thing is certain: It’s not West, who has not been actively campaigning and whose presidential committee, records show, was almost $17,000 in debt at the end of June.\n\nSince discovering she was signed up to be an elector, Mitchell has signed an affidavit that will be submitted to state authorities next week attesting that she never agreed to serve as an elector and never signed her name to a filing. In Arizona, all independent presidential campaigns are required to submit filings showing that they have a slate of electors who will cast their Electoral College votes for a presidential candidate.\n\nBut her story is not the only unusual one among the slate of electors for West.\n\nOne of them, Elizabeth Rothgeb, pleaded guilty to manslaughter after accepting a plea deal stemming from the killing of her then-husband with an ax in 1998. She spent 10 years in prison and was released on Christmas Eve 2010, according to online records from the state prison system.\n\nRothgeb, who could not be reached for comment, is a registered Republican, as are two other electors for West, voting records show. Two additional electors listed in the state filings are not registered to vote at the addresses provided for them, records show.\n\nAs for Mitchell, she’s says she is unsure who filled out the paperwork in her name.\n\nShe and her husband were both enthusiastic supporters of Bernie Sanders and were drawn to West’s progressive message earlier this year. They later took jobs gathering petition signatures to get an initiative on the ballot that would raise the wages of tipped workers. They soured on West’s candidacy when they read that Republican-aligned operatives were working to get him on the ballot to play spoiler.\n\n“We weren’t for the Republican griminess, so we stopped pushing him,” she said.\n\nHer former employer, a signature gathering contractor called Wells Marketing, a mysterious Missouri limited liability company, is leading the effort to get West on the ballot in Arizona. The company did not respond to a message seeking comment at a phone number listed for it.\n\n“I don’t know who did it. But because I worked for Wells (Marketing), they do have my information,” said Mitchell.\n\nThe company is closely affiliated with Mark Jacoby — a brother-in-law of a Wells Marketing official, according to social media posts — who was also listed on state documents as the employer of one signature gatherer working to get West on the ballot in the state.\n\nJacoby is a Republican-aligned operative from California with a longstanding reputation for using deceptive tactics. He was convicted in 2009 of voter registration fraud, court records show.\n\nIn 2020, Jacoby worked to gather signatures to place the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, on the ballot. Ye’s quixotic presidential campaign was widely viewed by Democrats as an effort to dilute Joe Biden’s popularity with Black voters.\n\nJacoby’s firm, Let the Voters Decide, was investigated for using questionable signature gathering tactics during a 2020 petition drive in Michigan that sought to roll back some of Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s emergency powers during the coronavirus pandemic. No charges came of the investigation.\n\nHe was accused in 2008 of tricking voters into registering with the California Republican Party by telling them they were signing an initiative to strengthen penalties for child molesters, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nJacoby did not answer a call at a number listed to him and his voicemail inbox was full.\n\nSimilarly unusual efforts have unfolded in other states, as well.\n\nIn April, The Washington Post reported pro-Trump activist Scott Presler was gathering signatures for West outside a Trump rally in North Carolina. In a video posted online, Presler described West, an academic, as a “far-left Marxist” who “if we get him on the ballot he could take a percentage point away” from Biden.\n\nBut Republican involvement in getting West and his Justice For All party on the ballot in North Carolina ran far deeper.\n\nAt the beginning of June, disclosures show, West had spent just $2,400 this year to gather the signatures needed to qualify for the ballot in states across the US.\n\nBut then Justice For All submitted well over the roughly 13,800 signatures needed. State government emails obtained by The Associated Press show current and former employees of Blitz Canvassing, a Republican firm that earned millions of dollars doing work for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, helped West pull off the feat. The emails, previously reported by NBC News, show the employees affiliated with Blitz Canvassing were the designated representatives to pick up and drop off petitions for West’s campaign.\n\nBallot access hijinks are nothing new in Arizona, where elections are often decided by fractions of a percentage point.\n\nThis year, a leader of the conservative group Turning Point Action resigned from the organization and dropped his bid for reelection to the Arizona House of Representatives after he was accused of forging signatures on his nominating petitions.\n\nWASHINGTON: Is America ready to elect a Black woman as its president? Vice President Kamala Harris, who will be officially confirmed as the Democratic US presidential nominee in Chicago next week, is betting that it is.\n\n“In my entire career, I’ve heard people say when I ran... people aren’t ready, it’s not your time, nobody like you has done that before,” the Democrat said in 2019 when she ran against Joe Biden in the primary presidential campaign.\n\n“I haven’t listened and I would suggest that nobody should listen to that kind of conversation.”\n\nBut Harris’s campaign never took off and she left the primaries race before Biden picked her as his running mate.\n\nIf Harris, 59, manages to beat Donald Trump in November, she will become the first woman and the second Black person, after Barack Obama, to run the world’s leading power.\n\nIn so many ways, Harris already is a trailblazer. Born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, she was the first woman attorney general ever elected in California, on top of being the first African American and Asian American to hold that post. She then became the first vice president in US history in those same categories.\n\nIn a survey published in September 2023, the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank, found that for a majority of Americans, gender does not play a role in choosing a president.\n\nSixty percent of respondents said that a female president would handle pressure as well as a man, while 27 percent believed that she would do better.\n\n“While female leadership — whether as presidents, queens, prime ministers, and heads of state — has become the norm in many parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, South America, and African nations, the United States has yet to experience this moment,” said Sonia Gipson Rankin, a law professor at the University of New Mexico.\n\nShe noted that even though Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the electoral college and therefore the presidency to Trump in 2016, she won the popular vote.\n\nRegina Bateson, a professor of political science at the University of Colorado Boulder, believes that voters’ biases may not themselves be the issue.\n\n“The problem is often not that voters are actually biased,” Bateson said. “It’s that party insiders and delegates and political donors worry that the voters will be biased.”\n\nThat leads them to withhold support from a woman of color, a phenomenon that Bateson calls “strategic discrimination,” which usually manifests itself during the primaries when a candidate must demonstrate that he or she is able to rally many groups of voters.\n\nHarris, however, took over from Biden after the 81-year-old leader withdrew from the race, thus sparing her “this process of trying to convince people that she’s electable” during the primaries.\n\nFlanked by her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a 60-year-old white man, Harris now hopes to win the trust of all Americans, regardless of ethnicity or gender.\n\nSome are already convinced such as “White dudes for Harris,” a group that brought nearly 200,000 people together for a Zoom fundraiser for Harris in late July, raising more than $4 million.\n\nDonald Trump didn’t wait long to attack his Democratic rival on her background.\n\nThe billionaire charged that Harris “turned Black” only recently in order to win electoral support.\n\nHarris, who had always spoken of her Black and Asian heritage with pride, called out Trump for his “divisiveness and disrespect.”\n\nThe former president’s running mate, J.D. Vance, caused an outcry recently when a 2021 video resurfaced in which he dismisses the Democratic Party as being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives... and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.”\n\nHarris is married to Douglas Emhoff and helped in raising his two children from a previous marriage. She does not have any biological children of her own.\n\nVance’s comments caused a backlash amplified by Hollywood stars such as Jennifer Aniston and Glenn Close, and were widely considered a political misstep in a country where the fertility rate is historically low.\n\nVance has sought to walk back his remarks saying they were taken out of context."
