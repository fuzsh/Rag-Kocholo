Three significant films punctuate Maruschka Detmers's career. Based in Paris, the Dutch actress was discovered during an audition at Cours Florent, which led to her acting in Jean-Luc Godard's film First Name: Carmen (1983) at age 21. The film, which was presented in Cannes, was a scandal, both because of the provocative deconstruction of the story and also because of certain nude scenes where the young woman made use of her sensuality and her spontaneity.

In an almost similar vein, Italy's Marco Bellocchio called on her for Devil in the Flesh (1987), an audacious and demonic adaptation of Radiguet's novel, where one very explicit scene overshadowed her acting performance. Prior to this, in 1984, Jacques Doillon's La Pirate was a film with great emotional intensity which proved her ability to take on very dramatic roles.
