        "text": "US firm Clark Hill is further expanding in Ireland through a merger with Dublin-based HBMO Solicitors, its third such combination since 2019.\n\nThe deal adds 10 new solicitors to Clark Hill’s Dublin ranks, which now numbers 31 in total. HBMO – which was formerly known as Noel Smyth and Partners – specialises in commercial property, litigation, corporate, M&A, banking and private client services.\n\nKirby Tarrant, member in charge of Clark Hill’s Dublin office, said: “This combination enhances our ability to deliver exceptional legal services in Ireland and beyond. It is an important step in our expansion plans and presents new opportunities for young solicitors to advance their careers within a growing international law firm.”\n\nThe incoming HBMO team includes its managing partner Colman Bermingham and partners Hugh O’Neill and Ronan Hannigan. Bermingham and O’Neill are both noted for their commercial property expertise, having advised on major property deals in the country, including shopping centres and office developments. Hannigan, meantime, is an experienced commercial litigator and corporate M&A advisor.\n\nHannigan said: “Being part of an international law firm in an increasingly amalgamated global economy has incredible benefit to our client. Access to transatlantic legal resources will add significant value to the support we provide.”\n\nDetroit-headquartered Clark Hill has been growing its footprint in Ireland since opening its Dublin office in 2018 as part of a broader goal to support US clients on European matters and vice-versa. Last year it combined with four-lawyer Irish boutique Eames Solicitors, having also merged with O’Gradys Solicitors in 2019.\n\nJohn Hensien, CEO of Clark Hill, said: “Expanding the Clark Hill presence in Ireland continues to be one of our strategic goals. Ireland’s significance as a strategic location for international business, and its position in terms of two-way transatlantic economic investment, continues to reinforce the importance of our Irish presence, and our ability to provide seamless, full-service legal support on both sides of the Atlantic.”\n\nHe added: “This presence within the EU is an important and differentiating element of our offering.”\n\nElsewhere in Ireland, Fieldfisher this month added former Meta lawyer Ciara Burke as a partner in its Dublin data protection and privacy team."
