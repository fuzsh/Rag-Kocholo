        "text": "Grattan Bridge is a road bridge across the River Liffey in Dublin, joining Capel Street to Parliament Street and the south quays. The bridge was built in 1676, rebuilt in 1753 and 1872.\n\nThe River Liffey flows through the centre of Dublin. Its major tributaries include the River Dodder, the River Poddle and the River Camac. The river supplies much of Dublin's water and a range of recreational activities. It rises in The Wicklow Mountains and flows 125km."
