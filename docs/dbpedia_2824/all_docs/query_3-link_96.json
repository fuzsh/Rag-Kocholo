        "text": "A new state-of-the-art intensive care unit (ICU) that will provide first-class critical care to patients from The Royal Melbourne Hospital, The Royal Women’s Hospital and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre opened its doors today.\n\nMinister for Health Jill Hennessy today officially opened the new $33 million, 42 bed ICU based at The Royal Melbourne Hospital that has been delivered as part of the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre (VCCC) Project.\n\nThe ICU has already started treating patients from The Royal Melbourne and The Women’s, and will increase services when Peter Mac moves to its new home at the VCCC in late June.\n\nIt features four separate pods, enabling each pod to operate as a mini ICU. It includes 22 beds that can be converted into negative pressure units, meaning it is equipped to deal with a pandemic, while the remaining 20 beds could function as an ICU for other patients.\n\nFor patients this means single rooms complete with switchable glass privacy, a quiet facility with plenty of natural light and state-of-the-art equipment and technology on hand to ensure they receive the very best of care.\n\nFamilies with loved ones in intensive care can often find the experience overwhelming and having to spend long periods of time at hospitals can be draining, so improved family areas with kitchenette and waiting areas are a welcome change.\n\nThe design of the facility gives staff a clear line of sight from staff base to patient rooms and break-out areas to relax and rejuvenate in between and during shifts.\n\nModern education facilities have also been added for ongoing education and professional development of doctors and nurses, and overhead lifting installed to reduce safety risks for staff in all rooms.\n\nThe VCCC Project is delivering a $1 billion purpose-built facility for cancer research, treatment, care and education in Parkville, with a covered in bridge above Grattan Street linking the ICU to the VCCC, allowing patients, visitors and staff to move between the two buildings.\n\nThese wonderful new facilities will enable clinicians to continue to do their important work while working side-by side with hundreds of researchers here in Parkville’s biomedical precinct.\n\nQuotes attributable to Minister for Health Jill Hennessy\n\n“The ICU has been designed with patients and their families at its centre. It offers the comfort and privacy families need and deserve during what can be an emotional and distressing time.”\n\n“Our investment in a cutting edge intensive care unit like this is priceless because it will save lives.”\n\n“The VCCC will bring together the world’s best and brightest researchers, clinicians and scientists to work side by side to deliver the next breakthrough in the fight against cancer.”"
