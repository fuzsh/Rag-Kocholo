It links Capel Street on the northside of the Liffey River to Parliament Street on the southside. In the far background is the dome of City Hall and on the right middle distance is the Italian style Sunlight Chambers Building with its glazed ceramic friezes depicting various stages of hygiene activity, commissioned by Lever Brothers who made the famous 'Sunlight' soap."
