        "text": "Peter Burgess Lodge Complex\n\nPlans are available on the Download Page\n\nOpened new in 1989, the lodge complex is pleasant and modern. The four lodges and dining hall are set in open ground, facing westwards to the entrance of the valley. Units 3 and 4 are adjacent to the dining hall, with a sheltered area for open-air dining. Units 2 and 3 are slightly separate from each other and the other buildings. Each unit and the hall has a covered verandah.\n\nEach of the buildings may be hired separately or in combinations. In total there is sleeping space for 72.\n\nPhotos\n\nThe Dining Hall includes a large kitchen with stoves, cooking pots, pans, crockery and cutlery. There is a fridge and a walk-in 5m3 cool store. Tables and seating are provided. The hall seats 75 comfortably. There is also a gas barbeque.\n\nInside Photos\n\nCatering: The lodge complex is a 'self-catering' facility and all groups will need to provide for their own meals.\n\nUnits 1 and 2 each have their own lounge area, and a kitchen with stove, fridge, pans, crockery and cutlery. They sleep 18 in four bunk rooms.\n\nPhotos\n\nUnits 3 and 4 each sleep 18 in four bunk rooms. They include a room for drying wet clothes.\n\nMattresses and pillows are provided in all the units. Campers provide their own covers and pillow-cases.\n\nAll units include toilets and showers with hot water.\n\nDrinking water is supplied to the camp from the Wainui town supply.\n\nThere is a spacious car-park to the rear of the complex.\n\nScroll down for information on other facilities at Camp Wainui\n\nOld Dorm Block\n\nOnce used as a domitory block mainly for officers and NCOs at Boys' Brigade summer camps, one half of this older building has been refubished as a general recreation room. It is available to people hiring one or more of the lodges, and can be made available to day users if not being used by occupants of the lodges.\n\nStedfast Pavilion\n\nThis building was refurbished for its current use in 2001. There is a single room seating 20 to 30 people, and a kitchen facility, and a spacious covered verandah with pleasant northward prospect overlooking the camp and lagoon. It is available to users of the lodges, or to day users if not being used by occupants of the lodges.\n\nSkip Turley Amenities Block\n\nThe main amenities for campers not using the lodge complex are contained in this building. There is a large kitchen and dining room. There are men's and ladies' toilets and showers with hot water. There is also a small laundry facility.\n\nThe building is conveniently located adjacent to the caravan sites, the ropes course, and the playing fields. And is quite handy to the Old Dorm Block and the Stedfast Pavilion.\n\nPhilip Grattan Memorial Hut\n\nThis spacious hut is located on the bushline to one side of the property, removed from the other facilities and close to the start of Bruce's Track. It was built by volunteer labour in Memorial to Philip Grattan, a member of the Wellington Boys' Brigade who died tragically. The hut has one large room and a covered porch facing westward.\n\nThere is cold running water drawn from the neighbouring stream. Campers need to provide their own cooking stoves, pans, crockery etc. There is ample bench and storage space. There are two platforms for sleeping about 20 people. Some mattresses are provided. There is no electricity or heating.\n\nThere are spaces for pitching tents nearby\n\nA long-drop is located about 15m from the hut. Otherwise campers may use the amenities in the Skip Turley Block (about 400m distant).\n\nThere is 4WD access to the hut.\n\nCaravan Sites\n\nPowered and unpowered sites are available for short or longer term rent. We are pleased to host a number of loyal caravaners on the site. All sites are located across the camp road from the Skip Turley block, and not far from the manager's house.\n\nTent Sites\n\nThere are several locations on the property suitable for tenting. Some sites suitable for larger tents are near the Skip Turley Amenities Block. Otherwise campers may chose their locations in consultation with the Camp Manager.\n\nPlease make sure that you remove all of your waste and don't damage the site or vegetation, or interfere with streams and drainage.\n\nDam and Lagoon\n\nOne of the two larger streams flowing through the property has been damned into a fine lagoon for swimming or kayaking, and generally just messing about in and around. Some kayaks and life jackets are available through the camp manager.\n\nWainui Challenge Ropes Course\n\nThis facility, located on-site next to the Skip Turley Block, is owned and managed by The Boys' and Girls' Institute, in Wellington. Bookings to use the equipment are required - contact details:\n\nRing (04) 385 9549 for information."
