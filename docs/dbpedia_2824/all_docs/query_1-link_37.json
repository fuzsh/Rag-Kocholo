        "text": "SUNDAY 21 APRIL 2024\n\nToday was Sunday and the weather was beautiful so after having lunch at Eatokyo on Capel Street I walked across Grattan Bridge and down Wellington Quay and got on the 74 bus and remained on board until we reached the LUAS Tram Stop in Dundrum.\n\nGrattan Bridge: Grattan Bridge is a road bridge spanning the River Liffey in Dublin, Ireland, and joining Capel Street to Parliament Street and the south quays. The bridge was originally developed by Sir Humphrey Jervis in 1676 and was named Essex Bridge. It was rebuilt in the 1750s by George Semple and again in the 1870s, when it was renamed Grattan Bridge.\n\nSeahorses: The bridge features ornate cast iron lamp standards that depict the mythical hippocampus, a creature that is half horse, half fish. These seahorse sculptures add a unique aesthetic touch to the bridge and are a notable feature of its design.\n\nLamp Standards: The lamp standards on Grattan Bridge are not just functional but also decorative. They are made of wrought iron and support a lattice work parapet. The lamp standards are mounted on panelled piers with rosette-detailed volute corbels on cut-granite panelled âCavettoâ corbels. The same creatures appear on lamp posts next to the statue of Grattan on College Green.\n\nThese features contribute to the historical and aesthetic value of Grattan Bridge, making it a significant landmark in Dublin. The combination of practicality and artistry in the bridgeâs design reflects the cityâs rich architectural heritage.\n\nCapel Street: Capel Street is a predominantly commercial street in Dublin, laid out in the 17th century by Humphrey Jervis. It is known for its variety of restaurants, shops, cafÃ©s, and pubs. Itâs also the longest pedestrianised road in the city.\n\nOrmond Quay: Ormond Quay is located on the north bank of the River Liffey. It features several historic buildings, including the 18 Ormond Quay Upper, a handsome example of a Liffey-side merchant house with layers of evolution dating from the 17th century to the 20th century.\n\nWellington Quay: Wellington Quay is another significant location along the River Liffey. Itâs home to notable establishments like The Clarence, a boutique hotel offering luxury rooms, and The Merchantâs Arch Bar & Restaurant, a popular spot for dining and drinks.\n\nParliament Street: Parliament Street was created in the early 1760s by the Wide Streets Commission to open up a direct route to Dublin Castle with retail buildings on either side. It runs from the junction of Dame Street and Cork Hill on its southern end to the junction of Essex Quay and Wellington Quay on its northern end where it joins directly onto Grattan Bridge and subsequently Capel Street.\n\nRiver Liffey: The River Liffey is a river in eastern Ireland that ultimately flows through the centre of Dublin to its mouth within Dublin Bay. Its major tributaries include the River Dodder, the River Poddle, and the River Camac. The river supplies much of Dublinâs water and supports a range of recreational activities.\n\nThese landmarks and the areas surrounding them are rich in history and culture, making them significant parts of Dublinâs identity. They offer a glimpse into the cityâs past while also serving as vibrant parts of its present. Whether itâs the bustling activity on Capel Street or the serene flow of the River Liffey, each location contributes to the unique charm of Dublin.\n\nAs I was standing at the bus stop a tourist asked me if there were dolphins in the Liffey and we I said that there were none he asked me why the restaurant near the stop was the “Giddy Dolphin” and why a nearby building was named “dolphin House”.\n\nThe Giddy Dolphin is a modern-day Irish pub, was a restaurant, located in the historic Printwork building on Wellington Quay. The name of the restaurant doesnât seem to have a specific historical or symbolic significance related to dolphins. It might have been chosen for its unique and memorable qualities.\n\nAs for Dolphin House on Essex Street, it was originally the Dolphin Hotel, a famous Dublin hostelry. The building, which dates back to 1887-1898, has now been converted to office space for the courts service. The dolphin in the name does not refer to the marine creature, but rather to the Dolfyn family who owned a prominent storehouse in the area in medieval times.\n\nSo, while the names Giddy Dolphin and Dolphin House might suggest an association with dolphins, they actually have different origins and do not indicate a specific connection to dolphins in the area. The use of âdolphinâ in these names appears to be more coincidental than indicative of a broader historical or cultural significance related to dolphins in Dublin.\n\nThe Printwork building on Wellington Quay, also known as Dollardâs Printing House, is a historic structure in Dublin, Ireland. The building was constructed between 1885 and 1890 and was originally used as a print works. It was built for the Dollard Printing Company, which was established in 1856 and moved to this site thirty years later.\n\nThe building is situated on the site of an early nineteenth-century retail building that had been built on part of Thomas Burghâs Custom House site. Fragments of the original Custom House were discovered during its construction. The design of the Printwork building, with its arched entrances and dormer windows, is quite reminiscent of Burghâs work.\n\nThe Printwork building is a prominent structure, constructed as one of the largest custom-built commercial premises in the city at the time of its realisation. It features a four-storey structure with attic accommodation and a basement storey. The building is made of red brick, laid in Flemish bond, to the walls of the upper floors, having pilasters dividing the bays. The basement level of the rear elevation has rusticated granite walls.\n\nThe building has undergone changes over the years. It was once home to the Dublin School of English, and it now houses the Giddy Dolphin, a modern-day Irish pub. Despite these changes, the Printwork building remains a significant architectural landmark in Dublin, reflecting the cityâs rich history and heritage."
