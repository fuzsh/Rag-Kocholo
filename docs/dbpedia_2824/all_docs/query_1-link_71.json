        "text": "Despite being the old city that it is, Dublin hasn’t exactly charmed me with its European buildings. From what I hear from the news and friends is that parts of the city aren’t very nice at all. Granted that any city would probably have that but somehow this seems to be a topic even in the news. The first thing my friend told me what under no circumstances should I venture north of the river. That was surprising since practically half of Dublin is north of the river. If you have been mugged three times in the city then you probably have a right to say that. So far, it has been okay for me in Dublin and I would have to admit that some parts of the city can be a bit dodgy. Just keep your wits about you and you will be fine.\n\nThe next bridge up on the River Liffey is the Grattan Bridge. This has a more old world feel to it compared to the lackluster Millennium Bridge just next door. There was an old bridge which was built previously but it was damaged and had to be replaced with the current bridge which was opened in 1874 and given its current name after Henry Grattan a minister of parliament back then. The bridge here is wide enough to support vehicular traffic and it even deserved its own traffic signals. The bridge itself is adorned with some beautiful lamp posts, unfortunately, I didn’t get to visit this place at night to see them in action.\n\n[xmlgm {http://www.worldwanderings.net/kml/GrattanBridge.kmz} zoom=19]"
