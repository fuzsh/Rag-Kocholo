While appreciating the clear benefit that this offers to those who choose to play with a Robot we are also aware of the fact that some players have expressed concern about playing against Robots.\n\nWe are now about to implement a change to the way in which Robots are used in these Human/Robot partnerships. Specifically, we will implement a change to our competitions which will require the human partner to play all hands that are initially contracted by the Robot. In essence this means that where a Robot is initially deemed to be declarer the human will TEMPORARILY switch place with the Robot partner and will then play the hand. Upon completion of the hand the human and Robot will be re-seated in their original positions for the start of the next hand.\n\nThis will happen for each and every hand where a Robot is initially deemed to be the declarer upon conclusion of the auction.\n\nWe hope to implement this change ASAP.\n\nGiven that this will be a major change from current practice we envisage that some players, especially the Robot's human partner, may initially be confused and not realise that they are declarer and not dummy! Opponents should be alert to this situation and should take the following actions if necessary:\n\na) Prompt the human via chat to Table (or private message) and remind them that they, and not the Robot, are declarer for this hand.\n\nb) If the above referenced prompt does not produce the desired response then please contact the TD.\n\nA Human playing with a Robot should be aware that they will automatically declare ALL hands that his/her side contract.\n\nAlso, the Human should be aware that their original hand becomes dummy. Declarer may need to re-appraise his/her line of play given the re-orientation that takes place when he/she swaps places with the Robot for the duration of the play, especially if the opponents have.bid during the auction.\n\nNote:\n\n1) At the start of play the Declarer's screen will now show the Robot's hand at bottom of their display and dummy will be positioned at top of their screen. This means that the Human/Robot hands have been switched and declarer should thus be aware that the defenders hands have also been similarly re-orientated and declarer should accordingly mentally switch any bidding by the opponents.\n\n2) The change will not impact the defenders whose screens should continue to display the original layout with respect to the orientation of the four hands as at the start of the auction.\n\n3) Upon conclusion of the hand the Human Player will be re-seated in the position that they occupied at the start of the round.\n\nPlease note the following screen captures, recorded by Robert Delargy, which illustrate the Human's (Robert) screen during the auction and also at the start of play.\n\nThe image above shows Robert in the West seat and his Robot partner has opened 1NT. Robert made a transfer bid of 2♥ and the Robot bid 2♠ which becomes the final contract.\n\nRobert now assumes the role of declarer and his screen is now reflected by the image above, Note that Robert, as declarer, is now holding the Robot's hand and the defender on declarer's left leads ♥ A. Note also that this defender was originally on Robert's right DURING THE BIDDING, as shown in the first image.\n\nNOTE: The defenders screens will remain the same throughout bidding and play.\n\nPaul J Scannell, 20th August 2022\n\nIt is with much sadness that we learned of the recent passing of Brian Place, a regular and popular player in the Galway, and wider, bridge-playing communities. Brian hailed from Eastbourne and graduated as a Chemist initially working in the Pharmaceutical Industry with GSK and Pfizer before crossing the Irish Sea and taking up the position of Head of Science at the newly opened Galway RTC in 1972 where he remained until his retirement. Brian was also a founder member of the RTC Bridge Club which used to meet in the Corrib Great Southern Hotel. In the early days he played with his then wife Susan. In later years he established a regular partnership with his daughter Fiona. With the advent of Covid-19 Brian played regularly online under his BBO name Avogadro1. [I have often thought of the BBO pseudonym that Brian chose and wondered if it was related to Amadeo Avogadro (1786-1856), the Italian scientist who, according to Wikipedia, was 'most noted for his contribution to molecular theory now known as Avogadro's law, which states that equal volumes of gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure will contain equal numbers of molecule.' It strikes me as an appropriate choice of BBO pseudonym by an erudite man who also had a wonderful, even sometimes wicked, sense of humour, who was simply taking the opportunity to pay homage to his scientific background! And was Brian piqued, but pleased, that an Australian bridge player had beaten him to the use of Avogadro in 2007 leaving Brian to append '1' for his choice of BBO pseudonym when he first joined the BBO bridge army in 2020.]\n\nIn addition to playing regularly, Brian also gave bridge lessons in Claregalway where he introduced his daughter Fiona, amongst many others, to the game. Photo below shows Brian in full flow with Fiona in the forefront listening attentively!\n\nBrian of course was an absolute 'charmer' in the fine old tradtional sense of the word. Gentlemanly and courtoeus to an extreme, he always had a pleasant word for partners and opponents alike. And as a BBO TD, I became used to receiving, without fail, a private 'Thank You' from Brian towards the end of each online session. But not for Brian a simple 'Thank You'....he always expressed himself in lengthier sentences of a more flattering, but genuine, nature.\n\nOur sympathy to Fiona and the extended Place family in particular his wife Annette and former wife Susan.\n\nMay he Rest in Peace.\n\nClick link for details of funeral arrangements as per rip.ie\n\nPaul J Scannell, 16th November 2021\n\nRecently I was 'kibbitzing' and came across the following gem.\n\nMost E/W pairs reached 3NT making 9-11 tricsk but at 5 tables E/W declared 4H, usually with East as declarer. At 4 of these tables declarer failed to make the contract but the fireworks took place at the fifth table where South Doubled the final contract! As can be seen, declarer appears to have FIVE losers via 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, and ♣ A and N/S looked like they were headed for a huge score on the board. BUT, they reckoned without 'mcgopro' who was at the helm as declarer. Unfortunately, for the defense, South made an opening lead of ♣8 (M.UD...Middle Up Down from three small cards.). North won with ♣A and continued with a club to declarer's ♣K. Declarer now tested the trumps by cashing ♥A and then ♥K, getting the bad news as North discarded ♠ 4. Declarer, perhaps getting a slight shock at the adverse trump break briefly took stock and then played three rounds of spades ruffing the third round with dummy's ♥6. Watching live I kept my fingers crossed that declarer would find the right continmaution and mcgopro did just that by leading ♣Q from dummy whilst discarding a small diamond from hand. Declarer then continued with another club winner from dummy and discarded another diamond from hand as South ruffed with ♥9. South belatedly found the diamond switch but declarer rose with dummy's ♦A and continuned with ♣7 whilst discarding his last small diamond from hand. South could ruff with ♥10 but declarer was now left with ♥Q8 whilst South held ♥J, ♦J and thus could not deprive declarer of the last two tricks!\n\nAnd so decalrer wrapped up ten tricks for a score of +790 and 96%. At another table East scored +1150 for 3NTx+2!\n\nCould the contract have been defeated? Yes...N/S had two chances to beat the contract. An opening diamond lead from South (perhaps unlikely) would have scuttled the contract as N/S would now score at least 1 diamond, 2 hearts, and 1 club. But North also had a chance to beat the contract by switching to a diamond at trick 2. Now N/S will score at least one diamond. North's club continuation assisted declarer by setting up dummy's club winners whilst ♦ A was still available as an entry to the winning clubs.\n\nDeclarer's success in the face of the bad trump break and potentially losing diamonds was to cash both of dummy's top hearts thus leaving ♥6 with which to ruff his third spade and then use the established clubs as secondary trumps, effectively disposing of his diamond losers whilst South had to ruff with master trumps! Note that declarer needs to be able to ruff his losing spade with ♥6 (NOT with ♥A or ♥K which would promote a third trump winner for South) AND then use dummy's winning clubs to discard losing diamonds from hand. Well played declarer. Take a bow!\n\nClick the link below to replay the hand from trick one to the end....simply click the 'next' option below the hand diagram to move through the play of each card.\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/2jtmyrn\n\nPaul J Scannell, 27th October 2021\n\nIt is with much sadness that we report the death of Brendan King who passed away yesterday evening after a brave fight with cancer that had plagued him for several years. Brendan joined The Tribes in the early 1990s and forged a bridge partnership and friendship with Roddy Wyer. Work commitments took Brendan away from Ireland for several years but the pair resumed their bridge partnership when Brendan returned to Ireland in the early 2000s. Brendan was elected Secretary of the club for the 2019-2020 season, a position that he conscientiously filled until ill health forced him to step down in late 2020 wherupon his good friend Roddy stepped into the breach.\n\nBrendan enjoyed his bridge and was a competent player. In the 1993-1994 season he won the Geraldine O'Flynn Trophy in partnership with Roddy and teammates, the late Hugh O'Neill & John Stack.\n\nBrendan & Roddy also won the club's Corn na dTreabh Trophy in the 2017-2018 season.\n\nBrendan's bridge was not confined to the Tribes Bridge Club and he formed a sucesssful partnership with Fiona Place with whom he played regularly on Wednesday evenings in the Galway Bridge Club. They also competed in regional events and at congresses around the country.\n\nBut, for those who knew him, Brendan will be remembered not so much for his exploits at the bridge table but rather for his gentle and friendly manner together with warm smile and genial disposition to all he met both at the table and away from it. Brendan was both a gentleman and a gentle man.\n\nWe extend our sympathies to his wife Angie, daughters Sarah and Fiona, and the extended family.\n\nClick this link to RIP.ie for details re funeral arrangements.\n\nMay He Rest In Peace\n\nPaul J Scannell, 1st September 2021\n\nThe Committee of the Galway Bridge Centre is delighted to announce that it will be resuming its traditional Summer Bridge service commencing on Monday, 31st May, 2021.\n\nMembers of all Galway Bridge Clubs, in particular those that are normally hosted at the Galway Bridge Centre, are encouraged to continue playing during the summer months until winter clubs resume in late September.\n\nAnd of course, over many years, Galway Bridge Centre has always extended open arms to visitors to the city and will continue to do so in this virtual format during these unprecedenetd times for players all around the world.\n\nSummer Bridge at Galway will be available online at BBO (Bridge Base Online) on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday, all sessions starting at 19.45.\n\nEntry Fee: 3BB$ per person.\n\nHost ID: CBAI 125548\n\nFormat may vary and will include Matchpoints (MPs), International Match Points (IMPs).\n\nGames will typically consist of 24 boards with either eight rounds of 3 boardd or twelve rounds of 2 boards.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you at the table in a game of Summer Bridge @ Galway Bridge Centre.\n\nDIRECTIONS: From the Bridge Base Online Home Page select Competitive under Featured Areas and then click on Virtual Clubs and then click on CBAI & NIBU - Ireland.

He loved the game and was an active member of several city clubs including Grattan, Galway, Tribes.\n\nUndoubtedly one of his most famous successes took place at the 1980 Ballina Congress when Paddy captained his three female team-mates to victory in the Congress Team of Four Championship. The October issue of the Irish Bridge Journal featured a lovely photo of the winners on the front cover...\n\n.\n\nPaddy was not only a bridge player but also an active supporter of the various clubs of which he was a member. He was a regular attender at President's Dinners and Christmas Parties organised by the various clubs.\n\nPaddy was also a founder member of the Action Committee that that brought about the purchase of the Galway Bridge Centre. He was a former Chairperson of Galway Bridge Centre Ltd.\n\nBut most of all Paddy was an exmeplary member. His gentle nature, gentlmanly manner, happy smile, warm and cheerful greeting, will be what he will be most remembered for by the many who had the good fortune to sit at his table. And for some he occasionally shared a joke or funny story. He never uttered a cross word to partner although he was quick to criticise himself for any shortcomings in his own bidding, play or defense.\n\nTruly it can be said that he was one of a kind.\n\nWe extend our sympathies to his wife Eileen and children Evelyn, Mary, Brenda, Philip.\n\nMay he Rest In Peace.\n\nClick here for direct link to notice on www.rip.ie\n\nPaul J Scannell, 30th June 2020\n\n."
