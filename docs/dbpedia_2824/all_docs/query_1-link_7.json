It was named as Essex Bridge to honour Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland who had also provided the finance for the construction of the bridge. It joined several of Jervis' developments (including Capel Street and Jervis Street) to the opposite side of the river and to Dublin Castle.\n\nEssex Bridge was an arched stone structure with seven piers, and apparently partly constructed from the ruined masonry of nearby St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin on the northside.[1] In 1687 the bridge was damaged by a flood resulting in the loss of a hackney and two horses. The damage to the bridge was only partially repaired.\n\n2nd Essex bridge of 1753\n\nEssex Bridge, Dublin (built 1753-55) - replacing an earlier Essex Bridge\n\n1755 illustration by Daniel Pomerade\n\nIn 1751 the second most northerly pier collapsed and damaged the adjacent arches.\n\nBetween 1753 and 1755 the bridge was rebuilt by George Semple, to correct flood and other structural damage and as one of the first initiatives of the Wide Streets Commission. The new bridge included stone alcoves or niches on either side of the bridge in a similar manner to London Bridge.\n\nIn 1764, John Bush, an English traveller, visited Dublin and had the following to say about the bridge:\n\n\"Over this river there are five bridges, one only of which deserves any notice, Essex-bridge, the lowest of all, which is really a well built, spacious and elegant bridge, with raised foot-paths, alcoves, and ballustrading, on the plan of Westminster-bridge, and about the same width, but not above one-fifth part so long\"\n\nFor much of the 18th century, Essex Bridge was the most easterly bridge on the Liffey and marked the furthest point upriver to which ships with masts could travel. Many ships needed to travel this far upriver in order to berth in front of the old Custom House, the centre of merchant activity in the city from 1707 until 1791.\n\nDuring this construction, some original features were removed, including the equestrian statue of George I, by John van Nost the Elder,[9] which was moved in 1798 to the gardens of the Mansion House. In 1937 it was bought by the Barber Institute of Fine Arts in Birmingham, in front of which it still stands as of 2023.\n\nGrattan Bridge of 1874\n\nFrom 1872, the bridge was further remodelled (on Westminster Bridge in London) by Parke Neville with further modifications by Bindon Blood Stoney, being widened and flattened with cast iron supports extended out from the stonework so as to carry pavements on either side of the roadway. The bridge was (and is still) lit by ornate lamp standards also in cast iron.\n\nThe bridge was reopened as Grattan Bridge in 1874, being named after Henry Grattan MP (1746-1820).\n\nLater development\n\nFrom 2002, Dublin City Council undertook a reconstruction of the bridge deck, with granite paving for the footpaths and a set of benches with wooden seats and toughened glass backs.\n\nAs part of what was intended to be a \"European-style book market\", in 2004 several temporary kiosks (prefabricated in Spain) were also controversially built on the bridge. Originally intended to create \"a contemporary version of an inhabited bridge, such as the Ponte Vecchio in Florence\", these kiosks were later removed.\"\n\n(visit link)\n\nWhat type of traffic does this bridge support?: all traffic except trains What kind of gap does this bridge cross?:\n\nRivier LiffeyIs the bridge still in service for its original purpose?: jaName of road or trail the bridge services: Capel Street en Parliament StreetLocation:\n\nDublin, IerlandLength of bridge: Not listedHeight of bridge: Not listedDate constructed: Not listed\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nPlease submit a photo(s) taken by you of your visit to the location (non-copyrighted photos only).
