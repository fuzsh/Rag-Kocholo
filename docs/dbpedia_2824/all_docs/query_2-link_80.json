It’s of Sunlight Chambers on Essex Quay taken from Ormond Quay so as to include the lamps on the western side of Grattan Bridge, a bridge some of you will be inclined to call Capel Street Bridge.\n\nAll of which reminds me that I still have an unfinished painting of Grattan Bridge and Sunlight Chambers. I also did a quick sketch painting of a Grattan Bridge lamp-post a fair few years back.\n\nclick to enlarge"
