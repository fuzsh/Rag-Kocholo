        "text": "Name Alternate names Connections Notes Image MacMahon Bridge Draw Bridge, Brunswick Bascule,[5] Victoria Bridge (1857 and 1900 bridges) Ringsend Road, Pearse Street - R802 Named after General Seán Mac Mahon. Rebuilt in 2007. Previous bridges in 1791, 1857, 1900 and 1960[6] (or possibly 1962[7]). Victoria Bridge[8] Rail bridge Dublin to Rosslare railway line Maquay Bridge Grand Canal Street - R815 Named after George Macquay, a director of the Grand Canal Company in 1791. There is not much information on the present bridge, though it is likely to date from the late 1930s like other reconstructed canal bridges in Dublin at that time. Mount Street Bridge McKenny's Bridge, Conyngham Bridge (original name) Northumberland Road, Mount Street Lower - R118 Built in 1791 and widened prior to 1916 and in 1956.[9] Named after Thomas McKenny, a director of the Grand Canal Company in 1791. Scene of the battle of Mount Street Bridge in the Easter Rising. Huband Bridge Mount Street Crescent Named after Joseph Huband, a director of the Grand Canal Company. Looks more ornate than other bridges as Huband paid for the bridge himself. The bridge was a favourite spot for the poet Patrick Kavanagh. Macartney Bridge Baggot Street Bridge Baggot Street - R816 Built in 1791 and named after George McCartney, chairman of the Grand Canal Company. This area of the canal along towards Leeson Street Bridge was an area often used by sex workers at night. In 1998 a prostitute was murdered over an alleged debt.[10] Eustace Bridge Leeson Street Bridge Leeson Street - R138 Built in 1791. Named after Lieutenant Colonel Charles Eustace, M.P. and Deputy Chairman of the Grand Canal Company. Tram tracks were added in 1870 along with an adjacent water mains pipe, bringing water from the Vartry Reservoir scheme.[11] For Queen Victoria's royal visit in 1900 it was decided to greet the queen with an old tradition of a triumphal arch. Originally Balls Bridge was chosen as the location, but the electric tram wires were deemed too high to make it practical, so instead Leeson Street Bridge was selected.[12] The gate, though painted to look like limestone, was actually a wooden structure held in place by guide wires. Similar '30 foot' structures were built for the royal visits in 1903 and 1911. In 1959 there was a proposal to reconstruct the bridge.[13] A number of drownings occurred at this location. Luas bridge Luas Green line Opened in 2004. Bridge dedicated to Professor Simon H Perry in 2005. Previous railway bridge, Canal Bridge, was dismantled in 1959 when the Harcourt Street line was closed.[14] Charlemont Bridge Ranelagh Bridge Ranelagh Road, Charlemont Street - R117 Often mistakenly called Ranelagh Bridge. Named after the adjoining street. There was a failed assassination attempt by the IRA of General Hugh Tudor in January 1921, as part of the Irish War of Independence. The bridge was reconstructed in 1940.[15] La Touche Bridge Portobello Bridge Rathmines Road Lower, Richmond Street South - R114 Built in 1791, named after William Digges La Touche,[16] a director of the Grand Canal Company. In 1861 a horse-drawn carriage fell into the lock with a loss of all 6 passengers and all horses.[17] Tram tracks were first added in 1871,[18] with overhead electricity completed in 1896.[19] During the Easter Rising and Civil War there were a number of events that took place at the bridge due to its strategic location.[20] In 1928 a bridge widening scheme was undertaken jointly by Dublin Corporation and Rathmines Urban District Council, the bridge was widened by 10 feet and steel lock gates were added.[21] Maintenance work was carried out in 2004 (steel parts of bridge replaced). Robert Emmet Bridge Clanbrassil Bridge (original name), Harold's Cross Bridge Harold's Cross Road, Clanbrassil Street Upper - R137 The original, Clanbrassil Bridge, was built in 1791 with tram tracks added in 1879 along with a longer approach to the bridge to lessen the gradient.[22] The bridge was rebuilt in 1935-36 and renamed to Emmet Bridge in honour of the rebellion leader Robert Emmet, who was arrested in the vicinity in 1803.[23] There is a ghost bike attached to railings beside the bridge. Parnell Bridge Sally's Bridge Clogher Road Built in 1791 and named after John Parnell (the great-great-grandfather of Charles Stewart Parnell),[23] but known generally as Sally's Bridge. The origins of the name are unknown with a number of explanations offered: a local man, John Sally, who had a farm near where Clogher Road now stands; that it got its name from the nearby River Saile or Salach; a 'lady of the night' who worked in the area.[24] In 1938 an Irish Times article suggested the road was once a toll bridge and an old woman called Sally was the toll collector.[25] The road was doubled in width during an upgrade in 1938. Camac Bridge Dolphin's Barn Bridge Dolphin's Barn, Crumlin Road - R110 Built in 1791. Named after Turner Camac, a director of the Grand Canal Company. Bridge works were carried out during 1938.[26] Repair works took place in 1964. Herberton Bridge Harberton Bridge Herberton Road Named after Lord Viscount Harberton, a director of the Grand Canal Company.[27] The original bridge was replaced by a concrete bridge in 1938.[23] The road was named after the bridge but at some point around 1878, Harberton became Herberton. Rialto Bridge Harcourt Bridge (official name) Over Luas Red Line South Circular Road - R811 This was on the former main line of the Grand Canal. During the construction of the canal a temporary wooden bridge was built in 1766.[28] in 1795 an elegant stone bridge was constructed,[29] which lasted until 1939 when a new wider concrete bridge was built. In 1974 the canal section was filled in. When the Luas Red Line was opened in 2004 the bridge was altered with the parapet raised above eye level. Original name of bridge comes from Simon Harcourt, 1st Earl Harcourt, Lord Lieutenant 1772–76. The name Rialto comes from a local area and is not related to the Italian Rialto Bridge. Griffith Bridge Grand Canal View Named after Richard Griffith, a director in 1791 (father of the late Sir Richard Griffith). Used only as an access road for apartments since the adjacent Suir Road bridge was built in 1938. Ann Devlin Bridge Luas Bridge Luas Red Line Built in 2004 for the Luas Red Line. Named in honour of Irish republican Anne Devlin. The plaque on the bridge spells her name as Ann Devlin, though on her gravestone in Glasnevin Cemetery it is spelled as Anne Devlin. Suir Road Bridge Suir Road - R111 Built in 1938 as part of a new road in Dublin in the expanding suburbs. Footbridge at Goldenbridge Luas station Pedestrian access. Footbridge at Drimnagh Luas station Pedestrian access. Built in 2004 for opening of Luas Red Line.
