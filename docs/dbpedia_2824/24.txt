My grandmother usually referred to this bridge as Capel Street bridge and sometimes she called it Essex Bridge.

This is an area where I have noticed a huge increase in the number of homeless people and beggars. People who do not live in the city centre may not be aware of how serious the problem as become or that it is getting worse week by week.

Grattan Bridge spans the River Liffey in Dublin, joining Capel Street to Parliament Street and the south quays.
