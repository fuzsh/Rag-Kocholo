        "text": "Diane Miller has not dated anyone since she was in love with Max Gionbetti on General Hospital. Max and his brother Milo were written out of the ABC daytime drama but it was never explained why. They were popular with the viewers and their characters could have been developed much better. Some time back Diane mentioned briefly that she was no longer dating Sonny's bodyguard and nothing more was said. A few weeks Epiphany was hanging out with Terry and Elizabeth and she let it slip that it was over between her and Milo.\n\nGH fans found this union straight out of science fiction as the two had never even looked at each other before. When they were near each other there was no chemistry and viewers wondered what the writers were doing. They were thrown together and there were never any love scenes between the duo, unlike Max and Diane. Those two made a really good fit but itâ€™s over and she needs to move on. The writers need to find love interests for both Epiphany and Diane and give these ladies more air time. There was s no eligible bachelor in Port Charles right now to pair with nurse Johnson but Diane and Martin, could possibly heat up the screen the way Julian and Alexis once did.\n\nDiane has stood by as her good friend Alexis dated Julian, Neil, and dallied with Ned, while she herself has remained single. Martin Gray is an interesting character and only now beginning to have a storyline of his ow, Initially, he was the lawyer for Nelle and Valentin who recently fired him. Now it appears that Martin has a connection to Cyrus and the two might possibly be siblings. He is also now caught in the midst of Julian Jerome's escape attempt. Thus far Diane and Martin have met in court but neither has seemed to take interest in the other.\n\nThis would be a good time for the two attorneys to come together. Sometime back there was an online poll regarding who was the better lawyer. Viewrs shoukd now weigh in on whether or not they believe these two have a chance at romance. Diane might be shocked down the road to find out that Martin has a connection to Cyrus. Some spoilers have teased that they are brothers and are somehow related to Laura Collins. Ms. Miller is no stranger to the dangerous side of life because after all, she represents Sonny and Jason. I think it would be nice to see Diane have a real storyline and not stand on the sideline as others in Port Charles live their lives.\n\nDiane Miller is portrayed by actress Caroline Hennessy who had roles in movies and TV on Dark Justice and Deadly Invasion: The Killer Bee Nightmare. She later was cast in a recurring role in Dawson's Creek., but she is best known for her work on General Hospital which earned her a Daytime Emmy nomination. She followed this with a series of guest appearances until she gained international acclaim after landing the role of Diane Miller on the daytime television series General Hospital. She also had roles on Revenge, Cougar and Jessie. She won her first Dsytine Emmy for her work in The Bay.\n\nMichael EvKnight who portrays Martin is best known for his popular role as Tad Martin on All My Children. It was not lost on viewers that his GH character had Martin for a first name. Knight left AMC to pursue acting opportunities on the West Coast, which included the movie Date with an Angel in 1987. Knight teceived two Daytime Emmy Awards for 'Outstanding Younger Leading Actor' in 1986 and 1987. In 2001, he was honored with a third Daytime Emmy Award. The popular received the 1997 Soap Opera Digest Award for 'Best Supporting Actor' and eas nominated in that same category the following year in 1998. In 2005, Knight was nominated for an Emmy as 'Outstanding Leading Actor'. On Social media a number of General Hospital fans say they still refer to him as Tad. Stay tuned to Heneral Hospital and find out if the writers put Martin and Diane together."
