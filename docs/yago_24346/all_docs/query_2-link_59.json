        "text": "General Hospital’s Martin Grey has been off the canvas for a bit, but his portrayer, Michael E Knight, is celebrating another turn around the sun!\n\nHappy Birthday, Michael E Knight\n\nThat’s because he was born on May 7, 1959, in Princeton, New Jersey, which means that this talented actor is turning a milestone 65 years old today! Knight began his career with the role of Tad “The Cad” Martin on ABC’s now-defunct All My Children.\n\nHis initial stint lasted between 1982 and 1986, at which point he left in order to pursue work in both primetime and feature films. He went on to appear in the movie, Date With An Angel, and guest star in episodes of Matlock and Murder, She Wrote.\n\nHe returned to All My Children for two further stints. The first between 1988 and 1990 and the second between 1992 and the soap’s concluding episode in 2011.\n\nKnight’s other screen credits include episodes of Dear John, Grapevine, Hot in Cleveland, and NCIS, and the made-for-television film, She Stood Alone: The Tailhook Scandal. He also starred in the off-Broadway play Cakewalk opposite Linda Lavin.\n\nHe paid daytime TV a return visit in 2015 when he briefly joined the cast of The Young and the Restless in the role of Dr. Simon Neville, who helped Hilary Curtis (Mishael Morgan) come out of her coma. He also struck up a friendship with Eileen Davidson’s Ashley. He has appeared on ABC’s GH as lawyer Martin Gray since 2019, which reunited him with several former All My Children co-stars, including James Patrick Stuart (Valentin; ex-Will, AMC).\n\nKnight was married to former Capitol and One Life to Live star Catherine Hickland from 1992 to 2006. The actor won three Daytime Emmys for playing Tad.\n\nSoap Hub would like to wish Michael E. Knight a very happy birthday and many more."
