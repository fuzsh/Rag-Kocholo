        "text": "Living Hope Church began in September of 2000. Two families met in a living room and committed to starting a church in the Alpena vicinity that would make a difference.\n\nThe church doubled its regular Sunday attendance from a country elementary school gymnasium to 21 in three months. By 2002, Living Hope realized the need to renovate and move to a vacant furniture store in the city. Despite considerable inconveniences, the members pressed on, and the church increased its attendance to 47 by year's end.\n\nIt quickly became evident that Living Hope needed more than 3,000 square feet to grow. In 2004, Living Hope Church moved to Werth Road, where it found its home for the next 13 years!\n\nLiving Hope's leadership recognized that additional space was required to reach the city of Alpena for Jesus. 2013 Living Hope Church purchased seven acres of land and planned to build a new facility immediately. The building campaign was postponed in the fall of 2014 when Pastor Tad Martin felt led to resign his position after fifteen years of faithful service to Living Hope Church.\n\nIn May 2015, Living Hope Church welcomed Pastor Lee Blanchard as their Lead Pastor. With a passion for the Alpena Community, unity among believers, and being the hands and feet of Jesus, Pastor Lee, his wife Renee, and his family dove into partnering Living Hope with many of Alpena's community outreaches and ministries. 2016 Living Hope decided to purchase our current property on M-32 W.\n\nThe new facility underwent significant renovations in 2017, and on December 17th, 2017, Living Hope celebrated our first Sunday in our new permanent facility! Following move-in, phase two began to complete the Children's Worship Center and the Foyer of the building.\n\nIn April 2022, Pastor Lee and his family resigned from their roles within Living Hope Church after seven years of faithful service to Living Hope, Alpena, and the surrounding communities. That same month, a Pastoral Search Committee was formed, and the search began for the next Shepherd of Living Hope Church that would usher Living Hope Church into its next season of service to Jesus Christ, the congregants of Living Hope Church, and the City of Alpena.\n\nIn October 2022, Living Hope Church voted to install Pastor Eldrick Lal as our new Shepherd. Pastor Eldrick has served Jesus in full-time ministry since the late 90s, serving in various exciting capacities in the United States and overseas. Pastor Eldrick holds a Master's Degree in Renewal Servant-Leadership from Seattle Bible College, a Bachelor of Theology from Atlanta Bible College, and an Advanced Diploma in Bible and Theology from the East Africa School of Theology.\n\nPastor Eldrick is married to Rosebell, and together, they have two children: a son named Ranson and a daughter named Hazel. Rosebell is a pastor's daughter with a heart for hospitality and children, with long service helping in children's ministries. Their children, Ranson and Hazel, love Jesus and have also helped in church life in areas including sound booth and children's ministries.\n\nLiving Hope Church desires to be welcoming to every person who wishes to come to hear about Jesus Christ and to reach those in our community through authenticity, a passion for Jesus, and a love for people. Living Hope is excited to raise generations of Christ-followers who are bold, courageous, and committed enough \"To do whatever it takes to turn ordinary people into passionate, devoted followers of Jesus Christ.\""
