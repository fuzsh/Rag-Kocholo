        "text": "Last Thursday night during a livestream interview, General Hospital’s Michael E. Knight chatted with Michael Fairman on You Tube’s Michael Fairman Channel about returning to daytime in the role of legal eagle Martin Grey, and mixing it up with some of the most famous notables and actors that currently and historically have graced the screens on the ABC daytime drama series.\n\nIn case you missed it, the replay of the conversation with three-time Daytime Emmy winner is now available. During the chat, Knight reveals what is has been like to play the on-screen half-brother of Genie Francis (Laura), if he enjoys the courtroom scenes in which Martin had to defend some of the most notorious in town including Nelle Benson (Chloe Lanier), and more.\n\nFans of GH are also enjoying the romantic pairing of Lucy Coe and Martin, pairing Knight with another soap vet, Lynn Herring. Michael shares that it’s nice to see, and appreciates, the writers creating a fun relationship for a couple that is middle-aged instead of always seeing the younger sets escapades all of the time on daytime TV.\n\nAll My Children fans, of course, recall Michael’s memorable performances through the years as Tad Martin, where he became synonymous with Pine Valley. After AMC came to its conclusion in 2011 on ABC and 2013 with Prospect Park, Knight finally returned to soaps in 2015 in the recurring role of Dr. Simon Neville on The Young and the Restless before joining the cast of GH in 2019.\n\nDuring the interview, Michael shares behind the scenes stories of working with his on-screen parents, Mary Fickett (Ruth) and Ray MacDonnell (Joe), his enduring on-screen love story with Dixie (Cady McClain), and the heyday of AMC in story, with his on-screen sister, Jenny played by Kim Delaney. When Michael came to GH, viewers recall he actually got to share an inside moment with Kim and the fans, when Martin met Jackie Templeton, then played by Delaney.\n\nDuring the livestream, Michael recalled several of Tad’s wives, and when one fan asked if Cady McClain might come to GH as Dixie, and that maybe she could be a woman from Martin’s past, Knight shared that it could be interesting.\n\nIn a surprise appearance later in the livestream, James Patrick Stuart (Valentin, GH), who has an enduring friendship with Michael, and happened to be at Knight’s house, shared some memories of his time as Will Cortlandt on All My Children. Now decades later, things have come full-circle for the good friends as they share screen-time on General Hospital as Valentin and Martin.\n\nStuart is a Daytime Emmy nominee this year for the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category at the upcoming 49th annual Daytime Emmy Awards, and we took a moment to congratulate him on being acknowledged by his peers for the second year in a row. Currently, James is pulling double duty shooting his Disney+ show, Villains of Valley View, while also taping GH.\n\nWatch the replay of the livestream with Michael E. Knight below.\n\nThen let us know, are you enjoying Martin and Lucy together? What do you think of the idea of Cady McClain coming to GH? Do you want to see more Valentin and Martin scenes? And, what are your favorite memories of Michael’s time as Tad on All My Children? Share your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nOn General Hospital, viewers will now see Lindsay Hartley stepping back into the role of Sam McCall temporary filling-in once again for Kelly Monaco.\n\nHartley began airing on today’s Thursday, August 22nd episode and reportedly via Soap Opera Digest, is only back for a “short-term stint.” Lindsay is no stranger to the soaps having also appeared as Theresa on Passions; Arianna on Days of Our Lives; and as Cara on All My Children.\n\nBack in 2020, when Kelly Monaco had to step away from GH for a bit, Hartley first took on the part. Later, she returned to play Sam in 2021, and once again in January of 2024. Taking to her Instagram Story, Hartley wrote, “Grateful to be stepping in again.” She was pictured in a photo from the funeral of Molly (Kristen Vaganos) and TJ’s (Tajh Bellow) baby alongside her on-screen mother, Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis) and also Kristina played by Kate Mansi.\n\nThe timing of Kelly’s temporary exit comes at a pivotal time for the character as her man, Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) awaits to see just what the prognosis is of his ex-wife, Lulu, who has been in a coma in a longterm care facility, plus all the drama between the Davis sisters.\n\nLast fall, Monaco celebrated her 20th anniversary with General Hospital and her fans have been clamoring for her to have more story as Sam has been a bit back-burnered of late. Is that all about to change? Stay tuned.\n\nSo, glad that if anyone was replacing Kelly, it was soap vet, Lindsay Hartley? Share your thoughts via the comment section below.\n\nWhat happens when a daytime soap opera takes their fictional home shopping network products and makes them a reality? That’s what has happened with the newly-announced partnership between General Hospital and Knocking, the content and commerce marketplace.\n\nNow, the licensed online shopping platform Shop Home and Heart.com, is live coinciding with the August 22 and 23rd episode of GH, and revolve around Deception promoting its latest product segment on Home & Heart.\n\nAt the epicenter is The Deceptor, which is now available on the online platform which is a aportable skincare device that was created as part of the show’s storyline involving its thirty-year-old beauty brand.\n\nKnocking had revealed that The Deceptor skincare wand features the latest advancement in skin rejuvenating property Red Light Therapy, it helps improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and rejuvenates skin. It’s lightweight, portable features allow it to be used at-home or on the go.\n\nIn addition, ShopHomeandHeart.com will offer real products inspired by the show’s beauty brand including: handbags, jewelry, and makeup inspired and worn by GH characters, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the world of General Hospital beyond the screen.\n\nFrank Valentini (executive producer, GH) shared in a statement, “Our exciting collaboration with Knocking gives us the opportunity to engage with our loyal fans in a whole new way.
