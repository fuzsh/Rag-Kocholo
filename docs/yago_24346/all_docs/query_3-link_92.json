        "text": "Brooke\n\ncompiled and copyright by MJP Grundy, 2002\n\nNicotiana tabacum, from Chambers's Encyclopædia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People\n\n(Phila.: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1885), 9:462.\n\nThis is not intended to be the definitive Brooke family genealogy; its purpose is only to explore in some detail the individuals from whom our particular family line descends. Bold face type or a blue underscored link indicate individuals who are ancestors of our family, whether or not they are Brookes. Most of them, however, are connected by marriage to the Brooke family.\n\nIf any reader has corrections or additions to this specific branch of the Brooke line, I would appreciate hearing from you. Send me e mail at . This page has already been greatly improved by folks who, although they had been strangers to me, offered helpful information. I've tried to credit them in the footnotes.\n\nSources can be found by clicking on the bracketted footnote numbers; or see all the citations at the bottom of this page.\n\nEnglish Ancestors\n\nEnthusiastic genealogists of an earlier age traced the Brooke family back to Charlemagne, twisting its way through many of the royal and noble families of medieval Europe. However, typical of much of that sort of work, it is not necessarily very accurate. I have not seen proof of the links, based on primary sources. I have certainly not done the research myself.[1] However, if I find adequate documentation for itor someone else is able to provide it to meit will get posted here. If any reader does have solid proof of the roots of the Whitchurch branch of the Brooke family, I would be very happy to see itand through this page share it with others, with your permission.\n\nSteve Hoffman, then of Whitchurch, Hampshire, England, worked on the puzzle of the origins of the Whitchurch branch of the Brooke family. The College of Arms has a pedigree attested to in 1622 by Thomas1 Brooke (son of ThomasA, grandson of RichardB) that says that Richard was the son of RobertC Brooke, who was the 3rd son of ThomasD Brooke of Leighton, Cheshire. However, before we jump to the conclusion that this is \"proof\" of an additional two generations, there are some shadows of doubt as to the accuracy of this attestation, based mainly on the surprisingly large difference in the arms of Thomas1 and ThomasD. [See the explanation of the National Genealogical Society's Numbering System used on this web page.] The description of arms of Brooke of Leighton given in the 1580 Visitation is:\n\n\"Quarterly1 and 4. Or, a cross engrailed per pale Gules and Sable. 2 and 3. Argent, a chevron Sable between three bucks heads cabossed Gules. [Parker.] Crest.A brock or badger Argent [proper].\"[2]\n\nAlthough I do not know enough about heraldry to evaluate the significance of this difference, I have received assistance from J. P. Beall, who writes:\n\nEnglish Arms were inherited by primogeniture, and in the case that a woman was the sole inheritor then her arms were quartered with her husbands, and those arms inherited by their first heir. Since these arms are much like signatures, bearing an individual's personal and legal standing, it would not have been allowed to have multiple people using the same arms. The one difference there is if younger siblings bought the right to register with those arms with small insignia added \"for difference,\" symbolic of their status as a \"cadet branch\" of a senior house. This, however most often happened in the case where the senior branch was titled. The Brookes of Leighton were Lords of a Manor, but this is not a title in a peerage, so it makes sense that the junior branch opted for its own arms.[2a]\n\nSince I have not yet researched the Brookes of Leighton and their ancestors, we’ll start with Richard BrookeB of Whitchurch, Hampshire, who was born about 1525. The approximate year of Richard’s birth is known because on 11 February 1575 he was a witness in a consistory court case, and gave his age as 50.[3]\n\nRichard was married in 1552 to Elizabeth TWYNE, said to be of Longparish, Hampshire, the sister and sole heiress of John Twyne.[5] This is problematical in that I could find no mention of any Twynes, with a variety of spellings, in the Longparish records on line. In addition, neither I nor Steve Hoffman could find any evidence of a John Twyne. However, all is not necessarily lost. The Visitation of Hampshire provides seven generations of an armigerous Twyne family. The first three undated generations were in Long parish, Southampton, the fifth and sixth in \"Grewell\", Southampton. Thomas Twyne of Greywell married Alice DOLMAN, daughter of Thomas of Newbury in Berkshire, and had a son Thomas and four daughters including “Elizebeth”. Unfortunately no spouses were given for any of these children.[5a] This was before parish registers began to be kept, so there is no way of checking this further with any official records. The story that Elizabeth was “sister & Heire of John Twyne” seems to come from a later Hampshire Visitation.[5b] It is possible, I suppose, that a younger brother named John was born after the Visitation, and Thomas and the other sisters died. It would help if a will could be found.\n\nSteve Hoffman has helped glean several more bits of information about Richard Brooke from the consistory court document. Richard was reasonably well educated in that he could read a court document that would have been in Latin. He was employed as steward to Sir Thomas WHITE of South Warnborough, whose son Stephen White was incumbent parson at Cheriton from 1554 to 1572.[6] St. Andrew's Parish Church in South Warnborough has a monument and windows with Whyte/White heraldry. South Warnborough is only about two and a half miles due south of Greywell, Hampshire, where the Twyne family lived. It seems quite possible that Richard could have crossed paths with Elizabeth while working as a steward.\n\nRichard Brooke's rise from steward to a large landowner and dealer in wool is a fascinating story with too little documentation. The most reasonable guess is that he was able to get a start when his wife came into her inheritance. Steve Hoffman developed a plausible (but not yet fully documented) hypothesis. In her will Elizabeth left to “my oldest son Richard Brooke” a number of things from among \"the household stuff at Adberye\". Its modern name is Adbury, and it is a small village about two miles south of Newbury. The Dolmans were a prosperous Newbury family and it is likely that Elizabeth had inherited the property, perhaps from her mother who came from Newbury, and that it remained in her power to bequeath it.[6a]\n\nProbably after Richard's time as steward in South Warnborough, Hampshire, the Brooke family lived in Whitchurch. Their residence was a large house called “Parsonage Farm”, opposite the church. It still exists, although since then it has been considerably altered, and is now called King's Lodge because Charles I stayed there a few days in 1644 while on his way to the Battle of Newbury. The older, Tudor-era timber-framed section is on the left in the photo. It was re-clad and extended in brick in the late seventeenth century. My thanks to Steve Hoffman for permission to use his photo. Richard owned the lease to Parsonage Farm and passed it on to his son Thomas in his will of 1593. The freehold of the property had been owned by the St. Cross monastery in Winchester before the dissolution.[7]\n\nThe town of Whitchurch is just to the east of route A34 between Newbury and Winchester, in Hampshire. It grew where the road between Oxford and Southampton crossed the road from London to Salisbury, at a ford in the river Test. Formerly it was a market town, the head of a union, in the hundred of Evingar. It is twelve miles north by east from Winchester. There is an online parish magazine with information about the town.[10]\n\nAll Hallows Church in Whitchurch is on the site of a much earlier Christian church, that may date back to Roman times. The earlier white building, perhaps built of limestone or chalk blocks, was torn down and rebuilt by the Normans. The present structure has what are probably 13th century Norman columns and arches on its south side, and a massive square Norman tower. The spire and chancel were added in the nineteenth century, when the north aisle was also enlarged.[11] The current vicar of Whitchurch, Kelvin Inglis, has informed me (via e mail 5m/28/2012) that the parish has begun “an ambitious project to extend the small hall and other facilities that adjoin All Hallows and improve access and toilet provision.” He has asked me to mention the project on this web page in case there are some “'well-disposed' people in the States who might be interested in what is happening (God willing) at All Hallows and who might even be interested in helping us to achieve our aim. . . . We call our facility the 'Church Room' at present, which is as neutral a name as there can be, but I would have no objection to a new hall or some other part of the proposed building being named in a way that appropriately marks the enduring connection with the Whitchurch people now 'over there'.” Kelvin Inglis can be reached at [email protected].\n\nA brass erected in the church at Whitchurch by their youngest son, Robert, shows Richard and Elizabeth in elegant clothing, befitting the family of a wealthy gentleman. The text says that Richard died 16 January 1593/4 after 41 years of wedded life, and his widow died 20 May 1599. There are two smaller brasses of their three sons and three daughters. Their wording is explicit:\n\nThey left behinde them well to live, and growne to good degree,\n\nFirst Richard, Thomas, Robert Brooke, the youngest of the three,\n\nElizabeth and Barbara, then Dorothee the last.\n\nAlthough the brasses originally were on top of the tombs, now they are in the east wall of the church, safe from footwear.[12]\n\nRichard’s will was dated 10 January 1588/9. It was confirmed 16 February 1590/1 and proved 6 May 1594 by Elizabeth, his widow and executor. I don't know if the order in which he listed bequests was typical for the time, or indicative of Richard's particular interests or personality, but a century or more later the items he placed first would more usually have been at the end. Richard gave 13/4d to the church in Whitchurch, £3 to the poor at the time of his burial, and 5/8d to each of his employees at the time of his death. The parsonage at Whitchurch and the lands belonging to it with their rents were to go to Elizabeth as long as she lived (no restriction if she remarried) and then would go to their son Thomas. Elizabeth received the residue of all the \"goods, chattels, plate, money, jewels, household stuff\", etc. Thomas got outright most of the rest of Richard's real estate, and £30 a year during the life of Elizabeth, his mother. He was given his father's silver basin and ewer. Thomas was to receive after Elizabeth's death 300 sheep, a quantity of wheat and malt, 12 cows and a bull, 12 cart horses with their harnesses and apparel, 5 of his best carts and 4 ploughs, and whatever household stuff Elizabeth wanted to give Thomas, based on his behavior toward her. If Thomas had no heirs, then Robert was to inherit the lands. Robert was given £100. Richard's son Richard also was given £100, but it is curious that as eldest son he received nothing else in his father's will. He may have received something earlier. Barbara was given £20 per year for life, payable twice yearly from the rents of specific lands that her father Richard held on lease. She was also to be given £300 on the day of her marriage or when she turned 23 years of age, plus another £100. She was given one silver gilt \"tanker\" and 12 silver spoons. Dorothy was to get the other silver gilt \"tanker\" and a dozen silver spoons. The third daughter, Elizabeth, doesn't seem to be mentioned, indicating that she may have died by that time.[13]\n\nElizabeth’s will was dated 16 May 1599, and proved 2 June that year by her son, who was the executor. She specifically left to “my oldest son Richard Brooke” at Burghclere, “one feather bed and one flockebed with all the household stuff at Adberye”, and “the bedstead wherein he lieth”.[14]\n\nChildren of Richard and Elizabeth (Twyne) Brooke (order based on the wording on the brass memorial in All Hallows):[15]\n\ni. Richard BrookeA, d. 1606; m. Sara __. Richard farmed in Burghclere, a little over a mile from Adbury. He inherited £100 from his father. It is intriguing that as oldest son he was not the prime heir of his father. Was it because he had no children? Was he not especially bright? Richard appointed his brother Thomas executor of his will, and Sara disputed Thomas’s actions. Had Sara married Richard hoping to be the mistress of Parsonage Farm? Was she disappointed in her marriage to a disadvantaged son? Apparently Richard had no problems with his younger, favored brother Thomas. The court decided in Thomas’s favor. Burghclere is part of All Saints parish, 9 miles south from Newbury. It has limestone of superior quality.[16] ii. Thomas Brooke, b. 1561; d. 1612. He inherited the bulk of his father’s property. See below.\n\niii. Robert Brooke, m. Mary DUNCOMBE, daughter and heiress of Giles Duncombe of Coleman St., London. Robert inherited £100 from his father. He was a citizen of London, merchant, member of the Merchant Great Adventurers, the India Company, and the Goldsmiths’ Guild. His indenture as an apprentice goldsmith can still be seen in the City of London. He had the monument erected in All Hallows church in honor of his parents. He had 4 children:[17]\n\na) William Brooke b) Richard Brooke c) Mary Brooke, m. __ SAUNDERS of Herefordshire,\n\nd) Elizabeth Brooke\n\niv. Elizabeth Brooke was not mentioned in her father's will, presumably having died by then.\n\nv. Barbara Brooke inherited £20 per year for life, payable twice yearly from the rents of specific lands that her father had held on lease. She was also to be given £300 on the day of her marriage or when she turned 23 years of age, plus another £100. She was given one silver gilt \"tanker\" and 12 silver spoons.\n\nvi. Dorothy or Dorothee Brooke inherited a silver gilt \"tanker\" and a dozen silver spoons\n\nLast Generation before Immigration\n\nThomas BrookeA was born in 1561, and died in 1612 at Whitchurch. He matriculated 24 November 1581 at New College, Oxford, at the age of twenty. He received a B.A. on 4 May 1584. Thomas was a barrister at the Inner Temple, becoming a bencher in 1607 (a senior member of an Inn of Court which governed the society), and an autumn reader in 1611. Thomas served as Member of Parliament from Whitchurch from 1604 to 1611 during the reign of King James I.[18]\n\nThomas married Susan FORSTER, daughter of Sir Thomas Forster of Hunsdon, or Hernsdon, Herts, and his wife Susan (Foster), of St. John Street, London.[19] Sir Thomas Forster was Judge of Common Pleas. His son, Susan’s brother, was Sir Robert Forster, Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, who died in 1663.[20]\n\nThomas and Susan (Forster) Brooke lived in Parsonage Farm (photo above) where his parents had lived. Later genealogists in the US, elevated it to a manor. Steve Hoffman informs me that Parsonage Farm was never a manor. At one time the farm was the vicarage.[21]\n\nThomas signed his will 11 September 1612. It was proved 30 November.[22]\n\nThomas was buried in Whitchurch 17 September 1612, and Susan was buried beside him the next day. They were memorialized with chalk sculptures of their figures lying side by side, shown here in a photo by Steve Hoffman. Originally the figures were probably under some sort of canopy and given a place of honor. But in time the sculptures deteriorated and were relegated to the bell tower. In the early 1900s money was raised in the U.S.A. by Thomas Willing BALCH of Philadelphia to install a granite monument to support the chalk sculptures. The Twyne coat of arms is quartered on the granite plinth.[23]\n\nChildren of Thomas and Susan (Forster) Brooke (order uncertain):[24]\n\ni. Thomas Brooke1, b. 1599; bur. at Whitchurch 25 Jan. 1665; matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, 27 Oct. 1615, age 16; barrister-at-law. He was killed by lightning while riding home from Winchester.\n\nii. Robert Brooke, b. 3 June 1602; d. 1655 in Maryland; m(1) Mary BAKER; m(2) Mary MAINWARING\n\niii.

Benjamin Brooke, b. the day his father d.; his mother d. the following day; Benjamin was christened on 18 Sept. 1612, the day she was buried; he d. y.\n\nFirst Generation in Maryland\n\nRobert Brooke1 the son of Thomas and Susan (Forster) Brooke. was born 3 June 1602 in London, between ten and eleven “in the forenoon, being Corpus Christi Day”. He died in 1655 in Maryland. He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, 28 April 1618, and was awarded a B.A. on 6 July 1620. He earned an M.A. 20 April 1624, which entitled him to be a minister in the established church.[25]\n\nRobert married first, on 25 February 1627, St. Matthias's Day and Shrove Tuesday, Mary BAKER, daughter of Thomas Baker, Esq., a barrister and Member of Parliament, and his wife Mary (ENGHAM). Mary (Engham) was the daughter of Sir Thomas Engham of Goodneston, Kent, and his wife Priscilla (HONYWOOD); Thomas Baker was the son of John Baker of Battel, Sussex, and his wife Elizabeth (ISTED). Mary Baker was born in Battle.[26]\n\nBattle, or Battel, is a market town and parish seven miles from Hastings, where the famous battle of 14 October 1066 was actually fought. In fulfillment of a vow, William the Conqueror had a magnificent Benedictine Abbey built there which contains a scroll listing all the warriors who accompanied him from Normandy. When Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries, it became the property of Sir Anthony BROWNE. The little town is in a beautiful valley. It used to have one irregular line of houses forming three streets. The old church has a square embattled tower; it is partly Norman, and partly done in later styles. The Lord of the Manor held a leet court which appointed the coroner and other officers.[27] Robert’s familiarity with this manor system presumably helped him establish a similar set-up in the new world.\n\nRobert Brooke, Esq. was listed in the 1634 Visitation in Hampshire.[28]\n\nAfter Mary’s death in 1634, which probably occurred at the birth of their daughter Barbara, Robert married Mary MAINWARING 11 May 1635. She was the second daughter of Roger Mainwaring, D.D., dean of Worcester and later bishop of St. David’s. Mary was born at St. Giles-in-the-Fields, London. Roger Mainwaring collided with Parliament over his zealous advocacy of royal prerogatives.[29] This family stance probably helped endear his son-in-law Robert to Lord Baltimore.\n\nIn 1649 Robert agreed to emigrate to Maryland with his second wife, eight sons and two daughters.[30] Robert arrived in the Patuxent River on 30 June 1650 in his own ship with his wife, ten children, twenty one male servants and seven “maid servants”. He also brought a pack of fox hounds; it is said that his strain of hounds still exists in Southern Maryland.[33]\n\nRobert and his two eldest sons, Baker and Thomas, took the oath of fidelity to the Proprietary on 22 July 1650. [34] They sailed further upstream than had other settlers, and Robert chose 2,000 acres on the west side of the Patuxent which he named “DeLa Brooke Manor”. It was surveyed 28 July that year, and entered in the books of St. Mary’s County.[35] Robert named his eldest son, 20-year-old Baker, Lord of the Manor.[36] The new county was erected 30 October 1650 with Robert as Commander. It was named Charles, celebrating the King who had lost his head, or for his royal son who carried the hopes of the monarchists into exile for a decade, or for the son and heir of the Proprietary. The name was changed briefly to Patuxent, and then to Calvert County, which name it has retained for 350 years. Robert also had 2,000 acre “Brooke’s Court” in Prince George’s County surveyed 21 November 1650.[37] In 1652 Robert moved to “Brooke Place Manor”, on the east side of the Patuxent.[38] Other tracts he owned were named for his mother’s home in England, “Battle town” and “Battle Creek”. The latter was on the northern boundary of “De La Brooke Manor”.[39]\n\nRobert died 20 July 1655, and was buried at “Brooke Place Manor”. It is assumed he died suddenly, as he left no will. [44] Mary died 29 November 1663. [45]\n\nChildren of Robert and his first wife, Mary (Baker) Brooke:[46]\n\ni. Baker Brooke2, b. 16 Nov.1628; d. 1678/9; m. 1664 Anne CALVERT, daughter of Leonard Calvert (ca. 1606-1647), brother of the proprietor, and sometime Governor of Maryland. Baker converted to Roman Catholicism, probably when he married. He served in the Md. legislature.[47] He also served as a justice, and a typical day in court is described in Semmes.[47a] Baker signed his will 19 Mar. 1678 (prob. 26 Mar. 1679/80); it mentions his brother Col. Thomas Brooke.[48] As lord of “De La Brooke Manor” (patented to him in 1658), Baker built a brick 30' x 40' one and a half story house, with a steep roof and dormer windows. Rooms on the lower floor were handsomely wainscotted. Parlors had massive wooden cornices and friezes, with roses and other floral designs carved in relief. The house was built on top of a hill, about a mile from the Patuxent River. It burned down in 1835.[49] Anne m. twice more after Baker died. Child of Baker and Anne:\n\na) Mary Brooke, m.

In 1661 the question of coinage came before the Assembly. In economic considerations, the colonies were chronically short of specie. But politically, coinage of money was an act of highest sovereignty. Robert Brooke and Edward LLOYD opposed in the Council a bill for establishing a mint on the grounds that the Palatine of Durham in England had no \"liberty\" to coin money, and therefore the Palatine of Maryland did not. The Assembly passed it anyway, although it is debated among scholars whether of not a small mint was ever actually established.[55]\n\nviii. John Brooke, b. 20 Sept. 1640 in Battel; d. 1677; m.

This was done, and the resulting report by an untrained man described putredness inside that led them to believe the man died of sickness (but presumably not malnutrition or mistreatment).

At the age of 18, in 1650, he emigrated with his father, step-mother, and nine siblings to Calvert County. He married about 1658 Elinor HATTON, daughter of Richard and Margaret Hatton.[58] She was the niece of the Secretary of the Province, Thomas Hatton.[59] They established a “pious Catholic family”.[60] Three of their sons became Jesuit priests.\n\nThomas probably had considerable schooling. He was raised a Protestant, but converted to Roman Catholicism.[61] The family belonged to what was sometimes referred to as the “Court Circle” in St. Mary’s City.[62] They were wealthy, and that brought political and social prominence.\n\nThomas was commissioned a Captain in the Calvert County militia 15 June 1658.\n\nThe legal records of the Province give small glimpses of a few of Thomas’s activities as a respected and wealthy member of the community. He and his step-brother Francis were named residual legatees in a will in 1660.[66] He witnessed the will of James LANGWORTH of Charles County on 18 August 1660.[67] On 2 April 1662 he witnessed the will of Robert COLE of St. Mary’s County.[68] In December 1673 Major Thomas Brooke was named as back-up to inherit his brother-in-law Luke GARDINER’s estate if Luke’s children all died wthout leaving heirs of their own. [69]\n\nThomas, like most wealthy planters, was appointed a justice of the peace. He served on the bench in Calvert County from 1661 until his death in 1676, being a part of the quorum from 1669 through 1676, and Presiding Justice from 1667 (except while he was Sheriff). He served two terms as High Sheriff, 1666-67 and 1668-69. [70]\n\nHe was elected to the Lower House of the Maryland legislature and served four terms in Annapolis: 1663-64, 1666, 1671-74/5, and 1676 (dying before the beginning of the second session that year).[71] In 1667 he was named to a commission from Maryland to confer with Sir William BERKELEY, Governor of Virginia, regarding the over-production of tobacco, which was depressing prices.[72] As tobacco was a medium of exchange more common than coins, in addition to being the main cash crop, the economic ramifications were serious.\n\nThe earliest Special Warrant to Thomas for land was for 1,000 acres on 14 August 1663.[73] The first land surveyed to Thomas in St. Mary’s County was 150 acre “Brooke’s Neck” on 3 August 1666.[74] At the time of his first election Thomas owned 3,000 acres, of which 2,000 had been given to him by his father. [75]\n\nThomas signed his will 25 October 1676, and died before 29 December 1676 when it was probated. He left part of “Delabrook Manor” to his wife Elinor during her life, then it was to go to their son Thomas. Young Thomas also got part of “Brookefield” when he turned 21. Son Robert got the rest of “Delabrook Manor” and “Brookefield”. Ignatius received 700 acres of the larger “Brook Grove” and also “Crossoloths” and “The Wedge”. Matthew was given the remaining 300 acres of “Brooke Grove” and 500 acre “Brooke’s Content”. He was given 50 acre “Grove Landing” jointly with Ignatius. Clement was given “Poplar Neck”, with the provision that if he died before age 21 it should go to Thomas’s daughter Elinor. Daughter Mary was also remembered, as were Thomas’s brothers Baker and Roger, Clement HILL, and two god-sons Baker Jr. and Thomas GARDINER. He bequeathed two hogsheads of tobacco each to Michael FOSTER and Henry CAREW, priests, because he said, “I am Roman Catholic and desire good Prayers of the church for my Soul”. His estate was valued at 95,910 pounds of tobacco, the preferred medium of exchange. It included ten slaves, ten indentured servants, and 7,742 acres. [76]\n\nElinor married for a second time Henry DARNALL, who was born ca. 1645. Like her first husband, Henry also served in the Maryland legislature. Henry’s first wife, whose name is not known, had been a Catholic. They had five children, who Elinor helped raise. Henry’s son Philip married Elinor’s daughter Elinor Brooke. Henry died in 1711.[77]\n\nElinor died in 1725.\n\nChildren of Thomas and Elinor (Hatton) Brooke (order uncertain):[78]\n\ni. Thomas Brooke3, b. ca. 1659; d. 1730/1; m (1) Ann __; m (2) Barbara DENT.\n\nii. Robert Brooke, b. 24 Oct. 1663; d. 18 July 1714 at Newtown, Charles Co.; educated at a Catholic school established in Maryland in 1677; became the first Maryland-born man to become a priest, becoming a Jesuit at Watten in 1684. He settled at St. Ignatius Church in Port Tobacco, Md. [79]\n\niii. Elinor Brooke, m (1) Philip DARNALL (1671-1705) her step-brother, son of Henry Darnall by his first wife; m (2) William DIGGS, son of William (ca. 1650-1697). William Sr. was a Protestant with a Catholic wife, Elizabeth SEWALL (d. ca. 1710); he was the only Protestant on the governor's Council in 1689; after the Glorious Revolution he removed to Virginia where his plantation became a refuge for his Catholic relatives and friends.[80]\n\niv. Mary Brooke, m (1) James BOWLING (1636-1693) of St. Mary's Co.; m (2) Benjamin HALL (1667-1721) of Prince George's Co., a Quaker who became a nominal Anglican when he served in the Md. legis., then became Roman Catholic; m (3) Henry WITHAM.[81]\n\nv. Ignatius Brooke, b. 1670; d. 1751; a Jesuit priest, entered the Society of Jesus in 1697.\n\nvi. Matthew Brooke, b. 1672; d. 1703 or 1762;[82] a Jesuit priest, entered the Society of Jesus in 1699.\n\nvii. Clement Brooke, b. 1676; d. 1737; m. Jane SEWALL, daughter of Nicholas Sewall (ca. 1655-1737) and his wife Susanna (BURGESS); Nicholas was a Catholic planter who served in the Upper House, Council, on the Provincial court, Board of Deputy Governors, and as Secretary of the Province. He attained the rank of major. Jane's step-grandfather was Charles CALVERT, third Lord Baltimore.[83] Clement’s oldest son was Henry Brooke (1704-1751) who lived in Prince George's Co. Clement's daughter Susanna Brooke m. Walter SMITH (ca. 1692-1734), son of our Walter Smith.\n\nThere is a Robert Brookes, thought by some to be a member of this large Brooke family. But the careful research of Charley Marsteller conludes that Robert and Margaret (__) Brookes are not related to this family, and are thought to have come to Maryland early in their lives, possibly from Scotland given the later intermarriages into the Bowie family. Robert died prematurely (inv. 1740/PG) leaving an apparently strong widow, an Ordinary Keeper before and during the American Revolution who promoted the education and economic success seen in the succeeding 2nd and 3rd generations. Margaret married secondly John Gibson (inv. 1762/PG), carpenter and possibly a furniture maker. Robert & Margaret (__) Brookes (w1783/PG) left issue: Benj. Sr (w1786/PG)*; Henry (w1807/Montgomery Co.) of 'Montpelier' = Martha Bowie (Jas-John); Robt. Pack (likely disabled); Mary (w1800/PG); Elizabeth (w1798/PG); Margaret (w1790/PG); & Ann (w1794/PG) -- none of the daughters ever married. Three of the issue of Benj. Sr married siblings of four-term Gov. Robert Bowie, and Henry's sons James Bowie Brookes = Juliet Bowie (Walter-Wm-John) & Henry Bowie Brookes = Susannah Dorsey (Patriot. Caleb-Thos. Beale-Caleb-Capt. John-Edward).[83a]\n\n*Son Maj. Benj. Brookes Jr, Cont'l. Army was severely wounded at Monmouth; upon retirement he was promoted to General, MD Militia, and = Margaret Sprigg Bowie (Wm-John), sister of MD. Gov. Robt. Bowie.\n\nThird Generation in Maryland\n\nThomas Brooke3, the son of Thomas and Elinor, was born in Calvert County about 1659, and died in 1730/1. Nothing much is known about his first wife, Ann (___). She was alive in 1687 when she joined her husband in signing two deeds.[84] After her death Thomas married Barbara DENT seventeen years his junior, daughter of Thomas and Rebecca (WILKINSON) Dent:. Barbara was born in 1676 and died in 1754. They were married some time before 4 January 1699 when Barbara joined him in executing a deed.[85]\n\nThomas was raised Catholic but by 1691, at the time of the Glorious Revolution when the Church of England was established in Maryland, he was Anglican. That is probably about the time he married the young granddaughter of Maryland’s first officially accredited Anglican priest, William Wilkinson. That is also the date from which time he was styled Esq. From 1693 to 1697 he served on St. Paul’s Vestry (Calvert County).[86]\n\nThomas’s first public assignment came in 1683 when he was named to a commission charged with laying out the town and ports in Calvert County.[88] Thomas was a planter and took the familiar path of appointment as justice of the peace from 1685 to 1689, being part of the quorum from 1686 on. In 1689 he probably opposed the revolution of the Protestant Associators, and was removed from his justiceship.[89]\n\nThomas was a wealthy man. He owned 6,011 acres in 1689, and 9,517 by 1696. The first land surveyed for him in Prince George's County, was 3,697 acre “ Dann” on 16 September 1694.[95] He resided at “ Brookefield” on the upper Patuxent, inherited in part from his father. In 1696 it became part of Prince George’s County. His father had had its boundaries marked with stone markers carved with the initials T. B. The small village that developed there where, today, routes 301 and 5 cross, is named TB.[96] However, Thomas over-extended himself financially and had to sell land to pay off some debts. By 1706 he only owned 7,393 acres.[97]\n\nThomas signed his will 16 or 30 November 1730, and died 7 January 1730/1. The will was probated 25 January. He left most of his estate to his three youngest children, Baker, Thomas, and Lucy, and specified that they were to be raised in the Church of England under the care of their mother. If she died or married, they were to be taken under the care of Thomas’s sons-in-law Thomas GANTT and Alexander CONTEE. The three youngest children, along with Walter and Richard, the sons of their oldest half-brother Thomas, were bequeathed 100 acres of the much larger “Delabrooke Manor”, commonly called “Quantico” on the Patuxent River in St. Mary’s County. Thomas had been to law about the right to this land with Edward COLE. The outcome of the lawsuit is unknown. Thomas’s oldest son, Thomas, and son-in-law Thomas Gantt were named executors. The will specified which tracts were to be sold to pay the debts due to Capt. John HYDE & Co. and to Mr. Charles CARROLL. His estate was valued at £1,374.0.0 including proceeds from the sale of land, most of which was heavily mortgaged; it also included thirty-six enslaved human beings, of whom seventeen were mortgaged. Various enslaved individuals were bequeathed to his children. However, when the estate was finally settled, it was short by £355.3.0. In other words, the estate was indebted that much beyond its assets. Barbara claimed the one third widow’s portion the law allowed.[98] I assume that she is the only one who got anything from the estate.\n\nBarbara died in 1754. Her will was dated 24 February 1748/9 and probated 26 June 1754.[99]\n\nChildren of Thomas and his first wife Ann (order uncertain):[100]\n\ni. Sarah Brooke4, d. Nov. 1724; m (1) William DENT (ca. 1660-1704), son of Thomas Dent (ca. 1630-1676) and his wife Rebecca (WILKINSON); m (2) Philip LEE (ca. 1681-1744), son of Col. Richard Lee (1646-1714) of Westmoreland Co., Va. and his wife Letitia (CORBIN). Both of Sarah's husbands served in the Md. legislature. Philip m (2) ca. 1726 Elizabeth LAWSON, widow of Henry SEWALL, son of Nicholas and brother of the second husband of Sarah's sister Elinor.[101] We are descended from Sarah's first husband's sister Barbara Dent, as well as Sarah's half-sister Mary Brooke.\n\nii. Elinor Brooke, m (1) 1705 John TASKER son of Thomas Tasker (d. 1711); John served on All Saints' Parish Vestry in 1705. Elinor m (2) Charles SEWELL (d. 1742) of Eltonhead Manor, St. Mary's Co., son of Nicholas (ca. 1655-1737); both fathers-in-law served in the Md. legislature. Tasker was Protestant, and Sewall was Catholic.[102] We are descended from Elinor's first husband's sister Elizabeth Tasker. Elinor inherited from her father 130 ac. of \"Brooke's Chance\" where Derby RHINE lately lived, during her life, then it was to go to her son, Thomas Tasker. But as the estate was in debt, she probably did not get anything.[103]\n\niii. Thomas Brooke, b. 1682 or 1683; d. 1744; m. 1705 Lucy SMITH, daughter of Walter Smith. We are descended from Thomas's wife's brother, Richard Smith.\n\niv. Priscilla Brooke, m. by 1726 Thomas GANTT (d. 1765) who served in the Md. legislature. He m (2) Margery HOLLYDAY (d. 1764), daughter of Thomas (ca. 1661-1702/3) and widow of Levin COVINGTON (d. 1725).[104] Thomas Hollyday is probably the one who helped spread the rumor written about by John ADDISON leading up to the Protestant Association's coup. He served on St. Paul's vestry (Calvert Co.). He probably is no relation to our Hollidays.[105]\n\nChildren of Thomas and his second wife, Barbara (Dent) Brooke (order uncertain):[106]\n\nv.

Alexander was an Anglican, gent., attorney, planter, and merchant who served in the Lower House from Charles Co. His estate in Prince George’s Co. was inventoried with a value of £1,613.2.11 sterling, plus £3,827.19.8 current money and included 32 slaves, 2 servants, books, and clerk’s writing equipment. He owned at least 2,598 acres in Charles and Prince George’s Counties.[108]\n\nix. Rebecca Brooke, d. 1763; m. John HOWARD (d. 1742) of Charles Co. who seems to be no relation to our Howards.\n\nx.

Baker Brooke, b. ca. 1715; he, Thomas, and Lucy were bequeathed the residue of their father's personal property after their mother took her widow's third; along with Walter and Richard, the sons of their oldest half-brother Thomas, the five of them were bequeathed 100 ac of \"Delabrooke Manor\" commonly called \"Quantico\" on the Patuxent River in St. Mary's Co. However, since the estate was in debt, they probably got nothing.[107]\n\nxiii. Thomas Brooke, b. 1717; d. 1768; unmarried.\n\nxiv. Lucy Brooke, b. ca. 1719; m. Thomas HODGKIN.\n\nFourth Generation in Maryland\n\nMary Brooke4 died in 1758. She was the daughter of Thomas and his second wife, Barbara (DENT), and is from the part of the family that is not very well documented. She married Patrick SIM, a physician who had emigrated from Scotland. They resided at “Sim’s Delight” on the southern side of the Patuxent River. Patrick inherited one and a half acres at Nottingham from his father-in-law. Patrick died on 24 October 1740.\n\nChildren of Patrick and Mary (Brooke) Sim:[110]\n\ni.

Catherine's father served in the Maryland legislature; her maternal grandfather was Thomas ADDISON (1679-1727).[111] His wife's obituary in 1771 said Joseph was \"of Prince George's Co\". Joseph m(2) ca. 1775 Lettice LEE (d. 11 Apr. 1776), daughter of Philip Lee (ca. 1681-1744) who served in the Md. legislature. Lettice was the widow of James WARDROP (d. 1760) and Dr. Adam THOMSON (d. 1767). Philip Lee was the second husband of Joseph's aunt, Sarah (Brooke) Dent Lee. By Nov. 1779 Joseph res. on \"Addison's Choice\" in Frederick Co.; he was in the 1790 census in Frederick Co.; the listing included 2 free white males over the age of 16, one under 16, and a free white female.

It delves into the social system, economics, religion, and politics that developed in colonial Maryland. The white elite considered themselves the pinnacle of civilization, while their wealth and power were dependent upon a horrifically brutal racist enslavement system.

Steve Hoffman reported that the Hampshire Visitation of 1634 document shows Thomas as Richard's first son. Steve explains this is \"the source of much subsequent confusion about this, I fear. I still feel that the Whitchurch brass is very solid evidence that this is wrong because the brass is so explicit. Since Richard had no children, the source of the visitation info would have been from Thomas's descendants, the only branch left in Whitchurch (Robert having gone off to London to be a goldsmith). It would be natural for these descendants to believe that their Thomas was the oldest son, especially since he inherited the bulk of his father Richard's estate, so, naturally, that is what they would have told the visiting herald.\" E mail, 1/20/2004.\n\n16. Information from Steve Hoffman, e mail 1/1/2004. He suggests that because Thomas, the second son, inherited the bulk of their father's estate, and Richard, Jr.'s widow Sara disputed Thomas's actions as executor of her late husband's estate, “there was clearly some kind of mild estrangement or a degree of bad feeling there, but not a total split, because Richard does get a mention in both his parents' wills.” Richard also named his brother Thomas as his executor, indicating a fair degree of trust.

Henry Brookes's eldest son, Henry, Jr. (1728-1807) in 1780 (during the Revolution when land that had been attainted was becoming available) began buying land in Montgomery Co., Md. and eventually owned 1,000 acres. In 1783-1793 he constructed his splendid brick mansion, \"Montpelier\". It was demolished ca. 1950 to be replaced by IBM's center on what became I-270. Henry, Jr's oldest daughter was Martha Brookes who m. Benjamin GAITHER, founder of Gaithersburg, Md.
