        "text": "American actor\n\nMichael Edward Knight (born May 7, 1959) is an American actor, best known for his role as Tad Martin on ABC soap opera All My Children.[1][2][3]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nKnight was born in Princeton, New Jersey. He was educated at The Thacher School in Ojai, California, and attended Wesleyan University, graduating in 1980, a year ahead of schedule.\n\nKnight's first major acting role was portraying Tad Martin on the soap opera All My Children. His first stint on the show ran from 1982–1986. He returned from 1988–1990, and again from 1992 until the ABC series finale in 2011 and the online revival of the series in 2013. Knight also appeared as Ted Orsini on AMC from 1993–1994.[4] His reason for initially leaving All My Children was to pursue acting projects on the West Coast, which included a starring role in the feature film Date with an Angel (1987), and various primetime appearances — including Murder, She Wrote, Dear John and Grapevine. Knight co-starred in the off-Broadway play Wrong Turn at Lungfish, and he appeared in the ABC movie for television She Stood Alone: The Tailhook Scandal, and in the off-Broadway Cakewalk with Linda Lavin.\n\nKnight was honored with two Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series (1986 and 1987). In 2001, he was honored with his third Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. He also received the 1997 Soap Opera Digest Award for 'Best Supporting Actor' and a nomination in the same category in 1998. In 2005, he was nominated for an Emmy for 'Outstanding Leading Actor'.\n\nKnight was married from June 27, 1992 through 2006 to One Life to Live star Catherine Hickland, who was previously married to actor David Hasselhoff who coincidentally had played a character named \"Michael Knight\".\n\nKnight and Hickland were honored for their charitable work by the West End Intergenerational Residence in Manhattan in 1999.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Knight had a recurring role as Dr. Simon Neville on CBS' The Young and the Restless.[5] On February 2, 2017, Knight made a surprise appearance on the Hallmark Channel's Home & Family show, where he was reunited with a number of his former All My Children castmates.[6]\n\nOn September 30, 2019, Knight began appearing in a recurring role on General Hospital as lawyer Martin Gray.[7]\n\nSelect filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision and film roles Year Title Role Notes 1982–1986, 1988–1990,\n\n1992–2011, 2013 All My Children Tad Martin Regular role 1987 Date with an Angel Jim Sanders Film 1988 Matlock Daniel Fontaine Episode: \"The Magician\" 1993 Hexed Simon Littlefield Film 1993–1994 All My Children Ted Orsini Recurring role 1996 A Different Kind of Christmas Alan Schaefer TV film 2001 Law & Order: Special Victims Unit David Steadman Episode: \"Redemption\" 2003, 2005 One Life to Live Tad Martin Guest role (crossover) 2011 Hot in Cleveland himself Episodes: \"I Love Lucci: Parts One & Two\" 2015–2016 The Young and the Restless Simon Neville Recurring role 2015 NCIS Leland Robert Spears Episode: \"Blast From The Past\" 2019–present General Hospital Martin Grey Recurring role\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nTad Martin and Dixie Cooney\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
