        "text": "1 / 30\n\nBrooke DeVard Smith met Umut Hilmi Ozaydinli in London during the 2012 Summer Olympics. They weren’t competing, but they were both working, and very, very hard. Umut was wrapped up organizing a major concert for Coca-Cola, and Brooke was busy producing six short documentary films about underground music for Nokia. One fateful night they both happened to be at the Dorchester hotel and were introduced by a mutual friend. They stayed in touch, mostly about business (Brooke often asked Umut for work-related advice), but then began to develop a stronger bond. “I was still in London and Umut was in New York when we started dating,” Brooke explains. “Being long distance actually really intensified the courtship. We would meet in various cities around the world, between work commitments, to see each other, and ultimately realized we wanted to build a life together in New York.”\n\nAnd after a year and a half of seriously dating, they began to do just that. She and Umut decided to take what became a very memorable, and well-deserved, vacation. “Umut proposed to me in Tulum, very simply one night while I was taking a bath,” Brooke recalls. “I was completely caught off-guard. He went to reach for the ring and I happened to slather on a facial treatment in that exact moment. So when he did it, I had a full face of Mayan clay, which we still laugh about today.” The couple first said their “I do’s” in a casual ceremony inside the Manhattan Marriage Bureau the first week of September, but would travel to Italy for a proper celebration on the 30th of the month. “We chose Tuscany because we love the food, the wine, and the natural landscape of the region,” Brooke explains. “We both wanted a place with authenticity and a built-in sense of glamour. We also wanted a venue where our families and friends could stay.” They chose the 17th-century Villa Cetinale, which Brooke says “has immaculate gardens and beautiful grand interiors, which was the perfect fit.”\n\nSo was the dress Brooke chose, or rather, conceived of herself, with some help: “I really wanted a timeless look that still had a modern edge but would ultimately feel classic. I knew I wanted a fitted silhouette, no embellishments, and a high neck. After searching the bridal salons for months, I realized that I had to design the dress myself, and that’s when I found Mika Inatome.” Brooke brought the designer printouts of vintage dresses she’d been collecting, and as they spoke about ideas, Inatome sketched and, as Brooke says, “the dress I had been dreaming about materialized on the page.” The result was a perfectly fitted, minimal, sleeveless masterpiece. As for hair and makeup, Brooke opted for a “more avant-garde approach,” with curls pinned up with hundreds of bobby pins to show off her statement chandelier earrings and a dramatic smoky eye.\n\nWhen it came time for the actual ceremony, drama came into play once again. The nuptials took place outside at Villa Cetinale, where an over 100-meter-long, tree-lined pathway strewn with multicolored roses and accented with crystal chandeliers served as Brooke and Umut’s aisle. This and the incredible setting for the entire day was conceived by the Italian wedding planning company Sposiamovi. Brooke remembers, “As my father walked me down, I began to see Umut and all of our friends and family seated in this enclosed garden as the band played. The sight of so many loved ones and my soon-to-be husband at the end of this path made me extremely emotional before the exchanging of the vows even started.” The bride’s longtime family friend Judge Alexander officiated the ceremony, and after the official pronouncement of marriage was made, a band played a classical rendition of The Beatles’s “All You Need Is Love.”\n\nOnce the magical nuptials were had, the 120 guests gathered at one long wooden table between the cypress trees for the reception, catered by Galateo Ricevimenti. “With this really organic and lush tablescape of seasonal flowers, fruits, and lots of candlelight, the dinner had a real feeling of intimacy,” Brooke says. “Umut and I moved our seats three times throughout the reception so that we would have a chance to spend time with all of our guests who had traveled so far to celebrate with us.”\n\nAfter dinner, guests followed a path up to a black-and-white outdoor dance floor in the villa’s amphitheater. The newlyweds had a local live band called The Sweet Life Society that specialized in electro-swing music, and the first dance ended up changing course—“It started off very traditionally with ‘Cheek to Cheek,’ which we learned the foxtrot for,” Brooke explains. “Then about a minute in, we switched to Omi’s ‘Cheerleader’ and invited all of our friends and family to join us on the dance floor.” Then things got kind of wild. “Umut loves Burning Man, and so to bring an element of that experience into the wedding, he insisted on a bonfire and fun accessories for all the guests, like feather boas and gold face paint,” Brooke says. “Everyone loved dressing up and really got into the spirit of the party. We also had some cabaret-style cigar girls and a woman serving gelato from a traditional cart.”\n\nAfter partying into the night, the next morning guests were treated to a relaxed “pizza and prosecco” brunch at another garden on the villa’s property. “Umut cooks pizza at home every Sunday,” Brooke says. “So he worked with the pizzaiolo to create a curated menu of his favorite varieties that were made for everyone in a wood-burning oven.” While the stunning Tuscan wedding had come to an end, the brand-new husband-and-wife team were just beginning their celebration. After a few months, they jetted off to a honeymoon in St. Lucia, where they “had a blast.” Some well-deserved R&R for two workaholics who managed to come together while taking care of business."
