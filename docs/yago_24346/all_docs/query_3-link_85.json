I just worry so much in party situations that everyone else is having a good time.\n\n“Our wedding day should just be about us and our boys and family. I just want to keep that feeling throughout. I want to get married for us, not for anyone else.”\n\nThe pair started planning for their wedding right after the actress celebrated her 30th birthday.\n\nThey’ve nearly reached two years since their engagement, and it’s high time they announced the date for their big day.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nVincent and Shay started dating in 2016.\n\nThey are proud parents to their two kids.\n\nVincent Announced Her Engagement On Instagram\n\nThe English former professional soccer player popped the question to Vincent on their sixth-year anniversary on April 17, 2022.\n\nCelebrating their togetherness, they returned to find a beautifully decorated igloo in the garden.\n\nThey enjoyed a luxurious dinner, complete with lasagna prepared by a hired chef.\n\nHowever, it was when she briefly left to fetch a phone charger that the magic unfolded.\n\nUpon her return, her partner was waiting inside the igloo, down on one knee, ready to propose. Overwhelmed by emotion, she joined him on one knee, tears flowing as they exchanged heartfelt sentiments.\n\nHowever, they only made the announcement via Instagram on April 20, 2022.\n\nShe shared a brief video clip featuring a drawing that included the hands of her family members. Notably, one hand stood out with nail polish that had a ring.\n\nTheir engagement came six years after the pair started dating. Brooke and Bryan met each other through their mutual friends.\n\nSince the day they were introduced, they instantly hit it off and formed a close friendship.\n\nAfter a while, Vincent and Shay announced their relationship publicly on social media in 2016.\n\nThey Are Parents To Two Kids\n\nFrom their 8-year-long relationship, Vincent and Kean birthed two kids.\n\nThe pair welcomed a baby boy, Mexx S K Bryan, on October 23, 2019.\n\nSimilarly, another boy named Monroe S J Bryan joined the family on May 4, 2021.\n\nFAQs\n\nIn Which Soccer Club Did Kean Bryan Play For?\n\nKean Bryan played for several English clubs, including Manchester City, Sheffield United, and West Bromwich Albion.\n\nWho Plays Sophie Webster In Coronation Street?\n\nBrooker Vincent plays the character Sophie Webster in Coronation Street."
