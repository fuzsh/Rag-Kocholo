Knight also appeared as Ted Orsini on AMC in 1993.\n\nHis reason for leaving the show was to pursue acting projects on the West Coast, which included a starring role in the feature film Date with an Angel, and various primetime appearances â€” including Murder, She Wrote, Dear John and Grapevine. Knight co-starred in the off-Broadway play Wrong Turn at Lungfish, and he appeared in the ABC movie for television, She Stood Alone: The Tailhook Scandal, and in the off-Broadway Cakewalk, with Linda Lavin.\n\nKnight attended Wesleyan University and graduated in 1980, a year ahead of schedule.Knight was honored with two Daytime Emmy Awards for 'Outstanding Younger Leading Actor' (1986 and 1987). In 2001, he was honored with his third Daytime Emmy Award. He also received the 1997 Soap Opera Digest Award for 'Best Supporting Actor' and a nomination in the same category in 1998.\n\nIn real life, he has been married since June 27, 1992 to One Life to Live's Catherine Hickland."
