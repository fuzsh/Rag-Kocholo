        "text": "Daytime TV has done this alot. Doppelgangers, twins, and actors who played a popular role but that character died so they return to the show as their long lost twin. Some actors even play their main characters split personalities.\n\nDoppelganger: Doppelgangers are characters who look alike but are different people of no relation. Here are some examples…\n\nOn Days of Our Lives Kristan Alfonso played Hope Brady and Princess Gina; Deidre Hall plays Hattie Adams and Marlena Evans. Stacy Haiduk and Eileen Davidson played Kristen Dimera and Susan Banks. Judi Evans played Adrienne Kiriakis and Bonnie Lockhart.\n\nOn AW Joe Barbara was playing Joe Carlino and Jordan Starks; David Andrew Mcdonald was playing David Halliday and Jordan Stark. Stephen Schnetzer played Cass Winthrop and Rex Allingham.\n\nOn GH Tyler Christopher was playing Nikolas Cassadine and Connor Bishop.\n\nOn PC Michael Easton played Father Michael Morley and vampire Stephen Clay. Kelly Monaco played Tess and Livvie Locke.\n\nOn Y&R Peter Bergman played Jack Abott and Marco. Michelle Stafford played Phyllis Newman and Shelia Carter. Tracey E. Bergman played Lauren Baldwin and Sarah Smythe.\n\nOn ATWT Jennifer Landon played Gwen Norbeck and Cleo Babbit.\n\nOn AMC Michael E. Knight played Tad Martin and Ted Orsini. Susan Lucci played Erica and Jane.\n\nTwins: Same actor playing twin siblings… at the same time\n\nAMC: Kate Collins played Natalie and Janet Marlowe. David Canary played Adam and Stuart Chandler. Ellen Wheeler played Karen and Cindy Parker. Finola Hughes played Alex Devane and Anna Devane.\n\nAW: Ellen Wheeler, Anne Heche, and Jensen Buchanan all played Vicky and Marley Hudson.\n\nATWT: Martha Byrne played Lily Snyder and Rose D’Angelo. Although not twins Julianne Moore played siblings Frannie and Sabrina Hughes.\n\nB&B: Adrienne Frantz played Amber Moore and April Knight. Brandon Beemer played Owen Knight and Casper.\n\nY&R: Daniel Goodard played Cane and Caleb Atkinson. Michael Tylo played Rick and Blade Bladeson.\n\nGH: Jon Lindstrom plays Kevin Collins and Ryan Chamberlain.\n\nDays: Deidre Hall played Marlena and Samatha (Samantha was originally played by Andrea Hall) in 92. Eileen Davidson and Stacy Haiduk played the Banks family. Davidson played siblings Susan, Thomas, Sister Mary Moira, and Penelope. Haiduk has played Susan and Sister Mary Moira. David Shaughnessy played Shane and Andrew Donovan.\n\nOLTL: Gerald Anthony played Marco Dane and Mario Corelli.\n\nActors who got fired and came back and played their dead characters twin:\n\nAMC: Elizabeth Hendrickson played Maggie and Frankie Stone. Francesca James played Kelly and Kitty Cole.\n\nGH: Natalia Livingston played Emily Quartermine then later on started playing Rebecca Shaw.\n\nY&R: Camryn grimes played Cassie Newman then some years later Mariah Copeland.\n\nDays: Brandon Barash played Jake and Stefan Dimera.\n\nGL: Vincent Irizarry played Brandon Luvonaczeck and later played his long lost twin Nick McHenry.\n\nActors who played their main characters split personality:\n\nGH: Anthony Geary played Luke Spencer and Fluke. Kelly Sullivan played Kate and Connie.\n\nOLTL: Erika Slezak played Viki Lord and her band of alters….Niki Smith, Jean Randolph,Tommy, Tori, Princess, and Victor. Onscreen daughter Jessica Tuck played Megan Gordon and Ruby Bright.

Patsy Pease played Kimberly Brady Donavan and her alters Lacey and Claire.\n\nSB: Marcy walker played Eden Capwell Castillo and Suzanne Collier and Lisa, even her dead brother Channing.\n\nOn AW Robert Kelker Kelly’s Shane Roberts threw me for a loop. I don’t know if he was really Shane Roberts or Bobby Reno. That always got me.\n\nIf I forgot anyone yall let me know. This is all I can remember lol\n\nThis topic was modified 1 year, 4 months ago by Ardejah Cat Harbin.\n\nThis topic was modified 1 year, 4 months ago by Ardejah Cat Harbin.\n\nThis topic was modified 1 year, 4 months ago by Ardejah Cat Harbin.\n\nThis topic was modified 1 year, 4 months ago by Ardejah Cat Harbin.\n\nI believe you have 2 examples which are “identical cousins” or “identical first cousins” & they would be AMC’s Cindy & Karen Parker played by Ellen Wheeler and on ATWT played by Julianne Moore, Frannie & Sabrina.\n\nI was wrong. Cindy & Karen were twins.\n\nCass Winthrop had an evil twin. Rex.\n\nDid you list Charles Shaughnessy’s Shane & Andrew Donovan? Andrew even showed up on BS2 last year.\n\nI don’t think RKK is an example. He was a character named Bobby Reno & then later he was a character Shane Roberts where Michael Malone wrote some of the 13 BOURBON STREET show bible into AW. And, in a reverse move, 3 different actors played Sam Folwer & each one played him a different way. Artist Sam, country music Sam, etc. And, would you include Mary Beth Evans & Steve Patch Johnson and Emily & Gideon?\n\nBelieve it or not Emily & Gideon was mentioned in the show this morning!\n\nI thought of a related instance on OLTL. Larry Wolek was played by two Storm brothers IRL!\n\nOn ATWT Kim Hughes & Jennifer Hughes were sisters & cousins, right?\n\nVery interesting.\n\n⌨️ Editing is my superpower. 🦦 My Patronus is an Otter! Unapologetic Soap Opera Fan 📺\n\nThis is a great list! I thought that on Another World, Robert Kelker-Kelly originally played Sam Fowler, but then came back years later as carpenter/handyman Bobby Reno, who was eventually revealed to actually be Shane Roberts, a doctor. Bobby/Shane were the same person, but I don’t think he had any resemblance/connection to Sam. We’re only listing characters who actually look alike, right? So the recent examples of Michael Easton and Roger Howarth on GH wouldn’t count.\n\nAnother confusing situation: Thaao Penghlis playing Tony and Andre DiMera on DAYS. It’s my understanding that Tony and Andre were originally cousins. Andre got plastic surgery to look exactly like Tony, and over the years they have gone back and forth about whether either or both of them was Stefano’s biological child. I think ultimately they’ve both turned out to be Stefano’s biological sons, though born to different mothers, so they would be brothers but not twins.\n\nSome of these people I totally did not remember having any sort of double, like Joe Carlino on AW. I also don’t remember a lot of these stories that well. I thought Tess and Livvie on PC were the same person, but Tess was just the vampire persona.\n\nThis is a great list!

Some of these people I totally did not remember having any sort of double, like Joe Carlino on AW. …\n\nI also have no memory of Joe Barbara playing anyone but Joe Carlino.\n\nRKK was the original Sam Fowler, who romanced Amanda & who was the father of Ally & who was a painter. Sam had no relationship to either Bobby Reno or Dr. Shane Roberts. Bobby had Ryan’s corneas, so he had a relationship to Ryan Harrison. I never thought Bobby & Shane were one person. Bobby had been a race car driver & had had a fiery accident & had to have his corneas replaced. That was supposed to set him up romantically for Vicky.\n\nThe Andre/Tony combined retcon is the most confusing retcon on DOOL except for John Black. Basically different HWs kept changing the backstory. Initially Tony was Stefano’s bio child & Andre was a cousin who resembled him, who had plastic surgery to enhance that resemblance & take over Tony’s life. Then they changed it & said that Tony’s bio-father was the gardener! Now it seems Tony is a bio-child again. There were times when it made sense, by Salem terms & times when it made no sense!\n\nAnd I told Cat that he got so many right!!! What a list!\n\n⌨️ Editing is my superpower. 🦦 My Patronus is an Otter! Unapologetic Soap Opera Fan 📺\n\nThis is a great list!

It had something to do with Jordan coming to bay city to find his lover Amelia who resembled Amanda Corey. Jordan was from the year 1778.\n\nI didn’t wanna mention Kelly playing Sam cause they were different characters played by the same actor at different times. I put the whole bobby/Shane scenario by itself because I was always confused by which role he was playing lol.\n\nI always knew Andre and Tony were brothers who were then turned into cousins then later brothers again.\n\nI agree that DOOL’s Andre/Tony thing has been the most confusing one. I still don’t understand who it was that shot himself to frame John for murder in Aremid (remember that bookstand contraption that he used to shoot himself?). It was Tony at the time, but I have no idea if it was actually him.\n\nYou’re right, at the time it was Tony, but then all of Tony’s actions in the 90s and early 2000s were retconned to have been Andre. All of the manipulating Tony did with Kristen to be with her and keep her away from John, including pretending to be blind and setting up that bookstand shooting device to kill himself and frame John, and all of Tony’s shenanigans with making everyone, including Marlena, believe that Marlena was the serial killer in 2003/2004 in the story that ended with half the characters in Melaswen, were ultimately revealed to have been Andre rather than Tony. Around 2007/8, when Leann Hunley returned to the show as Anna, she insisted that her Tony would never do all of the horrible things everyone was claiming he’d done, and eventually they found Tony on a DiMera island, where he’d been stranded with regular supply drops, for 20 or so years. As confusing as it was, I think this was a good retcon because it restored Tony’s character to the good person he had been after the rampant character assassination he’d been put through for various storylines. I don’t think it was too long after this that Tony got into a heated argument with Phillip at the pier. Phillip pushed Tony, and he ended up impaled on a piece of wood. This killed Tony, setting up the DiMera-Kiriakis war wherein both Phillip and Chad were shot and nearly killed and leaving Anna to carry around an urn full of ashes for a decade or so. Tony was “dead” until it was revealed that he had been one of the numerous deceased Salemites that Kristen and Dr. Rolf had revived and were keeping in a warehouse. Currently, Andre is dead and Tony is alive. At this point, I think generally if something that was done was villainous, it was Andre, and if it was virtuous, it was Tony.\n\nRegarding Shane Roberts and Bobby Reno, it was decades ago now, but I’m 99.9% sure they were the same person. For some reason, Shane had changed his name and taken on the Bobby Reno persona. I do remember the bit about Bobby having been blind and getting Ryan’s corneas. There was a Bobby/Vicky/Jake triangle, which shifted when it was revealed that Bobby Reno was actually Shane Roberts and had a wife, Lila Roberts (Lisa Peluso), who I think had maybe been in a coma or something? I think Jake dug up this information in his efforts to get rid of Bobby. Lila kind of had Michelle Stafford-Nina Clay vibes, a charming and vulnerable veneer hiding something deeply unhinged. She wanted her husband back, but he had moved on. Lila and Jake teamed up to split up Vicky and Shane, and I think they succeeded. Jake and Vicky of course ended up together. I want to say Shane eventually died somehow? And Lila ended up with Cass Winthrop. I think the show ended with their wedding.\n\nYou’re right, at the time it was Tony, but then all of Tony’s actions in the 90s and early 2000s were retconned to have been Andre.

I think the show ended with their wedding.\n\nYes, the show killed off Michael Hudson & Shane Roberts in pretty quick succession. Lila Roberts had a backstory where she was terrified of storms & she was something of a fragile Southern belle or like Laura in The Glass Menagerie. Shane & Lila were characters out of 13 Bourbon Street, the soap that Michael Malone & Josh Griffith & EP Linda Gottlieb had done. A pilot was even cast & shot & then the greenlight was dropped. Lila dated both Matt & Cass but ended up with Cass & their wedding was Day One of the two day finale. She also gave birth to baby Jasmine in a stuck elevator. Alice Barrett as the ghost of Frankie was able to get across to Cass & to Charlie that it was okay to move forward. Most of the time Alice Barrett was Ann McDonald.\n\nMaybe Michael & Shane died in the same terrible car accident. I struggle to recall.\n\nTony & Andre: No matter how wild it was getting here, we are at a stable point. Andre is dead. Tony is good. Whatever is bad now automatically accrues to Andre. Whatever good, to Tony. Tony is also probably the DiMera most concerned with things like family unity.\n\n⌨️ Editing is my superpower. 🦦 My Patronus is an Otter! Unapologetic Soap Opera Fan 📺"
