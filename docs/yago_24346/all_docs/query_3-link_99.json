It's also unclear whether Brooke's dad attended their second ceremony.\n\nBut in September, Brooke took to social media to explain that she was putting some \"distance\" between herself and her dad, after she didn’t attend his third wedding.\n\nIn response to speculation about her relationship with her dad, Brooke wrote on Instagram at the time: \"As we all experience this with our own families, the dynamics of a family unit continuously change over the years.\n\n\"With that being said, my family has experienced a LOT of change. With all of it happening in the public eye, I’ve had to learn how to best navigate those changes as they come, which has been difficult to say the least.\n\n\"For my own journey to healing and happiness, I have chosen to create some distance between myself and my family, and am focusing on people and things that heal my heart and align with my own personal beliefs, goals, and values.\n\n\"I wish him well. (sic)\""
