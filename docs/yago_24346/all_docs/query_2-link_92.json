        "text": "Walt Willey is coming to General Hospital as his All My Children character Jackson Montgomery. GH and AMC fans are thrilled!\n\nABC daytime watchers will remember attorney Jackson Montgomery as Erica Kane’s (Susan Lucci) longtime love on All My Children. When the soap went off the air in 2011, Jackson left Erica with the line, “Frankly, Erica, I don’t give a damn what you need.” She was running after him when J.R. Chandler (Jacob Young) fired a gun, which ended the much-loved series.\n\nJackson and Erica were both very much alive in the 2013 reboot. Jackson Montgomery will soon be arriving on GH and someone will need his legal services.\n\nWalt Willey is not the first actor to make the jump from All My Children to General Hospital. Other former faces of Pine Valley have taken up residence in Port Charles.\n\nAMC’s Tad Martin is now Martin Grey on General Hospital\n\nWho could forget Tad “The Cad” Martin played by Michael E. Knight? The infamous character dated Liza Colby (Marcy Walker) and had an affair with her mother Marian Colby (Jennifer Bassey).\n\nTad was redeemed when he fell in love with Dixie Cooney (Cady McClain). The couple is said to be one of the greatest in soap opera history.\n\nKnight returned to the ABC soap world when he arrived on General Hospital as attorney Martin Grey. Martin turned out to be the long-lost brother of GH legend Laura Collins (Genie Francis). He is also one half of a great pairing with Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring).\n\nKim Delaney played Jenny Gardner and Jackie Templeton\n\nJenny Gardner was Tad Martin’s sister on All My Children. Jenny and Greg Nelson (Lawrence Lau) were another legendary young couple on the long-running soap.\n\nUnfortunately, Jenny died in a jet ski accident at just 20 years old.\n\nKim Delaney went on to star in primetime TV with NYPD Blue and Army Wives. In 2020 she came to General Hospital to reprise the role of Jackie Templeton, originally played by Demi Moore in the 1980s.\n\nThe ex-brother and sister gave All My Children fans a laugh when the two met for the first time on GH. Jackie looked at Martin and said, “Do I know you?”\n\nAMC’s Greenlee Smythe Lavery and GH’s Hayden Barnes both played by Rebecca Budig\n\nGreenlee Smythe was a rich debutante on AMC who had eyes for Ryan Lavery (Cameron Mathison).\n\nShe later fell for Leo Du Pres (Josh Duhamel) and the two became a super couple. Poor Leo met an untimely death when he dove over Miller’s Falls. Eventually, Greenlee and Ryan did fall in love.\n\nHayden Barnes arrived on General Hospital as the woman pretending to be married to Jake Doe (Billy Miller). She turned out to be the half-sister of Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst) who was conceived when Liz’s dad had an affair with Hayden’s mom.\n\nShe left Dr. Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton) at the altar. She left town, had their daughter, Violet, returned years later, and then left again, leaving Violet with Finn.\n\nRyan Lavery is now in Port Charles as Drew Cain\n\nRyan Lavery was a much-loved character on All My Children. He came to Pine Valley as a con artist but turned out to be one of the good guys. His love affair and marriage to Gillian Andrassy Lavery (Esta TerBlanche) unfortunately ended with her untimely death.\n\nThe soap ended when Ryan confessed his love to Greenlee after a long and sometimes tumultuous relationship.\n\nCameron Mathison came to Port Charles as the new Drew Cain, who was thought to be dead but really had been held prisoner for years. Drew is a former Navy Seal and the long-lost twin of Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), which makes him a Quartermaine. He is currently involved with Carly Spencer (Laura Wright)."
