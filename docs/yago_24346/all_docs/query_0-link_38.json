You might want to save it to a file for reference, since it's only posted once every couple of months. The AMC FAQ is also available through anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu under /pub/usenet/news.answers/tv/soaps/all-my-c/ or send email to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with any or all of: send usenet/news.answers/tv/soaps/all-my-c/general send usenet/news.answers/tv/soaps/all-my-c/actors send usenet/news.answers/tv/soaps/all-my-c/characters send usenet/news.answers/tv/soaps/all-my-c/ratsa-newsgroup If you know any of the unknown answers below, or have any additional questions & answers to add, please email me (gibbsm@ll.mit.edu). Thanks! (part 4 of 4) general questions about r.a.t.s.: Q: Do the soap writers/actors read rec.arts.tv.soaps? Q: What is the AMC birthday/pigday list? Q: What's the deal with \"pigday\"? Q: What is the AMC r.a.t.s. yearbook? Q: AMC-specific acronyms which aren't listed in the RATS-FAQ Q: What can I do to make this FAQ better? Q: Do the soap writers/actors read rec.arts.tv.soaps.*? A: The answer to this is contained in the rec.arts.tv.soaps FAQ. It is available through anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu under /pub/usenet/news.answers/tv/soaps/faq, or send email to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \"send /pub/usenet/news.answers/tv/soaps/faq\" (no quotes) in the body of the message. Q: What is the AMC birthday/pigday list? A: The AMC birthday (a/k/a pigday) list is a monthly informational posting of birthdays of AMC fans that read rec.arts.tv.soaps and their families. It includes birthdates, names, and email addresses. At one point in time, many of the AMC ratsers starting sharing personal information, including birthdays. Soon after that, Mary Allison started posting the birthday list every month. As more people read the list, more people asked to be added to the list. The pigday list is currently maintained by Cathy Sands (catherine.sands@gtri.gatech.edu). If you wish to have your birthday listed, send email to the list maintainer. You may be surprised by many pleasant good wishes on your birthday. Q: What's the deal with \"pigday\"? A: When Timmy Hunter Dillon was feeling very sad and missing his mother he thought about getting rid of everything that reminded him of his mom. Laurel Banning (an older friend of Timmy) showed him a birthday card that her deceased mother had send her on her 12th(?) birthday. Laurel's mother's handwriting was sooo bad, that it LOOKED like the card read \"happy pigday.\" Q: What is the AMC r.a.t.s. yearbook? A: Starting in 1992, AMC r.a.t.s. readers decided to make a yearbook including short bios of the readers along with their pictures. The editors get color photocopies made of the pictures, print up the blurbs on a Mac, paste the pictures to the blurb pages, put them in a binder, and send the \"yearbook\" to the participants. Also included in the yearbook are photos of AMC get-togethers, creative work done by the participants relating to AMC, and candid photos of the actors/actresses. We've even had autographed pictures in the more recent yearbook, plus a picture of an autographed script. Because of the work involved, the yearbook may not come out every year, and its format has changed slightly to be more easily produced. There are still a few black-and-white copies of the 1993 yearbook & a couple of color copies of the 1994 yearbook available - email gibbsm@ll.mit.edu for details. There is also one color copy of the 1996 yearbook available - contact karind@timberline.com Regrettably there was no 1997 or 1998 yearbook. No plans have currently been made for a 1999 one. Q: AMC-specific acronyms which aren't listed in the RATS-FAQ A: AFAC: Anti-FAC (see FAC) BABE: Banding Against Brooke English BL&P: Brooke Lover & Proud CYBW: Creepy Yucky Bobby Warner DADD: Dumb-as-dirt Dixie DDS: Dependant Doormat Syndrome (when affecting women) and Dudley Do-Right Syndrome (when affecting men)! FAC: Favorite AMC Character IH*C: I Hate (name of character here) Club LCAS: Liza Colby Admiration Society PVGD: Pine Valley Glandular/Growth Disorder PVTS: Pine Valley Transporter System SPERM: Society for the Prevention of Emnity towards Repentant Moms (regarding Marion, Arlene, Vivienne, Janet, etc.) TBM: Totally Bogus Moment TSS: Taylor/Taylips Smacking Squad Q: What can I do to make this FAQ better? A: Send additions/suggestions/corrections to gibbsm@ll.mit.edu. I've also seen some AMC posts which I think would fit nicely as FAQ's, such as Dave Mackey's character list, or Laurel Cheap's nicknames list (Laurel - you haven't posted it in a while... I know you have 2 kids now, but come on! :-)). Dave Vollman is posting a soap opera laws list every few months, too. Is anyone interested in compiling a list of characters and who they've been involved with over time, with resulting children in parentheses? For example (M=married): Brooke: M-Tom Cudahy (Laura-deceased), Jackson Montgomery, Tad Martin (Jamie), Edmund Gray, M-Tad Martin Acknowledgements: Carolyn Zaccaria, Frances Yasprica, Mary Allison Wu, Erin Winslow, Mindy Wallis, Dave Vollman, Jann E VanOver, Maureen Vahey, Jennifer Allyson Turner, Christy Thierstein, Janet Tilander, Sharon L.
