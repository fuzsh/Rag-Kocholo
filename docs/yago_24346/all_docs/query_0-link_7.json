        "text": "Edmund Grey came to Pine Valley in 1992 and met Brooke English shortly after arriving. It was love at first sight for both of them. They began a tumultuous relationship which was on-again, off-again until Brooke married Tad Martin. Edmund moved on and married Maria Santos.\n\nMaria was killed in a plane crash in 1997 and Brooke and Edmund always remained close friends, as well as business partners. In September, 2001, Brooke and Edmund realized they were still in love and got back together.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, 2002, Edmund proposed to Brooke (see pictures) and this time they married (see pictures). Their marriage was short-lived when Maria returned from the dead on their wedding day.\n\nBrooke and Edmund were an extremely popular couple."
