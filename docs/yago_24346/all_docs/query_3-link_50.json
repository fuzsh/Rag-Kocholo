Neriah was supposed to be on tour. We finished building our home in Arizona ...\n\n\"We didn't have a minute to breathe, let alone plan the greatest party of our life. So back to the drawing board, and now we need to get really busy.\"\n\nScott added they don't want to rush the wedding so they would rather wait until they can plan it properly: \"I think for us, it's having the experience. I mean, the whole reason to do it, too, is for the kids and for us and the family.\n\n\"So we want to do it right. We just don't want to rush into it ... I said we could always go get married on a weekend or plan something quick, but we want to just do it right.\"\n\nBrooke previously admitted she has decided not to wear white on her big day after sporting the colour for her two previous trips down the aisle.\n\nShe told DailyMail.com: \"I already did white. I might be a bit daring as I am looking at fun colours.\n\n\"I was thinking more of a nude tone, I am really into nude tones these days, they are so elegant.\""
