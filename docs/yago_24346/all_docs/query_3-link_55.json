        "text": "I am excited to join the Woodmen Hills Elementary School family as the English Language Development teacher. On a personal note, I am a Colorado native married to my high school sweetheart. We have two beautiful daughters that keep us busy! Some of our family's greatest joys include watching an exciting game of hockey or relaxing on the paddle boards and kayaks at a mountain lake. My husband and I also love the textures in Colorado for photography. During the summers, my husband and I photograph weddings and high school seniors.\n\nHaving been an educator for over a decade, I love the challenge of meeting each child where they are and helping them succeed beyond levels they ever thought possible. I am honored to work with students that are culturally and linguistically diverse. Our ELD program offers opportunities for intensive English instruction in small groups, push-in with classrooms for additional support, as well as co-teaching experiences. In all situations, our goal is to develop the four domains of language: Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing among all content areas. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your child's educational experience."
