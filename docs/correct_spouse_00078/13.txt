The Hannah Waterman baby-news story has taken another twist today, with the WIFE of Huw Higginson (the father of Hannah's unborn baby) reportedly planning to flee the country over Hannah and Huw's relationship.

Geraldine Dove-Higginson, 45, - Huw's wife of 14 years, and with whom she has a daughter, Megan, nine, - wrote on her On Friends Reunited page: 'will shortly be emigrating to Australia with my family at the end of the year'.

The Daily Mail reports a 'distraught' Mrs Dove-Higginson - who also has a 15-year-old daughter from a previous relationship - was finding the news all 'too difficult' to cope with.

'It's a tough time at the moment and my priority is my two children and my work. I just want to wish Hannah and Huw all the best for the future. I don't really want to talk any further as it's too difficult,' she said.

Hannah, 35, is six-months pregnant with Huw's baby. She recently told a magazine that she and Huw entered into a relationship last year, when, because of difficulties at home, he moved into her property. Their friendship then blossomed into romance.

Hannah was previously married to her EastEnders co-star Ricky Groves. They split in 2009.

What do you think about this story?

Is it just a fact of life that couples split and form new relationships? Or do you think people should formally separate or divorce before starting a new family?

Have you been in either Hannah or Geraldine's shoes?
