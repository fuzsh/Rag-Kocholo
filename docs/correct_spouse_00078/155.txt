Who is Hannah Waterman?

An actor currently appearing in Summer of Harold at the Ensemble.

What would you do differently from what you do now?

As a child, I wanted to be a vet, but I was rubbish at science. I come from a family of actors, so it was perhaps inevitable.

Who inspires you and why?

My 12 year old son who is learning to navigate the world with bravery and humour.

What would you do to make a difference in the world?

I would like all children in our world to be safe and fed.

Favourite holiday destination and why?

Our last proper holiday as a family was to Fiji. I’m yearning to go back and relax.

When friends come to town, what attraction would you take them to, and why?

We live in the inner west and I love the view from the Anzac Bridge towards the Opera House.

What are you currently reading?

Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver is next on my list. Before rehearsals I read Horse by Geraldine Brooks.

What are you currently listening to?

Every Sunday evening my husband and I listen to The Archers – a radio soap set in rural U.K. A little taste of home.

Happiness is?

Being at home with my family.

What does the future hold for you?

Well I know for sure that I shall be returning to the Ensemble with my husband Huw Higginson to do the British play, Colder Than Here by Laura Wade.

Hannah can be seen in Summer of Harold by Hilary Bell – which is currently playing at the Ensemble Theatre until 14 October 2023. For more information, visit: www.ensemble.com.au for details.
