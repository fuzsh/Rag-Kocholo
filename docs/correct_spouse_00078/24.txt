Ricky Groves has admitted that he has finally come to terms with his split from wife Hannah Waterman.

The former EastEnders stars, who played Walford's Garry Hobbs and Laura Beale, announced their break-up in January after three years of marriage.

Speaking in a new interview with Hello magazine, Groves confessed that he now understands why Waterman chose to end their relationship.

The 42-year-old explained: "It pains me to say it but at the time it was a real jolt, the worst thing that had ever happened to me. But I've had time to think about it and, as sad as it is, maybe our relationship had become routine and we had grown apart.

"I think I'd just been putting things off, telling myself it would be all right, but then it got to the stage where it wasn't all right anymore."

Groves added that he is back on good terms with Waterman and believes they will "always remain friends".
