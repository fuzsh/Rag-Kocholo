        "text": "Former EastEnders star Hannah Waterman has had her fair share of battles, one of which saw her fighting for life during her pregnancy.\n\nBut two years on and the daughter of Minder actor Dennis Waterman is back fighting fit and tackling one of the biggest challenges of her life in a starring role in Mike Leigh’s classic comedy Abigail’s Party.\n\nIn 2009 Hannah was at the centre of a weight controversy after she shed three stone in just five months and brought out a fitness DVD.\n\nWhen her weight plummeted to just a few pounds above 7st, her concerned personal trainer stopped her exercising so hard.\n\nThere was also some speculation that her appearance was down to the strain of the break-up of her marriage to EastEnders co-star Ricky Groves.\n\nIn fact, Hannah – best known for playing Laura Beale on the soap – was suffering from the life-threatening complications of type 1 diabetes. She was finally diagnosed in 2011 while on holiday in Australia and 24 weeks pregnant with her son Jack.\n\nShe may have been unknowingly suffering from the incurable auto-immune disease for months or even years.\n\nShe told the Irish Mirror: “I was really ill when I was pregnant and now I have a bit more respect for my body. Your priorities change. I was 7st 8lb when I did that DVD I’m now between 8st and 8 and a half. I had an emergency caesarean. It took a little while to get back on track. And now I just think do I need my hip bones and ribs to be showing? Not really.\n\n“When I was ill and pregnant you could see my ribs and hip bones and that was not good. I went into this DKA thing, a diabetic condition it’s very serious.\n\n“When I see pictures of myself pregnant and look so drawn and thin it just makes you think ‘OK, if I weigh half a stone more I’ll always look a hell of a lot better and be healthy.’\n\nHannah, 38, said her health scare and her baby has made her give up on her quest to be a size zero.\n\n“I’m not as extreme. I don’t have the time for an hour and a half training a day.\n\n“I haven’t been to the gym in two weeks but I haven’t beaten myself up about it. It’s not the end of the world.” Following her dramatic weight-loss at the time, which saw her shrink from a size 16 to a 6, she released a DVD Hannah Waterman’s Body Blitz.\n\nShe was criticised at the time by her former Walford co-star Natalie Cassidy for “going too far with weight loss” while TV presenter Coleen Nolan branded her regime techniques “unhealthy” and “unrealistic.”\n\nBut those days are behind her now.\n\nHannah said: “I never watch my DVD but my son thinks it’s hysterically funny.\n\n“First of all he doesn’t recognise the fat woman on the cover.”\n\nThe Londoner is currently in a relationship with Jack’s father, former The Bill star Huw Higginson.\n\nThe pair began dating in 2010 after the actor reportedly left the mother of his two children after 14 year of marriage.\n\nHannah, who left EastEnders almost 10 years ago, is juggling her career with motherhood, which she said is “the best thing I’ve ever done.” And she said she doesn’t miss her role on the BBC show which made her famous.\n\nShe recalled” “The audience figures when I was in it was in the 20 millions now the whole thing has changed.\n\n“I left in 2004, almost 10 years ago. It’s amazing that people still recognise you from that time. I had a great time there but I don’t miss it.\n\n“I don’t think any show would get those viewing figures now. I think the thing is now everyone wants to be in Broadchurch or something like that.\n\n“If I was in Downton Abbey, I’d definitely be downstairs. I’ve got that kind of face, the well- worn look.\n\n“In my youth when I started out I did costume dramas quite a bit but I haven’t done one in a long time.”\n\nSince leaving Albert Square, Hannah has worked extensively in theatre in Carrie’s War, Rattle of a Simple Man, Calendar Girls and most recently The Winslow Boy.\n\nShe’s also returned to TV series Doctors as DI Collier.\n\nAnd following a triumphant UK tour, Abigail’s Party is coming to Dublin’s Gaiety Theatre next month with Hannah playing Beverly. She said: “This is one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my life. Mike Leigh’s written a wonderful piece of theatre which is a joy to play.\n\n“However, it’s difficult not to be aware of Alison Steadman’s contribution as she created Beverley and you want to get the timings right for the laughs.\n\n“This is the first theatre project since having my baby, and part of the challenge was learning it as it’s a bit of a beast.”\n\nShe added: “It’s not to everyone’s taste but, not to sound like a w*****, it’s art, it’s a subjective thing.”\n\nSo what does the future hold in store for the actress?\n\n“I am a huge fan of Mike Leigh and I’d love to work with him, me and Eva Mendes, apparently.\n\n“He sent us a magnum of champagne when we opened so I don’t think he’s seen it yet.\n\n“He’s so busy that even Eva Mendes can’t get hold of him. But that would be the dream.”\n\n- Abigail’s Party is at Dublin’s Gaiety Theatre June 10 to 15. Tickets are priced from €28.50."
