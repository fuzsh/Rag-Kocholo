        "text": "NEW Year’s Eve is meant to be a time of laughter and celebrations – but it only holds painful memories for Ricky Groves.\n\nFour years ago, the former EastEnders star was left nursing a broken heart when his wife Hannah Waterman suddenly walked out on him.\n\nOn the eve of 2010 she dropped the bombshell that she had had an affair and was leaving him.\n\nHannah, 38, has since set up home with ex-Bill actor Huw Higginson, 49, and had their baby son in June.\n\nRicky was left at his lowest ever point. But now, for the first time since that night, he is no longer dreading seeing in the New Year.\n\nSince finding love again with entrepreneur Kay Russell he is keen to move on and put the past behind him. The only problem is, his efforts to finalise his split with Hannah have hit a brick wall.\n\nRicky, 45, tells The Sun on Sunday: “I can’t understand it. After all, it was her idea to end our marriage.\n\n“Every time I’ve rung her the phone has been on but she’s not answered. I’ve left messages, sent texts but got no reply.\n\n“You would have thought she would be keen to get a divorce, especially now she’s had a baby.”\n\nRicky, who will compete in ITV diving show Splash! from Saturday, has seen Hannah only twice since they split. He believes she is in Australia.\n\nHe adds: “It’s sad because we were together for ten years. Recently I texted her that our dog Ernie, who I was looking after, had died. I didn’t even get a response to that.”\n\nHe refuses to turn to Hannah’s dad, former Minder and Sweeney star Dennis Waterman, 65, in his efforts to track down his estranged wife.\n\nRicky says: “It’s not fair to bring him into this. It’s a private matter.\n\n“Hannah was on tour in England earlier this year and I tried to contact her then but couldn’t.\n\n“I still get her post but I’ve no forwarding address.”\n\nHe met Hannah on the BBC1 soap in 2000, when he played mechanic Garry Hobbs and she was Laura Beale. They dated for six years before tying the knot in September 2006. But just over three years later Hannah called time on their marriage — leaving Ricky distraught.\n\nHe says: “It took me a long, long time to get over what happened. It was the lowest I’ve ever been.\n\n“It was the clinical way it was done. I wish she had let me down gently but I suppose there is no easy way to leave someone.\n\n“Our break-up hit me hard because I took my vows very seriously. My parents celebrated their golden anniversary this year and I always saw marriage as\n\nbeing for life. But as Mum said to me, ‘You had ten good years’ and that’s how I see it too.\n\n“I’m not bitter. Mind you, I’d always disliked New Year’s Eve. I dislike it even more now. This time of year brings back all those memories. But I’m not moping around the house on my own any more.”\n\nAt first Ricky blamed the break-up on Hannah’s “obsession” with her incredible weight loss. Making her Body Blitz DVD helped her drop three stone. But now he admits: “There was a lot more wrong with our marriage than that.\n\n“I don’t think being married to someone in the same profession is a great idea. Actors can be demanding and it gets difficult when one of you is doing well and the other isn’t.\n\n“Hannah was also touring a lot, which is how she met Huw. You look back and think, ‘What did I do wrong?’ Maybe it was my fault. But I’m in a much better place now.”\n\nAfter the split Ricky was terrified of getting hurt again. He turned down offers from younger women, saying: “That’s just not me.” Then, in July this year, he met horse breeder Kay, 50, at a Lord’s Taverners charity event. Kay, from Bridport, Dorset, appeared on TV’s Dragons’ Den in 2009 showcasing her products Equi-N-ice and Physicool — cooling bandages for horses and humans. Dragon Deborah Meaden offered to invest £100,000, but Kay chose to go it alone.\n\nRicky says of Kay: “I liked her the first time we met. She’s very independent, caring and good fun. I felt like I wanted to commit this time because, at 45, I didn’t want to be on my own any more and I didn’t want to lose Kay.\n\n“She’s a bit older than me, which I like. We have the perfect relationship — she has her life and a place in Dorset and I have mine in Essex and we meet when we can.\n\n“It’s good that she has nothing to do with my profession. I never want to have that showbiz couple thing again.\n\n“Kay and I talk about all sorts. She’s even got me involved in her business.\n\n“We went to Spain this year and I was testing new products for her. And she’s teaching me to ride properly. We don’t live in each other’s pockets. We’re just taking it as it comes.”\n\nRicky is currently playing Silly Billy in the panto Beauty & The Beast at the Cresset Theatre in Peterborough.\n\nOnce the show ends its run on Monday, he will resume training for Splash!, which is hosted by diving champion Tom Daley.\n\nHe says: “I like learning something different, which is why I did Strictly Come Dancing in 2009 when I was thrilled to get to week ten. With Splash! it’s more about facing my fears. Diving is the hardest sport I have ever done, and that includes skiing and snowboarding. When you look down over the edge of the board. it’s terrifying.\n\n“My admiration for Tom Daley has gone through the roof. People just don’t appreciate how brave he is.\n\n“He was doing all these spectacular dives the other day and the crew said, ‘Oh, that’s just Tom warming up.’ I haven’t even got to the highest board yet.”\n\nRicky has already done some training — and suffered the odd excruciating mishap. He reveals: “The other day I hit my ‘knacker fat’ — that little bulge just above your bits.\n\n“God, it was painful! If you hit the water the wrong way, you know about it.”\n\nRicky is also keen on a return to EastEnders, saying: “I miss the cast and crew, the camaraderie.\n\n“It was a great place to work and I’d love to go back.”\n\nAlthough he spent Christmas with Kay, he plans to stay in on his own for New Year.\n\nBut he insists: “It isn’t because of Hannah any more. I wish her luck. But I also wish she would do the decent thing and respond.\n\n“I want to get divorced. Then I can get on with my life, like she has with hers.”\n\nA representative for Hannah Waterman said last night: “We have no interest in making any comment.”"
