I’m 35 and I didn’t want to wait around because, as everyone knows, it can be harder to conceive as you get older. But we didn’t expect it to happen so quickly.”\n\nThe starlet also revealed that the pregnancy may have saved her life, as it led her to discovering she has diabetes.\n\nHannah said: “I was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which was triggered by pregnancy hormones. It’s very unusual and can be very dangerous, which means this baby will probably be the only child I can have.\n\n“Although the pregnancy triggered my diabetes symptoms, I would have developed them at some point, so at least it meant I was diagnosed earlier – it probably saved my life.”\n\nHere at MFM HQ we wonder whether the baby will grow up to be an East End cheeky chappy or an officer of the law?\n\nRead more…"
