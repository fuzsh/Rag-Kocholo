        "text": "HANNAH Waterman has been grabbing plenty of headlines of late. But, in these image-obsessed times, it’s been her weight rather than her acting that’s been the talking point.\n\nThe former EastEnders actress was snapped wearing a bikini on the beach in Portugal recently and the unflattering image led to people asking if she was pregnant.\n\nHannah joked that it was a “cheese and wine baby”, but the photograph obviously touched a nerve as it spurred her into action.\n\nSince then, the daughter of Sweeney and Minder legend Dennis, has been working out with a personal trainer and she’s shedding the extra inches around her stomach.\n\n“I was out running this morning – I love it,” she tells says. “It’s been great. It’s working. The weight is still coming off. I’ve got a great trainer who I’ve been working out with who gives me fantastic advice. But it’s hard to be disciplined when you’re on the road.”\n\nHannah is currently touring in the stage play, Rattle Of A Simple Man. It opens in Wales next week as part of Swansea Grand Theatre’s summer repertory season. And it’s certainly given her the incentive to get her body toned as she has to squeeze herself into a basque for the role.\n\nHannah plays young prostitute Cyrenne who receives a visit from timid football fan Percy, played by Huw Higginson, when he’s on a trip away from Manchester with the lads.\n\nHis mates have a bet that he won’t spend the night with her, but he accepts it and goes to her basement flat.\n\nOnce there, Percy’s bravado dissolves and they are soon drinking tea while he admits feelings of inadequacy. Cyrenne, meanwhile, dazzles him with stories of her wealthy upbringing and sophisticated acquaintances.\n\nAs the play progresses, and the empathy between the characters develops, they start to reveal the truth about themselves and acknowledge their loneliness.\n\n“At the end of it, you realise they are two lonely people,” says Hannah, who celebrated her 34th birthday this week. “The script is funny and slick. I love it. And I’ve been quite lucky with my co-star,” she laughs.\n\nThe actress clearly loves working in theatre. “It keeps you on your toes. You get an immediate response from it,” she says.\n\n“I’ve got (the TV series) New Tricks out now which I shot last year and at the start of this year. There’s such a gap between filming and any kind of response.”\n\nThe play is set in the ’60s and Hannah enjoyed researching it.\n\n“I enjoy the whole rehearsal process and developing the characters. Because this is a period piece, I researched the costumes too.”\n\nWhile she’s touring with Rattle Of A Simple Man, she can also be seen in a few episodes of the new series of BBC’s New Tricks, in which she appears alongside dad Dennis.\n\n“It’s fantastic – I’m so pleased they keep asking me back,” she says.\n\nIt’s the first time she has worked with her famous father. “I wanted to get secure in my career before working with him,” says Hannah, whose mother is the Minder star’ s second wife, actress Patricia Maynard.\n\n“If I had just gone straight into a job with my dad it would have been on the back foot. But now I have 10 years’ work under my belt, so I’m confident enough to go in and deal with it.”\n\nHannah admits the pair get on “like a house on fire”. While she lives with her husband, actor Ricky Groves, in Cambridgeshire, whenever she’s working in London, she stays with her dad and she says they inevitably end up talking shop.\n\n“I sometimes bend his ear about jobs,” says Hannah, who since leaving EastEnders in 2004 has appeared in episodes of BBC medical dramas Doctors and Holby City as well as The Bill. “If I’m offered work we talk about whether or not I should take the offer. It’s quite normal for us to talk about work but it’s not an obsession.”\n\nAlthough it’s now five years since Hannah left Walford Square, people still often chat to her about her days on EastEnders, in which she played downtrodden Laura, who met a grisly end when she plunged down the stairs.\n\n“I’ve been dead so long now – rigamortis has long set in,” she laughs. “It’s not relevant to my life. It seems like aeons ago, but it gave me a great start to my career. I was 24 when I started and I was 34 this week. But I’m still thankful to it. It’s brought me other work and I learnt a lot.”\n\nHannah also met Groves on set, who has just finished his final scenes as Garry Hobbs.\n\nBut she has no plans to work with her real-life husband again just yet. “We didn’t work together that much (on EastEnders) to be honest, but if the right thing came along...”\n\nAs well as her father, mother and husband being in the acting business, Hannah’s younger sister Julia also trained as a classical actress, but now works in finance.\n\n“She’s about to go to Australia to live over there and I’m devastated,” says Hannah. I point out that at least it will be the perfect excuse for her to holiday Down Under. “Yes it would,” she says.\n\nAnd, of course, there are plenty of beaches where she can show off that new figure...\n\nRattle Of A Simple Man is at Swansea Grand Theatre from Tuesday until August 1. The box office number is 01792 475715"
