        "text": "The 45-year-old actor, best known for playing mechanic Garry Hobbs in EastEnders, split with Waterman four years ago when she left him after having an affair - yet the actress won't answer his phonecalls.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun on Sunday, Groves explained: \"Every time I’ve rung her the phone has been on but she’s not answered – I’ve left messages, sent texts but got no reply.\"\n\nThe lack of repsonse has left Groves feeling rather confused, especially as Waterman has settled down with former 'The Bill' actor Hew Higginson and had a baby.\n\nIt took me a long, long time to get over what happened; it was the lowest I’d ever been.\n\nRicky Groves\n\nWaterman, 38, left her husband after four years of marriage on New Year's Eve 2009, and the actor admits that he did struggle to move on at first.\n\n\"It took me a long, long time to get over what happened; it was the lowest I’d ever been,\" he told the newspaper. \"It was the cynical way it was done – I wish she had let me down gently but I suppose there is no easy way to leave someone.\n\n\"Our break-up hit me hard because I took my vows very seriously.\"\n\nGroves has now moved on and is in a relationship with Kay Russell,and is also set to take part in ITV1 show 'Splash' early next month.\n\nSpeaking about his new lover, Groves said: \"She’s a bit older than me, which I like – we have the perfect relationship.\"\n\nThe actor also admitted that the reason he is taking part in the diving show is so that she can shed some weight.\n\nActing is my trade, but it's not the most physical of jobs,\" he told the Daily Star. \"I'm 45 now, and at my age we can all get a bit lethargic.\"\n\n'Splash' returns to ITV1 on January 5 and will also star TOWIE's Gemma Collins, pop star Una Foden and Hollyoaks actress Gemma Merna."
