        "text": "Music & Mental Health\n\nA brief overview of the effect of music on the brain\n\nMusic, throughout history has been a powerful and influential part of every culture. There’s no escaping the world’s only invisible industry – it is present or influential in almost every form of media. From adverts to films, video games to art exhibitions, dance to theatre – there’s practically a guarantee that music has played a significant part in the life of almost every human being. But what is it that makes many report music to be addictive? What about music can induce euphoria? And does sad music really make us sad? This paper will discuss and analyse the many studies conducted on the effect of music on mental health.\n\nIt’s a well known fact that listening to music can release dopamine in the brain – the “feel good” chemical. How does dopamine work?\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter which most notably controls or regulates the functions of memory, sleep, learning, behaviour and cognition, but most importantly for music, your pleasure reward system. When a person experiences something pleasurable, dopamine is released, triggering your brain’s reward system and urging the person to seek out the experience again. This very exchange is how people become addicted to drugs, food or sex. Many drugs, such as cocaine, or MDMA block your brain from diminishing dopamine levels in your brain, thus bringing on a reported feeling of euphoria. Music being addictive or bringing on a “high” in people is a widely understood concept: hence “sex, drugs and rock’n’roll”.\n\nEven though music is not a vital part of survival in the same way that sex or food is, research has shown that day old infants respond to rhythmic patterns, and mothers across all different cultures and times have used lullabies or a rhythmic rocking motion to help their infants relax or sleep. Science has not yet agreed upon an answer as to why melody and rhythm seems to be hardwired into our brain, but the evidence thus far is suggesting that music is a core function in the human brain – and from an evolutionary standpoint, precedes language. Your body responds physiologically to music, and when you listen to a song you can find your footsteps, breathing or heartbeat start to sync with the tempo. Some therapists have claimed to help people who have suffered strokes or severe memory loss walk or talk again through the use of music.\n\nThere’s also evidence to suggest music enhances learning – chances are you learnt your ABC’s through a song. Music is only second to smell in our ability to store and recall memory.\n\nMusic as a tool to form connections has been used for hundreds and hundreds of years. German scientists conducted a study on the Mafa tribe of Cameroon, who had never listened to Western music before. They found that typical components and compositions of Western music were enjoyed by those who had never previously been exposed to it. The study asked the subjects to match Western music to emotions, happy or sad – and they did, spot on, every time. So is this something that is innately part of human psychology? Even more interestingly, when played the same styles of music, but tracks that had been edited to include off-beat rhythms and dissonant harmonies, the subjects found it off-putting and did not enjoy the music. This would suggest even further that human music taste (to a certain degree) is universal.\n\nMental health charity, Mind, advocate music as being “great” for a person’s mental health, and recommend (among other therapies) art and music therapy as a great way to improve your mental wellbeing. Art and music therapy are reported to work particularly well if “you feel distanced from your feelings or you find it too upsetting to talk about painful experiences, and would therefore find it difficult to benefit from talking therapies, such as counselling or psychotherapy.” Intuitively, the part of the brain that controls speech is the part of the brain that controls retention of lyrics and singing – so music therapy can encourage people to open up when they talk, or even help infants to learn to speak or enunciate better.\n\nIt is no secret or mystery that different music genres, keys, instruments and tones can have extremely varied effects on mood. Classical music has been shown to improve insomnia and regulate sleeping patterns among students. The researchers who conducted this experiment stated that music can decrease anxiety, blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate and relax muscles. Music at a slow tempo can decrease your heart rate, as mentioned above – the phenomena of physiological response to beats. “The study showed that showed that music statistically significantly improved sleep quality” although interestingly notes that “sleep quality did not improve statistically significantly in the audiobook and the control group.”\n\nThe study also noted that in stressed and insomnia affected students, “depressive symptoms decreased statistically significantly in the music group but not in the group listening to audiobooks.” Is it not strange that classical music with no vocals is more likely to calm a person, than a human voice reading us a story? This could be linked to slow music and the physiological response it triggers being able to induce a meditative state. This is called Brainwave Entrainment – the use of rhythmic stimuli to alter brainwave frequency and thus brain state. In addition to inducing sleep, this treatment is often used to synchronise the left and right hemispheres of the brain. A person with similar activity levels in both brain hemispheres is allegedly less prone to mental illness, and more likely to be emotionally stable and happier. Synchronised brain hemispheres are naturally found in people who meditate or who are more content with their lives: that music can bring on this effect in people in a true testimony to the power of music in mindfulness and meditation.\n\nBrainwave Entrainment, despite having been studied since the 1800s, is often criticised as pseudoscience because it is marketed as having unmatched healing qualities, and although the evidence for the technique points strongly towards it being beneficial in many instances, special treatment or pricey purchases are not needed. Simply listen to calming music.\n\nA popular way of using sound to increase or change brain activity is called Binaural Beats. Many claim that binaural beats may “simulate the effect of recreational drugs, help people memorise and learn, stop smoking, help dieting, tackle erectile dysfunction and improve athletic performance.” This method is achieved by playing sounds of different frequencies in each of the subjects ears, stimulating your brain to produce a third frequency itself. This third frequency can be manipulated to reportedly induce sleep, concentration, happiness or a vast array of other effects.\n\nWhilst more research is definitely needed in order to substantiate whether or not apps that produce binaural beats could improve a person’s mood or productivity, many users attest to the effectiveness of the technique. Other techniques such as monaural beats (binaural beats but played outside of the ear) and isochronic tones (regular beats in a singular tone) have been proven to be even more effective, however binaural beats are the most popular and readily available methods of brainwave entrainment. One user of binaural beats says, “I don’t know. Maybe because they’re the easiest to find on the market? Personally, I still use them too. At some times I like them more because they’re “gentler” and not as invasive as the isochronic tones.”\n\nThe array of research about music and it’s calming properties is astounding: peer reviewed scientific literature has proved that music can help cancer patients reduce stress and anxiety, reduce stress and anxiety in cardiovascular operation patients, ease recovery in stroke patients, help people perform better in high pressure situations such as basketball games or exams, reduce anxiety while driving and therefor prevent road rage, motivate people to exercise harder, help people eat less, help learning in children with autism and chromosomal disorders – the list is never-ending and research continues to accumulate. The impact on mental, and even physical health is practically undeniable at this point – so why do so many musicians suffer from debilitating mental illness?\n\nA study by health.com compiled a list of the professions most likely to suffer from a mental illness, and people working in the arts came in fifth place, with 9% of artists having suffered a major depressive episode in the last year. Hellienne Livandal from the Guardian writes “Drugs and alcohol have featured in the lifestyles of so many performers for so long that sometimes it’s difficult to tell if depression is the symptom or the cause. Some artists, as Marvin Gaye did, use them to steady their nerves before performances; others use them to come down from the high of the performance.”\n\nA study conducted by Help Musicians UK concluded that an overwhelming 60% of musicians suffer from mental health problems, and you only have to look on the news to see how many celebrities are being checked in and out of rehab, suffering from an eating disorder or even experiencing suicidal ideation. Steve Stack, director of the Center for Suicide Research and a professor at Wayne State University, claims that suicide rates among musicians are three times as high as the general population. Among the 2,000,000 people who die each year in the United States, the percentage of suicides among those who have died is 1.5 percent: the number for musicians is 2.1 percent.\n\nBryan Wilson, Syd Barret, Kurt Cobain, Ray Davies, Poly Styrene, Tom Waits, Jimi Hendrix, and even Wolfgang Mozart and Ludwig Van Beethoven are thought to or are confirmed to have bipolar disorder. In fact, the official mental health diagnostics manual for bipolar disorder states that “flight of ideas” and “excess pursuit of goal-directed activities” are two telltale symptoms experienced in a manic episode. Suicide and rock’n’roll especially are no strangers to each other. Rock-based genres have been blamed for many suicide cases over the years: parents, pastors and politicians claiming that the dark lyricism impregnated the minds of the young, vulnerable teenagers who took their own lives. Marilyn Manson, My Chemical Romance, Judas Priest and Ozzy Osbourne have all been blamed in some way for causing suicide of a young fan – including Manson being blamed for Columbine – when surprisingly enough, country fans are more likely to commit suicide than fans of any other genre.\n\nA 2015 study by the British medical journal, The Lancet, interviewed almost 4000 teenagers who self identify as “goth”, a fashion-based subculture linked to dark and dramatic alternative rock music with sad and yearning lyrics. Their results showed that self identified goth teenagers are three times as likely to be depressed, and five times as likely to self harm than their average non-goth peers.\n\n“Parents whose children identify with the Goth subculture need not be concerned,” researcher Lucy Bowes of the University of Oxford wrote to the Huffington Post. “The majority of teenagers identifying as a Goth in our study were not depressed and did not self-harm. The Goth community is traditionally very accepting of marginalised individuals, it could be that youths who feel isolated from mainstream society are attracted to this particular group, and may indeed gain support and help through being part of this subculture.”\n\nIt could also be that because alternative and darker subcultures, like goths, emos and punks are often given a harder time. In particular goths and emos are renowned for being in touch with their feminine or emotional side, and the links between goth fashion and music and self harm lead to people who identify with those subcultures being bullied. This could perhaps be the reason goths are more likely to be depressed – or maybe it is just a self fulfilling prophecy. Goths and emos have often in the UK been victims of hate crimes, and even murder, just because of what they are wearing. Like any study of mental illness, trying to differentiate between correlation and causation is a tricky task, and the relationship between a dark aesthetic or music taste and depression is definitely a complex one.\n\nThe likelihood is that people who are mentally ill seek out creative ways of expressing themselves, music and art being powerful tools of emotional outlet. Although, if the music you are exposed to can have such a massive effect on mood, is it therefore possible that listening to sad music can make you sad, or even a sadder person in general?\n\nA small study of 772 people lead by Liila Taruffi concluded that no: sad music does not make people sad, but is more likely to make people nostalgic. As psychology has noted for years and years, confronting past experiences can be good for your emotional wellbeing, so it is likely that nostalgia from music can help, or maybe just delight you. This essay has already touched on music as a powerful tool for memorising things – and nostalgia from music is made doubly stronger due to this phenomena. Those with past hardships in their lives, for example a traumatic childhood may therefore prefer to listen to sad music, perhaps because they can better relate to it, thus somewhat discrediting the notion that “goths” are made sad by the music they listen to. This creates a cycle whereabouts people with traumatic experiences in their past write music about their emotions, and then those who can relate to this listen in order to cope with the trauma, or to feel less alone.\n\nPeople finding sad music to be rewarding has been studied in an experiment about ‘meaningful media’. Mary Beth Oliver, co-director of the Media Effects Laboratory at Penn State University’s College of Communications says “In short, this research suggests that media entertainment can represent much more than just slapstick comedy and thrill rides. In addition, it can encourage people to reflect on life meanings, human compassion, and the importance of virtues such as kindness, love and connection.”\n\nOne could also make the argument that music in many cases can transcend language, which is why it is so useful for a therapy tool for people with communication problems. Perhaps when words cannot explain emotional distress, it is easier for a person to tune into a song and feel like they are being understood.\n\nWhen you think about it, emotions in music and art are scattered in a piece by the creator, like a time capsule, waiting for you, the listener, to come along and unlock them. That is truly an astounding feat, and although music is so subjective, there are many similarities that all humans share. In a way, when you are interacting with art, you are interacting with the artist and therefore a sort of conversation takes place between the listener and the writer, using the song as an intermediary.\n\nWhat is the purpose of emotion? It is a cue from our brains and bodies used in order to survive. It is our bodies thinking for us. The fear of the tiger chasing you, or the sadness of losing a loved one – it’s all there to help us continue our species and thrive, to live and to reproduce. My personal favourite theory as to why music moves us so, is moving itself. Movement is required to make music of any sort, and all musicians can attest to movement as a part of writing, performing and thinking about music. Written music has a flow and it comes to life on the page, it dashes around the stave and as you read, the music moves along. It is both linear and ever expanding outwards. As a synaesthete myself, I see the music sway and pop and jive in my head, and many people while they listen to their favourite songs may visualise fractals, colours, patterns or even full scenes in their head, like a movie or music video.\n\nMovement is almost exclusively limited to the living. Though the sea may wave, and the wind may shake the trees, the tectonic plates in the ground may shift – humans and animals are the only parts of Earth that truly express with movement. We all have fear, we all feel pain, we all fear death and crave sex and nutrients, our ingredients to survival. Although some animals may not be able to understand fully the human severity of these emotions, they are all innately parts of us and we express it through movement. Movement and body language has evolved into dance, into every part of our lives and to me, music is an expression of movement, inherently. Why does this song make you want to dance? That is the capsule of emotion and feeling you have unlocked from whomever wrote the song.\n\nWhen you are sad, you are slow. When you are happy, you can dance and you can celebrate joyously. Through shifting tempos, time signatures, melodies and harmonies, we can express these movements and vicariously, emotions to each other, and that is why I think music is the most effective communicator of emotion of all the arts – and why I strive to flow and throw myself through every life performance I do.\n\nI have always felt that to be a great and influential performer, you must have passionate and emphatic motion throughout being onstage. I know that when I get up to play a show, I must embody each song fully, becoming the song, fully understanding and appreciating the tone and emotion of the melodies and beats. To convey your music to your audience live, you must confidently and appropriately convey the tracks’ sentiment. It’s all theatre, darling, although a great live performance in music is more like speaking in tongues than it is a dance show with a dress rehearsal. It’s about spontaneity, and really using your body as a vessel to communicate the song.\n\nFor my end of year performance, my song of choice was I Love You All The Time by Eagles of Death Metal. It was difficult for me to choose a song during the preparation stages, so I ended up choosing it three weeks into rehearsal time. This was not a huge setback, thanks to the talented musicians in my group, but perhaps choosing it sooner could have benefitted me, not just for my own confidence with the song, but for the rest of my college band too.\n\nIn comparison with the other songs by my group, there is not a huge difference in the amount of time we spent working on the songs. Most of our setlist was only rehearsed as a group for around two hours per song, although we did all practice at home, myself meticulously so. I Love You All The Time is a very straightforward song for most of the instrumentalists, and I chose the most complex pat for myself. Part of the reason I chose the song is because the lead guitar heavily utilises bends and vibrato – things that I had been recommended to work on over my two years at Northbrook.\n\nI purposely selected a song with a challenging, but not very difficult part for myself, yet a simple and typical chord progression for the rest of the players. The only real struggle any of the group had with I Love You All The Time was grasping the French used in some of the lyrics. It would have benefitted us all if I had taken the initiative to either phonetically write out the French lyrics for the singers, or found other words to replace that verse with, as it proved to be an irritating task for Tristan and Beth. Thankfully, only a very small segment of the song was not in English, and none of our crowd was French, so the likelihood that somebody would have noticed or been thrown off by it is miniscule.\n\nMy advice to the singers about this issue was that as long as their vocal performance sounded tuneful, melodic and in key, and they performed well with their body language and expression, nobody would notice and it would prove not to be an issue. In rehearsals they tried their best to pronounce the words, and they did get the hang of it, and during the performance it was a great vocal performance for the most part. The only real problem was slight mumbling in the parts in French.\n\nUnfortunately, on the day of the final gig, Tristan did lose his voice. At the rehearsals we had the day before, he did comment that his voice was getting croaky and he was feeling ill, he said he would look after his throat and hope for the best. After his soundcheck performance on the day, he could hardly speak, which was clearly nerve wracking. We devised that he would not drink milk or coffee, he would refrain from smoking or being around people smoking, and that he would try his best to rest his voice before show time. The setlist originally went as follows: Bullet Girl, Me And Mrs Jones, I Love You All The Time, Black Horse And The Cherry Tree, and Tyrants. According to Tristan’s wishes, we put his song of choice, Me And Mrs Jones, as the first song of the set. That way, if some of the way through the set his voice started to crack and sound like his illness had gotten the better of him, at least the song he was being assessed on would have been first.\n\nWe would have originally done Joe’s song, Bullet Girl first as I was not performing on that song, so that I didn’t have to talk offstage and then back on, but ultimately Tristan’s well being and looking after his voice came first. Black Horse And The Cherry Tree was the other singer, Beth’s song, so we switched round I Love You All The Time and Black Horse And The Cherry Tree in order to give Tristan that mid-set break, being the song with the least of his vocals. In the hours between soundcheck and showtime, Tristan did ask Beth to look over the lyrics again and they devised a signal between each other, just in case Beth needed to take some of Tristan’s vocal parts. Luckily, the throat lozenges and lack of conversation worked for Tristan, as in the end he delivered an incredibly powerful vocal performance, even if it was somewhat strained. His problems prior to the show I feel did not detract anything from the gig, and both vocalists delivered technically skilled and emotive vocal performances.\n\nFor I Love You All The Time, Tristan and Beth did a somewhat call and answer, duet-type vocal performance, and whilst Tristan’s body language and expressions were very appropriate and confident, Beth is not quite as confident a performer, so her delivery was somewhat shy and maybe a little nervous looking. Her vocals on the other hand, I thought were incredible and powerful, and I thought they both were great fitting vocalists for the song, even in the process of choosing it. They didn’t let me down at all, and did just as great a job as I thought that they would.\n\nAt the end of I Love You All The Time, we had some problems with the amount of repeats of a little hook in the chorus, and the rest of the band kept playing it 2 times round when instead it was three. We figured out that we should follow the drummer Matt by looking at him during that point of the song. The song starts by Tristan shouting “I love you all the time!” in a French accent, which is an interesting way to start a song – getting the timing for that right was somewhat challenging but in the end it sounded really great.\n\nIn hindsight, if I could have changed anything about our performance of I Love You All The Time, I would have been more experimental about my guitar parts, and got a delay pedal for some huge reverb effects. Although for the most part I am very happy with how the track sounded, I focused more on the other songs the group was doing instead of practicing my own, and although I got the basics of the song spot on, I wish I had played around more with some licks, and changed it up a bit during the verses. It would have made it melodically more interesting and using a delay pedal would have given it a more airy, full sound like the track has on the recording. There were a couple of times whilst playing that I missed notes, but I think my performance in terms of body language made up for this, and I’m very happy overall with the way my band performed and communicated onstage.\n\nI also think the way my song was positioned in the setlist was very fitting, and that the way the setlist built up to Tyrants at the end was an excellent choice. This was Matt’s choice of song, and the one we had the least rehearsal on, but it was possibly the best song we performed on the night. I had the lead guitar part, and only 2 or 3 days to learn it, so it was somewhat nerve-racking, but I learnt it quickly and rehearsed it alone to the track countless times in those couple of days. The only time I managed to rehearse this one in the group was on the day of the gig, but it turned out to be no problem at all, and on the night we did a really great job. For the distortion tone on this and I Love You All The Time, I borrowed my classmate’s Proco Rat distortion pedal. I really loved the sound it gave me, and although it wouldn’t have been my first choice, I didn’t have the option to use amp distortion like I wanted to due to the nature of the song. Other guitarists in the year left pedalboards for those of us who needed them to use.\n\nTyrants has some unconventional changes of time signatures and unconventional breaks towards the end, but bassist Isaac and I watched Matt on drums for these parts and, although it could have been much tighter, it was still in time and played correctly, to what I would deem a professional standard. The run up for this song was somewhat a test of our session musician abilities – and a testament to how our time at Northbrook has helped us to learn sets accurately with very little rehearsal time. It was important to use body language appropriately in a song with so much emotion and dramatics to it. Whilst I was rehearsing, I wanted to make sure I was comfortable performing the song in an exciting and expressive way, and that was a super strong point of the song for our group. Me and Isaac in particular had some great eye contact and chemistry whilst performing, he and Matt definitely did a great job of moving around and really, properly, playing live.\n\nTristan’s song of choice was the Michael Buble version of Me And Mrs Jones. We had problems in particular figuring out the parts after the key change, and the stops in the middle eight stayed somewhat messy all the way up to the gig. I’m somewhat ashamed to admit that in the part just after the key change, I completely forgot what to play and improvised. I cannot quite remember how it sounded, as in the moment I was focusing very hard on just what to play next, but I think to the untrained ear it might have sounded unnoticeable. Most importantly, this slip up didn’t shake me up and leave me uncomfortable, as messing up onstage can do to you. I’m just glad a slip up in the first song of the set didn’t shake my confidence for the rest of the night. Matt, Isaac and Joe did such an amazing job on the parts that I slipped up on, that it sounded wonderfully tight just thanks to them, and no thanks to me. I was rather proud of them, it sounded wonderful. Compared to rehearsals, the tune went mainly as planned and I’m very happy with it.\n\nBlack Horse And The Cherry Tree was a very very simple song to play, and I don’t have much critique for it either way. In the verses I played simple funky staccato style parts, and in the choruses I played fifth chords. It sounded like it did in rehearsal, and honestly the song is so simple musically that it didn’t allow much room for error at all. My only complaint was that I had to find a better tone some of the way through, so I found myself messing with my pickups and I went out of time. The tone on the amp was way too trebly and cutting – even somewhat painful for me, as the treble was so loud in my monitor. I had this problem with every song with lead parts, as even with the treble turned completely down on the amp I was using, so I had to be very careful with my pickups and tone in order to find a good sound.\n\nDuring the choruses I could hardly hear my guitar, but thankfully the parts were incredibly simple and I could watch Joe, the rhythm guitarist, so I knew that I was playing the right thing. Although problems with the sound threw me off somewhat, we had so much fun performing the tune as it is so upbeat that I was very pleased with the outcome. Joe’s acoustic guitar parts carried the song so well, and I think it sounded awesome – his instrumentation was truly the driving force of Black Horse And The Cherry Tree.\n\nIn conclusion, I think our end of year gig went spectacularly well. I’m pleased with the outcome and so very glad I had such an amazing group of performers to play with. Although there are many little things I can pick out to critique, general feedback has been super positive and warm, and I truly think that the crowd watching enjoyed our set, and that we pulled off the songs super well."
