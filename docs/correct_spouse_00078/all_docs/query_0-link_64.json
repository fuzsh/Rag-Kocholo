        "text": "There may be another dreary day in EastEnders looming as poor old Laura Beale is laid to rest, but it has liberated the 28-year-old actress who played her.\n\nHannah Waterman told Justin Dealey about her new theatrical role, using her face muscles again and whether she thinks Janine will go daaaahn!\n\nHannah in typical Laura mode!\n\nWhenever I hear your name I just think of you laying at the bottom of those stairs!\n\nWell - Laura had to go. That ginger bob had to leave the earth!\n\nBut lets talk about the Vagina Monologues first. What's the basic story?\n\nA woman called Eve Ensler went around the world interviewing lots of different women from all walks of life. They told various different stories about their own experiences which she then transcribed and wrote around.\n\nSo some of the monologues are based on one womans story and some are based on several womens stories but quite often one theme comes up in all of them. Its very clever and very beautiful as well.\n\nYou must be quite excited about this?\n\nI am! Its a fantastic piece. Its funny, poignant, interesting and brilliant for women but Ricky [Groves - Hannah's boyfriend and Garry Hobbs in EastEnders] came last night for my opening night and he loved it.\n\nThere have been so many famous people who have performed in this show, so you must feel very proud to have been part of such a great success.\n\nNot many laughs for Laura in EastEnders\n\nYes - theres a fantastic history of cast, brilliant actresses. Its a really established piece and its great fun to play. You get a chance to play lots of characters and despite the name its about lots of different themes within that one theme.\n\nIts about love and birth and loyalty and infidelity even, but its also really funny - theres a lot of tongue in cheek stuff.\n\nIs it mainly a female audience?\n\nNo. I had my gay hairdresser come and see it and I thought hed hate it but he loved it. He thought it was hilarious. Its funny and thats the point. Its got a wider appeal than just to women because theres comedy in it and anyone can laugh. Even men laugh!\n\nHazel from Footballers Wives is also in the show isn't she?\n\nYes - the lovely Alison Newman - shes fantastic and VERY funny. Shes mad as a brush but shes fantastic and has been incredibly generous to me.\n\nIt will be really nice to see you with a smile on your face!\n\nYes, and with a nice wardrobe and nice hair and make-up as well! Its great fun.\n\nAround a year ago I read that your dad said that appearing in EastEnders was no good for you and you had to get out, so is this the next logical step for you?\n\nYes, I hadnt been on stage for eight years so its fantastic for me. Its just nice to have an audiences response and its interesting and its fun and its very much NOT Laura.\n\nI hate to say this but in EastEnders you were a bit of a drip werent you?\n\nMy god, Laura was so miserable, I never laughed so its great. I feel very liberated now. Its nice to be smiling again and using the muscles in my face that Id forgotten I had.\n\nShe wasnt very glamorous - thats a bit of an understatement - but it was good work for four years. I enjoyed myself there but it was time to laugh again I think.\n\nYou must have been sad though to move on though?\n\nWell I still see all my girlfriends that Ive got from the show so I havent really missed my friends because I stillsee them. Other than that, it had come to that point where I was more than ready for it, so it wasnt too much of a wrench.\n\nWho are those friends from the show?\n\nOh - Letitia Dean, Lucy Speed, Charlie Brooks - there are loads of them and they all come and stay at my house and dont leave for weeks!\n\nA rare smile for Hannah with screen husband Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt)\n\nSo after this show, whats next for you?\n\nWell, Im having a couple of weeks off and then Im doing it in Wimbledon with Jerry Hall which is really exciting. After that theres a project kind of bubbling around at the moment that should be happening around July time.\n\nWhat about gossip? I know you cant say too much but is Janine going to go down? Can you tell us?\n\nWell - its kind of up to Pat isnt it and whether or not she tells the truth or decides that Janine has to pay for her previous misdemeanours. I suspect that Pat might not be too sympathetic to Janine. Ill put it like that!\n\nYou can see The Vagina Monologues at the Watford Colosseum on 24 and 25 May 2004. And being the nearest venue on the tour to Elstree, it is thought that many of the EastEnders cast will be there to support her on the opening night.\n\nRead our interview with Christopher Parker (Spencer Moon) >>"
