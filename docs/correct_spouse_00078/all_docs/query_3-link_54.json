        "text": "Who is Hannah Waterman?\n\nAn actor currently appearing in Summer of Harold at the Ensemble.\n\nWhat would you do differently from what you do now?\n\nAs a child, I wanted to be a vet, but I was rubbish at science. I come from a family of actors, so it was perhaps inevitable.\n\nWho inspires you and why?\n\nMy 12 year old son who is learning to navigate the world with bravery and humour.\n\nWhat would you do to make a difference in the world?\n\nI would like all children in our world to be safe and fed.\n\nFavourite holiday destination and why?\n\nOur last proper holiday as a family was to Fiji. I’m yearning to go back and relax.\n\nWhen friends come to town, what attraction would you take them to, and why?\n\nWe live in the inner west and I love the view from the Anzac Bridge towards the Opera House.\n\nWhat are you currently reading?\n\nDemon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver is next on my list. Before rehearsals I read Horse by Geraldine Brooks.\n\nWhat are you currently listening to?\n\nEvery Sunday evening my husband and I listen to The Archers – a radio soap set in rural U.K. A little taste of home.\n\nHappiness is?\n\nBeing at home with my family.\n\nWhat does the future hold for you?\n\nWell I know for sure that I shall be returning to the Ensemble with my husband Huw Higginson to do the British play, Colder Than Here by Laura Wade.\n\nHannah can be seen in Summer of Harold by Hilary Bell – which is currently playing at the Ensemble Theatre until 14 October 2023.
