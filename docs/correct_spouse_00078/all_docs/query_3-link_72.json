        "text": "Former EastEnders actress Hannah Waterman is pregnant with her first child, according to the papers. The Sunday Mirror reports that the 35-year-old, who is the daughter of actor Dennis Waterman, was spotted out and about over the weekend sporting a very visible baby bump. It is thought she is due to give birth in the summer. However the paper adds that she has yet to reveal who the father is. \"This may come as a bit of a shock to a lot of people, but Hannah is absolutely thrilled,\" a source said. \"She is 35 now and feels it is the perfect time to start a family. Everyone who knows her is sure she's going to be a great mum.\" Hannah, who left EastEnders in 2004 after her character Laura Beale was killed falling down a flight of stairs, was previously married to her former EastEnders co-star Ricky Groves, but the couple split up last year. She famously lost two and a half stone and released a fitness DVD shortly before her marriage ended, and since leaving EastEnders has also appeared in the West End production of Calendar Girls."
