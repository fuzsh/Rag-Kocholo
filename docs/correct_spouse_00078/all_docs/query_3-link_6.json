        "text": "Hannah Waterman is a Ph.D student in History and Theory, supported by a Graduate Council Fellowship. In 2019, she received a B.M. with honors in music theory from UT Arlington. Her current research investigates harmonic cosmology as a knowledge-making practice at pivotal moments of sociopolitical upheaval, with particular emphasis on the musical world of astronomer Johannes Kepler. She is also interested in developing critical approaches to the analysis of popular music and culture."
