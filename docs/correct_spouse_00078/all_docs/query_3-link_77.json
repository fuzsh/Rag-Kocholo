My goal for each client is social and emotional well-being, strengthening relationships and increasing your ability to be in the present moment.\n\nDr.'s Julie & John Gottmanâ€™s books and trainings guide my work with couples. I enjoy the journey of supporting couples see each other and their relationship in a new light. Relationships are so crucial in our lives and they can be hard to navigate on our own.\n\nI was trained in EMDR through the EMDR Humanitarian Assistance Programs in 2018 and utilize this intervention to support healing around past traumas. I have found EMDR to be an amazing tool to facilitate integration of memories that can get stuck in our subconscious.\n\nI am trained in sand-tray therapy techniques and love to use this modality with both children and adults. My training began in Florida with the Institute of Playful Healing and continued at the Sand Tray Training Institute of New Mexico.\n\nI see therapy as a partnership between the client(s) and the therapist. Through the building of trust and understanding there can be new insights for growth and healing.\n\nIt can be an overwhelming step to begin therapy or find a new therapist! I would like to help you feel as comfortable as possible and know a little about what to expect.\n\nOur first appointment is a time to get to know more about what brings you to therapy and to review the paperwork you completed prior to the session. Over the next few sessions we will complete a plan for goals and course of treatment."
