Between volleyball and the science department, Linfield felt like home the second I stepped onto campus. It was an opportunity to extend my education in departments they are known for as well as take my sports career to the next level. It was small enough for me to be successful and work one on one with others, but large enough to meet someone new everyday.\n\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A STUDENT-ATHLETE AT LINFIELD? To me, being a student-athlete means that I must balance my academics, sport, leadership positions and social life to the best of my ability allowing myself to be successful. It means taking no days off, preparing myself ahead of time with time-management skills and communication to accomplish everything on my to do list for the day. It means I must have responsibility, determination, dedication and focus to maintain my busy schedule. As a student athlete, I am able to grow as an individual, teammate and scholar as I represent Linfield Volleyball while grinding away in the classroom or lab.\n\nWHAT MAKES YOU INTERESTING AS A STUDENT-ATHLETE? What makes me interesting and unique is that I am a double STEM major (biochemistry & molecular biology, mathematics), and balancing a few jobs (Local flow health bar, Starbucks, Organic chemistry TA, Into to mechanics grader), and hold two leaderships positions for fraternity and sorority life (Phi sigma sigma special events chair and LPC Publicity Officer). On top of this, I am the Linfield Volleyball captain and am completing extra research hours with Dr. Megan Bestwick (Iâ€™ve done it for two summers now). I am unique because I load myself up with a heavy schedule, but am able to manage it nonetheless with coffee and encouragement.\n\nWHAT IS NEXT AFTER LINFIELD? After I graduate Linfield, I plan to attend graduate school to get my PhD in Forensic Science Criminology. Linfield is helping me achieve this goal by presenting me with opportunities to work one on one with professors in the Chemistry department to receive extra laboratory experience. The professors are so willing to help and genuinely want to see you succeed and achieve all that you wish to.\n\nRelated Content\n\nThere is no related content available.\n\nRelated Headlines\n\nRelated Press Clips\n\nRelated Videos\n\nRelated Photos"
