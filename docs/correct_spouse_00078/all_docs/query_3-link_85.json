In the purchase, the US obtained the land that makes up 15 US states and 2 Canadian Provinces. The United States originally wanted to purchase of New Orleans and the lands located on the coast around it, but quickly accepted the bargain that Napoleon Bonaparte offered.\n\n1825 Â· The Crimes Act\n\nThe Crimes Act was made to provide a clearer punishment of certain crimes against the United States. Part of it includes: Changing the maximum sentence of imprisonment to be increased from seven to ten years and changing the maximum fine from $5,000 to $10,000."
