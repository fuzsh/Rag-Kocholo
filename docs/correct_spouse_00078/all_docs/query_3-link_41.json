        "text": "Former EastEnders star Hannah Waterman has married The Bill's Huw Higginson, with the couple tying the knot in Sydney.\n\nThe pair, who have been together for 12 years, shared photos of the beautiful ceremony on social media, with Hannah sharing three pictures on Instagram.\n\nThe first was a shot of the family outside of the church, with the second showing the couple alongside their son, Jack, on a boat as they sailed across Sydney harbour.\n\nThe final photo saw Jack signing the marriage certificate; the post was captioned: “We finally did it! We had the absolute best day ever!”\n\nRelated: Why everyone left EastEnders this year\n\nHannah, who played Laura Beale on the soap, wore a colourful, blue dress for her special day. Huw, best known for his role as PC George Garfield in The Bill, looked sharp in a navy suit.\n\nHannah was previously married to EastEnders co-star Ricky Groves, before rekindling her relationship with Huw after they worked together on stage.\n\n“Huw is lovely in real life. When there's only two of you (on stage), you have to absolutely trust each other…he is a rock,” she said (via OK! Magazine).\n\nThe couple’s wedding comes five months after Hannah lost her father Dennis, with The Sweeney and Minder actor passing away after a battle with lung cancer.\n\nRelated: EastEnders spoilers - dramatic new closing credits sequence\n\nHannah shared a tribute to the New Tricks star, posting a photo of Dennis holding her as a baby with the caption: “My Dad! I loved him x.”\n\nHannah appeared as Laura Beale on EastEnders between 2000 and 2004, before being killed-off as she fell down the stairs.\n\nLaura’s widow, Ian, remained in Walford for a further 17 years, before actor Adam Woodyatt departed the show.\n\nHe recently fuelled speculation about a possible return to Albert Square, saying: “I'm never gonna say never. But it's a question I get asked all the time. And it's a question I can't answer because I don't know the answer.”\n\nEastEnders airs on Mondays - Thursdays at 7.30pm on BBC One. The show also streams on BBC iPlayer."
