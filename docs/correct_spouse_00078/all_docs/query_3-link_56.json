        "text": "EastEnders star Hannah Waterman has tied the knot with partner Huw Higginson, best known for his work on The Bill.\n\nThe actress, who played Laura Beale on the BBC One soap, took to social media to share her happy news, telling her followers that she and Huw had the ‘absolute best day’.\n\n‘We finally did it!,’ she wrote on Instagram. We had the absolute best day ever!’\n\nHuw, meanwhile, who is best known for playing PC George Garfield on The Bill, wrote on Twitter: ‘Got married to my love yesterday. We had the best of days.’\n\nThe happy couple shared the same picture on their social media accounts, as they posed on a boat in Australia with their 11-year-old son Jack.\n\nFriends and colleagues were quick to comment, with Coronation Street and Hollyoaks star Angela Lonsdale writing: ‘Awe darling huge congratulations miss you so much x you look wonderful x x so happy for you all.’\n\nHollyoaks and The Upper Hand star Joe McGann added: ‘Congratulations.’\n\nHannah played Laura in EastEnders for four years, appearing in the BBC One soap between 2000 and 2004.\n\nDuring her stint on the serial drama, she featured in many a memorable moment, as Laura became the third wife of mainstay Ian Beale.\n\nLaura first met Ian when he employed her as a nanny for his kids Peter, Lucy and Steven.\n\nSoon enough, the two embarked on a relationship, and married in 2001.\n\nIn addition to her relationship with Ian, Laura is fondly remembered for her feud with Janine Butcher, which developed after Laura had discovered Ian had been paying Janine to sleep with him!\n\nThe animosity between the two continued for quite some time, and culminated with a heated showdown on the eve of Laura’s demise.\n\nViewers will know that Laura tripped and fell down the stairs to her death.\n\nPat Butcher found Laura dead at the bottom of the stairs, and having learned of Barry’s death, she refused to provide Janine with an alibi.\n\nIf you’ve got a soap or TV story, video or pictures get in touch by emailing us soaps@metro.co.uk – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nJoin the community by leaving a comment below and stay updated on all things soaps on our homepage.\n\nMORE : EastEnders confirms six major character returns for Dot Cotton’s funeral\n\nMORE : EastEnders spoilers: Kheerat Panesar demands answers from Suki after Eve Unwin sex shock"
