        "text": "Hannah Waterman has tied the knot with The Bill star Huw Higginson in Australia - five months after her famous father Dennis died.\n\nOn Wednesday, Huw, 58, took to Twitter to reveal the happy news as he shared a gorgeous photo of himself and his new wife posing outside Sydney Opera House.\n\n\"Got married to my love yesterday. We had the best of days,\" he penned.\n\nThe wholesome snap saw Huw's new wife Hannah, 47, wear an eye-catching blue patterned dress as she posed on a boat alongside their son Jack, 11.\n\nHuw looked just as dapper in a slick navy suit, while their son pulled out all the stops in an all black suit.\n\nHuw also shared another snap which showed the newly-weds beaming as they posed alongside their family and friends.\n\nHannah and Huw have been dating since 2010, after a long friendship of over 10 years.\n\nFollowing their wedding joy, fans flocked to gush over the happy couple's special wedding day.\n\n\"Congrats to you both! I love you both. So happy for you,\" one Twitter fan gushed.\n\n\"This is so beautiful. Congratulations,\" another echoed.\n\n\"True love does exist,\" someone else swooned.\n\nWhile a fourth gushed: \"Beautiful. I'm sure Hannah's dad was looking down on her throughout it all.\"\n\nTheir special wedding day comes just five months after Hannah faced devastation following the death of her father, Dennis.\n\nThe actresses' dear dad died at the age 74 in May.\n\nAt the time, Hannah broke the sad news by posting a picture of the legendary TV star smiling while holding her in his arms as a baby.\n\n\"My Dad! I loved him,\" she captioned the poignant post.\n\nHannah's beloved dad was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer less than three months before his death.\n\nDoctors discovered the severity of his cancer after they found a tumour was in a bone in his leg.\n\nFollowing his sad death, Hannah has said that she's been 'figuring out' how to live a life without her father in it."
