        "text": "TALKING to Ricky Groves about changing partners might come under the heading of heartless, but at the time we were discussing the fact that Erin Boag isn’t available for the tour of Strictly Come Dancing, which arrives at Newcastle tomorrow night. “The bizarre thing about the tour is that Erin and Anton (du Beke) are professional partners and had arranged their own tour before the Strictly tour was decided.\n\nBut, on the plus side, I’m now dancing with the lovely Aliona (Vilani) who is quite new to the Strictly world having partnered Rav (Wilding) on TV.\n\n“We are looking at six weeks of dancing individually and in groups after the crash course competition on TV with five days to learn a routine. On the tour I’ll have 33 appearances with the same dance, so Newcastle might see a bit of an improvement by the time I get there. Learning to dance with two different people will make me a better dancer,” he says about taking on the paso double and the Vienesse Waltz for the tour.\n\nSince then, Groves’ separation from actress wife Hannah Waterman has made many painful headlines. The two met and became an item on the set of EastEnders with Grove’s character Garry Hobbs becoming one of the best-known faces in Albert Square.\n\nThe pair married in 2006, but I should have seen that there was trouble ahead when I interviewed Waterman back in June last year.\n\nStarting a family wasn’t particularly high on her list of priorities and she told me rather brusquely “you’ll be the first to know” if she ever got pregnant.\n\nGroves, 41, was said to be “at home with the dogs” while she was touring to Darlington Civic Theatre and later in the year he admitted that the couple “were like ships that passed in the night” and didn’t hold out much hope of the pair ever using his new-found dance skills.\n\nShe was now in the West End and he was in Strictly Come Dancing on TV and earning more publicity for shedding two stone after taking rehearsals really seriously. In fact weight loss was destined to bring down the marriage with 34-year-old Waterman determined to slim after the tabloids ran an unflattering picture of her in a polka dot bikini and suggested she was pregnant.\n\nA spectacular 7st 10lb figure, a role in the stage version of Calendar Girls and a critically-praised weight loss DVD for Waterman came just before an announcement that the Huntington-based couple were no longer an item.\n\nHe, apparently, was in tears. She, according to rumour, thought he was boring.\n\nNot quite like the jaw-jutting man who TV audiences saw overcome some fierce criticism from the Strictly judges and fight his way through to week ten of the competition despite not having done anything more than “a drunken hokey cokey” previously.\n\n“The judges gave me a very hard time at the start and then they turned it around in weeks three and four, and in week five it all went wrong. I think that bit of the show is a little too like pantomime for my liking, but it’s all part of the programme. Lovely old Bruno, Len and Craig all bring something to the table. I only wish I could have pleased them a little bit more.”\n\nHe became the icon of the rest of us “average Joes” who wouldn’t dare let the world laugh at seeing a flop in a flamenco outfit. “The whole Strictly experience went, very, very quickly for me. There was a little bit of me that kicked myself and said ‘if only I’d tried a bit harder’ but I think I took the competition as far as I could. What I got out of if was the tour, so I’m over the moon.\n\n“From day one when I first got told that I was doing Strictly, and there is a history of people from EastEnders doing the show, it wasn’t going to do my career any harm. I had a fair stab at it and I was in the last six, with 16 to start with, and I was the oldest person left in at that stage. So I passed on the sparkly, diamond-encrusted zimmer frame to someone else,” he jokes.\n\nGroves feels that the Strictly audience will often vote through people that they feel have made the most interesting journey. In his case his dance efforts were audible because the ex- EastEnder put in such a determined performance and he accepts that a mistake in his final tango, producing a third dance-off placing, meant the end of the road.\n\n“The week I did go out I did the most fabulous dress rehearsal, but on the night, nerves got to me and boomp I went wrong,”\n\nGroves says.\n\nHe reveals that his father-in-law, the famous actor Dennis Waterman who is renowned for his dislike of soap operas, had taken to watching Strictly “mainly I think because of his partner, Pam”.\n\nAnd did he ever offer Groves any acting advice?\n\n“I think the best tip is to be yourself in this industry, check your flies before you go on and always be polite to people and don’t knock anyone on the way up because you’ll meet them on the way down,” says the actor who has come through the 14 hours a day, six days a week demands of soap.\n\n“Garry took up nine years and 800-odd episodes of my life and it was my TV apprenticeship. It is difficult and I’m very proud of that character. Never say never, and if Garry was to turn up in The Square again I’d like to think he was a changed man in some ways so it would be a bit more challenging for me. But for now I’m a dancing monkey,” he jokes.\n\n■ Strictly Come Dancing Live 2010, Tomorrow, 7.30pm, Saturday, 2.30pm and 7.30pm, Sunday: 1.30pm and 6.30pm.
