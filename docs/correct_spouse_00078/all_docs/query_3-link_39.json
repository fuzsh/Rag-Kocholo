        "text": "1620 Â· The Pilgrims Board the Mayflower\n\n\"The Pilgrims boarded the Mayflower in search of religious freedom in the New World in September 1620. The Mayflower set sail from Plymouth, England, with 102 passengers, 40 of whom called themselves \"\"Saints.\"\" After two stormy months at sea, the ship reached the New World. Nearly half of the group died during their first winter due to malnutrition and the harsh New England winter.\"\n\n1642 Â· The English Civil War\n\nA series of conflicts regarding England's governance during the years 1642 to 1651 is now known as The English Civil War. Charles I summoned supporters to join him against his enemies in Parliament. In October 1642, nearly 10,000 men fought for Charles I and chased Parliament across the River Tamar. Fighting continued for years and was finally ended at the Battle of Worcester on September 3, 1651, with a Parliamentarian victory."
