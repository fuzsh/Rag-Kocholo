        "text": "My thesis work is centered around understanding how hepatic exposure to insulin in the morning (from ingested carbohydrates, for example) primes the liver for increased hepatic glucose uptake and storage when challenged with a second meal. This would integrate with the goals of the APMM to develop human research studies because there have not been a lot of human studies done looking at this phenomenon. This is something that is being explored as a lifestyle intervention for individuals with diabetes, as meal composition and timing of insulin delivery can be tailored to manage glucose homeostasis and increase hepatic glycogen stores. I plan on doing a project with an endocrinologist."
