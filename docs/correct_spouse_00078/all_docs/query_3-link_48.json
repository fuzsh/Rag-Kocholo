        "text": "Ex-EastEnders star Hannah Waterman has got married to The Bill star Huw Higginson. The two television stars got married in Australia on Tuesday, October 11, Huw revealed on his social media today (Wednesday, October 12). The happy news comes just five months after Hannah lost her famous father Dennis Waterman, who was the star of New Tricks.\n\nHer new husband Huw, 58, shared the news on his Twitter on Wednesday, posting a photograph of the happy couple posing right outside the Sydney Opera House. \"Got married to my love yesterday. We had the best of days,\" gushed the actor. In the snap, Hannah, 47, could be seen wearing not the traditional white, but a smart blue-patterned dress as she gazed lovingly at Huw.\n\nHuw wore a navy check suit, and the couple's son, 11-year-old Jack, a smart black suit and shades as he posed happily between his parents for the photoshoot on the back of a boat. A second snap showed the newlyweds grinning elatedly as they posed with their wedding guests on a grand set of steps.\n\nREAD MORE: Stacey Solomon horrified as Joe Swash licks mayo out her hair\n\nHannah, who famously played Laura Beale in EastEnders from 2000 until 2004, started dated Huw in 2010, after the pair previously had a long-standing friendship for more than a decade. Upon hearing the news, fans quickly flooded social media with messages of congratulations on their wedding.\n\n\"Congrats to you both! I love you both. So happy for you,\" one Twitter fan gushed. \"This is so beautiful. Congratulations,\" echoed another. \"True love does exist,\" someone else swooned, as a fourth person penned a knowing tribute to Hannah's late father, writing: \"Beautiful. I'm sure Hannah's dad was looking down on her throughout it all.\"\n\nHannah and Huw's wedding has taken place just five months after the devastating death of Hannah's beloved father earlier this year. Dennis Waterman died age 74 in May. At the time, Hannah broke the sad news by posting a picture of the legendary TV star smiling while holding her in his arms as a baby.\n\n\"My Dad! I loved him,\" she captioned the poignant post. Hannah's beloved dad was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer less than three months before his death. Following his sad death, Hannah has said that she's been 'figuring out' how to live a life without her father in it.\n\nWant to get personalised celeb, TV, and entertainment news straight to your inbox every day?
