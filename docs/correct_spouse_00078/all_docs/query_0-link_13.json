        "text": "NEXT week EastEnders fans will wave goodbye to Garry Hobbs, who’s been one of the most popular characters for 10 years.\n\nIt’s a massive change for actor Ricky Groves – but helping him adjust to life after soap is his wife, Hannah Waterman.\n\nShe knows exactly what it’s like to leave EastEnders and have to find work. So has she been giving Ricky advice?\n\nHannah diplomatically says: “Ooh, that’s not the best thing to do with husbands. I will stay out of it and let him work it out for himself!\n\n“But he’s had a lot of meetings and it looks like he’s going to be fine.\n\n“I was on the road in doing a stage tour when he left, so I haven’t been around to support him. That’s been pretty tough on him, but I have to work to pay our mortgage. I missed all the leaving parties which I was gutted about.”\n\nThe word is that, despite a hiccup on their wedding day – it wouldn’t be soap if there wasn’t – Garry and Dawn will sail off into the sunset together.\n\nHannah says: “Garry deserves a happy ending, doesn’t he? There would be an uproar if they did anything terrible to him.”\n\nWhile many viewers, especially women, think Garry is too good for cheating Dawn, Hannah is happy to see them together.\n\n“She’s a very pretty girl. Women may not like her but a lot of men in the country will be going ‘go for it Garry!’.\n\n“Ricky has been in EastEnders for a long time, but he’s excited about what the future holds. I’ve been doing all sorts of roles since I left, and that’s what he’s looking forward to. Every actor wants to play more than one role.”\n\nOne of Hannah’s most popular jobs since leaving behind her seven-year stint as Ian Beale’s wife Laura has been her appearances in New Tricks.\n\nThe Midland graduate – she took English and theatre studies at Warwick University – plays police office Emily Driscoll in the BBC1 drama, which means acting with her father Dennis Waterman.\n\nDevastated\n\nEmily tracked down Dennis’s character of Gerry Standing, believing him to be her father, but in the last series she was devastated to learn he wasn’t her dad.\n\n“She nearly didn’t forgive him for the lie, but they have resolved it. Even though they’re not biologically related, she doesn’t have anyone else and to all intents and purposes he is her dad.\n\n“It would be an interesting storyline if she did find her real father.\n\n“I’m so glad they got me back in, it’s a joy to be acting with this cast. And because I play a police officer, I can have work and domestic storylines.\n\n“I love working with Dad, we’ve been talking for years about being in a play together but it’s really hard to find something suitable. Someone needs to write us one with a good father-daughter relationship.”\n\nIn Thursday’s episode, Emily takes a reluctant Gerry and the team to a comedy club to celebrate Gerry’s birthday. Racist, sexist and homophobic comedian Ray Harris (John Henshaw) isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. Gerry’s enjoyment is at odds with a group of hecklers who cause such a commotion they are thrown out. DS Sandra Pullman (Amanda Redman) intervenes and discovers the most vocal of the hecklers is the niece of a political activist who went missing 25 years earlier after waging a campaign against Harris.\n\nHannah looks heavier in New Tricks than in real life, as she’s lost more than a stone in weight since filming. She’s long battled with her size – back in 2006, when she took part in the Sky circus talent show Cirque du Celebrite, she was forced to wear possibly the world’s most unflattering outfit.\n\nThis year she was prompted to go on another diet when she was snapped on the beach sporting a spare tyre. She’s now dropped two dress sizes, going from size 16 to 12, and showed off her figure on stage in a corset in the play Rattle Of A Simple Man.\n\nNow she’d like to lose a bit more weight and get fit to run the London Marathon again.\n\n“My personal trainer is trying to persuade me to run it next April. I did it three years ago in just under six hours, which I class as my greatest achievement, but if I did it with him I’d have to do it in about four and a half hours. He really shouts at me when I run with him, but it is the best way to burn fat.”"
