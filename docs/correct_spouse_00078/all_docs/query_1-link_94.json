        "text": "Corissa Elaine Lovio\n\n2/12/1983-3/21/2024\n\nBorn in Mount Shasta to parents; Mother — Patricia Elaine Lovio, Father — Ernest Mark Lovio. Stepmother — Laura Ann Lovio. Brothers — Christopher Lee Lovio, Bryan Matthew Lovio and Jesse Guido Mei. Sister Victoria Jean Lovio. Five nephews — Dante, Thorin, Tristen, Daniel, Elijah and Niece — Faith Lovio.\n\n“Cora”, a lifelong resident of Mount Shasta, passed away at her home on March 21, 2024. Her family is deeply saddened. No words can express the hole left in our hearts by her absence.\n\nShe will always be remembered by her beautiful smile and great personality. Her vibrancy would shine light on everyone she came across.\n\nWhile attending high school, Cora had a love for art. Her instructor, Ms. Brown, always encouraged her creativity. Literature was her second passion. She wrote many poems based on the writings of Edgar Allen Poe.\n\nWhile living with her father, on her lunch breaks at school, she and a handful of friends would rush home and raid the refrigerator. When her father would get home late from work he found the refrigerator bare. The “girls” must have enjoyed Dad's cooking, for this went on for quite some time.\n\nShe enjoyed her vacations with her brother and sister. Visits to the Grand Canyon, Cabo San Lucas, Disney Land.\n\nAfter her auto accident and 2 years in the hospital, Cora was able to come home to her mother. Cora suffered a Traumatic Brain lnjury T.B.I. and left a Quadriplegic. Having lost her ability to speak, family and friends, were able to communicate with her thru expressions, body language, and the blinking of her eyes.\n\nHer mother, and sister, would take her to family reunions in California and Oregon. They traveled to South Lake Tahoe, the Hearst Castle, Bodega Bay, the Oregon Coast and flew her to Hawaii to visit family, not once but twice! During the hot summer days, she would often be seen out on Shasta Lake, with her aunt and uncle on their patio boat. Sometimes getting in the water and floating with her family.\n\nShe looked forward to her walks. She went through several wheelchairs, logging many miles through out the streets of Mount Shasta and beyond. Including “Misery Hill” on Lake Street, by the Pepsi plant. She would sit in the warm sun and listen to the wind blow around her and bask in the warmth of the day. She would trek in her van, to Bunny Flats, Castle Lake, the Lower Falls in McCloud, the Ski Park, Shasta Lake and shopping in Yreka at Wally World.\n\nCora was a very social person. In wintertime, when it was too cold and wet to walk, she would be seen roaming the aisles of Ray's market socializing with the customers.\n\nShe liked to sit looking out her big front window and listen to her 90’s music. Tupac Shakur was her favorite artist.\n\nCora came to us a very old soul. Just by being in her presence and spending time with her, friends and strangers alike, learned from her strong spirit and positive outlook. She brought joy and wonder, to everyone she encountered.\n\nWith her mother, sister and Aunt “Terri's” loving and excellent care, Cora lived her life to the fullest extent, in spite of her limitations. They kept Cora healthy and happy in her home. Their devotion and love, allowed our family to enjoy our lives and precious moments with her.\n\nWe lost a beautiful daughter and sister.\n\nShe was strong like a warrior,\n\nWith a heart as gentle as a lamb.\n\nLeah Louise Cole\n\n09/11/1930-04/10/2024\n\nLeah Louise Cole, a resident of Mount Shasta, passed away at her residence on April 10, 2024. She was 93 years old.\n\nLeah was born to John A. and Leah E. Stannard on September 11, 1930 in Los Angeles, California. The family moved to Inglewood in 1933. She graduated from Inglewood High School in 1948 and attended Los Angeles City College.\n\nShe was employed by the Pacific Telephone Company as an Engineer in the Los Angeles and San Diego County areas retiring in 1982 after 30 years of service.\n\nShe and her husband Robert moved to Mount Shasta from Southern California in 1982. They relocated to McCall Idaho in 1990, returning to Mount Shasta in 1995.\n\nShe was predeceased by her parents; her husband, Robert J. Cole; and, step-daughter, Doris A. Ritchie. She is survived by her step-daughter, Betty C. Gardner; Betty’s family; and, the family of Doris Ritchie, all of Idaho; her lifelong friend, Joan Stark of Westlake Village California; her “second family” Deborah and Brian McDermott and their daughter’s, Christina Lowe (Jeff); and, Kimberly McDermott; friends, Ginny and Lou Wandro; and, Linda and “Buzz” Whalen all of Siskiyou County, who have all been so much help to her.\n\nAt Leah’s request there will be no services.

He had a great\n\nsense of humor, and always did quirky things that made everyone around him laugh (we call\n\nthem “Don-isms”). He was always quick to help people out, had a great smile and dimples, and\n\nhis blue eyes twinkled.

They were married in 1968 and continued school until Ron graduated from the veterinary school in 1970. While in Davis, they developed an appreciation for Napa Valley wine tasting and camping and backpacking together.\n\nThe couple moved to Redondo Beach for Ron’s first job as a veterinarian and for Linda to attend physical therapy school.

He will be deeply missed by those who shared in his life.\n\nSam was born on November 20, 1930 in New York City, third child to Samuel H. Ordway , Jr. and Anna Wheatland.\n\nAs an adolescent growing up in Manhattan, he had many adventures exploring Central Park, riding on the subways and eventually joining the Harvard mountaineering club while studying Russian language and literature at Harvard. Upon graduation, he entered the navy through the ROTC program in college and went off to the Korean war. He took a year off from graduate studies after he returned from the war and traveled through Europe. His language skills landed him a job at the State Department where he served his country as a diplomat for 30 years. He met and married his first true love Penny, where they had many more adventures working overseas together and had two sons, Richard and David. Sam and Penny eventually retired from their jobs and made their way west to the family ranch in Weed, Ca. When Penny passed away from cancer in 1994, he met his second true love Chris, who loved and cared for him for 30 years. He was happy until the end.\n\nHe was predeceased by his father and mother, sister Kinney, brother Stephen, sister Ellen and beloved wife Penelope Joan Bronson Ordway.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Christina, son Richard and his wife Bonnie, granddaughter Anna & Trevor and great grandson Avery, son David & Sigrid, granddaughter Christine and Zac, grandson Eric and grandson Patrick.\n\nKarole Joyce Meeks\n\n4/8/1939-3/10/2024\n\nKarole lived a long and wonderful 84 years that brought not only unyielding love and joy to her family, but to all of those she met. Karole was born to Milton and Jacqueline Peterson in the middle of her two sisters, Jackie, and Sondra. Karole spent her younger years growing up on Greenhorn Road in Yreka and attended school there through to her high school graduation. She would often tell stories of riding horses with her sisters and their sweet care for one another and that they would always wait if one of them fell off the horse to get back on again. Karole was a strong and hard worker her entire life and she recalled a time she and her sisters helped their father dig a well as he blew up rock with dynamite and they would climb in to help bring up the debris. One skill she always felt proud of was her accuracy with a 22 rifle that her father taught her to use by throwing old vacuum tubes in the creek for her to shoot.\n\nKarole married Dickie McCurdy fresh out of high school and they had two boys together, Richard and Michael. Michael was born with severe disabilities that he would succumb to at the age of seven. Karole experienced an enormous loss but never wavered in her devotion and care to her other children. Karole possessed the strength of a village of mothers and shared that compassion and kindness with everyone she touched. In 1960, she lost her husband Dickie in a tragic accident and was left to take any work she could to support her two children, even taking in laundry at home in an era that did not offer welfare or any other supports.\n\nGlen Meeks would eventually come into her life with Cindy, a daughter from a previous marriage. Glen and Karole would have a son and daughter together, Craig and Mishelle and raise their family in Dunsmuir. Glen worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad but was also a talented musician that played music locally for many years. Karole spent much of the early years of her children’s life at home but would eventually take a job at the local elementary school as a Librarian. Karole found passion working in the school with children and her impact on those around her built bonds that lasted a lifetime. Karole moved on from the school when she purchased the McLauglin Grocery Store and operated it for several years, but multiple incidents of theft led her to sell. Karole finished her working career at Ray’s market in Weed as the produce manager but a workplace injury that caused her to break her back ended her ability to work. Karole had surgery on her back that caused her to die on the table but was resuscitated and spent the rest of her life with chronic pain. Karole would lose her husband Glen in 1998 to a heart attack.\n\nThrough every loss and hardship of her life, Karole remained unwaveringly positive and full of love and joy for those around her. Karole made a home in Montague and was devoted to her community where she served as the bookkeeper for the library, was the fire commissioner, and even facilitated the opening of a teen center. Karole’s greatest dedication was to her many grandchildren, begging their parents every time they picked them up to stay one more night at Grandma’s house. Grandma’s house brimmed with the fun and comfort that some may only think exist in fairy tales. From the salt and pepper shakers lining every shelf to the jellybean chicken feeder, there are so many little aspects of being at Grandma’s that no one that went there could ever forget. Karole created a home that no one felt unwelcome in and that if you could help it, you would never want to leave. That is most likely why she never had a time when a grandchild wasn’t there, even into their adulthood. Grandma’s house was the place all her grandchildren knew they could go to when they needed a place to stay where you knew as soon as you walked in the door you were home.\n\nKarole passed away exactly the way she lived her life. In her home, surrounded with overwhelming love and kindness. Karole’s memory lives on through her children, many grandchildren, and great grandchildren. The family invites all those that wish to celebrate the life of this remarkable person to attend her memorial ceremony that will be held at the Dunsmuir Community Center on May 11, 2024, at 2:00.\n\nJagdish Chandra “Jay” (Sanmukhbhai) Patel\n\n9/15/1957-3/8/2024\n\nIt is with a heavy heart and great sadness that we announce the passing of Jagdish Chandra “Jay” (Sanmukhbhai) Patel at the age of 66 on March 8th, 2024 in Redding, CA. “Sanmukh”, as he was known by his friends and family, resided in Mount Shasta, CA for the last 34 years of his life. He was born 9-15-1957.\n\nSanmukh cherished being in the company of his children and grandchildren. Watching and playing with them he worked tirelessly to the day he passed. Sanmukh spent over 40 years doing what he loved to do: by doing “everything” himself. His name is synonymous with the words “hard work.” Coming from a very humble beginning in Vaghecha, Gujarat, India he never wanted his family to struggle as his family did in India.

We miss him so much already and will always love him.\n\nJagdish Chandra \"Jay\" (Sanmukhbhai) Patel is survived by:\n\nHis Loving Wife:\n\nPrabhavati (Bella) Patel\n\n(Gaam: Timba)\n\nChildren:\n\nRakhee and Rushabh Kamdar\n\nHiten Patel and An Nguyen-Patel\n\nHennaly Patel\n\nGrandchildren:\n\nRithik (7), Rishika (4), Arya (2)\n\nGranddog:\n\nCurry (4)\n\nJagdish Chandra \"Jay\" Sanmukh Patel's funeral service will be held on Thursday, March 14th, 2024 at 10am-1pm\n\nGerry Ann La Salvia\n\n7/31/1943-3/3/2024\n\nIn Loving Memory of Gerry Ann La Salvia\n\nWith humble hearts and gratitude for her blessed life, the family of Gerry Ann La Salvia announces her peaceful passing on March 7, 2024 at the age of 80 in Weed, California.

Her professional journey, marked by integrity and hard work, reflected her respect for the dignity of every individual.\n\nA devout member of the Mount Shasta Seventh Day Adventist Church, Gerry’s faith was the compass that guided her through life’s journey. She served with a spirit of humility and joy, volunteering at the Crisis Pregnancy Center, Coffee Connection, and Stable Hands, where she extended her hands to help and further the mission of each organization.\n\nThe sacred remembrance of Gerry’s life will be celebrated on Saturday, March 16th at 1:30PM at the Mount Shasta Seventh Day Adventist Church.

The family moved to Weed, California in the mid 1940’s where Harold attended school, graduating from Weed High in 1958. Harold started his career working many jobs in and out of town – ending up at International Paper Company in Weed.\n\nIn 1962 Harold married the love of his life, Patricia Marie Ortiz, on October 12, 1962 beginning their life of 61 years together.\n\nHarold moved on from the mill to stepping in to a log truck and started a driving way of life that fit him well with a short 4 year stint working for the Hammond brothers. After that, Harold returned to International Paper for a short time until they closed their doors, then back to driving and hauling logs for Gene Erickson Trucking, but Harold wanted his own truck again. So in 1983 he bought another log truck. Long summers were spent in the woods hauling logs, and winters were spent at Cal-Trans plowing snow away for the roadways. In 2000, Harold signed on full-time with Cal-Trans, until retiring in 2006.\n\nRetirement life was full of Oregon elk-hunting trips, and salmon fishing summers on the Klamath River. Harold and Pat also enjoyed black powder rendezvous, and camping with his family and friends. Harold was always up for helping his kids Dion, Shari, and Shelly with a project –which he complained about, but would not have missed for anything. Harold also had a love for cars, and recently finished a 45 year project – building a 1928 Model-A Roadster. For years you could catch a fleeting glimpse of Harold and Pat as they cruised around the county.\n\nHarold was preceded in death by his older brother, David James; his father, John; and mother, Ivy.

Along the way, he found healing within himself and his family. \"Golf put my son's and my relationship back together,\" he said when speaking of returning to golf after suffering a life-changing injury. \"I could tell after everything we'd gone through that he was proud of me again.\"\n\nThose who knew Dennis best will remember his joyously infectious laugh and smile, his optimism in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges, and the courage he shared with those who feared that physical disability would prevent them from enjoying golf or any other sport again. As a final victory over the accident that paralyzed him long ago, Dennis joined as one of twelve members chosen to represent the United States in the Phoenix Cup in Santa Barbara, California, where he and his teammates left triumphant.\n\nHe will be remembered as a loving son, dedicated father, doting grandfather, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin, partner, adoring caregiver to his dog Ace, and a dearly missed friend.\n\nA service honoring his life will be held at Lake Shastina Golf Resort on October 15, 2023, at 1:30 p.m. 5925 Country Club Drive, Weed, CA.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to David's Chair or the Stand Up and Play Foundation.\n\nWww.davidschair.org\n\nWww.standupandplayfoundation.org\n\nMyrna Louise Green\n\n1/21/1938 - 8/13/2023\n\nThe world became brighter on January 21, 1938 the day Myrna Louise Haddock Green was born.
