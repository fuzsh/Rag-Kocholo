        "text": "Bedford trainer helps celebrity getting fighting fit\n\nThe weight loss of television star Hannah Waterman has become the toast of celebrity magazines thanks to a Bedford fitness coach. The transformation in the figure of the former Eastenders actress is down to the hard work and guidance of Bedford health trainer Adam Cochrane. Mr Cochrane who lives in Oaklands Road, Bedford, has trained the likes of Grey’s Anatomy star Kevin McKidd and Emily Atack who played Charlotte Hinchcliffe in hit TV show The Inbetweeners. He works as a personal fitness trainer full time.\n\nMr Cochrane said: “I was very pleased with how Hannah’s training went and she was at an incredible level of fitness by the end.\n\n“I was asked to train Hannah for the fitness DVD when the first trainer got injured at the beginning of filming, by the end of filming she had lost two and a half stones.”\n\nMr Cochrane visited Ms Waterman at her home in Great Staughton, which she shares with Eastenders and Strictly Come Dancing star Ricky Groves. Some other sessions for the DVD were filmed at the home of Ms Waterman’s father Minder star Dennis Waterman. Mr Cochrane said: “The whole experience was a great one and off the back of this I am organising some fitness sessions in Bedford Park so that people can train with me in the same way as Hannah.”\n\n17 December 2009 By Hayley O’Keeffe"
