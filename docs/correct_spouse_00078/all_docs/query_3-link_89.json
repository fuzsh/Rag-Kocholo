Benedict himself was an apprentice, bound by indentured servitude to his mother's cousins, the Lathrop Brothers. His father was suffering from alcohol-induced dementia, believed caused by his sadness over losing four children: Absolom, Elizabeth, Mary, and an earlier son named Benedict, who died an infant in 1739. The children are all buried here. ...\n\n... Local citizens, outraged at the treasonous act [by Benedict Arnold], descended as a mob on this cemetery and removed the gravestones of the father, Benedict, and the infant son, Benedict.\n\nThe only epitaph that remains is to Hannah King Arnold:\n\nIN MEMORY oF Hannah ye well beloved Wife of Capt Benedict Arnold & Daughter of Mr John & Elizabeth Watermen, (She was a Pattern of Piety Patience and Virtue) who died Augst 15th 1759 AEtatis Suae 52"
