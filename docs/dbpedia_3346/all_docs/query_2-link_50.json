Dear Father of Susan (Bruce) Roosen, Brian (Kristine) Lambrecht, Karen (Tom) Gartley, Kevin (Dawn) Lambrecht, Patricia (Bill) Rounds, Sharon (Mike) Brown and Jennifer Lambrecht.

Brother in law of John “Jack” ( Sandie) Klein and James “Jim” Klein. Special Uncle of John (Jamie) Klein and Bradley (Alicia) Klein.\n\nRonnie was born April 9th, 1933 in Detroit, Michigan. Ronnie served in the United States Army for 4 years. When he returned home he met Rosalie and they married soon after. They went on to have 7 children and raised them much of the time in Warren. It was one Sunday drive that Ronnie and Rosalie found the perfect home in Fenton. The family took many camping trips together and were members of Waldenwoods for over 20 years. Ronnie was a talented mason and was always looking for projects or places he could improve with brick. He was a member of the Brick Layers Local 2, MI and also belonged to bowling leagues and the Knights of Columbus. He loved to tinker in his barn and would tie fishing lures and enjoyed many wood working projects, including bird houses and carvings. Ronnie raised multiple Boston Terriers through the years, leaving his special Boston, Yoda, who stayed faithfully by his side.\n\nA Funeral Mass will be held on Tuesday, January 24, 11am at St. John’s Catholic Church, 600 North Adelaide St., Fenton. Friends may visit at Temrowski Family Funeral Home, 500 Main St., Fenton, on Monday, January 23, 4-8pm with the Rosary prayed at 7pm. Visitation will also be on Tuesday 10am until the time of service, at the church. Interment will be at Great Lakes National Cemetery, Holly.
