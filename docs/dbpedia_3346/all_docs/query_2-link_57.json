He was a proud graduate of the 10th grade at Fenton High School. He married Ella Conrad on February 19, 1949 in Fenton and she preceded him in death on August 25, 1997. On April 15, 2005 he married Diane Sheldon. Rick was a lifelong member of St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church, the Michigan Harness Racing Association, The Kiwanis Club, Michigan Press Association, Fenton Chamber of Commerce and Spring Meadows Country Club. An avid football player, coach and fan, Rick played semi-pro football for the Fenton Independents and the Flint Sabres, and was invited to a tryout for halfback for the Detroit Lions in 1950, where he was regretfully told \"your legs are too skinny.\" Early in the fifties he became the Police Commissioner of Linden, in addition to owning and operating the Linden Leader newspaper. Rick was a prolific business owner and operator. After selling the Linden Leader, he moved to Fenton in the late 1950s and created his second newspaper, the Tri-County Advertiser, which later became the Tri-County News. He and partner Dean Moore built the Fenton Mini-Mall, and owned and operated Valley Furniture. In 1994 Rick started the Tri-County Times, which today provides nearly 80 jobs for area residents. He was also part owner of Rockman Communications, Tri-County Wireless and Rockman and Sons Publishing. One of Rick's hobbies was owning and wagering on race horses, especially Rambling Ronnie, his record-setting pacer. Rick authored the popular newspaper column, Straight from the Shoulder, for over 30 years. Surviving are: wife, Diane; 5 children, Richard Rockman, Jr. and wife Karen of Fenton, Craig Rockman and wife Bethany of Fenton, Deborah Rockman of Grand Rapids, Lisa Branham of Fenton, Ron Rockman of Boynton Beach, FL and special friend, Robert \"Flash\" Gordon; 12 grandchildren and 19 great grandchildren; sister, Glenda Smith and husband Russell; 2 brothers, Harold Rockman and Roy Rockman and wife Debbie; sisters-in-law, Barb MacLennan and Rosalind Oberheim and husband Skip; He was preceded in death by his parents; sons, Randall John Rockman and Glenn Rockman; brother, Raymond Rockman.
