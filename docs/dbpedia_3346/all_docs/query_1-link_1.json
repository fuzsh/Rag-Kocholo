        "text": "RON FENTON\n\n1940 - 2013\n\nSouth Shields-born Ronnie Fenton started his playing career in his home town before he was snapped up by then First Division side Burnley, initially joining them as a junior in 1956. He signed professional for them the following year and went on to spend five years at Turf Moor before making a £15,000 move to The Hawthorns in November 1962.\n\nThe hard working inside-forward made his Baggies debut in a 2-2 draw with West Ham United at Upton Park in December 1962. He went on to make 66 appearances for Albion, scoring 18 goals.\n\nHe left The Hawthorns in January 1965, joining local rivals Birmingham City for a £7,500 fee. He spent three years at St Andrews before moving onto Brentford and then Notts County.\n\nAfter he retired from playing in 1971, Fenton moved into coaching with County, becoming manager in 1975. After two years as boss at Meadow Lane he made the short move across the City to become a coach at Nottingham Forest. In 1987, after ten years at Forest, he became assistant manager to the legendary Brian Clough. When Cloughie left the role in May 1993 Fenton followed him out of the City Ground.\n\nAfter leaving Forest, Fenton had a spell coaching in Malta as well as taking up a scouting role for England."
