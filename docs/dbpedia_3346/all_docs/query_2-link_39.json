        "text": "Thelma Judith Fenton was born on the Dutch Caribbean Island of Curaçao on March 8, 1952. She was the eldest child of William A. Daley and Lucille E. Daley. She affectionately went by her middle name “Judith” among her family and close friends. She spent her early childhood to teenage years on the islands of Nevis, Montserrat, and St. Croix.\n\nJudith moved to the United States in 1970 at the age of 18, where she pursued a career as an Operating Room Technologist. She worked at major hospitals in Massachusetts including, Mount Auburn Hospital, Tufts Medical Center, and New England Baptist Hospital, where she touched the lives of many. Judith also had a successful greeting card business named Thelma’s Markings, where she created and sold personalized cards. She will be remembered for her remarkable work ethic and her passion for helping others.\n\nIn addition to her professional endeavors and family life, Judith, was an active member of her church organizations, the Women of St. Cyprian’s Episcopal Church (ECW) and the Vestry at the Church of the Epiphany in Cape Coral, Florida. She volunteered her time and talents with them generously. She would often make her famous ginger beer for church events. One of her favorite pastimes was cooking and entertaining her friends and family. She often referred to the kitchen as her “office.”\n\nIn 1976, Judith married Ronald, with whom she shared 47 years of profound love and companionship. They accomplished so much together, building a life in Boston where they lived for 31 years before moving to Florida where they spent the last 17 years. Judith was the beloved mother to Nadia and Christal, imparting wisdom, guidance, and unconditional love at every turn. She took great pride in her children's accomplishments and cherished every moment spent with them. She was known to tell random people in passing that she had a daughter who was a lawyer and the one worked in marketing at Harvard University.\n\nJudith was a fighter, she battled kidney disease since she was 34 and required intensive dialysis treatments three times per week. In 1997 she received a kidney transplant which successfully lasted for 19 years. Once the transplant ran its course, Judith once again resumed dialysis treatments in 2016. She was a devoted wife and mother, always putting her family's needs above her own. Judith was known for her kindness, playful spirit, and unwavering dedication to her family, friends, and community.\n\nShe is survived by her loving husband Ronald Fenton, daughters Nadia Fenton-Rahim (Sean), Christal Fenton-Fortes (Robert), and grandchildren Noah Abdur Rahim, Samira Abdur Rahim and Riley Fortes. She is also survived by her siblings Dr. William Daley, Joan Pereira, Carol Daley, Glenn Daley, Roy Daley, Mary Liburd, James Daley, Kathleen Daley, Camela Daley and many nieces, nephews, cousins, and a host of dear friends. She will be deeply missed by all who had the privilege of knowing her.\n\nThough her physical presence is no longer with us, Judith will live on in the hearts and memories of those who loved her dearly. May she rest in eternal peace."
