        "text": "Alana Michelle Fenton OBITUARY\n\nIt is with great sadness that Alana’s family shares the news of her passing on May 25th 2023. She was born at French Hospital, San Francisco, CA on May 24th 1975. Alana is survived by her partner, Robert Lewis, and their twelve-year-old son, James Lewis, Novato, CA; her father, Ron Fenton, Santa Rosa, CA; her mother, Marilyn, Fenton, Kentfield, CA; her brother, Shane (Toni) Fenton, and niece, Vita Fenton, Kentfield, CA; her sister, Alissa (Jeff) Pearce, and nieces, Jaymee Pearce, Sonoma, CA, and Hayden Pearce, San Diego, CA; her uncle, Larry (Mary) Fenton, Fuquay Varina, NC; and James’ grandparents, Bob and Judith Lewis, Novato, CA.Alana enjoyed summer vacations in Missouri visiting her grandparents, Bert and Dollie Fenton, and Bud and Voncile Black, who preceded her in death. She had fond memories of the good times spent there with her many cousins and other relatives and friends.Alana lived in Kentfield during her childhood, and attended schools in the Kentfield and Tamalpais Districts, and the College of Marin. She always loved reading books and writing, and enjoyed performing as a dancer and rhythmic gymnast when she was young. Most of her adult career was centered around computers, the internet, and computer games, whether it was testing web sites, managing testers, editing college textbooks, or writing reviews of computer games.What Alana loved most was cooking, knitting, and spending time with her family and beloved dog, Bodie. She loved life, and lived every day to the fullest, despite her long battle with diabetes and kidney disease. Her vibrant personality and eternal optimism will be remembered by all who were fortunate to have known her and loved her. A private celebration of Alana’s life will be held by her family.Assisted by Monte’s Chapel of the Hills, San Anselmo, CA."
