Included is a brief description of each office in the Reagan White House and a list of personnel for that office. This is not a comprehensive list of all White House Office personnel, it is mainly staff members who have a collection at the Reagan Library.\n\nAdministrative Office, White House\n\nThis office was responsible for the administrative affairs for the White House and the White House staff. Throughout most of the administration the Head of Operations/Administrative Office was also the Director of the Office of Administration – a federal agency working at the White House. Therefore, some federal records are intermixed with presidential records in these collections.\n\nSee collection entries for:\n\nAdministrative Office, Office of Operations\n\nLamb, Jean\n\nUbbens, Betty\n\nWhite, Richard\n\nAdvance, Office of Presidential\n\nThis office was responsible for the logistical planning and coordination, including onsite arrangements, of the President’s domestic and international trips.\n\nSee collection entries for:\n\nAdvance, Office of Presidential: Events and Briefing Books\n\nAdvance, Office of Presidential: Photo File\n\nAdvance, Office of: Presidential Site Surveys and Misc.

The Asian Affairs Directorate was one of the five geographical directorates created.

The Office of Cabinet Affairs acted as the liaison and facilitator between various agencies and the White House. In the first administration, the office was heavily involved in making the seven cabinet councils work - scheduling meetings, pursuing action plans, and so forth. In conjunction with the Counsellor to the President’s office, Cabinet Affairs created a detailed tracking system for issues before the Cabinet and the various Cabinet Councils. These issues were marked as \"CM-#\" and you will find frequent reference to this tracking system within the records of the Office of Cabinet Affairs and the Counsellor to the President. While Cabinet Affairs handled the Cabinet issue tracking and worked with agencies, the actual Cabinet Council secretaries were from the Office of Policy Development.\n\nDuring the second administration, the Councils were reduced to two - the Domestic Policy Council and the Economic Policy Council - and were an actual part of the Cabinet Affairs office. In early 1985, the head of this office was renamed the Cabinet Secretary. There are no actual records for an Office of the Cabinet Secretary - just material for the individuals with this title, Al Kingon and Nancy Risque.\n\nSee collection entries for:\n\nCabinet Affairs, White House Office of\n\nClarey, Donald\n\nDavis, Richard A.\n\nDunlop, Becky Norton\n\nFaoro, Patsy\n\nFuller, Craig\n\nGibson, Thomas\n\nHall, John\n\nHauptli, Todd\n\nHerbolsheimer, Lawrence\n\nHodapp, Nancy “Missy”\n\nKuttner, Hanns\n\nNeuman, David\n\nPreston, Edward F.\n\nStucky, Edward\n\nCabinet Secretary\n\nSee collection entries for:\n\nKingon, Alfred\n\nRisque, Nancy\n\nChief of Staff, White House Office of the\n\nConsidered by many to be the most powerful position in a modern White House, the Chief of Staff during the Reagan administration acted as a close advisor to the President and was responsible for the smooth operation of the White House. During the first administration, Chief of Staff James A. Baker was part of a senior staff triumvirate with the Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver and the Counsellor to the President Edwin Meese. This group came to be known as “the Troika.” In the second administration, Donald T. Regan (1985-87), Howard H. Baker (1987-88), and Kenneth Duberstein (1988-89) served as Chief of Staff.\n\nSee collection entries for:\n\nBaker, Howard H., Jr.\n\nBaker, James A.\n\nCicconi, James\n\nCrippen, Daniel L.\n\nDarman, Richard\n\nDawson, Thomas C.\n\nDuberstein, Kenneth\n\nHodsoll, Francis (Frank)\n\nOglesby, M.B.\n\nRegan, Donald\n\nThomas W. Dennis\n\nTuck, John C.\n\nTutwiler, Margaret\n\nCommunications, White House Office of\n\nThis office was largely an umbrella White House office over the offices of speechwriting, media relations, public affairs, public liaison, and the press office, although the mix varied somewhat during the eight years of the Reagan presidency. The primary function of this office was to ensure that the White House staff was consistent in dealing with the media, and that the White House had a focused message. From January 1984 to February 1985 the Communications office was downgraded to a unit within the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, allowing Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver direct oversight of communications during the 1984 campaign season.\n\nSee collection entries for:\n\nBailey, Pamela\n\nBistany, Joanna\n\nBuchanan, Patrick\n\nCommunications, White House Office of\n\nGergen, David\n\nGriscom, Thomas C.\n\nMaseng, Mari\n\nOlsen, Karen\n\nReid, Kathleen\n\nConsumer Affairs, White House Office of\n\nThis office advised the President on a wide variety of consumer-related issues. Virginia Knauer, the chief White House consumer advisor for Presidents Nixon and Ford (1969-1977), performed this same role for President Reagan. From 1981 to 1983 she worked within the White House Office of Public Liaison, and dealt with public liaison outreach in addition to consumer issues. After Elizabeth Dole resigned as director of the Public Liaison Office in 1983, Consumer Affairs was upgraded to a separate White House office headed by Knauer. Knauer also served as Director of the US Office of Consumer Affairs, a unit within the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nSee collection entry for:\n\nKnauer, Virginia\n\nCoordination Office, National Security Council\n\nThis office primarily provided planning and coordination assistance to the President for head of state and foreign official visits, as well as other international meetings in which the President participated.\n\nSee collection entries for:\n\nCoordination Office, NSC\n\nDeal, Timothy\n\nTyson, Charles P.\n\nCorrespondence, Office of White House\n\nThis office coordinated the distribution of incoming mail to the White House, and in many cases the Correspondence Office staff also prepared and sent responses.

Mr. Meese coordinated and developed domestic policy issues and programs, although foreign and defense policy issues were also a focus during the first year of the Administration. Mr. Meese was familiar with the President’s style of government and system of management from experience as Governor Reagan’s chief of staff in California. The management of cabinet communication and coordination was part of his office function during the first year of the administration, and his office remained heavily involved with the Office of Cabinet Affairs and the Cabinet Council system. The collections for this office are for his direct staff and cover the first administration only. In early 1985, Mr. Meese left the White House to become Attorney General of the United States.\n\nSee collection entries for:\n\nCribb, T.
