        "text": "March 14, 2008\n\nLEWISBURG, Pa. - Bucknell head football coach Tim Landis has announced that 30 student-athletes will join the Bison program for the 2008 season. This diverse recruiting class features athletes from 15 different states and provinces, including eight in-state recruits, and it includes players from every position with a focus on the offensive and defensive lines.\n\n\"I am very excited about this year's recruiting class,\" said Landis. \"Our coaching staff is to be commended for a great job of national recruiting. They stayed patient throughout the process, and overall I feel that we have addressed our needs.\n\n\"The biggest concern going into the recruiting period was on the offensive and defensive lines,\" offered Landis, who also said that he expects to announce a few more key additions to this class in the coming weeks. \"Although we were a very young football team last year, most of the seniors who did play key roles were linemen, and [sophomore First Team All-Patriot League defensive end] Josh Eden will be going off to serve his mission. So we are very excited about the quality and depth we were able to recruit at those positions.\"\n\nThe biographies on the members of the Class of 2012 include a long laundry list of all-conference, all-state and all-academic accolades. Of the 30 incoming student-athletes, Landis and his staff project 14 to play on offense and 14 on defense, in addition to two kickers. Four recruits are quarterbacks: Burke Batten from Coffee High School in Douglas, Ga.; Matt Harbin of Grapevine High School in Colleyville, Texas; C.J. Hopson form Patuxent High School in Lusby, Md.; and David Noshay from Douglas High in Parkland, Fla.\n\n\"In addition to the outstanding young linemen, we have added quality depth at other positions,\" noted Landis. \"At quarterback we needed to bring in good candidates, and all four are capable of competing very early for playing time.\"\n\nAmong the Pennsylvania recruits are two from the Harrisburg area (Ryan Boyer of Millersburg and Carson Rohrbaugh of LeMoyne), two from Hazleton Area High School (Al Cabrejos and Drew Orth), and one from Lancaster in Robert De La Rosa, a former teammate of current Bison linebacker Sam Nana-Sinkam at Manheim Township High School.\n\nBucknell's returning players begin spring practice on Saturday, March 29, with the annual spring intrasquad scrimmage scheduled for Saturday, April 26 at 10 a.m. at Christy Mathewson-Memorial Stadium.\n\nBUCKNELL FOOTBALL 2008 RECRUITING CLASS\n\nName Pos.
