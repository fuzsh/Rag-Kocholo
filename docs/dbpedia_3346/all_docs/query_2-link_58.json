He was born April 3, 1938 in Clairton a son of the late Edward and Anna Schneider Fenton.\n\nRuss had worked for US Steel and the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. He was a natural athlete who was considered \"one of the best natural athletes\" to come out of Clairton. For over fourteen years he had volunteered for the Salvation Army. Many of his enjoyments came from watching his grandchildren play sports, keeping his yard meticulously groomed, his boxer dogs and all dogs who were naturally attracted to him.\n\nIn addition to his parents he was preceded in death by a son Eric Fenton.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Carol Novak Fenton, his son Russell C. Fenton of Ligonier, his daughter Susan Fenton (Rich Hooper) of Murrysville, step son Phil Krivacek (Ixiim) of St. Augustine, Florida, a step daughter Patricia Tonks (Ron) of Unity Township, his brother Gary Fenton of Washington, PA and seven grandchildren; Simon, Leigha, John, Blaine, Quintin, Tyler and Rebecca and seven great grandchildren.\n\nAs per his wishes all services were to be private.\n\nMcCabe Funeral Home, 144 East Main Street, Ligonier was in charge of arrangements.\n\nOnline condolences may be made to www.mccabefuneralhomespa.com."
