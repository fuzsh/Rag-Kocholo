        "text": "To Gov. Mike Parson and the members of the General Assembly,\n\nMissouri’s business community strongly urges legislative action to address the child care crisis in our state.\n\nChild care is not just an issue for working parents; it’s an economic issue. A 2021 study revealed that a lack of available child care is costing Missouri’s economy $1.35 billion annually, including $280 million in lost tax revenue. Additionally, when responding to the Missouri Chamber’s 2023 CEO Survey, 80 percent of business leaders said the expense and difficulty in finding child care keeps a significant number of Missourians out of the workforce.\n\nThe business community supports legislation, including HB 1488 (Shields) and SB 742 (Arthur), to address our workforce shortages through innovative child care solutions that will grow Missouri’s labor pool and help child care providers increase capacity.\n\nIt’s crucial that we work together to ensure Missouri families have access to reliable, affordable child care and businesses have the workforce they need."
