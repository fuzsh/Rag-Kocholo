        "text": "Lynda Lee (Bryner) Fenton returned home to her Heavenly Father on August 27th 2023 just shy of her 80th birthday.\n\nLynda was born on November 15th 1943, to Clifford and Barbara (Fairholm) Bryner in Salt Lake City, Utah. She was the oldest of 5 children.\n\nShe was extremely bright and excelled in school. She had impeccable grades, had won recognition in the high school science fair, and was often considered the teacher’s pet. She attended Highland High school the first 6 years after it opened, where her husband and later, their children attended as well. If there was something she was struggling with, she was quick to track down books on the topic or locate a class to learn all she could.\n\nShe earned a bachelor’s degree in nursing from the University of Utah and worked as an RN for most of her life. Early in her career she worked in health clinics and pediatrics. Her choice for the bulk of her career she chose to work at the University of Utah Hospital recovery. Where she was likely the last person you saw before when you had surgery.\n\nLynda married Mark Fenton in the Salt Lake Temple in 1969. They always considered themselves a good team and were both very hardworking. Both were extremely talented in multiples areas. Lynda and Mark both lived most of their lives in the Sugarhouse area of Salt Lake City, until they built their home in Clinton and moved there in 2003.\n\nShe has been a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints where she served in many capacities over the years. Her testimony was her most valued attribute. She loved to share it and do things that would help to strengthen her understanding and relationship with her father in heaven.\n\nLynda belonged to a dinner group that has met regularly for over 50 years and have been some of her closest friends. She recently joined a book club that she enjoyed and were her newest valued friendships.\n\nShe loved genealogy and family stories. She did lots of research for genealogy purposes in the days before computers made that easier. She later spent many hours indexing for the LDS church.\n\nShe was an avid and skilled crafter. Some of her many talents included sewing, crocheting, and quilting though, she would try anything once. She would never idly sit around. She was always multi-tasking. If not in her craft room, she would be crocheting while others sat and visited.\n\nHer top love of crafting was in miniatures. She served in, organized, and led several clubs and luncheons over the years. Miniatures appealed to her because it demanded precision and beauty. Miniatures was also a good social outlet.\n\nShe was generous in time and money. When she was unable to help with something physically, she figured she could at least buy everyone lunch. She regularly gave to causes anonymously. She was compassionate and sympathetic and had a good listening ear.\n\nLynda cared greatly for her children. Her entire life was a series of sacrifices to ensure her kids had what they needed, to provide a sense of security, and to assure that they knew they were loved.\n\nShe is survived by her children Jennifer Fulton (Ron), Jeremy Fenton, and Jim Fenton. Her grandson Joshua Fulton. Her siblings Janis (John) Bohling, Doug (Susan) Bryner, and Pat Bryner. She is preceded in death by her husband Mark, her parents Cliff & Barbara Bryner, and her brother Gary Bryner.\n\nThank you to all who have loved and helped care for our mother in various ways over the years.\n\nWe love her and will miss her dearly.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Saturday September 2nd at 11:00 am at the LDS meetinghouse at 2841 W. 1300 N. in Clinton, Utah. A viewing will be held at the church prior to the service from 9:00 – 10:30. Interment will be at the Clinton City Cemetery (813 North 750 West Clinton, UT 84015)"
