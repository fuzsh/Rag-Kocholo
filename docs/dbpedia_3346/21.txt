Ronnie Fenton scored as the Clarets, then defending English champions, beat Bolton Wanderers 2-0 at Turf Moor on their way to fourth place in Division One in 1961.

He also featured six times the following season when Harry Potts’ men finished in second place to confirm their status as one of the powerhouses of the game.

He never really established himself in a first team that included greats like Andy Lochhead, Jimmy McIlroy and Jimmy Robson during his five years at Turf Moor and moved to West Brom in 1962.

After retiring from the game, the South Shields-born Fenton managed Notts County for two years before crossing the city to become Brian Clough’s assistant at Nottingham Forest, where he spent 16 years.

Fenton died yesterday, aged 73.
