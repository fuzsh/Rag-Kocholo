        "text": "Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to determine the materials cited in doctoral theses of botany, submitted to the Kuvempu University during the years 2000-2006, with the aim of improving the existing collection development of the library. Design/methodology/approach – The study employed descriptive research design. Theses submitted for the award of Doctoral degree from 2000 to 2006 to the Department of Botany, Kuvempu University were examined. The population of the study was all the theses submitted during the periods under study. Data were extracted from title page and references given at the end of each chapter. Extracted data were analysed using statistics. Findings – The study reveals that journals are the most preferred sources of information used by the researchers in the field of botany, accounting for 74.77 per cent of total citations, although citations from books, proceedings, theses, reports and patents are also found. It is also observed those researchers are not taking much advantage of internet resources. The journal Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture (USA) was ranked the first, with 158 citations, accounting for 7.57 per cent of the total journal citations. Further, Bradford’s law of scattering was applied. It is observed that major citations come from journal literature. In addition, more cited materials were contributed by multi authors and degree of collaboration is 0.75. Research limitations/implications – The paper presents a sense of the importance of botany research, and as such informs that community, as well as researchers involved in citation analysis. Originality/value – The outcome of the study is an original research work with citation analysis of doctoral theses in botany. It highlights the information materials available and used by researchers of the Botany Department for their research work and those which need to be added for a healthy collection.\n\nThe Thomson Reuters marketing tool, the Impact Factor ® (IF), is currently the only global quantitative system of assessing the impact (indirectly the quality) of a journal (therein the manuscript and the authors associated with it), solely as a function of referencing and/or indexing frequency. Despite its simplistic brilliance, as for any other monopolistic system in any sector of society, the IF is now beginning to have profound (negative) effects on how science is being selected, funds are being allocated and this in turn is driving science in an unnatural way, not driven any longer by core scientific values and principles, but rather by the inherent (implicit and explicit) benefits underlying the IF score of a scientific journal. This survey aspired to ascertain the notions that exist among plant scientists (n = 162) regarding the IF and how this system of quality assessment in the bio-medical sciences affects their way of conducting science and the niche in which they work and study. Twelve questions were posed and respondents could respond online with the possibility of also freely adding any additional comments. Except for one question, all other questions stowed an extremely polarized response, with 10/11 questions showing a YES: NO response ratio of  7:3. Almost all respondents (93%) had published in an IF journal, and 72% supported the IF. Of all respondents, 60% were made to (= forced by implicit or explicit rules and regulations) publish in an IF journal. Just over half of all respondents (51%) are compensated for publishing in an IF journal while a shocking amount (70%) are reprimanded, or suffer some form of negative consequence (by their Department, Institute, Funding Agency or Government) should they not publish in an IF journal. 73% of respondents felt that the IF should not be held in the hands of a media company or publisher (i.e., Thomson Reuters) and 91% felt that they had the right to know how an IF is assigned and calculated and to freely request the IF of any publication from any year, i.e. the IF history of a journal. Even though 85% felt that an alternative system to the IF was required, only 24% knew of such a system, although most of these were local and not global, or had their inherent problems and limitations. Closely related to the IF, most (70%) respondents felt that print versions of journals were still important, 94% felt that publication of a manuscript should be free, while 80% felt that papers should be Open Access. Without a doubt, the IF is here to stay. However, the great displeasure, exhibited by 91% of respondents who felt that an alternative system of quantitative measurement is required, points towards a desperate need for the (plant) scientific community to act towards countering the monopolistic activities of a single company, Thomson Reuters, by providing one or more competitive, alternative systems of assessing and quantifying the quality of science.\n\nThe present study attempts to analyze the publication productivity of the \"Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science\" during the year 2000-2019. The study was based on the data extracted from the Web of Science database. The primary purpose of the study is to analyze the research contributions of the journal under review. Through this investigation, the authors have tried to know the publication trend in the field of agronomy and related areas. The analysis covers the number of articles, year-wise distribution of articles along with citations, authorship pattern, institutions/organizations with the highest contributions, and the study also gives year-wise h-index of the journal. The study reveals that the journal understudy had produced a total of 1077 research articles. The publications have received 22,328 citations with which the said journal reached h-index of 63. Average citation per paper is 22.65, and journal impact factor 2020 is 3.094, which falls under quartile 1 (Q1) category journal. The highest number of contributions were from Germany (142 articles) and The United States (141 articles). Further, the study adopts Lotka’s Inverse Square Law of Scientific Productivity to find the recurrence of contributions of authors in agronomy and its related areas. The authors have also used the Journal Citation Report (JCR) to know the impact factor of the journal, and VOSviewer tool was used to represent the results of the study graphically.\n\nBradford's law is about scattering of literature in different information sources on a narrow subject. The present paper aims at analysing the research output performance of botany literature. Citation analysis of all the journal articles published in the Botany literature was covered in Web of Science (on-line version database) for the period of 2005-2014. A total of 12051 references were cited in 1183 articles in 572 journals. The study elaborates on various bibliometric components such as distribution of citations for document type, language wise distribution of citations, and country wise publication of citations. Further, the study also lists the most productivity journals in the field of Botany Literature. The analysis of the results show that out of 12051 citations, research articles (61.96%) contribute the highest number of citations and it is the most preferred sources of information used by researchers in the field of botany. The USA is the most cited country in the world and the English language is the most preferred language in the world. Bradford's law well fitted into the given data set for the present study. Finally, it can be concluded that, the significant research activity is taking place in the area of botany and it is one of the emerging research field in the biological sciences."
