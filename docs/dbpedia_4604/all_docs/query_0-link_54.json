        "meta_description": "Scholars of American empire are overdue for critical scholarship on the secret U.S. documents that Chelsea Manning sent to WikiLeaks in 2010. The documents feature important information about the role of the United States in the world, but few scholars have investigated what the documents reveal about the structures and operations of American empire. This paper proposes two ways for scholars of American empire to begin incorporating the documents into their research. First, this paper calls for recognition of a field of study called American empire studies. Scholars have been conducting research on empire for over a century, but they have not organized a field of study that is needed for critical scholarship, such as work with the WikiLeaks documents. Second, this paper identifies a method of analysis called the critical diplomatic history method. Several works of critical scholarship provide lessons for how scholars can use the critical diplomatic history method to examine the WikiLeaks documents. By identifying a field of study and a method of analysis, this paper makes the case that scholars can work with the WikiLeaks documents to reveal hidden imperial structures, generate momentum for dismantling the American empire, and empower social movements that are working to create a better world.",

        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n9 With these two major challenges in mind, I propose a pathway forward. First, I make the case for the existence of American empire studies. I begin by showing that the field has a long history, despite its unacknowledged existence and lack of institutional structure. I review several junctures in the field’s development. A crucial part of my review highlights lesser-known works, such as the overlooked but foundational scholarship of Scott Nearing. I believe that Nearing should be recognized as one of the early developers of American empire studies. Other parts of my review will be more familiar to scholars of American empire. I cover Indigenous critiques of empire, the notion of a Greater United States, W. E. B. Du Bois’s critique of the expansion of the color line, the geopolitics of empire, the scholarship of the Wisconsin School of diplomatic history, American hegemony in a capitalist world system, and cultures of U.S. imperialism. One development that I emphasize is the growth of work on American empire in the early twenty-first century. Much recent work has conceptualized the United States as an empire of military bases. Finally, I highlight the importance of the work of Noam Chomsky, who has done more than any other scholar to critically assess the main features and operations of American empire. My review is not a comprehensive survey of American empire studies, but it showcases an interconnected set of works to confirm the field’s existence.\n\n2. American Empire Studies\n\n3. The Critical Diplomatic History Method\n\n27 Fortunately, there is a pathway forward. Even as scholars of American empire face significant challenges to working with the WikiLeaks documents, especially due to the lack of institutions in the field of American empire studies, existing strands of the field provide helpful guidance. The field features strong scaffolding from scholarship that has already received widespread attention, with the work of the Wisconsin School being a key starting point. The scholars of the Wisconsin School conducted much of their research with materials that are comparable to the WikiLeaks documents, such as government records and diplomatic correspondence. Other scholars, including Nearing, Beard, and Chomsky, have produced critical works that provide additional guidance. These scholars developed methods for critically assessing recent events in world affairs to inform the public about U.S. imperial practices and reveal structures of oppression that should be dismantled. To apply their methods to the WikiLeaks documents, all that is required is recalling their work and identifying its principles. Their work forms the basis for the critical diplomatic history method.\n\n32 With these few key works in mind, it is easy to identify a method of analysis for the WikiLeaks documents. The basic principles are clear and straightforward. The critical diplomatic history method begins with case studies for which there is sufficient source material for exposing the violent structures and operations of American empire. Scholars can use case studies to empower anti-war movements, just as Chomsky did with his critical examination of the Pentagon Papers. In some cases, the WikiLeaks documents provide a strong enough basis for research. Another key aspect of the method is its use of sources in the public domain. Scholars can critically examine public archives to challenge establishment narratives and create openings for social movements to dismantle structures of oppression, just as past practitioners of critical diplomatic history have done. A large amount of material is easily accessible in the public domain, including transcripts of speeches, interviews, and congressional hearings. An additional feature of the method is its potential to strengthen the tools that scholars are already using to critically assess American empire. With scholars of American empire continuing to uncover transimperial formations, scholars who employ the critical diplomatic history method can reveal additional aspects of these transimperial structures. They can use the WikiLeaks cables to identify interrelated components that should be dismantled. Finally, and perhaps most important, the method serves the important purpose of informing the public about U.S. imperial practices. While documents such as the WikiLeaks files are important to scholarly inquiries, it is crucial that scholars use them in ways that empower social movements, create possibilities for dismantling the empire, and establish pathways to a better future. In all these ways, then, scholars can pull on past works of critical scholarship to revive a longstanding form of critical analysis that is readily available for examining the WikiLeaks files. As several works of critical scholarship demonstrate, the critical diplomatic history method can be a powerful tool in movements for social justice.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\n35 Scholars of American empire who practice critical diplomatic history can make important contributions to the field of American empire studies. Although the field has not been formalized, it would be greatly enriched by new investigations into the WikiLeaks documents. Scholars can study the documents to reconsider their longstanding questions about the American empire. One key question concerns the nature of the empire. If scholars of American empire hope to advance their field, then they must provide a working definition of American empire. More generally, scholars can use the WikiLeaks cables to uncover what U.S. imperialists have planned for the empire and the world. News reports and my own scholarship indicate that there is still much to learn about events that concern but are not limited to: colonialism, class relations, client states, economic forces, geopolitical planning, state terror, imperial grand strategy, wars of aggression, the power of big business, the techniques of American imperialism, the openings of doors to new markets, the relationship between capitalism and imperialism, American hegemony in a capitalist world system, the global network of U.S. military bases, the relationship between culture and empire, the imperial tropes that rationalize empire, the persistence of patriarchy, the problem of the color line, the idea of empire being a way of life, the consequences of the empire for the world, the ways in which the multitudes resist, the possibilities for dismantling the empire, and the ongoing efforts to create a better world. Scholars of American empire have been examining these issues for over a century, and there is no doubt that today’s generation of scholars can gain new insights from the hundreds of thousands of documents that Manning sent to WikiLeaks.\n\n37 As we are well on our way into a new decade, I believe that there remain significant opportunities for scholars of American empire to work with the WikiLeaks documents. This paper shows that an existing method is available for examining them. By identifying the critical diplomatic history method for the field of American empire studies, I have tried to clear a pathway for scholars of American empire to incorporate the documents into their research. Scholars who employ the critical diplomatic history method will be joining an ongoing effort to lift the veil of secrecy on the empire in the world. While it remains important for scholars to continue with their efforts to identify the ways in which the multitudes participate in transnational networks of resistance, more work must be done to understand how the empire continues to function in the face of this constant resistance. Rather than shifting the scholarship away from transimperial approaches, however, the critical diplomatic history method provides scholars with an additional tool in movements against empire. Works that employ the critical diplomatic history method will complement scholarship that seeks to identify structures of oppression with the goal of dismantling them. It is my hope that the critical diplomatic history method in the field of American empire studies will reveal hidden ways in which the empire operates, thereby creating new possibilities for inhibiting imperial violence, dismantling the empire, and building a better world."
