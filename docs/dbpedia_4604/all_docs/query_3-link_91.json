        "text": "The classical ideas of citizenship in Athens and Rome\n\nCities and local communities in medieval Europe developed their identity as the institutions and practices of citizenship flourished (Prak, 2018). In earlier centuries, the citizens of ancient Athens were proud of their own civic identity as members of their polis. The same can be said of the citizens of Rome. Practices and regulations that gave shape to citizenship were not static, their transformation was a consequence of the need to accommodate the functions of local corporations as emerging significant agents of economic activity and political significance vis-à-vis local autocratic powers. Socio-economic factors influenced the transformation of citizenship, such as the need to regulate the role of newcomers in cities and towns who worked in production and commercial activities or the need to accommodate and recognize the descendants of mixed marriages between citizens and non-citizens (Kapparis, 2005).\n\nTerritorial embeddedness of civic practices and legal institutionalization of citizenship may have been inspired by pre-modern philosophical conceptions of citizenship, first theorized by Plato and Aristotle. The Greek polis located the citizen at the centre of social, economic, and political life. Citizens in the political zenith of classical Athens were actively involved in the public life of the polis participating in the formulation of policy and in judicial processes. Civic virtue and civic education were transmitted in the dramatic performances in theatres in Greek city-states more than in the philosophical schools (Balot, 2017). The participation of women in Athenian democracy was highly restricted since they could not hold office and their legitimacy as citizens depended on their fathers and husbands. And yet, the procedures to acquire citizenship in Athens evolved to accommodate marriages and family stability by granting women citizenship.\n\nThe Hellenic philosophical traditions influenced the Republican ideas of Cicero. He treated civic education and civic pride as intrinsic aspects of Roman identity and citizenship. The res publica for Cicero was an expression of the institutional organization of the state, including laws and legal bodies. Compared with the Greek mode of citizenship, Roman citizenship was more expansive, granting equality before the law not only to the citizens of Rome. Territorial expansion meant that the provincial elites and free inhabitants of the empire benefited from Roman citizenship. In Roman society, women were considered citizens under the patronage of the pater familias, with few effective rights to actively participate in the institutions and in politics. Despite these advances, Roman republican citizenship was a question of privilege and far from democratic.\n\nThe republican ideas of citizenship travelled through time. Cicero’s ideas had a considerable influence on the rhetoric of Italian Humanism and Renaissance culture in Italian cities, where loyalty to the community and civitas impelled the expansion of citizenship as local civil associations gained strength and political power. In practice, bourgeois local agency in cities during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance was able to establish new, self-governed associations of citizens (Weber, 1958). The local institutionalization of citizenship was segmented and developed unevenly in terms of honour and status at the same time. When it comes to civic incorporation and integration of new members societies today still treat internal and external outsiders differently (Prak, 2018).\n\nThe global dimensions of citizenship\n\nAnother productive venue for research has been the global dimensions of citizenship. Seen globally, citizenship is part of a “birthright lottery” (Shachar, 2009). It is the accident of the birthplace which influences life chances and life conditions. Therefore, it makes a stark difference whether a person is born in Germany or Mali, and which country’s citizenship a person holds. One could further argue that the key institutional feature linking relatively lower material inequalities within wealthier countries and higher inequalities between countries is the exclusion of people from poorer countries by wealthier states. It is a process of large-scale social closure. Empirical studies show that location of birth or residence and citizenship makes a difference for life conditions. While in the late nineteenth century, around 1870, about 50 per cent of income differences, could be attributed to whether or not people owned the means of production, and about 20 per cent to location, that is, the country in which one was living, this relationship has almost reversed. In 2000, more than two-thirds of global income differences could be attributed to huge gaps in average income between countries, whereas the share attributed to class has declined considerably, to around a quarter (Milanović, 2012, 205). In other words, if we were to construct a global map of income inequality, showing where each household or individual stood vis-à-vis everyone else in the world (that is, combining information on within- and between-country inequality), the relative standing of each household or individual would be shaped in large part by whether they were born or lived in a poor or a wealthy state. This setup entails a “citizenship premium” for citizens of wealthier countries.\n\nThis “citizenship premium” has important consequences. It is very visible in the freedom to travel with or without a visa. While citizens of countries like the USA, Germany and the Netherlands, for example, can travel without a visa into 173 countries (see https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php), the opposite holds for citizens of Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Somalia, whose passport allows them to travel visa-free into a handful of countries only (2023).\n\nThe restrictions to cross-border mobility point to a broader puzzle: the relationship between national citizenship on the one hand and globally applicable human rights on the other hand. Ever since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948, these rights have increased in importance also in national legislation and practice. Basically, there is a human right to citizenship. The importance of human rights is clear for the status of both citizens and non-citizens alike. For the former, it has been the right to expressing various heterogeneities, such as religion, ethnic belonging, sexual orientation. For the latter, human rights have been crucial for instance in getting access to basic social rights, for example, the right to unionize and be employed according to basic and minimum work standards. More broadly, human rights are meant to apply also to all those who have no recourse to the full rights of citizenship. The lines between citizenship rights and human rights have thus blurred somewhat or, to put it more carefully, these rights refer to a continuum of rights attributed to full members all the way to non-members. More fundamentally, claims of citizens, non-citizens and people with in-between status such as “denizenship” (Hammar, 1990) are put forward as human rights. This has occurred from “above”, as when the International Labour Office (ILO) declared basic social rights as human rights, and from “below” by non-citizen refugees in immigration countries who claim to engage in “acts of citizenship” (Isin and Nielsen, 2008).\n\nWe can identify three main trends over the past two centuries in the development of citizenship which have contributed to the shape of citizenship (Kivisto and Faist, 2007). These are: first, expansion—through the continual inclusion of new groups within (nation) states; second, erosion—mainly the neo-liberal onslaught on democracy which has resulted in a decreasing political participation of members in the public sphere; and, third, extension—through the partial separation of the triad of state authority, state population, and state territory, and the overall transnationalization of social processes across and beyond states.\n\nCross-border migration as a challenge to citizenship and democracy\n\nA challenge for the expansion of citizenship has been cross-border migration. Transnational processes as regards the flows of goods, services, and above all humans, such as labour migrants and forced migrants, have turned into major issues of political contention in transit and destination states. Cross-border mobility has raised questions about inclusion into and exclusion from full membership in political communities. Many or even most international migrants are not—at least at the beginning—citizens of the country they move to. Not only is the acquisition of membership often a long and arduous process, but the public debates and political conflicts around migrant citizenship are indicative of broader trends in citizenship. Access of newcomers, such as migrants and refugees, to democracy and citizenship raises questions as regards the congruence of the collective of citizens on the one hand and the population in a state territory on the other hand. In order to achieve such a congruence, there are various forms of citizenship acquisition, such as citizenship by birth (ius soli, ius sanguinis) and by residence (ius domicilii). Challenges have arisen not only for destination states but also for emigration states with diaspora abroad. As to the immigration side, national states decide in a sovereign way whom they want to admit to their territory. Very important, a “paradox of democratic legitimacy” (Benhabib, 2004) arises in immigration states. It is the paradox of human rights on the one hand and sovereignty of nation states to admit: “There is not only a tension, but often an outright contradiction, between human rights declarations and states’ sovereign claims to control their borders as well as to monitor the quality and quantity of admittees” (Benhabib, 2004, 2). Once migrants have arrived or even settled in states of destination, liberal democracies adhering to some extent to the rule of law have to consider the human rights of non-citizens. For example, refugees are not to be sent back to countries of origin if there is the possibility of torture or even loss of life involved. This non-refoulement rule of the Geneva Convention (1951) is the lowest common denominator among states claiming to follow the rule of law. All of this means that certain rights are to be granted to non-citizens, albeit liberal democratic states can and do discriminate between members and non-members or partial members. As to the emigration side, efforts of states have increased over the past decades to link up with former citizens or keep emigrants as citizens by tolerating dual citizenship.\n\nSocial and political theorists begin to part company when it comes to specifying in what ways citizenship is presumed to be important for immigrant integration as well as the implications of migration for citizenship as a whole and vice versa, and to identifying the factors and changes that are thought to be transforming—for better or worse—the significance and character of citizenship in a migratory age. For example, for some political actors, citizenship is necessary to enable migrants to participate in the major fields of social life; for others, the acquisition of citizenship is the crowning conclusion of a process of successful social integration (Faist and Kivisto, 2008).\n\nCross-border migration calls into question two central assumptions of classical citizenship theory: first, the congruence between a state territory, people living in that territory, and state authority; and second, the homogeneity of the people mainly along characteristics such as nation. Regarding the latter, the ingenious formulation by T.H. Marshall (1950) of social citizenship being a historical class compromise between market results based on the principle of contract on the one hand, and the principle of status on the other hand in a solidarity collective called the nation has to be extended. Most important, regarding the assumption of relative homogeneity, there is now a heightened attention by citizenship theorists to the heterogeneity among people, and to an increasing diversity, that is, heterogeneous characteristics such as gender, religion, age, and others, which have become more salient socially and politically.\n\nMultiple and differentiated citizenship\n\nOne crucial extension of citizenship has pointed to new scales beyond the national. In a 1974 publication Raymond Aron questioned the possibility of a citizen being able to belong to several political entities at once (Aron, 1974). For him it was not conceivable to claim the right to citizenship and the rights of citizenship without assuming duties, such as military service. He raised questions that have been widely debated in the literature of citizenship. Aron’s question has been amply superseded by: (1) the possibility of acquiring dual citizenship; (2) the introduction of global citizenship and cosmopolitan citizenship as normative ideals and institutionalization by liberal international/transnational organizations, such as transnational courts (e.g. the European Court of Justice), instruments of international organizations (e.g. the Human Rights Conventions and the UN Human Development Index); (3) the advocacy of transnational social and political movements challenging the liberal credo from radical and transformative perspectives; (4) the constitution of European citizenship; (5) differentiated citizenship along heterogeneities such as class, age, gender, class, ethnicity, religion; and (6) environmental movements and ecological citizenship concerned with the loss of habitat.\n\nFirst, the most important form of transnational citizenship is dual citizenship. Dual citizenship is an institutionalized expression of cross-border social relations which may include ties to families and relatives, villages, urban neighbourhoods or even nations. Few states tolerated multiple citizenship in the 1950s; nowadays most states in both the Global North and the Global South accept that those eligible to naturalize do not need to renounce their original citizenship. In those countries accepting dual citizenship, the rates of migrants taking up citizenship of the country of residence tends to be higher than in states with restrictive regulations. This result is to be welcomed from the point of view of theory of democracy, as dual citizenship helps to close the gap between the demos on the one hand and the population residing in a state territory on the other hand. While dual citizenship may facilitate political participation in two or more countries, it is not a precondition for transnational politics. Mono-citizens are known to engage in politics after exiting their country of origin. Loyalty may not only lead to stay at home but may also result in exit, and—ultimately—voice exerted from the new country of residence (cf. Hirschman, 1970). Emigration countries usually seek to control their (former) citizens abroad, and may even use their “diaspora” in the frames of “soft diplomacy” to proclaim their vision as a “global nation” (cf. Bauböck and Faist, 2010).\n\nSecond, global citizenship and cosmopolitan citizenship refer to rights and obligations toward others on a global scale. Cosmopolitan citizenship also emphasizes acceptance and respect for diversity and pluralism. The quality of citizenship in these conceptualizations implies the existence of a “global community” in which membership is difficult to institutionalize. This has not impeded the proclamation by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights making rights universal. Since then, a majority of countries in the world have assumed a disposition for civic consciousness of broad global issues such as environmental justice and poverty reduction. Of course, there are reactions to globalization and cosmopolitan narratives. The return of nationalism is one of them. This was foreseen by Parekh (2003, 12), who pointed out that a citizen identity of such a global community would be impractical and probably not desirable because it “ignores ties and attachment” to one’s own community. Globalization has provided opportunities for many at home and abroad but has failed to ensure social cohesion.\n\nThird, transnational political movements opposing the liberal credo have questioned the effectiveness of national systems of citizenship. The same goes for international organizations (United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), OECD). New waves of activists and some academics argue that the era of rights has failed, together with the era of progress with international organizations (Moyn, 2018). Indeed, a new interpretative “paradigm” has developed that links world inequalities with historical colonialism and imperialism (Sadiq, 2017).\n\nFourth, the Maastricht Treaty enshrined the constitution of European citizenship and made it legally binding. Union citizenship entails the supranational institutionalization of the three historical elements of citizenship—rights, access, and belonging—as defined by T.H. Marshall. However, in the absence of an EU state, it is the individual member states which decide who is a citizen of the Union. This has not prevented a proliferation of civil, social, and political rights beyond the boundaries of each society. One example is social benefits due to citizens residing in a country different from their country of origin. Another is the European public sphere in which transnational political civic and political organizations operate. EU citizenship has often been seen as an example of top-down institutionalization of citizenship. A complementary approach argues that the interplay between citizenship practices exercised historically by political actors and the opportunities for institutionalization have made possible an expansion of rights through incremental changes introduced by consensus (Wiener, 1998).\n\nFifth, differentiated citizenship has emerged as an interpretative foil. Two simultaneous processes are at work here. On the one hand we see erosion of citizenship, and on the other extension of citizenship along markers of difference between groups. This is different from the discussion of post-national and transnational citizenship which has emphasized the convergence of citizenship and human rights. Rather, the debates around differentiated citizenship emerged in a liberal world order which tolerates or even furthers “identity politics”, while at the same time criticizing the established social order of, for example, post-colonialism and racism. As already mentioned, the erosion of citizenship can be seen mostly in the decline of the social welfare ideal of citizenship where citizenship held the inequalities of capitalism in check. But at the same time an extension has happened in the form of claims toward group-differentiated citizenship. This latter idea rests on the assumption that the interaction of groups—for example, established vs. immigrant groups, or majorities vs. indigenous minorities—rests on unequal social and political power relations. A widely disseminated criticism is that the thin veneer of (allegedly) impartial treatment of groups by the state covers up power inequalities and inequalities of outcome as regards the distribution patterns of valued material and symbolic goods. This criticism has emerged under several labels: (1) multicultural citizenship; (2) gendered and racialized citizenship; and (3) post-colonial citizenship.\n\nMulticultural citizenship: The post-World War Two Marshallian marriage of democracy and citizenship with capitalism was followed in the 1980s and 1990s by another unlikely union, the nexus of multicultural citizenship and neo-liberalism. Multicultural citizenship rests on the idea that minorities in a state need to preserve and draw upon their cultural repertoire (e.g. language, customs) in order to be successful in the competition for public resources. Rights demanded for indigenous and national minorities are above all rights to some sort of self-government. For immigrant groups, the rights and public policies demanded and partly granted usually do not go that far. These include exemption rules, the right to mother-tongue instruction, support of migrant organizations and other help in adapting to a new environment. Interestingly, new forms of the conceptualization of multicultural citizenship are not so much oriented towards a heavily institutionalized form of citizenship. A prominent example is Iris Marion Young’s “group-differentiated citizenship” which concerns the distribution of various forms of social, political, and economic power among groups (Young, 1999). Another strand of debate is noteworthy: while multicultural citizenship is compatible with seemingly different political perspectives, such as communitarianism and liberalism (Kymlicka, 1995), its successor concept—diversity—has been concerned not so much with equality but with economic efficiency in catering to clients (Joppke, 2017). Therefore, a link between more recent multicultural-diversity and neo-liberal perspectives may be considered.\n\nGendered and racialized citizenship: These forms of citizenship point to the disjuncture between formal rights on the one hand and gendered, racial, and related forms of exclusion on the other hand—in a nutshell, based on unequal relations of power. This observation goes back a long time to the works of W.E.B. Du Bois, who also discussed one of the deleterious consequences, namely “double consciousness” (Du Bois, 1903): looking at oneself through the eyes of others, in this case, the oppressor. Based on the observation that various heterogeneities interact in producing inequalities, the cross-sectional approach has focused on intersectionality of differences between individuals, categories, and groups (Crenshaw, 1991). One prominent line of thinking in the field of citizenship studies juxtaposes the promise of equality among citizens with categorical sorting which result in social inequalities. For example, deviations from “white heterosexual masculinity” have historically and contemporaneously served to erase indigenous and other minority cultural and social practices. Tuning into these ideas is the notion of “critical whiteness”, which asks about the privileges of whiteness and remedies to it (Garner, 2007); this concerns, for example, the rewriting of school curricula to include (anti-)racism and (post-)colonialism. Yet, one may ask whether the critics’ claim to advance social justice seriously contradicts the economically (neo-)liberal social order.\n\nPost-colonial citizenship: In a wide sense, post-colonial citizenship is not primarily about inclusion into the fold of the political community. It rather seeks to change the very definition of citizenship. “Acts of citizenship” are analyzed and explicit reference is made to collective practices of contention, as for example, in the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804) and its aftermath. The Haitian revolutionaries contested the racist social order of the time. Not surprisingly, examples of historical uprisings and de-colonial imageries abound in post- and de-colonial accounts (Bhambra, 2014). While there is no clear image yet of future ideas of citizenship, these considerations seem to be much less tied to a clear formalization in the form of state institutions. What seems to be clearer are trends of convergence of citizenship rules around the globe. In regions outside Europe, North America, and Australia, that is, in Africa, Latin America, South Asia, East Asia (not necessarily the Gulf states in the Middle East), there is not only a proliferation of right-wing, nationalist populist politics but also an increase in liberal rules of naturalization, such as growing tolerance toward dual citizenship or citizenship acquisition via the ius soli principle.\n\nSixth, there have been considerable efforts to capture the nexus of environmental movements, ecological citizenship and the loss of habitat. At the 1972 UN Conference in Stockholm, debates on environmental problems concluded that ecological challenges could no longer be credibly considered only within territorial boundaries of nation states (Melo-Escrihuela, 2008). In the succeeding decades the expansion of environmental consciousness in different regions of the world saw the emergence of green activists and the creation and consolidation of Green parties. These movements and parties did not have a specific citizenship agenda, but their aim to protect nature and to engage civil society groups made them “partners” in the objective of the extension of rights to include nature itself. Yet pro-citizenship movements in state-bounded public spheres did not easily enter into coalitions with environmentalists and their post-national agenda. Besides, environmentalist claims focused on the rights of nature challenging the primacy of society over nature. Also, environmentalists advanced the notion of responsibility towards nature by humans (van Steenbergen, 1994, 1).\n\nIn the twenty-first century, ecological citizenship authors have developed ideas with which they distanced themselves from previous normative proposals of environmentalists. First, ecologism presupposes radical changes in the relationship of humans with the non-human natural world, and in the mode of social and political life (Dobson, 2000). Ecological citizenship entails not only the extension of rights, such as the right to clean water, and reforms in socio-liberal legislation, but also imposes personal duties, as well as the cultivation of “ecological virtue”. According to this view, substantive issues of ecological culture would be better served by the active participation of citizens in the political arena, both nationally and transnationally (Dobson, 2007). Two approaches can be identified: rights and duties. The rights approach highlights the political processes and participation in constructing global ecological citizenship while valuing local practices of citizenship and the political experience of environmental social movements. The duties approach adds personal responsibility to improve the environment through practices, such as recycling and sustainable consumption. It also envisages collective duties and the introduction of fiscal policies. So far, the institutionalization of ecological collective responsibility through taxation is only implemented within nation state boundaries (Dobson, 2007). However, ecological citizenship goes beyond the conception of citizenship limited to the territory of a state. The promotion of global and environmental justice involves addressing socio-political and economic aspects of the ecological crisis and extending “civic virtue”. A justice-based theory founded on moral principles of reciprocity within the social and natural world requires an active transnational civil society (Melo-Escrihuela, 2008).\n\nElements of democracy can be found in the existing literature on environmental or ecological citizenship. Nevertheless, issues of recognition and inclusion are not always addressed in this literature according to defenders of ecological citizenship. The same goes for the need to identify the subaltern voices which would invite greater democratic participation, and which would involve people in the politicization of dominant socio-ecological orders. These failings can be partly remedied by making connections between research in ecological citizenship and environmental justice.\n\nHabitat loss is a major obstacle when striving for ecological citizenship and environmental justice. The international political discourse on habitat loss is now on the agenda of UN Climate Change Conferences as a major concern for the extension of the rights of nature. The effects of climate change endanger biodiversity, and living organisms will either disappear or be forced to migrate in the absence of food, water, and shelter. However, the loss of habitat is caused by numerous and various human actions: the actions of private developers, decisions made by national governments, as well as by global and local actors (Kolocek, 2017). Moreover, habitat loss causes poverty which degrades both social and ecological citizenship. As human communities are destroyed, members of these communities are forced to migrate in difficult and sometimes dangerous circumstances, particularly so in Africa and Latin America. The increasing scale of this challenge has prompted academics and advocates of human rights (such as the right to social security or the right to an adequate standard of living) to advance the notion of global social citizenship (cf. Curran, 2020).\n\nSuch thoughts have laid the basis for post-humanism (Braidotti, 2006). This concept repudiates an overly optimist interpretation of human-made technologies, assuming that there is always a more powerful earth—an insight already held in the late nineteenth century by Friedrich Engels (1962, 453). More importantly, post-humanist thinking also challenges state territorialism and thus nationalism. This leads to an approach congenial to emerging understandings of global citizenship and a common legacy of humankind which demands acting upon the atrocities of colonialism and sexism. Ultimately, this perspective rejects the universalistic credo of liberal interpretations of citizenship in favour of considering the differentiated forms of citizenship described above."
