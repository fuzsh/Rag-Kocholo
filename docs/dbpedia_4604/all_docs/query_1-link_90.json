Born on August 1st, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York, DeLuise's comedic charm and versatile acting skills quickly propelled him into the limelight. His parents, John and Vincenza DeLuise, were Italian immigrants who instilled in him a love for storytelling and performance, elements that would later underpin his professional achievements. DeLuise delved into acting with appearances in children's theatre at a young age and later honed his craft at Manhattan's High School of Performing Arts. Following his graduation, he debuted on stage with the Cleveland Play House before landing television roles. In the late 1950s, he captured national attention as the mischievous Dominick the Great on The Garry Moore Show. Subsequently, he emerged as a significant figure in Hollywood, starring in timeless classics alongside renowned actors like Burt Reynolds and Gene Wilder. Some of his most notable works include The Cannonball Run, Blazing Saddles, and The End. Besides acting, DeLuise was known for his culinary prowess and authored several cookbooks that showcased his Italian heritage. He also lent his distinctive voice to numerous animated films including An American Tail, All Dogs Go To Heaven, and The Secret of NIMH. Despite battling health issues towards the latter part of his life, DeLuise continued to entertain audiences until his passing on May 4, 2009.\n\nRam Dass (born Richard Alpert; April 6, 1931) is an American spiritual teacher, former academic and clinical psychologist, and author of many books, including the 1971 book Be Here Now.
