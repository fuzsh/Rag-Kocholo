        "text": "The 1970s witnessed an efflorescence of religious feminism in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, particularly around the issue of women's ordination. We pose a model for understanding this development—the formation of publics/counterpublics—and explore how it illuminates our case study. Drawing upon oral history interviews and archival sources, we document how RLDS women created independent publications, grassroots consciousness-raising groups, feminist classes and conferences, and Women-Church–inspired worship to reimagine priesthood within their church. We conclude that the lens of a counterpublic offers a capacious view of our topic, one capable of integrating both social movement theory and network theory. Furthermore, we suggest that the RLDS example featured in this essay is simply a manifestation of a larger late twentieth-century American “feminist religious counterpublic” formed across many religious denominations and groups that held a shared feminist social imaginary.\n\n2 Fraser, Nancy, “Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of Actually Existing Democracy,” Social Text 25/26 (1990): 56–80CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Pritchard, Elizabeth, “Pilgrimages and Publics: The Case of Taizé,” Anthropological Theory 15, no. 1 (2015): 68–91CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Mansbridge, Jane, “The Long Life of Nancy Fraser's ‘Rethinking the Public Sphere,’” in Feminism, Capitalism, and Critique: Essays in Honor of Nancy Fraser, ed.

Even so, her father, a longtime elder in the church, wholeheartedly supported her, and she was ordained in the second wave of ordinations in 1986. Similarly, two Diné/Navajo women who lived off reservation related both family and cultural support for women's ordination. Furthermore, in a 2005 interview, a Native American ministries specialist in the church related that two other Diné/Navajo women, ordained and living on the reservation at the time, believed that women's ordination was “more like the white culture's ideas of gender roles changed and finally caught up with what was already traditional for Native peoples and the Navajo specifically.” Gwendolyn Hawks-Blue, interview by Clara Brill-Carlat, Zoe House, and Esther Kerns, April 2, 2020; Keith Russell, e-mail to author, February 28, 2005; Fern Thayer, telephone interview by author, April 16, 2005, Iowa City, Iowa; Ann Russell, telephone interview by author, March 28, 2005, Iowa City, Iowa.\n\n98 Mark Chaves, Ordaining Women, 190–192; Campbell-Reed, Eileen, Anatomy of a Schism: How Clergywomen's Narratives Reinterpret the Fracturing of the Southern Baptist Convention (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2016)Google Scholar; Prelinger, Catherine, ed., Episcopal Women: Gender, Spirituality and Commitment in an American Mainline Denomination (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Stephenson, Lisa P., “Prophesying Women and Ruling Men: Women's Religious Authority in North American Pentecostalism,” Religions 2 (2011): 410–26CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Henold, Catholic and Feminist; Peterfeso, Jill, Womanpriest: Tradition and Transgression in the Contemporary Roman Catholic Church (New York: Fordham University Press, 2020)Google Scholar; Frishman, “The Ordination of Women”; Nadell, Women Who Would Be Rabbis; Shepherd, Gordon, Anderson, Lavina Fielding, and Shepherd, Gary, eds., Voices for Equality: Ordain Women and Resurgent Mormon Feminism (Salt Lake City: Kofford, 2015)Google Scholar; Legath, Jenny Wiley, Sanctified Sisters: A History of the Protestant Deaconesses (New York: New York University Press, 2019), 131–59Google Scholar; Speight, “The Ministerial Reformation.”"
