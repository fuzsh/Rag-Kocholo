My dear Mr. Strong: In anticipation of the coming retirement from the position of Federal Reserve Agent of the Twelfth Federal Reservse Bank of John Perrin, I am anxious, very anxious, to show my appreciation of the man in a public way in COAST BANKER, and the thought has occurred to me that you who know the men so well, might be willing to write an appreciation of him which we would publish as a principle feature of the next issue of COAST BANKER. We are publishing a page size photograph of him and we would like to have a full page pen picture of him and the service he has rendered the country, and I know no one is more familiar with this than you and no one who is familiar wi the facts, occupying as important a position as you do it seems that you are the one man in the country to write that appreciation. The only reason I am writing to you is because I know that you are the outstanding figure in the financial world and that you are personally acquainted with John Perrin's work. At the same time may we ask that we be favored with a recent photograph of yourself? Yours very traly, GPE:MC December 17, 1g25.

This is a courtesy you have rendered more than once in the past and it is because of the keen interest and appreciation with which it is received by newspaper readers in every part of the country that we are asking you to favor us again this year. Will you kindly write us briefly and for our exclusive distribution what, in your opinion, have been a few of the outstanding developments, industrially and commercially, of the year 1925; the outlook for the new year and some suggestions as to how best to solve its problems.

Dear Sir:- November 16th of this year will witness the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Federal Reserve System - a decade of banking achievement unparalleled in the history of our country. It is therefore fitting that special note be made of this anniversary through a symposium of ideas as to the value of the System to the country. We are requesting such expressions of opinion from a number of prominent bankers and business men, who have either been identified in some way with the System or are in a position to realize its value to the industry and commerce of our country. The replies will be printed in the November let number of the 3-C rook, which is our house organ. Because of the fact that you have been so prominently identified with the System, it mould be singularly appropriate to have a brief expression of your views regarding the System as you view it to-day. Will you not therefore be kind enough to send us a brief letter summarizing your opinion? We assure you it will be very much appreciated. Very truly yours, Editor 3-C Book WBG*HL 5.

The ,,rovrth of manufacturing and trade has been reflected in the rise of great industrial centers and the creation of a remarkable system of transportation, including railways, ports, and a mercantile marine. Banking, currency, insurance, and other parts of the financial structure have been greatly strengthened. lodernizing of the economic structure has made possible a rapid increase in the country's wealth, and a general gain in the standard o f living. 'bile the, accomplishments of the people of Japan have been unique in history, there remains one field or endeavor in which much can still be accom- nlished to make modern Japan a well balanced organization for economic and social well being. The transforms.tion of the ration from so largely agri- cultural to equally important industrial development should not neglect the need for corresponding social readjustments suitable to the needs and happiness of an industrial population gathered in large cities, as distinguished from an agricultural population scattered throughout the islands. The social life of city dwellers depends just as greatly for happiness and health upon sound social institutions as doesnindustrial welfare upon the development of well organized industrial plants. The enlargement of opportunity for the people of Japan to enjoy healthy, stimulating social intercourse through religious, athletic, musical, educational and other organizations is the creation of city life. a. necessary accompaniment of Possibly here is where the giant strides of Japan towards wnrld success have ou' distanced the collateral development towards social and community advancement.

Dear Governor Strong: In arranging the program for the Tenth National Foreign Trade Convention, which is to be held at New Orleans on April 25, 26, and 27 next, we are desirous of including a paper which will present the foreign trade facilities of the Federal Reserve System. Ae you know, therl has been more than a little criticism of the Federal Reserve System on the ground that it does not in actual operation provide the facilities for foreign trade which many of its critics think it should provide. Some effort has been made to meet and answer this criticism, but the approaching Convention se -ems to offer an opportunity for a paper that will go further along th this line and that will be informative and helpful. It se-me to us that such a paper should be prepared with special reference to the service that the Federal Reserve System can render in the export of agricultural products. With this in view, it seems that it would be most effective to have the paper prepared and delivered by a western man. When this subject was under discussion in the Committee of the Council in charge of the program, it was suggested by Mr. W. L. Saunders that you might be able to give We shall much appreciate us some valuable suggestion as to a speaker. if you can do so. Faithfully yours, OKD.DMS Secretary.

Mr. Benjamin Strong, Federal Reserve Bank, New York City. My dear Mr. Strong: On February 8th the Merchants & Manufacturers Association, which is the largest business organization in the State, will hold its banquet at the Hotel Belevedere, at 7 o'clock. The character of the Association is such that it usually attracts the leading business elements of the community, which include financial and professionel men, as well as those in the industrial and commercial field. The banquet is featured by three speakers only. We generally ask a commanding figure like yourself, who is in touch with the main factors relating to business, in the hope that through him we can secure a message well worth while. We happen to know that you are particularly familiar with the European situation. And knowing how closely that situation is interlaced with our own American business, we feel that a straight-from-the-heart talk from you would be very wholesome in more ways than one. Mr. Waldo Newcomer of this city, whom you know very well, is a member of our Board of Directors. All of the national banks and trust companies in Baltimore are members of our Association. In order that you might clearly apprehend the nature of our organization, I have asked Y.r. Newcomer to use his best offices to induce you to accept. I hope you will give the matter more than favorable consideration, and will assure us at a reasonably early date that we can schedule you as one of our three worth while speakers.

I would say, however, that, in my judgment, there are few men here in New York who can get up and talk to a Western audience along these lines in as effective a way as you can, and I am not sure but that if somebody tried to do it and did not succeed in doing it in an effective way, he might do more harm than good.

Wallace, Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. My dear Mr. Secretary: I trust that I may, without impropriety, suggest that the advance census reports on farm mortgage indebtedness disclose a situation that would seem to warrant the serious attention of your Department. The census for 1920 will show that while the number of farms in the United States operated by their own- ers was practically the same as in 1910, their mortgage indebtedness increased from $1,726,172,851 in 1910 to $4,003,767,192 in 1920, or 131.9 per cent. This means that in addition to the mortgage indebtedness existing in 1910, a further dead load of $2,277,594,- 341 has been placed upon this class of farms. The census will further show that nearly 40 per cent of all farms are now operated by tenants. If the same proportion holds good with them, the total farm mortgage indebtedness increased considerably more than $3,000,000,000 in the ten-year period. The added annual interest bill amounts to about $200,000,000, or more than one- fourth the farm value of the average wheat crop, not only of the mortgaged farms, but of all United States. the farms in the No figures are available showing the increase in chattel and personal indebtedness, but this is known to be very large. The degree of increase may equal or exceed that of the mortgage indebtedness. It is not improbable that the value of more than a third of the nation's wheat crop will hereafter be taken each year to pay the interest on the increased rural indebtedness that has been piled up during the past decade. Nor do these figures include 389,459 farms for which no report was made in 1920. In 1910 only 48,092 farms failed to report their indebtedness. The statistics are otherwise incomplete, but could all the facts be known the showing would no doubt be more startling. A recent circular by your Department, while admitting the seriousness of the situation caused by this tremendous increase of farm indebtedness, draws reassurance from the fact that the reported value of the mortgaged farms increased 117.6 per cent during the decade, and that therefore the proportion of indebtedness to valuation is not much greater. Just what benefit accrues from this larger valua- tion of the farms is not clear. The earning power of land is not affected by changes in its rated value. It can Digitized forpay FRASER only the expenses assessed against http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ it through the sale of what it proFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis a character of loans somewhat different from those of other industries, and of commerce. Provision for an intermediate line of credits would no doubt be wise. But the tendency has been and continues to be to encourage borrowing on the basis of inflated values, or of pure speculation; and the result is shown in the census reports. Misunderstanding of the character and the possibilities of the business of farming is increasing. A farm is not like a factory whose output can be increased indefinitely by the addition of more equipment. The productive capacity of an acre of ground has rather definite limitations. Any increase in overhead expenses must come out of the first revenues. Interest is the first item in overhead. It takes the first bushel of wheat, the first hog or calf-and sometimes the last also. The only hams that go into the smokehouse am those that are left after the interest bill is paid. Interest comes ahead of shoes for the chil- dren, or dresses for the wife. In addition to its original purposes of educational work in the field of production and conservation, the De- partment of Agriculture has in recent years expanded its activities to include economics. It asks and re- ceives appropriations from the public treasury to be expended in teaching r farmers better business methods. This is approved by the public and ac- cepted by the farmers. The Department has sought and been granted administrative, police and judicial powers wholly outside its original It has become the duly constituted authority of the nation in all matters pertaining to agriculture. Its advice is accepted by most farmers. It is supported at public expense, for the very proper reason that agriculture is the basic industry, upon which the prosperity of all others depend. It would therefore seem right for it to take cognizance of a condition that threatens to nullify all of its splendid constructive educational efforts, and that evidently constitutes a grave national danger. It is now quite generally recognized that normal business conditions canscope. not prevail unless the purchasing power of the farmer's dollar is normal. But the purchasing power of the dollar that goes to pay interest is of little concern to the manufacturer or merchant who wants to sell to the farmer. The additional third or more of the gross returns from the annual wheat crop, or its equivalent, that goes for interest will not be spent for machinery or clothing. It may make business better along the Florida East Coast in winter time. It may increase the population of California. It will swell the reserves of some insurance companies. It will not fill many pay roll envelopes. It is diverted right at its source from the true channels of trade. The fever of restless speculation that has gripped so many farmers is, of course, not confined to that class. It is prevalent among all our people. But if the Department of Agriculture can in some measure temper it among those whose champion and mentor it has become, the national economic structure will be strengthened, and the industry of agriculture will be headed back toward that comparatively safe position it once occupied. The chief danger to American agri- culture is not that our farmers will be unable to borrow enough money or engage in a sufficiently broad field of business activities. It is that the fixed overhead and the operating ex- penses of our farms will become so high as to absorb all profits, and make it impossible for them to compete with the farms of other countries, without a degree of protection and as- sistance that will not be granted by our consuming classes, and cannot in fairness be expected. That would be the short road to general ruin. Respectfully, (Signed) W. I.

My work has piled up on me so that I have been obliged to forego the ples.sure of preparing hny articles for the newspapers or magazines this year, as I simply have not the time to do it. Will you not, therefore, excuse me. yours sincerely, James ... Clark, Esq., c/o American Bankers Association, 5 Nassau St., New York City. w December 18, 1922. Dear Sir: Replying to your kind note of December 9, I find it will not be possible to prepare replies to the inquiries enclosed in your letter, pertly because i have been absent for over two weeks and am just now overloaded with work, but also on account of the policy of the bank which uniformly has been to avoid anything in the nature of prophecies as to the future. We feel that it is a hazardous business at best to attempt to penetrate into the future, especially in times of such arreat uncertainty, hat the Federal Leserve Syster, should scrupulously avoid an attempting to do so. I tan sure that you will understand the need for such a policy. Yours very truly, Ben j. Strong, Governor. F.
