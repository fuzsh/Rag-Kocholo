When USC Trojan Family first announced the new president’s arrival in the spring of 1991, we called him “a man of uncommon scope” – little guessing how prophetic that phrase would be. You can read (on page 10) about the spectacular changes he engineered during his USC presidency; a series of honors and celebrations are scheduled through the summer, and we are preparing a tribute for the next issue of this magazine. But I also wanted to look back at what we said about him when he arrived, a relative unknown who had been president of the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, and see how it sounds today. One of the first things he told us was, “When my wife Kathryn and I were interviewing at Buffalo in 1982, everybody was down on the university .... I started, after I’d been there about a year, to talk about UB becoming one of the really best public universities around. At first, people thought it was just silly, but nobody thinks it’s silly anymore.” Two things stand out in that quote. One is his relentless drive not only to change the university itself, but to change the university’s perceptions about itself. He was known then – and is known now – for seeing the glass half full rather than half empty, and for persuading those around him to share this view. A former USC colleague told the Los Angeles Times in October, “Sample understood that university leadership involves both improving substance and marketing the change. The bril- liance of Sample is that he does both.” The second prophetic note was including his wife, Kathryn, in his presidency. He consistently talks about the job in terms of “Kathryn and I.” His letter to the USC community announcing his impending retirement begins, “Having had the profound privilege and joy of serving this university for 19 years, Kathryn and I are today formally announcing my retirement from the presidency of USC, effective August 2, 2010.” We invite you to share your own thoughts about the Samples, their presidency and the effects they have had on USC.

Sample At 6 a.m. on a Wednesday morning in October nearly 16 years ago, USC Distinguished Professor George Olah was officially in - formed that he’d won the Nobel Prize in chemistry. He was recognized for his research in hydrocarbons, research that holds tremendous promise for developing cleaner and more efficient fuels. Within hours of the good news, we arranged a reception at USC for that afternoon to celebrate Professor Olah’s spectacular achievement. Like so many other scientists, artists and in- tellectuals, Professor Olah had fled his native Hungary during the “three-day open window” following the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. Several of his fellow Hungarian refugees attended our reception that afternoon, delighted to be part of the congrega- tion of con gratula tions. At one point during the festivi- ties, someone claimed that the United States was the only country that taxes a Nobel Laureate’s prize money. “Not only that,” chimed in another voice, “as the laureates come back to the states, their medals are weighed by customs and they get taxed on the value of the gold in the medal!” (Now as it happens, neither of these as- sertions is true. But at the time, we all thought they were true.) Amid loud tsk-tsks of disap- proval at this notion of taxing Nobel Prize money, George Olah spoke up. In my mind’s eye, I can still see him at that moment – taller than nearly everyone else in the room, poised and thoughtful, and with tears welling up in his eyes, he said to his fellow Hungarian refugees, “Aren’t we lucky to be in this country and to be able to pay these taxes?” Today when I recall Professor Olah’s com- ment, it is a powerful reminder to me of the ex- tent to which America has been a magnet for so many of the world’s greatest minds – in science, engineering, medicine, the arts and literature. This country has developed an ethos that encourages originality and supports innovators and entrepreneurs through research funding and market success. In turn, we as a country have truly benefited from the “brain gain.” USC itself has benefited substantially from our ability to attract some of the world’s best faculty as well as postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates. Entrepreneurialism and innovation seem to be part of USC’s very DNA. Perhaps this stems from the audacity of USC’s founders, who, like all pioneers worth their salt, saw and seized op- portunity and built a university where there was only a mustard field on the outskirts of a frontier village. Perhaps our entrepreneurial spirit derives from our location in Los Angeles – a city that enthusiastically embraces originality and creativity, whether manifested in the arts, communications, science, technology, transpor- tation or business. As you’ll see in an article in this issue about our own Trojan entrepreneurs associated with the USC Marshall School of Business and the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Stud- ies (“Masters of Their Own Universe,” p. 24), USC is doing its part to encourage and support smart people with great ideas who are attracted to this university from around the globe. Just as we’re doing through the Alfred Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering at USC and the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation, the lat- ter of which has spun out 15 start-ups and raised $115 million in capital in only two years. Just as we did, and continue to do, for Distinguished Professor Olah and hundreds of other faculty researchers who are on the cutting edge in their respective fields. It makes me very proud to lead an institution that is so good at being original. l President Steven B.

I remember each of them asking questions about what I was doing, how the dorm was holding up (I lived in Marks Hall, one of the oldest buildings on campus). Was the faculty-in-residence program (new at the time) a good idea? Did my clubs get enough support? I remember each of them listening to what I had to say, and I re- member then student affairs vice president James Dennis looking on as well. What I remember most, though, was when Mrs. Ramo told Mrs. Annenberg and Mrs. Y oung that they had to stop asking me questions. As she pointed out, everyone else was just about done with lunch and I had not yet started eating mine. I had grown up in a one-high-school town. USC, supported by men and women like Mrs. Ramo (who helped raise the mil- lions needed for scholarships like mine), of- fered me an opportunity to see much more of the world. I often say that I was raised in Nevada but came of age at USC. That lunch, in its way, shows why. Russell West Jr. ’88 NEW YORK, NY Value Added I appreciated with interest the article “Vir- tue Takes Time” (What’s New, Autumn 2009, p. 19). When viewing the article from Music for the Masses Thank you for the article on the USC Thornton School of Music’s 125th anniver- sary (“With a Song in Their Hearts, ” Winter 2009, p. 28). I am very happy to read about the progress and innovations taking place, especially the opportunity for students to major in popular music performance. The school of music today is the school I wish I’d had when I enrolled in 1978. Al- though we got a great education in classi- cal music performance, theory and history, the school at that time did not give us any information about the real world of the con- temporary music business. It’s great to see USC now embrace the value in all kinds of music, and include cur- ricula that will help students succeed in this very competitive industry. Linda Normando Cicino ’82 LA HABRA, CA Remembering Virginia I am sure you will receive many remem- brances of Virginia Ramo (In Memoriam, Winter 2009, p. 60); this is mine. I came to USC as a Trustee Scholar in September 1984. A couple of years later, I met Mrs. Ramo – who may or may not have had a role in selecting me for a Trustee Scholarship. We met when the Student Affairs Committee invited several student leaders to lunch, as it did a couple of times each year. Now that I look back, I’m rather impressed it would take the time. Odd, isn’t it, that a committee charged with stu- dent affairs would want to talk to students? I sat between Wallis Annenberg and Lorna Y. Reed; Mrs. Ramo was across the QUOTED ›› “USC, supported by men and women like Virginia Ramo (who helped raise the millions needed for scholarships like mine), offered me an opportunity to see much more of the world.

That was the real puzzler in our latest Last Word, which featured two different clues identified as No. 9. Of the 142 entries, few failed to point out this numbering anomaly. But was it an error? Or an insidious trick? “I figure you guys are pretty adept at drop - ping clues, so I hesitated at elevating the second 9 to a 10,” writes Lyle Parrish ‘56. Alas, we are not nearly as clever (or cruel) as readers would imagine, and the redundant numbering was just an old-fashioned typo. However, two common errors that did cost points involved identifying “Gordo” as the space ex- plorer of clue No. 1 and “Little Sorrel” as the famous Civil War mount of clue No. 5. Both were good guesses, but Gordo, as canny Last Worder Robert Knecht Schmidt BS ‘00, MS ‘01 notes, was a squirrel monkey, a New World species not likely to be born in Cameroon. As for Little Sorrel, he couldn’t have carried Gen. Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson to Appomattox, since the Confederate hero had been mortally wounded two years earlier. The correct steed was Robert E. Lee’s “Traveller.” Drawn randomly from 114 correct entries, these five winners will receive Borders gift certificates for their efforts: Charlette Bond, David Cherryhomes ’97, Marina Clifton ’86, Edith Frampton and Don Ross PhD ’91.

The refer- ence in the article to virtue as “nobler” seems to indicate that such a way provides a better quality life. To attend to such an aim might be easier if virtue were a habit that stayed close to the significance of its separation from emotional fluctuation. It almost seems as though the article be- gins to reveal the bridge that may be form- ing between Western and Eastern spiritual thought, with science as a way of shed- ding light or introducing Eastern spiritual thought. This can lead to a better under- standing of wholesome virtues. Maureen Kris (Halikis) ’84 LOS ANGELES, CA Last Word In I have a great time working on the Last Word challenges!

Andrea Weigel, BA ’95 TEMPLETON, CA Wayne’s World It was with great interest and pleasure that I just finished Rick Jewell’s article about John Wayne (“John Wayne, an American Icon,” Autumn 2008, p. 32). I am a big John Wayne fan, and am always interested in learning more about him. A few weeks ago while at church, I met a woman who indicated that she had been at an event with a man she thought might be a [Wayne] family member, and men tioned something about a football scholar ship, or perhaps an academic scholarship, related to John Wayne. Maybe it was in Wayne’s name? I would be interested in finding out more. I am a moderator of the Original John Wayne Message Board, at www .dukewayne. com, and it is just such little tidbits about our hero that we enjoy learning. It pleases us greatly to know that Duke is still an integral part of USC, as well as a part of its history . If you could share a little more informa- tion regarding the scholarship, or perhaps forward my e-mail on to someone who knows more about it, I would appreciate it.

Significant faculty achievements dur- ing this time included the awarding of the Nobel Prize in chemistry to USC profes- sor George Olah and the conferring of the “If there were a tagline for his leader- ship style,” said USC Board of Trustees chairman Edward P. Roski Jr., “it would be ‘Never let up.’ And the results have been nothing short of spectacular. “From the very start he understood the entrepreneurial zeal of USC and fueled our desire to be excellent. Again and again, he would achieve his objectives for the univer- sity but would then push even harder, urg- ing everyone to reach for even higher goals. Filling his shoes will be a big job for the trustees as we search for his successor.” SAMPLE BECAME the 10th president of USC in March 1991, after service as president of the University at Buffalo of the State Uni- versity of New York. Under his leadership, USC has become world renowned in the fields of communica- tion and multimedia technologies, received national acclaim for its innovative community partnerships and solidified its status as one of the nation’s leading research universities. During his tenure, USC climbed 25 points in the annual U.S. News & World Report college rankings, an increase that is unprecedented for its rapidity and magnitude. Among the milestones of the past 19 years is a national record-setting fundraising cam- paign which, at its conclusion in Decem- ber 2002, had raised $2.85 billion. During Sample’s presidency, USC became the only STEVEN B. SAMPLE, president of the Uni- versity of Southern California since 1991, announced in November that he will retire in August 2010. “For Kathryn and me, the presidency of USC has been far more than just a job,” Sample said. “It has been a calling, an all- consuming passion to move this university ahead farther and faster than any other uni- versity in the United States. “We have been blessed to have pursued this mission in the company of many col- leagues and friends who share our commit- ment to USC’s advancement. Our years here have simply been exhilarating.” Sample’s 19-year presidency has seen dramatic changes at USC. Under his lead- ership, the university: • Became a highly selective undergradu- ate institution; • Saw the excellence of its faculty rise to new levels; • Completed the largest fund-raising cam- paign in the history of higher education; • Created a global network of scholars and programs, especially around the Pacific Rim; • Built successful partnerships in its neighborhoods to spur economic and edu- cational development; and • Embraced its role as the largest private employer and key social force in the City of Los Angeles.

At the undergraduate level, USC ad - vanced rapidly as a highly selective univer- sity, with SAT scores rising more than 300 points and the number of freshman appli- cations nearly tripling since 1991. This fall, USC enrolled 232 National Merit Scholars in its freshman class, a dramatic increase from 33 in 1991 that placed USC among the nation’s top five universities in the number of National Merit Scholars. IN 2000, USC was proclaimed “College of the Year” by Time magazine and the Princeton Review, in recognition of its community partnership programs. USC ranked among the top five in the nation in a survey of “Great Colleges to Work For” (Chronicle of Higher Education, 2008), was named a “col- lege with a conscience” for its service learn- ing and community involvement in 2005 and this year ranked no. 1 in the Saviors of Our Cities: A Survey of Best College and University Civic Partnerships.

In 2003, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is an active member of USC’s faculty, teaching with management expert Warren Bennis a popular course, “The Art and Adven- ture of Leadership.” His best-selling book, The Contrarian’s Guide to Leadership, named a “must-read” by Harvard Management Update, has been translated into five languages. l A Web site including Steven Sample’s letter to the USC community, a photo gallery and the oppor- tunity to share messages with the president can be found at http://search.usc.edu CapitalConnections ›› MISSING WOMEN Historian Philippa Levine of USC College presented a lec- ture at the Library of Congress in mid-July at the annual International Seminar on Decolonization. Decolonization is a term used to mark the period after the Second World War when European imperial powers rapidly lost their colonial overseas posses- sions.

Murphy testified that regulating compensation “will cripple” the financial services industry. He argued that it’s not “in the taxpayers’ interest to elimi- nate bonuses or limit the top pay of execu- tives,” adding, “Banks are losing their best people… precisely the people who under- stand the complex interests that got us into trouble.” Public anger is understand- able, Murphy said. “But we shouldn’t make policy decisions when we’re angry.” ›› PAKISTANI PROMOTERS USC dean of religious life Varun Soni and Rob Asghar, a USC Annenberg Center on Public Diplomacy University fellow, went to the U.S. Department of State to discuss the Pakistani diaspora community and to explore a relationship with the USC center. As a result, Soni and Asghar ended up helping organize the Concert for Pakistan on Sept. 13 at the United Nations General Assembly Hall in New York. The concert drew nearly 2,000 music fans, allied in their concern for the people of the Swat region. “By bringing together musicians from around the world, the concert put a human face to the serious challenges confronting Pakistan’s three million internally displaced people,” says Soni. l For news on USC in Washington and Sacramento, visit http://uscnews.usc.edu/capital_connections USC TROJAN FAMILY MAGAZINE spring 2010 11 President Steven B.

Goodall has been a distinguished adjunct professor and co-director of the Jane Goodall Research Center at USC College for 19 years. She also is an adjunct faculty member in USC’s Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy. Good- all, who began her career in Gombe Stream National Park (Tanzania) in 1960, has spoken to people in 64 countries about her chimpanzee research. At Bovard, she shared several of her unique experi- ences that paint a vivid image of a global environment in peril. “Each one of us must do everything in our power to slow down climate change,” she said, emphasizing the difference that individuals and small groups of people can make in saving other creatures. – Susan Andrews Read more about Jane Goodall’s speech and visit to USC at http://tinyurl.com/y9th64g A MAJOR NEW research center focus- ing on health policy and economics has been established at USC, executive vice president and provost C. L. Max Nikias announced in late September. The Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics is funded by a $1.2 million operating gift from Leonard D. Schaeffer and his wife, Pamela Schaeffer. “At a time when the nation is struggling with health-care reform, we are honored to announce the creation of this new interdis- ciplinary center, which will bring together USC’s extraordinarily wide range of exper- tise in order to address one of the most sig- nificant issues of our time,” Nikias said. The Schaeffer Center is headed by Dana Goldman, a nationally recognized expert in health economics who was recently elected to the Institute of Medicine, one of the highest honors in the fields of health and medicine. He joins USC from the RAND Corporation, where he headed its health economics, finance and organization divi- sion. Three of his former RAND colleagues have also been recruited to USC. The Schaeffer Center is a collaboration between the USC School of Policy, Plan- ning, and Development and the USC School of Pharmacy. In addition to his post as director of the Schaeffer Center, Gold- man holds the Norman Topping Chair in Medicine and Public Policy at SPPD, as well as a faculty appointment at the School of Pharmacy. Two of the three new faculty members – Geoffrey Joyce and Neeraj Sood – have been appointed associate professors at the School of Pharmacy; the third, Darius Lakdawalla, has been appointed associate professor at SPPD. They will be joined in their research and outreach activities by current USC faculty experts in pharmaco- economics, public insurance and health- care financing. The center’s research will focus on five key areas: reducing unnecessary spending, improving insurance design, understanding how public policy affects medical innova- tion, identifying the macroeconomic con- sequences of U.S. health-care costs, and improving comparative effectiveness and outcomes research. Goldman said the new center’s anticipated research projects include study of how cover- age gaps in federally funded programs impact patient health and how insurance designs affect physician-prescribing behavior.

The resolution affirms that children should not be denied the right to be housed together with their families based on what neighborhood they live in or how much money they make. “It’s important that Congress acknowl- edge the fundamental right of children to adequate housing,” says Waters. “Nearly 200,000 children and youth are homeless each night in America. It is appalling and unacceptable that so many children are living on the streets without shelter. The dangers of not having safe and adequate housing are especially harmful to children’s health and development.” Led by their professor, Ralph Fertig, students from several social welfare pol- icy classes researched statistics related to homelessness, conducted interviews, rallied stakeholders and made connections with key legislators to help draft and build sup- port for this comprehensive bill. The work was part of their social advocacy project. Fertig, clinical associate professor and head of the social welfare policy sequence for the School of Social Work, wrote the leg- islation, but says he couldn’t have done it without the work of the students. “The magnitude of their commitment exceeded my expectations,” he says. Fertig has a long history of advocating for the homeless, which he believes represent a “failure of our social service safety net.” He discussed the issue with his students, who decided to pursue it. Instead of a simple class assignment, Fertig felt it would be a good opportunity for students to see firsthand how policy can affect the life chances of vulnerable popula- tions.

Yet Glendale Unified consistently exceeds the statewide average in student scores. ›› FRESHMEN GIVE BACK During their first weekend as Trojans, hundreds of USC freshmen chose to volunteer their time in the community they just started call- ing home. More than 450 USC students participated in the 14th annual Friends and Neighbors Service Day hosted by the USC Volunteer Center. Students worked at more than 30 project sites around Los Angeles. “The fact that the Children’s Nature Institute had 20 organized volunteers who were eager to work in a focused way probably helped them do a week’s worth of work in three hours,” says center director Melissa Gaeke, about stu- dents at a children’s garden in Griffith Park. l Instead of contacting politicians, the advo- cacy team made community connections by targeting social welfare agencies. The agencies were asked to call and write letters of support to their district and state legisla- tive representatives. MSW student Rosa Guerrero says it felt “surreal” to be a part of this project – she never thought that she would have been able to contribute to such an important and progressive bill. As part of the PIE team, Guerrero had the job of finding and interviewing home- less families. She says it was difficult hear- ing parents describe how their children were taken away because of their inability to find housing. “In doing the interviews, we discovered homeless women had difficult times recov- ering their children from foster care,” she says. “They could not get their children back because they did not have housing, but many places would not give them housing until they had their children.” These types of stories emphasized the need for the legislation and motivated Guerrero and the other students to work even harder. This was not a typi- cal class assignment, and students who participated had to be com- mitted. Many worked weekends and over spring break to help get documentary foot- age, waking up at 5 a.m. and going to the downtown Los Angeles skid row where numbers of homeless families live. Erin Dowler was one of several students who attended a congressional hearing at Los Angeles Community College where the issue of homelessness was discussed. This is where the students submitted their draft to Waters. Video footage of the hear- ing is also included in the documentary. Dowler, who helped on the advocacy and communications teams, says being involved in this project has expanded her idea of social work and has given her insight and experience with the legislative process that she hopes to utilize again in her career. “This experience was so powerful,” she says. “To see something start from the beginning and watch it evolve into this huge federal bill that is going to be intro- duced. It’s amazing to be a part of it all.” – Cadonna Dory on anti-poverty issues for decades, reached out to his friend to see if she would be sup- portive of his students working on a bill. Waters, who is also chair of the of the House Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, liked the con- cept. She asked Fertig to bring her the research, rationale and language for the bill, and she committed to introduce it. Excited by the challenge and realiz- ing the enormity of the project, students immediately got to work. They split up into five teams – research, person-in-the- environment (PIE), legislative, advocacy and communications – to make the work more manageable. While the research team found statistics and numbers to describe the extent of the issue, members of the PIE team inter- viewed homeless parents and their children to give a face and real voice to the problem. Group members also took video footage of the interviews that was later included in a documentary the students made to record their efforts and progress. They plan to share the documentary with agencies and individuals to build support for the bill. The legislative team spent much of its time sending emails, making phone calls and writing letters to legislators to inform them of the bill and gather support for it. 14 USC TROJAN FAMILY MAGAZINE spring 2010 [CITY SAVIOR] USC is Top Neighbor USC is the most neighborly university in the country, according to Evan S. Dobelle, president of Westfield State College. Dobelle, who as president of Trinity College in the late 1990s oversaw that university’s notable neighborhood outreach effort, placed USC and the University of Pennsylvania at the top of the list of Saviors of Our Cities: A Survey of Best College and University Civic Partnerships. “This is another affirmation that USC is making a difference in our communities,” says Thomas S. Sayles, vice president of USC’s government and community relations. The institutions were selected because of positive impacts on their urban commu- nities, including both commercial and residential activities such as revitalization, cultural renewal, economics, community service and development. Dobelle published his first Saviors of Our Cities survey in 2006. USC topped that list as well. The survey highlighted USC’s Family of Schools program, its service- learning emphasis as seen in such programs as the Joint Educational Project, and the Business Expansion Network, which provides start-up and ongoing support for local businesses. Criteria for judging schools included the length of involve- ment with the community; real dollars invested; presence felt through payroll, research and purchasing power; faculty and student involvement in community service; continued sustainability of neighborhood initiatives; and effect on local student access and affordability to attend college through elementary and second- ary school partnerships. – Eddie North-Hager Sweet Temptations, one of a series of bilingual fotonovelas produced by the USC School of Pharmacy to promote community health awareness OVERHEARD ›› “Human settle- ment of the moon is now inevitable. Once you split up water into its parts, you can use it as rocket fuel right there on the moon to fly off to distant places, making it economical.” USC TROJAN FAMILY MAGAZINE spring 2010 15 TIM PAGE KINDERGARTEN PHOTO COURTESY OF DOUBLEDAY Parallel Play: Growing Up with Undiagnosed Asperger’s By Tim Page DOUBLEDAY, $26 USC PROFESSOR Tim Page lived undiag- nosed with Asperger’s Syndrome, a form of high-functioning autism, until he was 45 years old. “I felt like an alien, always about to be exposed” says Page, now 55, who recently penned a memoir about his adolescence as a loner. Parallel Play: Growing Up with Undiag- nosed Asperger’s, was published in September. The book had its origins in an article written for The New Yorker in 2007. For Page to revisit his awkward, disoriented childhood was sometimes painful. Still, in the end, he is proud of Parallel Play. “It’s my story, no doubt about it,” he says. “I told the truth, or as close to it as I could get. And I’m especially glad that this is what they call an ‘easy read.’ You can finish it in three or four hours. Asperger’s Syndrome is a complicated condition and I hope that Parallel Play will explain some things.” Page says that a lot of “Aspies” (as they call themselves) are simply “the typical Shelf Life – Madhu Thangavelu, USC engineering professor, on Fox News about the discovery of water on the moon absent-minded professor times five, in our own worlds.” Still, he hesitates to stereo- type. “You’ve got to remember – when you’ve met one person with autism, well, you’ve met one person with autism. We’re a pretty varied lot.” Parallel Play has received rave reviews from major media, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and O, The Oprah Magazine. “In fascinat- ingly precise detail and often to pricelessly funny effect, [Page] describes ways in which his efforts to feign normalcy have backfired,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “Recalling an adolescent clinch with a young woman who asked if he’d still care about her the next day, he says he pondered the ques- tion, then told her truthfully that he had no idea. ‘Wrong answer,’ he wryly recalls.” That particular review pleases Page because, he says: “Janet Maslin really got Parallel Play. I had wanted to write what could be described as a sad book with a lot of humor or a funny book shot through with sad- ness, and she understood that it was both.” Parallel Play ends just as Page begins his college career, a point in his life when he began to aquire some of the social skills An Awkward Childhood… In professor Tim Page’s critically lauded memoir, he writes about his attempts to feign normalcy despite undiagnosed Asperger’s Syndrome. that he had never understood. “My worst years with Asperger’s were mostly in my childhood,” he says. “Once you’ve been around the block a few thou- sand times, you start to get the hang of it. I still struggle today, but I’m more or less used to myself now and I know what cir- cumstances will be difficult for me and mostly avoid them.” Page was a classical music critic for 30 years, at The New York Times, Newsday and finally The Washington Post, where he won the Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 1997. In early 2008, he came to USC, where he is a professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism and also holds a position at the USC Thornton School of Music. “After covering more than 3,000 con- certs, I was a little tired of it and delighted when the USC job came along,” he says. “I consider myself an extremely lucky man.” “In general, I’ve found that people here treat each other with dignity and decency. I’m especially impressed by my students, who are so smart, curious and open-minded – much more so than they were when I was going to school 30 years ago. There’s this weird idea that today’s students are apathetic and purely hedonistic, and I don’t find that true of the USC students I’ve met at all.” Page is known for his intense focus on various seemingly unrelated subjects – he has published books on the musicians Glenn Gould, Virgil Thomson and William Kapell, the authors Dawn Powell and Sig- rid Undset and the 19th-century agnostic preacher Robert Green Ingersoll – but says he is currently “between extracurricular obsessions.” “The most important thing for me now is to settle in at USC and be of long and help- ful service here,” he says. “Annenberg has recently started an arts journalism master’s degree program, and I want to help shape a new generation of critics.” – Kirstin Heinle 16 USC TROJAN FAMILY MAGAZINE spring 2010 PHOTO BY MARK TANNER One World Flight: The Lost Journal of Radio’s Greatest Writer By Norman Corwin, edited by Michael C. Keith and Mary Ann Watson CONTINUUM, $24.95 AN ENTHUSIASTIC gathering at Barnes & Noble’s Westside Pavilion store honored Norman Corwin, a Los Angeles literary treasure, in September. We had assembled for a signing of his new book, One World Flight: The Lost Journal of Radio’s Greatest Writer. [Corwin, 99, is writer-in-residence at the USC Annenberg School for Commu- nication & Journalism.] Corwin had written the journal during his flight around the world in 1946. He had helped rally the nation during the war with his radio broadcasts and went on to write books, films and memorable radio scripts. The flight was his reward for winning the first Wendell Willkie Award, established by admirers of the 1940 Republican presi- dential nominee. During World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Willkie a special envoy and sent him around the world to visit America’s allies. Willkie then wrote a best-selling book, One World, whose goal is still far away. One of the benefits of teaching at USC was the opportunity it gave me and my wife, Nancy, to get to know Corwin, joining an army of friends he has accumulated, starting shortly after his birth in Boston in 1910. Corwin, confined to a wheelchair, could not be heard at first. Instead, his words were delivered to the crowd by Michael C. Keith who, with Mary Ann Watson – both profes- sors of broadcasting history – had brought the long-forgotten journal to publication. After a while, bookstore personnel located a microphone and Corwin took over. His voice, while soft, is as clear and as sharp as his mind and wit. He took note of writers in the audience, and was pleased to acknowledge the presence of another Los Angeles literary treasure, Ray Bradbury, who was also in a wheelchair and made his way through the crowd to greet Corwin, pro- viding a wonderful moment in Los Angeles literary history. Reading from the book were Corwin’s friends Eva Marie Saint, the great actress, and her husband, the direc- tor Jeff Hayden.

Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow gives a good sense of the great writing and wit: I saw the church sitting under a distant cumu- lus cloud of overwhelming magnificence – a mighty towering cauliflower head crowned and studded with white, ivory and golden botryoids, the peaks rouged here and there by the rays of a sinking sun. The trunk of the cloud shaded to blues and purples out of the night that was advancing over the plains to the east. This apocalyptic mass sat, excessively and redundantly, on top of the most grandiloquent cathedral in the world, itself an architectural curiosity. I have seen some great skies in my years of looking up and down at clouds, but there never had been one to match that vision of tufts and battlements, that nest of hail and thunder, rising above the vari-colored, spiraling domes and cupolas built for a mad emperor. AFTERWARD, we wanted Corwin to auto- graph the book. The crowd was dense with others bent on the same mission. But I still had enough of a reporter’s skill – and rude- ness – to push my way through. He wrote: “For Bill and Nancy. The best. Norman Corwin.” His small, careful printing was similar to the neat cursive with which he wrote the journal. Brief handwrit- ten excerpts begin each chapter. “There was quite a throng to see us off,” he wrote as the journey began.

For the past year or so, the answer – at least among cineastes in and around downtown L.A. – has been USC. More specifically, the School of Cinematic Arts, where a new film series has, in effect, turned the three theatres of the brand spanking-new George Lucas Building into the city center’s premier art house. Since its debut in January, the Outside the Box Office series has given free sneak previews of more than 50 new releases in world cinema, documentary and indepen- dent film, with one or more of the filmmak- ers usually in attendance. The series has featured exotic fare from Canada, China, France, Germany, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Palestine, the Philippines, Russia, Thailand and the United Kingdom, not to mention from all around the United States. The brainchild of SCA special events coordinator Alex Ago, the screenings hap- pen Wednesday nights, and frequently on Fridays and Sundays, too. Sometimes Ago squeezes in a double feature in which, he admits, the films can be extremely mis- matched, “but there are so many wonder- ful movies coming out, and they have to be PHOTO BY MARK BERNDT screened before they open commercially, and I have limited space.” Ago got the idea for the series while booking screenings for film critic Leonard Maltin’s popular “Theatrical Film Sympo- sium” class, which spotlights a new release each week. “I’d been getting all sorts of interesting film screening invitations from the distribu- tors I work with,” says Ago, who is himself an ardent film lover. “And I thought it was USC TROJAN FAMILY MAGAZINE spring 2010 17 a shame not to take advantage of this stuff.” Many of the films and filmmakers didn’t fit with Maltin’s course schedule. So, Ago decided to book them anyway, as a public service to the USC community. His efforts mean that USC students no longer have to trek to the Westside or Hol- lywood, where L.A.’s major art houses are located, to see first-run documentaries, for- eign films and indie projects. “In fact, a lot of this screening series came from the fact that I don’t like to drive to West Hollywood to go to the Sunset 5, but I still want to see these movies,” says Ago. “And it’s so hard to keep track of when they’re coming out, how long they’ll be in theatres – it’s just ridiculous how limited the releases are – and what theatres they’ll be playing in. I wanted to remove all the guesswork and all the travel involved with getting to see these wonderful movies.” Recent screenings have included Lee Daniels’ Precious, a double-prizewinner at Sundance; Spanish auteur Pedro Almodó- var’s Broken Embraces, Chinese director John Woo’s Red Cliff, and Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore’s Baaria. Outside the Box Office is only possible because of the new SCA complex, which boasts three theatres: the 200-seat Ray Stark Family Theatre which is “35mm capable,” a 106-seat theatre unpretentiously known as “Room 112” and a 70-seat theatre that goes by “Room 110.” The beauty of the series is that it is cost- neutral. “It doesn’t cost me anything to run these films, because they’re promotional screen- ings or sneak previews that the studios and distributors give to us for free,” he explains. Ago doesn’t even require the services of a projectionist. “I started this as something I could manage personally with my staff Arts & Culture Art Films?

Even before the financial crisis hit, top museum directors worldwide knew they were operating in a bubble that couldn’t last. “Everything just got out of control,” says Selma Holo, director of the Inter- national Museum Institute and the USC Fisher Museum of Art. “Exhibitions got more and more and more expensive, and more and more people needed to come in order to justify the cost.” Holo and Mari-Tere Alvarez PhD ‘03 of the J. Paul Getty Museum co-edited a timely new book on the subject, Beyond the Turnstile: Making the Case for Museums and Sustainable Values (Altamira Books). “We really searched for a common language that would allow museums to evaluate themselves,” says Holo. “The resulting handbook allows museums to look into the future and try to figure out how they can prove and make the case that they are indeed indispensible to society.” – Suzanne Wu 18 USC TROJAN FAMILY MAGAZINE spring 2010 PHOTO BY TAKE ONE PRODUCTIONS IMAGINE SETTING OUT to be Shakespeare, G. B. Shaw and Tom Stoppard all rolled into one. Immodest as it sounds, that’s the goal Girish Karnad has set himself. But Karnad – who was at USC in Octo- ber, thanks to the support of the Visions and Voices program – has something in common with the Bard: He is probably the greatest playwright in his language (Kan- nada) as well as a popular actor, a prolific screenwriter and a successful film director. (If Shakespeare were alive today, does any- one doubt he’d be making movies?) Indian theatre is a fledgling art form, virtually nonexistent before 1947, Karnad explained at a well-attended Bing Theatre event produced by the School of Theatre. “The last of the great Sanskrit plays was written in the 9th century,” he recounted. Then came a thousand-year hiatus. “Play- writing stopped in India. Until the 19th cen- tury, there are no plays in any language.” Under colonial rule, Indian playwriting revived, but being a purely profit-driven enterprise, “no good plays came out,” in Karnad’s judgment. “Really serious play- writing begins only after Independence.” In the last 50 years, a generation of play- DRAMA KING Global Thespian Famed Indian playwright Girish Karnad sees his work staged by USC theatre students. wrights – with Karnad at the forefront – has taken upon itself the Herculean task of fill- ing the vacuum. Winner of his homeland’s highest cul- tural honors, Karnad, 71, draws on pri- mary sources ranging from oral tradition to Hindu sacred texts to East India Company archives. “I’m challenged to try all forms,” he says, “because I’m creating an entirely new body, a new living tradition. This is felt not only by me but by other play- wrights of my generation. That accounts for the variety of styles in which all of us write: historical plays, musicals. There’s almost a desperate need to create a tradition for the language.” (Languages, really. India offi- cially has 29 major ones, though hundreds more are widely spoken.) The occasion for Karnad’s visit to USC was the staging of excerpts from his large body of work. Theatre professor Jack Rowe teamed with MFA acting students to pres- ent three scenes from different plays. In Naga Mandala (1993), based on a folktale, a neglected wife succumbs to the charms of a cobra, magically disguised as her husband. The scene that Rowe staged was from the play’s prologue, in which a storyteller spies on a gathering of gossiping flames. Yes, in Indian folklore, flames can talk. A quaint conceit would have it that extinguished flames don’t die; they rekindle someplace else, to chatter the night away. In the scene from The Fire and the Rain (1999), a priest’s wife encounters her old lover, returned from the jungle after years of solitude vainly seeking enlightenment. The third scene, taken from The Dreams of Tipu Sultan (2000), re-imagines how the East India Company – with an assist from the future Duke of Wellington – plotted the death of the famous Tiger of Mysore, an 18th-century warrior-prince. Why these three scenes? “I wanted to show that this is a writer who does not write the same play again,” says Rowe, who col- laborated with Karnad in the selection of the scenes. The evening ended in a Q&A led by USC theatre dean Madeline Puzo. It was Puzo, incidentally, who commis- sioned Karnad to write The Fire and the Rain for the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. Karnad answered a barrage of questions with characteristic wit. He ended by saying: “I’m overwhelmed.

IT SOUNDED TOO GOOD to be true. Pristine metal 78-rpm masters of more than a hun- dred recordings made by folk musician Woody Guthrie in the mid-1940s, including a few songs that had never been released, had been unearthed in cardboard barrels in a basement in Brooklyn. But it was true. The aluminum masters had belonged to Herbert Harris, who had briefly been a business partner of Moses Asch at Disc Records. When Asch and Harris parted company, Harris received approximately half of the masters Guthrie recorded in April and May 1944. After Harris died, his wife took custody of the barrels. When she died in 1999, they went to a neighbor, who opened them 60 years after the music had been recorded. It turned out that the sound quality of the discs was exceptional. “Wow, he’s here,” said Nora Guthrie, Woody’s daughter, when she heard them. She told The Boston Globe: “Truthfully, for years I never got why Woody himself was such a popular performer. They’re good songs, but on recordings his voice always sounded muffled. It’s like I’m able to hear it for the first time now, and it all makes sense to me.” Once the contents of the barrels were inventoried in 2006 and the peerless sound restoration engineer Doug Pomeroy was consulted, a call went out to the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism’s Ed Cray, whose 2004 book, Ramblin’ Man, is the definitive Guthrie biography. Rounder Records, which wanted to re lease the best of the recordings, asked Cray to give his recommendations on songs to include and to write liner notes. The “notes,” which he wrote with Rounder co-founder Bill Nowlin, turned out to be a 14,000-word booklet that is part of a 54-song, four-CD boxed set titled My Dusty Road. Cray and Nowlin worked on the notes over a six-month period, during part of which Cray continued his full teaching load. The set came out in late August. One gem among the previously unreleased works is a humorous song called “Bad Repetation.” (The misspelling is deliberate.) But the value of the recordings is their quality, Cray notes. “I had no idea how good they were,” he says. “This is Woody Guthrie as nobody has ever heard him before.” Cray says the short-lived Asch and Harris partnership may have come about because aluminum and shellac (both needed to cre- ate recording masters) were scarce during World War II. “Asch had aluminum and Harris had shellac,” Cray says. Many of the recordings were made in marathon sessions during April 1944, when Guthrie was in between voyages in the Merchant Marine. (He made three voy- ages, including two in which his boat barely survived sinking. Once, before leaving the vessel, Guthrie gathered up all the guitars and fiddles he could find.) For these sessions, Guthrie invited gui- tarist and fellow Merchant Marine Cisco Houston to accompany him, along with blind harmonica player Sonny Terry. They produced about 300 discs, including mul- tiple takes of the same song. The “box” for the CDs is a scaled-down version of a vintage suitcase. Inside is a rep- lica of Guthrie’s business card (“Woody, Th’ Dustiest of Th’ Dustbowlers”), a 1947 book- ing notice that shows him being paid $15 to play at a children’s party and a postcard he wrote in 1951. – Allison Engel mild “three-day fever” with full recovery. “[The] 1918 flu was far more lethal than any since. Nonetheless, there is particular concern for the current swine flu, which seems to target pregnant women,” says Finch, who is also the ARCO/William F. Kieschnick Professor in the Neurobiology of Aging. “Prospective moms should reduce risk of influenza by vaccination.” The researchers found that men born in the first few months of 1919 – the second or third trimester during the height of the epi- demic – had a 23.1 percent greater chance of having heart disease after the age of 60 than the overall population. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. For women, those born in the first few months of 1919 were not significantly more likely to have cardiovascular disease than their peers, pointing to possible gender differences in effects of flu exposure. But women born in the second quarter of 1919 – the first trimester during the height of the epidemic – were 17 percent more likely to have heart disease than the general popula- tion in later life, according to the study. In addition, the researchers examined height during World War II enrollment for 2.7 million men born between 1915 and 1922 and found that average height increased every successive year except for the period coinciding with fetal exposure to the flu pandemic. Men who were exposed to the H1N1 flu in the womb were slightly shorter on average than those born just a year later or a year before, according to the study. The researchers controlled for known season-of- birth effects and maternal malnutrition. “Prenatal exposure to even uncompli- cated maternal influenza can have lasting consequences later in life,” says Crimmins, professor of gerontology and sociology at USC. “The lingering influences from the 1918-19 influenza pandemic extend the hypothesized roles of inflammation and infections in cardiovascular disease from our prior Science and PNAS articles to prena- tal infection by influenza.” – Suzanne Wu PEOPLE EXPOSED TO an H1N1 strain of influenza A in utero were significantly more likely to have cardiovascular disease later in life, according to a new study published in the Journal of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease. “Our point is that during pregnancy, even mild sickness from flu could affect develop- ment with longer consequences,” says senior author and University Professor Caleb Finch at the USC Davis School of Gerontology. Finch, USC Davis School professor Eileen Crimmins, lead author Bhashkar Mazum- der (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago), Douglas Almond (Columbia University) and Kyung Park (University of Chicago) looked at more than 100,000 individuals born around the time of the 1918 influenza pandemic in the United States. After first appearing in the spring and all but disappearing in the summer, the 1918 pandemic “resurged to an unprecedentedly virulent October-December peak,” the researchers write.

The finding helps explain why chronic myeloid leukemia cells become drug-resis- tant and may lead to the development of therapies that improve survival in patients. Researchers led by Markus Müschen, director of the leukemia and lymphoma program at the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, found that the protein, acti- vation-induced cytidine deaminase, which normally mutates antibody genes in B cells, triggers resistance to Gleevec, the standard treatment for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Chronic myeloid leukemia cells often develop resistance to Gleevec, limit- ing treatment options for many patients liv- ing with the illness. The multi-investigator study, which fea- tures major contributions from USC faculty colleagues Michael Lieber, John Groffen, Yong-mi Kim and Nora Heisterkamp, was published in Cancer Cell. “Before this, we did not know why some patients developed resistance to Gleevec,” Müschen said. “Now that we know at least one mechanism, we can work to develop therapies to counter the effects of activa- tion-induced cytidine deaminase in the chronic phase of the disease.” Every year, 4,500 people are diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in the United States; nearly 25,000 have the dis- ease today. Chronic myeloid leukemia is a slowly progressing cancer that usually occurs during or after middle age and rarely occurs in children. Patients with the disease have an unusually high number of hematopoietic stem cells (blood cell progenitors) that were slated to become immune system cells but instead develop into cancerous cells that damage the bone marrow and blood. Gleevec increases overall survival for chronic myeloid leukemia patients to 95 per- cent over a five-year period. When patients develop resistance to the drug, they quickly transition from the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia to a condition called blast crisis progression, or fatal B lymphoid blast crisis, with an average survival range of less than seven months. The ongoing project is supported by two research grants from the National Institutes of Health. – Leslie Ridgeway DRUG DETECTIVES Leukemia Puzzle Keck scientists make progress on discovering why chronic myeloid leukemia cells become drug-resistant. nett Foundation funds social activism by supporting LGBT programs, voting rights, handgun safety, animal rights, arts and education programs. Bohnett, who is low-key and person- able, does not come across as the major player he is in Southern California. “Don’t let the unassuming demeanor fool you,” stated a 2009 profile in the Los Angeles Times Magazine. “He has an unwavering determination to right wrongs, a very big heart and a fierce intelligence.” About his role as board chairman for the LA Phil, it is not exaggerating to say that Bohnett is shaping a new era for classical and contemporary music in Los Angeles. Being involved in the recruiting and hiring of Dudamel, who has energized the city and the global music world, is one thing. But helping create a network of youth orchestras mod- eled on El Sistema, the Venezuelan music education system from which Dudamel emerged, has the potential for extraordi- nary social and cultural change in the city. Bohnett has been an enthusiastic backer of new youth orchestras in the city. The first group of 102 youngsters played at the Hol- lywood Bowl. Younger, “feeder” orchestras are in the works. “Dudamel has said that the orchestra is a perfect metaphor for a community, and I agree,” says Bohnett. Recently, Bohnett returned to the USC Marshall School of Business to speak to Adlai Wertman’s class on social entrepreneurship. Wertman said: “David’s message was loud and clear – use your education, experience and resources to attack injustices.” Bohnett grew up in a socially active fam- ily in Hinsdale, Ill. When he moved to California after grad school in Michigan, he helped found the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation chapter here and wit- nessed firsthand how education and aware- ness can change public attitudes. “It’s important to know we all have a voice,” he says. Whether through music, social issues, preservation or entrepreneur- ship, Bohnett, in his quiet but determined way, is making himself heard. – Allison Engel WHEN INCOMING LA Phil music director Gustavo Dudamel conducted his ground- breaking first concert at the Hollywood Bowl in September, David Bohnett ’78, new chair of the LA Phil board, experi- enced a welter of emotions. He was thrilled at the overflow audience of all ages and ethnicities – many of them first-time Philharmonic attendees. He was moved by “Ode to Joy” played by the young musicians of Youth Orchestra Los Angeles – a project dear to his heart. And he felt a pang of nostalgia, remem- bering how he came to USC at the age of 18 with two suitcases and not knowing a soul.

In 2009, W. W. Norton published an anthology of new poetry he edited with Cole Swensen, American Hybrid, to rave reviews. The ninth collection of his own poetry, The Face: A Novella in Verse, recently has been set to music by USC Thornton School of Music composer Donald Crockett for a professional chamber opera. St. John also team-teaches an extraordinary interdisciplinary class, “Writer and Composer,” that brings graduate poetry and music-composition students together to create sophisticated, contem- porary pieces. He spoke with USC Trojan Family Magazine’s Allison Engel. Your anthology identifies poets who do not neatly fall into the experimental or conventional categories. Why categorize at all? It’s been the fashion of criticism in this country to want to categorize poets, and my co-editor writes about this scholarly preoc- cupation in her section on “the war of the anthologies.” The truth is that most poets tire of these limiting definitions pretty quickly. Have critics pigeonholed you? They have seemed not to know where to put me. My influences are so located in film and 20th-century cinema as well as really old-line 19th- century French symbolist poetry that I think I’ve always been somewhat of an anachronism. In the poetry world, is it usually every man or woman for him or herself? I feel really fortunate that when I was a young poet, I had Philip Levine and Donald Justice, Charles Wright and Norman Dubie, as well as Galway Kinnell and Adrienne Rich in my corner. My first book was taken by Houghton Mifflin because Galway Kinnell sent my poems to his editor. And he did it without telling me. It was a simple act of generosity. How did you meet Kinnell? I was 19 years old. Kinnell came to Cal State Fresno where Philip Levine taught. I was lucky because all of the great poets in America at that time came through Fresno to read because they wanted to visit with Levine. By the time I was 20, I had met W. S. Merwin and all the poets I mentioned earlier except for Dubie. It changed my life. Here were these men and women whom I admired more than any adults I had ever met. It made being a poet a very reasonable goal. This spring will be your fourth “Poet and Composer” class. How has it evolved? We now have a class of singers attached to the class, which means we can workshop the compositions and pieces as we go along. A number of the compositions have gone on to be performed outside class – one at Carnegie Hall. Also, the collaborations of the poets and composers have gone on in several cases for years. This is the best example of an “across- the-college” course that I have seen in any university, in terms of fulfillment of its potential. How did the class come about? [Composition professor] Frank Ticheli asked if I would be interested in teaching with him. What he did not know is that I had tried to make this class happen about 13 years before. But times have changed and it has grown into the most fun teaching I’ve ever done. What Frank Ticheli has been able to do in bringing to the poets a complex understanding of how to write for music has been nothing short of breathtaking. Did the course lead to your collaboration with Donald Crockett? It did. I first met Don when he came to talk to the class about his setting of Michael Ondaatje’s poem The Cinnamon Peeler. Then Don asked if he could set two of my poems and I said, “Of course.” About three years ago he said, “Let’s do a chamber opera together.” And so I wrote the libretto, and Don got a Guggenheim to write the opera. He’s lined up the most famous conductor of new music, Gilbert Rose. Paul Desveaux, who directed Philip Glass’s Les Enfants Terribles, is the director. That one course has sparked quite the chain reaction. I’m consistently stunned and thrilled by the quality of work done in the class. It’s fostered not only these valuable student relationships that have gone on and out into the world, but also these faculty relationships. Classes like this should be the norm, not the exception. l A Conversation with DAVID ST.

Each year, it turns students’ big ideas into big plans of action, sending students out into the workforce to launch their own carefully mapped and creatively conceived ventures. In a tough economy, that also requires having the skills and resources to create their own jobs. According to the Kauffman Foundation’s annual Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, the recession is actually spurring entrepreneurship; Americans started more businesses last year than in the year prior.

But 2009 Marshall grad Jonathon Nostrant turned the beeping appliance into a booming business. He founded Moshi Lifestyle, a company that makes voice-activated alarm clocks. In response to commands uttered from bed or across the room, the Moshi clock calls out the time, date and temperature, sets an alarm, turns on a night light, and lulls users to sleep with rainforest sounds. In its first year, the company did more than $2 million in sales to retailers including Bed, Bath & Beyond and Brookstone. Nostrant and his clock won first place in the undergraduate category of the Greif Center’s 2009 New Venture competition, an honor that proved to him “that hard work really pays off.” And Nostrant has never shied away from hard work. The son of a San Fernando Valley entrepre- neur, Nostrant launched his first business when he was 12. “I started a DJ company called DJs at Your Door,” he says. “We provided dancers, emcees and DJs for bar mitzvahs and birthdays.” He always knew that one day he’d trade dance floors for circuit boards, as electronics and computers have been lifelong passions. While visiting China as a junior at USC, he learned about new voice-recognition technol- ogy that enables electronic devices to respond to verbal commands. “It’s going to be the future,” says Nostrant, who envisioned not only an alarm clock that could be controlled without pushing buttons, but also a series of products based around this core technology. And the name Moshi? It’s a word used when answering the phone in Japan. “It’s just a fun name,” Nostrant says. “Moshi moshi!” Back on campus, he applied his Greif coursework to his new idea, testing its feasibil- ity, creating a business plan, brand and sample product, and marketing it. Next up for Moshi Lifestyle are more voice- recognition gadgets from radios to iPhone docking stations. “Basically,” Nostrant quips, “we’re taking over the nightstand.” www.moshilifestyle.com Jonathon Nostrant [Partner, Moshi Lifestyle, developed a voice-activated alarm clock, 22] Starshine Roshell is a syndicated columnist, author and journalism professor at Santa Barbara City College.

BusinessWeek and U.S. News & World Report have called the center one of the nation’s best entrepreneurial programs, and both the Princeton Review and Entrepreneur magazine have ranked the program no. 1 in the country based on course offerings, opportunities to learn outside of the classroom, and number of former students and professors who have started businesses. Indeed, Chris DeWolfe and Josh Berman of MySpace are Greif graduates (both MBA ’97); Kinko’s founder Paul Orfalea ’71 is an adjunct faculty member. USC has been offering a series of entrepreneurial courses since 1971; it’s the oldest program of its kind in the United States. But it was in 1998 that investment banker Lloyd Greif, who graduated from the program with his MBA in 1979, donated $5 million to endow the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. At age 42, Greif was the first entrepreneur graduate in the country to endow an entrepreneur program, and his was the largest gift ever given to USC from a person in his 40s. The son of an Auschwitz survivor, Greif had worked full-time at a Ralphs grocery store while pursuing his undergraduate economics degree at UCLA and then his master’s at USC. He launched his business, an entrepreneur’s investment bank called Greif & Co., with the help of alumni connections through the Trojan network, and his gift was a way to show his gratitude to the university. “Entrepreneurs are alchemists,” he once said. “They add value to existence – turning iron into gold – through strength of will, intelligence and a determination to succeed.” The Greif Center program may be uniquely situated for success. “Southern California is a significant entrepreneurial breeding ground, more so than a lot of other places,” says cen- ter director Gene Miller, citing the area’s diverse industries, from entertainment and hospitality to biotechnology and electronics. Greif students are required to take advantage of their locale by leaving campus to meet and interview successful IT’S A FACT: The entrepreneur doesn’t fall far from the tree. Many Greif Center graduates grew up watching their own parents launch companies. But Nicole Vietor ’08 didn’t just watch her dad run a business; she saw him attend and graduate from Greif while she was in high school. Now she runs her own successful busi- ness and credits Dad’s unwavering support – and indomitable spirit – for getting her there. A single father, Richard Vietor MBA ’03 (shown above) was enrolled at USC when, midway through his studies, he broke his neck in a diving accident. Paralyzed from the neck down, he returned to school in a wheelchair. As part of the program, he traveled to Mexico and Cuba to study international business. Due to his disability, Nicole accompanied him. She sat in on lectures, fascinated. She enrolled as an undergraduate and soon faced a small challenge of her own. “Trying to rent an apartment, there are so many ‘For Rent’ signs,” she says. “You call them and leave messages. By the time an owner calls back, you’re like, ‘Which apartment are you?’ “ Nicole solved the problem with a busi- ness venture: a text-messaging system that puts apartment managers in instant touch with potential renters. Text-A-Listing assigns a 6-digit “smart code” to each rental unit. Prospective renters see the number on a rental sign and send a text, getting an imme- diate return message any time of day with detailed apartment information. If interested, they text the apartment manager. In her first four months of operation, she was serving 20 large apartment complexes. Of course, there were some hurdles. “It would be nice if my cash flow was what I predicted it would be,” she says, laughing. “And I didn’t predict all the technological delays.” When stuck, she thinks about her primary investor: her dad, who’s walking now, though doctors said he never would. “He’s taught me to overcome adversity,” she says.

Students also are teamed up with established companies to help solve real business problems. “The exercises are designed to force you to get out,” Miller says. “You think this category is your customer? Go talk to some of them. Talking to 25 potential customers gives you a wealth of information.” More than 1,000 students are typically enrolled in the pro- gram, which welcomes both business majors and students from other disciplines who declare a minor in entrepreneur- ship. “We have had students from virtually every school at USC, from engineering to music to film,” says professor Patrick Henry, who coordinates the undergraduate program. Many students dream of launching their own businesses, but some hope to apply entrepreneurial thinking to the corporate world, finding new ways to solve industrial problems. The center offers courses in management, growth and investing, but what sets it apart from other programs are two classes in particular. One is “Feasibility.” “It’s the missing link between ‘I have an idea’ and ‘I have a business plan,’ ” Henry says. “It allows students to work through a highly struc- tured evaluation of the venture potential of each idea, to make refinements and fixes to enhance the viability.” The second is the “Business Plan” class. Whereas other schools treat the plan as a document, Greif students learn to view it as a “to-do list”; the focus isn’t on writing the plan, but on executing it. “What we’re trying to accomplish is envisioning the busi- ness,” Miller says. “People often fail to set priorities. Rather than spending time, energy and resources getting ready to get started, they need to say what is the most important thing for me to do, like get sales, and then do what is necessary to make that happen as soon as possible.” Among the many Greif Center students who have taken these lessons to heart are the four young entrepreneurs pro- filed here: a technophile who’s making it easier to wake up in the morning, a woman who used text-messaging to solve an apartment-hunting hitch, the proud owner of downtown L.A.’s newest culinary hot spot and a man who turned a beer bottle label into a booming beverage business. l If you have questions or comments on this article, please send them to magazines@usc.edu. “Feasibility is the missing link between ‘I have an idea’ and ‘I have a business plan, ’ ” professor Patrick Henry says. “It allows students to work through a highly structured evaluation of the venture potential of each idea, to make refinements and fixes to enhance the viability. ” IT’S NEARLY NOON and the line has already begun forming down the block.
