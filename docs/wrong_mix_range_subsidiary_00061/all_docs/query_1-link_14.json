I've been an entrepreneur since age 17, and I semi-retired at age 32. I now travel the world, making money and having fun. *WHY YOU NEED A CALL* ⭐️ I've helped over 2,000 early-stage, established, and emerging businesses globally. ⭐️ I'm solely on Clarity.fm to give a small portion of my time at a highly subsidized rate, to EMPOWER and impact entrepreneurs' businesses to achieve their greatest goals and potential. One-on-One consulting with me is at a much higher rate. Clarity is my way of giving back.\n\nSales leader and Silicon Valley veteran. Founding team at Close.io, ElasticSales Built multiple profitable 7-Figure Saas businesses. I have made over 20,000+ cold calls, sent countless emails, and closed millions of dollars in deals in my sales career. I've sold to VPs and C-Level executives in Fortune 500 companies as well as doctors, lawyers, and even restaurant owners. Thanks to thousands of sales conversations in dozens of industries, I’ve learned that Sales is fundamentally very simple - It is result-driven communication The best salespeople are the best communicators, who know how to listen, understand a prospect's needs, build trust, and help them make mutually beneficial decisions. I've also learned that there is no magic bullet to building a successful playbook. The best sales leaders take a data-driven iterative approach, testing a multitude of sales strategies to find a unique combination with the highest ROI for a given business. I help founders and sales leaders become great at Sales and build a successful go-to-market strategy maximized for their unique business.\n\nYou need to talk to me if you are currently: writing a business plan, raising money, trying to launch or grow your startup, hitting a wall getting traction or funding, feeling overwhelmed and need help focusing your energy. I have deep experience in entrepreneurship, startups, writing business plans, raising money, venture capital and private equity, marketing and brand management, and general business strategy. As Venture Partner at Texas Venture Labs, I've worked with over 50 startups across all industries that have raised over $50M in the last 3 years. I have evaluated hundreds of business plans and judged in multiple investment competitions. I know what investors look for and how to show it to them. I have experience on both sides of the table. I started and sold a company and I just closed a seven figure round for my next startup. I have an MBA from the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas.\n\nMy 25-year entrepreneurial journey was probably inspired by my first venture into entrepreneurship many years before. I developed my first “app” using COBOL to manage the payroll at my part-time bar job while at university. It was even sold on a monthly subscription, a concept ahead of its time. I put my tech entrepreneurial ambitions on hold for the next decade while pursuing my sports passion, playing professional rugby league for the Parramatta Eels and the Balmain Tigers. Then, in 2001, amidst the Dot Com Boom, I founded MassMedia Studios, a digital agency driven by the drive to create innovative products and SaaS platforms. Our standout creation was the Traction Platform, a pioneering marketing automation tool. We expanded Traction globally with offices in New York and London. Simultaneously, we launched 2and2, an e-learning company specialising in creative e-learning products. In 2007, I successfully sold MassMedia and Traction, businesses experiencing 30% YoY growth and boasting clients like Unilever, Audi, and Diageo. My involvement continued with 2and2 as a non-executive director, which has now evolved into Cogniss, a no-code ecosystem to develop consumer and patient-facing digital health solutions based in the UK poised for substantial growth. Before founding Drive Yello in 2014, I ventured into Feverpitch Entertainment, a content creation company, and AppVillage, a virtual mobile app incubator. Drive Yello rekindled my focus on B2B platforms, which has remained my central pursuit for the past ten years. At the heart of the Drive Yello business is the ‘Yello’ platform, the smartest logistics platform that connects retailers to independent couriers to streamline deliveries for millions of Australians nationwide. In 2023, I founded the 4You Innovation Group, which is focused on developing technology and services to enable retailers to meet the ever-increasing demand for convenience. In line with this mission, we acquired the Hey You business, an order-ahead application targeting restaurants and cafes. I recently stepped down from my CEO role but remain on the board as a fractional executive working with the management and product teams. With a history of innovative product development and industry disruption, I have successfully built my career on being passionate about solving business problems with technology, developing teams, creating innovative products and initiating change in diverse industries. Steve Fanale has over 20 years of experience as a tech entrepreneur. He is the Founding CEO of Drive Yello, his 6th start-up, one of Australia’s leading last-mile delivery platform businesses.

In short, she's a professional hustler who loves to help other people develop fulfilling careers and attain both financial freedom and self-worth. As an IRS-licensed Enrolled Agent with a decade of practice experience, she wrote the first and only tax law book dedicated to indie developers and has frequently been called upon in the industry for her perspective on game dev tax matters. She teaches the best-selling Basics of Business For Indie Developers and Taxes For Indie Developers classes at Playcrafting NYC, and has spoken at Indiecade East, East Coast Game Developers' Conference, IGDA events, and guest-lectured at MBA programs on the business of games and career development for the self-employed. As CFO and Executive Producer of Himalaya Studios, Rachel oversaw their six-figure Kickstarter campaign and has advised game developers, publishers, and clients in other industries on how to form a successful campaign. Rachel resigned from the company in 2017 to focus on Sonic Toad Media & Consulting's coaching and writing services arms which currently lay the foundation for Sonic Toad Publishing. Frequently featured on the front page of Gamasutra, Rachel writes about business and lifestyle issues for game developers on the noted industry rag and is also an accomplished ghost-blogger. She effectively developed active and passive income streams that have enabled her to pursue game development without a full-time or part-time job and has made it a mission of Sonic Toad Consulting to help other indie developers and creative people do the same. Rachel's strategies have helped freelance writers get paid more and indie developers transition from traditional jobs to full-time hustling and thriving in the process.
