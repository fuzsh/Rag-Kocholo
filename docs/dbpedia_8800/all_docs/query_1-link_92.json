        "text": "As Lithuania prepares for a reburial ceremony of the 1863-1864 uprising leaders, the first Lithuanian-language edition of a memoir by Apolonia Sierakowska, the wife of one of the key commanders of the uprising, will be presented to the general public on Thursday.\n\nThe revised and supplemented edition of the book by Sierakowska, nÃ©e Dalewska, was originally published in Polish, the National Museum of Lithuania said on Tuesday.\n\nIn the book, the wife of Zygmunt Sierakowski, known in Lithuania as Zigmantas Sierakauskas, shares her memories about her husband and the family, and the uprising against the Russian Empire.\n\nTwenty-one insurgents were executed in LukiÅ¡kÄs Square in Vilnius between 1863 and 1864. The remains were secretly buried on Gediminas Hill which was closed to the public at that time.\n\nArcheologists have unearthed the remains of 20 of the 21 executed insurgents, including those of Sierakowski and Konstanty Kalinowski, known in Lithuania as Konstantinas Kalinauskas.\n\nThe remains will be reburied in the Lithuanian capital's Rasos Cemetery following a memorial service at Vilnius Cathedral on November 22.\n\nThe names of the insurgents will be written in Lithuanian, Polish and Belarusian.\n\nThe January Uprising of 1863-1864 was the longest insurrection in Poland and Lithuania against the tsarist rule after the partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The rebellion was ruthlessly crushed and followed by strict measures aimed against the landed gentry."
