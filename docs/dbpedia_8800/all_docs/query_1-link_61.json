        "text": "The November Uprising (183031), or PolishRussian War 183031 also known as the Cadet Revolution, was an armed rebellion in the heartland of partitioned Poland against the Russian Empire. The uprising began on 29 November 1830 in Warsaw when the young Polish officers from the local Army of the Congress Poland's military academy revolted, led by lieutenant Piotr Wysocki. They were soon joined by large segments of societies of Lithuania, Belarus, and the right-bank of Ukraine. Despite some local successes, the uprising was eventually crushed by a numerically superior Imperial Russian Army under Ivan Paskevich. Czar Nicholas I decreed that henceforth Poland was an integral part of Russia, with Warsaw little more than a military garrison, its university closed.\n\nArms of the Kingdom of Poland\n\nOn a 5 złoty coin, 1831\n\nArms: Pp. of Poland and Lithuania\n\nCrown: A royal crown\n\nThe arms were approved on 19 February 1831 by the sejm of the Kingdom of Poland that dethroned the Russian Tsar as King of Poland..\n\nThe conservative politician Stanisław Barzykowski, a participant in the debates of that sejm, wrote about the arms: by placing the Pogoń on all our national coats of arms, we shall at once make it clear to all governments and peoples that we have raised the battle flag in order to recover the whole of Poland within its former borders.[1]\n\nStamp and print of the Seal of the\n\nCommander in chief the the November uprising, 1831\n\nPolish Army Museum, Warsaw\n\nThe January Uprising started on 22 January 1863 in the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and was directed against the Russian Empire. It lasted until the last of the insurgents were captured with the arrestation of Romualdo Traugutt on 10 April 1864.\n\nThe Russian defeat in the Crimean War (1853-1856) sparked the Polish and Lithuanian patriots hopes that perhaps joint efforts would restore the country's statehood. A secret organization was set up which had its supporters in Lithuania, Poland and Belarus. These however, disintegrated into a \"white\" and a \"red\" movement and represented not only different social classes, but also pursued differen political goals. The Reds were led by the democratic-minded representatives Sigismund Sierakauskas, Konstanty Kalinowski and Anton Mackevičius. The majority of them were peasants who were in favor of armed struggle and to realize equal rights for all.\n\nThe Whites consisted of a union of the nobility and the szlachta, and were led by James Geitoras, Romualdo Traugutt and Alexander Oskerka. They preferred to avoid armed struggle. However, both Reds and Whites had a common goal - to restore the eighteenth century Polish-Lithianian Commonwealth.. This idea is reflected in the arms of May 1863 combining the heraldic Polish, Lithuanian and Ruthenian symbols\n\nIn the initial period of the January uprising the arms of the former November uprising of 1830 were imitated. These were also used after the January uprising of 1863 until in May of that year new arms were adopted. These arms were used until the spring of 1864 but had a tough unofficial life in the last years of Russian domination.\n\nA Central National Committee (KCN)  a secret organisation of the Reds - operated from June 1862 in Warsaw. It emerged from the Warsaw Municipal Committee with the intention of taking control of the entire conspiratorial movement in the Polish Kingdom. It led the preparations for the January Uprising: by expanding its underground organization, levying a national tax and calling a national police. On 12 August 1862 it issued a proclamation promising the peasants enfranchisement for redemption, as well as promising Jews a free society and the same rights as Poles. In a proclamation of 1 September 1862. the Committee the proclaimed the independence of the nation and demanded obedience from society as a whole.\n\nThe arms of the committee was parted per pale of Poland and Lithuania and crowned with a royal crown. These arms were the same as the arms of the kingdom of 1831\n\nNational Revolutionary Committee\n\nSeal of the National Revolutionary Comittee, 1863 (reversed)\n\nColl Ausros Museum, Sukuleliu\n\nThis committee existed from August to December 1862\n\nThe 6 issue of Ruch (Movement) of 12 October 1862 contains the imprint of the seal of the Central National Committee. Engraved on it was the Polish-Lithuanian coat of arms.\n\nFrom that moment on other introduced during this period of national offices seals It showed just such an emblem.\n\nOn 19 January 1863 the Central National Committee was transformed into the Provisional National Government (19.01-13.03.1863 & 21.03-23.05.1863) which proclaimed an uprising on 22 January, at the same time issuing a decree emancipating the peasants and promising land to the landless who would take part in the uprising.\n\nIn February 1863 Ludwik Mieroslawski (1814-78) arrived in Poland to become Commander-in-Chief (Dyktator) of the January uprising. After two lost battles in Krzywosądz and Kujawa (19 & 21 February) and a conflict with his rival commander Marian Langiewicz, he decided to return to Paris. He withdrew from politics after the Franco-Prussian War (1870).\n\nIn his term of office a seal was used with the inscription: DYKTATOR KOMMIS WYKONAWCZA (Supreme Commander, Executive Commission). In the center was an impaled of Poland and Lithuania.\n\nA print of it is rare because it authenticated but a small number of documents. It was drawn up specifically for the Executive Committee, which was transformed into the Central Committee after the the appointment of Marian Langiewicza as Commander-in-Chief (Dyktator)\n\nMarian Langiewicz (1827-87) was appointed Commander-in-Chief (Dyktator) of the uprising, with the rank of General on 11 March 1863. A week later, after the battles of Chrobrzem and Grochowiska he collapsed and left the fighting area and passed on March 19 to Galicia.\n\nThe Provisional National Government was restored on 21 March 21.03-23.05.1863\n\nAfter April 1863 the Central National Committee returned to the old seal which was used until 10 May 1863 when it was officially called National Government.\n\nThree-field coat of arms of the Republic of 10 May 1863\n\nSeal of the National Governement of 10.05.1863\n\nThe National Government of the January Uprising combined the arms of Poland and Lithuania with the arms of Rus - St. Michael the Archangel - for the first time in history. Such combined arms were adopted on 10 May 1863 and came on the governement documents and seals surrounded by the name of the office or service.\n\nThe arms are:\n\nArms: Tierced per point arched: 1. Gules, an eagle Argent, in his dexter a sword and in his sinister a latin cross (Poland); 2. Gules/Azure, a rider Argent swinging a sword with his dexter and bearing a shield charged with a double cross (Lithuania); 3. Gules/Argent, the archangel Michael supporting a sword with his dexter and a shield charged wit a cross with his sinister (Rus).\n\nCrown: The crown of the Jagiellones\n\nMotto: RÓWNOŚĆ WOLNOŚĆ NIEPODLEGŁOŚĆ (Equality Freedom Independence)\n\nThe tree-sided shield crowned with the crown of the Jagiellones is a symbol of the unitity of the republic. Each of the figures has a cross and a sword which symbolize the common struggle of Poles, Lithuanians and Ruthenians for their faith and independence.\n\nStamp of the National Government with a triple coat of arms surmounted by a crown and surrounded by the words: NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. EQUALITY FREEDOM INDEPENDENCE is on nr. 16 of Ruch magazine from 1863. After 27 June 1863 a secret press, leaflets and all prints were stamped with the seal of the National Government Printing Works. This seal appears on Ruch number 17 of 1863.\n\nThere are two versions of the arms which probably may be ascribed to the two factions of the uprising: the Whites and the Reds.\n\nLitwa Srodkowa or the Republic of Central- or Middle Lithuania was created in 1920 following the staged rebellion of soldiers of the 1st LithuanianBelarusian Infantry Division of the Polish Army under Lucjan Żeligowski, supported by the Polish air force, cavalry and artillery. Centered on the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vilnius, the Republic served for eighteen months as a buffer state between Poland, upon which it depended, and Lithuania, which claimed the area. After a variety of delays, a disputed election took place on January 8, 1922, and the territory was annexed to Poland.\n\nThe republic was regarded by some as a Poland-dependent puppet state. Initially the Polish government denied that it was responsible for the false flag action that created the entity, but the Polish leader, Józef Piłsudski, subsequently acknowledged that he personally ordered Żeligowski to pretend that he was acting as a mutinous Polish officer.\n\nThe Polish-Lithuanian borders in the interbellum, while recognized by the Conference of Ambassadors of the Entente and the League of Nations, were not recognized by the Republic of Lithuania. In 1931 an international court in The Hague issued the statement that the Polish seizure of the city had been a violation of international law.\n\nThe arms of Litwa Srodkowa were the last arms in which the Polish Eagle and the Lithuanian rider, in the form of the Belarusian Pogoń, were combined. Initially these two figures were on the badge of the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Infantry Division which showed them superimposed, the eagle charged with the Pogoń."
