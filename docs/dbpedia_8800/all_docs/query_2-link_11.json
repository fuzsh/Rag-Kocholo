        "text": "Ukraine gained independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and has since veered between seeking closer integration with Western Europe and being drawn into the orbit of Russia, which sees its interests as threatened by a Western-leaning Ukraine.\n\nEurope's second largest country, Ukraine is a land of wide, fertile agricultural plains, with large pockets of heavy industry in the east.\n\nWhile Ukraine and Russia share common historical origins, the west of the country has closer ties with its European neighbours, particularly Poland, and nationalist sentiment has been strongest there.\n\nA significant minority of the population uses Russian as its first language, particularly in the cities and the industrialised east.\n\nAn uprising against pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014 ushered in a series of Western-leaning governments.\n\nBut Russia used the opportunity to seize the Crimean peninsula and arm insurgent groups to occupy parts of the east, eventually launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nMr Zelensky's initial claim to fame was playing a fictional president in a television comedy programme, and his victorious election campaign echoed his character's anti-establishment stance.\n\nHis Servant of the People party went on to win early parliamentary elections in July 2019, giving him control of both the executive and the legislature.\n\nIn his inaugural address, President Zelensky said ending the Moscow-run insurgency in the east would be his priority, and he went on to rally Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion in 2022.\n\nAfter the start of the invasion, he declared martial law across Ukraine and a general mobilisation of the armed forces. His leadership during the crisis has won him widespread international praise, and he has been described as a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance\n\nNational media have adopted a united patriotic agenda following the Russian annexation of Crimea and the armed conflict in the east.\n\nUkraine has banned relays of leading Russian TVs; in turn, areas under Russian or separatist control have seen pro-Kyiv outlets silenced.\n\nThe authorities also block access to some popular Russian websites and social networks.\n\nUkrainians have changed their media consumption since the start of the full-scale war, with social media replacing TV as a top news source for Ukrainians, new TV channels continuing to launch despite the conflict, and the complete loss of popularity of Russian outlets."
