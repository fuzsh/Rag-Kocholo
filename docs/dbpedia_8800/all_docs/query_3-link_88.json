Still, Putinâs decision came as a shock to many in Ukraine and across the world.\n\nSpeaking on Russian state television, he announced the launch of what he called a âspecial military operationâ to âdemilitarizeâ and âdenazifiyâ Ukraine.\n\nMoments later, the first explosions were heard across Ukraine.\n\nFebruary 24, 2022\n\nSnake Island\n\nDespite Putin threatening âconsequences you have never experienced in your historyâ for anyone trying to interfere, Ukraine was determined to fight back.\n\nAn exchange between Ukrainian and Russian fighters on the first day of the war became a symbol of this defiance.\n\nOutnumbered and ordered to surrender by an approaching Russian vessel, a small group of Ukrainian troops stationed on Snake Island, a tiny but strategic Black Sea outpost, responded by radio: âRussian warship: Go f**k yourself.â\n\nFebruary 24, 2022\n\nAntonov Airport battle\n\nThe capture of the Antonov airfield, a major cargo airport just north of Kyiv, was the first major victory notched up by the Russians.\n\nBut it didnât go according to Moscowâs plan.\n\nRussian troops inside the airport were encircled, without a chance to bring in reinforcements quickly.\n\nBy the time Ukrainian troops withdrew from the area, the airport had sustained so much damage it was not possible for Russia to use it to resupply.\n\nThe worldâs largest plane, the Antonov An-225, was destroyed during the battle.\n\nFebruary 25, 2022\n\nZelenskyâs âWeâre hereâ video\n\nAmid the chaos of the opening hours of the war, rumors started to swirl about Ukraineâs leadership fleeing the country.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his team reacted by filming a video of themselves in central Kyiv, reassuring the nation.\n\nâWe are all here defending our independence, our state and it will remain so. Glory to our defenders! Glory to our women defenders! Glory to Ukraine!â Zelensky said.\n\nThe president had refused a US offer to evacuate, according to the Ukrainian government, saying: âI need ammunition, not a ride.â\n\nMarch 2, 2022\n\nRefugees at the Polish border\n\nThe brutality of Russiaâs invasion forced hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians to flee the country.\n\nThe United Nationsâ refugee agency (UNHCR) said that at least 100,000 people had left their homes in the first 24 hours of the military assault.\n\nThousands of cars formed queues at the borders, with people waiting several days to cross into neighboring Poland. Many others fled by train, waiting at train stations for days to cram into overcrowded carriages.\n\nThe majority were women, children and the elderly, as men of fighting age were largely prohibited from leaving the country.\n\nMarch 6, 2022\n\nIrpin bridge evacuation\n\nAs Russian troops began to approach Kyiv, people living in the northwestern suburbs of the capital got caught up in some of the heaviest street-by-street fighting of the war so far.\n\nThe main bridge crossing the Irpin River was destroyed by Ukrainians to thwart a Russian advance, which made evacuations difficult. According to the Ukrainian authorities, hundreds of civilians died attempting to flee.\n\nMarch 9, 2022\n\nMariupol maternity hospital attack\n\nA maternity hospital in the southeastern city of Mariupol was hit by a Russian missile. The attack came despite Russia agreeing to a 12-hour pause in hostilities to allow refugees to evacuate.\n\nA photo of a pregnant woman injured in the bombing being carried on a stretcher outside the devastated hospital became emblematic of Russiaâs senseless aggression against its neighbor.\n\nThe woman and her baby both died.\n\nMarch 16, 2022\n\nMariupol theater bombing\n\nThe bombing of Mariupolâs Drama Theater was among the most brazen of Russiaâs attacks on civilians.\n\nUkrainian officials estimated 1,300 people were sheltering in the theater in the centre of a city which had, at that point, been under siege for weeks.\n\nAround 300 died that day, authorities said at the time, but subsequent reports suggested the death toll could be higher.\n\nRussia, which had been bombarding the city for weeks, denied its forces were responsible.\n\nPainted on the ground outside the building â in giant Cyrillic letters visible from the air â was the word âCHILDREN.â\n\nApril 1, 2022\n\nBucha atrocities uncovered\n\nWhen Russian troops withdrew from Bucha in early April, they left behind a trail of destruction â and evidence of summary executions, brutality and indiscriminate shelling.\n\nImages showing dozens of bodies of civilians scattered around a single street in Bucha prompted calls for Russia to be investigated for war crimes.\n\nRussia made baseless claims that the images were fake and has prosecuted several Russian journalists and dissidents who spoke up about the killings for spreading âfalse informationâ about the war.\n\nInternational experts from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said they found âgrave breachesâ of international humanitarian law by Russian forces.\n\nApril 14, 2022\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva\n\nMoskva, the flagship of Russiaâs Black Sea fleet, sank on April 14.\n\nThe cause remains disputed. Ukraine said it hit the Moskva with anti-ship cruise missiles, sparking a fire that detonated stored ammunition. Russia blamed a fire of unknown origin.\n\nWhatever the reason, the loss of the guided-missile cruiser was a major military embarrassment for Russia and its biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in 40 years.\n\nMay 17, 2022\n\nMariupol steel plant defenders\n\nThe sprawling Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol became another symbol of Ukrainian resistance in the face of a much larger enemy.\n\nDefenders of the plant withstood weeks of relentless Russian bombardment before finally surrendering in May.\n\nUkrainian officials praised the fighters, saying their fierce defense of the complex had stalled Russian forces and prevented the capture of Zaporizhzhia, further west.\n\nSeptember 1, 2022\n\nRussian forces flee Kharkiv region\n\nA blistering Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Ukraine in September recaptured large swaths of territory and forced Russian troops to flee the Kharkiv region.\n\nMoscow tried to spin the hasty withdrawal as âregrouping.â\n\nBut in a sign of just how badly things were going for Russia, the military was publicly criticized by a number of high-profile Kremlin loyalists including Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who supplied thousands of fighters to the offensive.\n\nSeptember 21, 2022\n\nRussiaâs partial mobilization starts\n\nFollowing a string of embarrassing defeats in Ukraine, Putin announced Russiaâs first mobilization since World War II on September 21.\n\nThe controversial draft sparked protests â a rare sight in Russia â and an exodus of men of fighting age from the country.\n\nThe partial mobilization was beset by errors and produced fighters that were poorly equipped and largely untrained. However, it significantly increased Russiaâs troop numbers.\n\nNovember 12, 2022\n\nKherson liberation scenes\n\nAfter eight months of brutal Russian occupation, the southern city of Kherson was liberated on November 12, prompting scenes of celebration by residents.\n\nRussiaâs hasty withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnipro River was another bleak moment for Moscow, since Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured.\n\nPutin himself had formally declared Kherson to be Russian territory just weeks before his troopsâ retreat.\n\nDecember 21, 2022\n\nZelensky at the White House\n\nOn December 21, Zelensky traveled to Washington, DC to meet with US President Joe Biden at the White House and to address the US Congress.\n\nIt was a historic and consequential visit, the first foreign trip Zelensky had made since Russia launched its invasion.\n\nJust ahead of Zelenskyâs arrival, the Biden administration announced it was sending nearly $2 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine â including a sophisticated new Patriot air defense system.\n\nJanuary 25, 2023\n\nGermany approves sending tanks to Ukraine\n\nAfter weeks of geopolitical squabbling, a major moment arrived on January 25 when Germany announced it would provide Leopard 2 tanks to Kyiv and allow other European countries to export the German-made battle tank.\n\nAt the same time, Biden said the US would send 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine.\n\nThe move was hailed as a breakthrough in the Westâs military support for Ukraine and signaled a bullish view in the West about Ukraineâs ability to reclaim occupied territory.\n\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nBiden visits Kyiv\n\nBiden made a highly symbolic surprise visit to Kyiv on February 20, his first since Russiaâs full-scale invasion.\n\nStanding alongside Zelensky, the US president recalled how the pair spoke by phone as Russian forces rolled in. âOne year later, Kyiv stands. And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands,â Biden declared. âThe Americans stand with you and the world stands with you.â Zelensky said Bidenâs visit brought Ukraine âcloser to victory.â\n\nThe two leaders went on a walkabout in Kyiv just as air raid sirens sounded across the city."
