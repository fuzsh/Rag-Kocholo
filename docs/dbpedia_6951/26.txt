The Eckbach is a small river in the northeastern Palatinate and the southeastern Rhenish Hesse. It is slightly over 39 kilometres long.

Linguistic Research into the old name of die Eck shows that it is related to the Upper German word Ache, which means "river" or "creek" and is derived from the Old High German aha.
