XXV, No. 1 February, 1959 The Vice-Chancellor's Page Our building program at Sewanee is rapidrjj drawing to a climax — not, I trust, to a halt, but definitely to a climax. With the complete reno- vation of Walsh Hall to what will now become Walsh-Ellett Hall, and with the final completion of All Saints' Chapel after half a century, we shall! have a central quadrangle which would grace any university, and for which we should all be pro- foundly thankful. During literally all of my life, I and many others have looked at our unfinished Chapel and dreamed of what it could and should be. Now that it is actually rising to its full height and per- fection before our eyes, it is impossible to describe; the feelings which it invokes. And Walsh-Ellett, which externally will still look almost exactly as: old Walsh did, except for an extra cloister and some turrets which provide outside access to the classrooms and offices of the second floor, will be so completely transformed internally that we can take anyone into it gladly, without any of our former misgivings or apologies for its quaint delapidation. It will be as new and as strong and as convenient as the best of modern buildings, but it will still be the same familiar landmark on the campus. We still need more classrooms, offices, laboratories, a completely new library, and one more dormi- tory, before we can get rid of several \"temporary\" buildings ; but we are rapidly approaching our goal. Only three or four more stone buildings are required to give Sewanee as fine physical facilities as those of any institution of our size anywhere; and when we remember how many we have been given in the last few years, we cannot fail to feel that the goal is near at hand. I feel a deep personal gratitude to all of the alumni, friends, churchmen, and foundations that are making all of this possible; and I believe that this institution is at last going to have all that its founders thought it was to have had a century ago, and all that its intellectual and spiritual tradition so richly deserves. 30A°b £ E W A N E E V^E W S arillon Concerts Scheduled Dedication Set For April 12 Sewanee's impressive fifty-six bells ootal weight: twenty-three tons), now ured in 134-foot Shapard Tower, are fast becoming the musical instrument a carillon is meant to be. Among the first to play it in formal concert will be Arthur Lynds Bigelow, famed carillon designer, and Staf Nees, the world's foremost living bellmaster. The dedication concert Sunday, April 1 12, will be given by designer Bigelow himself, bellmaster and member of the engineering faculty at Princeton Uni- I versity, who recently completed Sewa- inee's keyboard installation. (In an im- i promptu concert, to everyone's delight, i the first tune to ring from the bells was \"Dixie.\") During Commencement Week on I Thursday, June 4, Staf Nees of Mech - lin, Belgium, world's outstanding con- temporary bellmaster, will appear in concert during his special U. S. tour that is being partially subsidized by the ! Belgian government. Nees is carillonneur at St. Rombaut's I Cathedral and director of the famous carillon school in Mechlin, carillon ! center for several centuries. He is suc- ! cessor to Jef Denyn, considered the most famous carillonneur of all time. Sewanee's $65,000 set of bells, con- sidered by designer Bigelow to be one of the finest in the world, is the gift of alumnus and Regent W. Dudley Gale '• of Nashville, as a memorial to his great j grandfather, Bishop Leonidas Polk of j Louisiana, a principal University ! founder. Several years ago he and Bigelow j made their acquaintance when the lat- ter helped install the carillon at Christ I Church, Nashville. Interested in bells since his New I England childhood, Bigelow, during ' what was to be a year of study and travel in Europe, found himself attend - j ing the Carillon School in Mechlin and staying in Belgium for a number of 1 years as bellmaster of the town of Lou- j vain, an appointment he still holds.* He i has designed carillons for the Taft Me- morial in Washington, the Washington j Memorial at Valley Forge, and for sev- eral schools and churches in the coun- try. Foundry for the Sewanee bells was Les Fils de Georges Paccard in High Savoie, near the French-Italian border I February, Nineteen Fifty-Nine at Annecy, France. It was there Bige- low spent several weeks during the summer of 1957 testing the bells with tuning forks. The foundry was too small to set up the carillon for play- ing, so the bells were moved by raft to the Isle of Swans on a nearby lake. Here, with the Alps in the background, the lake dotted with small boats, and with people gathered on the mainland coast, Bigelow gave \"testing\" concerts all during August. This gives real meaning to the inscription on one of the bells — \"From the Mountains of Sa- voie to the Mountains of Tennessee, I sing Sol.\" It is the test recording made in France that provides some of the musical background for the new Se- wanee movie. The largest bell, the bourdon, weighs nearly four tons and the smallest weighs less than a pound. The bourdon's in- scription reads: \"To Polk and to Se- wanee, my Alma Mater, this carillon is dedicated.\" An electric motor elimi- nates bell-pulling by rope, and the mo- tor swings the bourdon. This massive bell will also strike the hour for Bres- lin Tower's clock. Clock enthusiast and craftsman Frederick R. Whitesell, who is also professor of German, will super- vise this operation. The bells are made of bronze, the larger ones being seventy-eight per- cent copper and twenty-two percent tin. To give the small, high bells more \"ring,\" a greater percentage of tin was used. The keys on the double-row key- board resemble broom handles. The bot- tom row corresponds to the white keys of the piano, the top to the black keys. The four-story belfry begins with the bourdon on the bottom, then the seven other bass bells, then the keyboard, and on top the medium and high bells. At the keyboard the bellmaster is in the midst of his bells, a location of prime importance, according to Bigelow. Con- nections between keys and appropriate bells must be kept within twelve to fifteen feet \"for the sake of controlla- bility,\" he explains. Practicing can be done in private. The practice keyboard in the Music Studio is connected to small steel bars, with each bar carefully tuned to its corresponding bell. \"No one will ever know how much the bells will be appreciated until tra- ditional University life goes on century after century,\" Bigelow points out, with \"percussion's most beautiful voice\" ringing out over the countryside. Be- ginning with the class of 1963, every future alumnus will remember Sewa- nee when he hears a carillon. Rhodes Scholars- Two for Sewanee Canfill Dunlap Sewanee made another record, this time scholastically, before the year 1958 closed. For the first time in its his- tory— and a noteworthy way to begin its second century — it had two Rhodes Scholars named in the same year. The thirty-two winners throughout the nation were from nineteen col- leges and universities. Leading win- ners were the U. S. Military Academy and Harvard University with five, and Princeton with three. Joining Sewa- nee with two were Amherst (Massa- chusetts) College and Occidental Col- lege, Los Angeles. Other Southern schools with one Rhodes Scholar each were Hampden- Sydney (Virginia) and Tulane Univer- sity. Sewanee's winners, who will have two years of study at Oxford Univer- sity and who bring the grand total of the University's Rhodes Scholars to fourteen, are: J. Daryl Canfill of Me- tairie, Louisiana, and B. Bernard Dun- lap, Jr., of Columbia, South Carolina. Canfill was a Gulf District winner and Dunlap an Atlanta District winner. Both are Baker Scholars, members of Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kap- pa and Blue Key, dormitory proctors, and English majors. Canfill is presi- dent of the Pan-Hellenic Council, a past officer of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, and business manager of the Sewanee Purple. Dunlap has been president of the Order of Gownsmen and of Kappa Alpha fraternity, editor of the Moun- tain Goat, and a varsity football player. Vice-Chancellor McCrady was chair- man of the Tennessee Rhodes Scholar- ship Selection Committee that met in Sewanee in December a few days prior to the district meetings. Tennessee's representative on the Atlanta District committee is Prof. Arthur B. Dugan, head of Sewanee's political science de- partment and former Rhodes Scholar from Mississippi. South Carolina's rep- resentative is 1926 graduate and Rhodes Scholar Edgar Elliott Beaty of Charles- ton. o^ewanee J\\(sws Successor to the Sewanee Alumni News The Sewanee News, issued quarterly by the Associated Alumni of The University of thk South, at Sewanee, Tennessee.

This represented a gain of nearly $5,000 over 1957 and equaled the inter- est on over $4,000,000 of endowment. The University of the South continues to be the best supported educational enterprise in the history of the Episco- pal Church in America. Tennessee again led the twenty-one owning dioceses with $25,259 — $1.14 per communicant — a slight drop from its all-time record of $26,127 ($1.22) in 1957. Again Atlanta placed second with $.90 per communicant. On the other hand South Florida took second place (as it also did last year) in total amount contributed, with $22,774. The surprise of the tabulation came from the brand-new diocese of North- west Texas (raised from the status of missionary district last fall) , which came to third place with a gift of $.82 per communicant. Other leaders in this category: Alabama and Arkansas in fourth place with $.76 each; Florida $.64; Kentucky $.63; Louisiana $.61; Georgia $.55; and South Florida $.54. Over half the dollar total came from the top five dioceses: Tennessee and South Florida (see above) ; Atlanta $14,945; Louisiana $14,628; and Alabama $12,756. A report on diocesan gifts to All Saints' Chapel will be made in the next issue. Liberal Arts and Medicine Mix Fourteen Sewanee seniors have been accepted by medical schools, accord- ing to Dr. H. Malcolm Owen, head of the University's biology department. Both because this constitutes 15 per- cent of the graduating class and be- cause Sewanee has no \"pre-med course,\" this news item is a matter of interest. In recent years it has been the fash- ion for undergraduate colleges to lure future doctors with a so-called \"pre- med\" curriculum. This included courses designed to make medical school easier. Courses were especially tailored to lay groundwork for the stiff grind of anato- my, advanced physiology, and so on. Unfortunately, these undergraduate courses were usually substituted for literature, history, philosophy, and other liberal arts ''core\" curriculum. The result was that the \"pre-med\" graduate could go to medical school and locate a muscle but he couldn't write a grammatical paragraph about it. The University of the South has con- tinued to offer majors in chemistry and biology and its graduates have contin- ued without fanfare to be admitted to the best medical schools. Now, in 1959, medical school deans are singing praises of the liberal arts man and in highly competitive admissions situations are giving him the preference over the \"pre-med.\" The latter, they point out, is likely to lead his class the first cou- ple of years, but in the long haul is outdistanced by the more broadly edu- cated graduate. When pressed even further they will confess that back- grounds of philosophy and religion are highly useful to the doctor when the life of a patient is at stake. The fourteen seniors and the schools they will enter next fall are Norman E. McSwain, Jr., and Battle S. Searcy, III, (entering Alabama); Charles M. Up- church (Bowman-Gray) ; William R. Hutchinson, IV, and James S. Mayson (Duke) ; Charles B. Romaine, Jr., and Dion Smith (Emory); Everett McCor- mick (Florida) ; Donald B. Sanders (Harvard); T. John Gribble (Stan- ford) ; Andrew G. Finlay, Jr., and Howard H. Russell, Jr., (Tulane) ; Z. Andrew Coles, Jr., (Vanderbilt) ; and Robert Adams (Tennessee). If 1 Can Do You Any Good- There are types of paper which can \".ast over a thousand years, he was say- ing. I marveled at the breadth of his knowledge on a fairly obscure subject. He showed me Japanese paper, from a large batch of samples he had collected. I had heard him play the organ with impressive mastery and I knew that on a bassoon he was a star performer in the woodwind section of the Birming- ham Symphony. This was only because they were short on bassoons. Actually he preferred the trumpet. His list of accomplishments in the fields of chemistry and metallurgy was astounding. He probably knew more about cast iron pipes and what happens to them in the ground than anyone else in the world. James Tucker MacKenzie was a great man on whom greatness sat lightly. He was not weighed down by it. His free- ranging mind was characterized equally by detailed knowledge and by broad perspective. When death came to him on November 17, 1958, the career of one of Sewanee's most loyal alumni was closed. As far back as the alumni records go, he was a faithful contributor. With- in a few days after his death came a check for $3,000 from an insurance policy with a note that this was to be applied to the organ fund in All Saints' Chapel. Typical of his attitude was a note scrawled in 1946 across a request that he undertake an especially time- consuming job for Sewanee. \"I hate to take on any more right now,\" he wrote, \"but if you really think I can do you any good, I'd feel compelled to accept.\" SAE Plan Helps Sewanee Too Under the stewardship of Harding Woodall, '17, the SAEs have launched a campaign for funds to renovate and extend their chapter house. The plans call for an outlay of some $35,000. SAE Sewanee Corporation has been organized under Tennessee law to hold the chapter's ground lease from the University and to contract for the building project. To supply the equity capital for the corporation, the alumni are being asked to contribute five dol- lars for each year out of Sewanee. Close to 100 have responded to this appeal with gifts and pledges in excess of $12,000. Another phase of the campaign is an appeal to the SAE alumni for gifts to the endowment of the University. To the extent that an alumnus makes such a gift under this solicitation — which gift the treasurer of the University credits to Fraternity Loan Endowment Fund — the University will invest a like amount in notes of SAE Sewanee Corporation. This procedure for helping the chap- ter is available to all the fraternities at Sewanee. The appeal on the part of the SAEs has resulted in gifts to the University's endowment fund of over six thousand dollars. The Sewanee News A busy Quadrangle as seen from, the new Chapel roof. On the Mountain The Land and the Air The Air Force ROTC Unit under the direction of Lt. Col. Joseph H. Powell began its voluntary flight training pro- gram for advanced cadets in late No- vember. Designed to familiarize the potential officer with aircraft and flying prior to his getting his Air Force wings, and also to screen out those unable to get them, the program offers an addi- tional five hours of ground school (all cadets get thirty hours) and thirty-six hours of actual flight training. Upon satisfactory completion of the course the student receives his private pilot's license and becomes eligible for a Cate- gory I (pilot) commission upon gradu- ation and then goes into pilot training. The program is being carried out by Air Force officers and the Norris Fly- ing Service, Chattanooga, and its Piper Tri-Pacers. Three cadets are now ready to solo. Sewanee's own Jackson-My- ers airfield provides the \"classroom.\" Mardi Gras in New Orleans once again found the University-Air Force ROTC Band and Elite Flight on hand to lead the Rex Parade.

The Sewanee Forest Service Research Center, directed by Arnold L. Mignery, now has an advisory committee of twelve conservation leaders and fores- ters. The group's first meeting was held at Sewanee Inn on November 25, and hereafter it will meet twice a year to review the existing research pro- gram and to advise regarding future needs. Sixteen studies are now under way in cooperation with the Univer- sity's forestry and biology departments, the Hiwassee Land Company, the Walk- er Lumber Company, and the TVA De- partment of Forestry Relations. ■fe % jft :fi The National Lumber Manufacturers Association has produced a booklet, \"Opportunities Unlimited,\" describing careers and study programs for the for- est products industries.

Spears. * * * The Centennial Symposia talks on Christian Civilization by leading edu- cators in the fields of the humanities and the sciences are attracting inter- national attention. The talks were printed in the summer issue of the Se- wanee Review, where they came to the attention of the U. S. Information Agen- cy. Some of the articles were re- quested by offices in New Delhi and Saigon (for Vietnamese translations), and the Agency has asked and been granted permission to republish the talks in English and translation for a number of Information Service offices outside the U. S. and Canada. A $3,300 grant from the Frederick G. Cottrell fund of the Research Corpora- tion, New York City, has been received by \"\"the chemistry department. The grant' is in support of a research pro- ject submitted by Dr. W. B. Guenther, assistant professor of chemistry who joined the Sewanee faculty in 1956. The money has been used to buy an ultra- violet and visible light spectrophotome- ter, an instrument for examining the composition and behavior pf solutipns, Dr. David B.

In addition to studying lan- guage and German culture, club meet- ings feature German foods, steins of beer, and illustrated talks about Ger- many. The campus also has Spanish and French clubs. Graduate School \"The New Testament and the Dead Sea Scrolls\" will be among courses offered at the five-week Graduate School of Theology from July 22 — Au- gust 26. The new study, that will go into the recent discoveries in the Ju- dean desert and their bearing on the study of Christian origins, will be taught by the Rev. Dr. Peter Pierson Parker, professor of New Testament Literature and Interpretation at the General Theological Seminary, New York City. The Graduate School, offering post- ordination study leading to the master of sacred theology degree, is directed by the Rev. Dr. Massey H. Shepherd, Jr., professor of liturgies at The Church Divinity School of the Pacific, Berkeley, California. Dr. Shepherd will teach a church history course on the Eastern liturgies. Other courses and teachers will be \"The Reformation in Switzerland and in France\" taught by the Rev.

The Sewanee News eatures Music Center The Sewanee Summer Music Center will hold its third season from June 21 — July 26 on the University campus. Instrumental students primarily of high school and college age will, during the five weeks, study orchestra work, en- sembles, sight reading, theory, music background, public performance, and conducting, as well as receive private and class study. Ten specialists on the faculty will teach violin, viola, cello (and bass), clarinet, flute, bassoon, French horn (and brass instruments), oboe, piano and composition. A series of weekly student and faculty concerts will again be offered. The center is directed by Julius Hegyi, now in his fourth season as con- ductor of the Chattanooga Symphony. Hegyi is also one of four Ameri- can conductors to receive the Ameri- can Symphony Orchestra League's new recognition award. The four will offici- ate at the league's first venture in re- cording compositions of young Ameri- cans. Music Center students live in Uni- versity dormitories and enjoy the re- creational facilities of the campus. For further information write to Miss Mar- tha McCrory, Sewanee Summer Music Center, 730 Cherry Street, Chattanooga, Tenn. Training School The C. S. Lewis lectures on \"Love,\" which have brought a storm of contro- versy in Episcopal radio circles, are to be presented at the Sewanee Summer Training School June 21-27. Commen- tary will be by the Rev. Eric S. Green- wood, '45, of Memphis. The tapes, recorded especially for the Episcopal Hour in England last summer, were deemed \"too mature\" for regular broadcast, but are to be made avail- able to small groups where opportunity can be provided for full and sympa- thetic discussion. Professor Lewis of Cambridge is considered one of the half dozen most articulate laymen of the Twentieth Century. A guest speaker for the training school will be new Presiding Bishop Arthur C. Lichtenberger. The SSTS, established forty-nine years ago as the official Christian edu- cation conference of the Fourth (Se- wanee) Province, is today the oldest inter-diocesan conference in the Epis- copal Church. Bishpp Albert R. Stuart, H'55, of Georgia is chairman of its board and the Rev. Milton L. Wood, '43, of Atlanta will be director for the com- ing session. The program will include workshops in Race Relations, Alcohol- ism, Christian Education, Devotional Life, and the work of the Woman's Auxiliary. The move into newly remodeled Walsh-Ellett Hall will probably be during spring vacation in March. Taken from the second-story level, this shows the cloisters that will line the Quadrangle side of the building and provide outdoor stairway entrances into second-floor classrooms. The vice-chancellor's home is in the background. Miscellany T. S. Eliot's \"Murder in the Cathe- dral\" was a Shrove Tuesday night pres- entation in the University chapel. Chaplain David B. Collins, '43, played Archbishop Thomas Becket and Mrs. Collins directed the production. The same company will perform in the Trin- ity Cathedral, Little Rock, for the American Guild of Organists on June 15, and may give performances at Com- mencement and during the Sewanee Summer Training School. * * * # For the third year a series of Sun- day afternoon concerts by the Chatta- nooga Symphony Orchestra and Sym- phony Chamber Ensemble are being given at Sewanee. Last of the three concerts will be on March 15. Orches- tra conductor is Julius Hegyi, director of the Sewanee Summer Music Center. Purple Masque dramatic organization presented William Saroyan's \"Time of Your Life\" in December. The produc- tion was directed by second-year Semi- narian Jack Bush of Childersburg, Ala- bama, pinchhitting this year for Brin- ley Rhys of the English faculty, now doing graduate work at Tulane Uni- versity. Bush will direct another play in May. Santa Claus had special help from Sewanee in December with three U. S. Navy planes taking over for Santa's reindeer. Seminary student W. Thom- as Fitzgerald of Winter Park, Florida, who is also a lieutenant in the U. S Navy Reserve with the anti-submarine VP Patrol Squadron 671 of the Naval Air Station, Atlanta, was the chief helper. The ninety-member squadron had a routine mission coming up in the Caribbean area, decided Santa Claus might be helped at the same time, and asked Tom to find a target. He picked the Rev. Raul H. Mattei, '47, a native of Puerto Rico who studied at both the College and the Seminary and who *s now serving St. Mark's Mission near the city of Ponce on the Southern part of the island in a particularly poor, mountainous area. All of Sewanee gathered and gave until some 3,000 pounds of clothing and food were ready. Sewanee Military Academy's ROTC de- partment trucked the load to Chatta- nooga, where the Navy planes picked it and Tom up. Raul met them with his station wagon at the Naval air sta- tion near San Juan and was dumb- founded at how much there was; a week later he was still hauling car- loads of gifts back to his mission four driving hours away.

Spears Completes Two- Volume Work A signal feather in Sewanee's schol- arly cap is the publication by the Ox- ford University Press of a definitive edition of the Restoration English poet Matthew Prior. One of its two editors is Dr. Monroe K. Spears, professor of English at the University of the South and editor of the Sewanee Review. The publication on February 19 of the two volumes (1,170 pages) in the familiar dark blue of the Oxford poets' series rewards many years of intense research. Forty-one works are pub- lished for the first time and sixty titles have been established as wrongly at- tributed to Prior. Monroe and Betty Spears spent some months in England during the course of this major project. They were guests of the Marquis of Bath at his estate, \"Longleat,\" in Wiltshire, examining original Prior manuscripts which had been given to the Marquis of Bath's an- cestors. Spears also worked with ma- terial in the hands of the Duke of Portland and in the British Museum. The work was helped by grants from the Carnegie Foundation, the Ameri- can Philosophical Society, the Sewanee Research Grant Committee, and the Modern Language Association. Sewanee Is Being Seen and Heard The University's audio-visual mes- sages have recently been experiencing a phenomenal progression. Most popular is the movie SEWA- NEE, 25-minute, 16 mm film in color and sound, gift of Trustee Harvey G. Booth of Atlanta and his firm, the Southern Bell Telephone Company. (See Sewanee News, November, 1958). On word-of-mouth advertising prints of the movie now available are booked through May. Continuing to satisfy is the slide show with accompanying script, kept up to date with new color pictures and con- stantly on the road to Sewanee clubs and other groups. Radio and television coverage has been much stepped up. A fifteen-min- ute telecast on our athletic program, featuring Coach Walter Bryant, origi- nated on Chattanooga's Channel 12, and football shots were also featured on several other Nashville and Chatta- nooga TV programs. On a tip-off from the father of Seminary student Bill Pickels, a radio station in Pittsburgh (WWSW) gave fifteen minutes to Se- wanee sports, and doubtless there were other widespread notices not monitored by Sewanee. Special holiday broad- casts, one on Christmas Eve, were made of the University choir and new caril- lon. Tapes of these and other Sewanee shows will be happily sent by the Pub- lic Relations Office to any radio station requesting them. Race Relations — Atlanta Comment A statement on the crisis in race re- lations was recently signed by more than 300 Atlanta clergymen, including thirty Episcopalians. The statement calls for obedience to the law, main- tenance of the public school system, an end to race hatred, continuance of com- munication between leaders of the races, preservation of free speech, and for the use of prayer and obedience to the will of God in finding the solution of pres- ent difficulties. A three-point program was urged: 1. Encouragement of free and intelligent discussion of the issues by churches and synagogues; 2. Maintenance of a sound public school plan, consistent with the law of the land, the rights of all citi- zens, and the preservation of public edu- cation, by community and state leaders: and 3. Appointment of citizens' commis- sions including leaders from the various races, to preserve community and state harmony. Alumni clergy among the signers are: Randolph R. Claiborne, H'49, bishop of Atlanta; Alfred Hardman, '46; Rai- mundo de Ovies, '00; Robert M. G. Lib- by, '58; John L. Womack, '43; Stephen W. Ackerman, '54; Edwin C. Coleman, '53; E. Dudley Colhoun, Jr., '50; Charles C. Demere, '57; Austin Ford, '53; Frank M. Ross, '51; Hugh Saussy, Jr.\", '49; H. Augustus Sheppard, Jr., '58; Wilson W. Sneed, H'57; C. Harry Tisdale, '40; James B. Vaught, '47; and Milton L. Wood, Jr., '43. The Sewanee News BASKETBALL BREAKING EVEN In spite of an inexperienced squad, Lon Varnell's Tiger cagers have been able to break even on scheduled games with seven wins and seven losses; but they also dropped two more at the In- vitational Tournament in Memphis. Only one starter returned from last season. Hugh Gelston, 5-11, of Towson, Maryland, is one of the shorter mem- bers of the Tiger team. He switched from forward to guard to fill a vacant spot on the eager starting lineup, and has looped in 109 points to date. Sparky Edgin, a 6-4 freshman from Madison, Tennessee, is leading scorer, with 194 credits to his record. He has held the top shooting spot since the opening games, and may be known as one of the better Tigers. Center Dick Dezell, 6-6, of Jackson- ville, Florida, is back after being out of school for a year and a half. His ability shows up on the statistics with 109 markers, and his rebounding abilhy has contributed to several victories. Poochie Tomlin of Madison, Tennes- see, a 6-0 guard, comes to Sewanee as a transfer student. This is a Tiger gain, for he has earned 99 points. Other valuable Tigers are Walt Wild- er, who played football with the Tiger grid squad, a galloping tailback who made a name for himself during the last perfect season. Jim Wagoner of Shepherdsville, Kentucky, is short in height but he is always there with a surprise. Larry Varnell of Sewanee is fast and aggressive and is getting bet- ter. Last year the Tigers improved after semester examinations. They ended the season with a slightly better than even record, but they had to fight up from a mid-season slump to do it. This year, there is no sign of that slump; and ex- pectations are that the final record will be better than that of 1958. The scoresheet so far, with three games and one tournament yet to go: S Opp. Nov. 29— Athens College 78 58 Dec. 2— Vanderbilt 42 71 Dec. 5— Florence State 58 65 Dec. 8 — Southwestern 69 50 Dec. 11— Chattanooga 52 44 Dec. 15— Florence State 65 63 Dec. 16-17— Tournament: Southwestern 58 62 Ouachita 54 63 Jan. 9 — Mississippi College 66 111 Jan. 10— Millsaps 72 59 Jan. 14— Howard 72 39 Jan. 17— Lambuth 40 66 Jan. 19— Chattanooga 73 91 Jan. 22— Maryville 75 63 Feb. 9 — Florida Southern 77 <V7 Swimming Team Pulls Ahead The Sewanee tankmen, coached by Ted Bitondo, were upset by The Cita- del, 35-51, as the Tigers were going after their seventeenth straight win. The meet was hard fought, and the Sewanee pool area in the Juhan Gym- nasium was filled to capacity with spec- tators. The Citadel took six of the ten events, with their swimmers making a new medley relay record of 4:21.3, but Sewanee's freestyle quartet made a pool record of 3:44.9, which softened the sting. Meeting the University of Georgia two days later, the Tigers squeaked over the top, coming out from behind on the last event to mark up a narrow 44-42 victory. The season record stands at four wins and one loss, with six meets left to go. The freestyle relay quartet has been a reliable winner, taking four wins this season. Charles Robinson of Coral Ga- bles, Florida, Pete Bailey of Cleveland, Ohio, Ken Rast of Leesburg, Florida, Tony Veal of Atlantic Beach, Florida, and Charles North of Jackson, Tennes- see, who has substituted, make up this squad. Captain Tony Veal has been the out- standing point winner, taking a total of 50V4 markers in five meets. He holds pool and school records for the 50 and 100-yard freestyle events. This season he broke his own records twice, once against Vandy and once against Clem- son. Other reliable swimmers are: Bob Kring, Brazil; Pete Bickel, Dallas; Drew Meulenberg, Atlanta; James Dean, Co- hassett, Massachusetts; Fred Brown, Houston; Sam Rogers, Jacksonville; Robert Kane, Rome, Georgia; Buddy Wimer, El Dorado, Arkansas; Jordan Clement, Fayetteville, North Carolina; and Stirling Rayburn, Coral Gables, Florida. George L. Watkins. left, former mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he now lives, president of the Class of 1907, and captain of the football team of 1906, enjoys reminiscing with David A. Shepherd, '00, center, and Frederick P. Cheape, 10, at Sewanee's Southwestern game last November that gave the Ti- gers their first undefeated football sea- son since 1899. Wrestling Coach Horace Moore and his grap • piers are building a reputation by tak- ing Emory and Birmingham-Southern. They have five more matches ahead, and will end the se-sson with the South- eastern Regional Wrestling Champion- ship bouts at Chattanooga. Baseball — Long Ago Frederick R. Lummis, '03, recently told this experience. \"When I was studying in Philadel- phia, Senator George Wharton Pepper gave a dinner for General William Crawford Gorgas (Sewanee's alumnus of yellow fever fame). Senator Pep- per, a pillar of the Episcopal Church, asked the General to teli his highest moment in his illustrious career. The General thought a few moments and then said: 'The Hardees were playing the Sewanees. The score was five to six; I was playing right field for the Hardees and we were one run ahead in the last of the ninth inning. There were three men on bases. The batter hit a long one to right center field, and I got it.' \" VARNELL'S GAME AGONIES They have giraffes! Get that ball! 1 can't look. It went in? Atlanta — Sewanee Club With Ideas and Purpose 4LUMNI, CHURCHMEN. PARENTS PARTICIPATE The Sewanee Club of Atlanta was worth $1,000 to Sewanee as of midnight December 31, 1958. In dollars and cents that in itself is good news, but in people and interest good news has been Atlanta's story ever since the club re- organized in October 1954. The $1,000 means Atlanta exceeded its bonus offer quota of 180 gifts during 1958. The long-standing good news is more significant. More than any other club Atlanta has shown that non-alumni Episcopalians can be among Sewanee's hardest workers, and in this the city has a triumvirate hard to beat. The names are familiar to many of Sewa- nee's friends, but the men — Hinton F. Longino, former regent and Church Support chairman, James S. Bonner, former trustee, and Harvey G. Booth, current trustee and donor, along with the Southern Bell Telephone Company, of the new Sewanee movie — only a few short years ago knew little or nothing about the University. But when they learned, they believed, and they have been acting on those beliefs ever since. There are others of course, including hard-working alumni (among them, before his move to Kansas City, E. Rag- land Dobbins, alumni vice-president in charge of regions, and past Atlanta president and now treasurer T. G. Lin- thicum), but what's important is that they all work together, and the club and Sewanee thrive on the partnership. This makes food for thought because Atlanta has never shared the feeling of many clubs that \"alumni only\" should prevail until \"organization\" sets in. At- lanta presidents have been University alumni, a Sewanee Military Academy alumnus, and now a non-alumnus Epis- copalian— and other officers have been and are parents of students, husbands and wives, some just interested church people. What are the secrets? Hard-working members, of course, but another might be Atlanta's business-like approach, making the organization a dignified and official \"club\" with substance and pur- pose. There are membership applications, membership cards (billfold size, num- bered in red and issued annually), regular dues, club stationery. Objec- tives: to acquaint everyone with the University; to sponsor at least two club meetings a year — a Founders' Day Din- ner in October and a Christmas holi- day party for students, prospective students, and their dates; and to start one or more scholarships for young men in the Diocese of Atlanta. (Hon- orary alumnus Wilson Sneed's St. Luke's Church has given $2,000 for a four-year College scholarship to a de- serving— as decided by Sewanee and the parish — student from the diocese. The same church, one of Atlanta's largest and that of many club members, con- tinually gives Sewanee $1 per com- municant per year.) New trustees and alumni residents in Atlanta (found through the churches, personal acquaintances, Sewanee) re- ceive letters of welcome from club offi- cers. Annual club dues, that include the wife if the husband joins or the hus- band if the wife joins, are $1.00 for students, $2.50 for members out of col- lege less than ten years, and $5.00 for those out of college longer than that. The money is used for processing and mailing letters and invitations (hand- somely printed on white cards) and to pay for the Christmas party to which all are invited free of charge. Last De- cember's party, featuring local musical talent, was held at the Piedmont Driv- ing Club and attended by over 250 (the first such party in 1954 attracted 75). Club members receive lists of officers with resident and business addresses and both phone numbers. Meetings are announced in Sunday church bul- letins and in city newspapers. Officers, nominated by a three-member commit- tee and elected annually at a Novem- ber Sunday afternoon meeting that in- cludes \"fun, fellowship and refresh- Club Trophy The Dobbins Trophy for the year's outstanding Sewanee Club will again be awarded during Commencement in June. Clubs will b& asked to send in progress reports in the spring. The silver trophy — something use- ful for club meetings — is awarded annually by E. Ragland Dobbins, '35, Sewanee's alumni vice-president for regions. The first award in 1957 was won by the Sewanee Club of Atlan- ta, and the 1958 award went to the Coastal Carolina Alumni Chapter and the Sewanee Club of Charleston. New Sewanee trustee from the Diocese oj Atlanta, Thomas G. Linthicum, '23, discusses his new office with former trustee James S. Bonner, H'58. Bonner and Linthicum are president and treas- urer, respectively, of the Sewanee Club of Atlanta. ments\" at one of the churches, include a twelve-member board of directors, an apprentice springboard for future leaders. The current slate, elected last No- vember: James S. Bonner, president (last June made an honorary alumnus and cited for his example to all alumni \"of a devoted Episcopal layman accept- ing leadership in the service of the Church's educational center in the South.\"); Dudley C. Fort, '34, first vice- president; the Rev. E. Dudley Colhoun, '50, second vice-president; J. H. Nichols, '51, secretary; and T. G. Linthicum, '23, treasurer. For the $1,000 bonus campaign Bon- ner had his group well organized. An officers' meeting was called, campaign letters were distributed, and each offi- cer was asked to sign and address them to eight or ten prospective donors. This was followed up by telephone calls and personal visits. Atlantans made their checks payable to the Sewanee Club of Atlanta and sent them to club treasurer Linthicum, who forwarded a covering check with a list of donors' names, ad- dresses and gifts to Sewanee. Thus the club steadily watched its progress. To Founders' Day dinners Hinton Longino urges attendance from Episco- pal friends with letters like this: \"The reason I thought of you in this con- nection is your demonstrated interest in the University of the South through periodic gifts over quite a period of time. This is not a money-raising en- deavor, but an attempt to bring peopie together who are interested in (Sewa- nee) and keep them acquainted with what is happening 'on the Mountain.' \" Is it all worth it? After one such dinner attended by 110 at $5 per plate, Longino, who had worked especially hard, asked himself that question. His answer: \"After seeing the success of this dinner and the large crowd which turned out, I am sold on the idea that intense effort should be put forth in every possible place to promote Sewa- nee Clubs and let everyone -possible know about the University of the South.\" He still feels that way and so does Sewanee. And after all, SEWANEE'S RIGHT! 10 The Sewanee News About Sewanee Alumni 1885 Richard Rutherford Randolph, 93, died December 19, 1958, in Birmingham, Alabama, where he had lived since 1880 and had been active in early real estate development as president of Kingland Improvement Company. He was the oldest living alumnus of Sewanee Mili- tary Academy, from which his grand- son, Richard R. Randolph, III, was graduated in 1957. For many years he was a vestryman at St. Mary's-on-the- Highlands Church. Survivors include his wife, four daughters, and two sons. 1898 Dr. John Bigelow Cummins, Sewa- nee's oldest living alumnus and the oldest practicing physician in the United States, died December 31, 1958, in Fort Worth, Texas, where fifty-five of his sixty-two years of medical practice had been spent. Last November 7 he cele- brated his 100th birthday. A few days before his death Dr. Cummins had fractured a hip and ribs in a fall, but until then he kept regular office hours and made house calls day or night. He worked his way through college, earned medical degrees from both Sewanee and the University of Nashville, and began his practice in 1897 in Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. Dr. Cummins was a member of the Tarrant County Medi- cal Society, the Texas Medical Society (that named him its \"General Practi- tioner of the Year\" in 1950), and of the American Medical Society. He was an organizer, charter member and life elder of Magnolia Avenue Christian Church. 1899 Berkeley St. John Green, KS, now 82 years old, is chaplain to Spanish-Ameri- can War veterans at California's Vet- erans Home. In 1896 he left Sewanee after one year to join the Army, in which he served as a hospital steward in Cuba and the Philippines. He is a fifty-year member of Sewanee's Omega chapter of Kappa Sigma. His grand- father, the Rt. Rev. William Mercer Green, was the first Episcopal bishop of Mississippi and Sewanee's fourth chancellor (1866-87). Address: Adm. McCalla Camp 17, P. O. Box 614, Vet- erans Home, Calif. 1900 John McW. Ford, SAE, of Shreve- port, Louisiana, had a day celebrated in nis honor last November 9. He has been the city's commissioner of finance since 1930 and in fifty years has also served as alderman, police juror, state legislator, and mayor. He has run for political office twelve times and has never been defeated. His favorite mot- to when the going gets rough is, \"Well, we've just got to keep on keeping on.\" Today he manages a sound municipal structure worth more than $8,000,000, and much of Shreveport's improvement, growth, and destiny found influence and guidance from him. Lucien Memminger. 79, ATO, who served with the U. S. Consular Service for thirty-seven years before his re- tirement in 1944, died November 20, 1958, in an AsheviLe, North Carolina, hospital after a prolonged illness. His foreign service included thirteen con- The University Cross, erected in 1922 as a memorial to Sewanee men who served in World War I, now has a special bronze plaque identifying its engineer, Ralph; P.

His posts included investigating the Congo Free State of Africa, now the Belgian Congo, being in charge of Consulates General at Beirut, Syria, and Smyrna, Turkey, during the period (1910-13) leading to the Italian-Turkish War, then Consul at Rouen, France, where he assisted in evacuation of Americans stranded in Paris at the start of World War I, and then from 1920-23' in Italy during the rise to power of the Fascist Party. He was Consul General in Copenhagen during occupation by German forces and until such officials were evacuated by the U. S. government. From 1941- 44 he was First Secretary of the Le- gation at Pretoria, South Africa, and later Consul General at Paramaribo Surinem. In Asheville he participated in Episcopal Church and civic affairs during his more active years. Survi- vors include a daughter and a son. 1901 William Blackburn Wilson, Sr., 80, prominent Rock Hill, South Carolina, attorney, died December 8, 1958, after a year of declining health. Since 1901 he had been associated with Wilson and Wi.son, law firm founded by his grand- father, retiring two years ago. He was Rock Hill's first city recorder, an office he held thirty-five years. From 1909- 13 he was a member of the state's House of Representatives and for thirty vears served as York County's state executive committeeman in the Demo- cratic Party. In law he was known for his facts and fighting spirit. As a cor- poration lawyer he helped organize several of the community's textile plants. At Sewanee, weighing 130 pounds, he was quarterback of the un- defeated and untied football team of 1899. The famous five games in six days saw Wilson play forty-five min- utes of the last game with Mississippi with a fractured leg. Midway through the first half (no quarters then) his leg had been injured. He had no sub- stitute, so taped up his leg and con- tinued to play. Survivors include his wife, two daughters, and one son. February, Nineteen Fifty-Nine 11 1905 J. Monroe Jones, KA, retail coal company operator in Birmingham, Ala- bama, for many years, died January 18 in a Florida hospital. Survivors in- clude two sons. Dr. Robert Jackson Perry, 91, who practiced medicine in Henry County and Manleyville, Tennessee, for fifty- seven years, died November 1, 1958. 1907 Dr. Lawson A. Hankins in January 1958 completed fifty years of medical practice, the past forty of them in Bay- town, Texas, where twenty-six years ago he and two other doctors estab- lished the city's first hospital. He still heads the forty-two-bed hospital, staffed now by four doctors. Other activities include being a deacon in the Memorial Baptist Church, a Shriner, and a mem- ber of the Chamber of Commerce and the Lions Club. Arthur M. Michael of San Antonio, Texas, now chairman of the board of the Travis Savings and Loan Associa- tion, which he organized in 1927, has much to keep him busy. He is presi- dent emeritus of the city's Boy Scout Council, with which he has been active for forty years, is a member of the Board of Governors of St. Mary's Uni- versity, of the executive committee of the Taxpayers League, and is vice- chairman of a committee advising the city about the purchase of a right-of- way on which a new speed way will be built. Good fortune has smiled on him. On some land he owns seventy- five miles southwest of San Antonio, and never sold because it was a good hunting ground, there are now sixteen oil wells. Another tract of 640 acres is under lease to Cities Service. The Rev. Alexander C. D. Noe, SAE. retired for six years and now 78, is still well and active in Bath, North Carolina, helping the other ministers with their programs, and giving much time to writing and restoration work. \"Bath is North Carolina's oldest town, ' he writes, \"with its oldest church, St. Thomas, of which I was rector for sev- enteen years, and we are now restoring the Church and the town, and I am president of Colonial Bath, Inc., which is sponsoring the program, similar to the work being done in Williamsburg, Virginia.\" Youngest son, William S. Noe, '54, is now studying at Sewanee's seminary. 1909 Reginald Irving Raymond died No- vember 25, 1958. He was associate pro- fessor of biology at Sewanee from 1908- 16 and more recently had been an ac- countant with the U. S. Department of Agriculture in New Orleans. Survivors include his widow and a daughter. 1910 Dr. Marion Franklin Dickinson, 79, a physician who also delved success- fully in politics, farming, journalism, banking, and education, died May 18, 1958, at his home in Little Rock, Ar- kansas. His early manhood he spent as a farmer and school' teacher and directed teacher training institutes at various places in Arkansas. In 1904 he helped organize the first local of the Edwin I. Hatch, '33, ATO, brought home about $4,700 in \"loot,\" including a Ram- bler sedan, a trip for two to the Ba- hamas, a gold coffee maker, and dining room furniture, from his holiday vaca- tion in New York. For three days he appeared on TV's \"The Price is Right\" daytime show, having been picked from, the studio audience, and was cheered on by Mrs. Hatch and daughter Caro- lyn. Hatch is executive vice-president of the Alabama Power Company, Bir- mingham. Farmers Union in the state and later moved up to county president and state secretary. He resigned to start prac- ticing medicine in 1909, but three years later Farmers Union members per- suaded him to run for the legislature and he was elected. He managed Ar- kansas Governor Hays' campaign and filled an unexpired term as state audi- tor. He continued with medical studies but kept a finger in politics, managing campaigns for the U. S. Senate and the state. After banking positions in the early 1920s he entered the real estate and insurance business in St. Louis and was caught by the depression. He re- turned to Arkansas and the Farm Credit Administration and in 1933 was elected president of the Arkansas Farmers Union. He later was an or- ganizer for the National Farmers Union in Eastern and Southern states. In 1943 he became editor of the Union Farmer, magazine of the Arkansas Farmers Union. Survivors include his wife and a daughter. 1911 Dr. James T. Mackenzie, 67, DTD, nationally recognized authority in met- allurgy, died unexpectedly in Birming- ham November 17, 1958. Before his retirement in 1956 he was technical di- rector of the American Cast Iron Pipe Company, with which he began work- ing in 1912. Since 1956 he had been a consultant for the Southern Research Institute. During his career Dr. Mac- Kenzie was honored by many profes- sional and technical groups. In 1951 he received the Herty Medal from the Georgia Section of the American Chemi- cal Society for outstanding contribu- tions to chemistry in the Southeast, and in 1938 he was awarded the John H. Whiting Gold Medal of the Ameri- can Foundrymen's Association and was made an honorary life member of the group. He received the Patriotic and Civilian Service Award from the U. S. Army in 1952. He was a vestryman of St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands Church in Birmingham and from 1947-49 had been a Sewanee regent and alumnus trustee. Sewanee awarded him the honorary doctor of science degree in 1930 and he held another awarded by the University of Alabama in 1948. Sur- vivors include his wife, one son, James T. MacKenzie, Jr., '37, SAE, and a daughter. 1922 Winfield S. Crownover of Miami, Florida, has died, the Alumni Office recently learned.

Westfeldt, who plans to headquarter in Stockholm, will study the strategic importance of small nations in the cur- rent international situation. \"The inter- esting thing to me,\" he states, \" is that these nations are weak militarily, but exert a strong influence on world af- fairs through moral sanctions. Their influence is felt particularly before world crises, when both the United States and Russia compete for the ap- proval of their actions by the small neutral nations. If you look at the map of Europe, you see that their good will is important to us from a military point of view, too, because if Communism came into Scandinavia, it would out- flank the line of the NATO nations.\" Since April 1953 Westfeldt has been a member of the Nashville Tennessean staff and he has also been a corres- pondent for the Southern Education Reporting Service.

Richard E. Gathings, '49, with the United Geophysical Company, S.A., in Tripoli. Libya, North Africa, read about it \"in the Rome paper.\" 1958 Sewanee \"Classwork Officers Use Originality, Perseverence This story, in case you fail to read between the lines, is not about money, although \"contributors\" and \"$1,000 winners\" persistently crop up. Its source is full of statistics — plain num- bers, fancy percents, charts — but that still isn't the heart of the story, for the cold statistics come from warmth. Th>i story is really about people — people called alumni in a \"class society,\" for whom Sewanee is Alma Mater, and who last year, however overused the term has become, practiced \"together- ness.\" The end of 1953 and the beginning of Sewanee's second century found class officers taking their jobs more seriously than ever before and doing their \"classwork\" well. It might be said the class officers were \"worth their weight in gold\" be- cause of the challenge put to them by an anonymous benefactor willing to give $1,000 for each class that had half or more of its living members sending a gift of any size to Sewanee in 1958. Twenty-two classes out of the sixty- four were thousand-dollar winners (see back cover)! And many classes that didn't make the grade did show marked improvement in their gift rec- ords. The grand total of alumni con- tributors— the highest ever — was 1,830, an increase of 816 over 1957! Only seven classes failed to improve on their 1957 contributors' record, and twenty-three classes, twelve of them among the high scorers, doubled, trip- led, and more in pulling in 1958 donors over the 1957 count. The record picture is good almost any way you look at it. Taken in groups each decade of classes had more than 25% of its potential living alumni con- tributing. The old timers from 1894- 1899 had 59.4% of its collective 69 alum- ni giving. The 1900-1909 group had 47.9% out of 349; 1910-1919 had 39.7% out of 330; 1920-1929 had 41.6% out of 826 (an increase of 224 contributors over 1957); 1930-1939 had 40.27c out of 879 (an increase of 184 over 1957); 1940-1949 had 27.8% out of 1,020; and 1950-1958 had 26.3% out of 1,860 (an increase of 192 over 1957). Many class officers took the time to write each class member personally, or, on the bottom of printed or mimeo- graphed letters, penned personal notes. Among these were 1906 president Col. William G. deRosset, 1912 leader E. L. Scruggs, and Col. Henry T. Bull, '01, | who took over the leadership of the class of 1900 this year as well and sent handwritten letters to all members. On postcards 1918 president Malcolm Fooshee said, \"The amount is not im- portant— You Are!\", and the Rev. John N. Atkins, '02, in an \"Extra!\" declared, \"NOW IS THE TIME for all good men to come to the aid of ALMA MATER. NOW IS THE TIME to show SEWA- NEE SPIRIT.\" The Rev. William S. Stoney, '20, sent Christmas cards handmade with post- card pictures of the completed All- Saints' Chapel. Coleman Harwell, '26, set up a special class committee (Hodge Alves, Hollis Fitch, Dan Hamilton, P. P. Hebert, Michaux Nash) which helped; write letters. Ralph Speer, secretary of> 1927, sent out over sixty night letters' urging contributions before the Decem- ber 31 deadline. The '29ers heard from j all three of their officers — President William C. Schoolfield, Secretary Stan- yarne Burrows, and a long newsy letter from Editor Frederick F. Freyer. Also! helping was William Cravens. Joe Earnest, '28, to each member senti names and addresses of five others fon the recipient to write. \"In this way,\" Earnest figured, \"each member of the class will get a number of cards urging him to make his contribution. He might; disregard my letter, but when he gets reminders from five other members ofi! his class, then he may do something; about it.\" 1928 didn't make 50%, but;1 it more than tripled the number of its* 1957 contributors. R. Morey Hart, '3'4, sent marked class lists to appointed helpers asking them to call class members in their areas, and he himself sent letters to most of the class. J. F. Cravens, class secre- tary, sent personal (each one different) John D. \"Red\" Bridgers, Sewanee's football line and track coach from 1947- 53, with an interruption for military service, and most recently defensive line coach of the National professional Champion Baltimore Colts, has been named head football coach and athletic director at Baylor University, Waco, Texas.

G. wdoin Craighill, Jr., '36, added on ; card: \"As a minor additional in- ltive, I am giving Sewanee $1.00 for ;ry classmate who joins this effort.\" 7. Hutcheson Sullivan, '44, began op- itions early in November and wrote rsonal and mimeographed letters urg- 5 gifts toward an annual class schol- ;hip — \"If thirty members would give > each year, this would give as ough for a full scholarship.\" tVith his letter and revised class list, Uiam Nelson, '45, added a request it each class member write the man low him on the list reminding him meet the December 31 deadline. \\mong the big classes — those since Drld War II that have swelled to al- >st and sometimes over 200 — con- rted efforts brought definite results en though there were no $1,000 win- rs. Bertram Wyatt-Brown, '53, while idying at Johns Hopkins, found time write personal postcards, sent out a ter in October with a fill-in news -m enclosed, then went through the turned forms and compiled a witty ir-page newsletter. Helping him .>re the Rev. Duncan M. Gray with 3 '53 seminary group, and the Rev. hn C. Fletcher, class secretary, rhe Rev. Allen Bartlett, president of 51, and George B. Elliott, secretary, imed up after their class, sending out total of five class letters. For the ass of 1952, Secretary B. Ivey Jackson rried the ball with a series of color- . cartoon-illustrated letters. Secre- •y Frank C. Bozeman did the ball- crying for the Class of 1955. 1954 ssident John W. Woods sent out a inted postcard in November and will following it with a letter giving ws gleaned from the replies. For 50, Richard B. Doss sent a newsletter out Sewanee, enclosed a class list, d asked, \"Why not call your neigh- ring classmates and remind them that i percentage is the thing?\" rhese are just some of the hard- irking officers. rhe year 1959 has a fine record to itch and break, but with \"classwork\" adily improving, it gives promise of better-than-passing grade. \\bbott C.
