        "text": "2.3. Sites Particularly Rich in Bryophyte Species\n\nThe areas with the highest species diversity were in the Viennese part of the Donau-Auen National Park, at the Donauinsel, and in the Wienerwald. However, inner-city areas also had considerable species numbers.\n\nThe so-called Heißländen of the Lobau ( A) deserve special mention: these gravel areas filled up by exceptional floods of the Danube correspond to edaphic dry grasslands. They are all located in the upper Lobau and harbor numerous bryophyte species that have become rare in Austria. In six of those Heißländen investigated, 98 species were found, including the rarities Cephaloziella stellulifera, Entosthodon fascicularis, Mesoptychia turbinata, Microbryum floerkeanum, Microbryum starckeanum, and Aloina ambigua.\n\nOxbow lakes in the Lobau and Prater ( B) are also species-rich sites: although the remnants of the formerly free-flowing Danube no longer have dynamic sections, these almost stagnant waters and their muddy banks, which are often overgrown with reeds, still harbor rare species, including Amblystegium humile, Archidium alternifolium, Campylium polygamum, Fontinalis hypnoides, Riccia warnstorfii, or Ricciocarpos natans.\n\nAlso, the loamy soils in the floodplain of the Donauinsel ( C) are a habitat for bryophytes. During extreme water levels of the Danube, opening the locks to the New Danube is a flood protection measure. A result of these floodings are deposits of loamy sands on the Donauinsel. These are colonized by pioneers of moist soils (e.g., Physcomitrium patens) soon after the water recedes. Subsequently, these soils dry out until the next flood, which often occurs years later. There, a dry grassland flora develops with sometimes rare elements, such as Pterygoneurum lamellatum, Aloina brevirostris, and A. ambigua. Over a length of 21.1 km, the Donauinsel offers a large number of these sites, which are rare throughout Austria.\n\nThe area of the Lainzer Tiergarten also offers important habitats, such as deciduous woodlands, litter meadows, wet meadows, meager dry meadows, spring horizons, and streams. Notable is the virgin forest remnant Johannserkogel ( D), hosting considerable deadwood volumes. Also, the Kaltbründlwiese crisscrossed by (coldwater) streams is rich in bryophytes. Overall, we found more than 100 species in the Lainzer Tiergarten—a high number for an area dominated by beech forests.\n\nThe variety concerning pH value in the Wienerwald allows the settlement of diverse soil and rock colonizers among bryophytes. Soil reactions in the Flyschwienerwald vary and range from slightly alkaline (e.g., Hermannskogel or Schutzengelberg area) to comparatively strongly acidic (e.g., in the Steinerne Lahn area) [25]. The streams in the Flyschwienerwald enable the occurrence of species, such as Seligeria pusilla and Blindiadelphus recurvatus, which are rare in the other parts of the Wienerwald. The part of the Wienerwald dominated by carbonate is small and lies southwest of Vienna. One of the rarest finds there was the occurrence of Asterella saccata.\n\nAlso, cemeteries and parks are habitats for bryophytes in the city. Of Vienna’s 55 cemeteries, the Zentralfriedhof ( E) is particularly significant concerning bryophyte diversity. Its Jewish part is especially species-rich (70 species) since it is highly diverse concerning structures. Except for the Botanical Garden, generalist species dominate the city’s parks, most of which are highly stressed by air pollutants due to traffic. But the parks in the west of Vienna often merge smoothly into the Wienerwald and are correspondingly richer in species.\n\nEven the inner city and rooftops are bryophyte habitats ( F). The inner city of Vienna was studied by Hohenwallner [20,26], and the occurrence of bryophytes on the flat roofs of buildings from the turn of the last century was studied by Zechmeister [27]. More recent investigations on the Vienna General Hospital (Allgemeines Krankenhaus der Stadt Wien) brought further finds [28], such as that of Rhynchostegium megapolitanum. In general, the vegetation of the roof surfaces corresponded in part to that of primary dry grasslands. In total, around 100 bryophyte species were found in the densely built-up area of Vienna. The high species number shows that numerous bryophyte species conquer the inhospitable city without human intervention. They only need the necessary time and adequate structures.\n\n3.2. Implications for Management and Conservation\n\nForty-nine species historically known for Vienna were not found in the current surveys. Their loss might have several causes. At the time of the early bryologists, many sites were in villages and communities dominated by agriculture, which were incorporated into the city in the last hundred years (e.g., Roßau, Sievering, Stammersdorf, Floridsdorf). The disappearance of arable bryophytes such as Anthoceros agrestis or Phaeoceros carolinianus is probably due to this. Of course, urban sprawl is also partly to blame for the loss of some species. Wet meadows and fens have disappeared around Vienna. However, a significant impact on species number had the regulation of the Danube and the Wienfluss. On the banks of the unobstructed, markedly branched Danube and its “islands” ( ) were diverse habitats, such as loamy, sandy, or gravelly floodplains. It is thus not surprising that species typical for the banks of large rivers have disappeared with these, such as 4 out of 5 Ephemerum species, Bryum versicolor, Physcomitrium eurystomum, or P. sphaericum.\n\nAlso, climate changes over the last 150 years reflect the loss of species that prefer higher humidity or cooler temperatures [44,45,46]. In Vienna, these include Porella arboris-vitae, Ptilium crista-castrensis, or the deadwood colonizer Blepharostoma trichophyllum. For other species, such as Orthotrichum scanicum or Neckera pennata, the influence of climate change is probably closely linked to that of air pollution [47,48,49].\n\nThe species lost in Vienna have also become rare in the surrounding area. Of the 49 species that no longer occur in Vienna, 37 are classified as endangered in the Red List of Bryophytes of Lower Austria, 7 as extinct, and 12 as threatened with extinction (e.g., Asterella saccata, D). Due to the site characteristics and size of the Donauinsel, the dry grasslands of the Lobau, and the habitats along streams in the Flyschwienerwald, some species are more frequent in Vienna than in neighboring Lower Austria concerning the area and marked with a “!” in (Appendix A). These are Acaulon triquetrum ( A), Aloina rigida, Cephaloziella stellulifera, Dicranella howei, Entosthodon fascicularis ( E), Microbryum curvicollum ( F), Physcomitrium patens ( C), Pterygoneurum lamellatum, Ricciocarpos natans ( B), Seligeria pusilla, Blindiadelphus recurvatus, and Mesoptychia turbinata. Vienna, therefore, is highly responsible for the conservation of these.\n\nCampylopus introflexus, as the only neophytic bryophyte species in Vienna, occurred only regionally and in small populations.\n\nA contribution to the protection of bryophytes is raising awareness that they are a significant part of the biodiversity of a large city and that the best way to protect them is to let them live where they emerge and grow on their own. A garden wall or roof surface overgrown with bryophytes is beautiful and increases biodiversity—not only of the bryophytes but also of microorganisms living in their protection—because each bryophyte cushion is a small microcosm [50]. Attempts to establish bryophytes outside their natural habitat are doomed to failure in Vienna for climatic reasons [51]. Attempting bryophytes for greening purposes on house walls and indoors should therefore be strictly rejected. Unfortunately, against better knowledge, the use of bryophytes in this area is in vogue. This use is associated with the destruction of bryophyte stands and the creatures hidden in them.\n\nAs the present data indicate, urban biodiversity is becoming increasingly important. Vienna’s diversity in bryophytes exceeds the species numbers of many cultural landscapes in rural areas [52,53]. Within cities, bryophytes are also indicators of a feel-good climate for people. The high number of boreo-temperate species in Vienna represents a cool–moderate climate that is also digestible for humans [54]. Bryophyte-free areas indicate areas within Vienna dominated by concrete and increasingly inhospitable for humans in the increasing heat and dry summer periods. Bryophyte-rich areas within the city can thus serve as guidelines for future urban planning [55]. In future studies, new bryophyte species will appear in Vienna. We have only recorded bryophytes from publicly accessible areas; further species might occur in old, structurally rich gardens in the suburbs and villa districts, which proved to be rich in species in other studies, e.g., [56]."
