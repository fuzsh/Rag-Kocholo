        "text": "igeria has witnessed a deteriorating internal security situation since the return to democratic rule in 1999. This may be seen from the proliferation and involvement of non-state actors in security across the different sections of the country. There are various forms of non-state actors (apart from private security outfits) in different parts of the country ranging from Bakassi Boys in the south-east, Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND) in south-south to Boko Haram, Sara Suka and Yankalare in the north-east. The military being present in more than thirty-two states of the nation to restore order appears to be virtually overstretched. Many reasons have been advanced to explain the continued deterioration of security in Nigeria. The main causes of insecurity in the country are twofold - remote and proximate causes. These may include: • absence of institutional capacity resulting in government failure; • the gaping chasm of inequality and absence of fairness and justice; • ethno-Religious conflicts; • disconnect between the people and the Government. These and many proximate factors like, porous borders, rural-urban drift, poverty, and unemployment have combined to further aggravate the problem of insecurity in Nigeria. Nigeria has experienced both military and civilian rule at different times of her national development, each with its unique xiii style of maintaining national security. It is generally believed that the management of security under civil rule is also tinted with elements of repression characteristic of military regimes in Nigeria, so that the distinction between the two is very tenuous. Whichever style of government used there is always a correlation between governance and the nature of security. For an effective security system to be fully operational, the leadership must exhibit elements of good governance. Ideally, good governance is the hall mark of credible leadership epitomized in today’s world by democracy. However, while democracy is often associated with good governance, the situation in Nigeria appears to be the reverse. Nigeria’s democratic experiment is characterised by conflicts, political assassinations, unemployment among other challenges. Studies were conducted in the six states that make up the North-Eastern region – Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe – to find out the nexus between governance and insecurity in these states. The research was carried out using a combination of primary and secondary sources of data. The primary data were sourced by administering questionnaires using the purposive sampling system, conducting of focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The secondary data were gotten from the existing literature which includes but not limited to journals, government policy documents, newspapers, academic publications, CLEEN Foundation’s National Crime and Safety Survey reports, social statistics compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics and National Population Commission. Objectives The objectives of the study are as follows: • To examine the relationship between security and character of governance in the North-East region. • To understand major drivers of insecurity in the states. • To identify the gaps in governance and security in the states. xiv • To determine the role of NGOs and civil society organisations in improving governance and security in the states. • To explore the various mechanisms employed by the government at state and local levels with a view to enhancing security and governance. • To recommend remedial measures with a view to strengthening security and good governance. • To assess Government’s response to insecurity challenges in the states. Limitations/Challenges The limitations encountered in the course of carrying out the study were as follows: • Reluctance on the part of identified respondents particularly the civil servants. There seems to be a lack of interest on their part on the subject matter of the study. • There was reluctance on the part of women to be part of the interviews; there was a high sense of mistrust and unwillingness to respond to questions posed to them. • Insecurity challenges in the field also affected the time frame within which the study was conducted. Findings • Elected representatives have abused or misused their powers and authority. Nepotism, ethnicity, religion and regionalism are strong influencers of politics and governance in the region. • Corruption is endemic among government officials’ particularly political office holders. The judicial system was found to be non responsive to the plight of ordinary citizens xv in the region because it is also bedevilled with corrupt practices. • Citizens’ participation in governance is low and in some places it does not exist. Organised civil society engagement that could galvanise citizens’ engagement is also weak. Most of the groups that exist were involved in health related advocacy and mobilisation. This has created poor accountability and service delivery processes at the local government and community levels. • Accessibility of the citizens to public officials or government functionaries does not exist. Gombe State was the exception where the findings showed that 60 per cent of the respondents were of the opinion that public official and /or government functionaries were accessible to the citizens. • Security challenges in the region were high. There were incidents of theft, burglary, gang attacks and communal clashes. Some of the security challenges are traced to skewed policies by government, discriminatory processes in allocating resources and distribution of opportunities. • Security challenges were also traced to weak state institutions and lack of capacity of the institutions to respond to the security challenges. Recommendations • Promotion of positive cultural, religious and social values that would build national cohesion and development. This should be adopted across the region. • Elected representatives should be made accountable to their constituencies. Periodic report back/feedback dialogues should be carried out with their constituencies and other stakeholders. Transparency and accountability should be encouraged at all levels. • There is an urgent need to facilitate and ensure community participation in the governance process at the state and local government levels in the region. Marginalised groups such as women and youths should be encouraged to take keen interest in the governance processes in the region. • Skills acquisition programmes and other employment opportunities should be identified and scaled up to get more youths irrespective of gender and other interest. This is to curb the trend of young persons joining insurgent groups in order to secure means of livelihood. • Credible leadership should be encouraged in the region. Development of the region should be at the core of any strategy to curb the wave of insurgency in the region. • Appropriate capacity building and re-orientation for the security and law enforcement agencies working in the region particularly the police so as to build community confidence and foster partnership. • Capacities of the civil society organisations need to be strengthened to enable them function effectively in the area of holding the government accountable and to be more responsive to the citizenry. Conclusion The governance challenges in the north-east region of Nigeria seem to be a microcosm of the larger country which has been characterised by poor leadership. Although insurgency was identified as the most important cause of insecurity facing the region, there are still threats of armed robbery, and communal clashes. The perception that the security agencies are unprepared for the challenges in the region leaves more to be desired. The general dissatisfaction with the various dimensions of governance performance of electoral officials at all levels, lack of transparency and accountability, endemic corruption created opportunities that were exploited by insurgents to recruit socio-economic vulnerable persons to join their cause. This shows an indication of inter-connectivity between governance and security."
