        "text": "Some residents of the Federal Low-Cost, Government Reserved Area, Tumfure, and the State Low-Cost have lamented the arbitrary increase in the cost of house rents in Gombe State.\n\nArewa PUNCH reports that those affected are mainly visitors in the state who are on transfer from the Federal Government, Non-Government Organisations placement, as well as corps members.\n\nInvestigations conducted by Arewa PUNCH reveal that as a result of the growing trend, many of the residents have called for the establishment of rent tribunals to adjudicate some of the rent-related disputes.\n\nSalihu Adamu told our correspondent that his rent was arbitrarily increased by the landlord through his agent, making his two-bedroom apartment of N250,000 annual house rent to N600,000 without justifiable reason.\n\nAdamu said, “My rent was in the Federal low-cost, which was increased from the N250,000, which I paid last year. To my surprise, it was raised to N600,000, which forced me to leave the two-bedroom apartment, and many people currently are suffering from this unwholesome attitude from landlords and their agents.”\n\nAlso speaking on the situation, a Development Worker, Simon Collins, who resides in Tumfure, told Arewa PUNCH that the cost of rent has bitten hard on him.\n\nCollins said, “Initially, I thought it was because I’m not from here after paying the first N350,000 in 2023, but the landlord has increased the amount to N450,000 without any reason, saying it’s because of the economy.”\n\nWhile decrying the latest amount of N450,000 Collins wondered why the economy would affect an already existing structure.\n\n“How can someone be talking about N450,000 when it’s not a new building? Nothing new was done afresh to add to the aesthetics of the building, only for him to now say that the country is hard as such, he will increase the rent. This is unacceptable.\n\n“I just wish a rent tribunal could be established by the government,” he added.\n\nLike others, Sharon Haruna, a Federal Civil Servant has equally decried the arbitrary increase in house rents while calling on “responsible” government agencies to intervene and halt the unwholesome issue.\n\n“Only the government and its responsible agencies can stop this madness. By responsible, I mean the agencies who will not collude with the agents and landlords.\n\n“Before now, the state low-cost used to have low rent, but because there is an influx of more masses and visitors to the state who reside here, but, that is no longer the case. Things have changed as landlords and agents are dealing with us with rents,” Haruna added.\n\nWhen contacted, the Director-General of Gombe Geographic Information Systems, Dr Kabiru Usman, said he would investigate the allegations of unreasonable hike in the cost of apartments and office buildings as alleged by the residents, adding that he would channel the queries to the governor after due consultation.\n\nUsman said, “I have got similar several queries and complaints over this high rents matter, but I will consult with my staff to know the place of GOGIS and then table the matter before the governor. The agents should have an association, and we will invite them for serious talks,” he assured Arewa PUNCH."
