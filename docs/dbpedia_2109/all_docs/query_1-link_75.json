        "text": "Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, Director-General, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has assured Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State of a strengthened collaboration in various digital initiatives.\n\nThe assurance came during the Governor’s visit to NITDA’s Headquarters in Abuja, where both leaders engaged in discussions focusing on expanding the existing partnership between NITDA and Gombe State.\n\nThe talks primarily centered on enhancing digital literacy programmes and fortifying e-governance initiatives in the state, with the shared goal of improving administrative efficiency and elevating service delivery to the citizens.\n\nInuwa expressed NITDA’s commitment to supporting Gombe State’s ambitious agenda to automate all government operations in the state, emphasising the agency’s dedication to providing technical expertise, resources, and guidance to ensure the seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies across various sectors in the state.\n\nThis meeting gains significance as it follows Gombe State’s recent acknowledgment as the ‘Most Digitally Compliant State’ at the Digital Nigeria International Conference Dinner and Awards 2023, by NITDA.\n\nThe discussions further delved into the specific areas of capacity building, digital literacy with plans to intensify efforts in establishing the State IT Agency that will provide the youths and women of Gombe with essential digital skills through a comprehensive training programme.\n\nUnder the leadership of Governor Inuwa Yahaya, Gombe State has set an ambitious objective to automate all government operations within the next four years, aligning with the broader national agenda for a more digitally inclined governance structure.\n\nGombe State, distinguished for its skilled manpower, currently holds the prestigious title of the ‘Best State in Ease of Doing Business’ in Nigeria. The potential collaboration with NITDA is poised to further fortify this standing, facilitating the infusion of cutting-edge technology across various sectors and ensuring Gombe continues to lead the charge in the country’s digital transformation.\n\nAs both parties look forward to solidifying this collaboration, the assurance from NITDA’s Director-General signifies the Agency’s continued commitment to fostering technological advancements and promoting digital literacy, ultimately contributing to the overall development of Gombe State and setting a precedent for similar collaborations across Nigeria.\n\nBy Linda Saunders, Director Solutions Engineering Africa\n\nEvery organisation is racing to unlock the power of AI to improve its sales and service experiences. But great AI requires data.\n\nTraditionally, companies have handled data that is found in structured formats, with rows and columns, including customer engagement data gathered through CRM applications. Every business also has a huge amount of information trapped in “unstructured” data, in formats such as documents, images, audio and video recordings. This unstructured data could be highly valuable, providing businesses with AI insights that are more accurate and comprehensive because they are grounded in customer information.\n\nMany organisations want a holistic customer view, but have lacked the technical ability to see, access, integrate, and make use of their unstructured data in any trusted way. With the power of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, they can now do just that.\n\nTo win in the AI era, successful organisations will need to build integrated, federated, intelligent, and actionable solutions across every customer touchpoint while also reducing complexity.\n\nThis starts with the capability to effectively tap into unstructured content, gather knowledge, index the data efficiently, and pull insights from every department.\n\nHelping AI to better know and serve customers\n\nWhen a customer needs help with a recent purchase, typically they start the conversation with the company’s chatbot. For the experience to be both relevant and positive, the entire exchange needs to be grounded in that customer’s data, such as their recent product purchase, warranty information, and any past conversations they’ve had. The chatbot should also be tapping into company data, such as the latest learnings from other customers who have bought similar products and internal knowledge base articles.\n\nSome of this information might reside in transactional databases — structured information — while the rest might be in unstructured files, such as warranty contracts or knowledge base articles. Both types of data need to be accessed, and the right data needs to be utilised. If not, the exchange with the chatbot will be at best frustrating and at worst inaccurate.\n\nObtaining the best and most accurate AI responses requires augmenting LLMs with proprietary, real-time, structured and unstructured data from within a company’s own applications, warehouses, and data lakes.\n\nAn effective way of making those models more accurate is with an AI framework called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG typically enables companies to use their structured and unstructured proprietary data to make generative AI more contextual, timely, trusted, and relevant.\n\nEnsuring relevancy, whatever the scenario\n\nCombining all your customer data, structured and unstructured, into a combined 360-degree view will ensure customers have the most relevant information for any enterprise scenario.\n\nFinancial institutions, for example, can use it to provide real-time information on market or financial data to their employees, who can take that information and blend it with a customer’s own unique banking needs to give them actionable advice based on their situation.\n\nMany companies are exploring the use of RAG technology to improve internal processes and provide accurate and up-to-date information to advisors and other employees. Offering contextual assistance, ensuring personalised support, and continuously learning will improve efficiency decision-making across their organisation.\n\nFor organisations preparing their data for AI, first, they have to know where all of their data is and understand its quality – and whether it is good enough for their generative AI models. Second, they have to ensure their data is fresh, relevant, and retrievable, so they can combine structured and unstructured data for the best outputs. And thirdly, they have to activate that data across their applications and build the right pipelines so RAG can pull that data when prompted and provide the answers they need.\n\nMTN Nigeria has made history by becoming the first African telecommunications company to join the prestigious Project Management Institute (PMI) Global Executive Council. This achievement highlights the company’s commitment to excellence in project management and its dedication to implementing best practices.\n\nThe announcement was celebrated at an event held at the MTN Plaza, where George Asamani, Managing Director of PMI Sub-Saharan Africa, presented the PMI Global Executive Council certificate to the company. This milestone underscores the company’s leadership in the telecommunications sector and sets a new standard for project management excellence across Africa.\n\n“Joining the PMI Global Executive Council signals MTN Nigeria’s commitment to innovation and excellence, this council represents the best in project management globally, and MTN Nigeria’s inclusion is a significant achievement for the African continent,” said George Asamani, Managing Director, PMI, Sub-Saharan Arica.\n\nThe PMI Global Executive Council comprises industry-leading organizations from around the world, who come together to share best and emerging project management practices that shape policies and frameworks globally. In partnership with PMI, the Council creates meaningful opportunities for learning and networking through engaging experiences and events featuring influential thought leaders.\n\n“We are thrilled to be part of the PMI Global Executive Council,” said Shoyinka Shodunke, Chief Information Officer of MTN Nigeria. “This membership aligns with our strategic goals and provides a platform to showcase our innovative project management practices. We look forward to sharing our experiences and collaborating with other industry leaders to further enhance our services.”\n\nMTN Nigeria’s role in the Council will encompass strategic areas including disciplined agile assessment aligned with the company’s objectives, acceleration of skilling and knowledge initiatives, and leveraging AI for advanced project management practices.\n\nAs MTN Nigeria continues to drive innovation in the telecommunications industry, its membership in the PMI Global Executive Council will facilitate strategic partnerships and knowledge exchange, engage with pioneering projects, contribute to the global dialogue on best practices in project management.\n\nMTN Nigeria Communications Plc., has boosted the Federal Government’s Food Support Programme with N1billion donation and 4,600 digital devices.\n\nSenator Kashim Shettima, vice president of Nigeria was on hand to receive the delegation of the technology company led by Engineer Ndukwe Ndukwe, Chairman of MTN Nigeria, at the Presidential Villa, in Abuja.\n\nThe VP commended the donation of N1 billion to the Federal Government’s Food Support Programme and 4,600 units of digital devices for distribution to schools.\n\nHe said the gesture by the telecommunications outfit towards the government’s efforts in addressing hardship in the country is worthy of emulation and indicative of its commitment to the development of the Nigerian economy.\n\n“I am hugely proud of your (MTN’s) stability as a company and commitment to the progress of our country. We have witnessed a couple of changes in the industry, but you have remained stable and strong. On behalf of my boss, President Bola Tinubu, I want to sincerely thank you for this gesture”, he said.\n\nSpeaking further during his engagement with the MTN Nigeria chairman, Senator Shettima said the donation by the company will be judiciously managed by the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment and the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA).\n\nOn the distribution of 4,600 digital devices, each pre-installed with the Ulesson application, the Vice President said the MTN team will liaise with his office to work on the beneficiary criteria and facilitate the distribution of the devices to secondary schools in the six geo-political zones.\n\nHe expressed confidence that the gesture by the company would go a long way in supporting the government’s efforts to address the situation in the country, including support for the educational needs of the poor and vulnerable.\n\nWhile calling on other companies in the country to emulate MTN in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility, the VP assured the business community that the President Tinubu’s administration remains pro-business and its policies will, in a short time, begin to manifest for all to see.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of MTN Nigeria commended the Federal Government for its efforts to revive the economic fortunes of the country through various initiatives rolled out across Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) of government.\n\nHe pledged the company’s support to the present administration, noting that the gesture is in line with MTN Nigeria’s shared value objectives of “the AMBITION 2025 strategy” where MTN seeks to support strategic initiatives of the federal government.\n\nOn the N1 billion donation, Engineer Ndukwe said, “It aims to support the most vulnerable, marginalized, and underserved communities, ensuring no one is left behind through increased collaboration and partnership with the Federal Government of Nigeria.”\n\nHe expressed hope that the devices donated by the company will support the Federal Government’s objective to increase digital literacy in secondary schools and improve creativity, analytical thinking, adaptability, and students’ access to current information in science and technology."
