        "text": "Gombe State University was established in 2003 by the Governor Muhammed Danjuma Goje. It is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities.\n\nAs its name suggests, the university is located in Gombe State, northeastern Nigeria.\n\nThere are five faculties at the university: faculty of arts and social sciences, faculty of education, faculty of science, faculty of law and the faculty of pharmaceutical sciences. Each faculty is divided into different departments offering a range of both undergraduate and graduate degree programmes. There is also the school of post graduate studies and the school of basic and remedial studies.\n\nThe university is also home to the college of medical sciences, which was originally founded in 2006 as the faculty of medicine. In 2010 it was renamed the college of medical sciences and today consists of three faculties: faculty of medical sciences, faculty of basic clinical sciences and the faculty of clinical sciences. The college aims to train students to become medical practitioners.\n\nThe Students’ Affairs Division was set up in 2004 to enrich the student experience. It has numerous responsibilities including assisting with the development and administration of the Student Union, overseeing the student’s recreation and sports programme, and caring for students’ welfare."
