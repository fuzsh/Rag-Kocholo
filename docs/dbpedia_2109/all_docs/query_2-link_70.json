        "text": "The National Universities Commission (NUC) has approved the Gombe State University of Science and Technology, Kumo, as the 2nd State University in Gombe State, making it the 46th State University, 86th Public University and 154th University in Nigeria.\n\nPresenting the Certificate of Recognition to the Visitor and Governor of Gombe State, Alhaji Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo last Thursday, the Executive Secretary, NUC, Professor Abubakar Adamu Rasheed, mni, MFR, FNAL, said the approval was granted considering the fact that the previously established Gombe State university was doing well adding that the new university would also receive adequate funding from the state government.\n\nProfessor Rasheed urged the state government to do more in infrastructure development, stressing that the establishment of the science and technology-driven higher institution was imperative for the country’s transition to a knowledge-driven economy.\n\nConveying the approval which he read from the letter, the Scribe said: “This letter is for the recognition of the Gombe State university of Science and Technology, Kumo, consequent upon your letter of intent and the formal presentation of the Master Plan, Academic Brief, University Laws and the Act of Paliaments that approved its establishment. I, on behalf of the NUC write to convey the recognition of the Gombe State University of Science and Technology with effect from Thursday 27th October 2017.\n\nHe further stated that the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) and the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), are accordingly informed of the establishment of the University for the purposes of admission and NYSC mobilisation for its students and graduates.”\n\nThe Executive Secretary remarked that the University project would succeed, noting that his confidence stemmed from the analysis made on the previously established Gombe State University which he said was receiving adequate attention from the state government. He stated that NUC was always happy whenever a new university was established, as it gives the assurance that the country’s quest for development was achievable. He observed that Nigeria would not achieve a knowledge-based economy without huge investment in education hence the need for more universities.\n\nAccording to him, “More than 1.5 million candidates write JAMB every year to get admission into the University but Nigerian universities can only admit less than a million. So every year, youth are frustrated because they cannot get admitted into the University. NUC welcomes anyone that wants to establish a university in order to assist our population. But we do not compromise on standard. We have sent seven proposals for the establishment of private universities to the Minister of Education for his recommendation to the Federal Executive Council for approval.”\n\nReceiving the Letter of Recognition, the Executive Governor commended the NUC for the warm reception accorded to his delegation and for standing out as a regulatory institution. He said that the Commission had been quietly building the nation’s education sector, especially since the last one year of the current leadership. He particularly expressed profound appreciation to the Executive Secretary for helping the state to consolidate on the establishment of a second university in the state. He gave the assurance that the two Universities would be well-funded and equipped with state of the art facilities to enable it produce globally competitive graduates.\n\nGov. Dankwambo disclosed that the state three main priorities were education, education and education, adding that the government realised the important role education plays in the socio-economic development of a state. He said that as far as education was concern in Gombe State, there was no political divide as everyone irrespective of party affinity was united in achieving such dreams. He charged the traditional rulers to encourage their subjects to pursue courses in science related disciplines in order to justify the investment.\n\nHe observed that a lasting solution to insurgency rampaging the area is learning hence the need to invest more in education. According to him, “Most internally-displaced persons have relocated to Gombe State and experts have proffer a lasting solution to insurgency and it is learning.”\n\nAccording to him, 150 hectares of land has been set aside for Gombe state university of science and technology.“We are ready for the project and by January, faculty of medicine and pharmacy will be functioning properly” the governor concluded.\n\nIn his remarks, the Director of Academic Planning, NUC, Dr Gidado B. Kumo thanked the governor for establishing the university in his home town and promised that the community would endeavour to be a good host community to the university by providing enabling environment for the university to thrive. He also thanked all his colleagues in the NUC who had supported the establishment of the University, especially the purposeful leadership of Prof. Abubakar Adamu Rasheed in handling affairs of the NUC with vigor and determination.\n\nIn a vote of thanks, the Commissioner of Higher Education also appreciated the Commission for the speedy approval. He again, on behalf of the good people of Gombe State, thanked all Gombe indigenes from all works of life who came on a short notice to identify with the performing governor and support this momentous occasion. The Commissioner prayed for journey mercies to all back to their various destination.\n\nAmong the personalities in the Governor’s entourage were the Members of the National and State Assembly from the State, members of the academia from Gombe and neighboring states, captains of industries and indigenes of Gombe working in Abuja and its environs, Royal fathers and other dignitaries.\n\nMost of members of the NUC Management and staff of the Commission were also present at the event."
