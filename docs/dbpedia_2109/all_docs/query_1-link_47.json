        "meta_description": "Background Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) have remained major sources of social and public health concern globally with worsening indices in developing countries and especially linked to the growing menace of antimicrobial resistance and poor infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. Diagnosis and treatment of STIs in low resource settings is still sub-optimal due to limited availability and or poor laboratory support with dearth of expertise in relevant disciplines. Many sexually transmitted pathogens are either fastidious or atypical thereby making their detection/identification more demanding. Establishment of special treatment clinics which are primarily concerned with managing STIs have been practiced with great successes across different parts of Nigeria. We for the first time present the pattern of STIs among patients attending the Special Treatment Clinic (STC) in Federal Teaching Hospital Gombe (FTHG) Nigeria.\n\nMethods This was a hospital based cross sectional study in which sociodemographic and clinical/laboratory findings of 422 patients who presented at the STC of FTHG between 2015 and 2020 were analysed. The STC in FTHG is primarily concerned with management of STIs with in-built consulting/treatment room, side laboratory and records subunits.\n\nResults Of the 422 patients, majority are married (73.7%) and predominantly within the sexually active age group of 21–40 years (80.7%). Female patients are more (62.3%) than males and vaginal discharge is their most common (76.7%) clinical presentation. Most common diagnoses among the patients are vulvovaginal/perineal candidiasis (24.9%) and bacterial vaginosis (19.9). Others include genital ulcer disease; GUD (12.9%), non-gonococcal urethritis; NGU (12.9%), genital warts (9.6%) and gonococcal urethritis/cervicitis (5.0%).\n\nConclusion Vulvovaginal/perineal candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis are the most common diagnoses at the STC in Gombe Nigeria. The STC provides a convenient and effective avenue for the management of genital tract infections while hoping for expansion and improvement for better patient care and satisfaction.",
