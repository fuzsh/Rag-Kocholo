        "text": "Government bringing innovation into its activities is a good gesture but innovation that constitutes peril due to inadequate technical capability necessitates re-assessment, hence this investigation.This study investigated susceptibility of some chosen government websites to infiltration due to flaws in the design of their websites. Sixty four websites of some organizations were randomly selected using an advanced feature of google to sieve organization’s websites that have adopted the use of country code Top Level Domain (ccTLD) i.e. the “.gov.ng”. The research was based on some major measuring parameters which are: Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Structured Query Language injection (SQLi), Cookie manipulation (CM), unencrypted password (UP) and broken links (BL). The sixty four (64) government websites chosen span 8 categories of sectors with a view to evaluating their immunity against cyber attacks. It was found that 27 (42.2%) of the websites are vulnerable to XSS, while 20 (31.3%) to SQLi. Also, 24 websites which represents 37.5% of the websites examined are having the password inputted by the user unencrypted while a high percentage (70.3) have informational issues, like broken links which in itself may not constitute high vulnerability but could create susceptible platform which could permit infiltration. Thereafter, some appropriate policy directions which provide technical advice as to protect government resources available through the Internet were advanced. This tends to also increase citizens’ confidence on the adoption of the government web-presence initiative.\n\nUsability is the pinnacle of interface design with the manifestation of need-based Website Interface as its key component in E-government Websites. This paper evaluated the select E-government Websites in India through a comprehensive content analysis using heuristic evaluation to determine the nature of distribution of the ordinal population of variables that may complement and contribute to a pleasurable user experience. Research Aim An Expert-based Heuristic Evaluation perspective was proposed to evaluate Homepage considered as a prerequisite for the survival of E-government Websites. Through the constituent dimensions namely Online Services, User Help and Feedback, Navigation, Legitimacy, Information Architecture and Accessibility Accommodation, an attempt was made to principally demonstrate the implementation status of Usability in these Websites in India. Theoretical Framework Evaluation of E-government Website Usability primarily considered noticeable aspects of the ordinal structure of Usability dimensions germane to E-government Websites. The validated theoretical framework enhanced by Baker (2004) asserted the demand side strategic considerations in E-government development in India. Methodological Framework An Explanatory Research Design rigorously investigated the Homepage Usability of E-government Websites by logically interconnecting various methods and procedures. The Conceptual/Thematic Content Analysis of a wellformulated set of ordinal Usability heuristics evaluated E-government Websites and presented with intensity of variables along a continuum across six dimensions. A Usability Measurement Tool comprising 14 Usability heuristics with 56 scale measures was developed and applied to a cluster of 17 E-government Websites in India for examining the implementation status of its Usability. Research Prerogative The available literature cites poor Usability as one of the critical factors for continued failure of E-government services in developing countries. Hence, an Expert-based Heuristic Evaluation of Homepage becomes paramount to address the significant gap in E-government systems besieged by several Usability problems. Research Implications The prologue to select Usability heuristics for assessment of the nature of ordinality of variables on Homepage of select E-government Websites provide an analytical framework for addressing high Usability standards for users to maximize benefits from E-government Websites. The findings of this study have a potential significance that may aid\n\nThe paper attempts to provide an understanding of the concept of e-Government as the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to enhance access to and delivery of government information and services to benefit citizenry, businesses and employees. It examines motives and objectives of e-Government application as services integration in order to be more citizen-centric, increases government Internal Effecctiveness and Efficiency (IEE). Survey research design and purposive sampling technique was adopted to conduct the study. Questionnaire with ten questions and interviews were used to collect data from the twenty two (22) sampled population. The research reveals that systematic approach, long-term view and flexible planning with modest objectives and scope are major attribute to e-Government success. Moreover, all Adamawa State Ministries are lacking adequate ICT infrastructure such as website for effective implementation of e-Government initiatives. Based on the current circumstances, recommendations were given such that the ministries should improve their ICT infrastructure, computer literacy training, and organize awareness programmes on the objectives, approach and motive of e-Government application.\n\nSeveral governments across the world have embraced the digital revolution and continue to take advantage of the information and communication facilities offered by the Internet to offer public services. Conversely, citizens’ awareness and expectations of Internet based online-public-services have also increased in recent times. Although the numbers of the different national e-Government web portals have rapidly increased in the last three years, the success of these portals will largely depend on their accessibility, quality and privacy. This paper reports the results of an evaluative study of a cross-section of e-Government portals from these three perspectives, using a common set of performance metrics and Web diagnostic engines. Results show that not only are there wide variations in the spectrum of information and services provided by these portals, but that significant work still needs to be undertaken in order to make the portals examples of ‘best practice’ e-Government services.\n\nIn recent years, many people have devoted their efforts to the issue of quality of Web site. The concept of quality consists of many criteria like quality of service perspective, user perspective, content perspective and usability perspective. Because of its possible instant worldwide audience a Website&#39;s quality and reliability are crucial. The very special nature of the Web applications and Websites pose unique software testing challenges. Webmasters, Web applications developers, and Website quality assurance managers need tools and methods that can match up to the new need. An attempt has been made in this paper to conduct various tests on website usage which includes response time, load time, size of a website and number of items, Structural aspect which includes code and link validation and content which includes link popularity. All the above factors were studied to measure the quality of e-Government websites of J&K state via different online service. Result of this study..."
