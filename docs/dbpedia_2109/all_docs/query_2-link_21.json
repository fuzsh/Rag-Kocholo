        "text": "Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya was born in Gombe on 9th October 1961 to the family of an accomplished businessman and philanthropist, Alhaji Yahaya Umaru. He graduated from the prestigious Ahmadu Bello University Zaria in 1983 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Accounting.\n\nHe is a Fellow of several professional bodies, notable amongst which are the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM) and a member of Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (ACITN). Yahaya has attended several development courses, workshops and seminars both within and outside Nigeria.\n\nHis several years of working experience transcend both the public and private sector of the Nigerian Economy. He started his career as an Accountant II with the Bauchi State Investment and Property Development (B.S.I.P.D.C) and rapidly rose to become a Principal Accountant. He moved to Nasara Motors Limited as an Administration and Finance Manager with additional responsibility of managing other affiliate companies such as Nasara Agro Industrial Company Limited, Nasara Petroleum Marketing Company Limited and A.Y.U Civil Engineering Limited. He later became the Managing Director of the group for four years.\n\nIn 2003, he was appointed to the Gombe State Executive Council under Sen. Muhammadu Danjuma Goje’s administration where he served as Commissioner of Finance and Economic Development. For over seven years he served as commissioner, he was in charge of Budgetary Planning and Financial Controls of the State and was Chairman of the Board of the Gombe State Investment and Property Development Company Limited during the same period. He was also the Chairman of the State Standing Committee on payment of compensation as well as the Chairman of the Wages and Personal Emoluments Review Committee of the State until 2010.\n\nConsidering the role he played in laying the foundation for a new Gombe State when he served as the Commissioner of Finance and Economic Development from 2003 to 2010, he was elected by overwhelming majority as the 4th Civilian Governor of Gombe State on May 29, 2020. Since then, Governor Inuwa has carried on with the task of building a better Gombe with uncommon zeal. In just one year in office, his achievements so far have earned him commendations from within and outside the country.\n\nMuhammadu Inuwa Yahaya is a foundation member of All Progressives Congress (APC) and the party’s flag bearer in the 2015 and 2019 Governorship elections in Gombe state.\n\nGovernor Inuwa Yahaya is happily married to two wives and blessed with seven children."
