        "text": "By Auwal Ahmad Umar\n\nThe Gombe Emirate is a traditional state in Nigeria that roughly corresponds in area to the modern Gombe State, Gombe also contains the emirates of Dukku, Deba, Akko, Yamaltu, Pindiga, Nafada and Funakaye, the current Emir of Gombe is Alhaji Abubakar Shehu Abubakar III, who acceded the throne on June 6, 2014. The late Emir of Gombe, Alhaji Shehu Usman Abubakar, had been Emir since August 1984\n\nThe Gombe emirate was founded in 1804 during the Fulani jihad by Buba Yaro, a follower of Usman Dan Fodio, Buba Yaro made Gombe Aba his headquarters for a campaign against the Jukun settlements of Pindiga and Kalam, followed by extensive raids in which he went as far as Adamawa on the other side of the Benue River. Further lands were subdued by his son, Muhammadu Kwairanga, Emir of Gombe from 1844 to 1882. The Gombe emirate at one time extended from Gombe Aba to Jalingo, but in 1833 the Muri Emirate was created from part of its territory to form a state for the Emir's brother.\n\nDuring the reign of Emir Zailani (1882â€“1888) a religious zealot, Mallam Jibril Gaini, established himself at Bormi in Funakaye local government on the border between Gombe and Fika. Gaini managed to hold out for years against the combined forces of Gombe and neighboring emirates, and was finally defeated and exiled by the British Royal Niger Company in 1902. The British conquered Gombe at the battle of Tongo in 1902. They moved the capital of Gombe to Nafada in 1913, and moved the capital again in 1919 to the present Gombe town. Waja was separated from Gombe in 1930 to become an independent District. However, the Waja headmen chose Sarkin Yaki of Gombe, brother of the former Emir Umaru Dan Muhammadu, as their chief.\n\nThe Emirs of Gombe, Abubakar \"Buba Yero\" Dan Usman Subande 1804-1841, Suleman Dan Abubakar 1841-1844, Muhammadu Kwairanga Dan Abubakar 1844-1882, Abdulqadir Zailani Dan Muhammadu 1882-1888, Hassan Dan Muhammadu 1888-1895, Tukur Dan Muhammadu 1895-1898, Umaru Dan Muhammadu 1898-1922, Haruna Dan Umaru 1922-1935, Abubakar Dan Umaru 1936-1984, Usman Abubakar Umar 1984-2014 and the Present Emir Abubakar Shehu Abubakar III June 2014.\n\nIn 2002, Gombe State Governor Abubakar Habu Hashidu broke up Gombe Emirate into parts, ruled by 2nd Class Emirs, Funakaye, Nadafa, Deba, Yamaltu, Akko, Pindiga and Gwana and in 2004 Governor Mohammed Danjuma Goje created two additional Senior District Heads.\n\nUnder the British, the state was administered through the mechanism of two administrative units, Gombe native Authority and Tangale Waja Native Authorities. The two Authorities constituted Gombe division during the colonial era. However, with independence in 1960 and the subsequent military administration, many changes occured which led to the emergence of local government authorities. Thus, between 1976 and the present, the then two authorities had metamorphosed into the present 11 local governments areas.\n\nHowever in October 1996 Gombe state was created out of Bauchi State by the late General Sani Abacha Administration with its capital at Gombe town and the state comprises many tribal groups which include Tangale, Tera, Waja, Fulani, Kanuri, Bolewa, Jukun, Pero/Shonge, Tula, Cham, Lunguda, Dadiya, Hausa and Kamo/Awak. Hausa is the commercial language amidst the people."
