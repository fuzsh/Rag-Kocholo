        "text": "Source: WHO Global Health Expenditure Database. Health Expenditure Profiles.\n\nImmunization Financing\n\nImmunization is one of the most important and cost-effective public health interventions. According to one study, for every US$1 spent on immunization between 2011 and 2020, there was an average return of up to US$26 dollars across a child’s lifetime.43 In 2022, Nigeria spent approximately $177.5 million on routine immunization, including vaccines, of which 55 percent was financed by the government and 45 percent by external funders.44\n\nDonor Support\n\nAlthough Nigeria is one of Gavi’s largest recipients and Gavi is the country’s largest source of external financing for immunization, Nigeria is expected to graduate from Gavi support by 2028 after exceeding its eligibility threshold.45 Nigeria has developed a national strategy (Nigeria’s Strategy for Immunization and PHC System Strengthening [NSIPSS]) to guide its transition to self-financing.3 The NSIPSS and its complementary 2021-2024 NSIPSS 2.0 outline strategies for increasing the government’s financial commitment to immunization programming on an annual basis by strengthening financial management and identifying financing approaches to fund vaccine, operational, and system costs.3,46 In 2018, Gavi provided more than US$52 million in immunization programming support, largely to fund new and under-used vaccine support for the pneumococcal conjugate and IPV vaccines, as well as for yellow fever campaigns and measles follow-up campaigns (Figure 12).\n\nSource: Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Disbursement Data, 2022.\n\nIn addition to Gavi, important development partners for immunization in Nigeria include the World Bank, UNICEF, WHO, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dangote Foundation, and the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).47\n\nThe National Primary Health Care Agency (NPHCDA), a parastatal agency within the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), is the main government organization responsible for driving Nigeria’s immunization policy and central coordination.46,3 There are six departments within it, including the Disease Control and Immunization department that works with development partners to provide oversight and support to supplementary immunization activities, national campaigns, and community engagement activities. The Interagency Coordination Committee (ICC), chaired by the FMOH, is the primary coordinating and decision-making body for polio eradication, routine immunization, and non-polio disease control initiatives. Its members include representatives from the FMOH, NPHCDA, LGAs, and development partners. The Core Group, chaired by the executive director of the NPHCDA, provides technical support to the ICC and oversees the planning and implementation of all immunization activities ongoing in the country. It reviews inputs from the National Emergency Routine Immunization Coordination Center (NERICC) and other working groups and provides supervisory oversight on behalf of the ICC. The NERICC, established in 2017, supports states to address immunization coverage inequities, with state and LGA-level centers also being rolled out as key coordinating mechanisms for immunization planning and monitoring in the lowest performing states.46,3\n\nNational Policies and Action Plans\n\nThe NSIPSS is the government’s primary document for outlining immunization-related priorities. The NSIPSS was developed for the period of 2018-2028, originally as part of the Gavi transition plan that started in 2017, and outlines Nigeria’s immunization programming and priorities.\n\nThe strategy describes recent immunization achievements including improvements in vaccine supply chain at the LGA level, strengthened financial management of the NPHCDA, and the establishment of the NERICC to improve routine immunization in the 18 states with the lowest coverage rates. It also describes immunization-related gaps and challenges such as stagnant immunization coverage rates, poor government funding and financing mechanisms at the federal and state levels, weak primary health care infrastructure, inadequate and inequitable distribution of qualified human resources for health, and an inadequate drug supply and sub-optimal cold chain. National objectives set forth in the plan include attaining a national coverage rate of 80 percent for all scheduled routine antigens, outlining strategies to improve equitable immunization coverage, strengthening the primary health care system, identifying and prioritizing the resources need to reach targets, and providing frameworks to guide investments, donor transitions, and implement monitoring and evaluation strategies. The NSIPSS contains several strategies for Nigeria’s immunization program relevant to ZD programming efforts. The strategy recognizes that ZD prevalence varies by state and that states with high immunization coverage still have high populations of ZD children. Therefore, equity must be a focus alongside efforts to reach national targets. Equity will be considered in decisions on the scale and intensity of strategies, and implementation plans associated with the NSIPSS will provide details on “state differentiation.” Equity will also be a factored into the introduction of new vaccines at the state level. Other strategies include periodic intensification of routine immunization through local immunization days and other activities in LGAs with high numbers of ZD children, as well as targeted and tailored services for people living in poverty in unsuccessfully reached urban informal settlements and in areas facing security risks. The focus on ZD children in the NSIPSS signals a commitment by the government to improve immunization coverage and address equity gaps.3\n\nA complementary and updated NSIPSS was developed for 2021–2024 to provide a three-year roadmap for strengthening immunization programming based on experiences from and progress made in the first three years of the 2018-2028 NSIPSS and to reposition the NSIPSS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and updated global immunization agendas (Immunization Agenda 2030 and Gavi 5.0).3 The NSIPSS 2.0 includes a revised national goal of achieving routine immunization coverage of 90 percent for all antigens in at least 90 percent of LGAs. It also includes specific objectives of reducing the number of UI children by 20 percent by 2024 based on Penta3 coverage and the number of ZD children by 35 percent based on Penta1 coverage. Reducing the number of ZD children is considered in all of the objectives, strategies, and activities outlined in the document. Specific strategies for improving access to and use of immunization services for ZD children and missed communities include optimized integrated reproductive, maternal, newborn child, adolescent health, and nutrition (RMNCAH+N) and immunization sessions; a geospatial microplanning toolkit; and an integrated medical outreach program. The NSIPSS 2.0 also considers the country’s ZD reduction strategy and specifically mentions interventions to reach ZD children in humanitarian assistance contexts, including those in areas affected by conflict.\n\nMore generally, the inclusion of immunization activities in national strategy and policy documents indicates the government’s commitment to reduce vaccine preventable disease nationally. Table 3 summarizes key government documents that address the importance of immunization and outline specific activities and targets.\n\nTable 3. National Policy and Strategy Documents Relevant to Immunization\n\nHuman Resources for Health\n\nAdequate human resources are essential for all health care services, including immunization services. However, immunization programs require a range of staff, including clinicians, supply chain professionals, logisticians, cold chain technicians, and data entry staff. Mid-level health care professionals, including nurses, midwives, and community health extension workers (CHEWs), are the main providers of immunization services in Nigeria.48,46,49 Although Nigeria has one of the largest pools of human resources for health in the region, it still faces a chronic shortage of health workers and unequal distribution particularly in the North and in rural areas.3,38 The shortage of trained health workers to provide immunization services has been reported as a key factor affecting vaccine availability and uptake.50,51,52 Data from the WHO National Health Workforce Accounts database indicate that between 2016 and 2021, the ratio of nursing and midwifery personnel decreased from 9.81 and 7.49 per 10,000 people to 9.45 and 6.18 per 10,000 people, respectively.53 Data on the number of CHEWs is limited and varying, with government figures from 2012 estimating 42,938 workers while the WHO reported only 7,912 in 2021.38,52 The 10-year NSIPSS includes a number of strategies to build a robust health workforce, including instituting a routing human resources for health assessment, improving both the number of accredited training institutions and the curriculums they use, rolling out task-shifting initiatives, and revising training packages to include junior community health workers.3\n\nHealth Management Information System Structure and Disaggregation (DHIS2), Data Availability and Use\n\nNigeria operationalized its national health management information system in 1999, which was then configured to DHIS2 in 2010.54,55 In 2014, partners supported the FMOH and NPHCDA to develop a routine immunization module that collects data on vaccine administration and management from the health facility level. Routine immunization data was incorporated into DHIS2 at this time.\n\nData from the facility level are collected via three paper-based summary forms, which are collated every month by LGA staff who enter the data into DHIS2 (Figure 13).56 DHIS2 automatically calculates 21 indicators using the raw data and displays them on a dashboard so immunization officials at the national, state, and LGA levels can monitor EPI performance and process. Indicators include information on data reporting, coverage and drop-out rates, vaccination sessions, supervision, vaccine logistics, cold chain functionality, and funding disbursed to health facilities. Roll out of DHIS2 at the state level was completed in 2017, and by July 2019, more than 80 percent of LGAs were reporting on all four data sources.54 A separate pilot study in Kano, the first state to deploy the immunization module in DHIS2, found that following implementation, the percentage of LGAs (44 total) reporting data in a timely manner increased from 67 to 88 percent, and the percentage of LGAs with complete monthly routine data increased from 70 to 87 percent.57\n\nAn analysis of RMNCH indicators in DHIS2 found the overall expected monthly facility reports was 81 percent in 2021 while only 27 percent of districts had facility reports that were at least 90 percent complete. Another analysis of routine immunization data in DHIS2 reported a completeness rate of 93 percent in December 2022.58 However, no comprehensive national-level data quality assessments of DHIS2 data, including immunization data, were identified in the literature. Several studies assessing the quality of immunization data at the state and LGA levels have found that data quality continues to be a persistent issue at the sub-national level and identified various challenges, including lack of training on reporting tools for health workers, infrequent and inadequate supervision, and heavy workloads.59,60,61,62\n\nFigure 13. DHIS2 Reporting System in Nigeria\n\nSource: Tchoualeu, Dieula Delissaint, Hashim Elzein Elmousaad, Lynda Uju Osadebe, Oluwasegun Joel Adegoke, Chimeremma Nnadi, et al. “Use of a district health information system 2 routine immunization dashboard for immunization program monitoring and decision making, Kano State, Nigeria.” The Pan African Medical Journal 40, Suppl 1 (November 12, 2021): 2. doi:10.11604/pamj.supp.2021.40.1.17313.\n\nSeveral initiatives have been implemented to strengthen the HMIS as well as immunization data. In 2017, the country began rolling out a system that integrates immunization logistics data, including vaccine stock data and cold-chain equipment status, into DHIS2 so that this information can be triangulated with service delivery data.56 The NSIPSS also details efforts to improve methods for determining the denominator of immunization coverage rates by using national GIS mapping and household enumeration during microplanning.3 The 2020 Multi Stakeholder Dialogue Report from Gavi reported that these approaches had been piloted in a few LGAs.\n\nImmunization Supply Chain and Commodities\n\nInadequate drug supply and sub-optimal cold chain continue to be challenges in the delivery of immunization services and is a key area of focus in the NSIPSS and the National Vaccine Policy.3,63 The Department of Logistics and Health Commodities is responsible for managing the supply chain and coordinating with State Logistics Working Groups, Logistics Management Coordination Units, and partners. Nigeria procures all of its vaccines from UNICEF and manages a five-level cold chain system with storage sites at the national, zonal, state, LGA, and facility levels. The federal government is responsible for the national strategic cold store and for transporting vaccines to the zonal and state stores, while the states and LGAs are responsible for getting vaccines to end users (Figure 14).46 The 2018–2028 NSIPSS proposes implementing a three-hub model with stores in Abuja, Lagos, and Kano to improve the efficiency and capacity of the distribution network.3\n\nFigure 14. Vaccine Cold Chain System in Nigeria\n\nSource: Logistics Department, NPHCDA.\n\nVaccine unavailability, transportation challenges from cold storage at the LGA to facilities, and inadequate power supply to maintain cold storage at the facility level have been cited as challenges in immunization service delivery.49 Ensuring a stable vaccine supply chain is critical to improving immunization coverage. A study by Gooding et al. found that stockouts significantly affected the number of children immunized for all antigens included in the analysis (polio, BCG, measles, yellow fever, Penta, pneumococcal conjugate, and hepatitis B). For example, a stockout of the polio vaccine resulted in 226 fewer children receiving the vaccine in the same month. Furthermore, a stockout in one month resulted in fewer children being vaccinated in the following months for some antigens.64\n\nSince 2016, the NPHCDA has established long-term contracts with third party logistics providers for a vaccine transport system from the national to state level and has proposed a scale-up of its “Push Plus” system that provides direct delivery to cold chain-equipped facilities to address challenges at the last mile.3 A preliminary assessment of this system in Kano State found that there was an increase in stock adequacy from 54 percent to 68 percent and a decrease in stock-out rates from 41 percent to 10 percent following 20 months of implementation.65 Another study also found that the new push system had improved access to immunization by eliminating the need for facility workers to visit vaccine storage facilities and helping to ensure the facility has a consistent supply of vaccines.28\n\nCommunity Health Structure and Role in Routine Immunization\n\nNigeria does not have a formal policy or strategy on community health care, but various policies focused on primary health care provide strategies and frameworks for community health including its role in immunization service delivery. The LGAs are responsible for the delivery of primary health care and coordinate with Ward Development Committees (WDC) and Village Development Committees (VDC) to provide the community with links to health posts, primary health clinics, and primary health centers. These committees also supervise the CHEWs, community health officers (CHOs), community resource persons (CORPs), and junior community health extension workers (JCHEWs). CHOs, CHEWs, and JCHEWs are all salaried providers at the lowest level of the primary health care system and receive formal training. CORPs is a general term that encompasses informal community health providers often supported by NGOs.66\n\nAccording to the FMOH’s Minimum Standards for Primary Health Care, CHOs, CHEWs, and JCHEWs can all identify eligible pregnant women and children for immunization, provide routine immunization, participate in immunization campaigns, and assist in the management of adverse effects and identification of acute flaccid paralysis.47\n\nImmunization Program Details\n\nNigeria’s National Program on Immunization was first established in 1978 and then later merged with the NPHCDA in 2007 so that it was fully integrated with the primary health care system. Immunization services are provided at health facilities, by CHEWs through weekly outreach services conducted within 5 to 10 km from an assigned health facility, and monthly mobile services that target populations more than 10 km away from a facility.\n\nThe NPHCDA is responsible for national-level policy, planning, and regulation while the state ministries of health, mainly the state health care development agencies (SPHCDAs), oversee the implementation of primary health care and oversee LGAs who are primarily responsible for immunization service delivery (Figure 15). The local governments are supported by ward and village development committees, although the functionality of these committees is not standard and varies by state.46 For example, a study on immunization use in Remo-North LGA in Ogun State found that a development committee in one ward had been promoting community linkages with the health facility and immunization services while the committee in a nearby ward had been defunct due to political disagreements for several years.49\n\nFigure 15.
