Nigeria, being the most populous country in Africa, needs to take prompt action to be able to eliminate dog-mediated rabies by 2030. Surveillance is an essential part of effective rabies control. This study used a mixed-methods approach to investigate how well the rabies surveillance system in Gombe state, Nigeria, is working to detect and manage cases early. A total of 157 potential human exposures to rabies were found with two deaths suggestive of rabies. The human health and veterinary sectors were found to work together to assess risks and manage potential rabies exposures, but several factors were identified that compromised effectiveness of surveillance. Key barriers were lack of funding, infrastructure, feedback from higher authorities, and knowledge of rabies prevention and management. To improve the system, authorities are encouraged to raise awareness about rabies, employ more workers, and strengthen the capabilities of existing workers in Gombe state. By doing this, they can better detect and manage rabies cases and work towards eliminating the disease.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nRabies, despite being completely preventable via pre and post-exposure vaccination and immunoglobulins still causes estimated annual deaths of 59,000 people mostly within Asia (59.6%) and Africa (36.4%) [1,2]. The lack of accurate records about the true prevalence of rabies in humans and animals within Africa prevents full understanding of its burden and poses significant challenges to current prevention and control efforts [3–5].\n\nNigeria, the most populous African country remains in the list of countries with dog-mediated endemic rabies in humans that needs to be eliminated [6,7]. Although there is a global drive to eliminate canine-mediated rabies infection in humans by 2030 [8,9], the chances for Nigeria to reach this goal remains a challenge if the status quo remains the same [7]. For instance, the Nigerian government remains burdened by other competing priorities such as inflation, rising insecurity, rising unemployment, brain drain, and religious differences which negatively impact its commitments towards rabies control [10–13].\n\nSurveillance is the continuous collection, analysis and interpretation of health-related data in populations to increase the likelihood of timely detection of health threats and inform disease mitigation actions [14,15]. Rabies surveillance information provides insights on the geographical distribution and epidemiology of animal bites and rabies cases and helps to monitor the effectiveness of rabies mitigation strategies [16,17]. Such insights can be employed in both the design of rabies control strategies and their implementation [18,19]. The One Health (OH) approach advocates for interdisciplinary efforts to address efficiently risks at the human-animal-ecosystem interface [20] and to promote the health of humans, animals and the environment. Collaborative and multi-sectoral efforts have been shown to add value when compared with individual sectors working in silos [21,22]. The OH approach has been identified by the global health security agenda as an integral part to achieve health security against the threat of infectious diseases [23]. Recent analyses from the World Bank suggest that the OH approach when used at country level for disease prevention could yield about $30 billion per year globally as return on investment [23,24].\n\nRabies surveillance in Nigeria is conducted by both the health and veterinary sectors. The health sector relies on the use of the WHO Regional Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy which constitutes an evidence-based approach employed to strengthen national public health through promotion of rational use of scarce resources and integration of surveillance activities for collection of rabies data in humans [25,26]. Despite the existence of a standard reporting procedure, previous studies indicated that underreporting is common [5,27–29]. The standard reporting process in Nigeria requires rabies to be reported immediately to either the closest health facility or to the veterinary clinic [30]. The health or veterinary facilities handle and submit information as required by the Ministry of Health and Agriculture, respectively. Between 2016 and 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported only 11 fatalities for Nigeria from an estimated population of 202 million people [31].\n\nThe veterinary sector uses the National Animal Disease Information and Surveillance (NADIS) to collect rabies surveillance information from various parts of the country including veterinary clinics, veterinary teaching hospitals and the Ministry of Agriculture [25]. A 2020 study conducted in Benue State, Nigeria [5] found that smaller veterinary clinics rarely followed the standard reporting process which contributes to poor data reliability and quality and hinders a full understanding of the prevalence of the disease.\n\nThere is a need to understand the surveillance system and factors that affect effective case detection and inform rabies control activities. An understanding of the underlying factors that affect the capacity of the surveillance system to promptly identify and manage cases effectively can help to improve the performance of the system and develop interventions targeted at the affected population [14,32]. Although a good body of literature exists on rabies within Nigeria, to the authors’ knowledge, no specific assessments were published on the rabies surveillance system in humans and animals. Information obtained from evaluation on the capacity of the surveillance would provide practical feedback to stakeholders on areas which can be targeted for improvement of the system to meet the elimination goal. This study therefore aimed to assess the functionality of the rabies surveillance system in Gombe state in Nigeria and to identify the links between surveillance information transmission for early response across the human and animal health sectors. Gombe state, located in the North-Eastern part of Nigeria, is one of Nigeria’s 36 states plus the Federal Capital Territory. This state was selected because of the presence of the World Bank intervention through the Regional Disease Surveillance Systems Enhancement (REDISSE) programme to increase disease surveillance capacity in the animal and human health sectors [33]. Further, there have been numerous informal reports of dog bites and suspected rabies cases, absence of published information on rabies cases and surveillance activities in the state. Also, the heightened insecurity problems intensify the vulnerability of local communities to rabies in the state thereby affecting the choice of intervention strategies employed.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAn assessment of the rabies surveillance system in Gombe State by this study revealed that intersectoral collaboration was actively employed for joint risk assessment for the management of potential rabies exposure cases. This approach of integrative efforts by different sectors has been shown by others [21,22] to provide added value by preventing discrepancies in the number of cases reported, improving case management and increasing worker’s acceptability of the system as compared to when each sector works independently. Several barriers were also identified that undermines the system’s functionality and effectiveness. The major impediments include insufficient funding, inadequate staffing, inadequate training of personnel, lack of infrastructural resources and mobility for surveillance. These challenges mirror those reported for other neglected tropical disease surveillance systems across Africa, in which rabies is a part of [43,44]. These problems might also contribute to possible reasons for the limited effectiveness of surveillance systems in many African countries [45].\n\nA total of 157 potential human exposure to rabies were identified in this study, out of which two people reportedly died at the health facility after showing symptoms highly suggestive of rabies. Furthermore, children ranked highest as victims of dog bites; the victims that died in this study were also children. This finding is similar to other studies conducted in Nigeria [29,46]. This might be attributed to the inability of children to understand hazardous situations that can trigger a bite event and defend themselves in such situations [28,46]. Likewise, children not understanding the risk of dog bites might fail to report such incidents to their parents preventing immediate medical care [13,28]. Hence, there is need for awareness raising among children and parents to enable them to speak out and for parents to seek medical treatments. Testing of biting animals is critical to determine the course of treatment of bite victims and to ensure mass vaccinations of dogs in the vicinity where the bite occurred. Remarkably, in this study, the testing of biting animals for rabies was found to be exceptionally low. The small proportion tested might be attributed to the insufficient workforce to follow-up on quarantined dogs in victim’s houses or the cost associated with transporting the samples to the central laboratory (NVRI). The IFAT testing is done both at the Nigerian Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) and at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria. While testing at NVRI is often done for routine Rabies diagnosis, IFAT tests conducted at ABU, is often conducted for research purposes [29]. Moreover, NVRI is closer to Gombe state compared with ABU for rabies testing. Consequently, it might be necessary to employ more veterinary personnel and provide resources to transport these samples or equip smaller laboratories within the state with test kits to conduct other alternative tests recommended by the WOAH, like the direct rapid immunohistochemical test (dRIT) [47]. A study by Eze and colleagues [48] evaluating the economic feasibility of rabies diagnostic tests also suggested using dRIT in resource-limited settings due to its cost-effectiveness compared with the FAT test used in Gombe state.\n\nThe proportion of vaccination among the biting dogs reported in this study was also low; this might be due to insufficient knowledge about the importance of dog vaccinations or inadequate knowledge of where to find the vaccines or the veterinary clinics where they are administered [49]. The low dog vaccination coverage is relatable with other studies conducted in Nigeria, where the vaccine coverage has been reported to be below the recommended 70% coverage level for effective rabies control [28,46,50].\n\nThe Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC) estimates dog vaccination coverage in Nigeria as 12.29% [51]. Some studies conducted in Nigeria indicate 64% vaccination coverage in Bauchi metropolis [52], a coverage of 41% in urban Kaduna and 9% in rural Kaduna [53]. In this situation where rabies is endemic, and only a few dogs are vaccinated, the risk for human exposure to rabies is exceptionally high. Although, free rabies vaccinations are often provided to dogs to commemorate the world rabies day in many states in Nigeria [54], these programmes are often conducted in urban settings rather than rural settings where dog owners cannot afford the cost of vaccination. Lack of awareness about rabies case reporting in rural communities was described as a factor affecting case detection through the passive surveillance system, as cases remain unreported to the health authorities. Traditional approaches were described to be used regularly by victims after dog bite cases. This might be attributed to lack of knowledge on rabies case management. Traditional approaches often involve slaughtering of the dog, and the use of its part for traditional therapy by local healers. This approach disregards the outlined method for suspected rabies management and poses a threat towards the emergence of a new infection towards the handlers of the dogs tissue [55]. Previous studies in Nigeria have isolated the lyssavirus from dogs in trading markets and illustrated that slaughtering, handling and processing dogs provides avenue for exposure of contact with fluids and nervous tissues of dogs which could transmit the disease if the dog is infected [4,28,55]. Community engagement programmes providing information on rabies, targeting both the peri-urban and rural communities, is essential for increasing knowledge and awareness [56]. Although awareness is promoted annually on the World Rabies Day in the form of outdoor sporting events, mass media and vaccination campaigns [27], these events often do not reach remote areas where the most vulnerable populations at high risk of developing rabies can be found. There is a need to scale-up rabies awareness from one-day annual events to ongoing year-round events with coverage of high-risk populations. Heightened awareness of rabies in rural communities can reduce underreporting and increase the desirability of dog vaccinations since community members have become much more knowledgeable about the disease. For example, a community-based surveillance trial conducted in Kenya demonstrated that community engagement and awareness resulted in a higher rate of case detection by the system [57]. However, another study conducted in Peru indicated that having knowledge on the need to seek health care after potential exposures to rabies did not necessarily translate into any action taken by the victims [58]. Thus, in addition to awareness of the community, decision makers need to consider options that can incentivise the desirable behaviours. For example, providing subsidized or free treatment options for dog bite victims and dog vaccination would likely be helpful, as the inadequate financial capacity of the Nigerian populace might deter the expected progress of increased case detection gained through community engagement programs if 40% of the population still lives below $1.1 per day and find it financially demanding to seek appropriate healthcare [59].\n\nThe passive surveillance system adopted in Gombe state as reported in this study aligns with the results from a survey of the surveillance systems in African countries by Taylor and Knopf [60] who reported rabies surveillance to be ineffective in 16 out of the 23 participating countries due to the use of a passive surveillance system. To address the challenges associated with this passive surveillance, the use of the One Health surveillance approach needs to be strengthened with inter-sectoral collaboration in data collection, analysis and management to inform decision making. This is expected to translate to improved overall efficiency of case detection and management and the generation of co-benefits. For instance, One Health surveillance has been previously implemented in Kyrgyzstan where joint surveillance in livestock and humans formed the basis for the development of intersectoral and cost-effective control [61]. A similar joint surveillance approach has also been reported in Mongolia, the Philippines, and Tanzania [61–63].\n\nThe Integrated Bite Case Management (IBCM), known to have increased rabies case detection in the Philippines, Tanzania and Chad [47,62,63], is a One Health approach for rabies mitigation that links both the veterinary and health sectors to assess the risk of rabies among dog bite victims and the implicated biting animal to ensure optimal treatment. The risk assessment of the IBCM is dependent upon the patients’ ability to present themselves to a health facility following a bite incidence [62]. In a setting like Nigeria where resources targeted at surveillance activities is limited, a potential solution to improve case detection might be to leverage on a free short text messaging system to the central bodies, the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Federal Veterinary Department by dog bite victims or local leaders if bite victims do not have phones. This system could work like this: Once a bite victim sends a text message after a bite incident, the victim receives an auto-generated response in the form of a rabies advisory information on quick actions that can be taken by the victim. It also automatically alerts the veterinary and/or health sector closest to the location of the bite to do a follow-up which will ensure swifter case handling. Such a system could help to increase the number of cases reported and generate a greater understanding of the geographical distribution of bite cases which in turn would inform decisions to conduct mass vaccination and awareness thereby leading to greater overall efficiency and effectiveness of the surveillance system. For this quick messaging system to work, there might be need for incentivizing individuals who successfully use the system to ensure wider acceptability and a need for prompt action by health authorities to ensure confidence of the public in the system. Equally, training of health and veterinary workers in the use of smart phones would be needed to enable the successful use of the technology. Local government health and veterinary sectors collaboration is needed for efficient case handling. Successful real-time information sharing and intersectoral collaboration require political support, funding commitment, and policy implementation for One Health surveillance to enable coordinated case reporting and maximize benefits in rabies surveillance.\n\nThe interviews with key informants allowed developing understanding of the current state of operations and the functionality of the surveillance system. Despite the insights gained, this study has a number of limitations. Firstly, interviews with key informants were conducted via Zoom calls. This approach might have limited informant’s ability to speak freely compared with if the interviews were conducted physically; some interviewees were observed to be apprehensive about talking around certain issues regarding the surveillance system. However, there is a possibility that other participants might have also felt more comfortable expressing themselves since their cameras were switched off during the calls and their faces could not be seen. Secondly, informants might have given biased responses due to the need to portray themselves as being socially desirable in the performance of their duties. The findings from this study were based on one out of six geopolitical regions in Nigeria. Further studies would be needed to explore the functionality and operation of other states within the remaining five geopolitical regions in Nigeria to provide a broader perspective on the strength and weakness of the overall rabies surveillance system in the country."
