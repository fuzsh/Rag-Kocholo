        "text": "Our study showed that laboratory-confirmed mpox was reported across various age groups and populations but was more common among persons who were young adult, male, and mostly urban or semi-urban dwellers. The demographic characteristics of the mpox-positive participants in our study are similar to those of the 2017–2019 mpox outbreak in Nigeria, which also predominantly affected young adult urban dwellers. Most cases of mpox during the 2022 outbreak in Europe and North America were among young adult urban dwellers, mostly GBMSM (6,26). In contrast, only 7.4% of the mpox participants in our study self-reported themselves as GBMSM; MPXV is probably not currently spreading within that particular social group in Nigeria. Another possibility is that cases of mpox in that group have either been overlooked or not accurately reported because GBMSM may avoid seeking clinical assessment because of laws in Nigeria that criminalize same-sex relationships.\n\nThe types of exposure settings reported in our study suggest human-to-human and zoonotic transmissions of MPXV during the 2022 outbreak in Nigeria. We identified independent epidemiologic risk factors for mpox positivity among study participants as having had close contact with a person with confirmed mpox and being in an adult age group. Specific risk factors for mpox among adults were >1 markers of risky sexual behaviors (e.g., multiple sex partners and condomless casual sex), and both sexual and nonsexual close contact with a person with suspected mpox. Among children, independent risk factors for mpox positivity were close contact with a person with confirmed mpox and contact with wild/domestic animals. Besides nonsexual physical contact, it might be postulated that mpox in Nigeria is also partly transmitted via risky sexual behavior among adults who subsequently transmit it to children through close contact. Various studies conducted outside Africa during the 2022 outbreak also identified risk factors for being mpox positive as having had multiple sex partners and other markers of risky sexual behavior (9,11,12,14). Similarly, since 2023, a cluster of clade I strain mpox cases in the DRC was linked to sexual contact, including among GBMSM (21).\n\nStudies conducted mainly outside Africa suggest that ≈80% of mpox patients during the 2022 outbreak had sexual encounters before their diagnosis (4,8), and other studies conducted outside Africa have shown prior sexual activity to be associated with mpox infection among GBMSM and among heterosexual adults (27,28). The role of sexual contact and sexual behavior in the transmission of mpox was first proposed during the 2017–2019 mpox outbreak in Nigeria (16,17). A single-center study conducted during the 2022 outbreak in Nigeria reported mpox among linked heterosexual partners, suggesting a relationship between prior sexual contact and mpox infection in Nigeria (29). Our study, which was conducted on a national scale in Nigeria, corroborates the prior observations and supports a role of sexual activity in transmission of the MPXV among adults during the 2022 mpox outbreak in Nigeria.\n\nWith regard to animal exposure being independently associated with mpox positivity among children and not adults, it is plausible but not confirmatory that zoonotic transmission of MPXV in Nigeria is more common among children than adults. However, the large confidence interval of the OR related to animal exposure suggests uncertainty of that finding.\n\nIn our study, 18% of participants with available HIV test results had positive results, and odds of being mpox positive were 5 times higher among PLHIV than among those without HIV. During the 2022 global outbreak, 30%–50% of mpox-positive persons were PLHIV (30); various studies, including reports from Nigeria, have shown that those with advanced HIV have more severe disease and higher death rates than their HIV-negative counterparts (31). A review of 86 confirmed mpox cases during the 2017–2019 mpox outbreak showed that persons with mpox were ≈7 times more likely to be living with HIV than were those without mpox (32). Because of missing HIV test data, we cannot make definitive conclusions regarding HIV as an independent risk factor for mpox in Nigeria during the 2022 mpox outbreak. Even so, HIV and mpox are both sexually transmitted infections, which makes it plausible that risky sexual behavior might be a common factor for acquisition and further transmission of mpox.\n\nApproximately half of the mpox-negative participants in our study were VZV positive, and ≈36% of mpox-positive participants also had a VZV-positive test result. We previously reported VZV co-infection to be independently associated with severe mpox during the 2022 mpox in Nigeria (23). The high prevalence of VZV co-infection among mpox-positive and mpox-negative participants reflects the endemicity of chickenpox, herpes zoster infection, or both in Nigeria and underscores that those VZV-related conditions are the main differential diagnoses for mpox in Nigeria. Of note, VZV co-infection was associated with higher odds of mpox among children but lower odds among adults. The reasons for the contrasting findings are not obvious from our study data. Because we did not distinguish chickenpox from reactivated herpes zoster virus infection in all participants, we could not classify the prevalence of those VZV-related conditions in relation to age, if any. Furthermore, we did not include VZV in the multivariate analysis because of a substantial amount of missing data, and as such, we could not confirm whether our findings were truly reflective of an age-related difference in the associations between VZV and mpox infections or if they resulted from the effects of another confounder. On the basis of the high rates of VZV-mpox co-infections observed from prior studies of mainly the clade I virus (33,34), it has been proposed but not confirmed that a breach in the skin caused by VZV lesions could increase the likelihood of transmission of MPXV and that MPXV may directly trigger VZV reactivation, resulting in herpes zoster virus infection (34,35).\n\nThe major limitations of our study are associated with recruitment of hospital-associated cases only, which could have led to underascertainment of mild mpox-positive cases and mpox-negative suspected cases in the community and missing data related to VZV and HIV co-infections among some participants, which precluded inclusion of these variables for multivariate analysis. The predominance of moderate to severe cases could also bias our study toward HIV-positive participants, given that they are more likely to have severe illness and thus need to seek care at or get admitted into healthcare facilities. We did not determine virus clades in our study, but prior epidemiologic data suggest that the 2022 mpox outbreak in Nigeria probably resulted from the MPXV clade IIb strain (36,37).\n\nIn conclusion, our study reveals that mpox primarily affects adults in Nigeria, often associated with sexual transmission, and that among children affected by mpox, the prominent drivers are animal contact and VZV infection. Our findings emphasize the value of addressing both sexual and nonsexual transmission routes in public health efforts to control the spread of mpox in Nigeria."
