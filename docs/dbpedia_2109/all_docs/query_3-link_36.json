        "text": "USAID is helping Afghanistan become a more responsible and integrated member of the region and the world. Great strides have been made in health and education, bringing more Afghans back into economic and civic life.\n\nInstitutions that can accountably respond to people’s needs and aspirations are being restored. Investments in infrastructure and human capital are making the country less vulnerable to insurgents and illicit business and more attractive for private-sector enterprise.\n\nAngola's low level of human development is at odds with its potential for economic prosperity, considering the country's wealth of natural resources. Much of this paradox is explained by the social disruption and physical destruction caused by 27 years of civil war. As sub-Saharan Africa's second largest oil producer and with its tremendous agricultural potential, the country could become a powerhouse for regional trade and investment. USAID focuses on strengthening good governance, increasing economic opportunity, and improving the delivery of social services.\n\nAsia is home to more than half of the world’s population and is the planet’s most dynamic and fastest-growing region. How Asia develops in the coming years will directly impact our security and prosperity.\n\nMany Asian countries have made tremendous progress toward meeting development goals; however, ensuring economic prosperity and security across borders remain a challenge. USAID’s Bangkok-based Regional Development Mission for Asia (RDMA) works to address key transnational challenges.\n\nPolitical, economic, and health reforms mutually reinforce the strategic goals of the U.S. and Azerbaijan Governments.\n\nUSAID programs in democracy and governance target efforts to increase institutional transparency in the Parliament and enhance its capacity to address civil society concerns. The programs also seek to advance the rule of law and provide legal advice for citizens opposed to corruption.\n\nEconomic growth programs aim to improve the development of the non-oil sector, with an emphasis on helping the agriculture sector to increase export competitiveness.\n\nBangladesh is a key U.S. strategic partner in South Asia and shares a strong friendship driven by common interests. Yet, with nearly one in three people living in poverty, the country faces immense development challenges and today finds itself at an important crossroads in its democratic evolution. The United States is helping address the underlying factors that threaten Bangladesh’s progress and stability by supporting the country’s continued development.\n\nThe United States seeks to promote the emergence of a democratic and market-oriented Belarus that respects human rights. USAID works with a cross-section of the population to stimulate the country’s transition to a market-based economy through programs that support citizen engagement in decision-making, encourage growth and competitiveness of private business, and improve social and health services’ delivery.\n\nBenin is a stable and peaceful country that has maintained more than two decades of democratic governance. The country’s refurbished port, increased investments in infrastructure, and sustained economic growth rate of around 5.5% underscore its potential to move in the right direction. However, the country continues to face many of the same challenges related to endemic poverty that affects countries in the region. Benin ranks 166 out of 187 countries on the Human Development Index, and more than a third of the population lives in poverty. Nearly half of all Beninese children under five years old are stunted due to malnutrition. Regional disparities also remain a challenge, as does worrying levels of corruption that impede the flow of services to citizens.\n\nBrazil, the fifth largest country in the world and the largest in Latin America, has become a great economic power. The country has significantly reduced poverty and unemployment rates. It has diminished its dependence on external resources and is now a major partner in national and international development efforts. Nationally, Brazil continues to address rural poverty, income inequality, and social exclusion.\n\nFor more than 50 years, USAID has supported Brazil. Today, USAID works closely with the Brazilian government and civil society to build sustainable socio-economic development solutions.\n\nBurkina Faso and Niger are the focus countries for our resilience agenda in the Sahel. We coordinate all of our programs with the Government of Burkina Faso, other donors—particularly G7 member countries under the New Alliance for Nutrition and Food Security—and regional organizations such as the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\n\nUSAID builds the resilience of vulnerable rural residents by:\n\nBurma has embarked on what will be a long and challenging road of democratic and economic reform. Political reforms that started in 2011 have set in motion critical transitions in Burma: moving toward an inclusive, parliamentary democracy; negotiating ceasefires after decades-long civil wars; and shifting to a market-oriented economy. Although the process is not complete and there will be challenges, the United States remains committed to improving the welfare and well-being of the people of Burma.\n\nBurundi remains one of the least developed countries in the world with alarming levels of hunger and malnutrition. According to the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization, more than 40 percent of Burundi’s population is facing chronic or acute food insecurity, including 2.3 million who are severely food insecure. This is exacerbated by an economic crisis, which was triggered by the political crisis of 2015.\n\nCambodia is in its third decade of peace and economic growth and has made great strides in reducing poverty and improving health. Despite these gains, significant obstacles remain. Democracy and human rights continue to be a challenge, natural resources have been rapidly depleted through illegal logging and poaching, inadequate nutrition has stunted over 30 percent of children and human trafficking persists.\n\nThe United States works with Cambodia to build a framework for lasting democracy and to improve the lives of all its citizens.\n\nUSAID programs in Cameroon further our global mission of partnering to end extreme poverty and promote resilient, democratic societies while advancing our mutual prosperity. The republic is dominated by a strong central government and a longstanding president. Human rights problems persist despite some improvement. However, economic success has not sufficiently raised the health levels of the population: life expectancy, under-5 mortality, and maternal mortality are worse than the regional average.\n\nThe Congo Basin is the second largest tropical rainforest in the world. It holds spectacular and rare biodiversity and serves as a massive carbon sink for greenhouse gases. It is also the source of food, shelter and livelihoods for approximately 60 million people who live in the region.\n\nStretching from China in the east to the Caspian Sea in the west, the countries of Central Asia have a population of more than 65 million and represent a wide diversity of ethnic groups, languages and clans. The physical landscape is dramatic, ranging from vast steppes to high, rugged mountains, formidable deserts to large rivers, lakes and seas."
