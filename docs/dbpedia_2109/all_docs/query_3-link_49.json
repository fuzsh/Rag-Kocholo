        "text": "Regional overview and outlook\n\nHydropower is the backbone of Africaâs electricity supply, providing 40% of power in the Sub-Saharan region. However, almost 90% of potential remains untapped, the largest proportion of unexploited capacity in the world. As the energy demand increases, unlocking hydropower potential will be crucial to support Africaâs energy sector expansion and to reach net zero targets. In 2023, 2GW of hydropower capacity was installed, increasing the continentâs total to 42GW. This progress is lagging far behind what is needed to meet energy goals. Hydropower development is slow amid persistent regulatory and market issues, causing a backlog of projects that have permission but have not entered construction. These challenges can lead to delays, or even cancellation, with direct impacts on decarbonisation efforts. Private investment is playing a pivotal role in advancing hydropower projects across the continent.\n\nIndependent Power Producers (IPPs) are injecting capital and expertise into the sector. For instance, in Nigeria, the commissioning of a 40MW hydroelectric power station in Gombe state developed by Mabon Energy, showcases this trend. Similarly, GE Vernova's successful completion of four 175MW Francis hydropower turbines at Mainstream Energyâs Zungeru project in Nigeria illustrates the impact of private investment in scaling up hydropower generation. Partnerships between public and private entities are also facilitating the financing and development of major hydropower projects. The Mpanda hydroelectric project, a publicâprivate partnership between the Burundian government and Mpanda Hydro Power, aims to construct a 10MW power station and interconnection infrastructure, envisioned to supply 10% of Burundi's electricity. At COP28, Executive Vice President of the European Commission MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ announced Team Europe's pledge of over â¬20 billion for the AfricaâEU Green Energy Initiative (AEGEI), emphasising its aim to improve access to sustainable energy in Africa and promote renewable energy generation and energy efficiency. In 2023, â¬37 million was pledged in hydropower and solar projects in Nigeria.\n\nRegional cooperation is improving through power pools and shared grids, enhancing resource utilisation. Angola, currently a non-operating member of the Southern African Power Pool, plans to connect via the 600MW Baynes Dam project with Namibia, each sharing 300MW with Power Africa's support. Additionally, a northern connection with the Democratic Republic of the Congo via the Inga Dam is being considered. These projects highlight the mutual benefits and economic integration from such partnerships.\n\nThe African Development Bank (AfDB) and the International Hydropower Association (IHA) published the Africa Hydropower Modernisation Programme Report in June 2023, which presents a continent-wide mapping of hydropower facilities eligible for modernisation. Of the 87 stations assessed, 21 plants (4.6GW, 12% of Africaâs hydropower capacity) were deemed in urgent need of modernisation, all in Sub-Saharan Africa. Another 31 plants (10.1GW, 26% of capacity) will likely need investment in the next decade. To secure reliable, efficient, and safe electricity generation from the high need category, IHA estimates that approximately US$2.1 billion will need to be invested. Responding to these findings, the AfDB is leading efforts to upgrade 12 hydropower plants with a US$1 billion investment. These refurbishments, spanning various countries and projects, aim to address immediate capacity needs and ensure sustainable energy development. Improving resilience to climate change and enhancing regulatory frameworks can unlock additional investment and promote market competitiveness. By addressing these challenges and capitalising on opportunities, Africa's hydropower sector can continue to grow sustainably, meeting the region's energy needs while fostering economic prosperity.\n\nÂ\n\nâ\n\nPolicy and market overview\n\nThe power sector in Africa faces numerous barriers that are hindering its growth and sustainability. Regulatory issues impede private sector participation and investment. Despite efforts to establish independent regulators, enforcement capacity remains insufficient, leading to uncertainty and disputes. State-owned utilities struggle with revenue collection due to non-payment, theft and billing inefficiencies, deterring private investment, and hindering infrastructure expansion.\n\nOff-taker creditworthiness presents another challenge, complicating project financing and causing delays. Limited access to finance, currency volatility and governance issues further inhibit infrastructure development. The escalating deployment of variable renewables like wind and solar requires innovative storage Africa and flexibility solutions for grid stability, which hydropower can play a unique role in fulfilling, but inadequate infrastructure and technological constraints are hampering progress.\n\nClimate change exacerbates these challenges, increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Incorporating climate adaptation measures into energy planning is essential for infrastructure resilience. Additionally, energy security is jeopardised by heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, exposing nations to global market volatility. Transitioning to sustainable, domestically sourced energy is vital for Africaâs long-term security and economic stability.\n\nâ\n\nCase Study: Africa Hydropower Modernisation Programme\n\nContinent-wide mapping of hydropower modernisation needs. In Africa, nearly 50 per cent of installed hydropower capacity is over 40 years old, and 60 per cent is over 30 years old. As part of its Africa Hydropower Modernisation Programme, the AfDB commissioned IHA to map the status of existing hydropower plants in the continent and identify assets needing modernisation. IHA investigated the conditions of 87 hydropower projects across Africa, using surveys and follow-up interviews with the operators and owners to provide a holistic idea of the development opportunities across the continent. Â\n\nModernisation projects across the continent were categorised based on varying degrees of rehabilitation need: low, medium and high.\n\nThe study concluded that 66 plants out of 87 identified are in medium and high need of modernisation, of which 30 currently require urgent intervention. Modernising the existing fleet will help secure the availability of over 14.7 GW installed capacity, increase project flexibility, reduce maintenance costs, enhance water management, and enable safer operations, all while being less cost-intensive than developing green field projects. Â\n\nIHA estimated that to secure reliable, efficient and safe electricity generation from the plants in the high-need category, approximately US$2.1bn will need to be invested. As for the medium-need projects, US$4.7bn investment will be required. Â\n\nAs part of the Africa Hydropower Modernisation Programme, the AfDB is currently finalising the selection of projects that it will support by providing grant funding for relatively simple rehabilitation activities as well as funding for studies required to identify detailed scope and cost of more complex modernisation projects.\n\nThe report's public version will be released on 22 June 2023 and available for download from www.ahmpafrica.org.\n\nâ"
