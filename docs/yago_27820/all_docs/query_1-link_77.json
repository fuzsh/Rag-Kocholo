        "text": "Sophia of Nassau (christened Sophia Wilhelmine Marianne Henriette) was born on July 9, 1836. She was the youngest daughter of Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau, (1792-1839) and his second wife Princess Pauline Friederike Marie of Württemberg (1810-1856). Sophia was Queen of Sweden and Norway as the wife of King Oscar II (1829-1907). She was queen for 35 years, from 1872 until 1907, making her the longest-serving queen of Sweden until Queen Silvia surpassed her record in 2011. She is also the most recent woman to have been officially styled Dowager Queen of Sweden.\n\nSophia of Nassau with Prince Oscar at the time of their marriage in 1857.\n\nImage from Wikimedia Commons\n\nAt a young age, Sophia received a somewhat liberal upbringing. In fact, the court of Nassau was considered as the most democratic among the German principalities. Sophia trained in fencing to strengthen her back and correct her posture and she also learned the English language early on. Her brothers eventually referred to her as Unsere demokratische Schwester (our democratic sister). Sophia eventually developed into a serious, intelligent and dutiful but genuinely religious individual.\n\nSophia of Nassau, now Duchess of Östergötland, standing second from left,\n\nwith the Royal House of Bernadotte, c1857. Other members of the family\n\nare as follows: (standing from left to right) Prince August, future\n\nKing Oscar, Crown Prince Karl, and Princess Eugénie.\n\nSitting, from left: Queen Josephine, King Oscar I,\n\nPrincess Louise, and Crown Princess Louise .\n\nQueen Sophia of Sweden during her coronation in 1873.\n\nImage from Wikimedia Commons.\n\nIn September 1856, she was engaged to Prince Oscar of Sweden, Duke of Östergötland, the third son of King Oscar I of Sweden. At the time, Prince Oscar was second in line to the throne of Sweden. Sophia and Oscar were married on June 6, 1857 at the Castle in Wiesbaden-Biebrich, much to the enthusiasm of the Swedes.\n\nSophia’s calm and controlled manner endeared her to her parents-in-law and her sister-in-law princess Eugenie. However, she had a tense relationship with Charles XV and Queen Louise. With the death of King Charlex XV, Oscar succeeded to the throne on September 18, 1872, making Sophia the queen consort of Sweden and Norway.\n\nQueen Sophia of Sweden, c1870s.

Image from Wikimedia Commons\n\nPolitically, Sophia has been described as liberal and almost democratic, she worked hard to improve the country’s medical care, and even founded the first nursing school in Sweden. She became queen dowager in 1907 after the death of King Oscar II. She, nevertheless, continued to spend her time traveling and her last years were spent in philanthropy and in the Sophiahemmet, a hospital and school for nurses.\n\nQueen Sophia, c1902.

Until her death on December 30, 1913, she was highly respected by the Swedes."
