        "text": "King of Sweden and Norway from 1859 to 1872\n\nCharles XV or Carl (Carl Ludvig Eugen; Swedish and Norwegian officially: Karl; 3 May 1826 â€“ 18 September 1872) was King of Sweden and Norway, there often referred to as Charles IV, from 8 July 1859 until his death in 1872. Charles was the third Swedish monarch from the House of Bernadotte. He was the first one to be born in Sweden, and the first to be raised from birth in the Lutheran faith.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe was born in Stockholm Palace, Stockholm, in 1826 and dubbed Duke of Scania at birth. Born the eldest son of Crown Prince Oscar of Sweden and his wife Crown Princess Josephine, he would be second in line to the throne of his grandfather, the ruling King Charles XIV John of Sweden. During his childhood he was placed in the care of the royal governess, Countess Christina Ulrika Taube.[1] When he was just 15, he was given his first officer's commission in 1841 by his grandfather the king.\n\nCrown Prince\n\n[edit]\n\nThe aging King Charles XIV John would suffer a stroke on his 81st birthday in 1844, dying little more than a month later. His successor would be his son, Charles's father Oscar, who ascended the throne as King Oscar I of Sweden. Upon his father's accession to the throne in 1844, the youth Charles was made a chancellor of the universities of Uppsala and Lund, and in 1853 chancellor of Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. On 11 February 1846, he was made an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2]\n\nThe Crown Prince was Viceroy of Norway briefly in 1856 and 1857. He became Regent on 25 September 1857, and king on the death of his father on 8 July 1859.[3] As grandson of Augusta of Bavaria, he was a descendant of Gustav I of Sweden and Charles IX of Sweden, whose Vasa blood returned to the throne after being lost in 1818 when Charles XIII of Sweden died.\n\nOn 19 June 1850, he married in Stockholm Louise of the Netherlands, niece of William II of the Netherlands through her father and niece of William I of Prussia, German Emperor, through her mother. The couple was personally quite dissimilar; Louise was a cultured and refined woman, however, she was considered to be quite plain and Charles was disappointed with her appearance. Louise was in love with her husband, whereas he preferred other women, saddening her deeply. His well-known mistresses included the actress Laura BergnÃ©hr, the countess Josephine Sparre, Wilhelmine SchrÃ¶der and the actresses Hanna Styrell and Elise Hwasser, and the Crown Prince neglected his shy wife. On the other hand, his relationship to his only daughter, Louise, was warm and close.[4]\n\nReign\n\n[edit]\n\nAs Crown Prince, Charles's brusque manner had led many to regard his future accession with some apprehension, yet he proved to be one of the most popular of Scandinavian kings and a constitutional ruler in the best sense of the word. His reign was remarkable for its manifold and far-reaching reforms. Sweden's existing municipal law (1862), ecclesiastical law (1863) and criminal law (1864) were enacted appropriately enough under the direction of a king whose motto was: Land skall med lag byggas â€“ \"With law shall the land be built\".[3] Charles also helped Louis De Geer to carry through his reform of the Parliament of Sweden in 1866. He also declared the freedom of women by passing the law of legal majority for unmarried women in 1858 â€“ his sister Princess Eugenie became the first woman who was declared mature.[5]\n\nThough known as King Charles XV in Sweden (and also on contemporary Norwegian coins[6]), he was actually the ninth Swedish king by that name, as his predecessor Charles IX (reigned 1604â€“1611) had adopted a numeral according to a fictitious history of Sweden.[7]\n\nCharles, like his father Oscar I, was an advocate of Scandinavianism and the political solidarity of the three northern kingdoms, and his friendship with Frederick VII of Denmark, it is said, led him to give half promises of help to Denmark on the eve of the war of 1864, which, in the circumstances, were perhaps misleading and unjustifiable. In view, however, of the unpreparedness of the Swedish army and the difficulties of the situation, Charles was forced to observe a strict neutrality.[3] On behalf of Charles, Dirk de Graeff van Polsbroek, Dutch diplomat in Japan, concluded a \"VÃ¤nskaps-, handels- och sjÃ¶fartstraktat\" (\"Friendship, Trade and Maritime Treaty\") between Sweden-Norway and Japan on 11 November 1868 (see the Treaty of Yokohama). The treaty opened Hakodate, Yokohama, Nagasaki, Kobe and Osaka to trade for Swedish and Norwegian traders (Article 3). The treaty also gave Sweden-Norway the opportunity to send consuls to the newly opened ports, where they were given the right to exercise jurisdiction over Swedes and Norwegians (consular jurisdiction).[8] Charles died in MalmÃ¶ on 18 September 1872.[9]\n\nCharles XV attained some eminence as a painter[3] and as a poet. He was followed on the thrones of both Norway and Sweden by his brother Oscar II.\n\nIn 1872, Charles XV had controversial plans to enter a non-morganatic marriage with the Polish countess Maria Beatrix KrasiÅ„ska through the assistance of Ohan Demirgian, plans that aroused opposition both in the Royal house and Government and which were interrupted only by his death.[10]\n\nCharles's popularity often had him referred to colloquially as \"Kron-Kalle\" (Crown-Charlie).[11]\n\nIssue\n\n[edit]\n\nBy his wife, Louise of the Netherlands, Charles had two children, a son who died in infancy and a daughter who married the King of Denmark. The early death of Charles's only legitimate son meant that he was succeeded on the thrones of Sweden and Norway by his younger brother Oscar II.\n\nName Birth Death Notes Louise Josephine Eugenie 31 October 1851 21 March 1926 married, 1869, Frederik VIII of Denmark; had issue (including Christian X of Denmark and Haakon VII of Norway). Carl Oscar Vilhelm Frederik 14 December 1852 13 March 1854 died in infancy of pneumonia.\n\nCharles also sired an illegitimate son, Carl Johan Bolander, (4 February 1854 â€“ 28 July 1903), the father of Bishop Nils Bolander,[12] and daughter, Ellen Svensson Hammar (28 October 1865 â€“ 1931), and it has been widely rumored that Charles had many more extramarital children.[13]\n\nA few weeks before Charles's death, his daughter Louise (then Crown Princess of Denmark) gave birth to her second son, Prince Carl of Denmark. In 1905, Prince Carl ascended to the throne of Norway with the regnal name Haakon VII, thus becoming Charles's successor in that country.[14]\n\nNo subsequent king of Sweden to this day is Charles's descendant. However, his descendants are on the thrones of Denmark, Luxembourg, Belgium and Norway.\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nNational decorations[15]\n\nKnight and Commander of the Seraphim, with Collar, 3 May 1826\n\nKnight of the Order of Charles XIII, 3 May 1826\n\nCommander Grand Cross of the Sword, 3 May 1826\n\nCommander Grand Cross of the Polar Star, 3 May 1826\n\nGrand Cross of St. Olav, with Collar, 3 May 1826\n\nForeign decorations[15]\n\nArms\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince of Sweden and Norway,\n\nDuke of Scania (1826â€“1844)\n\nCrown Prince of Sweden and Norway,\n\nDuke of Scania (1844â€“1859)\n\nKing Charles XV of Sweden\n\nand Norway\n\nMonogram of King Charles XV\n\nof Sweden\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Royal Norwegian Order of St Olav â€“ Norwegian and Swedish Monarchs Grand Masters of the Order\n\nFamily tree of the Royal Norwegian House\n\nKings of Norway (in Norwegian)\n\nMuch material on early kings (in Norwegian)\n\n\"Charles XV.\" .
