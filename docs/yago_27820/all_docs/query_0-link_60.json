        "text": "Queen Louise of Denmark, c1893. Image under Creative Commons license.\n\nIn the Life of Queen Alexandra, author Sarah A. Southall Tooley describes Queen Louise as one “clever and accomplished” woman, who “was an excellent musician (playing both the piano and harp), could converse fluently in French and German, and had some knowledge of English.”\n\nTooley continues:\n\n“She drew and painted, and the walls of the Gule Palais [Roskilde Royal Mansion or Yellow Mansion] were hung with her sketches, while in common with the Danish ladies she worked exquisitely in silk embroidery. To these graceful accomplishments the Princess Louise added a thorough knowledge of housewifery, and was an expert needlewoman.\n\nThe queen was also described as one who possessed wit, “…faculty, discrimination, and tact, and this quality, which in the early years of her married life made her such an excellent wife and mother, rendered her a most helpful Consort to Prince Christian when he ascended the throne.\n\nThen-Prince and Princess Christian of Denmark in the 1840s.\n\nAs queen and mother to her six children (future Frederick VIII of Denmark, future Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom, future King George I of Greece, Dagmar, later Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia, Thyra, future Crown Princess of Hanover, and Prince Valdemar), Queen Louise was “very charming and remarkable.” No doubt her “will readily admit that neither of them has inherited all her gifts, which appear, indeed, to have been divided amongst them.”\n\nFrom Queen Louise, Alexandra inherited her “mother's taste for music, her strong maternal instincts, and excelled her in beauty.” Dagmar, meanwhile, received “more of her faculty and intellectual gifts. Thyra “resembled her most in charm of manner and love of home-life.” All these traits became evident to her daughters because of Queen Louise’s dedication to train her children “to be perfectly delightful in behavior.” Tooley also writes that when the family later visited relatives, the host would reference their guests with respectful remark as, \"Aunt Louise and her charming children are here.\"\n\nKing Christian IX, Queen Louise of Denmark and children, 1862.
