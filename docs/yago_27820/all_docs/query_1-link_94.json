        "text": "Louise of Sweden (Louise Josephine Eugenie ; 31 October 1851 – 20 March 1926) was Queen of Denmark from 1906 until 1912 as the spouse of King Frederick VIII.\n\nBorn into the House of Bernadotte, she was the only surviving child of King Charles XV of Sweden and Norway and his consort, Louise of the Netherlands. Although her father made several attempts to have her recognized as his heir, she was barred from the succession as at the time only males could ascend the throne of Sweden. In 1869, she married the future King Frederick VIII of Denmark with whom she had eight children. Louise became Queen of Denmark in 1906. As Queen, she was mainly known for her many charity projects, an interest that she shared with her spouse.

After a short tenure as Queen, she was widowed in 1912.\n\nLouise was the mother of both King Christian X of Denmark and King Haakon VII of Norway.\n\nSol turns thousands of years of human wisdom from the world’s spiritual traditions into a totally unique personality profile.
