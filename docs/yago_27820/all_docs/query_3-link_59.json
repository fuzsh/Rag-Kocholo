        "text": "May 12 in Swedish History\n\n1873: Oscar II is crowned in Storkyrkan, Stockholm. It is a mere eight months after the first Nordstjernan-Interactive from the start was printed in September, 1872.\n\nKing Oscar thus becomes the last Swedish regent to be crowned, as his successor Gustav V refrains from a coronation, thereby creating a new Swedish tradition. Oscar was born in 1829, the third son of King Oscar I of Sweden and Josephine of Leuchtenberg. Through his mother, he was a descendent of Gustav Vasa. In 1957, he married Princess Sophia Wilhelmina, and the couple had four children: King Gustaf V, Prince Oscar, Prince Carl and Prince Eug√®n. The king allegedly also had several extramarital children, among them popular actress Anna Hoffman-Uddgren. King Oscar II died in 1907."
