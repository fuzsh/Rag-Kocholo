        "text": "Some information I found on Alexanderpalace forums about King Karl, I adapted the information a bit for TRF:\n\nAfter the death of Queen Lovisa King Karl XV had an affair with countess Maria Krasińska (1847-1912). She later married twice. Her first husband was a Polish count, and the second one was a Czech count. She was considered to be very beautiful as well as very rich. The marriage plans between Karl and countess Krasińska made Karl's brother Oscar furious, as he saw his position as heir to the throne threatened, and the two brothers even quarrelled in public about it.\n\nApparently preparations were taken to make countess Krasińska \"good enough\", and it seems like Karl had the plan to marry her on equal forms. If the marriage would have been made equal, then the countess would have become queen. The children from this marriage would then have been rightful heirs to the throne. For a man as ambitious as Oscar this possible future must have looked just dreadful - no wonder he was furious! What would he have been if Karl had had sons - a younger son with no chance of inheriting the throne. And Oscar always believed that he would be a much better king than Karl, an opinion deeply shared by his (their) mother, queen Joséphine.\n\nApparently Karl had a friend in king Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy. I have read somewhere, but I do no remember where - - that Vittorio Emanuele offered to adopt countess Maria Krasińska. This would apparently have elevated her status enough to make the marriage equal. I am not sure that I believe that this is entirely true, but I guess it could be. I do not know very much about how adoptions in royal circles worked almost 150 years ago.\n\nBut instead of marrying countess Krasińska and have children by her, Karl got sick and died. And Oscar had his longlived dream fulfilled - he became king.\n\nSome more information on Queen Louisa/Lovisa, information taken from 'Oranje-Nasau, Een biografisch woordenboek' by Reinildis van Ditzhuyzen.\n\nLouise enjoys a very sheltered upbringing in Wassenaar and grows up to a not especially attractive but a sweetnatured and obedient young woman. Queen Sophie of The Netherlands describes her as 'girly, clumsy and usually badly dressed'. After Louise's engagement to Carl of Sweden she dedicates herself to learning the Swedish language and culture, so when she arrived in Sweden she was able to express her thanks during the official reception in Swedish. Her life as Crownprincess Lovisa would be rather dull. She spends a lot of time at Ulriksdal where she writes a lot and reads a lot, especially memoires and Dutch newspapers. She also is dedicated to the fashionable 'illuminating', which is the colouring of religious drawings.\n\nDue to her dislike of public duties and her shy character people judge her as haughty and she isn't very popular in Sweden. Her husband Carl on the other hand is the darling of the Swedish public, due to his charm and good looks. He however has a hot temprament and allows little critisism and shows little tact. He has a lot of love affairs and shows that he is like his father, whose bastardchildren are mockingly called 'Princes of Lapland'.\n\nLovisa gets two children from Carl, a daughter named Lovisa (Sessa) was born in 1851 and in 1852 she gets a son who sadly dies after 15 months. Sessa is raised in a very strict manner and in loneliness. She isn't allowed to play with other children. In 1859 King Oscar I dies and Carl becomes King Carl XV of Sweden and Norway. This means more official duties for Lovisa who reluctantly has to participate in them. She sometimes makes a journey through the country and during these journeys she usually stays at the houses of courtiers. Many of the courtiers didn't feel particularly honoured by such a visit but instead were annoyed that their daily routines had to be changed and the costs that such a visit meant to them didn't make it overly popular either. Lovisa did do a lot for charity, she founded for example the Lovisa children hospital in Stockholm.\n\nIn 1869 Queen Lovisa travels to her parents (Prince Frederik and Princess Louise of The Netherlands) who are at their Schloss Muskau in Silezia. She travels with her daughter Lovisa and Lovisa's fiancee Crownprince Frederik of Denmark (later King Frederik VIII).\n\nThe sickly Queen gets a heavy cold in 1871 that became an ammonia, shortly afterwards she dies at the Royal Palace in Stockholm, only aged 42. Even after her death she remains an unknown woman, in the few Swedish articles that are around about her, she is characterised as a simple, competent, hard working woman but colourless, both in appearance as in her temprament. The humiliated, belittled, often ridiculed Lovisa, who loved her unfaithful husband so deeply (a love not returned), is the ancestress of four of the reigning monarchs in Europe today\n\nTwo pictures, found at worldroots of Birgitte:\n\nInformation on the marriage that I found on the Alexanderpalace forum and adapted for use here:\n\nAbout a first marriage candidate for Prince Karl:\n\nQueen Josefina was a good friend of the princess Louise of Prussia's uncle and aunt, the King and Queen of Prussia and they all thought that Karl and Louise would match together. However when Karl (and his brother Gustav) went to Berlin together in 1847 Karl didn´t like the princess at all and all hopes for a wedding were gone. An illness of Louise was the offical reason that the negotiations between Stockholm and Berlin were broken off. Karl´s sister Eugénie was greatly upset by Karl´s behaviour as she had taken a great fancy on her sister-in-law to-be and so was also Prince Gustav who told one of his friends that he himself wanted to marry Louise after her recovery even if she might not give him any children (it seems that one believed that infertility might be a result of her illness. As history shows it was not as Louise had three children with her Grand Duke of whom the daughter Victoria became Queen of Sweden...).\n\nAbout Karl´s engagement to Louisa:\n\nLouise of The Netherlands was not really regarded as a especially good party for a king-to-be, she was not the daughter of a king, only the niece of one. One of the main reasons why Karl (and the Bernadottes at that time) wanted to marry Lovisa (Louise) was that he/they thought that she was very rich and/or would receive a huge dowry from her father. However this initially was not the case, which Karl only found out when the marriage negotiations had already went quite far. The Bernadottes, as a parvenu dynasty, could not afford the scandal that would come if the engagement was broken, and so Karl married Lovisa. The economical issue was only settled some time after the marriage.\n\nAbout a first marriage candidate for Prince Karl:\n\nQueen Josefina was a good friend of the princess Louise of Prussia's uncle and aunt, the King and Queen of Prussia and they all thought that Karl and Louise would match together. However when Karl (and his brother Gustav) went to Berlin together in 1847 Karl didn´t like the princess at all and all hopes for a wedding were gone. An illness of Louise was the offical reason that the negotiations between Stockholm and Berlin were broken off. Karl´s sister Eugénie was greatly upset by Karl´s behaviour as she had taken a great fancy on her sister-in-law to-be and so was also Prince Gustav who told one of his friends that he himself wanted to marry Louise after her recovery even if she might not give him any children (it seems that one believed that infertility might be a result of her illness. As history shows it was not as Louise had three children with her Grand Duke of whom the daughter Victoria became Queen of Sweden...).\n\nSo the Louise of Prussia, who was Carl XV:s fiancée, was the same Louise of Prussia, who became the mother of Victoria of Baden? But I thought Victoria's grandfather was the emperor of Germany?"
