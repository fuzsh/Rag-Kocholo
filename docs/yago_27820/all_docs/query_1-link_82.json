        "text": "Hello, Why Karl VII - XV, but Carl XVI?\n\nThere is a rule in Scandinavian historiography that a monarch's name is written in its original form while he/she is alive, but according to the country's (for example Norway's) traditional spelling when he is dead. ( I presume that Karl VII is from a Norwegian publication).\n\nSome examples: prince Charles (living) > prins Karl (after his death), prince Jean > fyrst Jan, kong Baudouin > kong Baldvin.\n\nSorry, I forgot it's not \"Swedish Only\". Actually I meant exactly Swedish kings.\n\nCarl XVI, now alive, is the only Swedish king who is spelled Carl in Swedish. Is this spelling traditional or historical? All his predecessors were spelled Karls in Swedish.\n\nThis table shows that other Karls became Carls in the middle of the 19th century (starting with Prince Carl Oskar).\n\nWhy?\n\nUntil mid/late 19th century the letter C was uncommon on it's own in the Swedish language, it was only used in the combination -ck. I would guess that the use of C in names was a way to make the names more \"international\", you can see that there are other names in the table that are spelled with C-, -c-, W- or -th- (Carl, Oscar, Wilhelm, Margaretha, MÃ¤rtha) for people born after about 1850, before that the names would have been spelled with just a K-, V- or -t-. Today it's more popular to spell the name Karl as Carl and the name Oskar as Oscar, Viktoria as Victoria, Lovisa as Louise and so on.\n\nThere is a rule in Scandinavian historiography that a monarch's name is written in its original form while he/she is alive, but according to the country's (for example Norway's) traditional spelling when he is dead. ( I presume that Karl VII is from a Norwegian publication).\n\nI think that's a Norwegian rule, not a Scandinavian one. At least Danish doesn't have it (e.g. all of our past Christians are spelled with a C), I don't know about Swedish. Karl VII is also spelled with a K on Swedish Wikipedia, so I don't think there's any reason to believe the source is Norwegian.\n\nI think that's a Norwegian rule, not a Scandinavian one. At least Danish doesn't have it (e.g. all of our past Christians are spelled with a C), I don't know about Swedish. Karl VII is also spelled with a K on Swedish Wikipedia, so I don't think there's any reason to believe the source is Norwegian.\n\nWell, I believed that spelling Carl was used widely in Sweden in earlier times (for example Carl Johan). It's good to clarify, that this rule is not Scandinavian.\n\nIn the other hand, if a Danish king was called Christian, then there is no reason to change his name's spelling, as there is no discrepancy between the modern Danish spelling and old Danish spelling."
