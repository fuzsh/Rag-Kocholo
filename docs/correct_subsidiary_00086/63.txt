Sybase 365, a subsidiary of mobile messaging company Sybase, has been selected by Tesco Mobile in Ireland to enable international SMS delivery, enabling its subscribers to send and receive text messages from around the world.

As Irelands newest mobile network service provider, and the countrys first MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator), Tesco Mobile chose Sybase 365 because of its leadership in global SMS interoperability, through its reach to more than 700 mobile operators around the world.

As a young and dynamic operator, Tesco Mobile is aiming to become a strong player within its core markets, and wanted a partner that could offer experience, reliability and global connectivity.

Tesco Mobile is committed to offering a quality service and great value to our customers says Tesco Mobile Marketing Manager, Yvonne Lucas. Working with Sybase 365 to expand SMS messaging internationally helps us to achieve this.
