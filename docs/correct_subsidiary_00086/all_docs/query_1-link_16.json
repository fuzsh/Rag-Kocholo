        "text": "FAQs\n\nHow many users does Microsoft 365 Apps for business support?\n\nMicrosoft 365 Apps for business supports a maximum of 300 users. If you have more than 300 users or think you will soon, take a look at our other plan options.\n\nWhat forms of payment can I use?\n\nPay with all major credit cards, and your subscription amount will appear on your credit card statement. You have the option to receive an invoice and, depending on your choice of services, you’ll be billed monthly or annually. Receive an email message when your invoice is ready to be viewed and, if a purchase order number is entered when you buy your subscription, that number is included in your invoice.\n\nWhat payment options are available? Can I pay monthly or annually?\n\nChoose a monthly commitment payment or an annual commitment payment for Microsoft 365.\n\nMonthly commitment payment: Pay month by month and cancel at any time.\n\nAnnual commitment payment: Sign up for a one-year subscription and benefit from a discount for using this payment option. By default, your billing plan will be set to monthly billing. After your purchase, you can change your billing plan to annual billing within the Admin Portal.\n\nCan I cancel my subscription at any time?\n\nYou can cancel your subscription at any time; you may be entitled to a partial refund.\n\nWhat happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?\n\nYour data is yours. If you decide to cancel your Microsoft 365 subscription, you can download your dataâfor example, your email and documents on team sitesâand save it to another location. You should save your data before you cancel.

If your subscription has more than 300 users or if you used a prepaid card to\n\npurchase your plan, the switch plans wizard is not available. Plans that are not eligible for the switch plans wizard can be upgraded manually.\n\nNOTE: When you change your account, your domain name is transferred to your new account, whether you brought your own domain name to the Microsoft 365 account or you set up a domain name with Microsoft 365.\n\nWhat is Microsoft 365?\n\nMicrosoft 365 is the productivity cloud designed to help each of us achieve what matters, in our work and life, with best-in-class Office apps, intelligent cloud services, and advanced security.\n\nWhat happened to Office 365 business plans?\n\nOffice 365 business plans are now Microsoft 365 business plans.
