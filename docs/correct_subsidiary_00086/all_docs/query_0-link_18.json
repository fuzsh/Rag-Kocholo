        "text": "Software company Sybase Inc.’s aggressive expansion into the wireless market continued Tuesday with the announcement of its plans to acquire a mobile messaging company for $425 million.\n\nDublin-based Sybase sees the purchase of Mobile 365 as an opportunity to expand into a market that it sees growing to $7.5 billion by 2008.\n\nChantilly, Va.-based Mobile 365 makes software that allows customers to text message one another via their mobile devices even if the carriers involved in the communication are different. Some of the end users that Sybase will likely inherit with the deal include Citibank, America Online and Sony Pictures.\n\nTrip Chowdhry, an analyst with FTN Midwest Research, called the deal a very strong acquisition because it allows Sybase to “differentiate themselves from others in the wireless market.”\n\n“Sybase really has an opportunity to define (the mobile text messaging) industry and help customers become more involved in this type of mobile applications,” Chowdhry said.\n\nSybase develops a variety of database management software products. Its markets include financial services, health care and government. In recent years, the mobile and wireless segment of the business has been its biggest growth area — up about 23 percent in 2005. It now makes up about a third of the company’s total revenue, which was $818.7 million in 2005.\n\nThe move into text messaging represents “the third leg of the stool” to the company’s wireless sector push, with the other two being the data management and integration business, and the mobile software business, said Marty Beard, Sybase senior vice president.\n\nLast October, Sybase acquired Extended Systems Inc. for $71.3 million to expand its line of mobile products and establish a stronger presence in Europe.\n\nBefore the news was announced, Sybase shares rose 26 cents Tuesday to close at $23.14."
