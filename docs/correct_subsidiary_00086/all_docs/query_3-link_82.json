        "text": "Microsoft Word is one of the best word processors of 2024, allowing you to craft powerful documents with an intuitive interface. If you're working with large files that span multiple pages, you'll be happy to know that Microsoft gives you several easy ways to delete a page in Word, including both blank pages and those you simply no longer need.\n\nThough you (hopefully) won't use it often, knowing how to delete a page can save you the hassle of trying to reformat your entire document. Graphics can be particularly frustrating to delete, as they often jumble up the flow of the surrounding words, leading to an awkward page layout. But if you know how to delete a page, this is largely a problem of the past.\n\nHere's a look at how to delete pages in Word, with steps for blank pages, pages with content, and a few tips on how to best use the technique.\n\nHow to delete a page in Word\n\nStep 1: Select the page you want to delete. Either scroll to the page or use the Go To function (Ctrl + G in Windows, Option + CMD + G in macOS).\n\nWhen you’ve found the page, click or tap anywhere on it to select it.\n\nStep 2: Select the whole page, not just some of its content.\n\nStep 3: Delete the page. Double-check that you’ve selected the entirety of the page you want to delete, and then press the Delete key.\n\nHow to remove a blank page in Word\n\nStep 1: To find the blank page(s), open up the Navigation pane. You can do so by selecting View from the top menu and making sure that the Navigation pane box is ticked. That should open up a new column on the left-hand side, showing all the pages in your document. If it doesn’t, make sure to select the Pages tab in it.\n\nStep 2: Scroll through the list to find the blank page(s) you want to delete. Pick one and double click or select it to jump straight to it.\n\nStep 3: Hold Ctrl + Shift + 8 on Windows or Command + 8 if you’re using a Mac to make the paragraph markers visible.\n\nStep 4: Select the paragraph markers by clicking and dragging, or use the arrow keys and hold down the Shift key. You can eliminate the paragraph markers by pressing the Delete key, but this will also close out the blank page altogether.\n\nIssues that make page deletion in Word difficult\n\nIf the above didn't work, here are a few other issues that might be causing you trouble:"
