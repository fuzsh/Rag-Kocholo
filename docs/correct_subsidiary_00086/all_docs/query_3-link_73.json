        "text": "Last update: July 21st, 2024\n\nIf you're going to be one of the 51 million+ people who visit the United States each year and need an eSIM (or embedded SIM), you've come to the right place.\n\nEveryone knows that mobile communications in the US are among the most expensive places in the world. Major US carriers still have prohibitive prices, which can be challenging (here) for most people living outside the US who are used to cheap and affordable 4G or 5G mobile data plans.\n\nIn order to get a cheap data plan, you'll probably have to do a thorough web search, compare lots of options, order a physical SIM card weeks in advance, and pray that everything works once you get there. Sounds old-school, right?\n\nLuckily, eSIM plans are here now, and if you own one eSIM compatible device (check our recently updated list here), you already have access to hundreds of virtual SIM cards (eSIM) from providers around the world and you can connect in the next 5 minutes if you are already in the United States.\n\nHere are our top seven picks of eSIM providers and plans for traveling to the US that will help you avoid roaming charges, are affordable, and give you great value.\n\nBut before we dive in, it is probably a good idea to explain you what you should look at and be careful about when you buy a travel plan for the US.\n\nThe Best eSIM providers and plans for the US\n\nOur top recommandation : Airalo\n\nIf you're looking for a decent amount of data while keeping things relatively cheap and having a great user experience, you should definitely check out Airalo.\n\nAiralo is a Singapore-based eSIM provider that offers eSIM plans for hundreds of destinations. Their website, app and overall experience are excellent and getting an eSIM is a breeze.\n\nOn top of that, Airalo has great roaming agreements and you can expect to get 5G/4G coverage and speeds in most of the country with Tier 1 telecom providers for the US: T-Mobile Networks and AT&T.\n\nWe love Airalo's \"Change\" plans for the US, which come in three different flavors: 10GB, 5GB, and 3GB and cost $26.00, $16.00, and $11.00 respectively.\n\nYesim : the most affordable 20GB plan\n\nIf you want to minimize your spending on your prepaid eSIM plan while sticking to qualitative offers, Yesim plans are likely the way to go.\n\nYesim is a relatively new eSIM MVNO provider based in Switzerland and Latvia.\n\nTheir data only eSIM plan \"United States\" comes at a price of 21â‚¬ (or $22.75) and provides 20GB of 4G / LTE data, which makes it the cheapest plan per GB below 30GB ($1.60/GB).\n\nThis amount of data must be used within 30 days, which could last to normal users but won't last long for heavy data users. Tethering (hotspot feature) seem to be allowed.\n\nPlease note that as a great (paid) addition, Yesim offers users the ability to purchase phone numbers (from the United States, from Canada, or from Netherlands), voice minutes and text messages that will allow you to receive and send calls and text from the Yesim app.\n\nWe did not review that feature, but it's a very nice one for users that prefer to a phone number in addition to data.\n\nThe most advantageous eSIM plans for the United States are undoubtedly Nomad and Instabridge.\n\nNomad is a well known US based eSIM data provider that offers data plans worldwide. Maya is a more recent Sweden-based provider, that offers very decent eSIM products.\n\nBoth providers offer very aggressive prices and offer good quality networks and data for travelers to the United States.\n\nNomad : the best provider for USA + Canada + Mexico\n\nWe are great fans of Nomad, an eSIM MVNO from Singapore.\n\nTheir plans are great and reliable, while remaining affordable. If you're not only visiting the United States but also Mexico and / or Canada, their \"Regional North America - 30 Days - 20 GB\" plan offers great value.\n\nThe plan is compatible with multiple local operators in each country, in 4G & 5G.\n\nUnlike Yesim, this plan is data only and does not come with a phone number.\n\nInstabridge 3GB : perfect for up to three days\n\nIn case you don't need as much data as the plans recommended above and stay short term, Instabridge's 3GB data only plan is a great recommendation.\n\nIt is the most competitive 3GB plan for the US we could find. It is valid for 15 days, but we think it is very unlikely you can make it like that long if you consume mobile data like an average smartphone owner\n\nKeepgo or Bnesim : For longer stays (30 days and more)\n\nIf you are staying in the United States for more than 30 days. Or intend to come several times to the country, KeepGo and BNESIM offer excellent eSIM plans valid for 365 days or not expiring.\n\nKeepGo, an Israel-based telecom provider, offers a 25GB eSIM plan valid for 365 days. With a price tag of $90.00,\n\nit is more expensive but still offers great value due to its super long duration. KeepGo has roaming agreements for the United States with AT&T and T-Mobile. Note that the data remains valid for life, if filled in at least once a year (for any amount).\n\nBNESIM, the Italian eSIM provider, offers a 30 days 20 GB eSIM package!\n\nAfter using promo code \"ESIMS15\", the plan costs $46.12 ($54.26 if you don't use our discount code). Expect 4G speeds on BNESIM's US roaming partner: AT&T and T-Mobile.\n\nBest Mobile App: T-Mobile\n\nT-mobile, one of the major US local carriers, offers a prepaid eSIM plan aimed at tourists. For $40 you will get 10 GB of data.\n\nIt's a bit pricey, but you can experience the excellent T-Mobile app and the T-mobile network without intermediary.\n\nTo connect, all you have to do is download the T-mobile eSIM app and get your plan here, which is very simple and straightforward.\n\nAfter you have downloaded the T-mobile prepaid eSIM app on Google App Store or Google play store\n\nApple App Store\n\nGoogle Play Store\n\nYou will be prompted to create an account before you can purchase mobile data plans.\n\nT-mobile offers several \"prepaid unlimited eSIM plans\" which are quite pricey. Please note that they come with a fair usage policy (speed might be reduced beyond a 50GB monthly data use) and hotpost feature is very limited (sometimes throttled to 3G speeds). Nevertheless, those plans are of relatively good value.\n\nOne great feature that all t-mobile prepaid eSIM plans offer a phone number, with unlimited voice and text ! This is really a great benefit if you look for a phone numbrer.\n\nT-mobile also offers non unlimited plans, but they are really pricey for the amount of data they offer.\n\nWhat to look for in a prepaid eSIM for the USA\n\nThere are many eSIM plan options already available if you are travelling to the USA. On esims.io, as of today, we list more than 300 plans from dozen of providers that are compatible in the USA.\n\nMost of those plans are great and will do just fine for most internet browsing needs, but there are some important features related to the eSIM plan you purchase and to the provider you go with that you should be aware of before your purchase an eSIM plan.\n\nMVNO vs. Local Network eSIM plans\n\nFirst off, you've got two main types of plans: the ones created by MVNOs like Holafly, Airalo, and Nomad, and then your local providers like AT&T and Verizon.\n\nIf you're a globetrotter hopping from the U.S. to Canada to Mexico, MVNOs are your best friend.\n\nThey offer multi-country plans that give you the freedom to roam. But if you're staying put in the U.S., you might want to stick with AT&T or Verizon eSIM plans for more consistent speeds and better coverage.\n\nNetwork quality\n\nLocal Network(s) Compatibility and coverage Now, if you do go the MVNO route, you've got to play detective. It's crucial to investigate which local networks the MVNO has roaming partnerships with to see which ones you will be able to use.\n\nIn the U.S, Nomad offers roaming with both AT&T & Verizon networks. You don't want to be left hanging with a weak signal when you're in dire need of Google Maps. According to PCMag's 2022 mobile network tests, T-Mobile is currently the best network in the U.S., winning in 18 out of 30 cities tested. They've also improved their rural coverage, although they still have more dead zones in rural areas compared to AT&T and Verizon. AT&T, on the other hand, shines in network reliability, particularly in rural areas.\n\nSo, if you're going MVNO, look for one that partners with all those networks if possible, or with one of those networks if you have specific needs:\n\nNetwork Prioritization In the U.S., the big networks like AT&T and Verizon have this VIP list, and guess what? MVNO users aren't on it - somtimes. So, during busy times, you might find your data speeds throttled. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nInternet Routing and Latency This one's a bit geeky but super important. Some MVNOs route your internet traffic through servers that are miles away from your actual location. Imagine sending your data on a round-trip flight to Europe before it gets to your phone in the U.S. Yeah, that's gonna cause some lag. Some MVNOs are smart about this and have servers all over the world to minimize this issue.\n\n5G or 4G / LTE only Most eSIM plans are still on the 4G train, but if you're all about that speed, look for plans that offer 5G. It's not everywhere yet, but it's growing.\n\nUnderstand eSIM plan features or limitations\n\nPhone Number, Text, SMS: careful about VOIP solutions A lot of eSIM plans are data-only, which is cool if you're just gonna WhatsApp or FaceTime people. But if you need an actual phone number, dig a little deeper. Some plans offer it directly, while others might require you to use a VOIP app. Heads up, thoughâ€”some services like Uber are picky and won't take VOIP numbers.\n\nHotspot If you're the type who likes to share your connection with other devices, check if the eSIM plan allows for hotspoting. Some do, some don't. Don't assume; always check.\n\nUnlimited Plans and Fair Usage Policy: The \"Unlimited\" Mirage Lastly, don't get seduced by the word \"unlimited.\" Read the fine print. Most of these so-called unlimited plans have a Fair Usage Policy that'll cap your data after you hit a certain point.\n\nRead the fine lines: Holafly's unlimited plans are not truly unlimited and limit your speeds after a certain usage has been reached.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe United States is not the country where you will get the cheapest prepaid data plans, and you have to be careful about what your eSIM might hide before you purchase it.\n\nThat said, some eSIM providers are able to offer eSIM plans that offer decent value and won't break your bank. We love Airalo and Yesim plans the most."
