        "text": "One IF function has one test and two possible outcomes, TRUE or FALSE.\n\nNested IF functions, meaning one IF function inside of another, allows you to test multiple criteria and increases the number of possible outcomes.\n\nWe want to determine a student's grade based on their score.\n\nIf Bob's score in B2 is greater than or equal to 90, return an A.\n\nWe nest an IF function by setting value_if_false to IF B2 greater than or equal to 80, return B.\n\nWe use additional nested IF functions to test for C, D, and F grades.\n\nI am copying the formula.\n\nIn this formula, we must test B2 greater than or equal to 90 first, and then, B2 greater than or equal to 80, and so on.\n\nLet me show you why.\n\nIf B2 greater than or equal to 90 evaluates to TRUE, the formula returns A, and we are done.\n\nIf it is FALSE, B2 greater than or equal to 80 is evaluated.\n\nSince B2 greater than or equal to 90 has already been evaluated to FALSE, greater than or equal to 80 is essentially greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90.\n\nThis continues for greater than or equal to 70 and 60. F is the final value_if_false.\n\nHere is another example. We want to determine Commissions for our Sales staff.\n\nBut the Commission percentage varies depending on how much they have sold.\n\nIf Bob's Sales, B2, are greater than or equal to 10000 (the cursor is next to the cell reference; I am pressing F4 to make it an absolute cell reference), the Commission is 5%. I am pressing F4 again.\n\nIf Bob's Sales are greater than or equal to 5000, his Commission is 2%.\n\nOtherwise his Commission is 0.\n\nWe then multiply the result by his Sales.\n\nThis is another example where the order of the formula matters.\n\nSales greater than or equal to 10000 is tested first.\n\nIf it evaluates to TRUE, it returns value in G2, 5%.\n\nIf it evaluates to FALSE, Sales greater than or equal to 5000 is evaluated next.\n\nSince 10000 has already been evaluated as FALSE, Sales greater than or equal to 5000 is essentially greater than or equal to 5000 and less than 10000.\n\nIf neither greater than or equal to 10000 nor greater than or equal to 5000 is TRUE, the function returns the value in G4: 0."
