The company also sells to content providers, providing mobile services such as voting and text alerts.\n\nAccording to Sybase, the acquisition will better allow the company to target carriers and get a slice of the mobile messaging market which will be worth $7.5bn by 2008.\n\nThe deal is scheduled to close in the last quarter of this year and Sybase expects it to start adding to its bottom line within the next 12 months.\n\nMobile 365 will operate as a subsidiary of Sybase and will be run by Sybase's senior VP of corporate development and marketing, Marty Beard."
