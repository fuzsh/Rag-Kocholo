        "text": "In general, I recommend Atticus as the number one writing tool for authors. But this article is about the best writing apps for mobile devices, and Atticus is still working on its mobile capability (stay tuned). So while I would normally recommend Atticus, today I will be talking about Scrivener's mobile app, along with a few other writing apps that I categorized by their primary purpose.\n\nToday's world is on the move. From fast food to fast cars, I'm always on the go, making mobile technologies all that much more critical. You need the best writing apps at your fingertips.\n\nWhen you imagine a writer's life, you might imagine the stereotype: a pair of glasses hunched over a typewriter furiously punching keys and drowning in endless pots of coffee.\n\nYes, writers tend to drink a lot of coffee, but the world of writing is changing.\n\nMany writers manage their writing projects with mobile devices.\n\nSo let’s talk about the best writing apps for those mobile devices.\n\nWhat do professional writers use to write? Professional writers use a variety of apps to write their novels. Scrivener, MS Word, Final Draft, Google Docs, Plottr — there are so many great apps that bestselling writers use for their writing process.\n\nHere are my recommendations for the best writing apps for Android and iOS. (Nearly all of them work on desktop as well, but I weeded out the apps that only work on desktop.)\n\nWhen you use a link in this article, I may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you. It just helps with my coffee fund (AKA writer fuel), so I can keep bringing you the content you deserve. Plus, it means I can get you exclusive discount codes!\n\nWhy Am I Qualified to Talk about Writing Apps?\n\nLet's face it, there are many people out there that write these kind of articles by just doing some research on what others say, and regurgitating it out without firsthand knowledge of the tools in question (or worse, have AI write it for them). That's not the case here.\n\nAs someone who's been publishing books for over 13 years, I've seen a lot writing tools go up and down. Some have been revolutionary game-changers, while others haven't lived up to the hype.\n\nHowever, choosing the right writing app isn't just about picking the most popular one. Each writer has unique requirements and preferences. What works wonders for me might not for you. For example, Grammarly is hugely popular, but it's not what I recommend for long-form editing.\n\nSo, in order to create a top-notch overview of the best writing apps (for mobile devices, remember), I sent out surveys to my readers, and talked to some heavy-hitting authors in the industry – many of which I have been a consultant to as well.\n\nBased on my observations, the results from those surveys, and talking with some of the most well-known authors out there, I feel very strongly that this is a subject I can truly tackle.\n\nSo, with that, let's jump into a list of what I think are the best writing mobile apps for authors.\n\nBest Writing App for Novelists: Scrivener\n\nScrivener is the best mobile writing app for novelists, for now (again, see Atticus). It’s more organized than any other app. It’s got awesome, ready-made templates for all sorts of genres and layouts. And it works great on iPad and iPhone. (Sorry, Android users.)\n\nWhat is the best mobile app for writers? Scrivener on iOS is the best app for book writers. If you've read a few of my other articles, you may already know of my absolute love of Scrivener. If I had to recommend a single piece of writing software, Scrivener would be it — including for mobile devices.\n\nScrivener comes with a steep learning curve because it offers so much customizability and handy features. But there are plenty of free tutorials if you ever need help.\n\nScrivener for iOS is great for planning, drag-and-drop organizing, and even highlighting types of words. This means you can look for adverb overuse. From corkboard arrangement to keyboard shortcuts to word count goals, this app has almost as much power as its desktop app.\n\n(For a complete review on the desktop software, check out my Scrivener review article, complete with coupon code.)\n\nOnce you're done, you can always transfer your work over to your devices with Scrivener via Dropbox. Or you can export to DOCX, EPUB, MOBI, PDF, HTML, or even Multi-Markdown.\n\nThe only downside: The one-time price is a little steep for a mobile app ($19.99), and you have to buy a separate license for iOS if you already have a license for macOS or Windows.\n\nIf you’re an Android user, I’d try Novlr, which is browser-based, so you can use it on any mobile device with an Internet connection.\n\nWhich platforms does Scrivener work on?\n\niOS\n\nMac (most updated version)\n\nWindows\n\n(Sorry again, Android tablet/phone users.)\n\nPricing:\n\n$19.99 for iOS\n\n$49 for Mac or Windows\n\n$80 for both Mac and Windows licenses\n\n$41.65 for students & academics\n\nDownload Scrivener with this link and get an exclusive coupon code, KINDLEPRENEUR20, for a 20% discount on your Scrivener purchase.\n\nFollow these steps to use the discount coupon.\n\nBest used for:\n\nScrivener is great for authors who love organization, distraction-free writing, and ready-made templates. Authors can place audio files, research files, images, and more into Scrivener’s sidebar. This means all your documents and research are in one window — it’s so convenient!\n\nOther Good Apps for Novelists\n\nUlysses (Mac and iOS only)\n\niA Writer\n\nNovlr\n\nyWriter\n\nbibisco\n\nHemingway\n\nBest Writing App for General Writing: Microsoft Word\n\nThere’s a reason Microsoft Word is the industry standard text editor: it is versatile and easy to use.\n\nMicrosoft Office’s Word works well on mobile devices, running smoothly on iOS and Android. It creates beautiful, professional documents that you can export to multiple file formats.\n\nMS Word is suitable for general writing, but I would not recommend it for novel writing. Although it is perfect for memos, email drafts, and print-ready documents, its organization capabilities are not as robust as Scrivener, Ulysses, or other excellent writing software.\n\nAlso, its spelling and grammar checker is not as powerful as ProWritingAid or Grammarly.\n\nMS Word is expensive, but many people can use the app without an extra cost because of work or school giving them access.\n\nWhich platforms does Word work on?\n\niOS\n\nAndroid\n\nMac\n\nWindows\n\nPricing:\n\nThough Microsoft Word comes with some computers, it actually costs a pretty penny:\n\n$139.99 for Microsoft Word by itself\n\n$6.99 a month for Microsoft 365, which includes Microsoft Word\n\nBest used for:\n\nMicrosoft Word is best used for general writing, business-related documents, and print-ready formatting options. It’s great for corporate America, journalism, students, and the like.\n\nOther Good Apps for General Writing\n\nGoogle Docs\n\nLibreOffice\n\nOpenOffice\n\nFormatting Has Never Been Easier\n\nWrite and format professional books with ease. Never before has creating formatted books been easier.\n\nClick here to see it in action\n\nBest Free Writing App: Google Docs\n\nWhat is the best free writing app? Google Docs is the best free writing app on Android and iOS. If you’re on a budget, Google Docs is the perfect app for everything except proofreading, novel writing, or writing without the Internet.\n\nIt lets you customize headers, spacing, fonts — all the things you expect from a professional word processor. Google Docs autosaves every change you make and saves your version history. It exceeds at real-time collaboration, making it ideal for co-authors, bloggers, and ghostwriters.\n\nGoogle Docs Pros:\n\nConveniently browser-based\n\nReal-time collaboration\n\nTrackable changes\n\nAutosave functionality\n\nExport to multiple file types\n\nFREE\n\nGoogle Docs Cons:\n\nLaggy and buggy once you get over 15,000-20,000 word count\n\nGoogle Docs proofreader is weaker than Grammarly or ProWritingAid\n\nYou need the Internet and a Google account to access\n\nWhich platforms does Google Docs work on?\n\nGoogle Docs works on all major platforms and on most mobile devices — both Android and iOS.\n\nOther Free Writing Apps:\n\nLibreOffice\n\nyWriter\n\nFocusWriter\n\nReedsy Book Editor\n\nApple Pages\n\nMS Notepad\n\nBest Writing App for Emails & Short-Form: Grammarly\n\nGrammarly’s browser app is free to use and great for making sure your emails, memos, and other short-form projects look professional and error-free.\n\nCheck out my full review on Grammarly.\n\nGrammarly offers a keyboard that checks your spelling and grammar on mobile devices, offering helpful suggestions on how to improve whatever you’re typing.\n\nNot many people realize that Grammarly’s browser app can download your text as a DOCX file. This is great if you need to attach a DOCX file to your email instead of putting the text in the body.\n\nYou can also download Grammarly’s browser extension. This editing tool automatically checks your grammar and spelling when on Gmail, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other social media sites and email sites.\n\nRead this article on the Best Email Services For Authors, like GetResponse or MailerLite.\n\nGrammarly’s free version offers robust proofreading features that are way better than Microsoft Word or MacOS’s built-in grammar and spelling checker.\n\nThe premium version of Grammarly is fantastic, too. It offers many more suggestions to improve your writing style, readability, passive voice, and dialogue formatting.\n\nHowever, if you are paying for a premium proofreader, I’d recommend ProWritingAid’s premium version. Its web version can also export to DOCX. Check out this video where I explain how ProWritingAid’s premium version is superior to Grammarly’s.\n\nGrammarly’s browser application and browser extension make your emails, posts, and memos more professional and error-free. It gives you confidence and lets everyone know that you are not a joke.\n\nWhich platforms does Grammarly work on?\n\nGrammarly is a browser-based app and extension that runs on:\n\nChrome\n\nSafari\n\nFirefox\n\nEdge\n\nPricing:\n\nGrammarly’s free version is a powerful proofreading tool that ensures your emails, memos, or Facebook ads and posts are professional and error-free.\n\nGrammarly’s premium version offers a lot more suggestions about word choice and writing style. It has multiple pricing options:\n\n$29.95 per month\n\n$59.94 per 3 months ($19.98/month value)\n\n$139.95 per year ($11.66/month value)\n\nGrammarly Business is $12.50/month per member (minimum 3 members)\n\nBest used for:\n\nEmails\n\nMemos\n\nBlog posts (WordPress, etc.)\n\nSocial media posts\n\nOther Good Apps for Emails & Short-Form\n\nProWritingAid\n\nText Expander\n\nReadable (Android only)\n\nBest Writing App for Screenwriters: Final Draft\n\nScreenwriting is a type of writing apart from a novel or article that is growing in popularity. Final Draft is an iOS-exclusive paid app dedicated strictly to screenwriting.\n\nAccording to Final Draft’s own research, fewer than 5% of their users use Android mobile devices, so they won’t develop the Android app anytime soon.\n\nFinal Draft has a lot of great features, such as:\n\nProfessionally formatted templates for TV, Film, and Stage Plays\n\nSmartType, which remembers your character's names, scenes, etc.\n\nThe ability to export PDFs to iCloud, Dropbox, or email\n\nElement-based script searching\n\nColor-coded ScriptNotes\n\nDavid Seidler, the Academy Award-winning author of The King's Speech, loves the ability to change his drafts quickly and on the go.\n\nWhat app do screenwriters use to write? Screenwriters use the Final Draft app on iOS to write their screenplays.\n\nIf you're a serious screenwriter or looking to break into the biz, you should definitely consider getting this app. It’s expensive, but it is the industry standard. According to their website, Final Draft is “used by 95% of film and television productions.”\n\nHowever, if you don't own an Apple device, Celtx Script is probably your best bet.\n\nWhich platforms does Final Draft work on?\n\niOS\n\nMac\n\nWindows\n\nFinal Draft does not intend on developing or maintaining an Android version of their app.\n\nPricing:\n\nThe full license for Final Draft 11 costs a one-time fee of $249.99, but there are usually deals you can snag to earn 20% off.\n\nBest used for:\n\nFinal Draft is best used for writing screenplays, even on mobile devices. There’s a good reason it’s the industry standard for screenwriting.\n\nOther Good Apps for Screenwriters\n\nCeltx Script (for Android or iOS)\n\nStoryist (iOS only)\n\nScrivener\n\nBest Writing App for Productivity: Novlr\n\nNovlr is an aesthetically-pleasing, browser-based creative writing tool that automatically saves to the cloud. Its distraction-free Focus Mode is customizable and perfectly sets the mood for writing productively.\n\nHow do I start just writing? If you have trouble just getting started writing, consider using a productivity app like Novlr, Daily Prompt, or FocusWriter.\n\nFeatures of Novlr:\n\nMinimalist aesthetic\n\nTrack writing stats\n\nMotivational goals and positive feedback\n\nOrganization and outlining functionality\n\nWriting style suggestions\n\nCollaboration\n\nDay-night color options\n\nEasy exporting to multiple file formats\n\nRead my full review of Novlr here.\n\nWhich platforms does Novlr work on?\n\nNovlr is a browser-based app that works on all major browsers:\n\nChrome\n\nSafari\n\nFirefox\n\nMicrosoft Edge\n\nYou can save app.novlr.org to your phone/tablet’s home screen, and it works much like an application.\n\nPricing:\n\nAfter a 2-week free trial, Novlr costs:\n\n$10/month\n\n$100/year ($8.33/month value)\n\nBest used for:\n\nNovlr is best used for distraction-free writing that encourages productivity in a plethora of ways.

It is a browser-based app, so you can access it from anywhere you have Internet, including from a phone or tablet.\n\nCheck out my full review on Plottr.\n\nRead my comprehensive article on The Best Software to Outline Your Book.\n\nYou can organize plot points, create colorful characters, and build your world with ease on Plottr. It even comes with ready-made templates.\n\nPlottr offers these intuitive outline templates:\n\nThe Snowflake Method\n\nThe Three Story Method\n\nThe Story Circle\n\nThe Seven Point Plot Structure\n\nThe Hero's Journey\n\nAlthough you can use Plottr on your Mac or Windows computer, its app is very mobile-friendly.\n\nDownload Plottr today!\n\nWhich platforms does Plottr work on?\n\nPlottr is an app available on all major platforms:\n\niOS\n\nAndroid\n\nMac\n\nWindows\n\nChrome\n\nSafari\n\nFirefox\n\nEdge\n\nPricing:\n\nThere are 3 tiers for Plottr:\n\n1 Device — $25/year or $99/lifetime\n\n3 Devices — $45/year or $149/lifetime\n\n5 Devices — $65/year or $199/lifetime\n\nBest used for:\n\nPlottr is best used for outlining novels, but it is an organizational tool at its heart.

This award-winning app automatically syncs your notes to every device you have it installed on (only 2 devices with the free version).\n\nHonestly, I am so thankful for my Evernote app. I'm a big fan of jotting down fresh new ideas on my phone. But notes aren't the only thing you can save. You can actually save web clippings, video, PDF, images, GIFs, and more (with a paid upgrade, of course).\n\nOn top of that, you're able to share your notes with other people. All you need is to grant the proper permissions to a co-author, friend, or ghostwriter, and voila!\n\nEvernote is always improving. Though I think their table function could use an upgrade, Evernote releases free updates all the time.\n\nWhich platforms does Evernote work on?\n\niOS\n\nAndroid\n\nMac\n\nWindows\n\nPricing:\n\nThe free version of Evernote is robust and useful. Having the “freemium” version of Evernote is still worth getting, even if you don’t plan on spending any money on the premium version.\n\nThe premium version of Evernote is separated into 2 versions:\n\nPremium — $69.99/year\n\nBusiness — $14.99/user/month\n\nBest used for:\n\nEvernote’s award-winning app is best used for taking notes in many different ways on many different devices.

But it's not just limited to generating text.

It is the best free text to speech service available.\n\nThe most natural-sounding voice option is British English Harry. In fact, you will hear British English Harry all across the Internet — on YouTube, Twitch, etc. Many web users utilize British English Harry’s voice because it almost passes for a British human male.\n\nOther text-to-speech apps either cost a lot of money or only allow a few hundred characters.\n\nRead my article on Best Book Transcription Services for Authors.\n\nI know authors who copy and paste in a chapter to FromTextToSpeech.com and listen to it while editing that same chapter.
