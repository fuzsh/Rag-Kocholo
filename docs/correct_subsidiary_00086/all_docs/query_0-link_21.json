        "text": "M-commerce services provider Sybase 365, a subsidiary of Sybase, has teamed up with global development organisation Swisscontact to pave the way for the introduction of mobile remittance and m-banking services in emerging markets.\n\nThe two parties will cooperate to resolve regulatory, technological, financial and educational challenges in order to build mobile financial ecosystems in emerging markets.\n\nSybase 365 has already deployed Mobile Money for the Unbanked (MMU) and microfinance services in emerging markets including Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Columbia and Chile, as well as mobile money transfer (MMT) services in markets including the Philippines, the UAE, Malaysia and the United States.\n\nMobile applications developer Sybase acquired privately-held German mobile payments company paybox in January 2009. The deal came after Sybase subsidiary Sybase 365 had partnered with paybox in November to add new features to its mobile payments and mobile money services. Sybase 365â€™s mCommerce service enables subscribers to buy, pay, bank and remit money via a mobile device."
