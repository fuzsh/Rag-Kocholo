        "text": "Sybase 365, a subsidiary of Sybase, has entered into partnership with MobiKash Afrika, an independent Kenyan mobile commerce services provider, to deliver the first intra-region, mobile network and bank agnostic, mobile commerce solution for East and Southern Africa.\n\nThe companies will deliver mcommerce solutions to increase the current level of financial inclusion of the unbanked and semi-banked, via a simplified registration process for opening mobile wallets, as well as rapid bank account opening processes.\n\nAn individual’s accessibility to financial institutions, whether banks, micro-finance institutions (MFIs) or savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs) is significantly increased while offering tailored financial products beyond the now mainstream person-to-person mobile money transfer services found in Africa.\n\nDuncan Otieno, CEO of MobiKash Afrika, said: “Integrating financial institutions and other stakeholders into a single mobile commerce platform makes it a great deal easier for individuals, governments and businesses to manage finances. The ultimate goal is to also make it effortless for people to progress towards opening a fully integrated bank account.”\n\nMatthew Talbot, vice president of mCommerce at Sybase 365, said: “The MobiKash project represents a significant step forward in delivering the necessary integrated infrastructure required to ensure that the unbanked can now move towards seamless transactions via an exceptionally advanced mcommerce portal service.\n\nWith many similar projects already being deployed by Sybase 365, the African continent will eventually become an integrated single mcommerce ecosystem using a common architecture and product set.”"
