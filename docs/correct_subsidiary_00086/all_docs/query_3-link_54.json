        "text": "If you're someone with a PC or Mac and find that you just can't get your work done without Word, Excel or any of the other widely used Microsoft productivity apps, owning a copy of Office is a necessity. Microsoft software is often expensive, but you don't have to wait for the Amazon Prime Day deals to kick in to bag yourself a bargain. Microsoft does offer a subscription option for Office that brings down the overall price, but this deal on StackSocial is a much better value, knocking 89% off of a lifetime license for Microsoft Office 2019, making it just $25. Act soon if you want to take advantage of it because this deal comes to an end tonight.\n\nThere are two versions of Office on sale here. Mac users will get the Home and Business suite of apps, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams Classic and OneNote. Windows users will get the Professional Plus version, with additional apps like Publisher and Access. Just keep in mind that you won't get Microsoft Teams on the Windows version.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\nThis isn't the latest version of Office, but compared with signing up for the Microsoft 365 subscription suite, which costs $7 a month or $70 a year for individuals, StackSocial's offer may be a better deal for those who just need the basics and not the very latest features. There is a free Microsoft Office online alternative that you can use, but it lacks several features and can only be used in the browser. These days, Apple users can also score Outlook as a free Mac app. Even so, the additional productivity apps available may make this bundle a sound investment for most users."
