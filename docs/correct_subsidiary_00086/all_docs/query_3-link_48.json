        "text": "Microsoft Office, or Microsoft 365, is a premium application suite that you need to pay for to get full access to. That is, unless you use the web apps, or the free trials, or you're a student. Then you can get Microsoft Office for free. And don't forget the excellent Microsoft Office alternatives you can try (for free!) too.\n\nHere's how to get Microsoft 365 for free, in a few different ways.\n\nWant to buy the full application suite instead? Check out our Office deals page to find the best price on Microsoft Office today.\n\nUse the free web apps\n\nMicrosoft has been gradually expanding the number of apps you can use online for free and now offers an impressive suite that can easily merge with downloaded apps, provider plenty of functionality for the average project. It's not the full suite with all the features, but you can get most of the core functionality without paying a thing.\n\nTo enjoy these free web apps yourself, navigate to the Microsoft 365 web app page and select Sign up for free. You can create an account if you need to, or just sign in if you have an account already. Follow the on-screen instructions, and you can begin using the free web-app versions of Microsoft Office applications immediately.\n\nThis method allows you to use Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Calendar, and other traditional Microsoft apps. It also gives you access to more niche apps, like Sway, an interactive report/presentation app; People, an advanced contact list; and OneDrive, a cloud storage service where you can access and save your files.\n\nSo, if this is all here and available for free, why does the rest of this article exist? Because while these apps are useful, they're also limited to only very basic functions. They don't offer the full features that Microsoft 365 provides, and you need an online connection to use them. It'll work for simple tasks, like putting together a simple document, but it won't work for more complicated ones.\n\nStudents: Get Office apps through your school\n\nIf you are part of an education organization (student, faculty, or staff), enter your school email address on this site and see if you can get a version of Office for free. Microsoft extends the Office 365 Education program to all students, but your school needs to be signed up first. The benefits include access to the Office apps you expect (such as Word and Excel), plus other apps, such as Microsoft Teams, Access, and Publisher.\n\nIf you just graduated, you may not be able to get Office apps for free, but you can get them at a very low cost. The alumni discount allows you to get Microsoft 365 Personal for just $1 per month for 12 months, a great deal for those starting out in their professional environments.\n\nTry a free 30-day trial of Microsoft 365\n\nFree trials are still a thing, and Microsoft Office apps are no exception. If you want to experience Microsoft 365 for free, you can -- for a full month. Just head to the free trial page and sign up. The trial allows you to download Microsoft 365 for up to six users and across Windows, Macs, and mobile devices. Plus, you get 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage for each user to experiment with. The trial includes the latest versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and other apps.\n\nThe downside is that you only get a month of service, which obviously isn't beneficial if you need long-term access. Another caveat is that Microsoft requires your financial account information before the download and will start automatically charging you after the month is up, which can make disentangling yourself from Microsoft 365 a little difficult (which is the point). It's a good way to try out the full version of Microsoft 365 to see if it offers enough to be worth the price tag, but be ready to cancel if you don't want to be charged.\n\n**Note: **Some product offers can be a little tricky, like the \"Try Microsoft 365 Personal for free\" hook on the Microsoft Store. Be warned that this is still referring to the one-month trial version, even if it doesn't come right out and say so. And don't try those \"free product key\" websites, which tend to be pretty sketchy and rarely deliver.\n\nTry the alternatives\n\nIf you need Office-like apps to do homework or other projects but don’t want to pay, you can find free alternatives that emulate its features with only a couple differences. You can transfer the files to the Office suite with ease. There are just a few compatibility issues you should know about. I personally like Libre Office, but there are a range of options out there.\n\nSome people use alternatives sparingly, while some use them every day. However you use Office-like apps, it’s doable on a budget. The Office experience is affordable for many, and students may be able to get free access through their university."
