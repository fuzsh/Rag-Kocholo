The auto correction is too extreme whenever I would type simple words such as because or table, it would put a red line under it, saying that I spelled it wrong. I would check all of the words that I got wrong using a dictionary, and I still got the same result. I had to fix this by turning off the auto correction completely, which wasnât what I wanted to do because itâs some cases I do want the auto correct, but not in cases where it is that extreme. Secondly, the templates are super Jenkee. I cannot get a single one of them to work like they are supposed to. I canât find a way to change the background on any of the templates, so I just had to start with a blank book. not to mention the pages have a weird gibberish title, Erna sempter and itâs not helpful because what I need is just a blank line with spacing and a chapter 1 where I have to delete so much that I donât have any room to actually write a novel. starting with a blank document is the only thing that works well and even that Jenkee. If you could, please change these this would be a very good app and it would be just like word. I would appreciate it if these changes were made thank you very much."
