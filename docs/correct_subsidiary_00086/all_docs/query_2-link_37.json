        "text": "I am going to show you how to write a basic formula to demonstrate a couple of important concepts.\n\nFirst, to help us keep everything straight, let's click this + sign to add a new worksheet. Then, double-click the worksheet tabs and type names.\n\nNow, we can add the data.\n\nThe formula we are going to write will go in this column and use the amounts in these two columns and a percentage amount.\n\nWe could format the data as a table, but let's leave it as is for this demonstration.\n\nThe first thing we need is a cell to hold the percentage amount.\n\nPick a cell outside the data and type .1.\n\nThen, come up here to the Number group and click the % button to format the cell as a percentage.\n\nWhen we are finished, we'll be able to change this number, if we want to calculate a different Cost buffer amount with our formula.\n\nNow, we can enter the formula.\n\nThe formula adds the Material and Labor cells, and then, multiplies that amount by the buffer percentage cell.\n\nThe asterisk is used to multiply. Press Enter to see what happens.\n\nWell, it's pretty obvious that this amount is not 10 percent of the first two columns. And the reason it's not is because I didn't consider calculation order.\n\nThis is the order in which Excel calculates the parts of a formula.\n\nYou don't need to remember all the details.\n\nJust keep in mind that multiplication and division are calculated before addition and subtraction. And in our formula, we wanted Excel to add the first cells, then multiply.\n\nTo tell Excel to add first, we simply insert parentheses. Now instead of multiplying, then adding, Excel will add the first two numbers, then multiply.\n\nNow we can use AutoFill to add the formulas to the other cells.\n\nBut now we run into another problem.\n\nIn the first cell, the formula gets its buffer percentage from D20.\n\nBut in the next cell, the formula refers to D21. And since D21 is empty, the formula multiplies by zero, and returns a value of zero.\n\nBut why did Excel change this cell reference to D21?\n\nBecause when you use AutoFill or copy a formula, Excel uses relative references by default. Here's how that works.\n\nIn the first cell, the formula refers to these cells in row 6 and D20. When you use AutoFill, Excel changes the cell reference based on location to row 7 and D21.\n\nIn most cases, this is what you want.\n\nBut in this case, we want the formulas to always use the value in this particular cell. To make that happen, we need to change the cell reference to an absolute reference.\n\nIn the formula, click D20, and then type dollar signs in front of the D and the 20.\n\nThe dollar signs tell Excel that the formula must always refer to the cell in column D in the 20th row. Press Enter.\n\nNow when you AutoFill the cell, all the formulas point to D20. And we can change the percentage to calculate a different buffer amount.\n\nThe last thing we'll do is add an Estimated Cost column that uses a function.\n\nWith G6 selected, click AutoSum.\n\nExcel automatically assumes we want to add the 3 columns to the left.\n\nSo, press Enter. And then AutoFill the formula to the other cells.\n\nIn this course, you have learned the basics of creating your first Excel workbook.\n\nWhere do you go next? Well, try exploring Excel 2013 on your own. For example, you can quickly create charts and use these buttons to add formatting.\n\nTo dig even deeper into Excel features, tools, functions, and formulas, check out the links in the course summary."
