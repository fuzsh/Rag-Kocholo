        "text": "Which providers offer 365-day prepaid plans?\n\nNot all prepaid providers offer long-term plans, however there are quite a few options including plans from the biggest telcos and some of the smaller ones. Here is a list of some prepaid providers currently offering 365-day prepaid mobile plans:\n\nAmaysim\n\nBoost Mobile\n\nTelstra\n\nOptus\n\nWoolworths Mobile\n\nVodafone\n\nCatch Connect\n\nColes Mobile\n\nKeep in mind that the smaller providers, known as Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), will offer plans using one of the three mobile networks, which are owned and operated by Telstra, Optus and Vodafone. Before signing up to any plan, check the provider’s website to find out if there is mobile network coverage in your area and any areas you frequently visit.\n\nIs a 365-day prepaid plan right for me?\n\nTo figure out if a 365-day prepaid plan might be the right plan for you, you’ll need to consider whether having the convenience of a ‘set and forget’ plan is worth the large upfront cost. Of course, there are other factors that might make or break the deal so it is important to look at the pros and cons before making the commitment.\n\nPros to 365-day prepaid plans\n\nChoosing a prepaid plan over a year-long expiry period does have its benefits. Of course, the fact that you pay in advance for a year’s worth of inclusions is great for anyone who doesn’t want to worry about recharges or paying bills — it is the ultimate set and forget plan.\n\nIt also gives you more control over your usage. If your data usage differs from month-to-month, such as using a small amount of data in one month then using much more in another month, having the whole amount of data upfront gives you more flexibility with your usage and puts you in control.\n\nCons to 365-day prepaid plans\n\nHowever, the disadvantage is that these plans are expensive to pay for upfront, costing anywhere between $100 and $400, depending on inclusions. The amount of data included on the plan is typically what will determine how much you pay, as most prepaid plans these days include unlimited standard national calls and SMS by default.\n\nThe other negative is that you will most likely need to ration your data each month. Some providers might offer the option to give you a set amount of data each month, however most plans will give you all of the data upfront for you to use as needed. While some people might prefer this flexibility, if you chew through your data before those 365 days are over, you’ll need to recharge your plan early. Considering how you use your data could help you to determine whether one of these plans will suit you or not."
