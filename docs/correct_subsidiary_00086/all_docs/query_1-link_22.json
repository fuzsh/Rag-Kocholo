        "text": "How to Save Outlook Personal Contacts to the Default Contacts App on a Mobile Device\n\nIn order to have your personal Outlook contacts available for use across other apps on your phone, follow the instructions below to sync contacts from your Outlook for Mobile app into your default Contacts app. This will only sync your personal contacts, not the contents of the Global Address List (GAL). This is an ongoing synchronization, so any items added or updated in Outlook will be synced to your mobile device within a few minutes.\n\nNotes:\n\nIn iOS, any changes made in the Contacts App will not be available in the Outlook for Mobile App. The sync is one-way, from Outlook to the native Contacts app, so your contacts should be edited within Outlook (desktop, OWA or the Outlook app).\n\nIn Android, the sync is two-way, and contacts can be edited in either app.\n\nFor iOS (iPhone and iPad)\n\nFor Android\n\nFor iOS (iPhone and iPad):\n\nOpen Outlook for Mobile App and Select the \"Photo\" icon.\n\nSelect the \"Gear\" icon.\n\nUnder \"Mail Accounts\" select \"Office 365\" with your LSUHSC email address below it.\n\nSwitch toggle on for \"Save Contacts\".\n\nFor Android:"
