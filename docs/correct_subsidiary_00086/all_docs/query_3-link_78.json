You have to look for options that can make your business more productive and efficient, including collaboration features, third-party integrations, and more.\n\nKeep reading to see what each of these options can offer your business.\n\nAnalyzing the best virtual business phone number apps\n\nHere’s a detailed exploration of how these eight virtual phone services stack up, ranked from highest to lowest based on their price, functionality, and integrations.\n\n1. OpenPhone: The best virtual business phone number app for growing teams\n\nPros\n\nUnlimited calls and texts to US and Canada\n\nLocal and toll-free virtual numbers available\n\nAvailable on iOS, Android, desktop, and web\n\nInternal threads, contact notes, and call recordings for team coordination\n\nAuto-attendant functions (IVR) for inbound calls\n\nCons\n\nCan’t verify accounts through two-factor authentication*\n\n*Nearly all virtual phone numbers share this problem. For safety reasons, companies like Facebook, Uber, and Google rarely let you authenticate accounts through a virtual phone number.\n\nOpenPhone is an all-in-one VoIP system that scales with your business. Since OpenPhone operates over an internet connection, you can manage all of your business communications (calls and texts) on any existing computer, smartphone, or tablet — there’s no need to invest in a desk phone or expensive hardware.\n\nWith OpenPhone’s comprehensive features, you’ll never miss a vital customer detail or request again. Every plan includes the essentials like call recording, voicemail transcripts, and more.\n\nOne of the biggest draws of OpenPhone is how easily it enables team collaboration. Users can access shared numbers, simultaneous ring, contact notes, and internal threads. With these features, your customers won’t wait long on hold or have to repeat themselves when they reach a new representative. Any of your customer service representatives can read notes from previous calls and get up to speed.\n\nOpenPhone is also the solution for improving operational efficiencies. Use generative AI to provide real-time call transcriptions, summaries, and message responses, expediting your team’s next steps and action items. We also integrate with popular business software solutions like Slack, Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zapier.\n\nOpenPhone is the best business phone number app for small businesses and growing teams, but you don’t have to take our word for it. Try OpenPhone with our 7-day free trial.\n\nHow to get a business number with OpenPhone\n\nGetting a new phone number from almost anywhere in the world is a simple process when you choose OpenPhone as your virtual phone number provider. Follow these three steps:\n\nCreate an account with OpenPhone (when you sign up, you get a free, seven-day trial).\n\nDuring signup, choose your city or area code in the US to select your preferred phone number.\n\nOnce the signup process is complete, you’re all set to use your business phone number!\n\nKey features of OpenPhone\n\nFree calling and texting in the US and Canada\n\nCall routing\n\nCall recording\n\nAuto-attendant (IVR; requires upgrade)\n\nDesktop, web, and mobile apps\n\nOptions to get a US, Canadian, or North American toll-free business number\n\nShared phone numbers\n\nBusiness hour settings\n\nVoicemail transcriptions\n\nAI-suggested text responses\n\nTexting automation (snippets and auto-replies)\n\nAI-generated call summaries, transcripts, and action items\n\nBusiness app integrations (Slack, Zapier, Google Contacts, and email come standard)\n\nOpenPhone pricing\n\nOpenPhone has three affordable pricing options:\n\nStarter: $15 per user per month for shared phone numbers, internal threads, contact notes, voicemail transcriptions, scheduled messages, auto-replies, manual call recording, and more\n\nBusiness: $23 per user per month for automatic call recording, group calling, AI call summaries and transcripts, and phone integrations with HubSpot and Salesforce\n\nEnterprise: Custom pricing for a custom plan, including audit logs and priority support\n\nOpenPhone user ratings\n\nApp Store: 4.5 with 8,300+ ratings\n\nPlay Store: 3.7 with 3,300+ ratings\n\nG2: 4.7 with 1,700+ ratings\n\n2. Google Voice: Best for Google Workspace users\n\nPros\n\nMake free calls to the US\n\nIntegrates with other Google Workspace apps\n\nShare responsibility for incoming calls (requires upgrade)\n\nCons\n\nTexting is available in the US only\n\nCosts more than other business phone system providers\n\nNo toll-free numbers\n\nNo desktop app is available\n\nNo auto-replies\n\nNo integrations outside Google Workspace\n\nIf you’ve ever Googled ‘VoIP,’ you’ve no doubt run into Google Voice. This is one of the most popular business solutions on the market.\n\nThe most significant advantage of Google Voice is that it integrates with Google Workspace apps, making it a popular draw for businesses that already use Gmail, Google Sheets, and Google Docs.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that Google Voice does not provide a free business phone number. A line is free for personal phones (i.e., the Google Voice plan), but it costs $10 a month per user minimum for businesses through Google Voice for Google Workspace — plus an additional $6 per user per month, as you must have an active Google Workspace account.\n\nThat’s not all: Google Voice doesn’t offer toll-free numbers, auto-replies, or differentiation between personal phone calls and your second number.\n\nKey features of Google Voice\n\nFree unlimited calling to the US from anywhere (and to Canada from the US)\n\nSMS in the US\n\nMobile phone and web apps\n\nVoicemail transcriptions\n\nGoogle Calendar and Google Meet integrations\n\nUpgrade required for advanced features like auto-attendant\n\nGoogle Voice pricing\n\nGoogle Voice has three pricing plans:\n\nStarter: $10 per user per month*\n\nStandard: $20 per user per month* to unlock on-demand call recordings, ring groups, and phone menus\n\nPremier: $30 per user per month* to unlock automatic call recordings and advanced reporting\n\n*Plus an additional $6 per user per month payment for Google Workspace required to use Google Voice for business.\n\nGoogle Voice user ratings\n\niOS: 4.3 with 59,000+ ratings\n\nAndroid: 4.4 with 348,000+ ratings\n\nG2: 4.1 with 150+ reviews\n\n3. Grasshopper: Best for multi-digit extensions\n\nPros\n\nUnlimited calling to the US and Canada\n\nVoicemail transcriptions\n\nAuto-attendant (phone menu) with extensions\n\nCons\n\nNo call recording\n\nNo shared phone numbers\n\nNo Slack, Zapier, or CRM integrations\n\nAs a legacy VoIP provider, Grasshopper is one of the oldest and most well-known virtual business phone number apps. One of its standout features is its single-digit extensions for departments and multi-digit extensions for employees. Another notable feature is its pricing — Grasshopper users get access to all its features on each of plan. You only pay more for additional user seats, numbers, and extensions\n\nCompared to other providers mentioned in this article, their platform is relatively bare, with basic features like voicemail greetings and transcriptions. Even when they go the extra mile and offer features like auto-replies, there are enough limitations in place that you won’t get the full value out of them. Auto-replies in Grasshopper only go out to first-time callers — not every time someone contacts you over calls or texts.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that limitations in phone numbers (a max of 5 on the highest plan without paying extra) and zero integrations can be a problem as your business grows. Sharing responsibility for incoming calls also costs extra ($10 per month) on their dated platform.\n\nKey features of Grasshopper\n\nUnlimited calls to Canada and the 48 continental states\n\nAndroid and iOS mobile apps\n\nVanity numbers\n\nCall transfers\n\nVoicemail to text\n\nGrasshopper pricing\n\nGrasshopper offers three plans — True Solo, Solo Plus, and Small Business. While each plan offers all its features, they differ by the number of users and extensions you can access.\n\nHere’s how much each plan costs:\n\nTrue Solo: $14 per month for one user, one phone number, and one extension\n\nSolo Plus: $25 per month for unlimited users, one phone number, and three extensions\n\nSmall Business: $55 per month for unlimited users, four phone numbers, and unlimited extensions\n\nGrasshopper user ratings\n\niOS: 4.8 with 43,000+ ratings\n\nAndroid: 4.2 with 3,900+ ratings\n\nG2: 4.0 with 140+ reviews\n\n4. Nextiva: Best for large enterprise teams\n\nPros\n\nUnlimited calling within the US and Canada\n\nVideo calling features available\n\nCons\n\nSMS and MMS are offered only on higher pricing tiers with a capped message limit\n\nCall recording is only available with Enterprise plan\n\nLimited toll-free minutes on each plan\n\nVideo conferencing and screen sharing are what Nextiva does best. Built for teamwork-based industries like eCommerce and IT, this provider’s unified communication platform supports 10-digit and toll-free numbers. Integrations with Salesforce, Zendesk, and CRM platforms are provided on their second and third-highest plans.\n\nBut without business texting services on the Essential plan and message limits even when they upgrade, many teams seek out Nextiva alternatives. Also missing from Nextiva’s base plans are essential features like call recording and voicemail transcription. If you want to provide a toll-free option to your customers, Nextiva limits your toll-free minutes, which means you might have to pay for toll-free calls every month on top of your monthly fee.\n\nKey features of Nextiva\n\nVirtual fax services\n\nIntegration with Google Contacts\n\nUnlimited voice or video conference calling\n\nVoicemail transcriptions (requires upgrade)\n\nWiFi call management\n\nNextiva pricing\n\nNextiva offers three plans to its customers:\n\nEssential: $18.95 per user per month for unlimited calling within the US and Canada, video conference recording, auto attendant, and contact integrations\n\nProfessional: $22.95 per user per month to access SMS/MMS messaging, voicemail transcriptions, and HubSpot and Zendesk integrations\n\nEnterprise: $32.95 per user per month to access call recording and Salesforce and ServiceNow integrations\n\nNextiva user ratings\n\niOS: 3.8 with 4,200+ ratings\n\nAndroid: 3.8 with 3,000+ ratings\n\nG2: 4.5 with 3,100+ reviews\n\n5. Ooma: Best for teams that need fax and paging support\n\nPros\n\nUnlimited calling in the US, Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico\n\nAuto-attendant\n\nRing groups\n\nCons\n\nTexting is only available on higher tiers\n\nVoicemail transcriptions are only available on higher tiers\n\nCall recording is only available on higher tiers\n\nUnnecessary features like intercom calling and analog fax machine support\n\nThe VoIP mobile app from Ooma was specifically designed for small businesses. Users can access free inbound and outbound calling in North America and Mexico. Better yet, extension dialing and call forwarding are available to all in-app users.\n\nHowever, Ooma may be restrictive for business growth once your brand gets to a certain size. A lack of analytics may prevent you from measuring activity on a second phone number. Plus, Ooma offers legacy phone features like virtual fax and analog paging support, which means you’d pay for features you don’t need. You’ll also need to upgrade to access their desktop app if you want to call and text from your computer using Ooma. Any text messaging requires you to pay for one of their higher-tier plans. If you also need voicemail transcriptions or call recording software, get ready to upgrade.\n\nKey features of Ooma\n\nSmartphone mobile apps\n\nVirtual receptionists\n\nMulti-ring and ring groups\n\nOverhead paging\n\nText messaging (requires upgrade)\n\nVirtual and analog fax machine support\n\nOoma pricing\n\nOoma has three pricing plans for small businesses:\n\nEssentials: $19.95 per user per month\n\nPro: $24.95 per user per month to unlock texting, voicemail transcriptions, call recording, and Ooma’s desktop app\n\nPro Plus: $29.95 per user per month for Ooma’s Salesforce integration, hot desking, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 integration\n\nOoma user ratings\n\niOS: 4.9 with 7,000+ ratings\n\nAndroid: 4.4 with 1,200+ ratings\n\nG2: 4.6 with 100+ reviews\n\n6. eVoice: Best for teams with limited phone needs\n\nPros\n\nAvailable on iOS and Android\n\nInbound online faxing available\n\nCons\n\nLimited numbers are available for each account\n\nSMS/MMS messaging costs extra\n\nConfusing feature add-on options\n\nCall recordings are only stored for 30 days\n\nApps are updated infrequently\n\neVoice provides virtual phone and live receptionist services to small businesses of all kinds. The eVoice app is currently compatible with iOS and Android.\n\neVoice is affordably priced, but it comes with several drawbacks you should consider. It doesn’t appear to have shared numbers or integrations, which means your team will lose business context quickly and might struggle to stay on the same page.\n\nKey features like business texting, call recording, and voicemail transcriptions are only available as add-on features, and it’s unclear from their website how much these additional features cost.\n\nBottom line: eVoice is fine for solo businesses, but it’s inefficient as you add more people to your team.\n\nKey features of eVoice\n\nCall forwarding after hours\n\nInbound caller ID screening\n\nUnlimited calls\n\nCall queuing\n\nSequential ringing\n\neVoice pricing\n\neVoice offers a single plan to businesses for $12 per month to access all its features.\n\nWhat’s missing from this pricing is eVoice’s numerous add-ons, including call recording, voicemail transcription, business texting, and more.\n\neVoice user ratings\n\niOS: 3.7 with 490+ ratings\n\nAndroid: 3.7 with 1,600+ ratings\n\n7. Sideline: Best if you only need one additional number\n\nPros\n\nSMS and MMS messaging\n\nAuto-replies available\n\nCons\n\nNo shared numbers\n\nNo call recording\n\nAuto-attendant available only on the Enterprise plan\n\nInternational calling available only on the Enterprise plan\n\nNo Slack, Zapier, or CRM integrations\n\nSideline provides lean functionality with its business phone services. Both desktop and mobile apps allow users to access call logs across devices. SMS texting capabilities are perhaps its most notable business solution. You can’t get all its features on a single plan, though — and you’ll have to compromise to get what you want.\n\nKeep in mind that while Sideline is a second number app, it isn’t a VoIP service. This platform requires you to have a pre-existing phone service to take and place calls. You’ll need to pay for their services as well as a traditional phone carrier.\n\nKey features of Sideline\n\nGroup messaging\n\nCall announcement software\n\nWiFi calling\n\nAuto-replies\n\nMobile app downloads\n\nFree and unlimited calls (US only)\n\nSideline pricing\n\nSideline’s plans are buried in their support center. Here’s how much each plan costs:\n\nStandard: $10.84 per month, billed annually to access free calling and texting to the US, auto-replies, voicemail to text, group messaging, and number porting\n\nEnterprise: $14.49 per business line per month to access international calling and auto-attendant features\n\nSideline user ratings\n\niOS: 4.3 with 1,200+ ratings\n\nAndroid: 3.9 with 6,200+ ratings\n\n8. GoDaddy Conversations: Best for managing Facebook Messenger and Instagram chats\n\nPros\n\nManage text and email conversations\n\nManage conversations from Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram\n\nCons\n\nNo international calling\n\nNo call recording, call summaries, or call transcriptions\n\nOnly one business number available\n\nNo Slack, Zapier, or CRM integrations\n\nNo auto-attendant features\n\nGoDaddy Conversations is a virtual phone number app that lets you communicate with your customers through channels like Facebook, Instagram, chat, or your web contact form — from one unified system. Conversations replaces Smartline, GoDaddy’s previous business phone number app.\n\nWhile GoDaddy Conversations makes messaging across social media platforms easier, the solution lacks many essential features customer support teams need to thrive. For example, it doesn’t offer shared numbers, call recording, an auto-attendant, group calling, or international calling.\n\nIt also only provides users with one business phone number, limiting fast-growing teams that need multiple numbers for different departments or locations.\n\nKey features of GoDaddy Conversations\n\nUnified inbox\n\nSet business hours\n\nSMS and MMS messaging\n\nCustom voicemail options\n\nGoDaddy Conversations pricing\n\nConversations offers the same features in each of its plans. The difference is you can choose to get a local or a toll-free number (toll-free numbers don’t charge customers when they call or message your team).\n\nLocal Number: $12.99 per month\n\nToll-free Number: $16.99 per month\n\nGoDaddy Conversations user ratings\n\niOS: 4.4 with 1,800+ ratings\n\nAndroid: 3.8 with 600+ ratings\n\nHow we ranked the best business phone number apps\n\nWe determined the top options after reviewing the following key factors across each app:\n\nReliability — Call drops and system outages are dealbreakers.\n\nBang for your buck — What value does the app generate for your business? The cheapest option is usually not the best app. You need a system that saves your team time and has predictable monthly costs.\n\nThird-party integrations — Speaking of saving time, integrations can help your team cut repetitive tasks out of their daily responsibilities.\n\nLow learning curves — Customizing your phone settings and getting team members up and running shouldn’t take hours. The best business number apps have intuitive interfaces that aren’t taxing to operate if you’ve ever used a smartphone.\n\nCustomer service — If questions come up and you don’t see your question addressed in the Help Center, you need a support team that’s responsive.\n\n5 signs you need to get a business phone number app\n\nWe’ve covered the top eight apps, but how do you know when you actually need a business phone number app? Here are five signs your team is ready to get one:\n\nYour team is growing fast: You can get by without a business phone solution when you’re a one-person team.

Business hours helps you send an auto-reply or voicemail to customers who try to reach you when you’re offline.

Business phone number apps let you keep your tech stack lean so you don’t have to constantly switch contexts.\n\nYou want to take repetitive tasks off your team’s plate: Your team shouldn’t get bogged down in work that doesn’t move the needle.
