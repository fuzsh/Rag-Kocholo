        "text": "There are several different Microsoft 365 license types and choosing the correct Microsoft 365 licensing is an important step for every business, especially organizations in the cloud. Microsoft offers tiered solutions for small, medium, and enterprise sized businesses. While this allows companies to right-size licensing to their specific needs, it can also create confusion about which license is the right one. This blog will highlight the difference between Office 365 and Microsoft 365 products so you can make an informed decision.\n\nLearn more about:\n\nMicrosoft Licensing Changes in 2022 - The New Commerce Experience\n\nMicrosoft Government Licensing\n\nOffice 365 Educational Licensing\n\nMicrosoft GCC and GCC High Licensing\n\nMicrosoft Front Line Worker (F1 & F3) Licensing\n\nPrice Comparison for Microsoft Office 365 Business Plans and Enterprise Licenses\n\nWhen comparing Microsoft 365 license types, price is understandably one of the first considerations for decision-makers, with core capabilities as a close second. As of April 1st, 2024, Microsoft Teams is no longer included in Microsoft 365 and Office 365 licensing but is available as a standalone purchase. Below are the prices* for Microsoft 365 Business, Microsoft 365 Enterprise, and Office 365 Enterprise licenses.\n\nMicrosoft Licensing PlanPrice Per User Per MonthMicrosoft 365 E5 (no Teams)$54.80Microsoft 365 E3 (no Teams)$33.80Microsoft 365 F3 (no Teams)$7.50Microsoft 365 F1 (no Teams)$1.75Microsoft 365 Business Basic (no Teams)$4.80Microsoft 365 Business Standard (no Teams)$10.30Microsoft 365 Business Premium (no Teams)$19.80Microsoft 365 Apps for business$8.30Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise$12.00Office 365 E1 (no Teams)$7.80Office 365 E3 (no Teams)$20.80Office 365 E5 (no Teams)$35.80Office 365 F3 (no Teams)$3.50\n\nPrices assume a monthly payment with an annual agreement. Month-to-month licenses are available at a premium. Read more at Microsoft New Commerce Experience.\n\nThe base price per user for Microsoft 365 Business and Enterprise Plans ranges from $4.80 to $54.80, and that can quickly add up for larger organizations. However, companies that utilize capabilities such as Rights Management or cloud PBX may save money by bundling these services into their licensing. Cost savings can be significant for businesses that purchase third party tools for Anti-Virus, eDiscovery, MFA, or SIEM.\n\nHow Microsoft 365 Enterprise, Microsoft 365 Business, and Office 365 Enterprise Plans Differ\n\nMany people use Microsoft 365 and Office 365 interchangeably; however, these are markedly different products. Office 365 is Microsoftâs productivity suite and includes the core applications most think of when they think of Microsoft: Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more. It is also only one of three suites within a Microsoft 365 license.\n\nMicrosoft 365 licenses are available as Enterprise, Business, or Apps licenses. Microsoft 365 Enterprise licenses bundle three suitesâOffice 365, Enterprise Mobility and Security, and Windows Enterpriseâat different levels (E5, E3, F3, F1). Some Microsoft 365 Business licenses include all three suites but are more limited in features. Additionally, Microsoft 365 Business licenses have a per license cap of 300 users per tenant.\n\nNote: We strongly discourage purchasing Microsoft 365 or Office 365 from GoDaddy due to hidden costs, and lack of feature availability. To learn more, read our blog on Migrating from GoDaddy Office 365 to Microsoft Office 365.\n\nJump to:\n\nMicrosoft 365 Enterprise\n\nMicrosoft 365 Frontline Licenses\n\nMicrosoft 365 Business Licenses\n\nMicrosoft 365 Apps Licenses\n\nOffice 365 Enterprise Licenses\n\nMicrosoft 365 Enterprise Licenses\n\nMicrosoft 365 Enterprise is a suite that includes Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and Security, and Windows Enterprise. Microsoft 365 Enterprise gives you the enterprise security and compliance features you need, while providing cost savings through vendor consolidation, reduced management, and training overhead.\n\nMicrosoft 365 E5\n\nDue to its cost, the Microsoft 365 E5 license is often positioned as a luxury license for companies that want advanced security and compliance capabilities, along with automated features. The reality is that most IT teams are overworked and understaffed, at a time when cyberattacks are increasing exponentially.\n\nEven if employees arenât working from home, internet connectivity makes every company a potential global target and enables intellectual property to flow freely out of any unsecured environment. IT personnel are tasked with supporting business critical operations and protecting the organization from external and internal threat actors, a responsibility thatâs only getting more challenging with shrinking budgets and workforce reductions.\n\nAt a minimum, we recommend having Microsoft 365 E5 licenses in place for anyone with far-reaching environment access, but strongly encourage companies to consider the business impact a breach will impose when, not if, one occurs.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$54.80/license/monthWho Itâs ForEnterprises looking for the most complete productivity and security solution available.\n\nWhat Youâll GetAI and rules-based automatic retention policies in Teams, Outlook, SharePoint, OneDriveAutomatic sensitivity labeling in Microsoft 365 apps, Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDriveAzure Virtual DesktopCloud user self-service password change and reset and hybrid user on-premises write-backCompliance Manager with Premium RegulationsDLP for Teams chat, emails and files, and endpointsMicrosoft Advanced Threat AnalyticsMicrosoft Defender XDR Full SuiteMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management and Information BarriersMobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM)Privileged Access Management and Privileged Identity ManagementRisk Based Conditional Access / Identity ProtectionSecure Score, Advanced Security Reports, and Access ReviewsSensitivity labels based on advanced classifiers (e.g., Trainable Classifiers, EDM, Named Entities, Contextual)User Provisioning including Windows Autopilot and Single sign-on (SSO)Windows AutopatchWindows Information ProtectionAzure Information Protection Plan 2Desktop client appsExchange Plan 2 (100 GB mailbox + up to 1.5 TB archive)Microsoft Entra ID P2Microsoft Intune Plan 1Power BI ProSharePoint Plan 2 (1+ TB OneDrive storage)\n\nMicrosoft 365 E3\n\nCompared to the Microsoft 365 E5 license, the Microsoft 365 E3 maintains a similar level of productivity features and allocated storage; however, it lacks machine-learning and automated security capabilities.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$33.80/license/monthWho Itâs ForEmployees who want the best in productivity and collaboration and administrators who want to be assured they are operating in a secure and compliant environment.\n\nWhat Youâll GetAzure Virtual DesktopCloud user self-service password change and reset and hybrid user on-premises write-backCompliance ManagerConditional AccessDLP for emails and filesManual retention labelsMicrosoft Advanced Threat AnalyticsMobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM)Secure Score and Advanced Security ReportsUser Provisioning including Windows Autopilot and Single sign-on (SSO)Windows AutopatchWindows Information ProtectionAzure Information Protection Plan 1Desktop client appsExchange Plan 2 (100 GB mailbox + up to 1.5 TB archive)Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps DiscoveryMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1Microsoft Entra ID P1Microsoft Intune Plan 1SharePoint Plan 2 (1+ TB OneDrive storage)\n\nMicrosoft 365 Frontline Licenses\n\nMicrosoftâs Frontline licensing is an alternative for users that need to have a digital presence in the tenant but are not but are not spending their days creating or consuming data within the environment. Frontline users may not work at a desk, but still have matching security and compliance requirements. For organizations with regulatory requirements, the Microsoft 365 F5 Security and Compliance Add-On brings the security and compliance allotments in line with a Microsoft 365 E5 license while maintaining reduced productivity capabilities and storage capacity.\n\nMicrosoft 365 F3\n\nThe Microsoft 365 F3 comes close to matching the Enterprise Mobility and Security E3 suite (notable losses include Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and DLP for emails and files) but has deprecated productivity applications and reduced storage allocations.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$7.50/license/monthWho Itâs ForEnterprises with a variety of productivity use cases but an unchanging security mandate.\n\nWhat Youâll GetAzure Virtual DesktopCloud user self-service password change and reset and hybrid user on-premises write-backCompliance ManagerConditional AccessManual retention labelsMicrosoft Advanced Threat AnalyticsMobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM)Secure Score and Advanced Security ReportsUser Provisioning including Windows Autopilot and Single sign-on (SSO)Windows AutopatchWindows Information ProtectionAzure Information Protection Plan 1Microsoft 365 for mobile and the web (no desktop apps)Exchange Kiosk (2 GB mailbox)Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps DiscoveryMicrosoft Entra ID P1Microsoft Intune Plan 1SharePoint Kiosk (2 GB OneDrive storage)\n\nMicrosoft 365 F1\n\nAs noted above, the biggest difference between a Frontline and Enterprise license is the deprecated productivity applications and reduced storage allocations. The Microsoft 365 F1 takes that up a notch by dropping down from the Microsoft 365 F3âs web and mobile only applications to read-only versions of web and mobile. Note that neither Microsoft 365 F3 or F1 supports desktop applications.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$1.75/license/monthWho Itâs ForEnterprises with a variety of productivity use cases but an unchanging security mandate.\n\nWhat Youâll GetAzure Information Protection Plan 1Cloud user self-service password change and reset and hybrid user on-premises write-backCompliance ManagerConditional AccessExchange Kiosk (2 GB mailbox)Manual retention labelsMicrosoft 365 for mobile and the web - read onlyMicrosoft Advanced Threat AnalyticsMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps DiscoveryMicrosoft Entra ID P1Microsoft Intune Plan 1Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM)Secure Score and Advanced Security ReportsSharePoint Kiosk (2 GB OneDrive storage)User Provisioning including Windows Autopilot and Single sign-on (SSO)\n\nMicrosoft 365 Business Licenses\n\nMicrosoft 365 Business plans were created for small businesses that might not need all of the features of an Enterprise level license. While Enterprise licenses have no seat limitations, Microsoft 365 Business has a per license cap of 300 users per tenant.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Business Premium (No Teams)\n\nThe most powerful Microsoft Business license without going full enterprise, the Microsoft 365 Business Premium license includes business specific versions of Microsoft Defender and Windows 11. It also includes Intune, for organizations looking to leverage that capability specifically. While it does not include the full Enterprise Mobility and Security E3 product suite, it comes close.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$19.75/license/monthWho Itâs ForBusinesses with fewer than 300 users that need stronger security and compliance tools, but not the full Enterprise Mobility and Security (EMS) suite.\n\nWhat Youâll GetAzure Virtual DesktopCloud user self-service password change and reset and hybrid user on-premises write-backCompliance ManagerConditional AccessDLP for emails and filesManual retention labelsMobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM)Secure ScoreUser Provisioning including Windows Autopilot and Single sign-on (SSO)Windows Information ProtectionAzure Information Protection Plan 1Desktop client appsExchange Plan 1 (50 GB mailbox + 50 GB archive)Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps DiscoveryMicrosoft Defender for BusinessMicrosoft Entra ID P1Microsoft Intune Plan 1SharePoint Plan 1 (1 TB OneDrive storage)Windows 11 Business\n\nMicrosoft 365 Business Standard (No Teams)\n\nFormerly Office 365 Business Premium, Microsoft 365 Business Standard adds critical small business tools such as desktop applications and email. It does not stack up security wise to Business Premium.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$10.25/license/monthWho Itâs ForBusinesses with fewer than 300 users that need the latest desktop versions of Office applications, cloud services, and email hosting alongside small business applications.\n\nWhat Youâll GetDesktop client appsExchange Plan 1 (50 GB mailbox + 50 GB archive)SharePoint Plan 1 (1 TB OneDrive storage)Cloud user self-service password change and resetCompliance ManagerExchange Online ProtectionMobile Device Management (MDM)Secure ScoreUser Provisioning including Windows Autopilot and Single sign-on (SSO)\n\nMicrosoft 365 Business Basic (No Teams)\n\nMicrosoft 365 Business Basic is one of the few lower-tier licenses that includes Exchange Online Plan 1, which can make this an ideal choice for frontline users that donât work at a desk but send a lot of email.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$4.75/license/monthWho Itâs ForCompanies with fewer than 300 users that donât rely heavily on Office 365 applications, online storage, and who do not need desktop applications\n\nWhat Youâll GetCloud user self-service password change and resetCompliance ManagerExchange Online ProtectionExchange Plan 1 (50 GB mailbox + 50 GB archive)Mobile Device Management (MDM)Secure ScoreSharePoint Plan 1 (1 TB OneDrive storage)User Provisioning including Windows Autopilot and Single sign-on (SSO)\n\nMicrosoft 365 Apps Licenses\n\nThe Microsoft 365 Apps licenses are stripped down to the Office 365 suite Microsoft is known for. Unlike perpetual versions of the Office 365 suite, these subscription offerings ensure all applications will always be up-to-date and supported.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Apps for Enterprise\n\nFormerly known as Office 365 ProPlus, Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise is built for enterprise customers. In addition to automatically updated version of the core Microsoft 365 desktop apps (Outlook and Teams excluded), it includes greater security and compliance features, as well as increased deployment and management controls than its Microsoft 365 Apps for Business counterpart. Large organizations leveraging non-Microsoft vendors for communication and collaboration may choose this, along with small to medium organizations that want higher levels of IT control than the Microsoft 365 Apps for Business license supports.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$12 / license /monthWho Itâs ForUsers that rely heavily on Office 365 applications (email hosting and Teams not included) and require compliance and basic business intelligence\n\nWhat Youâll GetDelveMicrosoft 365 Mobile AppMicrosoft FormsMicrosoft WhiteboardOffice Add-in SupportOffice Applications (PC & Mac)Office Cloud Policy ServiceOffice for the Web (Visio included)Office Group Policy SupportOffice TelemetryOneDrive for Business Plan 1Roaming SettingsShared Computer ActivationSwayVirtual Desktop Use Rights\n\nMicrosoft 365 Apps for Business\n\nPreviously named Office 365 Business, Microsoft 365 Apps for Business provides a maximum of 300 users automatically updated editions of the commonly used Office desktop applications (sans Outlook or Teams), but without any of the additional security, communication, or administrative capabilities in Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$8. 30 / license /monthWho Itâs ForBusinesses with fewer than 300 users that only need Office applications, cloud file storage, and sharing (email hosting and Teams not included)\n\nWhat Youâll GetMicrosoft 365 Mobile AppMicrosoft FormsOffice Applications (PC & Mac)Office for the Web (Visio included)OneDrive for Business Plan 1\n\nOffice 365 Enterprise Licenses\n\nOffice 365 Enterprise is Microsoftâs productivity suite and includes the core applications most think of when they think of Microsoft: Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more. It is also only one of three suites included in a Microsoft 365 license. Unlike Microsoft 365 Enterprise licenses, which bundle three suitesâOffice 365, Enterprise Mobility and Security, and Windows EnterpriseâOffice 365 Enterprise licenses lack the security and operating system tiers.\n\nOffice 365 Enterprise E5 (No Teams)\n\nThe Office 365 E5 license includes the highest level of Microsoftâs productivity capabilities, without the security and operating systems components of the Microsoft 365 E5 license. Organizations that are leveraging other vendors or services to cover those bases may find this license appealing.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$3 5.80 / license /monthWho Itâs ForFull productivity suite without added security or compliance capabilities .\n\nWhat Youâll GetAI and rules-based automatic retention policies in Outlook, SharePoint , OneDriveAutomatic sensitivity labeling in Microsoft 365 apps, Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDriveCloud user self-service password change and reset and hybrid user on-premises write-backCompliance ManagerDLP for emails and filesMobile Device Management (MDM)Privileged Access ManagementSecure ScoreSensitivity labels based on advanced classifiers (e.g., Trainable Classifiers, EDM, Named Entities, Contextual)Desktop client appsExchange Plan 2 (100 GB mailbox + up to 1.5 TB archive)Power BI ProSharePoint Plan 2 (1+ TB OneDrive storage)\n\nOffice 365 Enterprise E3 (No Teams)\n\nOffice 365 E3 maintains a similar level of productivity features and allocated storage as the Office 365 E5, however with less automation features and none of the security features of the Microsoft 365 E3.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$20.80 / license /monthWho Itâs ForBusinesses that need the core of Microsoftâs productivity offerings and donât need the security or compliance capabilities.\n\nWhat Youâll GetCloud user self-service password change and reset and hybrid user on-premises write-backCompliance ManagerDesktop client appsDLP for emails and filesExchange Plan 2 (100 GB mailbox + up to 1.5 TB archive)Manual retention labelsMobile Device Management (MDM)Secure ScoreSharePoint Plan 2 (1+ TB OneDrive storage)User Provisioning including Windows Autopilot and Single sign-on (SSO)\n\nOffice 365 Enterprise E1 (No Teams)\n\nOffice 365 E1 is the least expensive Enterprise license, with a focus on services and minimal productivity (e.g., web only apps). It can be combined with Microsoft 365 Apps for Business or Enterprise.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$ 7.80 / license /monthWho Itâs ForUsers that donât need desktop versions of Outlook or Office applications .\n\nWhat Youâll GetCompliance ManagerExchange Plan 1 (50 GB mailbox + 50 GB archive)Manual retention labelsMobile Device Management (MDM)Secure ScoreSharePoint Plan 1 (1 TB OneDrive storage)User Provisioning including Windows Autopilot and Single sign-on (SSO)\n\nOffice 365 Enterprise F3 (No Teams)\n\nOnly available via CSP, the Office 365 F3 is the lightest Enterprise license available. It does not have any of the security features of a Microsoft 365 F3 license and has very minimal productivity and collaboration capabilities.\n\nThe BasicsPrice$ 3.50 / license /monthWho Itâs ForDesk-less, mobile, line, and floor staff that do not need desktop applications .\n\nWhat Youâll GetCompliance ManagerExchange Kiosk (2 GB mailbox)Manual retention labelsMicrosoft 365 for mobile and the web (no desktop apps)Mobile Device Management (MDM)Secure ScoreSharePoint Kiosk (2 GB OneDrive storage)User Provisioning including Windows Autopilot and Single sign-on (SSO)\n\nSummary\n\nLicensing isnât always a one size fits all and if any of the licenses above donât check all the boxes, reach out to discuss alternative strategies like add-on or standalone licenses. Agile ITâs cloud licensing services make it easy to purchase, transfer, and manage your licenses."
