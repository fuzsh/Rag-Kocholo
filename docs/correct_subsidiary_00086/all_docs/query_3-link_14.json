        "text": "Microsoft Office is how billions of people around the world go to work and school, whether they do it from home, an office, a classroom, or a combination of any of those. This suite of productivity tools is used by people working in 106 languages in nearly every country in the world, and it’s available in versions for personal, small business, enterprise, and educational use.\n\nBut there is more than one way to buy Office — or, rather, to buy the license to use it. There’s the “perpetual” version of Office that’s available as a one-time purchase; the most current version is Office 2021. Then there’s the subscription version that lives in the cloud and for which you pay a monthly or annual fee. When this version was introduced in 2011, Microsoft called it Office 365, later renaming it Microsoft 365 for personal and small business subscriptions. At the enterprise level, both Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans are available. In this story, we’ll use “Microsoft 365” as shorthand for all “365” subscriptions unless we’re referring to a specific plan.\n\nWhy choose to buy it one way and not the other? The answer can be confusing, especially since each suite of tools includes most of the same applications, give or take.\n\nMicrosoft has made its preference clear: The company believes that “the cloud will power the work of the future” and would love it if everyone purchased Microsoft 365. There are lots of incentives for doing just that. But you have options.\n\nOffice 2021 vs. Microsoft 365: What to consider\n\nMicrosoft Office plans and pricing\n\nHow you pay for Office\n\nHow each version of Office is serviced\n\nHow Office hooks up with cloud services\n\nHere’s help deciding which version of Office is right for you or your company.\n\nMicrosoft Office: The options\n\nFor personal use\n\nOffice Home & Student 2021: $150, one-time purchase for use on one computer; includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Personal: $70 a year or $7 a month (1 user, multiple devices); includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, OneDrive, and Teams.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Family: $100 a year or $10 a month (6 users, multiple devices); includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneDrive, Teams, and Family Safety.\n\nFor small businesses\n\nOffice Home & Business 2021: $250, one-time purchase for use on one computer; includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.\n\nOffice Professional 2021: $440, one-time purchase for use on one computer; includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Publisher, and Access; works with Teams.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Apps for business: $8.25/user/month (up to 300 users); includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneDrive, Publisher, and Access.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Business Basic, Standard, and Premium: plans range from $6/user/month to $22/user/month (up to 300 users); tools included depend on the level of your subscription. Desktop versions of Word, Excel, and other Office apps require a Standard plan or higher; the Basic plan offers only web and mobile versions. All plans include Exchange email hosting, OneDrive, and SharePoint. The Premium plan adds advanced security and management features.\n\nFor enterprises\n\nOffice LTSC 2021: available only through volume licensing; this Office title stands for Long Term Servicing Channel — it’s the commercial version of Office 2021. According to Microsoft, it’s designed for regulated devices that can’t accept updates for security reasons and for systems that don’t connect to the internet. (Note, however, that it’s the only non-subscription version of Office available for large organizations.) Includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Access, and Publisher.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Apps for enterprise: $12/user/month (up to 5 devices per user); annual commitment required; includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, OneDrive, OneNote, Access, and Publisher.\n\nOffice 365 E1, E3, and E5: plans range from $10/user/month to $38/user/month; annual commitment required; tools included depend on the level of your subscription. Desktop versions of Word, Excel, and other Office apps require an E3 plan or higher; the E1 plan offers only web and mobile versions. All plans include Exchange Online, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, and additional enterprise services. The E5 plan adds advanced security, compliance, and management features.\n\nMicrosoft 365 E3 and E5: plans range from $36/user/month to $57/user/month; annual commitment required; these plans offer most of the same features as the Office 365 E3 and E5 plans, and also include Windows and additional Microsoft services such as Visio.\n\nOther plans: Microsoft offers additional Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans for education, government, and nonprofit organizations, and for frontline workers.\n\nHow you pay for Office\n\nOne big difference between the “2021” and “365” options is how you pay for them. If you are buying a “perpetual license” (such as with Office Home & Business 2021 or Office LTSC 2021), you pay a larger sum than with the subscription’s offerings under the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 brand, but you do so only once. When you subscribe to any of the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 plans, you pay annually or monthly."
