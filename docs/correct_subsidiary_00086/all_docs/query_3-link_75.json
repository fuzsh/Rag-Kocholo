However, Microsoft TechNet states:\n\nThis setting specifies whether mobile devices that may not support application of all policy settings are allowed to connect to Exchange by using Exchange ActiveSync. Allowing non-provisionable mobile devices has security implications. For example, some non-provisionable devices may not be able to implement an organizationâ€™s password requirements.\n\nThe recommended practice is to not allow non-provisionable mobile devices in your default mobile device mailbox policy.\n\nIf you do have specific devices or applications that you want to allow as exceptions to that rule, create a second mobile device mailbox policy that is not the default policy, and assign that to approved users on a case by case basis."
