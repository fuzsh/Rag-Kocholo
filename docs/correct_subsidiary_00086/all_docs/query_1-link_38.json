        "text": "Autopay\n\nAutopay is a convenient way of making your monthly mortgage payments. Once set up, your payments will be automatically deducted every month from your checking or savings account on the date that you choose. We can help you manage automatic payments, whether you’re setting up or changing existing information.\n\nOnline banking steps\n\nFor customers with a U.S. Bank demand deposit account (DDA):\n\nFor the best online banking experience, we recommend logging in at usbank.com.\n\nChoose your mortgage account listed under Accounts on the customer dashboard.\n\nChoose Set up & edit autopay on the mortgage account dashboard.\n\nYour payment information will be listed.\n\nTo Set Up: Choose Enroll in autopay and enter the required information, then choose the checkbox if you agree to the terms and select Enroll.\n\nTo Edit: Select Payment information, then select Modify settings. Edit the desired information, then select the checkbox if you agree to the terms and select Update.\n\nTo Unenroll: Select Unenroll from autopay, then confirm Yes or No.\n\nOnce the process is complete you will be given a confirmation date of when your draft will be activated.\n\nU.S. Bank Mobile App steps\n\nFor the best mobile banking experience, we recommend logging in or downloading the U.S. Bank Mobile App.\n\nChoose your mortgage account from the main dashboard.\n\nIf you have a U.S. Bank demand deposit account (DDA), choose View & manage my account.\n\nIf you only have a U.S. Bank mortgage, choose View, pay & manage my account.\n\nYour payment information will be listed.\n\nTo Set Up: Choose Enroll in autopay and enter the required information, then select the checkbox if you agree to the terms and select Enroll.\n\nTo Edit: Choose Payment information, then select Modify settings. Edit the desired information, then select the checkbox if you agree to the terms and select Update.\n\nTo Unenroll: Choose Unenroll from autopay, then confirm Yes or No.\n\nOnce the process is complete, you’ll receive a confirmation date of when your draft will be activated.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nPlease have your checking account and routing number for this process. Once a checking or savings account is entered for payment, it will be saved in the site. You will not be able to enroll in or modify autopay if the account is past due. This information may be unavailable if the account is past due.\n\nYou’ll be notified by mail when the first payment is drawn. If your debit lands on a holiday or weekend, we’ll credit your loan the following business day. Otherwise, payments are posted the same day.\n\nFor assistance from a customer service representative, call 800-365-7772 Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. CT and Saturday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. CT.\n\nPay by phone\n\nYou could choose to make your monthly mortgage payment by phone either through our automated voice response system or with the help of a customer service representative. For payments made by phone, we credit the payment the same day (the next day if made on a weekend or holiday).\n\nCall 800-365-7772 to make a payment by phone. You’ll be asked to provide your checking or savings account number and your bank’s routing number. Your mortgage payment will be electronically drafted from your loan the same day.\n\nPay by mail\n\nIf you choose to pay your monthly mortgage amount by mail, U.S. Bank Home Mortgage will send you a monthly billing statement with a payment slip. Detach the payment slip and mail it back, with your payment, in the enclosed envelope. Include your mortgage loan number on your check.\n\nFor overnight deliveries, please send your payment to:\n\nU.S. Bank Home Mortgage\n\nATTN: Payment Processing\n\n3751 Airpark Drive\n\nOwensboro, KY 42301\n\nWe’ll apply your payment on the day it’s received. We don’t consider the postmark date or adjust for mail delays. Therefore, please allow at least seven business days for mailing. Allow 10 or more days during holidays and other high-volume mailing times, such as tax season.\n\nFor a hassle-free payment method, choose autopay. It’s easy to set up, and you could schedule automatic payments without worrying about any checks, stamps or mailing delays.\n\nBranch payments\n\nYou can also make your mortgage payments at any U.S Bank branch. Please have your billing statement available when making a payment.\n\nWe generally credit any payments made at the branch the same day. However, some branches convert their systems to begin processes for the next day earlier than online, typically around 4 p.m. local time. Branches post any payment made after their conversion time the following business day. Also, some branches do not have the capability of posting a mortgage payment directly. These branches must forward payments to mortgage servicing. These payments may also post the following business day. Your receipt will indicate if your payment won’t be posted until the following business day."
