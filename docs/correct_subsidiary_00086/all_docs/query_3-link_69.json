Wearing a personal alarm means they can summon help, and speak directly with a trained member of a 24/7 care team, or a designated contact. Motion sensors in-built to some alarms will automatically detect a fall and trigger the alarm if the wearer is unable to do so themselves.\n\nPersonal alarms are constantly evolving and the choice is wide: from simple alarms connected via the landline for use in the home, to mobile/digital alarms with a range of features that work wherever there is a mobile signal.\n\nTo choose the most suitable personal alarm, we have compiled the main considerations for you here:\n\n1. Do you need it to work everywhere?\n\nWhere will the personal alarm be used? If you want an alarm that will work both in the home and when the wearer is out in town or on walks alone, then you will need a mobile alarm like the SureSafeGO, Companion Watch or Taking Care Anywhere.\n\nIf the alarm will only be used at home, and the wearer can speak, possibly at a distance, through the base unit, then an in-home alarm is all that is needed. Here we recommend the Careline SmartLife or Telecare24 Fall Plan.\n\nIf you’re not sure then it is safer to go with a mobile alarm that will work everywhere.\n\n2. Talk through the alarm or base unit?\n\nMobile alarms allow the wearer to talk to the monitoring team directly through the pendant or watch. This is an important feature when the wearer is either away from the home, or if they fall in or around the home but out of speaking range of the base unit. These alarms include the SureSafeGO, Companion Watch or Taking Care Anywhere.\n\nIn-home alarms are a more waterproof, smaller and cheaper option however, the wearer needs to be able to communicate with the monitoring team through a base unit, plugged into the wall in the home. The microphone in the base unit is sensitive and the call centre teams speak clearly and loudly and are trained to speak with wearers who may have fallen some way from the base unit. If they can’t hear the wearer after an alert is sounded they can call a neighbour or family member to go round to make sure all is well. The following alarms work like this: Careline SmartLife or Telecare24 Fall Plan.\n\n3. Landline, mobile signal or Wi-Fi connection?\n\nDifferent personal alarms use different methods to connect user to monitoring team.\n\nMobile alarms use SIM cards (like a mobile phone), and in-home alarms either use a landline or a digital connection.\n\nWe recommend choosing your preferred alarm first and talking with your chosen provider to determine how best to set up that alarm in your home.\n\n4.

Payment options and value for money\n\nMost providers have a few ways for you to buy your alarm and different ways to break down the costs.\n\n24/7 Monitoring requires a monthly payment of between £10-£20. In some cases you can pay for this in one annual payment that can save you money in the long run.\n\nMost providers have a one-off set-up fee that covers postage and setting up the device and emergency contacts on their systems. This is between £30 and £70.\n\nRented devices come with no initial cost, although you will have to return it when it is no longer in use. Purchased ones will come with an initial fee to buy the device. This won’t include any further monitoring costs.\n\nFinally, some providers offer extras that can be added to your plan including automatic fall detection, wellness monitoring and notifications, additional app features, keysafes and more.\n\nYou can save money when buying annually\n\nExample: Telecare24’s Fall Alarm Plans\n\nTelecare24 provides options to pay either monthly or annually.\n\nPay monthly from £24/month or...\n\nPay annually working out to £19/month (save £60)\n\n6. Automatic Fall Detection\n\nAutomatic fall detection refers to the ability for the wearable device to detect when a fall has occurred, sending out an alert without the wearer needing to press the SOS button. All the alarms on our list include automatic fall detection (the Careline Smartlife for an additonal £4 / month).\n\n7. Type of monitoring\n\nWhen the SOS pendant is pressed on most personal alarms, the alert goes to a 24/7 monitoring centre, where a trained team member will contact with the wearer through the pendant to understand what is wrong and resolve the situation. This means that help is available whatever time of day or night.\n\nAnother option is to agree a list of priority contacts who receive the alarm notification. This avoids paying for the monthly monitoring but does put the onus on the family contacts to be available to answer the call.\n\nThe SureSafeGO is available in both 24/7 monitored and family monitored options. The Companion Watch is only family monitored. All other options on this page are only available as 24/7 monitored.\n\n24/7 Monitored Personal Alarm\n\nTrained monitoring response team available 24/7\n\nMonthly monitoring cost needed\n\nNo app or visibility of location or health data\n\nTop Pick\n\nTaking Care Anywhere\n\nFriends & Family Monitored Alarm\n\nWatch cycles through emergency contacts until answered\n\nMonthly costs to cover SIM usage\n\nApp allows overview of GPS location and health data\n\nTop Pick\n\nCompanion Watch\n\n8. How will they wear it?\n\nMost personal alarms have a few options when it comes to wearing them. They can be worn around the neck as a pendant, on the wrist like a watch, clipped to a belt or attached to a keychain.\n\nOne important consideration is that some mobile alarms can not be worn around the neck if the wearer has a pace maker, however they do have other wearing options.\n\nWritten by\n\nBen Steel\n\nThis information on this page was\n\nresearched and written by Ben, our in-house elderly technology expert.\n\nHe consulted both information on each device found online, his own experience with the device and the thoughts and experience of our panel of over 70s reviewers with each device.\n\nUK Providers\n\nThere are many providers of personal alarms for the elderly across the UK. Below you can click to learn more about each provider and the other products they offer.\n\nFAQs on buying a personal alarm for elderly relatives\n\nQ. How do personal alarms work?\n\nA. There are many different types of personal alarms but the idea is similar for each one. Your older relative wears a simple button pendant all the time that they can press to alert someone that they need help. A personal alarm can work anywhere (mobile) or only in the house (landline-based), include extra features (e.g. GPS or fall detection), or be answered by either a trained, 24/7-available response team or a trusted family member.\n\nQ. How does the digital switchover affect buying a personal alarm\n\nA. The Digital Switchover is a planned switching of all home phone lines from analogue to digital by 2025. For households with an analogue personal alarm – one that uses a landline – there will be changes for it to be able to work. You can learn more about the digital switchover in our simple guide.\n\nQ. What is the difference between a mobile and a landline-based personal alarm?\n\nA. Elderly alarms are designed to be as simple as possible to set-up and use and are either mobile or landline-based. If a personal alarm is mobile it means there will be a SIM card (exactly like those used in phones) inside that allows the pendant to work wherever there is a mobile signal. This means that your relative can wear it in the garden or when they are out and about, safe in the knowledge that if they fall or get lost, they can press the button and get help.\n\nLandline-based personal alarms are usually smaller, simpler to use, and cheaper, but will only work a certain distance from a ‘base unit’, plugged into the landline (i.e. within the house). When your relative presses the alarm button the monitoring team will only be able to talk to them through the base unit.\n\nBoth types of alarm are better at different things. Mobile alarms have more additional features, (sometimes) enable communication directly through the pendant, and work anywhere but landline alarms can be more reliable (as they almost always have signal), easier to use, waterproof, and never require charging\n\nQ. Are all personal alarms monitored?\n\nA. No. While most personal alarm packages include monitoring from a UK-based, 24/7-active trained monitoring centre, you can also find options that alert a family member directly if the emergency call button is pressed. The simplest personal alarms will just make a loud noise that can alert someone living in the same house. These options are less expensive but do rely on someone always being within range of hearing the alarm to provide help.\n\nQ. What should I consider before purchasing a personal alarm?\n\nA. If you’ve decided that a personal alarm would make living independently safer for your elderly parents, and would reassure the family, there is still a lot to consider depending on you and your parent’s circumstance.\n\nFor example: Dementia/wandering:\n\nGPS ability: If your relative is more active or has a dementia meaning they are prone to wander, you will probably need a mobile, GPS-aware personal alarm. This enables you to be able to locate, and get help to, your relative even if they don’t know where they are themselves. Other things that might be included in the price of a personal alarm for elderly parents are the type of monitoring and whether you want to include fall detection (that sends an alert if it detects a fall, even if the button hasn’t been pressed).\n\nQ. How much should a personal alarm for elderly parents cost in the UK?\n\nA. The answer depends on what features are included in the alarm. For a basic emergency call button and landline-based base unit, you can expect to pay between £100 – £250 a year. For a personal alarm with additional features such fall detection and GPS you could pay between £200-500. Other things that might be included in the price of a personal alarm are:\n\n– One-off set-up/installation/registration fees\n\n– Monthly subscription to 24/7 monitoring\n\n– SIM card costs (for mobile personal alarms)\n\nQ. Do I need to pay VAT on a personal alarm?\n\nA. Personal alarms are applicable for VAT exemptions if the person you are buying for has a long-term health condition that they receive medical treatment for, a chronic illness, or they are registered disabled. Advanced age is not enough on its own to qualify someone for VAT exemption. To get a VAT exemption you must prove to the seller that you are eligible – usually they will offer you a form to fill out, or that you can fill out on behalf of the person you are buying for.\n\nQ. Can I get a personal alarm from my local council or authority?\n\nA. Yes, in some places in the UK, local councils supply ‘lifeline alarms’ to those who need them. These are just simple pendant alarms for the elderly with the emergency call button and landline base unit. Some councils pay for it outright or will ask you to make a contribution towards the, depending on your relative’s financial circumstance. Often they will be an option following the result of a care needs assessment.\n\nQ. What happens if the emergency call button is pressed accidentally?\n\nA. Don’t worry, monitoring teams are very used to this happening and won’t be annoyed – just relieved that there is nothing wrong. It is much better for your elderly relative not to be worrying about accidentally pressing the button versus not pressing it if they are in trouble. However, depending on the alarm they have, they might need to recharge the pendant after pressing the emergency call button.\n\nQ. Can my relative still use a personal alarm if they have pacemaker?\n\nA. Your relative may not be able to wear some personal alarms around their neck if they have a pacemaker, as they might interfere with it. This might also mean that they are unable to make use of some features like GPS and/or fall detection, depending on how they work. Always check with the provider if a personal alarm is safe to use before buying.\n\nQ. What is the best personal alarm for someone with Dementia?\n\nA. The SureSafeGO with its friends and family app. Through the app, not only can you track the wearers current location but you can set up ‘geo-fences’ – that means you get a notification to your phone if the alarm leaves a set area. You can ask SureSafe to set-up geo-fences for you.\n\nYou should also consider the Companion Watch as it has the same features but looks like a standard watch, which may be easier to remember to wear.\n\nThe ordering of personal alarms for the elderly on this page does not mean that the top one will be best suited to your family’s needs as different features will be more useful to different people.
