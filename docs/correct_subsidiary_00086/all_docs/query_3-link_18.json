        "text": "We've searched the web to bring you all of this month's best Microsoft Office deals. Even with the rise of Google Workspace and other free office software, there are still those who prefer to use Microsoft's suite of programs for work tasks. If that's you, then we're here to help you save money with a roundup of the cheapest prices for both the subscription-based Microsoft 365 and the full Microsoft Office 2021 package.\n\nAt the basic level, you can get Word, Excel and PowerPoint as part of Microsoft 365 Personal or in the Microsoft Office 2021 Home and Student/Home and Business packages. Deals on those products are the ones we're focusing on right here as they're the cheapest, most useful and most widely used.\n\nIt gets more complicated beyond that, with different subscription tiers including Family, Business and Enterprise that have more specific use cases and different programs - though these are all relatively self-explanatory. Services bundled in include Outlook, OneDrive, Defender, Teams, Editor, Clipchamp, OneNote, Access, Publisher and much more. Microsoft 365 is the ultimate productivity kitchen sink.\n\nYou could buy an Office subscription from Microsoft directly, but it's possible to get a better deal from a reliable third-party retailer. The software is on sale at various times throughout the year, too, such as this month's 4th of July sales in the US and the upcoming Amazon Prime Day sale at the online mega-retailer.\n\nIf you need a device as well, check out today's best laptop deals as many of these include a limited-time subscription for free. We expect to see a few in the 4th of July laptop sales and Amazon Prime Day laptop deals throughout the month.\n\nBuy Microsoft 365 Personal or Family\n\nIf you're looking to buy Microsoft 365, you should know that this is a subscription-based service. The prices below are for your first year for one user to use on one PC, along with a tablet or mobile too (for the Personal one) or up to six users (on the Family bundle).\n\nThe advantages of using Microsoft 365 include having access to all the latest versions of programs in the Microsoft Office suite and having 1TB of online storage, courtesy of one of the best cloud storage providers on the market, OneDrive.\n\nThe latter is particularly useful for editing documents on the go. So you could go from writing on the laptop/desktop to making a few changes or crucial last-minute updates on your mobile or tablet.\n\nIf the online cloud storage and device switching won't be useful, we'd recommend scrolling further down this page and buying Microsoft Office Home and Student 2021 instead for a one-off fee.\n\nBuy Microsoft 365 Business\n\nThere are four different Microsoft 365 business plans as of today. Microsoft says that it changed the name to \"to be more reflective of the range of features and benefits in the subscription. Microsoft 365 includes everything you know in Office 365, including best-in-class Office apps, intelligent cloud services, and advanced security.\"\n\nMicrosoft 365 Business Basic (formerly Office 365 Business Essentials)\n\nMicrosoft 365 Business Standard (formerly Office 365 Business Premium)\n\nMicrosoft 365 Business Premium (formerly Microsoft 365 Business)\n\nMicrosoft 365 Apps for business (formerly Office 365 Business)\n\nBuy Microsoft Home & Student 2021\n\nMicrosoft certainly took its time to give us a new standalone Office package as it's moved its focus to the Microsoft 365 subscription service nowadays. But if you want a modern version of Office with just a simple one-time fee, this is the way to go.\n\nYou don't get the fancier cloud-based features and multi-device support that you do with Microsoft 365, but this can work out much cheaper in the long run.\n\nAs is usually the case, the cheapest option for Office 2021 is the \"Home & Student\" Edition, which comes with a single-user license, allowing you to install the Office suite of apps on one device. It still comes with all the essential Office apps that are suitable for most users' needs: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, Publisher, and OneNote.\n\nYou might also want to check out how to download and use Microsoft Word for free if you'd rather not hand over any cash.\n\nFor other devices, do take a look at the best MacBook deals going right now for the cheapest prices on Apple devices today. You can use Office on your tablet, too, so why not shop the best tablet deals and iPad deals available right now?"
