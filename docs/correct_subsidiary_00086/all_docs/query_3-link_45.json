We use product data, strategic methodologies and expert insights to inform all of our content and guide you in making the best decisions for your business journey.\n\nWe reviewed the leading mobile phone providers in the market using a detailed system to determine the five best cell phone services for small businesses. Pricing was an essential consideration when putting together our list as were the features that each provider offered. We also took into consideration real users’ experiences with the cell phone providers to come up with our final rankings. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nBest Overall Business Cell Phone Plan\n\nRingCentral\n\n4.7\n\nOur ratings are calculated based on fees, rates, rewards and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nStarting price\n\n$24.99 per user, per month\n\nFree hardware available\n\nYes\n\nInternational coverage\n\nYes\n\nLearn More\n\nOn RingCentral's Website\n\n$24.99 per user, per month\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nEditor's Take\n\nRingCentral is a far cry from your traditional business cell phone plan. It does not offer a wireless network or devices for your team. Instead, this VoIP service offers a monthly (or annual) subscription to software you can use from a computer, tablet or smartphone via an app. In most cases, subscribing to RingCentral and having your team log in to the app via their accounts is a lot more affordable than going with one of the big wireless carriers. Therefore, it is our top overall pick for business cell phone plans.\n\nRegardless of which plan you choose, all versions of RingCentral come standard with the following:\n\nUnlimited calls within the United States and Canada\n\nUnlimited business short message service (SMS)\n\nTeam member messaging\n\nVoicemail to text\n\nDocument sharing\n\nToll-free numbers\n\nService plan costs vary depending on how many people you employ. Pricing for two to 20 users on an annual basis is as follows:\n\nEssentials: $24.99 per user, per month with unlimited domestic calling, SMS, document sharing and voicemail-to-text functionality\n\nStandard: $27.99 per user, per month with unlimited fax, video calling for up to 100 people, the ability to adopt a number in more than 100 countries and more\n\nPremium: $39.99 per user, per month with automatic call recording, third-party software integrations and more\n\nUltimate: $54.99 per user, per month with advanced status reports, alerts and unlimited online file storage\n\nRingCentral’s plans offer features that aren’t available through larger carriers. The fact that RingCentral offers toll-free numbers is helpful in commanding a more professional business presence, and features like video calling and faxing are nice bonuses. RingCentral also has an intuitive, modern interface that closely resembles your smartphone’s default phone and texting apps. Once it is installed, you can think of the app as a business phone that lives in your personal phone.\n\nThe only downside with RingCentral as a business cell phone plan is it requires a fair amount of trust. On one end, you will need to consider whether or not you can count on your team members to keep company information secure if the app is installed on their personal devices. Additionally, your staff may not feel comfortable with having their work phone installed onto their smartphones.\n\nWhile the lines between work and home continue to blur, thanks in large part to apps like Slack and Zoom, you might want to evaluate your company culture before moving forward. It’s also worth noting that all of RingCentral’s features can be used on a PC or Mac.\n\nLearn more: Read our full RingCentral review.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nRingCentral’s pricing and features make it a good fit for businesses of every size.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nFree 15-day trial\n\nVery affordable monthly plans\n\nAble to customize service by business size and industry\n\nAvailable across multiple devices\n\nPossible to video conference with up to 200 people\n\nMust upgrade for 24/7 customer support and, even then, it apparently leaves a lot to be desired\n\nPlans get inexplicably more expensive for sole proprietors\n\nCan only rent phones with multi-year contracts\n\nBest for Traditional Plans and VoIP Features\n\nVerizon Wireless\n\n4.6\n\nOur ratings are calculated based on fees, rates, rewards and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nStarting price\n\nPlans as low as $30 per month, per line\n\nFree hardware available\n\nYes\n\nInternational coverage\n\nYes\n\nPlans as low as $30 per month, per line\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nEditor's Take\n\nVerizon is one of the largest carriers in operation, with coverage and services spanning from coast to coast and beyond. The company makes our list as it provides solid cell phone plans for small and large businesses alike. You can choose from one of several subscription options according to what works best for your company.\n\nFlexible Business Wireless Plans\n\nThe Flexible Business Wireless Plan offers unlimited domestic talk and text, unlimited international messaging and a mobile hot spot. It also comes with a shareable data pool for your phones, tablets and other devices. You can even gain access to corporate email services.\n\nWhat makes this plan “flexible” is that you get to choose the amount of data you want to add to your smartphone, tablet or both. The pricing plans vary according to the amount of data you need for your device. Use a handy calculator to determine how much smartphone or tablet data you’ll need to get an idea of your expected monthly price.\n\nBusiness Unlimited Plans\n\nThese Verizon business phone subscriptions provide companies with unlimited talk, text and data through three tier levels: Start. 2.0, Plus 2.0 and Pro 2.0:\n\nBusiness Unlimited Start 5G: As low as $30 per month when you add five or more lines. Includes unlimited talk, text and data; 5G nationwide/4G LTE and call filter\n\nBusiness Unlimited Plus 5G: As low as $40 per month with five or more lines; it includes everything in Start plus 5G Ultra Wideband, 100 GB Premium network access and an unlimited mobile hotspot. The tier also offers Business Mobile Secure, which protects your smartphones against potential security threats.\n\nBusiness Unlimited Pro 5G: As low as $45 per month when you buy five or more lines; offers unlimited Premium Network Access and a 50% discount on Business Unlimited Pro tablet plans\n\nThe monthly plan price fluctuates according to the number of smartphone lines you buy. Although Verizon offers generous price discounts with each tier, smaller businesses might find the pricing plans a bit expensive, even excessive if they don’t need five or more lines.\n\nVerizon lets you bring your own device (BYOD) to the service and even offers discount deals for doing so. However, not every device is compatible, and the brand recommends confirming compatibility before making the switch. Verizon often offers free phones or generous credit, between $200 and $1,000, toward purchasing a new phone.\n\nLike many service providers, Verizon tends to automate customer support to the point where some customers struggle to speak with an actual human. Because it can be hard to talk to anyone, customers often find Verizon’s customer service somewhat lacking. To make up for this, Verizon offers a feature in which an agent will call you when one is available if you don’t feel like waiting on hold.\n\nVerizon represents a more traditional phone plan structure, one with its service easily accessible across the country and via different locations worldwide. As such, even pricing and customer service issues are but minor deterrents. You’re still getting a big carrier plan with coverage in most of the United States and a wide range of service plans and devices to suit your needs.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nVerizon works well for small to large businesses with a healthy budget.\n\nLearn more:\n\nRead our full Verizon Wireless review.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nNationwide coverage\n\nOffers mobile VPN with certain plans\n\nData, calls and texting available to use while in Canada and Mexico\n\nAbility to mix and match plans\n\nCould be overkill for smaller organizations\n\nPlans can get expensive\n\nBest for Sole Proprietors and Freelancers\n\nGoogle Voice\n\n4.6\n\nOur ratings are calculated based on fees, rates, rewards and other category-specific attributes.

Google Voice is a popular virtual phone service that offers call forwarding, voice and text messaging and voicemail options. Best of all, there is a version of the system that is entirely free to use as long as you have a Google Account.\n\nGoogle Voice is popular for offering an impressive set of functionality in its free tier. As long as you have a personal Google Account, you can adopt a local number with nearly any area code in the United States. You can make unlimited domestic calls and texts across the U.S. and Canada from your phone or computer.\n\nBecause Google Voice is a free service, it can be especially useful to a small, cash-strapped business that wants to be able to make and receive calls without committing to pricier service plans offered by AT&T or T-Mobile. Though an existing number is required, once you link it to Google Voice, you’re able to communicate using virtually any device. If your business needs more than what the freeware offers, you can sign up for one of Google Voice’s subscription plans:\n\nBusiness Starter: $10 per user, per month; recommended for entrepreneurs or small businesses with 10 people or less\n\nBusiness Standard: $20 per user, per month; works for businesses of any size\n\nBusiness Premier: $30 per user, per month; aimed at larger, international companies\n\nOnce you upgrade, you can enjoy features such as unlimited domestic calling and text, voicemail transcripts, a “do not disturb” feature linked to your Google Calendar working hours, use and activity reports and 24-hour technical support. Upgrade to Standard or Premier for additional perks, including desk-phone compatibility, auto attendants and eDiscovery for calls, text messages and voicemail.\n\nOverall, Google Voice offers businesses several benefits at either no cost or through very affordable service plans. Even if there are downsides, with the amount of free features, Google Voice is a beneficial service.\n\nLearn more: Read our full Google Voice review.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nGoogle Voice works best for organizations, small and large, that want a business cell phone plan that streamlines their contacts across multiple devices.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nFree version available\n\n14-day trial for paid features\n\nHighly scalable, with service options for businesses of every size and budget\n\nGet a local number\n\nUnlimited calling and SMS\n\nNeed an existing phone number to forward calls\n\nMust have internet/Wi-Fi connection to use\n\nBest for Mobile Security\n\nAT&T Wireless\n\n4.3\n\nOur ratings are calculated based on fees, rates, rewards and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nStarting price\n\n$30 per line, per month\n\nFree hardware available\n\nYes\n\nInternational coverage\n\nYes\n\nLearn More\n\nOn AT&T's Website\n\n$30 per line, per month\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nEditor's Take\n\nWe chose AT&T Wireless as it offers flexible cell phone plan options with plenty of added perks. With AT&T, your company has access to nationwide coverage and a range of plans that come standard with unlimited talk, text and data.\n\nIn addition to domestic coverage, AT&T provides unlimited talk and text from the United States to Canada or Mexico with no roaming fees. Some plan options even extend service options from the U.S. to up to 120 countries. It is crucial to note that some features are only available through devices compatible with AT&T’s service.\n\nYou can choose between one of several business-related subscription plans, priced per month and per smartphone line. AT&T’s best per-line pricing options come with six or more lines.\n\nUnlimited Your Way\n\nAT&T provides unlimited business service plans that let you choose only what you need for team members. There are three tiers available; you can purchase between one and 10 lines with these plans (per the Unlimited Your Way plan group), with per-month pricing fluctuating according to your decision.\n\nBusiness Unlimited Starter: Begins at $30 per month, per line with five or more lines and includes unlimited domestic talk, text and data, and unlimited talk and text to Canada and Mexico; offers access to AT&T’s 5G and 5G+ services on compatible devices where available and standard streaming and mobile security\n\nBusiness Unlimited Performance: Begins at $35 per month, paid per line with five or more lines. It includes everything in Starter, plus advanced mobile security and high-definition streams; each line has access to 30 GB of hotspot data.\n\nBusiness Unlimited Elite: Begins at $45 per month and per line for five or more lines; this plan adds AT&T Business Fast Track, which gives higher priority to your data usage, letting things run smoothly during times of high congestion; the plan gives you 100 GB of hotspot data\n\nAT&T Mobile Select (Pooled)\n\nPerhaps one device needs 5 GB per month while another only needs 2 GB. Pooling data means that each team member only uses a specific amount and your business only pays for exactly what it needs. In addition to pooled data, this plan provides unlimited talk and text. Customers will also get access to Stream Saver, which conserves data when users stream content.\n\nDepending on your device or location, AT&T also offers its Call Protect Basic service. Plans start at $35 per month for 1 GB and increase according to your intended data pool.\n\nAT&T Business 4GB\n\nThis plan option gives your business access to 4 GB of data per line, plus unlimited talk and text. Pricing isn’t as straightforward as it could be. The most affordable plan costs $50 per month, per line, when you buy at least three lines; the service option maxing out at 10 lines. Please note that this price is only guaranteed when you agree to sign up for autopay. This knocks $25 off the price per smartphone line with a service commitment.\n\nAT&T’s Security Features\n\nAT&T offers protection against increasingly common annoyances such as spam and fraud calls, including the ability to block suspicious phone numbers outright. For an additional service charge, AT&T provides its Secure Wi-Fi VPN service through AT&T Mobile Security Plus. The most basic version of this is available free with every plan and includes device security and breach reports. The add-on costs $3.99 per month and comes with a serious upgrade on secure mobile features:\n\nSecure Wi-Fi VPN\n\nPersonal ID monitor\n\nSafe browsing\n\nWi-Fi alerts\n\nTheft alerts (Android devices only)\n\nIf you’re looking for free hardware, AT&T Wireless does offer discounts and deals from time to time, including free phones or generous discounts towards the purchase of a qualifying phone.\n\nAT&T’s business cell phone plans are impressive. Unfortunately, when things get congested, your service quality can drop substantially thanks to data caps and slowed coverage. AT&T often forces customers to upgrade to higher tiers to avoid slowdowns. The company’s plans can also get very expensive when you account for optional add-ons and devices.\n\nAT&T Wireless is one of the larger service carriers, and so it can guarantee coverage and high-quality service to almost all of its customers. That said, its service fees could prove to be too expensive for smaller businesses with very tight budgets.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nAT&T is best for mid to large-size companies with specific data needs and a desire for greater security when communicating or transferring information.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nProvides highly customizable business cell phone plans\n\nNo roaming fees for Canada and Mexico\n\nOffers stellar mobile security add-ons\n\nNo overage charges\n\nData speeds drop when service gets very busy\n\nAdd-ons and premium tiers can make the service pricey\n\nBest for Novel and Unique Features\n\nT-Mobile\n\n4.3\n\nOur ratings are calculated based on fees, rates, rewards and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nStarting price\n\n$25 per line, per month\n\nFree hardware available\n\nYes\n\nInternational coverage\n\nYes\n\n$25 per line, per month\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nEditor's Take\n\nT-Mobile is the third of the three biggest U.S. wireless carriers, after merging with Sprint in 2020. While it has all the standard functionality of the other business cell service providers, what makes it stand apart are its unique and novel bonuses that come with select plans. For instance, some plans come with Microsoft 365 and unlimited in-flight Wi-Fi.\n\nT-Mobile offers limited and unlimited talk and text service in Canada and Mexico and standard 5G in its business packages. Additionally, all levels of T-Mobile’s business cell phone service come with its scam shield module, which identifies and warns you about known scam callers on your caller ID.\n\nYou get to choose from one of four service plans available for businesses, each priced per month and per line:\n\nBusiness Unlimited Select: Available for as low as $25 per month, per line when you purchase at least six lines; comes with 50 GB of premium data and 5 GB of hotspot data, limited talk and text to Mexico and Canada and unlimited standard definition streaming\n\nBusiness Unlimited Advanced: Available for as low as $30 per month, per line when you purchase at least six lines; includes one hour of free in-flight Wi-Fi,100 GB of premium data and a 40 GB hotspot plus unlimited talk, text and data in Canada and Mexico, as well as 5 GB of high-speed data at no extra cost; provides unlimited high definition streaming; includes two basic Microsoft 365 Business licenses\n\nBusiness Unlimited Ultimate: Available for as low as $40 per month, per line when you purchase at least six lines; unlimited access to premium data and 100 GB for your hotspot as well as unlimited in-flight Wi-Fi; get unlimited video streaming with quality up to 4K UHD\n\nBusiness Unlimited Ultimate+ for iPhone: Available for as low as $50 per month, per line when you purchase at least six lines; unlimited access to premium data and 200 GB for your hotspot as well as unlimited in-flight Wi-Fi; get unlimited video streaming with quality up to 4K UHD and Apple Business Essentials and AppleCare+\n\nAs mentioned, T-Mobile’s smartphone pricing will change depending on how many lines you choose to buy. You will be charged $60 per month for the most basic option if you only buy a single line. For this reason, smaller companies with tight budget constraints might find T-Mobile’s pricing to be too expensive, especially if they only need a few lines.\n\nBut for more mobile businesses that have employees constantly on the go, there are some really great perks. Offering access to unlimited in-flight Wi-Fi and unlimited talk, text and data to employees in Mexico and Canada could become a great selling point for your own brand.\n\nLike most major carriers, there are a lot of customers competing for data priority. While T-Mobile offers access to this “premium data,” you have to pay a lot more out of pocket to ensure that your service doesn’t stagnate when things get particularly busy.\n\nT-Mobile typically has multiple deals concerning phones, including free devices or credit up to a few hundred dollars towards buying a new smartphone. Like many such deals with carriers, they come with specific contract requirements, so it’s best to ask about the details before signing up.\n\nWho should use it:\n\nT-Mobile seems best for businesses with team members who are constantly on the go and can therefore better appreciate perks related to international travel and flights.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nReliable 5G network\n\nService plans offer unlimited talk, text and data in Canada and Mexico\n\nOptional perks such as in-flight Wi-Fi and Microsoft 365\n\nPlans are expensive for six or fewer lines\n\nBonus features only available in advanced plans\n\nForbes Advisor Ratings\n\nMethodology\n\nWhen putting this ranking together, we considered several vital components. Forbes Advisor researched the industry and analyzed multiple companies and plans. Then, we scored these providers across four categories of features using 13 different metrics that were weighted to favor features that small business owners find valuable in a cell phone service provider. The following are some of the metrics that we used to rank the providers that made our list.\n\nPricing\n\nOur main concern when it came to pricing was if the service is affordable, especially for small businesses, especially for the entry-level plan. Then, we looked at the costs and variety of plans available from each provider and what kind of value that each upgrade brought to users. Pricing accounted for 30% of our weighted scoring.\n\nKey Features\n\nWe broke features into two distinct categories: general features and additional features. For general features, we looked at the offerings from each cell phone service provider that we considered to be common ones that every customer needs. Some of these general features include unlimited domestic calling and texting, international calling, conference calling and if any necessary hardware came free with the service. We weighted features at 45% of our total score.\n\nAdditional Features\n\nFor additional features, this included aspects of cell phone service that some users would consider to be nice to have, such as an automated attendant, mobile hot spot access and mobile security. For both kinds of features, we gave more weight to those that came with the service automatically as opposed to those that were add-ons that users had to pay additionally for. We weighted features at 15% of our total score.\n\nExpert Analysis\n\nFinally, based on our market research and the categories listed above, our experts also ranked additional criteria from customer reviews using metrics that included ease of use, popularity, value for the money and any stand-out features, such as offering international texting plans, mobile VPNs, free in-flight Wi-Fi, video calling and access to free local phone numbers. Altogether, these criteria make up 10% of the total score.\n\nFeatured Partners\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1\n\nRingCentral\n\nPricing from\n\n$20 per user, per month (paid annually)\n\nToll-free numbers\n\nYes\n\nVoicemail transcription\n\nYes\n\n1\n\nRingCentral\n\nLearn More\n\nOn RingCentral's Website\n\n2\n\nZoom Phone\n\nPricing from\n\nStarts at $10 per user, per month\n\nToll-free numbers\n\nYes\n\nVoicemail Transcription\n\nYes\n\n2\n\nZoom Phone\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Zoom's Website\n\n3\n\nNextiva\n\nPricing From\n\n$18.95 per user, per month\n\nToll-free numbers\n\nYes\n\nVoicemail transcription\n\nYes\n\n3\n\nNextiva\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Nextiva's Website\n\nConsiderations for Choosing the Best Business Cell Phone Plan\n\nWhen selecting the best business cell phone plan for your company, there are a few factors to keep in mind. At the moment, for example, there are only three mainstream nationwide carriers. These larger carriers have pricing plans that might be too expensive for smaller businesses. Google Voice and RingCentral could work as much more affordable alternatives. We listed a few specific considerations in the sections below.\n\nSmartphone Lines and Pricing\n\nIt’s a good idea to consider the number of lines your business needs, not to mention monthly or annual costs. Service providers will often offer a lower per-line price, but you’ll have to buy several lines to get the discount. It might be more affordable in the end to buy one or two lines rather than buy extra lines your company doesn’t need or can’t afford.\n\nFree Phones and Purchase Credits\n\nWhile the top carriers often allow you to BYOD, it might be possible to get at least one new phone for your business. If not a free phone, it’s common to provide you with substantial credit worth up to $1,000 towards the purchase of a brand-new smartphone.\n\nA common caveat is this generosity gets tied to a long-term contract commitment. Do the month-to-month, and even year-to-year, math and decide what you’re willing to agree to in exchange for free or heavily discounted hardware. If all else fails, check to see if you can bring your existing devices with you to the new service provider. Some providers will let you do this at little to no extra charge.\n\nInternational Perks or Availability\n\nMany business cell phone plans focus on domestic features. Yet, if your brand is global, you’ll likely want to work with a company that offers talk, text and data options beyond American borders. Will data caps or a lack of in-flight Wi-Fi inhibit your ability to share information or communicate adequately? If you need worldwide service and support, it might be better to go with a much larger and more reliable carrier.\n\nHow ‘Unlimited’ Is Unlimited?\n\nWhen a phone service says that an offer is unlimited, it is rare that an asterisk does not accompany the promise. Not all unlimited pricing plans are the same. Often, when things get congested, you may find that your service quality drops significantly. So, you learn that while your service option may be technically unlimited, there’s no such promise about the quality.\n\nSome providers offer tiers that guarantee high-quality service no matter what. It’s best to read between the lines of the fine print to see what type of unlimited service you are getting offered."
