        "text": "If you’ve worked with Microsoft Project before, then you are familiar with its powerful project planning capabilities but also its many, well… frustrations. For one thing, it’s hard to share MPP files, which are too large for email and only viewable if you have MS Project. Also, MS project is quite expensive and usually requires other Microsoft products such as Project Server and/or Sharepoint, which require license renewals, and generate recurring costs.\n\nWhat you need is to be able to use the project management features of Microsoft Project online, without all its frustrations. In this article, we’ll show you MS project online alternatives that allow you how to do that.\n\nWhat Is Microsoft Project Online?\n\nMicrosoft Project Online is a cloud-based project portfolio management (PPM) software built on the Microsoft Sharepoint platform. MS Project Online was designed as an alternative for users who are looking for the project management features of desktop-based Microsoft Project, but need to collaborate online with their teams. It’s also a lighter and more user-friendly software than the on-premise version of Microsoft Project.\n\nBut, if you need a software that has the robust features of the desktop-based Microsoft Project and the ease of collaboration of MS Project Online, then try ProjectManager. ProjectManager has nearly all the powerful features of traditional Microsoft Project—Gantt charts, dashboards, task lists, project reports, resource management tools—on an online platform that works on both PC and Mac. Plus, there’s a mobile app so collaboration can happen even at the job site for the latest updates. Take a free 30-day trial and seamlessly import an MPP file to get started.\n\nHow to Use Microsoft Project Online & Different Versions of Project Online\n\nTo use MS Project Online, you’ll need a Microsoft Project Plan 3 or Project Plan 5 subscription. It’s important to note that Project Online is not the same as other Microsoft products such as Microsoft Project Professional, Project Server, Project for the web, or the Project online desktop client. Here are the 3 versions of Microsoft Project Online.\n\nProject Online: This is the fully-featured version of Microsoft Project Online\n\nProject Online Essentials: This is a lightweight version of Project Online with only a few features that comes at a lower price\n\nProject Online Desktop Client: An on-premises project management option that has the same features as MS Project Online\n\nMS Project Online Benefits & Features\n\nMS Project Online doesn’t have the same features as the traditional, desktop version of Microsoft Project that you might be familiar with. With a subscription to Project Online, you’ll get access to project planning features like Gantt charts and critical path identification, as well as task management features like kanban boards and collaboration tools for scheduling and task updates.\n\nYou’ll also get resource management features for resource costing and capacity planning, as well as time tracking via timesheets for monitoring project timelines and schedule baselines. Finally, Microsoft Project Online also has portfolio management features for portfolio analysis and prioritization, as well as roadmaps and project budgeting.\n\nCons of Microsoft Project Online\n\nThe online project management tool is very powerful and is a great option for teams already set up within a Microsoft project ecosystem, such as Microsoft Teams, MS Project Server, Microsoft Planner and Sharepoint. For these teams, adding a minor cost for online additions of their desktop project management tools is a great way to get their Microsoft Project plans online. However, MS Project Online has major drawbacks for everybody else.\n\nYou need to purchase a lot of add-ons and licenses separately to use all MS Project Online features. For example you’ll need Power BI, Microsoft Teams, Power Apps, Azure Boards, among others.\n\nYou also need Sharepoint integrations, which is the sharing portal for Microsoft files of all kinds because the file sizes are so large.\n\nMicrosoft Project Online pricing structure is complicated. Even with three tiers of pricing plans, the licensing fees add up if you want your whole team to get onboard.\n\nYour team members will need a MS Project Online Essentials or a Project Plan 1 subscription to perform a few basic Microsoft Project Online Essentials functions like submitting timesheets and updating tasks.\n\nMS Project Online Pricing\n\nTo use the full version of Microsoft Project Online, you’ll need to pay $55 per user per month, which is quite expensive relative to other project management software. MS Project Online pricing can be confusing and hard to explain. That’s because Microsoft Project is no longer a single software, but a set of project management tools. On top of that MS Project offers three subscription plans, which complicate things even more. To use MS Project Online, you’ll need a Microsoft Project Plan 3 or Project Plan 5 subscription. Here are the plans you can acquire to use Microsoft Project Online:\n\nProject Plan 1 ($10 per user per month): This plan doesn’t include the full version of MS Project Online, but you’ll get Project Online Essentials, which is a lighter version with limited features.\n\nProject Plan 3 ($30 per user per month): Formerly known as the Project Online Professional plan, it Includes Project for the web, Microsoft Project Online, Project Online Desktop Client.\n\nProject Plan 5 ($55 per user per month): Includes the same Microsoft Project products as Project Plan 3, with extra features.\n\nBest Microsoft Project Online Alternatives\n\nThe desktop version of Microsoft Project has long been the standard for project managers, so much so that many are incredulous that there are viable MS project online alternatives. Yes, there really are affordable project management software alternatives with all the power of MS Project and without all the frustrations.\n\n1. ProjectManager\n\nProjectManager is a cloud-based project management software that has the project planning power of the MS Project Gantt chart, but it’s faster and easier to use. ProjectManager is completely compatible with Microsoft Project for teams who have Project Server and Sharepoint but need to be able to share their plans online. There’s a significant cost savings, as well, as you don’t need desktop versions of the software. But most importantly, ProjectManager offers seamless import & export of MS Project and Excel files, with no data loss.\n\nAnd, because it’s always online, it has team collaboration features and the ability to share plans with anyone. You can rely on ProjectManager for all your project, program and project portfolio management (PPM) needs, and find why it is a great MS Project Online alternative. Ready to try it for yourself? Get started for free, and import your MPP files today for a better, online project management experience.\n\n2. Microsoft Project Online Viewer\n\nIf you don’t want to purchase MS Project Online, you can simply use a Microsoft Project Viewer, which is a project management tool that allows those project managers who don’t have an Office 365 account and a contract with MS Project Online to still open and view MPP files online.\n\nThe problem with a view-only project management tool is that while it allows you to open MPP files, there is little you can do with them other than see the plan.\n\nHow to Import MS Project Files into ProjectManager\n\nStart by setting up a 30-day free account with us. You’ll see that we have multiple project management views, such as kanban boards, task lists and a calendar view. Choose the online Gantt chart and follow this walkthrough. It’s that simple.\n\n1. Import MPP File\n\nClick the import button on the top right-hand side of the Gantt chart page. This will let you get your Microsoft Project file online, so you can share it with others.\n\n2. Select MPP File\n\nChoose the select file button on the popup window. Once you’ve picked the MS project file you want to import, just hit next.\n\n3. Make Import Options\n\nPick what options you want before importing the file. The popup menu offers you such choices as to create a new project or add to an existing one, keep or replace the existing data, etc.\n\n4.

Here are three options you can choose from if it has to be Microsoft.\n\n1. Microsoft Project Desktop Version\n\nProject Online and the desktop versions of Microsoft Project offer the same features if you choose an equivalent plan.
