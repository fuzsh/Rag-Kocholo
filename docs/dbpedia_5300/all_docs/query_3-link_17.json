        "text": "Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim.\n\nYour Excellency Sheikha Bodour bint Sultan Al Qassimi, honorable members of the Board of Trustees, Chancellor Tod Laursen, Interim Provost Mohamed El Tarhuni, faculty and staff, our proud families, and of course, my fellow graduates: Assalamualaykom wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh.\n\nMy name is Malek Bachir, and it is both emotional and exciting for me to address you here today. I want to thank everyone for being here, to proudly witness the graduation of the American University of Sharjah's 48th batch, the class of Spring 2024!\n\nMy fellow graduates, we are here today in a hall that is overflowing with emotions as we celebrate not the end, but the beginning of our journey. We graduate today as living testaments to resilience and unbreakable spirit, having gone through a college journey that was anything but conventional. We went through what began as a minor adjustment during our last school year, that week we took off in March 2020, which quickly spiraled out of control. That week turned into months, which led to starting and spending our first year of college online, in the most unconventional way imaginable.\n\nAs we embarked on two new paths, college life and virtual learning, each of us grappled with our own set of challenges. The familiar rhythm of classroom life was replaced with Blackboard Collaborate, where the only interactions we had with each other was typing “present” and “yes”. Our bedrooms and kitchen tables turned into classrooms, blurring the lines between personal space and learning environments.\n\nThis struggle was real, and it faced us on multiple fronts, but ladies and gentlemen, instead of lamenting our struggle, let’s instead appreciate what came out of it, let us talk about the glory in our struggle. It's in these struggles, these moments of uncertainty and challenge, that we found our true strengths. We learned that adaptability is not just about surviving; it's about thriving. We discovered the power of community in times of isolation. We found new ways to connect by creating virtual study groups that spanned neighborhoods, cities, and even continents, and by sharing resources and encouragement, passing along tips as freely as we once swapped notes in the hallways. These experiences showed the strength of our principles in the face of hardship, and our unwavering strength when faced with obstacles.\n\nThe glory in our struggle lies in the transformation we've undergone. We didn't just learn to adapt; we became masters of reinvention. We didn't just overcome obstacles; we transformed them into opportunities for growth. Our journey has taught us that within every challenge lies an opportunity to grow, to learn, and to excel.\n\nDespite the physical distance, we came together, supported one another, and pushed the boundaries of what we thought possible. And once we came back on campus, this graduating class led initiatives that not only brought us even closer but also made a significant impact on our community. From volunteering at the world's biggest climate change conference COP 28, to great initiatives led by our clubs and organizations, we turned our challenges into opportunities to serve and lead.\n\nThe most significant example of these initiatives happened a few months ago, when the AUS community led by the Student Council put on a united front and organized the \"Tarahum for Gaza\" event, where we all came together to support a people in need. This shows how the AUS community is and always will be dedicated to making change on unprecedented levels.\n\nAnd of course, we must acknowledge the profound role that AUS has played throughout our challenges. We are immensely grateful for our leaders, especially his highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohamed Al Qasimi, ruler of Sharjah, the founder and first President of AUS. As many of our families went through financial struggles during the COVID pandemic, generous contributions and scholarships facilitated the academic and financial lives of many graduates here, including myself. In the same spirit of visionary leadership and commitment to education, we are now fortunate to have his daughter, Her Excellency Sheikha Bodour bint Sultan Al Qasimi leading the way as the current President of AUS, carrying on her father’s legacy.\n\nAnd to our parents, guardians, siblings, and loved ones, your belief in us has been our guiding light. And to our professors, mentors, and the entire faculty, your dedication to guiding us through these tough times did not go unnoticed, your support carried us through the toughest times, and on behalf of all graduates, thank you for being there for us.\n\nToday we also remember those who, though may not be here with us physically, they left a lasting impression on our lives. Personally, I graduate today without my dad, whom I navigated most of my university life without after losing him to COVID in my first year. My father’s spirit and legacy inspired and will continue to inspire me for the rest of my life and I am eternally grateful for him. This sentiment, I know, is shared by many of us who have lost loved ones and are feeling their loss especially today. Together, we honor their memory, and carry their legacy forward with every step we take. They dreamt with us, believed in us, and today, their spirits soar with pride at what we have achieved, and we owe them a debt of gratitude that we can only repay by living lives that will make them proud.\n\nSo, to the class of Spring 2024, as we stand on the threshold of a new beginning, let's embrace the glory of our shared struggle, let its memory be the foundation upon which we build our future successes. Let it inspire us to approach the future not with fear, but with the confidence that comes from knowing we've already been victorious over tougher times. And finally, my fellow graduates, I ask you to leave this hall today with one thing in mind; that obstacles are not in the way; they are the way.\n\nCongratulations, Alf Mabrouk, and thank you."
