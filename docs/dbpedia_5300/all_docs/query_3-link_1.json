        "text": "Synopsis\n\n\"FMPs are offering good options both from the point of view of a coupon & tax benefit\"\n\nThis is time when a lot of investors would want to be conservative, Nimish Shah, Head-Investment & Research, SBI Wealth tells Ayesha Faridi:\n\nEdited Excerpts:\n\nAyesha Faridi: SBI is the banker to every Indian, I must say you must have a phenomenal edge over the others?\n\nNimish Shah: Yes, so it is definitely an advantage because we are the first one in the PSU sector to really kind of come out with the wealth management option for our clients. It was actually a missing piece in the massive client base that SBI has and to cater to the requirements of the HNIs who require special service in terms of both products and also in terms of the quality of service, definitely this was something which was missing and this has been added. And like what you said yes, the opportunity is huge and that is where I think reaching out and being a wealth manager to most of the HNIs in India is what SBI is striving for.\n\nAyesha Faridi: So what is your current AUM, how did this journey start, I mean, how did SBI think that we are everywhere, we are the banker to every Indian but we need to get into advisory wealth management kind of roles as well?\n\nNimish Shah: On the AUM front we are doing pretty fine. We are currently in almost about 98 hubs across the country in about 26 major centres of SBI and that pretty much gives us a wide coverage including in smaller cities. So in that way we are more than about 35,000 clients on-board and almost about Rs 16,000 crore of AUM. But yes, it is a long way for SBI to go and the opportunity is humungous.\n\nAyesha Faridi: You have a close ear to the ground, considering you are already present in 26 cities. Tell me where is the concentration of wealth and are you really seeing emergence of the wealth beyond the Mumbais and Delhis, are you seeing tier-2 and tier-3 cities as well come to you for wealth management advice?\n\nNimish Shah: Yes, I think they are really open to the concept of wealth management, while a lot of other wealth managers are already present in these cities, but to the question of the wealth actually coming to the tier-2 cities is quite true. A lot of small businesses and a lot of medium scale enterprises are actually coming into money because of the efforts that they have made for so many years and their businesses have come to a level where they are now able to monetise it and therefore many-many people in the smaller towns also are actually coming into wealth because of selloffs or because of the expansion of businesses which they are making.\n\nAyesha Faridi: We always talk about it that only 5% or 0.5% which was the case about two years back of India is invested into financial instruments and even lesser when it comes to equity markets, considering you have that data base of SBI with you, I guess you would have that first mover advantage and you will be able to capitalise. Is the broader India open to equities as an asset class?\n\nNimish Shah: On the SBI platform the age profile is slightly higher compared to other market players, but having said that there is a requirement of getting market linked returns so that awareness among clients is definitely setting in and clients are open to look at equity as a portion of their total investments. So that awareness is creeping and we are seeing that in the mutual fund numbers, we are seeing that in the importance which is being attached to the overall economic health of the country. And people are understanding these concepts much better than what probably they used to a few years back.\n\nAyesha Faridi: How difficult is it really when you talk about equity investments with your clients given how volatile a time it is going to be from now up until the general-election uncertainty gets over, both on the global front and domestic front. Is it really difficult to how to manoeuvre the markets and how to convince your clients that stay put with equities after this volatility and this phase gets over you will get back to seeing positive returns?\n\nNimish Shah: People are definitely kind of edgy if not kind of worried so what we do is that we start first with risk profiling of the clients and we also have every product, which we are offering to clients as an option of investment which is risk rated. So matching of the risk rating of the client and that of the product is very important for us. Having said that that is what we explain to the clients that if you want to get into equity at whatever of the stage of the market it is times will be volatile and volatility I think if kind of taken in the right way can be a friend. But having said that, yes we are seeing continuous flows coming to the SIP book and from that perspective, I think clients are understanding much more and are quite comfortable continuing especially in the large cap segment.\n\nAnd it is more of a tactical call, so for example, almost about close to a year back we had given a tactical call to get out of smallcap and midcap to the extent of the profits that you have there. So that has proved kind of quite good with our clients and clients appreciate those kind of tactical calls. And I do not think they are really worried of getting out of equity as an asset class but yes, definitely there are more questions than what there were a few months back.\n\nAyesha Faridi: Are they agnostic to any asset class, while you are of course, pushing for largecaps, all of us have had that feeling of 2017 when just about any mid and smallcap that you touched turned to the Midas touch turned to gold, a tip in the lift also for small and midcaps would work. Do they really wonder as to when those 2017 kind of returns going to come back or is it a complete no-no for mid and smallcaps, it is not a complete exit, is it?\n\nNimish Shah: So no, we are not kind of recommending a complete exit, in fact there are good opportunities available, specifically if the fund manager on the small and midcap is good and also stock specific recommendations on small and midcap given the correction that has already happened.\n\nBut from the client perspective, yes they are not all to kind of fallout for getting into small and midcap, but I would say that if the asset allocation is right and you have fair amount of money is allocated to small and midcap then I do not think one needs to worry with a three to four-year perspective but if you want to get into equity at whatever stage a minimum horizon should be three to five years. So that is what we tell clients and not to get into equities with a horizon which is less than that.\n\nAyesha Faridi: On the other asset classes, very contrary views on whether or not gold should be looked at, some believe that it is a great hedge given the kind of volatility that the dollar as well has been seeing, given how precarious globally things are, what with the trade war etc, etc do you believe that gold may be a miniscule part of your portfolio but should be there in your portfolio?\n\nNimish Shah: I would like to take this question more from the point of view of Indian perspective. The affinity for investing in gold is definitely kind of in the DNA of every Indian. So to that extent it has proved kind of a fairly stable return giver as far as gold is concerned.\n\nNow with the government also providing the gold bond option where in the dematerialised form you can have gold and you can also earn a small amount of interest I think that does become a small part of an asset allocation of a client’s portfolio and given the fact that Indians will or may probably need gold from the point of view of future requirements in terms of weddings or in terms of gifting definitely it is a kind of a fairly a good part of an investment of Indian investor after real estate and other asset classes as such.\n\nSo we are not discounting gold, are we bullish, it is very difficult to say because there are two factors; international gold prices and the domestic rupee-dollar depreciation or appreciation so it all depends on that. But yes, a miniscule allocation or a small allocation to gold with a longer term perspective definitely is on the cards.\n\nAyesha Faridi: What about debt, because it is now again when you are seeing those WhatsApp forwards from your RM saying invest in fixed deposits for the next one to two years because they are giving you anywhere between about 7% to about almost 8% returns as well. And about one year back also or even six months back if you would have asked do you put your money into fixed deposits the answer would have been a clear no. So what exactly is happening in the debt market, and especially in the backdrop of the recent liquidity crisis, which of course, has been managed very well by the government in the name of IL&FS. How should debt market be looked at, are liquid funds the only way to go or do you think one could look at arbitrage or some other kind of tools as well?\n\nNimish Shah: I think fixed income markets or debt markets can be actually divided into two; one is in terms of the accrual products and second is in terms of the duration products. So duration products are something which can be as risky and as volatile as equity markets and people who get into duration without understanding the risk attached to it will definitely need to face the vagaries of the market and we have that happen because of the yields on the 10-year moving up to 8% and above and then again because of the liquidity infusion and the support coming in from the government and RBI these yields have kind of tapered down and also because of the oil prices kind of moderating.\n\nSo these ups and downs as far as yields on the government securities and therefore the fixed income markets and issues such as NBFC liquidity or because of credit rating issues definitely will crop up time to time. But as an investor if you are understanding the difference between accrual and duration then I think you can play the market well and in fact if you look at the accruals space right now I think it is the right time to actually look at something like a corporate bond fund or even like a credit risk fund depending on your risk profile to actually lock in for the next two years, three years or even five years with a yield which is quite above what the fixed deposit can give you and also giving you the tax benefit.\n\nAyesha Faridi: What about real estate, is that a complete no-no? Gold is a miniscule part, but is realty anywhere as part of your asset allocation list?\n\nNimish Shah: So technically in asset allocation, we are not able to include real estate purely from the point of view that there is no benchmark available and therefore there is no way where we can kind of predict the volatility and the returns of that particular asset class to give you a percentage allocation by throwing it into a model.\n\nAyesha Faridi: But your clients since you are present across 26 cities I am sure must be having a large chunk of their portfolios in real estate?\n\nNimish Shah: Yes, they do and to that extent the queries on real estate definitely are very difficult to answer because it is a market, which is very micro oriented and even for example in Mumbai it is very difficult to predict or even to tell in terms of what the individual micro market is behaving like.\n\nSo we would rather leave that decision to the local advisors on real estate. What we also kind of look at is the mezzanine debt opportunities which are available in real estate for good quality borrowers so that is something which on a fund platform investors can look into and therefore getting a net of tax and net of cost return of around 10-12% is something which investors can look at in real estate rather than investing directly into real estate as such.\n\nAyesha Faridi: If in this kind of a market environment you had to advise someone as to where to put in that fresh Rs 100 both for a conservative as well as an aggressive investor, how would you allocate that across asset classes?\n\nNimish Shah: So this is a time when a lot of investors would want to be conservative, but having said that for the conservative investors on the equity side we would say that you should still be allocating almost about 25% and that 25% should be broken up between probably a larger amount into large caps and a smaller amount into small and midcaps. And equity definitely with a longer term perspective will give you at least 3 to 5% more return than what a fixed income will give you and that is huge addition to your returns as such. So we are continuing with that. And as far as aggressive investors are concerned, we should still continue investing at least about 60-65% into equity but again with a staggered investment with at least next six months in horizon given the facts we talked about elections and also in terms of the macro global headwinds we feel that staggering it over the next six months would be a better idea as far investments into equity is concerned.\n\nAyesha Faridi: Where does the rest of the Rs 100 go?\n\nNimish Shah: So in fixed income, I do not think one needs to time the market and as we have talked earlier investments into accrual funds definitely can be done lump sum right now. Fixed maturity plans are also offering good options both from the point of view of a coupon and also from the point of view of tax benefit with a three indexations of four indexations benefit and therefore getting a net of tax return which is north of 7.5% I think it makes a good investment proposition in fixed income at this point of time. Gold, probably about 5% and for aggressive investors we could also look at getting into alternative investments so there could be options like real estate mezzanine debt funds or even in terms of looking at long short funds on the equity side which can give them returns which are better than in debt or probably slightly lower than equity.\n\nAyesha Faridi: So you are saying for the conservative investor 25% equities, 5% gold, rest 70% all of it into debt?\n\nNimish Shah: That is right. That is right.\n\nAyesha Faridi: What about SIPs, like you are saying that SIPs are still continuing to flow in, we are continuing to see inflows come in, if you had to chalk out a list for a conservative and an aggressive guy to park some money into SIPs for say the next two years, I am stretching the timeframe here so you are done with the uncertainty in the next one year what would be the ideal mutual fund list from your stable?\n\nNimish Shah: So on the SBI platform, we are open architecture system and we have almost about 19 AMCs that have on-boarded. So having said that, the list would all depend in terms of what the ranking and the rating we have for each and every scheme. While I would not want to recommend specific schemes but of that almost about of the 25% for a conservative investors about 15-20% should go into large cap and large and midcap funds and a good quality stable fund houses like SBI or even ICICI, Birla, Franklin Templeton all of them I think are doing a wonderful job on that front. And we should continue kind of looking at investments into large cap from that perspective.\n\nMid and smallcap I would be more choosy and there we would want to pick fund managers who have the expertise and also from the point of view of longevity in managing those kind of funds with a long historical background that we can actually look at both from the point of view of volatility and returns and our selection would be based largely on that. So I would be choosy on mid and small cap fund managers.\n\nAyesha Faridi: Where would you think that a disruption would be in the industry? When you talk about alternate investments some people believe that that is where the big disruption is, the kind of funds the niche that you can present as a wealth manager is what is going to differentiate you from A to B or to C. So tell me a little bit more about the instruments or the alternative funds the niche that you bring about at SBI as opposed to any other?\n\nNimish Shah: Currently we are catering more towards the average HNI and our offering is more where the age group and also the risk profile is more like moderate and from that perspective we are going slow on alternatives given the uncertainty in the markets also. But having said that we are open to bonds also, for example, there a lot of bonds which are giving you good return. We have bonds like, for example, NHAI coming up in the near future which will give you a fairly decent return if you are kind of holding on for three to five years.\n\nYou have other options as far as mutual funds on fixed income is concerned. On the alternate space you have portfolio management schemes, I am kind of making them as alternate purely from the point of view of the concentration risk that they carry so there are good quality portfolio managers available in the country and if you are having a theme in mind or if you are okay with investing in just about 15 to 20 stocks then these fund managers are doing an excellent job so that would be one option.\n\nMezzanine debt funds like what we have mentioned giving you about 10-12% net of tax and net of cost returns is another alternative which investors are looking at. And finding niche products for the sake of it in these markets is not advisable because it is very easy to get into a fund on our alternate site which has a very-very long lock in but that is where the problem starts so on a lock in of three years or four years is fine but five-year or a seven-year lock in something where investors still are not very comfortable getting into.\n\nAyesha Faridi: What would you say is the biggest risk right now that the market has not foreseen because just about anything that could go wrong has gone wrong; emerging market currency volatility, for us it is the election outcome with is looming large, globally as well, we have seen crude go all over the place from 80 to where people were predicting it is going to go to 100 it is back at 65 now, the trade war tensions which now seem to have eased off, what is that one trigger that the market is not prepared for and to add to that our own NBFC crisis?\n\nNimish Shah: So I think you have mentioned most of the issues which have been kind of addressed to quite a certain extent as far as the volatility in the market has taken there. So I think one issue is more in terms of the continuation of the earnings so that is something which I think on the equity side will be looming large going forward and if the economic turnaround which is expected to happen and which is kind of at grass root level it has started happening if that falters for any reason either because of elections or because of monsoons, the next monsoons or purely from the point of view of any global uncertainty say on the side of Europe or if US slows down considerably in the next one or two years which it may then definitely these are the concerns which are there.\n\nBut having said that I do not think India is going anyway away from a 7% to 7.5% GDP growth for the next two to three years and if you add inflation to that real growth of about 11-12% is definitely on the cards. And if you are investing in good quality companies whether in the fixed income side or equity side getting at least that much return is quite sure for is that is what I kind of visualise going forward and from that perspective I would rather be positive on the markets and invest kind of in an staggered manner than postpone the investment and wait.\n\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
