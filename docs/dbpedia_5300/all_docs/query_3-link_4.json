        "text": "Last week on Wednesday the Federal Reserve (the Central Bank of the United States) had its meeting and the #Fed Chair gave out statements and had a press conference where he was deemed to be dovish, implying that rates would be cut sooner rather than later. After that the #USStockMarket rallied and there were many who put out very smart & erudite sounding commentary with charts and graphs on why the market reaction was justified. Thereafter Thursday and Friday the US market came down significantly and there were once again data and analysis driven pieces explaining why that happened So within the space of a day the macro indicators supposedly shifted enough to justify first a rise and then a crash. Often in pieces written by the same person! As I have said often enough in the past, the exact same news and data can be used to justify any market movement. For example, if a central bank, say the Fed, does not cut interest rates it can be used to justify either a rise or a fall in the market depending on what actually happens. This is how the logic goes: interest rates are high means the expected returns from the equity market also remain high (to learn about how this mechanism works, given a link to a short video from my #insightsByDevina series in the comments). Hence OBVIOUSLY the market had to fall. But what if the market goes up in the exact same circumstances? Then a logic can be found that the central bank is not cutting rates because the economy is doing well and OBVIOUSLY the market has to zoom when the economy is booming. Ergo, the same data can be just used to justify exactly opposite moves. Remember the press, the electronic media, the talking heads, the news letters, the strategist, the research analyst all need to act as 'the expert' and fill up the pages or hours. Does not mean that any of what they are saying actually makes sense. Read this book 'Everything is Obvious Once You Know the Answer', or at least the title and you will know what I'm talking about Incidentally while this book itself is good, the same point was explained beautifully in a single chapter in 'Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment' by Cass R. Sunstein, Daniel Kahneman, and Olivier Sibony\n\nDo you know what you are worth? Not in monetary terms but as a person or a professional? Do you know what you want or at least what you don't want? An incident from decades ago suddenly popped up in my mind that set me thinking. I was always a quiz enthusiast through school and college - both participating in and conducting quizzes. When Doordarshan came to Lucknow, I became a regular participant in their quiz shows (as an aside, my main rival in the quizzes used to be the son of legendary Hindi writer, Shri KP Saxena) The usual format of these shows all over (think of the Siddharth Basu or Derek O'Brien television shows that you may have seen) used to be a male quiz master with a female assistant who, depending on the format, would be keeping the score, passing the mike around and so on. After a few visits to the television studios, the producers made me an offer - that I could take this female assistant's role. It did not take me a minute to turn it down. I was very clear that I did not want a purely decorative role (yes, I was pretty decorative those days üòâ). My counter offer was that if you are willing to make me the quiz master (sic) I will do it, but not this. I never thought about it again. It is only decades later I realised that for most 18/19 year olds this would have been a big thing, especially those days - to appear on television regularly (for those too young to remember, Doordarshan was the only TV channel back then and its limited hours programming was watched diligently by everyone who had access to a TV!) but to me it appeared like an affront to my dignity and capabilities. I was always clearer what I did not want to do! Made lot of the choices in my life based on elimination. Always have a good sense of your self-worth.\n\nToday's exactly 20 years since my Papa went to the Big Classroom in the sky. Classroom, because teaching was not just a career for him - it was the love of his life. 15 years before he passed away he had a brain injury and in the semi-coma, he was shouting out numbers and during the few months that he spent in the twilight zone where he didn't recognise anyone other than my mother, I remember a doctor asking him pointing at me, \"Who is this?\". He confidently replied, \"She's my research scholar.\" That was how central to his identity his vocation as a Maths professor was. Remembering my extraordinary father who wanted a daughter as his firstborn 60+ years ago, even before my brothers were born. He was always an immensely proud father too...at times embarrassingly so! Someone told me that we follow one parent consciously & the other unconsciously, esp at life's turning points. He was the unconscious one for me because of a truly exceptional mother whom we idolized from our childhood. Many of his qualities I saw only in hindsight. And I now see him in myself and in my brothers. A father who had exactly the same expectations of all his kids: whether on major things like a career & education; or everyday ones like his belief that kids should be out playing in the evening - it was almost mandatory to be out from 4-6 pm. Only in hindsight I realise how unusual he was. Especially in that he was equally fair to his wife, encouraging her education & career. A proud Pathan who was confident enough not to need to put down women. A man who marched totally to his own tune. There was always a childlike innocence about him till the end - which, in a sense, did not prepare me for some of the conmen out in the world! A perfect blend of love & security without overprotectiveness. The roots and wings upbringing that's supposed to be ideal. It is only now I realise how unusual it was in a country where daughters have to fight to literally breathe. More than what he did for me and the rest of the family, he touched so many lives. His brilliance at a teacher I knew (he taught me for 3 years at Lucknow University) as also his students' love and regard for him ('my real wealth', he used to call it). But found that his influence went far beyond that. Had scores literally crying for him on his death - from ages 5 to 85. Even now people come to me and say, 'Your father was especially fond of me'. I nod and smile...he was 'specially fond' of so many because for him everyone was family. He never lost a relationship. Sometimes I would find that an old classmate I had lost touch with, Papa was still meeting. He would even go and congratulate unknown kids if he read about their achievements in the newspaper. On the other hand, he ran around to help a Kargil widow - again someone he read about in the papers. So many stories that I didn't even know of. A life well lived! Proud to be your Daughter, Dr. Amarnath Mehra. You are always with me üôèüòä"
