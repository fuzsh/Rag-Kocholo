Describe a prize you have won.\n\nYou should say:\n\nwhat it was\n\nwhat you had to do to win it\n\nhow many other competitors were there\n\nand explain how you felt after winning it.\n\n[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nWinning a prize is always exciting and the winners are adored as well by different quarters. I also had won a prize in my college’s annual sports competition last week. I won the first prize and became the champion on the table tennis match on the indoor games category.\n\nTennis is one of the most exciting sports in the world. Besides, the players are admired and respected by the people of the world. When it is about tennis, majority of the people consider it to be lawn tennis but table tennis is the smaller version of the lawn tennis. Table tennis is played on a table and the rules are similar to the larger one. Usually, two types of matches are played on table tennis – single match, team match. In a single match, usually, there is one opponent in each of the sides while the opponents become two in the team match. All of the teams or players try to defeat their opponents.\n\nWinning on a table tennis match is difficult indeed. I had to struggle a lot for winning the matches. Initially, I took part in the qualifying rounds, and then I got promoted to the competing matches. I played the matches solo though one of my friends wanted to team up with me. But I declined as I am not a good team player. Before appearing on the competitions, I had to practice the techniques for hours. Usually making the balls to swing is one of the difficult ways in table tennis and if someone could master it, playing and especially defeating becomes easier. So, I practised the specific way at my home with my sister. Moreover, I used to play table tennis with some of my friends who came to visit me at my home. Besides, dad also likes to play table tennis and often he turned my opponent at my home. So, I had lots of practice with table tennis and thereby, I became victorious.\n\nThere were several other competitors against me and I had to defeat every one of them. Before reaching the final match, I had to beat five other competitors. It was a bit difficult for me because the matches took place in a single day. The qualifying matches began early in the morning and continued for around one hour. Then the competing matches took place.\n\nFortunately, I got some rest as I did not have to play all the matches. I appeared in six matches altogether (including the final match). The matches took place in the college auditorium and three tables for the tennis were placed inside there to hold the matches. Most of the players came here without any practice and I thought that it would be easy to defeat them as I do have regular practice with table tennis. But it was tougher for me to defeat my competitors and they played very well despite having no practice at all.\n\nWhen I participated in the matches, I, in fact, did not think about the results. Rather, I tried to play my best and I did so. In the end, the results backed me. When I checked my score, I was amazed and could not believe that I did so well in the matches. The least distance of points with the opponents was 10. The other opponents played well and had a good fight with me. My parents were also with me during the matches and they inspired me after every match. When I won the college championship for table tennis, I was overwhelmed with joy and excitement. I shared my emotions with my family members and also with the opponents. They said that they had also enjoyed the matches with me and wished me good luck as well. The chief guest, the college principal and relevant others also inspired me to continue my practice so that I could be a great table tennis player in future.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n2. Talk about something you were disappointed about.\n\nYou should say:\n\nwhat it was about\n\nwhen it happened\n\nwhy it disappointed you\n\nand explain how you felt about it.\n\n[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say.

I could not use the cell phone for around two months. It got seriously damaged without any reason.\n\nIn March of the year 2016, I had bought an iPhone 5 manufactured by apple. This is a globally renowned brand and sells its products around the world. This is also considered as the most pricey product on the planet. Everything is okay. The hardware and software combinations are fine and undoubtedly the products provide the best possible services. Considering all the other issues, I bought the phone set from a local iPhone selling store in Singapore. The selling authority asked me to reach them in case of any trouble with the phone. But there were no chances of such events to contact them again over any defects or problems with the phone. The phone worked well for a couple of weeks and from the second month, a few symptoms appeared. The phone screen got blurred and some noises on the screen appeared as well.\n\nThe screen problem appeared exactly from the second month after buying the phone. As I was instructed, I took the phone to the retailer who sold it to me with necessary documents. They received the phone cordially and asked me to meet them a couple of days later. Accordingly, I met them and they handed the phone over to me and assured that the problems were gone. To my surprise, the problem appeared again and now it was happening twice than before. The phone set frequently restarted and the screen was looking awful. It appeared that the screen became the place colour. A wide range of colours were playing on the screen while the display was not working. I tried to install the OS several types but it did not accept the new install. So, I had to go back again to the selling store and this time they asked me to come after a week. They also ensured me to look into the matter deeply. In between, I made a phone call at the store and came to know that the phone set is defective and the display will not be okay any more.\n\nThough the selling store replaced the phone to me, I was disappointed highly with the poor quality of the product. It may happen that the specific phone set that I bought was of below standard but not all the products are the same. By the same time, the selling authority has agreed to replace the handset shortly. Despite all the positive issues, I did not get any comfort of my mind. This was the very first apple product for me and I bought it after saving from my pocket money given by my dad. So, it was a happy moment for me when I bought the phone and my happiness turned upside down when the phone started trouble. The technicians at the apple approved selling store in Singapore could not figure out the problems of the phone initially and later they come to the decision that the display of the phone was defective. So, I was disappointed about the issue that all my efforts resulted in having a defective handset.\n\nI was emotionally imbalanced after the event. I have been using the replaced cell phone but I the days are fearsome. I am afraid of experiencing the situations again and if such happens, the selling authority would not allow me to replace the phone again. A blended form of emotions attacked me when I encountered the problem with the phone set. At first, I was amazed at the color change of the display and then became worried when the colors were frequently changing. I got afraid when the set started restarting frequently in the second time. I heard many rumors about phone bursting and the issue made me concerned lest my phone set does not get burst as if it bursts, I would not be able to replace the set. Fortunately, nothing worst like that happened and still I am using another similar phone which is serving me well. But when I remember about the earlier iPhone 5, I feel sad.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n3. Describe a national day in your country.\n\nYou should say:\n\nwhat day it is\n\nhow it is celebrated\n\nwhat the historical significance of this day is\n\nand explain how you feel about this day.\n\n[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nSingapore is the land of beauty and most of its parts are covered with trees and foliage. Singapore Botanic Garden, located at the Cluny Road is one of the best places of the city and the country as well.\n\nThe Singapore Botanic Garden ages over one and a half century and is considered as one of the World Heritage Sites. This garden is located adjacent to the Singapore city and the only tropical garden in the country. Moreover, the garden has been awarded as the top attractive park in 2013 and some other prestigious awards for its diversified trees and plants. The history of the gardens dates back to the 18th century when an agri-horticultural society formed it. The garden has helped greatly to expand the business of the locality particularly the rubber industry. Besides, the plants and trees inside the garden are also used for numerous research and analysis. Now it is a centre for orchid study which has brought global recognition for the garden. Moreover, this is a place to gain inner peace amid the natural tranquillity.\n\nThe garden is like a small piece of heaven. The natural beauty of the garden is breathtaking. The small lakes reflect the blue sky on them and sitting idly by the lakes under the tree shades is priceless. The garden houses over 3000 species of orchids, both natural and hybrid. The garden was established with the view to evaluate the cultivation crops for economic growth. The garden has some interesting histories and passed some crucial moments during the Japanese invasion in Singapore. But it was protected from the invasion and proper care was taken as there were numerous precious plants and trees. The garden was renamed as Shonan Botanic Gardens and the name was changed again with the help of a university professor. The garden contains different smaller gardens and lakes like National Orchid Garden, VIP Orchid Garden, Symphony Lake, and Ginger Garden etc.\n\nThe Singapore Botanical Gardens opens from early in the morning (5am) and remains opened till the midnight (12pm). People of all strata come here with different purposes. There are some health conscious people who come here in the early morning and perform different types of exercises. Many of them walk across the garden and some of them love to jog. Often I go there for jogging in the morning hours. Sometimes, there are people who come with the pet animals. It is a great place for all to pass some moments with nature. Besides, there are some people who come here only to enjoy the natural beauty. They take some breathing exercises in the open air. This is a helpful exercise for the lungs, I think. In the evening hours, people come here to relax. Mostly the tourists come here in the evening to enjoy the natural beauty and views of the garden. Besides, the garden takes an amazing look during the night time. In the evening, the birds living on the trees come and make some noises which are truly enjoyable.\n\nI remember the garden for several reasons. This is the only place which allows me to take breath peacefully. This is the place where there are no hustle and bustle of the city could reach. The garden allows all types of people to enter and enjoy the beauty of nature. The most attractive issue for the garden is that there are no fees are required to enter into the garden and anyone can stay here as long as the garden remains opened. Besides, there are some stores adjacent the gardens which help the visitors to take foods comfortably. The walkways are built with great care while the statues will make you amazed. I usually go to the garden at 5.30 am every day and sometimes I walk and most of the time I jog here for about an hour. After the jogging and walking, I take rest for few minutes and return home. This is a great place indeed for the nature lovers. I try to visit the garden in the evening and take an evening walk if I miss the morning schedule. The spaces inside the garden are large and the light breezes are adorable. For all those reasons, I like the garden most in the city.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n9. Describe a television programme you watched and did not enjoy.\n\nYou should say:\n\nwhat this TV programme was\n\nwhere and when you watched it\n\nwhat it was about\n\nand explain why you did not enjoy it.\n\n[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nIndia is the land of over one billion population and accordingly there are numerous television channels with different attractive shows. Koffee with Karan is one of the television shows that I did not enjoy.\n\nThis was a television show, and to be more specific, this was a talk show in participation with the celebrities of India. The majority of the Bollywood celebrities attend on his show and shared their personal and professional events. The show is alleged to create a sense of controversy as the questions asked here are often inappropriate. Most of the times, Karan Johar used to ask private questions which were not supposed to be asked at all, and even media reports have also been made centring the issues. The show has different seasons and been closed for past two years after airing the season four in April of 2014. There are several reasons behind the closure and the directorial engagement of Karan is the key reason. But there are also chances that the show may commence again, shortly.\n\nI used to watch the show at my home after its initiation in 2014. Initially the show was a great success for the show makers. The show was aired on STAR World India and the other channels of the same network. The show was mostly made to reveal the secrets of the Bollywood celebrities before the audience. The show was aired in the evening and I used to watch the show at my own room. A sense of attraction worked here and knowing about the private events of the celebrities was always attractive to the audiences. The show actually had a witty appeal to us. Often I invited some of my intimate friends to come to my house and enjoy the show and it was great to us to enjoy it together. We used to discuss about the questions and the reactions of the celebrities.\n\nI think, mostly the show – Koffee with Karan was entirely made for increasing the TRPs of that specific television channel in India. The show created a sense of attraction for the audiences and the host was the key performer to raise the television rating point. The host used to ask such questions that often the stars and celebrities felt embarrassed for the nature of the questions. Often Karan tried to reveal some personal issues and focused on the scandals with the Bollywood celebrities. Moreover, the other private issues like familial matters, personal feelings etc. were also revealed on the show. Contemporary issues of the celebrities were asked and they used to reply against the questions. Sometime the celebrities tried to hide their private feelings but Karan tried his best to bring the issues on light.\n\nIn the early seasons of the show, I enjoyed them. But when I grew up and got matured, started understanding the value of privacy, the show started to lose its appeal from me. Asking irrelevant questions on a television show, insisting over answering the questions, flirting with the female celebrities, irritating them by asking private issues, raise of controversies over the issue, negative media reports etc. all made me to lose interest on it. Moreover, I have observed that when the celebrities were asked irrelevant or private questions, they used to provide misinformation to the audience and it appeared that they did not want the audience to know about them. Besides, the host had a possessive attitude during the show and it appeared that he was introducing the celebrity for the first time to the nation. It was his kindness that he invited the celebrity and without him, the celebrity was nothing. All these attitudes cast a negative impact on me over the show and I stopped watching it from its third season.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n10. Describe a day when you thought the weather was perfect.\n\nYou should say:\n\nwhere you were on this day\n\nhat the weather was like on this day\n\nwhat you did during the day\n\nand explain why you thought the weather was perfect on this day.\n\n[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nIt was a hot summer day. I was planning to move inside the city of Paris in France. The weather was perfect for a stroll in the city.\n\nUsually, I do not get out in the noon as the sun is too hot and the heat becomes unbearable. But I tried to do something unusual and started to move in the city of Paris. In fact, I had never taken leisurely walks in the city during the noon. So, this was a great experience to me. I had a sunglass in my eyes and a cap on head. Thereby, the heat had less effect on me. This was a sunny day of mid-June in 2015. As a student of the local university and a part-timer at a coffee shop, I did not get enough holidays but I took a day off on the day so that I could get around the city as the regular works and studies were a bit droning for me.\n\nThe day was bright and the sky was clear with a burning sun. Besides, there was some breeze which made the heat bearable to some extent. Initially, the weather was dull in the morning and I thought that it might rain, but my idea was wrong. Within an hour, the weather turned back to its natural form. The clouds were floating in the sky and the sun started shining. It was a perfect weather for taking a swim at any beach, but alas! There were no beaches near me where I could jump off. But I wandered the streets of the city, alone. None agreed to accompany me on the mid noon under the sun. Besides, the low wind was passing on which made the walking comfortable and I saw many of the people were doing the same. But some of them were walking with umbrellas or through the shaded areas.\n\nI had no exact plan about passing the day. So, I thought that I should walk along the streets and if I find something suitable for me, I should take part in. Accordingly, I started for the stroll under the burning sun. Suddenly, after walking for around half an hour, I met with one of my university friends who was going for watching a cinema at the adjacent theatre and proposed me to accompany him. But I humbly declined his proposal as I am unwilling to confine myself in a theatre whereas I am out to explore the city. So, started walking again, and when I felt thirst, I bought an ice-cream from a street vendor. After strolling for about one and half hour, I decided to take a rest. I took a seat at the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont. I passed about half an hour there and then started for my place again.\n\nIn fact, the summer is too hot in Paris and if you are out of the home without any protective measures, I am sure you are to suffer a lot. The first annoying thing is that you will sweat a lot, and have to carry a large hankie to remove the sweats from your face and body. This is a common issue for many of the people travelling in Paris at noon. Moreover, there are less shaded areas where you could take a shelter. But on the day when I got out, it was perfect as the sun was bright in moderate level. Though the sun heat was almost unbearable, the mild breeze has made it easier for me to take the walk. Usually, the summer days are hot and the temperature does not fall to a tolerable level, but on that day, there were some changes in the temperature. At the afternoon, the temperature fell to a great extent and walking became easier for me.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n11.

He is a Noble Prize winning writer.\n\nV S Naipaul was born on August 17 in 1932 and most of his writings contain comical elements. He is considered as a genius to provoke thoughts inside the readers. The writings of Naipaul are highly interesting to me. It appears that the events are taking place right before my eyes. Born in a Hindu family, he is well aware of the facts about the cast and creeds of the society and accordingly he has manifested the issues on his writings perfectly. Besides, the comical events of his writings are highly enjoyable and the readers need to have a perfect sense of humour to comprehend the comical events. Moreover, the endings of his writings are adorable indeed.\n\nNaipaul was born in Trinidad and it is known that his ancestors shifted to Trinidad from India in search of living. Most of the got involved into the local business and they did not have a close contact with their relatives living in India for some unknowns reasons. Besides, the generations of Naipaul was brought up in an environment when they had no scopes to meet with the relatives of their native land. He has mostly written novels on autobiography, travel and other relevant issues of life. He married Patricia Ann Hale in 1955. Hey had a very happy conjugal life that lasted till 1996 when Patricia died. She was the most important critique of Naipaul and helped him greatly to work on stories. Sometimes she also added her comments on his pieces to make them improved and Naipaul worked accordingly. Naipaul again married to Nadira Naipaul. He was awarded the Knighthood in 1989. The number of his books is over 30 and they include both the fictions and non-fictions.\n\nI actually want to find about his private life and know about his intellectual fame. He had to remain busy with different tasks for his living and at the same time, he has composed some masterpieces in global literature. His writings are adorable in many senses and most of the times, I have observed, the readers turn his fan after reading only a single piece of his writing. He has some magical sense to make people amazed with the words of his books. Some of the statements of his writings are so interesting that the readers could hardly stop laughing and imagine the situations. He has been writing for over 50 years and this is a kind of miracle to me. If I meet him someday, I would ask him about the inspirations behind his writing career.\n\nThere are different reasons to meet this writer. He is one of the greatest starts in the arena of world literature. Most of his writings are genuine and interesting to read. Besides, he is a man of great heart (as I have heard). Presently, a man like him is rare to find at. He is also a man of letters and I think if I could spend few moments with him, it would be a great advantage for me to learn many interesting things. If the writer permits, I also want to have some photos with him and his autograph on the book – A house for Mr Biswas, which is composed in 1961 and brought him a global reputation. Moreover, I also would like to know about his feelings and emotions about writing and how he applied the comical elements even in some serious situations.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n12.

The festival takes place at the end of the Holy month of Ramadan. Usually, the Muslims fast during the month of Ramadan, and this is a divine order and is considered as a pillar of the religion. The fasting hour begins with the rising of the sun and ends at the sunset. The Eid Ul Fitr takes place after the month-long fasting as a reward for them. They stop fasting from the Eid day and resume their regular life. This is really an extraordinary festival for us and I am proud of it. On the day, people in Pakistan pray in open fields in the morning which is known as Eid prayer. After the prayer, they meet and greet the other people and take foods. Wearing new dress is another feature of this festival and people are seen in new dresses.\n\nThere are many activities on the Eid day. Usually, people resume their regular lifestyle. During the fasting, eating or drinking after the sunrise and before the sunset is prohibited. Besides, some other specific tasks are also banned during the day times and people in Pakistan come back to the regular activities. Usually, they invite the other people on the day after the prayer and take delicious foods and sweets in the morning. Often rich foods are cooked for lunch or for dinner. This is the most awaited festival for the Muslim citizens of Pakistan. Sometimes they move out for visiting the neighbours and relatives. Exchanging greeting and small gifts is a common scene on the day. Most of the houses are filled with guests and people entertain or get entertained at the houses. Truly this is an event of joy for all of the Muslims living here.\n\nI like to get up early in the morning and get ready for attending the mass prayer on the day. I also like the festival more than anything but slightly dislike the foods especially the sweets. Almost all of the houses make foods and 60 percent of the foods taste sweet. At times, it becomes intolerable to consume too many sweet-flavored food items in a single day. However, I like the greetings most. We greet people and embrace them for three times. Interestingly, on this day, anyone can greet and embrace anyone even if they are not familiar. Moreover, people help the destitute people marking the day and share their joys and sorrows. One thing should be mentioned here that the bonding among the people is outstanding and clearly represents the fellow feelings for each other on this day.\n\nThe festival is important in Pakistan for many reasons. The first and the most important issue is that Pakistan is an Islamic country and majority of the citizens are Muslims. So, all the Islamic rules and regulations are followed here. People say their prayers regularly and follow the norms dictated in Islam. Accordingly, they continuously fast for a month. They try to reshape them with the divine instructions and try to apply the learning in their real life. Observance of Eid has been made as the part of following the religion. So, it is a must for each of the Muslims in Pakistan to observe the festival. This is not imposed rather the Muslims observe the day by their own will and participate in different activities which are made legal by the religion.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n13.

I was invited to appear on the formal written test for the post of MRE. As per the instructions, I applied for the position after collecting the advertisement from a daily newspaper. I applied following all the procedures instructed on the advertisement and accordingly they confirmed my candidature for the post after justifying my detailed curriculum vitae. They had sent me the invitation letter a week before the date. On the day fixed for the formal tests, I went there.\n\nI work for a local corporation and I am also responsible for their entire market research. So, I had to be very busy most of the time and the interview was set on a working day. It was set at 12.00pm sharp and I have to be there (at the headquarters of the corporation) at least 20 minutes before the test begins. So, I hurried there. I was asked to bring all the relevant documents with me including the printed version of the invitation to prove my candidature on the entrance. I took everything except the printed copy of the invitation card. I had printed a copy and kept that on my office desk. With the tension to reach the place in due time, I forgot to take the printed copy with me which caused me a great trouble.\n\nManaging the situations was so difficult for me. The security personnel did not allow me to enter in the building as I could not show them the interview card. I tried to make them realise that it was my mistake and due to the rush I forgot to bring that with me. But they argued a lot and by the same time I was racing against time. It was around 11.50 am and the security officials were arguing with me that why should they allow me to enter ins the building. I was like a security threat to them as I did not have the interview invitation card. It was a great regret for me. I also did not have any contact number then to inform the authority about the delay and the situation. Finally, I showed them the e-mail version of the interview card from my email. When they allowed me to enter the building, it was nearly 12.00 pm.\n\nThe feelings were not so good at that time. Can you imagine that you are racing against the moments and someone is blocking your advancement? The feelings are terrible. I am lucky that I use a smartphone with active internet connection. If I did not have the phone or the internet connection, I might not have been able to attend the interview. They took my written test, oral test, and I also had to present some ideas. Overall it was a fine interview but finally, I disagreed to occupy the position as they wanted to negotiate with me over the salary and other admissible benefits.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n14.

You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nTravelling is always pleasant, and if it is on a plane the joys know no bounds. Travelling on air has some special benefits and there are some people who prefer to travel on an aeroplane for some specific reasons.\n\nMr Nicholas Alberto, a Spanish national and businessman whom I share the apartment in Paris, loves to travel by plane. He is a perfect gentleman and I have never seen him travel by road for his business and other purposes. In fact, he loves to travel y planes for some benefits. The first and most important benefit, according to Mr Alberto, is the comfort. When he travels on a plane, he feels more comfortable than travelling by road or by sea. Besides, he prefers the speed. He believes that air travel is the speediest medium of transport. In fact, there are some truths in his belief. Travelling by air saves more time than travelling by the other possible means. He also adores the safety issues. To him, air travel is almost risk-free.\n\nI am a student of Paris College of Art and live in a rented apartment in Paris. My parents live in Strasbourg. Since my father is a government employee, he cannot leave his station and my mother is a high school teacher. So, I have to live alone in the city and I hired an apartment here to live in. As it was a bit expensive for me, I advertised for a roommate to be with me in the apartment. Accordingly, Mr Alberto arrived and both of us started sharing the apartment. It has been about three and a half years we are living under the same roof. He is a gentleman and most of the time he remains out of the home for his business purposes. But he shares the rent and some other necessary expenses for the apartment with me.\n\nMr Alberto has different business and he is solely responsible to look after all the things. So, he is always busy. He imports olive oil from Spain and distributes those in the local markets. Sometimes he also imports spices from different countries to be sold to the superstores and markets. As a result, he is always in a hurry. To maintain liaison with the Spanish businessmen and other people he has to travel in different parts of the globe. Sometimes he travels to Spain, his native land, sometimes in Asian countries including India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka to collect spices and other food ingredients. I heard him saying that he also travelled to the South American countries and have travelled almost half of the world.\n\nMr Alberto has some special theories of his own and he always follows them. I have some travelling experiences with him and found that he is fond of comfort. He never compromises with comfort even if he is to pay some extra bucks. Since the air travel is more comfortable, he travels by plane in every case. But if he is to travel inside France, he never uses the public transports rather hires cars from the car rentals even if it is a half an hour journey. Another important issue is that he is to maintain deadlines. If he is late to reach the destinations, he may have to experience losses. So, he does not want to take risks in this case. Travelling by planes is speedier and takes less time to reach places out of France. Besides, the travelling by plane is economic in many cases. You do not need to wait in a queue for tickets or suffer the solar heat in a clogged road. For all these reasons, Mr Alberto travels by planes in most of the time.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n15.

You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nDuring the last summer, in 2015, I went to Greece with my parents and other family members and had a long walk on the Olympus Mountain range. The walking lasted for about three and a half hours.\n\nWe walked through the entire range and enjoyed the natural beauties of the local areas. The mountain is considered as the second highest mountain in the country and also admired by both the local and international travellers for its association with the Greek mythology. Many events have taken place in the mountain and it was the residence of 12 Gods of Greek mythology. But currently, the hiking route and the natural beauty is the key attraction for the travellers. The walking routes contained large croplands, peaks, places for collecting foods and other necessary materials etc.\n\nWe started the walking using the international hiking path at the E4 starts and the walking ended at the Enipea springs. The entire walking distance was about 1100 meters. During the walking passage, we experienced some stunning natural scenes. The walking trails were marked clearly and there were many ascents and descents across the entire route which made the walking more enjoyable. When we started the walking, the river was left to us and we crossed some beautiful bridges made with wood. We also visited the Agios Dionysios Monastery, a beautiful place. The views of the Enipea waterfalls are breathtaking. Though there were some troubles to ascent and descent on the trail, the entire walking was enjoyable to me.\n\nI was accompanied by my family at the walk. The family members contained my parents, my elder brother and sister and my pet dog. We reached at the entrance with a car and then started the journey. It was interesting for me to walk such a long distance but all the other members could not enjoy like me. As I regularly participate in my college sports, I am physically more fit than the other members. Consequently, my parents and the elder sister had to experience some troubles. They were lagging behind often and could not keep pace with me and my elder brother. Besides, they just took breaks after every ten minutes with the excuse to drink water. However, it was a nice journey for us all.\n\nIt was my long desire to go for a long walk or hiking in the mountain. I have many experiences to walk in flat lands but walking ins a mountain trail was a completely new experience for me. During the walk in meadows, I did not have to undergo any stress but in this mountain walk, in fact, I had to take some stress like the other family members. They stopped frequently, but I controlled myself from the taking regular breaks, Moreover, the ascent and descent of the geographical structure also had some impacts on my body as during the upward slopes, I had to rely on the stick on my hand and sometimes I extended my hand to my mom while my elder helped my sister. When we reached near the waterfalls, everyone seemed to be relaxed as the journey was over.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n16.

You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nIt was an attractive advertisement of a US-based soft drink commonly known as 7up. It tastes lemon-lime and non-caffeinated as well. The advertisement is about the soft drink and how it is able to attract even a half-drawn cartoon. It shows that a young lady was sitting in a formal situation and she was busy in drawing a cartoon. When she was served the 7up, she stopped drawing the cartoon. But when the cartoon character sees the 7up, it draws itself and also draws a glass so that the lady could pour him the 7up. The advertisement was partially live and partially animated. The part of the drawing is live. A woman is sitting alone. She has nothing to do, so she starts drawing a piece of cartoon after her will. This is the live part. The animated part in the advertisement begins when the half-done cartoon starts drawing. The advertisement ends with the appreciation of the cartoon as it has got the drink finally.\n\nI saw the advertisement on television. When I was a kid, the advertisement was televised regularly. I cannot recall the exact dates and times but as far I remember, it was the 1990s when the advertisement was aired. It was a popular advertisement and thus it was aired amid different programmes during the peak hours. But interestingly, before watching the advertisement, it heard it from one of my elementary school friends who watched the advertisements. It was he, Smith, who helped to be familiar with this specific advertisement. In fact, after being familiar with the advertisement, I waited eagerly to watch the advertisement. It was one of my favourite advertisements in my childhood and even I miss it today.\n\nThe content of the advertisement was the promotion of a soft and non-alcoholic drink, 7up. The origin of 7up goes back to the USA. In 1920, the drink was created and the lemon-lime formula appeared in 1929. Originally it was named as Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda. It was also considered as medicine for stabilising people’s mood. Many of the people with bad moods have used it as medicine to improve their mental stability. The brand has experienced numerous ups and downs. It has been sold several times from a group to another. A good number of variations could be found in the drink but many of the users have opined that 7up Lime is the best.\n\nUsually, the children remember anything they see or do in their early age. In most of the cases, it has been found that they can recall the past incidents more than the adults. When I was a kid of 7 years, I was exposed to this advertisement. At that time, watching the advertisement was a kind of entertainment for me. Sometimes I also tried to draw a cartoon and kept a bottle of 7up near me believing that the cartoon will start drawing itself. But I was wrong and the cartoon never drew itself on the page as it did on television. Being a child, I had no idea then that everything we have seen on television was not real. So, I felt sad and discussed the issue with my friends who laughed at me for my obsession. For all such reasons, the advertisement has set itself in my mind. I have seen a good number of advertisements but did not care for them. As a grown up man, I now believe that everything we see is unreal. There are always some hidden issues. But as I have lots of memories with the specific advertisement, this is unforgettable to me.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n17.

The country has gained independence in 1947 and by the same time got separated from Pakistan.\n\nIt was truly difficult to divide the countries based on the religious beliefs and the issue was a potential one during the independence period. At that time, people started killing each other based on their religious views which went beyond control. As a result, the necessity of two sovereign states appeared before the Congress and the creation of India and Pakistan was done. The Hindu people started living in India while the Muslims started living in Pakistan. A great dispute arose inside the continent only over the religious views and the followers of one religion could not tolerate the followers of the other religion. So, the higher authorities got worried over the issue and they started to ponder over the separation. The then British government finally separated the two states and the separation is also better known as the Independence Day for Pakistan and India. Now Pakistan observes the day on August 14 while India celebrates the day on the following day – August 15. Due to the separation, some of the parts have still been disputed and some of the parts of Kashmir have occupied space of both of the countries which also create conflicts between the countries. There are no solutions have been found yet against the problem.\n\nThe entire region was ruled by the British Empire before the partition. When the British started exploiting the natives, a sense of deep dissatisfaction emerged among the locals and they started anti-British movements aiming to gain independence. But at the same time, there were some communal riots inside the country which killed a notable number of people following Hinduism and Islam. So, the issue turned into a concerning one for the British government and then it decided to wrap up its rule from the region. But when the decision was made, a demand came for tow independent states to reduce the communal riots. In the communal riots, it is estimated that around two million people were killed of different religions. As a result, the Congress decided to make to sovereign states named India and Pakistan. Later Pakistan was split into two states named Pakistan and Bangladesh while India was named as the Union of India (and later the name was changed to the Republic of India). Due to the partition, Bengal turned into the province of Pakistan and consequently gained independence from a bloody war in 1971. After the partition, many of the Muslims migrated in Pakistan while many members of following the other regions migrated in India.\n\nThe then entire Congress was behind the partition and the name of Mahatma Gandhi is a remarkable one with the name of Jawaharlal Nehru, Sarojini Naidu, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and Maulana Azad among others is notable. Each of them has played important roles to achieve the independence and separation of the country. Though Mahatma Gandhi did not want to split the country based on religious conflicts and unstable situation, later he changed the mind. He agreed to the separation and thought that would be beneficial for all the people following different religious beliefs.\n\nTo be frank, the independence and separation of India and Pakistan are of great benefits for the both the Hindus and the Muslims. Due to communal beliefs, they got involved in riots which took away many innocent lives. By the same time, the situations inside the country turned worse for several reasons. The scenarios could have worsened if the necessary declarations would not come to separate the countries. Finally, the declaration of two sovereign states resolved the issue. After the separation, a mass migration took place between the countries and currently they are moving for progress. If the separation was not made at the right time, the communal killings would raise more than imagination. The Hindus were on the view that in the country they are the majority and the Muslims should not get privilege like them. One the other side, the Muslims did not obey the directives and this got locked into disputes which caused the riots. So, for the separation there are no such riots are prevailing and people are living peacefully. Thereby, the independence and partition were important for the country.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n18.

The birth of my elder son, Johnn, was one of the most important days in my life. It was the evening of 23rd December in 2009 when the boy landed on the planet.\n\nWhen Georgina became pregnant, we two started counting days for our baby to come on earth. She had to undergo lots of physical and mental stress during the entire pregnancy period. Since she was a school teacher, she had to go for lecturing at the classes and I waited for her before her school to bring her back at home in the evening when the classes were over. I know it was troublesome for her to continue the profession after being pregnant. I also tried hard to prevent her continuing the teaching but she was reluctant to give up then. It was also hard for me to manage time in every evening to be with her. But my office considered the issue and allowed me every day to leave early. And finally, two days before the Christmas, Johnn came to the earth. It was a snowy evening and all of us were greatly tensed about the safety of the mother and the kid during the delivery process as the doctor made a bit late to reach for snow.\n\nIn fact, I was in my office that day and Georgina was at home. She had taken a maternity leave of six months from her school commencing around a week before the day. She informed me over the telephone about her sudden abdominal discomfort and I suggested her to go to the nearby hospital with my mother in law who was accompanying her. Accordingly, she went to the Beamunt Hospital, a few blocks away from our residence in Dublin, and the emergency medical officers informed me that she needs a C-section. I agreed and started from my office to the hospital. Being a foul weather, it was snowy and the traffic was unusual than the other days. When I reached the hospital, I found her at the operation theatre and all of them were waiting for the doctor’s arrival. Finally, the C-section was done and we got our baby boy. Really it was a great day for all of us with the arrival of the baby.\n\nAt the Beamunt Hospital, I was accompanied by my parents and the other members of my own and in-law’s family. My mother-in-law brought Georgina at the hospital in my absences and did all the necessary things like making phone calls to the other relatives and they reached at the hospital one after another. Around 25 people gathered at the hospital marking the birth of my child. It was a kind of festival for them as this was the first kid in the family after a long time. So, all of the relatives were too excited and happy over the incident. They congratulated me on the event and prayed for the betterment of the boy in the days ahead. I was surprised as well when I saw that some of the relations had brought some gifts for the newborn baby and wanted to hand over the gifts to me. It was also pleasant matter for me and their care for my boy also amazed me indeed.\n\nThe day was important to me as it was the day of my fatherhood. I turned father for the first time and the feelings are inexpressible in words. My son, Johnn, has turned six in last year. The little baby is growing up and I have admitted him in the local elementary school. He is like a blessing to me. I always try to meet all of his demands and when he desires for something, he does not calm down until his desire is met. He is likea replica of my childhood said my parents and he never stops his activities unless he is taken before the television set to enjoy cartoons. Still, I remember the day when he was born and took him in my lap. He was covered with a thick white towel and he could not even see then. He was looking like an angel and all of us waited for his arrival. Though he was supposed to be late, he came early and there were no complications with his birth. The C-section was successful and required no extra troubles. So, the day was important to me earlier and still it is today.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n19.

This is a unique building in the world that has gained attention from the global travellers and I went there in last year as a team member of German Cultural Affairs.\n\nThe Taj Mahal is, in fact, a tomb located on the south bank of Yamuna River in Agra in India. This is a mausoleum and has been made in remembrance of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal to make her memory immortal. The body of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan lies under the large dome. This is the only historical building in India that has been placed on the list of Wonders of the World. The construction date is exactly not known but it is estimated that the construction began around 1600 century. The entire building is made of white marble. Besides, the structure took over 20 years to complete while 20,000 workers were involved with the construction. It is rumoured that the emperor had cut the hands of the workers who made the structure so that they cannot make another such building on the planet. Though the event is highly brutal, it shows the deep love and respect to his wife. One of the important factors about the building is that the colour of the building changes with the change of time in the day time and it looks best on a moonlit night.\n\nThe Taj Mahal is also considered as the Crown of Palaces for its huge dome and white marbles. It is a beautiful structure and looks pretty awesome for the construction style and exterior design. The entire complex is situated on around 42 acres of lands and bounded by walls on sides. The traditional Persian designs have been applied here in line with the Mughal architecture. The ideas of the structure have been derived from several Mughal structures and have been customised according to Shah Jahan’s will. Before the construction of the Taj Mahal, the Mughals used red sandstone on their structure while this was the exception from their traditional construction style. The entire building has been made of pure white marble and the tomb has been refined perfectly with precious stones that resemble the choice and preference of the emperor. The top dome is about 35 meters high and cylindrical. The central dome is accompanied with four smaller domes and those are placed at a corner of the roof. The main dome is frequently termed as onion dome for its shape and visually it is great to look at. The minarets are similar to those used in Mosques. So far it is known that the construction of the structure was done by 1643 and it costs over 30 million rupees.\n\nThe Taj Mahal is located in Agra, under the northern part of Uttar Pradesh state in India. The building is placed by the side of the Yamuna River. This is around 204 kilometres away from Delhi. This is also a World Heritage Site and has been selected in 1983 after the UNESCO declaration. Agra is an influential city in India and been playing a great role. The place has also been recognised in some of the Hindu scriptures and epics like Mahabharata. Besides, Agra was the capital of Mughal Empire in the medieval age and been ruled by several powerful emperors like Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan. The city is now one of the major tourist spots in India and the Taj Mahal is playing the leading role here. Despite being a crowded city the site for the Taj Mahal has been picked carefully and always calm and quiet. The location was also picked smartly for some strategic reasons and the most important thing was the view of the building from his palace – Agra Fort.\n\nThe Taj Mahal has been related to the Indian history immediately after its construction in the 16th century. This is considered as one of the Muslim art of India that has been globally recognised. Besides, during the construction process, a varied number of incidents took place which is also remarkable in terms of historical importance. Besides, the entire complex took 20 years to complete which is a rare incident. The most important historical fact is that the Taj Mahal was made when the Mughals were at the peak of their power and wealth. As a result, Shah Jahan has used precious stones and gems to decorate the tomb. After his death, the Mughal Empire started declining and could not stand back like the former days. To make the structure, artists, masons and other workers were recruited from different nations including India, Iran and Turkey. So, this is a great place of historical importance.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n20.

You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nHumans have always been dreaming of living in a luxurious house and accordingly my dream is also similar with the other human beings. I want to live in a large and luxurious house as I do not want experience any challenge with my living at home.\n\nThe house should be a duplex building with spacious rooms and corridors. There should be ample space for movement after placing the furniture. Besides, the rooms need to be well ventilated and south facing is preferable. Generally, the south-faced houses have natural light and air supply. So, one does not need to spend more bucks after electricity or arrangement for artificial air coolers. Besides, the houses should also contain several bedrooms. The living room needs to be spacious as I have to place a wide range of furniture than the regular living rooms in the tiny apartments. Besides, the house should have sufficient numbers of bathrooms with modern fittings and facilities. I would like to have a balcony with my bedroom facing the south side from where I could smell the fragrance from the garden. At the night times, I will place a chair on the balcony to enjoy the night views, especially the moonlit nights.\n\nThough I love rural regions than the urban areas for a tranquil environment, I wish to have the house at the corner of an urban street. I chose to live in a corner of the city for several reasons. First, such corner areas are usually free of the bustle of the cities. Since there are few crowds the noise level remains at a minimum level that is pleasant. Secondly, the cities are blessed with modern facilities which are unavailable in the rural areas. The connections of the internet or large shopping malls or standard groceries are not available. But I need those to lead my life. Generally, the rural areas are quiet and I will create such an environment around my house. But if the house is in the centre or middle of any street, it is impossible to bring the rural flavour inside the house. If I surround the house with foliage and gardens, it will look like a large house in the rural areas. Moreover, I will have access to the necessary places and public transportation facilities which are also rare in the rural areas.\n\nThe house should have all the modern amenities and facilities. It should have a telephone connection to connect with the rest of the world in line with my cellular phone. Besides, internet connection with satellite television network is a must. I usually do not watch television but my parents do. For them, I need to satellite television network. The house should also have a fine garage to keep my Porsche 911 (though older, the car is of great use) with me. A small driveway is a plus with the garage. The doors should be made with the finest woods while the windows would be made of Thai glass window without any grills or restrictions. The roof of the house should also be large and I intend to plant some small plants on the rooftop garden. Besides, the entire building should have the opportunity to cover with small plants that go attached to the walls. The other issues like the fittings, tiles and necessary elements in the kitchen and bathrooms should be of the top class.\n\nI generally prefer to live in a large house for its benefits. I have been born and brought up into a large house and being a nuclear family we did not have many family members except the three of us (my parents and me). So, I had ample spaces to move on inside the house and play around the day. So, the habit of living in a large house has been formed since my early childhood. I cannot live in small apartments and those appear like a cage to me. Breathing becomes difficult (literally). Besides, I also need a quiet place to live in. So, I need a large house with all the available facilities of the modern days and at the same time, it should be peaceful. Neither my parents nor I prefer noise and do not make so as well. A silent environment in a large house is the most desired thing for me and my family.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n21. Talk about something you or someone you know collects.\n\nYou should say:\n\nwhat you or this person collects\n\nhow the collection is stored\n\nhow quickly the collection is growing\n\nand say what kind of person would enjoy collecting that thing, and why?\n\n[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nCollecting foreign coins is my hobby and many of my relations bring foreign coins for me. I have a huge collection of coins while some of them are aged over centuries.\n\nCoins are different for me. I like to collect coins and I have a rare collection of coins where many of the coins belong to early of the 19th century. Some of my relations are on the view that collecting the coins will bring no benefits for me but I do it from my passion. I am well aware that coin collections are not the sources of income and I am not a reputed collector as well, I collect the metals only to meet my desire to get them. The beautiful descriptions on the coins attract me most and I also could imagine a bit how the situations were in those days when the coins were used for transactions. Sometimes I try to feel the touches of the people gone with the age who have used the coins.\n\nI actually do not follow any standard way to store coins rather I have my own style. I have bought a large size book with plastic pockets inside instead of paper. It is like an album where photos are kept. I place the coins inside the pockets and write names of the country or origins. At times I use scotch tapes to paste the coins with the pages. I, in fact, do not follow any system of procedure as those appear complex to me. I collect coins for my own interest and thereby it is unnecessary for me to follow any specific rules or methods which are done during exhibitions. I was motivated to collect coins from my childhood and nurtured it as my hobby. The coins are stored only for my personal enjoyment and even I do not show the collection to anyone else. This is my own world.\n\nThe collection book has been almost filled up with coins and it took about 16 years for me to collect all the coins I have now. I have collected the coins of different states and tried to gather all types of available coins from the countries. Sometimes my relatives who went to travel in different countries brought the coins for me as they knew I am a junior coin collector. Sometimes I have purchased the coins from commercial stores selling foreign coins and currencies. But I had to pay more during the collection from the money exchangers and most of the times they did not want to sell single coins or small amount. Thereby, the coins are my greatest wealth of my life. I had to spend lots of times in collecting the coins and sometimes I had to fight with the other boys of my class who wanted to grab my collection.\n\nCoin collection is not a very easy task and requires a lot of unnecessary hours to gather all the coins together. Moreover, neither the task is not exciting nor it provides any financial or other benefits to the collectors. So, people who want enjoyment with their hobbies cannot be successful coin collectors. Coins are only pieces of metal and sometimes you even cannot use them in your need. So, if you collect coins, it will incur you loses as sometimes you are to buy them at a higher cost than you expect. Besides, this is not the thing to show off. So, a person who is introvert like can collect coins. If you exhibit your coins to your surrounding people, they may not appreciate the collection after your desired level which may make you mentally upset. So, the extrovert people will not be as much delighted like the introvert. Therefore, I think coin collection is a great hobby for the inquisitive people.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n22. Describe something enjoyable you can do on a computer.\n\nYou should say:\n\nwhat it is\n\nwhat equipment or software you need to do that\n\nwhy and how often you do it\n\nand explain why you enjoy doing this on a computer.\n\n[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nThe computer is comparatively a latest invention and still is being modified with numerous upgrades. Using Microsoft PowerPoint to create visual presentations is an interesting task for me.\n\nMicrosoft PowerPoint is an application on computer operated with windows operating system. This is actually a way to make presentations and present them before audiences. It is a great way to present a large number of things and also helpful to get the issues clearly. Saying goes that a picture is worth thousand words and it is true for the PowerPoint presentations. The program allows the users to place photos or add video clips that could be played during the presentation. I am greatly benefited with the application. When the topics are discussed through the application, the discussions become easier and the listeners could be able to comprehend the discussed issues, not for the presenting style of the presenter rather than the multimedia clips and images make it simple for them.\n\nInitially, a personal computer is enough to make the presentation. You can check the presentation on your computer screen and it is appropriate for small scale. But when I plan for a larger audience, I have to take a couple of tools and stuff including a laptop, a projector machine, a large screen and screen stand. I connect the projector to the laptop and then project the presentation on the screen set a few yards away from the projector. The larger the projector is set, the bigger the images are. Besides, I need amplifiers as well to make sounds that I add with the presentation.\n\nWhen I entered the high school as a junior lecturer, I had to take classes without any multimedia system. But this was an old technique to take classes and proved failure for the students to comprehend any specific issues on the class. So, I started making presentations over the specific issues to make the thing clear to the students. That was done after lots of struggles and had also taken permission from the school authority. But now I am taking classes regularly with the system and have made lots of presentations over the mathematical issues. Now I use the presentations around five days in a week when I take classes. But I specifically use the presentations to make the complicated issues clearer for the students. There are some other teachers who prefer to put all the things on their presentations to exhibit before the class.\n\nMaking power point presentations are good for me and it is interesting as well. Sometimes I have to add pictures of mathematical terms or equations which I collect from different sources from the internet and check properly about the copyright issues. Sometimes, I make videos by myself with my smartphone or insert small movies clips on the presentation related to the discussing issues so that the kids could understand effortlessly. The top most important factor is that the students are performing much better than they before in my course. Thereby, I like to make power point presentations on a computer. Their success inspires me to make more presentations and make their studies easier.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n23. Talk about a musical instrument you would like to be able to play.\n\nYou should say:\n\nwhat musical instrument it is\n\nwhat it looks like\n\nwhat it sounds like\n\nand explain why you would like to be able to play it.\n\n[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nI love music and prefer the heavy metal genre. Thereby, I am accustomed to the electric guitar and would like to be able to play it someday.\n\nThere is a wide range of guitars are available and the history of guitar dates back to the 12th century. It was introduced as a musical instrument in Europe, then. Afterwards, guitars underwent lots of modification. An electric guitar is a modern invention and used to play different base tones with amplification. Basically, the electric guitars could be of different size and shape, but the common electric guitars are found with bodies like hollow, semi-hollow or solid. I prefer the solid body for it is a bit heavier than the hollow body guitars. The sound is amplified with a radio transmitter or pitch cable and in some cases, the sounds could also be modified for the electric guitar. When played, the electric guitar is able to create an intolerable sound as well for the modern amplification system.\n\nThe electric guitars have a majestic look with different parts of it. The parts include the headstock, nut, tuning pegs, frets, inlays, truss rod, neck joint, strings, saddle, fretboard, body, pickups, pots, bridge, pickguard, sound board, sound hole, sides, back part etc. With the combination of all these components, a guitar usually looks different from the other musical instrument. They usually look slim and sophisticated with the sleek design. But the guitars look different with their solid body design when they are played and the solid body design become famous after the Second World War. Different sorts of strings are used in electric guitars like lighter string or heavier strings etc. With the lighter strings, the guitar looks dissimilar and sometimes appears that there are no strings at all when you look at the guitar from a distance while the heavier strings look good with the trimmed guitar body.\n\nWell, the tones and sounds of electric guitar are different from the other guitars, especially from the acoustic guitars. The sounds may appear harsh in the beginning if it is not followed by any tone. When the electric guitar is in full fledge the tones are highly enjoying and without its presence, it appears that the music is incomplete then. The sounds are sometimes higher and lower and mostly depend on the strokes on the strings by the guitarist. If you tap slightly on the strings, the sound will be lower while if you raise the volume level, the minor tape will be heard like an explosion as well.\n\nI along with four of my friends have planned to form a heavy metal band. We are also planning to compose and sing songs initially on a small scale and then we will try to grow our band. I am assigned with the duties of bass guitarists and thus I have to learn to play the guitar, particularly the electric guitar. Electric guitars help to raise the musical beauty. The heavy tone brings a sense of thrill among the audience and the performers on the stage.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n24.

Consequently, there are a great number of restaurants and eateries have been formed to meet the hunger of the people.\n\nPhysically located in 19 Persiaran KLCC, Troika Sky Dining is my favourite place to eat out. This is a large wide space to enjoy the foods and I mostly come to take my dinners here, occasionally. The impressive look is one of the key causes of visiting the restaurant frequently and the upper space also allows me to see the city at the night as it is on the top floor of the building. The restaurant offers a grand view of Kuala Lumpur and the views are breathtaking particularly in night times. The entire city is illuminated with colourful lights, vehicles are moving from here and there on the streets. The other important reason for falling in love with this restaurant is its yummy foods and cordial services. It is a different experience for me to eat inside the dining rooms of the restaurants which is filled with all ages of people.\n\nThough the restaurant is located at a crowded place, it could be differentiated from the other restaurants and for its special and delicious foods. The restaurant, Troika Sky Dining, serves almost all kind of foods to the people. Since the restaurant is located at a prominent place in the city, a large number of visitors come here every day and thus considering the wide number of visitors, it arranges for all types of dishes as per requirements. There are two dining spaces accompanied with a bar to meet the thirst of the visitors. The restaurant is mostly famous for the traditional Malaysian cuisine. The bar is also enriched and offers all types of soft and hard drinks at a reasonable price. Taking foods at a high altitude is a really awesome experience for the visitors and thus they return like me whenever they could manage time. If anyone wants to enjoy the meal here, it is important to take at least a three-course meal to get the real tastes. But it is not only the foods; it is also about the services and other cordial environments that attract the visitors.\n\nThe décor inside the restaurant is exquisitely designed with modern architecture and enough to make anyone feel comfortable. The restaurant inside is highly decorated with modern furniture and amenities that is only found in the star rated restaurants. There are two separate dining spaces for the visitors while both of the dining rooms have access to the wine bar. The seats are limited and thus they serve on the ‘first come first served’ basis. Some of the seats at the restaurant are located by the side of the large window to enjoy the skyline of Kuala Lumpur. You can also get some sofas or small chairs and tables placed inside the restaurant for resting after the heavy meals. The wine bar is also furnished with valuable furniture and organised in a professional manner. The tables are made with the finest glass while the chairs and seats are made easily for the comfort of the visitors to sit back in a relaxed mode. One of the distribution desks is attached with a heavy glass while the other one is out of glass.\n\nI like the restaurant most for several reasons. First of all, the location is accessible from any part of the city. The industrial skyline view of the restaurant is wonderful and particularly the night view is best indeed. The staffs are well trained and behaved and they welcome the guests with a cordial heart. I have observed their behaviours and found that there is nothing artificial with their attitudes and behaves with the guests, it is entirely natural. The other important fact is the foods. They serve warm and fresh cooked foods. Considering the charges, I think this is the best place for me to eat out in the entire city.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n25. Talk about something you like doing during the winter.\n\nYou should say:\n\nwhat you do\n\nwhere you do it\n\nwhat clothes or equipment you need\n\nAnd explain why you like doing it during the winter.\n\n[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nGreece is a land of ancient history. A wide range of historical events has taken place in the land. Besides, in the current days, the country takes different looks in different seasons. It looks most beautiful during the winter season. There are a good number of things to do in Greece during the winter. Thus, I do not need to worry much about things to do in this season. I mostly like to participate in special winter film festivals held in Thessaloniki each year and I will go there this year as well. I like to watch movies on the festivals and enjoy walking on the streets illuminated with colourful lights during the festival time. The entire location takes the shape of a festive mood and the night views are breathtaking. Moreover, when if I have more times to spend, I either read novels published from home and abroad or pass the leisure hours with my family and friends by inviting them at my place.\n\nUsually, the festival takes place in Thessaloniki in Greece and the place is occupied with events round the year. I come to visit the place particularly in winter as the climate is adorable and watching movies are great fun to me during this time of the year. Besides, there are some other places as well where I take the walk in the evening hours to remove my day-long boredom. Mostly I visit the sea shore where one can have the breezes, free of all forms of pollutions, is found that will take away all of your tiredness. Sometimes I go to the downtown of Thessaloniki and this is a very populous place. People of almost all countries are found here and mostly they come to visit the historical places.\n\nTo continue the visit at the festivals during the winter, I need some heavy clothes to prevent the cold. Since the locality is laid by the sea front, there are too cold comparing the other parts of the city. The movies are screened on the island harbour area and when the shows are on outdoor; the freezing wind is felt severely. So, I take proper precautionary measures. Generally, when I go to the festivals, I wear a heavy jacket, cover my head with a woolen cap, a heavy pant, wear hand gloves and then cover me with a woolen overcoat. In a word, I make myself wind-proof. It is truly enjoyable for me. I learnt to cover myself from a real life experience a couple of years ago. I came to enjoy a movie on the film festival and had caught a severe cold for the surrounding environment. That was a practical lesson for me.\n\nWinter is the best season in Greece. The entire environment remains calm and quiet. The nature turns pale a bit but that brings a different look to them. Besides, the crowds are not seen on the regularly crowded places and thus the streets are free of noises. In such moments, I feel comfort to watch movies or read books alone. In fact, to me, it appears that being alone in winter makes me feel better for several reasons. The most important factor is that I can feel entirely alone. The feelings of enjoying a movie alone cannot be expressed in words and when it is by the side of a sea, the feelings turns very special. Besides, reading the novels at room heated by charcoal is also outstanding. When I feel lonely most, then I invite the friends or the other family members to accompany me. Then I arrange for a small private party.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n26. Talk about a sport or exercise that you do for fitness.\n\nYou should say:\n\nwhat it is\n\nhow often you do it\n\nwhy you do it\n\nand explain how this activity or sport helps your fitness.\n\n[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nWalking is a good form of exercise and requires less physical efforts than any other regular forms of exercise. I walk regularly in the morning to keep my body fit.\n\nI want to talk about one of the most popular forms of exercise - walking. Walking has a wide range of health benefits. It makes the people fit and the most important thing is that the people who walk do not need any external instruments to perform the walk. Moreover, it is convenient to all ages of people. There is no preset speed or distance is set for walking. So, an individual can have the walk after his or necessity. But in some cases when walking is prescribed by a doctor to prevent any specific physical illness or disorder, then you are to follow the prescribed distance to get cured.\n\nWell, I usually take the walk in the early hours of the day and take it every day. I have no physical disorders or any other troubles but I go for the walk to have a grand opening for the day. Usually, on the weekends, I take a break from the walk. You know the weekend nights are too exciting in Singapore streets and thus I cannot get back at home before midnight. If you were me, it would have been tougher for you too to get up at 5.30am for the walk. So, I take the breaks on the weekends. But on the other days, I do not miss the walk and also have formed a team of walkers who accompany me in the early morning. I have two neighbours who are also conscious about their health and thus we three move for the walk in the city street.\n\nDo you know that walking is the best form of free hand exercise? I think you are well informed about it. In fact, walking does not need any specific cause to perform and the benefits are more than your imagination. I get the walk done in the morning so that I can have a healthy beginning of the day. When I go out for the walk, I have the chance to breathe in the fresh air. Besides, the surrounding environment is calm and quiet. There are not traffics on the roads and everything remains silent which is not found in the other times of the day. So, I walk in the morning. Besides, I have to sit all the time in my office (the boring desk job) and lack the required movements to burn calories I intake. Though the calories are not harmful now, they contain the potentials to affect me after few years if I do not care about them from now. This is another important issue for me to walk in the morning.\n\nThe morning walk is helping me to a great extent to maintain my fitness level. I have been walking for around three years and as a result, my weight is under control and the heartbeat follows the regular rhythm while many of my colleagues have gained weight only for their desk job whereas I have been fit as I was in the beginning days of my job. Moreover, the morning walk makes my mind fresh and I feel lucky to breathe in the fresh air. Usually, the air is hot and polluted in the busy hours in this Lion city and I also cannot manage enough spaces to walk speedily. So, I have picked the morning to get the walk. Besides, it gives me the energy to deal all the challenges at my office. Moreover, I can think clearly which I believe is the benefit of walking as it keeps my thoughts cool always.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n27.

You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nTime is priceless and once you lose it, you are to pay heavily for the wastage of the moments. I missed a job interview for being late and I feel regret for that late even today.\n\nI was called for a formal interview at Unilever against the post of communications manager. I applied for the post about two months ago and they asked me to attend the written test first. I attended at the test and become one the tenth applicants who have passed the test. Then the authority told us to contact later and accordingly I received the latest email asking me to join at the formal interview. But unfortunately, I could not attend the interview in time and lost the chance to attend on the job.\n\nIn Mumbai, traffic congestion is a common scenario. Many of the people have to get stuck in the traffic jam in the early hours of the morning every day and the scenarios are worst the central area where almost all the important offices are located. I started for the interview about one hour before of the mentioned time but could not reach in time there. At first, I stood in a bus queue and when the bus arrived I could not manage to ride as the bus was already packed with office going passengers. So, I failed to board in the bus and waiting for the next metro service will be late for me. Immediately I hired an auto to reach the Unilever office. I think my luck betrayed me on that day so that I could not go for the interview. I got stuck again in the middle of the road.\n\nInitially, I felt that my luck in not favouring me and losing the chance to appear on the interview was frustrating me as well. Thereby, I felt a deep sense of anger. Traffic congestion is a common scenario in India and the common citizens are the worst sufferers. They cannot go to their places at the right time. I did not have the idea how actually they felt when they missed their appointments. The delay on the interview taught me actually how the feelings of those people were. At last, I felt pity for me as I could not go to my current office in time and also made late for the interview at the same time.\n\nFinally, I appeared before the Unilever office building about one and a half hour later of the scheduled time. When I entered the interview room, I found that the interviews were going to be ended and when I informed the interview reception that I am one of the candidates, they allowed me to sit for the interview. But since I was late, they, in fact, did not show much interest and simply asked few questions about myself. With the behaviour and attitudes of the interview board members, I understood that I am discarded from the list.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n28. Describe a person who you believe dresses well.\n\nYou should say:\n\nwho this person is\n\nwhat kind of dresses he/she wears\n\nhow you know him/her\n\nan explain why you think this person dresses well.\n\n[You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nSaying goes that a man is judged by his clothes. In true sense, clothing is a very special thing to make people feel noticed and Mr. Samuel Robertson, my teacher for English languages dresses very well.\n\nBeauty depends on a good dress. Having a good dress is one of the prerequisites to be count. People mostly ignore the individuals with poor or below standard clothing. So, to maintain the society and get valued, one needs to maintain proper dress code or dress well. Mr. Robertson is my English language instructor in the colleges and I have never seen him dress informally. Even when I went to meet him at his home for some instructions over an essay composition, I find him in formal attires too. Once asked about the formal dress, he replied that he never compromises with his dresses and loves to be formal every time except when he is in sleeping mode.\n\nMr. Robertson usually wears formal suits. He has several suits and they are of different colours. He wears leather shoes with the shoes. Besides, his colour combination is also adorable. He combines his shirts with the suit colours. For instance, when he is in his black suit, he wears a white formal shirt along with a red tie. When he is wearing a blue suit, he wears a black shirt with a dark coloured tie. Besides, his tie knotting styles are different and he never ties the knot in the same way as he did on his last working day. He back brushes his hair with soft hair gel which makes an outstanding look for him.\n\nLast summer I got admitted in British Council in Paris and met Mr. Samuel Robertson. The British council authority assigned Mr. Robertson, a British national, for us to learn pure British English. So, he accordingly instructs us English. I have developed English very well after attending the course. Mr. Robertson teaches the language spontaneously and as we are all professionals here, he also allows meeting him after the class or invites at his home if anyone fails to meet him after the class. He is active in social networking and all of his students are linked with him either on Twitter or via Facebook.\n\nIt is solely my own observation and opinion that the British people love to be formal. They are a formal nation and prefer to maintain the formalities and customs everywhere. Regarding their dress code, they also want to continue the formal tradition and literally they do it. I have seen him even in the hot summer day he is in his black suit which would be uncomfortable for me or anyone else of the class. The sense of being formal everywhere might be deeply graved in their minds. So, they are always formal. But it should not be taken as a negative remark. In the current days, a well-dressed body is also required with a wise brain to bloom.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n29.

In fact this was a small fishing town where people now come mostly for water sport on the wave and on the sandy beach, enjoy the sunset, play with dolphins, and other recreational activities.\n\nCommonly it is known as the J-Bay, this is an exotic location near the Port Elizabeth under the Eastern Cape region. This is the place where several hundred surfers come annually to surf on the famous blue sea waves and enjoy the natural beauties of the locality. The small town mostly attracts the international surfers for different reasons. The surfers enjoy the surfing during the morning and evening hours. They also take sunbath, swim in different hours of the day or enjoy the sunrise in line with the sunset. They cannot leave the location easily for its extraordinary beauty.\n\nGeographically, J-Bay is located adjacent to the N2 Highway. It is also 75 kilometers southwest of the Port Elizabeth. The entire town is under the domination of Eastern Cape Province governance. Earlier, it was a tiny town where only fishermen lived and now the area of the town is expanding to accommodate the extensive tourists and guests. As a result, the entire environment of the J-Bay has become relaxed and wonderful. Sea shells and gorgeous white sandy beach are the key attractions for the surfers and tourists. The town has expanded more after the 1960s when it was used as a location for filming the movie ‘Endless Summer’. Since then different advancements are underway.\n\nThe entire J-bay looks wonderful. The white sandy beach glitters by the sunlight and appears that stars glittering on the land. The sunrise and sunset scenarios are also breathtaking and mostly attract romantic couples from home and abroad. The waves are interesting and famous around the world. The city does not need to decorate marking any occasion because it is well decorated round the year to welcome the tourists. But the night view of the town is highly charming and sitting by the beach makes a sense of deep relaxation. Thereby, hundreds of visitors are found in the evening and sometimes they sit by the picturesque beach silently.\n\nThe J-Bay is very special for me because I have lots of memories here, particularly with the beach. I learnt surfing in my teenage with my father and the memories are still vivid in memory. This is the place where I proposed my fiancé to marry me in presence of our relatives. When I was a kid, I used to come here with my neighboring friends to swim and participate in other forms of water sports etc. When I had mental troubles, I used to (and still I do) come here to relax and think deeply to get the better solution. Considering all the aspects, the J-Bay is a great place for me and I do not need to go anywhere else to pass my leisure. I am in love with the white sandy beach!\n\n{/sliders}\n\n30.

You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nChange is the key to development and my city Calamba is also changing gradually. Infrastructural developments are the key changes in the area.\n\nIn the Philippines, different changes have taken place after the year 2000. The wind of change has also touched my city, Calamba. The city is often termed as the City of Calamba or Calamba City. Geographically the city is at a striking location and owns an enriched history from the 17th century. Settling began here with the arrival of the Spaniards and colonisation was their key intention. The city has been expanded and developed much comparing the other cities of Laguna in the country and it happened mostly for the hot spring resorts. There are a large number of hot spring resorts available where people from different places of the country and overseas come to pass a happy and healthy time for them.\n\nIn the beginning, there were fewer infrastructures in the city and when the tourists started coming in the resorts, the needs for building modern resorts and a well-established communication system emerged. Accordingly, the local government undertook initiatives to modify the city, especially where the hot spring resorts are located. As a result, the natural and surrounding environment changed greatly. The places which were bush or jungles near the mountain tops turned into beautiful places. The resorts are equipped with the latest facilities of luxury and state of the art decorations, and the visitors adore the resorts for providing them a comfortable experience. Besides, different business and service are also growing centering hot spring in the locality.\n\nAlthough formerly the city was not a tourist spot, it is currently becoming one for the hot springs. With the growing need of the hot spring visitors, the locality has been changing rapidly. When the travellers come to enjoy the hot spring, they need a safer place to stay and enjoy them. Besides, the communication system is also another important factor for them. A well-constructed communication system is also required for the purpose. The natural environment has been degraded to some extent but the resorts are filled with natural beauties. Diversified plants and foliages are found in the resorts. The top of the hill resorts have made smooth roads to reach which has enriched the beauty of the hills as well.\n\nSometimes changes are unwanted and cause damage to the environment largely. But sometimes they are pleasant too when they are up to the mark and cause less damage than expected. The changes of Calamba are notable and they are positive for the city. Since the hot spring resorts are set on the mountain hills, they attract visitors which help contributing to the city’s economy. Earlier, people had to experience numerous troubles but now for the smooth roads, the communication with the mountain tops and the city dwellers has become easier.\n\n{/sliders}\n\n31.

You can make some notes to help you if you wish.]\n\nModel Answer:\n\nWith a pleasant personality, the television anchors make a berth among the audience, globally. In India, I prefer programs anchored by beautiful presenter Ayesha Faridi.\n\nPrincipally she is a news presenter and anchors business news events at CNBC TV18 and had continued with the television station since 2003 to 2010, right before joining at ET Now. She usually anchors several programs for the television channel and those include the flagship morning shows, including Power Breakfast, Your Stocks, Bull’s Eye, Bazaar, India Market Wrap, Midcap Radar, The Market and First Trades, few afternoon shows, Market @ Lunch, Riding The Bull, The F&O Show etc. She presents the news and information over different issues and analyses the issues critically. She is also assigned to analyze sector-based reports, a variety of current business trends, fundamental issues of business organizations, presenting investigative reports on the local business climates, general news on finance, and sometimes she is also responsible to link with the external traders and business corporations to get information for reports and more other tasks.\n\nI am an irregular television viewer and mostly watch news only from different channels. But I frequently watch her shows particularly the morning shows. On the shows, she gravely analyses the business issues and prospects of the day for different business companies and organisation. Her micro and macro level analysis helps to get ideas about the business situations of any specific company. She analyses the facts with proper information and in some cases, she interviews different renowned business people or economists to bring out the hidden facts and analyse them before the audience. She never presents any news or information without any proper reference and keeps the record too for future use.\n\nAs a business journalist, market analysing expert and television anchor, she mostly discusses the business issues in her shows. She talks about different aspects, the past present and the future of any specific business corporation. Sometimes the discussions become lively and help investors to decide over taking decisions including raising the investment or improving the products conditions and more other relevant phases. Since the discussions are based on the business and the current context, the business people get ideas to resolve their troubles. Mostly the renowned corporations and multinational companies are the regular audiences of her events. Not only she presents the news, she also takes expert opinions for the betterment of any specific sector which is also a beneficial factor for her audience.\n\nI like Ayesha Faridi than any other news presenters for her superb personality and news presentation style. When she speaks, she speaks very clearly. Her pronunciation both the Hindi and English words are adorable and appear natural, and free of all local tones. Moreover, she always picks the best among the experts to opine in her show so that the audience could have a real scenario of the situation and the expert suggestions to recover. Airing time is another fact behind preferring her shows. All her shows are aired at the perfect time when people need it best. Most of the shows begin in the morning when people (especially the businessmen) prepare to get out of the home. After watching the early morning analysis on the television show, they could take the necessary decisions for the day.\n\n{/slide"
