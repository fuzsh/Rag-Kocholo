        "text": "Dolly Khanna has made her debut into the fertilizers sector by homing in on a top-quality small-cap stock which enjoys a monopoly position. We need to en masse follow her illustrious footsteps\n\nThe wheel has come full circle. Jim Rogers, who had once infamously trashed India and dumped stocks, has now gracefully expressed repentance at his decision. However, he does not appear to have learnt his lesson and is finding new excuses to avoid investing in Indian stocks. The Gurus have again tried to counsel him to see the big picture\n\nPorinju Veliyath has had the last laugh as his portfolio has generated an awesome return of 42% in FY 2016-17. He has explained how he achieved this inspiring result and has also recommended several potential multibagger stocks for us to buy in FY 2017-18\n\nSanjay Dutt of Quantum Securities has made it clear that he will never touch stocks like D-Mart and Yes Bank with even a barge pole owing to their “beyond expensive” valuations. He has advised investors to buy stocks which are “sitting ducks” and are certain to give multibagger gains in the foreseeable future\n\nBasant Maheshwari has revealed that his PMS fund has earned a magnificent return of 35% on a YOY basis. He has also revealed that he has bought a stock which is growing at 40% and is expected to do “phenomenally well ”"
