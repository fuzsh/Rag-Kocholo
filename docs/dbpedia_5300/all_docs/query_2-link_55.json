        "text": "Women have stormed into Dalal Street, the last male bastion. Led by Dolly Khanna and Rekha Jhunjhunwala, they are raking in multibagger gains. We need to urgently follow their illustrious footsteps or be left stranded\n\nDalal Street, last male bastion, falls as women storm it\n\nFirst of all, I have to compliment myself for my foresight.\n\nAs far back as in 2014, I had observed that women are excelling and ruling the roost in the field of stock picking.\n\nI cited the examples of illustrious women like Dolly Khanna, Renuka Ramnath, Tabassum Inamdar, Neha Majithia, Vineeta Mahnot, Astha Jain and Nandita Agarwal Parker of Karma Capital who have consistently stunned us with winning stock picks.\n\nMy words were prophetic because today, it is the women who call the shots in Dalal Street.\n\nIt is notable that women are not confined to the field of stock picking but are also dominating the world of stock research and business journalism.\n\nSome names that come readily to mind include illustrious TV personalities like Sonia Shenoy, Ayesha Faridi, Tanvir Gill, Surabhi Upadhyay, Nickey, and many others.\n\nDalal Street is not the only place to be taken over by women.\n\nAccording to the Hindu, a male bastion in the railways involving maintenance of wheels and brake system of coaches has also fallen ahead of International Women’s Day.\n\nSimilarly, even the competitive world of photojournalism, which was hitherto dominated by males like Raghu Rai, now boasts of award winning lady photojournalists according to the Indian Express.\n\n(Varinder Bansal with the luminaries of CNBC TV18 being (L-R) Ekta Batra, Reema Tendulkar, Nisha Poddar & Sonia Shenoy)\n\n(Nigel DSouza of Midcap Mania fame with the charming Sumaira Abidi and other luminaries)\n\nEven the Billionaires’ club is not spared\n\nThe Forbes Billionaires’ club used to be the exclusive playground of Alpha males like Mukesh Ambani, Rakesh Jhunjhuwala, Radhakishan Damani etc.\n\nHowever, today charming ladies like Kiran Mazumdar Shaw have muscled their way into the club.\n\nIn fact, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw’s net worth of $3.6 Billion in more than that of several other members of the Billionaires’ club.\n\nAlso, her wealth is self-created and not legacy-gifted, which is quite an achievement in itself.\n\nMega multibaggers in portfolios of Dolly Khanna and Rekha Jhunjhuwala\n\nThe ace team at moneycontrol.com has toiled hard to flush out the multibaggers in the portfolios of Dolly Khanna and Rekha Jhunjhunwala.\n\nThe results are simply stunning.\n\nIn the period from Jan 2017 to date, Dolly has snared ten stocks which have given multibagger gains.\n\nThe list of multibagger stocks in Dolly Khanna’s portfolio is as follows:\n\nCompany Name Percentage Holding Gains from 2017 start to till date Rain Industries Ltd. 2.57 573.63 PPAP Automotive Ltd. 1.05 240.81 Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. 1.02 223.44 Nocil Ltd. 1.96 206.09 IFB Industries Ltd. 1.03 198.13 Butterfly Gandhimathi Appliances Ltd. 1.26 163.04 Thirumalai Chemicals Ltd. 1.63 157.31 Tata Metaliks Ltd. 1.08 140.48 Sterling Tools Ltd. 1.29 111.68 Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd. 1.03 100.38\n\nRain Industries dominates the list with a mind-boggling gain of 573%.\n\nI have already pointed out that Rain Industries is the all-time favourite stock of Mohnish Pabrai, the visionary stock picker.\n\nI have also drawn attention to the latest research reports by Motilal Oswal and IDBI Capital which have assured that more gains are due for harvest from Rain Industries.\n\nWhen Dolly stormed into PPAP Automotive in the distinguished company of Anil Kumar Goel, I rightly described her choice as “flawless”.\n\n“One can confidently say that PPAP Automotive is a well managed company with a healthy future ahead of it. The Company can be expected to enrich the portfolios of Dolly Khanna and Anil Kumar Goel with steady gains year after year,” I added with the air of a visionary.\n\nWell, the results are there for us to see!\n\nThe same can be said about Sterling Tools, which is also a high-quality auto ancillary stock.\n\nNOCIL is a high-quality specialty stock where Dolly is joined by Ashish Kacholia.\n\nThe stock has been recently recommended as a “Holi Hungama” stock by leading experts on the logic that it will deliver more multibagger gains to investors.\n\nButterfly Gandhimathi Appliances is supposed to be the “Next Hawkins + Prestige Cookers” according to knowledgeable observers.\n\nHere also, Dolly has the distinguished company of Ashish Kacholia.\n\nThe duo has dug into deep into the stock.\n\nGNFC is a blue-chip PSU stock which enjoys a monopoly in the manufacture of TDI, a specialty chemical.\n\nThe stock has been described as “fantastic“ by DD Sharma, the veteran stock picker.\n\nAccording to Nigel DSouza of Mid-cap Mania fame, GNFC is an irresistible value buy given its cheap valuations, monopoly product, cash on books, low debt etc.\n\nRekha Rakesh Jhunjhunwala is no slouch when it comes to homing in on multibaggers.\n\nShe boasts of two powerhouses in her portfolio.\n\nThese are Delta Corp and Titan Company.\n\nCompany Name Percentage Holding Gains from 2017 start\n\nto till date Delta Corp Ltd. 3.18 209.13 Titan Company Ltd. 1.59 148.29\n\nNot surprisingly, both stocks are also crown jewels in Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s portfolio.\n\nThe sleuths of ZEE Business have compiled the rest of the stocks in Rekha Jhunjhunwala’s portfolio. According to their calculations, the portfolio is worth Rs. 2,800 crore and has generated a magnificent return of 47% on a YoY basis.\n\nStock Stake Aptech 11.47% NCC 8.11% Mcnally Bharat 4.03% Viceroy Hotel 3.71% Autoline Ind 3.48% CRISIL 3.37% Delta Corp 3.17% Intellect Design 3% Agro Tech Food 2.05% D B Realty 2.05% Titan Co 1.53% TV18 Broadcast 1.38% Bilcare 1.11%\n\nConclusion"
