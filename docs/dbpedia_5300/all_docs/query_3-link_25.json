        "text": "This thread is for the creation and discussion of the flavor changes, including Great People names, pedia entries and the like.\n\nFictionalization IV is meant to have its own internal continuity. While it is based on a variety of sources, a single timeline does exist (contradictions, such as various sources stating the world ended decades ago, can be chalked up to alternate realities and such). As such, all Great People and tech quotes are attributed to fictional characters.\n\nSo, I'd like all pedia entries to fit nicely, if loosely, within each other. Here's the adapted entry for England as an example:\n\nSpoiler :\n\nThe origins of modern Britain lie in what is now Turkey. The islands were originally named after Brutus, one of the Trojan refugees that sailed with Aeneas in the years following the Trojan War. It was Brutus who first brought a human presence to the islands, after first wiping out the native race of giants there. There, the first British society was founded.\n\nIn the classical age Britain lay on the periphery of the civilized world; Julius Caesar's visitations to the island in 55/54 BC were viewed as a daring voyage into the unknown. But in 43 AD the island was invaded by Roman soldiers under the Emperor Claudius, and it was to spend the next four centuries as a Roman province. The Romans built cities, roads, and great bathhouses, the ruins of which can still be seen today. With the collapse of Roman power under Germanic onslaught, tribal migrations into Britain began about the middle of the 5th century. The first arrivals were invited by a British chieftain to defend his kingdom against the Picts and Scots. These first mercenaries were from three tribes - the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes - which were located on the coastlands of northwestern Germany. Eventually, these peoples would themselves topple the existing order, and Britain would spend many centuries divided between various warring kingdoms such as Mercia, East Anglia, and others. Even the celebrated King Arthur could not unite the island, although he did manage to inspire countless fiefdoms that would later become modern England. The first political entity that could rightly be called \"England\" formed out of the efforts of the kingdom of Wessex to unite the island against the invasion of Danes and Vikings in the 9th century. But the English domination was fleeting; the subsequent Norman Conquest (1066) resulted in the subordination of England to a Frankish aristocracy, and the introduction of feudalism to the Isles.\n\nThe Norman invasion reoriented England from the Scandinavian world to the Mediterranean one, and reintroduced many elements of Latin culture that had been lost in the Germanic invasions. The English Normans would eventually give rise to a purely British line of kings, the Plantagenets. Three centuries later, the Wars of the Roses was the final struggle between the Yorkist and Lancastrian descendants of the Plantagenets for control of the throne. When Henry Tudor, earl of Richmond, seized the crown in 1485, leaving the hunchbacked Yorkist Richard III dead upon the field of battle, few Englishmen would have predicted that 118 years of Tudor rule had begun. The freewheeling Tudors also gave rise to England's only non-human monarch. Gloriana I (1558-1603) proved to be an inspiring figure and able ruler. No observer in 1558, any more than in 1485, would have predicted that despite the social discord, political floundering, and international humiliation of the past decades, the kingdom again stood on the threshold of an extraordinary age. Her reign ushered in two centuries of British exploration, colonization, and artistic and intellectual advances, as well as a renewed influx of magical arts, lost since the days of Arthur. When Gloriana, the \"Faerie Queene,\" died childless, Parliament offered the crown to the closest blood kin, James VI of Scotland, who became James I of England (1603-1625) and founded the Stuart dynasty. The Stuarts kings did not possess the best luck; Charles I was defeated by the forces of Parliament in the English Civil War and executed, and a scant four decades later his descendent James II was also overthrown in the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688. But despite all this turbulence, by 1700 England had merged with Scotland to become \"Britain\" and established an identity that would be both Protestant and Parliamentry.\n\nThe British Empire was to be one based on trade and control of the seas. Using the soldiers commonly denoted \"Redcoats\", every major war Britain engaged in during the 18th and 19th centuries increased its colonial power. The Seven Years' War was particularly notable in this respect, and so were the Napoleonic Wars. By 1820 the total population of the British Empire was 200 million, 26%% of the world's total population. However acquired, all these acquisitions added to the crown's and the country's power and reputation. For the privileged and the rich, the Victorian era was pre-eminently one of confidence and arrogance, under the able guidance of Britain's two longtime Prime Ministers, Gladstone and Disraeli. Stretching from Australia and New Zealand through India, much of Africa, and Canada, and even parts of the Moon, the British Empire under Queen Victoria was truly one on which the \"sun never set.\"\n\nBut the \"long summer of peace\" was battered first by a Martian invasion of London, then by the devastating War in the Air, and finally in the bloodbath of Flanders. Although Britain suffered far less physical damage than France and underwent no political revolution, World War I may have affected it more fundamentally than any other European power. The war was a catalyst for social and economic change. The mainstays of the early Industrial Revolution, such as coal mining, textile production, and shipbuilding, upon which British prosperity had been built, were now impoverished or redundant. Britain was slow to develop many of the newer manufacturing industries, such as those involving chemicals, electronics, and automobiles. British foreign policy for much of the postwar period aimed at rehabilitating Germany, while domestic policy focused on institutionalizing socialism to counter public concerns. In general, these movements were opposed by France and resulted in a rupture between Britain and its wartime ally, forcing France into a position of isolation that would have prodigious consequences for Europe with the rise of Hynkel in the 1930s. World War II was a British victory, but left the nation bankrupt. Postwar Britain, in its panic, elected the ruthless and feared Sir Harold Wharton to the position of Prime Minister. Wharton, known by his epithet \"Big Brother\", made sweeping socialist reforms taking the population into one of modern history's most repressive societies. After Wharton's death in 1952, the \"Airstrip One\" period came to a quick end. Weakened by war and repression, Britain was unable to prevent the onset of decolonization in the 1950s and 1960s. Although Britons maintained a high standard of living, the British economy continued to perform poorly throughout the 1960s and 1970s. As a reaction, Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) set out to end socialism in Britain. Her most dramatic acts consisted of a continuing series of statutes to denationalize nearly every industry that IngSoc had brought into public ownership during the previous 40 years. Her successor, Jim Hacker, largely helped to seal these reforms. Promising that \"we shall govern as New IngSoc,\" the Blair government installed in general elections in 1997 accepted some of Thatcher's foreign policies but also carried out the economic reforms it promised in its manifesto, before disaster hit again.\n\nThe Third World War hit Britain hard, and it succumbed once again to a radical party, Norsefire. Like IngSoc before it, culture was carefully dictated, albeit not as bluntly as the Big Brother days. Nationalism and xenophobia nearly wiped out all minorities on the island, until a rogue terrorist succeeded in destroying the government and plunging the state into anarchy. But in this chaotic void, the first signs of a new hope for humanity came, for in the many years that the world was wracked by infertility, it was in Britain that the first new child was born.\n\nAnd here's a list of the altered tech quotes\n\nSpoiler :\n\nMysticism:\"Science is a way of talking about the universe in words that bind it to a common reality.

But the ancestors of modern Russia are the Slavic tribes who settled the lands vacated by the migrating Germanic tribes in two waves and slowly but peacefully assimilated the native Finno-Ugric tribes.\n\nThe 9th century saw the establishment of Kievan Rus', a predecessor state to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Scandinavian Norsemen, called \"Vikings\" in Western Europe and \"Varangians\" in the East, combined piracy and trade in their roamings over much of Northern Europe. In the 10th to 11th centuries this state of Kievan Rus' became the largest and most prosperous in Europe. The reigns of Vladimir the Great (980-1015) and his son Yaroslav I the Wise (1019&#8211;1054) constitute the Golden Age of Kiev, which saw the acceptance of Orthodox Christianity and the creation of the first East Slavic written legal code, the Russkaya Pravda.\n\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, the Kievan Rus' was, like many other parts of Eurasia overrun by the Mongolians, who formed the state of the Golden Horde which ruled over the area for over three centuries. However, the Novgorod Republic managed to retain a certain degree of autonomy and was spared the atrocities that affected the rest of the country. While Novgorod experienced a Golden Age, Kiev's dominance waned because of in-fighting between its rulers and regular raids by the Golden Horde, which conquered the Rus' in 1240.\n\nThe most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was the Grand Duchy of Moscow. It would annex rivals such as Tver and Novgorod, and eventually become the basis of the modern Russian state. Under the rule of Ivan III, called Ivan the Great, the Grand Duchy managed to threw off the control of the Golden Horde in the Battle of Kulikovo (1380). After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Moscow claimed succession to the legacy of the Eastern Roman Empire. In 1547, the Tsardom of Russia was founded with the coronation of Ivan the Terrible. Despite his cruel rule, Ivan managed to strengthen the Tsardom, but only under the rule of Peter the Great the Russian Empire became a real world power. Peter secured Russia's access to the sea by conquering Sweden, Estland and Livland. His reforms brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia as well as a new capital: Saint Petersburg. After the long, brutal reign of the immortal tsar Koschei the Deathless, Catherine the Great continued the efforts to establish Russia as one of the great powers of Europe. During the Napoleonic Wars, Russia managed to overwhelm Napoleon's troops, who clearly where not prepared for the merciless Russian winter. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Russia joined the War in the Air, while being divided within itself, torn apart by conflicts between revolutionaries and reactionaries.\n\nAfter the Freedo-Moronian troops attacked their neighbouring nation of Serbia, Russia joined the First World War in aid of the Entente. The already existing public distrust of the tsar, the rising costs of war and the enormous casualties during the battles against Germany and the Freedo-Moronian Empire ignited the Russian Revolution of 1917. Under the command of Vladimir Lenin, a series of violent uprisings overthrew the Russian monarchy. The second revolution, the October Revolution, led to the creation of the first socialist state which would later be called the USSR. In 1921, Russia initiated a communications blackout with the rest of the world, and built a heavily guarded wall against its European border called the \"Red Curtain\". For plenty of years their was no contact to the outside world apart from rumors about a strange cold and the destruction of entire cities. Following Lenin's death in 1924, Joseph Dshugashwilli consolidated power, becoming a dictator that is comonly refered to as \"the Fearless Leader\". His merciless rule was marked with propaganda, espionage, public distrust and the time of the Great Terror. During the Second World War, the troops of German dictator Adenoid Hynkel invaded Russia, breaking the Russian-German non-aggression pact signed by Hynkel and the Fearless Leader. Althought the German army had considerable success early on, they suffered defeats after reaching the outskirts of Moscow and the Soviet forces managed to press the front towards Europe again and were able to capture Berlin in 1945. Installing socalist governments in the occupied parts of Eastern Europe, becoming the world's second nuclear weapons power and hiding again behind the Red Curtain, the USSR entered into a struggle for global dominance with the United States, which became known as the Cold War.\n\nIn the years to come the contact to Russia was cut of again and the European intelligence agencies who spied on Russian radio stations only heared a single message repeated over and over: \"Brotherhood, Strength, and Fortitude...in the face of the angry night.\" In December 1949, the Red Curtain was suddenly breached by numerous forces of an extraterrestrial species known as the Chimera. These alien beings where actually Russian people who where infected by an unknown extraterrestrial virus. The Chimeran forces overrun continental Europe by February 1950 and proceed to dig underneath the English Channel, invading Britain in late 1950. Only the combined efforts of Russian, European and American forces were able to overwhelm the alien hordes and the British SRPA (Special Research Projects Agency) even found a cure for the virus.\n\nAfter Russia regained its freedom from the alien conquerors, the Cold War continued to increase the tension between the East and the West. The Cold War threatened to escalate more then once, most notably during the Cuba crisis, the Strangelove Incident and the Vietnam war. During the Cold War, Russia achieved many technological improvements like the launch of the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 and a powerful satellite weapon called \"GoldenEye\". During its last years, the economy was afflicted by shortages of goods in grocery stores, huge budget deficits and explosive growth in money supply leading to inflation. In August 1991, an unsuccessful military coup against Gorbachev aimed at preserving the Soviet Union instead led to its collapse. In Russia, Boris Yeltsin came to power and declared the end of socialist rule. The USSR splintered into fifteen independent republics and was officially dissolved in December 1991, creating among other nations the Russian Federation. Boris Yeltsin was elected the President of Russia in June 1991, in the first direct presidential election in Russian history. After some years, the attempted assassination of Golovko, head of the SVR (formerly the KGB) turned out to be an attempt to sow confusion in the Russian government because of China's designs to annex Eastern Siberia, where geologists had recently discovered a large amount of oil and gold. The following Sino-Russian War led to the inclusion of Russia into NATO and the assistance of US forces in the battle against China, which would surrender to the USA and Russia after the raid of the Politburo in Beijing by student demonstrators, which caused a Chinese change of politics.\n\nThe Chernobyl Disaster of 1986 influenced the development of Russia at the End of the 20th century, but the second nuclear reactor accident at the Chernobyl Power Plant in 2006 had an even greater impact. After the explosion, the Russian government created \"The Zone\", a protected area inhabited only by mutated people and creatures. But the lost secrets of Russian government technology, the ghost city Pripyat and the artifacts found near the inexplicable anomalies attracted the attention of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s : \"Scavengers, Trespassers, Adventurers, Loners, Killers, Explorers, Robbers\". The Zone turned into a home of mutants, criminals, fanatics and other lawless groups that lived in a state of constant warfare.\n\nThe financial crisis and foot riots of 2017 led to the strengthening of the militaristic, scientific Ushi Party in Russia. Out of fear of an upcoming revolution, the Russian government banned the Ushi Party and declared its young, dissident leader Grigor Stoyanovich an enemy of the state. This harsh political act led to a violent uprising of sympathizers of the Ushi Party in the following year. This radical group led by Grigor Stoyanovich managed to seize power over the city of Voronezh, a major political power in Western Russia. But the battle took an unusual turn after the arrival of Sergei Molotov and the alleged US agent Molly Ryan, two time travellers who came to the past to stop Grigor, claiming his revolution would turn into a bloody campaign for world domination. Although Stoyanovich's future successor, the sentient cyborg Grigor II, managed to send a whole army of hightech robots in order to support the uprising, Molotov and Ryan where able to get to Grigor and executed him. Thanks to reverse engineering, Russia's technological level increased drastically. With this new power, Russia began to invade the Middle East because of the global shortage of raw materials, thus coming in conflict with the European Union and the Indian Khanate who had similar plans. In 2077, the struggle for Middle Eastern dominance led to the nuclear holocaust of the Third World War.\n\nSources:\n\nSpoiler :\n\n*Russian folklore - Koschei the Deathless\n\n*The War in the Air by H.G.

I mean, there are many WW IIIs in modern fiction (Fallout, Star Trek, Ghost in a Shell, just to name a few)\n\nAnd secondly, you posted the American pedia entry sometime ago. In that text it's said, that the US joined Great Britain to form Oceania, but Oceania isn't mentioned in England's text. It would be nice if you could mention Oceania somewhere or it would look like Big Brother ruled only over Airstrip One.\n\nSorry for the double posting, but I was in the right mood for writing.\n\nHope this fits your expectations as well as your continuity:\n\nSpoiler :\n\nRUSSIA:\n\nIn ancient times, the vast steppes of Southern Russia were home to disunited tribes of nomadic people like the Scythians, Bulgarians, Bosporans and Khazars as well as trading colonies established by Greek explorers in the latter part of the eighth century BC. But the ancestors of modern Russia are the Slavic tribes who settled the lands vacated by the migrating Germanic tribes in two waves and slowly but peacefully assimilated the native Finno-Ugric tribes.\n\nThe 9th century saw the establishment of Kievan Rus', a predecessor state to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Scandinavian Norsemen, called \"Vikings\" in Western Europe and \"Varangians\" in the East, combined piracy and trade in their roamings over much of Northern Europe. In the 10th to 11th centuries this state of Kievan Rus' became the largest and most prosperous in Europe. The reigns of Vladimir the Great (980-1015) and his son Yaroslav I the Wise (10191054) constitute the Golden Age of Kiev, which saw the acceptance of Orthodox Christianity and the creation of the first East Slavic written legal code, the Russkaya Pravda.\n\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, the Kievan Rus' was, like many other parts of Eurasia overrun by the Mongolians, who formed the state of the Golden Horde which ruled over the area for over three centuries. However, the Novgorod Republic managed to retain a certain degree of autonomy and was spared the atrocities that affected the rest of the country. While Novgorod experienced a Golden Age, Kiev's dominance waned because of in-fighting between its rulers and regular raids by the Golden Horde, which conquered the Rus' in 1240.\n\nThe most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was the Grand Duchy of Moscow. It would annex rivals such as Tver and Novgorod, and eventually become the basis of the modern Russian state. Under the rule of Ivan III, called Ivan the Great, the Grand Duchy managed to threw off the control of the Golden Horde in the Battle of Kulikovo (1380). After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Moscow claimed succession to the legacy of the Eastern Roman Empire. In 1547, the Tsardom of Russia was founded with the coronation of Ivan the Terrible. Despite his cruel rule, Ivan managed to strengthen the Tsardom, but only under the rule of Peter the Great the Russian Empire became a real world power. Peter secured Russia's access to the sea by conquering Sweden, Estland and Livland. His reforms brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia as well as a new capital: Saint Petersburg. After the long, brutal reign of the immortal tsar Koschei the Deathless, Catherine the Great continued the efforts to establish Russia as one of the great powers of Europe. During the Napoleonic Wars, Russia managed to overwhelm Napoleon's troops, who clearly where not prepared for the merciless Russian winter. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Russia joined the War in the Air, while being divided within itself, torn apart by conflicts between revolutionaries and reactionaries.\n\nAfter the Freedo-Moronian troops attacked their neighbouring nation of Serbia, Russia joined the First World War in aid of the Entente.

This harsh political act led to a violent uprising of sympathizers of the Ushi Party led by Stoyanovich in the following year. After the successfull revolution, Grigor Stoyanich turned Russia, again, into a dictatorship called Novaya Russia. In the following decades, the foreign disapproval of Novaya Russia induced Stoyanovich to lead several invasions of Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Great Britain, the Middle East and Africa which turned Novaya Russia into the largest and one of the most prosperous and technologically advanced nations in the world. Stoyanich's successor was the sentient cyborg Grigor II, who continued his predecessor's conquest of the world by invading and subjugating China, thus gaining control over China's superior technology and Mars colonisation program. This Golden Age of Russia finally ended with the slow decline of Novaya Russia after the sudden disappearance of Grigor II and his cyberneticially enhanced general Sergei Molotov together with a relevant part of the Russian army during the conquest of Cuba and the attempted invasion of the USA. It is said, that Molotov travelled back in time in order to futilely attempt to stop Grigor's bloody conquest for world dominaton.\n\nSources:\n\nSpoiler :\n\n*Russian history\n\n*Russian folklore - Koschei the Deathless\n\n*The War in the Air by H.G.

You can tie a lot of different apocalyptic ideas into that one event (right now Trek, Children of Men and V for Vendetta are referenced in the English entry; the American one has glances to The Handmaid's Tale and The Road), but I'm mainly going by Trek continuity.\n\nAnd the thing about 1984 is that the novel has a very unreliable narrator. Everything Winston Smith knows about the world is fed to him by IngSoc propoganda. And even that's pretty vague. In reality we can't know how much power IngSoc has, or even if Big Brother is a real person or just a mascot for the party. Look at Kim Jong-Il. He's essentially fabricated a reality where the world fears him and everyone looks to North Korea for their communist might. It's quite possible IngSoc is doing the same. So I've been using that obfuscation as a loophole. I'll expand on it once I write the pedia for Big Brother.\n\nAnd just to warn you, the events of 1984 take place in 1948 in this mod. Alan Moore's The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which most of this mod is based on, does this because according to Moore, Orwell wanted the book to be called 1948, but was convinced to push the date further into the future by his publisher.\n\nBut in America's entry, Oceania is mentioned. I've decided that Oceania isn't so much a country as it is a league of countries pledged to mutual protection, much like NATO.\n\nOk, I've finished China and I can only say: Well, that one got quite long\n\nSpoiler :\n\nCHINA:\n\nThe recorded history of China goes back hundreds of thousends of years, coming from a time when even Hyboria and Atlantis still where primitive tribal territory. At that time, the nomadic tribes of China where controlled by an immortal god king called the Jade Emperor, who was originally the crown prince of the kingdom of Pure Felicity and Majestic Heavenly Lights and Ornaments. Although some sources claim, that the Jade Emperor ruled since the beginning of time itself, this claim seems to be a massive exaggeration. Still, the Jade Emperor's rule lasted for at least a million years. After the Jade Emperor achieved godhood and founded China's pantheon, the Celestial bureaucracy, his reign of peace was over: Out of anger of loosing the fight for the throne of Heaven, the monstrous water god Gong Gong nearly smashed the pillar holding the sky. Gong Gong was calmed down by Nüwa and her brother and companion Fu Xi who also repaired the damaged pillar of Heaven. In order to speed up the procreation of mankind, Nüwa and Fu Xi formed the first modern humen by using clay to create humanoid figures and making them to come alive using the power granted by the Jade Emperor. Soon, Fu Xi came to rule over his descendents, being China's first mortal sovereign as well as the first of the Three August Ones. During Fu Xi's 116-year government (2952 to 2836 BC), China made first contact with the Four Heavenly Kings, immortal rulers of what would later be India, Tibet and Shambhala, and the land turned into the home for plenty of powerful beings like the Eight Immortals, the wise Xi Wangmu, called Queen Mother of the West as well as the Four Symbols: the Azure Dragon of the East, the Vermillion Bird of the South, the White Tiger of the West and the Black Tortoise of the North.\n\nThe Second August One was Emperor Shennong, who was succeeded by Huang Di the Yellow Emperor in the year 2497 BC. For his numerous accomplishments like the invention of the principles of traditional Chinese medicine and for defeating the dissident tribe of Chi You, the Yellow Emperor was granted godhood after his death. The rule of the Three August Ones was followed by the Age of the Five Emperors: Shaohao, Zhuanxu, Ku, Yao and Shun. Each of these monarchs increased the power and influence of the fast growing China even further. During the time of Shun, the Yellow River erupted in a huge flood. A wise man named Yu was put in charge of flood control, and taught the people in building canals and levees. After thirteen years of toil, flooding problems were solved under Yu's command. Because of this great achievment, Shun passed the leadership to Yu, who would later been called Yu the Great, on his death bed. Upon Yu's death, his position as leader was passed not to his deputy, but was inherited by his son Qi. Qi's succession broke the previous convention of meritorious succession, and began what is traditionally regarded as the first dynasty in Chinese history. The dynasty is called \"Xia\" after Yu's centre of power.\n\nAround 1600 BC, Jie, a bloodthirsty despot of the Xia Dynasty, ruled over China. During his brutal rule, the gods cursed China with a harsh climat change and with hordes of rampaging ghouls. Jie was overthrown by the tribal leader Tang of Shang, who established the Shang Dynasty. This blood line would later end nearly the same way as there predecessor: It was overthrown by the Zhou Dynasty in order to stop the brutal tyrant Zhou of Shang, the last one of the Shang Dynasty. After the uprising against Zhou of Shang, many strong, independent states continually waged war with each other in the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nThe first really unified Chinese state since the rule of Fu Xi was founded by Han the Dragon Emperor, king of the Qin state. Han united the warring states of China by force using his great army of men as well as Loong dragons. As his first act as Emperor, he orderd the construction of the Great Wall Of China, burying his former enemies beneath it and cursing them to hold it up for all eternity. The Great Wall was supposed to be an impregnable line of defense against the pastoral nomads from the steppes in the North as well as the Himalayan kingdoms like Tibet and Ling. In order to achieve immortality, the Dragon Emperor imprisoned the witch Zi Yuan from Shambala, who had the power to grant endless life. But instead of blessing Han, Zi Yuan cursed the Dragon Emperor and his warriors, transforming them into the Terracotta Army. The subsequent Han Dynasty ruled China between 206 BCE and 220 CE, and created a lasting Han cultural identity among its populace that would last to the present day. The Han Dynasty expanded the empire's territory considerably with military campaigns reaching Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia and Central Asia, and also helped establish the Silk Road in Central Asia.\n\nAfter Han's collapse, another period of disunion followed, including the highly chivalric period of the Three Kingdoms. Independent Chinese states of this period also opened diplomatic relations with Japan, introducing the Chinese writing system there. In 580 CE, China was reunited under the Sui Dynasty led by the legendary lovers Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, who managed to conquer the other kingdoms using the powerful sword Glory of Ten Powers. Under the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties, Chinese technology and culture reached its zenith: The Song Dynasty was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy. Between the 10th and 11th centuries, the population of China doubled in size. This growth came about through expanded rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The following centuries are also very characteristic for the spread of Buddhism and Taoism in China. The adventures of people like Xuanzang, the monkey king Sun Wukong, Song Jiang, a rebel and bandit similiar to Robin Hood, and Bai SuZhan, a snake demoness who tried to achieve godhood by performing good deeds, left their marks during this Golden Age of China.\n\nAt the beginning of the 13th century, not even Chinese war legends like Hua Mulan were able to stop the invading Monoglians led by Genghis Khan. But the Chinese Empire would only be the first victim of the Mongolian hordes. In 1271, the Mongol leader and the fifth Khagan of the Mongol Empire Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty and the new de-facto capital of Xanadu, with the last remnant of the Song Dynasty falling to the Yuan in 1279 after the completion of the conquest. A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Mongols in 1368 and founded the Ming Dynasty. China's capital was moved from Xanadu to Beijing during the early Ming Dynasty. The Ming fell to the Manchus in 1644, who then established the Qing Dynasty. An estimated 25 million people died during the Manchu conquest of the Ming Dynasty (1616&#8211;1644). But the royal families of the Qing Dynasty, most notably the estranged houses of the Jia Clan, where fighting battles for power among themselves, thus weakening the empire.\n\nThe Qing Dynasty, which lasted until 1912, was the last dynasty in China. In the 19th century, the Qing Dynasty adopted a defensive posture towards European imperialism, even though it engaged in imperialistic expansion into Central Asia itself. At this time China awoke to the significance of the rest of the world, in particular the West. As China opened up to foreign trade and missionary activity, opium produced by British India was forced onto Qing China. Two Opium Wars with Britain weakened the Emperor's control. One result was the Taiping Civil War, which lasted from 1851 to 1862, costing 20 to 200 million lives, thus being one of the bloodiest wars in human history. Other costly rebellions following the Taiping Rebellion and the flow of British opium hastened the empire's fall. The creation of the Confederation of Eastern Asia together with Japa in 1907 and the following War in the Air weakend the empire even further. Doktor Fu Manchu, an insidious scientist and criminal mastermind, used the empire's weakness for his own sinister plans, ones even seizing the power over China for a short time.\n\nThe empire's foreseeable decline took place on 1 January 1912 with the founding of the Republic of China. Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang Party was proclaimed provisional president of the republic but soon he was replaces by Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general. After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented, with an internationally recognized but virtually powerless national government seated in Beijing. Warlords in various regions exercised actual control over their respective territories. Only in the late 1920s, the Kuomintang, under Chiang Kai-shek, was able to reunify the country under its own control. During World War II, China had to defend its territory against Japan. With the surrender of Japan in 1945, China emerged victorious but financially drained. This led to the Chinese Civil War and the foundation of the People's Republic of China ruled over by the Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong.\n\nAfter the Chinese Civil War, mainland China underwent a series of disruptive socioeconomic movements starting in the late 1950s with the Great Leap Forward and continuing in the 1960s with the Cultural Revolution that left much of its education system and economy in shambles. With the death of its first generation Communist Party leaders such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, the PRC began implementing a series of political and economic reforms advocated by Wu Qinghua, the first female leader of China, that eventually formed the foundation for mainland China's rapid economic development starting in the 1990s.\n\nAfter some years, the PRC's regieme attempted the assassination of Golovko, head of the SVR (formerly the KGB) in order to sow confusion in the Russian government because of China's designs to annex Eastern Siberia, where geologists had redently discovered a large amount of oil and gold. The following Sino-Russian War led to the USA assisting the losing Russia in its battles against China. The PRC surrendered to its enemies after the raid of the Politburo in Beijing by student demonstrators. This uprising led to a massive change of Chinese politics, the introduction of democracy and China's convergence to the US. Together with its new American ally, China successfully crushed a radical, anarchic terrorist group with unclear goals called GLA (Global Liberation Army) of Middle Eastern, Maoist and former Soviet origins in the War against Terror. Altough China won the war, it emptied their financial reserves and it suffered from losses like the destruction of the Three Gorges Dam and a devastating attack on Beijing.\n\nIn the following years, China developed to an independent, scientific nation with a good relationship to Japan and diplomatic silence concerning America that has turned into a theocracy called the Republic of Gilead. The members of the Kwan Do familiy, owners of Kwan Do Electronics and Communications and proud descendants of Han the Dragon Emperor, were the de-facto rulers of China as their money and their technology was supposed to allow the desired colonisation of space. These ambitious plans attracted the attention of the Eye of God, a fanatical terrorist group from Gilead, that was of the oppinion, that Earth, as it is God's chosen planet, should be the only planet inhabited by the human race. In spite of several devestating terrorist attacks, the UFAR (United Federation of Asian Republics) and Japan managed to send a colonisation shuttle to Mars. The planet would be divided in the Eastern Hemisphere controlled by the Kwan Do familiy and the Western Himsphere controlled by the Wong family, who bought the planet from the native marsians, called Barsoomians.\n\nIn the year 2066 the tension between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Gilead reached a critial stage. Because of the international shortage of resources, China launched an invasion to conquer Alaska's reserves of raw materials. In the next eleven years, a bloody war of attrition took place along the Pacific coast of Alaska, Canada and Gilead. On the 23. October 2077 (later called Judgment Day), the American leader Robert L. Booth finally launched most of Gilead's nuclear weapons in response to international opposition, aiming not only at China but at Russia too. China answered to this attack with the launch of its own weapons of mass destruction. So did all of the superpowers around the world, leading to World War III. Except for America, China suffered the biggest losses during the Atomic War: The Chinese mainland was totally destroyed and turned into the so-called Radlands of Ji. The only areas of China that where protect with anti-missle defences were the newly founded megacities Sino-City One, Sino-City Two and Hong Kong. Making use of the chaos on Earth, Khan Sun Do, a member of the Kwan Do family, united the colonies on Mars and declared them indepentend from their homeplanet, starting Earth's first interstellar war.\n\nSources\n\nSpoiler :\n\n*Chinese folklore and mythology - a lot (those ancient Chinese writers must have been as hard-working as an ant colony!)\n\n*Buddhist mythology - Four Heavenly Kings\n\n*The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor - Han the Dragon Emperor (replacing Qin Shi Huangdi)\n\n*Epic of King Gesar - Ling\n\n*Butterfly Lovers - Liang Shanbo, Zhu Yingtai\n\n*The Glory of Ten Powers - Glory of Ten Powers\n\n*Journey to the West - Sun Wukong, Xuanzang\n\n*Water Margin - Song Jiang\n\n*The Legend of the White Snake - Bai SuZhen\n\n*Hua Mulan - Hua Mulan\n\n*Xanadu - Xanadu\n\n*Dream of the Red Chamber - Jia Clan\n\n*The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu - Fu Manchu\n\n*The War in the Air - War in the Air\n\n*Red Detachment of Women - Wu Qinghu\n\n*Jack Ryan novels - Sino-Russian War\n\n*Command & Conquer: Generals - GLA, War against Terror\n\n*Empire Earth: AoC's Asian campaign - Kwan Do, colonisation of Mars\n\n*Futurama - Wong family, native marsians\n\n*Works of Edgar R.

Because if not, it would make more sense for Booth to be leader of the Mega-Cities than Gilead.\n\nBooth was the president of the US (so in your continuity either Gilead or a part of America that still is a democracy) and started World War III. After the War, most of the US were turned into a devasteted nuclear wasteland called the Blacklands (if you are familar with it, I'd like to use the setting of Fallout for the Blacklands).\n\nAbout one year after WWIII, Booth's cyborg troops where defeated by the Judges and the armies of the Megacities. Booth got imprisioned in Fort Knox but died soon. Years later, Booth's remains would be resurected and he would turn into the leader of the New Mutant Army. To create another Fallout reference, he will mutate himself and turn into the fanatic Master from Fallout I.\n\nI've only started the Freedo-Moronikan pedia, but here's what I have so far.\n\nSpoiler :\n\nThe Freedo-Moronikan Empire was a patchwork nation made of dozens of small pockets of ethnic groups centered in and around the Balkan peninsula. While its people consider the idea of the nation to stretch back to the reign of the Habsburgs and consider various medieval duchies such as Florin and Guilder to be their ancestors, the actual state of Freedo-Moronika only became an official entity in the mid 19th century.\n\nFormed from the remnants of various fiefdoms and duchies of medieval Europe, the Freedo-Moronikan Pact of 1867 was an attempt to consildate power amongst the weaker nations of Eastern Europe in the face of the rising powers of a united Italy to the south and a newly nationalist Germany to the west. Its primary cosigners, Freedonia and Moronika, while not major powers themselves, believed in the rule of strength in numbers. And the many nations brought into this pact created a diverse country which played upon the strengths of many nations. Among these nations were Ruritania, which served as the seat of government thanks to a comprimise between Freedonia and Moronika. Latveria, home to one of Europe's largest population of Roma, was also included. The decadent Vulgarians, the proud Duchy of Grand Fenwick, tyrannical Meccania, and the athletic Klopstokians were also brought into the fold.\n\nBut this union was never a harmonious one. There was a brief time when the Empire was stable and prosperous, but the first signs of collapse came within the first decade of its founding. In the late 1870's and early 1880's, the monarchy of Ruritania saw a series of attempts on King Rupert V's life, which were only avoided thanks to a royal decoy. The attempted coups were mainly done out of a desire for power, but it nonetheless weakened the idea of a coherent state in the eyes of the Empire's citizens. Whispers of a new nationalism grew in the following decades.\n\nFeelings simmered until 1914, when a young nationalist assassinated the Freedonian aristocrat Alexander Teasdale, starting a domino effect of nations coming to each other's aid and plegding the defeat of either side. Thus WWI was ignited. With the continent drowned in a bloodbath and the Empire wracked by war and strained national unity, the Freedo-Moronikan Empire would not survive the First World War.\n\nEach of the Balkan nations that made up the Empire went its separate ways, giving rise to the term \"Balkanization\". Oddly enough, it was only after the Empire's glory days that its most colorful figures emerged. In the 1930's fascist parties were rising to power across Europe, and the nations of the former empire were no exception.\n\nI'm thinking basing most of the early history of the Empire in Ruritania from The Prisoner of Zenda, since that was the novel that started the whole idea of political dramas set in fictional countries in the first place.\n\nWell, I don't know Prison of Zenda, but it sounds very nice. If you need suggestions for more material, you might want to look into some of this stuff:\n\nThe Dark Frontier, A Rubovian Legend, Genovia, Graustark, Molvonîa, Mendorra from One Life to Live and this Tintin episode\n\nAs for Germany, Wagner is a good bet for its early history, particularly Tannhauser and the Ring Cycle. I think there was an issue of Asterix where he met the Goths, so that could be used. There are plenty of fairy tales based in Germany as well (think the Brothers Grimm). I'd also look at Fritz Lang's Metropolis, The Great Dictator (since Hynkel is a leader), and The Tales of Hoffman. There's also plenty of outlandish stuff on the Nazi era you could use. I was thinking of making a few references to Return to Castle Wolfenstein, for example. Also, there's a pretty recent play called \"Lebensraum\" by Israel Horowitz that I once saw, and enjoyed very much. You could probably Google some information on that.\n\nHope that can get you started.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nI'm from Austria, so trust me I know German fairy tales quite good.\n\nI already have plenty of ideas for early Germanic history, and some good thoughts regarding the Middle Age and modern times, but I'm still looking for something between World War II and World War III.\n\nWell, as I said before, Israel Horowitz's Lebensraum could be an interesting thing to add. It's a play that imagines what would happen if the Chancellor of Germany started a program to invite 6 million Jews to the country as a way of healing the damage that the Holocaust created. Here's a review of the play\n\nBy the way, here's what I have on America\n\nSpoiler :\n\n. .. .. .. .. .The United States is young by Civilization standards, being barely more than 200 years old. The United States did not expand to reach its current borders until the middle of the 19th century, and did not become a true world power until the middle of the 20th century. America was the first European colony to separate successfully from its motherland, and it was among the first nations to be established on the premise that sovereignty rests with its citizens and not with the government.\n\nPrior to the 1770s, the American colonists were loyal subjects of the British Empire, but a combination of taxes and ministerial mismanagement of the situation led to the outbreak of revolution in 1776. Led by a band of intelligent men collectively known as The Founding Fathers, America managed to win the fight for independence against all odds and lay the constitutional foundation for America's future growth. In its first century and a half, the country was mainly preoccupied with its own territorial exploration, internal development, and economic growth. American politics evolved from quasi-aristocratic beginnings to become increasingly democratic during the 1820s and '30s. Westward expansion gave rise to a new breed of rugged individualism, exemplified by the brave gunslingers who brought a rudimentary sense of law to otherwise lawless territories. But despite the nation's rapid acquisition of territory and dramatic population growth, the spectre of slavery continued to divide the country between North and South. The struggle between anti- and pro-slavery advocates eventually erupted in a bloody Civil War that lasted four years and consumed hundreds of thousands of lives. In the end, the Union was preserved and the power of the central federal government greatly strengthened compared to before the conflict.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following the Civil War, the nation entered a period of unprecedented prosperity after the long conflict and reconstruction. In the ensuing two decades industrial production, the number of industrial workers, and the number of factories all more than doubled. European immigration, westward expansion, urban growth, technological advances, and a host of American inventions - including the telephone, typewriter, linotype, phonograph, electric light, cash register, air brake, refrigerator car, and the automobile - contributed to the American explosion, while widespread use of corporate organization offered new opportunities for large-scale financing of business enterprise and attracted new capital. America also spearheaded the first modern attempts at space exploration, when the Baltimore Columbiad was fired in 1867. But despite America's growth as one of the world's leading industrial powers, the nation still remained isolationist in outlook, paying little to no attention to the world outside its borders.\n\nThe Spanish-American War of 1898 marked the emergence of the United States onto the world's stage as a major power, but it was not until World War I that the country truly became invovled in world politics. Following the 1919 Versailles Peace Conference, the nation again turned its back on the rest of the world and enjoyed the prosperous decade known as the \"Roaring Twenties\". Unfortunately, this economic boom was not to last. Wall Street's stock market crashed in 1929 and kicked off the Great Depression of the 1930s. In the midst of constant bank failures and rampant unemployment, Franklin Roosevelt was elected president and set about to fix the country through his recovery plan called the \"New Deal\". The program was a mixed success economically, but helped restore hope and confidence to a people that were in serious need of both. Despite a coup by Charles Lindbergh, later revealed to be a Nazi agent, Roosevelt went on to lead the United States through the crucible of World War II, dying a few months before victory was won.\n\nThe Allied victory at the end of World War II left the United States as one of the world's two \"superpowers\" along with the Soviet Union. In only a few short years the two former allies had become opponents in the Cold War, a tense diplomatic standoff that would last for forty years. America would be the key player in the formation of the short-lived Oceania Pact, which would later evolve into NATO. Domestically, the nation enjoyed considerable prosperity in the 1950s, experienced a turbulent period of cultural and social change in the 1960s, and suffered through economic stagnation in the 1970s, with recovery taking place in the following decades. The Soviet Empire collapsed in 1991, but the nation faced new threats in the form of international terrorism. A devastating attack on the Capitol building left the government decapitated, with the unelected Jack Ryan taking office. It was under Ryan that the United States waged a new war with Iranian radicals bent on becoming a superpower of the Middle East. With the US under martial law, Ryan defeated the rising empire and helped restore balanced to the fractured government. His successor, the erudite Jed Bartlet, enjoyed an era of relative calm until a new covert war with Qumar broke out. In this new War on Terrorism, the US employed highly trained Navy SEALS to combat this new menace. After Bartlet, the charismatic Matthew Santos made history by becoming the nations first Latino president. Santos ushered in a new wave of liberal reform, causing the Religious Right to nominate the preacher Nehemiah Scudder to the presidency.\n\nUnder Scudder, America as it had existed collapsed. In New England, a theocracy called the Republic of Gilead sprang from America's ruins and dictated American culture for several decades. The rise of megacorporations and the founding of Mega-City One sustained American urban infastructure in the densely populated areas of the eastern seaboard. America was beginning to see its seat of power shift westward. During this time, the remnants of the nation faced not only a new World War, leaving a large part of the country ash-covered and abandoned, but also a global plague of infertility. Scudder's own plans for fertility harvesting, while callous and cruel, kept the American population afloat for the better part of the century. It wasn't until Zephram Cochrane, a backwoods engineer from Montana pulled together the greatest American invention, the warp drive, that America was back on its feet. The first test of the drive attracted the attention of Earth's closest galactic neighbors, who greeted humanity openly. While extraterrestrial life had been visiting Earth for millenia, this First Contact is widely regarded as the official date when humanity was accepted into the galactic community. By expanding humanity's horizons, the American people helped unite the world under a new banner that not only brought a new era into humanity's history, but also sealed America's place as a leader in the new world order.\n\nSources\n\nSpoiler :\n\nWesterns - gunslingers\n\nFrom the Earth to the Moon - the Baltimore Columbiad\n\nThe Plot Against America - President Lindbergh\n\n1984 - Oceania\n\nExecutive Orders - Jack Ryan, the attack on the Capitol, and Iranian radicals\n\nThe West Wing - Jed Bartlet, Qumar and Matthew Santos\n\nIf This Goes On... - Nehemiah Scudder\n\nJudge Dredd - mega cities and megacorporations\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale - Gilead and the infertility plague\n\nThe Road - ash-covered middle America\n\nStar Trek: First Contact - Zephram Cochrane, the warp drive and First Contact\n\nAnd remember, a lot of the smaller details can be fleshed out in other pedia entries like leader bios, unit info, etc.\n\nAlso, here's a unit pedia entry for The Big Bad Wolf (a barbarian hero that spawns with an event)\n\nSpoiler :\n\nAngrboda was taken by Loki the Lie-smith, and from their union sprang Fenrir, the lord of wolves. The offspring of the trickster god was well known to the Norse, who prophesied that the wolf would swallow Odin whole at Ragnarok. Less well known was Fenrir's own son, a nameless bastard child conceived by the rape of a goddess of the North Wind. The child, simply called \"The Big Bad\" by many European cultures, had inherited his grandfather's deceitfulness, his father's bloodlust, and even some of his mother's power over the winds. The wolf had a well-known taste for goats and swine, nearly driving extinct a sapient species of pig that wouldn't regain prominence until the 1940's. In a well documented case, the wolf even was able to impersonate a human woman he had devoured in order to lure the woman's grandchild. From France to Greece to Russia, tales warning of the Big Bad Wolf are told to this day, since so many fear that the beast could still be alive.\n\nWell, here it is: Germany. Hope it fits your expectations\n\nSpoiler :\n\nGERMANY\n\nThe history of what it now Germany begins with the Germanic tribes. From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, the tribes began expanding south, east and west in the 1st century BC, coming into contact with the Celtic tribes of Gaul as well as Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes in Eastern Europe. Little is known about early Germanic history, except through their recorded interactions with the Roman Empire, etymological research and archaeological finds, but it is confirmed, that the Germanics are descendants of the ancient Nemedians and Cimmerians. While the Roman Empire expanded its territory quite fast to Africa, Spain and Gaul, the first real Roman military campaign against Germania (a term used by the Romans to define a territory running roughly from the Rhine to the Ural Mountains) began under Emperor Augustus. While Rome's troops were able to conquer huge areas of Germania, modern Germany, as far as the Rhine and the Danube, remained outside the Roman Empire, as in 9 AD three entire Roman legions where defeated by an alliance of the Cheruscans led by Arminius and the Dwarves led by the sorcerer Alberich in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. By AD 100, Germanic tribes settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of the area of modern Germany. While the conquered parts of Germania were integrated into the Roman Empire, the independent tribes maintened their tribal identity.\n\nWith the division of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the slow decline of western Rome, the Germanic tribes regained much of their strength and some of them, like the Nibelungs, gained fame and treasure by crossing the Limes and raiding the Roman border zones. One of the greatest Germanic heroes was Dietrich von Bern who is known for numerous adventures like slaying a dragon together with his fatherly friend Hildebrand and his fights against his uncle, the usurper Ermanaric. Possibly the most powerful realm of the Germanics was the Burgundian Kingdom, descendants of Gunderland, under King Gunther and his brothers Gernot and Giselher: After the defeat of Walter of Aquitaine by Gunther's men at Wasigenstei in the Wasgen Forest, Gunther offered the hand of his sister Kriemhild in marriage to the nearly invincible dragonslayer Siegfried, crown prince of Xanten and conquerer of the Hoard of the Nibelungs, thus creating an alliance between the two kingdoms. But after the marriage of Gunther and Brünhild of Iceland and the Burgundian victory against the invading Saxons, Siegfried was betrayed and murder by Gunther and his loyal follower Hagen of Tronje. However, Siegfried's widow Kriemhild hatched a plot to avenge her husbands death. She met with Etzel the Hun, whose hordes where invading Europe, near Tulln in order to marry him. For the baptism of their son, she invited her brothers, the Burgundians, to a feast at Etzel's castle in Hungary. There she provoked a fight leading to the death of all the Burgundians, Etzel's court and herself. Full of anger because of their kings death, the Huns attacked and destroyed Burgundy and its capital Worms, leading to the Great Migration. This Germanic onslaught would not only change the structure of the Germanic tribes for ever, it would also be a major factor for the collapse of Roman power.\n\nAfter the decline of western Rome under Emperor Lucius Tiberius, a new order was established in Europe. On 25 December 800, Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire, which was divided in 843. Charlemagne was the forerunner of the Holy Roman Empire, largely because of the establishment of imperial coronation by the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church and his policy of \"renovatio Romanorum imperii\" (reviving the Roman Empire) which remained at least in theory as the official position of the Empire until its end in 1806. Prior to the foundation of the Holy Roman Empire, the duke of Saxony Heinrich I. the Fowler declared himself the king of the Germans in 919. Heinrich launched a massive campaign of conquest and studied the black arts becoming a highly skilled necromancer who was able to command entire armies of raised undead. In 936, Heinrich I. was banished to another plane of existence by a wizard hired by his own son Otto I. Otto inherited Heinrich's empire and expanded it even further by diplomatic means, creating the Holy Roman Empire and becoming crowned to the first Holy Roman Emperor in 962. At its peak of power, the Empire stretched from the Danish borders in the north to the northern parts of Italy in the south and from Belgium and Burgundy in the west to Prussia and what would later be Freedo-Moronika in the east, ruling over hundreds of kingdoms, duchies and other tiny nations like Graustark, Mendorra, Vulgaria, Ixania and Gormenghast.\n\nBeginning in the 15th century, the emperors were elected nearly exclusively from the Habsburg dynasty of Osterlich, another very powerful member being the Kingdom of Prussia. During the rule of the Holy Roman Emperors, Germany experienced a Golden Age that was coined by magical soverigns like the Froschkönig, Queen Snow White and the King of the Mummel Lake as well as places like the Lebkuchenhaus, the Schlaraffenland (Germany's Cockaigne) and Venusberg. The publication of Martin Luther's 95 Theses in 1517 initiating the Protestant Reformation, leading to the seperation of the Lutheran Church from the Roman Catholic Church. Religious conflict led to the Thirty Years' War (1618&#8211;1648) between the Lutheran parts of the Holy Roman Empire allied with France and the conservatic catholic Empire of Osterlich. During this devastating period of warfare, a mentally disabled adventurer called Simplicissimus Teutsch developed a good name as the servant of Jacob of Ramsey and as the famous Hunter of Söst. The war divided the empire into numerous independent principalities and in 1806 was overrun as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, leading to its decline. Following the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte, the Congress of Vienna convened in 1814 and founded the Deutscher Bund (German Confederation), a loose league of 39 sovereign states.\n\nIn light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe, which successfully established a republic in France, intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. The monarchs initially yielded to the revolutionaries' liberal demands. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement. Conflict between King William I of Prussia and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862, and the king appointed Otto von Bismarck the new Prime Minister of Germany, who managed to exclude Osterlich, formerly the leading German state, from the affairs of the remaining German states.The state known as Germany was unified as a modern nation-state in 1871 in Versailles. In the period following the unification of Germany, Emperor William I's foreign policy secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances while isolating France by diplomatic means. However, in the following years, Germany became increasingly isolated, apart from its contact to Freedo-Moronika. Trying to restore their power, Germany reached outside of its own country and joined many other powers in Europe in claiming their share of Africa. Shortly after the War in the Air at the beginnung of the 20th century that Germany fought using its modern \"Drachenflieger\" and heroical pilots like the Red Baron and Captain Mors the \"Air Pirate\", some of Germany's greatest scientist like Dr. Caligari, Dr. Mabuse, C.A. Rotwang, Baron Heinrich von Helsingard and Joh Frederson managed to improve Germany's technology in huge steps, for instance creating first robots and extending Berlin to the fully automated \"Berlin Metropolis\".\n\nThe assassination of the Freedonian aristocrat Alexander Teasdale triggered World War I. Germany, as part of the unsuccessful Central Powers, suffered defeat against the Allied Powers in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time. An estimated two million German soldiers died in World War I., leading to the German Revolution in late 1918 and the formation of the Weimar Republic. The Great Depression and Germany's harsh peace conditions of World War I first let the the destruction of Metropolis in the Berlin Revolution of 1927 and later to the strengthening of the National Socialist German Workers Party&#8212;the Nazi Party. Their leader the politically commited, radical-right Tomanian Adenoid Hynkel became Chancellor of Germany in 1933. After a fire destroyed the Reichstag, Hynkel quickly transformed Germany into a totalitarian single-party state and revitalised the German industry, with a focus on military rearmament as well as beginning to murder Germany's Jews during the Holocaust. In the following years, Hynkel expanded Germany's influence by forming an alliance with its fascist neighbor Benzino Napaloni of Italy and annexing Osterlich in 1938. In 1939, Hynkel launched a surprise attack (\"Blitzkrieg\") against Poland, which was followed by declarations of war from Britain and France. This marked the beginning of World War II in Europe. In 1941, Hynkel broke the non-aggression pact signed with the Fearless Leader, invading the Soviet Union quite rapidly. In the same year, Japan and the USA joined the war after the bombing of the American base at Pearl Harbor. The Battle of Stalingrad and the Allied invasion of the Normandy at D-Day marked major turning points in the World War. While the Soviet army pushed the front back to Europe and Allied forces invaded Germany's eastern territories, Hynkel launched various projects like the construction of a fortess in the Alps, the Rhinemann Exchange to construct new weapons, the Übersoldier robot program of Baron Heinrich von Helsingard, the resurection of Heinrich I. and the creation of a nuclear weapon with a plan from Ixania called the Kassen Secret. But Germany's defeat was inevitable. On 8 May 1945, the German armed forces surrendered after the Red Army occupied Berlin. Approximately seven million German soldiers and civilians&#8212;including ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe&#8212;died during World War II.\n\nFollowing World War II, Germany was divided into the western BRD and the eastern DDR. During the cold war, West Germany was allied with the US, the United Kingdom and France, while East Germany was an Eastern bloc state under political and military control by the USSR, famous for being the home of German cold war agents like Ernst Stavro Blofeld, J. W. Müller and Hans Kloss. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961 to stop East Germans from escaping to West Germany, became a symbol of the Cold War. Tensions between East and West Germany were somewhat reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's \"Ostpolitik\", which included the de facto acceptance of Germany's territorial losses in World War II. The East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions in November 1989, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West. Finally, Germany regained full sovereignty and reunited in 1990, creating the \"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" which would soon develop to a major European power. One of the biggest spectres of modern Germany was the self-proclaimed death angel Azrael, who comitted dozens of murders in the years of 1994 to 1999. In 2003, German Chancellor Martin Schörmann invited six million Jews to Germany and promised them citizenship and jobs as an apology for the Holocaust, leading to a massive increase of population.\n\nDuring World War III, Germany allied with most of the other European states in fighting Russia and the Middle East because of the global shortage of raw materials. After the devastating war that led to the the destruction of Berlin and the contamination of large parts of northern and eastern Germany, the Bundesrepublik handed over its sovereignty as well as most of its rights to the newly formed European Union of Nations, becoming a part of the megacity Euro-City and thus being only one of many points on a map of a huge federation covering most of continental Europe.\n\nSources:\n\nSpoiler :\n\n*Conan the Barbarian - Nemedia, Cimmeria, Gunderland\n\n*Nibelungenlied - Nibelungs, Siegfried, Kriemhild, Gunther, Alberich, Etzel, etc.\n\n*Heldenbuch - Walter of Aquitaine, Dietrich von Bern, Hildebrand, Wolfdietrich, Ortnit, Ermanaric\n\n*Return to Castle Wolfenstein - Heinrich I., Übersoldiers\n\n*several novels by George Barr McCutcheon - Graustark\n\n*One Life to Live - Mendorra\n\n*Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. - Vulgaria\n\n*The Dark Frontier - Ixania, Kassen Secret\n\n*Gormenghast series - Gormenghast\n\n*Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator - Adenoid Hynkel, Osterlich\n\n*German faerie tales and folklore - Froschkönig, King of the Mummel Lake, Schlaraffenland, Lebkuchenhaus, Snow White\n\n*Tannhäuser - Venusberg\n\n*Simplicius Simplicissimus - Simplicissimus Teutsch\n\n*The War in the Air - War in the Air\n\n*Der Luftpirat und sein Lenkbares Luftschiff - Captain Mors\n\n*The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari - Dr. Caligari\n\n*several works of Fritz Lang, for instance \"Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler\" - Dr. Mabuse\n\n*Atomic Robo - Baron Heinrich von Helsingard, Helsingard robots\n\n*Metropolis - C.A.
