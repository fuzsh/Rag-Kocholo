        "text": "3. Results\n\nA total of 118 patients with DLBCL were included in the study. Of 118 patients, 49 (42%) were diagnosed with nodal DLBCL, while 69 (59%) patients were diagnosed with extranodal DLBCL. None of the baseline characteristics statistically differed between the nodal and extranodal DLBCL cohorts ( ). The mean age of the patients was early fifties. Male patients outnumbered female patients by a ratio of roughly 2:1 and less than half of the patients presented with comorbidities. The median ECOG score was 1 in both groups. The ratio GCB: ABC was about 2:1 in the nodal lesions, whereas equal proportions in the site of origin were found for extranodal lesions. Histological sections, exemplified in , were retrieved from 26 nodal DLBCL patients and 27 extranodal DLBCL patients. Of the 26 nodal DLBCL patients, 16 (62%) patient biopsies stained positive, of which 32% stained positive for c-MYC and BCL-2 and/or BCL-6 (i.e., double expressor lymphoma). Of the 27 extranodal DLBCL patients, 15 (56%) patient biopsies stained positive, of which 21% comprised double expressor lymphoma. In some instances, CD10, CD20, and MUM1 positivity was observed and most histological sections exhibited high proliferative propensity (Ki-67).\n\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristicsSite of origin (N=118)P-valueNodal (N=49; 41.5%)Extranodal (N=69; 58.5%)Age (mean±SD)53.3±14.852.3±15.10.70#[range][23 – 81][22 – 80]Sex (N, %)49 (100.0%)69 (100.0%)0.70† Male33 (67.3)43 (62.3) Female16 (32.7)26 (37.7)Comorbidity (N, %)49 (100.0%)69 (100.0%)0.55*1 None29 (59.2)36 (52.2) Diabetes mellitus8 (16.3)8 (11.6) Hypertension3 (6.1)12 (17.4) Ischemic heart disease4 (8.2)4 (5.8) Other5 (10.2)9 (13.0)ECOG score (N, %)49 (100.0%)69 (100.0%)0.57*2 01 (2.0)3 (4.3) 128 (57.1)32 (46.4) 214 (28.6)23 (33.3) 34 (8.2)11 (15.9) 42 (4.1)0 (0.0)Pathological origin (N, %)39 (79.6)45 (65.2)0.18† GCB27 (69.2)24 (53.3) ABC12 (30.8)21 (46.7)Antigen expression pattern (N, %)26 (53.1)27 (39.1)0.78† Expressors16 (61.5)15 (55.6) Non-expressors10 (38.5)12 (44.4)Anatomical site (extranodal DLBCL) (N, %)69 (100.0%) Gastric19 (27.5) Mediastinum8 (11.6) Breast3 (4.3) Other (liver, testis, thyroid, bone, soft tissue, CNS, nasopharynx, chest wall)39 (56.5)Surgery (N, %)49 (100.0%)69 (100.0%)0.32† No39 (79.6)60 (87.0) Yes10 (20.4)9 (13.1)DLBCL stage (N, %)49 (100.0%)69 (100.0%)0.58* I3 (6.1)7 (10.1) II10 (20.4)19 (27.5) III13 (26.5)13 (18.8) IV23 (46.9)30 (43.5)IPI score (N, %)49 (100.0%)69 (100.0%)0.28* Low11 (9.3)19 (16.1) Intermediate25 (29.7)37 (31.4) High3 (2.5)13 (11.0)CNS IPI score (N, %)49 (100.0%)69 (100.0%)0.77* Low23 (46.9)28 (40.6) Intermediate16 (32.7)24 (34.8) High10 (20.4)17 (24.6)Primary treatment (N, %)49 (100.0%)69 (100.0%)0.18* R-CHOP30 (61.2)43 (62.3) DA-R-EPOCH2 (4.1)9 (13.0) Other17 (34.7)17 (24.6)\n\nThe stomach (28%) was the most common site of extranodal DLBCL, followed by the mediastinum (12%), breast (4%), and other sites (57%). A small number of patients (13%) in the extranodal group had undergone surgical resection of the lymphoma following biopsy-confirmed diagnosis, whereas 20% of nodal DLBCL patients had undergone surgery. The majority of diagnoses comprised Stage IV lesions (>43% in both nodal and extranodal groups). The IPI and CNS-IPI scores were evenly divided among groups. R-CHOP was the most frequently administered treatment in both groups, while radiation therapy had been administered in 23% of nodal cases and 40% of extranodal patients complementary to (immuno) chemotherapy.\n\nOf the 118 patients, 80 (68%) patients achieved CR as confirmed by PET-CT performed 8 – 12 week after completion of first-line treatment ( ). The CR statistics had improved considerably after the completion of first-line treatment compared to the interim scan results, which had been obtained 3 – 4 cycles after the start of treatment. Thirty-five (71%) patients with CR were in the nodal group and 45 (65%) patients with CR had extranodal malignancy. A partial response was noted in 12% of nodal and 13% of extranodal DLBCL patients. Respectively 16% and 22% of nodal and extranodal DLBCL patients exhibited refractory disease or relapse at the end of first-line treatment. None of the differences in treatment outcomes were statistically significant between the nodal and extranodal groups.\n\nTable 2\n\nCharacteristicsSite of origin (N=118)P-valueNodal (N=49)Extranodal (N=69)Interim scan (N, %)39 (79.6)51 (73.9)0.40† CR22 (56.4)24 (47.1) Incomplete response17 (43.6)27 (52.9)Relapse after interim partial response or CR (N, %)39 (79.6)51 (73.9)0.43† Yes1 (2.6)0 (0.0) No38 (97.4)51 (100.0)End of treatment scan (N, %)49 (100.0)69 (100.0)0.13* CR35 (71.4)45 (65.2) Partial response6 (12.2)9 (13.0) Relapse and refractory response8 (16.3)15 (21.7)Second-line treatment outcome6170.90* CR3 (50.0)9 (52.9) Refractory3 (50.0)8 (47.1)\n\nResidual disease was found in 30 patients who continued in the study trajectory after the first treatment, based on PET-CT scans performed 8 – 12 weeks after completion of the first-line treatment. Of these, seven patients were lost during follow-up. The proportion of responders and refractory patients after second-line treatment was similar among both groups ( ). Representative PET-CT scans of therapy-responsive nodal and extranodal DLBCL patients are presented in Figures - and - , respectively. Of the 23 evaluated patients, seven patients had biopsy-proven residual disease. DHAP +/- rituximab was the most used second-line treatment (33%), followed by ICE and lenalidomide +/- rituximab (23% and 12%, respectively). DHAX, GCD, GEMOX, and CEOP comprised some of the other regimens used. Following second-line treatment, 12 (52%) patients achieved complete response, and 11 (48%) had refractory disease. The responses were equally distributed among groups.\n\nFor the unstratified patient cohort, the 5-year PFS was 0.8% and the 5-year median PFS was 17 m ( ). The PFS in nodal and extranodal DLBCL patients was 0% and 1.4%, respectively. The median PFS in nodal and extranodal DLBCL patients was 15 m and 19 m, respectively (P = 0.1406, Mantel-Cox test; ). The 5-year OS was 16.1% and the 5-year median OS was 19 m ( ). The OS in nodal and extranodal DLBCL patients was 8.2% and 21.7%, respectively. The median OS in nodal and extranodal DLBCL patients was 19 m and 21 m, respectively (P = 0.1656, Mantel-Cox test; ).\n\nMultivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that ABC phenotype and non-expressor subtypes were independent predictors of worse OS in DLBCL patients when the entire cohort was considered, accounting for an adjusted HR (95% CI) of 1.50 (1.09 – 2.44) and 1.25 (1.16 – 2.29), respectively ( ). The cell of origin and expression pattern remained independent predictors of OS when stratified for nodal and extranodal DLBCL, whereby the adjusted HR was greater in extranodal DLBCL patients compared to patients with nodal lesions ( ).\n\nTable 3\n\nCharacteristicsCrude HR (95% CI)P-value*Adjusted HR (95% CI)P-value*Age1.05 (0.99 – 1.11)0.391--Gender Male10.433-- Female1.17 (0.78 – 1.75)Comorbidities Others10.941-- Diabetes mellitus1.24 (0.56 – 2.73) Hypertension1.09 (0.48 – 2.45) IHD1.25 (0.50 – 3.14)Cell of origin ABC10.01810.009 GCB1.50 (1.08 – 2.41)1.50 (1.09 – 2.44)Expression pattern Expressors10.00310.007 Non-expressors1.29 (1.02 – 1.79)1.25 (1.16 – 2.29)Surgery Yes10.956-- No1.01 (0.61 – 1.66)Disease stage I and II10.561-- III1.31 (0.78 – 2.21) IV1.17 (0.76 – 1.80)IPI score High10.255-- Low1.43 (0.75 – 2.73) Intermediate1.60 (0.89 – 2.87)CNS IPI score High10.312-- Low1.44 (0.87 – 2.37) Intermediate1.16 (0.69 – 1.97)\n\nTable 4\n\nCharacteristicsSite of origin (adjusted HR [95% CI])P-value*NodalExtranodalCell of origin ABC110.001 GCB1.55 (1.37 – 3.20)1.65 (1.46 – 3.17)Antigen expression pattern Expressors110.014 Non-expressors1.29 (1.19 – 2.81)1.87 (1.28 – 2.43)\n\n4. Discussion\n\nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma tops the list as the most commonly occurring hematological malignancy in the world [22], with DLBCL comprising 30% of all adult non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in Western countries. In Pakistan, DLBCL accounts for 75% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas and for 60% in neighboring countries [23,24]. DLBCL predominates in males and in patients over 60 y [24,25]. Although gender distribution was comparable to previously published studies [1,4,5], our cohort consisted of significantly younger patients with a median age at diagnosis of 52 – 53 year. This is in agreement with other national studies in Asia (India) [26] and regional data from countries in South Asia and the Middle East [27]. It has been hypothesized that environmental mutagens such as pesticides and herbicides and a higher rate of viral infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV) in these regions contribute to the increasing incidence and younger age at presentation [23,28].\n\nCompared to the 2008 report (1988 – 2005 era) [5], the statistics of the present study (2014 – 2019 era) are rather dismal and insinuate a worsening of consequences of DLBCL. The 5-year PFS and median PFS in the entire cohort were 0.8% and 17 m, respectively. The 5-year OS and median OS in the entire cohort were 16% and 19 m, respectively. In contrast, in the region-matched 2008 study, the 5-year OS was 55% and median survival was 67 m [5]. An important factor that contributes to this difference in OS is the fact that the 2008 study had 0 stage III and 0 stage IV extranodal DLBCL patients included in the cohort, whereas Stages III and IV extranodal DLBCL patients accounted for 62% of all extranodal DLBCL patients (of which 70% comprised Stage IV) and that advanced disease (Stage III/IV nodal and extranodal DLBCL) encompassed 67% of the entire patient cohort in the current study. Furthermore, the current study had included a higher proportion of patients with Stage III nodal disease (27% versus 23%) and Stage IV nodal disease (47% vs. 44%) compared to the 2008 study. Given that the 2008 report found that Stage IV extranodal disease was an independent risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio of 2.3 (1.6 – 3.2); P < 0.001), it is arguable that the strong overweight in advanced disease in the current cohort brought down the PFS and OS statistics.\n\nOne key question that remains to be answered is why so many patients presented with Stages III and IV extranodal disease (or, alternatively, why no patients had presented with advanced extranodal DLBCL during 1988 – 2005 at what was already a high-volume center). In recent years, our institute has received an increasing number of referrals for advanced, symptomatic patients with poorly responding disease, which suggests a referral bias. Until few years ago, Pakistan did not have specialization centers for DLBCL and each hospital therefore treated these patients. Our institute recently became a national referral center, which has contributed to the increase in patients presenting with advanced disease and hence the skewing of originally established proportions during the 1988 – 2005 era. The newly acquired status of our institute, however, did not coincide with an increased annual admission rate in the most recent study period, but rather entailed a reduction compared to the first study period (33 patients/y during 1988 – 2005 [5] vs. 24 patients/year during 2014 – 2019). For context, global figures indicate a 65 – 72% 5-year OS rate [29], with higher figures in cases of limited disease with 5-year PFS ranging from 80 – 85% and roughly 50% for advanced disease [11]. Accordingly, the global statistics pale in comparison to current statistics in Karachi and it is therefore quintessential to elucidate the exact cause(s) of these trends. Broader epidemiological studies should be performed to determine whether the incidence of DLBCL subtypes and the lethality of the DLBCL subtypes have been increasing disproportionally in other centers in the region. If indeed the case, the incidence rates should be related to the potential causes mentioned above [23] as well as other known and alleged disease drivers.\n\nDLBCL is commonly classified by the anatomical origin of the malignant transformation, namely lymph nodes (primary nodal) and non-lymph node tissues (primary extranodal). Primary extranodal DLBCL has a diverse pathological manifestation with various primary sites. Over the past decades, the incidence of extranodal DLBCL has increased more rapidly than the nodal type, likely due to improved diagnostic modalities [5]. The global incidence of primary extranodal disease ranges from 10% to 40%, with a gradual increase in incidence reported in more recent studies [5,30]. At the same time, there is a paucity of literature on the site-stratified DLBCL entities and their clinical characteristics in particularly the Middle East. Our analysis demonstrated a higher percentage of extranodal DLBCL compared to nodal DLBCL, that is, 58% versus 42%, respectively, which is considerably higher than what has been reported in literature [31-34] but equivalent to what was reported in the 2008 study [5]. The 5-year PFS and median PFS in the nodal and extranodal DLBCL cohort were 0% and 1.4%, respectively, and 15 m and 19 m, respectively. The 5-year OS and median OS in the nodal and extranodal DLBCL cohort were 8.2% and 21.7%, respectively, and 19 m and 21 m, respectively. In terms of survival, the 2008 study had reported a 62% 5-year OS for extranodal DLBCL compared to 43% for the nodal DLBCL (P < 0.001), although statistically significant differences were lost when corrected for IPI score (low risk vs. high risk) in multivariable analysis [5]. The stark inter study difference in survival may be attributed to the overwhelming rate of advanced disease in the present study. Corroboratively, a recent retrospective cohort study by Shen et al. [35], which entailed 141 Chinese patients with extranodal DLBCL of which 38% were Stage III/IV (compared to 62% extranodal Stage III/IV lesions in our study), reported survival data that approximated those found in our study. The median OS of patients was 36.5 m for primary GI tract-, 29 m for CNS-, 14 m for adrenal gland-, 25 m for breast-, 20 m for female genital system-, 22 m for thyroid-, and 18.5 m for bone lesions. The PFS was 25.5 m for primary GI tract-, 24 m for CNS-, 10 m for adrenal gland-, 20 m for breast-, 11 m for female genital system-, 22 m for thyroid-, and 12.5 m for bone lesions. Based on multivariable analysis, both studies from our institute as well as studies by others [34,36,37] found that site of origin was not an independent predictor of survival, altogether indicating that there were no site of origin-specific differences in therapeutic efficacy. In contrast, López-Guillermo et al. [34] reported that the complete response rate and 5-year OS were considerably lower in nodal DLBCL and the 5-year risk of relapse was higher in the nodal group. On the other hand, other studies revealed that the therapeutic efficacy in extranodal DLBCL is inferior to nodal DLBCL [17,18].\n\nPrimary sites of extranodal disease include the gastrointestinal tract, mediastinum, CNS, breast, bone, and the liver. The gastrointestinal tract is commonly implicated [24,35], with gastric lymphomas as the most common site of involvement [24,38]. In an analysis of 118 patients with extranodal DLBCL, López-Guillermo et al. [34] demonstrated that the GI tract was the most frequent primary site, followed by soft tissue and the liver. Our results partly echo these data, with the stomach being the most common extranodal site. Thirty patients were found to have significant residual disease activity on PET-CT, of which the majority belonged to the extranodal group. Given the unique characteristics of the extranodal DLBCL owing to its location, residual disease may be more commonly seen on scans than nodal DLBCL [18,39]. Accurate characterization requires a biopsy to differentiate between post-treatment inflammatory and necrotic changes versus true PET-positive disease before deciding on salvage/second-line treatment [40,41]. In our study cohort, a minimal number of patients underwent a biopsy. In low- and middle-income populations, there is often significant hesitancy among patients to undergo repeated testing. This is most likely due to additional cost accrual of already financially strained patients as a result of first-line treatment expenses. Nevertheless, second-line treatment was provided to patients with positive scans who were clinically symptomatic and resistant to consenting to a biopsy even after extensive discussions. All patients who underwent a repeat biopsy were in fact positive for residual disease. Regardless, a biopsy for an accurate assessment should be standard of care even in low- and middle-income populations.\n\nStudies have shown that primary extranodal DLBCLs tend to relapse more frequently, especially in high-risk populations such as testicular or CNS lymphoma or those with more than one site involved [42,43]. Testicular lymphomas tend to have a very high rate of CNS relapse [44], with a pattern of involvement displaying a propensity for parenchymal involvement and late relapses [45] and dismal prognosis [46]. Primary breast lymphomas run a significant risk of contralateral breast involvement along with other extranodal sites and CNS involvement [47]. In our analysis, 23 patients were identified with either relapsed or refractory disease at the end of initial treatment, with no significant difference between the nodal and extranodal cohorts with respect to therapeutic efficacy.\n\nDLBCL is further classified by the cell of origin (i.e., cells with CD10, BCL-6, and/or MUM1 overexpression), which is accordingly sorted into a GCB and ABC subtype [19]. In general, the GCB phenotype is more prevalent and ABC DLBCLs are associated with worse clinical outcomes [48]. In our study, nearly 70% of nodal DLBCL patients were of the GCB subtype, and 53.3% of the extranodal DLBCL patients comprised the GCB subtype. Furthermore, ABC DLBCL was associated with significantly worse outcomes, which aligns with findings by other groups where DLBCL was treated with standard chemoimmunotherapy [10,48-51]. The GCB subtype is not the predominant phenotype in all studies and the ABC subtype is not consistently predictive of worse outcomes; both seem to rely on the geographic origin of the study population. For instance, in a Korean cohort of DLBCL patients (N = 124), Kim et al. [37] found no difference between the GCB and ABC subtype incidence rate when comparing nodal and extranodal DLBCL. Multivariable analysis further revealed that GCB subtype was not an independent predictor of OS. The aforementioned Spanish study (N = 382) [34] found that GCB marker expression varied among nodal and extranodal lesions. CD10 positivity was equal between nodal and extranodal disease, BCL-6 positivity was more pronounced in extranodal DLBCL, while MUM1 positivity was more prevalent in nodal DLBCL. Similarly, a study on Chinese DLBCL patients (N = 207) [36] reported that the GCB phenotype was dependent on disease site (GBC positivity in 56.0% of Waldeyer’s ring lymphomas, 46.5% of gastrointestinal lymphomas, 27.8% of other extranodal sites, and 18.2% of glands compared to 34.5% of primary nodal lymphomas; P = 0.035). However, GBC marker expression (CD10, BCL-6, and/or MUM1) did not differ between nodal and the various extranodal lesions (P ≥ 0.268). The ABC DLBCL hazard ratio (95% CI) in terms of OS was 2.678 (1.194-6.008), which is in lockstep with the majority of other reports, including this study.\n\nThe so-called double-hit and triple-hit lymphomas represent 6 – 14% of patients with DLBCL [52] and are typically associated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor outcome [53,54]. In our study, data for double expressor status were available only for a relatively small fraction of the patients, with no difference in proportionality between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, dual expressor status was identified as poor prognostic factor in the entire cohort and the subgroup analysis on the nodal versus extranodal group. This is in accordance with the available literature [5,55].\n\nThe IPI is an important clinical tool in predicting the outcomes of patients with DLBCL [37,49,56,57]. Studies looking at differences between extranodal DLBCL and nodal DLBCL have shown no difference in IPI between the two disease categories [34]. Our study reverberated the IPI outcomes in nodal and extranodal DLBCL reported by others. Initially, it was suggested that primary sites might serve as important prognosticators that account for differences in survival [30]. However, it has become more evident that the stage of disease at presentation, biological aspects of the disease, as well as other compounding factors are more critical in determining the outcome [5].\n\nAs per international standards, our patients received R-CHOP as primary treatment. Garcia et al. reported a statistically significant benefit of rituximab in nodal but not in extranodal DLBCL that were treated with CHOP [18]. Contrastingly, Hui et al. [58] did not report any difference in outcomes between nodal and extranodal DLBCL when treated with R-CHOP. Our study demonstrated that 56% of patients in the overall population achieved CR, of which 51% had received R-CHOP, which is better than some other reports [57] and equivalent to other clinical studies, where durable remissions have been achieved in up to 60% of patients [59]. There was no difference in therapeutic efficacy between nodal and extranodal DLBCL, which is in line with the findings by Hui et al. [58].\n\nAutologous stem cell transplantation is currently the standard of care for patients with DLBCL who relapsed or progressed after the first-line chemotherapy or immunochemotherapy. Poorer outcomes were reported by Korean colleagues with autologous stem cell transplantation when concurrent nodal and extranodal involvement was indicated [60]. But little to no available data directly compares the efficacy of autologous stem cell transplantation in primary nodal vs. primary extranodal disease. In most studies looking at the efficacy of autologous stem cell transplantation, nodal and extranodal DLBCL cases are clustered. Naturally, it is impossible to draw conclusions on therapeutic efficacy in the location-stratified cohorts based on clustered data. Furthermore, not all relapse patients proceed to autologous stem cell transplantation, and the number of patients is likely too few to have any conclusive results. In our study population, long-term follow-up showed that only two of the patients received autologous stem cell transplantation as second-line treatment. An issue at our institute is mainly the high treatment costs and the relatively difficult logistics of the procedure, which constitute serious limiting factors in low- and middle-income countries in general.\n\nOur study had several limitations owing to its retrospective nature, including some datasets being incomplete and the possibility that medical records may contain inaccurate information. Moreover, our small sample size might not be representative of the entire Pakistani population and suffer from selection bias. These limitations notwithstanding, our data provides valuable information on clinical behavior and outcomes of nodal and extranodal DLBCL treated in the rituximab era in Pakistan, which is classified as a lower middle-income country by the World Bank. In addition, the study also sheds light on the areas of improvement, such as biopsy confirmation of PET-positive disease, access to treatment options such as autologous stem cell transplantation, and more vigilant follow-up of the relapsed patients to improve outcomes."
