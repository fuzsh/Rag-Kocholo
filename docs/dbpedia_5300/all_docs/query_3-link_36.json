        "text": "From HDK to J&K\n\nWhile H D Kumaraswamy of Janata Dal (S) is sweating it out in the sizzling heat of Ramanagara constituency campaigning for the upcoming assembly elections, the actor who goes by the name Radhika Kumaraswamy is scorching the scene in the Tulip Gardens in Srinagar. The starlet is making her comeback with the film, Sweety Nanna Jodi, and we spotted her with co-star Aditya Singh amidst bulbous plants on Wednesday in a song sequence in the Valley. The weather played spoilsport on Day 1, but the film crew has not let it affect their seven-day schedule in the paradise of India. Incidentally, this is the first film from across India that is being shot this season in Kashmir. Obviously, we have come a long way from the days of running around trees, haven’t we?\n\n‘Being myself’ is a trend\n\nShe’s become a familiar face at many a jewellery event. Ragini Dwivedi was spotted at a jewellery show launch on Wednesday at the Lalit Ashok. But is it a right precedence to set for her upcoming film Ragini IPS, where the actor plays a tough cop? When we asked her if it was that ‘season’ of endorsements, and if her kitty has no films, Dwivedi said she has two Malayalam films and two Kannada films but endorsing is something she thoroughly enjoys. “I endorse brands I believe in. In due process if it becomes a trend, then great. It should be effortless, and if what I do becomes a trend, then it’s because I am being myself.” Looks like the weight of her IPS role is reflecting in the Sandalwood lass’s attitude. But we prefer to wait and watch if the endorsement queue lines up after the film’s release which is due after the elections.\n\nTurn pink for charity\n\nWhen life takes a U-turn that’s when life is given a second chance. Breast cancer survivors Keerti Tiwari, IAS, and entrepreneur Roopa Venkatesh will be showing the world what it means to face life a second time. Their play Bend in the Road, an initiative by cancer patients, of cancer patients and for cancer patients will be staged in first week of May.\n\nTheir aim is not to make the audience cringe with their stories. Instead the gutsy women — all of them breast cancer survivors — want to raise enough funds to help needy patients at the HCG Cancer Centre in an entertaining way. Good work needs a ‘good show’... doesn’t it?\n\nThe travel logs\n\nOne Saha is busy earning bread and butter for the family, while the rest of the Sahas are holidaying. Wife Shruti Saha is painting Singapore red, with kids in tow. Shruti took off three weeks ago for a holiday with their children, Anindita (7 years old) and Anay (5 yrs) to visit her brother in Singapore. Chef told our diarist that he has no time for holidays. But he will be joining his babies and biwi on May 8 for six days, “to bring his family back to make sure they come back’’. Whenever he holidays, he combines it with work. After his business trip to Abu Dhabi early this year, he and Shruti went to Istanbul for a six-day break because Turkey was a place on his bucket list. If combining with work means whetting his culinary appetite, Istanbul is the right choice.\n\nLove match\n\nMarriage bells are ringing for Dilip and Manali Vengsarkar’s son Nakul — your diarist has learnt that the 31-year-old architect and interior designer will be tying the knot with TV anchor Ayesha Faridi on April 27. The cricket legend’s only son had earlier been engaged to marry Swapnali, daughter of Pune-based real estate baron Avinash Bhosle, but the alliance was called off in circumstances that remain shrouded in mystery to this day. Swapnali was the first to move on — in December last year she married Vishwajeet Kadam, son of senior Congressman and Maharashtra Forest minister Patangrao Kadam.\n\nWhile we don’t know if it’s the earlier experience that has made them more circumspect, the Vengsarkars are rather tight-lipped about their bahu-to-be. However, we gather that Nakul secretly started dating Ayesha around two years ago when she was working in Mumbai and the relationship went from strength to strength even after she relocated to Delhi to take up a fresh assignment.\n\nThe engagement, which took place some months ago with the blessings of their families, was a low-key affair. Though the marriage will be solemnised in Delhi, the Vengsarkars are gearing up to host a grand reception in Mumbai. Your diarist extends heartiest congratulations to the couple and wishes them a cracker of an innings ahead."
