        "text": "Introduction\n\nDespite continuous improvements in air quality in large parts of the world over the past decades, poor air quality remains a challenge in many areas, particularly in emerging and developing countries. The WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has recently published a press release stating that outdoor air pollution is a major cause for cancer on a global scale (Loomis et al., 2014). Air pollution can affect the respiratory, cardiovascular, cardio-pulmonary, and reproductive system, indicating that health impacts due to exposure to air pollution are of widespread concern and by no means an issue of the past (Ghorani-Azam et al., 2016). The evidence for these health effects is robust, even though there are still knowledge gaps regarding the exact mechanisms by which air pollutants affect human health and which pollutants should be tackled with priority (Dias & Tchepel, 2018).\n\nHuman–environment interactions are inherently complex, and as such, it is necessary to integrate contextual factors such as environmental, socioeconomic, and behavioral into a single exposure assessment that covers the principal components for estimating exposure to an agent. Investigating variations of individual exposure to pollutants of concern by age, gender, socioeconomic status, neighborhood characteristics, activity level, or ethnicity for instance requires new methods and tools.\n\nOur modern society is moving away from a traditionally low mobility society living in an area with stable living conditions for large parts of an individual’s life to a much more mobile lifestyle (Rainham et al., 2010). In fact, mobility now plays a crucial role in daily life for many people, like traveling for leisure or commuting for work. We are now constantly moving in time and space, passing through an air pollution landscape that is both spatially and temporally variable. This cumulative factor is highly variable and determines to a large part the individual exposure to air pollution and highlights the need for accurate and dynamic monitoring to take account of this. At the same time, the amount of physical activity and manual labor as compared to being sedentary in a car or an office have decreased, resulting in people spending a lot of time in indoor and transport environments which makes these environments important for the total exposure assessment process.\n\nPersonal monitoring offers the opportunity to collect datasets of specific air pollutants at a much higher spatiotemporal resolution within a certain area than traditional fixed-site monitoring approaches which usually provide more pollutants but only for one point. Personal monitoring provides a much more detailed picture of indoor air quality, which is important since people spend a large part of their time in indoor environments, and this compares to the exposure outdoors, which has been the primary focus of air pollution exposure research to date. These monitoring methods are also well suited to be integrated into a citizen science approach, where individuals are not only observers but at the same time the study subjects. Of course, individual privacy must be respected first and foremost, and data protection requirements need to be considered (Steinle et al., 2015).\n\nA variety of methodologies and study designs have been applied by the research community in recent years, and the feasibility of personal exposure assessment methods has been widely demonstrated (Cole-Hunter et al., 2012; Delgado-Saborit, 2012). The research focus has been on certain exposure situations in specific environments. Such approaches, however, leave the assessment of exposure incomplete as not all exposure situations that a person experiences in their daily life are included in the assessment. Conclusions about the total exposure, as a component of and a step towards a quantification of the exposome (a measure of effects of exposure over the full lifetime on human health) on an individual level, are therefore not possible. It is important to consider not only the heterogeneity of individual exposure in a certain environment but also the diversity of environments in a person’s life as the variety of the environments visited leads to a heterogeneity of exposure components. Here we can address the idea of the effect of the diversity of seasons on air quality since seasonal conditions have a significant effect on air quality. It has been observed that the instantaneous weather changes affected the measured parameter values significantly. Hence, areas that enable air circulation in the cities make important contributions to the air quality of the city. Especially parks play a significant role on the air quality by creating an air corridor inside the city. The air quality in the city center does not significantly change locally. The river that runs along with the main road at both sides of the river acts as natural corridor that enables air circulation. It can be stated that this corridor prevents the accumulation of polluted air at certain points in the city center (Cetin & Sevik, 2016). In addition, the particulate matter dimensions are affected at statistically 99.9% confidence level by season, and the place factor affects all the parameters except the amount of particulate matter of size 2.5 and 5.0. The location season time factor was found to be effective at 99.9% confidence level over all parameters (Cetin, 2018).\n\nIn Lebanon, many studies have focused separately on the outdoor and indoor air quality (Abdallah et al., 2020; Afif et al., 2008; Baz et al., 2010; Farah et al., 2018; Melki, 2017; Nakhlé et al., 2015a, b; Nasser et al., 2015; Salameh et al., 2016; Saliba et al., 2007; Waked et al., 2012a, b, 2013, 2015). Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, which is located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean basin, experiences high air pollution episodes. Annual average concentrations of coarse and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as well as nitrogen oxides (NOx) often exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (Waked et al., 2013). The annual average concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 exceeded the World Health Organization’s standards by 150% and 200%, respectively. While in Beirut, PM2.5 accounts for about 61% of PM10. Such a large fraction of fine particles could have considerable effect on health (Farah et al., 2018). Total respiratory admissions were significantly associated with the levels of PM10 (1.012) per 10 μg/m3 rise in daily mean pollutant concentration for PM10 and 1.016 for PM2.5 on the same day (Nakhlé et al., 2015a, b); also, the DNA repair mechanisms were repressed up to 48 h of exposure to PM especially to the industrial influenced PM2.5–0.3 and reactivated after 72 h of exposure (Melki, 2017). Thus, it is necessary to quantify the impact of fine particles and the important role dust events play within this area (Farah et al., 2018).\n\nA similar work which has been done by Susanne Steinle (Steinle et al., 2015) described the development, validation, and results of such exposure method applied in a study conducted in Scotland. Where a low-cost particle counter based on light-scattering technology—the Dylos 1700 was used. Its performance was validated in comparison with equivalent instruments (TEOM-FDMS) at two national monitoring network sites. This validation also provided two functions to convert measured PNCs into calculated particle mass concentrations for direct comparison of concentrations with equivalent monitoring instruments and air quality limit values. Steinle’s study also used contextual and time-based activity data to define six microenvironments (MEs) to assess everyday exposure of individuals to short-term PM2.5 concentrations. Seventeen volunteers collected 35 profiles where the Dylos was combined with a GPS receiver to track movement and exposure of individuals across the MEs.\n\nThe methodology that was used in our study is very similar to the adopted methodology during Steinle’s study, but the calibration process was done using a SidePak™ Personal Aerosol Monitor AM520, and only one transition equation was provided. Only 8 volunteers collected 150 profiles which may have a different overall duration and structure with respect to times spent in different MEs and activities undertaken. Additional tools are used in our study like the satellite observations of PM2.5. The profiles and the overall durations are much longer than the spent time during Steinle’s study, which lead to a more significant and representable results.\n\nThere is a lack of research concerning the study of the individual exposure to suspended particles in different microenvironments (MEs) simultaneously, which is the objective of this study. For the first time, a low cost and portable monitoring tool is adopted to evaluate how PM2.5 fluctuates in different areas as well as MEs according to annual and seasonal scales. We plan in this work to study the variability of PM2.5 particle content in two types of areas in Lebanon (rural and urban) in order to evaluate how air pollution, represented by PM2.5, deviates depending on natural factors such climate, geography, or anthropological behaviors while they move from ME to another one.\n\nOur project dissects an important facet of this critical period facing Lebanon and the world at large, a period of intensified quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is undeniable that during this period of lockdowns and mandatory quarantines, many fields of work are postponed or very limited. Major difficulties and challenges are related to the lack of volunteers who should carry the monitoring unit over the whole sampling period during their daily activities in the different microenvironments, and this obstacle is due to the coronavirus prevention measures that were imposed by the Lebanese state. Furthermore, the technology used to collect the Time Activities Diary (TAD) as a paper form can be disruptive to volunteers. This limits the accuracy in determining the exact amount of PM2.5 sources such as the number of cigarettes or hookahs, in addition to other details such as the distance between the PM2.5 source and the monitoring unit. The problem of outdoor data collection near residential homes can be added , which may affect the accuracy of the data as some pollutants can infiltrate from the indoor area to the outdoor area such as balconies or windows. There is no fixed station near Beirut that can be used as a reference for our outdoor records. Moreover, the monitoring unit is not designed as waterproof, and this technical limitation made complications during the rainy weather, and the no availability of an electricity supply in the car which can cause a gap in data if the machine has not been fully charged. Finally, the lack of an accurate classification of rural and urban roads, where many factors can determine the road category, adds to the list of obstacles in our work (Angelevska et al., 2021).\n\nResults\n\nFluctuation of PM2.5 between rural and urban zones (yearly scale)\n\nIn this study, we evaluated citizen’s exposure level to PM2.5 by incorporation of PM2.5 data obtained at 14 phases and a database of the personal daily activity patterns. As mentioned in Fig. , PM2.5 shows higher concentration (26.6 ±1.4 μg/m3) by a percentage of 22% in different rural MEs than its concentration (21.8 ±1.2μg/m3) in a wild variety of urban MEs.\n\nThese results reveal the potential sources of PM2.5 that characterize the rural regions—many anthropogenic activities such as traditional heating modes, usage of pesticides, and dispersion of pollens are considered rural characteristics. These activities are much more common in rural regions and lead to a significant increase of PM2.5 above the level typically found in urban zones which more commonly employ modern heating technologies and have limited agricultural activities and use less PM2.5 emitting heating sources. Both zones reveal that PM2.5 level is above the WHO Air quality guideline value for the PM2.5 annual mean (10 μg/m3).\n\nVariation of PM2.5 between indoor, outdoor, and transport microenvironments (yearly scale)\n\nAs shown in Fig. , it is obvious that the level of PM2.5 in the indoor MEs and the transport sector that have approximately the same level of PM2.5 (25.2 ±1.2μg/m3; 24.9±3.8μg/m3, respectively) is higher by 37% than its level in the outdoor MEs (18.3±0.5μg/m3). These results reflect the fact that the outdoor MEs are in indirect contact with most of the air pollution sources such soot from fuel-burning generators or from electricity plants and smokes from transport sectors or even from indoor MEs, while indoor and transport MEs are in direct contact with sources of fine particulate matters such emissions from heating, cooking, smoking, and from worn tires and brakes. When SME is taken into consideration, we can notice that the transport sector is characterized by a high spreading means which reveals the wild variety of the air pollution sources in this sector, followed by indoor MEs and then by outdoor MEs which have limited sources of air pollution. All these data do not negate that the levels of PM2.5 in these three sectors exceed the WHO Air quality guideline value for the PM2.5 annual mean (10μg/m3).\n\nExamination of the PM2.5 levels over the four typical seasons in Lebanon\n\nThe four Lebanese seasons are mainly categorized by three climatic periods (hot, moderate, and cold periods), and the examination of the different fine particulate matter level between these seasons reflects some kind of negative correlation between the temporal profiles and the suspended particulates in the rural and urban zones (Fig. ). The total absence of these heating modes in the hot period or summer shows the lowest [PM2.5] value (11.3 ±0.2μg/m3); on the other hand, the level of the suspended fine particulate matters records higher value (30.6 ±1.8μg/m3) during winter, by a percentage of 171% in rural areas. However, the actual causes of these inversed pathways are related to the anthropogenic activities and especially when talking about heating mode that are mainly used during the cold period or winter and then the generated emissions from the combustion process of different traditional tools, like solid, liquid, and gas fuel. The PM2.5 is at medium level (13.1 ±0.1μg/m3; 13.5 ±0.4μg/m3) for the autumn and spring which is respectively higher than the concentration of PM2.5 in summer by 16% and 19%, which mean that the moderate period, which includes the two seasons (autumn and winter), are characterized by the partial usage of the heating tools, especially at some nights when the weather turns cold in the rural zones in the mountains.\n\nThe contrast between the rural and urban areas is highlighted during autumn and winter, while summer and spring revealed approximately the same profiles of the PM2.5 level between the two zones which are 11.9 ±0.2μg/m3 and 12.1 ±0.2μg/m3, respectively. Returning to the difference between the two regions, the main cause of the relatively high level of PM2.5 (21.6 ±0.2μg/m3) in autumn is the lack of variability concerning the indoor MEs, since most of these places included smoking activities which raises the level of pollutants. Concerning the 34% increase of PM2.5 levels when shifting from urban areas (22.8 ±1.4μg/m3) to rural areas (30.6 ±1.8μg/m3) during the winter season, it is due to the usage of modern heating tools (electrical heaters and heaters that work on natural gas) in urban areas instead of traditional ones such as the diesel or wood-burning heaters in rural areas.\n\nVariation of PM2.5 between indoor, outdoor, and transport microenvironments (seasonally scale)\n\nRural profiles\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. , the PM sampling in the transport sector has occurred only during spring and winter, and the level of PM2.5 in the transport sector during winter (22.1 ±2.6μg/m3) is higher by 110% than its value during the spring (10.5 ±0.5μg/m3). We notice that the high SEM during winter is due to smoking of cigarettes inside the car in some cases and the absence of this activity in other cases. As we know, the windows of cars are opened in the most of time during spring and especially in rural zones that can be considered natural ventilation for the vehicle, while these windows are closed in winter which make the used vehicle like a closed indoor ME.\n\nConcerning the outdoor and indoor MEs, the lowest level of PM2.5 is in summer, while it records (11.0 ±0.1μg/m3) in the outdoor ME and (11.7 ±0.2μg/m3) in the indoor ME because there is absence of heating mode as mentioned previously. The indoor and outdoor MEs revealed similar levels of PM2.5 during autumn (12.6 ±0.1μg/m3; 13.6 ±0.1μg/m3, respectively) in addition to the indoor ME during spring (13.3 ±0.5μg/m3), but the exception is in the case of the outdoor ME in spring where the concentration of PM2.5 (15.8 ±0.3μg/m3) is higher by 19% compared to the indoor ME due to the drastic increase of ammonia (NH3) concentrations in spring owing to agricultural activities. It is released from the fertilizer and manure that is spread on fields for farming, which then reacts with other existing compounds in the atmosphere to create secondary particulate matter (PM2.5) (Lovarelli et al., 2020).\n\nUrban profiles\n\nThe fluctuation of PM between spring and winter when the people use the transport sector shows homology between rural and urban zones, whereas the level of PM2.5 in winter (29.2 ±5.1μg/m3) is higher than its level in spring (10.3 ±0.4μg/m3). Moreover, there is a 183% increase of fine particulate matter in this sector when shifting from spring to winter. This dramatic increase results from more frequent traffic jams that occur in urban areas during the winter months and especially in the case of raining weather when most people tend to use vehicles for transportation instead of commuting by foot. On the other hand, we should take note that the high SEM during winter is due to smoking of cigarettes (high rate of smoking) inside the car in some cases and the absence of this activity in other cases.\n\nConcerning the examination of air quality during summer, it shows also a homology of the PM trend between rural and urban zones as the level of PM2.5 concentration is higher in indoor MEs (13.1 ±0.4μg/m3) than its concentration in outdoor MEs (9.6 ±0μg/m3). Furthermore, the shifting from rural to urban areas shows firstly a raising of pollution by 12% in indoor MEs, where people usually tend to close the windows in different indoor places, and this is compensated by the using of air conditioner. Simultaneously, the outdoor MEs show a slight increase of PM2.5 by a percentage of 15% when shifting from urban to rural areas due to higher solar radiation and consequently enhancement of photooxidation in rural areas and especially those located in southern territories where the solar radiation is highest.\n\nThe spring profiles in urban areas emulate the profiles in rural ones, where the level of PM2.5 in the outdoor MEs (15.2 ±0.1μg/m3) which is influenced by many climate factors such Al-Khamasin winds predominates its level in the indoor MEs by 46% (10.4 ±0.2μg/m3). During autumn, the boost by a percentage of (86%) in the indoor MEs is due to smoking activities in all the urban MEs (23.4 ±0.3μg/m3), whereas the majority of indoor MEs in the rural zones do not include such activities (12.6 ±0.1μg/m3). On the other hand, the outdoor MEs revealed approximately the same level of air pollution between rural and urban areas (13.6 ±0.1μg/m3; 12.9 ±0μg/m3), respectively.\n\nFinally, the urban air quality when shifting between the outdoor and indoor MEs acts in the same way of the rural profile during cold period or winter, while the level of PM2.5 is higher by 33% in indoor places (24.4 ± 1.2 µg/m3) than its level in the ambient air (18.4 ± 0.5 µg/m3) . As mentioned before, the usage of modern heating tools in urban areas instead of the usage of traditional tools that are used usually in rural areas helps in attenuating the level of air pollution during the cold period. Again, the common characteristic of all these urban MEs listed above is the exceedance of the PM2.5 level above the WHO Air quality guideline value for the PM2.5 annual mean (10 μg/m3) except the case of the ambient (outdoor) air during summer which is below the standard value.\n\nDaily assessment of the exposure to PM2.5 where people moved between different sub-microenvironments\n\nThe first profile P1-01 (Fig. ) is classified as a mobile one, while the volunteer is located in home where smoking activity occurs and especially at evening from 23:30 to 3:00, whereas the decay process of smoke takes about 4 h until 7:00 due to the bad ventilation (closed windows during winter), while the mean of the [PM2.5] is equal to 36.3 μg/m3. On the other hand, the workplace reveals a moderate level of PM2.5 (26.5 μg/m3) that is due to the presence of air freshener dispenser.\n\nThe increasing of the [PM2.5] between the outdoor of workplace (12.5 μg/m3) and the outdoor of home (19.9 μg/m3) by 59% is due to the contextual factors around the two locations, where the second one is located in crowded residential area with many electrical generators, while the first one is located on a crossroads with low traffic of vehicles at the time of sampling. The lowest level of PM2.5 is recorded during the transport period (11.7 μg/m3), since the vehicle is well ventilated due to the opened windows; moreover, the low traffic of vehicles at the same time helps to mitigate the level of air pollution.\n\nA quick scan of the profile P1-02 (Fig. ) revealed a significant level of PM2.5 in outdoor and indoor ME where different activities occur such as barbecue (96.3 μg/m3), smoking shisha, and use of a wood-burning heater (222.1 μg/m3). Furthermore, the form of peaks differs between the two MEs, as they appear in discontinuous mode in the outdoor conditions, while they switch to continuous mode inside home, and this phenomena is related to the fast decay of PM2.5 that occurred in open places, while this process acts slowly in close places due to the lack of ventilation, especially in winter. Another conclusion is related to the decay rate of PM2.5 presented in the rural home, where a moderate level of such pollutant is shown at morning (29.9 μg/m3) although there is no source of air pollution.\n\nThe profile P1-03 (Fig. ) points to the act of smoking cigarettes inside vehicles during transportation, where the concentration of PM2.5 attends to extreme values (between 200 and 325 μg/m3). The moderate level of PM2.5 in outdoor ME is due to the infiltration of the smoke after smoking shisha in the next room, in addition to the smoke from the chimney of the room’s fireplace. Like the case of the recent profile (P1-02), the level of PM2.5 attends a moderate value (45.7 μg/m3) in indoor places, but the difference here is the number of shisha smokers which is less than the recent case, the mode of heating (wood-based fireplace instead of the wood-based heater), and finally the good ventilation conditions such the open windows in this case, which means that all the mentioned factors contribute to reducing the level of fine particulate matter.\n\nWhat distinguishes the profile P2-01 (Fig. ) is the presence of public places such smoking area (158.2 μg/m3) and restaurant (56.1 μg/m3); these places are well ventilated via the mechanical mode which plays an important role in mitigating the effect of various pollutant sources.\n\nAs shown, the highest level of PM2.5 is detected in the smoking area in Dora (urban area) where many smokers of shisha were present, the second highest level of PM2.5 is recorded in aunt’s home in Ebrine, a rural region, was equal to (63.8 μg/m3) where habitants were smoking cigarettes, and the third highest level is shown in a restaurant located in Amioun where smoke from cooking fills the space. Approximately 90% of the outdoor particles were removed in public buildings equipped with fan-coil unit with air cleaning plus fresh air system (Deng et al., 2017).\n\nWhen going to the daily assessment of the personal exposure to PM2.5 while the monitoring unit is switched between different MEs, it is obvious that many factors play a determinant role in the quality of the air like some polluting anthropogenic activities such smoking beside the ventilation conditions either in the indoor areas or during the transportation via the car. For example, the illustrated daily profiles in this article show that the daily average of PM2.5 is equal to 46.1 µg⁄m3, while the detected maximum value is equal to 322 µg⁄m3. These results revealed that the indoor MEs play an important role in the raising of the daily PM2.5, since recent study has found that the daily average concentration of the atmospheric PM2.5 is 30.3 ± 9.4 µg⁄m3, with corresponding maximum value of 208.6 µg⁄m3 (Farah et al., 2018). The qualitative and the quantitative assessment is another determinant factor since the emitted particles by the air freshener is lower than the suspended ones after smoking cigarettes in the profile (P1-01). Also, the low number of smoked shishas in the profile (P1-03) revealed the lowest level of suspended particles when comparing to the profile (P1-02), when more shisha are smoked. The surrounding environment cannot be ignored, especially when the outdoor spaces and the transportation tools are under examination which is illustrated by the different level of detected pollutants in the case where the home is located in crowded residential area or when the office is located next to a crossroad with a low traffic of vehicles. Also, the decay rate of the PM2.5 is accelerated by the improvement of the ventilation conditions either by going from indoor areas to open spaces (outdoor) or by the usage of mechanical tools such the aspirators if not possible to go outside.\n\nThe infiltration process is also illustrated in the profile (P1-03), while the different infiltration’s pathways either from indoor to outdoor or from outdoor to indoor or even between indoor sub-MEs are examined, since these MEs are in linkage because these zones are not firmly isolated.\n\nDiscussions\n\nLebanon is not considered an industrial or even an agricultural country, as its economic cycle depends mainly on the services sector, such as hotels, restaurants, and tourist places. In addition to its classification as a highly populated country (671 people/km2 of land area in 2018), since globally the average population density is 25 people per km2. These recent facts reflect the contradictory situation represented by the moderate emissions of air pollutants from the limited industries and agricultural activities, while the high population density leads to high load of particulates in the air due to the elevated residential activities, in addition to the high emissions from the large number of vehicles’ exhausts that moves in small country such Lebanon, so that Lebanon’s annual mean of PM2.5 (24.2 µg⁄m3) is significantly higher than the WHO annual mean guideline (10 µg⁄m3), an exceedance by 142%. Like the results obtained in several previous studies (Taneja, 2014), the comparison of rural and urban profiles indicates that rural zones are more polluted than urban ones due to the traditional tools that are used in cooking and heating activities, in addition to the usage of chemical products like pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural activities in such areas. While some other studies have found that urban areas are more polluted than rural ones which contrasts the conclusion of our study (Priftis et al., 2007; Schell & Denham, 2003; Strosnider et al., 2017; Yang, 2020), others were more specific, since the cleanest areas were found to be the industrial area and farms, while the dirtiest areas were found to be the main street and the city center (Elsunousi et al., 2021).\n\nThe reviewed studies consistently showed positive correlations between indoor and outdoor PM2.5 (Mohammed et al., 2015). Both meteorological conditions (e.g., wind speed or relative humidity) and human activity indoors influenced the relationships between the indoor and outdoor concentrations, including the I/O ratios and time lag (Feistel & Hellmuth, 2021; R. Xu et al., 2020). Another study that was conducted sourcing data from 4 homes in Beijing in winter showed that the pollution level is even more serious where outdoor pollution, human activities, and behaviors are the dominant sources of indoor PM2.5. Human activities (cooking, smoking, and cleaning) have more contribution to indoor PM2.5 than outdoor pollution, and in general, the effect of indoor human activities on PM2.5 concentration is stronger than outdoor pollution and air purifiers (Song et al., 2015).\n\nMany sources of air pollutants exist indoors, emitting different types and amounts of air pollutants depending on the materials and fuels used, as well as the type of human activity. Air pollutants can also penetrate indoor environments through mechanical and natural ventilation and infiltrate through gaps and leaks in doors, walls, and windows. The amount of air pollutant transported in and out of dwellings depends on the ventilation and infiltration rate of the outdoor air and the existing indoor and outdoor air quality. Indoor PM2.5 concentrations could be dominated by outdoor sources for residential homes (Deng et al., 2017; Leung, 2015). People’s activities could be the most likely factor rather than outdoor sources for elevated indoor PM2.5 levels (Deng et al., 2017). A similar study showed that when indoor CO2 amounts in exam halls are higher than the limit of harm to health, circulating air in the hallways and keeping the doors of exam halls open throughout the exam period are not adequate for keeping the indoor CO2 amounts below the limit (Cetin, 2017).\n\nOn the other hand, the discrepancy between the three main occupied MEs (outdoor–indoor–transport) confirmed what is indicated in recent studies (Borgini et al., 2015; Hsu et al., 2020; Ozler et al., 2018). Since the transport and indoor MEs revealed a similar level of suspended fine particulates, outdoor MEs are less polluted (18.3 µg⁄m3) and show an exceedance of the WHO’s standards by 83%, contrary to what was seen in 2018, when the atmospheric annual average concentrations of PM2.5 in Beirut, Lebanon, for a period of 12 months exceeded the World Health Organization’s standards by 200% (Farah et al., 2018). This variance is due to the intensive quarantine periods that occurred during the COVID-19 crisis, leading to a remarkable decrease in many polluting activities such transporting, smoking in public zones, and industries. However, all these three MEs show high concentration of PM2.5 which exceeds the WHO annual mean guideline. Seemingly, this reality is related to human activities confined mainly to closed spaces such as home, university, or workplace. While the open spaces are rarely inhabited, the air in these places is in permanent renovation, which reduces the level of dispersed particles emitted from several sources. As for what is observed as the high level of emissions during commuting, this is normal, since cars and various transportations are among the most important sources of the outdoor air pollutants (Zhang & Batterman, 2013), since 93% of the outdoor PM2.5 particle mass concentration was derived from road traffic exhaust in Beirut (Farah et al., 2018).\n\nDuring winter, the meteorological conditions such as low wind speed, high humidity, low boundary layer height, and low rainfall contributed to PM22.5 concentration worsening (Xu et al., 2018). The PM pollution during dust events was very heavy and the rate of increase in the concentration of PM2.5–10 (PM10 are very small particles found in dust and smoke. They have a diameter of 10 μm or smaller) was the highest of the five kinds of particles. During dust-storm events, the highest peaks of the concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5 and PM1.0) occurred 3 h later than those of coarse particles (PM > 10 and PM2.5–10). The major effect of precipitation events on PM is wet scavenging. The scavenging rates of particles were closely associated with the kinds of precipitation events. The scavenging rates of TSP, PM > 10, and PM2.5–10 by convective precipitation were several times as high as those caused by frontal precipitation for the same precipitation amount, the reason being the different formation mechanism and precipitation characteristics of the two kinds of precipitation. Moreover, there exists a limiting value for the scavenging rates of particles by precipitation. The major effect of cold-front events on particles is clearance. However, during cold-front passages, the PM concentrations could sometimes rise first and decrease afterwards, which is the critical difference in the influence of cold fronts on the concentrations of particulate pollutants vs. gaseous pollutants (Feng & Wang, 2012). The precipitation has a certain wet scavenging effect on PM2.5 and PM10. The light rain in winter increases the concentration of pollutants. The changes of PM2.5 before and after precipitation are related to the initial concentration of PM2.5 before precipitation, precipitation intensity, and precipitation duration. When the wind speed increases to 2 m/s, the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 can be reduced (Liu et al., 2020).\n\nAccording to Yuan et al., the PM2.5 emissions are the highest when using coal (1.56 kg/tonne of coal equivalent) followed by oil (0.4044 kg/tce) then by NG (0.08 kg/tce) if considering a constant heating load (Yuan et al., 2015). In Norway, the potential of biomass is much higher than that currently used while knowing that burning stoves are causing 60% of the total PM emissions (Gebremedhin, 2012). Wood is better than oil regarding the PM emissions’ DNA damaging and short-term cytotoxicity (Kasurinen et al., 2015). Wood burning (Olave et al., 2017; Wolf et al., 2016) methods are widely used for residential heating, while they still have significant emissions of PM, organic aerosol, and black carbon (Bertrand et al., 2017). This is mainly due to the cleaning processes of ash that results in the release of fine and coarse particles. Biomass and bio-char preheating is a good technique to improve the system’s performance, while it obviously causes extra PM emissions. The temperature is a significant factor that affects the size and amount of PM produced. This relation cannot be considered proportional because in fact these emissions have specific peak temperatures. In rural areas, oil is the main heating source such as diesel due to the low price of this heating system, burner, and fuel. PAH and formaldehyde are substances that present the toxicity of PMs (Mahmoud et al., 2021). Replacing wood-burning stoves with compressed NG also has effects on PM2.5 emissions, such as in Santiago (Chile) (Mena-Carrasco et al., 2012), where the average annual PM2.5 value was reduced by 2.07 µg/m3. Moreover, synthetic natural gas (SNG) causes less haze pollution (52%) such as PM2.5 compared to wood (Mahmoud et al., 2021).\n\nWhen looking to the differently expressed level of pollutants during the four typical seasons, it is clear that winter is the most polluted period either in rural or urban zones which is confirmed by many studies (Afif et al., 2008; Baltaci et al., 2020; Bodor et al., 2020; Cichowicz et al., 2017; Liu & Ren, 2019; Pan et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2015) due to the usage of different heating tools starting from fireplaces to the wood and diesel’s based heaters that are frequently used in rural zones and arriving to the electrical and gas-based heaters that are frequently used in urban zones. The first set of traditional heating tools raise the load of particulates in the different rural MEs. The high level of pollutants recorded during autumn is due to most of the air samples being taken from an extraordinary home where one of the habitants is addicted to smoking cigarettes, in addition to another extraordinary event which was represented by the popular protests that happened during October 2019 and the accompanying burning of tires and waste containers, especially in urban zones like the capital Beirut. During the spring period, Lebanon is exposed to dusty winds which is one of the interesting climatic factors (Dirani et al., 2021). Moreover, the results of the principal component analysis (PCA) for the PM2.5-bound potentially toxic elements (PTEs) (heavy metals) identified coal combustion and soil/road dust as major sources in winter and spring, respectively (Liu & Ren, 2019).\n\nThe cold period or winter is characterized by the highest values of PM2.5 in both outdoor (23.1 ±0.9μg/m3) and indoor MEs (36.5 ±1.8 μg/m3). The predominance of PM level in indoor places is due to the direct exposure to emissions from different kinds of combustion during the heating process. This level is attenuated however in the ambient air outside, where the exposure is indirect from chimneys, in addition to the dispersion of pollens in the ambient air of rural regions during this season, and especially during the month of March (Baz et al., 2010), while the airborne pollen has the ability to adsorb fine particles. Also, the occurrence of dusty winds during this period raises the level of PM2.5. The common characteristic of all these rural MEs listed above is the exceedance of the PM2.5 level above the WHO Air quality guideline value for the PM2.5 annual mean (10 μg/m3)."
