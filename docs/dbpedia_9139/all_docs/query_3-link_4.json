        "text": "Introduction\n\nAfter the first case in China in December 2019, COVID-19 pandemic now threatens all humanity. Currently, there are 393,502,787 confirmed cases and 5,735,289 deaths on the global scale (JHU 2022). Until now, many scientific studies have been carried out, and a vast amount of scientific articles has been published worldwide to understand the effects of social, demographic, economic, physical, biological, geographic, and environmental factors on COVID-19 incidence rates. The literature survey proffers that few researchers have addressed the issue of principal reasons of the virus spread in Turkey. In addition, previous works have been limited to specific parts of the problem. This study investigates the relationship between possible causes and COVID-19 incidence rates in Turkey with a comprehensive and holistic approach by Geographic Information System (GIS)-based spatial modeling techniques and advanced statistics.\n\nHays (2009) claims that physically inadequate living spaces and environments played an essential role in spreading epidemic and pandemic diseases throughout history and the spread of diseases to enormous masses occurred because of people living together more intensely in line with the development of urbanization. Alirol et al. (2011) state high-density cities as the breeding ground for pandemics. People live together in cities, come together in public spaces, use public transportation, and consciously or unconsciously violate the social distance necessary to protect themselves. An increasing number of studies have found that population density has a strong positive correlation with the COVID-19 spread (Sarkar et al. 2021; Arif and Sengupta 2021; Coşkun et al. 2021; Mehmood et al. 2021; Mishra et al. 2020; Mansour et al. 2021; Hamidi et al. 2020; Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson 2020; Rocklöv and Sjödin 2020; Wheaton and Thompson 2020). More recent evidence reveals that transmission of the virus increases with the social and spatial interaction between people, so urbanized areas are favorable environments for the spread of outbreaks because of their building and population density. Conversely, Carozzi et al. (2020) have found no association between population density and COVID-19 incidence rates in urban counties of the USA. On the other hand, Bhadra et al. (2021) have found a moderate association between population density and COVID-19 spread in India through deep regression and correlation analyses based on case numbers and mortality rates. Gavi (2020) argues that urbanization rate and climate change are effective on the virus spread, too. Since COVID-19 is an airborne disease, meteorological conditions such as daily sunshine duration, temperature, wind, humidity, and air quality may influence the spread of the virus (Iqbal et al. 2020; Qi et al. 2020; Xie and Zhu 2020; Wu et al. 2020). Gupta et al. (2020), Xie and Zhu (2020), Tosepu et al. (2020), Bashir et al. (2020), Chen et al. (2020), and Şahin (2020) affirm that there is a linear correlation with average air temperature and COVID-19 cases in different countries such as India, Indonesia, Turkey, and the USA. Humidity is accepted as another influential factor in virus spread by some researchers, such as Ahmadi et al. (2020), Ali and Alharbi (2020), Auler et al. (2020), and Wu et al. (2020). Thangariyal et al. (2020) point out a negative and substantial correlation between daily sunshine duration and COVID-19 cases after examining 138 countries worldwide. In addition, Zhu et al. (2020), Frontera et al. (2020), and Wang et al. (2020) consider that the wind has an indirect effect on virus spread by affecting air quality. Alternatively, Coşkun et al. (2021) report the direct effect of wind speed on virus spread by increasing air circulation in Turkey. Correspondingly, air quality may be another comprehensive indicator of the spread of many airborne viruses like COVID-19 (Zhang et al. 2020a). Firstly, where air pollution is high, the virus can stay in the air longer, travel further distances, spread over larger areas, and penetrate deeper into the lungs (Andree 2020; Zhu et al. 2020; Doremalen et al. 2020). Secondly, air pollution may negatively affect the normal functions of the lungs and make some people more vulnerable than others to the virus (Ali and Alharbi 2020; Korber 2020; Helen 2020; Fattorini and Regoli 2020). Saadat et al. (2020) found that different socioeconomic groups react differently to the virus spread, especially that household size may positively affect the incident rates. The household-based studies highlight the virus’s secondary attack rate for household contacts, which is much higher than that for non-household close contacts (Jing et al. 2020). That means if infected people are not isolated, the disease risk increases for their household. In their overview, Zhang et al. (2021) underline that cities with higher GDP values are more at risk than others because of the virus spread due to higher trade and commercial activities among people. Likewise, Zhang et al. (2020b) investigated a robust positive correlation between case numbers and GDP in Chinese cities. Mansour et al. (2021) explored sociodemographic and health factors such as age structure, population density, hospital beds, and nursing practitioners to explain and predict the spatial transmission of the incidence rates in Oman. They maintain that the incidence rate increases as parallel to an increase in age, especially that people older than 65 years are more at risk than the others. Age may be a crucial factor for the incident rates because younger and older people have different susceptibility levels. Reniers (2020) outlines several reasons that young people take more risks against social distancing and other precautions. Zhang et al. (2021) draw our attention to the inverse correlation between the health indicators such as the number of health institutions, health personnel, hospital beds, and the case numbers after examining 342 cities of China. In their review, Sands et al. (2016) affirm that health infrastructure, health surveillance, and response measures directly affect any virus spread; thus, each province’s physician number and hospital bed capacity are crucial factors to fight against these types of viruses. In a study conducted in Oman, COVID-19 incidence rates have been found to be negatively associated with hospital bed numbers (Mansour et al. 2021).\n\nUnderstanding the principal variables and the main characteristics of the virus will help us propose a new way of urbanism for post-pandemic cities (Megahed and Ghoneim 2020). There may be hundreds of factors affecting the virus spread in different regions under divergent physical and social conditions. In line with the official data available, this study focuses on eighteen possibly explanatory variables, which are population density, urbanization level, median age, household size, GDP per capita, average air temperature, humidity, daily sunshine duration, average wind speed, air quality index, health index, income and wealth index, education index, environment index, social life index, life satisfaction ratio, number of hospital beds, and total physician number in the cities.\n\nData and method\n\nThe Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health releases weekly situation reports about COVID-19 statistics, including provincial incidence rates and case numbers since February 8, 2021. This study has been conducted by 5 months of provincial data published until July 9, 2021. Table enumerates the COVID-19 numbers for each province based on the official data published between February 8, 2021, and July 9, 2021.\n\nTable 1\n\nProvinceCase noIncidence rateİstanbul924,7935959Ankara215,5823823İzmir110,7102535Konya99,3854452Bursa98,9883239Kocaeli90,5434636Samsun79,1595870Antalya61,7122457Kayseri56,8454039Balıkesir54,1334406Tekirdağ50,3334769Gaziantep43,7882116Ordu38,7665140Eskişehir36,7504141Sakarya34,3593337Mersin34,1401855Trabzon33,8474184Manisa30,6132125Adana30,3241355Malatya30,2223777Erzurum28,6543760Çanakkale28,3715233Tokat26,9734402Hatay24,9551532Giresun24,9185557Diyarbakır22,7971298Zonguldak20,3673417Kütahya20,0943469Aydın19,7421777Muğla19,6531999Kırklareli18,9495237Denizli18,8461817Çorum18,6233508Afyonkarahisar18,5732546Sivas18,4852893Şanlıurfa18,414888K.

So, inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation tool of ArcGIS, a commercially available software package, has been used to produce spatial distribution maps related to all the variables. The dataset is based on point data of 81 city centers, including spatial and non-spatial data about the provinces, acquired from Turkey’s Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning. Figure illustrates the distribution of confirmed case numbers in Turkey.\n\nİstanbul has 924,793 cases, the highest COVID-19 case number among Turkish cities. Ankara, İzmir, and Konya provinces follow it. A distribution map of case numbers is not enough to understand the reasons and regional differences of the virus spread. While the population of İstanbul is 15,519.267, the population of Tunceli Province is just 84,660 (Turkstat 2020). Naturally, the case counts are much higher in Istanbul, which has a 183 times greater population size. For this reason, the case distribution has been normalized for all provinces. Figure depicts the spatial distribution of confirmed COVID-19 incidence rates (case number per 100,000 people) in Turkey.\n\nFigure demonstrates that the Marmara, Mid-Black Sea, and Eastern Black Sea regions have the highest incidence rates while Southeast Anatolia and the south part of Eastern Anatolia regions have the lowest rates. As the figures reveal the regional differences, this study will use correlation and regression analyses to determine the reasons and the association between possible factors and COVID-19 incidence rates. While correlation is a model that defines the relationship between two or more variables through their covariance (Demir 2019), a regression model gives the relationship’s mathematical function among variables. That function may estimate the value of a variable based on other variables. Regression analysis explains a variation on the dependent variable (Y) with independent variables (X1, X2, X3, …, Xn). The dependent variable is explained or predicted in the regression model (Ersöz and Ersöz 2019). This variable is assumed to be associated with the independent variables, also called explanatory variables in the regression model (Karataş 2014). The linear equation between Yi and Xi variables is obtained as follows:\n\nYi=β0+β1Xi1+β2Xi2+β3Xi3+⋯βnXin+ϵi-\n\n1\n\nwhere Y is the expected value of the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, β is the regression coefficient, Ɛ is the residual, and n is the number of independent variables.\n\nTable lists the variables used in this study in line with the literature survey and available official data.\n\nTable 2\n\nDependent variableIndependent variablesCOVID-19 incidence rate (case number per 100,000 people)Population density (p/km2)Urbanization level (%)Median ageAverage household sizeGross domestic product (USD)Annual average temperature (°C)Humidity (%)Annual sunshine duration (h/year)Annual average wind speed (m/s)Air quality index (AQI)Health indexIncome and wealth indexEducation indexEnvironment indexSocial life indexLife satisfaction ratio (%)Number of hospital bedsPhysician no. (per 1000 people)\n\nThe data about all the variables have been ensured from the local and central government agencies.\n\nPopulation density shows the population size in the areas where people live. It can be calculated by proportioning the population size with the province’s total surface area. Population numbers and case counts have an obvious positive relationship, but the relationship of incidence and population density differs. Figure portrays the population density distribution in different regions of Turkey.\n\nThe population density of Turkey is 107.45 people per km2 all over the country. Marmara region is the most densely populated region, including İstanbul (2842 p/km2) and Kocaeli (575 p/km2) cities. On the other hand, Erzincan (20 p/km2), Ardahan (19.7 p/km2), and Tunceli (11 p/km2) have the lowest population density in the country. In Turkey, while people living in urban areas are 93% of the citizens, 7% of residents live in rural areas (MoH 2018). The median age is 32.4 (Turkstat 2020), the average household size is 3.35 (Turkstat 2019), and according to Turkstat (2018b), the average GDP per capita is 9693 USD. Figure illustrates the distribution maps of urban population ratio, household size, median age, and GDP per capita values.\n\nThe spatial distribution maps of the meteorological factors in Turkey based on official annual data are given in Fig. . While heat is a sum of the kinetic energy of particles that make up a substance, temperature refers to the reflection of this energy to the outside. Temperature is measured by a thermometer and expressed in °C (Doğrusöz 2018). The annual average temperature of Turkey is 13.2 °C. Air quality index (AQI) classifies air pollution to characterize the air quality in particular regions, and it is based on five basic contaminative which are particulate matters (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (WAQI 2020). AQI data for Turkey has been gathered from IQAir (2020) and MoEU (2021). The average AQI for Turkey is 45.60, which means air pollution poses a minor threat except for some regions with polluted and unhealthy air conditions. The amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is called humidity. A hygrometer is used to measure the humidity of the air. Turkish State Meteorological Service (TSMS 2020a) reported the average relative humidity in Turkey as 63.7%. The length of time that shows how much of the day is sunny is called daily sunshine duration, and it is measured by heliograph. In Turkey, the average daily sunshine duration is 6.6 h by the measurements between 2011 and 2018 (TSMS 2020b).\n\nThe wind is another meteorological factor that may allow the virus to spread in the air and travel longer distances. The average wind speed of Turkey is 2 m/s at 10 m above ground (TSMS 2020b). Figure shows the spatial distribution of wind speed in different regions of Turkey. Çanakkale has the highest wind speed, which is 6.6 m/s, followed by İzmir (5 m/s), Mardin (4.9 m/s), and İstanbul (4.5 m/s). Provinces with the lowest wind speed are Gaziantep (1.4 m/s), Çankırı (1.3 m/s), and Düzce (1.24 m/s).\n\nHospital beds are placed in patient rooms or units where patients are provided with a minimum of 24 h of medical care (MoH 2018). According to reports of Turkstat (2018a), the average hospital bed number is 2.76, and the average physician number is 1.5 per 1000 residents in Turkey (Fig. ).\n\nLife index, produced by the Turkish Statistical Institute based on the OECD Better Life Index, is a study for monitoring and comparing people’s living conditions under objective and subjective criteria at a local level. This composite index includes 11 leading indicators and 41 sub-indicators at province-based statistics (Turkstat 2015). However, the primary indicators are housing, career, income and wealth, education, health, safety, environment, civil engagement, social life, access to infrastructure services, and life satisfaction; just five of these indicators have been used in this study to investigate their relationship with COVID-19 patient density. Health index is calculated by some fundamental factors such as satisfaction rate about health infrastructure and public health services available in the cities. The average health index is 0.59 for Turkey. Income and wealth index is calculated by average daily earnings, savings deposit per capita, job satisfaction rate, and percentage of households in the lower-, middle-, and higher-income levels. The average income and wealth index is 0.40 for Turkey. Education index includes the percentage of higher education graduates, schooling ratio of kindergartens, and average points of necessary examinations like the transition to secondary and higher education. The average education index is 0.53 for Turkey. Environment index includes active green area per km2, percentage of the population receiving waste services, satisfaction rate with municipal cleaning services, and infrastructure. The average environment index is 0.59 for Turkey. Social life index is another leading indicator, including cinema and theater audience ratio, satisfaction rate with social life and social relations, and shopping mall area per thousand people. The average social life index is 0.42 for Turkey. Life satisfaction ratio shows residents’ happiness level about their living standards in the provinces where they live. The average life satisfaction ratio is 61.2% for Turkey (Turkstat 2016). Figure depicts the spatial distribution maps of these indexes in Turkey.\n\nAfter defining, visualizing, and understanding all the variables, a multiple linear regression analysis will be performed to explore relationships between dependent and independent variables to understand the factors behind observed spatial patterns of COVID-19. However, firstly, it is required to understand the characteristics of the data for further steps. For this purpose, descriptive statistics of all the variables have been prepared in SPSS software and are given in Table .\n\nTable 3\n\nVariablesMeanSDMedianMinMaxKurtosisSkewnessCOVID-19 incidence rate3037126830035215959 − 0.550.22Population density130.2318.76311.2284267.57.93Urbanization level68.423.7563.4022.40100 − 1.30 − 0.01Median age10.163.4610.903.2018.3 − 0.57 − 0.18Household size3.450.753.182.636.111.991.60GDP725025716745320416,7912.791.32Avg. temperature13.033.2513.103.6019.10.43 − 0.41Humidity666.75654881 − 0.280.24Annual sunshine duration2688283.6269021243508 − 0.310.12Avg. wind speed (m/s)2.700.932.561.246.562.761.23Air quality index45.621.44121161.070.63Health index0.590.110.620.300.840.24 − 0.61Income and wealth index0.400.170.440.020.88 − 0.03 − 0.22Education index0.530.140.570.100.750.89 − 1.12Environment index0.590.120.610.200.811.17 − 1.03Social life index0.420.120.410.190.67 − 0.720.15Life satisfaction ratio617.5360.44277.7 − 0.270.15No. of hospital beds2.760.822.601.205.020.390.76Physician no1.50.57113 − 0.630.59\n\nDescriptive statistics are essential to understand that the data is normally distributed or not. For a normal distribution, the central tendency measures like mean and median values must be close to each other as much as possible. Also, smaller standard deviation values mean less spread out of the observations. In addition, if kurtosis and skewness values are between − 1 and + 1, that means distribution is inside the range of normality. The degree and direction of asymmetry in the dataset are measured by skewness. If the skewness value is zero, that means a perfectly normal distribution. If the skewness value is positive, the mean value is more than the median in the dataset, and vice versa. By kurtosis value, which is a measure of tail extremity, it is possible to see there are outliers in a distribution or not. Positive and negative kurtosis values show the occurrence of outliers in the dataset (UCLA 2021). Table presents that, although the datasets of the dependent variable and most of the other variables are trustworthy, some independent variables such as household size, population density, and GDP are not entirely reliable due to lack of data. Some scatterplot diagrams have been prepared to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables; to detect the outliers, if any; and to determine whether a relationship is linear or not (Fig. ).\n\nThe scatterplots in Fig. reveal that there may be a positive association between the incidence rate and population density, median age, GDP, humidity, different types of well-being indexes, and number of hospital beds. There may be moderate or almost no relationship between the dependent variable and urbanization level, wind speed, air quality index, life satisfaction ratio, and physician number. On the other hand, sunshine duration, average temperature, and household size show a negative linear relationship with the incidence rates. For a better understanding, the Pearson correlation coefficient of each independent variable has been calculated to measure the statistical relationship, summarized in Table .\n\nTable 4\n\nIndependent variablesCOVID 19 incidence rate (dependent variable)Pearson correlationSig.

A coefficient value between ± 0.5 and ± 1 states a strong correlation, a value between ± 0.3 and ± 0.49 means moderate correlation, and a value under ± 0.29 indicates small correlation (Statistics Solutions 2021). Table presents that sunshine duration and household size have the strongest correlation with the incidence rates. Income level, education index, and median age variables seem like the other strongly correlated factors. Moreover, correlation is significant for all these variables at the 0.01 level. GDP, humidity, health index, environment, social life, and number of hospital beds show a moderate correlation while the other variables have small or no correlation with COVID-19 incidence rates. Descriptive statistics, scatterplot diagrams, and correlation coefficients suggest that model estimates are not biased and have been conducive to understand the data’s characteristics and associations between dependent and independent variables. In addition, the data seems well founded for the robustness and accuracy of the regression model. This study has only one dependent variable and eighteen predictors, so a multiple linear regression analysis has been conducted in SPSS software. Table summarizes the model.\n\nTable 5\n\nModelRR2Adjusted R2Std. error of the estimate10.8270.6850.593808,666\n\nIn Table , R is the multiple correlation coefficient, and its value (0.827) indicates a good level of prediction for the dependent variable. R2 value (0.685) means that our exploratory variables explain 68.5% of the variability of COVID-19 incidence rates, while 31.5% of the variation occurs due to other factors not included in this model. Nevertheless, the model is effective enough to determine the relationship. The adjusted R2 value (0.593) means the predictors explain true 59.3% of the variation in the outcome variable in the model. The standard error of the estimate value (808,666), also called the root mean square error, seems higher than average, but it is acceptable due to the lack of data and sample size used in the study.\n\nTo sum up, the model summary table is satisfactory, and the database used in the study is plausible. Therefore, as the next step, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) tool has been used to test whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of independent groups or not. Table lists the ANOVA results.\n\nTable 6\n\nModelANOVASum of squaresdfMean squareFSig1Regression88,045,400.1184,891,411.1177.4800.000Residual40,544,315.4562653,940.572Total128,589,715.680\n\nIn Table , the Sig. value (p value) is less than 0.05. That means the results are significant and trustworthy. The F ratio is important to see if the overall regression model is a good fit for the data or not. Here, the F ratio value (7.48) is greater than 1 and shows that the exploratory variables statistically significantly predict the COVID-19 incidence rates.

That means we can expect the COVID-19 incidence rate to be 732.25 anywhere in Turkey. The B column includes the values for predicting the dependent variable from the exploratory variables in the regression equation. In the B column, a 1-unit increase in any positive variable causes an increase in the COVID-19 incidence rate, but each negative value in the column causes a reduction in the dependent variable. The beta weight (beta column) values are the standardized coefficients, and they measure how much the outcome variable changes in standard deviations when the exploratory variable is changed by 1 standard deviation (Dhakal 2018). Hence, the education index (0.39), median age (0.39), and urbanization level (0.38) seem like the highest contributing predictors to explain COVID-19 incident rates. Zero-order correlation values show the bivariate correlation between the dependent and independent variables. The highest values in this column, sunshine duration value (− 0.61) and household size value (− 0.60), are the direct effect of these variables on COVID-19 incidence rates. Multicollinearity check is also substantial for a well-specified regression model. Dhakal (2018) says that if the VIF value is higher than 10 or the tolerance value is lower than 0.1, there is a multicollinearity problem. That means just median age and household size seem as the problematical predictors in the model in terms of multicollinearity, which means there is a very high relationship between these two variables. Therefore, the median age has been excluded from the final regression model. In the most important column, significance values show that urbanization level (p(0.006) < 0.05), average temperature (p(0.01) < 0.05), sunshine duration (p(0.029) < 0.05), wind speed (p(0.038) < 0.05), and education index (p(0.036) < 0.05) are statistically significant to be used in the model while the others are not more useful in the model. The analyses show that the regression model is not specified well enough, and there is multicollinearity among some of the variables. Thus, a final regression model has been tested by using only the statistically significant exploratory predictors. Table gives the model summary of the final regression analysis.\n\nTable 8\n\nModelModel summaryRR2Adjusted R2Std. error of the estimate10.755a0.5700.542858.171\n\nR value (0.755) indicates a good level of prediction for the dependent variable. R2 value (0.570) indicates that these five variables explain 57% of the variability of COVID-19 incidence rates, while 43% of the variation is because of other factors not included in this study. Adjusted R2 value (0.542) means true 54.2% of the variation in the COVID-19 incidence rate is explained by the predictors in the final model. As an additional and final analysis, spatial dependency among the COVID-19 incidence rate observations was tested using the ArcGIS Spatial Autocorrelation (Global Moran’s I) tool, and a statistically significant spatial cluster pattern was found (Fig. ).\n\nIn Fig. , the z-score is + 7.20, which means the analyzed attributes are not randomly distributed among the features in the area, and COVID-19 incident rates are clustered in some regions in Turkey. Also, the p value (significance level) in the analysis is less than 0.01 and seems statistically significant, and the regression model used in this study has a confidence level of 99%. That means the model is genuinely specified, and results can be trusted."
