After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and following Turkish War of Independence, an exodus by the large portion of Turkish (Turkic) and Muslim peoples from the Balkans (Balkan Turks, Albanians, Bosniaks, Pomaks), Caucasus (Abkhazians, Ajarians, Circassians, Chechens), Crimea (Crimean Tatar diaspora), and Crete (Cretan Turks) took refuge in present-day Turkey and moulded the country's fundamental features. Trends of immigration towards Turkey continue to this day, although the motives are more varied and are usually in line with the patterns of global immigration movements — Turkey, for example, receives many economic migrants from nearby countries such as Armenia, Moldova, Georgia, Iran, and Azerbaijan, but also from Central Asia, Ukraine and Russia. Turkey's migrant crisis during the 2010s saw high numbers of people arriving in Turkey, particularly those fleeing the Syrian civil war.\n\nAs of August 2023, the number of refugees of the Syrian civil war in Turkey was estimated to be 3,307,882 people. The number of Syrians had decreased by 205,894 people since the beginning of the year.[26] In 2022, nearly 100 000 Russian citizens migrated to Turkey, becoming the first in the list of foreigners who moved to Turkey, meaning an increase of more than 218% from 2021.[27]\n\nIn order to obtain Turkish citizenship there is a range of legal grounds, which can include: reunification with their family, marriage to a Turkish citizen, for the purchase of real estate worth $400,000 from a Turkish citizen or company.[28] The minimum investment amount was increased in May 2022, previously it was enough to invest $250,000. Also the basis is to work in Turkey, training, business, medical treatment, refugee status.\n\nIn 2023 the foreign population of Türkiye decreased by 253,293 down to 1,570,543.[29]\n\nPopulation in Turkey by country of citizenship by the end of each years:[25]\n\nCountry 2022 2021 2020 Total people living in Turkey 85 279 553 84 680 273 83 614 362 Turkey 83 455 717 (97.86%) 82 888 237 (97.88%) 82 280 952 (98.41%) Total foreign population 1 823 836 (2.14%) 1 792 036 (2.12%) 1 333 410 (1.59%) Iraq 275 305 (0.32%) 322 015 (0.38%) 281 074 (0.34%) Afghanistan 186 160 (0.22%) 183 567 (0.22%) 158 252 (0.19%) Russian Federation 151 049 (0.18%) 66 786 (0.08%) 43 679 (0.05%) Iran 117 026 (0.14%) 128 883 (0.15%) 68 561 (0.08%) Turkmenistan 116 447 (0.14%) 123 965 (0.15%) 91 218 (0.11%) Germany 110 453 (0.13%) 102 592 (0.12%) 92 284 (0.11%) Syria 99 360 (0.12%) 104 554 (0.12%) 88 907 (0.11%) Azerbaijan 68 884 (0.08%) 68 562(0.08%) 48 495 (0.06%) Uzbekistan 61 754 (0.07%) 71 145 (0.08%) 36 510 (0.04%) Ukraine 50 357 (0.06%) 23 377 (0.03%) 17 505 (0.02%) Kazakhstan 45 530 (0.05%) 39 454 (0.05%) 23 645 (0.03%) Egypt 33 040 (0.04%) 34 162 (0.04%) 25 475 (0.03%) Palestine 26 278 (0.03%) 28 027 (0.03%) 17 915 (0.02%) Kyrgyzstan 24 485 (0.03%) 26 541 (0.03%) 18 019 (0.02%) Jordan 22 733 (0.03%) 23 656 (0.03%) 14 260 (0.02%) Libya 21 677 (0.03%) 24 188 (0.03%) 18 607 (0.02%) Austria 21 311 (0.02%) 19 900 (0.02%) 18 047 (0.02%) Somalia 20 906 (0.02%) 28 081 (0.03%) 17 245 (0.02%) Yemen 19 099 (0.02%) 18 094 (0.02%) 14 927 (0.02%) Morocco 18 482 (0.02%) 20 520 (0.02%) 12 122 (0.01%) United Kingdom 17 193 (0.02%) 16 440 (0.02%) 13 985 (0.02%) China 16 880 (0.02%) 20 486 (0.02%) 18 740 (0.02%) Bulgaria 16 612 (0.02%) 15 426 (0.02%) 14 195 (0.02%) Pakistan 16 505 (0.02%) 17 290 (0.02%) 7 248 (0.01%) Georgia 14 680 (0.02%) 19 276 (0.02%) 15 661 (0.02%) Greece 13 583 (0.02%) 12 569 (0.01%) 12 137 (0.01%) Nigeria 12 928 (0.02%) 12 920 (0.02%) 7 120 (0.01%) United States 12 793 (0.02%) 12 773 (0.02%) 9 032 (0.01%) Lebanon 12 430 (0.01%) 13 242 (0.02%) 5 943 (0.01%) Algeria 12 248 (0.01%) 10 698 (0.01%) 5 914 (0.01%) Sudan 11 613 (0.01%) 9 538 (0.01%) 3 193 (<0.01%) Indonesia 11 280 (0.01%) 10 219 (0.01%) 5 226 (0.01%) Netherlands 8 104 (0.01%) 7 686 (0.01%) 6 550 (0.01%) Tajikistan 7 153 (0.01%) 7 965 (0.01%) 3 626 (<0.01%) Moldova 6 790 (0.01%) 7 546 (0.01%) 6 295 (0.01%) Kuwait 6 190 (0.01%) 5 498 (0.01%) 3 559 (<0.01%) Ethiopia 6 165 (0.01%) 6 633 (0.01%) 2 936 (<0.01%) Tunisia 6 075 (0.01%) 6 033 (0.01%) 2 961 (<0.01%) Belarus 5 169 (0.01%) 3 873 (<0.01%) India 4 669 (0.01%) 3 092 (<0.01%) France 4 526 (0.01%) 4 294 (0.01%) 3 181 (<0.01%)\n\nInternal migration\n\n[edit]\n\nPlace of origin (rows) versus place of residence (columns) for Turkish citizens in 2014[30] Regions İstanbul West Marmara Aegean East Marmara West Anatolia Mediterranean Central Anatolia West Black Sea East Black Sea Northeast Anatolia Central East Anatolia Southeast Anatolia Total Population İstanbul 2,162,588 79,009 72,123 84,689 38,802 38,673 4,858 11,976 9,147 3,533 3,667 4,754 2,513,819 West Marmara 523,725 2,378,938 187,256 135,364 44,409 27,376 5,140 10,238 4,513 5,273 7,110 8,861 3,338,203 Aegean 297,143 76,518 7,047,801 210,522 134,073 166,785 16,606 22,252 10,354 14,936 20,388 28,224 8,045,602 East Marmara 520,698 67,299 131,586 4,317,877 187,043 61,782 10,715 33.371 10,701 8,074 9,775 12,286 5,371,207 West Anatolia 272,835 35,919 259,387 127,794 3,721,634 192,934 49,942 29,545 8,468 10,360 13,727 20,850 4,743,395 Mediterranean 470,673 53,295 250,529 111,393 228,398 7,329,964 100,729 32,461 16,963 21,667 46,013 181,874 8,843,959 Central Anatolia 1,346,007 92,421 297,114 235,407 1,223,857 305,343 3,466,971 70,729 16,604 20,204 32,153 36,818 7,143,628 West Black Sea 2,637,016 186,103 252,628 458,730 956,151 133,053 54,578 3,982,185 42,935 18,878 21,757 27,735 8,771,749 East Black Sea 1,918,805 96,494 152,843 529,110 241,801 70,823 19,104 198,869 2,382,704 33,854 11,852 13,140 5,669,399 Northeast Anatolia 1,580,876 120,086 504,588 593,882 344,929 101,600 63,029 34,656 32,761 2,009,253 39,921 20,576 5,446,157 Central East Anatolia 1,293,157 86,315 359,161 299,390 167,451 393,102 31,612 22,064 11,070 31,709 3,438,577 133,862 6,267,470 Southeast Anatolia 1,197,959 65,538 445,279 174,765 156,489 1,002,771 33,876 23,666 11,689 22,036 150,028 7,738,941 11,023,037 Total population 14,221,482 3,337,935 9,960,295 7,278,923 7,445,037 9,824,206 3,857,160 4,472,012 2,557,909 2,199,777 3,794,968 8,227,921 77,177,625\n\nEthnicity\n\n[edit]\n\nModern Turkey was founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as secular (Laiklik, Turkish adaptation of French Laïcité), i.e. without a state religion, or separate ethnic divisions/ identities. The concept of \"minorities\" has only been accepted by the Republic of Turkey as defined by the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) and thence strictly limited to Greeks, Jews and Armenians, only based on religious affiliation, excluding from the scope of the concept the ethnic identities of these minorities as of others such as the Kurds who make up 15% of the country; others include Assyrians/Syriacs of various Christian denominations, Alevis and all the others.[31][32][33][34] Provisions of the Lausanne Treaty were extended to Bulgarians in Turkey by the Turkey-Bulgaria Friendship Treaty (Türkiye ve Bulgaristan Arasındaki Dostluk Antlaşması) of 18 October 1925.[33][35][36][37] According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Turkey), as of 2008, there were 89,000 Turkish citizens belonging to one of the three recognized minorities, two thirds of Armenian descent.[38] On 18 June 2013, the Ankara 13th Circuit Administrative Court unanimously ruled that the Assyrians were included as beneficiaries of the Lausanne Treaty,[39] so that Assyrians were allowed to open the first school teaching in their mother tongue.[40][41]\n\nThe word Turk or Turkish also has a wider meaning in a historical context because, at times, especially in the past, it has been used to refer to all Muslim inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire irrespective of their ethnicity.[42]\n\nAccording to the 2016 edition of the CIA World Factbook, 70–75% of Turkey's population consists of ethnic Turks, with Kurds accounting for 19% and other minorities between 6 and 11%.[43] According to Milliyet, a 2008 report prepared for the National Security Council of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern Anatolia suggested that there are approximately 55 million ethnic Turks, 9.6 million Kurds, 3 million Zazas, 2.5 million Circassians, 2 million Bosniaks, 500,000–1.3 million Albanians, 1,000,000 Georgians, 870,000 Arabs, 600,000 Pomaks, 80,000 Laz, 60,000 Armenians, 30,000 British, 25,000 Assyrians/Syriacs, 20,000 Jews, and 15,000 Greeks, 500 Yazidis living in Turkey.[44]\n\nAccording to a survey published in 2022 by Konda Research, Turks make up 77% of the population, while 19% self-identify as Kurd. Arabs (Syrian refugees excluded) make up 2%, and other ethnic groups are 2% of the population.[45]\n\nSince the immigration to the big cities in the west of Turkey, interethnic marriage has become more common. A recent study estimates that there are 2,708,000 marriages between Turks and Kurds.[46]\n\nAccording to a survey done in March 2020 by Area Araştırma, 20.4% of the total population of Turkey claim to be Kurdish (either Kurmanji speaking or Zazaki speaking).\n\nEthnolinguistic estimates in 2014 by Ethnologue and Jacques Leclerc:[47][48][49]\n\nPeople Population Percentage Language Status Anatolian Turks 53,402,000 70.6% Turkish 1 (National) Kurmanji Kurds 8,127,000 10.7% Kurmanji 3 (Wider communication) Turcophones, Kurds 5,881,000 7.7% Turkish 1 (National) Zaza 1,155,000 1.5% Zaza 5 (Developing) Arabs 1,133,000 1.4% Levantine Arabic Kabardians, Circassians 1,062,000 1.4 % Kabardian 5 (Developing) Iraqi Arabs 722,000 0.9% Mesopotamian Arabic 6a (Vigorous) Azerbaijani 540,000 0.7% Azerbaijani 5 (Developing) Romani 500,000 (1985) 0.7% Romani, Domari Gagauzes 418,000 0.5% Balkan Gagauz Turkish 7 (Shifting) Pomaks 351,000 0.4% Bulgarian 5 (Dispersed) Pontic Greeks 321,000 0.4% Pontic Greek 6a (Vigorous) Adyghe, Circassians 316,000 0.4% Adyghe 5 (Developing) Alevi Kurds 184,000 0.2% Zazaki Georgians 151,000 0,1 % Georgian 6b (Threatened) Bosniaks 101,000 0.1% Bosnian Chechens 101,000 0.1% Chechen Crimean Tatars 100,000 0.1% Crimean Tatar 5 (Developing) Lazi 93,000 0.1% Laz language 6b (Threatened) Karakalpaks 74,000 Karakalpak Albanians 66,000 Tosk Albanian 6b (Threatened) Armenians 61,000 Armenian 6b (Threatened) Abkhazians 44,000 Abkhazian 6b (Threatened) Han Chinese 38,000 Chinese Ossetians 37,000 Ossetian British 35,000 English Bulgarians 32,000 Bulgarian Jews 30,000 Turkish, Ladino 7 (Shifting) Tatars 26,000 Tatar Assyrians 25,000 Aramaic 22,000 Urdu Assyrians 15,000 Turoyo 6b (Threatened) Turks other (Hemshin, Meskhetian Turks, Gajal) 57,000 Turkish Kurds other (Herki and Shikaki) 62,000 Kurdish Other 180,000 Total 75,566,800\n\nLanguages\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Languages of Turkey\n\nNo exact data is available concerning the different ethnic groups in Turkey.

According to the government, 99.8% of the Turkish population is Muslim, mostly Sunni, some 8 million are Alevis.[57] The remaining 0.2% is other - mostly Christians and Jews.[11] However, these are based on the existing religion information written on every citizen's national id card, that is automatically passed on from the parents to every newborn, and do not necessarily represent individual choice. Religious records can be changed or even blanked on the request of citizen, by filing an e-government application since May 2020, using a valid electronic signature to sign the electronic application. Any change in religion records additionally results in a new ID card being issued. Any change in religion record also leaves a permanent trail in the census record, however, record of change of religion is not accessible except for the citizen in question, next-of-kins of the citizen in question, the citizenship administration and courts.[58]\n\nIn a poll conducted by Sabancı University in 2006, 98.3% of Turks revealed they were Muslim.[59] A Eurobarometer Poll in 2005 reported that in a poll 98% of Turkish citizens answered that \"they believe there is a God\", while 1% responded that \"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force\".[60] In a Pew Research Center survey, 53% of Turkey's Muslims said that \"religion is very important in their lives\".[61] Based on the Gallup Poll 2006–08, Turkey was defined as More religious, in which over 63 percent of people believe religion is important.[62][63] According to the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation, 62% of women wear the headscarf or hijab in Turkey.[64][65][66]\n\nA poll conducted by Eurobarometer and KONDA and some other research institutes in 2013 showed that around 0.5% of the population had no religion. Another poll conducted by the same institutions in 2018 showed that 3% of those interviewed had no religion.[67][68]\n\nAccording to Ipsos survey,[69] in 2016 Islam was the major religion in Turkey comprising 82% of the total population, followed by religiously unaffiliated people, comprising 13% of the population, and Christians, forming 0.2%.\n\nReligiosity\n\n[edit]\n\nThe vast majority of the present-day Turkish people are Muslim and the most popular sect is the Hanafite school of Sunni Islam, which was officially espoused by the Ottoman Empire; according to the KONDA Research and Consultancy survey carried out throughout Turkey on 2007:[70][57][71]\n\n52.8% defined themselves as \"a religious person who strives to fulfill religious obligations\" (Religious)\n\n34.3 % defined themselves as \"a believer who does not fulfill religious obligations\" (Not religious).\n\n9.7% defined themselves as \"a fully devout person fulfilling all religious obligations\" (Fully devout).\n\n2.3% defined themselves as \"someone who does not believe in religious obligations\" (Non-believer).\n\n0.9% defined themselves as \"someone with no religious conviction\" (Atheist).\n\nIn 2018 KONDA released a new study:[72][73]\n\n51% defined themselves as \"a religious person who strives to fulfill religious obligations\" (Religious)\n\n34% defined themselves as \"a believer who does not fulfill religious obligations\" (Not religious).\n\n10% defined themselves as \"a fully devout person fulfilling all religious obligations\" (Fully devout).\n\n2% defined themselves as \"someone who does not believe in religious obligations\" (Non-believer).\n\n3% defined themselves as \"someone with no religious conviction\" (Atheist).\n\nAmong those aged between 15 and 29 years old:[74]\n\n43% defined themselves as \"a religious person who strives to fulfill religious obligations\" (Religious)\n\n45% defined themselves as \"a believer who does not fulfill religious obligations\" (Not religious).\n\n5% defined themselves as \"a fully devout person fulfilling all religious obligations\" (Fully devout).\n\n4% defined themselves as \"someone who does not believe in religious obligations\" (Non-believer).\n\n4% defined themselves as \"someone with no religious conviction\" (Atheist).\n\nThere is concern over the future of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which suffers from a lack of trained clergy due to the closure of the Halki school. The state does not recognise the Ecumenical status of the Patriarch of Constantinople.[75]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Turkish provinces by life expectancy\n\nCensus in Turkey\n\nMinorities in Turkey\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
