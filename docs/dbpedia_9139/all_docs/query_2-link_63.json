The male population amounted to 42 million 428 thousand 101 people, while the female population amounted to 42 million 252 thousand 172 people. In other words, males constituted 50.1% of the total population and females 49.9%.\n\nAccording to the results of the Address-Based Population Registration System (ADNKS), the foreign population residing in our country (1) increased by 458 thousand 626 people compared to the previous year and became 1 million 792 thousand 36 people. Males constituted 49.7% of the population and females 50.3%.\n\n.\n\nTHE POPULATION GROWTH RATE WAS 12.7 PER THOUSAND\n\nThe annual population growth rate was 5.5 per thousand in 2020, compared to 12.7 per thousand in 2021.\n\n.\n\nTHE PROPORTION OF RESIDENTS IN THE PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT CENTERS WAS 93.2%\n\nThe proportion of residents in the provincial and district centers of Turkey, which was 93% in 2020, was 93.2% in 2021.

Istanbul, where 18.71% of the population of Turkey lives, was followed by Ankara with 5 million 747 thousand 325 people, Izmir with 4 million 425 thousand 789 people, Bursa with 3 million 147 thousand 818 people and Antalya with 2 million 619 thousand 832 people.\n\n.\n\nTHE PROVINCE WITH THE LEAST POPULATION WAS TUNCELI WITH 83 THOUSAND 645 PEOPLE\n\nTunceli became the province with the least population with 83 thousand 645 people. Tunceli was followed by Bayburt with 85 thousand 42 people, Ardahan with 94 thousand 932 people, Kilis with 145 thousand 826 people and Gümüşhane with 150 thousand 119 people.\n\n.\n\nTHE STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE POPULATION PYRAMID CONTINUED\n\nPopulation pyramids are defined as graphs showing the change in the age and gender structure of the population. When the population pyramids of Turkey for 2007 and 2021 are compared, it is seen that the elderly population has increased and the median age has increased due to the decrease in fertility and mortality rates.\n\n.\n\nTHE MEDIAN AGE OF THE TURKISH POPULATION HAS RISEN TO 33.1 YEARS\n\nThe median age is the age of the person who stays in the middle when the ages of the people who make up the population from the newborn baby to the oldest are sorted from small to large. The median age is also one of the important indicators used in the interpretation of the age structure of the population.\n\nThe median age in Turkey, which was 32.7 in 2020, increased to 33.1 in 2021. When examined by gender, it was found that the median age increased from 32.1 to 32.4 for men and from 33.4 to 33.8 for women.\n\n.\n\nTHE PROVINCE WITH THE HIGHEST MEDIAN AGE WAS SINOP, AND THE PROVINCE WITH THE LOWEST WAS ŞANLIURFA\n\nLooking at the distribution of median age by province, it was seen that Sinop had the highest median age value with 41.8. Sinop was followed by Kastamonu with 41.2, Balıkesir and Giresun with 41. On the other hand, Şanlıurfa had the lowest median age with 20.6 years. Şanlıurfa was followed by Şırnak with 21.6 and Siirt with 22.7.\n\n.\n\nTHE PROVINCE WITH THE HIGHEST MEDIAN AGE IN MEN AND WOMEN WAS SINOP\n\nWhen the distribution of the median age by province and gender was examined, Sinop had the highest median age with 40.7 for men, while Şanlıurfa had the lowest median age with 20.1. Sinop with 42.9% of women was again the province with the highest median age value, while Sanliurfa was the province with the lowest median age value with 21.1.\n\n.\n\nTHE PROPORTION OF THE WORKING-AGE POPULATION WAS 67.9%\n\nThe proportion of the population in the 15-64 age group defined as working age was 66.5% in 2007 and 67.9% in 2021. On the other hand, the proportion of the population in the 0-14 age group defined as the child age group decreased from 26.4% to 22.4%, while the proportion of the population aged 65 and over increased from 7.1% to 9.7%.\n\n.\n\nTHE TOTAL AGE DEPENDENCE RATE DECREASED\n\nThe total age dependence rate, which shows the number of children and elderly people per working-age individual, fell from 47.7% in 2020 to 47.4% in 2021.\n\nThe child dependency ratio, which refers to the number of children per economically active individual, decreased from 33.7% to 33%, while the elderly dependency ratio, which measures the number of elderly individuals per working individual, increased from 14.1% to 14.3%. In other words, in Turkey, in 2021, every 100 people of working age are caring for 33 children and 14.3 elderly people.\n\n.\n\n110 PEOPLE PER SQUARE KILOMETER FELL IN TURKEY, WHILE 3 THOUSAND 49 PEOPLE FELL IN ISTANBUL\n\nThe “number of people per square kilometer”, defined as the population density, increased by 1 person to 110 people in Turkey compared to 2020. Istanbul has become our city with the highest population density with 3 thousand 49 people per square kilometer. After Istanbul, Kocaeli with 563 people and Izmir with 368 people were the provinces with the highest population density.\n\nOn the other hand, the province with the lowest population density was Tunceli with 11 people per square kilometer, as in the previous year. Tunceli was followed by Ardahan and Erzincan provinces with 20 people.\n\nThe population density of Konya, which ranked first in terms of population measurement, was 59, and the population density of Yalova, which has the smallest face measurement, was 344."
