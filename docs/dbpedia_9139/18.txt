Azdavay District is a district of the Kastamonu Province of Turkey. Its seat is the town of Azdavay.[1] Its area is 759 km2,[2] and its population is 7,290 (2021).[3] It is bounded by Cide District to the north, Daday District to the south, Pınarbaşı District to the west, Küre District to the east and İnebolu District to the northeast. Due to the low level economic activity in the district, migration to bigger provinces such as Istanbul is prevalent, resulting in population decrease. In consequence, some rural areas are completely deserted, and some schools closed.
