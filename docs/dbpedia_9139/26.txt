Objectives: This study aims to identify the bone mineral density (BMD) values and the prevalence of osteoporosis (OP) in Turkish women living in Kastamonu within the purpose of contributing to Turkish database and to explore whether the characteristics of the regional climate and demographics in different provinces of Turkey are risk factors, comparing our results with similar studies.

Patients and methods: Between January 2009 and December 2011, 778 of 2018 subjects who were admitted to the healthcare centers equipped with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) device in Kastamonu and met the inclusion criteria were included. The results of BMD were compared with the studies performed by Lunar DXA in two different provinces. The mean regional data obtained from the Turkish State Meteorological Service (1975-2010) and Turkish Statistical Institute (2009-2011) were used in the comparison of climate and demographic characteristics. The prevalence of OP was compared with those obtained from the FRACTURK study.

Results: The mean vertebral and femoral BMD values in all cases were lower than the values recorded in two geographical regions (Elazığ-İstanbul), indicating a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). The mean temperature and duration of sunbathing in Kastamonu remained significantly lower than these two provinces for many years (p<0.05). The women population at the age of >50 and the old age dependency ratio were significantly higher in Kastamonu, compared to these provinces (p<0.05). The mean femoral BMD values of these cases >50 were significantly lower, suggesting a significant difference compared to the results obtained from FRACTURK study. The prevalence of OP (19.6%) was significantly higher than the FRACTURK study (p<0.05).
