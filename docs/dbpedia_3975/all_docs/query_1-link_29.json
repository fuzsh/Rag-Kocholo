        "text": "Dear Mr. President:\n\nBecause of my own deep personal interest in ensuring that everything possible is being done to expedite the campaign against cancer, I take this opportunity to warmly commend the Government of France for its generous contribution of new modern facilities to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. This action on the part of the French Government is impressive evidence of its dedication to a cause in which all nations can join--the search for effective cures to the dread disease of cancer.\n\nThe work of the International Agency for Research on Cancer during its relatively brief existence since 1965 has received wide recognition among the world leaders in cancer research. Intensive international efforts such as this are urgently needed to contribute vital new knowledge in this critical field.\n\nOur own National Cancer Act of 1971 emphasizes the importance of supporting international programs as an essential component of the Cancer Study Program of the United States. Success in this endeavor depends on a universal sharing of knowledge and collaborative attacks on cancer without regard to national boundaries or political divisions.\n\nThe United States is proud to be a charter member of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. I pledge the strong and continuing support of my country to its important work. We are grateful to the Government of France for making it possible for the staff to have excellent physical facilities in which to conduct their urgently needed studies.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRICHARD NIXON"
