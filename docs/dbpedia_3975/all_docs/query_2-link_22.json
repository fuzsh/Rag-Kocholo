        "text": "The presidential hopes of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur dimmed sharply Thursday as prominent center-right politicians rallied to the Gaullist front-runner, Jacques Chirac, and fresh evidence surfaced tarnishing Mr. Balladur's image as a scrupulous public servant.\n\nDisclosures about his spectacular profits through dealings with GSI, a company where he worked while not in the government but still in Parliament, have hurt Mr. Balladur, partly because he only disclosed them with poor grace. After stonewalling for weeks, he has promised full financial disclosure after his hand was forced by revelations in Le Canard Enchaîné, an investigative paper.\n\nMr. Balladur has denied any wrongdoing. But the big profits will reinforce impressions that he is remote from ordinary people's concerns at a time of recession and unemployment.\n\nThe gains fit uncomfortably with Mr. Balladur's effort to promote his dedication to public service and his reputation as a man whose management skills are balanced by strong social compassion and moral conscience.\n\nIn a further sign of Mr. Balladur's fading political fortunes, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, normally an aggressive critic of the Chirac camp, has suddenly adopted a conciliatory tone about conservative reconciliation after the first round of voting in late April.\n\nMr. Pasqua seemed to be saying that the duel between Mr. Balladur and Mr. Chirac will eliminate one of them, leaving the winner to carry the conservative colors in a runoff against a Socialist, Lionel Jospin.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
