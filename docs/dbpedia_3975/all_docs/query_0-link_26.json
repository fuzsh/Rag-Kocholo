        "text": "Mathieu Lemay\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n5 min read\n\n·\n\nJun 30, 2024\n\n--\n\nThe power relationship between President Emmanuel Macron and the future Prime Minister is at stake for the National Assembly elections on June 30th and July 7th in France. It is the cohabitation scenario that many French and international politicians and French and international political observers fear: the National Rally would likely win the majority or the most seats in the National Assembly. Thus, the Prime Minister would be Jordan Bardella because the President has the power to nominate the Prime Minister from the party with the majority or the most seats in the National Assembly.\n\nIn the post The Ten Commandments and the First Amendment, I wrote that one way to understand political events is to understand what is at issue. Another way to make sense of political events is to know how politics works in a given country. When you understand the game, you understand past and present events and can make an educated guess of what might happen in the future.\n\nAfter President Macron’s European party, Renew, lost to Marine Le Pen’s and Jordan Bardella’s National Rally during the European Parliament elections held in early June, he decided to call snap parliamentary elections, which means that there will be parliamentary elections before the end of the parliamentary session, which was scheduled in 2027.\n\nArticle 12 of the French Constitution makes possible the dissolution of the National Assembly by the President. It is the sixth time since the creation of the Fifth Republic that a French President dissolves the National Assembly. Here’s a summary of the last five dissolutions: (Source: Le Monde)\n\nIn 1962, de Gaulle dissolved the Assemblée Nationale after a motion of no confidence toppled Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. Gaullist MPs emerged victorious, with 32% of the vote and an absolute majority of 230 seats, reinstating their legitimacy.\n\nIn 1968, de Gaulle invoked Article 12 of the Constitution a second time, following the protests and strikes of May 1968. He sought to address the discontent expressed in the streets by asking for a new mandate through early elections. His side won the early elections by a wide margin, with 46% of the vote.\n\nIn 1981, as soon as he was elected president, the Socialist Francois Mitterrand dissolved the Assemblée in order to secure a majority for the left. The gamble paid off: his majority won 54.37% of the vote, becoming by far the strongest force in the Assemblée Nationale with 333 seats.\n\nIn 1988, Mitterrand, who had just been re-elected, decided to call early elections to put an end to the “cohabitation” that started in 1986. Faced with a stronger right-wing opposition than seven years earlier, he introduced proportional representation to divide the opposition. His side won a narrow relative majority, with 46.66% of the vote and 277 seats, against 270 for the Gaullist right.\n\nIn 1997, two years after being elected president, Jacques Chirac took the gamble of strengthening his majority in order to govern more freely. He dissolved the Assemblée Nationale, but the left-wing coalition beat the odds and won with 38.05% of the vote and 225 seats for the Socialists. The election led to a new “cohabitation”, with the appointment of Socialist Lionel Jospin as prime minister.\n\nUnder this constitutional arrangement, there are two possible constitutional scenarios: unified government, which means that the President and the Prime Minister come from the same party and a divided government or, in French, cohabitation. It means that the President comes from one party and the Prime Minister from another.\n\nUnder a unified government, the power relationship between the President and the Prime Minister swings toward the President. He/she decides the policy agenda and the Prime Minister implements the policies.\n\nUnder a divided government, the power relationship swings toward the Prime Minister and the National Assembly. So far, it has happened three times since the creation of the Fifth Republic:\n\n1986–1988\n\nPresident: Francois Mitterrand (socialist)\n\nPrime Minister: Jacques Chirac (conservative)\n\n1993–1995\n\nPresident: Francois Mitterrand (socialist)\n\nPrime Minister: Edouard Balladur (conservative)\n\n1993–1995\n\nPresident: Jacques Chirac (conservative)\n\nPrime Minister: Lionel Jospin (socialist)\n\nAs Lili Pateman and Romain Geoffroy write in their article What’s a cohabitation in French politics and what are the precedents?:\n\n“In the event of a cohabitation, power clearly lies in the relationship between the prime minister and the Assemblée Nationale,” said Dominique Rousseau, a professor at the Université Paris-1-Panthéon-Sorbonne.\n\nIn these power-sharing situations, the president has a more secondary role. His own powers are limited.\n\nRegarding defence and foreign affairs, they write:\n\n“This is the ambiguity of our 1958 constitution,” said Rousseau. “It reflects the opposing influences of Michel Debré [first prime minister of the Fifth Republic], who wanted a strong prime minister based on the British parliamentary model, and Charles de Gaulle, who wanted to give more weight to the president.” This ambiguity obliges the prime minister and the president to reach a certain understanding. This is why, during the three cohabitations, it was customary to choose defense and foreign affairs ministers who appealed to both men in power, in order to avoid frictions. “In the past, there were consensus in these areas, but today there are real differences over the role of the European Union or the war in Ukraine, particularly between Emmanuel Macron and the Rassemblement National [far-right]. This seems much more unstable and is likely to pose problems in the event of cohabitations,” said the constitutionalist."
