        "text": "Although Georges Pompidou, his, admirers and his detractors often asserted that he wet Charles de Gaulle's chosen sue. cessor as President of France, in fact he was not.\n\nIt is true that Mr. Pompidou was for many years trusted de Gaulle protégé; that de Gaulle, desirous of having as his Premier someone he could be sure would not vie for the spotlight, kept Mr. Pompidou in that position through most of his presidency; and that, eventually, Mr. Pompidou became President with the support or the Gaullist party.\n\nBut since de Gaulle did not think in terms of political dynasties, and believed that France produced a true leader only once every half century, he is said to have viewed Mr. Pompidou as only one of many possible caretakers who could govern until France's next truly great man emerged.\n\nAs the second President of the Fifth Republic, Mr. Pompidou, while carefully trying to confirm himself as de Gaulle's heir, demonstrated that he was much more cautious politically than his predecessor, advancing and retreating in various directions with a wary eye on the responses and effectiveness of his actions.\n\nHe seemed to be more pragmatic than de Gaulle in his decision‐making, and at the same time less powerful in his ability to impose a French will in international affairs. He had to compromise in ways in which de Gaulle would not have done, such as in international monetary policy, trade negotiations within the Common Market and, reforms in agricultural policies.\n\nA Frequent Criticism\n\nA frequent criticism of Mr. Pompidou was that he did not seem to have any particular concept or policy of his own, either in domestic or foreign affairs, but was content to be one of those leaders whose main goal is to stay in the lead.\n\nGeorges Jean Raymond Pompidou was a self‐made man, the classic example of the French meritocracy system that goes back to Napoleon, the poor but brilliant boy of modest origins who rises through “les grandes écoles” —the élitist advanced schools —to become a part of the governing Establishment.\n\nHe was born July 5, 1911, in the village of Montboudif, in the mountainous Auvergne region in south‐central France. Although his paternal grandfather was a peasant farmer, Mr. Pompidou's father, Léon, was able to break away from the land and become a teacher and later a professor of Spanish at the University of Clermont.\n\nAt the Lycée d'Albi and the Lycée Louis le‐Grand in Paris, where he received his secondary education, young Georges was an exceptional pupil. He won first prize in the Concours Général, the élite competition for entrance into France's finest college‐level schools.\n\nAward ‘With Regret’\n\nHe was thus able to choose for his higher education the Ecole Normale Supérieure, which has produced many of France's leading teachers in the humanities. He breezed through, winning first place in Greek and graduating at the head of his class. “We had no choice but to award you this, place, but it is with great regret,” the examining board informed him. “Of all the normaligns, you have worked the least.”\n\nThis was probably true, for Mr. Pompidou relished his reputation, in those days, as dandy and boulevardier. He did devote a few serious moments to a flirtation with Socialism, but a visit to Germany that included attendance at a mammoth Hitler rally disillusioned him, he said years later, about political parties. The visit also convinced him that his own Socialist party was much too mild an organization to stand up to the menace of Nazism. He said he tore up his party card upon his return.\n\nAfter graduating as a normalien, Mr. Pompidou went on to the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques, which awarded him a diploma in administration.\n\nIn 1935 he began his teaching career in Marseilles as professor of literature, Greek and Latin in a state high school. That same year he met and married Claude Cahour, the blond daughter of a wellto‐do, free‐thinking Breton physician. They were to have a son, Alain, now a physician.\n\nMr. Pompidou was conscripted in 1939, but his military service in World War II was short‐lived and undistinguished. After France fell to the Germans, he returned to teach at the Lycée enri IV in Paris, whose staff he had joined shortly before he was drafted.\n\nRole During Occupation\n\nIn later years, Frenchmen who said they had been part of the Resistance movement were often resentful of Mr. Pompidou, who they believed simply sat out the Occupation. This apparently pained him considerably, and, although he seldom mentioned it, he permitted an adulatory profile of himself distributed in this country by the French Embassy to categorically state.\n\n“Demobilized in August, 1940... he quickly contacted the Resistance. Claude and Georges Pompidou sheltered many people sought by the Germans; on occasion they acted as liaison agents. In his school Georges Pompidou sometimes engaged in imprudent propaganda, to such an extent that in early July, 1944, [he was warned] that he might be arrested ...”\n\nA less hagiographically inclined biographer, however, reported that the best evidence; that he could find that Mr. Pompidou was actively antiOccupation was his refusal to sit anywhere lower than the second balcony at the Comédie Française, in order to avoid mixing with German officers.\n\nMr. Pompidou is said to have gotten his first glimpse of de Gaulle in August, 1944, when the general proceeded triumphantly down the ChampsElysées. Soon after, he wrote to his old friend and fellow student René Brouillet then on de Gaulle's staff, asking for a job.\n\nAs it happened, the general needed someone, bright and literate to write, reports, and he gave Mr. Pompidou a modest position on his staff. Mr. Pompidou apparently won de Gaulle's, favor, and a year later he was appointed to the staff of the Council of State, as an administrator in the disputes section.\n\nDuring the period from January, 1946, when de Gaulle resigned as President of the provisional government, and June, 1958, when he returned to power, Mr. Pompidou, was a trusted aide. He helped the general with his memoirs, collecting documents and archive materials and even negotiating with the publishers. He also helped the de Gaulles finance a foundation in memory of their daughter, Anne, who died at the age of 20.\n\nAided i n Finan cial Matters\n\nAlthough Mr. Pompidou did not formally join the Gaullist Rally, he served in the nineteen‐fifties as a “back‐room” leader, and is said to have contributed largely to straightening out the Gaullists' financial problems. In so doing, he attracted the admiring notice of Rena Fallon, a director of the Rothschild bank, whop ersuaded. Guy de Rothschild to hire Mr. Pompidou in 1954.\n\nThe hard‐working Mr. Pompidou plunged with zest into his new undertaking, which was to help rouse the Rothschild empire out of the torpor into which it had sunk during the war years. He traveled widely, to Senegal, Gabon, Guinea and other African ter‐� ritories, compiling reports on investment opportunities for, the Rothschilds. In less than two years he became director general of the banking house and second in command to Guy, de Rothschild himself.\n\nWhile serving the Rothschilds, Mr. Pompidou did not neglect de Gaulle, and when the general emerged from enforced retirement to become Premier in June, 1958, during a crisis in Algeria, he made Mr. Pompidou his chief of cabinet. As such, he was one of the few men close to de Gaulle privileged to dispute the general's decisions, but he did so, Mr. Pompidou said years later, “ever so gently.”\n\nIn the hectic six months during which he was on leave from the bank, Mr. Pompidou served de Gaulle through the last days of the Fourth Republic, helping to fashion the new Constitution and the financial recovery plan of Antoine Pinay.\n\nOn the day in January, 1959, when he took office as the first President of the new Fifth Republic, de Gaulle took another of his famous rides down the Champs‐Elysées. At his side was Mr. Pompidou, and it was probably the first time the public got a glimpse of the man who had become de Gaulle's trusted adviser.\n\nA Delicate Mission\n\nMr. Pompidou soon returned to the bank, but de Gaulle, in order to keep him available to his Government, appointed him a member of the Constitutional Council, the body that, under the new Constitution, determined the legality of legislation.\n\nIn 1961, when the Algerian drama was building to a climax, de Gaulle entrusted Mr. Pompidou with the delicate mission of establishing secret contact in Switzerland with representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Front. “I shall send Pompidou,” de Gaulle said. “He will be my signature.” The secret talks, during which Mr. Pompidou pressed for the rights of the French in Algeria, eventually led to the Evian Conference and Algerian independence.\n\nThe referendum on Algerian independence, a triumph for de Gaulle, was held on April 8, 1962. The following day Mr. Pompidou was appointed Premier, succeeding Michel Debré, who had been abruptly dismissed.\n\nThus, at the age of 50, Mr. Pompidou, the scholar, the writer, the schoolteacher, the financier, the behind thescenes diplomat, became a politician. There was criticism then, and it continued, that he had never been elected to office, and to the effect that he was a “technician” rather than a seasoned political animal.\n\nThe label riled him. “There are three ways to ruin,” he said, “and they are women, gambling and being a technician. Women are agreeable, and, gambling is quick. But being a technician is surest.”\n\nMr. Pompidou's appointment was also criticized because of his banking connections. “The Rothschilds' man,” as the leftist press dubbed him, was never fully able to free himself of that yoke.\n\nThis political stigma was to follow Mr. Pompidou into the Elysée Palace. After he became President, the standard joke was that the initials “RF” on the portals of the palace stood not for “Republique Française,” but for “Rothschild Frères.”\n\nAs Premier, Mr. Pompidou chose not to live in the H6tel Matignon, where the head of the French Government normally lives. He preferred his rented apartment on the Ile Saint‐Louis, overlooking the Seine, and his country home at Orvilliiers, in the Yvelines.\n\nIn de Gaulle's Shadow\n\nThrough most of his years as Premier, Mr. Pompidou was, content to remain in the shadow of the giant de Gaulle, which was precisely how the President wanted things to be. Generally, de Gaulle handled major issues and higher diplomacy, while the Premier concentrated on day‐to‐day administrative matters and the economy. For example, Mr. Pompidou pushed for France's building of the supersonic Concorde jet not only for the prestige of it, but also because development of the Concorde would provide work for thou sands of people for several years.\n\nBy 1967, Mr. Pompidou —nicknamed “Pompom” by then —had developed from his postune of “I'm just a simple guy” into a forceful administrator and debater. He had also, by then, taken charge of the apparatus of the Gaullist part, and was being recognized increasingly as an important political figure.\n\nThe student and worker revolt of 1968 thrust Mr. Pompidou forward as a vigorous, free‐wheeling, sure‐footed and tough leader. “The events of May,” as the French now delicately call them, also led to his downfall as Premier.\n\nStrikes across the country, student demonstrations and clashes between the police and the dissidents had nearly prostrated France by mid‐May of that year. While de Gaulle receded into the background, Mr. Pompidou repeatedly went on television to cajole and threaten and conciliate his fellow countrymen.\n\nA Secret Flight\n\nAt the height of the crisis, de Gaulle disappeared. Mr. Pompidou remained unflappable through the several hours his whereabouts were unknown. It turned out that the Gaulle had flown to a French Army base in West Germany. Why he went on this secret trip has never been revealed, but speculation was that he sought to assure himself of Army support in case there was an attempt at revolution. Many observers looked upon the trip as a panicky abandonment of power.\n\nAfter Mr. Pompidou had engineered the Grenelle agreements that guaranteed the workers a wage increase of almost 15 per cent and included a, sizable rise in the guaranteed annual wage, he undertook the always delicate task of persuading de Gaulle to change his mind.\n\nThe general had announced a referendum, his favorite device to reassert his authority. Mr. Pompidou dissuaded him, and convinced him that, instead, Parliament should be dissolved and new elections held. Mr. Pompidou ran the election campaign, producing an overwhelming victory and reassertion of Gaullist power.\n\nA few days later, de Gaulle asked for Mr. Pompidou's resignation, perhaps out of jealousy, or fear that Mr. Pompidou was challenging his power, or perhaps in the resentment that is often the interest paid on a debt of gratitude. Ousted as Premier, Mr. Pompidou was further forbidden to seek leadership of the Gaullist' party.\n\nFor a time Mr. Pompidou bore his rejection in silence, but in January, 1969, on a visit to Rome, he told newsmen, “Everyone knows that I'll probably be a candidate the day there is a presidential election.” The remark provoked huge headlines, not to mention de Gaulle's wrath, He announced he intended, to stay in office until the end of his term in 1972.\n\nRejected by Voters\n\nThis was not to be the case, however. Turning once again to his vote‐of‐confidence weapon of a referendum, de Gaulle became the victim of a backfire. On April 27, 1969, the voters turned down a set of de Gaulle proposals for reform of the Senate and regional reorganization, and so, true to his word, the general resigned.\n\nIn the presidential election that ensued, Mr. Pompidou campaigned on a promise of “continuity and openness.” He rallied solid Gaullist backing and benefited from division on the left, and on June 15, 1969, was easily elected. He took office five days later, at the age of 57.\n\nBy mid‐1973, however he had put on at least 20 pounds his face was jowly, his eyes were watery and his movements appeared painful and ponderous. His countryymen were alarmed, but the Elysée Palace insisted that the President was merely in need of a rest, and denied rumors that he was afflicted by cancer.\n\nHis precarious health did not deter Mr. Pompidou from indulging in his celebrated with when he and President Nixor held a summit meeting in Iceland in June of 1973. Com meeting on the suggestion that little had come out of the two leaders' discussions, Mr. Pompidou said: “These talks were more like conception than delivery. And, after all, conception is more pleasurable than delivery.”\n\nThe witticism was typical of Mr. Pompidou. On another occasion, President Kennedy's 1961 state visit to Paris, Mr. Pompidou, after being informed that Mr. Kennedy was adding Vienna to his itinerary, said, “My impression is that the President's itinerary must have been arranged not by the State Department but by American Express.”\n\nMr. Pompidou liked to recall that he once started to write a novel about “Paris intellectuals —I suppose you'd have to call that a comic novel.” He did, as a matter of fact, enjoy the company of intellectuals, writers, poets and painters. He acquired modern paintings by artists such as Max Ernst and Nicholas de Stael, and was particularly fond of a sculpture by Bans Arp.\n\nMr. Pompidou's devotion to and knowledge of the classics was well known. He published studies of Racine's “Brittanius” and of the works of Hippolyte Taine, and in 1961 edited an anthology of French poetry. A favorite pastime was reading and reciting the poems of Baudelaire."
