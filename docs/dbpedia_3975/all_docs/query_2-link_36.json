        "text": "Cuba\n\nQ. Mr. President, are you willing to talk to the Cubans about improving relations?\n\nThe President. I'm here with the Prime Minister of France. [Laughter]\n\nQ. [Inaudible]—French about the Blair House agreement, Mr. President?\n\nQ. [Inaudible]—Cubans' announcement today that they'd like to talk about reparations?\n\nThe President. I don't have any reaction at this time.\n\nTrade Negotiations\n\nQ. Do you think you can find common ground with the French about Blair House, sir? About the Blair House agreement?\n\nThe President. Well, I was very pleased to see that the oilseeds portion will go forward. But I think the rest of it we need to talk about. The United States supports the Blair House agreement.\n\n[At this point, one group of reporters left the room, and another group entered.]\n\nPresident's Schedule\n\nQ. Mr. President, are you going to France anytime in the near future?\n\nThe President. I wish I could go in the very near future, but I suppose that depends on when I can travel again. Of course, I have to go to the G-7 meeting in Tokyo, and that will be my first trip out of the country except for the brief visit to Vancouver with President Yeltsin. I'd very much like to go back. I haven't been in a long time."
