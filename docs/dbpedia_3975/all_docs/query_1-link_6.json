        "text": "Georges Pompidou’s presidency had the aura of inevitability.1 His predecessor clearly envisioned his successor’s attributes: “When I am gone France should have someone who is known throughout the world, who is morally respected, a man of intellectual prestige. Above all he should be a man who is not the slave of any particular party or political ideology.”2 De Gaulle believed that he had found and nurtured the best man for the job. For many years, Pompidou was called his dauphin, or successor. Pompidou recalled that de Gaulle “repeatedly told me I must follow him as president of the republic.”3 As for policies, de Gaulle gave plenty of wiggle room to whoever replaced him. In 1965, he said, “My successor will not do as I did. He’ll do as he pleases. He’ll do the best he can. He won’t do the same things.”4"
