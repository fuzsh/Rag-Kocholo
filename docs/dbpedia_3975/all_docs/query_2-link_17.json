        "text": "For the first time, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's regal progress to the presidency has started to seem less than inevitable.\n\nMr. Balladur remains the overwhelming favorite to win in the April and May elections. But in one of those moments that can seem to last forever in politics, his lead has suddenly started melting in the polls. That downturn is liable to accelerate after some mishaps that pointed to his potential vulnerabilities.\n\nMr. Balladur has positioned himself as a paternal figure, above the fray, but now French voters can hope that he will be forced into the arena and tackle his opponents instead of ignoring them. That would break the frozen political landscape that has been dominated by the assumption that Mr. Balladur has an unbeatable lead.\n\nThe most intriguing possibility, French analysts said Thursday, is that the weakening of support for Mr. Balladur could revitalize the campaign of his main conservative rival, Jacques Chirac.\n\nThe leftist candidate, Lionel Jospin, faces the daunting problem of surmounting the unpopular legacy of 14 years of mainly Socialist governance. Although Mr. Jospin has surged in the polls, he must contend with an unfavorable political climate in which two-thirds of French voters describe themselves as conservative.\n\nThe prime minister had been proceeding calmly to the nation's top job, but then questions about his lock on the vote emerged suddenly as his campaign image turned out to have problems, exposing him to resentment about the French government in general.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
