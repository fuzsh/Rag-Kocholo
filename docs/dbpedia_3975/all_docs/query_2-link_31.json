Serving in the Office of Radio and Television Broadcasting during the early 1960s, he became policy advisor on Georges Pompidou staff, and later Finance minister under Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister under François Mitterrand. Balladur ran for President in 1995, but his involvement in a phone-tapping scandal and other alleged improprieties caused him to place third, behind Lionel Jospin and the victor, his former boss Jacques Chirac.
