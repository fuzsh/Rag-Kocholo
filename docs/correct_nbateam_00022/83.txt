Elton Brand did not make many of his shots, but he hit the one that counted most as his 15-foot baseline jumper in the final minute lifted Philadelphia to a 89-88 win over the Los Angeles Clippers.

Brand shot only 6-of-18 against his former team, but he tied Thaddeus Young with a team high 17 points as all five 76ers starters finished in double figures.

Al Thornton led all scorers with 22 points for Los Angeles who dropped to 2-10 on the season. Philadelphia evened their record at 6-6 with their fourth win in five games.
