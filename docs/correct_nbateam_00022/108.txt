Elton Brand is an American former professional basketball player and general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After playing college basketball for Duke, he was selected with the first overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls, and later played for the Philadelphia 76ers, the Los Angeles Clippers, Dallas Mavericks and Atlanta Hawks. He was a two-time NBA All Star and an All-NBA Second Team selection in 2006.

Early in his career, Brand established himself as one of the top power forwards of the NBA. He holds career averages of 16.6 points, 8.8 rebounds (3.3 being offensive rebounds) and 1.8 blocks per game in 1,005 career games. Brand used his wide body and surprising athleticism for a man his weight in order to out-muscle his opponents. A large wingspan also allowed him to be a proficient shot-blocker.
