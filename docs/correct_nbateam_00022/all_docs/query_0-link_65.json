Mandatory Credit: Thomas B. Shea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are far from being one of the NBA’s greatest franchises. Until Chris Paul and Blake Griffin arrived to carry them to contention, the Clippers have been one of the worst. From their days as the Braves in Buffalo to their move to L.A., the Clippers had seven measly trips to the playoffs in the 41 years before Paul arrived. They were that bad. However, they haven’t been without talent, especially when it comes to some of their great big men.\n\nOf course, the high-flying duo of Griffin and DeAndre Jordan spring to mind as the pair combining with Paul to make the Clippers one of the best teams in the NBA right now. They’ve been a dominant pairing for some time, and as they enter their primes, they still have so much left to give the franchise.\n\nThere are others, though. Dating back to the days of the Braves in the 1970s, the San Diego Clippers in the late ’70s and early ’80s, right until the 2016 Los Angeles Clippers, there are plenty of notable names to compare and rank.\n\nProbably more so than any other position, the Clippers’ power forwards and centers make up many of their team legends.\n\nSo, let’s get straight to it and work our way to the top.\n\n10th place – Swen Nater (C)\n\nClippers per game averages: 31.8 minutes, 13.5 points, 12 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 0.5 steals, 0.5 blocks.\n\nClippers totals: 6 seasons (1977-78 to 1982-83), 348 games, 4,694 points, 4,168 rebounds, 819 assists, 179 steals, 168 blocks, 54.2 field goal percentage.\n\nHonors with Clippers: 1x total rebounds per game leader (1979-80).\n\nSomeone such as Bill Walton could begin this list. He was a league MVP and NBA champion during his career with the Portland Trail Blazers before joining the San Diego Clippers in 1979, but a two-year break from injuries and constant problems with staying on the court drastically held back his time with the Clips.\n\nSo, to elect a player who was able to provide more impact and consistency thanks to both talent and good health, Swen Nater begins this list at 10th place.\n\nWhile Nater was a capable scorer and a valuable offensive contributor with his ability on the low block, it was as a rebounder that he really made his mark. First joining the franchise with the Buffalo Braves in 1977 and spending six seasons with the team, Nater was a force on the boards with 12 rebounds per game and led the league with an average of 15 in 1979-80.\n\n’79-80 was his best season, adding 13.4 points, 2.9 assists and 55.4 percent shooting to his stat line.\n\nNater is one of the better double-double machines the Clippers have ever had at their disposal, and he used his physical toughness and skill in the post to earn solid rankings in the franchise’s history.\n\nWhen Nater retired in 1984 after spending his final season with the Lakers, he finished 30th all-time among the NBA’s rebounds per game leaders (10.8) and 28th in field goal percentage (53.7). In Clippers history, he finished 2nd in total rebound percentage (20.7) and 10th in win shares (28.9).\n\n9th place – Chris Kaman (C)\n\nClippers per game averages: 29.7 minutes, 11.8 points, 8.3 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 0.5 steals, 1.4 blocks,\n\nClippers totals: 8 seasons (2003-04 to 2010-11), 493 games, 5,813 points, 4,109 rebounds, 635 assists, 238 steals, 707 blocks, 48.7 field goal percentage.\n\nHonors with Clippers: 1x All-Star (2009-10).\n\nAs one of only two All-Star centers to represent the Los Angeles Clippers in this list, Chris Kaman received the kind of honors and standout play during a couple of seasons to warrant an appearance.\n\nEven though the 34-year-old Kaman is currently a free agent, he’s always been a skilled center. Capable of playing in the post with both hands, possessing solid passing ability and a smooth mid-range game, he’s used his offense to have his fair share of productive seasons in the NBA. His best years came with the Clippers, highlight by two seasons in particular when he was able to greatly boost his standing among the franchise’s all-time leaders.\n\nIn 2007-08, Kaman averaged 15.7 points per game and career-highs in rebounds (12.7) and blocks (2.8). During his career-high 37.2 nightly minutes, he was a vital part of a team highlighted by its frontcourt alongside Elton Brand in the pre “Lob City” era.\n\nAs for Kaman’s All-Star appearance, that came two years later in 2009-10 with a career-high 18.5 points on 49 percent shooting, 9.3 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.5 blocks.\n\n(Excuse the footage above of Kaman in a Lakers jersey, it’s the best footage I could find to showcase his ability.)\n\nKaman left L.A. for New Orleans along with Al-Farouq Aminu and Eric Gordon in the 2011 Chris Paul trade, and finished 6th in Clippers history in minutes played (14,661), 6th in total rebounds (4,109) and just outside of the top 10 in total points (5,813).\n\n8th place – Benoit Benjamin (C)\n\nClippers per game averages: 31.3 minutes, 13.3 points, 8.7 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 0.8 steals, 2.8 blocks.\n\nClippers totals: 6 seasons (1985-86 to 1990-91), 406 games, 5,405 points, 3,538 rebounds, 776 assists, 316 steals, 1,114 blocks, 50.1 field goal percentage.\n\nHonors with Clippers: None.\n\nNow, it’s time to stray away from Kaman’s offensive skill and address the leading shot blocker in Los Angeles Clippers history: Benoit Benjamin.\n\nUsing his solid mobility, length and instincts, Benjamin asserted himself as a strong rim protector during his six seasons in L.A. Earning the starting center spot over the course of his rookie season, he didn’t wait long to start making an impact, averaging 2.6 blocks in 26.4 minutes per game in his first year.\n\nFrom that moment on, similar block numbers highlighted Benjamin’s performance. By his third season, he averaged 3.4 per game, and gradually improved his efficiency as a scorer to the point where he was able to average a career-high 16.4 points per game on 54.1 percent shooting in 1988-89.\n\nEven though he was never a dominant star or led the Clippers to the playoffs, he was productive nonetheless.\n\nBenjamin ranks 1st in team history in blocks per game (2.8) and 1st in total blocks (1,117). On top of that, he ranks 5th in defensive rebound percentage (23.8), 4th in block percentage (five) and 4th in defensive box plus-minus (2.7).\n\n7th place – Loy Vaught (PF)\n\nClippers per game averages: 28.1 minutes, 11.9 points, 8 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.4 blocks.\n\nClippers totals: 8 seasons (1990-91 to 1997-98), 558 games, 6,614 points, 4,471 rebounds, 607 assists, 468 steals, 211 blocks, 51.1 field goal percentage.\n\nHonors with Clippers: None.\n\nWhile Benoit Benjamin left the Los Angeles Clippers in a 1991 trade, power forward Loy Vaught started his development after joining the team as the 13th overall pick in the 1990 draft.\n\nWithout pressure to ascend to stardom right away, Vaught enjoyed the privelage of playing behind and learning from proven veteran bigs like Danny Manning and Charles Smith. Vaught adopted more of a defensive role because of his standing on the team early on, and in 19.6 minutes per game over his first three seasons, he averaged 7.5 points and 5.9 rebounds. He was rebounding at a terrific rate from the get go, with that number equating to 10.8 rebounds per 36 minutes.\n\nAt a slightly undersized 6’9″, Vaught used his athleticism and sheer energy to make up for a lack of imposing size. And as Smith was traded away in 1992, Vaught’s work paid off as his minutes increased and he earned the starting power forward spot in the 1993-94 season.\n\nFrom that moment on, Vaught expanded the range of his jumper and produced during the increased workload. Over his final five seasons as a starter with the Clippers, he averaged 14.9 points, 9.5 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game, standing out in 1994-95 with a career-high 17.5 points.\n\nUnfortunately, Vaught didn’t end his time in L.A. with the same kind of bang. Playing just 10 games in 1997-98 due to season-ending back surgery, he signed with the Detroit Pistons a year later before spending his last few years as an injury-troubled backup.\n\nBefore health betrayed him, though, Vaught climbed the ranks in Clippers history. He currently sits at 4th in games played (558), 7th in points (6,614), 3rd in total rebounds (4,471), and 8th in win shares (34.1).\n\n6th place – Bob Kauffman (PF)\n\nBraves per game averages: 33.8 minutes, 15.8 points, 9.2 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 0.5 steals, 0.2 blocks.\n\nBraves totals: 4 seasons (1970-71 to 1973-74), 306 games, 4,847 points, 3,682 rebounds, 1,429 assists, (blocks and steals only recorded in final season), 48.7 field goal percentage.\n\nHonors with Braves: 3x All-Star (1970-71 to 1972-73).\n\nAfter being traded by the Philadelphia 76ers on May 11, 1970, Bob Kauffman landed with the Braves. And once he started in Buffalo, his career couldn’t have taken much of a more dramatic leap forward.\n\nIn the previous season in 1969-70, Kauffman was playing just 12.1 minutes a night and averaging 4.3 points with the Chicago Bulls. He didn’t have a chance to really develop and his playing time had dropped from 20.2 minutes per game in his rookie season the year before. He certainly wasn’t on the rise.\n\nThen his first season with the Braves happened.\n\nMore from Clipperholics\n\nPlaying 35.6 minutes per game in 1970-71, Kauffman had a chance to show what he was capable of. He became the Braves’ first All-Star with his post play, tough rebounding, instinctive passing, and mid-range game. Averaging a career-high 20.4 points with 10.7 rebounds and 4.5 assists, Kauffman made his first of three All-Star appearances with the Braves.\n\nHis performance fell after those three years as the drafting of Bob McAdoo‘s exceptional scoring in 1972 altered the franchise, resulting in Kauffman’s playing time plummeting to 17.4 minutes with an average of 6.1 points in 1973-74 as McAdoo rose to prominence.\n\nThen, when the NBA expansion draft rolled around in May 1974, Kauffman was drafted by the New Orleans Jazz.\n\nBefore that decline, though, he was one of the best players in the Braves era and his All-Star appearances earn him a solid place in these rankings.\n\nJan 6, 2016; Winston-Salem, NC, USA; Wake Forest Demon Deacons head coach Danny Manning yells out in the first half against the Duke Blue Devils at Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Duke defeated Wake Forest 91-75. Mandatory Credit: Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports\n\n5th place – Danny Manning (PF)\n\nClippers per game averages: 34 minutes, 19.1 points, 6.4 rebounds, 3 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.1 blocks.\n\nClippers totals: 5 full seasons (1988-89 to the start of 1993-94), 373 games, 7,120 points, 2,399 rebounds, 1,132 assists, 548 steals, 406 blocks, 51.8 field goal percentage, 17.9 PER.\n\nHonors with Clippers: 2x All-Star (1992-93 and 1993-94).\n\nDanny Manning became one of several big men taken in the first few picks of the draft in an attempt to resurrect the Los Angeles Clippers from the depths of the NBA. Coming off an exceptional final year in college at Kansas in 1998, averaging 24.8 points per game on 58.3 percent shooting (27.1 in the NCAA tournament), winning the John R. Wooden Award and becoming national champion and the NCAA Final Four’s Most Outstanding Player.\n\nIt was an incredible college career, and Manning was taken No. 1 overall by the struggling Clippers because of it.\n\nWhile the wins didn’t come immediately, Manning still helped right away. He scored 16.7 points per game on 49.4 percent shooting as a rookie, adding 6.6 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.7 steals and a block. He wasn’t an immediate All-Star like Blake Griffin, but Manning went on to earn his spot as a top-five big man in Clippers history.\n\nFollowing a few more impressive scoring seasons, Manning broke through to the All-Star game in 1992-93 with a career-high 22.8 points per game. As his impact rose, so did the team’s win total. He led the Los Angeles Clippers to their first two playoff trips in 1992 and 1993, but both times they were eliminated in the first round.\n\nManning left the Clippers in a trade for Dominique Wilkins in February of 1994 (who stayed for only 27 games) after becoming disgruntled with his time in L.A.\n\n“I’m relieved that it’s finally over,” Manning said in an interview with TNT. “And I’m just glad I know where I’m going to be for the next few months.”\n\nThe messy end can’t be ignored with Manning. If he was content, maybe he and the Clippers could have found more success together and possibly even earned themselves a playoff series win or two. Who knows. It’s now no more than a footnote in the troubled tales of the Clippers’ past.\n\nEven still, Manning put together quite the career. He ranks 6th for the Clippers in points (7,120), 10th in steals per game (1.5) and 9th in win shares (31).\n\nAug 21, 2016; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; USA center DeAndre Jordan (6) celebrates winning the gold medal in the men’s gold game during the during the Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games at Carioca Arena 1. Mandatory Credit: RVR Photos-USA TODAY Sports\n\n4th place – DeAndre Jordan (C)\n\nClippers per game averages: 27.1 minutes, 8.7 points, 9.6 rebounds, 0.6 assists, 0.6 steals,1.8 blocks.\n\nClippers totals: 8 seasons (2008-09 to now), 592 games, 5,122 points, 5,703, 344 assists, 358 steals, 1,072 blocks, 67 field goal percentage.\n\nHonors with Clippers: 1x All-NBA 1st team (2015-16), 1x All-NBA 3rd team (2014-15), 2x All-Defensive 1st team (2014-15 and 2015-16), 4x field goal percentage leader 2012-13 to 2015-16), 2x total rebounds per game leader (2013-14 and 2014-15).\n\nDeAndre Jordan was drafted in completely different circumstances to Danny Manning. Rather than being a No. 1 overall pick challenged by weighty expectations, Jordan was taken 35th overall in the 2008 draft. A freakish athletic specimen, but a work in progress as a basketball player.\n\nIn his rookie season, Jordan was playing 14.5 minutes a night off the bench. But as his potential became clear, he moved into a starting role by his third season, gradually establishing himself as more of a force as each year went by.\n\nWhile his skill set may be fairly limited and that’s certainly the case for his offensive game, Jordan still excels in a lot of areas. He’s one of the most athletic centers the league has ever seen, he’s a stellar rim protector and continually improving defender, a fierce rebounder, and he’s now the most unstoppable pick-and-roll threat in the game.\n\nThanks to such physical gifts to work from and continued development over the last few years, Jordan has risen to the top of the league. And after receiving acknowledgment of that this season after the Clippers’ success in Blake Griffin’s absence, Jordan received All-NBA First Team honors.\n\nThe last three years has really been the peak of Jordan’s rise to athletic power. Leading the league twice in rebounds per game in 2013-14 and 2014-15, making the All-Defensive First Team the last two seasons, and making a leap from the All-NBA Third Team in 2014-15 to the First Team this year, Jordan is in his prime.\n\nHe’s a dominant force, and he’s getting better.\n\nTo think where he’ll rank in Los Angeles Clippers history is a daunting thought for anyone else who doesn’t want to be completely overshadowed. Right now, Jordan ranks 1st in field goal percentage (67, 6.1 percent ahead of 2nd place), 1st in offensive rebounds (1,808) and defensive rebounds (3,895), placing him 993 total rebounds ahead of 2nd place Elton Brand.\n\nOn top of that, Jordan is also 2nd in blocks (1,072), 1st in defensive win shares (26.9) and 3rd in total win shares (55.1).\n\nJan 26, 2016; Philadelphia, PA, USA; Philadelphia 76ers forward Elton Brand (42) prior to action against the Phoenix Suns at Wells Fargo Center. The Philadelphia 76ers won 113-103. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports\n\n3rd place – Elton Brand (PF)\n\nClippers per game averages: 38.3 minutes, 20.3 points, 10.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1 steal, 2.3 blocks.\n\nClippers totals: 7 seasons (2001-02 to 2007-08), 459 games, 9,336 points, 4,710 rebounds, 1,242 assists, 438 steals, 1,039 blocks, 51.4 field goal percentage.\n\nHonors with Clippers: 2x All-Star (2001-02 and 2005-06), 1x All-NBA 2nd team (2005-06).\n\nBig men rankings aside, Elton Brand is one of the Los Angeles Clippers’ top-five players altogether. A 20-10 machine with the team, strong force in the paint, agile post scorer, impressive mid-range shooter and imposing shot blocker, Brand was a talented, hard working force for the Clippers all over the floor.\n\nIn 2005-06, Brand had one of the best seasons by any Clipper. As an All-Star and All-NBA Second Team player, he averaged a career-high 24.7 points on 52.7 percent shooting, 10 rebounds, 2.6 assists, one steal and 2.5 blocks per game with a 26.5 PER.\n\nBrand was the team’s driving force that season. And despite not being able to carry them beyond the second round, he still led the Clippers to a 47-win season and a 4-1 first round victory over the Denver Nuggets.\n\nIt says a lot about the Clippers’ troubled history that that was their only playoff trip in the 2000s, but Brand was still a bonafide star in his time there. He did all he could. And continued to do so the following season in 2006-07 (his final healthy year in L.A.), averaging at least 20 points (20.5) for the fourth straight season to go along with 9.3 rebounds and 2.2 blocks.\n\nMore from Clipperholics\n\nHeadlining the 2005-06 roster — also featuring Corey Maggette, Sam Cassell (both 17-point-per-game scorers), Cuttino Mobley and Chris Kaman — Brand was the leader of the Los Angeles Clippers’ best spell and only playoff victory before Chris Paul and Co. arrived.\n\nNow out the NBA after a short spell with the Philadelphia 76ers last season, Brand has put together an impressive career. He’s 24th in league history in total blocks (1,828), a solid 67th in offensive win shares (65.8), and he’s among the best across the board for the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nIn the franchise rankings, he sits 3rd in points (9,336), 5th in points per game (20.3), 2nd in rebounds (4,710), 5th in rebounds per game (10.3), 3rd in blocks (1,039), 4th in blocks per game (2.3), 2nd to only Chris Paul in PER (23.4), and 1st in win shares (68.3).\n\nSo, yeah, Brand is quite the Clippers star.\n\nApr 14, 2015; Phoenix, AZ, USA; Los Angeles Clippers forward Blake Griffin (32) against the Phoenix Suns at US Airways Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\n2nd place – Blake Griffin (PF)\n\nClippers per game averages: 35.3 minutes, 21.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 steal, 0.6 blocks.\n\nClippers totals: 6 seasons (2010-11 — missed what would have been his rookie year due to injury — to now), 410 games, 8,801 points, 3,927 rebounds, 1,654 assists, 397 steals, 246 blocks, 52.1 field goal percentage.\n\nHonors with Clippers: Rookie of the Year (2010-11), 5x All-Star (2010-11 to 2014-15), 4x All-NBA 2nd team (2011-12 to 2013-14), 1x All-NBA 3rd team (2014-15).\n\nLongevity. That’s what makes Blake Griffin such a close call to being the best big men in Los Angeles Clippers history, losing 1st place to the only league MVP the team has had.\n\nWith what Blake’s achieved already in terms of personal accolades, statistical production, versatile skill, leading playoff charges, and his career trajectory, though, Griffin is well on the way to jumping one spot higher on this list.\n\nBut, for now, Griffin is in 2nd place. And what a 2nd place talent he is.\n\nThe Clippers have never had a big man with such a combination of athleticism, ball handling, passing and post play, and Griffin combines it all in one powerhouse of explosiveness. He’s come such a long way since his rookie season with limited range and 17.6 percent of his field goal attempts coming as dunks.\n\nYet, even at that lower level, he became the Rookie of the Year and an All-Star in 2010-11, averaging 22.5 points and a career-high 12.1 rebounds per game.\n\nHe was that good at 21 years old.\n\nIf you’ve been paying attention to the Clippers in recent years and you’ve watched Griffin play at all (essentially, so you know that he doesn’t just dunk), you’ll be aware of how much skill he has now. He can run the fastbreak, serve as the quarterback of an offense in half court sets, play from the post or operate from mid-range, and terrorize his opponents with his athleticism all over the court.\n\nThe 2015 playoffs were perhaps the best showcasing of Griffin’s versatile talents that we’ve seen. Leading the Clippers past the San Antonio Spurs alongside Chris Paul and into the second round against Houston, Griffin was unbelievable. He averaged 25.5 points on 51.1 percent shooting, 12.7 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game.\n\nIf the team had a bench and he wasn’t so exhausted, maybe they could have closed the deal against the Rockets and made the Conference Finals.\n\nIn a comeback effort in 2016-17, primed to bounce back and resume at the best level of his career when fully healthy again, Griffin will look to replicate that kind of performance in next year’s playoffs.\n\nTo start last season he wasn’t too far off either, recording 23.2 points, 8.7 rebounds and five assists per game prior to his injury at Christmas.\n\nAt 27, Griffin has climbed high in franchise history already thanks to such immediate production as a rookie. He ranks 5th in points (8,801), 4th in points per game (21.5), 8th in rebounds per game (9.6), 4th in PER (22.8), 3rd in offensive win shares (36.7) and 4th in overall win shares (54.7).\n\nJust think how incredible his numbers will be if he stays with the Los Angeles Clippers until he retires.\n\n1st place – Bob McAdoo (C)\n\nBraves per game averages: 40.2 minutes, 28.5 points, 12.6 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.2 steals, 2.5 blocks.\n\nBraves totals: 4 full seasons (1972-73 to 1975-76 — also played 20 games in 1976-77), 334 games, 9,434 points, 4,229 rebounds, 868 assists, 289 steals, 614 blocks, 50 field goal percentage.\n\nHonors with Braves: Rookie of the Year (1972-73), 1x NBA MVP (1974-75), 3x All-Star (1973-74 to 1975-76), 1x All-NBA 2nd team (1973-74), 1x All-NBA 1st team (1974-75), 3x scoring leader (1973-74 to 1975-76).\n\nBlake Griffin has the edge over Bob McAdoo in terms of longevity and upward trajectory for the rest of his career. McAdoo only completed four full seasons with the Buffalo Braves, so he may not be a long-time feature in the franchise’s history.\n\nHowever, seeing as McAdoo was at the top of the league during that time, becoming the only NBA MVP the team has had, it’s hard not to still keep him on top.\n\nMcAdoo was an exceptional scorer, and it allowed him to lead the team forward as a high draft pick (2nd overall in 1972) in a similar way to Griffin. Both received the Rookie of the Year award, too, so Blake is following in good footsteps when it comes to previous Los Angeles Clippers greats.\n\nFrom McAdoo’s smooth play in the post, fadeaway jumpers, work on the offensive glass or mid-range game, he was a scoring machine right away. After averaging a solid 18 points per game in his rookie season, his production skyrocketed in the form of 30.6 points on a league-best 54.7 percent shooting, 15.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.2 steals and 3.3 blocks in his sophomore year.\n\nObviously, McAdoo was an All-Star, making the All-NBA Second Team as well.\n\nMore from Clipperholics\n\nIf he wasn’t unstoppable enough already, he took another step forward in his third season in 1974-75. Scoring a career-high 34.5 points per game, McAdoo was named to the All-NBA First Team and was crowned MVP.\n\nFor three straight seasons from 1973-74 to 1975-76, he was the league scoring champion.\n\nSuch statistical prowess rightfully keeps McAdoo on top of this list. He took the Clippers from 22 wins the year before he arrived to 42 by his second season and 49 by his third, taking them back to the playoffs in the process.\n\nUnfortunately, McAdoo’s time with the Braves came to an end when he was traded in December of 1976.\n\nWhen he left, McAdoo was ranked 4th in total rebounds (4,229), 5th in total blocks (614), 3rd in PER (22.8), 5th in win shares (50.9) and 3rd in win shares per 48 minutes (0.182). And, you guessed it, he was pretty high in scoring, ranking 2nd in both total points (9,434) and points per game (28.5).\n\nFor just over four seasons work, that gaudy level of production speaks volumes about McAdoo’s remarkable talent.\n\nGriffin is on his way to the top, though. Especially if he re-signs next summer to continue leading the Los Angeles Clippers’ future.\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
