        "text": "PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia 76ers forward Elton Brand is retiring, the NBA veteran announced Thursday.\n\nThe Chicago Bullsselected the Duke standout with the No. 1 pick of the 1999 NBA draft. Brand shared Rookie of the Year honors with Steve Francis for the 1999-2000 season. He played 17 seasons in the NBA and was in his second stint with the 76ers when he announced his decision to retire.\n\nHe averaged 15.9 points and 8.5 rebounds in 1,058 games with the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Dallas Mavericks, Atlanta Hawks and Sixers.\n\nBrand was a two-time All-Star when he spurned better offers and signed an $82 million, five-year free-agent contract in 2008 with Philadelphia.\n\nHe made the announcement Thursday at the Sixers' training complex in Camden, New Jersey. Brand said playing in the NBA has been \"a wonderful journey. It's been an honor and a privilege.\"\n\nBrand had not played in the preseason. He will still collect $1 million from the Sixers."
