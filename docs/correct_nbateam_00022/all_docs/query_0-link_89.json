        "text": "Mom has the four-bedroom house in Marina Del Rey, Calif., with\n\nthe view, the gated entrance, the patio and the lemon tree in\n\nthe front yard. Son has the two-bedroom condo eight minutes\n\naway, on the 10th floor of a high-rise, nice but unspectacular,\n\nnothing close to, in his words, \"the usual NBA player palace.\"\n\nIt was that way in Chicago, too. Mom lived in a big house in the\n\nsuburb of Buffalo Grove, while Son had a small apartment\n\ndowntown, near the arena where for two seasons he plied his\n\ntrade for the worst team in the NBA. \"It'll always be like\n\nthat,\" says Los Angeles Clippers power forward Elton Brand.\n\n\"Wherever I go, Mom goes.\"\n\nReal estate comes with a price, though, and in this case\n\nMom--a.k.a. Daisy--pays it in eggs, turkey bacon, pancakes and\n\nFrench toast. When he's not on the road, Elton will show up at\n\nher place for breakfast four or five times a week, often lugging\n\nhis dirty laundry and bringing a couple of teammates. Dinner at\n\nDaisy's? That's fried chicken and greens two or three times a\n\nweek.\n\nSo meet the NBA's toughest mama's boy, the Clippers' bully of\n\nthe low block, the early-exit Dukie who has given his young team\n\n(average age: 26) a ruggedness and a respect that has been\n\nlacking since, well, almost forever. The last time this\n\nfranchise advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs was in\n\n1976, and then it was known as the Buffalo Braves. Through\n\nWednesday's games Los Angeles was 16-15, tied for the\n\nseventh-best record in the brutal Western Conference. In his\n\nfirst season with the Clippers, Brand was leading them in\n\nscoring (19.5 points per game), rebounding (10.9) and shooting\n\n(52.8%), while making Chicago Bulls executive vice president\n\nJerry Krause ever more secure in the knowledge that he had\n\nconcocted one of the most boneheaded trades in recent history.\n\nIt's one thing to deal a player who's likely to be, in NBA\n\nparlance, a 20-and-10-for-10 guy--one who averages 20 points and\n\n10 rebounds over 10 seasons--for a high school player, which is\n\nwhat Krause did the day before the 2001 draft when he unloaded\n\nBrand for the rights to the No. 2 pick, 18-year-old Tyson\n\nChandler, and end-of-the-bench forward Brian Skinner. It's quite\n\nanother when that 20-and-10-for-10 guy is a citizen of the\n\nhighest order, the kind of rock-solid player around whom a\n\nfranchise can be built. \"The only word I could use when I heard\n\nthat Elgin [Baylor, the Clippers' vice president of basketball\n\noperations] had pulled off the trade was shocked,\" says coach\n\nAlvin Gentry. \"The last thing we needed was another young\n\nplayer, but Elton, though he's only 22, doesn't really qualify.\n\nHe's mature beyond his years.\"\n\nIndeed, the best thing about Brand is that he succeeds in being\n\nboth old soldier and new guard. The younger Clippers love him as\n\none of their own, while the much older ones--well, that would\n\npretty much be 31-year-old guard Eric Piatkowski--respect him\n\nfor providing a model of what a Clipper should be in a town\n\nruled by the Lakers. \"Elton is the hardest-working player I've\n\nseen,\" says Piatkowski. \"That's incredibly important when your\n\nbest player is your hardest worker.\" Michael Smith, a former NBA\n\nforward who's the team's radio play-by-play man, puts his\n\nrespect for Brand thusly: \"I would be proud to call that young\n\nman my son.\"\n\nDaisy sure is. She's reserved, unlike her son, who's much more\n\nvoluble than his laid-back demeanor suggests. She doesn't like\n\nto be quoted, so let's just say that Elton has fulfilled her\n\nexpectations and then some. Daisy raised him and an older son,\n\nArtie McGriff, in low-income housing in Peekskill, N.Y., 45\n\nmiles north of New York City. Elton's grandfather, John Timms,\n\nwas another big influence on him (Grandson bought Grandpa a\n\nhouse in Peekskill), but Elton owes most of his success to\n\nDaisy. He has never met his father and, though he knows his\n\nname, would rather it not be mentioned. As a kid, Elton got into\n\nscrapes, but he says he neither drank nor did drugs, and Daisy\n\ndidn't let him out of the house until he had shown her his\n\nfinished homework. One story has it that Elton considered\n\njumping straight to the NBA out of Peekskill High, but that's\n\nfalse. \"Going to Duke was an easy decision for me,\" he says.\n\nSo was leaving after two years, particularly when coach Mike\n\nKrzyzewski gave his blessing, even if some Blue Devils fans\n\ndidn't. \"It was hard getting letters and e-mails that say, 'You\n\ndon't deserve to wear the blue-and-white,'\" says Brand, who\n\nbecame the first Duke underclassman to declare himself eligible\n\nfor the NBA draft. Shortly afterward, guard William Avery and\n\nforward Corey Maggette (now a Clippers teammate) announced they\n\nwere leaving early, too. Brand keeps in touch with Krzyzewski\n\nand says Coach K doesn't dog him about his failure to get a\n\ndiploma. \"But I think he sends [Duke assistant] Johnny Dawkins\n\nto do it,\" says Brand with a laugh. (Brand is two years from a\n\ndegree in sociology and isn't sanguine about his chances of\n\nearning it.)\n\nAlthough the Bulls took him with the No. 1 pick in 1999, Brand's\n\nprospects of excelling as a pro were far from certain. His\n\nshooting range topped out at eight feet, and as a 6'8\" post man\n\nhe would often be called upon to guard 7-footers. If it's too\n\nmuch to say there's a delicacy about the 265-pound Brand,\n\nthere's certainly something unimposing about him. His gait is\n\nlight and springy, his talk is high-pitched, and his upper body\n\nis hardly cut. Still, he averaged 20.1 points and 10.0 rebounds\n\nfor execrable Chicago in his first two seasons; Tim Duncan,\n\nKevin Garnett, Shaquille O'Neal and Chris Webber were the\n\nleague's only other 20-and-10 players over that span. For\n\nwhatever reason, though, Krause felt that Brand wasn't the\n\nplayer to guide the Bulls out of the abyss, one into which\n\nKrause, miner's hat lit all the way, had marched them.\n\nThe spin out of Chicago is that as a defender, Brand will\n\nforever be overpowered. \"That was a legit concern even from our\n\nend,\" says Gentry. \"All I can say is, it hasn't happened.\" In\n\ngames against Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs, Karl Malone of\n\nthe Utah Jazz and Rasheed Wallace of the Portland Trail Blazers,\n\nBrand has held his own. He makes up for his lack of height with\n\nlower-body strength, superb hands, an 89-inch wingspan and sheer\n\nindomitableness. \"He's relentless, he's skilled, he's a young\n\nCharles Barkley,\" says O'Neal. \"Only much quieter.\"\n\nIt's all but impossible to keep Brand from getting to the block\n\nonce he's determined to do so, and he's not to be budged once\n\nhe's there. Nor will he be discombobulated by double teams once\n\nhe gets the entry pass. \"From Day One,\" says Clippers forward\n\nLamar Odom, who has known Brand since their teens, \"he's been a\n\nbrute.\" Brand has a standard face-up jumper and jump hook--\"sort\n\nof an old man's game,\" says Maggette--but enough twists and\n\nturns, wriggles and wrinkles to keep from being predictable.\n\nOdom marvels at a move Brand has perfected in which he charges\n\nalong the baseline as if he's going to try a reverse layup, then\n\nstops suddenly and bulls his way up on the near side of the hoop.\n\nHis shooting range, which is up to 12 feet, has to expand if he\n\nis to get into the Duncan-Malone-Wallace class. He's\n\naccomplished on the pick-and-roll but not on the pick-and-pop,\n\nin which the pick setter drifts away from the basket and gets\n\nthe ball for an 18-footer. If Brand doesn't master that shot, it\n\nwon't be for lack of trying. It's a matter of honor for him to\n\nbe the last man firing after every practice, his wristy,\n\nlow-arced jumpers drawing a steady mantra from assistant coach\n\nRex Kalamian: \"Higher, E. Keep it high.\"\n\nWhat increases Brand's importance to this young team, though, is\n\nthe fact that he's not an all-work-no-play straight arrow. Yes,\n\nhe can usually be found leaving the arena in a designer suit,\n\noften walking beside the 22-year-old Maggette (cornrows),\n\n20-year-old forward Darius Miles (baggy jeans, leather jacket)\n\nand 21-year-old guard Quentin Richardson (matching Argyle\n\n'do-rag and sweater vest). Brand's epidermis is startlingly\n\ntattoo-free. As he puts it, \"I didn't want to be 65, look at\n\nmyself and say, 'Man, I got a heart with an arrow through it on\n\nme. How did that happen?'\"\n\nThough there's neither hip nor hop to his playing style and\n\nappearance, his musical tastes are in line with almost everyone\n\nelse's on this callow squad: Jay-Z, Biggie, Nelly and Nas. He\n\ndresses down from time to time, too, looking, in oversized jeans\n\nand 'do-rag, as if he's Miles's older brother. \"You see him\n\nlooking like that,\" says point guard Jeff McInnis, who's an\n\nancient 27, \"and you can't believe it's the same guy who goes\n\nout of here in a suit.\"\n\nBrand is aware that he has a size 15 firmly planted in each of\n\ntwo camps. \"I love hip-hop, the clothes, the videos, the whole\n\nthing. That's me,\" he says. \"At the same time I'm all about\n\nstraight business. That's me too.\" That dual identity is what\n\nhis teammates respect about him. \"He's totally down with\n\neverybody, but his maturity level is high,\" says Maggette. \"Even\n\nat Duke he was like that. It was the way that his mother brought\n\nhim up.\"\n\nBrand has put his brand of solid professionalism on the\n\nClippers, no doubt, and with his contract running through the\n\n2002-03 season, he has a chance to make an even greater\n\nimpression. Nonetheless, Los Angeles is a loosey-goosey, sassy,\n\nunpredictable team--a teen movie in red and blue. Less than an\n\nhour before a recent game McInnis and Miles sat at their\n\nlockers, sneaking a box supper. \"I'm only eating the roll,\" said\n\nMcInnis. Miles, though, was going for the fried chicken. \"You\n\nshould see what I can eat before a game,\" he said. \"See, I got\n\nthe young system.\"\n\nBefore Brand's arrival, the Clippers belonged to Odom, who awes\n\nhis teammates with his burgeoning versatility and keeps them in\n\nstitches with his street-smart argot. McInnis describes Gentry's\n\ncalling for more defensive effort in a huddle, and Odom's\n\nblurting, \"'Sup, son, we gotta get a stop, awry?\" Everybody\n\nlooked at him and cracked up. With Odom's having collected two\n\ndrug suspensions in eight months, however, some in the Clippers'\n\norganization believe that the leadership should be placed in\n\nmore reliable hands. Or, at least, that Brand should exercise\n\nboth his will and his vocal cords a little more strenuously. \"I\n\ndidn't want to step on anybody's toes,\" says Brand. \"But after\n\nLamar got suspended [from Nov. 5 to Nov. 20], I did feel I had\n\nto take a little more of the leadership role. We can both be\n\nleaders, each in his own way.\"\n\nFor the moment Brand's way will continue to be that of the quiet\n\nwarrior, furious and fierce on the court, steady and serene off\n\nit. A recent postpractice moment found Gentry telling Brand that\n\nL.A.'s other pro coach, a fellow named Phil Jackson, gets a\n\ndinner from a top restaurant brought to him by his girlfriend,\n\nJeanie Buss, the boss's daughter, before every game. \"I told [my\n\nwife] Suzanne about it,\" said Gentry, \"and she said, 'Oh, honey,\n\nI didn't know you wanted a nice dinner. Just call Jeanie Buss\n\nand tell her to bring you one.'\"\n\nBrand laughed and put his arm around Gentry. \"I'll take care of\n\nyou, Coach. What do you want, hot cereal or cold cereal?\"\n\n\"Don't you make anything else?\" Gentry asked.\n\n\"Pancakes,\" said Brand. Then he smiled. \"Well, actually, my mom\n\nmakes pancakes.\"\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PETER READ MILLER (BRAND) Mixing street tastes off the court with a button-down approach on it, Elton Brand, here with his ever-lovin' mom, Daisy, is infusing Los Angeles's other team with a new identity [T of C]\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPH BY PETER READ MILLER\n\nTWO COLOR PHOTOS: JOHN W.
