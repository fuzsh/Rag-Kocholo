He played in 72 games, with 18 starts.\n\nThe Hawks are counting on the two-time All-Star to bolster their depth in the frontcourt and provide veteran leadership in the locker room. He can play both center and power forward. Contract terms weren't disclosed.\n\nBrand was the No. 1 overall pick by the Chicago Bulls in the 1999 NBA draft. He also has played with the Los Angeles Clippers and Philadelphia."
