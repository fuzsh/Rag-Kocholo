        "text": "Within a matter of hours, the Clippers’ offseason got a lot more complicated as star forwards Elton Brand and Corey Maggette both opted out of the final year of their contracts and became unrestricted free agents.\n\nMaggette’s decision has been expected for weeks, but Brand’s came as something of a surprise.\n\nThe team has repeatedly said that it expects both to be back in Los Angeles next season, and Brand indicated to the Daily News that his preference was to be back with the Clippers as well.\n\nWith Maggette’s $7 million and Brand’s $16.4 million off the books, the Clippers all of a sudden have a ton of salary cap space.\n\nPresumably the majority of that will go toward the effort of re-signing Brand and Maggette, but the team is also expected to make a run at several free agent point guards.\n\nOnly Memphis and Philadelphia have significant cap space this offseason and neither is expected to make at run at Maggette or Brand.\n\nThat means the only way Maggette and Brand can sign with another team for anything close to the salary they already make – or are hoping to make – would be via a sign-and-trade.\n\nMaggette was the team’s leading scorer last season, averaging 22.1 points a game. Brand was injured for most of the season, after rupturing his Achilles tendon last August, but worked his way back for the final weeks of the season and looked close to his old form, averaging 17.6points and eight rebounds a game.\n\nBefore he was injured, Brand was regarded as one of the premier low-post players in the league. In his nine-year NBA career, he’s averaged 20.3 points and 10.2 rebounds.\n\nIn terms of leadership and personality, he is the unquestioned cornerstone of the franchise and as such, the Clippers have indicated they will do whatever they can to re-sign him.\n\nAlso Monday, the Clippers extended qualifying offers to restricted free agents Nick Fazekas and Marcus Williams, meaning they can match any offer sheet those players sign with another club.\n\nThey did not extend a qualifying offer to Shaun Livingston, who just recently was cleared to play after a devastating knee injury two seasons ago, but may try and re-sign him at a lower salary.\n\n“We are optimistic about Shaun’s ultimate return, but under the circumstances, we think it would be best to continue to monitor his progress while determining how best to move forward on his long-term status,” Roeser said.\n\nIn 26 games played for the Clippers and Mavericks last season, Fazekas averaged 4.1 points, 3.4 rebounds and 10.3minutes per game.\n\nFazekas was originally signed to two consecutive 10-day contracts by the Clippers, the first on Feb. 27. He was signed by the Clippers for the remainder of the season March 18.\n\nWilliams, a 6-foot-7 forward out of Arizona, averaged 0.9 points in 11 games played for the Clippers and San Antonio during the 2007-08 campaign. Williams was signed by the Clippers for the remainder of the season March 28.\n\n“We have been notified by Elton Brand and Corey Maggette of each player’s decision to opt out of his respective contract,” Clippers president Andy Roeser said in a statement. “… We will be aggressive in contacting them to address our interest in having them remain with the Clippers. We will also be active in contacting other free agents in whom we have interest.”"
