        "text": "After what felt like a lifetime of rumors, “will he, won’t he” debates regarding extending with the Los Angeles Clippers, and more than a few reports of different teams being interested in him, Paul George was reported to have found his new home in the NBA on July 1 — the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nWhile many Sixers fans were likely asleep, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski dropped the bomb at 3 a.m. ET that George, a nine-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA selection, had agreed on a four-year, $212 million maximum contract with Philadelphia.\n\nOn Saturday, the deal was made official, with the teamformally announcing the signing.\n\nNow, we have some inside information on why he ultimately chose the Sixers, his outlook on his new team, his message to the Philly fanbase and more thanks to the newest episode of his podcast, “Podcast P with Paul George”. The full episode is available below.\n\nHere’s some of the highlights from the episode.\n\nFirst meeting with the Sixers\n\n“I had that meeting with Philly Sunday night [June 30]. David Blitzer came, Josh Harris, Elton Brand, Dr. J — bro, I had Dr. J in my crib, that’s crazy — shoutout too to Peter Dinwiddie, Daryl Morey. The majority of the Philly front office was there at the house and you know it was a great meeting and talk about organization. Not to say the Clippers didn’t or don’t, but just an organization that just was like ‘man, you’re our guy. We believe in you, we want you here, there’s no [more] perfect pairing with you, Joel, Tyrese together.’\n\n“I felt it, and it just felt like all right this is this is where I’m going to spend the next chapter of my life.”\n\n“They sold the city, they sold the team, the organization, the fit and it was just like an opportunity I couldn’t pass up.”\n\nMindset going into that first Sixers meeting\n\n“It was just the idea idea of you know playing with such a presence in Joel and then just a fresh start, new opportunity. I was pretty open on the conversation and the decision. I think you know stuff was kind of at a stale with the Clippers, which opened me to looking at other teams, hearing other programs out, and ultimately it was more so just the idea of one of the best young point guards in the league and ... one of the best, if not the best, big in the league in Joel.”\n\n“It was kind of just like, you know, let’s see what this looks like.”\n\nMeeting Dr. J at that meeting\n\n“Dr. J had a dope, dope intro and like just story, right?\n\nSo he brought up how he joined the team, they ended up getting to the championship. Lost one. Got to the championship again. Lost. Got to the championship again, lost. Then he was like ‘you know, we just can’t get over the hump’. Then they go ahead and trade for Moses Malone and they win it and he was like ‘that was the missing piece’.\n\nHe was like ‘P, you the missing piece.’”\n\nGeorge capped off the story by saying “you know, where I sign at, man?” and gesturing signing a piece of paper.\n\nDiscussing his new Sixers teammates\n\nTyrese Maxey\n\n“I talked with Tyrese and Tyrese, man, one of the most mature kids in the league, one of the most mature kids for his age. He was just like ‘I learned so much when big fella [Embiid] went down. It was a ton of pressure on me but I was able to see different defenses, kind of learn and grow’. I’m like ‘whatever I can help with in getting you even better, that’s what I’m here for’. He’s a star. We all know he’s a star. He’s got No. 1 option capabilities and you need that fresh legs, that ... liveliness that he has.”\n\nJoel Embiid\n\n“Simple like I’mma space the floor for you, I’mma do this or that, like there’s so many ways we can play off one another. Like I said I’ve never played with someone just so big and dominant like that you know, he’s the best or one of the best centers in the league, bro. Like that’s a beast, you know, baby Shaq. Again, it’s a dream come true having a star point guard and a star big you know that’s a crazy dynamic right there.”\n\nKelly Oubre Jr.\n\n“I love his competitiveness. I love his tenaciousness. I’m looking forward to lining it up with him. Honestly I’m looking forward to being on the floor, being on the wing with him. I think I can help him grow, teach him things. I think he’s super talented. We always seem to get into it when we play but you know he’s one of those players I look forward to competing against. I’m looking forward to playing with KO.”\n\nNick Nurse\n\n“The game that you know that [Kelly Oubre] and Nick Nurse kind of went at the refs was the game we [the Clippers] played them. I always seen Nurse as a fiery, you know, competitive coach, like you could tell he’s fiery on the other side, but I’d never had any interactions with him. But seeing that moment it was like all right that’s who you want to play for. He was fired up, he was emotional. You know, it mattered and he cared.”\n\nWhy he believe the Sixers’ can contend for a title\n\n“Nick Nurse is as good as it gets his coaching, you know, he’s won at many different levels. I already talked about how good Joel is and Tyrese is and now you mixing myself, Oubre... I think we have a hell of a starting five and then we got veteran guys coming off the bench so we already have a recipe to be a really good team.\n\nI think, you know, everybody wants to win. I think you have a good mixture of veterans and young guys. I think Jared McCain will help, really good player out of college. So it’s just a good mixture of everything.”\n\nChoosing 8 as his Philadelphia jersey number\n\nKnown as PG-13, George might have been expected to again don the 13 jersey once he arrived in Philadelphia. Just one problem: the Sixers retired the number on March 18, 1991, for some guy named Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nAnother option may have been 24, which George wore his first four seasons in the NBA for the Indiana Pacers. Nope, sorry, not going to work either. The Sixers retired 24 in 1986 in honor of great defensive star Bobby Jones.\n\nGeorge has since revealed that he will wear the No. 8 jersey for Philadelphia.\n\n“I had to do it. I’m in Philly. My idol, Kobe Bryant. My way of idolizing Kobe and something that meant something outside of 24 and 13, so it was only right. I like the eight, the eight looks good on me.”\n\n“I was going through all numbers like what makes sense, what looks good, what will I be comfortable in. I went with like 14 because my son can’t say 13 so he says 14, but I don’t know. That number just didn’t look right. “\n\n“So then I’m going down, I wore 25 a little bit in high school but I didn’t love it in high school so I’m like ‘no, I’m not going to wear that again’. Also wore, I believe, 31 my freshman year in high school but 31 don’t look right with me. So I just kept going down the line.”\n\n“For me, it’s just good to have those moments of just like when you look at that jersey like ‘yeah, this is this is who I’m putting it on for’ so like I wanted that moment of just being being able to hold myself accountable.”\n\nLeaving California, his home state\n\nGeorge has deep roots in California. He was born in and played high school basketball in Palmdale before deciding to stay close to home for college at Fresno State. George returned to Cali in 2019 when he joined the Los Angeles Clippers. His decision to opt-out of his player option with the Clippers meant not only leaving his team, but leaving home.\n\n“That’s why it was the toughest decision cause it’s that I’m moving my kids, my wife. They comfortable here [in California]. My daughters, they already sad that they missing out and leaving their friends that they now have grown up with for the past five years. So it was it was a lot like I ain’t going to lie, it’s probably the most stressful time that I’ve been through in a long time because I’ve never been through free agency. This is the first time. Every time I’ve forgone free agency and re-signed, so this was the first time I was an official free agent, so it was stressful I ain’t going to lie. Especially me being home like I think if I was somewhere else it would have been a little different like ‘yeah, I don’t really got no ties here, I can leave’, but man, this is the crib, like ‘do I really want to leave LA?’.”\n\nThe Philadelphia fanbase\n\n“They can be rowdy. You know, I’ve heard the stories of them getting on their players or whatever like that, but that’s good pressure. That’s pressure that you want. You know Indy was kind of like that, but it lit a fire under you to play better and be better. I guess people would be scared of that, but it was kind of reassuring that they care and they want to win and I want to win so.”\n\nGetting to know Philadelphia as a city\n\n“I mean I can’t really say I feel like home or felt like it was home yet because I ain’t been there yet. As much as I know Philly is just the hotels and shit I stayed at when we’d go play there, so I ain’t never really been around the city in Philly. So I’m looking forward to doing that, going around the city, going into the restaurants, just getting that Philly vibe.\n\n“So I’m looking forward to that to like really close that and feel like ‘all right, yeah, this is where we comfortable this is where we spending the next four years at least’.”\n\nHis message to Sixers fans\n\n“I want to be there. You gonna get 100% max effort out of me. I look forward to just being in front of that crowd.\n\nYou know what was interesting, Aaron [Mintz, George’s agent] told me this, he was like ‘you know Philly is one of those destinations where historically the fans are all about their team. You haven’t played for something on that scale’. So I’m just looking forward to that, I’m looking forward to that embracing that and playing for y’all, working as hard as I can, bringing that two-way player. And just winning. Like I’m trying to win. I ain’t won yet, I can’t say that I’m a champion yet. I want to be able to crown myself as a champion so I’mma work hard as hell. I’mma push big fella [Embiid], I’mma push Tyrese to be better and just try to build something, man. Build a championship team.”"
