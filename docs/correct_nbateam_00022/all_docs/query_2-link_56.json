        "text": "When Baron Davis initially considered leaving the Golden State Warriors and signing with his hometown Los Angeles Clippers in July of 2008, he was expecting to team up with Elton Brand to form an inside-out All-Star-caliber duo.\n\nBut Brand ultimately had other plans, spurning Davis and the Clippers that summer to depart for the Philadelphia 76ers (and 10 years later, become their GM). Davis stuck to his word and signed with the Clippers, anyway. Over two and a half seasons and 183 career games with the franchise, Davis averaged 14.6 points, 3.4 rebounds, 7.6 assists and 1.6 steals per game.\n\nDavis’ tenure with the team was famously filled with strife, mainly because of former team owner Donald Sterling and the toxic culture he had fostered. Sterling once heckled Davis during a game, a precursor to the racially charged tape recording of him that TMZ released less than four years later.\n\n“I fought a lot of battles that I shouldn’t have had to fight,” Davis said.\n\nDavis retired from the NBA in 2012, and has since moved into the business as an entrepreneur and investor, founding Sports and Lifestyle in Culture (SLIC), The Black Santa Company and No Label, among other companies.\n\nWhile at WORLDZ, a two-day global business summit in Long Beach, Davis spoke with The Athletic over the phone about his transition to life after basketball, his post-NBA business ventures, his tumultuous tenure with the Clippers and his perspective on LeBron James’ arrival in L.A.\n\nAccording to Davis, this is the first time he’s publicly reflected on his tenure with the Clippers outside of only the Sterling shadow.\n\nNote: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity\n\nHow did you get involved with WORLDZ? What are you doing for them out there?\n\nJust talking about athletes being able to transform from athletics to business. And for me, I think WORLDZ is a great opportunity to not only connect to the future talent of business and sports, but all the things in and around the media space and the sports industry.\n\nHow has the transition been from the NBA into the business world?\n\nI can’t say it’s been smooth. It’s been a learning experience, which is exactly what I wanted. But I think now I am a seasoned veteran in it and I’m really excited at all the possibilities and the things that we have learned. And the opportunities to grow. The opportunities to take advantage of the experience and a great space and time to be an entrepreneur.\n\nWhat are some of the things you have invested in or founded?\n\nSLiC Sports. SLiCSports.com. It’s a platform for sports lifestyle and culture. A platform for players, past and present. It’s a storytelling platform. A content platform. We invested in Blavity. We also invested in a company called Everytable, which is a company that has a greater good of providing food for underserved communities. It’s high quality food in a restaurant atmosphere with prices that are affordable. And then URB-E, a scooter company out of Pasadena. Which is to me like the coldest version of a new version of a scooter. It’s not a stand-up, it’s a sit-down. So you get to ride. They have a really better angle at transforming micro-transportation.\n\nHave you taken anyone under your wing or mentored any current NBA players about their business ventures or investments?\n\nUm, I would say a lot of us, we share information, we share deal flow. There’s a lot of guys that we’re investing in similar companies. I think right now the important thing is the deal flow and the way that we’ve all been really collaborative. For me, I have a great deal of respect for the LeBrons, KDs, Iguodalas, Steph Curry, Chris Paul, those guys.\n\nAnd then also other guys that are younger like Jaylen Brown. The next frontier. The quintessential businessman/athlete. Obviously Jaylen Brown is probably my most favorite because of how young he is and (how) knowledgeable he is about who and what he’s doing.\n\nTransitioning to the Clippers. How do you look back on your two-and-a-half years with the Clippers?\n\nI would say, for me, I came there with the mission to try and change the culture. In two and a half years, I think I fought a lot of battles that I shouldn’t have had to fight. But in the end, the culture ultimately changed. There was no one there when I was there to take a stand for a change of culture until I got there. Then when I left, that’s when the culture changed. That’s how I view my space with the Clippers.\n\nI find that interesting. The Clippers were a laughingstock, one of the league’s worst franchises for so long, and then you signed there, they drafted DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin and things began to change. Did you sense things beginning to change in the moment? Or could you not see it?\n\nNah, I think when DJ and Blake got there, that’s when we started throwing lobs. The first year Blake was hurt and then I started the next season hurt. But once I had those two bigs, Blake and DJ, running to the rim, it was like finally I had these thoroughbreds. We just started throwing lobs.\n\nJust the young nucleus we had, Bledsoe, Aminu, I just thought that we were starting to have an identity. Right? And it was more so an identity that DeAndre and Blake could mature in and ultimately become the All-Stars that they were. To me, it was finally fun to show up and play basketball because those were making it fun. So I would just throw lobs. And so it became Lob City.\n\nLooking back, what is your favorite moment with the franchise? On the court or off the court, is there something you’re still proud of?\n\nNo. I can say honestly like I don’t feel like I ever really got a chance to be the person that I could because all of the craziness that was happening. So I had to assume a different role and that was a role of someone more serious.\n\nSo when I look at my Clipper experience, there’s nothing that I really love or appreciate outside of my connection with the fans and the fact that they believed in me and supported me. I would say my favorite moment is just all the moments that I was able to connect with the fans and hoop and play the game that they believed and knew I could play.\n\nPresent day, the Clippers have new ownership in Steve Ballmer and a championship-winning coach in Doc Rivers. The team is undergoing a new direction post-Lob City. What do you think about the state of the franchise in 2018?\n\nI mean, I feel like they have a lot of good talent. I actually feel like they’re one of the sleeper teams in the West because of their balance of talent. Doc Rivers is a well-seasoned coach. But I think now that the Clippers have new ownership, like the Warriors, I think that it’s just a matter of them programming the right people.\n\nThey have an opportunity with new ownership to actually have a brand outside of the brand that they tried to build over the last five years. They can establish themselves as their own identity, and then also in the community of L.A. Just looking at the opportunity they have with this new ownership, I think they have an opportunity to do it right and actually build something. I’m just looking forward to seeing what it looks like. I’m looking forward to seeing how they build it and what the future holds.\n\nWhen people think of homegrown L.A. basketball, you’re one of the first names that comes up. You’re an authority on the state of the city’s basketball. From your perspective, how has the energy in the city changed with LeBron in L.A., if at all?\n\nL.A. has always been a great basketball community. Everybody loves basketball and it’s a lifestyle. I think having somebody like LeBron James in L.A. only boosts everything that we’re doing. L.A. will have the opportunity to show what our contributions to the game of basketball, the lifestyle of basketball are.\n\nI think that’s why ultimately LeBron chose to play for the Lakers. Because he knew he could be LeBron James in a big city and still have that connectivity to the fans and the lifestyle of basketball. I think LeBron is doing something great for L.A. Tune in to see what happens.\n\n(Top photo of Baron Davis by M. Anthony Nesmith/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"
