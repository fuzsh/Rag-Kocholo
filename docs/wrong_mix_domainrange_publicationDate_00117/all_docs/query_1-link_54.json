        "text": "The first published novel in this bestselling series asks the question: \"What if the basic human nature suddenly changed?\" Hugh Valleroy of the Gen Police undertakes a covert mission into Sime Territory to rescue the woman he loves from the Sime kidnappers who would use her to destroy his government. His protector and guide?--a Sime who carefully and deliberately plans to kill him!\n\nThe New York Times Book Review says of the Sime~Gen Series that \"It calls to mind the Frank Herbert of 'Dune' and the Walter M. Miller, Jr. of 'A Canticle for Leibowitz'.\""
