        "text": "Introibo Ad Altare\n\nOne of the landmark jewels of science fiction, Walter Miller's Canticle will be, for some readers of a certain age, a treat for the ear, the heart, and the soul. However, so much has changed since the author crafted this work, e.g., the thaw of the Cold War, the disappearance of Latin since the Second Vatican Council in 1965, and the steep decine of the Catholic Church with its rigors and obedience, that many of the central premises and conceits of the book simply no longer commonly exist today. For me, the book was as fresh as when I read it in 1967 as a high school student. I hope that a younger audience enjoys it as much as I have.\n\nWarning: There is a LOT of Latin in this work. This could make it difficult to parse as an audio experience unless you have a pretty good grounding in this tongue. You might want to get the kindle text to read with it. I think you will find it to be worth your while.\n\nMust Read Classic\n\nI do not know why it took so long for me to actually listen to this book, as it has been on my \"to read\" list for decades. It is a wonderful and thoughtful story (3 actually) that asks tough questions and will cause you to rethink your opinions on some weighty matters.\n\nIt is a product of it's time (late 1950's) but is still relevant today. It is a great book to read with a group due to the discussions the book generates. Highly recommend to all!\n\nA Post-Apocalyptic Classic, but bring the caffeine\n\nAs I continue to read through the classics of Science Fiction, this book easily makes the Top 50 list of most of the people who know. Billed as one of the finest examples of a post-apocalyptic world I was looking forward to seeing what that world would look like from the eyes of a writer from the 1960's. Miller's most important assumption is one I agree with completely: if the world blows itself up, the Church and it's teachings (including a full Latin vocabulary) will survive. Miller was specific about the members of the Church he uses as his characters in each section, focusing less on the world after the burn and more on how the Order deals with the events of the world in each time and how it impacts their overall mission. On the whole, it's a good read and definitely worthwhile for any lover of SF. As a book on its own it's horribly dry. Whatever sense of conflict you may feel is so drawn and thinned out over the course of the chapters by the time the resolution comes you simply shrug your shoulders and move on. The lack of intensity in the prose is worsened by Weiner's monotone and bland recording. He uses the exact same inflection for the most impactful of sentences as he does the most mundane. I had to pause the recording several times and ask, \"Whoa, what just happened?\" because the sentence had been passed so quickly by the narrator. Weiner's Latin pronunciation is excellent, and as a former Latin student it was fun to flex my Latin muscles and see how much I remembered. For anyone but the hardcore SF fan, I doubt I'd recommend this book, and I'd certainly recommend any other recording of it. But Miller's lessons of a nuclear world shine through clearly, as are how the Church will thrive and ensure mankind's legacy is preserved in spite of our collective propensity to destroy ourselves.\n\nan uneven trilogy of short stories\n\nThe first two parts are excellent, but the third flounders heavily in hamfisted morality. This book is cleary relevant today, as a warning to those who would deny science, though I wish the third part was written with a hint of subtlety.\n\nGlad to Have This One in my Library\n\nOriginally gave this book a read back in my early teens. Although I lost my copy, the huanting tale remained with me. When I found this title on Audible, I took a nice listen and found the story still works.\n\nOf the three story-segments, I found the 1st to be my favorite. It is about discovery. The 3rd segment may prove the most memorible, though, as the reader experiences history repeating itself.\n\nA great story. Fair narration.\n\nwowy\n\nI had no idea what to expect going in, and was a tad skeptical at parts during the first third with brother Francis but that was right about at the end of that section; and wowy kazowy is the book good. The book raises a lot of powerful theological and philosophical ideas. I just finished it and im kind of in awe right now and cant really write a good review\n\nNot for me\n\nI just thought this book gave a very negative outlook on life in the future. Everything is centered around a monastery, the handful of women mentioned are all lame figures, and the world is a form of dystopia, which I do not appreciated.\n\nMy sci-fi literature class sci-fi geeks loved it, so if you are one... you might like it. But not for me. Narrator is amazing at all the impressions though."
