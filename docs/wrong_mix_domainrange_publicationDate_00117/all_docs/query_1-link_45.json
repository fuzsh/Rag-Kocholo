        "text": "Book Reviews\n\nCave ab homine unius libri.\n\nBeware the man of one book.\n\nAnonymous, as quoted by Isaac D'Israeli, Curiosities of Literature\n\nSince August of 2003, I've been writing reviews of nearly every book that I read. The reviews are just my personal opinion based on how much I like the book, although I try to provide some analysis of why I hold that opinion. I try to avoid major plot spoilers, but if you're striving to be completely spoiler-free, you may not want to read on, since I do sometimes talk about specific things I liked or disliked and that can include the general tone of the ending.\n\nFor more details and my review request policy, see my review philosophy.\n\nMost recent reviews:\n\n2024-07-11 Kemi Ashing-Giwa The Splinter in the Sky 8 out of 10 2024-07-08 Terry Pratchett Raising Steam 3 out of 10 2024-07-07 Kit Rocha Beyond Control 5 out of 10 2024-07-06 Lyda Morehouse Welcome to Boy.Net 7 out of 10 2024-06-30 Terry Pratchett Snuff 8 out of 10\n\nAn RSS feed of new reviews is available. My reviews are also posted to a limited distribution newsgroup and to a mailing list anyone may subscribe to.\n\nReviews are sorted by book type, genre, author, by order in a series, and then by title. The rating (out of 10) is given before each title. You can also see the same list sorted by rating or by review date.\n\nI also have pages for the award winners for best novel for a variety of science fiction and fantasy awards, and for various other on-line reading lists, including ratings and links to reviews when I've read the books.\n\nNote that ratings for books that I actually like will be between 5 and 10; a rating of 5 indicates that I felt neutral about the book after having read it. Anything below 5 means that I considered reading the book to be a waste of my time. As such, an \"average\" good book will get a 7. Since I mostly read books that I have some reason to believe I'll like, you won't see many ratings below a 5. Books I didn't finish will have a 0 next to them as a rating.\n\nI also write magazine reviews (only of science fiction and fantasy so far). An index of all my SFF short fiction reviews, from magazines, collections, and anthologies, is available.\n\nFor more information about where I get the other information I collect about the books I read and about how I maintain this site, see my review notes."
