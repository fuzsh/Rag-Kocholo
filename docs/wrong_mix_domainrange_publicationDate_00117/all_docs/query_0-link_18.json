        "text": "Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, The\n\nEntry updated 13 August 2022. Tagged: Publication.\n\nUS Digest-size magazine; published Fall 1949 to the present. The first issue was titled simply The Magazine of Fantasy. Until February 1958 published by Fantasy House, Inc, a subsidiary of Mercury Publications, then by Mercury Press until January 2001, then by Gordon Van Gelder's Spilogale, Inc; Lawrence E Spivak (1900-1994) was Publisher from Fall 1949 to July 1954, Joseph W Ferman August 1954 to October 1970, Edward L Ferman from November 1970 to January 2001, and Gordon Van Gelder from February 2001 to the present. The full list of editors is given below. The founding editors were Anthony Boucher and J Francis McComas with Boucher continuing alone from September 1954 until August 1958. The magazine began as a quarterly, became a bimonthly in February 1951, and monthly from August 1952 to March 2009, though with a combined October/November issue (meaning eleven issues per year) since 1991. It became once again bimonthly, with larger issues, from April/May 2009. With the January/February 2013 issue F&SF – this encyclopedia's usual abbreviation of the title – reached its 700th individual issue. Throughout it has retained many features typical of Mercury Publications, whose designer, George Salter, not only created the look of the new magazine but contributed cover illustrations as well for several years. These features include the digest format, the same typography on the cover and spine, and a continued use of one-column pages, making it the most consistent of all the long-running sf magazines. It is now the only surviving professional digest-size magazine.\n\nF&SF – the abbreviation, taken from the words \"Fantasy and Science Fiction\" on the spine, being in almost universal use by its readers – won Hugos for Best Magazine in 1958, 1959, 1960, 1963, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972; after that category was dropped, Edward L Ferman won the Hugo for Best Editor in 1981, 1982 and 1983. There was then a long gap until Kristine Kathryn Rusch won the same award in 1994 and another gap before Gordon Van Gelder won it in the Best Editor, short form category, in 2007 and 2008. The contents and artwork in F&SF have won a considerable number of awards, as shown by the list at the end of this entry which covers only the Hugo, Nebula and Locus Awards. Stories from F&SF have won a greater diversity of awards than any other magazine.\n\nAlthough F&SF has serialized novels, its editorial policy has always placed the emphasis on short stories. Its founding editors abandoned the standards of Pulp-magazine fiction and asked for stylish sf/fantasy that was up to the literary standards of the Slick magazines that had shaped US short-story writing between the wars; they also abandoned interior illustrations. At the outset F&SF published a great deal of light and humorous material, and used occasional reprints of stories by prestigious writers, including Robert Graves, Eric Linklater, Robert Nathan, Robert Louis Stevenson, James Thurber, Oscar Wilde and P G Wodehouse and new material by Gerald Heard and C S Lewis. It had modelled itself to a degree on Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine (see Ellery Queen), which was a companion title when F&SF began and which had also been in digest form from the start, had sought to divorce itself from the pulps and, to a degree, had despite its title presented itself more as an Anthology than a magazine. F&SF did the same, and the issues edited by Boucher and McComas serve as a showcase for little-known sf and fantasy stories as well as the more unusual new material. Its cover art, mostly by George Salter at the start, was distinctive and like nothing else in the SF Magazine world. The fact that it published material by authors who only appeared in F&SF and not in any other genre magazines, though might equally be at home in a Slick magazine, shows the extent to which F&SF set itself apart from the other magazines: writers like Vance Aandahl, Doris Pitkin Buck, Esther Carlson, Mildred Clingerman, P M Hubbard, H Nearing Jr, John Novotny, Will Stanton – plus those who were almost exclusively F&SF writers, such as Avram Davidson, Zenna Henderson, Harvey Jacobs, Willard Marsh, Ward Moore and Kit Reed – or indeed those who created separate personae exclusively for F&SF such as Margaret St Clair as Idris Seabright, and Manly Wade Wellman as Levi Crow. Even today there are writers still far more closely associated with F&SF than any other magazine, such as Albert E Cowdrey and Mary Rickert, showing that even though the magazine has developed, an individuality – almost an exclusivity – remains.\n\nThus during the 1950s F&SF was not regarded in the same way as its two close rivals, Astounding and Galaxy, and though these were for many years banded together as \"the Big Three\", that had more to do with diversity than similarity: in simplistic terms, Astounding for Hard SF, Galaxy for social and satirical sf and F&SF for literary sf and anything out of the ordinary. Several stories are testament to the distinctiveness of F&SF's broader editorial policy: \"Born of Man and Woman\" (Summer 1950) by Richard Matheson, Bring the Jubilee by Ward Moore (November 1952; exp 1953); Manly Wade Wellman's John the Ballad Singer series; a number of Avram Davidson's early stories, especially \"The Golem\" (March 1955), the Papa Schimmelhorn stories by Reginald Bretnor, several stories by Damon Knight, especially \"The Country of the Kind\" (February 1956), the People series by Zenna Henderson, these are all uniquely F&SF stories. Others, that by rights could have appeared elsewhere, have Anthony Boucher or Robert P Mills to thank for finding them a home. Paramount amongst these are the series that became the book A Canticle for Leibowitz (fixup dated 1960 but 1959) that began with the title story in the April 1955 issue and included \"And the Light is Risen\" (August 1956) and \"The Last Canticle\" (February 1957). Miller had been unable to sell the first story but Boucher instantly saw its importance. Another example is one of the most respected of all sf stories, \"Flowers for Algernon\" (April 1959) by Daniel Keyes which had been written for H L Gold at Galaxy: Gold rejected it, asking for a happy ending. William Tenn advised Keyes not to revise it and Robert P Mills snapped it up for F&SF. One further example will suffice. Mills had originally rejected a story by Philip José Farmer which was then sold to Fantastic Universe, but when that magazine folded, Mills changed his mind and published the story as \"Open to Me, My Sister\" (May 1960), perhaps the most extreme example of alien Sex to appear in the sf magazines of that period.\n\nMills, who was editor from September 1958 to March 1962, is often unfairly regarded as a caretaker editor; but not only had he served as managing editor under Boucher, compiling the issues in his New York office from what Boucher sent him, but he himself acquired fiction for thirty-one creditable issues. Besides the Farmer and Keyes stories, he also published Robert A Heinlein's \"All You Zombies –\" (March 1959); Theodore Sturgeon's \"The Man Who Lost the Sea\" (October 1959); Alfred Bester's \"The Pi Man\" (October 1959); an abridged version of Heinlein's Starship Troopers (1959) as \"Starship Soldier\" (October-November 1959) and of Algis Budrys's Rogue Moon (December 1960; exp 1960); plus Brian W Aldiss's Hothouse series which began in February 1961; and J G Ballard's \"The Garden of Time\" (February 1962). He gave the first US publication to Kingsley Amis's \"Something Strange\" (25 November 1960 Spectator; July 1961) and published six stories by the author of Spartacus (1951), Howard Fast. He also published the first stories to see print by Richard M McKenna and Joanna Russ. At this same time he was editing F&SF's new sister magazine Venture Science Fiction and when Venture closed, Mills ensured that the science column, which Isaac Asimov had started there, continued in F&SF. It ran in every issue from November 1958 to February 1992: 399 essays which Asimov collected into many books. The series, which Asimov always maintained was what he most enjoyed writing, ceased only with Asimov's death. A 400th essay, \"A Way of Thinking\" (December 1994) was put together by his widow Janet Asimov based on their discussions, but a more appropriate final one appeared as \"Yours Isaac Asimov\" (January 1996) extracted from the book Yours, Isaac Asimov: A Lifetime of Letters (1995) assembled by his brother, Stanley Asimov (1929-1995).\n\nUnder Mills, F&SF maintained its distinctiveness though it also lost some of the Boucher idiosyncrasies and the Slick veneer. It did, however, run the long series (1958-1964) of punning and shaggy-dog stories known as Feghoots, written by Reginald Bretnor as Grendel Briarton. It was on its way to becoming a more orthodox sf magazine, though it had first to pass through the even more idiosyncratic editorship of Avram Davidson which ran from April 1962 to November 1964. Davidson rarely settled and spent much of his time as editor in Mexico, and the young Edward L Ferman came in as managing editor, to assemble the issues in New York. Davidson made the magazine peculiarly his own. He introduced writers from beyond the English-speaking world, such as Hugo Correa from Chile (see Latin America), Herbert W Franke from Germany, Shin'ishi Hoshi from Japan and Valentina Zhuravlyova from the Soviet Union. He published the first story by Terry Carr, \"Who Sups with the Devil?\" (May 1962) and the first of Roger Zelazny's stories to be nominated for a Hugo, \"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\" (November 1963). At the suggestion of Joseph Ferman, Davidson produced the first two \"author special\" issues, featuring Theodore Sturgeon (September 1962) and Ray Bradbury (May 1963). This has since become an occasional but important part of F&SF's history. Subsequent special issues featured Isaac Asimov (October 1966), Fritz Leiber (July 1969), Poul Anderson (April 1971), James Blish (April 1972), Frederik Pohl (September 1973), Robert Silverberg (April 1974), Damon Knight (November 1976), Harlan Ellison (July 1977), Stephen King (December 1990), Lucius Shepard (March 2001), Kate Wilhelm (September 2001), Barry N Malzberg (June 2003), Gene Wolfe (April 2007) and David Gerrold (September/October 2016).\n\nIt became impractical for Davidson to continue editing the magazine at long distance, and from December 1964 Joseph Ferman nominally took over as editor; in practice his son, Edward Ferman was really producing the magazine in all but name, and had been since the November 1964 issue, though the first for which he felt fully in control was for May 1965. He remained editor for the next 26 years, also succeeding his father as publisher from November 1970. Ferman made F&SF something of a cottage industry run from his home in Connecticut, with a succession of assistant editors, including Ted White and Andrew Porter in New York and Anne Jordan (1943-2013) in Connecticut. He introduced Judith Merril as the regular book columnist from March 1965.\n\nIt was during Ferman's long run that the magazine consolidated itself, keeping the character of the past with the need to reflect the present and look to the future. It managed to avoid the odder excesses of the New Wave and yet published first-class material by people associated with it, such as Thomas M Disch and John Sladek, and the new wave of American talent, notably Samuel Delany and Roger Zelazny. In 1968 the magazine sponsored a novel-writing contest won by Piers Anthony with Sos the Rope (July-September 1968; 1968). If it had a heyday – and it is rare for F&SF not to be having a heyday – it would have been the 1970s and, amidst a wealth of creative and important writers, the two that dominate that decade are Harlan Ellison and James Tiptree Jr. Ellison was at his most creative during that period and F&SF benefited the most with \"Corpse\" (January 1972), \"Basilisk\" (August 1972), \"The Deathbird\" (March 1973), \"Croatoan\" (May 1975) and \"Jeffty is Five\" (October 1979), to name but a few. James Tiptree was also writing at her best in this decade and F&SF arguably ran her best work, \"Painwise\" (February 1972), \"And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill's Side\" (March 1972) and the story that almost defined her whole output, \"The Women Men Don't See\" (December 1973).\n\nFerman also discovered several important writers during the 1970s, chief amongst them Pamela Sargent, Tom Reamy and John Varley, and he ran much of the important early work of Michael Bishop, James Patrick Kelly, Lisa Tuttle and Michael Shea. Ferman was welcoming to British writers, and even assembled an all-British issue (April 1978). Works of special interest by British writers at this time include \"Pages from a Young Girl's Journal\" (February 1973) by Robert Aickman (1914-1981), which won the first short-fiction World Fantasy Award; \"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" (March 1976) by Richard Cowper, which served as a prelude to his Corlay sequence, and \"Palely Loitering\" (January 1979) by Christopher Priest, which won the BSFA Award.\n\nDuring the 1970s Ferman was able to show F&SF at its best with its widest range of material, from solid Hard SF in the works of Gregory Benford, Algis Budrys, John Varley and Frederik Pohl, to the more exotic sf of Michael Bishop and Robert Silverberg – whose Lord Valentine's Castle (1980) was serialized from November 1979 to February 1980 – to the fantasies of Sterling Lanier and Tom Reamy and the supernatural horror of Charles L Grant and Stephen King. Ferman also retained the eccentric and idiosyncratic with contributors like Harvey Jacobs, R A Lafferty and the linguistically challenging Felix Gotschalk.\n\nThe 1980s began in the same way but brought a new challenge. Isaac Asimov's SF Magazine (see Asimov's), which had started in 1977, had followed its own course under George Scithers but under Shawna McCarthy from 1983 and Gardner Dozois from 1986 began to run material that would normally be more closely associated with F&SF. Avram Davidson had already been lured away to Asimov's and whilst F&SF had published most of the early work by Lucius Shepard he, too, was soon selling regularly to Asimov's. Moreover, Asimov's was publishing authors you would expect to see in F&SF, like James P Blaylock, John Crowley and Dan Simmons. There was a similar, but not quite so intense rivalry from Omni. The territory which F&SF had for so long regarded as its own and which had made it so popular, was now being invaded by two other major magazines. F&SF still acquired excellent material, including most of the final stories by James Tiptree Jr, and work by Jonathan Carroll, Robert P Holdstock, Nancy Springer and Bruce Sterling, and would occasionally publish stories that stood out for their audacity or daring, notably \"Lost Boys\" (October 1989) by Orson Scott Card or the start of the Kirinyaga series by Mike Resnick with Kirinyaga (November 1988; 1992 chap). But the uniqueness of F&SF had been eroded.\n\nIn 1991 Ferman handed the editorial reins to Kristine Kathryn Rusch, twenty-three years his junior, which had an immediate impact on the magazine. Under Rusch's editorship many readers claimed to detect a change in the \"feel\" of the magazine, as Rusch introduced a greater element of dark fantasy and horror, as best exemplified by \"The Night We Buried Road Dog\" (January 1993) by Jack Cady. It was also during her tenure that Isaac Asimov died; the loss of his column, which had added significantly to the magazine's personality, was not easy to replace. His successors have included Gregory Benford and Bruce Sterling. Also, Algis Budrys, who had been the magazine's lead book reviewer since 1975, stepped down in 1992. He was succeeded by John Kessel who stepped down in 1995 to be followed by Robert Killheffer (1994-2004) sometimes alternating with Elizabeth Hand and James Sallis. Rusch also introduced the new column, \"Plumage from Pegasus\" by Paul Di Filippo from September 1994. Rusch still published some important fiction, such as \"Last Summer at Mars Hill\" (August 1994) by Elizabeth Hand and \"The Martian Child\" (September 1994) by David Gerrold, but it was difficult to compete with Asimov's, though Rusch did win the Best Professional Editor Hugo award in 1994. Amongst the readers of Locus who vote for the Locus Awards, F&SF was now the regular runner-up rather than winner, and it did not regain first place until 2002, a position it continued to hold until superseded again by Asimov's in 2011.\n\nThis recovery is due to the change to Gordon Van Gelder as editor in June 1997 and as publisher from 2001. He began to restore some of the magazine's distinctiveness, and though he still ran Hard SF on occasions, the magazine's emphasis shifted towards a broader range of fantasy and thereby regaining its own voice. Van Gelder's biggest challenge was how to deal with the drop in circulation that was afflicting all Print Magazines. F&SF's circulation had always been fairly constant, between 50-60,000 and had even defied trends in the 1980s by rising above 60,000, mostly due to a solid subscriber base, but by the mid-1990s began to drop, roughly 10% year on year to under 15,000 by 2011. To reduce costs Van Gelder switched to bimonthly publication from April 2009, but increased the page count from 160 to 260 with a corresponding price rise. The extra pages allowed Van Gelder to include a wider range of material and longer stories, so that each issue is now a more substantial read. Contents-wise, F&SF is as good as ever, but its future, in terms of sales, still raises questions. C C Finlay took over as editor with the March/April 2015 issue, while Van Gelder continued as publisher. As a contributor Finlay had been quite a renegade, producing such notable stories as \"The Political Officer\" (April 2002) and \"Pervert\" (March 2004). This did not translate into his editing where he kept a reasonably even keel, continuing in the tradition of F&SF, always allowing some experimentation but generally not changing the trusted formula. As under van Gelder, there was a preponderance of fantasy over sf. Slowly but steadily, Finlay encouraged more contributions by writers from outside the USA. He was succeeded as editor by Sheree Renée Thomas from the March/April 2021 issue.\n\nThroughout its life F&SF has generally not carried any internal illustrations besides occasional cartoons and department masthead designs (one of the rare exceptions being artwork for Robert A Heinlein's \"Star Lummox\", May-July 1954), but it has always had exceptional cover art. During the 1950s the mainstay artist was Ed Emshwiller, with occasional space covers by Chesley Bonestell. Of interest was a series of sixteen covers by Mel Hunter, which ran between October 1955 and December 1971, with one later one in May 2003 and was known as the \"Last Man\" series, depicting a lone Robot in various settings and guises, long after humanity has gone. A distinctive artist in the 1960s was Ron Walotsky, whose first cover was in May 1967 and he continued to provide occasional covers up to his death in 2002. David Hardy, Rick Sternbach and Don Davis all provided some striking astronomical covers throughout the 1970s – F&SF would sometimes have a science-based cover but with no Hard SF stories in the issue. Barclay Shaw began his run of over twenty occasional covers in March 1979. In more recent years covers have been provided by Kent Bash, Jill Bauman, Max Bertolini, Cory and Catska Ench, Michael Garland and Maurizio Manzieri, most of them fantasy-orientated, whilst Bob Eggleton has won four Chesley Awards for his more science-based covers.\n\nThere have been many anthologies derived from F&SF, for details of which see the individual editors' entries. In addition, The Eureka Years (anth 1982) compiled by Annette Peltz McComas, reprinted stories, commentary and letters from the magazine's first five years, showing how it was founded and established.\n\nUK editions of the magazine ran from October 1953 to September 1954 (12 issues) from Mellifont Press (for an index of its publications see Stephen Holland), and from December 1959 to June 1964 (55 issues) from Atlas Publishing and Distributing. These did not reprint whole issues, but selected and recombined stories from the US edition. The UK reprint magazine Venture Science Fiction (1963-1965), also from Atlas, carried material from FSF as well as from the US Venture. There was a selective reprint edition in Australia between November 1954 and August 1958 (14 issues, undated) from Consolidated Press, Sydney.\n\nThere has also been an extensive number of non-English language editions of F&SF around the world, two of which evolved into major magazines. In France, Fiction began in October 1953 and continued, with occasional lulls, until February 1990, a total of 412 issues. For most of that time it was edited by Alain Dorémieux and it incorporated original French material in addition to the translations from the US edition. Some of those new stories were translated into English for the US edition, such as Claude Veillot's story of alien domination, \"The First Days of May\" (May 1960 Fiction as \"Les Premiers jours de mai\"; December 1961 trans Damon Knight). Fiction was relaunched in Spring 2005 as a twice-yearly magazine/anthology series. In Japan, S-F Magazine began in February 1960 as an edition of F&SF but soon developed as a major magazine of original material and continues today, one of the world's longest running magazines. If both F&SF and S-F Magazine maintain their current schedules, S-F Magazine will pass F&SF's total number of issues in January 2016, and possibly earlier if it continues to produce the occasional special extra issue. Other editions of F&SF, in order of appearance, include: Italy, Fantascienza (November 1954-May 1955), Fantasia & Fantascienza (December 1962-October 1963) and a current incarnation published by Elara Libre; Brazil, Magazine de Ficção Científica (April 1970-November 1971; 20 issues); Norway, Science Fiction Magasinet (September and October 1971), which thereafter continued as a separate magazine; Sweden, Jules Verne Magasinet which was revived and, from issue #343 (January 1972) reached an agreement with Edward Ferman to translate stories; Argentina, La revista de ciencia ficción y fantasía (October 1976-February 1977; 3 issues); Israel, Fantasia 2000 (December 1978-August 1984; 44 issues) and Russia, Supernova, which began in January 1994.
