Professor Simon Blackburn is one of the most accomplished contemporary philosophers. His academic credentials are impressive to say the least: he’s currently a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge a Research Professor at UNC Chapel Hill, and Professor at the New College of Humanities. His 1999 book Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy is exactly that: as accessible and lucid an introduction to the discipline as you’re likely to find. He is a vocal advocate of his subject, and an important contributor to public debate, offering positions on everything from truth to morality.

As part of the New College of Humanities spring lecture series, Blackburn will give a talk entitled ‘Moral Luck and the Peculiarity of Blame.’ He will contribute to that ongoing and thorny debate: how do we talk about an individual’s morality if the circumstances determining their actions lie outside of their control?

This is sure to be a fascinating evening for committed philosopher and aspiring logician alike.
