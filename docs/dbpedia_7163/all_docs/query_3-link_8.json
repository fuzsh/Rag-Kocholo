        "text": "I've been searching the questions posed here, and don't seem to find one that gives the answers I am looking for. I've proposed to start a list on meta but no one proposed anything, so I feel I must ask this question: What are some books generally regarded as good for a general introduction on philosophy? By this I mean good books that can introduce you to philosophy in general and throughout the times, not to some philosophy or period in particular.\n\nThis question almost answers mine, except for the fact that most things proposed there are not books, thus not giving me much options to weigh upon. This one regards contemporary philosophy in particular. And this one has the same problem as the first one, plus the fact that it asks for layman's terms, which is not what I am looking for.\n\nI've been tempted to buy Will Durant's The Story of Philosophy, but am not sure if it is the best book to get started on philosophy (plus, the book has some mixed reviews). I also checked The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, which seems to be unanimously good, but has the format of dictionary/encyclopaedia, which is not exactly what I am looking for (at least as a main source). The Philosopher's Toolkit also seems to be a good introduction regarding how to do philosophy, rather than to its history and ideals (this also interests me, but I'd rather learn about the philosophers and their theories first)."
