        "text": "About the course\n\nPhilosophy and Theology brings together some of the most important approaches to understanding and assessing the intellectual claims of religion.\n\nThe study of Philosophy develops analytical rigour and the ability to criticise and reason logically. It allows you to apply these skills to many contemporary and historical schools of thought and individual thinkers. You will also apply these skills to questions ranging from how we acquire knowledge and form moral judgements to central questions in the philosophy of religion, including the existence and nature of God and the relevance of religion to human life.\n\nThe study of Theology provides an understanding of the intellectual underpinning of religious traditions and of the social and cultural contexts for religious belief and practice. It brings together a wide range of skills and disciplines, historical, textual, linguistic, sociological, literary-critical and philosophical.\n\nCentral to this degree is a recognition that parallel study of these related disciplines leads to a deeper understanding of each.\n\nThe Philosophy Faculty is the largest in the UK and one of the largest in the world. Many faculty members have a worldwide reputation, and its library and other facilities are acknowledged as among the best in the country.\n\nThe Faculty of Theology and Religion includes more than 100 academics, including experts in the ancient languages and literature of the world’s religions, historians and systematic theologians. The Faculty’s reputation and excellent library facilities attract scholars from all over the world.\n\nAstrophoria Foundation Year\n\nIf you’re interested in studying Philosophy and Theology but your personal or educational circumstances have meant you are unlikely to achieve the grades typically required for Oxford courses, then applying for a Foundation Year might be right for you.\n\nVisit our Foundation Year course pages for more details.\n\nUnistats information\n\nDiscover Uni course data provides applicants with Unistats statistics about undergraduate life at Oxford for a particular undergraduate course.\n\nPlease select 'see course data' to view the full Unistats data for Philosophy and Theology.\n\nPlease note that there may be no data available if the number of course participants is very small.\n\nVisit the Studying at Oxford section of this page for a more general insight into what studying here is likely to be like.\n\nPhilosophy and Theology\n\nA typical week\n\nYour weekly timetable will be divided between one or two tutorials, which may take place at your college or at the college of a specialist tutor. A large part of your week will be spent in independent study to prepare for tutorials. Each week you will also attend up to six lectures, or small classes for some course options.\n\nTutorials usually involve two students and a tutor. Class sizes may vary depending on the options you choose, but there would usually be no more than around 10 students.\n\nMost tutorials, classes, and lectures are delivered by academics who are specialists in their subject. Many are world-leading experts with years of experience in teaching and research. Some teaching may also be delivered by advanced postgraduate students.\n\nTo find out more about how our teaching year is structured, visit our Academic Year page.\n\nCourse structure\n\nYear 1\n\nCourses\n\nAssessment\n\nFour papers are taken:\n\nGeneral philosophy\n\nLogic and moral philosophy\n\nThe figure of Jesus through the centuries\n\nAnd one of the following:\n\nIntroduction to the study of the Bible\n\nReligion and religions\n\nBiblical Hebrew\n\nChurch Latin\n\nNew Testament Greek\n\nQur’anic Arabic\n\nPali\n\nSanskrit\n\nFirst University examinations: four papers each assessed by written examination\n\nYears 2 and 3\n\nCourses\n\nAssessment\n\nStudents take eight papers, either five in Philosophy and three in Theology, or five in Theology and three in Philosophy, or four in each subject.

References should comment primarily on academic performance.\n\nIn interviews, tutors look for interest in the proposed fields of study, a critical and analytical approach to abstract questions and the ability to defend a viewpoint by reasoned argument.\n\nYou may be asked to consider a religious, philosophical or ethical question or to study a brief text. Whatever the subject of discussion, interviewers are interested in how you think and how you approach questions. Students are not expected to have prior subject knowledge.\n\nVisit the Philosophy website and the Theology and Religion website for more detail on the selection criteria for this course.\n\nCareers\n\nPhilosophy and Theology graduates have secured wide-ranging positions as authors, writers, newspaper and periodical editors, academics and teachers.\n\nRecent graduates include a barrister, a member of a political think tank, a student at the Royal Academy of Music and a marketing executive for a philanthropy adviser.\n\nOthers have entered careers such as commerce, banking, financial services and communications. Visit the Theology and Religion Faculty website for more information about careers.\n\nJohn, now a KC says:\n\n‘I could not recommend Philosophy and Theology at Oxford more highly. It was such a wide-ranging \"Liberal Arts\" type degree with so many subject options. On a practical level theology encourages deep thought and creative thinking whilst my philosophical tutors taught me to question and doubt every claim. That was an ideal preparation for the Bar.’"
