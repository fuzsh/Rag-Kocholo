        "text": "In his dialogue Cratylus, the Greek philosopher Plato (428/427–348/347 bc) identified a fundamental problem regarding language. If the connection between words and things is entirely arbitrary or conventional, as it seems to be, it is difficult to understand how language enables human beings to gain knowledge or understanding of the world. As William Shakespeare (1564–1616) later put the difficulty: “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” According to this view, words do nothing to disclose the natures of things: they are merely other things, to set alongside roses and the rest, without any cognitive value in themselves. This indeed was how they were regarded by Plato’s adversaries, the Sophists, who viewed language merely as a tool for influencing people, as in law courts and assemblies.\n\nIf this kind of skepticism seems natural, it is because conventionalism about names is closely related to conventionalism about truth. A person who says that animal is a tiger seems to communicate only that the thing he names as that animal falls into the class of things he names as tiger. But if it is arbitrary or conventional which class of things tiger names, how does his statement communicate any real knowledge?\n\nPlato thought that the only possible explanation is to suppose that words are by nature connected to the things they name. This view survives in some religious traditions, which hold that it is impious to speak the name of God, and equally in fairy tales like Rumpelstiltskin, where to gain the dwarf’s name is to gain power over him. It is also closely related to the ideal of plain or self-interpreting speech, as well as to the notion that some languages display an enviable “closeness” to the nature of things. This is in fact what the 20th-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) supposed of pre-Socratic Greek, and it is also suggested in Orwell’s metaphor of language as a windowpane.\n\nPlato was sometimes inclined to think that knowledge and understanding are possible independently of language. He was characteristically wary of the power of words, which the Sophists relied upon—hence his mistrust of rhetoric and his banishment of poets and artists from the ideal state he described in the Republic. He preferred to think instead of the naked encounter of the properly trained mind with the Forms, or essences, of things. Language could only be an unwanted third party in such a confrontation. At other times, however, Plato seemed to recognize that this view is inadequate: in the late dialogue Parmenides, for example, he returned to the issue of the correctness of words, though he failed to provide any clear account of how they manage to express knowledge or aid reason.\n\nTraditional questions\n\nAfter the death of Aristotle (384–322 bc), Plato’s greatest student, problems in the philosophy of language tended to fall into one or the other of two broad categories. The first category concerns the relation between people and language; the second concerns the relation between language and the world. Key problems in the first category include the question of what it means to possess a language, the use of language in understanding and conceptualization, and the nature of communication and interpretation. Since about the mid-20th century the topics of communication and interpretation have been the purview of the philosophical and linguistic discipline of pragmatics; such investigations have been aimed at elucidating the rules and conventions that make communication possible and at describing the varied and complex uses to which language is put (see below Practical and expressive language). Problems in the second category, concerning the relation between language and the world, include the nature of reference, predication, representation, and truth. They are studied primarily in the discipline of semantics, which is also a branch of both philosophy and linguistics.\n\nAlthough the differences between the two categories are clear enough, there are also close relations between them. Knowing what a person says, for example, is a matter of knowing what truth (or falsehood) his words convey; so communication itself requires cognizance of the connection between language and the world. Similarly, a philosophical view of truth in a certain area of discourse may have implications for a conception of what communication in that area consists of. If one is skeptical about the possibility of truth in ethics, for example, one is more likely to think of ethical communication as a kind of persuasion or prescription than as a means of conveying genuine knowledge. Conversely, a certain attitude toward the rules or conventions governing communication may have implications for one’s conception of reference or truth. If one thinks of the conventions as vague or fluid, one will be less likely to see truth as a crisp, all-or-nothing affair. Often this interplay means that there is no consensus on what should be the entry point—the first or basic task—of the philosophy of language.\n\nWords and ideas\n\nIf one thinks of minds as stocked with ideas and concepts prior to or independently of language, then it might seem that the only function language could have is to make those ideas and concepts public. This was the view of Aristotle, who wrote that “spoken words are signs of concepts.” It was also the view of the English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704), who asserted that God made human beings capable of articulate sound. This capacity, however, does not by itself constitute having a language, since articulate sounds are produced even by parrots, as Locke himself noted. In order for human beings to have language, therefore,\n\nit was further necessary that [man] should be able to use these sounds as signs of internal conceptions, and to make them stand as marks for the ideas within his own mind; whereby they might be made known to others, and the thoughts of men’s minds be conveyed from one to another.\n\nAccording to this conception, words are simply vehicles for ideas, which have an independent, self-sustaining existence. To use another metaphor, although words may be the midwives of ideas, their true parents are experience and reason. Leibniz suggested the same model, writing that “languages are the best mirror of the human mind.”\n\nIt was typical of Locke to see words as devices more for veiling truth than for revealing it. In his view, words have little or no cognitive function; indeed, they interfere with the direct contact possible between the mind and the light of truth. Understanding and knowledge are private possessions, the fruit of an individual’s labour in conforming his ideas to reason and experience. Hence, listening to the words of others yields not knowledge but only opinion. The contrary view—that ideas, as the creatures of words, are public possessions and essential instruments of public knowledge—did not become common in the philosophy of language until the end of the 19th century.\n\nLocke’s picture of the independent existence of ideas did not imply any particular answer to the question of whether language is shaped by the mind or the mind shaped by language. However, the intellectual climate of 18th-century Europe, shaped by increasing exposure to the histories and cultures of peoples outside the continent, tended to favour the second alternative over the first. Thus, the considerable differences between European and non-European languages and the difficulty initially involved in translating between them cast doubt on the existence of any universal stock of ideas, or any universal way of categorizing experience in terms of such ideas. They suggested instead that linguistic habits determine not only how people describe the world but also how they experience it and think about it.\n\nThe first linguistic theorist to affirm this priority explicitly was Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), whose approach eventually culminated in the celebrated “Sapir-Whorf hypothesis,” formulated by the American linguists Edward Sapir (1884–1939) and Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897–1941) on the basis of their work on the diverse (and disappearing) indigenous languages of North America. Their conjecture, in Sapir’s words, was:\n\nHuman beings do not live in the objective world alone…but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society. The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached.\n\nAccording to a weak interpretation of this hypothesis, language influences thought in such a way that translation and shared understanding are difficult but not impossible. Different languages are at varying “distances” from each other, and the difficulty of saying in one what can be said easily in another is the measure of the distance between them. According to its strongest interpretation, the hypothesis implies linguistic conceptual relativism, or “linguistic relativity,” the idea that language so completely determines the thoughts of its users that there can be no common conceptual scheme between people speaking different languages. It also implies linguistic idealism, the idea that people cannot know anything that does not conform with the particular conceptual scheme their language determines.\n\nAlthough many philosophers have been disconcerted by this picture, others have found it appealing, notably Nelson Goodman in the United States and advocates of deconstruction and philosophical postmodernism in France and elsewhere. It was influentially opposed, on the other hand, by the American philosopher Donald Davidson (1917–2003). Davidson argued that, because translation or interpretation necessarily involves the attribution of beliefs and desires to speakers and because such attributions necessarily assume that speakers are right about most things most of the time, one cannot assign meanings to the utterances of others unless one already shares a conceptual scheme with them. Indeed, unless interpretation on the basis of a common conceptual scheme is possible, one cannot view others as “thinking” at all. Hence, one cannot treat his own conceptual scheme as just one among many. With linguistic relativism thus disposed of, the threat of linguistic idealism also is removed.\n\nDavidson’s argument is certainly bold. But it is rather like arguing that, since noises sufficiently unlike Mozart’s music do not count as music, there is no music other than Mozart’s. Davidson seems to deny that knowledge of any radically different form of life is possible: there can be no genuine expansion of a conceptual scheme, only a translation or interpretation of it into a new language. For this reason, therefore, it is quite possible to view Davidson’s argument not as a solution to the relativistic predicament but as a testament to its depth."
