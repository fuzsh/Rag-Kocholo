        "text": "I read that article on Friday when I got the link in an email (as part of a running joke about management; the sender thought he had management spot on). I don’t see anything wrong with any of his points, though he seems to run out of steam toward the end.\n\nHe says, pretty unequivocally, that everyone deserves equal toleration. That’s perfectly sensible. It’s self evident that equal respect cannot be: respect, by definition, is extended to only a few people by each of us. Even Geras says, “In so far as we speak of equal respect, we usually mean respect for individuals as persons, for their humanity and for their rights in virtue of their human status.” ‘Toleration’ is a much more fitting word for that. No one is entitled to respect. You have to earn it. Duh. So Van Gogh etc were ‘entitled’ to none at all. And if you think Socrates had earned respect, maybe you read a different Plato from me.\n\nBut for all that, I use ‘respect’ as a much stronger word than you. I ‘respect’ excellence, and nothing less; CB clearly uses ‘respect’ for middling ability, so it’s a question of semantics.\n\nBut with all due respect, surely we do ignore such people (from the culinary point of view, at least)?\n\nNo — at least I don’t ignore such people if I know them and there’s a possibility that I might find themselves at their table. If someone I know is a good cook, then I’ll respect them for it, even if their influence doesn’t extend beyond their immediate circle. I don’t usually get to eat cooking at Escoffier’s level anyway.\n\nAnd Blackburn by his choice of examples makes it clear that he’s talking about respecting those around you. He says “I am lucky if my neighbours tolerate my singing when in the garden, but they would have to be tone deaf to respect it, and if they did then of course they in turn would forfeit my respect as music critics.” Which may be true because he (like me) is no good at all at singing. But if (like one of my colleagues) he were a good singer without rising to the level of Chaliapin or Louis Armstrong, then I would enjoy his singing when I had the chance to listen to it, and I would respect him for being a good singer.\n\nhas anyone here read darwall’s “two kinds of respect”?\n\nblackburn’s right on here. i hardly think that he is advocating some sort of free-floating hatred or denigration of those who do not depart from the norm. and yes, there is such thing as a norm.\n\nalso, why does being nice to your friends, developing hobbies, and other stuff like that have to make one an expert? i’m a good cook, and i like to cook for friends. i enjoy basking in their praise. but in the end, i am probably barely better at cooking than the norm. so i’m no expert and i deserve no special respect for my cooking.\n\nbut what i think is really going on here is that you all are so afraid of not being the SO FREAKING AWESOME that any time someone comes along and speaks with authority gained from talent and/or hard work, you get scared that your FREAKING AWESOMENESS is being threatened and then you froth and moan.\n\nAnd Blackburn by his choice of examples makes it clear that heâ€™s talking about respecting those around you. He says â€œI am lucky if my neighbours tolerate my singing when in the garden, but they would have to be tone deaf to respect it, and if they did then of course they in turn would forfeit my respect as music critics.â€\n\nThis is “respect” as defined by a successful white male academic who has a leafy garden in an affluent university town. If this point is to be valid he needs to acknowledge that most people are much more at the pointy end of respect. People of Middle Eastern Appearance, for instance. People who look poor. Overweight women.\n\nI don’t get the definition of “respect” that seems to have overtaken this thread, either. I thought it was a principle pretty much based on not making assumptions of your own superiority, recognising the humanity of others who are different, and treating humans as an end rather than a means. I didn’t think they had to work up some kind of party trick to “earn” it.\n\nAnd despite the commenter in #15, if you start life in an affluent society with supportive well read parents, you are likely to accumulate more and flashier party tricks as you go with less effort on your part.\n\nEngels, of course it’s impossible to respect someone you’ve never heard of — so I’m not going to respect the ordinary good cooks and loving parents of East Devonshire or some other random place I’ve never been, just because I don’t know them. It looks like in #16 you’re saying that ordinary good cooks are worthy of respect, which I agree with (and as per #14 that the testimony of others can provide evidence for this but isn’t infallible).\n\nI guess this goes back to Chris’s original talk about people who are “rated as” good cooks — what’s important there, I think, is not the rating, it’s whether they actually are good cooks even if they don’t rise to the level of Blackburn’s few elite. And it seems pretty clear to me that Blackburn means to denigrate everyone but the tippy top few; since he leaves no middle ground between respect and tolerance, and says that those who do not strive to be super-elite deserve to be ignored.\n\nAnd of course Helen is right that everyone deserves respect just by virtue of being human. But even on Blackburn’s own terms his view is absurd.\n\nI think the piece Chris linked to is intended to be a humorously opinionated rant, not an attack on modern civilisation.\n\nIf you look at this piece, where Blackburn deals with ‘respect’ at greater length, I think he says that everyone is entitled to respect in some sense, but that there is a ‘thicker’ sense in which they are not.\n\nI don’t agree with all of his views about this, or sympathise with all of the piques he airs in this piece, but I am pretty sure he isn’t the far-right-wing ogre that people here are assuming he is. (And I think he might possibly have been aware of the contradiction you point out in #28…)\n\nI think much of this kerfuffle would go away if someone answered matt’s remark in #17 about whether anyone has read Darwall’s “Two Kinds of Respect”.\n\nI’ve read it a couple of times. It’s in a 1977 issue of Ethics and is a justly well-known piece. In it he distinguishes between recognition respect and appraisal respect. Roughly (I’m working from memory here) recognition respect is the respect you ought to have for someone in virtue of some capacity that more or less everyone has. E.g., rational agency, the ability to guide oneself by moral precepts, free will, something like that. We recognize-respect someone when there are certain ways we treat him in virtue of his capacity/faculty/whatever. Generally, recognition-respecting someone requires us not to in any way harm or go against that capacity in virtue of which he is entitled to recognition respect.\n\nAppraisal respect seems to be what Blackburn has in mind. Appraisal respect is the kind of respect we give to someone in virtue of some excellence, or something like that. So, I appraisal-respect LeBron James in virtue of his basketball-playing abilities, but it would be ridiculous to appraisal-respect Blackburn for his singing abilities. Appraisal-respecting, by the way, amounts to some attitude and/or behavior like esteeming, honoring, praising, etc.\n\nIt might be worth making the point that a very swift way to be disrespected is to make your skill a means for despising people who do not possess it. Education in the service of elitism is very often no education at all: it’s the promotion of ignorance about the lives and capacities of other people. If your learning leads you to loathe people who don’t possess your level of learning, how, in fact, does it benefit you, let alone anybody else?\n\nMoreover it’s a completely unnecessary approach to take because many or most people will, I think, have great respect for great ability. Those who do not are ignroant and they can be ignored: ignorance is an attitude, not a quantity of knowledge.\n\nI’m a decent standard chessplayer – in the top 300 English players, very good by the standard of the average players, almost magically good by the standards of the man in the street. But compared to Blackburn’s elite, I can barely pick up th pieces – the standard I’ve achieved is merely sufficient to give me an inkling as to how gooid the elite really are. My respect for them, therefore, isn’t just enormous: it’s made greater still my own small accomplishment. But if a leading chessplayer was to employ that difference to express contempt for me, for my abilities or for my worth as a person the respect would instantly disappear. And this isn’t at all unusual in the world of elite chess, or, indeed, among elites in general: once you’re in that position it can be very hard to consider other people as essentially your equals. It’s not about jealousy or about excessive egalitarianism, it’s about arrogance.\n\ni suppose if it were anyone besides Blackburn what would surprise me most is the implicit condescension in assuming that large numbers of political philosophers would be stupid enough to espouse anything like the view he’s denigrating.\n\nbasic charity should have prompted him to think, “gosh, it sure would be idiotic for all these people to think that everyone’s efforts in every pursuit are just as good as everyone else’s… i wonder if something else is going on? like, maybe they’re using respect in a different sense the one i am?” perhaps Blackburn’s areas of expertise do not include identifying strawmen?\n\nyou’d think he’d at least be familiar enough with Kant to come up with (at least one version of) the relevant distinction on his own. it concerns me that this man has written a dictionary of philosophy.\n\nRe # 49:\n\nThe original of the song was Otis’s, and for him ‘respect’ meant getting laid when he got home from the road. Not, as I recall, a sense Darwall discusses in his article.\n\nAretha apparently denied, when asked by Dick Cavett on TV, that the song is about sex. (So what are all the “Sock it to me”s in her version about, then?) So much for the idea that you have to understand a lyric to sing it well.\n\nAnd on the original Blackburn post: Chris and others can’t deny that if what’s at issue is appraisal-respect — which it clearly it is — then Blackburn’s main point that people don’t deserve equal respect is uncontroversially true. The claim of his that has generated the criticism — that most people don’t deserve any appraisal-respect at all — is an inessential add-on that he could give up without changing his main point at all.\n\nAnd I do think there’s some tendency in the culture to blur recognition- and appraisal-respect, and to conclude that because people are owed equal respect in the one sense they’re owed equal respect in the other. Talk to any C students recently?\n\nWill (41):\n\nActually, T-Rex’s creator is trained in something called “computational linguistics” (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_North), so you may be right.\n\nThere’s nothing patently ridiculous in calling into question the common sense view that there is a form of respect that is owed to all persons on the basis of ability not performance.\n\nWhy, for example, ought I respect someone for possessing a capacity “for moral reasoning…etc” rather than for making use of it? What, for example, has a total dimwit done to deserve greater respect than a zucchini or a fruitfly? (Or the fruitfly to deserve less?) (Of course, there are no _total_ dimwits, so in practice all humans merit some degree of respect for some degree of exercise of their rational capacity.)\n\nWhy should we assume it’s impossible for a person to justly lose all of my respect, indicating that a right to respect may not be essential to human nature? Indeed, if it is essential, what does it pick out, what work does it do? I.e., what does granting such respect involve, and what would failing to grant it look like?\n\nIf the answer is of the “treat as ends, not means” variety, I’d suggest this isn’t clearly an issue of respect, but treating things as what they are. A human should not be treated as a means because she IS an end, not because she “deserves” to be treated so.\n\nIn fact, the Kantian version to which many of these objections implicitly appeal is much more consistent. Kant demands we respect the humanity universally possessed by individuals, not the individual as such. On the contrary, the individual deserves respect only insofar as she acts from duty, thus exercising her autonomy–there’s no merit in merely having the capacity.\n\nAs for Blackburn’s claim that very few human beings are good at anything, I think he means this in the most unqualified sense (the same sense, e.g., that underlies Hobbes’ account of the state of nature), in which case it’s true. Measured in relation to abilities of the entire human population throughout human history (as opposed to, say, the best cook among my acquaintances), most “excellences” are minor to the point of triviality.\n\nHowever, I’d add that such a big picture perspective exposes the silliness of the perfectionist obsession with “excellence” that Blackburn seems to share. Yes, very few humans are good at anything, but being good at anything in this exacting sense isn’t worth a whole hell of a lot–isn’t, so to speak, all that good.\n\nqb,\n\nI don’t disagree with the basic point of view you’ve presented, but can’t help but quibble with the implication that “treating person as ends” is the same as “respecting” them or seeing them as “entitled to respect.” It’s simply treating them as what they are, or acting in accordance with recognition of their nature, whereas respect seems to suggest an attribution of distinctive value (e.g., that a human being is intrinsically worth more than other creatures, or that one form of human behavior is more valuable than another, etc.).\n\nI’ll accept that we should treat all human beings as human beings and that all human beings are entitled to be treated as human beings. But I think describing this as “respect” is misleading, because of its connotations of value. Hurka’s post identifies very well one way it misleads: into a conflation or confusion of recognition respect and appraisal respect.\n\nBut I don’t think that’s a mistake in judgment, but in the conception of “recognition respect.” I don’t see a close enough resemblance between these two kinds of behavior (treating a thing as the kind of thing it is vs. according it value, praiseworthiness and, possibly, moral responsibility) to call them both forms of “respect.”\n\nThis is relevant to Blackburn’s claims since he is surely, in part, complaining (rightly or wrongly) that we often give people more credit, or respect, than they deserve, and justify doing so out of an appeal to so-called recognition respect (“equal respect,” in his words). So, he is not objecting to treating ordinary persons who are not “good at anything” as ends rather than means, and consequently that cannot serve as the basis of an objection to his claims.\n\nShouldn’t some of the other claims in Blackburn’s piece be provoking more outrage? What about his assertions that:\n\n#6) democracy is of no value anywhere outside of Europe [even in Canada?]\n\n#8) celebrities have forfeit the right to ‘any respect at all’ [in contradiction to Article 8 of ECHR!]\n\n#10) that ‘idea that sometimes people will do something because it is the right thing to do, not because it affords them any advantage’ is now a myth [unfairly denigrating all those who have ever helped old ladies across the road or returned lost wallets, among many others no doubt…]\n\nOn a strictly literal reading aren’t these are even more absurd, pathetically dumb, and dishonest than the one originally quoted?\n\nck,\n\ni think i see your point, although i’m not sure that appraisal respect is any closer to the ordinary meaning of the term “respect” than is recognition respect (consider the concept as it is used in relation to authority figures, for example). and i agree with your endorsement of Hurka’s post, especially where he says,\n\n“if whatâ€™s at issue is appraisal-respectâ€”which it clearly it isâ€”then Blackburnâ€™s main point that people donâ€™t deserve equal respect is uncontroversially true.”\n\nwhat’s irritating about Blackburn’s statement, to me, is not that he’s claimed that not many people are good at things (although the threshold he’s setting for “good” here does seem a tad misanthropic). it’s that in setting himself up to be disabusing his readers of what is obviously false he makes his claim disingenuously controversial by equivocating on the very distinction at issue.\n\nby pretending, or by simply failing to realize, that philosophers have good reason to think people should be treated “in accordance with” their moral status as human persons, and that we are all equally entitled to be treated in that way, Blackburn tempts his popular readership into making the same equivocation.\n\nin other words, it isn’t a myth that “everyone should be praised the same regardless of their level of effort or success,” because nobody really believes that. but nor is it a myth that “everybody should be treated with the same dignity qua human beings,” because that’s actually true.\n\nRe: 69\n\nSure it’s a joke, but jokes are no laughing matter. (That’s meant as a joke.) Granted, it’s intended as a humorous piece, but that’s no reason we cannot critically evaluate the author’s implied views.\n\nRe: 67\n\n#8 seems non-controversial, while #6 is surely meant entirely in jest. I can’t imagine he would seriously except any democracy, much less England’s, from the charge.\n\nI am having difficulty determining what views might be implied by #10. Perhaps it is something in the vein of J.S. Mill–we only pursue happiness for its own sake, but it is an achievement of social existence that virtue has been made into a part of our happiness, thus allowing us, in a roundabout way, to pursue virtue for its own sake. Blackburn’s plausible addition is to suggest that the political and economic ideology of egoism can undo this achievement.\n\nFor the record I agree with the sentiments expressed in #18, #55 and #56 above, of course. I’m just not sure that Blackburn wouldn’t either. It might be worth noting that the only example he gave of people who he considers unworthy of respect was celebrities, which makes it seem rather unlikely that he is advocating the veneration of worldly success…\n\nAs I understand it, the suggestion is that we should deny appraisal respect to those in our own communities who are better at things because we now live in a world where we have access to the knowledge that there are other people out there in the larger world who are even better. â€œI used to respect you as an excellent cook, but then I got The Food Network.â€ That seems like a transparently silly position for a number of fairly obvious reasons.\n\nIsn’t this the experience a lot of people have when they start Uni? I think I did, with regard to appraisal-respect that had been directed at myself and probably my school friends too…\n\nAlso\n\n(1) The very few human beings who are good at anything, whether football or playing the violin or writing or painting, form an elite and deserve respect for their excellence. (Blackburn)\n\narguably doesn’t imply that\n\n(2) very few human beings â€¦ are good at anything (Chris’ post)\n\nsince (1) may mean that for any one thing–football, playing violin, …, …–very few people are good at it and they form an elite. But the total number of people in the union of all these sets–the number of people who are good at anything at all–must be much larger.\n\nThat would leave Blackburn able to allow (with the nice, respectful people here) that most people are good at something, while maintaining the strict reading of the paragraph Chris cites, provided that he could defend his claim that for any given thing, very few people are good at it (which I agree is still controversial…)\n\n57,\n\n” ‘I used to respect you as an excellent cook, but then I got The Food Network.’ That seems like a transparently silly position for a number of fairly obvious reasons.”\n\nI don’t know that this is so obviously silly, since determining excellence is fundamentally comparative–as experience of cases to compare to expands, early evaluations tend to lower. Isn’t this the case with most aesthetic evaluations, and rightly so? If “excellent cook” means “best among my friends,” then this would make sense. But why would “excellent” = “best of an arbitrarily narrow group”?\n\n76,\n\n“Science is the study of facts and philosophy the study of values.” This is a highly eccentric view of philosophy. One way of thinking of philosophy is as the critical examination of common prejudices, in which case the column, despite significant faults, is surely in his field of expertise.\n\n77,\n\n“That would leave Blackburn able to allow (with the nice, respectful people here) that most people are good at something.” It would, but I suspect he doesn’t want that allowance. Part of his purpose seems to be to deflate our sense of self importance (though not so clearly his own). I’ll applaud his willingness to acknowledge most of us aren’t good at anything in a substantial enough way for it to merit general acknowledgement (sure, my friends should acknowledge I’m a good cook, but columnists and philosophers don’t need to), but it’s annoying that he doesn’t clearly include himself in this group. But wouldn’t it be equally annoying, somewhat kindergarteny and condscending, if he started with: “Now I know each of you are special in your own way, but…”\n\n78,\n\n“since (i assume) being a celebrity and being good at anything are not mutually exclusive.”\n\nI think Blackburn’s intended joke is that he’s defining “celebrity” as one who is famous for no good reason, or famous for being famous, as is often the case these days, in which case celebrity is a strong indicator of being good at nothing in particular–since otherwise one would be famous for that ability. So, the implied meaning is, I believe, correct.\n\n79, celebrity is a strong indicator of being good at nothing in particularâ€”since otherwise one would be famous for that ability\n\ndoubly false.\n\nfirst, the reasons people achieve celebrity are independent of whether or not they are worthy of respect. for example, my genius in chemistry is often overlooked because of my renown as a supermodel–the people who like to look at my photos in popular magazines simply do not care about my genius-level intellect, and so I am not famous for that quality, etc, etc.\n\nsecond, i take it the standard for being good at something cannot be so high that one ought to be worthy of fame in order to be worthy of respect. suppose my magazine viewers really would care if i were a genius at chemistry, but it turns out that i am merely very good at it. i would not be famous if it weren’t for my kickin’ hot bod, but i would still be worthy of respect for my chemistry skills.\n\nwhether celebrities often have hidden talents is an empirical question, but i see no reason to suspect that they are any less worthy of respect, on average, than anyone else.\n\nWow, 76 is a really classic Edenbaum provocation.\n\nFollow the bouncing ball:\n\nFirst, the “playful” suggestion that CT readers are unlikely to follow his argument.\n\nScience is the study of facts and philosophy the study of values.\n\nThen the undergrad-profoud generality that purports to be the fundamental premise that everybody else has overlooked.\n\nConflating the two in favor of facts, values become assumed.\n\nThen the simple error that all of us trapped in a pre-Edenbaumian liberal academic mindset mindlessly repeat.\n\nValues assumed, all questions are seen as those of expertise. Terms of measurement- also assumed. Curiosity is defined by the frame, values by the frame, moral worth by the frame.\n\nDemocracy, the multiplicity of values and goals, is undermined.\n\nSpice it up with the anti-intellectual resentment with which Seth peppers his stews by the handful (oh, those so-called “experts”! sniff) and finish with the shocking but now unavoidable conclusion that merely by participating in this discussion, we are undrmining the very politics we claim to support.\n\nBlackburnâ€™s is the linguistic and philosophical (formalist) corollary to Law and Economics.\n\nNow, the turn — a polymathic shift to something totally unrelated, the connection to which only an Edenbaum could have seen. Yes, it sounds like random phrase-dropping, but that’s only because we’re too slow to follow the leaps and twirls of his mind.\n\nIâ€™ll remind you of the fun I had with Colin McGinn\n\nAnd finally the little smug pat on his own back and reminder to the rest of us of how much we’re missing by not keeping up with the Edenbaum opus.\n\n” ‘Science is the study of facts and philosophy the study of values.’ This is a highly eccentric view of philosophy.One way of thinking of philosophy is as the critical examination of common prejudices…”\n\nCritical examination of common prejudices without examining your own can seem logical only if you choose to see such things as external to yourself, as apart and other. The foundational analogy here, and analogy is all it is, is to science. The values behind the deployment that analogy are not the values claimed by those who deploy it. If they paid more attention to their own prejudices, looking at the historical parallels, that would be clear even to them. Maybe I should have said ‘Science is the study of facts and philosophy the argument over values.’\n\nThat would have been clearer.\n\nThe formal analysis of language is seen as equivalent to the formal analysis of numbers. The moral values, the moral argument behind mathematical formalism is the moral argument of Platonism. I won’t argue one way or the other about numbers, but the moral logic of Platonism in language is authoritarian.\n\n“76 was still really annoying, tho.”\n\n25 years ago when I began trying to argue these points, then in the context of contemporary art and politics, the response was either contemptuous dismissal or silence. That hasn’t changed.\n\nWhen Steven Weinberg writes a book titled “Science and Its Cultural Adversaries” and includes as one of its chapters “Zionism and Its Adversaries” he’s using the literary form of analogy no different than that used by Alan Sokal in “Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity.” Sokal’s piece was written as a Hoax. Is Weinberg’s?\n\nI’m sick of Platonists who want to ban poetry and defend their arguments with literary devices. I’m sick of Catholics who say they’re atheists and of elitist academics who call themselves leftists intellectuals.\n\nBlackburn is arrogant and disrespectful. So is McGinn. So is Tyler Cowen, the smiling economic [social] Darwinist. So are all the people I get in fights with. So am I. But I don’t hide behind numbers. Cowen says “Don’t hate me I’m just the messenger. Don’t hate reason”.\n\nI admit it, I’m unreasonable. But I’m not here for friendship I’m here for revenge. Hate the messenger all you want, I win my cases."
