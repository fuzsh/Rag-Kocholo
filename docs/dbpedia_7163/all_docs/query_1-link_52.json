Philosophy since the Romantic period has put Agency at the centre of the stage. The age of Insight is over. Philosophers no longer tell a story of us as made in God's image, as spirits of his house, as insightful spectators of the world that He has given us through grace. This is the age of The Agent in the Void, in which we see ourselves us as merely the by-product of natural chemical processes (hence The Void), and as creators of our own world, and hence as creatures most deeply defined by what they do.\n\nAcross philosophy you can read it: Mind? Minds are defined by their behaviour. Meaning? Meaning is rooted in human practices. Necessity? A construction of the human mind, a consequence of human choices. And so on, and so forth. Wherever you look, the concept of us as most fundamentally agents is what rules our philosophy.\n\nAnd the problem? Just as the scientific image left no place for God, nor does it seem to leave any room for agency. And if you add that thought to our self-image as fleshed out by the philosophers of our time, it turns out that we are......nothing.\n\nSo this one matters.\n\nWe shall (perhaps artificially, but who cares? We can do what we want, can't we?) divide the topic into two parts. First, the pure metaphysical debate, Free Will versus Determinism. And second, Determinism and Responsibility.\n\nModel Essays\n\nThis page offers occasional essays - written by your contemporaries - judged to be of sufficient quality to serve as models.\n\nSo far we have three.\n\nOne on Determinism and Responsibility.\n\nOne on Induction\n\nAnd one on The Goodman Paradox\n\nHow to read and write Philosophy\n\nOne day I will lay out my own thoughts on the matter. If only because Oxford tutorial essays are a rather specialized philosophical art. But for now I link you to some excellent pages maintained by a nice man at Princeton. Have a good look around his site. His advice is designed for people writing American term papers, which are assessed, and where you have a good deal of time to think about your material and polish your final draft. So you will have to regretfully ignore the excellent advice on taking your time.\n\nHow to think about ...\n\nHere you will find avuncular advice on various philosophical matters. So far there are no pages at all, but if people e-mail sensible requests, I will post some."
