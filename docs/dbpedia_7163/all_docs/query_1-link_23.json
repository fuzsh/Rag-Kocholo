        "text": "Truth: A Guide for the Perplexedby Simon Blackburn\n\n210pp, Allen Lane, Â£12.99\n\nIn his keynote campaign speech delivered prior to the Vatican election, the man who would be pope, Cardinal Ratzinger, startled the world, or that section of it that was bothered to listen to him, with a tirade against what he saw as a modern-day surrender to relativism. We might have expected and certainly would not have been surprised by an abjuration of concupiscence and lust, say - although it is true that as Benedict XVI he did fulminate against the \"filth\" afflicting even his own church, and when a Catholic cleric uses such words we know he is talking about sex - but on the face of it relativism might have seemed pretty low down in the peccancy order. Not so, and certainly not so if, as the cardinal did, you have spent the past few decades heading up what used to be known as the Inquisition.\n\nThe point for Papa Ratzi, as the friskier outlets of the Italian media lost no time in dubbing him, is that relativism, however wishy-washy and New Ageist it may seem to the rest of us, strikes at the very foundation stone of the church, which is the conviction that there exist truths which are eternal, unchallengeable and verified by faith - in a word, absolute. Without absolute truths, and the reiterated insistence of their enduring reality, the Catholic church would have no basis, a fact to which Ratzinger and, we assume, the vast majority of cardinals, were acutely alive when they sealed themselves into the Sistine Chapel to choose a successor to their dead capo di capi.\n\nBut are there absolute truths, outside the cloistered imaginations of the Princes of the Church and their more submissive subjects? One is tempted to adapt Kafka's remark about hope, and say that no doubt there is truth, an infinite amount of truth - but not for us.\n\nSimon Blackburn is professor of philosophy at Cambridge, and the author of fine popularising books such as The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy and Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics. He is learned, astute, admirably sensible, and possesses an elegant and clear prose style. Truth is based on the texts of the Gifford lectures delivered last year at the University of Glasgow, and on other, occasional lectures and articles written over the past four or five years. One would never use the word ragbag to describe a work by such a graceful synthesiser, but some parts of the book have the air of having been shoehorned in, for instance a short, closing chapter defending David Hume's philosophical cosmopolitanism against attacks by the likes of Donald Davidson, and part of another chapter spiritedly repudiating what might be termed Richard Rorty's radical pragmatism; both these excursuses have the air of being frolics of their own.\n\nBlackburn opens his introduction with a rousing call to arms, which might be a preparation for an assault on the likes of Rorty and other \"fuzzy\" - the adjective is Rorty's own - postmodernist philosophers and pundits, and which would likely be much to the taste of the latest Vicar of Christ:\n\n\"There are real standards. We must fight soggy nihilism, scepticism and cynicism. We must not believe that anything goes. We must not believe that all opinion is ideology, that reason is only power, that there is no truth to prevail. Without defences against postmodern irony and cynicism, multiculturalism and relativism, we will all go to hell in a handbasket.\"\n\nImmediately, however, a caveat is entered - indeed, a broad bannerful of caveats is unfurled. Many, Blackburn allows, will regard our beliefs and insistences as mere noise, the crackling of thorns under an empty pot. \"There are people,\" he writes, \"who are not impressed by our conviction, or by our pride and our stately deportment.\" These will include relativists, postmodernists, subjectivists, pragmatists. However, it is Blackburn's intention, he tells us, not to join battle in the philosophy wars but to tread his way delicately among the warring parties, with us at his heels and under his protection. His book, he writes, is \"about a war of ideas and attitudes\".\n\nHe does not state his own position directly - as why should he? - but it may be helpful to the reader to know that he is of the quasi-realist school. If realism holds that there is a world independent of mind and our judgments are based on it, quasi-realism takes the Humean position that our judgments may have no independent object yet that they behave as if they had. This may sound like the have-your-cake-and-eat-it as against the slash-and-burn schools of philosophy, but it is a perfectly sensible position to occupy.\n\nHe opens with the melancholy observation that for the classical sceptic \"a clash of countervailing arguments ... led to peaceful suspension of belief, whereas in our own times it is seen more as a licence for people to believe what they like\". He illustrates this decline much further on in the book, in the pages devoted to opposing the all-accommodating Rorty. For Rorty, language is for \"coping, not copying\", and he sees, as he has written, \"the employment of words as the use of tools to deal with the environment, rather than as an attempt to represent the intrinsic nature of that environment ... \" Blackburn links Rorty with William James, whom Blackburn had earlier accused of flirting with the danger of \"abolishing the distinction between wishful thinking and accuracy\", a danger into which Rorty, in Blackburn's reading, frequently strays with unangelic fearlessness. Rorty is quoted on feminist accounts of the difference between men and women:\n\n\"The question of whether these differences were there (huddled together deep down within the entity, waiting to be brought to light by deconstructing excavators), or are only there in the entity after the feminist has finished reshaping the entity into a social construct nearer her heart's desire, seems to me of no interest whatever.\"\n\nThis displays surely a breathtakingly cavalier attitude to the possible facts of the matter, and sounds remarkably like a Humpty Dumptyan determination that words shall mean what the speaker commands them to mean.\n\nThe sceptical argument that undercuts the quest for truth Blackburn christens the \"variation of subjectivities\", and traces it back to the codification drawn up by Sextus Empiricus in the second or third centuries AD. Sextus posits various modes of scepticism, all of which, Blackburn writes, \"try to show that things appear differently to different sensibilities, that there is no neutral or authoritative decision procedure awarding victory to just one of these; hence that we should suspend judgment about things themselves\". It is the elusiveness of the \"thing itself\", the Kantian Ding an sich, which continues to give philosophers a headache. What may we know, and by what means may we know it?\n\nAt the heart of the book these questions falter almost into silence before the great ice wall that is Nietzsche, the \"arch debunker\", as Blackburn's chapter heading has it. For Nietzsche, \"facts is precisely what there is not, only interpretations\", and \"Truth is the kind of error without which a certain species of life could not live.\" In The Will to Power he states the thing baldly: \"There exists neither 'spirit', nor reason, nor thinking, nor consciousness, nor soul, nor will, nor truth: all are fictions that are of no use.\" We immediately ask, No use to whom? and, If not these fictions, what is there that we can use? But Nietzsche spurns all our querulous wheedlings, and wonders how in our \"constant fluttering around the single flame of vanity ... an honest and pure urge for truth could have arisen among men\".\n\n\"They are deeply immersed in illusions and dream images; their eye glides only over the surface of things and sees \"forms\"; their feeling nowhere leads into truth, but contents itself with the reception of stimuli, playing, as it were, a game of blind man's buff on the backs of things.\"\n\nDespite its subtitle, Truth is less a guide for the perplexed than a guided tour through the philosophical perplexities in which, despite three millennia of hard thinking, man is still mired. Time it is that defeats all our attempts to fix reality, facts, truth. Perhaps it would be possible to glimpse the really existing truth of things if we could halt the onward rush of time, but we cannot, hence we are left floundering in a Heraclitean flux, a blurred immanence which we call reality. For all the excitement of the chase after truth, perhaps we would do best to follow the example of the ancient sceptics, for whom, Blackburn writes, \"it was an admirable consequence of their scepticism that they lost conviction, lost enthusiasm as it were for holding one opinion rather than another. With epoche or suspension of judgment, came the desired ataraxia or tranquillity.\"\n\nOne suspects Professor Blackburn would deplore any such retreat into quietistic bliss, and would instead admonish us with the title of another of his books: Think."
