        "text": "The introduction deals with the ideas of authority and perspective, and how they function properly in the process of Biblical interpretation. A key idea is that reading is a dialogue between the text and the reader. Both sides have a role to play. If we acknowledge this, then we must also acknowledge that the perspective of the reader has some significance in how the Bible is interpreted and exercises authority. This dialogical reading transcends the categories of ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’, and\n\nGod is depicted in the Old Testament with a very bad reputation. David Lamb is an old testament professor and he addresses some of the reasons for this bad reputation. In Lamb’s book, God Behaving Badly: Is the God of the Old Testament Angry, Sexist and Racist? In his book, there are seven specific citations addressed that provide proof and evidence for those who would believe “God behaves badly.” The examples that Professor Lamb chose are: angry or loving, sexist or affirming, racist or hospitable, violent or peaceful, legalistic or gracious, rigid or flexible, and distant or near. With each chapter that Lamb writes, it provides multiple biblical narrative accounts and establishes a basis for the particular argument aimed against God.\n\nThe priest of a Puritan church in 1744, Jonathan Edwards, in his sermon, Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, motivates his congregation to fully convert to Puritanism through the use of fear. Edwards’s purpose is to persuade his audience to change their ways and to commit to the Puritan way of life in order to achieve salvation. He adopts an accusatory tone in order to forewarn his congregation of the wrath of God they will face for their sins if they do not repent. Edwards begins by establishing that “natural men,” or those who have not been reborn religiously, are no better in the eyes of God than those already in Hell, and have the same fate awaiting them (Edwards, 46).\n\nOn July 8th, 1741, a well-known preacher, Jonathan Edwards, delivered an inspiring sermon describing the horrible afterlife the unconverted would have. In 1741, the American colonies were undergoing a period of religious revival which played a large role in the presentation of Edwards’ sermon. Throughout the speech, Edwards’ purpose was to motivate the “natural men” in his congregation to wake up and make a change in their lives. He adopts a blunt and urgent tone in order to convey to his audience the life they are living now is going to result in Hell for their afterlife. Edwards’ use of negative diction, figurative language, and understanding of syntax to imbue the minds of his people with fear and tries to persuade them to convert to Puritanism.\n\nIn Stanley Hauerwas’s article titled “Go with God” he presents a letter to students who are going off to attend college. It’s a guide that proposes certain expectations and helpful information for students heading off on this new endeavor. He makes a point that going to college means much more than a diploma and hopes of high paying job. “To worship God and live faithfully are necessary conditions if you are to survive college. But as a Christian you are called to do more than survive” (Hauerwas). The advice in the letter reinforce its main theme: to be a student is a calling. This challenges the reader to think beyond the normal expectations of why we go off to college.\n\nReligion is a moral code essential to humanity, but it is not the only moral option. Throughout much of history, religion has had a monopoly on what is defining what is morality. However, that monopoly has been destroyed many times. In the 16th century, Martin Luther tore apart the Catholic Church, and in the 17th century, the Age of Reason arose. Two authors who exemplify these two historical events, respectively, are Jonathan Edwards and Benjamin Franklin. Jonathan Edwards was brought up on deeply Calvinist and Lutheran teachings, and was one of the many people responsible for The Great Awakening in America. Benjamin Franklin, although he was also brought up on Calvinist teachings, chose to develop his religious beliefs around reason and argument. The differences and similarities between the religious experiences of Benjamin Franklin and Jonathan Edwards include the way they questioned Christianity, the way in which they viewed themselves, and the way in which they behaved. These traits bear scrutinization for examining how different moral codes may have vastly different effects..\n\nColonial times in America expressed strong religious beliefs. Many were devoted to God and those who weren’t would feel a pressure to. In order to persuade the public into committing to God, speakers would use pathos to impose the fear of God in the individual. To appeal to the community’s fears, Edwards would often exemplify how one’s life hangs in the hands of God, “[God] holds you over the pit hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you and is dreadfully provoked.” (Edwards 50-51). The rhetorical impact of using such metaphor provides the individual a chance to envision his irrelevance, as an inferior creature, in God’s agenda. The life of a sinner is in severe danger, thus frightening the public\n\nHe had claimed that if God was to be all good yet does not possess the power to vanquish evil then logically God can-not be all powerful, similarly if he is indeed all powerful and possess the ability to eliminate all evil then he indeed cannot be all good. Blackburn uses the analogy of a university to explain the claim of the implausibility of God in a more relatable sense. In the university, students live in poor conditions such as leaky roofs and food that is inedible. The university management sits behind a closed office door yet never emerges and as such it would not be logical to assume that the management knows, cares and can do anything about the issues affecting the students. In a logical sense one must come to the same conclusion about such a god – such a being simply can not exist. It would be ignorant to believe so. Blackburn also addresses the claim that God has a different sense of what is good and what is evil by claiming that if the suffering of many around the world for any purpose, such as to test his, hers or its followers then this god is not suitable for moral guidance. However it is important to note that Blackburn does not refute the idea of a god existing, and goes as far as stating that a god may exist but not in a traditional Judeo-Christian form of understanding.\n\nThese individuals are known to be experts of morality. The chapter proposes two reasons as to why these individuals are called upon so frequently. One, for those who believe and have some sort of religious back round, and second, for those who believe in what is called a “scientific view” of the world. This chapter presents the idea that there is some popular belief that religion and morality go hand in hand and that in order to understand morality, you must understand religion. It is explained that when we view morality from a religious perspective, we give meaning to morality in a way that a “good man” made this world that we currently live in and that we are his children. While the book proposes the question that people who believe in God, or a higher power, base their values on what those religions state is right or wrong, whereas for an atheist the question still remains; how do these individuals weigh their moral compass and place their values?\n\nFurthermore, if you cannot have ethics without God, which one of God’s teachings should be following. Should the teachings in the old testament championing an “eye for an eye” be tossed aside in favour of the new testament teaching of us to “turn the other cheek”. If God’s will is good, then it is both morally right to exact revenge, as well as demonstrate forgiveness to an injustice. I argue that this argument challenges the premise that God is omniscient as in the old testament, God commands and permits one act, and in the new testament contradicts and supports an entirely different act. If we follow the DCT and assume that as God’s will is good then both commands are correct, then it is up to the individual to decide which moral action to take. If such freedom is possible in making moral decisions, then divine command may not always be needed to satisfy our moral duties.\n\nGod develops many special relationships with His people throughout the Old Testament. Another word to describe the relationship between God and his people is covenant. The word covenant goes into the details of the relationship. Within the five books of the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy), Historical books, Poetical books, and the Prophet books, one may pick up on the relationships being developed between God and humanity. God has an unconditional love for His people; He is always faithful to them. On the other hand, humanity has more of a conditional relationship with God. Humanity continuously falls short, making the love seem “conditional,” but are given a choice to either follow God into a relationship and receive love and benefits of the covenant or not. “No child of the covenant who presents to Him a faithless and insincere heart shall be included in its blessings.” Going off the idea of love being unconditional and conditional, this paper focuses on how the Old Testament is about God, humanity and their relationship.\n\nMany people tend to equate ethics with their feelings. But being ethical is clearly not a matter of followings one’s feelings. Ethics, however, cannot be confined to religion nor is it the same as religion. Being ethical is not the same as following the law. The law often incorporates ethical standards to which most citizens subscribe. But laws, like feelings, can deviate from what is ethical. Finally, being ethical is not the same as doing “whatever society accepts.” In any society, most people accept standards that are ethical. But standards of behaviour in society can deviate from what is ethical. An entire society can become ethically corrupt. Nazi Germany is good example of a morally corrupt society. What then, is\n\nIn the beginning of the essay writers Isabelle and Meaghan Miller point out two different moralities, one being secular morality, which they define as “human logic or reasoning rather than religion”. And Religious morality “which is based on aspects of religion such as fear of God of the desire to do God’s will”. These moralities suggested, define ways the world views the options given or taught to them in life. Further into the presentation, they state that “moralities lie within biology, not only human but all animals. [Implying that] animals have three basic instincts [such as] kin selection, attachment to mate, and sympathy; morality helps us survive and thrive”. In this case, they 're not only voicing"
