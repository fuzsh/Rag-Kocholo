        "text": "About the course\n\nIf you enjoy mathematical problem-solving, would like to learn about computing and artificial intelligence (AI), but also have wider interests in life and the universe - for example what AI can teach us about ourselves, how it will impact on the world, or how we should react to these huge changes - then this degree might be for you!\n\nBoth computer science and philosophy are intellectually exciting and creative, and they have many mutual connections. The course combines analytical and technical knowledge with discursive, writing and research skills, offering the chance to study with top academics from two internationally acclaimed departments.\n\nThis degree will equip you for a wide range of careers and roles, from the highly technical to the managerial and strategic.\n\n\">Video of Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford University\n\nComputer science is about understanding computer systems at a deep level. Computers and the programs they run are among the most complex products ever created. Designing and using them effectively presents immense challenges. Facing these challenges is the aim of computer science as a practical discipline.\n\nThe study of philosophy develops analytical, critical and logical rigour, applied within a wide range of extremely valuable skills:\n\nanalysing and organising diverse information\n\nunderstanding different points of view\n\narguing a case\n\nimagining novel possibilities and thinking through their consequences.\n\nIt stretches the mind by considering a wide range of ideas on questions as fundamental as the limits of knowledge, the nature of reality and our place in it, and the basis of morality.\n\nTheoretical links between computer science and philosophy go right back to Alan Turing’s invention of the digital computer, and practical links have grown hugely in recent years as computer systems increasingly impact on almost every aspect of our lives: social, commercial, educational, even political. Throughout academia and industry, they provide the media of communication and data processing, and increasingly – through artificial intelligence – solve problems that go beyond our human intellectual capabilities.\n\nAll this raises many difficult issues, both ethical (e.g. data privacy, algorithmic risk assessment, robot behaviour, legal regulation and responsibility) and social (e.g. impact on employment, healthcare, public discourse and democracy). Navigation through this minefield of problems requires a new generation of thinkers who both understand computing technology, and are able to think critically about its consequences.\n\nArtificial intelligence also raises a host of more theoretical issues, such as:\n\nthe nature of reason\n\nits relation to logic\n\nhow far rationality can be mechanised\n\nand whether such qualities as autonomy, free will and mental activity can be shared by inanimate systems.\n\nThese are all deep questions going back to antiquity. But in our world they have become more than theoretical, as powerful automated reasoning – a dream of philosophers from Aristotle to Hobbes, Leibniz, Boole and Turing – has now at last become a reality.\n\nFuture philosophers, to engage effectively with such issues, need to take account of – and ideally harness for themselves – the power of artificial intelligence.\n\nComputer Science and Philosophy can be studied for three years (BA) or four years (Master of Computer Science and Philosophy).\n\nStudents do not need to choose between the three-year and four-year options when applying. All students apply for the four-year course, and then decide by the end of their third year whether they wish to continue to the fourth year. In order to proceed into the fourth year (part C), students will need to achieve a 2:1 or higher classification at the end of their third year.\n\nComputer Science and Philosophy has a ton of great things going for it. It can cover a wide variety of areas, and is incredibly flexible to allow you to study your particular interests in either subject. Having never done philosophy before starting the course, I've loved every second of it, having found both tutors and fellow students amazing to work with. There is a deep overlap in the subjects, and it is immensely rewarding to be able to work in two great fields at once.\n\nEwen\n\nUnistats information\n\nDiscover Uni course data provides applicants with Unistats statistics about undergraduate life at Oxford for a particular undergraduate course.\n\nPlease select 'see course data' to view the full Unistats data for Computer Science and Philosophy.\n\nPlease note that there may be no data available if the number of course participants is very small.\n\nVisit the Studying at Oxford section of this page for a more general insight into what studying here is likely to be like.\n\nComputer Science and Philosophy\n\nAcademic requirements\n\nQualification\n\nRequirement\n\nA levels:\n\nA*AA including at least an A in Mathematics, with the A* in Mathematics, Further Mathematics or Computer Science. Those taking Further Mathematics A level or AS-level are required to achieve at least Grade A.\n\nAdvanced Highers:\n\nAA/AAB with an A in Mathematics\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB):\n\n39 (including core points) with 766 at HL (the 7 must be in HL Mathematics)\n\nBTEC:\n\nPlease visit the Computer Science website for the latest information on our standard offers for students taking BTECs.\n\nAny other equivalent qualification:\n\nView information on other UK qualifications, and international qualifications.\n\nWherever possible, your grades are considered in the context in which they have been achieved.\n\nView further information on how we use contextual data.\n\nSubject requirements\n\nEssential:\n\nCandidates are expected to have Mathematics to A level (A* or A grade), Advanced Higher (A grade), Higher Level in the IB (score 7) or another equivalent.\n\nRecommended:\n\nFurther Mathematics A level is highly recommended.* Those taking Further Mathematics A level or AS-level are required to achieve at least Grade A.\n\n*If your school offers Further Maths A level we expect you to have taken it. However, we understand that not all schools offer Further Maths, and so we do consider applications from people with a single Maths A level.\n\nIf you are based in England, and your school doesn't offer Further Maths visit the Advanced Mathematics Support Programme website as they can provide extra maths support. If you are based in Wales, visit the Further Mathematics Support Programme Wales.\n\nPlease note from 2021-24, 95% of A level students who were offered places for Computer Science courses (including joint courses) took Further Maths to A level.\n\nIf a practical component forms part of any of your science A‐levels used to meet your offer, we expect you to pass it.\n\nIf English is not your first language you may also need to meet our English language requirements.\n\nApplying\n\nAll candidates must follow the application procedure as shown on our Applying to Oxford pages.\n\nThe following information gives specific details for students applying for this course.\n\nVisit the Computer Science department website for more information on how to apply, including advice on interviews, specimen MAT papers, and sample questions.\n\nAdmissions test\n\nTest:\n\nMAT\n\nTest date:\n\n31 October 2024\n\nRegistration window:\n\n15 August to 4 October 2024\n\nAll candidates must take the Mathematics Admissions Test (MAT) as part of their application.\n\nAll the information you need to arrange to take your test as well as how best to prepare can be found on your test page.\n\nWritten work\n\nYou do not need to submit any written work when you apply for this course.\n\nWhat are tutors looking for?\n\nFor Computer Science: strong mathematical aptitude, the ability to think and work independently, the capacity to absorb and use new ideas, and enthusiasm.\n\nFor Philosophy: a critical and analytical approach to abstract questions, the ability to think logically and express thoughts clearly, and a desire to delve deeper into the way we think about things.\n\nYou do not need to have previously studied either subject.\n\nVisit the Computer Science and Philosophy websites for more detail on the selection criteria for this course."
