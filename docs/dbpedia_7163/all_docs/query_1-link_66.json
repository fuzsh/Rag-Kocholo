        "text": "Simon BlackburnItâs not, and in some respects, Kemp-Smith has been superseded. But he gets an awful lot right, and he effected a sea-change in peopleâs understanding of Hume. I think itâs fair to say that the dominant idea before Kemp-Smith is that Hume was a sceptic, he didnât allow that we know anything. (Source)\n\nSimon BlackburnThis is the standard life of Hume. There are others, but Mossner seems to hold the field. It was the book that introduced me to Humeâs life and biography, so it was formative in that respect. It bears out what I just said, that Hume was a very loveable, admirable, man. He had this great generosity and benevolence and was very much adored by everyone who knew him. (Source)\n\nAnthony GottliebHis friends urged him not only to give up the idea of having it published in his lifetime, but even of having it published after his death, because they thought that it would condemn all this other works to the dustbin of history. (Source)\n\nMary WarnockHume thought it didnât actually make much difference whether you believed that God did design the universe or whether you didnât, because if you could say nothing about this God then it wasnât a very interesting belief to hold. (Source)\n\nLuciano FloridiI find reading Kant a bit like understanding cricket as a foreigner: hard to get at first, but once you get it, itâs very enjoyable. (Source)"
