        "text": "About the course\n\nThis course combines the most rigorous and fundamental subjects in the sciences and the arts.\n\nPhysics is concerned with unravelling the complexities of the universe from the smallest to the largest scale. Philosophy deals with foundational questions of the most general kind: what there is, what we know and how we came to know it, and how we ought to act and structure our lives.\n\nCentral to both subjects is the development and application of clear and precise thinking to foundational problems, the questioning of received wisdom and the critical articulation of ideas which aim for an understanding of how things are, in the broadest possible terms.\n\n\">Video of Physics and Philosophy at Oxford University\n\nPhysics and Philosophy are historically intertwined and each continues to contribute to developments in the other.\n\nPhilosophy played a crucial role in the two revolutions of 20th-century physics – namely, relativity and quantum mechanics. It continues to contribute both to foundational research in theoretical physics and to the articulation and critique of scientific method. Conversely, discoveries in physics provide profound implications for philosophical inquiry, such as the nature of space and time and the behaviour of matter at the quantum realm.\n\nStudents on this course can expect to investigate not only central developments in both subjects, but also this interplay.\n\nOxford has one of the largest physics departments in the UK, with over 100 academics leading research that spans the breadth of physics. This expertise ensures the curriculum is updated in the light of developments in research.\n\nThe Philosophy Faculty is the largest in the UK, with more than 70 full-time members; it admits around 450 undergraduates annually to read the various degrees involving Philosophy.\n\nThe Oxford research group in Philosophy of Physics is the largest in the world. It has interests ranging from classical space-time theories and foundations of classical statistical mechanics, to quantum mechanics, quantum field theory and quantum gravity.\n\nPhilosophy of Physics runs through the first three years of the course.\n\nIn the first year students delve into 18th-century investigations into matter and motion.\n\nIn Years 2 and 3 they investigate the philosophical foundations of relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\nThe fourth-year MPhysPhil options bring you to the threshold of current research. In this year students may specialise in either Physics or Philosophy, or continue with a combination, including advanced study in the Philosophy of Physics. Alternatively, students may complete the course in three years, leaving with a BA.\n\nUnistats information\n\nDiscover Uni course data provides applicants with Unistats statistics about undergraduate life at Oxford for a particular undergraduate course.\n\nPlease select 'see course data' to view the full Unistats data for Physics and Philosophy.\n\nPlease note that there may be no data available if the number of course participants is very small.\n\nVisit the Studying at Oxford section of this page for a more general insight into what studying here is likely to be like.\n\nPhysics and Philosophy\n\nA typical week\n\nYour work will be divided between independent study, tutorials, two or three classes and about ten lectures each week. Independent study (reading for and writing essays, completing problem sets) will take up the majority of your working time.\n\nTutorials typically take the form of 2-4 students discussing themes arising from essays or problem sets with a tutor in the students’ college. Lectures and classes are typically held in either the Department of Physics or Faculty of Philosophy.\n\nClass sizes may vary depending on the options you choose. There would usually be no more than around 10 students though classes for some of the more popular papers may be up to 20 students.\n\nMost tutorials, classes, and lectures are delivered by staff who are tutors in their subject. Many are world-leading experts with years of experience in teaching and research. Some teaching may also be delivered by postgraduate students who are usually studying at doctoral level.\n\nTo find out more about how our teaching year is structured, visit our Academic Year page.\n\nCourse structure\n\nYear 1\n\nIndicative courses\n\nAssessment\n\nPhysics\n\nClassical mechanics and special relativity\n\nMathematical methods\n\nDifferential equations and waves\n\nPhilosophy\n\nGeneral philosophy\n\nIntroductory philosophy of physics\n\nPhilosophical topics in logic and probability\n\nFirst University examinations: three written papers in Physics; two written papers in Philosophy\n\nYear 2\n\nIndicative courses\n\nAssessment\n\nPhysics\n\nThermal physics\n\nElectromagnetism\n\nQuantum physics\n\nMathematical methods\n\nPhysics practicals\n\nPhilosophy\n\nEarly modern philosophy or Knowledge and reality\n\nPhilosophy of special relativity\n\nFinal University examinations, Part A: three papers in Physics; satisfactory lab work\n\nYear 3\n\nIndicative courses\n\nAssessment\n\nCore topics:\n\nPhysics - choose two of the following:\n\nSymmetry and relativity\n\nGeneral relativity\n\nClassical mechanics\n\nPhilosophy - compulsory topics:\n\nPhilosophy of science\n\nPhilosophy of quantum mechanics\n\nExtra subjects, choose:\n\nEither two Physics papers and/or projects from:\n\nThe remaining core subject not chosen\n\nAtomic and laser physics\n\nComputational and experimental projects\n\nCondensed matter physics\n\nFluids\n\nNuclear and particle physics\n\nOr one Philosophy paper from a range of options\n\nFinal University examinations, Part B: three or four written papers in Philosophy; two or four subjects in Physics\n\nYear 4\n\nThe options listed above are illustrative and may change.

Formula sheets, tables and data books are not permitted. Calculators are permitted.\n\nGuidelines about the use of calculators along with details of the syllabus and links to supporting materials which candidates are encouraged to look at for preparation are available on the PAT page.\n\nWritten work\n\nYou do not need to submit any written work when you apply for this course.\n\nWhat are tutors looking for?\n\nAnyone who has an interest in general questions about the nature of science, mathematics, mind, knowledge or truth has an interest in philosophy. No more than that is needed – you are not disadvantaged if you have not studied Philosophy before.\n\nPhilosophy tutors will be looking for a critical and analytical approach to abstract questions and an ability to defend a point of view by reasoned argument. The Physics tutors will ask you the same style of questions about mathematics and physics as they ask Physics applicants, to determine your mathematical and problem-solving ability and potential for further study.\n\nVisit the Physics website and the Philosophy website for more detail on the selection criteria for this course."
