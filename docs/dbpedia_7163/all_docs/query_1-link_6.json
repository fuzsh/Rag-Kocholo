Contributor to periodicals, including New Republic and New York Times Book Review.\n\nSIDELIGHTS:\n\nSimon Blackburn's The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy has been praised by numerous reviewers as an engrossing book to read, as well as a valuable and notably thorough reference work for students of philosophy and anyone else interested in general intellectual movements. The author, a professor of philosophy, \"operates in the Anglo-American analytic philosophical tradition, as opposed to the existentialist or phenomenological traditions of Europe,\" noted a Booklist reviewer.\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy contains nearly 3,000 entries, including mini-biographies of some 500 notable individuals from Plato and Thomas Aquinas to more modern individuals such as Nietzsche and Albert Einstein. Baffling philosophical terms such as \"the Dirty Hands Argument\" and \"Wittgenstein's Beetle in the Box\" are also illuminated in a \"concise, focused\" manner, according to the Booklist contributor. The origins of Eastern and Western philosophy are thoroughly discussed, as are more unusual topics such as philosophical insights or approaches to dreams, love, and biology. \"Blackburn writes in an interesting and easy-to-follow style,\" concluded the reviewer.\n\nBlackburn has also authored the philosophy primer Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy. In it, Blackburn familiarizes readers with famous figures in philosophy and their ideas about knowledge, truth, morality, destiny, logic, free will, religion, sensory perception, identity, and goodness, among other topics. He explains philosophical concepts by offering readers simple analogies. Booklist contributor Gilbert Taylor felt that Think is \"unintimidating\" and \"written with exemplary concision and with conviction that philosophy needn't be an ethereal subject, alienated from practical concerns.\" Library Journal contributor Leon H. Brody observed: \"To read this book is to sit down with an engaging, highly learned conversationalist.\"\n\nIn a contribution to the Oxford University Press series \"The Seven Deadly Sins,\" Blackburn argues in his book Lust that sexual lust has been historically misrepresented as a sin. For this error, Blackburn blames historical Christian figures for associating lust with guilt, as well as psychologist Sigmund Freud and philosopher Jean Paul Sartre for creating a false understanding of lust. Blackburn feels that lust is essential and enjoyable, and he concludes by categorizing it as a virtue rather than a sin.\n\nIn a review of Lust for the Library Journal, Gary P. Gillum wrote that Blackburn \"amuses us with his provocative defense of lust,\" commenting, \"While religious conservatives could regard Blackburn's Lust as outrageous, it thoughtfully balances the other books in the series.\" Indeed, some religious-minded readers found the book to be invalid. W. Jay Wood, contributor to Books & Culture, praised the author as \"a prolific writer …, an outstanding essayist, and an insightful reviewer of books whose sparkling prose customarily displays philosophical skill and evident wit.\" However, Wood felt that while \"Lust doesn't lack in stylistic grace and wit … its ground note is a smirking satisfaction with its own provocations.\" Wood went on to warn that \"Christians … need to think carefully to determine when healthy sexual desires and amorous inclinations veer off into unhealthiness and sin. Unfortunately, they'll get little or no help … [from] Blackburn's Lust.\" On the other hand, a Publishers Weekly reviewer wrote: \"Because lust is broadly condoned in our culture, most readers will find that Blackburn's condescension comes across quite sympathetically.\" The reviewer depicted Blackburn as a \"witty writer,\" praising the author for being \"particularly adept at pitting temporally disparate thinkers … against each other.\"\n\nPublished in 2005, Blackburn's book Truth: A Guide for the Perplexed examines the scientific, reason-based definitions of truth, tracing the history of its philosophy since ancient times and contesting many theories of some of the world's most revered philosophers. He encourages readers to look not to philosophical figures such as Nietzsche for the truth, but instead to seek truth in the personal judgments and assessments that facilitate everyday life. Blackburn does not disavow absolutist and relativist philosophies, but rather finds a common ground between the two, a place where truth emerges out of individual actions. While New Statesman contributor Edward Skidelsky agreed with the author that \"we must not let our confidence be sapped by the ‘après-truth chit-chat’ of coffee-house intellectuals,\" Skidelsky further commented that the author is \"overoptimistic … in his assumption that our intellectual practices are in themselves perfectly healthy, that the virus of doubt enters only from without.\" Nonetheless, one Publishers Weekly contributor commented: \"Blackburn considers truth ‘the most exciting and engaging issue in the whole of philosophy,’ and with wit and erudition, he succeeds in proving that point.\"\n\nIn the collection Essays in Quasi-realism, Blackburn advocates an approach to philosophy that bridges the divide between philosophical realism (basically, the idea that philosophical concepts exist independently of our ability to articulate them) and projectivism or antirealism (the idea that our decisions are defined primarily by our reaction to philosophical dilemmas). \"The realist,\" explained Michael Tooley in the Review of Metaphysics, \"holds that ethical properties exist, and that they enter into states of affairs that are objective, and independent of us. Such states of affairs, in turn, both make various ethical beliefs either true or false, and explain, at least in part, the possibility of ethical knowledge.\" \"The antirealist, on the other hand,\" Tooley concluded, \"is normally taken as denying all of this.\" Quasi-realism bridges the gap between the two; it suggests that while we project our morals and ethics on situations, we nonetheless understand them as real on their own terms. As the leading advocate of quasi-realism, Blackburn has earned a worldwide reputation as a scholar of the process by means of which moral decisions are made. \"His essays,\" stated Allan Gibbard in Mind, \"are vivid and eloquent. They evince a deep passion to probe to the roots of philosophical issues. Blackburn is dissatisfied with easy dichotomies, and his philosophical judgment is of the highest calibre.\"\n\nBeing Good: An Introduction to Ethics applies quasi-realism specifically to the problem of ethics. In it, Blackburn examines different ideas about how people make ethical decisions and concludes that they all fall short of the goal of providing a philosophical system of morals and ethics in the twenty-first century. The author, stated Jenny Teichman in Quadrant, \"argues in Being Good (and elsewhere) that perspectivism (‘quasi-realism’) can provide an answer to ethical relativism (‘subjectivism’).\" Blackburn suggests, according to a Publishers Weekly critic, that \"ethical principles are those that would be agreed in any reasonable cooperative procedure for coming to one mind about our conduct.\" In other words, Blackburn's point of view can help the modern world negotiate between the extreme moral positions that morals and ethics do not exist (that they are imposed by individuals on objective reality) and that morals and ethics are absolute (and that therefore those who disagree with them are by definition immoral, unethical, and—in some cases—evil).\n\nIn Plato's Republic: A Biography, Blackburn examines the implications of the most famous work of one of the original realist philosophers—the ancient Greek thinker Plato. In an interview with Alex Koppelman of Salon.com, Blackburn pointed out that Plato has been misunderstood by a variety of modern philosophers, including the twentieth-century thinkers Karl Popper and Leo Strauss. The Republic, Blackburn told Koppelman, is \"the first great text on political theory and moral theory, relating them, in the Western tradition. What Plato does is confront a variety of skeptics, people like Thrasymachus who say that morality is bunkum, that it's all power.\" Blackburn continued: \"Socrates\"—the teacher whom Plato quotes in the book—\"seeks to show that these views are wrong, and he does this by drawing an elaborate analogy between the state of your soul and the state of the body politic.… [He] says that a disordered soul is as bad for you as a disordered polis, a disordered city, and the kind of disorder represented by Thrasymachus or Glaucon would eventually lead to catastrophe.\" Plato's Republic: A Biography, stated Francisca Goldsmith in Library Journal, is \"balanced and popular in tone but does not gloss over nuances important to the understanding of the ideas.\" A Kirkus Reviews writer described it as \"rigorous and humble, admiring and dismissive—a clear and accessible introduction to philosophy's first superstar.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBiography, spring, 2007, Mark Kingwell, review of Plato's Republic: A Biography.\n\nBooklist, January 15, 1995, review of The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, p. 962; October 1, 1999, Gilbert Taylor, review of Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy, p. 309; February 1, 2004, Ray Olson, review of Lust, p. 936; June 1, 2007, Gilbert Taylor, review of Plato's Republic, p. 11.\n\nBooks & Culture, May-June, 2005, W.
