        "text": "For though we hold indeed the Objects of Sense to be nothing else but Ideas which cannot exist unperceived; yet we may not hence conclude they have no Existence except only while they are perceived by us, since there may be some other Spirit that perceives them, though we do not. Wherever Bodies are said to have no Existence without the Mind, I would not be understood to mean this or that particular Mind, but all Minds whatsoever. It does not therefore follow from the foregoing Principles, that Bodies are annihilated and created every moment, or exist not at all during the Intervals between our Perception of them. [4, 48]\n\nWe are concerned in this paper to establish the rationality of American legal realism by adopting a theory of reconstruction. American realism is plagued with dichotomies in relating theory and practice; and the need to broach these dichotomies involves transcendence of experience and transference of consciousness. In doing this, we have both to excavate and to justify its philosophy, logic and science. American legal realism has its root in the philosophy of pragmatism and a logic that sets out the essential elements associated with the making and determination of the law through instrumentality of the court. The validity of this category of legal theory tends to lie on the extent of immediate use to which law can be put or the benefits it can afford the American society. Believing in the possibility of a realistic theory of law that is purely American precludes belief in universal understanding of human legal experience distinct from the understanding gained through the cultural l...\n\nI The coherence theory of truth deserves better treatment than it has usually been given in the past ®fty years or so. The stock dismissals of itÐby Russell, by Schlick, and by many others who ought to have known better 1 Ðdispose only of a crude caricature. But they have been widely accepted as exhibiting the theory as a foolish aberration, suited only to the occasional muddled veri®cationist and to the Idealists of the last century (a time when, as we like to think, philosophical standards were so much lower that the most palpable absurdities escaped attention). That these dismissals were unduly hasty is suggested by the theory's recent revival in the hands of such hard-headed philosophers as Quine, Davidson and Putnam; on a plausible interpretation of Wittgenstein it can be ascribed also to him. There are, of course, substantial differences between these contemporary philosophers and the coherence theorists of the last century, and also among these contemporary philosophers themselves. The differences are great enough to suggest that it might be better to speak of coherence theories, in the plural, rather than of`theof`the coherence theory' of truth. Nevertheless I think these various views have enough in common to justify the traditional usage. The motivations for themÐmotivations which are powerful and hard to resistÐare very similar; they run into parallel dif®culties; and above all they share the same general character, the same radical conception of the kind of thing that truth is. I shall therefore continue to speak (when it is not misleading to do so) of`theof`the coherence theory of truth' in the singular."
