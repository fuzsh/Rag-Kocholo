        "text": "Philosophy 1120  General PhilosophyOffice Hours: M W F, 11:30-12:30\n\nFall Semester 2007Office: LC143S; Phone: 2604\n\nProfessor Tom Atchison Email: tatchison@gw.hamline.edu\n\nCourse Objectives\n\n· To introduce students to some of the questions philosophers have traditionally asked (questions about what we know and how we know it, about what is real, about what is valuable and about how we should live) and to some of the answers they have proposed, and to see how these issues bear on our current circumstances and way of life.\n\n· To introduce students to some of the skills and methods used in philosophical inquiry, skills and methods that may be useful in other sorts of inquiries as well. These include the ability to read a text carefully, sympathetically and critically, the ability to analyze and criticize arguments, and the ability to articulate ones own views and to support them with reasoned arguments.\n\nCourse Texts\n\nThe following books are (or should be) available at the bookstore: Simon Blackburn, Think; Plato, Five Dialogues; Rene Descartes, Meditations on First Philosophy; David Hume, Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding; John Locke, Second Treatise of Government.Any other course readings will be photocopied or will be available on the Internet.Please bring the text to be discussed to class with you every time.\n\nClass website\n\nI maintain a simple website where I post course handouts and information. The URL is www.woldww.net/classes/. There are notes and study questions posted there to help make sense of some of the more difficult readings. I will also post links to some assigned reading that is available online.\n\nCourse Description\n\nAlfred North Whitehead wrote (in his great work Process and Reality), The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. We will begin with Plato, studying several of his shorter works. These will introduce us to the life and death of Platos beloved teacher Socrates and to the activity of philosophical inquiry. Then we will let Simon Blackburn guide us on a tour through some of the greatest (short) hits of modern Western philosophy. The works we study will deal with questions about what we can know and how we can know it (including what, if anything, we can know about right and wrong), what is real and what is merely appearance or illusion, what reasons there are for believing (or disbelieving) in God, in miracles, in life after death, and in free will and about the nature of the human mind and its relation to our bodies. The later part of the course will consider some fundamental questions of political philosophy. We will begin with another short classic (John Lockes Second Treatise of Government) and then consider how we should understand and apply the ideals of liberty, equality, and justice in our current circumstances.\n\nI cannot promise we will answer any of these questions to your satisfaction. They are, for the most part, very difficult questions. What we can hope to do is to learn something about how various historical and contemporary thinkers have answered them, and to become somewhat more careful and critical in our own efforts to answer them.\n\nConduct of the Course\n\nClass time will be devoted largely to discussion, some in small groups, some all together. I will occasionally lecture, more often I will answer questions as they come up in discussion, and even more often I will try to help you figure out how to answer your questions yourself. Often I will end the class with some remarks intended to orient you to the next days reading.\n\nMuch of our discussion will focus on understanding and evaluating the texts. This will work well only if you have done the assigned reading carefully -- often twice or three times -- and given it some thought. In philosophy we are interested not in the information that can be extracted from a text, nor simply in the conclusions or opinions that an author expresses; we are primarily interested in understanding and assessing the reasoning that an author uses to try to establish or support those conclusions. This requires a very careful sort of reading.\n\nThe point of struggling with these difficult texts is not only to understand what some great minds have produced. A guided tour through the Museum of Great Ideas is a very good thing, but not the best thing that philosophy has to offer. Better is the opportunity to learn to think for yourself. The texts can serve as models of careful and/or creative thinking, as challenges to our prejudices and assumptions, and as starting points for our own reflections. But the only way to learn to philosophize is to enter the conversation yourself. In this way a course in philosophy is more like a course in drawing or sculpture -- a studio art course -- than like a course in art history or art appreciation. You cant learn to draw by just watching other people draw, and you cant learn to do philosophy by just listening and reading. You have to express your views and expose them to other peoples critical reactions, and then figure out what to say in reply, and so on.\n\nAssignments and Grading\n\nReading assignments\n\nI expect you to find time (an hour or two) to do the reading for each class and to come prepared to discuss it. Come to class ready to say what you found interesting, what you found confusing, silly, or just plain wrong, what seemed to you to be the most important claims made, and what arguments or justifications were offered for those claims.\n\nReading response papers\n\n20 % of your grade will be earned by submitting brief (1/4-3/4 of a double-spaced, typed page) responses to the readings for each class. These must be turned in at the beginning of the class period to be counted. They can contain questions, objections, observations and/or reactions to the reading for that class. Each one should contain a brief statement of what you take to be the main point of the reading assigned for that day. I will not grade these, but I will read them and will reject any that do not seem to be based on a reasonably conscientious reading of the assignment for that day. I will also notice and reward particularly perceptive or thoughtful response papers. You can miss a few of these and still earn an A for this part of the course work, but missing more than a few will be penalized on the following schedule: 85% completed = A; 70% = B; 55% = C; 40% = D; less than 40% = F.\n\nClass discussion\n\n10% of your grade will also be determined by my evaluation of the quality of your participation in class discussions. Just showing up and paying attention earns a C for this component; occasionally making helpful contributions earns a B; regularly making helpful contributions earns an A. Helpful contributions include: asking pertinent questions, answering questions asked by the instructor or by other students, expressing your views about the texts or topics we are discussing, responding (relevantly and respectfully) to the views expressed by others.\n\nEssays\n\nYou will be asked to write two short (3-5 page) essays during the semester. Each paper will count for 17.5% of your grade. Please keep copies of all the work you hand in.\n\nExams\n\nWe will have two one-hour, in-class exams -- one at mid-semester, one during the scheduled final exam period. Each exam will count for 17.5% of your grade.\n\nGrading criteria\n\nI try hard to base my evaluation of your work on your understanding of the reading, the quality of your reasoning and questioning, and the clarity and effectiveness of your expression of your thoughts, not on whether or not I agree with your philosophical theories, ideas, or opinions.\n\nPlagiarism\n\nAll work submitted for this course must be your own. Plagiarism is the academic sin of presenting someone elses work as your own. It is plagiarism if you copy something verbatim (word for word) from a published source, from the Internet, or from another student. It is still plagiarism if you rearrange, paraphrase, condense, or summarize someone elses work without making clear to your reader what is your contribution and what is taken from your source. If the exact wording comes from your source, then use quotation marks. If the idea comes from someone else, give him or her credit for it. The way to do this is to cite your sources. There is a clear and detailed explanation of various forms of plagiarism and of proper citation practices at http://clover.slavic.pitt.edu/~tales/02-1/plagiarism.html.I will give a grade of F to any student who submits plagiarized work for this course."
