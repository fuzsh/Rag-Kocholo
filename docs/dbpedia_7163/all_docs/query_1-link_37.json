        "text": "November 5, 2013\n\nSlowly working my way through the Very Short Introduction series. This has been the worst of the lot till now - in fact the series had been pretty good until this one.\n\nBlackburn seems to be unaware that the standards had been set a tad higher in this series and chooses to ramble on about just societies etc instead of focusing on a compact introduction with enough fresh thoughts to send the reader packing on his way to denser pastures. That is what the authors I have read in the series until now had done. In any case, I will continue working through the VSIs. They usually tend to be good.\n\nOctober 20, 2008\n\nWhen I got to the 'joke' about the priest who presented the Truth about eternal life and the promise of salvation and it was received as, \"Wow, terrific, if that works for you that's great.\" on page 26 I knew I didn't need this kind of book on ethics, especially since his witness was used as the butt of the joke and a relativist claim to authority. According to Blackburn, 'The moral is that once a relativist frame of mind is really in place, nothing--no claims to truth, authority, certainty, or necessity--will be audible except as one more saying like all the others.'\n\nToo bad. I hoped this might be a good book.\n\nMarch 26, 2021\n\n3.25/5 - Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics is good, but only for a beginner in this sphere. Even then, it has serious flaws. The depth is lacking, the focus is uneven, but it gave me enough great information to be a worth the time.\n\nSimon Blackburn's other book, Think, was so good that I thought I had to buy this one. Recently, I had been struggling with the problems of moral nihilism and relativism, so I desperately wanted to see what philosophy had to answer that with. It turns out, not much. This isn't a flaw in and of itself. If philosophy can't deal with them, then I can hardly knock Blackburn for being unable to answer my concerns.\n\nThe book is divided into three sections. The first one is given to challenges to ethical systems, like the ones I mentioned above. Some of these explanations are great, and Blackburn was able to dismantle these views. Others, like skepticism, relativism, and nihilism went almost completely unaddressed throughout the book, or ended up being acknowledged in some form. His summaries were decent, but he occasionally went into long-winded rants that were both boring and mostly unrelated.\n\nThe second part is dedicated to areas where moral debates come into play, such as life, death, pleasure, and rights. This section was full of discussions that were reminiscent of Platonic dialogues. They gave answers and challenges in turn, and generally didn't offer a resolution. In fact, this entire book could be seen as being like that. Regardless, this section is where Blackburn most often strays into lengthy and barely tangential discussions on society, which is why I said the focus is lacking. He also discusses Utilitarianism in this section, which is weird considering that the next section is dedicated to systems of ethics. This middle third was the worst part of the book, and seriously slowed down my progress.\n\nThe third part is easily the most interesting. Here, he goes over various philosophical proposals of ethical foundations, like Aristotle's virtue ethics, Kant's Categorical Imperative, and Rawls's Justice as Fairness principle. These were fascinating to read about, but this is the shortest section of the book by far. Its insane that he gives so little time to the most important section. He also dismisses Rawls's theory with very little justification. I thought the Justice as Fairness and Original Position theory were novel and fascinating, but he kneecaps it here. As mentioned above, he discusses Utilitarianism in the second section rather than here, which I think is dumb.\n\nBeing Good is an odd book. I'm not taking points off because of its failure to live up to my expectations. I'm taking off points because of its failure to even live up to its premise. Its an introduction, sure, but the introductory material is partially buried underneath Blackburn's own prejudices and pointless rambling, along with the terrible structuring and pointless inclusions. I don't regret reading this book at all, and if you like philosophy, you'd probably do well to read it, but I can't deny how flawed this text is.\n\nMay 17, 2016\n\nThis book is not specific enough about trends in ethics to be of good use in an Intro to Philosophy class, but it provides a sophisticated and non-condescending account of the subject fit for intelligent people looking for the lay of the land.\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\nMy dissatisfactions with this book:\n\n1. The book is well-structured in a broad sense yet lacks enough detail and depth.\n\n2. In the first few chapters, the author has a clear preference for atheistic interpretations of ethics. Religious views of morals are generally treated with skepticism or simply seen as ludicrous. Most of the moral questions in Part Two are discussed only from a limited, secular perspective.\n\nJanuary 19, 2019\n\nIn Being Good: A short introduction to ethics (2001), contemporary philosopher Simon Blackburn offers a tour de force along the field of ethics. He does this by attacking everyday subjects that common people busy themselves with. This book is therefore written for a general audience; no prior background in ethics in needed to understand it.\n\nThe book itself is divided into three parts. In part 1, Blackburn responds to seven main threats to ethics. This part deals with the claim that morals presuppose a god; moral relativism and moral scepticism; the naturalistic fallacy (especially evolutionary accounts of ethics); fatalism; the unworldly aspirations of moral philsophy; and the contemporary and not-so contemporary debate on ethics as a tool of the elites to make the masses internalize a false consciousness.\n\nThen, in part 2 of the book, Blackburn enters the domain of the everyday problems that presents us ethical questions and dilemma's. Subjects include life; death; the meaning of life; freedom; and the status of rights. Basically, every aspect in nature, including our lives, is gradual. This gradual conception of things doesn't fit well with dogmatists, who'd like to claim something's either good or bad. Blackburn's approach is the perspective most intellectuals like to take: look for common ground between parties, make each party see the issue through the eyes of the other, and try to establish a compromise. For example, neither abortion nor the concept of freedom are black/white themes.\n\nAlso, when pondering questions like 'what does life mean?' and 'what is a good life?' there's no general answer. We all have to decide that for ourselves and philosophy can help us 'clear away the rubble' (as John Locke would say) and rob us of our erroneous ways of thinking. For example, the meaning of life is not linked in any way to death, to the universe, to god(s), but simply to existence. You exist and that's it, make the best of it! And 'best' is subsequently to be defined according to your own preferences. Blackburn adheres - on this point, at least - to David Hume's sentimentalism, the view that our emotions guide or morality and that reason comes along afterwards. Feeling happy and feeling content is hence the ultimate sign of a good life.\n\nThe last part of the book, part 3, skims the foundations of ethics. Or rather, the consequentialist side (starting with Hume and proceeding through Bentham to Mill) and the deontological side (mainly Kant). Both are flawed, incomplete positions. The alternatives, Aristotle (too elitist) and Rawls (too contractual), are imperfect as well. Blackburn seems to end in a Platonic aporia and concludes his little book with the notion that even though we might not be able to measure ethical progress and even though the world still contains much injustice, we should be able to distinguish mini-steps into the right direction.\n\nFor me, this book didn't really struck a chord. It is too superficial to be really interesting. Also, it is too steeped in progressive-liberal ideology to really offer a neutral account of things. In my view, a book on ethics should be as a-moral as possible. Blackburn is the typical academic who clings to utilitarian morality (calculate and measure everything - please!); then notices the flaws in this system and decides to selectively incorporate some contractualism à la Rawls and some virtue-building à la Aristotle; and ends up with a concoction of ethical guidelines that is supposed to reduce suffering and injustice worldwide. And of course this is permeated through and through with a 'look for victims everywhere'-mentality. Basically, Blackburn adheres to an ethics in the same vein as Peter Singer. We should care about the whole world and about future generations - that this is simply not a viable or affordable option for most of us seems to escape the bright minds of such thinkers.\n\nThe problem I have with the type of intellectual like Blackburn is that they abstract from everyday life and then take these abstractions as the problem of ethics for which their system offers a solution. For example, a poor person will not very quickly accept a compromise in which the rich person gains as well; just like the religious believer will not accept a gradualist conception of abortion, while the pregnant women with a wish to abort her baby will not accept a 'no'.\n\nThis most interesting part of Blackburn's book is the part where he deals with the problem of freedom and rights. We formulate rights in order to garantuee the freedoms of people, but in doing so we run into problems. No freedom can be absolute, so rights have to be limited - but where to draw the line? Also, rights imply that a person can hold someone responsible if his or her rights aren't respected, but this creates a snackbar-model of rights - we just selectively pick whatever we want and when someone trespasses on our domain we claim they disrespect our rights.\n\nThe juridication of our Western culture - incouding the United Nations' Declaration of Human Rights - creates a claimants-culture in which lawyers and judges enforce others to bow to the will of minorities. This is seen in the contemporary debate about international migration - migrants come to Europe, where an army of lawyers and judges stands at the ready to enforce governments to give these people papers, housing, medical aid, etc. and to enforce the tax payer to pay for this.\n\nThe ideology of moral philosophers like Blackburn, Singer, Rawls, and their likes turns morality into a political tool. Rawls, for example, advocates the view that society should redistribute all wealth until the least well-off disappear into the grey mass of middle classes. Karl Marx would exclaim: \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\" For Rawls, the point where redistribution stops is the point where transferring more increments of wealth to the least well-off starts to trigger the masses to stop working.\n\nIn other words: it now becomes a political question about who has which rights and who has to give what to whom. This view of morality is in its core a very calculating, utilitarian one and is typical for academics who like to view everything through the scientific lens - analyses of costs and benefits, statistical models about future scenario's, etc. That this morality has won the day can be seen in the policies with which Western countries enforce healthy lifestyles and useful lives on their citizens - of course 'healthy' and 'useful' are moral concepts, but they're presented as if they're simply factual claims. For example, forcing people to quit smoking is deemed to be the best for all of us. Another example is the climate hysteria, which, ultimately, is based on future predictions based on computer models. That this is never mentioned in the news is because all those involved know the inherent uncertainties in this system. Now, science becomes a tool for policy-makers to enforce a certain type of morality.\n\nI think such a philosophy is one-sided and it leaves out important aspects of our humanity. Aspects that very well might prove to be much more important and influential in living meaningful lives than this bare and empty intellectual morality. It is therefore ironic that Blackburn deems Aristotle to be too elitist - here's the well-paid and well-cared for intellectual telling us what to do. Now where's the difference?\n\nAnyway, the book itself is rather too short (135 pages) and offers not much new or interesting material to merit even a decent rating. I can't really recommend it - maybe only to people who have never read about ethics, as a first stepping stone to the more serious works.\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\nKad es lasu šādas grāmatas man ir sajūta, ka pēkšņi vairs nesaprotu valodu. Es atpazīstu vārdus, tie ir salikti kopā teikumu konstrukcijās, bet es nekā nevaru piedabūt savu smadzenīti uztvert to teikumu domu. Es ticu, ka līdzīga sajūta ir nupat sākot mācīties lasīt un izteikties, kad visa pasaule ir viena liela makaronburtiņu zupa, kuras haosā tu peldi, stum burtus, nedaudz levitē, lai redzi no augšas, cenšoties nenoēst īstos burtus savām domām.\n\nBet ja neskaita tos brīžus, kad neko nesapratu un piecreiz pārlasīju bija interesanti.\n\nSeptember 4, 2018\n\nGood overview that would be a decent introduction for a layman. I admired its concision and plainspoken approach. I thought he did a good job of summarizing Kant and Aristotle in a couple paragraphs. It was a bit dry at times. Also, the foundation Blackburn lays for moral philosophy to shore it up against the depredations of the Grand Unifying Pessimisms he describes is a pretty thin one.\n\nKind of a bummer when the conclusion is there is no Reason for moral behavior, and all we have to build upon is a feeling that there is some shared consensus of things that are bad and things that are good. Obviously, if morality is built on nothing more than a nebulous shared intuition of right and wrong, then that consensus may shift over time in ways that make sense (extending rights to disenfranchised groups, trying to dismantle institutional sexism and racism) and ways that are a little dismaying (rising ethnonationalism, totalitarianism, etc.). But how do we critique positions that put forward a totalizing but repugnant moral vision, if there is no privileged purchase for moral thought arising from virtue, natural law, or otherwise? Maybe that's really where we're left, but I can't help feeling he cedes too much to relativism for my comfort. My moral intuition is that alt-right Nazis are bad, independent of a shared agreement that they are. Because what if that (has already) changed?\n\nJanuary 5, 2020\n\nBlackburn brings up some interesting points to reflect upon at the beginning of the book, but seems to leave very little open to discussion by ending things with his personal opinions (and Hume, a lot of Hume). The second half might be a little too unstructured for layman-readers who search for an introduction to ethics, but is a nice refresher if you already know a bit about ethical theories.\n\nApril 1, 2018\n\nStarts out well, as Blackburn enumerates number of traditional problems for ethics (the failure of the Divine Command theory exemplified in Plato's Eutyphro, relativism, nihilism (think Nietzsche's attack on Christian \"slave\" morality), psychological challenges, evolutionary debunking accounts etc.\n\nThe remainder of the book is spent on trying to find a foundation for ethics and the Good Life. Blackburn covers the usual suspects, utilitarianism, Kantianism, Aristotelian eudaimonistic theories. In the end, this book is really just a decent short introduction.\n\nJanuary 24, 2024\n\nFinally done 🙏 the book tackles important topics but they’re way too shallow so a lot of further reading is recommended\n\nThe Seminar to the book was fun tho\n\nJanuary 29, 2019\n\nThis book opened well for me, meaning that I was able to follow much of the first half. During the second half of the book, the text felt increasingly abstract and remote, making it much more difficult to understand.\n\nA lot of the book was historical in nature, discussing the contributions of Kant, Hume, Bentham, and other philosophers along the way. This was prominent enough in the book that the actual subtitle \"A short introduction to ethics\" could easily have been: \"A short introduction to the history and development of ethics\".\n\nDecember 4, 2022\n\nA wide-ranging and fresh introduction to ethics, written in non-academic language by an expert. Not recommended if you're not prepared to read carefully and are not humble enough to acknowledge that Blackburn knows what he's doing - which is far more than you. Otherwise, prepare to be given an authoritative and engaging entree to the subject.\n\nAugust 12, 2022\n\nI have two theories about this book: the first, that he wrote it in haste on a deadline and submitted it with only giving it a cursory proofread; the second, that he had written a book that was for too long for what the publishers had requested and thus quickly trimmed it down.\n\nWhen I started the book, I loved it, thinking it would be a nice refresher on ethics. And on pp. 17-18, in his discussion of Plato, he offers a broad understanding of mythology:\n\nThe alternative suggested by Plato's dialogue is that religion gives a mythical clothing and mythical authority to a morality that is just there to begin with. Myth, in this sense, is not to be despised. It gives us symbolism and examples that engage our imaginations. It is the depository for humanity's endless attempts to struggle with death, desire, happiness, and good and evil. When an exile reminisces, she will remember the songs and poems and folktales of the homeland rather than its laws or its constitution. If the songs no longer speak to her, she is on the way to forgetting. Similarly, we may fear that when religion no longer speaks to us, we may be on our way to forgetting some important part of history and human experience. This may be a moral change, for better or worse. In this analysis, religion is not the foundation of ethics, but its showcase or its symbolic expression.\n\nIn other words, we drape our own standards with the stories of divine origin as a way of asserting their authority. We do not just just have a standard of conduct that forbids, say, murder, but we have mythological historical examples in which God expressed his displeasure at cases of murder.\n\nWhen I was working on my PhD in Mythological Studies, I often wished we had a summary this succinct.\n\nHere Blackburn notes how mythological provides examples of bad action. But alas, in this short book, he provides all too few examples of the concepts he is illustrating, making it challenging for the reader to understand just what one needs to, what one should do to be good.\n\nJuly 29, 2020\n\nLivro muito bom de introdução à Ética, fugindo do formato tradicional.\n\nO livro não adota o padrão em obras de introdução, cuja estruturação costuma tender para a organização cronológica/por escolas ou para o conjunto da obra de cada filósofo em si. Em vez disso, o livro toma como ponto de partida as próprias discussões da filosofia moral, seus impasses e obstáculos a elas. Por meio de discussões de fácil identificação para o leitor, o autor consegue engajar quem lê no debate técnico e filosófico.\n\nO livro foge também à imparcialidade esperada em obras desse propósito. Frequentemente o autor resolve discussões com respostas de escolas com que concorda ou filósofos que admira (Hume, em particular), apresentando-as como verdades sem antes discutir os méritos e falhas de opiniões diversas. Mais que isso, o autor não aponta quando o faz, o que exige do leitor senso crítico técnico para discernir, o que, em um leitor de introdução ao campo de estudo, não costuma existir ainda. Esse é o principal defeito da obra, ainda que tenha sido uma escolha pela concisão, porque o debate proposto se empobrece.\n\nAinda assim, é essa estruturação que viabiliza o maior mérito do livro: mais que ensinar conceitos técnicos, despertar a consciência da aplicabilidade e o interesse pelo aprofundamento no estudo da Ética e suas questões. Dado o tamanho do livro, é um feito notável.\n\nRead\n\nAugust 11, 2020\n\nA strong point of the book is the choice for starting it deploying the topics that hamper ethics. Relativism and egoism are two attitudes that hinder ethic thought. The relativist says: “This is good for you”. It is impossible build up a serious and systematic ethic argument before a relativist. Any argument will be good only for you. Something similar happens to egoism. Carefulness for the others imbues the moral philosophy. This is why ethics has no chance before self-referentialism.\n\nAnother strong point of the book is the clearness with which it displays the history of ethics. The maxim of utilitarianism is the bigger good for the greater number of people. This philosophy is present in modern ethic thought. The discursive ethics of the American philosopher Scanlon and the German thinker Habermas have a deep taste of utilitarianism, as it is observed by Blackburn. What I admire, respect and want that the other people fulfil is what we agree among all.\n\nThe author, however, does not choose a traditional ethic system from which are described in the book. He chooses benevolence, respect for the genre, and avoiding racism as ethic aims. Benevolence, a trait of the teachings of Confucius, is the minimum that the author proposes as something that anybody should praise, accomplish and want that the other people appreciate.\n\nNovember 10, 2021\n\nThe only critique of this absolutely wonderful book in my opinion is the structure of it. I somehow didn't really agreed with the three parts it was separated or didn't understood why it was. I think there must have been a better way to outline it.\n\nThis book catches you from the introduction itself and it's incredibly easy to follow. I really liked it as someone for who the topic of ethics is a quite recent endeavor. The often application of certain concepts on our society really puts them in perspective and it allows you to see the wickedness of ethics.\n\nI do not think this is a book one can read and set aside as I regard it rather a guide to critical thinking itself for what it is to be a \"good human'. Many sentences made me think for days, while others made things very clear. It also disregarded the statement of good vs bad.\n\nFrom all the short introductions this particular one is my favorite exactly due ot it's simplicity, wittiness and the way it deals with such a heavy topic and lightweight manner. Def a recommendation.\n\nApril 6, 2023\n\nIt's fine.\n\nSome good insights and a serviceable overview of basic concepts. I also appreciated the attempt to avoid or explain philosophical jargon that makes the field so daunting.\n\nThat said, it's barely cogent just as often as it's insightful. Some sections are so pithy that it takes quite a bit of effort to tie all of the tenuous logical threads together. It left me wanting more explanation, but probably not in the way Blackburn intended.\n\nHe also seems a little too comfortable taking some things for granted; \"we can all agree X point of view is absurd.\" Can we? Why? Isn't the whole purpose to crack open these assumptions?\n\nI get the sense this book is better served to the rusty philosophy major looking to brush up on the basics rather than someone like me who (regrettably) barely paid attention in high school philosophy and is looking for a basic but thorough entry point.\n\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nWhile I realize it is not easy trying to do a \"short\" introduction to ethics, one of the most complicated topics in the world, I feel like this book really dropped the ball. I found the layout confusing, the tone condescending, and I don't feel like I really learned much at all. It felt somewhat like some random philosophy professor, who I don't know and don't particularly like, sat down in front of me, gave a two-hour, rambling talk about ethics and then abruptly got up and walked away. If you are like me, a layman with a deep interest in ethics and moral philosophy, I would suggest looking elsewhere to get your start.\n\nApril 19, 2020\n\nWe can never blame writers of introductory philosophy books for presenting their own theories in there somewhere. On the contrary, doing so is inevitable and dutiful as philosophers, and so I disagree with any reviewers criticising this book because of the last two chapters. I liked the theories he presented there, without necessarily agreeing with them.\n\nAlso, I think Blackburn writes so clearly and rhythmically that you can finish this book fairly quickly, uncommon for any philosophy book. Blackburn gives an honest and critical account of all ethical ideas and theories, so you really gain a broad overview of ethics. Overall, this book is nice.\n\nFebruary 12, 2021\n\nSalah satu pengantar paling menyenangkan untuk mempelajari etika. Bahkan terasa santai sejak awal karena penulis tidak menjabarkan \"Apa itu etika?\" atau \"Apa itu moralitas?\" sebagaimana buku pengantar etika pada umumnya.\n\nKalau kamu menonton dorama guru etika berjudul \"Koko wa Ima kara Rinri desu\", mungkin buku ini paling mendekati sisi etis yang diajarkan Takayanagi-sensei. Lebih praktikal dari buku-nya DK atau Graphic Guide..\n\nKekurangan buku ini mungkin belum memasukkan masalah yang cukup pelik seperti Teori Banalitas Kejahatan oleh Hannah Arendt, kompas moral Ateisme, atau narsisme. Anyway, bintang 4 pas lah.. 😇✌️\n\nMarch 11, 2022\n\nWhile he makes some good points, I didn’t love this book. I am not a philosopher, and that kind of abstract thinking really goes over my head and doesn’t interest me much, so I wouldn’t recommend this book unless you enjoy very philosophical discussion. It felt very circular, like there was no real point to the book or main argument the author was trying to make, and I found myself apathetic to a lot of his arguments purely because I couldn’t fully grasp or understand them. I would kind of consider it a waste of time, and wouldn’t encourage anyone to read it unless they have a particular interest in philosophical reasoning.\n\nJune 23, 2022\n\nAn interesting introduction to some concepts in ethics; I thought the first section on defenses to common objections to ethics was a good way to set the stage for the rest of the book. The second section discusses ideas that commonly come up in ethics, and the third section discusses some ethical formulations and provides an optimistic view on whether ethics can have a place in society.\n\nAlthough the book didn't address many of my qualms about the role that ethics should have in one's life, it definitely helped me explore some ideas related to ethics/morality in greater detail.\n\nAugust 30, 2019\n\nDespite what other reviews might say, it is quite a good introduction to analytic ethics-- especially if you are relatively new to philosophy in general. Blackburn's style is conversational, and I could see how some people might not be a fan of that, but his arguments and explanations are straightforward and presented with clarity. Is it an end-all, knock-down solution for ethics? No, of course not. It's an introduction (which I guess is included in the title).\n\nMarch 9, 2021\n\nExactly as advertised: a short introduction to ethics. Blackburn's a clear writer who can render philosophical concepts intelligible without dumbing them down, and that's a gift. Still, there's not much meat on the bones here (as compared to his similar volume on philosophy in general, Think) and too little in the form of suggested reading or further course of study. Ok but disappointing.\n\nApril 12, 2023\n\nI found this to be a well-organized overview of morality and ethics. It's divided into three sections. First, it investigates the challenges in having a consistent and successful ethical framework (e.g. relativism and determinism.) Second, it explores a range of common issues in ethics (e.g. birth, death, paternalism, etc.) Finally, it examines some of the different approaches to ethics (e.g. virtue ethics and Kant's categorical imperatives.)\n\nI found the book to be readable and informative.\n\nJune 9, 2024\n\nThis was a great little introduction to some ethical concepts such as moral relativism, 'the death of God', deontological and utilitarian ethics, gradualism, amongst many other ideas. It had really short chapters of a few pages each which made each idea quite digestible. I'm excited to apply these ideas to other topics and to learn about them further (especially Kant's idea of 'the categorical imperative' and Hume's 'reason is the slave to the passions')."
