        "text": "What is the most important invention of the past 100 years?\n\nThe computer has to come rather high on the list. I suppose it’s a closely run thing between the computer and the aeroplane, but computers have made such a difference to life.\n\nWhat is the most important scientific discovery of the past 100 years?\n\nProbably quantum theory. The general theory of relativity was, I think, in 1915. But those two together should take pride of place. It introduced the field of probabilities as a fundamental fact of the world, instead of hard, “billiard ball” atoms. We are still trying to absorb the full meaning of that.\n\nAnd sporting event?\n\nI’m the wrong person to answer that. Andy Murray winning Wimbledon – how about that?\n\nWhich book, film, piece of music or work of art has had the greatest impact on you?\n\nI’m not in the habit of growing lists of stuff, but I think as far as books go, almost certainly A Treatise of Human Nature, first published by David Hume in 1739. That’s the most important philosophical book in my life. Most works since can be seen as footnotes to Hume.\n\nIt’s quite difficult to separate out one painting. I keep coming back to small portraits. Leonardo’s portrait of Ginevra de’ Benci has always been very moving. There is also a wonderful Titian of a man called Alessandro [Cardinal] Farnese.\n\nWho is the most influential or significant politician of the past 100 years?\n\nIf we are being British, I suppose we would have to say Mrs Thatcher. It’s a pity, but it’s probably true.\n\nAnd author or playwright?\n\nThe playwright I’m not so sure about. Some people might say Harold Pinter but I’m not certain I agree. Perhaps Samuel Beckett. For an author . . . if I’m allowed to include philosophical authors, I would say Ludwig Wittgenstein. He introduced an important voice into the philosophical conversation. He brought pragmatism into the British mainstream, where it had not been before. Pragmatism was thought of as an American aberration.\n\nAnd artist?\n\nFrom the past century, one would have to cite Picasso. He changed so many genres of art.\n\nHow about someone in business?\n\nI don’t think I know any. Perhaps the guy who invented Google.\n\nAnd a sportsperson?\n\nMuhammad Ali gave a certain kind of inspiration to a lot of people.\n\nWhat about a philanthropist?\n\nAre there many left? The funny thing is that some of the great philanthropists were Edwardian robber barons, such as Andrew Carnegie. They spent their lives sucking blood out of the poor, then thought to redeem themselves by giving it all back. In terms of this century, I would name Bill Gates.\n\nWhat is your favourite speech?\n\nI think the greatest speech of the 20th century is Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream”. The rhetorical power is just amazing.\n\nDo you have a favourite quotation?\n\nLines I find swimming through my head quite often are:\n\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold\n\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\n\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold . . .\n\nIt’s one of Shakespeare’s sonnets, a lamentation on old age. I do feel old sometimes when I wake up in the morning.\n\nWhat do you think will be the most significant change to our lives in the next 100 years?\n\nI’m not really sure I envisage any significant change. I would like to see a period of relative stasis, so that people’s obsession with economic progress starts to become less obsessive.\n\nWhat is your main concern for the future?\n\nWe are going to have to learn to do without all the energy that we have been depleting.\n\nWhat will be the most dramatic development in your own field?\n\nI think Anglo-American philosophy needs to become more practical and Continental philosophy needs to become more analytical. That would be very good for both sides.\n\nWhat is the most important priority for the future well-being of people and our planet?\n\nA return to an understanding of co-operative existence, away from the relentlessly competitive and individualistic ideologies that animate so much discussion these days.\n\nThe stresses of the modern world are only just beginning to show themselves. They include a few winners and all sorts of losers: the decline of the middle classes and of employment – and therefore hopelessness.\n\nHopelessness breeds war and all kinds of social ills – terrorism and so on."
