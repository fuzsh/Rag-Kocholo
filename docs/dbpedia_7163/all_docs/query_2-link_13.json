        "text": "I was going to say, “Well, why would Hegel be in the running?” … And then I saw the list. Sartre (who isn’t as good as, say, Gadamer)? Epicurus (but not Heraclitus)? Popper (but not Davidson or Kripke)?\n\nI then went to bookshelves to try to find a more suitable number to flesh out the 20–and it’s hard. Strange that, in all of human history, it’s a stretch to find 20 truly great philosophers. Is there any other field with such a paucity of “greatness”? I mean, couldn’t you dash of lists of 20 great composers, poets, novelists, painters, etcetera?\n\nOf course, there’re really only three to choose from: Plato, Aristotle, Kant… with Plato taking the prize.\n\n“Epicurus (but not Heraclitus)? Popper (but not Davidson or Kripke)?”\n\nYep, also curious choices.\n\n“Strange that, in all of human history, itâ€™s a stretch to find 20 truly great philosophers.”\n\nIt depends on how you’re measuring “greatness,” I guess. The best way to explain some of the choices seems to be as measures of influence and name recognition more than anything else; that would certainly explain Marx, Nietzsche and Sartre for me (I haven’t listened to any of the little “why I voted for them” clips, though). The problem is that thinkers who could begin to compete with the undisputed greats for breadth and quality of thought really don’t have much in the way of wider name recognition; that’s the best way I could explain the total omission of Eastern philosophy of any kind.\n\nWeâ€™re all bloody Hume fans apparently.\n\nHere’s my theory: anybody who isn’t actually a philosopher by trade or avocation would pick Hume in a heartbeat, because his basic message is, “all that ridiculous philosophy stuff philosophers do is a waste of time.” (Late Wittgenstein said roughly the same thing, but in a way much more flattering to philosophers, at the price of being a waste of time for non-philosophers.)\n\nHence, while philosophy buffs can engage in heated debates about the top philosopher, once everyone else is included, it’s Hume in a landslide.\n\nHey kids, remember when the lad Quiggin stirred up a fuss by pointing out that “music” didn’t just Western art music? We have, I assert, an exact parallel on our hands: not only are Confucius and Lao-Tse conspicuous, as has been noted, by their absence, but also there is the obvious fact that questions the neo-scholastic philosophes of the Anglo-American still mistake for their property have, for some time now, been addressed far more interestingly outside the confines of their discipline.\n\nSo I’m voting for Buddha, Confucius, Marx (who certainly belongs on a more interesting list than theirs), Weber, Durkheim, Freud, Lacan, Levi-Strauss, Foucault and — greatest of all by far — Wiley E Coyote. As Camus said, “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”\n\n“Non-philosophers tend to be more partial to the â€œridiculous philosophy stuffâ€”\n\nOnly a certain stripe of non-philosopher, though, usually with some training in another humanities discipline. But I think the more general non-philosopher would only be tempted to pick Hume if they’re British (and fair enough, it is a BBC poll after all) — elsewhere I think they’d be likelier to go for Aristotle or Aquinas, or maybe Mill. All of whom are perfectly defensible choices, as it turns out.\n\nFar as French postrucutralists go, I’ve always found them more interesting than their detractors are willing to admit and less impressive than their disciples seem to think; I don’t know that I’d put them on a list of “greatest” thinkers. I’d say Weber, Freud and Lacan belong on a list of most-overrated thinkers… but that’s just me.\n\nA conjecture: being a fluent reader of English makes Hume extremely appealing. I’ve no idea what he’s like in translation but in English he is wonderful. Russell, Quine, Carnap, Wittgenstein, Feyerabend when in serious mood — they’re all regurgitating Hume. (Ayer??)\n\nRegarding him as the greatest, or taking him on as my favourite, by the way, doesn’t imply that I agree with anything he says. Almost the opposite is true.\n\nIf we were talking about political philosophers only, btw, I think I’d agree with Quiggin. If moral philosophers only I’d go for Aristotle or Kant.\n\nI imagine Popper is on the list because he worked so close to Broadcasting House. There can be no other excuse (Popper but not Carnap or Quine??)\n\nDan Simon’s comment makes me wonder if I’m right: I’m convinced that philosophers (by which I mean, parochially, people paid to work in Philosophy departments in Universities in the english-speaking world) would vote for Hume by a landslide. My data is the plural of anecdote, but it is a lot of anecdote…\n\nOh, fer chrissake, Hume is NOT seriously in the running. He’s an excellent philosopher, obviously, but no Aristotle, no Kant.\n\nYou know who’s really, really, really great but utterly misunderstood and radically underappreciated? C. S. Peirce. No, seriously!\n\nSeems like a bone-headed, meat-axe naturalist at first blush, but actually has a truly revolutionary logic of science based on a Kantian ethics of belief. We don’t even really know how important he is yet because he’s basically ignored (everybody reads “The Fixation of Belief” and “How to Make Our Ideas Clear” once apiece, and that’s it). Also, few philosophers know enough about logic, science, or the history of philosophy to read Peirce productively. Hell, I know I don’t.\n\nAnyway, it’s too early to include him on the list, but I predict that in 50 years he will be viewed very differently than he is today.\n\n“Oh, fer chrissake, Hume is NOT seriously in the running. Heâ€™s an excellent philosopher, obviously, but no Aristotle, no Kant.”\n\nOddly enough, I wouldn’t class Kant with Aristotle either. He’s a great thinker, of course, but I wouldn’t be any more inclined to nominate him the greatest than I would Hume. Which is a mildly heretical sentiment, I suppose.\n\n“I predict that in 50 years [Peirce] will be viewed very differently than he is today.”\n\nI think (or hope) the same will eventually be true of Bernard Bosanquet.\n\nIt is truly bizarre that Hegel’s not listed. I’m also a it surprised Locke didn’t get on there, though I’d be shocked if he won. To have Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger and Sartre also seems a bit existentialist-heavy.\n\nAnyway, this conversation, as I understand it, is about stating preferences more than (well, ok, in addition to) rubbishing the list [and I’ve rubbished the list over at my own blog, anyway]. I can’t really select a greatest philosopher, without violating my own philosophical views. My own preference would be for Hume or Mill — Hume for his temperament or spirit, Mill for his commitments and allegiances. But the one figure on the list who seems to me utterly inescapable is Kant, and if a gun were put to my head by some deranged BBC operative, I’d go with him.\n\nNo Siddhartha Gautama is a travesty. It’s not like he had any incredibly profound insights into the nature of human life and suffering or anything. Certainly more profound than, say, Nietszche’s shots at the same subject matter. His extended treatises on bodily fluids probably moved him out of the running.\n\nPopper and Wittgenstein are bizarre entrants in that august company, Wittgenstein’s self-regard and my love for Popper notwithstanding.\n\nWhy no love for the Locke? Not even worth a mention?\n\nI’m going with Kant. Popper soured me on Plato.\n\nWow, came from Sanchez and he let me pick 5/20. If I have to pick one it is Kant.\n\nHowever, if we remove ourselves from our modern perspective and ask who was the most important for the millions of thinkers who lived in the centuries preceding us I think you have to name one of the Greeks or a Christian:Paul,Augustine,or Aquinas.\n\nThe West was a Christian West until quite recently.\n\nAlthough I am a tremendous fan of Hume the philosopher, I do not like Harry care so much for Hume’s style. The two Enquiries are a major literary improvement over the Treatise (though not a philosophical improvement), and the Dialogues a further stylistic improvement over the Enquiries. But on the whole I find Hume’s writing a bit too orotund, precious, opaque, involved and delicate. It is also marred by passages of graceless vanity and superciliousness.\n\nI much prefer the styles of Berkeley, Hobbes and Russell.\n\nAs so many have already said, this list is slightly nuts. No Locke, no Leibniz. No effort to think that maybe, just maybe, Confucius or Mencius or Chuang-tzu or Lao-tse might have something to offer. (Or Gandhi. It’s not as though non-Western philosophy only existed anciently.) And, of course, no Hegel. And this should be clear: trying to appreciate Marx philosophically without giving due credit to Hegel is simply impossible. So to include the latter but not the former shows some pretty cracked intellectual priorities on the part of those who did the nominating.\n\nMy personal favorite out of those left out: Rousseau. Granted, Hume was a better philosopher, as well as a better person. But Rousseau has the advantage over Hume for having actually struggled with something important.\n\nI cheated and voted twice. (Once from my work IP address and once from my home IP address – what a clever cheat am I.) And I was doubly selfish, I didn’t vote for “greatest” as viewed from Olympus; I defined “greatness” as “who did the most for me.”\n\nBecause I work for a living, of the twenty candidates maybe a third are open, active enemies, almost all the rest were loftily indifferent to my low crummy sort. From work I voted for the one and only positive advocate I’ve got on the ballot, Uncle Karl. At home I live my home life, such as it is. Natch, from there I could not vote for anyone else but my man Arthur, SocÃ® malorum, compagnon de miseres, who writes:\n\n…If now, from the standpoint of this last consideration, we contemplate the turmoil of life, we behold all occupied with its want and misery, straining all their powers to satisfy its infinite needs and to ward off its multifarious sorrows, yet without daring to hope anything else than simply the preservation of this tormented existence for a short span of time. In between, however, in the midst of the tumult, we see the glances of two lovers meet longingly; yet why so secretly, fearfully, and stealthily? Because the lovers are the traitors who seek to perpetuate the whole want and drudgery, which would otherwise speedily reach an end; this they wish to frustrate, as others like them have frustrated it before.\n\nyou would find fewer than a dozen jokes, ten of them in Schopenhauer.\n\nThere’s passages in Hume that raise a chuckle too.\n\n“Celibacy, fasting, penance, mortification, self-denial, humility, silence, solitude, and the whole train of monkish virtues; for what reason are they every where rejected by men of sense… A gloomy, hair-brained enthusiast, after his death, may have a place in the calendar; but will scarcely ever be admitted, when alive, into intimacy and society, except by those who are as delirious and dismal as himself.”\n\nMakes me laugh, anyway.\n\nAnd there are plenty of jokes in Marx I thought. These days my friends get criticised for putting too many jokes in the papers, so in any case it’s nice to see demand for comedic philosophy is rising. (It would be nicer if we were succeeding in raising the supply as well.)\n\nOut of this list I’d vote for Hume, largely for the reasons Harry mentioned. I like a point Blackburn made about Ayer, one that applies to a lot of empiricists. A lot of the points Ayer made are things you get in Hume as well, and those have stood up well over time. And a lot of the points in Ayer were (relatively) new, and they haven’t stood up so well.\n\nThough if we had some more contemporary options I’d probably vote for one of them instead."
