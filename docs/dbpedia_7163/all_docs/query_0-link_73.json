        "text": "Introduction\n\nApril 27th, 2021\n\nSix years ago, I wrote and shared a little guide to studying physics called “So You Want to Learn Physics” in the hope that it would help anyone who wanted to learn physics on their own. As it turned out, people found it pretty useful (as of today, over six hundred thousand people have used it!), and ever since I published it, I’ve found myself wondering what else along those same lines I might know that I can share with others. Writing similar guides for philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and classics — all subjects that I have studied in depth both formally and informally — has long been on my to-do lists. And here, at last, is a guide to studying philosophy.\n\nThere is a kind of intellectual joy that comes from studying philosophy, and it has everything to do with the nature of the discipline. At the heart of it all is the desire to make sense of the world and our place within it — a painfully deep human desire to know who we are, what it means that we are beings that think and feel and perceive, how we should live and how we should treat others, and to know what is the nature of every other field of study (language, science, mathematics, economics…). (Note: It is no accident that so many other formal disciplines — math, linguistics, science, etc. — were originally considered within the realm of philosophy until they were mature enough to branch off on their own.)\n\nIn short, philosophy is so rewarding because it is concerned with the questions that are most fundamental and universal to the human experience. There is great satisfaction in thinking through fundamental, important things deeply, and I promise you that studying philosophy will completely change your life.\n\nThe purpose of this guide is to provide a roadmap so that anyone who follows and completes it will walk away with the knowledge equivalent to an undergraduate degree in philosophy. General philosophy education in the United States is split into undergraduate-level coursework, which is comprised of a series of overview courses of increasing difficulty that each focus on a different branch of philosophy (such as philosophy of language, or ethics, or metaphysics), and graduate-level coursework, which is generally comprised of highly specialized and narrowly-focused graduate seminars that focus on, for example, specific philosophers or philosophical theories.\n\nWhile I was putting this guide together, I went back and forth quite a bit on whether to focus only on undergraduate-level philosophy coursework or to provide both an undergraduate and graduate curriculum (the way I did for the physics guide). While I would have loved to provide the latter option, I ultimately decided to only offer an undergraduate curriculum simply because of just how highly specialized many graduate seminars can be (for example, there are many that focus on just the work of one philosopher or, in even more extreme cases, just one book or paper). But this doesn’t mean you aren’t getting an advanced education in philosophy when you study the courses in this guide: One key thing to know about the undergraduate curriculum, especially once you get into the more advanced courses, is that in many philosophy departments, the upper-level philosophy courses (such as philosophy of math and philosophy of science) are cross-listed as graduate courses and these classes will have students that are junior and senior undergraduates and will also have MA and PhD students.\n\nAnother important thing I should note is that there are two main traditions or approaches to Western philosophy: analytic and continental. While I have included an introduction to continental philosophy as an elective course at the end of the curriculum, most of the courses in this guide (especially in the second half) are courses in analytic philosophy. I decided on an analytic-focused approach for two reasons. First, most undergraduate and graduate programs in the United States have analytic-focused philosophy curriculums. Second, I strongly believe that a primarily continental-focused education supplemented by analytic electives is incomplete in a way that an analytic-focused education supplemented by continental electives is not. Logic, mathematics, and science and our philosophical approaches to them are so incredibly fundamental to the world we live in that to not study these in the way that they are taught in analytic-focused programs would lead to what I would consider an incomplete philosophical education.\n\nRemember that anyone can understand philosophy. The joy of living an examined life is accessible to anyone who has (1) the desire to think about things a little more deeply and (2) the humility and curiosity to learn from the philosophers of the past and present.\n\nGodspeed!\n\nBefore You Begin\n\nAccessible Philosophy Books\n\nBefore you dive into the more formal and difficult coursework, you might find it helpful or fun to read philosophy books that are a little more accessible than many of the textbooks you will find in the curriculum that follows. There are a few truly wonderful ones that I find myself reading and re-reading over and over, and I own multiple copies of each because I often send them to friends and acquaintances who I am trying to convince to study philosophy. The works of the Stoic philosophers are especially wonderful for this, because the Stoics were so focused on living a good and meaningful life and wrote so clearly about it.\n\nHere are a few of my favorite philosophy books that are both accessible and unforgettable:\n\nMeditations by Marcus Aurelius\n\nOn the Shortness of Life: Life Is Long if You Know How to Use It by Seneca\n\nA Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William B. Irvine\n\nJustice: What's the Right Thing to Do? by Michael J. Sandel\n\nHistories of Philosophy\n\nWhile some of the courses in the curriculum — specifically Ancient Philosophy and Modern Philosophy — are historical-survey-type courses, most of the various things you will study here are grouped by topic rather than presented chronologically and/or with detailed historical context. I’ve found that reading and referencing histories of philosophy can really help with this, and have enjoyed the following books quite a bit:\n\nA Little History of Philosophy by Nigel Warburton. A fun and simple overview.\n\nA History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell. This is a classic for a reason!\n\nA New History of Western Philosophy by Anthony Kenny (This is comprised of four volumes which can also be purchased individually: Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3, and Volume 4). This is more modern (updated) than Russell and is a good supplement to any studies.\n\nPhilosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 1: The Dawn of Analysis and Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 2: The Age of Meaning by Scott Soames. A detailed history of analytic philosophy in two volumes.\n\nHow to Study\n\nYou’ll need to do a ton of reading, analyzing, and writing if you want to understand the material presented in this curriculum. It’s not enough to sit down and read through the textbooks here once — you could do that if you really wanted to, but I highly doubt that you’d walk away with a deep understanding of the material. If you want to study philosophy well and genuinely understand it, you need to engage with the material, period.\n\nOver the years and after much formal and informal study, I’ve learned a pretty foolproof method for studying philosophy: read everything four times. Here’s how it works:\n\nFirst read: Read casually, as if you’re reading a novel or a newspaper or magazine article. Your goal here is simply to observe, not to engage (yet).\n\nSecond read: This time, read to understand. Take notes. Ask yourself, “what does the author really mean here?” Summarize things in your own words. Try to break down the arguments being presented into bullet points, identifying the premises and the conclusions. When you read a term you are unfamiliar with or want to understand better, google it or look it up in the SEP.\n\nThird read: Read again, and this time engage with the text. Go back to your notes, where you identified the arguments being presented. Think of arguments in favor of what the author is saying and arguments against. Think of counterexamples.\n\nFourth read: Now read for one last time. Read casually, the way you did in the first read. Notice how your understanding of the text is now so much richer and deeper than it was on the first read.\n\nIf you study this way, you’ll walk away with an incredibly solid understanding of philosophy and an intellectual foundation that will serve you well for the rest of your life.\n\nIn addition to studying and analyzing, you should also write short papers about what you are studying. I recommend writing at least one 5-10 page paper per class. Choose a subtopic, a paper, a book, or an argument that you covered in the book, and write a paper about it. In the appendix of the main textbook in the Introduction to Ethics course, you will find a very helpful overview of how to write a philosophy paper. You should also read Doug Portmore’s guide to writing philosophy papers, which will help you understand how to think about and structure a philosophy paper.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nOne of the most amazing resources available is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, also known as the “SEP.” It is completely online, completely free, and filled with detailed and comprehensive entries on every topic imaginable. Before you start the coursework, you should familiarize yourself with the SEP and bookmark the website. Once you begin your studies, you should read the SEP articles on the topics you are studying. If you would like to have PDFs of the articles, you can join the Friends of the SEP Society, where for a small membership fee you can have the benefit of beautifully formatted PDFs and the joy of supporting a truly wonderful resource.\n\nAnother important resource you should be familiar with is philpapers.org. This is a truly staggeringly enormous bibliography of philosophical research in every area of philosophy. It’s a great place to go if you want to find out what research is being done in various areas, though it is a bit overwhelming and easy to get lost in the weeds.\n\nOnline Undergraduate Degree Programs\n\nIf you fall in love with philosophy and would like to obtain a bachelor’s degree in it (and perhaps someday go on to get a PhD!), you can of course apply to your local university and, if accepted, pursue a degree. But if this is not feasible for you — if, perhaps, you need some flexibility in your schedule because you have other more pressing obligations — and you still want to study philosophy formally, you should consider an online degree program.\n\nThe absolute best online undergraduate philosophy degree program is offered by Arizona State University: ASU Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. I can speak from experience that the philosophy department is excellent and the courses are wonderful (I studied there for several years and took many undergraduate and graduate courses in philosophy in their program before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania). I can also speak to the high quality of the online degree programs — I recently took a few courses for fun and registered for an economics degree that will probably take me years to get because I’m taking one class here and there as I’m able. The cost is not insignificant, but there are many financial aid options. You can pursue a first bachelor’s degree, a second if you already have one, or you can register as not pursuing any particular degree and take a selection of courses that way.\n\nThere are several other online programs I have heard of, though I do not have any direct experience of them, including the University of Arizona, the University of Illinois Springfield, and Oregon State University. If you are interested, I encourage you to reach out to the schools and learn more about their programs."
