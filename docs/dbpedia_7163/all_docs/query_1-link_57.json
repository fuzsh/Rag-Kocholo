You actually mentioned what other professions argued about non existence of God or gods,but I didn't see your contribution of philosophy to the subject matter. In essence you were not coming from philosophical understanding,rather from predominantly scientific subjectivity. I understand the nature of scientific findings as an empirically oriented profession. Nevertheless, philosophy is much more depth as the mother of all professions. It is in this regard that a whole major branch of philosophy called Metaphysics is dedicated to realities beyond the physical or better still,say transcendental realities. In the noble field of philosophy,it is not all knowledgè that is empirically verifiability or evidenced,that is why we have rationalistic knowledge, and such knowledge are self based or participatory knowledge. In this case it is possible for two different people with the same approach to have different understanding. From ancient to pre socratic era, modern to contemporary philosophical discussions,the concept of God, spirits,ghosts, ancestors,deities and oracles have featured prominently in the profession of philosophy. Hence,one agreeing or disagreeing with it is dependent on the school of thought he belongs to,yet his position does not in anyway possess the potency of bring the discuss to sudden end. I guess people from other professions need to have Understandability of this peculiar nature of philosophy. ISN-ODPFMP: Nebeolism-Igweism (2024/01/11)\n\nWe can distinguish three modes of philosophy-ing. Together, these modes constitute a \"practical ekoPhilosophy.\" Having a Philosophy: This refers to possessing a set of beliefs, values, principles, or philosophical commitments that guide one's thinking, actions, and worldview. Having a philosophy entails adopting a coherent framework of ideas that inform one's understanding of reality, ethics, knowledge, and existence. For example, someone might \"have\" a philosophy of existentialism, stoicism, or utilitarianism, among others. Practicing Philosophy: Practicing philosophy encompasses both theoretical and practical engagement with philosophical ideas and methods. It involves activities such as critical thinking, questioning assumptions, engaging in dialogue, and exploring fundamental questions about existence, morality, knowledge, and meaning. Philosophical practice can take various forms, including reading philosophical texts, engaging in Socratic dialogue, writing essays or reflections, and participating in philosophical communities or discussions. Practicing philosophy is something we do at the PhilosophyGym (get in touch if you are interested). Living Philosophically: Living philosophically goes beyond merely possessing abstract philosophical beliefs; it involves embodying and applying philosophical principles in one's everyday life. This concept, often associated with Pierre Hadot's notion of \"philosophy as a way of life,\" emphasizes the practical application of philosophical wisdom to cultivate virtues, foster self-awareness, and navigate everyday life. Living philosophically integrates philosophy-ing into one's ways of knowing, being and acting within all relationships. #philosophy #regeneration #planetaryhealth\n\nFLASH BACK OF (2019/06/09) THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHICAL POSTULATIONS AND THEORIES The nature of philosophical postulations and theories: Over the centuries,philosophers have been using postulations and theories to explain and profer solution to societal problems. Such thought have been so peculiar to the profession,even to the extent that if you are alien to the field,it may appear senseless to you at the first pronouncement,or you may even think that the person making the statement had gone out of his mind,basically because there are designed in such a way that if it has not been explained to you before,you would need an explanation to make sense out of it. On the other hand, certain people had thought that philosophers purposely create ambiguities around the profession to make a show of themselves or to confuse people the more. But the truth remains that,there is a tradition that govern every field of endeavour( that for the purpose of this discuss,i will call professional Integrity),and if such tradition is not properly followed,it will jeopardise the real essence of the profession. In view of this,philosophy as a noble field of endeavour should of a necessity be an ardent observer of professional Integrity,to enable others to continue learning from. In line with the above understanding,plato theory of the \"world of form(Platonism)\" is popular to those who had been taught Philosophy or those who had studied some philosophical literatures privately. Just as René Descartes \"cogito ergo sum(Descartism)\" stands the same chance. Immanuel Kant's \"categorical imperative\" and the renowned 20th century social justice theorist,John Rawls \"veil of ignorance\" is not left behind. Another aspect of philosophical theories worthy of note is that philosophical theories are usually synonymous with the propounder's name, such that when you mention a Philosopher's name,his theory comes to mind ,and when you mention his theory,his name also comes to mind. Also, it is important to note that philosophers do not chose nor give philosophical brand name to themselves, it is the system and the scholars within the field who have seen their exploits or tendencies of scholarly philosophism that gave them those titles or brand names . Just as it was my lecturers and fellow students that started calling me Nebeolism or Igweism ( even far before I ventured into Philosophical theorising), this I explained in my article \"why not Nebeolism or Igweism\", dated 2019/04/26.. It was on that ground that I brought the names together as Nebeolism-Igweism, that was basically done to avoid unnecessary intellectual debates, arguments, contentions, complications or confusions about my Philosophical and ideological brand name. Accordingly, \" Reminiscencing-transcendency theory/RTT (Nebeolism-Igweism)\",as a 21st century philosophical theory has as well kept to the philosophical tradition,or professional Integrity of Philosophical theorising.
