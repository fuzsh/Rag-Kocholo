This document provides a critical review and analysis of Martin Heidegger's later philosophical work Contributions to Philosophy: From Enowning. The reviewer argues that Heidegger's writing in this work has drifted far from phenomenology into unintelligible mysticism and mantra-like repetitions that aspire to create a religious experience for the reader rather than convey philosophical content or ideas that can be assessed. Key passages from Contributions are analyzed to illustrate how Heidegger combines made-up words and impenetrable syntax to evoke vague feelings rather than communicate clear ideas.",
