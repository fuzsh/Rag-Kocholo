        "text": "This little guide engages in the challenge of flying with wings, despite being aware of the dangers, while still remembering the labyrinth of Knossos and the adventure of Daedalus. Watched from the air, the labyrinth of philosophy, offers a surprise: the complexity is only apparent and comes down to the repetition of a simple geometry\n\nThe primary concern of philosophy is the study of ideas central to the ways we think and live. Accordingly, philosophical thinking is nothing but the quest for answers to relevant questions that have to do with our lives as individuals as well as a society. The value, however, of many of our key concepts-related to these answers-is often hidden from us. We take the ways we make sense of ourselves and the world for granted, but philosophy goes further than what is evident: Philosophy is the art of closing your eyes and opening your mind.\n\nThis essay presents the origins and fundamentals of philosophy from antiquity to the birth of systematic and logical reflections on idealism and realism, their impact on our systematic thought life and the significance of philosophy for today. The essay is meant for college and university students to prepare them for a good grasp about philosophical issues, concerns and problems, before they begin to delve into the rigorous depths of philosophical discourses set for us, from antiquity to postmodernity by such legendary philosophers as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Rene Descartes, Friedrich Hegel, Immanuel Kant, Baruch Spinoza and Karl Marx. The research methods used for this essay were mainly social qualitative research methods, where textual analysis and criticism was employed to creatively interact with both primary and secondary sources of data, premised on data analysis, interpretation and application. The finding was that Philosophy as a discipline of study, concerns itself with general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The conclusion is that, when all is said and done, Philosophy, the Queen of sciences, which permeates all sciences (all knowledge), ought to move society towards happiness, well-being, wholeness, fulfilment and harmony, by means of very thorough and life-affirming critical reflections on nature, meaning, goal and essence of natural life."
