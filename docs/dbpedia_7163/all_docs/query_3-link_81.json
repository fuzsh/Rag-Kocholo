        "text": "Philosophy involves general and rational inquiry into questions and ideas that fall outside religion and science. As a field of study it helps to make sense of general and fundamental conditions concerning human matters such as existence, mind & body, values, truth, knowledge and more. This lesson will provide a very general introduction to philosophy and its contributions to understanding what it means to be human.\n\nLesson Objectives\n\ndefine philosophy\n\nrecognize European and non-European philosophical approaches\n\nevaluate a philosophical perspective and its applicability to everyday life\n\ndevelop a personal philosophy about what it means to be human\n\nWhat is Philosophy?\n\n‘Philo’ means love, and ‘sophia’ means wisdom. Therefore, philosophy is the ‘love of wisdom.’ In the ancient Greek tradition, philosophy was the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, and it included a wide range of areas such as the arts, sciences and religion. Today, philosophy is a field of study outside of religion and science, and it seeks to address existential and reflective problems that are unsolved through experimentation and doctrine.\n\nPhilosophy is the systematic study of ideas and issues, a reasoned pursuit of fundamental truths, a quest for a comprehensive understanding of the world, a study of principles of conduct, and much more. Every domain of human experience raises questions to which its techniques and theories apply, and its methods may be used in the study of any subject or the pursuit of any vocation. Indeed, philosophy is in a sense inescapable: life confronts every thoughtful person with some philosophical questions, and nearly everyone is guided by philosophical assumptions, even if unconsciously. One need not be unprepared. “\n\n“A Brief Guide for Undergraduates” by the American Philosophical Association\n\nPhilosophy has contributed some of the most important and influential ideas shaping politics, law, physics, math, science and other academic fields that generate effects on human life. Philosophy also provides creative ways of thinking and contemplating phenomena that can be difficult to grasp such as equality, justice, the meaning of life, death and dying, love, beauty, right & wrong, and more.\n\nAt the same time, however, philosophy has also yielded concepts that have been disproven, undermined, or determined erroneous. Watch the Tedtalk video below to learn about the variety ideas set forth by Plato, one of the most important philosophers in the European tradition, that are no longer in favor.\n\nAlthough Plato was off the mark on quite a few ideas, philosophy, like science, is based on the critical practice of arguing, contesting, and disputing philosophical ideas and concepts. This makes philosophy a dynamic and ever-changing field of practice that provides thinkers with tools and frameworks to approach inquiries into the state and condition of being human.\n\nCategorizing Philosophical Approaches\n\nAs an academic discipline and field of study, contemporary approaches to philosophy covers an expansive range of topics, problems, ideas and themes. As a result, the field is often organized into several different categories. The largest division recognized in the United States and in Europe is based on a Euro-centric organization of geographic variations: Eastern Philosophy (non-European) and Western Philosophy (European.) Far from being isolated, however, philosophical approaches have spread thousands of miles over thousands and years through trade, migration and cultural exchanges between Asia, Africa, Europe and eventually the Americas. There has always been interplay between ‘east and west,’ and the geographic categories within the field of philosophy simply serve to help organize a massive body of numerous philosophical approaches rather than a concrete divide between distinctively different ways of thinking.\n\nWestern Philosophy\n\nWestern philosophy is a term used to refer to philosophical thought and practice tied to European philosophers, beginning with the Greek Classical period that begins with the pre-Socratics such as Thales (7th century BCE), Pythagoras (6th-5th century BCE), and Classical Greek philosophers such as Plato (5th-4th century BCE), Aristotle (4th century BCE) and Socrates (5th-4th century BCE). Through several centuries, European philosophies spread throughout the world as European empires colonized areas outside of Europe. As a result, new philosophical developments that draw from or build upon European philosophies are also referred to as Western philosophy even if they emerge outside of Europe. The chart below presents different ‘branches’ of Western philosophy and their particular approach, perspective, or problem.\n\nContinental Philosophy\n\nWithin Western philosophy, the term Continental Philosophy refers to philosophical traditions that emerged from mainland Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries. Continental philosophy includes phenomenology, existentialism, hermeneutics, structuralism, post-structuralism, deconstruction, French feminism, German Idealism and critical theory. Continental philosophy argues that conditions and/or experiences are determined at least partly by factors such as context, space and time, language, culture, and/or history. For example, the previous lesson on Truth and Perspective presented continental philosophical approaches such as Neitzsche’s context-based perspectivism and Foucault’s historical framework on the relationship between truth and power. Critical inquiry emerging from continental philosophical trends stimulated the development of contemporary theoretical approaches such as Critical Race Theory (CRT), which investigates the experiences of race and racism within social, historical and legal contexts. The video below breaks down critical race theory and the recent political controversy surrounding CRT.\n\nEastern, or Non-Western, Philosophy\n\nEastern Philosophy is a generalized term that primarily refers to philosophical approaches that originated outside of Europe. Unlike European, or Western philosophies, many Eastern philosophies emerge from expansive religious traditions that include philosophical elements within religious practice that date as far back as 5,000 years ago. Similar to Western philosophies, most Eastern philosophies attempt to provide answers to complex questions centered on topics such as existence, reality and ethics; yet many Eastern philosophies also provide frameworks for life, social interactions, ways of being and relationships with the divine or supernatural. The list below provides a few examples of eastern philosophical traditions.\n\nOutside the East-West Divide\n\nIn addition to Eastern and Western geographical divisions, it is also important to note the wide variety of old and new philosophical approaches outside the East-West divide. In his three-volume book, Black Athena: the Afro-Asiatic Roots of Classical Civilization (1987), Martin Bernal argues that classical European philosophy owes its origins to earlier Egyptian philosophers; and this ties the origins of European philosophy to Africa. He points out that some of the oldest philosophical texts were produced in Ancient Egypt (Kemet) from 2200 to 1000 BCE. One of the earliest known African philosophers was Ptahhotep. The ancient Greeks acknowledged the Egyptian philosophers in the 5th century BCE when Isocrates declared that earliest Greek thinkers traveled to Egypt to seek knowledge; one of them Pythagoras of Samos who “was first to bring to the Greeks all philosophy.” New research now shows that “the founding Greek word philosophos, lover of wisdom, is itself a borrowing from and translation of the Egyptian concept mer-rekh (mr-rḫ) which literally means “lover of wisdom,” or knowledge.”\n\nToday, the term Africana philosophy refers to the philosophical perspectives developed by African people and people of African descent. In the early and mid-twentieth century, the enslavement of African people and European colonization of Africa contributed to the development of a distinct modern African political philosophy centered on questions about freedom, equality, justice and rights. Contemporary African philosophers contribte to various academic fields within philosophy such as metaphysics, epistemology, moral philosophy, and political philosophy.\n\nSimilarly, philosophical developments in Russia during the turnof the 20th centry questioned social ethics and political philosophy which included ideas about the relationship between individuals and the State, work, civil duty, and rights. Notable Russian philosophers include Mikhail Bakunin, the father of anarchism, and his legacy on workers rights, and the relationship between God and the State. Leo Tolstoy not only produced fictional parables with philosophical questions and lessons, “tolstoism” is considered a Russian version of Christian evangelism. Nikolai Berdiaev was a religious existentialist, a philosopher of personality and freedom whose basic concepts are “nothingness” and “creativity.” Vladimir Lenin is considered the father of Soviet “dialectical materialism.” Mikhail Bakhtin, the theoretician of the dialogue, polyphony, and carnival.\n\nApplied Philosophy in the Humanities\n\nThe field of philosophy is ancient, vast and deep; and this makes it difficult to provide a comprehensive introduction in a single lesson. Yet it is useful to consider the ways that philosophical perspectives can bear upon the practical issues of everyday life. Applied philosophy targets matters of practical concern by integrating philosophical tools into discussion in a way that puts theory into practice in order to confront societal problems and issues related to business, education, art, ,the environment, government, health care, law, psychology, science and more. Philosophy can provide frameworks to examine ethical dilemmas and professional or personal challenges in private and public domains. In this way, studying philosophy and its applicability to life ca help us develop a better understanding of what it means to be human.\n\nContemporary psychology is also making use of philosophical approaches to ways of living in the modern world. Scholars and ‘self-betterment’ authors such as Ryan Holiday are drawing from ancient philosophy to develop new approaches to dealing with contemporary life. Watch the video below and consider how ancient philosophy can be applicable to day-to-day living\n\nReferences and Resources\n\nTo learn more about philosophy in the humanities, explore the links below.\n\nBlackburn, Simon.2001.
