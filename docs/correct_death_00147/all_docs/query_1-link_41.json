        "text": "PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) — The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office has revealed what potentially led up to the deadly attack on 16-year-old Preston Lord at a Halloween party in Queen Creek: a gold chain stolen from one of Lord’s friends.\n\nFriday morning, the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office released the indictment that covers all seven suspects accused in Lord’s murder, which includes vague details about the aggravated robbery charges against Treston Billey, Jacob Meisner and Dominic Turner.\n\nAccording to the MCAO, the gold chain belonged to one of Lord’s friends and was taken on the same night as the deadly attack: Oct. 28, 2023. The indictment doesn’t name the person who owned the property because they are a victim and under the age of 18.\n\nWhen Lord and his friends tried to get it back, a confrontation ensued between the two groups. Officials say Lord and his friends ran, but were chased. That’s when the attack occurred.\n\nOther details have not been released, as all police probable cause statements remain sealed.\n\nThe release of the indictment comes days after seven arrests were made in connection to Lord’s death. Multiple search warrants executed this week led up to a late-night news conference where state officials announced the first four indictments. The other three suspects were later identified through media interviews and court records.\n\nWhat charges are each of the suspects facing?\n\nTreston Billey\n\nFirst-degree murder (and/or second-degree murder in the alternative)\n\nKidnapping\n\nAggravated robbery\n\nWilliam Owen Hines\n\nFirst-degree murder (and/or second-degree murder in the alternative)\n\nKidnapping\n\nJacob Meisner\n\nFirst-degree murder (and/or second-degree murder in the alternative)\n\nAggravated robbery\n\nKidnapping\n\nTalan Renner\n\nFirst-degree murder (and/or second-degree murder in the alternative)\n\nKidnapping\n\nTaylor Sherman\n\nFirst-degree murder (and/or second-degree murder in the alternative)\n\nKidnapping\n\nDominic Turner\n\nFirst-degree murder (and/or second-degree murder in the alternative)\n\nAggravated robbery\n\nKidnapping\n\nTalyn Vigil\n\nFirst-degree murder (and/or second-degree murder in the alternative)\n\nKidnapping\n\nTimeline of events\n\nSaturday, Oct. 28, 2023\n\n9:07 p.m.: QCPD’s non-emergency line receives a call about a possible disturbance involving juveniles near 194th and Via Del Oro.
