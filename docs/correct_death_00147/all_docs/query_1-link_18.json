        "text": "haven't been on in a while, so if this has been covered..sorry\n\nLOS ANGELES (June 6) - Keyboardist Billy Preston, a so-called \"fifth Beatle\" who also played with the Rolling Stones and enjoyed solo success in his own right, died in Arizona on Tuesday after a long illness. He was 59.\n\n'Fifth Beatle' Passes Away\n\n-----\n\nWatch Video:\n\nBilly Preston Dead at 59\n\nBilly's Tunes:\n\n'Nothing from Nothing'\n\n'You Are So Beautiful'\n\n'Struttin'' 'That's the Way God Planned It'\n\nPreston had been in a coma at Scottsdale Healthcare Shea in Scottsdale, Arizona, since last November after suffering kidney failure and related illnesses, the legacy of a longtime battle with drugs that landed him in prison in the late 1990s.\n\nHis sister, Lettie Preston, told Reuters his condition worsened over the weekend. An autopsy will be performed, and his funeral will take place in Los Angeles, she said.\n\nA young keyboards prodigy, the Houston , Texas, native spent most of his life in the entertainment business. While still a teenager, he played with the likes of Mahalia Jackson, Little Richard and Ray Charles . With his large Afro hairstyle, ever-present gap-toothed smile and funky clothing style, he was a popular on-stage presence.\n\nHe entered the Beatles ' orbit in 1969, as the band was on the verge of breaking up, and helped to soothe some of the tension. He performed on both sides of the \"Get Back\"/\"Don't Let Me Down\" single, which was credited to \"The Beatles with Billy Preston\" -- the first time the band had shared the spotlight with a sideman. He also accompanied them during their last concert that year, the famous rooftop gig in London.\n\nIn the early 1970s, he topped the charts as a solo act with the Grammy-winning instrumental \"Outa Space,\" \"Will It Go Round in Circles\" and \"Nothing From Nothing.\" He also wrote Joe Cocker's 1974 hit \"You Are So Beautiful.\"\n\nAt the same time, he was becoming a fixture with the Rolling Stones, recording such tracks as \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\" and \"Heartbreaker,\" and playing on several tours.\n\n\"He's just such a great player, singer and songwriter and has spiced up so many recordings with his keyboard prowess,\" said current Rolling Stones tour keyboardist Chuck Leavell. \"He's one of my true heroes.\"\n\nPreston's private life was darker. In 1997, a California judge sentenced him to three years in prison for violating the terms of his probation for a cocaine possession conviction handed out earlier that year.\n\nBorn William Everett Preston on September 9, 1946, he moved with his family to Los Angeles when he was 2. He appeared in the 1958 film \"St. Louis Blues,\" which starred Nat King Cole as bluesman W.C. Handy. Preston played Handy as a child. Gospel legend Mahalia Jackson was also in the film, and he would go on to play organ on some of her best-known recordings, including \"In the Upper Room.\"\n\nWITH THE BEATLES\n\nIn 1962, Little Richard hired Preston to join his backing band for a European tour. He met the Beatles during their residency at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany, and also Sam Cooke, who signed him to his SAR label. But Cooke was killed two years later, and Preston signed with Vee Jay records, one-time American home of the Beatles , through which he released an instrumental gospel record.\n\nAfter a stint playing in the house band for the TV show \"Shindig,\" he joined Ray Charles ' band. Beatles guitarist George Harrison renewed their friendship, and brought him into the tense Apple Studios in January 1969 where the Fab Four were barely speaking to each other while working on the \"Let It Be\" film and recording projects.\n\nHis organ handiwork can also be heard on such Beatle songs as \"Let It Be,\" \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" and \"Something.\"\n\nHarrison signed him to Apple Records and co-produced Preston's two albums for the label, \"That's the Way God Planned It\" and \"Encouraging Words.\"\n\nPreston also contributed to many Beatle solo albums, including Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass,\" John Lennon 's \"Sometime in New York City\" and Ringo Starr 's \"Sentimental Journey.\" He won a Grammy as a performer on the Harrison-orchestrated 1973 album of the year \"The Concert for Bangladesh.\"\n\nHis credits with the Rolling Stones included the albums \"Sticky Fingers\" and \"Black and Blue.\" He was a favorite of Mick Jagger , who danced seductively with Preston in the video clip for \"Hey Negrita.\" Not only did he tour with the Stones, but he also opened for them.\n\nIn his later years, he toured with Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood, as well as Motown session musicians the Funk Brothers. He also was featured on Ray Charles ' last album \"Genius Loves Company,\" as well as the latest albums by Neil Diamond and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nSIDE NOTE FROM MWU: of all the shows on TV, American Idol showed BP the most love lately; he performed with vonzell solomon on the 2005 finale, and then randy jackson pointed out that he wrote you are so beautiful just before Taylor Hicks sang it\n\n[Edited 6/6/06 17:09pm]\n\nyou look better on your facebook page than you do in person"
