        "text": "This track is so alive. Lennon’s voice as always cuts through as always and Lennon’s sense of rhythm is different as always. He wrote and recorded this song in one day. John enlisted George Harrison, Klaus Voormann, Alan White, and Billy Preston to help him record the song. He also got Mal Evans, a Beatles road manager, to do the chimes, handclaps, and backing vocals. He is playing tambourine in the video below. The song was recorded on January 27, 1970, and released to the public on February 6, 1970.\n\nI always tell people that I prefer John’s early albums to his later ones and to Pauls early ones. John had an edge to him that Paul didn’t have until Band on the Run… to me anyway.\n\nThe chorus was made up of Mal Evans, Yoko, and a small group of strangers Lennon rounded up from a West End pub called Hatchetts.\n\nThe song peaked at #3 in the Billboard 100, #2 in Canada, #4 in New Zealand, and #5 in the UK in 1970. Phil Spector produced this track with great results. John kept it simple and Spector produced an exciting record and didn’t overproduce it because John reigned him in. The drums are really in your face in this recording.\n\nStephen King has said the novel The Shining got its inspiration from this song with the chorus of “We all shine on.”. Before Lennon would let Spector touch the Let It Be tapes…he tried him out on this song to see if he could not overproduce something this sparse and have a hit.\n\nYoko caught a lot of heat in 1993 when she let Nike use this song in a commercial. I will give her credit on this one… she took the $800,000 that Nike gave her, and gave it to the United Negro College Fund. Nowadays no one says anything about it as much because it’s much more commonplace now.\n\nJohn Lennon: “I wrote it in the morning on the piano. I went to the office and sang it many times. So I said ‘Hell, let’s do it,’ and we booked the studio, and Phil came in, and said, ‘How do you want it?’ I said, ‘You know, 1950’s.’ He said, ‘right,’ and boom, I did it in about three goes or something like that. I went in and he played it back and there it was. The only argument was that I said a bit more bass, that’s all, and off we went.”\n\nYoko Ono: “It’s like, ‘Let’s all be together and anybody who’s out there who’s not in this game, why don’t you join us?,'” she told Uncut in 1998. “And to say that ‘We all shine on,’ it’s a beautiful, beautiful thing, instead of saying some people are shining and some people are not. It’s a really uplifting song.”\n\nInstant Karma\n\nInstant Karma’s gonna get you\n\nGonna knock you right on the head\n\nYou better get yourself together\n\nPretty soon you’re gonna be dead\n\nWhat in the world you thinking of\n\nLaughing in the face of love\n\nWhat on earth you tryin’ to do\n\nIt’s up to you, yeah you\n\nInstant Karma’s gonna get you\n\nGonna look you right in the face\n\nBetter get yourself together darlin’\n\nJoin the human race\n\nHow in the world you gonna see\n\nLaughin’ at fools like me\n\nWho in the hell d’you think you are\n\nA super star\n\nWell, right you are\n\nWell we all shine on\n\nLike the moon and the stars and the sun\n\nWell we all shine on\n\nEv’ryone come on\n\nInstant Karma’s gonna get you\n\nGonna knock you off your feet\n\nBetter recognize your brothers\n\nEv’ryone you meet\n\nWhy in the world are we here\n\nSurely not to live in pain and fear\n\nWhy on earth are you there\n\nWhen you’re ev’rywhere\n\nCome and get your share\n\nWell we all shine on\n\nLike the moon and the stars and the sun\n\nYeah we all shine on\n\nCome on and on and on on on\n\nYeah yeah, alright, uh huh, ah\n\nWell we all shine on\n\nLike the moon and the stars and the sun\n\nYeah we all shine on\n\nOn and on and on on and on\n\nWell we all shine on\n\nLike the moon and the stars and the sun\n\nWell we all shine on\n\nLike the moon and the stars and the sun\n\nWell we all shine on\n\nLike the moon and the stars and the sun\n\nYeah we all shine on\n\nLike the moon and the stars and the sun\n\nThis song was on the Exile On Main Street album. The original lyrics were started in 1968 about Brian Jones while he was still a member. It was about his drug habits and decline as a musician and human. After Brian died, Mick rewrote some of the lyrics and we got this gospel-sounding song with the help of Billy Preston and Leon Russell. Leon and Mick Jagger recorded an early version of this song called “(Can’t Seem To) Get a Line on You.”\n\nKeith Richards and Charlie Watts are not on this song. Mick Taylor has claimed to play guitar and bass. Bill Wyman later said that he played bass on the song, not Taylor but Taylor did play guitar. The producer Jimmy Miller played drums on this track with Billy Preston on piano and organ. Clydie King, Joe Greene, Venetta Fields, and Jesse Kirkland sang back up.\n\nAllen Klein owned all of the rights to Stones’ songs written before 1970. Somehow he fooled Mick and Keith into signing all of their rights away to their sixties catalog. Klein got wind of five songs on this album that were written in the 60s and yes…he sued them and got a share of the profits on this album. The songs were Sweet Virginia, Loving Cup, All Down the Line, Shine a Light, and Stop Breaking Down. Although this song is credited to Jagger-Richards…Leon Russell is said to have co-written it with Mick.\n\nThe song gave its name to a 2008 Martin Scorsese film chronicling the Stones’ Beacon Theatre performances on the latter tour, and the 2006 performance is included on the soundtrack album. Mick Jagger has named this his favorite song on Exile on Main Street.\n\nMick Jagger: “When I was very friendly with Billy\n\nPreston in the ’70s I sometimes used to go to church with him in Los\n\nAngeles, it was an interesting experience because we\n\ndon’t have a lot of churches like that in England. I hadn’t had a lot of firsthand experience of it.”\n\nMick Jagger: “It was quite an early one from Olympic Studios London, with Billy Preston. Once it was finished, we never played it on stage for years and years. Then it became this favorite after we recorded it for the Stripped album. So ‘Shine A Light’ was this funny thing that started off as something you did once at that time and never went back to.”\n\n(Can’t Seem To) Get a Line on You with Jagger and Russell in 1969.\n\nShine A Light\n\nSaw you stretched out in Room ten oh nine\n\nWith a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye\n\nWhoa, come see to get a line on you, my sweet honey love\n\nBerber jewelry jangling down the street\n\nMaking bloodshot eyes at every woman that you meet\n\nCould not seem to get high on you, my sweet honey love\n\nMay the good Lord shine a light on you\n\nMake every song (you sing) your favorite tune\n\nMay the good Lord shine a light on you\n\nWarm like the evening sun\n\nWhen you’re drunk in the elevator, with your clothes all torn\n\nWhen your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn\n\nJust seen too many flies on you, I just can’t brush them off\n\nAngels beating all their wings in time\n\nWith smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes\n\nWhoa, thought I heard one sigh for you\n\nCome on up, come on up, now, come on up now\n\nMay the good Lord shine a light on you, yeah\n\nMake every song you sing your favorite tune\n\nMay the good Lord shine a light on you, yeah\n\nWarm like the evening sun\n\nCome on up now, come on up now, come on up now, come on up, come on\n\nMay the good Lord shine a light on you\n\nMake every song you sing your favorite tune\n\nMay the good Lord shine a light on you\n\nWarm like the evening sun, yeah, yeah\n\nA soulful song by Billy Preston that was produced by his friend George Harrison. It was released in 1969 on Apple Records. This song had an ALL-STAR band backing it. George told Preston he would “invite some of his friends” over. Billy had no idea those friends were Eric Clapton on guitar, Keith Richards on bass, and Ginger Baker on drums. That alone makes the song worth listening to. Also, the backup vocals were done by Doris Troy and Madeline Bell.\n\nThis song peaked at #62 on the Billboard 100 Charts, #61 in Canada, and #11 in the UK in 1969.\n\nPreston was good friends with the Beatles…playing on the Let It Be album and the Get Back film. They signed him to Apple Records after getting him out of his contract with Capitol Records. He ended up with 5 top 5 hits including 2 number 1’s. He also toured with the Rolling Stones throughout the seventies.\n\nThe album was called That’s the Way God Planned It and it peaked also at #62 in the Billboard Album Charts. Critic David Fricke said: “Preston would have bigger hits in the Seventies but never make a better one than this album’s rapturous title track … The rest of the album is solid church-infused soul, with Preston covering both Bob Dylan and W.C. Handy.”\n\nIn 1979, after a few years without a hit, he would hit the charts again with Syreeta Wright on the ballad “With You I’m Born Again.” Preston suffered from kidney disease in his later years and would pass away on June 6, 2006.\n\nBilly Preston: “I first met [them] in Hamburg in 1962, I was backing Little Richard and they were just one of 14 other groups. They used to dedicate ‘Taste Of Honey’ and ‘Love Me Do’ to me and they were the only group I bothered to watch.”\n\nThat’s The Way God Planned It\n\nWhy can’t we be humble\n\nLike the good Lord said\n\nHe promised to exalt us\n\nFor love is the way\n\nHow men be so greedy\n\nWhen there’s so much left\n\nAll things are God given\n\nAnd they all have been blessed\n\nThat’s the way God planned it\n\nThat’s the way God wants it to be, didn’t He\n\nWell, that’s the way God planned it\n\nThat’s the way God wants it to be, for you and me\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nLet not your heart be troubled\n\nLet mourning sobbing cease\n\nLearn to help one another\n\nAnd live in perfect peace\n\nIf we just be humble\n\nLike the good Lord said\n\nHe promised to exalt us\n\nFor love is the way\n\nThat’s the way God planned it\n\nThat’s the way God wants it to be, doesn’t He\n\nYou better believe me\n\nThat’s the way God planned it\n\nThat’s the way God wants it to be, for you and me\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nThat’s the way, alright\n\nCome on, come on, come on\n\nI hope you get this message\n\nAnd where you won’t others will\n\nYou don’t understand me\n\nBut I’ll love you still\n\nThat’s the way God planned it\n\nThat’s the way God wants it to be\n\nYou better believe me\n\nThat’s the way God planned it\n\nThat’s the way God wants, He wants it to be\n\nThat’s the way God planned it\n\nThat’s the way God wants it to be\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nThat’s the way God planned it\n\nThat’s the way God wants it to be\n\nOh, yeah\n\n…\n\nI enjoyed this book immensely. It’s almost like a fantasy book. You are a fan and suddenly you get thrown into the world with The Beatles as friends and co-workers. You move from the Beatles to the Stones, CSNY, Bob Dylan and the list kept growing.\n\nI will say this… as a Beatle fan, this book gave me insight that I never had before. Chris O’Dell happened to meet Derek Taylor (press officer of the Beatles) in Los Angeles in 1968…she worked for him for a few weeks in LA as a PA. He told her she should come over to London to check out the new company that The Beatles were starting called Apple. He didn’t promise her a job but she took a chance and sold her records and borrowed from her parents to go to London. She was like Alice down the rabbit hole, O’Dell stumbled upon a life even she could not have dreamed of.\n\nShe took a chance and went over and that started her career working at The Beatles record company Apple. It took her a few months to get hired full time but after the Beatle’s inner circle knew she could be trusted she was there. She met Paul on her very first day. She said all of them were extremely nice and made her feel welcome. She spent the first few months showing up at the office and making herself useful and securing her place. She was especially close to George as a friend and later Ringo as a little more.\n\nAfter all was said and done…she had 3 songs written about her. Two by Leon Russell called Hummingbird, Pieces Apple Lady, and George Harrison’s Miss O’Dell. She was also the “Mystery Woman” on the Rolling Stones Exile on Main Street cover. She was in the Joni Mitchell song “Coyote” with the line He’s got another woman down the hall…the song about Sam Shepard who Chris O’Dell and Joni Mitchell were seeing. She ended up singing on the Hey Jude recording in the final Na Na chorus.\n\nShe was one of the first if not the first female tour manager in rock. The tours she worked on were The Rolling Stones, CSNY, Santana, Bob Dylan, Earth Wind and Fire, Jennifer Warnes, Fleetwood Mac, Linda Ronstadt, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Led Zeppelin, Phil Collins, Echo and the Bunnymen, ELO, and more.\n\nWe also get a glimpse into the personalities of Bob Dylan, Jagger and Richards, CSNY (and the disfunction), Eric Clapton, and more.\n\nLike all of us through life…she made some cringe-worthy decisions. I’m not trying to play it down but most of the time everything worked out in the end. She was in the right place at the right time and took advantage of that. She remains close friends with Pattie Harrison, Ringo Starr (her son’s Godfather), and many of her old famous acquaintances.\n\nThis is not a kiss-and-tell book and she doesn’t trash people which made me happy. The only person to come out of this book bad at all is Eric Clapton who was admittedly jealous of Pattie and Chris’s friendship. After the Stones tour, she got into drugs really bad but managed to quit them only to start up again. She, later on, became a drug counselor and helped people.\n\nThis book is for more than just Beatle fans…it gives you what life was like on the road in the 1970s. Some of the highlights in the book for me were:\n\nHow the Apple Office worked including the Hell’s Angels visitors\n\nHow even the biggest stars had deep insecurities\n\nBob Dylan forgot his harmonicas before the Isle of Wight concert and Chris O’Dell arrived by helicopter to give them to him.\n\nKeith Richards sending her to pick up a “package” in LA in the middle of a tour\n\nReading about David Crosby’s complaints of no “cross ventilation in his hotel room”\n\nWhen Roger Taylor of Queen realized that she was Miss O’Dell from George’s song.\n\nInsight into Pattie Boyd and Maureen Starkey who is hardly covered in Beatles books\n\nReading about how Bangledesh started and how George got his musician friends to participate.\n\nBeing on the roof during Get Back brief concert\n\nChris O’Dell: I think being a Beatle became very difficult for them. They had a different set of problems than the Stones and CSN&Y. They didn’t tour that much, they couldn’t go out of their hotel rooms, and they lived in a bubble. I think breaking up for them, and I can only guess, was a relief and very difficult at the same time.\n\nChris O’Dell: It was like being let go in Disneyland. That’s what it felt like. It’s like here are the keys to Disneyland, go and enjoy yourself. And I was constantly aware that I was watching history in the making and that was exciting. So every day had some, or certainly every week, had something, a twist to it that made it really exciting\n\nChris O’Dell now: I am happily remarried to a wonderful man who supports me and accepts me as I am. My twenty-three-year-old son is amazing and gives me some credibility as a parent! I have a private practice in Tucson, specializing in addiction and mental health counseling. My two dogs are happy and life is just better than I would have expected.\n\nExcerpt from the book: On being in a room with Mick and Keith before the 72 tour.\n\n“Listen to this fucking article in Rolling Stone about Harrison’s Bangladesh concert,” Keith said. He started reading from the article.\n\n“The Concert for Bangladesh is rock reaching for its manhood.” Keith raised an eyebrow. “Under the leadership of George Harrison, a group of rock musicians recognized, in a deliberate, self-conscious, and professional way, that they have responsibilities, and went about dealing with them seriously.”\n\nKeith looked at Mick and then at me. “Do you believe this shit? But wait, it gets better. Harrison is “a man with a sense of his own worth, his own role in the place of things… with a few parallels among his peers.”\n\n“Bollocks.” Keith laughed, tossing the magazine on the coffee table. “What a fucking load of shit.”\n\nI knew that Keith wasn’t really amused. He could be terribly insecure.\n\nWhat a paradox Keith was- a sweet sensitive soul who wrote songs about needing love to be happy and yet he lived his life as if he couldn’t give a shit about anything.\n\nBut at that moment I wasn’t too interested in Keith’s feelings. I sat at the far end of the sofa, my legs and arms crossed, smoking a cigarette and drinking my Scotch and Coke as if it were straight Coke. I was pissed. Sure, I knew they were just being competitive, but I couldn’t stand listening to them make fun of George. I wanted to jump into the conversation and tell them to leave him alone. But what could I do? I worked for the Stones now, not the Beatles. This is weird, I know, and particularly strange in the context of the Stone’s remarkable longevity, but at that moment I had a sinking feeling that I was beginning my climb down the ladder. I’d started at the very top with the Beatles and now I was on the rung below. I found myself thinking at that moment that the Stones were sometimes a little too raw, too raunchy, too negative. I liked their music, and I liked each of them individually, but if I had to choose, the Beatles would win.\n\n“You know,” I said, trying to smile but having a hard time of it,\n\n“George is my friend.”\n\nMick looked over at me as if he had forgotten I was there. “Oh yeah, Chris, you’re a Beatle person, aren’t you? Sorry about that”\n\nWe let it go, then, but after I dropped Mick at his house and headed home through the dark canyons, I felt a sudden, intense longing to see Pattie and George. Mick was right. When it came right down to it, I was a Beatle person.”\n\nMiss O’Dell\n\nI’m the only one down here\n\nWho’s got nothing to say\n\nAbout the war\n\nOr the rice\n\nThat keeps going astray on its way to Bombay.\n\nThat smog that keeps polluting up our shores\n\nIs boring me to tears.\n\nWhy don’t you call me, Miss O’Dell?\n\nI’m the only one down here\n\nWho’s got nothing to fear\n\nFrom the waves\n\nOr the rice\n\nThat keeps rolling on right up to my front porch.\n\nThe record player’s broken on the floor,\n\nAnd Ben, he can’t restore it.\n\nMiss O’Dell.\n\nI can tell you\n\nNothing new\n\nHas happened since I last saw you.\n\nI’m the only one down here\n\nWho’s got nothing to say\n\nAbout the hip\n\nOr the dope\n\nOr the cat with most hope to fill the Fillmore.\n\nThat pushing, shoving, ringing on my bell\n\nIs not for me tonight.\n\nWhy don’t you call me, Miss O’Dell?\n\nWhy don’t you call me, Miss O’Dell?\n\nBilly Preston played with and toured with a lot of artists. Mahalia Jackson, Ray Charles, Little Richard, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, and more. He had 17 songs in the Billboard 100, six top ten hits, and three number 1’s… One of the #1’s was with the Beatles with Get Back.\n\nThis song peaked at #1 in the Billboard 100 in 1974. Preston performed this song on the very first episode of Saturday Night Live. He and Janis Ian were the musical guests on the October 11, 1975 debut.\n\nFrom Songfacts\n\nPreston started writing this one night in the dressing room of an Atlanta nightclub where he was performing. He wanted to write a song based on the saying, “Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.”\n\n“The saloon piano gave it character,” Preston explained, “and I had a feeling it would be a hit because it was a sing-a-long kind of thing.”\n\nBruce Fisher, who was Preston’s songwriting partner (he co-wrote his previous American chart-topper, “Will It Go Round In Circles”), added a second verse.\n\nThe B-side of the single was another song Preston wrote with Fisher: “You Are So Beautiful,” which was later a hit for Joe Cocker.\n\nPreston started off at the age of 10 playing keyboards for gospel legend Mahalia Jackson.
