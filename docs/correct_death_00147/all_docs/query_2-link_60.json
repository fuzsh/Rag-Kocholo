        "text": "Billy Preston was an American keyboardist and singer-songwriter who had hits and won Grammy awards as a solo artist.\n\nBut he is best known as one of pop music's great session musicians - working with some of the biggest names in music history.\n\nHe was even unofficially the ‘Fifth Beatle’ playing on some of the band's greatest songs and appeared on half a dozen Rolling Stones albums in the 1970s.\n\nHis other claim to fame is that he wrote one of Joe Cocker's biggest hits ‘You are So Beautiful’.\n\nSimon Sweetman joined Jesse Mulligan to talk about Preston and share some of the legendary music he helped to create.\n\nPreston was a child prodigy, completely self-taught, who never had a music lesson in his life.\n\nBut by the age of 10 he’s playing with gospel great Mahalia Jackson, at 11 he is on TV with Nat King Cole and he even sang with his hero Ray Charles on a TV appearance when he was still a teenager.\n\nA meeting that would change his life happened when he was in Little Richard’s band, which he joined at 15, as an organist.\n\nRichard was playing shows with The Beatles, and Preston struck up a friendship with George Harrison, they were both a similar age.\n\n“They became the tightest of friends, it lasted the span of their lifetime,” Sweetman says.\n\nPreston released a string of albums showcasing his organ work in the 1960s and as well as touring and playing on numerous sessions - Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers and Ray Charles among the artists he worked with - and then he gets the call to help out The Beatles on the Let It Be sessions.\n\nHis soulful playing is a hit with the Beatles and John, George and Ringo wanted him to join the band permanently at one stage – Paul was less keen says Sweetman.\n\nPreston plays a prominent part on the two best solo albums by Beatles members, says Sweetman - John Lennon’s Plastic Ono Band and George Harrison’s All Things Must Pass.\n\nHe is also on many of Ringo's albums and became a member of the Ringo Starr All Star band for a while.\n\nDuring the 1970s Preston hits his stride as a solo artist and a gun session player, Sweetman says.\n\nHe plays on the psychedelic soul classic There's A Riot Goin On by Sly and the Family Stone and has a number of hits in his own right.\n\nDuring this time he also played on six Rolling Stones albums including Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main Street and Goats Head Soup and also toured with them at their 1970s peak.\n\nBut by the ‘80s the hits were drying up and drug, drink, legal and financial problems beset the latter part of his career, Sweetman says.\n\nPreston was a closeted gay man and he wrestled with his sexuality, Sweetman says.\n\n“The times were different, and he felt it wasn't acceptable, only coming out to a few people and very late in life.”\n\nPreston’s addictions eventually caught up with him and he died aged 59 in 2006, a few years after his best friend George Harrison.\n\nSongs played:\n\n‘Uptight (Everything's Alright)’ Billy Preston\n\nAlbum: The Wildest Organ In Town!\n\n‘Don't Let Me Down’ The Beatles\n\nAlbum: Let It Be - Naked\n\n‘God’ by John Lennon\n\nAlbum: Plastic Ono Band\n\n‘My Sweet Lord’ by Billy Preston\n\nAlbum: Encouraging Words\n\nHarrison gave 'My Sweet Lord' to Preston who recorded it first.\n\n‘Family Affair’ by Sly & The Family Stone\n\nAlbum: There's a Riot Goin' On\n\n‘I Wrote A Simple Song’ by Billy Preston\n\nAlbum: I Wrote A Simple Song\n\n‘Will It Go Round In Circles’ by Billy Preston\n\nAlbum: Music Is My Life\n\n‘You Are So Beautiful’ by Billy Preston\n\nAlbum: The Kids & Me\n\n‘Nothing From Nothing’ by Billy Preston\n\nAlbum: The Kids & Me"
