        "text": "? Billy Preston, the exuberant keyboardist who landed dream gigs with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and enjoyed his own series of hit singles including “Outta Space” and “Nothing From Nothing,” died Tuesday at 59.\n\nPreston’s longtime manager, Joyce Moore, said Preston had been in a coma since November in a care facility and was taken to a Scottsdale hospital Saturday after his condition deteriorated.\n\n“He had a very, very beautiful last few hours and a really beautiful passing,” Moore said by telephone from Germany.\n\nPreston had battled chronic kidney failure, and he received a kidney transplant in 2002. But the kidney failed and he has been on dialysis ever since, Moore said earlier this year.\n\nKnown for his big smile and towering Afro, Preston was a teen prodigy on the piano and organ, and lent his gospel-tinged touch to classics such as the Beatles’ “Get Back” and the Stones’ “Can’t You Hear Me Knocking?”\n\nHe broke out as a solo artist in the 1970s, winning a best instrumental Grammy in 1973 for “Outta Space,” and scoring other hits with “Will It Go ‘Round In Circles” and “Nothing From Nothing.” He also wrote Joe Cocker’s weeper “You Are So Beautiful.”\n\nOther career highlights included being a musical guest, in 1975, on the debut of “Saturday Night Live”; having a song named after him, by Miles Davis; and appearing last year on “American Idol.” Among his film credits: “Blues Brothers 2000” and “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.”\n\nHis partnership with the Beatles began in early 1969 when friend George Harrison recruited him to play on “Let It Be,” a back-to-basics film and record project that nearly broke down because of feuding among band members. Harrison himself quit at one point, walking out on camera after arguing with Paul McCartney.\n\nPreston not only inspired the Beatles to get along – Harrison likened his effect to a feuding family staying on its best behavior in front of a guest – but contributed a light, bluesy solo to “Get Back,” performing the song with the band on its legendary “roof top” concert, the last time the Beatles played live. He was one of many sometimes labeled “The Fifth Beatle,” a title he did not discourage.\n\nPreston remained close to Harrison and performed at Harrison’s all-star charity event “The Concert for Bangladesh” – for which Preston won another Grammy – and at the “Concert for George,” a tribute to Harrison, who died of cancer in 2001. He played on solo records by Harrison, Ringo Starr and John Lennon.\n\nPreston also toured and recorded extensively with the Rolling Stones, playing on such classic albums as “Sticky Fingers” and “Exile on Main Street.” In the mid-’70s, he parted from the Stones, reportedly unhappy over not getting proper credit for “Melody” and other songs, but reunited with the band in 1997 on its “Bridges to Babylon” record.\n\n“Billy was a fantastic and gifted musician … a superb singer in both recording sessions and on stage,” Stones singer Mick Jagger said. “He was great fun to be with onstage when touring with us and I will miss him a lot.”\n\nHis sessions credits included Aretha Franklin’s “Young, Gifted and Black,” Bob Dylan’s “Blood on the Tracks” and Sly and Family Stone’s “There’s a Riot Goin’ On,” three of the most acclaimed albums of the past 35 years.\n\n“His legacy is so huge I don’t even know where to start,” Moore said. “It’s many genres, so many years. … It’s rock ‘n’ roll, it’s soul, it’s funk, it’s everything. He was truly, truly, truly a genius.”"
