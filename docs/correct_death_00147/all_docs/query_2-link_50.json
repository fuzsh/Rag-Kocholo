        "text": "PHOENIX (AP) â€” Billy Preston, the exuberant keyboardist who landed dream gigs with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and enjoyed his own hit singles including \"Outta Space\" and \"Nothing From Nothing,\" died Tuesday at 59.\n\nHis longtime manager, Joyce Moore, said a heart infection in November left him in a coma, and he never regained consciousness; he was taken to a Scottsdale hospital Saturday after his condition deteriorated.\n\nPreston had battled chronic kidney failure and received a kidney transplant in 2002. But the kidney failed and he was on dialysis ever since.\n\nKnown for his big gap-toothed smile and towering Afro, Preston was a teen prodigy on the piano and organ, and lent his gospel-tinged touch to classics such as the Beatles' \"Get Back\" and the Stones' \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking?\"\n\nHe broke out as a solo artist in the 1970s, winning a best instrumental Grammy in 1973 for \"Outta Space,\" and scoring other hits with \"Will It Go 'Round In Circles,\" \"Nothing From Nothing\" and \"With You I'm Born Again,\" a duet with Syreeta Wright that became a favorite at weddings. He also wrote Joe Cocker's \"You Are So Beautiful.\""
