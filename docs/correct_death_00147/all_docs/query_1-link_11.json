        "text": "Family fights for access to musical legend\n\nBy Betty Pleasant\n\nFor the NNPA\n\nLOS ANGELES – South Los Angeles’ homegrown star, Billy Preston – the musical wunderkind of the popular and gospel genre and the universally acknowledged “Fifth Beatle” – is fighting for his life in an Arizona hospital and his sisters are fighting a white couple in Los Angeles Superior Court for conservatorship of Billy’s “person and estate.”\n\nThe matter of the conservatorship of William Everett Preston landed in court in January when his sister, Rodena Preston, petitioned for and was granted temporary conservatorship over her gravely ill, 59-year-old brother.\n\nIn her petition, Rodena told the court Billy was in a near coma and was unable to attend to his own business affairs. She said he had undergone a kidney transplant, which failed, and had also “undergone several serious surgical procedures in the last three months prior to this [January] filing.” She stated further that Billy “suffers from heart disease and is on and off a ventilator.”\n\nRodena also informed the court that Billy had moved temporarily to Scottsdale, Ariz., a year ago to be treated at the Mayo Clinic, but noted that “his condition worsened to its current state.” Rodena said she and another Preston sister, Gwendolyn Gooden, are Billy’s only blood relatives in California and that there are no family members in Arizona to care for him.\n\nRodena stated in her petition that she “is informed, believes and alleges that [Billy] is being unduly influenced by business associates who have assumed control over, or are attempting to assume control over, all of [his] assets.”\n\nBilly’s youngest sister, Lettie Preston, who lives in Houston, is more blunt. She said Joyce Moore, her brother’s business manager, whom he reportedly acquired within the past two years, is isolating him from his family and she has joined her two sisters in taking legal action to wrest control of him from Moore and her husband, Samuel Moore.\n\nThe day before a March 28 court appearance, Lettie said: “I’ve made three trips from Houston to Arizona just to be at my brother’s bedside, but I have been refused by the hospital’s administration, saying his business manager has given them a ‘medical power of attorney’ with a clause that prohibits family members from being at his bedside. This is ludicrous. My brother would never make a decision not to see his family at a critical time such as this.\n\n“My brother is critically ill,” Lettie continued. “There are reports that he is either brain-dead or severely brain damaged. We don’t know for certain, but we heard he had an episode in which his heart stopped and he was revived. I also know he cannot talk.\n\n“Billy has abused drugs since he was a teenager,” Lettie said. “He has made decisions in his life that were not in his best interest, because they were drug-driven. In these such times, the family has always gone to his aid to help him in those weak moments. I believe his manager has manipulated my brother, knowing he was a drug addict, extremely ill and depressed after the death of his mother [last year].”\n\nRodena Preston, a well-known pianist and choir director in her own right, was especially close to Billy, who is the youngest of the four Preston children. She and Billy had often participated in music and business projects together and, at one point during his career, she traveled with his band as a keyboardist and served as his road manager.\n\nRodena shares Lettie’s assessment of Joyce Moore’s role in Billy’s life, but added in her petition that Moore deceived his family about the state of Billy’s health to the extent that the sisters only gained a true picture of the severity of his condition when Gwendolyn and Lettie visited Billy’s Arizona hospital together and inadvertently learned that Moore was making funeral arrangements for him.\n\n“Even though she is supposed to be his business manager, none of his bills are being paid,” Rodena charged in her petition. “It is interesting to note, however, that my brother has two expensive cars (a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac Catera) that appear to have been placed in her name,” Rodena said.\n\nThe court granted Rodena temporary conservatorship and assigned Marc L. Sallus as Billy’s personal attorney on March 8. He ordered that Billy’s family and his attorney be allowed access to him and his medical records.\n\nThen Rodena filed for permanent conservatorship and the Moores filed a petition on March 24 objecting to Rodena getting permanent control over her brother. In their petition, the Moores objected to the permanent arrangement for three reasons which, when stripped of their legalese, boils down to 1. Billy is a resident of Arizona and is none of California’s business, 2. Billy filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 1, 2005, the bankruptcy court is in charge of his affairs and they are none of the Los Angeles Superior Court’s business, and 3. Billy does not want Rodena conserving him.\n\nThe Moores’ Beverly Hills attorney, Cara Blake, was not available for comment did not return message requesting comment.\n\nThings appear to have gone awry for the Moores at the March 28 court appearance as both Rodena and Sallus maintained that they still had been refused access to Billy’s person and medical records. Judge Michael Levanes affirmed his March 8 order awarding access, and then set an “order to show cause” on the Moores’ failure to comply. He ordered the couple to “personally present themselves” to the court for a hearing on April 12.\n\nBilly Preston is an extraordinary organist who began playing the piano while sitting on his mother’s lap at age 3. He has collaborated with some of the greatest names in the music industry, including the Beatles, Eric Clapton, Sammy Davis Jr., Sly Stone, Aretha Franklin, James Cleveland, George Harrison, the Jackson 5, Quincy Jones, the Rolling Stones and Michael McDonald. He is probably best known for his work with the Beatles and is the only artist to receive label credit on a Beatles single: “Get Back.”\n\nHe was reared in Los Angeles, went to Manual Arts High School, sang with Andrae Crouch’s extremely popular COGICS gospel group and played the organ on Sundays at the Rev. T.M. Chambers Jr.’s happening New Greater Harvest Baptist Church, where the late James Cleveland served as minister of music. Billy was somebody – in clubs, concerts, recording studios and in the church. “And all we want to do now is take care of him, like we always have,” Rodena said."
