        "text": "Album Review\n\nThe Rolling Stones: El Mocambo 1977\n\nby Doug Collette\n\nJune 4, 2022\n\nThe die-cut design of the double-CD cover for the Rolling Stones' El Mocambo 1977 mitigates at least to some degree the borderline amateurish cover art. But reversing the pink and blue covers of the twenty-page booklet inside the dual-fold package achieves a greater end than simply altering the simplistic cosmetics; its extraction also reveals a Paul Sexton essay with information more than a little pertinent to the music as well as photos of the Toronto appearance that might better have ...\n\nread more\n\nExtended Analysis\n\nLet It Be - Super Deluxe Special Edition\n\nby Doug Collette\n\nOctober 24, 2021\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable to state that the Beatles' Let It Be Super Deluxe Special Edition is the iconic group's third attempt to release music from their (three weeks of) January 1969 recordings.

None is more titanically funky, and lastingly influential, than Outa-Space,\" with its greasefire groove and afro-shaking new clavinet sound. Outa-Space\" is not to be confused with his similarly named No. 4 hit of a year later, Space Race.\" (Dick Clark would subsequently use this tune during the mid-show break for the remainder of American Bandstand's run into the late 1980s.) ...\n\nread more\n\nObituary\n\nSinger-Songwriter Billy Preston Dead at 59\n\nSource: All About Jazz\n\nJune 6, 2006\n\nBilly Preston, the exuberant keyboardist who landed dream gigs with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and enjoyed his own series of hit singles, including Outta Space\" and Nothing From Nothing,\" died Tuesday at 59. Preston's longtime manager, Joyce Moore, said Preston had been in a coma since November in a care facility and was taken to a hospital in Scottsdale Saturday after his condition deteriorated. He had a very, very beautiful last few hours and a really beautiful passing,\" ...\n\nread more"
