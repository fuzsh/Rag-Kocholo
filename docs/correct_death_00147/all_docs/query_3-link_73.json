        "text": "(CBS 11) - Billy Preston (born September 2, 1946 and died on June 6, 2006) was a successful American R&B singer/songwriter and keyboardist.\n\nHe was a successful session musician which, due to his association and collaboration with The Beatles, was often referred to as a \"Fifth Beatle\". He was a regular on ABC's \"Shindig\" which ran from 1964-1966. He also appeared in the 1978 movie, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" From 1972-1980, Preston charted six times, with four in the top five, and two #1 hits. His first #1 hit appeared in the summer of 1973.\n\n\"Will It Go Round In Circles\" was released in March 1973. It was on the charts for fourteen weeks and stayed at #1 for two consecutive weeks. Written by Preston and Bruce Fisher, produced by Preston, running 3:42 on the A&M Records label, the lyrics go like this:\n\nI got a song that ain't no melody, I'm gonna sing it to my friends\n\nI got a song that ain't no melody, I'm gonna sing it to my friends\n\nWill it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky\n\nWill it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky\n\nI got a story ain't no moral, I let the bad guy win every once in a while\n\nI got a story ain't no moral, I let the bad guy win every once in a while\n\nWill it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky\n\nWill it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky\n\nYou can hear this song both on over the air radio and SIRIUS XM 70's On 7 with Magic Matt Alan, Jaybeau Jones, and J.J. Walker, and when scheduled, an encore of American Top 40 With Casey Kasem."
