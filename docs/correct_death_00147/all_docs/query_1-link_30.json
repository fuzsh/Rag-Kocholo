        "text": "Billy Preston, the keyboard player known as the \"fifth Beatle\", died in Arizona last night. He was 59.\n\nPreston, pictured right in the 1970s, was born in Houston, Texas, in 1946 and raised in Los Angeles. He was recruited to record with the Beatles by George Harrison.\n\nHe performed on Get Back and Let It Be and also played with the Rolling Stones, Ray Charles and Neil Diamond. In the early 1970s, he topped the charts with a solo release Outa Space. An accomplished songwriter, he wrote Joe Cocker's 1974 hit You Are So Beautiful."
