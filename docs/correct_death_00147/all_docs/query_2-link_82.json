        "text": "Forty-seven years ago, on January 30th, 1969, the Beatles went to the top of Apple Corps headquarters and played their famous last concert together. Let It Be, the album and film were ultimately released in May 1970 as a prophetic and appropriate title for what would be their final appearance as The Beatles. They announced their break-up six months later.\n\nThe now (in)famous Roof Top Concert was a project designed to return to the band's musical origins in rock and roll and their roots as boyhood friends. The band-mates agreed to meet, write, and rehearse for twenty-one days, record an album, and perform a concert—an astonishing feat for any group, much less the world's most famous band.\n\nThe band's strife was well documented by this point, and the group was on the borderline of dysfunction. Whether the differences were musical, personal, or just that the band had grown apart, it was clear that the group was struggling. On day six of the project, George Harrison quietly rose from his chair, said the words, \"I'm done,\" and walked out of the room. Done with the project? Done with the band? Both? No one knew for sure.\n\nHarrison later stated, \"He got on the electric piano, and straight away there was 100 percent improvement in the vibe in the room. Having this fifth person was just enough to cut the ice we'd created among ourselves.\n\nAccording to an article in Rolling Stone Magazine, Harrison said, \"Billy didn't know all the politics and the games that had been going on, so in his innocence, he got stuck in and gave an extra little kick to the band. Everybody was happier to have somebody else playing, and it made what we were doing more enjoyable. We all played better, and it was a great session.\"\n\nPreston's musical contribution on Let It Be speaks for itself. Lennon even lobbied to make Preston a full member of the band — an actual fifth Beatle. \"It's bad enough with four!\" McCartney supposedly replied. Even so, the Beatles recognized Billy's importance on the single release of \"Get Back,\" which is credited to \"The Beatles with Billy Preston.\" This is the first and only time the Beatles credited anyone besides themselves on their records.\n\nThe album credit (and desire to add Preston to the band) showed that no matter how talented and successful the Beatles were, they needed something, or someone, new. Someone to bring them together, eliminate the tribalism, remind them of their manners, and provide a musical spark.\n\nWe all need some Billy Preston sometimes.\n\nTeaching music has always occurred in a vacuum. Few of us have co-directors to collaborate with, and while other curricula (band/choir/orchestra) and age levels (ES/MS/HS) are similar, they are not the same.\n\nWe need Billy.\n\nWe need someone to remind us to be on our best behavior. Someone who can challenge us and spark our musical and teaching skills. Someone who thinks and conducts in different ways than we do. Someone who can help us navigate the reopening and bring us back together.\n\nWho is your Billy Preston, and when was the last time you had a cup of coffee or had them in front of your group?\n\nI don't know about you, but lately, I have been in a bit of a funk. I have pandemic fatigue, and I know I'm not the only one. Except for a small window this past summer, I have been off the road and on an island for over two years.\n\nBetween the Two of Us, I've Got a Feeling, and I can't Let it Be. It's time to Get Back from this Long and Winding Road.\n\nWhere are you, Billy? I need you.\n\nHave a great week.\n\n-Scott\n\np.s. Save the date of March 8th. I will be holding a live – virtual Patron event and would love to see you there.\n\np.p.s.

Small world."
