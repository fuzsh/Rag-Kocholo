        "meta_description": "Billy had his share of challenges throughout his life; probably\nmore than enough to earn him the \"definitely not a Christian\" label\nfrom a lot of church-going folks, but it is plainly evident to\nanyone who really looks into the matter that Billy was indeed a\nBeliever in Christ and so much of his inspiration in music came\nfrom his strong faith in God. He said so himself on numerous\noccasions.\nYES, Billy was a Believer with a very strong faith in\nJesus...\nIf \"Christian\" means \"Christ-like\" then maybe not - though I\nknow plenty of self-proclaimed Christians who aren't very\n\"Christ-like\" either so what does the label really mean these days?\nIf real Christianity (the kind The Bible talks about) is a matter\nof God's grace saving undeserving sinners and the sinner confessing\nawareness of their own need for God, belief in the Gospel, and\nacceptance of God's grace regardless of their sin, then YES, Billy\nwas a Christian! He certainly didn't fit in the traditional\nChristian shiny church member mold, but he absolutely did express\nfaith in Christ and was not ashamed of it.\nBilly started out as a church boy. He was raised on Gospel\nmusic. But he also became a drug addict, racked up so much debt\nthat he deliberately burned his house down to try and get the\ninsurance money, and finally did time in prison for fraud. He also\nstruggled with homosexuality.\nBut Billy always fell back on his faith in God. As he put it\nhimself:\n\"Prison was a great lesson, an awakening. I needed to reflect,\nto get rid of some of the dead weight around me... You take the\nbitter with the sweet, and I have to say it was my faith that kept\nme going. I had nothing else to fall back on.\"\nAt another time Billy said, \"I do believe that God has his hands\non me and that he has work for me to do.\"\nBilly loved Gospel Music and loved to sing about God's grace and\nlove and how he wished we would all change our hearts by looking at\nthe example and teaching of Jesus. In 2001 he recorded a full\nGospel album entitled \"Music From My Heart\". He was fully aware of\nhis faults, but he still trusted in God.",
