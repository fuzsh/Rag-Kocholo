"The Fifth Beatle," Billy Preston, died of kidney failure today in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to Fox News. He was 59, and had been in a coma for the past eight months.

Preston was diagnosed in May 2001 with kidney failure due to high blood pressure and anemia. He was admitted to a Nashville hospital due to severe leg pain, and was originally diagnosed with phlebitis. He underwent outpatient dialysis treatments and had a kidney transplant in 2002.

The Houston native, who was a child prodigy on organ and piano, did session work with The Beatles on their Let It Be album. He appears in the famous rooftop scene of the group performing "Get Back." He is also on their "Abbey Road" album, George Harrison's "All Things Must Pass" album and was a keyboardist for George's Concert for Bangla Desh, John Lennon's "Plastic Ono Band" album and the single "Oh My My" on Ringo Starr's "Ringo" album. Ringo once said, "Billy is the incredible musician of life. You come to realize that if Billy is reading a book, eating a sandwich and playing, he still outplays us all. He's so good." Preston also toured and recorded with The Rolling Stones. His own single, Outa-Space, won a Grammy in 1972. His most notable songwriting hit is "You Are So Beautiful," sung by Joe Cocker.

Billy Preston was born on September 2nd, 1946. He was raised in Los Angeles, and was playing organ by 10. He toured with Little Richard when he was 15, and was a regular cast member on Shindig. With his signature afro and toothy grin, he acted in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, starring alongside the Bee-Gees and Peter Frampton, and in The Blues Brothers with Dan Aykroyd.

In 1997, Preston began a three-year jail sentence for a parole violation for carrying a deadly weapon and cocaine possession. After his stint in jail, he continued his musical career and toured with Eric Clapton in 2001.
