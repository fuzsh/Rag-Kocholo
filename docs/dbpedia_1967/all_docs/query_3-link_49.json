        "text": "Fine particles of calcium phosphate were obtained by mixing K2HPO4 and CaCl2 in 154mM NaCl in the presence of condensed phosphate. The effects of condensed phosphate on the particle formation of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), on the transformation of ACP to hydroxyapatite (HAP), and on the dispersibility of ripened HAP particles were studied by means of a Coulter counter, a calcium-ion specific electrode, X-ray powder diffraction analysis, and so on. The effective concentration of the condensed phosphate to retard the transformation of ACP to HAP was found to be between 10-4 and 10-3mM ; that to disperse the particles sufficiently was between 10-3 and 10-2 mM ; and that to disaggregate ripened HAP particles was between 3 and 102 mM. The order of effectiveness of the condensed phosphate was common irrespective of the measuring method : hexametaphosphate>triphosphate>diphosphate. Adsorption and/or competitive adsorption of condensed phosphate and orthophosphate, which is the lattice ion of calcium phosphate, was taken into account to explain the above results. The physiological significance of the present work is briefly discussed.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (767K)\n\nIn this study, the effect of cross-linking time on the adsorption characteristics of microcapsules containing activated charcoal (ACMC) was investigated. The microcapsules were prepared by the gelatin-acacia coacervation procedure. Activated charcoal powder was used as an adsorbent, and creatinine as a model adsorbate. The following results were obtained. The adsorption rate on ACMC could be controlled by changing the cross-linking time of the coacervate. A stable semipermeable membrane was formed by gelatin-acacia coacervation at cross-linking times greater than 60 min. Accordingly, the oral administration of ACMC should be available as a supporting technique in the treatment of patients with renal failure.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (983K)\n\nCombined oxidizing reagent systems of Fe (AN)6 (ClO4)3 (AN=acetonitrile) with halogen oxyacids were investigated. In particular, reactions of paraffin hydrocarbons with a combined reagent system of Fe (AN)3+6-IO-4 were explored because of the high reactivity of this system in the oxidation of adamantane (Table I). Oxidations of bornane, norbornane, cyclohexane, and n-hexane gave the corresponding acetamides and acetates (Table II). These results show that the title reagent system can efficiently oxidize organic substrates which have onset potentials of anodic current of ca. 2.7V vs. saturated calomel electrode.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (561K)\n\nTwo new alkaloids, aljesaconitine A and aljesaconitine B, and six known alkaloids, aconitine, jesaconitine, mesaconitine, neoline, hokbusine A, and delcosine, were isolated from the roots of Aconitum japonicum THUNB. (formerly known as Aconitum subcuneatum NAKAI). The structures of aljesaconitines A and B were determined on the basis of spectral data and derivation from jesaconitine. An acetoxy group at C-8 of an aconitine-type alkaloid was found to be easily changed to an alkoxy group by the use of alcohols such as methanol and ethanol in the extraction procedure. Quantitative determination and the LD50 values of these 8-O-alkyl derivatives are also described.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (595K)\n\nThe reactions of heterohomophthalic anhydrides, 3-carboxy-1-methylindole-2-acetic anhydride (4), 2-carboxybenzo [b] furan-3-acetic anhydride (5), 2-carboxythiophene-3-acetic anhydride (6), and 3-carboxy-1, 4-dimethylpyrrole-2-acetic anhydride (23) with carbon-carbon multiple bonds (C=C and C≡C), acylating agents, and cyclic imines are described. Treatment of the anhydrides (4-6) with various compounds containing carbon-carbon multiple bonds (7-10) in the presence of a strong base caused cycloaddition with spontaneous extrusion of carbon dioxide to give the corresponding linearly condensed peri-hydroxy heteroaromatic compounds (11-19), regioselectively. Base-catalyzed acylation of 4 with acetic anhydride and β, β-dimethylacryloyl chloride gave 3, 5-dimethylpyrano [4, 3-b] indol-1 (5H)-one (21) and 3, 3, 11-trimethyl-3, 4-dihydropyrano [4', 3' : 2, 3]-pyrano [4, 5-b] indole-1, 6 (11H)-dione (22), respectively. Reaction of the anhydrides (4, 6, and 23) with 3, 4-dihydroisoquinoline (24) gave the corresponding condensation products, 14-carboxy-13-methyl-5, 6, 14, 14a-tetrahydrobenz [a] indolo [3, 2-g] quinolizin-8 (13H)-one (25), 12-carboxy-5, 6, 12, -12a-tetrahydrobenzo [a] thieno [2, 3-g] quinolizin-8-one (26) and 12-carboxy-11-methyl-5, 6, 12, 12a-tetrahydrobenzo [a] pyrrolo [3, 2-g] quinolizin-8 (11H)-one (27), in high yields.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (814K)\n\nEpoxidation of cholesteryl acetate by a nonradical reagent system such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid, Mo (CO)6-'BuOOH, or Fe (ClO4)3-H2O2 was highly α-stereoselective. In contrast, a radical reagent system such as Fe (acac)3-'BuOOH, KO2-'BuBr, or biacetyl-O2-hv, showed high β-selectivity. The stereoselectivity in the epoxidation of cholesteryl acetate seems, therefore, to be a useful indication of the mode of reaction. On this basis, epoxidation may occur through a radical process in the tetraphenylporphinatoiron (III) chloride-iodosylbenzene system. Earlier studies with stilbene had failed to clarify the mechanism in this system.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (621K)\n\nTwo diastereomers (6 and 7) of the cyclic tautomer of cyclo-L-propyl-L-tryptophyl (5) have been prepared by dissolving 5 in 85% phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid. The stable isomer (6) was obtained in 89% yield on the acid treatment of 5 at room temperature. Cyclic tautomers (15 and 17) of the related 2, 5-piperazinediones (14 and 16) have also been prepared. Hydroxylation of the N-acetyl cyclic tautomers (8 and 9) with lead tetraacetate in trifluoroacetic acid followed by methylation gave the 8- and 9-methoxy derivatives (18, 19, 21, and 22) in moderate yields. The 9-methoxy derivative (22) was the major product of the oxidation of 9. On the other hand, oxidation of 5 in trifluoroacetic acid with lead tetraacetate followed by reduction with zinc gave the 8-hydroxy derivative (28) selectively in good yield via the cyclic tautomer (26) and the quinoneimine (27).\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (862K)\n\nTwo new vitamin D3 analogues, 1α-hydroxy-24, 24-dimethyl-22E-dehydrovitamin D3 (13) and 1α, 25-dihydroxy-24, 24-dimethyl-22E-dehydrovitamin D3 (17), which are blocked for 24-hydroxylation by the methyl groups, were synthesized from 1α, 3β-bismethoxymethoxypregn-5-ene-20Scarbaldehyde (6) by using the orthoester Claisen rearrangement for construction of the carbon skeleton of their side chains. These compounds (13 and 17) elicited a rise in serum calcium, but not in serum inorganic phosphorus in rats. In a bioassay for alkaline phosphatase, they were found to show much weaker activity than 1α-hydroxy vitamin D3 (5).\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (703K)\n\nThe (2S, 5R)-(+)- or (2R, 5S)-(-)-thiol (4a or 4b) was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of the corresponding (S)-(-)- or (R)-(+)-pyrrolinecarboxylic acid (8a or 8b) resolved with (R)-(-)-1, 2-diphenylethylamine, followed by acylation with 3-(benzoylthio) propionyl chloride and ammonolysis. The thiols were converted into the corresponding O, S-diacetates (16a and 16b), which were transformed into (2R, 5R)-(+)- and (2S, 5S)-(-)-thiols (18a and 18b) via their O, S-diacetates (17a and 17b) by epimerization and then ammonolysis. The stereochemistry of these thiols was elucidated on the basis of synthesis from tert-butoxycarbonyl-L-glutamic acid γ-benzylester (9) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) analysis. The thiols were tested for inhibitory activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme in vitro. (2S, 5R)-5-(2-Hydroxyphenyl)-1-(3-mercaptopropionyl)-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid (4a) showed the most potent activity among them.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (953K)\n\nIn an attempt to inhibit uptake sites for biogenic amines, the following \"rigid\" and \"flexible\" bifunctional analogues of amitriptyline of various topologies have been synthesized and evaluated as antidepressants : 5, 7-bis (3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-12, 13, 15, 16-tetrahydrobisbenzo-cyclohepta [7, 6-a ; 6', 7'-d] bezene (7), 5, 13-bis (3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-7, 8, 15, 16-tetrahy-drobisbenzocyclohepta [6, 7-a ; 6', 7'-d] benzene (8), 9, 18-bis (3-dimethylaminopropylidene)-4b, 4c, 13b, 13c-tetrahydrotetrabenzo [a, d, h, k] dicycloheptacyclobutene (9), and 1, 2-bis [3, 3'-(5-N, N-dimethylaminopropylidene [5H] dibenzo [a, d] cyclohepten)] ethane (12). All were active as measured by the uptake inhibition of 3H-serotonin into human blood platelets. Their structure-activity relationships revealed somewhat lower activity as compared with amitriptyline (1) but indicated the bifunctional amitriptylines can still interact with the uptake site. The synthesis and molecular structures including stereochemistry of the chiral pentacyclic aminoalcohol precursors (R, R and S, S)-4 and (R, S)-5 are reported. Strong intramolecular O-H···N bonding in 4 and 5 are noted.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (983K)\n\nAn examination of structural similarities between gastrins (3-5) and antigastric 5, 1-benzothiazocines (2) suggested the presence of common functional groups and atoms, i. e., a benzene ring, a nonbasic nitrogen and a sulfur atom. A working hypothesis presuming these to be essential binding moieties is presented. A molecular mechanics calculation study of Ac-Trp-Met-NHMe (14) as.a model peptide bearing the receptor binding sites was carried out in an attempt to find a stereochemical correlation with a representative 5, 1-benzothiazocine, RS-2039 (1), a derivative of which had been structurally elucidated by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Several stable conformers of Ac-Trp-Met-NHMe were discovered to have a close approximation of the 3-dimensional array of binding sites to that of 1. It has thus been theoretically demonstrated that gastrins and 5, 1-benzothiazocines could bind with an identical receptor.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (673K)\n\nDes-Tyr1-dermorphin, des-Tyr1-[D-Arg2] dermorphin, and the N-terminal di-, tri-, tetra- and hexapeptide amides of [D-Arg2] dermorphin were synthesized by a conventional solution method and their analgesic activities were assayed by means of the tail pressure test after subcutaneous administration (s. c.) to mice. The des-Tyr1 analogs of both dermorphin and [D-Arg2] dermorphin did not show analgesic activity even at a dose of up to 50 mg/kg, s. c. The N-terminal tetrapeptide amide, H-Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Gly-NH2, showed extremely potent activity, being 31 times more active than morphine on a molar basis, whereas the N-terminal tri- and dipeptide amides showed no activity even at a dose of up to 40 mg/kg, s. c.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (679K)\n\nHistochemical studies were performed on the distribution of bioactive flavones, baicalein, baincalin, wogonin and wogonin 7-O-glucuronide, in various parts and tissues of Scutellariae Radix and cultivated Scutellaria baicalensis (Labiatae) root. By means of high-performance liquid chromatography, it has been clarified that the flavone glucuronides are mainly distributed in the cortex, phloem and xylem of the root, and the aglycones are present in the outer periderm at high concentrations. It has been found that Scutellariae Radix from China is morphologically different from the drugs from Japan, Korea and North Korea.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (636K)\n\nThe role of the solvent in the partition of procaine (PC) and its hydrolysis product, p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), into various organic solvents was investigated from the viewpoints of the solvent polarity, the proton-donating and/or -accepting properties, and the solvation of the solute. The partition coefficients of PC and PABA in a pentanol (PeOH)-cyclohexane (CyH) mixture/water system gradually increased with increase of the mixing ratio of PeOH, but the change with the mixing ratio was not linearly correlated with the change of solvent polarity. The electrophilicity and/or nucleophilicity of the solvents did not greatly influence the partition of PC, whereas the partition of PABA varied with different solvent systems as follows ; nucleophilic solvents> amphiprotic solvents»electrophilic solvents»inert solvent. Furthermore, although it was ascertained that an appropriate solvating agent is required for the partition of a polar solute, the specificity was not always high due to the amphiprotic properties of PC and PABA. The solvation number and the extraction constant were obtained for PeOH, ethyl acetate, and chloroform as solvating agents for PC and PABA, and the nature of the solute-solvent interaction is discussed.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (687K)\n\nThe reactions of sulbactam (I) with pyrazole, 1, 2, 4-triazole and imidazole in weakly alkaline solutions yielded 1-(5-carboxy-6-methyl-6-sulfino-4-aza-2-heptenoyl)-pyrazole (III), -1, 2, 4-triazole (IV), and -imidazole (V), respectively. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) behavior indicate that III, IV and V each exist as a mixture of E- and Z-isomers in a ratio of about 2 : 1 in aqueous solutions at low temperature, and that rapid interconversion between the E- and Z-isomers occurs at high temperature. Compounds III, IV and V were converted to methyl 5-carboxy-6-methyl-6-sulfino-4-aza-2-heptenoate (II) in methanol.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (511K)\n\nA sensitive fluorometric method for the determination of primary aromatic amines was developed. The procedure requires diazotization of the amino group followed by coupling with 2, 4, 6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP), and the resulting azo compound is oxidized to a fluorescent triazole. Substituted triazoles were synthesized by using various pyrimidines and their fluorescence characteristics were evaluated. TAP was selected as the most sensitive reagent. None of the pyrimidines substituted at the 2-position was fluorescent. A method for the determination of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was established (quantitation limit : 40 ng/ml). This method is more practical and simple than that reported before : the final solution for measurement was obtained in one flask through a one-pot reaction. The effects of substituents of the triazole ring on the fluorescence are discussed.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (698K)\n\nPd (II) chelates of 1, 1-dimethyl-3-(4-methyl-2-thiazolyl) thiourea and related N-(2-thiazolyl)-thioureas were prepared and their molecular structures were determined by means of spectroscopic, thermochemical, and X-ray crystallographic measurements, in order to establish the identity of the colored substances in the spectrophotometric determination of Pd (II) with the thiazolyl-thioureas. The results indicated that Pd (II) formed 1 : 2 chelates with the thiazolylthioureas and that the ligands were bidentate and coordinated through the thiourea sulfur and thiazole nitrogen atoms. The geometry of Pd (II) coordination was roughly square-planar and the configuration of the two thiazolylthiourea molecules was cis.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (695K)\n\nHuman plasma vitamin D binding proteins (DBP, also denoted as group-specific components ; Gc) were highly purified from commercial human α-globulin (also denoted as Cohn Fraction IV ; HαG). Chromatofocusing separated the partially purified HαG into three DBPs which had the same molecular size in gel permeation high-performance liquid chromatography. They each exhibited binding affinity with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25 (OH) D3] and cross-immunoreactivity against antihuman plasma group-specific components (Gc) antiserum. However, the three DBPs were completely different in charge on chromatofocusing, and gave distinct peaks having apparent isoelectric points of 4.64, 4.59 and 4.54. It is well known that the Gc has three phenotypes separable only by isoelectric focusing. The relationship between the three purified DBPs and the three phenotypes of Gc has not been clarified. However, we suggest that the chromatofocusing method may provide a convenient procedure for the purification of DBP from human plasma and commercial HαG.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (728K)\n\nThe structure-function relationship of the antitumor 6-branched β-1, 3-glucan (grifolan NMF-5N) extracted from the matted mycelium of Grifola frondosa was examined by using various chemical modification procedures (periodate oxidation, Smith degradation, and enzymic hydrolysis). The antitumor activity of grifolan NMF-5N was not lowered by periodate oxidation. Partial removal of branches by mild hydrolysis did not affect the activity. However, the linear β-1, 3-glucan obtained by Smith degradation lacked antitumor activity. From the results of enzymic hydrolysis of grifolan NMF-5N, this glucan contains a β-1, 3-glucanase-resistant core structure. The core structure is present randomly in this glucan, and does not itself show antitumor activity. These results suggest that some of the branches at C-6 in grifolan NMF-5N are important for the antitumor activity, and that the activity requires a relatively high molecular weight.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (660K)\n\nAmine oxidase (AO) activity was assayed in 51 species of plants. Among these plants, high AO activity was observed in Lyophyllum aggregatum KUHNEN (\"Hon-shimeji\") ; some of its properties were investigated. It was found that 96% of the AO activity was localized in the soluble fraction (100000×g sup.). When β-phenylethylamine (PEA) was used as a substrate, the AO activities in mitochondrial (15000×g ppt.) and microsomal fractions (100000×g ppt.) had similar kinetic constants, but that in the soluble fraction was different. Based on inhibition studies, AO in Honshimeji could be classified into two forms. One is a metallo enzyme (containing cupric copper and pyridoxal phosphate) which is inhibited by semicarbazide and cuprizone, and the other is a flavin enzyme which is inhibited by clorgyline.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (635K)\n\nCarboxypeptidase CN from Citrus natsudaidai HAYATA is an acidic protease (M, 93000). The enzyme was inactivated by the incorporation of 1.0 mol of 32P-labeled diisopropylphosphofluoridate, 1.3 mol of 203HgCl2, or 2.2 mol of 110mAgNO3 per mol of enzyme at pH 5.5. Four or five radioactive peptides were isolated from a partial acid hydrolysate of the 32P-labeled enzyme. These peptides provided evidence indicating the amino acid sequence Glx-Gly-Asx-Ser-Gly-Gly-Glu-Leu-Val around the reactive serine residue. The enzyme reacted with 0.4 mol of 203Hg-labeled p-chloromercuribenzoate without appreciable loss of enzymatic activity. On the other hand, 1 mol of 203Hg-labeled p-chloromercuribenzoate was incorporated into the enzyme which had been denatured with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 8 M urea at pH 7.0 in the absence of dithiothreitol. Thus, the enzyme has one sulfhydryl group which possesses only poor reactivity. Photooxidation using methylene blue as a sensitizer caused a loss of enzymatic activity and specific destruction of approximately 1 mol of histidine residue per mol of enzyme. The photooxidized, p-bromophenacyl bromide-treated and HgCl2-treated enzyme failed to react with 32P-labeled diisopropylphosphofluoridate. From these findings, we inferred that one serine, one histidine, and the carboxyl groups are essential for catalytic activity.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (1033K)\n\nThe hepatic transport of amaranth (AM) was investigated in normal rats and rats with hepatic intoxication induced by subcutaneous or oral administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4s. c. or CCl4p. o.) or by oral administration of α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT). The kinetics of the disappearance of AM from plasma as well as the kinetics of its appearance in the bile were studied in rats under pentobarbital anesthesia and the binding activities of plasma and hepatic cytoplasmic proteins to AM were also investigated. A retarded plasma disappearance of AM was observed in CCl4-or ANIT-intoxicated rats and biliary excretion of AM was decreased in CCl4-intoxicated rats. Bile flow and biliary excretion of AM were not observed in ANIT-intoxicated rats. The total amount of AM bound to the plasma protein was decreased in ANIT-intoxicated rats, but was not affected in CCl4-intoxicated groups. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with a three-compartment model, and a decrease in k12 (transfer rate constant from plasma to liver) and k23 (transfer rate constant from liver to bile) were observed in CCl4p. o.-intoxicated rats. In CCl4s. c.-intoxicated rats, only k12 was decreased. In ANIT-intoxicated rats, significant decreases in k12 and increases in k24 (rate constant of metabolism) were observed. AM was bound preferentially to X-and Y-fraction rather than to Z-fraction in cytoplasmic proteins. Although the protein concentration in the 110000g supernatant and in the Y-fraction was decreased in CCl4p. o.-intoxicated rats, the total protein content of whole liver was not affected. It was considered that changes in the hepatic plasma flow may be a main cause of the retarded disappearance of AM from plasma in the intoxicated rats.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (852K)\n\nThe relationship between the bioavailability of various phenytoin (DPH) suspensions and the physicochemical properties of the vehicle as well as the physiological factors influencing the bioavailabllity were studied in rats. The vehicles used were aqueous solutions of methylcellulose (0.1, 0.5 and 1%), 1% polysorbate 80 aqueous solution, sesame oil and sesame oil emulsion. The gastric emptying time was determined from the amount of phenol red remaining in the stomach after oral administration. As the gastric emptying time increased, the area under the blood concentration-time curve, the maximum blood concentration and the time required to reach the maximum blood concentration increased. The gastric emptying time became smaller as the fluidity of the vehicle increased. Clearly, the viscosity is an important factor affecting the bioavailability of DPH. As the gastric emptying and the dissolution rate slowed down, the apparent absorption rate constant (ka) became small. However, ka obtained from an oily suspension was only one-third of the value obtained from an aqueous suspension. Thus, the mechanism by which DPH is absorbed from the digestive tract after administration as an oily suspension appears to be considerably different from that after administration as an oily suspension appears to be considerably different from that after administration as an aqueous suspension. The value of ka obtained from the in vivo absorption study was about half of that found in situ. These results suggest that ka obtained from the in vivo absorption study includes the transit rate of suspension from the stomach to the intestinal tract.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (805K)\n\nThe bioavailabilities of phenytoin (DPH) from oil suspensions (sesame oil and oleic acid) were studied in rats in relation to the physicochemical properties and gastric emptying time of the vehicles. The maximum blood concentration (Cmax) of DPH after oral administration of sesame oil suspension was about twice that from the oleic acid suspension. DPH in oleic acid suspension was absorbed more slowly ; this was consistent with the dissolution rate data. Oleic acid delayed gastric emptying to a significant degree in comparison with sesame oil. The area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) for the oleic acid suspension was significantly higher than that for the sesame oil suspension. On the other hand, AUC and blood concentrations of DPH after intraduodenal administration of oleic acid suspension were approximately twice those obtained with the sesame oil suspension up to one hour after administration. It was concluded that the lower Cmax of DPH, the higher AUC and the longer Tmax (the time required to reach the maximum blood concentration) after oral administration of oleic acid suspension as compared with those in the case of sesame oil suspension could be attributed to the delayed gastric emptying.\n\nView full abstract\n\nDownload PDF (654K)"
