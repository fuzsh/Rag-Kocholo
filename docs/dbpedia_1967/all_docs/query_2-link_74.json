        "text": "The Clp1 family proteins, consisting of the Clp1 and Nol9/Grc3 groups, have polynucleotide kinase (PNK) activity at the 5′ end of RNA strands and are important enzymes in the processing of some precursor RNAs. However, it remains unclear how this enzyme family diversified in the eukaryotes. We performed a large-scale molecular evolutionary analysis of the full-length genomes of 358 eukaryotic species to classify the diverse Clp1 family proteins. The average number of Clp1 family proteins in eukaryotes was 2.3 ± 1.0, and most representative species had both Clp1 and Nol9/Grc3 proteins, suggesting that the Clp1 and Nol9/Grc3 groups were already formed in the eukaryotic ancestor by gene duplication. We also detected an average of 4.1 ± 0.4 Clp1 family proteins in members of the protist phylum Euglenozoa. For example, in Trypanosoma brucei, there are three genes of the Clp1 group and one gene of the Nol9/Grc3 group. In the Clp1 group proteins encoded by these three genes, the C-terminal domains have been replaced by unique characteristics domains, so we designated these proteins Tb-Clp1-t1, Tb-Clp1-t2, and Tb-Clp1-t3. Experimental validation showed that only Tb-Clp1-t2 has PNK activity against RNA strands. As in this example, N-terminal and C-terminal domain replacement also contributed to the diversification of the Clp1 family proteins in other eukaryotic species. Our analysis also revealed that the Clp1 family proteins in humans and plants diversified through isoforms created by alternative splicing.\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is one of the primary factors promoting angiogenesis in endothelial cells. Although defects in VEGF-A signaling are linked to diverse pathophysiological conditions, the early phosphorylation-dependent signaling events pertinent to VEGF-A signaling remain poorly defined. Hence, a temporal quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis was performed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with VEGF-A-165 for 1, 5 and 10 min. This led to the identification and quantification of 1971 unique phosphopeptides corresponding to 961 phosphoproteins and 2771 phosphorylation sites in total. Specifically, 69, 153, and 133 phosphopeptides corresponding to 62, 125, and 110 phosphoproteins respectively, were temporally phosphorylated at 1, 5, and 10 min upon addition of VEGF-A. These phosphopeptides included 14 kinases, among others. This study also captured the phosphosignaling events directed through RAC, FAK, PI3K-AKT-MTOR, ERK, and P38 MAPK modules with reference to our previously assembled VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling pathway map in HUVECs. Apart from a significant enrichment of biological processes such as cytoskeleton organization and actin filament binding, our results also suggest a role of AAK1-AP2M1 in the regulation of VEGFR endocytosis. Taken together, the temporal quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis of VEGF signaling in HUVECs revealed early signaling events and we believe that this analysis will serve as a starting point for the analysis of differential signaling across VEGF members toward the full elucidation of their role in the angiogenesis processes.

To help fully exploit such data and facilitate their interpretation, metabolomic data obtained from different facilities and different samples should be integrated and compared. However, large-scale integration of such data for biological discovery is challenging given that they are obtained from various types of sample at different facilities and by different measurement techniques, and the target metabolites and sensitivities to detect them also differ from study to study. Results: We developed iDMET, a network-based approach to integrate metabolomic data from different studies based on the differential metabolomic profiles between two groups, instead of the metabolite profiles themselves. As an application, we collected cancer metabolomic data from 27 previously published studies and integrated them using iDMET. A pair of metabolomic changes observed in the same disease from two studies were successfully connected in the network, and a new association between two drugs that may have similar effects on the metabolic reactions was discovered. Conclusions: We believe that iDMET is an efficient tool for integrating heterogeneous metabolomic data and discovering novel relationships between biological phenomena.\n\nThe regulatory function of many bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) requires the binding of the RNA chaperone Hfq to the 39 portion of the sRNA intrinsic terminator, and therefore sRNA signaling might be regulated by modulating its terminator. Here, using a multicopy screen developed with the terminator of sRNA SgrS, we identified an sRNA gene (cyaR) and three protein-coding genes (cspD, ygjH, and rof) that attenuate SgrS termination in Escherichia coli. Analyses of CyaR and YgjH, a putative tRNA binding protein, suggested that the CyaR activity was indirect and the effect of YgjH was moderate. Overproduction of the protein attenuators CspD and Rof resulted in more frequent readthrough at terminators of SgrS and two other sRNAs, and regulation by SgrS of target mRNAs was reduced. The effect of Rof, a known inhibitor of Rho, was mimicked by bicyclomycin or by a rho mutant, suggesting an unexpected role for Rho in sRNA termination. CspD, a member of the cold shock protein family, bound both terminated and readthrough transcripts, stabilizing them and attenuating termination. By RNA sequencing analysis of the CspD overexpression strain, we found global effects of CspD on gene expression across some termination sites. We further demonstrated effects of endogenous CspD under slow growth conditions where cspD is highly expressed. These findings provided evidence of changes in the efficiency of intrinsic termination, confirming this as an additional layer of the regulation of sRNA signaling. IMPORTANCE Growing evidence suggests that the modulation of intrinsic termination and readthrough of transcription is more widespread than previously appreciated. For small RNAs, proper termination plays a critical role in their regulatory function. Here, we present a multicopy screen approach to identify factors that attenuate small RNA termination and therefore abrogate signaling dependent on the small RNA. This study highlights a new aspect of regulation of small RNA signaling as well as the modulation of intrinsic termination.\n\nBackground: Tardigrades are microscopic animals that are capable of tolerating extreme environments by entering a desiccated state of suspended animation known as anhydrobiosis. While antioxidative stress proteins, antiapoptotic pathways and tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins have been implicated in the anhydrobiotic machinery, conservation of these mechanisms is not universal within the phylum Tardigrada, suggesting the existence of overlooked components. Results: Here, we show that a novel Mn-dependent peroxidase is an important factor in tardigrade anhydrobiosis. Through time-series transcriptome analysis of Ramazzottius varieornatus specimens exposed to ultraviolet light and comparison with anhydrobiosis entry, we first identified several novel gene families without similarity to existing sequences that are induced rapidly after stress exposure. Among these, a single gene family with multiple orthologs that is highly conserved within the phylum Tardigrada and enhances oxidative stress tolerance when expressed in human cells was identified. Crystallographic study of this protein suggested Zn or Mn binding at the active site, and we further confirmed that this protein has Mn-dependent peroxidase activity in vitro. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated novel mechanisms for coping with oxidative stress that may be a fundamental mechanism of anhydrobiosis in tardigrades. Furthermore, localization of these sets of proteins mainly in the Golgi apparatus suggests an indispensable role of the Golgi stress response in desiccation tolerance.\n\nAs the worldwide prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) increases, it is vital to reduce its morbidity and mortality through early detection. Saliva-based tests are an ideal noninvasive tool for CRC detection. Here, we explored and validated salivary biomarkers to distinguish patients with CRC from those with adenoma (AD) and healthy controls (HC). Saliva samples were collected from patients with CRC, AD, and HC. Untargeted salivary hydrophilic metabolite profiling was conducted using capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. An alternative decision tree (ADTree)-based machine learning (ML) method was used to assess the discrimination abilities of the quantified metabolites. A total of 2602 unstimulated saliva samples were collected from subjects with CRC (n = 235), AD (n = 50), and HC (n = 2317). Data were randomly divided into training (n = 1301) and validation datasets (n = 1301). The clustering analysis showed a clear consistency of aberrant metabolites between the two groups. The ADTree model was optimized through cross-validation (CV) using the training dataset, and the developed model was validated using the validation dataset. The model discriminating CRC + AD from HC showed area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0.860 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.828-0.891) for CV and 0.870 (95% CI: 0.837-0.903) for the validation dataset. The other model discriminating CRC from AD + HC showed an AUC of 0.879 (95% CI: 0.851-0.907) and 0.870 (95% CI: 0.838-0.902), respectively. Salivary metabolomics combined with ML demonstrated high accuracy and versatility in detecting CRC.\n\nThe candidate phyla radiation (CPR) is a large bacterial group consisting mainly of uncultured lineages. They have small cells and small genomes, and they often lack ribosomal proteins uL1, bL9, and/or uL30, which are basically ubiquitous in non-CPR bacteria. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the genomic information on CPR bacteria and identified their unique properties. The distribution of protein lengths in CPR bacteria peaks at around 100–150 amino acids, whereas the position of the peak varies in the range of 100–300 amino acids in free-living non-CPR bacteria, and at around 100–200 amino acids in most symbiotic non-CPR bacteria. These results show that the proteins of CPR bacteria are smaller, on average, than those of free-living non-CPR bacteria, like those of symbiotic non-CPR bacteria. We found that ribosomal proteins bL28, uL29, bL32, and bL33 have been lost in CPR bacteria in a taxonomic lineage-specific manner. Moreover, the sequences of approximately half of all ribosomal proteins of CPR differ, in part, from those of non-CPR bacteria, with missing regions or specifically added regions. We also found that several regions in the 16S, 23S, and 5S rRNAs of CPR bacteria are lacking, which presumably caused the total predicted lengths of the three rRNAs of CPR bacteria to be smaller than those of non-CPR bacteria. The regions missing in the CPR ribosomal proteins and rRNAs are located near the surface of the ribosome, and some are close to one another. These observations suggest that ribosomes are smaller in CPR bacteria than those in free-living non-CPR bacteria, with simplified surface structures.\n\nWhile most ant species establish a colony independently, some socially parasitic ants build the foundation of their colony by invading other ant (host) colonies and utilizing their labor forces. Many socially parasitic ants disguise their cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile, which is also known as signature mixture for nestmate discrimination, when invading the host colony. Since the strategy of chemical disguise is widespread in socially parasitic ants, elucidating the mechanism of chemical disguise will promote knowledge on the evolutionary history of social parasitism. However, detailed knowledge is still lacking, as the relevant information has only originated from circumstantial evidence, which was obtained from ecological observations. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of chemical disguise in a new queen of a temporary socially parasitic spiny ant (Polyrhachis lamellidens) by measuring its CHC profile, performing a tracing assay with labeled substances, and analyzing gene expression levels. First, after rubbing behavior was observed against the host workers, the CHC profile in P. lamellidens shifted to pronounced peaks that closely resembling that of the host workers. We also observed a reduction in aggressive behaviors by the host ant against P. lamellidens after rubbing behavior was performed. In addition, P. lamellidens acquired artificially-applied labeling substances from host workers through their rubbing behaviors, while gene expression profiling showed the expression of CHC synthesis-related genes did not change during this behavior. These results suggest that P. lamellidens directly obtains host CHCs through rubbing behavior, and these host CHCs enables P. lamellidens to remain disguised during colony invasion.\n\nMany previous studies have reported the various proteins specifically secreted as inducers in the dorsal or ventral regions in vertebrate gastrula. However, little is known about the effect on cell fate of small molecules below 1000 Da. We therefore tried to identify small molecules specifically expressed in the dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) or ventral marginal zone (VMZ) in vertebrate gastrula. Small intracellular and secreted molecules were detected using explants and supernatant samples. Hydrophilic metabolites were analyzed by capillary ion chromatography–mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, and lipids were analyzed by supercritical fluid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 190 hydrophilic metabolites and 396 lipids were identified. The DMZ was found to have high amounts of glycolysis-and glutathione metabolismrelated metabolites in explants, and the VMZ was richer in purine metabolism-related metabolites. We also discovered some hydrophilic metabolites and lipids differentially contained in the DMZ or VMZ. Our research would contribute to a deeper understanding of the cellular physiology that regulates early embryogenesis.\n\nNon-biting midges (Chironomidae) are known to inhabit a wide range of environments, and certain species can tolerate extreme conditions, where the rest of insects cannot survive. In particular, the sleeping chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki is known for the remarkable ability of its larvae to withstand almost complete desiccation by entering a state called anhydrobiosis. Chromosome numbers in chironomids are higher than in other dipterans and this extra genomic resource might facilitate rapid adaptation to novel environments. We used improved sequencing strategies to assemble a chromosome-level genome sequence for P. vanderplanki for deep comparative analysis of genomic location of genes associated with desiccation tolerance. Using whole genome-based cross-species and intra-species analysis, we provide evidence for the unique functional specialization of Chromosome 4 through extensive acquisition of novel genes. In contrast to other insect genomes, in the sleeping chironomid a uniquely high degree of subfunctionalization in paralogous anhydrobiosis genes occurs in this chromosome, as well as pseudogenization in a highly duplicated gene family. Our findings suggest that the Chromosome 4 in Polypedilum is a site of high genetic turnover, allowing it to act as a 'sandbox' for evolutionary experiments, thus facilitating the rapid adaptation of midges to harsh environments.\n\nMetastasis is responsible for approximately 90% of cancer-associated mortality and proceeds through multiple steps. Several herbal medicines are reported to inhibit primary tumor growth, but the suppressor effects of the medicines on metastasis progression are still not fully elucidated. Here we report that cinnamon bark extract (CBE) has a suppressor effect on metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. Through a phenotypic screening using zebrafish embryos, CBE was identified to interfere with the gastrulation progression of zebrafish embryos, of which the molecular mechanisms are conserved in metastasis progression. A Boyden chamber assay showed that CBE decreased cell motility and invasion of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells without affecting their cell viability. Furthermore, CBE suppressed metastatic dissemination of the cells in a zebrafish xenotransplantation model. Quantitative metabolome analyses revealed that the productions of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose 6-phosphate which are intermediate metabolites of glycolytic metabolism were interrupted in CBE-treated cells. qPCR and western-blotting analyses revealed that CBE-treated cells showed decreased expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2) which yields G6P. Pharmacological inhibition of HK2 with 2-deoxy-D-glucose suppressed cell invasion and migration of the cells without affecting their cell viability. Taken together, CBE suppresses metastatic dissemination of cancer cells through inhibition of glycolysis metabolism.\n\nPolyrhachis lamellidens is a temporary social parasitic species. When a newly mated queen encounters a host worker, it opens its jaws and then mounts and rubs the body of the host worker, called rubbing behaviour. This behaviour is different from aggressive behaviour and is considered to be a preparatory action before invasion of the host colony. However, it is unclear what cues trigger rubbing behaviour. Therefore, in this study, we used glass beads that imitated the insect body surfaces and searched for triggers. Although P. lamellidens did not respond to the cuticular compounds only, cuticular compounds and chitin coatings on glass beads elicited responses that were similar to those towards live samples. The rubbing behaviour of P. lamellidens was elicited in response to a cuticle-like surface that mimicked a procuticle by combining the compounds with chitin. These results suggest that host recognition and nest-mate recognition are supported by different mechanisms.\n\nOssification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), a disease characterized by the ectopic ossification of a spinal ligament, promotes neurological disorders associated with spinal canal stenosis. While blocking ectopic ossification is mandatory to prevent OPLL development and progression, the mechanisms underlying the condition remain unknown. Here we show that expression of hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (Hao1), a gene identified in a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) as an OPLL-associated candidate gene, specifically and significantly decreased in fibroblasts during osteoblast differentiation. We then newly established Hao1-deficient mice by generating Hao1-flox mice and crossing them with CAG-Cre mice to yield global Hao1-knockout (CAG-Cre/Hao1flox/flox; Hao1 KO) animals. Hao1 KO mice were born normally and exhibited no obvious phenotypes, including growth retardation. Moreover, Hao1 KO mice did not exhibit ectopic ossification or calcification. However, urinary levels of some metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were significantly lower in Hao1 KO compared to control mice based on comprehensive metabolomic analysis. Our data indicate that Hao1 loss does not promote ectopic ossification, but rather that Hao1 functions to regulate the TCA cycle in vivo.\n\nBackground: Emerging evidence has shown that charged metabolites, such as amino acids, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of various metabolic disorders, many of which women in the postmenopausal period are at high risk of developing. This study examined the metabolic profile of middle-aged Japanese women to investigate alterations in charged metabolites induced by menopausal transition. Methods: The participants were 1193 female residents aged 40–60 at the baseline survey of the Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort Study. We investigated the cross-sectional association of menopausal status with 94 metabolomic biomarkers assayed in fasting plasma samples via capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry using linear regression analysis. Results: Among the participants, 529 were premenopausal, 132 were in menopausal transition (MT), and 532 were postmenopausal. Significant differences were found in age, blood pressure, glucose and lipid levels, and smoking and drinking habits among the three groups. The concentrations of 5 metabolites in the MT group and 15 metabolites in the postmenopausal group were significantly higher than those in the premenopausal group after adjusting for confounding factors. When classified into pathways, these metabolites were related to the tricarboxylic cycle, urea cycle, and homocysteine metabolism, some of which are linked to arteriosclerosis. Conclusion: Multiple charged metabolites were associated with women's menopausal status, showing a gradual increase as women shifted from pre-, to peri-, to postmenopause. These findings might reflect the early changes behind the increased risk of dyslipidemia, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis in later life.\n\nGroup II introns (G2Is) are ribozymes that have retroelement characteristics in prokaryotes. Although G2Is are suggested to have been an important evolutionary factor in the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition, comprehensive analyses of these introns among the tens of thousands of prokaryotic genomes currently available are still limited. Here, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline that systematically collects G2Is and applied it to prokaryotic genomes. We found that in bacteria, 25% (447 of 1,790) of the total representative genomes had an average of 5.3 G2Is, and in archaea, 9% (28 of 296) of the total representative genomes had an average of 3.0 G2Is. The greatest number of G2Is per genome was 101 in Arthrospira platensis (phylum Cyanobacteriota). A comprehensive sequence analysis of the intron-encoded protein (IEP) in each G2I sequence was conducted and resulted in the addition of three new IEP classes (U1–U3) to the previous classification. This analysis suggested that about 30% of all IEPs are non-canonical IEPs. The number of G2Is per genome was defined almost at the phylum level, and at least in the following two phyla, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteriota, the type of IEP was largely associated as a factor in the G2I increase, i.e., there was an explosive increase in G2Is with bacterial C-type IEPs, mainly in the phylum Firmicutes, and in G2Is with CL-type IEPs, mainly in the phylum Cyanobacteriota. We also systematically analyzed the relationship between genomic signatures and the mechanism of these increases in G2Is. This is the first study to systematically characterize G2Is in the prokaryotic phylogenies.\n\nCancer-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are multifunctional particles with a lipid bilayer structure that are involved in cancer progression, such as malignant proliferation, distant metastasis, and cancer immunity evasion. The separation protocol used to isolate sEVs is an important process and thus, several have been developed, including ultracentrifugation (UC), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and affinity purification using antibodies against sEV surface antigens. However, the effects of different separation methods on sEV components have not been adequately examined. Here, we developed a semi-automated system for collecting sEVs by combining SEC and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography and applied it to metabolome analysis. The developed SEC system could recover sEVs more efficiently and non-destructively than UC, suggesting that it is an appropriate recovery method for metabolic analysis and reflects biological conditions. Furthermore, using the developed SEC system, we performed metabolome analysis of sEVs from isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH)-mutated human colon HCT116 cells, which produce the oncogenic metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG). IDH1-mutated HCT116 cells released significantly more sEVs than wild-type (WT) cells. The metabolomic profiles of IDH1 mutant and WT cells showed distinct differences between the cells and their sEVs. Notably, in IDH mutant cells, large amounts of 2-HG were detected not only in cells, but also in sEVs. These results indicate that the SEC system we developed has wide potential applications in sEVs research.\n\nThere have been a number of reports about the transcriptional regulatory networks in schizophrenia. However, most of these studies were based on a specific transcription factor or a single dataset, an approach that is inadequate to understand the diverse etiology and underlying common characteristics of schizophrenia. Here we reconstructed and compared the transcriptional regulatory network for lipid metabolism enzymes using 15 public transcriptome datasets of neural cells from schizophrenia patients. Since many of the well-known schizophrenia-related SNPs are in enhancers, we reconstructed a network including enhancer-dependent regulation and found that 53.3 % of the total number of edges (7,577 pairs) involved regulation via enhancers. By examining multiple datasets, we found common and unique transcriptional modes of regulation. Furthermore, enrichment analysis of SNPs that were connected with genes in the transcriptional regulatory networks by eQTL suggested an association with hematological cell counts and some other traits/diseases, whose relationship to schizophrenia was either not or insufficiently reported in previous studies. Based on these results, we suggest that in future studies on schizophrenia, information on genotype, comorbidities and hematological cell counts should be included, along with the transcriptome, for a more detailed genetic stratification and mechanistic exploration of schizophrenia.\n\nCurrently, large-scale cohort studies for metabolome analysis have been launched globally. However, only a few studies have evaluated the reliability of urinary metabolome analysis. This study aimed to establish the reliability of urinary metabolomic profiling in cohort studies. In the Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort Study, 123 charged metabolites were identified and routinely quantified using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS). We evaluated approximately 750 quality control (QC) samples and 6,720 participants’ spot urine samples. We calculated inter- and intra-batch coefficients of variation in the QC and participant samples and technical intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). A correlation of metabolite concentrations between spot and 24-h urine samples obtained from 32 sub-cohort participants was also evaluated. The coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 20% for 87 metabolites (70.7%) and 20–30% for 19 metabolites (15.4%) in the QC samples. There was less than 20% inter-batch CV for 106 metabolites (86.2%). Most urinary metabolites would have reliability for measurement. The 96 metabolites (78.0%) was above 0.75 for the estimated ICC, and those might be useful for epidemiological analysis. Among individuals, the Pearson correlation coefficient of 24-h and spot urine was more than 70% for 59 of the 99 metabolites. These results show that the profiling of charged metabolites using CE-MS in morning spot human urine is suitable for epidemiological metabolomics studies.\n\nBackground: Cisplatin (CDDP) significantly prolongs survival in various cancers, but many patients also develop resistance that results in treatment failure. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which ovarian cancer cells acquire CDDP resistance. Methods: We evaluated the metabolic profiles in CDDP-sensitive ovarian cancer A2780 cells and CDDP-resistant A2780cis cells using capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). We further examined the expression of glutamine metabolism enzymes using real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. Cell viability was accessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results: The results showed that levels of glutamine, glutamate, and glutathione (GSH), a key drug resistance mediator synthesized from glutamate, were significantly elevated in A2780cis cells than those in A2780 cells. Furthermore, glutamine starvation decreased the GSH levels and CDDP resistance in A2780cis cells. Interestingly, the expression of glutamine synthetase (GS/GLUL), which synthesizes glutamine from glutamate and thereby negatively regulates GSH production, was almost completely suppressed in resistant A2780cis cells. In addition, treatment of A2780cis cells with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a DNA-demethylating agent, restored GS expression and reduced CDDP resistance. In contrast, GS knockdown in CDDP-sensitive A2780 cells induced CDDP resistance. Conclusions: The results indicate that upregulation of GSH synthesis from glutamine via DNA methylation-mediated silencing of GS causes CDDP resistance in A2780cis cells. Therefore, glutamine metabolism could be a novel therapeutic target against CDDP resistance.\n\nBackground: Many limno-terrestrial tardigrades can enter an ametabolic state, known as anhydrobiosis, upon desiccation, in which the animals can withstand extreme environments. Through genomics studies, molecular components of anhydrobiosis are beginning to be elucidated, such as the expansion of oxidative stress response genes, loss of stress signaling pathways, and gain of tardigrade-specific heat-soluble protein families designated CAHS and SAHS. However, to date, studies have predominantly investigated the class Eutardigrada, and molecular mechanisms in the remaining class, Heterotardigrada, still remains elusive. To address this gap in the research, we report a multiomics study of the heterotardigrade Echiniscus testudo, one of the most desiccation-tolerant species which is not yet culturable in laboratory conditions. Results: In order to elucidate the molecular basis of anhydrobiosis in E. testudo, we employed a multi-omics strategy encompassing genome sequencing, differential transcriptomics, and proteomics. Using ultra-low input library sequencing protocol from a single specimen, we sequenced and assembled the 153.7 Mbp genome annotated using RNA-Seq data. None of the previously identified tardigrade-specific abundant heat-soluble genes was conserved, while the loss and expansion of existing pathways were partly shared. Furthermore, we identified two families novel abundant heat-soluble proteins, which we named E. testudo Abundant Heat Soluble (EtAHS), that are predicted to contain large stretches of disordered regions. Likewise the AHS families in eutardigrada, EtAHS shows structural changes from random coil to alphahelix as the water content was decreased in vitro. These characteristics of EtAHS proteins are analogous to those of CAHS in eutardigrades, while there is no conservation at the sequence level. Conclusions: Our results suggest that Heterotardigrada have partly shared but distinct anhydrobiosis machinery compared with Eutardigrada, possibly due to convergent evolution within Tardigrada. (276/350).\n\nPolyrhachis lamellidens is a temporary socially parasitic ant whose new queen utilizes other ant species in the early stages of colony foundation. Field observations and rearing experiments suggest that Camponotus japonicus is a host species of P. lamellidens. It is presumed that Camponotus obscuripes is also a host of P. lamellidens by rearing experiments and field observations; however, there are no records of P. lamellidens workers or brood coexisting in C. obscuripes colonies in field observations, and there is no clear evidence that C. obscuripes is a natural host of P. lamellidens. We conducted detailed field observations, behavioral tests, and rearing experiments to show that C. obscuripes is a host of temporary social parasites. We found colonies with P. lamellidens queens, workers, and larvae intermixed with C. obscuripes workers in the field. Behavioral tests showed that workers of both species in mixed colonies did not attack each other and maintained nestmate recognition ability, which suggests a collaborative nestmate relationship. Furthermore, a rearing experiment confirmed social parasitism by P. lamellidens among C. obscuripes by producing a mixed brood-producing colony. These are the first field and laboratory records of temporary social parasitism involving P. lamellidens and C. obscuripes.\n\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a rapid decline in kidney function. The associated syndromes may lead to increased morbidity and mortality, but its early detection remains difficult. Using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS), we analyzed the urinary metabolomic profile of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after invasive surgery. Urine samples were collected at six time points: before surgery, at ICU admission and 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after. First, urine samples from 61 initial patients (non-AKI: 23, mild AKI: 24, severe AKI: 14) were measured, followed by the measurement of urine samples from 60 additional patients (non-AKI: 40, mild AKI: 20). Glycine and ethanolamine were decreased in patients with AKI compared with non-AKI patients at 6–24 h in the two groups. The linear statistical model constructed at each time point by machine learning achieved the best performance at 24 h (median AUC: 89%, cross-validated) for the 1st group. When cross-validated between the two groups, the AUC showed the best value of 70% at 12 h. These results identified metabolites and time points that show patterns specific to subjects who develop AKI, paving the way for the development of better biomarkers.\n\nLarge-scale metabolomic studies have become common, and the reliability of the peak data produced by the various instruments is an important issue. However, less attention has been paid to the large number of uncharacterized peaks in untargeted metabolomics data. In this study, we tested various criteria to assess the reliability of 276 and 202 uncharacterized peaks that were detected in a gathered set of 30 plasma and urine quality control samples, respectively, using capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). The linear relationship between the amounts of pooled samples and the corresponding peak areas was one of the criteria used to select reliable peaks. We used samples from approximately 3000 participants in the Tsuruoka Metabolome Cohort Study to investigate patterns of the areas of these uncharacterized peaks among the samples and clustered the peaks by combining the patterns and differences in the migration times. Our assessment pipeline removed substantial numbers of unreliable or redundant peaks and detected 35 and 74 reliable uncharacterized peaks in plasma and urine, respectively, some of which may correspond to metabolites involved in important physiological processes such as disease progression. We propose that our assessment pipeline can be used to help establish large-scale untargeted clinical metabolomic studies.\n\nThe increasing number of patients with osteoporosis and sarcopenia is a global concern among countries with progressively aging societies. The high medical costs of treating those patients suggest that prevention rather than treatment is preferable. We enrolled 729 subjects who attended both the second and third surveys of the Research on Osteoarthritis/Osteoporosis Against Disability (ROAD) study. Blood samples were collected from subjects at the second survey, and then a comprehensive metabolomic analysis was performed. It was found that 35 had newly developed osteoporosis at the third survey performed four years later, and 39 were newly diagnosed with sarcopenia at the third survey. In the second survey, we found that serum Gly levels were significantly higher even after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI in subjects with newly developed osteoporosis relative to those who remained osteoporosis-negative during the four-year follow-up. We also show that serum taurine levels were significantly lower at the second survey, even after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI in subjects with newly developed sarcopenia during the four-year follow-up compared with those not diagnosed with sarcopenia at the second or third surveys. Though our sample size and odds ratios were small, increased Gly and decreased taurine levels were found to be predictive of new development of osteoporosis and sarcopenia, respectively, within four years.\n\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) released from cancer cells contribute to various malignant phenotypes of cancer, including metastasis, cachexia, and angiogenesis. Although DNA, mRNAs, miRNAs, and proteins contained in EVs have been extensively studied, the function of metabolites in EVs remains unclear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive metabolomic analysis of pancreatic cancer cells, PANC-1, cultured under different oxygen concentrations, and small EVs (sEVs) released from them, considering the fact that hypoxia contributes to the malignant behavior of cells in pancreatic cancer, which is a poorly diagnosed cancer. sEVs were collected by ultracen-trifugation, and hydrophilic metabolites were analyzed using capillary ion chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and lipids were analyzed by supercrit-ical fluid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 140 hydrophilic metabolites and 494 lipids were detected in sEVs, and their profiles were different from those in cells. In addition, the metabolomic profile of sEVs was observed to change under hypoxic stress, and an increase in metabolites involved in angiogenesis was also detected. We reveal the hallmark of the metabolites contained in sEVs and the effect of tumor hypoxia on their profiles, which may help in understanding EV-mediated cancer malignancy.\n\nSpider silk is a natural fiber with remarkable strength, toughness, and elasticity that is attracting attention as a biomaterial of the future. Golden orb-weaving spiders (Trichonephila clavata) construct large, strong webs using golden threads. To characterize the pigment of golden T. clavata dragline silk, we used liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis. We found that the major pigment in the golden dragline silk of T. clavata was xanthurenic acid. To investigate the possible function of the pigment, we tested the effect of xanthurenic acid on bacterial growth using gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. We found that xanthurenic acid had a slight antibacterial effect. Furthermore, to investigate the UV tolerance of the T. clavata threads bleached of their golden color, we conducted tensile deformation tests and scanning electron microscope observations. However, in these experiments, no significant effect was observed. We therefore speculate that golden orb-weaving spiders use the pigment for other purposes, such as to attract their prey in the sunlight.\n\nFood intake biomarkers can be critical tools that can be used to objectively assess dietary exposure for both epidemiological and clinical nutrition studies. While an accurate estimation of food intake is essential to unravel associations between the intake and specific health conditions, random and systematic errors affect self-reported assessments. This study aimed to clarify how habitual food intake influences the circulating plasma metabolome in a free-living Japanese regional population and to identify potential food intake biomarkers. To achieve this aim, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis as part of a large cohort study. From a baseline survey of the Tsuruoka Metabolome Cohort Study, 7, 012 eligible male and female participants aged 40-69 years were chosen for this study. All data on patients' health status and dietary intake were assessed via a food frequency questionnaire, and plasma samples were obtained during an annual physical examination. Ninety-four charged plasma metabolites were measured using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry, by a non-targeted approach. Statistical analysis was performed using partial-least-square regression. A total of 21 plasma metabolites were likely to be associated with long-term food intake of nine food groups. In particular, the influential compounds in each food group were hydroxyproline for meat, trimethylamine- N-oxide for fish, choline for eggs, galactarate for dairy, cystine and betaine for soy products, threonate and galactarate for carotenoid-rich vegetables, proline betaine for fruits, quinate and trigonelline for coffee, and pipecolate for alcohol, and these were considered as prominent food intake markers in Japanese eating habits. A set of circulating plasma metabolites was identified as potential food intake biomarkers in the Japanese community-dwelling population. These results will open the way for the application of new reliable dietary assessment tools not by self-reported measurements but through objective quantification of biofluids.\n\nBackground. Based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese herbs possess four different medicinal properties: Hot, warm, cold, and cool. These serve as a reference guide for these herbal medicines. However, the molecular mechanisms supporting their relevance remain unclear. Methods. We performed metabolomics based on capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF/MS) and multivariate data analysis for the structural identification of compounds of cold- A nd hot-natured Chinese herbs. Results. To this end, 30 selected herbs were analyzed and a total of 416 metabolites were identified via CE-TOF/MS, of which 193 compounds were detected in most herbs. The observed profiles offered the potential to understand the mechanism of association between the compounds and nature of the Chinese herbs. Comparison of the similarity in terms of chemical and molecular structures and content revealed that hot-natured herbs contained more nucleotides. In contrast, principal component analysis revealed the presence of more amino acid compounds in cold-natured herbs. Conclusion. Comparing the structural similarities between the samples using the Tanimoto coefficient revealed that a general non-specific structure was observed between cold- A nd hot-natured herbs; however, the distribution of the molecular groups seemed to contribute more toward the energy properties.\n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an invasive malignancy that develops in the pleural cavity, and antifolates are used as chemotherapeutics for treating. The majority of antifolates, including pemetrexed (PMX), inhibit enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis. MPM patients frequently develop drug resistance in clinical practice, however the associated drug-resistance mechanism is not well understood. This study was aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying resistance to PMX in MPM cell lines. We found that among the differentially expressed genes associated with drug resistance (determined by RNA sequencing), TYMS expression was higher in the established resistant cell lines than in the parental cell lines. Knocking down TYMS expression significantly reduced drug resistance in the resistant cell lines. Conversely, TYMS overexpression significantly increased drug resistance in the parental cells. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the levels of dTMP were higher in the resistant cell lines than in the parental cell lines; however, resistant cells showed no changes in dTTP levels after PMX treatment. We found that the nucleic acid-biosynthetic pathway is important for predicting the efficacy of PMX in MPM cells. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) assays suggested that H3K27 acetylation in the 5′-UTR of TYMS may promote its expression in drug-resistant cells. Our findings indicate that the intracellular levels of dTMP are potential biomarkers for the effective treatment of patients with MPM and suggest the importance of regulatory mechanisms of TYMS expression in the disease.\n\nPredictions of distant cancer metastasis based on gene signatures are studied intensively to realise precise diagnosis and treatments. Gene selection i.e. feature selection is a cornerstone to both establish accurate predictions and understand underlying pathologies. Here, we developed a simple but robust feature selection method using a correlation-centred approach to select minimal gene sets that have both high predictive and generalisation abilities. A multiple logistic regression model was used to predict 5-year metastases of patients with breast cancer. Gene expression data obtained from tumour samples of lymph node-negative breast cancer patients were randomly split into training and validation data. Our method selected 12 genes using training data and this showed a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.730 compared with 0.579 yielded by previously reported 76 genes. The signature with the predictive model was validated in an independent dataset, and its higher generalization ability was observed. Gene ontology analyses revealed that our method consistently selected genes with identical functions which frequently selected by the 76 genes. Taken together, our method identifies fewer gene sets bearing high predictive abilities, which would be versatile and applicable to predict other factors such as the outcomes of medical treatments and prognoses of other cancer types.\n\nOrb-weaving spiders have two main methods of prey capture: cribellate spiders use dry, sticky capture threads, and ecribellate spiders use viscid glue droplets. Predation behaviour is a major evolutionary driving force, and it is important on spider phylogeny whether the cribellate and ecribellate spiders each evolved the orb architecture independently or both strategies were derived from an ancient orb web. These hypotheses have been discussed based on behavioural and morphological characteristics, with little discussion on this subject from the perspective of molecular materials of orb web, since there is little information about cribellate spider-associated spidroin genes. Here, we present in detail a spidroin catalogue of six uloborid species of cribellate orb-weaving spiders, including cribellate and pseudoflagelliform spidroins, with transcriptome assembly complemented with long read sequencing, where silk composition is confirmed by proteomics. Comparative analysis across families (Araneidae and Uloboridae) shows that the gene architecture, repetitive domains, and amino acid frequencies of the orb web constituting silk proteins are similar among orb-weaving spiders regardless of the prey capture strategy. Notably, the fact that there is a difference only in the prey capture thread proteins strongly supports the monophyletic origin of the orb web.\n\n18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is usually used for staging or evaluation of treatment response rather than for cancer screening. However,18F-FDG PET/CT has also been used in Japan for cancer screening in people with no cancer symptoms, and accumulating evidence supports this application of18F-FDG PET/CT. Previously, we have observed a correlation between the saliva and tumor metabolomic profiles in patients with oral cancer. Hence, if salivary metabolites demonstrate a significant correlation with PET parameters such as the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), they may have the potential to be used as a screening tool before PET/CT to identify patients with high SUVmax. Hence, in this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between salivary metabolites and SUVmax of18F-FDG PET/CT using previously collected data.18F-FDG PET/CT was performed for staging 26 patients with oral cancer. The collected data were integrated and analyzed along with quantified salivary hydrophilic metabolites obtained from the same patients with oral cancer and controls (n = 44). In total, 11 metabolites showed significant correlations with SUVmax in the delayed phases. A multiple logistic regression model of the two metabolites showed the ability to discriminate between patients with oral cancer and controls, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.738 (p = 0.001). This study uniquely confirmed a relationship between salivary metabolites and SUVmax of PET/CT in patients with oral cancer; salivary metabolites were significantly correlated with SUVmax. These salivary metabolites can be used as a screening tool before PET/CT to identify patients with high SUVmax, i.e., to detect the presence of oral cancer.\n\nAs the physical properties and functionality of dipeptides differ from those of amino acids, they have attracted attention in metabolomics; however, their functions in vivo have not been clarified in detail. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, and its major cause is chronic hepatitis. This study was conducted to explore tumor-specific dipeptide characteristics by performing comprehensive dipeptide analysis in the tumor and surrounding nontumor tissue of patients with HCC. Dipeptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis tandem mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis using 236 detected dipeptides showed differences in the dipeptide profiles between nontumor and tumor tissues; however, no clear difference was observed in etiological comparison. In addition, the N-and C-terminal amino acid compositions of the detected dipeptides significantly differed, suggesting the substrate specificity of enzyme proteins, such as peptidase. Furthermore, hepatitis-derived HCC may show a characteristic dipeptide profile even before tumor formation. These results provide insight into HCC pathogenesis and may help identify novel biomarkers for diagnosis.\n\nThe tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris can undergo anhydrobiosis. Several chemicals that inhibit successful anhydrobiosis in H. exemplaris have been identified, and these chemicals inhibit the activity of signaling molecules. In the present study, we investigated whether upregulation of the activity of these signaling molecules could improve desiccation tolerance of H. exemplaris. Pre-treatment with an indirect activator of AMP-activated protein kinase [AMPK; which directly inhibits mammalian NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 [NQO1] of mitochondrial complex I (D942)] significantly improved desiccation tolerance of H. exemplaris, whereas a direct activator of AMPK did not. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we examined the proteome of tardigrades treated with D942. Two proteins, putative glutathione S-transferase and pirin-like protein, were upregulated by treatment. Both of these proteins are known to be associated with the response to oxidative stress. One of the downregulated proteins was serine/threonine-proteinphosphatase 2A (PP2A) 65-kDa regulatory subunit A alpha isoform, and it is interesting to note that PP2A activity was previously suggested to be required for successful anhydrobiosis in H. exemplaris. Taken together, our results suggest that D942 treatment may partially induce responses common to those of desiccation stress. The identification of a chemical that improves desiccation tolerance of H. exemplaris may facilitate further investigation into desiccation tolerance mechanisms.\n\nDipeptides have attracted much attention as post-amino acids with physical properties and functions different from those of amino acids. However, a given dipeptide cannot be distinguished by mass spectrometry from its structural isomer with an opposite amino acid binding order unless these isomers are separated before introduction, which complicates the comprehensive analysis of dipeptides. Herein, a novel analytical platform for dipeptide analysis by capillary electrophoresis tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry is developed. This method is used to quantitate 335 dipeptides and achieves excellent separation of structural isomers with opposite binding orders, high correlation coefficients, and low instrumental detection limits (0.088-83.1 nM). Moreover, acceptable recoveries (70-135%) are observed for most tested dipeptides in chicken liver samples spiked both before and after preparation. The developed method is also applied to the quantitation of dipeptides in the livers of mice fed different diets to detect 236 dipeptides, and the shift from a normal diet to a high-fat diet is shown to increase/decrease (p < 0.05, fold-change < 0.5) the contents of 0/29 dipeptides, respectively. The developed method is expected to facilitate the search for new dipeptide applications such as novel functional components of foods and biomarkers of diseases.\n\nRecently, ion chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry has been used for the determination of anionic metabolites. However, connection with a mass spectrometer in this method is not straightforward because backpressure produced by the addition of a make-up solution often affects the peak resolutions of the target metabolites. To overcome this problem, we developed a capillary ion chromatography-mass spectrometry method utilizing a double coaxial electrospray ionization sprayer. This method was not affected by backpressure and the number of theoretical plates was about three times that of a conventional sprayer. Under optimized conditions, 44 anionic metabolites, including organic acids, sugar phosphates, nucleotides, and cofactors, were successfully separated and selectively detected with a Q Exactive mass spectrometer. The calibration curves of the tested metabolites showed excellent linearity within the range of 1–100,000 nmol/L and the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.991. The detection limits for these metabolites were between 1 and 500 nmol/L (0.4 and 200 fmol). The developed method was applied to the quantitation of anionic metabolites in cultured cancer cell samples with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulation. This allowed for the successful determination of 105 metabolites. The levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates changed significantly after TNF-α stimulation. These results demonstrate that the developed method is a promising new tool for comprehensive analysis of anionic metabolites.\n\nUndaria pinnatifida is a seaweed native to Japan, where it is cultivated and sold commercially as food. Fresh seaweed commonly blanches before consumption. However, the effects of blanching on metabolites present in different parts of U. pinnatifida, namely, Wakame (leaf) and Mekabu (sporophyll), are not well understood. Here, we investigated changes in metabolites in these two seaweed parts after blanching for different periods. The samples were freeze-dried and extracted using methanol-water, and metabolite concentration was quantitated using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry. The concentration of most metabolites was the highest in raw samples, decreasing drastically within 20 s of blanching in Wakame and decreasing gradually in Mekabu. In contrast, the concentration of some fatty acids, such as octanoate, increased in both parts. During blanching, seaweed color changed from brown to green, and blanching did not significantly affect amino acid or the sugar composition. Finally, a relationship was found between metabolite and blanching-related characteristics, such as color and drying percentage.\n\nDry-cured ham with a long ripening period is a valuable product worldwide. Ripening time is a key determinant of the endogenous metabolites that characterize the flavor and taste of ham products. While various studies have analyzed the relationship between ripening duration and sensory characteristics, no studies have evaluated ham products produced in Japan. Here, we conducted time-course metabolomic profiling, taste sensor-based analyses, and sensory evaluations by non-trained consumers during ripening. Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry was used to quantify non-volatile metabolites, such as amino acids, organic acids, and nucleotides. In an analysis of eight time-points during 680 days of ripening, the highest score for the after-taste of umami was observed on day 540, despite subtle changes in the scores for other properties. The concentrations of aspartic acid and glutamic acid relative to those of total amino acids were the highest at this point. This approach can contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the metabolite profile and ripening duration.\n\nWe found that nuclear envelopes stabilize against surfactants in the presence of ethylene glycol (EG). We, therefore, developed a novel subcellular fractionation approach for proteomics using RIPA buffer containing EG and phase transfer surfactants. This method involves separating the cells into the cytoplasm, organelles, and nucleus, including intermediate filaments without ultracentrifugation. These fractions are directly applicable to sample preparation for shotgun proteomics as they have no mass spectrometry (MS)-incompatible chemicals, whereas those separated by traditional fractionation protocols require desalting. This protocol is successfully applied to subcellular fractionation with only 3.5 × 10 cells. Here, it was combined with phosphoproteomics and proteomics to identify phosphorylation sites regulating protein subcellular localization. In total, 59 phosphorylation sites on 42 phosphopeptides and 32 proteins showing different enrichment patterns between phosphoproteomics and the corresponding proteomics were identified, which are potential candidate sites to regulate the protein subcellular localization, including serine 706 on CD44 and serine 22 on lamin A/C. 5\n\n© 2019, The Author(s). Members of the family Araneidae are common orb-weaving spiders, and they produce several types of silks throughout their behaviors and lives, from reproduction to foraging. Egg sac, prey capture thread, or dragline silk possesses characteristic mechanical properties, and its variability makes it a highly attractive material for ecological, evolutional, and industrial fields. However, the complete set of constituents of silks produced by a single species is still unclear, and novel spidroin genes as well as other proteins are still being found. Here, we present the first genome in genus Araneus together with the full set of spidroin genes with unamplified long reads and confirmed with transcriptome of the silk glands and proteome analysis of the dragline silk. The catalogue includes the first full length sequence of a paralog of major ampullate spidroin MaSp3, and several spider silk-constituting elements designated SpiCE. Family-wide phylogenomic analysis of Araneidae suggests the relatively recent acquisition of these genes, and multiple-omics analyses demonstrate that these proteins are critical components in the abdominal spidroin gland and dragline silk, contributing to the outstanding mechanical properties of silk in this group of species.\n\nThe anhydrobiotic tardigrade, Hypsibius exemplaris, was previously considered to require de novo gene expression and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity for successful anhydrobiosis. These indicate that H. exemplaris has signal transduction systems responding to desiccation stress, with the involvement of phosphorylation events. To this end, we carried out time-series phosphoproteomics of H. exemplaris exposed to mild desiccation stress and detected 48 phosphoproteins with significant differential regulations. Among them, immediate and successive reduction of phosphorylation levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was observed. The subsequent chemical genetic approach showed that AMPK was activated during the preconditioning stage for anhydrobiosis, and inhibition of its activity impaired successful anhydrobiosis. As PP2A is known to dephosphorylate AMPK in other organisms, we suggested that decreased phosphorylation levels of AMPK upon mild desiccation stress were caused by dephosphorylation by PP2A. Accordingly, phosphoproteomics of animals pre-treated with the PP1/PP2A inhibitor cantharidic acid (CA) lacked the decrease in phosphorylation levels of AMPK. These observations suggest that AMPK activity is required for successful anhydrobiosis in H. exemplaris, and its phosphorylation state is possibly regulated by PP2A.\n\nArthropod silk is known as a versatile tool, and its variability makes it an attractive biomaterial. Eumeta variegata is a bagworm moth (Lepidoptera, Psychidae) that uses silk throughout all life stages. Notably, the bagworm-specific uses of silk include larval development in a bag coated with silk and plant materials and the use of silk attachments to hang pupae. An understanding at the molecular level of bagworm silk, which enables such unique purposes, is an opportunity to expand the possibilities for artificial biomaterial design. However, very little is known about the bagworm fibroin gene and the mechanical properties of bagworm silk. Here, we report the bagworm genome, including a silk fibroin gene. The genome is approximately 700 Mbp in size, and the newly found fibroin gene has a unique repetitive motif. Furthermore, a mechanical property test demonstrates a phylogenetic relationship between the unique motif and tensile strength of bagworm silk.\n\nChemical evolution is an abiotic reaction process in which complex organic molecules arise from a combination of simple inorganic and organic chemical compounds. To assess the possible ongoing chemical evolution in the subsurface ocean of Saturn's icy satellite Enceladus, we explored the water-rock aqueous reactions and the peptide formation capability under a hydrothermal environment similar to that on Enceladus. It has been suggested that the core of Enceladus has not experienced high temperatures from the time of satellite formation to the present. The major components of the core are assumed to be carbonaceous chondrites; thus, simple organic substances, including amino acids, are likely present in the alkaline seawater of Enceladus. In this study, we conducted a laboratory-based simulation experiment to describe the chemical alteration of six prebiotically abundant amino acids over 147 days under high pressure with thermal cycling (30 to 100 °C) to simulate the water-rock interface of the ocean on Enceladus. As a result, we detected 28 out of 36 possible dipeptide species during the entire reaction period. We propose that peptide-bond formation is coupled to rock surface chemisorption of amino acids under alkaline condition, which was further supported by the elemental analysis showing carbon and nitrogen signature on the rock surface only when amino acids are added. The above result suggests that ongoing chemical evolution on Enceladus is likely producing short abiotic peptides on the porous core surface.\n\nBackground: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) play a key role in energy homeostasis. Objective: We aimed to investigate the association between plasma BCAA levels and dyslipidemia in the Japanese population without diabetes mellitus. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 4952 participants without diabetes mellitus, enrolled in the Tsuruoka Metabolomic Cohort Study. Plasma BCAA levels were measured by capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry. Correlations between lipid and BCAA profiles were evaluated by sex-stratified multiple linear regression analyses, after adjusting for confounders. Logistic regression was used to identify associations between BCAAs and metabolic dyslipidemia (MD) defined as triglyceride levels ≥150 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≤40 mg/dL for men and ≤50 mg/dL for women, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels ≥140 mg/dL. Results: In both sexes, the levels of individual BCAAs and the total BCAA levels correlated positively with triglyceride levels and negatively with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Valine, leucine, and total BCAA levels were weakly and positively correlated with LDL-C levels. Increased BCAA levels showed positive associations with MD. However, associations between BCAAs and elevated LDL-C levels were unclear. Furthermore, the associations between BCAA levels and MD regardless of fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels (high or low). Although valine, leucine, and total BCAA levels were weakly associated with elevated LDL-C levels in the high-FBS group, no such association was observed in the low-FBS group. Conclusions: BCAAs might be associated with MD independently of the FBS level and might play an important role in lipid metabolism and dyslipidemia.\n\n© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Purpose: The aim of this study is to explore new salivary biomarkers to discriminate breast cancer patients from healthy controls. Methods: Saliva samples were collected after 9 h fasting and were immediately stored at − 80 °C. Capillary electrophoresis and liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry were used to quantify hundreds of hydrophilic metabolites. Conventional statistical analyses and artificial intelligence-based methods were used to assess the discrimination abilities of the quantified metabolites. A multiple logistic regression (MLR) model and an alternative decision tree (ADTree)-based machine learning method were used. The generalization abilities of these mathematical models were validated in various computational tests, such as cross-validation and resampling methods. Results: One hundred sixty-six unstimulated saliva samples were collected from 101 patients with invasive carcinoma of the breast (IC), 23 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 42 healthy controls (C). Of the 260 quantified metabolites, polyamines were significantly elevated in the saliva of patients with breast cancer. Spermine showed the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curves [0.766; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.671–0.840, P ' 0.0001] to discriminate IC from C. In addition to spermine, polyamines and their acetylated forms were elevated in IC only. Two hundred each of two-fold, five-fold, and ten-fold cross-validation using different random values were conducted and the MLR model had slightly better accuracy. The ADTree with an ensemble approach showed higher accuracy (0.912; 95% CI 0.838–0.961, P ' 0.0001). These prediction models also included spermine as a predictive factor. Conclusions: These data indicated that combinations of salivary metabolomics with the ADTree-based machine learning methods show potential for non-invasive screening of breast cancer.\n\n© 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution. Clp1, a polyribonucleotide 5′-hydroxyl kinase in eukaryotes, is involved in pretRNA splicing and mRNA 3′-end formation. Enzymes similar in amino acid sequence to Clp1, Nol9, and Grc3, are present in some eukaryotes and are involved in prerRNA processing. However, our knowledge of how these Clp1 family proteins evolved and diversified is limited. We conducted a large-scale molecular evolutionary analysis of the Clp1 family proteins in all living organisms for which protein sequences are available in public databases. The phylogenetic distribution and frequencies of the Clp1 family proteins were investigated in complete genomes of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya. In total, 3,557 Clp1 family proteins were detected in the three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Many were from Archaea and Eukarya, but a few were found in restricted, phylogenetically diverse bacterial species. The domain structures of the Clp1 family proteins also differed among the three domains of life. Although the proteins were, on average, 555 amino acids long (range, 196-2,728), 122 large proteins with >1,000 amino acids were detected in eukaryotes. These novel proteins contain the conserved Clp1 polynucleotide kinase domain and various other functional domains. Of these proteins, >80% were from Fungi or Protostomia. The polyribonucleotide kinase activity of Thermus scotoductus Clp1 (Ts-Clp1) was characterized experimentally. Ts-Clp1 preferentially phosphorylates single-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (Km value for ATP, 2.5 μM), or single-stranded DNA at higher enzyme concentrations. We propose a comprehensive assessment of the diversification of the Clp1 family proteins and the molecular evolution of their functional domains.\n\n© 2019 Japanese Society of Phycology Parachlorococcum turfosum was previously described based on morphological studies of a culture collection strain originally identified as ‘Chlorococcum elkhartiense’ and on an 18S rRNA gene phylogeny of a strain derived from the same original strain but from a different culture collection. However, a subsequently published 18S rRNA gene sequence was inconsistent with the original sequence. Therefore, a new 18S rRNA gene sequence was obtained from the strain from which the holotype was derived. Comparative analyses of the new sequence using the basic local alignment search tool and a newly written Perl code, ChimViewP, which visualizes nucleotide signature shifts characteristic of chimeric sequences, revealed that the sequence used in the original description was of a chimeric nature. Similar analyses also indicated that two published ‘Chlamydomonas acidophila’ sequences are chimeric. Phylogenetic analyses excluding all putative chimeras showed that P. turfosum belongs to Chlorococcum, and thus Chlorococcum turfosum comb. nov. is proposed.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Harada et al. Strain SCT is an iodate-reducing bacterium isolated from marine sediment in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. In this study, we determined the draft genome sequence of strain SCT and compared it to complete genome sequences of other closely related bacteria, including Pseudomonas stutzeri. A phylogeny inferred from concatenation of core genes revealed that strain SCT was closely related to marine isolates of P. stutzeri. Genes present in the SCT genome but absent from the other analyzed P. stutzeri genomes comprised clusters corresponding to putative prophage regions and possible operons. They included pil genes, which encode type IV pili for natural transformation; the mer operon, which encodes resistance systems for mercury; and the pst operon, which encodes a Pi-specific transport system for phosphate uptake. We found that strain SCT had more prophage-like genes than the other P. stutzeri strains and that the majority (70%) of them were SCT strain-specific. These genes, encoded on distinct prophage regions, may have been acquired after branching from a common ancestor following independent phage transfer events. Thus, the genome sequence of Pseudomonas sp. strain SCT can provide detailed insights into its metabolic potential and the evolution of genetic elements associated with its unique phenotype.\n\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V. Background: Salivary secretion is an important parameter reflecting the health status of an individual and has been used clinically for the diagnosis of various oral diseases, such as xerostomia. Salivary metabolomic profiling is considered an emerging potential tool for the detection of various systemic diseases. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the quantitative relationship between salivary secretion volume and salivary metabolomic profile. Methods: To evaluate inter- and intra-day variations in salivary secretion, 234 saliva samples were collected three times per day for three days from 13 subjects and analyzed. Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry was used for non-targeted quantification of water-soluble metabolites. Results: No significant inter- or intra-day variations were observed in salivary secretion volume. No significant inter-day variations were observed in metabolomic patterns. In contrast, significant intra-day variations were observed in salivary metabolomic profiles. The difference was more obvious for stimulated saliva than for unstimulated saliva. These profile changes were independent of salivary secretion volume. Conclusions: Our results indicated that diurnal change had a greater effect on salivary metabolomic profiles than the other factors. Hence, sampling time should be tightly controlled to minimize unexpected bias in the clinical use of salivary metabolomics.\n\n© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Objectives: Perioperative nutritional management is essential for early recovery after liver surgery. The aim of this study was to assess changes in amino acid levels in serum and urine after hepatectomy. Methods: Serum samples were collected from 16 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma before and 1, 3, and 14 d after hepatectomy (S0, S1, S3, and S14, respectively). Spot urine samples were collected before and 3 d after the hepatectomy (U0 and U3). Metabolites in the serum and urine were analyzed. Results: Compared with S0, insulin levels significantly increased in the S1 and S3 samples. Valine levels significantly decreased in S1 and S14, and leucine levels significantly decreased in S14. Phenylalanine levels significantly increased in S1 and S3, and tyrosine levels significantly increased in S1. The Fischer ratio (branched-chain/aromatic amino acids) significantly decreased in S1 and S3. In multiple regression analysis, changes in serum taurine levels were related to the white blood cell count in S1 and S3, and inversely related to alanine aminotransferase levels in S14. Changes in serum glutamine levels were negatively related to C-reactive protein levels in S3. Serum glutamine levels decreased in S3 and S14, and tended to increase in U3, suggesting a deficiency of glutamate resulting from the invasive surgical procedure. Conclusions: These findings highlight the usefulness of metabolome analysis for characterizing perioperative patterns after liver resection. The observed amino acid pattern, including the reduction in Fischer ratio, underscores the need for specialized nutritional support.\n\n© 2019 The Author(s). Background: The microbial community of the built environment (BE) can impact the lives of people and has been studied for a variety of indoor, outdoor, underground, and extreme locations. Thus far, these microorganisms have mainly been investigated by culture-based methods or amplicon sequencing. However, both methods have limitations, complicating multi-study comparisons and limiting the knowledge gained regarding in-situ microbial lifestyles. A greater understanding of BE microorganisms can be achieved through basic information derived from the complete genome. Here, we investigate the level of diversity and genomic features (genome size, GC content, replication strand skew, and codon usage bias) from complete genomes of bacteria commonly identified in the BE, providing a first step towards understanding these bacterial lifestyles. Results: Here, we selected bacterial genera commonly identified in the BE (or \"Common BE genomes\") and compared them against other prokaryotic genera (\"Other genomes\"). The \"Common BE genomes\" were identified in various climates and in indoor, outdoor, underground, or extreme built environments. The diversity level of the 16S rRNA varied greatly between genera. The genome size, GC content and GC skew strength of the \"Common BE genomes\" were statistically larger than those of the \"Other genomes\" but were not practically significant. In contrast, the strength of selected codon usage bias (S value) was statistically higher with a large effect size in the \"Common BE genomes\" compared to the \"Other genomes.\" Conclusion: Of the four genomic features tested, the S value could play a more important role in understanding the lifestyles of bacteria living in the BE. This parameter could be indicative of bacterial growth rates, gene expression, and other factors, potentially affected by BE growth conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, and nutrients). However, further experimental evidence, species-level BE studies, and classification by BE location is needed to define the relationship between genomic features and the lifestyles of BE bacteria more robustly.\n\nPeriodically repeating DNA and protein elements are involved in various important biological events including genomic evolution, gene regulation, protein complex formation, and immunity. Notably, the currently used genome editing tools such as ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPRs are also all associated with periodically repeating biomolecules of natural organisms. Despite the biological importance of periodically repeating sequences and the expectation that new genome editing modules could be discovered from such periodical repeats, no software that globally detects such structured elements in large genomic resources in a high-throughput and unsupervised manner has been developed. We developed new software, SPADE (Search for Patterned DNA Elements), that exhaustively explores periodic DNA and protein repeats from large-scale genomic datasets based on k-mer periodicity evaluation. With a simple constraint, sequence periodicity, SPADE captured reported genome-editing-associated sequences and other protein families involving repeating domains such as tetratricopeptide, ankyrin and WD40 repeats with better performance than the other software designed for limited sets of repetitive biomolecular sequences, suggesting the high potential of this software to contribute to the discovery of new biological events and new genome editing modules.\n\n© 2018 American Chemical Society. Metabolome analysis using capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) has the potential to improve coverage of metabolite detection because of its high selectivity and sensitivity. Configuration of the interface between CE and HRMS to meet the ground connection is essential for enabling independent regulation of the electrical currents in the CE and electrospray field. In the present study, we applied an electrospray-ionization adapter equipped with a grounded nebulizer to CE-HRMS and tested the analytical performance for 34 charged compounds. The extracted-ion electropherograms, consisting of seven sets of isomers, showed reasonable peak shapes and separation for the annotation of each metabolite. The levels of 34 target analytes in a standard mixture were determined with a dynamic range of at least 10 2 , maintaining linearity with r 2 > 0.9. The repeatability and intermediate precision above the lower limit of quantification showed the relative standard deviation to be lower than 20%. In the spike-recovery experiment, 27 of the 34 metabolites in plasma extract were recovered at a rate of 80 to 120%, suggesting high accuracy. Furthermore, we assessed the feasibility of our platform in metabolome analysis using human-plasma extract. The results showed successful detection of 270 metabolites, indicating the potential of our platform to yield higher coverage of the metabolome. In addition, analysis of dilution integrity demonstrated the quantitative ability of metabolome analysis with CE-HRMS, although the existence of saturation or matrix effects were seen in the case of 33 of the metabolites. This study indicates that our platform has great potential for large-scale metabolome analysis of plasma for biological studies and clinical biomarker screening.\n\n© 2018 Elsevier Inc. In the green algal order Volvocales (Chlorophyceae), flagellate colonial forms have evolved at least four times. One of these colonial lineages, Tetrabaenaceae-Goniaceae-Volvocaceae (TGV), which belongs to the clade Reinhardtinia, is closely related to several unicellular chlamydomonads in the genera Chlamydomonas and Vitreochlamys. However, the unicellular sister of TGV has not been specified. Here, the largest ever 18S rRNA phylogenetic tree of Reinhardtinia was constructed including several newly isolated chlamydomonads, and a clade (core-Reinhardtinia) including 32 unicellular lineages and three colonial families were recognized. Interrelationships within core-Reinhardtinia were barely resolved in the tree, and therefore combined 18S-atpB-psaA-psaB-psbC-rbcL gene phylogenetic analyses were performed with selected representatives of 29 of the 32 unicellular lineages and three colonial families. The 29 unicellular lineages were clustered into five metaclades and an unassigned lineage; the metaclade that includes Chlamydomonas pila was resolved, with moderate support, as the sister clade to TGV. To examine possible biases from specific gene(s), long-branch taxa, and the heterogeneous base composition, phylogenetic analyses using several smaller data sets were also performed. Light microscopy of C. pila and its relatives indicated that any early steps towards colony evolution appeared after divergence of TGV from the C. pila lineage.\n\n© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Main Conclusion: Among seaweed groups, brown algae had characteristically high concentrations of mannitol, and green algae were characterised by fructose. In red algae, metabolite profiles of individual species should be evaluated. Seaweeds are metabolically different from terrestrial plants. However, general metabolite profiles of the three major seaweed groups, the brown, red, and green algae, and the effect of various extraction methods on metabolite profiling results have not been comprehensively explored. In this study, we evaluated the water-soluble metabolites in four brown, five red, and two green algae species collected from two sites in northern Japan, located in the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean. Freeze-dried seaweed samples were processed by methanol–water extraction with or without chloroform and analysed by capillary electrophoresis- and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for metabolite characterisation. The metabolite concentration profiles showed distinctive characteristic depends on species and taxonomic groups, whereas the extraction methods did not have a significant effect. Taxonomic differences between the various seaweed metabolite profiles were well defined using only sugar metabolites but no other major compound types. Mannitol was the main sugar metabolites in brown algae, whereas fructose, sucrose, and glucose were found at high concentrations in green algae. In red algae, individual species had some characteristic metabolites, such as sorbitol in Pyropia pseudolinearis and panose in Dasya sessilis. The metabolite profiles generated in this study will be a resource and provide guidance for nutraceutical research studies because the information about metabolites in seaweeds is still very limited compared to that of terrestrial plants.\n\nThe human skin surface harbors huge numbers of microbes. The skin microbiota interacts with its host and forms a skin microbiome profile that is specific for each individual. It has been reported that the skin microbiota that is left on an individual’s possessions can act as a sort of “fingerprint” and be used for owner identification. However, this approach needs to be improved to take into account any long-term instability of skin microbiota and contamination from nonspecific bacteria. Here, we took advantage of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 16S-encoding rRNA gene of Cutibacterium acnes, the most common and abundant bacterium on human skin, to perform owner identification. We first developed a high-throughput genotyping method based on next-generation sequencing to characterize the SNPs of the C. acnes 16S rRNA gene and found that the genotype composition of C. acnes 16S rRNA is individual specific. Owner identification accuracy of around 90% based on random forest machine learning was achieved by using a combination of C. acnes 16S rRNA genotype and skin microbiome profile data. Furthermore, our study showed that the C. acnes 16S rRNA genotype remained more stable over time than the skin microbiome profile. This characteristic of C. acnes was further confirmed by the analysis of publicly available human skin metagenome data. Our approach, with its high precision, good reproducibility, and low costs, thus provides new possibilities in the field of microbiome-based owner identification and forensics in general. IMPORTANCE Cutibacterium acnes is the most common and abundant bacterial species on human skin, and the gene that encodes its 16S rRNA has multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms. In this study, we developed a method to efficiently determine the C. acnes 16S rRNA genotype composition from microbial samples taken from the hands of participants and from their possessions. Using the C. acnes 16S rRNA genotype composition, we could predict the owner of a possession with around 90% accuracy when the 16S rRNA gene-based microbiome profile was included. We also showed that the C. acnes 16S rRNA genotype composition was more stable over time than the skin microbiome profile and thus is more suitable for owner identification.\n\nMost bacterial genomes have biased nucleotide composition, and the asymmetry is considered to be caused by a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) deamination arising from the bacterial replication machinery. In order to evaluate the relationship experimentally, the position and frequency of ssDNA formed during replication must be verified clearly. Although many ssDNA detection technologies exist, almost all methods have been developed for eukaryotic genomes. To apply these to bacterial genomes, which harbor a smaller amount of DNA than those of eukaryotes, more efficient, new methods are required. Therefore, we developed a novel strand-specific ssDNA sequencing method, called 4S-seq, for the bacterial genome. The 4S-seq method enriches ssDNA in the extracted genomic DNA by a dsDNA-specific nuclease and implements a strand-specific library using a biotin label with a customized tag. As a result, the 4S-seq is able to calculate the ssDNA content in each strand (Watson/Crick) at each position of the genome efficiently.\n\n© 2018 The Author(s). Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the thymidine catabolic pathway. TP is identical to platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor and contributes to tumour angiogenesis. TP induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances the expression of oxidative stress-responsive genes, such as interleukin (IL)-8. However, the mechanism underlying ROS induction by TP remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that TP promotes NADPH oxidase-derived ROS signalling in cancer cells. NADPH oxidase inhibition using apocynin or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) abrogated the induction of IL-8 and ROS in TP-expressing cancer cells. Meanwhile, thymidine catabolism induced by TP increased the levels of NADPH and intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Both siRNA knockdown of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a rate-limiting enzyme in PPP, and a G6PD inhibitor, dihydroepiandrosterone, reduced TP-induced ROS production. siRNA downregulation of 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate (DR5P) aldolase, which is needed for DR5P to enter glycolysis, also suppressed the induction of NADPH and IL-8 in TP-expressing cells. These results suggested that TP-mediated thymidine catabolism increases the intracellular NADPH level via the PPP, which enhances the production of ROS by NADPH oxidase and activates its downstream signalling.\n\n© 2018, The Author(s). Salivary polyamines are potential non-invasive tools for screening various types of cancers. For clinical use, the reproducibility of these metabolites should be evaluated under various storage conditions, including duration and temperature, to establish standard operating protocols. Polyamines and amino acids in unstimulated whole saliva were quantified via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Concentrations of time course samples were analysed after short-term storage for up to 240 min and long-term storage for up to 8 days under various storage conditions. As expected, storage at the lowest temperature (−18 °C) exerted the least pronounced effects on the quantified values in both tests. At a higher temperature, polyamines were more stable than amino acids, as evident from polyamine profiling. Addition of ethanol significantly stabilized polyamine profiles even at a higher temperature. Comparative processing of saliva revealed a minor effect of the solvent, whereas drying had a more prominent effect on polyamine profiles. Computational analyses evaluated the ability of polyamines to discriminate pancreatic cancer from controls. Repeated noise added tests were designed on the basis of the results of the storage tests; these analyses confirmed that the discriminative abilities were robust. These data contribute to the standardization of salivary storage conditions, thereby highlighting the clinical utility of saliva.\n\n© 2018, Springer Nature B.V. Metabolomics is often used to comprehensively elucidate the metabolites in organisms like seaweed. Amino acids hydrolysed from proteins and certain targeted metabolites in seaweed have been investigated. However, water-soluble metabolites like free amino acids, organic acids, and sugars have seldom been comprehensively analysed. Metabolomics are valuable tools for these studies, but they require optimisation of pre-treatment methodology. Here, we evaluated various pre-treatment drying and extraction methods for brown seaweed metabolomics. Three edible brown seaweeds (Cladosiphon okamuranus [Mozuku], Saccharina japonica [Kombu], and Undaria pinnatifida [Wakame]) were used. Freeze-drying and oven-drying at both 40 and 80 °C were investigated. Methanol-water extracts with and without chloroform were compared. Metabolites were evaluated and quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. The results showed that metabolite profiling was determined mainly by seaweed species identity rather than pre-treatment method. Freeze-drying yielded higher metabolite concentrations than oven-drying at either 40 or 80 °C. The effects of extraction with and without chloroform on metabolite concentration varied with seaweed species.\n\n© 2018 The Authors Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength and increased risk of fracture. Low bone mass and/or pre-existing bone fragility fractures serve as diagnostic criteria in deciding when to start medication for osteoporosis. Although osteoporosis is a metabolic disorder, metabolic markers to predict reduced bone mass are unknown. Here, we show serum metabolomics profiles of women grouped as pre-menopausal with normal bone mineral density (BMD) (normal estrogen and normal BMD; NN), post-menopausal with normal BMD (low estrogen and normal BMD; LN) or post-menopausal with low BMD (low estrogen and low BMD; LL) using comprehensive metabolomics analysis. To do so, we enrolled healthy volunteer and osteoporosis patient female subjects, surveyed them with a questionnaire, measured their BMD, and then undertook a comprehensive metabolomics analysis of sera of the three groups named above. We identified 24 metabolites whose levels differed significantly between NN/LN and NN/LL groups, as well as 18 or 10 metabolites whose levels differed significantly between NN/LN and LN/LL, or LN/LL and NN/LN groups, respectively. Our data shows metabolomics changes represent useful markers to predict estrogen deficiency and/or bone loss.\n\nCommensal microbiota colonize the surface of our bodies. The inside of the gastrointestinal tract is one such surface that provides a habitat for them. The gastrointestinal tract is a long organ system comprising of various parts, and each part possesses various functions. It has been reported that the composition of intestinal luminal metabolites between the small and large intestine are different; however, comprehensive metabolomic and commensal microbiota profiles specific to each part of the gastrointestinal lumen remain obscure. In this study, by using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS)-based metabolome and 16S rRNA gene-based microbiome analyses of specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) murine gastrointestinal luminal profiles, we observed the different roles of commensal microbiota in each part of the gastrointestinal tract involved in carbohydrate metabolism and nutrient production. We found that the concentrations of most amino acids in the SPF small intestine were higher than those in the GF small intestine. Furthermore, sugar alcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol accumulated only in the GF large intestine, but not in the SPF large intestine. On the other hand, pentoses, such as arabinose and xylose, gradually accumulated from the cecum to the colon only in SPF mice, but were undetected in GF mice. Correlation network analysis between the gastrointestinal microbes and metabolites showed that niacin metabolism might be correlated to Methylobacteriaceae. Collectively, commensal microbiota partially affects the gastrointestinal luminal metabolite composition based on their metabolic dynamics, in cooperation with host digestion and absorption.\n\n© 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A. All Rights Reserved. Antifolates are a class of drugs effective for treating malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The majority of antifolates inhibit enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis such as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GART). In order to select the most suitable patients for effective therapy with drugs targeting specific metabolic pathways, there is a need for better predictive metabolic biomarkers. Antifolates can alter global metabolic pathways in MPM cells, yet the metabolic profile of treated cells has not yet been clearly elucidated. Here we found that MPM cell lines could be categorized into two groups according to their sensitivity or resistance to pemetrexed treatment. We show that pemetrexed susceptibility could be reversed and DNA synthesis rescued in drug-treated cells by the exogenous addition of the nucleotide precursors hypoxanthine and thymidine (HT). We observed that the expression of pemetrexed-targeted enzymes in resistant MPM cells was quantitatively lower than that seen in pemetrexed-sensitive cells. Metabolomic analysis revealed that glycine and choline, which are involved in one-carbon metabolism, were altered after drug treatment in pemetrexed-sensitive but not resistant MPM cells. The addition of HT upregulated the concentration of inosine monophosphate (IMP) in pemetrexed-sensitive MPM cells, indicating that the nucleic acid biosynthesis pathway is important for predicting the efficacy of pemetrexed in MPM cells. Our data provide evidence that may link therapeutic response to the regulation of metabolism, and points to potential biomarkers for informing clinical decisions regarding the most effective therapies for patients with MPM.\n\n© 2018 Journal of Visualized Experiments. Tardigrades are microscopic animals that enter an ametabolic state called anhydrobiosis when facing desiccation and can return to their original state when water is supplied. The genomic sequencing of microscopic animals such as tardigrades risks bacterial contamination that sometimes leads to erroneous interpretations, for example, regarding the extent of horizontal gene transfer in these animals. Here, we provide an ultralow input method to sequence the genome of the tardigrade, Hypsibius dujardini, from a single specimen. By employing rigorous washing and contaminant exclusion along with an efficient extraction of the 50 ~ 200 pg genomic DNA from a single individual, we constructed a library sequenced with a DNA sequencing instrument. These libraries were highly reproducible and unbiased, and an informatics analysis of the sequenced reads with other H. dujardini genomes showed a minimal amount of contamination. This method can be applied to unculturable tardigrades that could not be sequenced using previous methods.\n\n© 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine (I). A-to-I RNA editing targets double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and increases the complexity of gene regulation by modulating base pairing-dependent processes such as splicing, translation, and microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing. This study investigates the genome-wide binding preferences of the nuclear constitutive isoforms ADAR1-p110 and ADAR2 on human miRNA species by RNA immunoprecipitation of ADAR-bound small RNAs (RIP-seq). Our results suggest that secondary structure predicted by base-pairing probability in the mainly double-stranded region of a pre-miRNA or mature miRNA duplex may determine ADAR isoform preference for binding distinct subpopulations of miRNAs. Furthermore, we identify 31 unique editing sites with statistical significance, 19 sites of which are novel editing sites. Editing sites are enriched in the seed region responsible for target recognition by miRNAs, and isoform-specific nucleotide motifs in the immediate vicinity and opposite of editing sites are consistent with previous studies, and further reveal that ADAR2 may edit A/C bulges more frequently than ADAR1-p110 in the context of miRNA.\n\n© The Author(s) 2018.

Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, a cyanobacterium that uses light and carbon dioxide to grow, has a high ability to incorporate DNA by transformation. To assess the effective delivery of large DNA in plasmid form, we cloned the endogenous plasmid pANL (46.4 kbp) into a BAC vector of Escherichia coli. The plasmid p38ANL (54.3 kbp) replaced the native plasmid. To assess the delivery of larger DNA into PCC7942, p38ANL was fused to the broad-host-range conjugal transfer plasmid pUB307IP (53.5 kbp). The resulting plasmid pUB307IP501 (107.9 kbp) was transmitted from E. coli to PCC7942 by simple mixing of donor and recipient cultures. PCC7942 transcipients possessed only pUB307IP501, replacing the preexisting pANL. In contrast, the pUB307IP501 plasmid was unable to transform PCC7942, indicating that natural transformation of DNA may be restricted by size limitations. The ability to deliver large DNA by conjugation may lead to genetic engineering in PCC7942.\n\n© 2018 The Author(s). Background: Circadian rhythms comprise oscillating molecular interactions, the disruption of the homeostasis of which would cause various disorders. To understand this phenomenon systematically, an accurate technique to identify oscillating molecules among omics datasets must be developed; however, this is still impeded by many difficulties, such as experimental noise and attenuated amplitude. Results: To address these issues, we developed a new algorithm named Maximal Information Coefficient-based Oscillation Prediction (MICOP), a sine curve-matching method. The performance of MICOP in labeling oscillation or non-oscillation was compared with four reported methods using Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) values. The numerical experiments were performed with time-series data with (1) mimicking of molecular oscillation decay, (2) high noise and low sampling frequen"
