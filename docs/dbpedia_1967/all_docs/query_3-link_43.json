        "text": "The effects of the reabsorption of radiation on the lifetime of the Cs 72P3/2 level were measured from the decaying waveform of fluorescence under various experimental conditions. Reabsorption does not have any influence on the lifetime when the experimental condition satisfies k0L<1, where k0 is the peak absorption coefficient and L is the reabsorbing path length. A theoretical calculation based on a simple model agrees with the experimental results.\n\nThe time development operator formalism is presented in order to justify the conventional formulas for the cross section of the symmetric charge transfer process. The formulation clarifies the approximations made in the derivation. The cross section for the process U+U+→U+U is examined. Considering the situation that the lower energy states of the uranium atom/ion are made of two kinds of cores, 5f3(4I) and 5f3(2H), with an energy difference of less than 0.1 eV, and that transfer of one of the 7s-electrons contributes to the cross section of charge transfer to about the same extent as that of the 6d-electron, we obtain a theoretical result which agrees with a recent experimental value at 100 eV.\n\nBy using various couples of ferroelectric liquid crystals with molecular structures which were only different in the core center in each couple, the effect of the bond moment C=O at the center of core on ferroelectricity could be studied. The bond moment C=O at the center of the core was found to enhance the spontaneous polarization except for one case.\n\nThe dynamic response of surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystals was studied on the basis of a continuum theory. In this work, polarization electric field was consistently introduced through Poisson's equation, including the polarization charge accompanied by an elastic deformation. An improved anchoring energy consistent with inclined smectic layers relative to the bounding plates is put forward. From numerically calculated results, the polarization current and the hysteresis curves are found to be crucially affected by the inherent chirality and the polarization electric field. Remarkably, it is shown that an increase of the inherent chirality or the negative dielectric anisotropy results in a doubly or a triply peaked polarization switching current under an alternating external field.\n\nThreshold characteristics were measured of a cell consisting of a compound which shows a large tilt angle of 35° and possesses bistability in cells thicker than 4 µm. A value, which represents the sharpness of the threshold, Vsat(max)/Vth(min), of 2.5 was obtained at T-Tc=-20°C. The optical responses to two kinds of voltage waveform applications were also measured. The introduction of zero voltage periods improved the bistability and, consequently, made it possible to drive matrix displays.\n\nTemporal changes of the molecular alignments on nematic liquid crystals are considered dynamically on the basis of experimental results, computer simulations of conoscopic figures and the Voigt model in viscoelastic theory. By assuming the molecular alignments of liquid crystals to follow the modified trapezoidal approximation model, the conoscopic figures obtained from the computer simulations agree semi-quantitatively with those from the experiments. It becomes clear from the Voigt model that the sharpness of isogyre of the conoscopic figures depends on the number of aligned thin molecular layers corresponding to the applied voltage; this is reconfirmed from computer simulations of the conoscopic figures.\n\nThe effect of hydrogen dilution of a source gas, SiH4, on structural inhomogeneity has been studied for hydrogenated amorphous silicon films prepared under the mode involving a high deposition rate by the substrate impedance tuning technique. As the silane fraction decreases from 100% to 1% with hydrogen dilution, the SiH bonding configuration gradually changes into the dihydride (SiH2) group; finally, the films become microcrystalline. On the other hand, the state density in the mid gap and the spin density, related to the structural disorder, have minima at silane fractions of 100% and 10%. These results seem to be consistent with a two-phase model suggested for high rate films, with an emphasis on a different medium range disorder between the films prepared at high and low deposition rates.\n\nSilicon nitride films containing various amounts of Si or O atoms were prepared by controlling the operation parameters of the plasma-chemical vapor deposition in N2-diluted silane mixed with H2-diluted silane or with O2 under various mixing ratios. By this method, the refractive indices of silicon nitride films could be varied over a wide range. The refractive index of films containing oxygen atoms gradually changed through oxygenation; however, oxygen-free plasma-deposited silicon nitride (P-SiN) films containing various amounts of Si atoms were very stable. The spectral response of the reflectance was measured for the latter Si-rich P-SiN films in order to determine the appropriate conditions as antireflective coatings for P/N single crystal Si solar cells. As a result, Si-rich P-SiN antireflective films improved the conversion efficiency of Si solar cells by 40 to 50 or by 50 to 70%, depending on whether a single-layer or double-layer coating, respectively, was used.\n\nEpitaxial GaAs layers have been grown on (100) oriented Ge/Si substrates by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. Double-crystal X-ray diffraction shows that the full width at half maximum of the (400) reflection obtained from 3 µm-thick GaAs is as small as 114 arc seconds. The GaAs surface dislocation density estimated by a molten KOH study is 4.9×106 cm-2. Photoluminescence measurements show that an excitonic transition at 1.4852 eV dominates at 4.2 K. These results suggest that Ge/Si substrates are suitable for growing sufficiently high quality GaAs layers.\n\nCrystal defects in ferroelectric Ca2Sr(C2H5CO2)6 have been studied in detail by light-scattering tomography. Most of the crystal defects observed have been found to be the plane type parallel to the {101} or the {110} planes. The shape of the {101} plane type defects is fundamentally a hexagon which satisfies \"the law of constancy of facial angles.\" The formation mechanism of the plane type defects is studied and discussed.\n\nSingle crystals of PbCl2 doped with Mn2+ have been investigated by ESR at X band and room temperature. The Mn2+ ion is found to be replaced for the Pb2+ ion. The spectrum can be described by a spin Hamiltonian for an ion in an orthorhombic crystal field. The parameters are found to be gz=1.9996±0.0002, gy=2.0004±0.0002, gx=2.003±0.001, D=-495.9±0.1 G, E=-137.0±0.1 G, Az=-84.8±0.2 G, Ay=-85.2±0.2 G, Ax=-85.2±0.5 G, a∼0 G and F∼0 G. The hyperfine structure splitting depends on the angle θ between the static magnetic field H and the z axis. the linear relation between the hyperfine constant A and the ionicity of the lattice holds even in PbCl2. The experimental angular variation of intensities is in good agreement with the calculation by numerical diagonalization. The measured intensity is asymmetric about the nuclear quantum number m=0.\n\nPolarization modulation infrared spectroscopy has been successfully applied for in situ observations of a-Si:H films growing under photo-chemical vapor deposition conditions. The thin films exhibited absorption bands arising from SiH3 or SiH2 species, depending upon the substrate temperature. Whereas the mass thickness of the film deposited at 293 K increased in proportion to the deposition time, the IR absorption intensity of SiH3 species decreased in rate when the film grew beyond 15 Å in thickness, showing that the concentration of the SiH3 species becomes reduced with the deposition time. Although the band ascribable to the Si-O stretching vibration could not be observed during the deposition, it grew when the film was exposed to air. This fact suggests that the origin of the oxygen incorporated in the film is mainly atmospheric oxidizing agents.\n\nTaOx film formation by a photo-CVD method using TaCl5 as a source material is examined. The deposition rate increases with increasing growth temperature and decreasing chamber pressure down to 1 Torr. The leakage current of the formed TaOx film decreases drastically with annealing in the presence of both UV-irradiation and an oxygen ambient after deposition (p-O2 annealing), when the underlying layer contains Si. The leakage current density is 10-8 A/cm2 at the 4 MV/cm electric field. The dielectric constant for MIS structure capacitors decreases with decreasing TaOx thickness, but does not decrease much with p-O2 annealing. In addition, the mechanisms of reduction of the leakage current with p-O2 annealing are discussed.\n\nThe effects of annealing on the distributions of interface states at the I-S interface were investigated by analyzing the C-V characteristics of as-grown and annealed Al2O3/native oxide/InP MIS capacitors using a self-consistent computer simulation program. It is shown that interface states form a continuum of donor-like and acceptor-like states continuously distributed both in energy and in space. The state density distribution before and after annealing maintains the same functional form, which is U-shaped in energy and exponentially decaying in space. The charge neutrality point dividing donor-like and acceptor-like states occurs at the U-shaped minimum. Annealing reduces the spatial extension of states, the U-shape curvature and the magnitude of density. However, the energy position of the charge neutrality point remains remarkably invariant.\n\nBy developing a new method of Fourier analysis the local cation and anion displacements in a superlattice, especially near the hetero-interface boundary between the GaAs and the AlAs, were determined from the X-ray integrated intensities of the satellite reflections observed around the two fundamental Bragg reflections, namely the 002 and 004 reflections. The interlayer distance of successive cation layers was found to be 2.827 Å in the GaAs region and 2.835 Å in the AlAs region, except near the hetero-interface boundary. The anion layers are, therefore, located at the mid-point between the cation layers in these regions. However, near the hetero-interface region, which consists of eight molecular layers, anion layers are not located at the mid-point between them but are slightly shifted to the GaAs side. The value of the shift at the boundary between GaAs and AlAs was 0.016 Å.\n\nInfrared (IR) absorption measurements, hydrogen evolution experiments and ESR measurements have been carried out in order to study the thermal stability of hydrogen, bond configuration and defect structure in silicon nitride films (SiN) prepared by an ECR plasma CVD method and in part by a conventional plasma CVD method. It is shown that the SiN films deposited at high microwave powers in which the bond configuration of N-H is predominant are thermally very stable, even after annealing at 900 °C in a dry N2 atmosphere. The IR spectra scarcely vary before and after the annealing. The hydrogen evolution from SiN films was found to be highly dependent upon the deposition conditions and deposition methods. The amount of hydrogen evolved after experiments up to 900 °C becomes less as the microwave power increases. The temperature at which hydrogen evolution starts to take place for SiN films deposited by the ECR plasma CVD method is generally higher than that for the P-CVD method, except for ECR SiN films deposited at high gas pressure. ESR measurements revealed that the hydrogen concentration in SiN films has little influence on the spin density.\n\nThe microstructure of a thin SnO2 film prepared by pyrohydrolytic decomposition onto a glass substrate was studied by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) of cross-sectional specimens, and the findings were correlated with the low resistivity shown by this material when employed as a transparent electrode. The thin film was found to consist of three regions: a region which showed reaction with the glass substrate, a non-oriented polycrystalline region and an oriented columnar polycrystalline region showing a crystallographic shear (CS) structure which was thought to contribute to the low resistivity.\n\nThe impulse response characteristics of polymer ultrasonic transducers were analyzed using the Mason's equivalent circuit. These characteristics strongly depend on material factors of the piezoelectric polymer: the dielectric and mechanical internal loss factors, the electromechanical coupling factor and the acoustic impedance. Based on the analytical results, we evaluated the piezoelectric polymers that are presently available as transducing materials. The analytical results were verified experimentally using transducers composed of poly(vinylidene-fluoride) film and vinylidene fluoride and trifluoroethylene copolymer film.\n\nA wide-band polymer ultrasonic transducer having acoustic impedance matching layers is proposed. In this transducer, a polystyrene or polypropylene matching layer is bonded onto the front surface of a piezoelectric film of vinylidenefluoride and trifluoroethylene copolymer (P(VDF-TrFE)). The matching layer, λ/4 thick, is most effective for obtaining a wider-band frequency response and sharper impulse response operating in water. Analytical and experimental results proved that the matching layer brings about a depth resolution 1.7 times higher than that of a conventional P(VDF-TrFE) transducer without any reduction in sensitivity. A medical ultrasonic image taken with the new transducer shows its usefulness for practical applications.\n\nHall-effect measurements of F-doped polycrystalline SnO2 thin films have been performed in the temperature range from 4.2 to 300 K with samples having different sizes of grains involved in the material. The carrier concentration and mobility have been analyzed in terms of the transport mechanism in a degenerate semiconductor. From a comparison between the calculated and experimental carrier concentration, we have obtained the results that the effective mass of electrons is 0.935 m0 and that the position of the Fermi level in the conduction band varies from 0.269 to 0.224 eV for a change in the carrier concentration from 5.70 to 4.31 (× 1020 cm-3). Based on an analysis of the Hall mobility, it has been found that scattering by neutral and ionized impurities dominates the mobility and that both the impurities are localized at grain boundaries involved in polycrystalline SnO2 films.\n\nIt is shown that one can estimate the broadening parameters of both the capture cross section σ and the activation energy E of a deep level from the emission rate spectrum S(λ, T) of the transient capacitance ΔC(t, T) obtained in a spectral analysis of the DLTS(SADLTS) proposed in our previous paper. Numerical examples are given to illustrate typical cases of interest for an idealized model of independent Gaussian distributions, f(σ) and g(E). In general, S(λ, T) is a convolution of f and g with its higher and lower λ side characterized by broadening parameters for σ and E, respectively. A simple formula is derived in order to obtain the central value E of the activation energy.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations of hot electron transport in AlGaAs/GaAs /AlGaAs quantum wells were carried out in order to clarify the drift velocity overshoot and steady state drift velocity versus the electric-field relation. In the simulations, we took into account the nonparabolic isotropic energy band structures. Results are given for GaAs well widths of 500 and 100 Å and an electron sheet density of 1.0×1012 cm-2 at 77 K. The drift-velocity overshoot reaches about 7×107 cm/s at an electric field of 10 kV/cm in both quantum well structures. A negative differential mobility appears beyond 3 kV/cm in both structures due to electron transfer from the Γ valley to the L valleys.\n\nThis paper reports some experimental results concerning the tree initiation from a semiconductive needle electrode in polyethylene under a 50 Hz AC voltage. With a newly developed measuring system, the correspondence between partial discharge pulses and tree initiation and growth up to 10-20 µm in length was clarified for the first time. Tree observation and pulse measurement were made simultaneously. At the moment of tree initiation, positive pulses (current from the needle towards the grounding electrode) of 0.05-0.1 pC were first observed. A very small shade of the initial tree was observed when continuous positive pulses appeared; it grew rapidly to about 10 µm in length, along with the positive and negative pulses. After the tree branched, the growth rate dropped for a while. In many cases, the negative pulses disappeared during this stage.\n\nThe orthorhombic and tetragonal phase relation, i.e. the order-disorder phase transformation in YBa2Cu3O6+x, has been studied by employing statistical thermodynamics, and the equilibrium value of order parameter -1≦s≦1 has been determined as a function of the temperature and oxygen concentration. In the above-mentioned treatment, plus and minus signs of s in the ordered state (|s|≠0) are found to describe the degree of order in the twin related crystals. The calculated properties are compared with the experimental data, i.e. the temperature dependence of oxygen occupancy at a constant oxygen pressure and the concentration dependence of axial lengths, a and b, at room temperature. The agreement is excellent for both cases when the axial lengths at room temperature are measured for the samples with oxygen removed or doped at low temperatures. The statistical thermodynamical expression for further ordering has also been derived.\n\nThe photoluminescence in undoped KTaO3 crystal has been measured under static electric fields at 49 K. When a voltage is applied to the crystal, the intensity of the blue emission band decreases, and the emission spectrum becomes a yellow emission band. It is shown that these effects are caused by an increase of the temperature in KTaO3 as a result of Joule heating.\n\nThe photoluminescent characteristics of MOCVD-prepared ZnS:TbFx films are highly dependent on x, while the eletroluminescent characteristics are independent of x. For photoluminescence excitation at 330 nm, which is indirect excitation from the ZnS host to the Tb center, the photoluminescent intensity increases rapidly with a decrease in x, while for the photoluminescence excitation at 377 nm, which is a direct excitation of the Tb center, the photoluminescent intensity is independent of x. On the other hand, the electroluminescent intensity of devices prepared using these films is almost independent of x. The difference in the site of the F ion between MOCVD- and sputtering-prepared films is discussed as well as the excitation mechanism for photoluminescence and electroluminescence.\n\nCharacteristics of ZnS:Mn films prepared by an rf sputtering method for electroluminescent devices were examined in detail; the features were clarified by a comparison with films produced by an electron-beam method. It was found that the incident species to the substrate during sputtering were composed of ZnS, Zn2, Zn2S, MnS and ZnMn in addition to Zn and S atoms; in the case of the electron-beam method, they were composed of Zn and S2. We confirmed that preparative, crystallographic, microstructural , chemical, and eventually electroluminescent characteristics in sputtered ZnS:Mn films were different from those in electron-beam films, according to the fundamental difference of the incident species to the substrate, which affected film growth.\n\nThe hard magnetic material with a maximum iHc of about 30 kOe was obtained by crystallizing Nd-Fe-B alloys from the amorphous phase. The hard magnetic properties are considered to be due to single domain behaviors of the Nd2Fe14B fine grains, which are precipitated by annealing at 600-800°C for less than 3 min. When the specimens are further crystallized, Nd2Fe17 or α-Fe appears at the expense of the region of Nd2Fe14B phase.\n\nThe hollow cathode He-Cd+ white-light laser simultaneously oscillates at three primary colors of light (red, green, and blue) in the visual range. The red output has wavelengths of 636.0 nm and 635.5 nm; the green output has wavelengths of 537.8 nm and 533.7 nm; and the blue output has a wavelength of 441.6 nm. The authors measured the small signal gains of these five wavelengths using an amplifier method. The three color outputs radiated from the oscillator tube were directed into an amplifier tube in order to measure the dependence of the gain coefficient on the anode current and the He pressure for each wavelength.\n\nLongitudinal mode competition in transverse-mode-controlled laser diodes has been experimentally investigated. A careful examination of the output power change associated with both random mode switching and hysteretic mode jumping has revealed a peculiar feature of mode competition in laser diodes; in most devices, the output power is decreased as the lasing mode jumps from a shorter to a longer wavelength mode, which it is increased at mode jumping toward shorter wavelengths. The peculiar feature has been interpreted in terms of an asymmetry in gain saturation, which was experimentally observed. A terminal voltage change associated with mode jumping has also been measured. In some devices, a small shift of the beam profile was observed at mode jumping.\n\nGain saturation in semiconductor lasers is analyzed using a density matrix formalism. A refined treatment of the density matrix formalism reveals that nonlinear gain has a component which is asymmetric with respect to the lasing frequency. The asymmetric component originates from refractive-index modulation due to a carrier-density pulsation induced by the optical-intensity beat. Based on the analysis, mode competition behavior is numerically examined using appropriate values of the linewidth enhancement factor and the intraband relaxation time. It is shown that the output power decreases at mode jumping from a shorter to a longer wavelength mode while it increases at mode jumping toward shorter wavelengths. The results agree with the features of the mode competition behavior observed in transverse-mode-controlled AlGaAs lasers.\n\nThe fluorescence spectra have been measured for various colours used for Japanese painting in order to identify the pigments in paintings. Fluorescence was observed in various natural and synthetic colours. The fluorescence intensities of these colours are generally weaker than those of oil colours.\n\nThis paper presents experimental results concerning the population of the 21S atom of HeI in a discharge plasma of a He+Xe gas mixture. The population measurement was made by the laser-induced fluorescence method with the laser light tuned to the HeI line of 5016 A(21S-31P). The fluorescence intensity of the HeI line was measured as a function of the discharge current at pressures ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 Torr, and the behavior of the fluorescence intensity was clarified in terms of the measured electron density. In the Xe-mixed gas, the fluorescence intensity was significantly reduced in the region of low electron density; this region extended to a higher electron density as the Xe gas content was increased. Thus, it was concluded that the population of the 21S state was dominated by Penning collisions with Xe atoms at low electron density.\n\nThe possibility of an instantaneous determination of the Balmer alpha (Hα) line profile of hydrogen atoms in large plasma devices by rapid-frequency-scan (RAFS) laser spectroscopy is discussed. A detailed analysis of the SN ratio shows that, although the SN ratio in Hα line profile measurements by RAFS is smaller than those in neutral hydrogen density measurements, a remarkable improvement can be obtained by the choice of the optimum saturation parameter and the long-pulse operation. Based on the experiment of the Hα profile measurement in a hydrogen DC glow discharge plasma by RAFS, the profile distortion in saturated excitation is evaluated. The SN ratio in the profile measurement by RAFS for Heliotron E plasma is estimated from the data on the neutral density measurement.\n\nThe nonrandomness in atom arrangement has been estimated for III-V quaternary alloys of (ABC)D type through a thermodynamical analysis. As in ternary alloys, the strain energy is considered to be the mixing enthalpy. Calculations were carried out for (InGaAl)As and Ga(SbAsP), and the results are represented in terms of short-range order parameters of second-nearest pairs. The number of pairs increases compared with a random arrangement if composed of larger and smaller atoms than the average; however, the number of pairs of larger or smaller atoms decreases. When the lattice constant of a constituent binary compound coincides with that of an alloy, there appears in the alloy a preference for compound clustering. The results are compared with those for ternary alloys.\n\nSingle crystals of NaxTiO2 were prepared up to x=0.007 by heating single-crystalline TiO2 in Na vapor at 700°C or below. The electrical property of NaxTiO2 below the room temperature, down to 4.2 K, could be explained on the basis of the metal-insulator transition model for doped semiconductors. No essential differences were observed in the electrical properties between NaxTiO2 and reduced rutile (TiO2-y) when the doping level was low (x=0.004). However, there was a significant difference between them in the case of heavy doping, i.e., the conductivity in the lowest temperature region was much higher in NaxTiO2 than in reduced rutile. This indicates that the donor level in NaxTiO2 remains shallow while that in reduced rutile becomes deeper in the heavily-doped region.\n\nA new self-aligned recess metal contact process utilizing photo-CVD SiN as a side-wall between the gate metal and the n+ source region has been accomplished for recessed gate GaAs MESFETs with a single lithographic procedure. The process achieves excellent transconductance, Gm, of 190∼240 mS/mm for a gate length, Lg, of 1.2 µm with keeping the source-gate breakdown voltage as high as 7-14 V.\n\nThe emission of neutral iron atoms from a metal target in the shadow of the limiter was investigated during ICRF heating of the TEXTOR plasma, using laser induced fluorescence. By collecting the data over many similar sawtooth periods, the sawtooth oscillation of the neutral iron density was found for first time. The sawtooh oscillation of the netral iron density occurring during additional heating was in reverse phase to the neutral oxygen flux from the main limiter, but in phase with the central electron temperature. On the other hand, another case which was in contrast to the above case was found. The incident ion on the metal surface was studied.\n\nDecarbonization rates were measured by the use of ECR plasmas of H2 or O2. The rates are 2.0×1016 m-2s-1 for H2 and 2.4×1018 m-2s-1 for O2 at the same pressure of 1.6×10-2 Pa. The rate for O2 is two orders of magnitude higher than that for H2. These results are analyzed depending on the equilibrium theory and the processing of decarbonization can be explained.\n\nThe optical constants of Pt, Ag, and Cu in the soft X-ray region (100-1200 eV) derived from the reflectance method are reported. Samples were thickly deposited on substrates so that interference effects would be negligible. Using Debye-Waller and constant factors we could explain the angular dependence of the specular reflection of the soft X-rays from conventionally-evaporated mirrors.\n\nWe report here on the characteristics of a CCD for optical use in the several keV region. The CCD we used was an interline-transfer type device. We took X-ray images at energies of about 8 and 1.5 keV for various objects. We found that this device could yield sufficient information for a two-dimensional image. The spatial resolution is up to the individual pixel size(23×27 µm). The efficiency for X-rays is much superior to that of film. We measured the pulse-height distribution of X-rays in a photon-counting mode. We obtained a linear relation between the incident photon energy and the pulse height, while the energy resolution was kept constant. The effective depth of the depletion layer of this device was calculated as being about 3 µm from these measurements. We discuss the problems which must be faced in fabricating the CCD for X-ray use.\n\nCounterpropagating strong electromagnetic radiation is interesting as a short-period \"optical undulator\". This work presents a basic discussion concerning the requirement for electron beam quality in an optical undulator FEL. In the Compton and cold electron beam regime, the emittance ε of the electron beam is limited to be γε<0.16\\frac{(1+K^{2} / 2)^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{N}K}λU at the beam waist of the optical undulator of which the field is produced by focusing electromagnetic radiation such as a high-power molecular laser. Further discussion suggests that a high-quality, long-pulsed electron beam from UCSB's accelerator might promise FEL operation in the ultraviolet or shorter wavelength regions using a high-power CO2 laser undulator.\n\nWe decouple the N-soliton solution for the Volterra and Volterra-like circuit equation to the linear superposition of N single soliton solutions. For this purpose, we combine Hirota and Satsuma's result and Yoneyama's result and find expressions for decoupled single solitons. We also find explicit expressions for the decoupled 2-soliton solutions for the Volterra-like circuit equation and examine their behavior.\n\nThe crystal structure of Pd5La was analyzed be powder X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, and it was found that Pd5La is almost isomorphic with H-Pd5Ce. The electrical resistivity was examined for Pd5La, H-Pd5Ce and L-Pd5Ce in the range between 77 K and 300 K. The temperature dependence of resistivity suggested that H-Pd5Ce and L-Pd5Ce have a dense Kondo state.\n\nA new oxidation method for GaSb that utilized a high energy electron-beam was investigated. The grown oxide layer was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The oxidized Sb was distributed throughout the oxide layer and there was less pile-up of elemental Sb concentration at the oxide-semiconductor interface.\n\nA method is proposed to determine the capture cross-section of majority carriers from a change in the capacitance due to trap filling without any influence of slow capture in the depletion edge region. The difference in the capacitance under two bias conditions is measured by microcomputer-based isothermal capacitance transient spectroscopy. The capture cross-section of an electron on Au-acceptor level in Si is obtained to verify this method.\n\nIt is shown that in elemental superconductors, there exists some degree of correlation between transition temperature Tc and work function φ. The Tc-φ curve exhibits an oscillatory behavior. For both transition and nontransition elements, an optimum condition for Tc occurs at φ=4.0 eV. To determine if this rule is available for new high-Tc oxides, systematic studies for determination of their φ values are required.\n\nThe current transport mechanism of the SOGICON-type Ge device is studied. Current-voltage characteristics were measured by applying pulsed voltage. As the voltage was increased, there appeared first a sublinear region in the currentvoltage characteristics, and then current oscillation. From the present experiments, it was verified that the appearance of the sublinear region is ascribed to the generation of the hot carriers.\n\nMethods for the (1) determination of the electron temperature by differentiation of the probe curve, (2) detection of a non-Maxwellian energy distribution and plasma inhomogeneity, (3) rapid measurement of the electron temperature by voltage modulation, and (4) measurement of the space potential are developed.\n\nThe electrification of a polymer powder transported though U-bend pipes was studied at particle speeds of ν=17.6 m/s and 26.4 m/s, and a solid load p=0.017 kg / m3. The charge / mass ratio, q, of powder passing through the U-bend pipes (seven different radii of curvature) depended on the flow pattern of the powder particles after their first collision with the inner wall of the bend of the pipe."
