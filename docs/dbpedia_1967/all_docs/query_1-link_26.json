        "meta_description": "Background Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) develops in various underlying pulmonary conditions. There is scarce data evaluating interstitial lung disease (ILD)/abnormalities (ILA) as such conditions, and it has not been explored much whether non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) is a prognostic factor for mortality in CPA patients. Few reports had investigated prognostic factors of CPA including underlying pulmonary conditions.   Objectives To explore prognostic factors of CPA including pulmonary conditions.   Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 264 CPA patients from a center for pulmonary aspergillosis in Japan.   Results Survival rates were 78.7%, 61.0%, and 47.4% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Of 264 patients, 53 (20.1%) and 87 (33.1%) were complicated with ILA and NTM-PD. Several independent prognostic factors were identified by multivariate Cox proportional analysis: ILA (HR 1.76, 95%CI 1.06–2.92, p = 0.029), age (1.05, 1.02–1.08, p<0.001), male sex (2.48, 1.34–4.59, p = 0.004), body mass index of <18.5 kg/m2 (1,87, 1.20–2.90, p = 0.005), presence of aspergilloma (1.59, 1.04–2.45, p = 0.033), and lower serum albumin (0.56, 0.38–0.83, p = 0.004). NTM-PD was not associated with higher mortality (0.85, 0.52–1.38, p = 0.51).   Conclusions The poor prognosis of CPA and several prognostic factors were revealed. Early diagnosis and intervention is required with reference to such factors.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nWe presented the results from a prognostic analysis of 264 patients from an experienced single center in Japan regarding pulmonary aspergillosis. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates for the 264 patients were 78.7%, 61.0%, and 47.4%, respectively. Compared to the largest retrospective cohort of 387 CPA patients from the UK [8], which showed 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 86%, 75%, and 62%, respectively, the survival rates in this cohort were lower. But the second largest prognosis cohort of 194 CPA patients from Japan presented 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 80%, 67%, and 49% respectively [5], which were similar to our study. The mean age was 59.4 years in the UK study, while in the previous Japanese study and our study the ages were 68.5 and 71.0 years, which may account for the discrepancy in the results.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the most common underlying pulmonary condition was previous pulmonary tuberculosis (59.1%), and ILA were found in about 20% of CPA patients. There were regional differences of underlying pulmonary conditions in CPA patients: the most common condition was previous tuberculosis in Asian countries including Japan, but in contrast, that was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in European countries. Curiously, sarcoidosis or allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis were seldom reported from Asia. The high prevalence rate of previous tuberculosis in our cohort reflects that Japan had a high incidence rate of tuberculosis after World War Ⅱ, and is still a tuberculosis middle-burden country, with a notification rate of 13.3 cases per 100000 population in 2017 [23]. Even though previous reports showed 2–17% complicated-ILD in CPA patients [3, 5, 6, 11, 12], a few reports have pointed out that ILA/ILD can be a potential predisposition for the development of CPA, most of which were from Japan [5, 24]. In the present study, one or more aspergillomas, namely solid evidence of CPA, were found in cysts related to ILA in 60% of ILA-complicated cases. It is very interesting to consider whether this phenomenon is unique to Japan.\n\nWe found that underlying ILA was associated with poor prognosis, which remained significant even in multivariate analysis. In the previous cohort of 194 patients from Japan [5], 32 patients (16.5%) were complicated with ILD, and those with ILD had a significantly poorer prognosis than with previous tuberculosis (the most common group). Although this result and ours seemed natural in consideration of the poor prognosis of patients with ILD, the high prevalence rate of ILA/ILD is notable, and it is still important to pay more attention to hidden aspergilloma in case of ILA/ILD because it is likely to be overlooked. The effect of complicating CPA on the prognosis of patients with ILD has rarely been explored, but there is a retrospective cohort of 539 patients with ILD which reported that 15 (2.9%) patients developed CPA in 44.0±37.8 months, and that in the CPA-complicated group, the rates of deaths, emphysema, and home oxygen therapy (HOT) usage were significantly higher [24]. Further studies about the complication of CPA and ILA/ILD, should examine whether complicating CPA has a negative impact on the prognosis of patients with ILA/ILD.\n\nNTM-PD was detected in one third of the patients and not associated with a poorer prognosis for CPA patients even though about 40% of CPA patients with NTM-PD were not under CPA treatment. This corresponded to the prior report comparing the co-infection group (CPA with NTM) with the CPA without NTM group, which showed that there were no significant differences in cumulative survival rate between the groups (by log-rank test, p = 0.76) and that the rate of CPA treatment initiation in the co-infection group was significantly lower than in the CPA without NTM group (33.3% vs. 84.4%, p = 0.006) [15]. Co-infection of those infectious diseases have several problems. One noteworthy challenge is that treating both infections is often troublesome due to the interaction of antimicrobial agents. When the treatment of both infections is difficult for some reason, which treatment should be given priority may depend on the activity of NTM and CPA (possibly reflected as sputum culture status or anti-Aspergillus antibody titer [25, 26]), and also the etiologic organism of NTM. Even though the prognostic value of the etiologic NTM organism on NTM-complicated CPA patients has rarely been investigated, a recent cohort of 1,445 NTM patients from Korea reported that etiologic NTM organisms were significantly correlated with mortality: compared to M. avium, M. intracellulare (adjusted HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.03–1.91), M. abscessus (2.19, 1.36–3.51), and M. massiliense (0.99, 0.61–1.64) [13]. The etiologic NTM organism is also likely to be associated with mortality of NTM-complicated CPA patients, although this did not reach statistical significance in our analysis. Contrary to our results, in a previously noted cohort of 384 CPA patients from the UK [8], where about 10% of patients had NTM, underlying NTM-PD was an independent prognostic factor (adjusted HR2.07, 95%CI 1.22–3.52. Details of the etiologic organism of NTM infection were not described). In consideration of regional differences in NTM etiologic organisms [27] and possible effects of NTM etiologic organisms on CPA prognosis, the differences may be due to variations in etiologic NTM organisms. We frequently perform a sputum test for NTM-suspected patients and can easily perform an anti-Aspergillus antibody at our hospital, so it is also possible that we picked up more stable CPA patients with NTM-PD when considering the difference in the ratio of NTM-complicated patients. (33% vs. 10%) Complication of CPA and NTM should be surveyed further focusing on the etiologic NTM organisms and the activities of both infections.\n\nIn this analysis, multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling showed that older age, male sex, BMI of <18.5 kg/m2, serum albumin, and the presence of aspergilloma to be negative prognostic factors. Although not previously reported, male sex was an independent prognostic factor for CPA. We have no explanation for why males would die more frequently than females, although this association has also been noted for pulmonary tuberculosis [28] and also NTM [13, 29, 30]. Our results also confirmed previous findings that BMI of <18.5 kg/m2 [6, 11], lower serum albumin [8], and the presence of aspergilloma [8], were independent risk factors for mortality.\n\nThere are some limitations to the present study. First, a certain number of patients did not receive antifungal treatments for various reasons and the choice of antifungal treatment and its duration were dependent on attending physicians. There was however no difference in survival rates between treated and untreated patients, which implies that those untreated had mild disease or the priority was on other conditions like NTM. Second, we could not analyze causes of death due to incomplete data and difficulty in judging such causes. Especially, we were very interested in the causes of death in CPA patients complicated with ILA, but in many cases it was difficult to identify the causes because both CPA and ILA gradually got worse. Finally, we could assess only seven categories we adopted as underlying pulmonary conditions of CPA. But in consideration of the regional differences of the underlying pulmonary conditions, it is impossible to compare all the possibilities at the same time."
