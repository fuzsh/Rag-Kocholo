        "text": "Introduction\n\nNontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) is ubiquitous in the environment, frequently isolated from water and soil [1, 2]. Thus, most NTM organisms detected from human samples have been considered as colonization or contamination. However, NTM can cause diseases, such as lung infections, lymphadenopathy, skin and soft tissue infections, and disseminated disease, in immunocompromised patients [3, 4, 5]. Since the guidelines on pulmonary NTM were pronounced by the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) [6], the prevalence of NTM infection has been reported worldwide [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The estimated incidence rate in Japan has increased from 1.5 per 100,000 in 1985 to 14.7 per 100,000 in 2014 [12]. The 3 most common pulmonary pathogen groups are Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. kansasii, and M. abscessus complex in Japan [13].\n\nWhile bronchopulmonary infection is one of the most common pathologies with NTM, NTM infection of the pleural space is rare in contrast to tuberculosis. Some studies reported cases of disseminated M. avium complex complicated by NTM pleuritis in immunocompromised patients [14, 15], and other cases of NTM pleuritis were reported in immunocompetent cases [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In the previous studies, the frequency of pleural effusion in patients with NTM infection was reported to be 3.4–6% [23, 24], although those reports did not state whether mycobacterial organisms were isolated from the pleural effusion.\n\nOnly a few studies in the literature have reported on the pathogenesis, clinical course, or prognosis of NTM pleuritis, concluding that the mortality was as high as 37–66% at 1 year [25, 26]. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical characteristics and prognosis of NTM pleuritis complicating pulmonary NTM disease.\n\nDiscussion\n\nNTM pleuritis is an uncommon condition that has been reported in immunocompromised hosts [14, 15]. As the prevalence of NTM infection has been increasingly reported worldwide, the number of case reports on NTM pleuritis has increased. Kobashi et al. [26] revealed that pneumothorax occurred in 4.1% of NTM patients and NTM pleuritis arose secondarily in one-third of the pneumothorax cases. Ichiki et al. [23] reported that the frequency of pleural effusion in patients with pulmonary NTM was 3.4%. In our report, 1.4% of cases with pulmonary NTM developed pleuritis with NTM isolated from pleural effusion. The most common pathogen of the pleuritis was M. avium, followed by M. kansasii and M. intracellulare, similar to previous reports [25]. There were 2 cases of NTM pleuritis coexisting with another bacterial infection. Although these cases fulfilled our criteria of NTM pleuritis, NTM in the pleural effusion may not have pathogenic significance because these patients improved with only antibacterial therapy. Most of our cases revealed a high leukocyte count with a low percentage of lymphocytes and elevated ADA levels in the pleural effusion, which was similar to previous reports [23, 25].\n\nAlthough unclear, the pathogenesis of NTM pleuritis has been considered to be similar to that of tuberculous pleuritis, reported to develop due to leakage or rupture of a subpleural focus, extension of infection from the thoracic lymph nodes, or hematogenous spread [30]. NTM pleuritis may occur via lymphogenous or hematogenous spread in an immunocompromised situation, such as in case of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [14, 15] or advanced cancers. However, since NTM is usually less virulent than M. tuberculosis, in most cases, the mechanism of NTM pleuritis was primarily suspected to be the perforation of pulmonary NTM disease or spread of inflammation to the pleura [16, 18, 19, 22, 31, 32]. Our study revealed that 73% of cases had subpleural cavitation, and most cases were considered to present bronchopleural fistula or pneumothorax according to the radiological findings. This result supports that NTM pleuritis developed with leakage or perforation of pulmonary NTM disease.\n\nThe onset of NTM pleuritis after pulmonary NTM has not been previously reported. Kobashi et al. [26] reported that 7 of 9 cases (67%) were diagnosed with pneumothorax within 1 year after pulmonary NTM. This study revealed that 47% of NTM pleuritis cases occurred within 1 year after the diagnosis of pulmonary NTM, and 27% of patients were diagnosed simultaneously. Although lung lesions preexisted in 11 cases of pleuritis, 6 of them had not been treated with chemotherapy. Treating pulmonary NTM at an early stage can prevent the progression of NTM, such as formation of cavitation, parenchymal destruction, or extension of inflammation to the pleura and development of NTM pleuritis.\n\nThe mortality of the pleuritis patients with NTM isolated from pleural effusion was reported as 37–66% at 1 year [25, 26]. A recent report by Park et al. [31] demonstrated that the mortality from NTM pleuritis was 14.3% during a median of 37.4 months of follow-up. They also emphasized the importance of immediate therapy using a multidisciplinary approach against NTM pleuritis. In this study, the mortality rate of follow-up patients was 17% (2 of 12 cases) at 1 year and 25% (3 of 12 cases) during a mean of 1.8 years of follow-up, which was comparable or better than in the previous studies [25, 26, 31]. Because our cases were younger and had a better performance status than those in the previous studies, drainage and surgical approach could be performed more vigorously, which might have led to a better prognosis of NTM pleuritis.\n\nThe current study has several limitations. First, this study was a retrospective analysis of patients from a single institution. The therapeutic regimen or decisions varied depending on the patients' conditions and the clinical experience of the attending physicians. Second, in this retrospective study, the cause of death was based on clinical records of the attending physicians. Although we defined that 2 patients died from NTM pleuritis and 1 patient from other than NTM infection, the precise causes of death could not be verified in the absence of an autopsy. Third, since NTM pleuritis is a rare condition, the number of patients examined in our study is small. This is a case series study and did not include a control group for statistical analysis. Further studies with a much larger number of cases are required to confirm our results.\n\nIn conclusion, NTM pleuritis was difficult to treat by medication alone, and the prognosis was poor. In addition to antimycobacterial medications, surgical procedures in the early stages should be considered to treat NTM pleuritis."
