        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nAn event is a real-world occurrence that takes place in a specific location and time that relates to a particular topic. Events can range from large-scale (e.g., civil unrest events and earthquakes), to medium-scale (e.g., system failures and crime incidents), to small-scale (e.g., authentication events and individual actions) occurrences [10]. Event analytics are important in domains as different as healthcare, business, cybersphere, politics, and entertainment, influencing almost every corner of our lives [187]. The analysis of events has thus been attracting huge attention over the past few decades and can be categorized in terms of their timeliness for various research directions, such as event summarization, detection, and prediction. Unlike retrospective analyses such as event summarization and detection [30], event prediction focuses on anticipating events in the future and is the focus of this survey. Accurate anticipation of future events enables one to maximize the benefits and minimize the losses associated with some event in the future, bringing huge benefits for both society as a whole and individual members of society in key domains such as disease prevention, disaster management, business intelligence, and economics stability.\n\n“Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future.” —Niels Bohr, 1970\n\nEvent prediction has traditionally been prohibitively challenging across different domains, due to the lack or incompleteness of our knowledge regarding the true causes and mechanisms driving event occurrences in most domains. With the advent of the big data era, however, we now enjoy unprecedented opportunities that open up many alternative approaches for dealing with event prediction problems, sidestepping the need to develop a complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms of event occurrence. Based on large amounts of data on historical events and their potential precursors, event prediction methods typically strive to apply predictive mapping to build on these observations to predict future events, utilizing predictive analysis techniques from domains such as machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, statistics, and other computational models [20]. Event prediction is currently experiencing extremely rapid growth, thanks to advances in sensing techniques (physical sensors and social sensors), prediction techniques (Artificial Intelligence, especially Machine Learning), and high performance computing hardware [63].\n\nEvent prediction in big data is a difficult problem that requires the invention and integration of related techniques to address the serious challenges caused by its unique characteristics, including: (1) Heterogeneous multi-output predictions. Event prediction methods usually need to predict multiple facets of events including their time, location, topic, intensity, and duration, each of which may utilize a different data structure [144]. This creates unique challenges, including how to jointly predict these heterogeneous yet correlated facets of outputs. Due to the rich information in the outputs, label preparation is usually a highly labor-intensive task performed by human annotators, with automatic methods introducing numerous errors in items such as event coding. So, how can we improve the label quality as well as the model robustness under corrupted labels? The multi-faceted nature of events make event prediction a multi-objective problem, which raises the question of how to properly unify the prediction performance on different facets. It is also challenging to verify whether a predicted event “matches” a real event, given that the various facets are seldom, if ever, 100% accurately predicted. So, how can we set up the criteria needed to discriminate between a correct prediction (“true positive”) and a wrong one (“false positive”)? (2) Complex dependencies among the prediction outputs. Beyond conventional isolated tasks in machine learning and predictive analysis, in event prediction the predicted events can correlate to and influence each other [121]. For example, an ongoing traffic incident event could cause congestion on the current road segment in the first 5 min but then lead to congestion on other contiguous road segments 10 min later. Global climate data might indicate a drought in one location, which could then cause famine in the area and lead to a mass exodus of refugees moving to another location. So, how should we consider the correlations among future events? (3) Real-time stream of prediction tasks. Event prediction usually requires continuous monitoring of the observed input data to trigger timely alerts of future potential events [155]. However, during this process the trained prediction model gradually becomes outdated, as real world events continually change dynamically, concepts are fluid and distribution drifts are inevitable. For example, in September 2008 21% of the United States population were social media users, including 2% of those over 65. However, by May 2018, 72% of the United States population were social media users, including 40% of those over [29]. Not only the data distribution but also the number of features and input data sources can also vary in real time. Hence, it is imperative to periodically upgrade the models, which raises further questions concerning how to train models based on non-stationary distributions, while balancing the cost (such as computation cost and data annotation cost) and timeliness? (4) Challenges in the event big data. The above-mentioned challenges and nature in event prediction tasks further cause more difficulties in collecting and utilizing event data. First, noisiness is a very common issue in event data. There are three major types including missing (e.g., due to device outage), erroneous (e.g., caused by malfunction in physical sensor and typos in social media), and adversarial data (e.g., rumors). Second, the high complexity of event occurrence mechanism encourages researchers to use multiple data sources to better cover all the indicators. However, different data sources can be highly heterogeneous, coming with different modalities, spatial resolutions, qualities, and temporal duration, leading to extreme difficulties in an effective fusion of them. Moreover, many events are rare, such as terrorism, natural disasters, and system failures, leading to an imbalance between the positive (event occurrence) and negative (no occurrence) data samples, which are well-known to be highly challenging especially classic supervised learning techniques.\n\nIn recent years, a considerable amount of research has been devoted to event prediction technique development and applications, to address the aforementioned challenges. Recently, there has been a surge of research that both proposes and applies new approaches in numerous domains, though event prediction techniques are generally still in their infancy. Most existing event prediction methods have been designed for a specific application domains, but their approaches are usually general enough to handle problems in other application domains. Unfortunately, it is difficult to cross-reference these techniques across different application domains serving totally different communities. Moreover, the quality of event prediction results require sophisticated and specially-designed evaluation strategies due to the subject matter's unique characteristics, for example its multi-objective nature (e.g., accuracy, resolution, efficiency, and lead time) and heterogeneous prediction results (e.g., heterogeneity and multi-output). As yet, however, we lack a systematic standardization and comprehensive summarization approaches with which to evaluate the various event prediction methodologies that have been proposed. This absence of a systematic summary and taxonomy of existing techniques and applications in event prediction causes major problems for those working in the field who lacks clear information on the existing bottlenecks, traps, open problems, and potentially fruitful future research directions.\n\nTo overcome these hurdles and facilitate the development of better event prediction methodologies and applications, this survey article aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the current state of the art for event prediction in the big data era. The major contributions include:\n\nA systematic categorization and summarization of existing techniques. Existing event prediction methods are categorized according to their event aspects (time, location, and semantics), problem formulation, and corresponding techniques to create the taxonomy of a generic framework. Relationships, advantages, and disadvantages among different subcategories are discussed, along with details of the techniques under each subcategory. The proposed taxonomy could help domain experts locate the most useful techniques for their targeted problem settings.\n\nA comprehensive categorization and summarization of major application domains. The first taxonomy of event prediction application domains is provided. The practical significance and problem formulation are elucidated for each application domain or subdomain, enabling it to be easily mapped to the proposed technique taxonomy. This will help data scientists and model developers to search for additional application domains and datasets to evaluate their proposed methods, and expand their advanced techniques to encompass new application domains.\n\nStandardized evaluation metrics and procedures. Due to the nontrivial structure of event prediction outputs, which can contain multiple fields such as time, location, intensity, duration, and topic, this article proposes a set of standard metrics with which to standardize existing ways to pair predicted events with true events. Then additional metrics are introduced and standardized to evaluate how close the predicted events are to the real ones.\n\nAn insightful discussion of the current status of research in this area and future trends. Based on the comprehensive and systematic survey and investigation of existing event prediction techniques and applications presented here, an overall picture and the shape of the current research frontiers are outlined. The article concludes by presenting fresh insights into the bottleneck, traps, and open problems, as well as a discussion of possible future directions.\n\n1.1 Related Surveys\n\nThis section briefly outlines previous surveys in various domains that have some relevance to event prediction in big data in three categories, namely, (1) event detection, (2) predictive analytics, and (3) domain-specific event prediction.\n\nEvent detection has been an extensively explored domain with over many years. Its main purpose is to detect historical or ongoing events rather than to predict as yet unseen events in the future [154]. Event detection typically focuses on pattern recognition [20], anomaly detection [75], change footprint pattern discovery [216], and clustering [75], which are very different from those in event prediction. There have been several surveys of research in this domain in the last decade [9, 13, 52, 125]. For example, Deng et al. [52] and Atefeh and Khreich [13] provided overviews of event extraction techniques in social media, while Michelioudakis et al. [125] presented a survey of event recognition with uncerntainty. Alevizos et al. [9] provided a review of event recognition methods using probabilistic methods.\n\nPredictive analysis covers the prediction of target variables given a set of dependent variables. These target variables are typically homogeneous scalar or vector data for describing items such as economic indices, housing prices, or sentiments. The target variables may not necessarily be values in the future. Larose [103] provides a good tutorial and survey for this domain. Predictive analysis can be broken down into subdomains such as structured prediction [20], spatial prediction [88], and sequence prediction [71], enabling users to handle different types of structure for the target variable. Fülöp et al. [65] provided a survey and categorization of applications that utilize predictive analytics techniques to perform event processing and detection, while Jiang [88] focused on spatial prediction methods that predict the indices that have spatial dependency. Baklr et al. [14] summarized the literature on predicting structural data such as geometric objects and networks, and Arias et al. [12] Phillips et al. [138], and Yu and Kak [196] all proposed for predictive analysis using social data.\n\nAs event prediction methods are typically motivated by specific application domains, there are a number of surveys event predictions for domains such as flood events [37], social unrest [22], wind power ramp forecasting [61], tornado events [55], temporal events without location information [70], online failures [155], and business failures [6]. However, in spite of its promise and its rapid growth in recent years, the domain of event prediction in big data still suffers from the lack of a comprehensive and systematic literature survey covering all its various aspects, including relevant techniques, applications, evaluations, and open problems.\n\n1.2 Outline\n\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents generic problem formulations for event prediction and the evaluation of event prediction results. Section 3 then presents a taxonomy and comprehensive description of event prediction techniques, after which Section 4 categorizes and summarizes the various applications of event prediction. Section 5 lists the open problems and suggests future research directions and this survey concludes in Section 6.\n\n5 OPEN CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\n\nDespite the major advances in event prediction in recent years, there are still a number of open problems and potentially fruitful directions for future research, as follows:\n\n5.1 Model Transparency, Interpretability, and Accountability\n\nIncreasingly sophisticated forecasting models have been proposed to improve the prediction accuracy, including those utilizing approaches such as ensemble models, neural networks, and the other complex systems mentioned above. However, although the accuracy can be improved, the event prediction models are rapidly becoming too complex to be interpreted by human operators. The need for better model accountability and interpretability is becoming an important issue; as big data and Artificial Intelligence techniques are applied to ever more domains this can lead to serious consequences for applications such as healthcare and disaster management. Models that are not interpretable by humans will find it hard to build the trust needed if they are to be fully integrated into the workflow of practitioners. A closely related key feature is the accountability of the event prediction system. For example, disaster managers need to thoroughly understand a model's recommendations if they want to explain the reason for a decision to displace people in a court of law. An ever increasing number of laws in countries around the world are beginning to require adequate explanations of decisions from prediction models. For example, Articles 13-15 in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation [177] require algorithms that make decisions that “significantly affect” individuals to provide explanations (“right to explanation”) by May 28, 2018. The United States [38] and China [140] have also established similar laws.\n\n5.2 Vulnerability to Noise and Adversarial Attacks\n\nThe massive popularity of the proposal, development, and deployment of event prediction is stimulating a surge interest in developing ways to counter-attack these systems. It will therefore not be a surprise when we begin to see the introduction of techniques to obfuscate these event prediction methods in the near future. As with many state-of-the-art AI techniques applied in other domains such as object recognition, event prediction methods can also be very vulnerable to noise and adversarial attacks. The famous failure of Google Flu trends, which missed the peak of the 2013 flu season by 140 percent due to low relevance and high disturbance affecting the input signal, is a vivid memory for practitioners in the field [66]. Many predictions relying on social media data can also be easily influenced or flipped by injecting scam messages. Event prediction models also tend to over-rely on low-quality input data that can be easily disturbed or manipulated, lacking sufficient robustness to survive noisy signals and adversarial attacks. Similar problems threaten to other application domains such as business intelligence, crime, and cyber systems.\n\n5.3 Integration of Mechanistic Knowledge and Data Driven-models\n\nOver the years, many domains have accumulated a significant amount of knowledge and experience about event development occurrence mechanisms, which can thus provide important clues for anticipating future events, such as epidiomiology models, socio-political models, and earthquake models. All of these models focus on simplifying real-world phenomena into concise principles to grasp the core mechanism, discarding many details in the process. In contrast, data-driven models strive to ensure the accurate fitting of large historical data sets, based on sufficient model expressiveness but cannot guarantee that the true underlying principle and causality of event occurrence modeled accurately. There is thus a clear motivation to combine their complementary strengths, and although this has already attracted great deal of interest [204], most of the models proposed so far are merely ensemble learning-based and simply merge the final predictions from each model. A more thorough integration is needed that can directly embed the core principles to regularize and instruct the training of data-driven event prediction methods. Moreover, existing attempts are typically specific to particular domains and are thus difficult to develop further as they require in-depth collaborations between data scientists and domain experts. A generic framework developed to encompass multiple different domains is imperative and would be highly beneficial.\n\n5.4 Prescriptive and Counterfactual Analysis\n\nThe ultimate purpose of event prediction is usually not just to anticipate the future, but to change it, for example by avoiding a system failure and flattening the curve of a disease outbreak. However, it is difficult for practitioners to determine how to act appropriately and implement effective policies to achieve the desired results in the future. This requires a capability that goes beyond simply predicting future events based on the current situation, requiring them instead to also take into account the new actions being taken in real time and then predict how they might influence the future. One promising direction is the use of counterfactual event [124] prediction that models what would have happened if different circumstances had occurred. Another related direction is prescriptive analysis where different actions can be merged into the prediction system and future results anticipated or optimized. Related works have been developed in few domains such as epidemiology. However, as yet these lack sufficient research in many other domains that will be needed if we are to develop generic frameworks that can benefit different domains.\n\n5.5 Multi-objective Training\n\nExisting event prediction methods mostly focus primarily on accuracy. However, decision makers who utilize these predicted event results usually need much more, including key factors such as event resolution (e.g., time resolution, location resolution, description details), confidence (e.g., the probability a predicted event will occur), efficiency (whether the model can predict per day or per seccond), lead time (how many days the prediction can be made prior to the event occurring), and event intensity (how serious it is). multi-objective optimization (e.g., accuracy, confidence, resolution). There are typically trade-offs among all the above metrics and accuracy, so merely optimizing accuracy during training will inevitably mean the results drift away from the overall optimal event-prediction-based decision. A multi-objective optimization system that can flexibly balance the trade-off between these metrics based on decision makers’ needs is imperative."
