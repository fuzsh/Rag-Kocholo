        "text": "Recently, SRS air-bag has been adopted to compact cars with the movement of standardization. Air-bag is ordinarily covered with the article called \"air-bag cover\". Thinner part of air-bag cover, which was installed beforehand,is torn by the swelling of air-bag, permitting the spread of air-bag. Nowadays, as a material for the cover, thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are widely used. In this paper we show low temperature impact resistance and so on as required properties for this use, and mention the relationship between material and use, with some examples using olefinic TPE.\n\n( by Tatsuo HAMANAKA, Hiroshi OOYAMA, Keitaro KOJIMA, Toshitsugu KIKUCHI, Tadashi HIKASA )\n\nApparatus used in the chemical industries are subjected to complicated and various aggressive environments, and as a result often undergo considerable corrosion. So in order to realize stable operation and life extension of equipments, adequate management of the operation condition and the corrosion prevention effect by catching th ecorrosion state of equipment is of great importance. As this means to grasp the corrosion state adequately, corrosion monitoring nethods are very usefull.\n\nIn this paper, we present information concerning the abstract of corrosion monitoring methods and the examples applied in Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.\n\n( by Kazuo FUJITA, Masaaki NAGAYAMA, Kazuya KOSHINO, Yoshihisa TOKUMASU )\n\nPyriproxyfen (4-phenoxyphenyl (RS) -2- (2-pyridyloxy) propyl ether)is a photo-stable new insect growth regulator invented and developed by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. Pyriproxyfen is effective especially against whiteflies, scales and thrips that are relatively insensitive to conventional insecticides. Pyriproxyfen has very little adverse effects on natural enemies and bees so that it can be used as a part of IPM program. It is also effective against mosquitoes, houseflies, cockroaches and cat fleas. Pyriproxyfen has no toxicological and environmental concern.\n\n( by Makoto HATAKOSHI, Hirosi KISIDA, Hitoshi KAWADA, Haruka OOUCHI, Naohiko ISOBE, Satoshi HAGINO )\n\nPoly (methyl methacrylate) is widely used in the world for many optical devices. Recently, to meet the demands for more various kinds of applications, the technique for optimizing the performance of the diffusing sheet must be developed. So we researched the factors which affect the way of light scattering, then developed the technique for estimating the intensity and angular dependence of scattered light, and produced superior performance sheets for lighting cover. In this report, we summarize light diffusing PMMA sheets and the light scattering simulation technique.\n\n( by Tomohiro MAEKAWA, Akiyoshi KANEMITSU, Kenji MANABE )\n\nLithium secondary batteries are very attractive for various applications because of high energy density. In commercially available lithium secondary batteries, LiCoO2 is used as an active material for a cathode. LiNiO2, which is also suitable for such batteries, has advantages of low cost and high capacity compared with LiCoO2. However, LiNiO2 demonstrates poor cycle characteristics when it is used at high capacity.\n\nWe found that the addition of gallium to LiNiO2 improves the cycling behavior significantly1). The gallium-stabilized LiNiO2 shows superior rechargeable capacity of 190mAh/g and retention of more than 95?? after 100 cycles in the cycling test between 3.0 and 4.3V at room temperature. In this paper, we describe the production method and properties of this newly developed cathode active material, as well as the performance of 18650 cylindrical type test cells. In contrast with the commercially available cells which capacities are not more than 1350mAh, our test cells achieved 1600mAh with excellent cycle characteristics.\n\n( by Kenji NAKANE, Yasunori NISHIDA, Genjiro NISHIKATA, Taketsugu YAMAMOTO, Ken-ichiro KAMI, Tatsuo TATENO, Hitoshi MIURA, Tomoari SATOH )\n\nTo clarify the indoor behavior of household insecticides in space or residual spraying, an aerosol canister (containing a mixture of 0.45g d-Tetramethrin and 0.06g d-Resmethrin in a 300-ml product for space spraying;or containing a mixture of 0.9g d-Phenothrin and 1.1g d-Tetramethrin in a 300-ml product for residual spraying) was applied to a typical Japanese room under various conditions and temporal concentrations in air, floor, wall and ceiling were monitored. Air concentrations were chiefly dependent on ventilation rates but not on air circulation by an air conditioner. During a periodic spraying, the airborne insecticides did not accumulate in the room, but the floor residues gradually increased with the number of sprayings. After cessation of spraying, however, dislodgeable residues on the floor decreased with time.\n\nThe time-dependent behavior of the insecticides was simulated by a mathematical model (InPest) developed by the authors, and it was found that the estimated values agreed fully with actually measured ones. Thus, the InPest helped a more comprehensive understanding of the insecticide behavior.\n\nIndoor exposures of the insecticides to room,s occupants were estimated with the monitored concentrations when the space or residual sprayings were periodically done in a room with all windows closed. The margins of safety, which were obtained by dividing the no observed effect levels by exposure levels, were over 100 even for unclothed occupants who live in the room following the space or residual spraying. Thus, it was concluded that these two products can be used without any substantial risks with regard to human health.\n\n( by Yoshihide MATOBA, Jun-ichi OHNISHI, Masatoshi MATSUO )\n\nThe following paper describes an outline of structure elucidation in chemical industries. We start with brief descriptions of the structure elucidation of organic compounds. An automation in the process of the structure elucidation is discussed. Contemporary trends in the structure elucidation systems are covered briefly. The systems are classified into several categories, for example, library search systems, spectrum prediction systems, and structure generation systems. The SpecInfo system outlined as the system with the structure generator.\n\nWe also describe a structure elucidation system for 2D-NMR spectra. The system named Spec2D has been mainly developed by Sumitomo Chemical Co. The Spec2D system proposes candidate structures for an unknown compound based upon its H-H COSY and 1H-NMR spectra. The proposed structures are verified by comparing between estimated spectra and the input spectrum of the unknown substance.\n\n( by Iwao DOHGANE, Hideyuki MASUI, Kiyoshi NAKAI )"
