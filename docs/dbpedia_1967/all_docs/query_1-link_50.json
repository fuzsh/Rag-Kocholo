        "text": "Last week I was contacted by Will Geiken, who I'd met years ago when he was a part of the Ivy League Select Team at the Izumo Ekiden. He was looking for historical results from Izumo and lists of past team members, and I was able to put together a pretty much complete history, only missing the alternates from 1998 to 2010 and a little shaky on the reverse transliterations of some of the names from katakana back into the Western alphabet for the same years. Feel free to send corrections or additions to alternate lists.\n\nIt's interesting to go back and see some names that went on to be familiar, to see the people who made an impact like Princeton's Paul Morrison, Cornell's Max King, Stanford's Brendan Gregg in one of the years the team opened up beyond the Ivy League, Cornell's Ben de Haan, Princeton's Matt McDonald, and Harvard's Hugo Milner last year, and some of the people who struggled with the format.1998\n\nTeam: 15th of 21 overall, 2:14:10 (43.1 km)\n\nKilian Lonaghan/Harvard - 11th, First Stage (7.2 km) - 20:44\n\nDarren Schiller/Harvard - 15th, Second Stage (6.0 km) - 17:57\n\nChristian Lynch/Princeton - 20th, Third Stage (5.7 km) - 17:56\n\nDaniel Johnson/Brown - 19th, Fourth Stage (5.6 km) - 17:49\n\nDonal O'Sullivan/Brown - 15th, Fifth Stage (7.3 km) - 23:13\n\nKersey O'Shaw/Columbia - 16th, Sixth Stage (11.3 km) - 36:31\n\nTeam: 17th of 21 overall, 2:13:50 (43.1 km)\n\nKersey O'Shaw/Columbia - 16th, First Stage (7.2 km) - 21:25\n\nBrock Tessman/Brown - 18th, Second Stage (6.0 km) - 18:48\n\nNeville Davie/Brown - 14th, Third Stage (5.7 km) - 17:15\n\nAmerigo Rossi/Columbia - 16th, Fourth Stage (5.6 km) - 17:25\n\nJames Betterino/Brown - 15th, Fifth Stage (7.3 km) - 22:48\n\nThomas Cruz/Columbia - 15th, Sixth Stage (11.3 km) - 36:09\n\nTeam: 14th of 21 overall, 2:14:24 (43.1 km)\n\nDonal O'Sullivan/Brown - 20th, First Stage (7.2 km) - 22:47\n\nRay Biasback/Columbia - 16th, Second Stage (6.0 km) - 18:35\n\nJ.

Akasaki finished 2nd in October's Olympic marathon trials to make the Paris team, only the second man from Kumamoto prefecture to ever make an Olympic marathon team after Kanakuri at the 1924 Paris Olympics. On Nov. 6 Akasaki visited the town of Tamana in Kumamoto to pay his respects at the great Kanakuri's grave. At Tamana City Hall he was greeted by applause from city workers. Akasaki's coach at the Kyudenko corporate team, Kazuharu Takai , and his Takushoku University -era coach Masahiro Okada , were also in attendance to celebrate his achievement. Afterward Akasaki visited Kanakuri's grave to pay his respects and inform the legend's spirit that he will be running in the Olympics too. \"Kanakuri was the creator of the Hakone Ekiden, and I was lucky to run it four times,\" sai\n\nWith renewed confidence, Japan's Olympic marathon team will face the total 438 m elevation difference hills of Paris this summer. The members of the women's and men's marathon teams for August's Paris Olympics appeared at a press conference in Tokyo on Mar. 25 in conjunction with the Japan Marathon Championship Series III (JMC) awards gala. Women's Olympic trials winner Yuka Suzuki (Daiichi Seimei) said she was riding a wave of motivation in the wake of the new women's national record.

Local resident Hirai Muroyama , 20, of no known occupation, was arrested on charges of sexual assault. He is accused of acts including grabbing the breasts of a woman in her 20s at around 10 p.m. on May 31 along the banks of the Tama River.

Under police interrogation Muroyama told investigators, \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go out for a walk and move my body. I'd had a few drinks and was feeling pretty hype. She was totally my type.\" source article: https://news.tbs.co.jp/newseye/tbs_newsey"
