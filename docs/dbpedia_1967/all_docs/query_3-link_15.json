        "text": "Kitami Institute of Technology is Japan’s northernmost national university, offering a strong academic focus on the solution of regional and global environmental, energy and social design challenges. This forward-looking university required a remote teaching solution to make its lectures accessible to students at two other institutions—Otaru University of Commerce and Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine.\n\nTo enable new remote teaching possibilities and deepen student engagement, Kitami Institute of Technology has created an open education studio. Generously equipped with 4K PTZ (Pan/Tilt/Zoom) remote cameras, 4K displays, wireless microphones and recording equipment, the space allows lecturers to create high-quality teaching content that can be shared remotely with students at Otaru and Obihiro universities.\n\nAt the heart of the solution provided by Sony is the REA-C1000 Edge Analytics Appliance that uses the power of AI to create engaging video presentation content. Enabled by an optional software license, the Handwriting Extraction feature of the REA-C1000 accurately captures the lecturer’s written notes and sketches on a whiteboard, using Augmented Reality (AR) to display writing on a screen that every student can see clearly—even if the lecturer is standing directly in front of the board. A further license enables Chroma key-less CG overlay: this adds extra polish to lectures with animated backdrops and graphical overlays behind the lecturer with no need for a complex green screen set-up.\n\nThe Edge Analytics Appliance is mounted on a mobile rack, enabling it to be moved easily into the university’s main auditorium that accommodates over 270 students. Further optional software licenses for the REA-C1000 enable PTZ Auto Tracking and Focus Area Cropping features. These allow the SRG-X400 remote camera to recognize the lecturer’s facial expressions and movements, automatically tracking the teacher’s position to capture crisply focused, accurately framed images as they address the class.\n\n“The handwriting extraction of the Edge Analytics Appliance is very smooth—it responds as soon as teachers write on the whiteboard,” states Hiroshi Masui, Kitami Institute of Technology. “The Chroma key-less CG overlay function lets students recognize lecture materials at the same time as the lecturer’s facial expressions and movements, helping them understand the lesson without getting bored. We’re also looking forward to enhancing the quality of remote lectures by using the functions of the Edge Analytics Appliance.”"
