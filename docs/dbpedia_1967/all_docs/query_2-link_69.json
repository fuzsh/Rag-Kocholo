The proposal was based on a model in which the Hsp90 chaperone machinery regulates signaling by modulating ligand-binding clefts. The model provides a framework for thinking about the development of neuroprotective therapies for protein-folding diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and the polyglutamine expansion disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD) and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). Major aberrant proteins that misfold and accumulate in these diseases are \"client\" proteins of the abundant and ubiquitous stress chaperone Hsp90. These Hsp90 client proteins include tau (AD), Î±-synuclein (PD), huntingtin (HD), and the expanded glutamine androgen receptor (polyQ AR) (SBMA). In this Minireview, we update our model in which Hsp90 acts on protein-folding clefts and show how it forms a rational basis for developing drugs that promote the targeted elimination of these aberrant proteins.

The aberration correction function was developed by modifying the image-processing software previously designed for auto focus tracking, as described in the first article of this series. Using the newly developed system, the coma aberration and 3-fold astigmatism were corrected using the aberration coefficients obtained experimentally before the processing was carried out. In this study, these aberration coefficients were estimated from an apparent 2-fold astigmatism induced under tilted-illumination conditions. In contrast, 2-fold astigmatism could be measured and corrected in real time from the reconstructed wave field. Here, the measurement precision for 2-fold astigmatism was found to be Â±0.4 nm and Â±2Â°. All of these aberration corrections, as well as auto focus tracking, were performed at a video frame rate of 1/30 s. Thus, the proposed novel system is promising for quantitative and reliable in situ observations, particularly in environmental TEM applications.\n\nProtein folding: Over half a century lasting quest. Comment on \"There and back again: Two views on the protein folding puzzle\" by Alexei V. Finkelstein et al.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKrokhotin, Andrey; Dokholyan, Nikolay V.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nMost proteins fold into unique three-dimensional (3D) structures that determine their biological functions, such as catalytic activity or macromolecular binding. Misfolded proteins can pose a threat through aberrant interactions with other proteins leading to a number of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [1,2]. What does determine 3D structure of proteins? The first clue to this question came more than fifty years ago when Anfinsen demonstrated that unfolded proteins can spontaneously fold to their native 3D structures [3,4]. Anfinsen's experiments lead to the conclusion that proteins fold to unique native structure corresponding to the stable and kinetically accessible free energy minimum, and protein native structure is solely determined by its amino acid sequence. The question of how exactly proteins find their free energy minimum proved to be a difficult problem. One of the puzzles, initially pointed out by Levinthal, was an inconsistency between observed protein folding times and theoretical estimates. A self-avoiding polymer model of a globular protein of 100-residues length on a cubic lattice can sample at least 1047 states. Based on the assumption that conformational sampling occurs at the highest vibrational mode of proteins (â¼picoseconds), predicted folding time by searching among all the possible conformations leads to â¼1027 years (much larger than the age of the universe) [5]. In contrast, observed protein folding time range from microseconds to minutes. Due to tremendous theoretical progress in protein folding field that has been achieved in past decades, the source of this inconsistency is currently understood that is thoroughly described in the review by Finkelstein et al. [6].\n\nFolding superfunnel to describe cooperative folding of interacting proteins.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmeller, LÃ¡szlÃ³\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThis paper proposes a generalization of the well-known folding funnel concept of proteins. In the funnel model the polypeptide chain is treated as an individual object not interacting with other proteins. Since biological systems are considerably crowded, protein-protein interaction is a fundamental feature during the life cycle of proteins. The folding superfunnel proposed here describes the folding process of interacting proteins in various situations. The first example discussed is the folding of the freshly synthesized protein with the aid of chaperones. Another important aspect of protein-protein interactions is the folding of the recently characterized intrinsically disordered proteins, where binding to target proteins plays a crucial role in the completion of the folding process. The third scenario where the folding superfunnel is used is the formation of aggregates from destabilized proteins, which is an important factor in case of several conformational diseases. The folding superfunnel constructed here with the minimal assumption about the interaction potential explains all three cases mentioned above. Proteins 2016; 84:1009-1016.

These transiently and sparsely populated species on the protein folding energy landscape play crucial roles in driving folding toward the native conformation, yet some of these nonnative states may also serve as precursors for protein misfolding and aggregation associated with a range of devastating diseases, including neuro-degeneration, diabetes and cancer. Therefore, in vivo protein folding is often reshaped co- and post-translationally through interactions with the ribosome, molecular chaperones and/or other cellular components. Owing to developments in instrumentation and methodology, solution NMR spectroscopy has emerged as the central experimental approach for the detailed characterization of the complex protein folding processes in vitro and in vivo. NMR relaxation dispersion and saturation transfer methods provide the means for a detailed characterization of protein folding kinetics and thermodynamics under native-like conditions, as well as modeling high-resolution structures of weakly populated short-lived conformational states on the protein folding energy landscape. Continuing development of isotope labeling strategies and NMR methods to probe high molecular weight protein assemblies, along with advances of in-cell NMR, have recently allowed protein folding to be studied in the context of ribosome-nascent chain complexes and molecular chaperones, and even inside living cells. Here we review solution NMR approaches to investigate the protein folding energy landscape, and discuss selected applications of NMR methodology to studying protein folding in vitro and in vivo. Together, these examples highlight a vast potential of solution NMR in providing atomistic insights into molecular mechanisms of protein folding and homeostasis in health and disease.

This coupled study of fast folding proteins has provided insight into the mechanisms which allow some proteins to find their native conformation well less than 1 ms and has uncovered examples of theoretically predicted phenomena such as downhill folding. The study of fast folders also informs our understanding of even âslowâ folding processes: fast folders are small, relatively simple protein domains and the principles that govern their folding also govern the folding of more complex systems. This review summarizes the major theoretical and experimental techniques used to study fast folding proteins and provides an overview of the major findings of fast folding research. Finally, we examine the themes that have emerged from studying fast folders and briefly summarize their application to protein folding in general as well as some work that is left to do.

To investigate the factors contributing to the break point distribution in radiation-induced chromosome aberrations, human epithelial cells were fixed in G1 phase. Interphase chromosomes were hybridized with a multicolor banding in situ hybridization (mBAND) probe for chromosome 3 which distinguishes six regions of the chromosome in separate colors. After the images were captured with a laser scanning confocal microscope, the 3-dimensional structure of interphase chromosome 3 was reconstructed at multimega base pair scale. Specific locations of the chromosome, in interphase, were also analyzed with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes. Both mBAND and BAC studies revealed non-random folding of chromatin in interphase, and suggested association of interphase chromatin folding to the radiation-induced chromosome aberration hotspots. We further investigated the distribution of genes, as well as the distribution of breaks found in tumor cells. Comparisons of these distributions to the radiation hotspots showed that some of the radiation hotspots coincide with the frequent breaks found in solid tumors and with the fragile sites for other environmental toxins. Our results suggest that multiple factors, including the chromatin structure and the gene distribution, can contribute to radiation-induced chromosome aberrations.\n\nPREFACE Protein folding: lessons learned and new frontiers Protein folding: lessons learned and new frontiers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPappu, Rohit V.; Nussinov, Ruth\n\n2009-03-01\n\nIn appropriate physiological milieux proteins spontaneously fold into their functional three-dimensional structures. The amino acid sequences of functional proteins contain all the information necessary to specify the folds. This remarkable observation has spawned research aimed at answering two major questions. (1) Of all the conceivable structures that a protein can adopt, why is the ensemble of native-like structures the most favorable? (2) What are the paths by which proteins manage to robustly and reproducibly fold into their native structures? Anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis has guided the pursuit of answers to the first question whereas Levinthal's paradox has influenced the development of models for protein folding dynamics. Decades of work have led to significant advances in the folding problem. Mean-field models have been developed to capture our current, coarse grain understanding of the driving forces for protein folding. These models are being used to predict three-dimensional protein structures from sequence and stability profiles as a function of thermodynamic and chemical perturbations. Impressive strides have also been made in the field of protein design, also known as the inverse folding problem, thereby testing our understanding of the determinants of the fold specificities of different sequences. Early work on protein folding pathways focused on the specific sequence of events that could lead to a simplification of the search process. However, unifying principles proved to be elusive. Proteins that show reversible two-state folding-unfolding transitions turned out to be a gift of natural selection. Focusing on these simple systems helped researchers to uncover general principles regarding the origins of cooperativity in protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics. On the theoretical front, concepts borrowed from polymer physics and the physics of spin glasses led to the development of a framework based on energy landscape theories. These\n\nEnergy landscape of knotted protein folding\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSuÅkowska, Joanna I.; Noel, Jeffrey K.; Onuchic, Jose N.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nRecent experiments have conclusively shown that proteins are able to fold from an unknotted, denatured polypeptide to the knotted, native state without the aid of chaperones. These experiments are consistent with a growing body of theoretical work showing that a funneled, minimally frustrated energy landscape is sufficient to fold small proteins with complex topologies. Here, we present a theoretical investigation of the folding of a knotted protein, 2ouf, engineered in the laboratory by a domain fusion that mimics an evolutionary pathway for knotted proteins. Unlike a previously studied knotted protein of similar length, we see reversible folding/knotting and a surprising lack of deep topological traps with a coarse-grained structure-based model. Our main interest is to investigate how evolution might further select the geometry and stiffness of the threading region of the newly fused protein. We compare the folding of the wild-type protein to several mutants. Similarly to the wild-type protein, all mutants show robust and reversible folding, and knotting coincides with the transition state ensemble. As observed experimentally, our simulations show that the knotted protein folds about ten times slower than an unknotted construct with an identical contact map. Simulated folding kinetics reflect the experimentally observed rollover in the folding limbs of chevron plots. Successful folding of the knotted protein is restricted to a narrow range of temperature as compared to the unknotted protein and fits of the kinetic folding data below folding temperature suggest slow, nondiffusive dynamics for the knotted protein.

The mode properties and aberration coefficient with intracavity misalignment are achieved by iterative calculation and Zernike polynomial fitting. Experimental results for the relation of intracavity maladjustment and mode characteristics are further obtained in terms of S-H detection and model wavefront reconstruction. It indicates that intracavity phase perturbation has significant influence on out coupling beam properties, and the uniform and symmetry of the mode is rapidly disrupted even by a slight misalignment of the resonator mirrors. Meanwhile, the far-field beam patterns will obviously degrade with increasing the distance between the convex mirror and the phase perturbation position even if the equivalent disturbation is inputted into such the resonator. The closed-loop device for compensating intracavity low order aberration is successfully fabricated. Moreover, Zernike defocus aberration is also effectively controlled by precisely adjusting resonator length, and the beam quality is noticeably improved.\n\nHow Does Your Protein Fold? Elucidating the Apomyoglobin Folding Pathway\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDyson, H. Jane; Wright, Peter E.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nConspectus Although each type of protein fold and in some cases individual proteins within a fold classification can have very different mechanisms of folding, the underlying biophysical and biochemical principles that operate to cause a linear polypeptide chain to fold into a globular structure must be the same. In an aqueous solution, the protein takes up the thermodynamically most stable structure, but the pathway along which the polypeptide proceeds in order to reach that structure is a function of the amino acid sequence, which must be the final determining factor, not only in shaping the final folded structure, but in dictating the folding pathway. A number of groups have focused on a single protein or group of proteins, to determine in detail the factors that influence the rate and mechanism of folding in a defined system, with the hope that hypothesis-driven experiments can elucidate the underlying principles governing the folding process. Our research group has focused on the folding of the globin family of proteins, and in particular on the monomeric protein apomyoglobin. Apomyoglobin (apoMb) folds relatively slowly (~2 seconds) via an ensemble of obligatory intermediates that form rapidly after the initiation of folding. The folding pathway can be dissected using rapid-mixing techniques, which can probe processes in the millisecond time range. Stopped-flow measurements detected by circular dichroism (CD) or fluorescence spectroscopy give information on the rates of folding events. Quench-flow experiments utilize the differential rates of hydrogen-deuterium exchange of amide protons protected in parts of the structure that are folded early; protection of amides can be detected by mass spectrometry or proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). In addition, apoMb forms an intermediate at equilibrium at pH ~ 4, which is sufficiently stable for it to be structurally characterized by solution methods such as CD, fluorescence and NMR spectroscopies\n\nExtant fold-switching proteins are widespread.\n\nPubMed\n\nPorter, Lauren L; Looger, Loren L\n\n2018-06-05\n\nA central tenet of biology is that globular proteins have a unique 3D structure under physiological conditions. Recent work has challenged this notion by demonstrating that some proteins switch folds, a process that involves remodeling of secondary structure in response to a few mutations (evolved fold switchers) or cellular stimuli (extant fold switchers). To date, extant fold switchers have been viewed as rare byproducts of evolution, but their frequency has been neither quantified nor estimated. By systematically and exhaustively searching the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we found â¼100 extant fold-switching proteins. Furthermore, we gathered multiple lines of evidence suggesting that these proteins are widespread in nature. Based on these lines of evidence, we hypothesized that the frequency of extant fold-switching proteins may be underrepresented by the structures in the PDB. Thus, we sought to identify other putative extant fold switchers with only one solved conformation. To do this, we identified two characteristic features of our â¼100 extant fold-switching proteins, incorrect secondary structure predictions and likely independent folding cooperativity, and searched the PDB for other proteins with similar features. Reassuringly, this method identified dozens of other proteins in the literature with indication of a structural change but only one solved conformation in the PDB. Thus, we used it to estimate that 0.5-4% of PDB proteins switch folds. These results demonstrate that extant fold-switching proteins are likely more common than the PDB reflects, which has implications for cell biology, genomics, and human health.

In this review we discuss aspects of detailed atomic simulation methods applied to studies of protein folding free energy surfaces, using biased-sampling free energy methods and temperature-induced protein unfolding. We review studies from each on systems of particular experimental interest and assess the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in the context of \"exact\" results for both free energies and kinetics of a minimalist model for a beta-barrel protein. We illustrate in detail how each approach is implemented and discuss analysis methods that have been developed as components of these studies. We describe key insights into the relationship between protein topology and the folding mechanism emerging from folding free energy surface calculations. We further describe the determination of detailed \"pathways\" and models of folding transition states that have resulted from unfolding studies. Our assessment of the two methods suggests that both can provide, often complementary, details of folding mechanism and thermodynamics, but this success relies on (a) adequate sampling of diverse conformational regions for the biased-sampling free energy approach and (b) many trajectories at multiple temperatures for unfolding studies. Furthermore, we find that temperature-induced unfolding provides representatives of folding trajectories only when the topology and sequence (energy) provide a relatively funneled landscape and \"off-pathway\" intermediates do not exist.\n\nPhysics of protein folding\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFinkelstein, A. V.; Galzitskaya, O. V.\n\n2004-04-01\n\nProtein physics is grounded on three fundamental experimental facts: protein, this long heteropolymer, has a well defined compact three-dimensional structure; this structure can spontaneously arise from the unfolded protein chain in appropriate environment; and this structure is separated from the unfolded state of the chain by the âall-or-noneâ phase transition, which ensures robustness of protein structure and therefore of its action. The aim of this review is to consider modern understanding of physical principles of self-organization of protein structures and to overview such important features of this process, as finding out the unique protein structure among zillions alternatives, nucleation of the folding process and metastable folding intermediates. Towards this end we will consider the main experimental facts and simple, mostly phenomenological theoretical models. We will concentrate on relatively small (single-domain) water-soluble globular proteins (whose structure and especially folding are much better studied and understood than those of large or membrane and fibrous proteins) and consider kinetic and structural aspects of transition of initially unfolded protein chains into their final solid (ânativeâ) 3D structures.\n\nVisualizing chaperone-assisted protein folding\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nHorowitz, Scott; Salmon, LoÃ¯c; Koldewey, Philipp; ...\n\n2016-05-30\n\nWe present that challenges in determining the structures of heterogeneous and dynamic protein complexes have greatly hampered past efforts to obtain a mechanistic understanding of many important biological processes. One such process is chaperone-assisted protein folding. Obtaining structural ensembles of chaperoneâsubstrate complexes would ultimately reveal how chaperones help proteins fold into their native state. To address this problem, we devised a new structural biology approach based on X-ray crystallography, termed residual electron and anomalous density (READ). READ enabled us to visualize even sparsely populated conformations of the substrate protein immunity protein 7 (Im7) in complex with the Escherichia coli chaperonemoreÂ Â» Spy, and to capture a series of snapshots depicting the various folding states of Im7 bound to Spy. The ensemble shows that Spy-associated Im7 samples conformations ranging from unfolded to partially folded to native-like states and reveals how a substrate can explore its folding landscape while being bound to a chaperone.Â«Â less\n\nA stoichiometry driven universal spatial organization of backbones of folded proteins: are there Chargaff's rules for protein folding?\n\nPubMed\n\nMittal, A; Jayaram, B; Shenoy, Sandhya; Bawa, Tejdeep Singh\n\n2010-10-01\n\nProtein folding is at least a six decade old problem, since the times of Pauling and Anfinsen. However, rules of protein folding remain elusive till date. In this work, rigorous analyses of several thousand crystal structures of folded proteins reveal a surprisingly simple unifying principle of backbone organization in protein folding. We find that protein folding is a direct consequence of a narrow band of stoichiometric occurrences of amino-acids in primary sequences, regardless of the size and the fold of a protein. We observe that \"preferential interactions\" between amino-acids do not drive protein folding, contrary to all prevalent views. We dedicate our discovery to the seminal contribution of Chargaff which was one of the major keys to elucidation of the stoichiometry-driven spatially organized double helical structure of DNA.\n\nEffective Potentials for Folding Proteins\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Nan-Yow; Su, Zheng-Yao; Mou, Chung-Yu\n\n2006-02-01\n\nA coarse-grained off-lattice model that is not biased in any way to the native state is proposed to fold proteins. To predict the native structure in a reasonable time, the model has included the essential effects of water in an effective potential. Two new ingredients, the dipole-dipole interaction and the local hydrophobic interaction, are introduced and are shown to be as crucial as the hydrogen bonding. The model allows successful folding of the wild-type sequence of protein G and may have provided important hints to the study of protein folding.\n\nSpherical aberration correction with an in-lens N-fold symmetric line currents model.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoque, Shahedul; Ito, Hiroyuki; Nishi, Ryuji\n\n2018-04-01\n\nIn our previous works, we have proposed N-SYLC (N-fold symmetric line currents) models for aberration correction. In this paper, we propose \"in-lens N-SYLC\" model, where N-SYLC overlaps rotationally symmetric lens. Such overlap is possible because N-SYLC is free of magnetic materials. We analytically prove that, if certain parameters of the model are optimized, an in-lens 3-SYLC (Nâ¯=â¯3) doublet can correct 3rd order spherical aberration. By computer simulation, we show that the required excitation current for correction is less than 0.25Â AT for beam energy 5â¯keV, and the beam size after correction is smaller than 1â¯nm at the corrector image plane for initial slope less than 4Â mrad.

In comparison with hundred-of-microsecond timescale conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations performed on the Anton supercomputer, aMD captured complete folding of the four proteins in significantly shorter simulation time. The folded protein conformations were found within 0.2-2.1 Ã of the native NMR or X-ray crystal structures. Free energy profiles calculated through improved reweighting of the aMD simulations using cumulant expansion to the second-order are in good agreement with those obtained from cMD simulations. This allows us to identify distinct conformational states (e.g., unfolded and intermediate) other than the native structure and the protein folding energy barriers. Detailed analysis of protein secondary structures and local key residue interactions provided important insights into the protein folding pathways. Furthermore, the selections of force fields and aMD simulation parameters are discussed in detail. Our work shows usefulness and accuracy of aMD in studying protein folding, providing basic references in using aMD in future protein-folding studies.

However, large, hydrophobic proteins typically aggregate into insoluble and misfolded species, and are directed into inclusion bodies. Current techniques to fold proteins recovered from inclusion bodies rely on denaturation followed by dialysis or rapid dilution. Such approaches can be time consuming, wasteful, and inefficient. Here, we describe rapid protein folding using a vortex fluidic device (VFD). This process uses mechanical energy introduced into thin films to rapidly and efficiently fold proteins. With the VFD in continuous flow mode, large volumes of protein solution can be processed per day with 100-fold reductions in both folding times and buffer volumes.\n\nCooperativity and modularity in protein folding\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSasai, Masaki; Chikenji, George; Terada, Tomoki P.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA simple statistical mechanical model proposed by Wako and SaitÃ´ has explained the aspects of protein folding surprisingly well. This model was systematically applied to multiple proteins by MuÃ±oz and Eaton and has since been referred to as the Wako-SaitÃ´-MuÃ±oz-Eaton (WSME) model. The success of the WSME model in explaining the folding of many proteins has verified the hypothesis that the folding is dominated by native interactions, which makes the energy landscape globally biased toward native conformation. Using the WSME and other related models, SaitÃ´ emphasized the importance of the hierarchical pathway in protein folding; folding starts with the creation of contiguous segments having a native-like configuration and proceeds as growth and coalescence of these segments. The Î¦-values calculated for barnase with the WSME model suggested that segments contributing to the folding nucleus are similar to the structural modules defined by the pattern of native atomic contacts. The WSME model was extended to explain folding of multi-domain proteins having a complex topology, which opened the way to comprehensively understanding the folding process of multi-domain proteins. The WSME model was also extended to describe allosteric transitions, indicating that the allosteric structural movement does not occur as a deterministic sequential change between two conformations but as a stochastic diffusive motion over the dynamically changing energy landscape. Statistical mechanical viewpoint on folding, as highlighted by the WSME model, has been renovated in the context of modern methods and ideas, and will continue to provide insights on equilibrium and dynamical features of proteins.

However, the complex dynamics of protein folding and the way they consistently fold into the same structures is not fully understood. Self-organized criticality (SOC) has provided a framework for understanding complex systems in various systems (earthquakes, forest fires, financial markets, and epidemics) through scale invariance and the associated power law behavior. In this research, we use a simple hydrophobic-polar lattice-bound computational model to investigate self-organized criticality as a possible mechanism for generating complexity in protein folding.\n\nImproving Protein Fold Recognition by Deep Learning Networks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJo, Taeho; Hou, Jie; Eickholt, Jesse; Cheng, Jianlin\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFor accurate recognition of protein folds, a deep learning network method (DN-Fold) was developed to predict if a given query-template protein pair belongs to the same structural fold. The input used stemmed from the protein sequence and structural features extracted from the protein pair. We evaluated the performance of DN-Fold along with 18 different methods on Lindahlâs benchmark dataset and on a large benchmark set extracted from SCOP 1.75 consisting of about one million protein pairs, at three different levels of fold recognition (i.e., protein family, superfamily, and fold) depending on the evolutionary distance between protein sequences. The correct recognition rate of ensembled DN-Fold for Top 1 predictions is 84.5%, 61.5%, and 33.6% and for Top 5 is 91.2%, 76.5%, and 60.7% at family, superfamily, and fold levels, respectively. We also evaluated the performance of single DN-Fold (DN-FoldS), which showed the comparable results at the level of family and superfamily, compared to ensemble DN-Fold. Finally, we extended the binary classification problem of fold recognition to real-value regression task, which also show a promising performance.

We also evaluated the performance of single DN-Fold (DN-FoldS), which showed the comparable results at the level of family and superfamily, compared to ensemble DN-Fold. Finally, we extended the binary classification problem of fold recognition to real-value regression task, which also show a promising performance.

E.; Hillson, N.; Onuchic, J. N.\n\nPressure effects on the hydrophobic potential of mean force led Hummer et al. to postulate a model for pressure denaturation of proteins in which denaturation occurs by means of water penetration into the protein interior, rather than by exposing the protein hydrophobic core to the solvent --- commonly used to describe temperature denaturation. We study the effects of pressure in protein folding/unfolding kinetics in an off-lattice minimalist model of a protein in which pressure effects have been incorporated by means of the pair-wise potential of mean force of hydrophobic groups in water. We show that pressure slows down the kinetics of folding by decreasing the reconfigurational diffusion coefficient and moves the location of the folding transition state.\n\nImproving protein fold recognition by extracting fold-specific features from predicted residue-residue contacts.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Jianwei; Zhang, Haicang; Li, Shuai Cheng; Wang, Chao; Kong, Lupeng; Sun, Shiwei; Zheng, Wei-Mou; Bu, Dongbo\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAccurate recognition of protein fold types is a key step for template-based prediction of protein structures. The existing approaches to fold recognition mainly exploit the features derived from alignments of query protein against templates. These approaches have been shown to be successful for fold recognition at family level, but usually failed at superfamily/fold levels. To overcome this limitation, one of the key points is to explore more structurally informative features of proteins. Although residue-residue contacts carry abundant structural information, how to thoroughly exploit these information for fold recognition still remains a challenge. In this study, we present an approach (called DeepFR) to improve fold recognition at superfamily/fold levels. The basic idea of our approach is to extract fold-specific features from predicted residue-residue contacts of proteins using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) technique. Based on these fold-specific features, we calculated similarity between query protein and templates, and then assigned query protein with fold type of the most similar template. DCNN has showed excellent performance in image feature extraction and image recognition; the rational underlying the application of DCNN for fold recognition is that contact likelihood maps are essentially analogy to images, as they both display compositional hierarchy. Experimental results on the LINDAHL dataset suggest that even using the extracted fold-specific features alone, our approach achieved success rate comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches. When further combining these features with traditional alignment-related features, the success rate of our approach increased to 92.3%, 82.5% and 78.8% at family, superfamily and fold levels, respectively, which is about 18% higher than the state-of-the-art approach at fold level, 6% higher at superfamily level and 1% higher at family level.

Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms within the Î±/Î²-hydrolase fold domain in various family members have been found for congenital endocrine, metabolic and nervous system disorders. By examining the amino acid sequence from the various proteins, mutations were found to be prevalent in conserved residues within the Î±/Î²-hydrolase fold of the homologous proteins. This is the case for the thyroglobulin mutations linked to congenital hypothyroidism. To address whether correct folding of the common domain is required for protein export, we inserted the thyroglobulin mutations at homologous positions in two correlated but simpler Î±/Î²-hydrolase fold proteins known to be exported to the cell surface: neuroligin3 and acetylcholinesterase. Here we show that these mutations in the cholinesterase homologous region alter the folding properties of the Î±/Î²-hydrolase fold domain, which are reflected in defects in protein trafficking, folding and function, and ultimately result in retention of the partially processed proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Accordingly, mutations at conserved residues may be transferred amongst homologous proteins to produce common processing defects despite disparate functions, protein complexity and tissue-specific expression of the homologous proteins. More importantly, a similar assembly of the Î±/Î²-hydrolase fold domain tertiary structure among homologous members of the superfamily is required for correct trafficking of the proteins to their final destination.

In this work sequential pattern mining (SPM) is utilized for sequence-based fold recognition. Protein classification in terms of fold recognition plays an important role in computational protein analysis, since it can contribute to the determination of the function of a protein whose structure is unknown. Specifically, one of the most efficient SPM algorithms, cSPADE, is employed for the analysis of protein sequence. A classifier uses the extracted sequential patterns to classify proteins in the appropriate fold category. For training and evaluating the proposed method we used the protein sequences from the Protein Data Bank and the annotation of the SCOP database. The method exhibited an overall accuracy of 25% in a classification problem with 36 candidate categories. The classification performance reaches up to 56% when the five most probable protein folds are considered.\n\nProtein folding and misfolding: mechanism and principles\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEnglander, S. Walter; Mayne, Leland; Krishna, Mallela M. G.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTwo fundamentally different views of how proteins fold are now being debated. Do proteins fold through multiple unpredictable routes directed only by the energetically downhill nature of the folding landscape or do they fold through specific intermediates in a defined pathway that systematically puts predetermined pieces of the target native protein into place? It has now become possible to determine the structure of protein folding intermediates, evaluate their equilibrium and kinetic parameters, and establish their pathway relationships. Results obtained for many proteins have serendipitously revealed a new dimension of protein structure. Cooperative structural units of the native protein, called foldons, unfold and refold repeatedly even under native conditions. Much evidence obtained by hydrogen exchange and other methods now indicates that cooperative foldon units and not individual amino acids account for the unit steps in protein folding pathways. The formation of foldons and their ordered pathway assembly systematically puts native-like foldon building blocks into place, guided by a sequential stabilization mechanism in which prior native-like structure templates the formation of incoming foldons with complementary structure. Thus the same propensities and interactions that specify the final native state, encoded in the amino-acid sequence of every protein, determine the pathway for getting there. Experimental observations that have been interpreted differently, in terms of multiple independent pathways, appear to be due to chance misfolding errors that cause different population fractions to block at different pathway points, populate different pathway intermediates, and fold at different rates. This paper summarizes the experimental basis for these three determining principles and their consequences. Cooperative native-like foldon units and the sequential stabilization process together generate predetermined stepwise pathways.

M.; Boekema, C.\n\n2014-03-01\n\nBy means of computer modeling, we are studying frustration in condensed matter and protein folding, including the influence of temperature and Thomson-figure formation. Frustration is due to competing interactions in a disordered state. The key issue is how the particles interact to reach the lowest frustration. The relaxation for frustration is mostly a power function (randomly assigned pattern) or an exponential function (regular patterns like Thomson figures). For the atomic Thomson model, frustration is predicted to decrease with the formation of Thomson figures at zero kelvin. We attempt to apply our frustration modeling to protein folding and dynamics. We investigate the homogeneous protein frustration that would cause the speed of the protein folding to increase. Increase of protein frustration (where frustration and hydrophobicity interplay with protein folding) may lead to a protein mutation.

In the Foldon Funnel Model, proteins fold in units of secondary structures, which form sequentially along the folding pathway, stabilized by tertiary interactions. The model predicts that the free energy landscape has a volcano shape, rather than a simple funnel, that folding is two-state (single-exponential) when secondary structures are intrinsically unstable, and that each structure along the folding path is a transition state for the previous structure. It shows how sequential pathways are consistent with multiple stochastic routes on funnel landscapes, and it gives good agreement with the 9 order of magnitude dependence of folding rates on protein size for a set of 93 proteins, at the same time it is consistent with the near independence of folding equilibrium constant on size. This model gives estimates of folding rates of proteomes, leading to a median folding time in Escherichia coli of about 5 s.\n\nGeneral Mechanism of Two-State Protein Folding Kinetics\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRollins, Geoffrey C.; Dill, Ken A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe describe here a general model of the kinetic mechanism of protein folding.

Starting from the unfolded state and ending either in the native or nonnative conformational states, trajectories are generated with the coarse-grained united residue (UNRES) force field. The effectiveness of principal components analysis (PCA), an already established mathematical technique for finding global, correlated motions in atomic simulations of proteins, is evaluated here for coarse-grained trajectories. The problems related to PCA and their solutions are discussed. The folding and nonfolding of proteins are examined with free-energy landscapes. Detailed analyses of many folding and nonfolding trajectories at different temperatures show that PCA is very efficient for characterizing the general folding and nonfolding features of proteins. It is shown that the first principal component captures and describes in detail the dynamics of a system. Anomalous diffusion in the folding/nonfolding dynamics is examined by the mean-square displacement (MSD) and the fractional diffusion and fractional kinetic equations. The collisionless (or ballistic) behavior of a polypeptide undergoing Brownian motion along the first few principal components is accounted for.\n\nSolvent viscosity and friction in protein folding dynamics.\n\nPubMed\n\nHagen, Stephen J\n\n2010-08-01\n\nThe famous Kramers rate theory for diffusion-controlled reactions has been extended in numerous ways and successfully applied to many types of reactions. Its application to protein folding reactions has been of particular interest in recent years, as many researchers have performed experiments and simulations to test whether folding reactions are diffusion-controlled, whether the solvent is the source of the reaction friction, and whether the friction-dependence of folding rates generally can provide insight into folding dynamics. These experiments involve many practical difficulties, however. They have also produced some unexpected results. Here we briefly review the Kramers theory for reactions in the presence of strong friction and summarize some of the subtle problems that arise in the application of the theory to protein folding. We discuss how the results of these experiments ultimately point to a significant role for internal friction in protein folding dynamics. Studies of friction in protein folding, far from revealing any weakness in Kramers theory, may actually lead to new approaches for probing diffusional dynamics and energy landscapes in protein folding.\n\nEvolutionary Strategies for Protein Folding\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMurthy Gopal, Srinivasa; Wenzel, Wolfgang\n\n2006-03-01\n\nThe free energy approach for predicting the protein tertiary structure describes the native state of a protein as the global minimum of an appropriate free-energy forcefield. The low-energy region of the free-energy landscape of a protein is extremely rugged. Efficient optimization methods must therefore speed up the search for the global optimum by avoiding high energy transition states, adapt large scale moves or accept unphysical intermediates. Here we investigate an evolutionary strategies(ES) for optimizing a protein conformation in our all-atom free-energy force field([1],[2]). A set of random conformations is evolved using an ES to get a diverse population containing low energy structure. The ES is shown to balance energy improvement and yet maintain diversity in structures. The ES is implemented as a master-client model for distributed computing. Starting from random structures and by using this optimization technique, we were able to fold a 20 amino-acid helical protein and 16 amino-acid beta hairpin[3]. We compare ES to basin hopping method. [1]T. Herges and W. Wenzel,Biophys.J. 87,3100(2004) [2] A. Verma and W.

These inclusion bodies, which contain the recombinant protein in an highly enriched form, can be isolated by solid/liquid separation. After solubilization, native proteins can be generated from the inactive material by using in vitro folding techniques. New folding procedures have been developed for efficient in vitro reconstitution of complex hydrophobic, multidomain, oligomeric, or highly disulfide-bonded proteins. These protocols take into account process parameters such as protein concentration, catalysis of disulfide bond formation, temperature, pH, and ionic strength, as well as specific solvent ingredients that reduce unproductive side reactions. Modification of the protein sequence has been exploited to improve in vitro folding.\n\nHeterochiral Knottin Protein: Folding and Solution Structure.\n\nPubMed\n\nMong, Surin K; Cochran, Frank V; Yu, Hongtao; Graziano, Zachary; Lin, Yu-Shan; Cochran, Jennifer R; Pentelute, Bradley L\n\n2017-10-31\n\nHomochirality is a general feature of biological macromolecules, and Nature includes few examples of heterochiral proteins. Herein, we report on the design, chemical synthesis, and structural characterization of heterochiral proteins possessing loops of amino acids of chirality opposite to that of the rest of a protein scaffold. Using the protein Ecballium elaterium trypsin inhibitor II, we discover that selective Î²-alanine substitution favors the efficient folding of our heterochiral constructs. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of one such heterochiral protein reveals a homogeneous global fold. Additionally, steered molecular dynamics simulation indicate Î²-alanine reduces the free energy required to fold the protein. We also find these heterochiral proteins to be more resistant to proteolysis than homochiral l-proteins. This work informs the design of heterochiral protein architectures containing stretches of both d- and l-amino acids.\n\nInterstitial protein alterations in rabbit vocal fold with scar.\n\nPubMed\n\nThibeault, Susan L; Bless, Diane M; Gray, Steven D\n\n2003-09-01\n\nFibrous and interstitial proteins compose the extracellular matrix of the vocal fold lamina propria and account for its biomechanic properties. Vocal fold scarring is characterized by altered biomechanical properties, which create dysphonia. Although alterations of the fibrous proteins have been confirmed in the rabbit vocal fold scar, interstitial proteins, which are known to be important in wound repair, have not been investigated to date. Using a rabbit model, interstitial proteins decorin, fibromodulin, and fibronectin were examined immunohistologically, two months postinduction of vocal fold scar by means of forcep biopsy. Significantly decreased decorin and fibromodulin with significantly increased fibronectin characterized scarred vocal fold tissue. The implications of altered interstitial proteins levels and their affect on the fibrous proteins will be discussed in relation to increased vocal fold stiffness and viscosity, which characterizes vocal fold scar.\n\nMolecular dynamics studies of protein folding and aggregation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDing, Feng\n\nThis thesis applies molecular dynamics simulations and statistical mechanics to study: (i) protein folding; and (ii) protein aggregation. Most small proteins fold into their native states via a first-order-like phase transition with a major free energy barrier between the folded and unfolded states. A set of protein conformations corresponding to the free energy barrier, Delta G >> kBT, are the folding transition state ensemble (TSE). Due to their evasive nature, TSE conformations are hard to capture (probability â exp(-DeltaG/k BT)) and characterize. A coarse-grained discrete molecular dynamics model with realistic steric constraints is constructed to reproduce the experimentally observed two-state folding thermodynamics. A kinetic approach is proposed to identify the folding TSE. A specific set of contacts, common to the TSE conformations, is identified as the folding nuclei which are necessary to be formed in order for the protein to fold. Interestingly, the amino acids at the site of the identified folding nuclei are highly conserved for homologous proteins sharing the same structures. Such conservation suggests that amino acids that are important for folding kinetics are under selective pressure to be preserved during the course of molecular evolution. In addition, studies of the conformations close to the transition states uncover the importance of topology in the construction of order parameter for protein folding transition. Misfolded proteins often form insoluble aggregates, amyloid fibrils, that deposit in the extracellular space and lead to a type of disease known as amyloidosis. Due to its insoluble and non-crystalline nature, the aggregation structure and, thus the aggregation mechanism, has yet to be uncovered. Discrete molecular dynamics studies reveal an aggregate structure with the same structural signatures as in experimental observations and show a nucleation aggregation scenario. The simulations also suggest a generic aggregation mechanism\n\nEvolution of a protein folding nucleus.\n\nPubMed\n\nXia, Xue; Longo, Liam M; Sutherland, Mason A; Blaber, Michael\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe folding nucleus (FN) is a cryptic element within protein primary structure that enables an efficient folding pathway and is the postulated heritable element in the evolution of protein architecture; however, almost nothing is known regarding how the FN structurally changes as complex protein architecture evolves from simpler peptide motifs. We report characterization of the FN of a designed purely symmetric Î²-trefoil protein by Ï-value analysis. We compare the structure and folding properties of key foldable intermediates along the evolutionary trajectory of the Î²-trefoil. The results show structural acquisition of the FN during gene fusion events, incorporating novel turn structure created by gene fusion. Furthermore, the FN is adjusted by circular permutation in response to destabilizing functional mutation. FN plasticity by way of circular permutation is made possible by the intrinsic C3 cyclic symmetry of the Î²-trefoil architecture, identifying a possible selective advantage that helps explain the prevalence of cyclic structural symmetry in the proteome.

Understanding how proteins fold requires characterization of the underlying energy landscapes as well as the dynamics of the polypeptide chains in all stages of the folding process. In recent years, important advances toward these goals have been achieved owing to the rapidly growing interdisciplinary interest and significant progress in both experimental techniques and theoretical methods. Improvements in the experimental time resolution led to determination of the timescales of the important elementary events in folding, such as formation of secondary structure and tertiary contacts. Sensitive single molecule methods made possible probing the distributions of the unfolded and folded states and following the folding reaction of individual protein molecules. Discovery of proteins that fold in microseconds opened the possibility of atomic-level theoretical simulations of folding and their direct comparisons with experimental data, as well as of direct experimental observation of the barrier-less folding transition. The ultra-fast folding also brought new questions, concerning the intrinsic limits of the folding rates and experimental signatures of barrier-less \"downhill\" folding. These problems will require novel approaches for even more detailed experimental investigations of the folding dynamics as well as for the analysis of the folding kinetic data. For theoretical simulations of folding, a main challenge is how to extract the relevant information from overwhelmingly detailed atomistic trajectories. New theoretical methods have been devised to allow a systematic approach towards a quantitative analysis of the kinetic network of folding-unfolding transitions between various configuration states of a protein, revealing the transition states and the associated folding pathways at\n\nSolitons and protein folding: An In Silico experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIlieva, N.; Dai, J.; Sieradzan, A.; Niemi, A.\n\n2015-10-01\n\nProtein folding [1] is the process of formation of a functional 3D structure from a random coil â the shape in which amino-acid chains leave the ribosome. Anfinsen's dogma states that the native 3D shape of a protein is completely determined by protein's amino acid sequence. Despite the progress in understanding the process rate and the success in folding prediction for some small proteins, with presently available physics-based methods it is not yet possible to reliably deduce the shape of a biologically active protein from its amino acid sequence. The protein-folding problem endures as one of the most important unresolved problems in science; it addresses the origin of life itself. Furthermore, a wrong fold is a common cause for a protein to lose its function or even endanger the living organism. Soliton solutions of a generalized discrete non-linear SchrÃ¶dinger equation (GDNLSE) obtained from the energy function in terms of bond and torsion angles Îº and Ï provide a constructive theoretical framework for describing protein folds and folding patterns [2]. Here we study the dynamics of this process by means of molecular-dynamics simulations. The soliton manifestation is the pattern helix-loop-helix in the secondary structure of the protein, which explains the importance of understanding loop formation in helical proteins. We performed in silico experiments for unfolding one subunit of the core structure of gp41 from the HIV envelope glycoprotein (PDB ID: 1AIK [3]) by molecular-dynamics simulations with the MD package GROMACS. We analyzed 80 ns trajectories, obtained with one united-atom and two different all-atom force fields, to justify the side-chain orientation quantification scheme adopted in the studies and to eliminate force-field based artifacts. Our results are compatible with the soliton model of protein folding and provide first insight into soliton-formation dynamics.\n\nSmall protein domains fold inside the ribosome exit tunnel.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarino, Jacopo; von Heijne, Gunnar; Beckmann, Roland\n\n2016-03-01\n\nCotranslational folding of small protein domains within the ribosome exit tunnel may be an important cellular strategy to avoid protein misfolding. However, the pathway of cotranslational folding has so far been described only for a few proteins, and therefore, it is unclear whether folding in the ribosome exit tunnel is a common feature for small protein domains. Here, we have analyzed nine small protein domains and determined at which point during translation their folding generates sufficient force on the nascent chain to release translational arrest by the SecM arrest peptide, both in vitro and in live E. coli cells. We find that all nine protein domains initiate folding while still located well within the ribosome exit tunnel.

In this article, we investigate how the reverse-sequences of native proteins might fold by examining a series of small proteins of increasing structural complexity (Î±-helix, Î²-hairpin, Î±-helix bundle, and Î±/Î²-protein). Employing a tandem protein structure prediction algorithmic and molecular dynamics simulation approach, we find that the ability of reverse sequences to adopt native-like folds is strongly influenced by protein size and the flexibility of the native hydrophobic core. For Î²-hairpins with reverse-sequences that fail to fold, we employ a simple mutational strategy for guiding stable hairpin formation that involves the insertion of amino acids into the Î²-turn region. This systematic look at reverse sequence duality sheds new light on the problem of protein sequence-structure mapping and may serve to inspire new protein design and protein structure prediction protocols.

However, for rapid analysis of the folding process, solution based approaches are often plagued with aggregation side reactions resulting in poor yields. In this work we demonstrate that a Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) chaperonin detection system can be potentially applied to identify superior refolding conditions for denatured proteins. The degree of immobilized protein folding as a function of time can be detected by monitoring the binding of the high-affinity nucleotide-free form of the chaperonin GroEL. GroEL preferentially interacts with proteins that have hydrophobic surfaces exposed in their unfolded or partially folded form so a decrease in GroEL binding can be correlated with burial of hydrophobic surfaces as folding progresses. The magnitude of GroEL binding to the protein immobilized on Bio-layer interferometry biosensor inversely reflects the extent of protein folding and hydrophobic residue burial. We demonstrate conditions where accelerated folding can be observed for the aggregation prone protein Maltodextrin glucosidase (MalZ). Superior immobilized folding conditions identified on the Bio-layer interferometry biosensor surface were reproduced on Ni-NTA sepharose bead surfaces and resulted in significant improvement in folding yields of released MalZ (measured by enzymatic activity) compared to bulk refolding conditions in solution.

Frustration is due to random and/or competing interactions. One definition of frustration is the sum of squares of the differences between actual and expected distances between characters. If this sum is non-zero, then the system is said to have frustration. A simulation tracks the movement of characters to lower their frustration. Our research is conducted on frustration as a function of temperature using a logarithmic scale. At absolute zero, the relaxation for frustration is a power function for randomly assigned patterns or an exponential function for regular patterns like Thomson figures. These findings have implications for protein folding; we attempt to apply our frustration modeling to protein folding and dynamics. We use coding in Python to simulate different ways a protein can fold. An algorithm is being developed to find the lowest frustration (and thus energy) states possible.

Much recent work has focused on developing new representations for protein sequences, called string kernels, for use with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. However, while some of these approaches exhibit state-of-the-art performance at the binary protein classification problem, i.e. discriminating between a particular protein class and all other classes, few of these studies have addressed the real problem of multi-class superfamily or fold recognition. Moreover, there are only limited software tools and systems for SVM-based protein classification available to the bioinformatics community. Results We present a new multi-class SVM-based protein fold and superfamily recognition system and web server called SVM-Fold, which can be found at . Our system uses an efficient implementation of a state-of-the-art string kernel for sequence profiles, called the profile kernel, where the underlying feature representation is a histogram of inexact matching k-mer frequencies. We also employ a novel machine learning approach to solve the difficult multi-class problem of classifying a sequence of amino acids into one of many known protein structural classes. Binary one-vs-the-rest SVM classifiers that are trained to recognize individual structural classes yield prediction scores that are not comparable, so that standard \"one-vs-all\" classification fails to perform well. Moreover, SVMs for classes at different levels of the protein structural hierarchy may make useful predictions, but one-vs-all does not try to combine these multiple predictions. To deal with these problems, our method learns relative weights between one-vs-the-rest classifiers and encodes information about the protein structural hierarchy for multi-class prediction. In large-scale benchmark results based on the SCOP database, our code weighting approach significantly improves\n\nImpact of hydrodynamic interactions on protein folding rates depends on temperature\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZegarra, Fabio C.; Homouz, Dirar; Eliaz, Yossi; Gasic, Andrei G.; Cheung, Margaret S.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe investigated the impact of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) on protein folding using a coarse-grained model. The extent of the impact of hydrodynamic interactions, whether it accelerates, retards, or has no effect on protein folding, has been controversial. Together with a theoretical framework of the energy landscape theory (ELT) for protein folding that describes the dynamics of the collective motion with a single reaction coordinate across a folding barrier, we compared the kinetic effects of HI on the folding rates of two protein models that use a chain of single beads with distinctive topologies: a 64-residue Î± /Î² chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) protein, and a 57-residue Î² -barrel Î± -spectrin Src-homology 3 domain (SH3) protein. When comparing the protein folding kinetics simulated with Brownian dynamics in the presence of HI to that in the absence of HI, we find that the effect of HI on protein folding appears to have a \"crossover\" behavior about the folding temperature. This means that at a temperature greater than the folding temperature, the enhanced friction from the hydrodynamic solvents between the beads in an unfolded configuration results in lowered folding rate; conversely, at a temperature lower than the folding temperature, HI accelerates folding by the backflow of solvent toward the folded configuration of a protein. Additionally, the extent of acceleration depends on the topology of a protein: for a protein like CI2, where its folding nucleus is rather diffuse in a transition state, HI channels the formation of contacts by favoring a major folding pathway in a complex free energy landscape, thus accelerating folding. For a protein like SH3, where its folding nucleus is already specific and less diffuse, HI matters less at a temperature lower than the folding temperature. Our findings provide further theoretical insight to protein folding kinetic experiments and simulations.\n\nMetamorphic Proteins: Emergence of Dual Protein Folds from One Primary Sequence.\n\nPubMed\n\nLella, Muralikrishna; Mahalakshmi, Radhakrishnan\n\n2017-06-20\n\nEvery amino acid exhibits a different propensity for distinct structural conformations. Hence, decoding how the primary amino acid sequence undergoes the transition to a defined secondary structure and its final three-dimensional fold is presently considered predictable with reasonable certainty. However, protein sequences that defy the first principles of secondary structure prediction (they attain two different folds) have recently been discovered. Such proteins, aptly named metamorphic proteins, decrease the conformational constraint by increasing flexibility in the secondary structure and thereby result in efficient functionality. In this review, we discuss the major factors driving the conformational switch related both to protein sequence and to structure using illustrative examples. We discuss the concept of an evolutionary transition in sequence and structure, the functional impact of the tertiary fold, and the pressure of intrinsic and external factors that give rise to metamorphic proteins. We mainly focus on the major components of protein architecture, namely, the Î±-helix and Î²-sheet segments, which are involved in conformational switching within the same or highly similar sequences. These chameleonic sequences are widespread in both cytosolic and membrane proteins, and these folds are equally important for protein structure and function. We discuss the implications of metamorphic proteins and chameleonic peptide sequences in de novo peptide design.\n\nAccurate prediction of cellular co-translational folding indicates proteins can switch from post- to co-translational folding\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNissley, Daniel A.; Sharma, Ajeet K.; Ahmed, Nabeel; Friedrich, Ulrike A.; Kramer, GÃ¼nter; Bukau, Bernd; O'Brien, Edward P.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe rates at which domains fold and codons are translated are important factors in determining whether a nascent protein will co-translationally fold and function or misfold and malfunction. Here we develop a chemical kinetic model that calculates a protein domain's co-translational folding curve during synthesis using only the domain's bulk folding and unfolding rates and codon translation rates. We show that this model accurately predicts the course of co-translational folding measured in vivo for four different protein molecules. We then make predictions for a number of different proteins in yeast and find that synonymous codon substitutions, which change translation-elongation rates, can switch some protein domains from folding post-translationally to folding co-translationallyâa result consistent with previous experimental studies. Our approach explains essential features of co-translational folding curves and predicts how varying the translation rate at different codon positions along a transcript's coding sequence affects this self-assembly process.

Predicting protein folding rate is useful for understanding protein folding process and guiding protein design. Most previous methods of predicting protein folding rate require the tertiary structure of a protein as an input. And most methods do not distinguish the different kinetic nature (two-state folding or multi-state folding) of the proteins. Here we developed a method, SeqRate, to predict both protein folding kinetic type (two-state versus multi-state) and real-value folding rate using sequence length, amino acid composition, contact order, contact number, and secondary structure information predicted from only protein sequence with support vector machines. Results We systematically studied the contributions of individual features to folding rate prediction. On a standard benchmark dataset, the accuracy of folding kinetic type classification is 80%. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the mean absolute difference between predicted and experimental folding rates (sec-1) in the base-10 logarithmic scale are 0.81 and 0.79 for two-state protein folders, and 0.80 and 0.68 for three-state protein folders. SeqRate is the first sequence-based method for protein folding type classification and its accuracy of fold rate prediction is improved over previous sequence-based methods. Its performance can be further enhanced with additional information, such as structure-based geometric contacts, as inputs. Conclusions Both the web server and software of predicting folding rate are publicly available at http://casp.rnet.missouri.edu/fold_rate/index.html.

To check the validity of such improvements, we chose the ultrafast folding protein Engrailed Homeodomain as an example and explored several aspects of its folding. The engrailed homeodomain is a mainly alpha-helical protein of 61 residues from Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the simplified model of Engrailed Homeodomain can fold into a global minimum state with a tertiary structure in good agreement with its native structure.\n\nExperimental investigation of protein folding and misfolding.\n\nPubMed\n\nDobson, Christopher M\n\n2004-09-01\n\nNewly synthesised proteins need to fold, often to intricate and close-packed structures, in order to function. The underlying mechanism by which this complex process takes place both in vitro and in vivo is now becoming understood, at least in general terms, as a result of the application of a wide range of biophysical and computational methods used in combination with the techniques of biochemistry and protein engineering. It is increasingly apparent, however, that folding is not only crucial for generating biological activity, but that it is also coupled to a wide range of processes within the cell, ranging from the trafficking of proteins to specific organelles to the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Not surprisingly, therefore, the failure of proteins to fold appropriately, or to remain correctly folded, is associated with a large number of cellular malfunctions that give rise to disease. Misfolding, and its consequences such as aggregation, can be investigated by extending the types of techniques used to study the normal folding process. Application of these techniques is enabling the development of a unified description of the interconversion and regulation of the different conformational states available to proteins in living systems. Such a description proves a generic basis for understanding the fundamental links between protein misfolding and its associated clinical disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Type II diabetes, and for exploring novel therapeutic strategies directed at their prevention and treatment on a rational basis.\n\nDodging the crisis of folding proteins with knots\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSulkowska, Joanna\n\n2009-03-01\n\nProteins with nontrivial topology, containing knots and slipknots, have the ability to fold to their native states without any additional external forces invoked. A mechanism is suggested for folding of these proteins, such as YibK and YbeA, which involves an intermediate configuration with a slipknot. It elucidates the role of topological barriers and backtracking during the folding event. It also illustrates that native contacts are sufficient to guarantee folding in around 1-2% of the simulations, and how slipknot intermediates are needed to reduce the topological bottlenecks. As expected, simulations of proteins with similar structure but with knot removed fold much more efficiently, clearly demonstrating the origin of these topological barriers. Although these studies are based on a simple coarse-grained model, they are already able to extract some of the underlying principles governing folding in such complex topologies.\n\nReplica exchange molecular dynamics simulation of structure variation from Î±/4Î²-fold to 3Î±-fold protein.\n\nPubMed\n\nLazim, Raudah; Mei, Ye; Zhang, Dawei\n\n2012-03-01\n\nReplica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation provides an efficient conformational sampling tool for the study of protein folding. In this study, we explore the mechanism directing the structure variation from Î±/4Î²-fold protein to 3Î±-fold protein after mutation by conducting REMD simulation on 42 replicas with temperatures ranging from 270 K to 710 K. The simulation began from a protein possessing the primary structure of GA88 but the tertiary structure of GB88, two G proteins with \"high sequence identity.\" Albeit the large CÎ±-root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the folded protein (4.34 Ã at 270 K and 4.75 Ã at 304 K), a variation in tertiary structure was observed. Together with the analysis of secondary structure assignment, cluster analysis and principal component, it provides insights to the folding and unfolding pathway of 3Î±-fold protein and Î±/4Î²-fold protein respectively paving the way toward the understanding of the ongoings during conformational variation.\n\nDesigning pH induced fold switch in proteins\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaruah, Anupaul; Biswas, Parbati\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThis work investigates the computational design of a pH induced protein fold switch based on a self-consistent mean-field approach by identifying the ensemble averaged characteristics of sequences that encode a fold switch. The primary challenge to balance the alternative sets of interactions present in both target structures is overcome by simultaneously optimizing two foldability criteria corresponding to two target structures. The change in pH is modeled by altering the residual charge on the amino acids. The energy landscape of the fold switch protein is found to be double funneled. The fold switch sequences stabilize the interactions of the sites with similar relative surface accessibility in both target structures. Fold switch sequences have low sequence complexity and hence lower sequence entropy. The pH induced fold switch is mediated by attractive electrostatic interactions rather than hydrophobic-hydrophobic contacts. This study may provide valuable insights to the design of fold switch proteins.\n\nPractical Approaches to Protein Folding and Assembly\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWalters, Jad; Milam, Sara L.; Clark, A. Clay\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe describe here the use of several spectroscopies, such as fluorescence emission, circular dichroism, and differential quenching by acrylamide, in examining the equilibrium and kinetic folding of proteins. The first section regarding equilibrium techniques provides practical information for determining the conformational stability of a protein. In addition, several equilibrium-folding models are discussed, from two-state monomer to four-state homodimer, providing a comprehensive protocol for interpretation of folding curves. The second section focuses on the experimental design and interpretation of kinetic data, such as burst-phase analysis and exponential fits, used in elucidating kinetic folding pathways. In addition, simulation programs are used routinely to support folding models generated by kinetic experiments, and the fundamentals of simulations are covered.

The folding/unfolding transitions of many proteins occur, however, in multiple discrete steps associated with the formation of intermediates, which is indicative of reduced cooperativity. Furthermore, much advancement in experimental and computational approaches has demonstrated entirely nonâcooperative (gradual) transitions via a continuum of states and a multitude of small energetic barriers between the N and U states of some proteins. These findings have been instrumental towards providing a structural rationale for cooperative versus noncooperative transitions, based on the coupling between interaction networks in proteins. The cooperativity inherent in a folding/unfolding reaction appears to be context dependent, and can be tuned via experimental conditions which change the stabilities of N and U. The evolution of cooperativity in protein folding transitions is linked closely to the evolution of function as well as the aggregation propensity of the protein. A large activation energy barrier in a fully cooperative transition can provide the kinetic control required to prevent the accumulation of partially unfolded forms, which may promote aggregation. Nevertheless, increasing evidence for barrierâless âdownhillâ folding, as well as for continuous âuphillâ unfolding transitions, indicate that gradual nonâcooperative processes may be ubiquitous features on the free energy landscape of protein folding.

This involves recording all unphysical crossing events of a ghost chain, and calculating the minimal uncrossing cost that would have been required to avoid such events. A depth-first tree search algorithm is applied to find minimal transformations to fold , , , and knotted proteins. In all cases, the extra uncrossing/non-crossing distance is a small fraction of the total distance travelled by a ghost chain. Different structural classes may be distinguished by the amount of extra uncrossing distance, and the effectiveness of such discrimination is compared with other order parameters. It was seen that non-crossing distance over chain length provided the best discrimination between structural and kinetic classes. The scaling of non-crossing distance with chain length implies an inevitable crossover to entanglement-dominated folding mechanisms for sufficiently long chains. We further quantify the minimal folding pathways by collecting the sequence of uncrossing moves, which generally involve leg, loop, and elbow-like uncrossing moves, and rendering the collection of these moves over the unfolded ensemble as a multiple-transformation âalignmentâ. The consensus minimal pathway is constructed and shown schematically for representative cases of an , , and knotted protein. An overlap parameter is defined between pathways; we find that proteins have minimal overlap indicating diverse folding pathways, knotted proteins are highly constrained to follow a dominant pathway, and proteins are somewhere in between. Thus we have shown how topological chain constraints can induce dominant pathway mechanisms in protein folding.

The nature of this assistance, however, remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that unfolding of a substrate protein by GroEL enhances protein folding. We first show that capture of a protein on the open ring of a GroELâADPâGroES complex, GroELâs physiological acceptor state for non-native proteins in vivo, leaves the substrate protein in an unexpectedly compact state. Subsequent binding of ATP to the same GroEL ring causes rapid, forced unfolding of the substrate protein. Notably, the fraction of the substrate protein that commits to the native state following GroES binding and protein release into the GroELâGroES cavity is proportional to the extent of substrate-protein unfolding. Forced protein unfolding is thus a central component of the multilayered stimulatory mechanism used by GroEL to drive protein folding.

According to the theory, the energy landscape of protein folding is funneled toward the native state, a conformational state that is consistent with the principle of minimal frustration. It has been accepted that real proteins are selected through natural evolution, satisfying the minimum frustration criterion. However, there is evidence that a low degree of frustration accelerates folding. We examined the interplay between topological and energetic protein frustration. We employed a CÎ± structure-based model for simulations with a controlled nonspecific energetic frustration added to the potential energy function. Thermodynamics and kinetics of a group of 19 proteins are completely characterized as a function of increasing level of energetic frustration. We observed two well-separated groups of proteins: one group where a little frustration enhances folding rates to an optimal value and another where any energetic frustration slows down folding. Protein energetic frustration regimes and their mechanisms are explained by the role of non-native contact interactions in different folding scenarios. These findings strongly correlate with the protein free-energy folding barrier and the absolute contact order parameters. These computational results are corroborated by principal component analysis and partial least square techniques. One simple theoretical model is proposed as a useful tool for experimentalists to predict the limits of improvements in real proteins.

The algorithm is engineered to incorporate a discrete codification of local steric hindrances that constrain the movements of the peptide backbone throughout the folding process. Thus, the torsional state of the chain is assumed to be conditioned by the fact that hopping from one basin of attraction to another in the Ramachandran map (local potential energy surface) of each residue is energetically more costly than the search for a specific (Î¦, Î¨) torsional state within a single basin. A combinatorial procedure is introduced to evaluate coarsely defined torsional states of the chain defined ``modulo basins'' and translate them into meaningful patterns of long range interactions. Thus, an algorithm for structure prediction is designed based on the fact that local contributions to the potential energy may be subsumed into time-evolving conformational constraints defining sets of restricted backbone geometries whereupon the patterns of nonbonded interactions are constructed. The predictive power of the algorithm is assessed by (a) computing ab initio folding pathways for mammalian ubiquitin that ultimately yield a stable structural pattern reproducing all of its native features, (b) determining the nucleating event that triggers the hydrophobic collapse of the chain, and (c) comparing coarse predictions of the stable folds of moderately large proteins (N~100) with structural information extracted from the protein data bank.\n\nFrom laws of inference to protein folding dynamics.\n\nPubMed\n\nTseng, Chih-Yuan; Yu, Chun-Ping; Lee, H C\n\n2010-08-01\n\nProtein folding dynamics is one of major issues constantly investigated in the study of protein functions. The molecular dynamic (MD) simulation with the replica exchange method (REM) is a common theoretical approach considered. Yet a trade-off in applying the REM is that the dynamics toward the native configuration in the simulations seems lost. In this work, we show that given REM-MD simulation results, protein folding dynamics can be directly derived from laws of inference. The applicability of the resulting approach, the entropic folding dynamics, is illustrated by investigating a well-studied Trp-cage peptide. Our results are qualitatively comparable with those from other studies. The current studies suggest that the incorporation of laws of inference and physics brings in a comprehensive perspective on exploring the protein folding dynamics.\n\nCoarse-grained sequences for protein folding and design\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBrown, Scott; Fawzi, Nicolas J.; Head-Gordon, Teresa\n\n2003-01-01\n\nWe present the results of sequence design on our off-lattice minimalist model in which no specification of native-state tertiary contacts is needed. We start with a sequence that adopts a target topology and build on it through sequence mutation to produce new sequences that comprise distinct members within a target fold class. In this work, we use the Î±/Î² ubiquitin fold class and design two new sequences that, when characterized through folding simulations, reproduce the differences in folding mechanism seen experimentally for proteins L and G. The primary implication of this work is that patterning of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues is the physical origin for the success of relative contact-order descriptions of folding, and that these physics-based potentials provide a predictive connection between free energy landscapes and amino acid sequence (the original protein folding problem). We present results of the sequence mapping from a 20- to the three-letter code for determining a sequence that folds into the WW domain topology to illustrate future extensions to protein design.
