It has become a compulsory requirement in most professions to be able to use computer software. The first computer invented was the ENIAC in 1943 which was the same size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern PCs. Modern computers which are based on integrated circuits are small enough to fit into mobile devices. One of the most compacted computers out right now are table computers with the most popular being the IPad, but even that is 9.1inch and weighing about 700grams. But imagine having a computer that will fit into your pencil case. The P-ISM (Pen-style Personal Networking Gadget Package) consists of a package of 5 pens that all have unique functions, combining together to create a virtual computing experience.\n\nAbstract This document has been prepared in the ESPRIT BRA No. 8579, Multimodal Integration for Advanced Multimedia Interfaces—in the following referred to as MIAMI—in order to serve as a basis for future work. The basic terms which will be used in MIAMI will be defined and an overview on man-machine-interfaces will be given.\n\nComputational support for sketching has a long and interesting history dating back to the early days of computing. Computational Support for Sketching in Design: A Review takes a brief look at the origins and history of the subject before going on to survey the literature from a wide variety of sources on modern sketch based design tools. It first describes the practical basis of sketching؟، why people sketch, what significance it has in design and problem solving, and the cognitive activities it supports."
