        "text": "93-Year-Old Masters Track and Field WR Holder Hiroo Tanaka: \"Everyone has Unexplored Intrinsic Abilities\"\n\nIn the midst of a lot of talk about how to keep the aging population young, there are people with long lives who are showing extraordinary physical abilities. One of them is Hiroo Tanaka, 93, a multiple world champion in masters track and field.\n\nTanaka began running when he was 60, before which he'd never competed in his adult life. \"He's so fast he's world-class.\" \"His running form is so beautiful. It's like he's flying.\" Tanaka trains at an indoor track in Aomori five days a week. Asked about him, that's the kind of thing the people there say.\n\nTanaka holds multiple masters track and field world records, where age is divided into five-year groups. Last year at the World Masters Track and Field Championships in Poland he set a new world record of 38.79 for 200 m in the M90 class (men's 90-94 age group). People around the world were amazed at the time, which was almost unbelievable for a 92-year-old.\n\nAfter retiring from his job as an elementary school teacher when he was 60, Tanaka took up competitive running. Before that he'd been the one making the kids compete on school sports days and in P.E. classes. About six months before he retired he read about masters track and field in the newspaper. The story reminded him of how he'd run when he was in school, and he decided to give it a go.\n\nHe started training alone early in the morning in the empty schoolyard, and in the summer of the year he turned 60 ran his first race at a meet in Aomori. Running the 100 m, he was stunned to see the back of an athlete two years older than him who'd started next to him.\n\nHe trained regularly and began to set records, and at age 70 won 400 m gold at the World Masters Championships in Australia. \"It was like I had opened a box and found treasure inside,\" he says. \"I wondered if I was really good enough to be accepted as part of the sport at the international level, whether it was all a dream.\"\n\nAt the age of 71 Tanaka set a PB of 13.44 for 100 m. It's normal for the body to lose muscular strength, running ability, and overall physical condition as it ages. \"But in my case I was still improving,\" he says. \"Why? I had thought it was because I was training well, but lately I've started thinking about it differently. I think it's because I had latent ability that I'd never developed, and that when I started working out regularly it came into bloom. If I hadn't started running, my life would have ended without me having found out what I could really do. I'm really glad that I did, and the confidence I gained has kept me going and led to the results I've produced. I think everyone has unexplored intrinsic abilities that have the potential to flower. That's why I tell everyone they should knock on the door inside themselves and take on whatever they find on the other side.\"\n\nAfter a few years of smooth sailing, Tanaka was forced to take two years off when he was 73 to get treatment for an Achilles tendon injury, shingles, and heart problems. \"I wondered if it was all over,\" he remembers, \"but I told myself, 'No, you can still achieve something,' and started over.\"\n\nTanaka lives with his wife Kazuko. He wakes up at 4:00 a.m., reads the newspaper for an hour, then takes a nap until 7:00 a.m. In the morning he stretches and does weight training at the indoor track, and after lunch and a nap he does record-keeping work and does cross-country running and walking with groups he organizes. He gets into bed at 8:00 p.m. and watches the news, then goes to sleep around midnight.\n\nSince turning 90, Tanaka has started to feel the effects of aging. \"But I still want to keep at it until I'm 95,\" he says. \"My friends say they want to run a relay with me after I turn 95 so we can go for the world record. Nobody has set a relay world record in the 95-99 age group yet, so we all have an agreement not to get sick or die before that even if we have an accident. As you get older your body changes, but we want to minimize that as much as we can. The most important thing you can do is regular movement, every day.\"\n\nTanaka and his wife live on the 13th floor of a large apartment building. Whenever he goes out he takes the stairs down instead of using the elevator. When he comes home he climbs the stairs up to the 4th floor without any problems. He puts a lot of effort into cleaning the floor with a mop, which helps his hips and legs. He leaves himself notes so that he won't forget things. \"I see these things as helping slow down the aging process,\" he says. \"That process happens at a different rate for everyone. How do you put the brakes on it? I don't know if my brakes are that strong, but I'm pushing on them as hard as I can. But I'm not really trying to fight against getting old. It's more like I'm trying to come in for a soft landing, like a glider.\"\n\nOne of the main questions Tanaka always gets is about what he eats. \"I don't have any kind of special diet,\" he says. \"I just keep eating the way I have my whole life. The key to staying healthy is moving your body, talking to other people, and enjoying each day.\" It's also important, he says, to set goals. The key thing is to set ones that are achievable but not guaranteed to succeed.\n\nIn August the World Masters Track and Field Championships will happen in Sweden, and the dates are already circled on Tanaka's calendar. \"I've never had any problems with jet lag,\" he laughs. \"I said 95 was my goal, but to be honest lately I've been wondering the tiniest bit what kind of records I could set at 100. I just need to keep staying healthy. They say that the elderly today are 5 to 10 years younger than they were 10 or 20 years ago.\"\n\nThe Japan Gerontological Society made that announcement in 2015 based on the results of its analysis of the physical and intellectual functions and overall condition of people aged 65 and older. In 2017, in conjunction with the Japan Geriatrics Society it proposed raising the definition of elderly from 65+ to 75+. Age 90+ would be called \"super elderly.\" Annual results in scoring on physical testing done by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology show that the scored of those in the 65+ are trending upward, confirming Tanaka's suggestion that the elderly are getting younger.\n\nsource article:\n\nLabels\n\nParis Olympics marathon team member Akira Akasaki is the first man from Kumamoto to make an Olympic marathon since the father of Japanese marathoning Shizo Kanakuri 100 years ago. Akasaki finished 2nd in October's Olympic marathon trials to make the Paris team, only the second man from Kumamoto prefecture to ever make an Olympic marathon team after Kanakuri at the 1924 Paris Olympics. On Nov. 6 Akasaki visited the town of Tamana in Kumamoto to pay his respects at the great Kanakuri's grave. At Tamana City Hall he was greeted by applause from city workers. Akasaki's coach at the Kyudenko corporate team, Kazuharu Takai , and his Takushoku University -era coach Masahiro Okada , were also in attendance to celebrate his achievement. Afterward Akasaki visited Kanakuri's grave to pay his respects and inform the legend's spirit that he will be running in the Olympics too. \"Kanakuri was the creator of the Hakone Ekiden, and I was lucky to run it four times,\" sai\n\nWith renewed confidence, Japan's Olympic marathon team will face the total 438 m elevation difference hills of Paris this summer. The members of the women's and men's marathon teams for August's Paris Olympics appeared at a press conference in Tokyo on Mar. 25 in conjunction with the Japan Marathon Championship Series III (JMC) awards gala. Women's Olympic trials winner Yuka Suzuki (Daiichi Seimei) said she was riding a wave of motivation in the wake of the new women's national record. When she watched Honami Maeda (Tenmaya) set the record at January's Osaka International Women's Marathon on TV, Suzuki said she was, \"absolutely stunned.\" Her coach Sachiko Yamashita told her afterward, \"When someone breaks the NR, things change,\" and Suzuki found herself saying, \"I want to take my shot.\" After training for a great run in Paris, she said, \"I definitely want to break the NR in one of my marathons after that.\" Mao\n\nA 20-year-old man has been arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a female runner along the banks of the Tama River in Ota Ward, Tokyo. \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go for a walk and move my body a bit,\" the man told police. Local resident Hirai Muroyama , 20, of no known occupation, was arrested on charges of sexual assault. He is accused of acts including grabbing the breasts of a woman in her 20s at around 10 p.m. on May 31 along the banks of the Tama River. According to police, the woman was taking a break in her run when Muroyama approached her silently from behind and grabbed her breasts before running away. Under police interrogation Muroyama told investigators, \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go out for a walk and move my body. I'd had a few drinks and was feeling pretty hype. She was totally my type.\" source article: https://news.tbs.co.jp/newseye/tbs_newsey"
