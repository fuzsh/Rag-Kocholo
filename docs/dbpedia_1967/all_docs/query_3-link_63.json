L. R. Brien, P. A. R. Ade, P. S. Barry, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe Mexico-UK Submillimetre Camera for AsTronomy (MUSCAT) is a 1.1 mm receiver consisting of 1,500 lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) for the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT; Volcán Sierra Negra in Puebla, México). MUSCAT utilises the maximum field of view of the LMT's upgraded 50-metre primary mirror and is the first México-UK collaboration to deploy a millimetre/sub-mm receiver on the Large Millimeter Telescope. Using a simplistic simulator, we estimate a predicted mapping speed for MUSCAT by combining the measured performance of MUSCAT with the observed sky conditions at the LMT. We compare this to a previously calculated bolometric-model mapping speed and find that our mapping speed is in good agreement when this is scaled by a previously reported empirical factor. Through this simulation we show that signal contamination due to sky fluctuations can be effectively removed through the use of principle component analysis. We also give an overview\n\nOptics I\n\nPlanar silicon metamaterial lenslet arrays for millimeter-wavelength imaging\n\nChristopher M. McKenney, Jason E. Austermann, James A. Beall, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nWe are developing planar lenslet arrays for millimeter-wavelength imaging using metamaterials microlithically fabricated using silicon wafers. We describe the design process for a gradient-index (GRIN) metamaterial lenslet using metal-mesh patterned on silicon and a combination of metal-mesh and etched-hole metamaterial anti-reflection layers. We optimize the design using a bulk-material model to rapidly simulate and iterate on the lenslet design. We fabricated prototype GRIN metamaterial lenslet array and mounted it on a Polarbear/Simons Array 90/150 GHz band transition edge sensor (TES) bolometer detector array with sinuous planar antennas. Beam measurements of a prototype lenslet array agree reasonably well with the model simulations. We plan to further optimize the design and combine it with a broadband anti-reflection coating to achieve operation over 70–350 GHz bandwidth. Applications include measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and sub millimeter astrophysics.\n\nCameras and Polarimeters II\n\nDetector Arrays I\n\nSpectrometers I\n\nDetector Arrays II\n\nSpectrometers II\n\nCoherent Detection: Receivers\n\nCoherent Detection: Systems\n\nReadout and Multiplexing\n\nFuture CMB Instruments\n\nCMB Instruments I\n\nBroadband polarimeter receivers at 30 and 40 GHz for cosmic microwave background measurement\n\nE. Artal, B. Aja, L. de la Fuente, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nBroadband radiometers at 30 and 40 GHz for QUIJOTE radio astronomy experiment are very sensitive receivers to perform scientific sky observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The aim of this experiment is the linear polarization percentage measurement of the received signals. Radiometers have cryogenically cooled Front-End Modules followed by room temperature amplification, correlation and detection modules. Their relative bandwidth is around 30%. There are 30 receivers (pixels) at 30 GHz and 29 receivers at 40 GHz. The radiometer scheme is based on two balanced branches, microwave correlation and direct detection. The manufactured receivers measure Stokes polarization parameters I, Q, and U simultaneously. This paper describes the principle of operation of polarimeter receivers, and present details of manufactured subsystems, integration and test results. Receivers integrate different technologies: waveguides, microstrip, Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMIC) and active and passive devices. The receivers are currently under installation in El Teide Observatory, Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain).\n\nCMB Instruments II\n\nOptics II\n\nDetector Arrays III\n\nPoster Session: Detector Arrays I\n\nPoster Session: Readout and Multiplexing\n\nPoster Session: Detector Arrays II\n\nMeasurements of AlMn TES bolometers well described by simple electrothermal model\n\nSamantha Walker, Jason E. Austermann, James A. Beall, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nCosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments utilize arrays of low temperature detectors, such as superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers. Voltage-biased TES bolometers must be embedded in a readout circuit that allows for stable operation. To ensure stability and to test our physical and electrothermal model of these devices, measurements aimed at characterizing the dynamics of the sensor over the range of detector bias and loading conditions relevant to our application are carried out for multiple bolometer designs. In this work, we present bolometer electrothermal properties derived from current-voltage curves, effective electrothermal time constant measurements, and complex impedance measurements of AlMn TES bolometers intended for the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT). All bolometers consist of 385nm thick 1400 ppma AlMn film with measured superconducting critical temperature Tc = 480 mK. The bolometers are well-described by a simple, one-pole electrothermal model with a natural time constant τ0 that we adjust by varying the leg geometry and the amount of PdAu thermal ballast on the bolometer island. From these measurements, we determine that the volumetric heat capacity of sputtered PdAu (atomic percentages 67.6%/32.4%) at 480mK is 0.22 fJ/(K·μm3). Finally, we present the TES parameters as a function of operational resistance and over a range of loading conditions.\n\nPoster Session: CMB Instruments\n\nAnalysis of Temperature-to-Polarization Leakage in BICEP3 and Keck CMB Data from 2016 to 2018\n\nT. St. Germaine, P. A. R. Ade, Z. Ahmed, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe Bicep/Keck Array experiment is a series of small-aperture refracting telescopes observing degree-scale Cosmic Microwave Background polarization from the South Pole in search of a primordial B-mode signature. As a pair differencing experiment, an important systematic that must be controlled is the differential beam response between the co-located, orthogonally polarized detectors. We use high-fidelity, in-situ measurements of the beam response to estimate the temperature-to-polarization (T → P) leakage in our latest data including observations from 2016 through 2018. This includes three years of Bicep3 observing at 95 GHz, and multifrequency data from Keck Array. Here we present band-averaged far-field beam maps, differential beam mismatch, and residual beam power (after filtering out the leading difference modes via deprojection) for these receivers. We show preliminary results of \"beam map simulations,\" which use these beam maps to observe a simulated temperature (no Q/U) sky to estimate T → P leakage in our real data.\n\nPoster Session: Mm/submm/far-IR Instrumentation\n\nPoster Session: New Developments\n\nPoster Session: Spectrometers\n\nPoster Session: Coherent Detection: mm/submm/THz\n\nPoster Session: Coherent Detection: Radio\n\nThe potential for a K-band receiver on the Large Millimeter Telescope\n\nStanley E. Kurtz, Tinus Stander, Dirk I. L. de Villiers, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe 50-meter Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) operating on the Sierra Negra in Mexico is the largest single- dish millimeter-wave telescope in the world. Although designed to work in the 3 mm and 1 mm bands, there is significant potential for LMT observations at centimeter wavelengths. Here, we summarize the scientific case and operational arguments for a K-band receiver system on the LMT, describe several of the unique technical challenges that the proposed installation would entail, and mention some possible solutions to these challenges.\n\nPoster Session: Optics\n\nMetal mesh IR filter for wSMA\n\nChao-Te Li, C.-Y. E. Tong, Ming-Jye Wang, et al.\n\nShow abstract\n\nSince the start of full science operations from 2004, the Submillimeter Array has been implementing plans to expand IF bandwidths and upgrade receivers and cryostats. Metal mesh low-pass filters were designed to block infrared (IR) radiation to reduce the thermal load on the cryostats. Filters were fabricated on a quartz wafer through photolithography and coated with anti-reflection (AR) material. The filters were tested from 200 to 400 GHz to verify their passband performances. The measurement results were found to be in good agreement with EM simulation results. They were tested in the far-infrared (FIR) frequency range to verify out-of-band rejection. The IR reflectivity was found to be approximately 70%, which corresponded to the percentage of the area blocked by metal."
