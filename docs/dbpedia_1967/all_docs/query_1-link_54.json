        "text": "Japan's sports papers are saying the ownership of the Tokyo Yakult Swallows is indicating the team is leaning toward posting two star players for major league availability following the 2006 season. Third baseman Akinori Iwamura and lefty reliever Hirotoshi Ishii are the guys who may be put up for auction in November.\n\nThe Nikkan Sports, in its Aug. 15 edition, published a caricature drawing of the images of both players, their heads sticking out of a Japanese-style mail box (posting --get it?), beside which is depicted a sketch of Swallows player-manager Atsuya Furuta shedding tears over the possibility of losing a couple of his best performers.\n\nIwamura had a so-so first half this season following recovery from a hamstring injury sustained in the World Baseball Classic in March, but he's the guy who tied a team record with 44 home runs in 2004. He's also been as hot as the weather lately, with 11 homers in his first 15 games during August, and his season batting stats through games of Aug. 18 include 26 home runs, 58 RBIs and a .305 average."
