Finish Line doesn’t just sell shoes, they also make off-season lists.

This list ranks the best picks at each NBA Draft spot since 1985 and 3 former Kentucky Wildcats made the list.

Take a look at the 3 below:

#29. Honorable Mention: Nazr Mohammed (1998)

By: Utah Jazz

Shoving LeBron to the floor is a quick way to get noticed in this league, and that’s exactly what Nazr did in a meeting between Chicago and Miami a few years back. A two time NCAA champion and one time NBA Champion, Nazr has played big roles for every team he has played for.

#23 Honorable Mention: Tayshaun Prince (2002)

By: Detroit Pistons

California Mr. Basketball, Tayshaun Prince, won the NBA championship in 2004 with the Detroit Pistons and another member of this list. He just missed the cut on four All-Defensive First Teams, but was voted to four All-Defensive Second Teams. Prince is the only player in NBA history to score more points in the playoffs than he did in the regular season.

#21 Rajon Rondo (2006)

By: Phoenix Suns

Before the drama in Sacramento, Rajon Rondo was an up and comer in the point guard scene. A NBA champion in 2008, four time NBA All-Star, and made the NBA All-Defensive First Team two times. Adding to that, Rondo led the NBA in assists for three years and steals for one.
