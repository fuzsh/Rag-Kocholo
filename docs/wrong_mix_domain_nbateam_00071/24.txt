When Nazr Mohammed first arrived on UK’s campus in 1995, he stuck out like a sore thumb. At 6’10 and 315-pounds, he was by far the largest center prospect that then head coach Rick Pitino had ever recruited. Many felt he would never become an effective player in Pitino’s fast-paced system. In Kentucky’s 1996 NCAA Championship season, Nazr played a very limited role, while working hard on his body and conditioning. The following year, now sporting a slimmer physique, Nazr played an intricate part in helping the Wildcats make a deep tournament run once again, eventually losing to Arizona in the 1997 NCAA title game. 1998 would be Mohammed’s year, as the once 315-pound center helped lead Kentucky to it’s seventh National Championship with the team that would become known as the Comeback Cats. He started the final 27 games of the season, and earned 1st Team All-SEC honors after averaging 12.0ppg, 7.2rpg, and 1.9bpg. Along the way Mohammed had some very memorable moments, like nailing this shot against Vanderbilt at the buzzer. Mohammed declared for the NBA Draft following his junior season. Nazr was selected 29th in the first round of the 1998 NBA Draft by the Utah Jazz. Now in his 14th season, Mohammed has had a very long and productive career in the NBA, and plans to become an MMA fighter (just kidding). He has played on 7 different teams and holds career averages of 6.8ppg and 5.2rpg. Nazr is currently in his second season with the Oklahoma City Thunder.
