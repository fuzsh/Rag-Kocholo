The Utah Jazz currently own the 10th, 29th, and 32nd picks in the 2024 NBA draft. As such, it may be helpful to conduct thoughtful analysis on the history of their selections at those spots in previous years. It is as follows:

Pick 29: Nazr Mohammed. The Jazz traded his rights to the Sixers for a 1st-rounder which eventually became Quincy Lewis.

End of list.

It’s quite possible that the Jazz will trade up or down a few spots depending on how draft night goes, so let’s look at the 10th, 29th, and 32nd picks +/- 2, ranked by VORP. First, a refresher on what VORP is, courtesy of Basketball Reference:

VORP - Value Over Replacement Player (available since the 1973-74 season in the NBA); a box score estimate of the points per 100 TEAM possessions that a player contributed above a replacement-level (-2.0) player, translated to an average team and prorated to an 82-game season. Multiply by 2.70 to convert to wins over replacement. Please see the article About Box Plus/Minus (BPM) for more information.

While not a perfect metric, VORP does an adequate job of quickly racking and stacking players.

The Top Ten

1. Rudy Gobert, 27th pick, 2013

Under-appreciated even by Jazz fans at times, the Stifle Tower worked his way up from a lanky, raw prospect to 3x DPOY. He soon became an absolute menace in the paint, forcing teams to change their entire offensive gameplans to account for him. He truly loved Utah, but it was time to move on in 2022: The Jazz traded him to Minnesota for a haul that was roundly mocked by the NBA twittersphere (x-o’sphere?) at the time. However, he continued his winning ways there and was a critical part of their playoff run, which ended in the Western Conference Finals.

2. Gordon Hayward, 9th pick, 2010

Ah, 2009-10. We at SLC Dunk named this pick, owed to the Jazz via the New York Knicks, “The Precious.” Many a gamethread was spent hate-following Knicks games and speculating over which rookie would lead the team to greatness the following year. Turns out that it was Gordon. And the fans at the EnergySolutions Arena watch party booed the pick. Yeah, we could have had Paul George for awhile. But other than him, nobody below the 10th pick even made an all-star game.

3. C.J. Miles

C.J. Miles was the last player drafted by the Jazz straight from high school. He was a guard with a talent for slashing who always wanted to play like a three-point shooting small forward, but he had neither the size nor the shot to do so.

4. Alec Burks, 12th pick, 2011

There are several big question marks in Jazz history. What if Eisley’s three had counted? What if Jordan’s shot didn’t count? Etc. But one that I’ve always wondered about is this: What if Paul Pierce never took a cheap shot at Alec Burks? He was a dynamic shooting guard who was showing a lot of promise, and he was never quite the same after his injury. Thankfully he was still able to have a productive career—but as a role player, not a star.

5. Greg Ostertag, 28th pick, 1995

With his 7’2” frame and signature crew cut, ‘Tag was a very serviceable center for the Jazz for 9 years. He was never a star, but he took up space and was good for a laugh at times.

6. Trey Lyles, 12th pick, 2015

Lesson learned: Don’t draft a guy who doesn’t like three-hour practices. Trey turned into a serviceable NBA player, but while he was in Utah he underperformed. That stung a little extra that year, because Devin Booker was drafted 13th. The best thing he did for the team was serve as a trade piece in the Donovan Mitchell deal.

7. Scott Padgett, 1999, 28th pick

1998 was a rough year for Utah sports fans. The Jazz lost to the Bulls in the NBA Finals and the Runnin’ Utes got their hearts broken in the NCAA Tournament Championship by Scott Padgett’s Kentucky Wildcats. The Jazz drafted him a year later, and he...well, he played for them through 2003 and stuck around in the NBA through 2007. He’s now head coach for Mississippi State and appears to be happy.

8. Trey Burke, 9th pick, 2013

Many Jazz fans thought Trey Burke was the Point Guard of the Future. He was fresh off a deep NCAA Tournament run, he won the Bob Cousy Award, (best collegiate point guard) and he appeared to have good court vision, a decent shot off the dribble, and a fair bit of speed. Maybe it was a product of being coached by Tyrone Corbin, maybe it was the fact that he was undersized for an NBA guard, but his time in Utah ultimately ended in disappointment.

9. Tony Bradley, 28th pick, 2017

Players drafted in the late first round are often described as “raw.” Tony Bradley was no exception. He never panned out for the Jazz or any other team. He had a 6-year career which mostly consisted of being an 11th or 12th man used for absorbing a few fouls.

10. James Hardy, 11th pick, 1978

James Hardy was drafted by the New Orleans Jazz. He was a forward who averaged around 6 points per game over his four-year career.

The Rest

11. Udoka Azubuike, 27th pick, 2020

12. Taylor Hendricks, 9th pick, 2023

13. Danny Schayes, 13th pick, 1981

14. Howard Wood, 27th pick, 1981

17. Walter Palmer, 33rd pick, 1990

15. Brice Sensabaugh, 28th pick, 2023

16. Aaron James, 28th pick, 1974

17. Jacque Vaughn, 27th pick, 1997

Obviously the book is not yet closed on Taylor Hendricks or Brice Sensabaugh. They both had respectable rookie seasons and will likely see the floor even more during the 2024-25 season.

For those curious, here are the top 25 players across the NBA drafted from 8-12 or 27-34. It includes players such as Dirk Nowitzki, Reggie Miller, Vlade Divac, and Tony Parker. All data is from Basketball Reference.

As far as the 2024 draft goes, the conventional wisdom applies: Expect the Jazz to draft a serviceable rotation player like C.J. Miles. Hope that they will draft a star like Rudy Gobert, or even a borderline star like Gordon Hayward. Pray that they don’t miss and draft Udoka Azubuike or Scott Padgett.
