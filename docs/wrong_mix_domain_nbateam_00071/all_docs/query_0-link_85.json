        "text": "KNICK NOTES\n\nThe Knicks’ starting center battle between Nazr Mohammed and Vin Baker still is being fought in the trenches, with Lenny Wilkens saying he needs to see more rebounding from incumbent Mohammed.\n\nMohammed started the first two preseason games but had only nine points and four rebounds in 28 uninspired minutes. Wilkens said he likely will do some lineup tinkering on this three-game preseason trip to Utah, Dallas and South Dakota (against the T-Wolves).\n\nWilkens praised Baker, saying his play has been on the upswing since the Charleston camp while Mohammed has slid. “Right now, [Nazr] got a little down on himself and Vin is making steps,” Wilkens said.\n\nKurt Thomas and Michael Sweetney are also battling for the power-forward position. Thomas’ 7-of-7 shooting night in the preseason opener Thursday took some bite out of Sweetney’s strong bid.\n\n*\n\nWhen the 2-0 Knicks took their flight to Salt Lake yesterday, the trip represented one of the last remnants of the Scott Layden regime. Their five-year preseason contract playing in Utah ends after tonight. The Knicks were forced into playing on the road vs. the Jazz for five years as compensation for hiring Layden in 1999. Layden had still been under contract with Utah, which preferred the preseason games over a second-round pick. New boss Isiah Thomas hopes to arrange a preseason schedule closer to the Eastern seaboard, against teams such as Philly, Washington and Boston.\n\n*"
