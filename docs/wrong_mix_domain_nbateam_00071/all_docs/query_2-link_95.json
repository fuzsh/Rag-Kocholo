        "text": "On Monday, the Bulls announced that Nazr Mohammed would return to the team for his 17th season in the NBA.\n\nWhile it's not exactly Earth-shattering news, it did get us to thinking:\n\n1) Nazr Mohammed is still in the league?\n\n2) How many active players do you think are older than Nazr Mohammed?\n\nWhile we are still having trouble wrapping our head around the fact that Mohammed is still in league, we did determine that there are eight players currently on rosters that are older than the 37-year-old Muhammad, who was born on Sept. 5, 1977.\n\n- Steve Nash, 40, 2/7/1974\n\n- Ray Allen, 39, 7/20/1975\n\n- Andre Miller, 38, 3/19/1976\n\n- Tim Duncan, 38, 4/25/1976\n\n- Kevin Garnett, 38, 5/19/1976\n\n- Vince Carter, 37, 1/26/1977\n\n- Pablo Prigioni, 37, 5/17/1977\n\n- Manu GInobili, 37, 7/28/1977\n\nMohammed was drafted by the Utah Jazz with the 29th pick of the 1998 NBA Draft following a succesful career at the University of Kentucky, where he was part of two National Championship teams.\n\nThink about this. When Mohammed made his NBA debut in 1998, both Rick Pitino, his head coach at Kentucky, and John Calipari, the current head coach at Kentucky, were flaming out as NBA head coaches.\n\nAlso debuting in 1998? The Big Lebowski, Rounders, He Got Game, The Waterboy and Saving Private Ryan."
