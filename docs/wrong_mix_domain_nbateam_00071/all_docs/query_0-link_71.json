        "text": "The Chicago Bulls will employ the services of center Nazr Mohammed once again next season, apparently. CSN's Sam Aggrey reports that the veteran big man has verbally agreed to a one-year deal that will pay him the minimum to back up Joakim Noah next year.\n\nIt was initially unclear if Mohammed was going to return to the Bulls this season considering he'll be 36 by the time next season starts. Chicago apparently felt confident that it'd be able to bring back its backup big, though, as it ignored the position in last week's draft before quickly getting his commitment on Tuesday.\n\nMohammed wasn't an integral part of the Bulls last season, as he averaged just 11 minutes per game and was most noticeable when he got into a mini-altercation with LeBron James late in the year. The veteran big was the starter on the San Antonio Spurs' 2005 championship team, though, and tweeted Tuesday that he's ready to make a run at another ring.\n\nIt was an easy decision because I really enjoyed my teammates, coaching staff, management and the fans. I felt that we exceeded everyone's expectations but our own. I decided to return to the city that I was born and raised in to play my 16th season. Looking forward to going to battle with a group of guys who never made excuses and just tried to find a way to win. Can't wait to play for the Bulls again next season #SeeRed #BullsNation #Holdat\n\nMohammed will be competing in his 16th NBA season after being selected by the Utah Jazz with the 29th pick in the 1998 NBA Draft.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• The NBA's top 90 free agents | All NBA free agency news\n\n• Rockets can offer Howard max deal | Dwight's worth it\n\n• Knicks trading for Bargnani | Ziller: The Knicks never learn\n\n• Everyone wants Andre Iguodala | An open letter to Iggy"
