        "text": "Throughout his 17-year career, Nazr Mohammed spent time with nearly a third of the teams in the NBA. Now retired, the center decided to create a little tribute to all of those teams.\n\nMohammed, a Chicago native, shared a picture of his home weight room on his personal Instagram. Surrounding the room’s TV are stickers of all eight of the teams Mohammed played for during his career and the University of Kentucky, his collegiate team.\n\nAs Mohammed notes in one of the many hashtags he used, the stickers are a little deceiving. Mohammed played for the Charlotte Bobcats, which has since changed its name to the Hornets.\n\nLeft off the wall entirely was Chicago’s Kenwood Academy, Mohammed’s high school team. Although that may be because they just didn’t have a sticker."
