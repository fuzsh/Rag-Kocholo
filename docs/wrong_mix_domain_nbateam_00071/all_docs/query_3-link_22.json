        "text": "Nazr Mohammed’s Twitter bio reads in part, “I’m blessed, good and lucky.”\n\nMohammed’s luck is about to be tested.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Blue general manager and former Thunder center will virtually represent the team during the NBA Draft Lottery at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday on ESPN.\n\nMohammed played 18 NBA seasons, including two stints with the Thunder — first from 2010-12, and then a brief return in 2016 before he retired.\n\nMohammed joined the Thunder’s front office following his playing career. After working as a scout, Mohammed was promoted last September to general manager of the G League Blue.\n\n“Sam (Presti) and everyone there created an environment to teach me about the business of basketball,” Mohammed told The Oklahoman last year. “He created a curriculum in a sense that taught me about the CBA, the salary cap. The people in the organization were my teachers, and still are.\n\n“My days as a player give me the opportunity to talk to different departments in our basketball offices. Sometimes they want to see if there’s things that I would’ve liked or done differently as a player, and I appreciate that the knowledge I have as a player can kind of be used in a front office.”\n\nThe 6-foot-10 center from Chicago was a two-time national champion at Kentucky before becoming the 29th pick in the 1998 NBA Draft.\n\nMohammed will be the face of the Thunder on a crucial day for the franchise, but there’s no skill required. At this point, he and the Thunder can only wish for good luck.\n\nSpecifically, at least one top-five pick with an outside shot at two.\n\nNBA Draft Lottery representatives\n\nCharlotte: Miles Bridges, Hornets forward\n\nChicago: Marc Eversley, Bulls GM\n\nCleveland: Koby Altman, Cavaliers GM\n\nDetroit: Ben Wallace, former Piston\n\nGolden State: Rick Welts, Warriors president\n\nHouston: Hakeem Olajuwon, former Rocket\n\nIndiana: Nancy Leonard, former Pacers executive\n\nMinnesota: Anthony Edwards, Timberwolves guard\n\nNew Orleans: Swin Cash, Pelicans VP of basketball operations\n\nOklahoma City: Nazr Mohammed, former Thunder center\n\nOrlando: Jeff Weltman, Magic president of basketball operations\n\nSacramento: Monte McNair, Kings GM\n\nSan Antonio: Peter J.
