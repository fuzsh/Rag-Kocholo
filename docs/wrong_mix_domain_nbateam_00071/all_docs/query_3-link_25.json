        "text": "Wednesday night, NBC Sports Chicago confirmed that the Bulls are in advanced negotiations to make Denver Nuggets general manager Arturas Karnisovas the team's new head of basketball operations.\n\nBut the Bulls' organizational revamp is just beginning. Thursday, news surfaced that the Bulls held an informal interview for an undetermined front office role with former Bulls player Nazr Mohammed, via reporting by NBC Sports Chicago Bulls Insider K.C. Johnson:\n\nMohammed retired from a 17-year playing career in 2015 that saw stops in Charlotte, Atlanta, Chicago, San Antonio, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, New York and Detroit. In December 2017, Mohammed announced that he had started a position in the Thunder's front office as a \"professional evaluation scout/identification and intelligence.\" He has worked in Oklahoma City under Sam Presti ever since.\n\nRELATED: Bulls negotiating to make Karnisovas head of basketball ops\n\nAlso on Thursday, Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo! Sports reported that the Bulls requested permission to interview Thunder vice president of basketball operations Troy Weaver, but were rebuked. In a mailbag from March, Johnson listed Weaver as a potential target for the team's front office search.\n\nGoodwill also reported that Karnisovas intends to hire a person of color to be the Bulls' general manager.\n\nNBA\n\nThese developments are important context to a report from ESPN's Marc Spears on Wednesday night highlighting league-wide frustration with a lack of diversity in the Bulls' front office search process.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: Apple/iPhone | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Art 19"
