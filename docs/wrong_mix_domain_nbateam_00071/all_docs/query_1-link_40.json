        "text": "Matt JonesAnalyst I\n\nNBA Draft 2011: The 10 Worst Draft Classes for the Utah Jazz\n\n0 of 10\n\nRick Stewart/Getty Images\n\nNo team in the NBA gets it right every time.\n\nDespite finding success in the NBA draft in the past, the Utah Jazz are no different from other teams who have some very big question marks with players they have selected.\n\nEarlier in the week, I outlined the 10 best draft classes in franchise history. In fairness, here are the 10 worst.\n\nThe team has the potential to have one of its best draft classes in franchise history next week.\n\nThe following slides will detail some of the draft classes that did not work out so well for the Jazz.\n\n2009 Draft: Traded Without a Chance\n\n1 of 10\n\nAl Bello/Getty Images\n\nThe Utah Jazz picked Eric Maynor 20th overall in the 2009 draft. Trying to fill the backup point guard role for the team, they selected a player that many Jazz fans did not know much about.\n\nAs Maynor was becoming a good reserve player in the league and working to learn the Jazz system, he was traded in December of his rookie year with the contract of Matt Harpring in a cost-cutting move.\n\nHe is still with the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he now is the backup to Russell Westbrook.\n\nPlayers selected by the Jazz in this draft: Eric Maynor, Goran Suton\n\nPlayers that were still available: Darren Collison, Taj Gibson, DeJuan Blair, Marcus Thornton, Chase Budinger\n\n2004 Draft: Three First Round Picks, Two Disappointments and a Trade\n\n2 of 10\n\nElsa/Getty Images\n\nFor the first time in team history, the Jazz found themselves with a lottery pick in the draft. Barely.\n\nKris Humphries of the University of Minnesota was taken with the 14th pick, after just one year of college. The Jazz saw tremendous upside, but it turned out that he was just too young.\n\nAfter two seasons, the Jazz traded he and Robert Whaley for the player they wanted all along in this draft: Rafael Araújo.\n\nKirk Snyder was taken two picks later. Current Jazz player Al Jefferson picked in between. Snyder is best known for feuding with Jerry Sloan and played in only 68 games before being traded away.\n\nThe Jazz also drafted Pavel Podkolzin, who they traded to Dallas for a future pick.\n\nIn the end, it didn't turn out all bad as the draft pick helped the Jazz more than any of these three players. It was part of the trade with Portland that the Jazz used to move up in the 2005 draft to acquire Deron Williams.\n\nPlayers selected by the Jazz in this draft: Kris Humphries, Kirk Snyder, Pavel Podkolzin\n\nPlayers that were still available: Al Jefferson, Josh Smith, J.R. Smith, Dorell Wright, Kevin Martin, Delonte West, Anderson Varejao, Trevor Ariza\n\n2003 Draft: Good Players That Left Too Soon\n\n3 of 10\n\nBrian Bahr/Getty Images\n\nThe Utah Jazz used its 19th pick on Sasha Pavlovic, a European guard/forward with a lot of potential.\n\nAfter one mediocre season with the team, he was selected by the Charlotte Bobcats in the expansion draft and traded to Cleveland. He is now playing with his sixth team.\n\nMo Williams averaged only 5 points and 1.3 assists in his rookie season and was released by the Jazz. With his new teams, the Bucks, Cavaliers, and Clippers, he has worked to have a good career and became a player the Jazz wish they had back.\n\nPlayers selected by the Jazz in this draft: Sasha Pavlovic, Mo Williams\n\nPlayers that were still available: Kendrick Perkins, Leandro Barbosa, Josh Howard, Matt Bonner, Kyle Korver\n\n1998 Draft: Picks That Never Played for the Jazz\n\n4 of 10\n\nJim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nDue to having one of the most successful seasons in team history the year before, the Utah Jazz had the last pick in the first round and the second-to-last pick in the second round.\n\nWith the 29th pick, the Jazz took Nazr Mohammed, who was quickly traded away for a future draft pick.\n\nWhile Mohammed has had a decent career with other teams, the draft pick the Jazz traded for ended up being Quincy Lewis the following year.\n\nSecond round pick Torraye Braggs had short stints with other teams, but never played in Utah.\n\nPlayers selected by the Jazz in this draft: Nazr Mohammed, Torraye Braggs\n\nPlayers that were still available: Ruben Patterson, Rashard Lewis, Rafer Alston, Cuttino Mobley\n\n2001 Draft: Jazz Pick the Wrong Point Guard\n\n5 of 10\n\nAndy Lyons/Getty Images\n\nIn 2001, the Jazz were looking for a point guard who could be the replacement for John Stockton.\n\nWith the 24th pick, the team selected Raul Lopez from Spain. Due to his play in the European leagues and his comparisons to John Stockton and Steve Nash, the Jazz were very excited and felt they had a draft-day steal.\n\nShortly after the draft, Lopez had surgery to repair his ACL and missed what would have been his rookie season.\n\nIn the only full season he played with the Jazz, he backed up Carlos Arroyo and averaged 7.0 points, 3.7 assists and 1.9 rebounds in 19.7 minutes per game.\n\nHe was traded shortly after. The Jazz are still kicking themselves for not drafting Tony Parker.\n\nThe one bright spot in this draft class for the Jazz was selecting Jarron Collins in the second round. Collins played for the Jazz for several years and was a decent backup for the team.\n\nIf it were not for him, this draft class would be higher on the list.\n\nPlayers selected by the Jazz in this draft: Raul Lopez, Jarron Collins\n\nPlayers that were still available: Tony Parker, Samuel Dalembert, Gerald Wallace, Gilbert Arenas, Mehmet Okur, Earl Watson\n\nRaúl López\n\n1988 Draft: Searching for a Center\n\n6 of 10\n\nMike Powell/Getty Images\n\nEric Leckner was taken by the Jazz with the 17th overall pick.\n\nAfter a good collegiate career at the University of Wyoming, Leckner turned out to be another of the unathletic centers the Jazz seem to draft every few years.\n\nHe averaged only 4.3 points and less than 3 rebounds per game in his two seasons with the team.\n\nIn 1990 Leckner was part of a three-team trade that brought Jeff Malone to Utah.\n\nThe other picks did not play for the team.\n\nPlayers selected by the Jazz in this draft: Eric Leckner, Jeff Moe, Ricky Grace\n\nPlayers that were still available: Rod Strickland, Vinny Del Negro, Anthony Mason\n\n1982 Draft: No Highlight Film in Utah\n\n7 of 10\n\nMike Powell/Getty Images\n\nThe Utah Jazz held the third pick in the 1982 draft. Having recently moved to Utah, they needed another star player to help them succeed.\n\nWhen they selected the \"Human Highlight Film,\" Dominique Wilkins, they thought they had that player.\n\nWilkins was reluctant to play in Utah. He was traded to the Hawks before the season started for John Drew, Freeman Williams and much-needed cash.\n\nWilkins went on to be a great player for the Hawks, winning a scoring title by averaging more than 30 points per game in a single season.\n\nThe silver lining of this draft class came in the fourth round when the Jazz selected Mark Eaton. He played his entire career with the Jazz, was an NBA All-Star, earned Defensive Player of the Year honors twice and had his number retired by the franchise.\n\nIf not for him, this draft class would be much worse.\n\nPlayers selected by the Jazz in this draft: Dominique Wilkins, Steve Trumbo, Mark Eaton, Alvin Jackson, Thad Garner\n\nPlayers that were still available: Cliff Levingston, Terry Teagle, Eric Floyd, Craig Hodges\n\n2002 Draft: Trading for a Big Man\n\n8 of 10\n\nLisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images\n\nThe 2002 draft was a strong one. The Utah Jazz sat in the 19th spot and were looking for a center.\n\nOne pick after seeing a player they wanted drafted by the Orlando Magic, the Jazz selected Ryan Humphrey.\n\nIn the second round, the Jazz selected Jamal Sampson. In an effort to get the center that the team was focused on, the Jazz then traded both of these players to Orlando for Stanford center Curtis Borchardt.\n\nBorchardt spent about two seasons with the league, battled injuries and rode the bench for most of his career. He never became the player the Jazz thought he would and was traded to the Celtics as part of the largest trade in NBA history in 2005.\n\nPlayers selected by the Jazz in this draft: Ryan Humphrey, Jamal Sampson (Traded for Borchardt)\n\nPlayers that were still available: Tayshaun Prince, Nenad Krstic, John Salmons, Carlos Boozer, Matt Barnes, Luis Scola\n\n1990 Draft: An Intelligent Choice\n\n9 of 10\n\nTim DeFrisco/Getty Images\n\nDue to the three-team trade that sent Eric Leckner and a few draft picks away for Jeff Malone, the Jazz did not have a first-round selection in the draft this year.\n\nIn the second round, they selected Walter Palmer from Dartmouth College. He became only the sixth player taken from this college and quickly found his way out of the league.\n\nHe appeared in 28 games for the Jazz before being waived. He played one more season with Dallas but was waived from the Mavericks as well.\n\n1979 Draft: The Move That Changed the Franchise Forever\n\n10 of 10\n\nGetty Images/Getty Images\n\nThis pick was supposed to belong to the Jazz.\n\nIn 1976, Laker veteran Gail Goodrich signed with the New Orleans Jazz.\n\nAccording to league rules at the time, the Lakers had to receive compensation for losing a veteran player. That compensation was the Jazz top picks in 1977, 1978, 1979 and a second-round pick.\n\nWhen the 1979 pick turned out to be the first overall selection, the Lakers took one of the best players in league history. That year, the Jazz drafted Larry Knight.\n\nTo make matters worse, Goodrich retired shortly after that.\n\nThe Jazz did rebound when they selected John Stockton several years later. But one must ask: What would have happened if Magic would have come to Utah?\n\nWould he have led the Showtime Jazz instead of the Showtime Lakers?\n\nWould the Jazz have multiple titles?\n\nPlayers selected by the Jazz in this draft: Larry Knight, Tico Brown, Greg Deane, Wolfe Perry\n\nPlayers that were still available: Bill Laimbeer\n\nDraft history found on NBA.com\n\nChris Johstoneaux is a contributor to Bleacher Report who usually covers the NBA and Major League Soccer.
