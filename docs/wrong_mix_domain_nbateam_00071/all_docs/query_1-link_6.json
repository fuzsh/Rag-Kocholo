Mohammed currently serves a General Manager of the Oklahoma City Blue of the NBA G League. During his playing career he had a journeyman career in the National Basketball Association (NBA), playing for eight different teams over 18 seasons. He is the current general manager of the Oklahoma City Blue and a pro scout for the Oklahoma City Thunder. He played college basketball for Kentucky. He won a championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2005.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nThe son of an immigrant from Ghana, Mohammed was raised in Chicago and attended high school at Kenwood Academy, graduating in 1995. Mohammed entered the University of Kentucky in the fall of 1995 at a hefty 315 pounds, and saw little playing time during their NCAA championship season. After slimming down for his sophomore year, Mohammed shared the starting center spot with Jamaal Magloire and was a key contributor in 1997, when the Wildcats were runners-up to Arizona. Mohammed once again shared the starting post position with Magloire in 1998, and once again they brought the NCAA Championship home to Kentucky, for the second time in three years.\n\nProfessional career[]\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers (1998–2001)[]\n\nAfter his junior year, Mohammed decided to enter the 1998 NBA Draft. He was selected by the Utah Jazz in the first round, as the 29th pick overall. Utah traded his rights to the Philadelphia 76ers for a future first round pick, which turned out to be Quincy Lewis in the 1999 NBA Draft. He spent two and a half seasons in Philadelphia before being traded in February 2001 to the Atlanta Hawks along with an injured Theo Ratliff in exchange for Hall of Fame Center Dikembe Mutombo.\n\nAtlanta Hawks (2001–2004)[]\n\nOn November 5, 2001, he scored a career-high 30 points against the Los Angeles Clippers. He played for the Hawks through the middle of the 2003–04 season, at which point he was traded to the New York Knicks for Michael Doleac.\n\nNew York Knicks (2004–2005)[]\n\nMohammed spent half of the 2004–05 season with the Knicks.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs (2005–2006)[]\n\nHe played for the San Antonio Spurs (who acquired him in a trade for Malik Rose), for the second half of the 2004–05 season. In a combined 77 games for both teams, he averaged 9.5 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 1.1 blocks per game. He won his first and only championship in 2005 with the Spurs as a member of their starting lineup.\n\nDuring his second season in San Antonio, Mohammed shared the starting Center position with Rasho Nesterović, averaging 6.2 points and 5.2 rebounds per game during the regular season. On March 17, 2006, he tied his career-high of 30 points against the Phoenix Suns. He was a key contributor to the team's first round series victory over the Sacramento Kings, averaging 7.0 points per game and nailing his second career three-point basket late in Game 1. Mohammed, however, played sparingly in the team's second round series loss to the eventual Conference champion Dallas Mavericks. After the season, he turned down a four-year contract extension and did not return to the Spurs.\n\nDetroit Pistons (2006–2007)[]\n\nIn July 2006, he signed with the Detroit Pistons and became their starting Center. After beginning the season in the starting five, the arrival of Chris Webber on January 16, 2007 made him gradually fall out of the team's rotation, the culmination being his 5 minutes in two postseason contests. He averaged 5.6 points and 4.5 rebounds in 51 games (33 starts), with about 15 minutes of action per game.\n\nCharlotte Bobcats (2007–2011)[]\n\nMohammed was traded from the Pistons to the Charlotte Bobcats on December 14, 2007, in exchange for Primož Brezec and Walter Herrmann.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder (2011–2012)[]\n\nOn February 24, 2011, Mohammed was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, while Forward D.J. White and guard Morris Peterson were sent to the Charlotte Bobcats. He reached the 2012 NBA Finals with the Thunder, but the team lost to the Miami Heat 4 games to 1.\n\nChicago Bulls (2012–2015)[]\n\nOn July 27, 2012, Mohammed signed with the Chicago Bulls. On May 10, 2013, he was involved in an altercation with LeBron James in the 2013 NBA Playoffs, in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals against the Heat (the team that Mohammed faced in the 2012 Finals). James was called for a technical foul for tying up with Mohammed in transition; Mohammed retaliated by shoving James which required James to sue Mohammed. The Bulls eventually lost the series in five games and the Heat repeated as champions.\n\nOn July 11, 2013, Mohammed re-signed with the Bulls. On September 22, 2014, he again re-signed with the Bulls.\n\nOn August 1, 2015, Mohammed played for Team Africa at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game. On October 9, 2015, he retired from the NBA.\n\nReturn to Oklahoma City (2016)[]\n\nIn March 2016, Mohammed came out of retirement in order to return to the NBA. On March 5, he signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder, returning to the franchise for a second stint. Four days later, he made his season debut in a 120–108 win over the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nNBA career statistics[]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high † Won an NBA championship\n\nRegular season[]\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1998–99 Philadelphia 26 0 4.7 .357 .000 .571 1.4 .1 .2 .2 1.6 1999–00 Philadelphia 28 3 6.8 .389 .000 .545 1.8 .1 .1 .4 1.9 2000–01 Philadelphia 30 3 6.5 .466 .000 .500 1.8 .1 .2 .2 3.2 2000–01 Atlanta 28 19 25.6 .480 .000 .765 9.0 .6 .8 1.0 12.3 2001–02 Atlanta 82 73 26.4 .461 .000 .617 7.9 .4 .8 .7 9.7 2002–03 Atlanta 35 0 12.7 .421 .000 .634 3.7 .2 .5 .6 4.6 2003–04 Atlanta 53 1 17.7 .493 .000 .627 5.0 .4 .4 .5 6.5 2003–04 New York 27 23 24.9 .563 .000 .525 7.7 .6 1.2 .9 9.1 2004–05 New York 54 54 28.1 .509 .000 .708 8.1 .5 1.0 1.0 10.9 2004–05† San Antonio 23 5 18.0 .387 .000 .571 6.4 .3 .2 1.4 6.2 2005–06 San Antonio 80 30 17.4 .504 .000 .785 5.2 .5 .3 .6 6.2 2006–07 Detroit 51 33 15.2 .532 .000 .610 4.5 .2 .5 .8 5.6 2007–08 Detroit 21 0 10.9 .475 .000 .433 3.5 .3 .3 .4 3.3 2007–08 Charlotte 61 29 23.3 .520 .000 .617 6.9 1.1 .6 .9 9.3 2008–09 Charlotte 39 1 8.7 .406 .000 .550 2.0 .2 .1 .4 2.7 2009–10 Charlotte 58 29 17.0 .553 .000 .648 5.2 .5 .3 .7 7.9 2010–11 Charlotte 51 30 16.7 .502 .000 .591 4.9 .3 .3 .9 7.3 2010–11 Oklahoma City 24 7 17.9 .573 .000 .625 4.8 .3 .7 .4 6.9 2011–12 Oklahoma City 63 1 11.0 .467 .000 .565 2.7 .2 .3 .6 2.7 2012–13 Chicago 63 12 11.0 .367 .000 .723 3.1 .4 .3 .5 2.6 2013–14 Chicago 80 1 7.0 .429 .000 .533 2.2 .3 .2 .4 1.6 2014–15 Chicago 23 0 5.6 .433 .000 .333 1.7 .1 .2 .2 1.2 2015–16 Oklahoma City 5 0 3.8 .600 .000 1.000 .8 .0 .0 .0 1.6 Career 1005 354 15.8 .486 .000 .640 4.7 .4 .4 .6 5.8\n\nPlayoffs[]\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1999 Philadelphia 3 0 1.0 .000 .000 .000 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 2004 New York 4 4 24.3 .500 .000 .688 5.8 .3 1.5 .8 10.3 2005† San Antonio 23 23 23.0 .528 1.000 .638 6.7 .3 .6 1.0 7.1 2006 San Antonio 8 3 11.8 .733 1.000 .722 3.9 .1 .4 .8 4.5 2007 Detroit 2 0 3.0 .500 .000 1.000 1.5 .0 .0 .0 2.5 2010 Charlotte 4 0 12.0 .579 .000 .667 2.0 .5 .3 .5 6.0 2011 Oklahoma City 14 0 10.6 .412 .000 .400 2.3 .0 .3 .4 2.3 2012 Oklahoma City 8 0 10.4 .500 .000 .500 2.0 .1 .0 .4 2.3 2013 Chicago 12 0 9.5 .512 .000 .571 2.7 .3 .2 .6 3.8 2014 Chicago 2 0 2.5 .000 .000 .000 1.0 .0 .0 .0 .0 2015 Chicago 3 0 4.7 .286 .000 .000 1.7 .0 .0 .3 1.3 2016 Oklahoma City 5 0 2.0 .500 .000 .000 0.6 .0 .0 .2 0.4 Career 88 30 13.1 .514 .667 .639 3.5 .2 .3 .6 4.2\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nMohammed is a practicing Muslim who fasts for Ramadan.
