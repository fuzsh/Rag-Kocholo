Honorable Mention: Nazr Mohammed (1998)\n\nBy: Utah Jazz\n\nShoving LeBron to the floor is a quick way to get noticed in this league, and that’s exactly what Nazr did in a meeting between Chicago and Miami a few years back. A two time NCAA champion and one time NBA Champion, Nazr has played big roles for every team he has played for.\n\n#23 Honorable Mention: Tayshaun Prince (2002)\n\nBy: Detroit Pistons\n\nCalifornia Mr. Basketball, Tayshaun Prince, won the NBA championship in 2004 with the Detroit Pistons and another member of this list. He just missed the cut on four All-Defensive First Teams, but was voted to four All-Defensive Second Teams. Prince is the only player in NBA history to score more points in the playoffs than he did in the regular season.\n\n#21 Rajon Rondo (2006)\n\nBy: Phoenix Suns\n\nBefore the drama in Sacramento, Rajon Rondo was an up and comer in the point guard scene. A NBA champion in 2008, four time NBA All-Star, and made the NBA All-Defensive First Team two times. Adding to that, Rondo led the NBA in assists for three years and steals for one.\n\nSource\n\nWhich former Kentucky player do you think has the best chance of breaking through on this list?"
