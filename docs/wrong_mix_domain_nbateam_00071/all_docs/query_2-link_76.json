        "text": "SATURDAY, 11:13pm:Â The signing is official, the Thunder announced today.\n\nFRIDAY, 9:12pm: The Thunder intend to sign free agent Nazr Mohammed for the remainder of the season, Shams Charania of The Vertical on Yahoo Sports reports (on Twitter). Oklahoma City has an available roster spot, so no other moves would be required to bring the center into the fold. The team intends to ink the veteran on Saturday, Charania adds. It’s not entirely clear whether it’ll be a minimum-salary contract or one that eats into the roughly $2MMÂ Oklahoma City has left on its taxpayer’s mid-level exception.\n\nThe move to ink Mohammed comes as a bit of a surprise as the big man had not been mentioned in any recent chatter. He last appeared in the NBA during the 2014/15 season, making 23 appearances for the Bulls and notching 1.2 points and 1.7 rebounds in 5.6 minutes per contest. Mohammed’s career numbers since entering the league as the No. 29 overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft are 5.8 points, 4.7 rebounds and 0.6 blocks to accompany a slash line of .486/.000/.639.\n\nMohammed was contemplating retirementÂ in October, saying he would be OK with never playing again.âTruth is, I still love this game, I still have that competitor in me and I still feel like I can help a team. And regardless of what happens, I plan on staying in basketball shape,â Mohammed wrote at the time. âBut at this moment, I am comfortable and confident saying that Iâm cool with it being over. I am really at peace. I realize how big of an accomplishment it is to have played as long as Iâve played. Itâs an unbelievable feat. Iâm cool with not playing ever again and choosing which path to take at this fork in the road that leads me away from my first love.â"
