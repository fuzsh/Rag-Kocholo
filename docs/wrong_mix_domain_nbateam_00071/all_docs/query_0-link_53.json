        "text": "Former Louisville center Mangok Mathiang will get a shot in the NBA summer league.\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Mathiang will play for the Charlotte Hornets in Orlando, his agent, Aaron Turner, said. The Orlando Pro Summer League starts July 1.\n\nMathiang averaged 7.8 points and six rebounds per game for Louisville this past season. He became the Cards' top interior scorer in the campaign's final few weeks.\n\nA native of Sudan whose family moved to Australia, Mathiang worked out for Charlotte in early June. He also participated in the Portsmouth Invitational for graduating seniors who hoped to pursue professional careers.\n\nMangok Mathiang scouting report\n\n\"Mangok is doing real well,\" U of L coach Rick Pitino said in late May. \"Mangok had some great workouts. I think Mangok would be a great 11th or 12th man on any professional basketball team because he reminds of Nazr Mohammed. He's a great teammate. He's going to keep guys up. He's got a great personality, a great locker room guy. He can play defense, block shots, rebound the ball, good low-post player. I think Mangok may make it and may make a team.\"\n\nMore: Chance Louisville basketball matchup, great workout led Utah Jazz to Donovan Mitchell"
