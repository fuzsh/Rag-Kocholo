Most of all, thanks are due to Elisabeth Hsu, who has worked over the last five years to edit all the components of this text together to create a coherent whole constituting a major contribution to this field of learning. Without her dedication and thoroughness there would simply be no book at all. The book has its origin in a workshop meeting that was held at the Needham Research Institute in Cambridge from 8—11 March 1995. One aim of that workshop was to commemorate the life and work of Lu Gwei-djen, who for many years was Joseph Needham’s principal collaborator on the Science and Civilisation in China project. She was in fact the ‘principal evocator’ of this immense work through the inspiration she gave, dating from well before the time Needham first visited China. Joseph Needham took part in the workshop, but died a fortnight later. This was therefore, very fittingly, the last scholarly activity to which he contributed in a long and productive life. The workshop was generously supported by a number of bodies, including the Lu Gwei-djen Memorial Charitable Trust (who also supported the editorial work on this book), the Wellcome Trust, the British Academy, and Robinson College (where Lu Gwei-djen had been an honorary fellow). To these bodies we offer our sincere gratitude for having made this work possible. As well as those who have contributed their writing to this book, there were others whose participation in the workshop and subsequent advice helped to shape it and to give it direction: Francesca Bray (University of California, Santa Barbara), Judith Farquhar (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), T. J. Hinrichs and Lowell Skar, at that time both US National Science Foundation Fellows at the NRI, Francoise Sabban (Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris), Sidney White (Temple University, Philadelphia), and also Gregory Blue (University of Victoria). We hope they will be pleased to see what they have helped to bring to fruition. No less than three anonymous academic readers contributed advice on the content and structure of the xiii\n\nxiv\n\nSeries editor's preface\n\n;\n\nvolume in draft: we hope that the value of their careful checking and criticism will be evident to them from the present appearance of this book. Throughout the editing of the book, invaluable advice came from a number of scholars whose advice the editor sought on many occasions: David McMullen, Mark Lewis, Geoffrey Lloyd, Michael Loewe, and also Ho Peng-Yoke. Penelope Herbert acted as English style consultant for a volume whose contributors came from a very varied linguistic background. On matters Chinese researchers at the Needham Research Institute helped in many ways; among them are Li Lisha, Guo Shirong, Wang Qianjin, and also Zhao Hongjun and Ma Boying. In the editor’s tasks of bibliographic and other background research, much help came from Charles Aylmer of Cambridge University Library and from John Moffett, Librarian of the Needham Research Institute with the assistance of Gao Chuan and Sally Church. As. successive secretaries of the Institute, Angela King and Susan Bennett helped manage a complex network of contacts and information flows. Of course none of those who helped in all these varied ways bears responsibility for any errors of commission or omission that may remain uncorrected in the final text. This book is not in any conventional sense a Festschrift. It exists in its own right as a carefully planned and executed collective contribution to a vigorously growing field of learning. But given the field with which it deals, and the occasion which gave rise to the project from which it stems, I hope that it will be taken as a tribute to the life and work of Lu Gwei-djen, whose arrival in Cambridge so long ago led to so much that has increased the understanding and mutual knowledge of China and the West.

Change is equated with improvement; the present is better than the past, and the future will be better still. This view of time is not that of premodern China. Scholars and doctors looked back to a Golden Age in the past. Morals were declining and, for them, time went downhill. If there was any hope for improvement, it lay in a more sophisticated understanding of ancient knowledge. Even today practitioners intent on modernising Chinese medicine declare allegiance to the canonical tradition that links them in a direct line to the legendary figure of the Yellow Emperor. So why devote a book on Chinese medicine to the topic of ‘innovation’? Why discuss the many strands of an ‘ancient art of healing’ from the perspective of a concept that alludes to the strife of modern science and\n\ntechnology?! The contributions to this volume were written to commemorate the initiator of a scholarly project’ designed expressly to challenge the orientalising view of China as the exotic and remote, good for the connoisseur of art and poetry, but not for the researcher interested in the sciences and technologies that have shaped modern society so decisively. Following the lead of Science and Civilisation in China, this volume in memory of Lu Gwei-djen is meant to demonstrate how much is to be gained by using a broader view of science: it presents recent applications of the notion of science to comparable forms of knowledge before and outside post-Renaissance Europe, asking the same serious questions of other histories that we ask of our own. If difference is construed in hierarchical terms, as so often in cross-cultural comparisons of intellectual, material, or social history, then of course terms like ‘technological innovation’ which are closely connected in our minds with our own ‘scientific revolution’\n\n' I am indebted to Francesca Bray for extensive work on an earlier draft. I would also like to thank my colleagues at the Needham Research Institute for their valuable comments on a more recent version. * Needham, Joseph et al. (1954— ).

Yet certain historical processes, in spite of their uniqueness, can have striking cross-cultural similarities. Even though the worldviews of the Chinese past differ greatly from those of the industrialised northern hemisphere in the early twenty-first century, the admittedly culture-specific concept of ‘innovation’, used with circumspection, opens up interesting ways of thinking about the history of medicine in China. Vice versa, the application of this concept to a premodern and non-western society can enrich our understanding of ‘innovation’ and the complex processes it involves. ‘Innovation’ was a topic central to the “Needham question’ of why modern science originated only in Europe when in fact significant technological inventions had been made much earlier in China.* At the end of his life, Joseph Needham stressed that Lu Gwei-djen, formerly a research student of his first wife Dorothy Needham, had been ‘the dominant influence that caused him to change from being a regular research scientist .. . to becoming a historian of science in China’. Apparently, ‘she worked out with Needham the subjects for a book to seek to provide an answer to the great puzzle worrying him’.? Among researchers in the field, Lu Gwei-djen is furthermore remembered for her contributions to the history of medicine in publications that were, however, always co-authored.® The one exception to this was an article on the great scholarphysician and natural historian of the Ming dynasty, Li Shizhen,’ whose work continues\n\n> Sivin, Nathan (1981), ‘Why the Scientific Revolution did not take place in China — Or didn’t it?’ Chinese Science 5, 45—66. * Joseph Needham is commonly known for having shown that the three technological inventions that Francis Bacon made responsible for the rise of modernity — the compass, gunpowder, and the printing\n\npress — had been invented by the Chinese already in antiquity and mediaeval times. > Goldsmith, Maurice (1995), Joseph Needham: 20th Century Renaissance Man, Profiles UNESCO, Paris, 71. ° Three of these publications are in book form, namely Lu Gwei-djen and Joseph Needham (1980),\n\nCelestial Lancets: a History and Rationale of Acupuncture and Moxa, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Needham, Joseph (with Lu Gwei-djen) (1983), Science and Civilisation in China, vol.

In an article outlining an oecumenical vision of world sciences, he characterised medicine as one of the most progressive Chinese sciences.* He had both great awe and belief in it, and perhaps for this reason he could not terminate his researches on its history in his lifetime. This Festschrift in memory of his lifelong Chinese collaborator and second wife, which appears approximately at the same time as the posthumously published SCC volume on medicine, represents an attempt to focus on developments in medicine in their own right, without, however, entirely forestalling comparisons with the West. Despite extensive historical research in East Asia and the West, many practitioners and large sections of the public still hold onto the illusion that ‘Traditional Chinese Medicine’ is five thousand years old, and that this elaborate edifice of mysticism has remained ‘essentially the same’ throughout millennia to the present day. Admittedly, there is written evidence of medical concerns which can be traced back thousands of years; inscriptions on oracle bones from the 14th to the 11th century BC, for instance, have been identified with Chinese characters that later appear as part of the medical vocabulary in scholarly treatises. No doubt ‘medicine in China’, which embraces a great variety of different therapeutic practices, is as old as ‘China’ itself;’ but ‘medicine in China’ is not to be confused with ‘Traditional Chinese Medicine’.'° Needless to say, medical knowledge and practice, like any other aspect of society, have been subject to change. ‘Innovation’ is a concept more specific than ‘change’. As a theme of research for more than half a century now, it has the advantage of providing researchers and readers with a well-known set of questions and reasonably differentiated problems arising from the study of science and technology in Western cultures. Even ifthe transposition of this ’ Needham, Joseph (1970), ‘The Roles of Europe and China in the Evolution of Oecumenical Science’, in Clerks and Craftsmen, 396-418. ° Unschuld, Paul U. (1985), Medicine in China: a History of Ideas, University of California Press, Berkeley. '© The term ‘Traditional Chinese Medicine’ (TCM) generally refers to Chinese medicine today. Some authors consider it to reify differences between Western and Chinese but a more recent definition of\n\nTCM as the ‘revived Chinese medicine that has been promoted by the government of the PRC from the late fifties onwards’ overcomes this problem. For a book-length monograph on it, see Farquhar, Judith (1994), Knowing Practice: the Clinical Encounter of Chinese Medicine, Westview, Boulder. For the above definition, see Hsu, Elisabeth (1999), The Transmission of Chinese Medicine, Cambridge\n\nUniversity Press, Cambridge, 9 and 168-223.\n\n4\n\nElisabeth Hsu\n\nconcept from one culture to another and from modern to premodern times poses problems, they are not insurmountable. This transposition is moreover facilitated through recent developments within the history of Western post-Renaissance science, and alternative ways of accounting for artefacts and events generally considered as ‘innovative’ are now outlined by historians — some of them known as ‘anthropologists\n\nof science’ — who study ‘innovation’ but barely mention the term.\" Innovation\n\nHistoriography that explains historical changes by indicating solely the conditioning or causal factors, particularly demographic and economic ones, has long been found too simplistic. It was in the course of criticising such a view of history that Schumpeter gave the frequently cited definition of innovation as ‘the doing of new things or the doing of\n\nthings that are already being done in a new way’. He pointed out that there were ‘different kinds of reaction to changes in “condition” ’ and proposed to distinguish between ‘adaptive responses’ and ‘creative responses’, the latter being responses that led to innovation. The ‘creative response’, according to Schumpeter, had ‘three essential characteristics’: it could be understood only ex post and practically never ex ante; it would shape the course of subsequent events and their long-term outcome; and, admittedly to varying degrees, it depended on the quality of available personnel and individual decisions, actions, and patterns of behaviour. Schumpeter invoked the notion of innovation in the light of historical processes that one recognised as such only in retrospect and could not explain by the usual procedure of searching for conditioning or causal factors. It was a historian’s concept for processes that the actors themselves might have phrased in a different vocabulary, an analytic tool of the outside observer. So, regardless of whether or not the historian is interested in the insiders’ viewpoint, according to Schumpeter, certain historical processes can be described as the ‘creative response’ that gives rise to innovation. As important as Schumpeter’s notion of ‘innovation’ has remained, its flaws have long been apparent. Innovation has as its defining characteristic ‘the new’, and for Schumpeter ‘the new’ had a positive value. But people are often ambivalent towards ‘the new’ and in some historical periods or cultural contexts this may turn into an\n\n'' See for instance Shapin, Steven and Schaffer, Simon (1985), Leviathan and the Air-Pump. Hobbes,\n\nBoyle, and Experimental Life, Princeton University Press, Princeton. '2 Schumpeter, Joseph A. (1947), ‘The Creative Response in Economic History’, The Journal of Economic History 7 (2), 149-59; citation from p. 151.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\noutright resistance to anything considered ‘new’. Particularly in premodern societies ‘the new’ was usually not advertised as ‘new’. Protagonists like Galen in the Hellenistic occident or Sima Qian in Han dynasty China — and on the medical front his spokesman Chunyu Yi — did not present their writings as innovative. They claimed adherence to tradition, and yet to a historian their writings are strikingly ‘new’, both in style and content. Galen, who presented himself as a commentator of the Hippocratic writings, built a scholarly edifice that was to dominate large parts of the mediaeval world and\n\nSima Qian, who indirectly alluded to Confucius’ words ‘I transmit and do not create’,’° created the model for the dynastic histories of the following two thousand years. While advocating ‘the old’ they set the basis for ‘the new’. Schumpeter saw in the ‘creative response’ a change of social and economic situations ‘from which there is no bridge to those situations that might have emerged in its absence’. His article distinguished between the inventor and the copyist, mystified the creativity of the former as inexplicable and held imitation as something mindless and straightforward. Such an understanding of innovation is often grounded in the assumption that, due to their intrinsic superiority, inventions effortlessly diffuse into their surroundings. It postulates that some changes are qualitatively different from others, involving quantum leaps that lead to radically altered conditions; and these conditions are, in turn, often depicted as more stable than they actually are. None of the contributions to this volume reports on an ‘innovation’ of that kind, and a historian of modern Western science might want to conclude that the apparent ‘lack’ of quantum-leap-like innovations arises from the peculiarity of the object of research: medicine in premodern China. Such a historian might take this finding as evidence for the incapacity of Chinese physicians to produce generally accepted ‘paradigms’ that remained stable over a certain period of time, and thereby explain the lack of ‘paradigm shifts’. Itis more likely, however, that this volume on innovation contains no recordings of ‘innovation’ in the above sense because of the contributors’ scholarly attitude to time and change, and their style of writing medical history.\n\nConvention and controversy The view of ‘medicine in the making’ that many of the articles in this book present relates to the social background, technological premises, and conventional knowledge at certain time periods, and to the kind of controversies medical practitioners and\n\n'S Durrant, Stephen W. (1995), The Cloudy Mirror: Tension and Conflict in the Writings of Sima Qian, State University of New York Press, Albany, 11.\n\n'4 Schumpeter (1947), 150.\n\n6\n\nElisabeth Hsu\n\nscholars engaged in which eventually led to the changes\n\nin medical practice and\n\ndoctrine that are here offered as examples of innovation in Chinese medicine. The changes described may have been gradual or sudden, they may concern an entire system of thought and medical practice or a single artefact, they may have been instigated by a single individual or they may have happened without there being a known initiator. They concern a wide range of medical endeavour, and include changes in diagnostic methods and techniques, therapeutic practices, pharmaceutical artefacts, philosophical and medical concepts, perceptions of the body, and canonical doctrine as well as other genres of medical writing. By conceiving of medical innovation as an interplay between convention and controversy the historian stresses the importance of social processes for technological advancement. Innovation in this sense is seen not merely as knowledge production, ‘discovery’, or invention. Rather, problems related to the validation of newly produced knowledge are emphasised. Since the new is not by definition better, its spread is no more viewed as a natural process of diffusion along a gradient of unequal advancement in technology, and the question is raised of why people are prepared to adopt practices with which they are unacquainted. The acceptance of new ideas and the reproduction of novel artefacts are now viewed as processes that represent a challenge; they are not intrinsically superior. Individuals and social groups receive the new in an active and selective process and they reproduce it more often than not by translation and re-invention. Exact replication has been shown to pose considerable problems; it is not the natural outcome of mindless ‘copyists’. Research is thus directed away from the intellectual achievements of heroic individuals and towards institutional settings, state policies,.environmental factors, economic incentive; in short, the interests of mutually interacting social groups. The medical writings investigated in this volume are often technical and particular to a lineage of scholarship, but the nature of the material permitted investigation of the interests of the social groups who produced the medical writings. The information on the authors of the texts discussed in this volume is limited and sometimes scarce, but often it was possible to identify their social standing. A careful reading of their texts has made possible inferences of who the targeted audiences of these texts were, and who the adversaries. Even in the case of unknown authorship, attempts have been made to situate the texts within the social landscape of the period. Generally speaking, the authors of the texts discussed in this volume came from a literate elite. As a consequence, we specify that the texts in this book reflect less the history of ‘medicine in China’ than that of the medicine of the elite in Imperial times: the history of ‘Chinese medicine’. Yet, as we shall see, this elite was diverse with regard to lineage tradition and\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\npersonal experience, functionary roles and loyalties within and towards the Imperial\n\ncourt, and its interests varied not only geographically but also over time.” The structure of the book This book is divided into six parts, each comprising two articles on a related theme. These articles are arranged in the order of the events discussed. They are best read as detailed case studies that analyse important aspects of the complex history of Chinese medicine, but they do not aspire to present this history in any comprehensive way. By highlighting given conventions and controversies over them, each article addresses a change in medical doctrine and/or practice that can be viewed as innovative; ‘innovation’ being treated here as an overarching theme for new approaches to writing history of a premodern science. Part I describes ‘mai }JKand gi 4a’ as two of the most central notions that laid the foundations for Chinese medical reasoning among the medical elite in Imperial times. Even though their meanings varied with place and changed over time, and although in more recent history attempts were made to do away with these two concepts altogether, they deserve particular attention. Vivienne Lo and Elisabeth Hsu emphasise that they came to refer to subtle movements and changes imperceptible to the non-initiated, and although the two articles deal with geographically distant traditions, they both point out common aspects of a body conception in terms of the subtle mai and qi, findings which implicitly suggest that this opened up the field for medical speculation. Numerology provides in many traditional sciences a schema for ordering knowledge and a device for speculations about the future. Correlative thinking was not specific to the science of Chinese medicine. It was, as the articles in part II of the book, on ‘Correlative cosmologies’, show, already prevalent among ‘gentlemen with formulae’, fangshi Fy +, who predated the elite doctors in Imperial times, yi 3, by several centuries and later rivalled them, not least over clientele. Donald Harper focuses on some numerological considerations in iatromantic texts on the art of prognosticating the outcome of illness and how they became integrated into medical doctrine. This highlights aspects of how the first imposition of numerology onto Chinese medical reasoning led to the\n\n'S ‘Chinese medicine’, as a term in the singular, has the danger of invoking a unity of medical practice and doctrine when this term actually refers to a host of practices that first emerged among the elite in the Western Han and can be traced to the present day in numerous lineages of knowledge transmission. Aware of the plurality of different traditions that the term refers to and the controversies between them, one may be tempted to speak of ‘Chinese medicines’.\n\nS\n\nElisabeth Hsu\n\né\n\npredominance of Five Phase doctrine in Han medical writings which gave rise to what is commonly known as the ‘medicine of systematic correspondences’. Catherine Despeux discusses a second important event involving a numerological reorganisation in the history of canonical medical doctrine: it had its roots in the Tang dynasty and was in its full-blown form promulgated by the Song Imperial court, and led to what is known as the doctrine of the five circulatory phases and six seasonal influences (wuyun liugi\n\n#38 4) or ‘phase energetics’.’° Whereas the concepts mai and qi developed in the context of cautery and needling therapy and cleared the ground for medical authority to establish itself through numerologically dominated speculation, drug therapy did not play an important role in the formulation of the canonical Chinese medical doctrine and is considered for many centuries to have continued to be grounded primarily in empiricism.\"’ Part III, on ‘Dietetics and pharmacotherapy’, contains contributions that discuss innovations within the materia medica (bencao 7x #2), the third of the three main traditions of medical writing in addition to those on medical doctrine (benjing 7X #8) and formulae (fangji Fy |). These two contributions on bencao literature complement each other insofar as Ute Engelhardt discusses the categorisation of foodstuffs — waterchestnut and horse liver — and Frédéric Obringer focuses on a variety of rather toxic substances — arsenic compounds — and the innovative but short-lived technique used to produce them. Their juxtaposition highlights the general ambivalence that Chinese physicians had to drugs (yao 2) and alchemical traditions of drug intake. In Late Imperial China the era of the Han was often appraised as that of the genuine and original doctrine of Chinese medicine, and later writings were degraded to mere amendments. The two articles on ‘The canons revisited’ in part IV show that the reappraisal of canonical works in fact consisted of virulently innovative scholarship. The posthumously published Bencao gangmu 7X& AM & (Hierarchically Classified Materia Medica) (1596) by Li Shizhen 2 #% (1518-93) represents the pinnacle of the Chinese bencao literature. While this text is firmly grounded within the medical tradition, Georges Meétailié has repeatedly stressed its importance for the emergence of Chinese studies in natural history and the article in this volume provides ample evidence to corroborate his claim. Similarly, the Shanghan zabing lun (& 3 SER BR (Treatise on Cold Damage and Miscellaneous Disorders) written by Zhang Ji 5 機 in the Eastern Han is still today considered the most important work of the formulae '© Term used by Porkert, Manfred (1974), The Theoretical Foundations of Chinese Medicine: Systems of Correspondence, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 55-106.\n\n'’ According to Unschuld, Paul U. (1986), Medicine in China: a History of Pharmaceutics, University of California Press, Berkeley, 112, the first ‘pharmacology of systematic correspondences’ dates to the Song.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ntradition of medical writing. It was lost but reconstituted in the Song and, as Marta Hanson shows, its reappropriation by scholar—physicians of the Jiangnan area in the\n\nMing and Qing led to the formulation of the medical doctrine of warmth factor illnesses (wenbing xue {iim &) that ever since has rivalled the pre-eminence of the cold damage tradition. Whereas the two articles on the canonical grands oeuvres required extensive discussion, thereby reflecting the enormous wealth and complexity of knowledge they dealt with, part V, on ‘Medical case histories’, consists of articles of remarkable brevity and conciseness, by Christopher Cullen and Bridie Andrews. These two articles discuss Chinese physicians who themselves were much concerned with clarity in knowledge\n\npresentation and who outlined new ways of structuring information derived from the clinical encounter. Endeavours of this kind, which in the Ming gave rise to a new medical genre, are followed up through the Qing to the Republican period, where the adjustment to Western biomedical practice resulted in interesting modifications. While they have indeed led to a more direct integration of knowledge from treatment of individual cases, they are also shown to provide a standard schema for recording experience in medical practice. The book ends with a section on ‘Medical rationale in the People’s Republic’, part VI, which not only points out adjustments to a new political style but also indicates much diversity of current medical practice. Kim Taylor’s article focuses on a politically motived Western medical doctor who epitomised the movement of ‘new acumoxa’ (xin zhenjiu # + #% ) in the late 1940s and early 1950s and Volker Scheid compares two Chinese medical doctors and their prescriptions for treating dizziness (touyun 頭暈 and xuanyun fi% ‘& respectively) on the basis of ethnographic fieldwork in the mid-1990s. The controversies over Chinese medical practice that these two articles address are strikingly different. Where Taylor highlights unification through political indoctrination, Scheid emphasises pluralism in government-run institutions; where Taylor mentions application of the Soviet sciences, Scheid stresses adaptation of Western medicine; and where Taylor shows how canonical knowledge was done away with, Scheid delves into tracing medical lineages and establishes genealogies of drug prescriptions. These changes of recent decades involve an accentuation of those of the previous two millennia.\n\nInnovation, convention, and controversy The student interested in the history of science may wonder what can be learnt from this inquiry into a premodern non-Western medical science. It is futile to try to summarise the multilayered articles of this volume in one final paragraph, for the changes\n\n10\n\nElisabeth Hsu\n\n,\n\nidentified as ‘innovation’ are rather diverse in kind. Nevertheless we may note that one of the most frequently encountered innovations discussed in this volume arises from combining knowledge from different traditions of learning. This combination of knowledge sometimes led to the emergence of a novel doctrine or a new literary genre. Another kind of medical innovation consisted of the reordering and reinterpreting of existent medical knowledge that gave rise to entirely new fields of inquiry. It could also involve a formulaic structure for presenting already existent knowledge, an aspect characteristic of medical case histories. Numerological systematisation was yet another form of such formulaic knowledge presentation, and the two chapters treating innovations of numerological systematisation (in part II) discuss two of the most important and long-lived innovations in Chinese medical doctrine. Notably, most of the articles are concerned with innovation in ‘literary technology’ and only one deals with a technical invention. Given that some of the articles point to the self-awareness of the actors that they were doing something new, while others identify an innovation, often on structural grounds, without having any information of the actors’ attitude at all, we acknowledge that in this book the notion of innovation has been applied to a premodern science, regardless of whether the innovation was proclaimed as such or not.\n\nEditor’s note This book brings together research on Chinese medicine from fairly different strands. Given the variety of translations of Chinese medical terminology — most notably by Manfred Porkert, Paul Unschuld, and Nathan Sivin — and the continuing search for adequate translation, I promised from the very start not to impose adherence to a particular terminology throughout the book. For the reader this means that the same Chinese medical term may be approximated in translation by a whole variety of different English words. Therefore great editorial effort was directed at giving a Chinese medical term both in the official transcription system pinyin (also in citations originally given in other transcription systems) and in Chinese characters. This should allow the reader to recognise the same term even when its translation varies in different articles. I also refrained from standardising the translation of book titles and from imposing use of particular editions of the Chinese works — it is a regrettable but dire reality for researchers on Chinese medicine that some of the best editions of canonical works are not widely available. Dates of composition, compilation, or publication are similarly difficult to standardise, and I have adopted the dates given by the individual authors. Book and chapter titles are therefore consistently referred to by their Chinese names, and only well-known works, such as the Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon (Huangdi neijing) and the like, are first mentioned in English.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIl\n\nThe articles deal with a wide range of distinct aspects of Chinese medical knowledge and practice and references are therefore listed at the end of each article; their thematic\n\npresentation should enhance clarity and also encourage entry into this burgeoning field of study. They are generally divided into two sections: the first section contains premodern Chinese and Japanese works and the second section contains modern works in any language, listed alphabetically by their authors’ names. Recently unearthed manuscripts are generally found in the second section under the name of the research\n\ngroup or individual researcher who annotated and transcribed them. At the beginning of each of the six parts, the two articles of the section are summarised and contextualised. These part introductions are primarily intended to tease out and highlight those processes discussed in the articles that gave rise to the innovations in question.\n\nPART\n\nI\n\nMai and qi in the Western Han\n\nIntroduction In the late Warring States a literate elite had established itself in various localities, including as geographically disparate areas as those of present-day Hunan and Shandong provinces, where the medical texts presented in this part come from. Modern scholarship has drawn a vivid picture of the intellectual activities of the nobility and their retainers, their beliefs and convictions, art and technology, and also their daily life.' In this milieu the two concepts mai ff and gi 44, were combined to form the foundations of the elaborate system of Chinese medical doctrine. In chapter 1, Vivienne Lo asks how it was that the notion of gi came to be seen as the basic vital substance that it is in the Chinese ‘medical canons’ (such as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon (Huangdi neijing = #7 A #&) and subsequent medical works). In this context she also inquires why names of acumoxa loci (xuewei 7< 4\\Z), in contrast to channel (mai) names, often convey a strong metaphoric imagery that transposes geographic, architectural, and social landmarks onto the body. Mai figures as a prominent term among what Lo calls ‘acumoxa-related writings’. For instance, in the so-called ‘Cauterisation Canons’ or ‘vessel texts’, which were unearthed from a tomb in Mawangdui closed in 168 BC, mai are conveyed as routes around the body. Their course is described with verbs of motion, referring to a movement along or through an anatomical location. The description of their course generally begins at the extremities and ends in the body’s trunk or head, without further specification of internal structures and functions. Mai are in general differentiated from each other depending on whether they run along the upper or lower extremities (arms or legs), and in terms of yin K£ and yang {§%. Their names refer to qualities of yin and yang that express a gradation which remains difficult to interpret, from the yangming [4A to the taiyang KG\n\nto the shaoyang ’)>( and from the taiyin * (to the shaoyin /}> R& to the jueyin 厥陰 ' See for instance Harper, Donald (1998). Early Chinese Medical Literature: the Mawangdui Medical Manuscripts. Routledge, London, 3-183. * Since only eleven mai (and not the twelve canonical ones, namely three yin and three yang of feet and\n\narms) are described, one of these qualities is not mentioned, the jueyin in the arm.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nMai and qi in the Western Han\n\nThematically, these texts consist of two parts. The first informs on the course of the mai, and the second part attributes to each mai a series of illness conditions that are said to be alleviated by cauterising the mai.’ In these ‘acumoxa-related writings’ the mai thus have a primarily classificatory function for therapeutic intervention. Vivienne Lo’s chapter builds on the recognition that the Mawangdui medical manuscripts — which were found in the same lacquer box and probably intended for the same readership — include various genres. She distinguishes between the above genre of ‘acumoxa-related writings’ and another genre that she calls ‘nurturing life literature’.\n\nThese two genres anticipate the categories of zhenjiu $+ (acupuncture and moxibustion, or acumoxa for short) and yangsheng “+ (nurturing life), common in later literature but not attested in the Mawangdui medical corpus. However, regardless of their naming, Lo convinces the reader that the literary styles of the two genres differ significantly. She points out that the ‘Cauterisation Canons’ give a dispassionate view of the body, and that their descriptions of the body are primarily visual. She contrasts this view of the body with that in one of the works belonging to the ‘nurturing life literature’, a text on the sexual arts entitled ‘Harmonising yin and yang’ (He yinyang 合 陰 ), 陽 Which portrays human sensuality with a poetic lyricism that depicts the body as a landscape of mountains, rivers, surging seas, and other metaphors of the natural and human world as it was conceived at the time. There is no mention of acumoxa /oci in the ‘Cauterisation Canons’, and Lo suggests that the metaphors designating body parts in the sexual arts texts were later incorporated, as names of acumoxa /oci, into medical writing. They figure in ‘medical canons’ that were compiled a few centuries later and have been transmitted to us in extant works that have continued to the present day to be regarded as canonical. In the medical canons the visually perceived mai from the Mawangdui acumoxa-related writings are littered with /oci with names reminiscent of the subjectively felt sensuality recorded in the Mawangdui nurturing life literature. The innovation that Lo discusses thus arises from a conflation of two different genres of body description. Lo furthermore points out that the notion gi, which is generally not mentioned 1n the acumoxa-related writings,* is frequently encountered in the ‘nurturing life literature’. In texts on the sexual arts ‘the extension of gi’ (zhang qi 45a) describes the sensations of the woman during her orgasm, ‘the arrival of gi’ (qi zhi 氣 @ ) the sensation of the > This is so according to one but not the other edition of the ‘Cauterisation Canons’, the ‘Foot-Arm\n\nEleven Vessels Cauterisation Canon’ (Zubi shiyimai jiujing 2 & -— kA). * There is one exception, a sentence in the ‘Document of the Mai’ (Maishu ft #), which interrelates\n\nmai and qi in the context of discussing therapeutic techniques, and Lo takes it as the earliest extant evidence of acumoxa therapy, which she defines as the therapeutic application of needling in order to manipulate gi.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nman in that moment;° and what she calls augmenting and strengthening gi are presented as a common principle of proper sexual conduct and breathing techniques. In the nurturing life literature, gi, which was later to become one of the predominant concepts of medical discourse, refers to subjectively felt sensations in the body. Lo suggests that this language of subjective experience, developed in the genre of nurturing life literature, was transferred to that of describing the body in terms of mai, and in the process made possible more sophisticated ways of medical reasoning. For the full-blown system of Chinese medical doctrine to emerge the person had to be seen as a whole and medical language had to have a means to account for both the body in anatomical terms and the subjective sensual experience of the individual. Elisabeth Hsu, in chapter 2, comes to the same conclusion: she noticed that the twenty-five medical case histories in the biography of a Western Han doctor, Chunyu Yi @F#, recorded in the Shiji (Records of the Historian) (ca 90 BC), invariably concerned illness designated by the term bing 3% rather than the more commonly used word ji #R of contemporaneous non-medical writings. Her systematic investigation of bing (disorder) in the Zuo zhuan ~& {& (Zuo Tradition) revealed that, apart from other meanings, bing frequently referred to the emotional state of a person who is aggrieved, often as a result of a previous dispute. On these grounds she suggests that bing in the Shiji case histories reflects an understanding of illness with regard to a person as a mind— emotion—body complex. This ‘holistic’ view of personhood is often stressed as one of the characteristics of Chinese medicine, but because of the uncritical ways in which it is currently used, the term ‘holistic’ has become meaningless. The finding that medical language included words for expressing subjective sensual experience and emotional distress is better interpreted from a different angle. Considering that the Mawangdui medical manuscripts were found in a tomb of the nobility in the Han kingdom of Chu 4%, and that the medical cases in the Shiji were recorded by a doctor sought by the nobility of mostly the kingdom of Qi #*, we may conclude that it was within the social stratum of the elite that this language began to be cultivated. Insofar as terms like gi and bing reflected an increased attention to cognitive and emotional processes, we may say that the vocabulary of this language had ‘psychologising’ tendencies. In a similar vein, we observe a transformation of the notion mai from a term for somatic structure to a more subtle concept. The mai, with their clearly demarcated routes, that according to Lo were visually perceived, appear to be anatomical entities in the Mawangdui vessel texts, but in the medical case histories of the Shiji, they are more difficult to define: the doctor examines the mai and as a result senses different qualities > In later acumoxa texts gi zhi indicates that needling has been successful.\n\n16\n\nMai and qi in the Western Han\n\nof gi. Hsu therefore proposes to render mai in translation as ‘vessel-pulses’ or as ‘pulses’ (nota bene, not the kind of pulses that biomedicine recognises). Compared with the above understanding of gi and bing, the notion mai is probably less psychologised, while it has a newly acquired sense of ‘impulsion’ and ‘movement’ that goes beyond the purely anatomical and alludes to a reality of bodily processes for which a materialist worldview has neither recognition nor vocabulary. The Shiji medical case histories contain the first textual evidence to date of a repeatedly endorsed and systemic interrelating of mai and gi, which in Hsu’s analysis was done with the intention of determining the names of different bing. Hsu therefore pro-\n\nposes to regard this text as the earliest extant account of Chinese pulse diagnostics. The notion of gi, as already said, is not mentioned in the Mawangdui vessel texts, and this is corroborated by the finding that gi in the Shiji is never put in correlation with any of the Mawangdui designations of mai in terms of taiyang or jueyin and the like. Hsu observes that by contrast gi is often related to the standard five viscera of the medical canons, namely the liver (gan f+), the heart (xin .t»), the spleen (pi }#), the lungs (fei fiji), and the kidneys (shen ®). The finding that in the Shiji chapter 105.2 it is mostly the gi that correlates with the five viscera which are detected in the mai deserves further attention. It may well indicate that gi and the five viscera were first in correlation with each other, and that the viscera were correlated with the mai only in a second step. Hsu’s article, together with ongoing unpublished research on the first five chapters of the book called Plain Questions (Suwen # [4]), which constitutes the first book of the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon, suggests that it was only after correlating the viscera with the mai that gi started to flow in the mai. She proposes to view the diagnostic procedure of examining mai to detect qualities of gi as laying the foundations for a systemic correlation between the five zang viscera and the mai vessel-pulses. According to Bridgman,° the correlations differed from those given in the later medical canons, with their Jocus classicus in chapter 10 of the Divine Pivot (Lingshu # fm), the second book in the Yellow Emperor ’s Inner Canon; but Hsu’s preliminary evidence contests Bridgman. Medical authority had reached a stage of self-assertion that degraded the patient’s perception of pain and illness to unspecific ailments and superficial complaints. Now it was the physician who had the knowledge and authority to detect the underlying condition. In Chunyu Yi’s medical case histories gi did not only have the sense of subjectively felt ‘breath’, but figured also in cosmological discourse: the person as a microcosm was linked through the intermediary of gi to external workings in the ° Bridgman, R. F. (1955), ‘La Médicine dans la Chine Antique’, Mélanges Chinois et Bouddhiques 10, 141-5.\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nmacrocosm. The elaborate system of Chinese medical reasoning was made possible not only by psychologising the medical conditions of a person, but also by embedding the person in the environment and taking account of the seasons, the climate, and the ecology. Hsu points out that these case histories had a highly formulaic structure, similar to the\n\nstructure of ‘models’ for jurisdiction in Qin law which prescribed how an official should record individual cases, and she suggests that the recording of each unique case within such a general matrix made it possible to account for illness (bing) in a multi-faceted and systemic way. Within a schema identified through linguistic markers Chunyu Yi is shown consistently to provide a name, a cause, and a justification for naming a client’s illness.’ The justification for naming specific bing, which implies, as Hsu emphasises, a sophisticated notion of illness, is couched in the terminology of the elusive concepts mai and gi. Medical authority asserts itself by claiming to have access to esoteric knowledge that gives it the capacity to recognise subtle changes, imperceptible to the non-initiated, in a systemic way. In this context it is worth mentioning that from the very beginning the medical authority of the elite did not present itself as a homogenous unity; Shiji 105.2 mentions adversaries, both internal and external. The external ones Yi dismissively refers to as the ‘common doctors’ (zhong yi 5A 8), and he accuses them in seven cases of misdiagnosis, and in one even of iatrogenic illness. In two cases Yi refers to adversaries who have name and position, and seem to have a degree of medical learning similar to his own. In both cases the application of textual knowledge to the particular case in question becomes a matter of controversy. As the articles in the following parts will show, controversies of this kind continued in the centuries to come.\n\n” Yi concomitantly mentions his clients’ complaints and his own observations of what we would nowadays call ‘symptoms’, but these observations are not reported within that schema.\n\n1 The influence of nurturing life culture on the development of Western Han acumoxa therapy VIVIENNE\n\nLO\n\nWhen tomb no. 3 at Changsha {2 7} Mawangdui & = 3, a burial mound outside the capital of the old Han kingdom of Chu #, was first opened in the early 1970s, scholars could hardly have predicted the degree to which its contents would revolutionise the history of Chinese medicine.’ Nearly thirty years later the silk and bamboo manuscripts, which the tomb had preserved since its closure in 168 BC, still provide a rich resource for lively debate and new insights into the state of the heavens, the earth, and human society during the early Western Han period. Archaeologists have opened numerous tombs in Chu and elsewhere which have offered up further material for comparison. This study will focus on the texts excavated at Mawangdui and at one other tomb (no.\n\n247) at Jiangling 7T\n\nZhangjiashan 張家 山 .\n\nEvidence from Mawangdui has filled gaps in our knowledge of the relationship of spirit mediums or shamans and their magical practices and incantations to early Chinese medicine.’ Recipe texts such as ‘Wushi’er bingfang’ + —3# 77 (Recipes for Fifty-two Illnesses), the largest text of the medical finds, give detailed instructions of how to prepare treatments for specific, named illnesses.* Remedies might include ' The Mawangdui\n\nburial mound\n\nis located in the northeastern\n\nsection of Changsha,\n\nHunan.\n\nIt\n\ncontains three tombs. Tombs no. 1 and no. 2 belonged to the Lord of Dai #k, Li Cang #!] &, and his wife (who was buried in tomb no. 1). Tomb no. 3, from which the manuscripts were excavated, was occupied by one of their sons, who died in 168 BC at the age of about 30. For the excavation report see Hunansheng bowuguan and Zhongguo kexueyuan kaogu yanjiusuo (1974). Details of the find are also in the introduction to Mawangdui Han mu boshu zhengli xiaozu (1980). * On the dating of the Zhangjiashan tomb in Hubei and the identity of its occupant, see Zhangjiashan Han mu zhujian zhengli xiaozu (1985). See also Gao Dalun (1995), 3-7, and Shi Yunzi (1994). It seems that the earliest date for the closure of the tomb is 186 BC with a latest date of 156 BC.\n\n> In a number of articles Harper introduces the magical aspects of Warring States medical practice. See for instance Harper (1985). His findings are collected together in Early Chinese Medical Literature 中\n\n(1998), 42-68 and 148-83. The texts did not originally bear titles. I use those given by Mawangdui Han mu boshu zhengli xiaozu\n\n(1985).\n\n19\n\n20\n\nVivienne Lo #\n\ncautery, the preparation of herbs and animal substances, often selected for their magical properties. Many specify incantations and exorcism of the kind that would require the help or tuition of a specialist intermediary. Among the Mawangdui medical manuscripts there is also important evidence of a new medicine in its infancy — a medicine related to correlative cosmology and its theories of yinyang. Central to the new medicine are texts which conceptualise the body in mai [jg (channels)’ and an examination of the mode of construction of this concept of mai is the basic task of this chapter. Both tombs, at Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan, have provided manuscripts that change our understanding of the mai,° which were fundamental to the development of classical medical theory first formulated in Han times. Their titles and descriptions bear similarities to the jingmai #& fk (conduits, circulation tracts) of later acumoxa theory and the texts are therefore early examples of a textual genre that we can trace to later compilations such as Huangdi neijing Lingshu $2 7 |W XE & He (Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon: the Numinous Pivot).’ The Mawangdui medical manuscripts include two such > Mawangdui Han mu boshu zhengli xiaozu (1985) contains the official transcription of the Mawangdui medical manuscripts as well as photographs of the originals. Ma Jixing (1992) also provides a transcription and full commentary for all of the medical texts (for many of the texts a modern Chinese rendering is also supplied). The texts are thought to be no earlier than the third century BC. See Ma Jixing (1992), 92.\n\nA translation of the entire corpus of the Mawangdui medical manuscripts is in Harper (1998). © The word mai is difficult to translate. Harper (1982) translates ‘vessel’, which draws out the early association with the arteriovenous system. I prefer to follow the contemporary analogy with channel (du 7)\n\nor ‘canal’ found in the ‘Maishu’ ft # (Channel Document). See Jiangling Zhangjiashan Han jian zhengli xiaozu (1989), 74 (hereafter, ‘Maishu’ shiwen). The translation ‘channel’ also serves to emphasise the relationship of the mai to the superficial anatomical channels as defined by muscle and bone, as\n\nthey were understood before the more elaborate theories of the jingluo and jingmai found in Huangdi neijing #77 (8 (Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon). Jingluo or jingmai has been variously translated as ‘conduit’, ‘meridian’, ‘circulation tract’, etc. As the focus of this paper is the excavated medical writing from Hubei and Hunan, which is representative of an earlier period, it is not necessary to commit to a definitive translation of the terms at present. See Sivin (1987), 34, 122 note 11; and Unschuld (1985),\n\n75, 81-3. ’ Huangdi neijing is a corpus now extant in three recensions, the Taisu (* # Great Basis), the Suwen ( & Fj Basic Questions), and the Lingshu ( ti Numinous Pivot). See Sivin (1993). Each of these is a compilation of small texts dealing with separate topics which may reflect the thinking in a distinct medical lineage. It is thought that the earliest texts were set down during the first or at the earliest the second century BC. Collectively they represent the kind of debate through which classical medical concepts matured. In this respect they act as a convenient marker against which to assess the form and content of the excavated texts. For an extended discussion of the development of medical theories in China based\n\non a clarification of the formation of the Huangdi neijing, see Yamada (1979); for a reassessment of the origins of acumoxa, see Unschuld (1985), 93-9. Since the discovery of the excavated manuscripts, most medical historians now agree that an essential fusion of the technical and theoretical elements\n\nat the foundation of acumoxa therapy could not have happened much before the first two centuries BC. See Sivin (1993) and Yamada (1979). The canons of acumoxa must also include Huangfu Mi’s\n\nLhenjiu jiayijing St FA Z.26 (AB Canon of Acumoxa) (AD 256-82) and the Nanjing ##X& (Canon of Difficulties) (first or second century AD), the latter of which is translated in Unschuld (1986).\n\nThe influence of nurturing life culture\n\n21\n\ntexts; their Chinese editors have given one of the texts the title of ‘Zubi shiyimai jiujing’ / B= + — ik (Cauterisation Canon of the Eleven Foot and Arm Channels; hereafter, ‘Zubi jiujing’) and the other they have called “Yinyang shiyimai jiujing’ 陰陽 十\n\n— fk # #\n\n(Cauterisation Canon of the Eleven yin and yang Channels; hereafter,\n\n“Yinyang jiujing’). Two editions of this latter text were found at Mawangdui, yet another edition was found at Zhangyjiashan as part of a compilation titled ‘Maishu’ fk = (Channel Document). ‘Maishu’, I shall argue, is the earliest treatise to set down explicitly the theory and practice of acumoxa. Among the manuscripts which were folded together in a rectangular lacquer box at Mawangdui there was a significant amount of writing that set out the philosophy and techniques of nurturing life (vangsheng #+£). use the term ‘nurturing life’ to refer to those techniques broadly aimed at physical cultivation and longevity which formed a part of elite culture during the Western Han period. The yangsheng practices documented in the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan medical manuscripts include therapeutic gymnastics, dietetics, breath- and sexual-cultivation. The Zhangjiashan manual of therapeutic gymnastics (daoyin #5] literally ‘guiding and pulling’), known as ‘Yinshw’ &| 2° (Pulling Document), and parts of the Mawangdui manual ‘Shiwen’ + fj (Ten Questions) are of particular significance to this study. Both ‘Shiwen’ and two further works from Mawangdui that I shall cite, the “Tianxia zhi dao tan’ KF 248 mw (Discussion of the Highest Way Under Heaven) and ‘He yinyang’ & k= (Harmonising yin and yang), specialise in sexual-cultivation. In these three texts sexual-cultivation practice is often combined with elements of breathcultivation,’ a combination which later Daoist and medical literature preserves alongside other yangsheng practices.'® Yangsheng focuses on preserving and strengthening the body, and the Mawangdui texts give fine detail of technique and practice. It is therefore a significant branch of medicine and was viewed as such by the book collectors who placed yangsheng literature together with other texts that concentrated\n\n° ‘Yinshu’ transcript can be found in Zhangjiashan Han jian zhengli zu (1990), (hereafter, ‘Yinshu’ shiwen), accompanied by a detailed analysis by Peng Hao (1990).

A comparison of language and concepts evident in early descriptions of the mai with the body as it is revealed in yangsheng literature will demonstrate the differences between these two genres of medical literature. At a time when literature describing the mai barely recognised an organised movement of gi 44 through the body, when it made no clear reference to acumoxa points, when correspondences with yin and yang were barely elaborated, the yangsheng literature reveals all of this and more. Can we then see a link between yangsheng culture of the late Warring States to the early Imperial period and the medical theory and practice found in the acumoxa canons?’* To answer this question I shall refer extensively to the Huangdi neijing compilation, the title most famous for its exposition of classical acumoxa theories. This paper, for the first time, will begin to explore the contribution that the observation and recording of a phenomenological experience of ‘own’ body, unique to yangsheng literature, made to classical Chinese medical thought. Observations about the body in yangsheng literature reflect a realm of human experience that, for obvious reasons, is not evident in medical literature that describes the illness and cure of other bodies. Where the eyes cease to organise and control their environment, visualisation may free our physical space through the practice of meditation. Breath-cultivation may bring increased vitality and a clarity of the spirit, feelings elicited in sexual arts may landscape the body with mountains, rivers, and spurting seas. In this liminal world the body may become a universe, a temple, or a continent.’ An elaborate code which could at once embrace the body in its spiritual, physical, geographic, and political dimensions was to become a recurring device throughout Daoist literature.\n\nA yangsheng culture In describing the body in its relationship with the macrocosmos, early Chinese yangsheng literature brings a metaphysical language into the realm of human physical experience. With its focus on longevity rather than pathology, it sets down a standard physiology of the internal environment of the body. Yangsheng techniques, then, describe many ways to assert control over this physiological process. The primary\n\n'' The Han shu ‘Yiwen zhi’, juan 30, 1776—80, lists books contained in the Han court library around the\n\nend of the first century BC.

Seenote7. °° Schipper (1993), 100-12.\n\nThe influence of nurturing life culture\n\n23\n\nobject of the present study is to examine the dynamic between the medical fields of yangsheng and the newly emerging medical models of the body based upon the mai.\n\nThe criteria for defining exactly which kind of activity came under the umbrella of nurturing life varies according to the period. By the time of the tenth-century Japanese medical work Ishinpd %& > Fy (Recipes at the Heart of Medicine), a compilation that preserves a great deal of early Chinese material, the ‘Yangsheng’ chapter includes such diverse topics as sleep, clothing, and propriety of language. Five of the practices listed in the Ishinpo are already represented in the literature of Mawangdui and\n\nZhangjiashan.'* Mawangdui practices also include the daily ingestion and application of mineral drugs, ingestion of talismans, and ritual interdiction. Recognised as coming under the general rubric of yangsheng are contemporary callisthenic exercises in revived form such as taiji quan (Re) and gigong (5,3), the therapeutic movement practised by young and old in Chinese city parks in the morning. The preponderance of nurturing life texts among the burial goods in the tombs at Zhangjiashan and Mawangdui suggests that the courtly elite of Chu were familiar with the way of life advocated in the texts. I argue elsewhere that a figurine, buried five hundred miles away in south-west China, also testifies to the more general spread of nurturing life culture.’ Burial goods were similar in design and quality, so it seems likely that the rich culture in the Chu tombs, which was once thought to be exclusive to the southern kingdom, is representative of the central core of elite society in the provincial courts and military outposts of the empire in the early Western Han period. Despite the fact that yangsheng is an evolving category during the Warring States period and does not, by itself, refer to all the practices it later embraces, it is still relevant to consider the emergence of different types of physical activities for enhancing life as a distinctive trend. The above mentioned ‘Record of Literary Pursuits’ (Yiwen zhi) in the Han shu lists eight sexual-cultivation works which testify that they formed a significant part of mainstream medical literature. Many Warring States writers also seem to know practices akin to nurturing life culture. Breath-cultivation and meditation are particularly common. References to nurturing life practice emerge incidentally in comment or as a more conscious part of a health care regime. The references are not always complimentary. Zhuangzi #¢\n\n'* Ishinpé, juan 27, 449-59. For some remarks on the sources of the nurturing life material, see Barrett (1980). The five practices are breath-cultivation (yongqi FA 氣 , 95/797 & 5A), sexual-cultivation (fangnei FQ), therapeutic gymnastics (daoyin 5|), regulated sleep (wogi EA #E), and dietetics\n\n(tiaoshi HB). '® The figurine is made of black lacquered wood and has red lines which run from head to foot. An analysis of the lines and how they relate to the channels of acumoxa theory as well as other medical practices such as yangsheng can be found in He Zhiguo and Lo (1996).\n\n24\n\nVivienne Lo\n\n(fourth — second centuries BC) criticises people who nurture the body (yangxing £72) as falling short of the true dao #§ (the way): To huff and puff, exhale and inhale, blow out the old and draw in the new, do the ‘bear-hang’ and the ‘bird-stretch’, interested only in long life — such are the tastes of the practitioners of ‘guide-and-pull’ exercises, the nurturers of the body, Grandfather Peng’s ripe-old-agers.’°\n\nHis is a transcendent, less physical approach to life that is reminiscent of the cults of immortality. We can, perhaps, view immortality cults as an extreme extension of yangsheng culture.'’ Elsewhere, in an obvious reference to the practice of breath-cultivation,\n\nZhuangzi says that ‘the realised man breathes with his heels’.’* Mengzi #-$ (late fourth century BC) differentiates between the benefits of breathing gi of the morning and that of the evening in nurturing man’s original heavenly nature. Mengzi sees this practice as inseparable from cultivating moral character. Cultivating courage and rightness comes\n\nthrough nourishing the flood-like gi (haoran zhi qi 浩然 之 氣). Early descriptions of these life-enhancing practices show the development of a subjectivising of philosophical thought which had begun with ideas attributed to Yang Zhu 1% (fl. late fourth century BC). Yang Zhu, or the Yangists, suggested that it is our primary responsibility to protect and nourish our heaven-given nature so that we can live out the time decreed to us. For his followers, prioritising a more subjective, inner experience of life is part of their aim to free judgement from the artifice of an external social morality. Other writers simply described ways of strengthening and nourishing human nature. Perhaps this was to attune themselves to the qualities of heaven, to still the heart in meditation — and in doing so they created a language for the internal environment of the body and simultaneously opened up a new dimension to philosophy. Immediate human experience became a vehicle for understanding the external world and, through the principle of resonance, a mode through which one could exert influence upon it. This belief in resonance was the fundamental principle of a theory of rulership that can be detected in Lunyu i ag (Analects) (third — second centuries BC) of Confucius (traditional dates: 551-479): The Master said, ‘If a man is correct in his own person, then there will be obedience without orders being given; but if he is not correct in his own person, there\n\nwill not be obedience even though orders are given.’”°\n\n人 Zhuangzi, juan 6, pian 15, 1; transl. Graham (1981), 265. '’ Harper (1998), 114. '8 Zhuangzi, juan 6, pian15,2. |? Mengzi, juan 6, 58; tr. Lau (1970), 77. 0 Lunyu ae, pian 13, zhang 6, 143; tr. Lau (1979), 199. See also Legge (1935), 266.\n\nThe influence of nurturing life culture\n\n25\n\nOnce the ruler behaved correctly, a civilising effect would spontaneously radiate from his very person through the administrative structure. Lunyu describes a form of selfcultivation through study and an attendance to social propriety. But the theory that in\n\ngovernment a good ruler should concentrate on perfecting his personal actions, patterning his behaviour after heaven, whilst leaving practical administration delegated throughout the bureaucracy achieves full elaboration in Liishi chungiu (Mr Lii’s Spring and Autumn) (ca 239 BC):\n\n咯氏 春秋\n\nOne able to nourish what Heaven generates and not interfere with it is called ‘Son of Heaven’... This is why officials are established; the establishment of\n\nofficials is to keep life intact.” In many different philosophic and political works, the influence of the conduct of the ruler is understood to be critical to harmony in the environment. Even the Han Fei zi (we JE =) (third century BC) suggests that focus and simplicity combined with the principle of non action (wuwei # #,) are the desired qualities for effective authority. Jv\n\nAuthority should not be seen, in simplicity with no action. With business in the four quarters, remain at the centre. The sage holds to the essential principles and the four quarters come to serve him. In emptiness he awaits them and they sponta-\n\nneously do what is needed.” Only Mo Di & @ (fl. late fifth century BC), possibly a carpenter and therefore the only artisan amongst the philosophers,” does not refer to nurturing life practices. He is singularly unconcerned about the distinction between the gentleman and the common man. His philosophy does not elevate culture and tradition, the trappings of the elite, but honours utility, the virtue of a craft. This exception suggests that cultivating bodily gi in the pursuit of long life was exclusively a part of the lifestyle of an educated elite. Self-cultivation was a gentlemanly pursuit but it was sometimes at variance with the demands of court society. Zhang Liang 5 f2 (d. 187 BC), the strategist and military advisor to Liu Bang #1 #8, first emperor of the Han dynasty (reigned 202—195 BC), was a famous self-cultivator. After recurrent illness he took to practising daoyin and dietary techniques, leaving society to live as a recluse in company with the immortal, Master\n\nRed Pine 7A.” Some scholars in the early Western Han period might have opposed ideas of ruling through attention to the kind of self-cultivation that focused on the body, rather than\n\n2!

But the two approaches were\n\nnot necessarily in contradiction. Both provided the literati with tools for self determination; as guardians of a written history which described the emperor as the pivot between heaven and earth they were indispensable to the throne. By developing self-help techniques for enhancing and lengthening life, they both freed their bodies from the calamities of ghosts and demons and, at the same time, strengthened themselves against the vicissitudes of heaven (the influence of the weather). Their lifestyle, as well as their learning, both distinguished them from the common people and empowered them at the expense of other practitioners. “Yinshu’ begins with a text which sets out an appropriate seasonal lifestyle in great detail. It describes a regime for personal hygiene, diet, breath-cultivation, exercise, and sexual practice in great detail. This is the prescription for life in summer and autumn. On summer days wash the hair more frequently and bathe less; do not sleep late. Eat more vegetables. Get up early and after passing water, wash and rinse the mouth with water, pick the teeth, loosen the hair and pace slowly in front of the house. After a while drink a cup of water. Enter the chamber” between dusk and midnight (when it is time to) cease. Increasing it will harm the gi. On autumn days bathe and wash the hair frequently; in drinking and eating your fill indulge the body’s desires. Enter the chamber whenever the body is nourished\n\nand derives comfort from it. This is the way of benefit.”°\n\nBA> BK > mR > BR CEI) > SRK () > Bw (RB) > RK FARR CK) > Bi > GK) Bo RAP > MAM RK—-H (FF) © ABE SEMI > MAG: KA > BIBI M (tk) SMAAK (%) 身所 浴。 入 宮 。, 以 身 所 利安 , 此 利 道也 。 The concluding passages of ‘Yinshu’ are a statement about the value of breathcultivation and daoyin in distinguishing class. In the spirit of the philosophy attributed to Yang Zhu, the nobility moderate their behaviour through physical training to protect themselves and preserve their vitality. But the behaviour itself also sets them apart from the ignorant masses. The reason that nobility get illness is that they do not harmonise their joys and passions. If they are joyful then the yangqi is in excess. If they are angry then the yingi is in excess. On account of this, if those that follow the Way are joyful then they quickly exhale (warm breath) (xu If), and if they become angry they increas-\n\ningly puff out (moist breath) (chui ¥x), in order to harmonise it.”’ They breathe in the quintessential gi of heaven and earth to make yin substantial, hence they will *° “Enter the chamber’ (ru fang A =) is a euphemism for sexual activity.\n\n© “Yinshu’ shiwen (1990), 82. *7 Ma Jixing (1992), 826 note 17, discusses different techniques of breathing.\n\nThe influence of nurturing life culture\n\n27\n\nbe able to avoid illness. The reason that lowly people become ill is exhaustion from their labour, hunger and thirst; when the hundred sweats cease, they plunge\n\nthemselves into water and then lie down in a cold and empty place.

On account of this\n\nthey have many illnesses and die easily.”®\n\n貴人 之 所 以 得 病 者 , 以 喜 其 怒之 不和 也 2 > @WG BEA Ay (My) > RABI 實 其 陰 , 故 能 毋 。病 賤人 之 所 以 得 ( 絕 ), BAK > REAR Zh > RE 弗 智 ( 知 ) Be) (Mg) Be OF) 而 除去 之 ,\n\n。 喜 (KK) 病者 , (AM) 是\n\n則陽 > 以 勞 卷 UK 以 病 多\n\n氣多 , 怒 則 陛 ( 陰) 氣 和 之 。 吸 天地 之 精 氣 ( 倦) 饑 ,潟 白 汗央 > BAR > A (ML) 而 易死。\n\nHaving established that members of elite society in late Warring States, Qin and Western Han society were at least familiar with yangsheng culture, whether they approved of it or not, I shall turn now to those texts that describe mai that were preserved alongside the Mawangdui and Zhangyjiashan yangsheng literature.\n\n*‘Maishw’\n\nThe newly excavated Western Han textual sources that describe the mai have already altered our perception of the early development of acumoxa’s channel theory. Physiological speculation is primitive when compared to received medical literature. The excavated texts do not reveal the network of channels systematically associated with the internal organs or a network of acumoxa points that we know as the mature acumoxa system. Their channels proceed in more parallel fashion along the limbs to the torso and head. They sometimes cross, but they do not join at the ends to form a continuous ring. The practice of lancing the body is mainly associated in these texts with abscess bursting, and the principles of practice related to the channels are extremely basic. These early texts document a first systematic attempt at the kind of physiological speculation that we see in later medical literature. When we come, for example, to examine references to gi in the excavated texts, we shall see that the authors of the early acumoxa texts did not conceive of a complex circulation or physiology of qi. ‘Maishu’, a manuscript excavated at the Zhangjiashan burial site, is the most complete and comprehensive of the works that describe the mai and is, in my view, the earliest extant treatise to set out theories and practice of acupuncture, wherein an implement is used to pierce the skin in order to influence the movement of gi in the body. It comprises 65 slips. Harper divides the document into six core texts which he describes as ‘Ailment List’, ‘Eleven Vessels’, ‘Five Signs of Death’, ‘Care of the Body’, ‘Six 8 «Vinshu’ shiwen (1990), 86.\n\n28\n\nVivienne Lo\n\nConstituents’, and ‘Vessels and Vapor’. Three of these — ‘Eleven Vessels’; ‘Five Signs of Death’; and ‘Vessels and Vapor’ — are editions of texts in the Mawangdui medical manuscripts. Harper’s titles indicate well the content of each text. I shall adopt his\n\ndivisions, numbering the texts (1)—(6). Gao Dalun & XK ‘/, using a different schema, conflates the last three.” Malshu (1) is a lexicon of illnesses and illness characteristics. It is organised by superficial anatomy listing sixty-seven illnesses beginning from the head and moving down to the soles of the feet. In part, the text constitutes an early attempt at differential diagnosis which bears a relationship to some of the categories worked out in the recipe text ‘Wushi’er bingfang’. It does not define the illnesses according to the kind of physiology that we will see in the remaining ‘Maishuw’ texts. ‘Maishu’ (2) is an edition of the Mawangdui ‘Yinyang shiyimai jiujing’. It describes the course of eleven different channels that run between the extremities and the head. The route of each channel is followed by a list of symptoms associated with a pathology of that channel. ‘Maishu’ (3) is an edition of the Mawangdui “Yinyang mai sihou’ fEE5 Aik 5b 4& (Death Signs of yin and yang Vessels). It differentiates between yin and yang pathology in recognising terminal conditions. ‘Maishu’ (4), ‘Care of the Body’, recommends movement and moderation as the secret to long life. This suggests the same philosophy evident in ‘Yinshu’s daoyin regimen. It is a statement which is repeated in Liishi chungiu.*° Now flowing water does not stagnate, when the door pivots there will be no woodworm because of their movement. When there is movement then it fills the four limbs and empties the five viscera, when the five viscera are empty then the jade body will be benefited. Now one who rides in a carriage and eats meat, must fast and purify themselves in spring and autumn. If they do not fast and purify themselves then the mai will rot and cause death.\n\nMalshu (5) is peculiar to Zhangjiashan. It provides early analogies for six different parts of the body: bone (gu 3), sinew (jin #7), blood (xue If), channel (mai fijK), flesh (rou [4]), and qi. It follows by attributing a particular quality of pain to each part. Pain indicates the onset of serious physical decline and this text serves as a warning to those who do not take positive action to counteract this deterioration. ‘Maishu’ (6) is a complex piece of writing that may constitute three separate texts. The first part describes the movement of gi and how to influence its flow. This is followed by a very practical guide to abscess lancing. ‘Maishu’ ends with the earliest\n\n*? Gao Dalun (1992).\n\n*° Liishi chungiu, juan 3, pian 2, 136.\n\nThe influence of nurturing life culture\n\n29\n\nextant record of pulse taking. Together these elements add up to the most basic principles of acumoxa practice. Harper concludes that the combination of these final texts in ‘Maishu’ is indicative of the influence of macrobiotic hygiene (1.e. yangsheng nurturing life practice) in the development of vessel (i.e. channel) theory.*’ The aim of the present study is to test this\n\nhypothesis using source material from ‘Maishu’ and the yangsheng manuscripts from Mawangdui. The following passage from ‘Maishu’ (6) will form the key extract upon which I identify the incidence of acupuncture in the excavated texts.*” Another edition of this passage exists among the Mawangdui medical manuscripts and has been assigned the title of ‘Maifa’. But key lacunae in the ‘Maifa’ obscure the meaning of the passage which in its recovered state refers to ‘cautery’ and not to body piercing. In the following extract we will find the most sophisticated of physiological ideas represented in ‘Maishuw’ and the earliest extant treatise to document a link between body piercing and a formal movement of gi. For the first time, a text describes gi as a medical phenomenon\n\nsubject to control by another.*° The channels are valued by the sages. As for gi, it benefits the lower body and harms the upper; follows heat and distances coolness. So, the sages cool the head\n\nand warm the feet.** Those who treat illness take the surplus and supplement the insufficiency. So if gi goes up, not down, then when you see the channel that has over-reached itself, apply one cauterisation where it meets the articulation.” When the illness is intense then apply another cauterisation at a place two cun\n\nWwW tO\n\nWw\n\n' Harper (1998), 32. I differentiate ‘acupuncture’ from blood-letting and other minor surgery by the target of medical intervention. Acupuncture, as I define it, is the act of piercing the body with the intention of moving gi in the channels. 33 “Maishu’ shiwen, 74. ** This sentence could also mean that ‘the sages have cool heads and warm feet’, and if they practise what they preach indeed they should have. However, the focus of this section appears to be on the principles\n\nof therapy and so we have translated as if it were a therapeutic situation. °° The recurrence of huan #8 in the next sentence after the preposition yu # suggests that huan FRx could not be a verb. Harper (1998), 214, translates as ‘ring’ and speculates that huan refers to the waist. My view is that the ‘ring’ is the articulation of the joints. The very next sentence suggests that the interven-\n\ntion is made at the joints, by specifying treatment at the place where the gi comes out at the elbow or knee creases. By applying cauterisation around the joints one can expect to change the direction of movement of gi in the body. In this treatment a stone lancet is used to remedy the situation. Once the points for acumoxa were standardised it is easy to see that the point distribution was concentrated around the joints. One can imagine that a natural articulation which at the same time was a narrowing of the body could be considered a significant impediment to a movement of gi through the body. The gi\n\nmight be visualised as becoming squeezed and obstructed at this point, just as water swirls backwards when it meets a lock. See note 40.\n\n30\n\nVivienne Lo é\n\nabove the articulation.

In this passage from ‘Maishu’ (6), gi is understood to move downwards and to the extremities and this is borne out in contemporary texts that describe the practices of breath-cultivation and daoyin.*° The following exercises taken from ‘Yinshu’ demon-\n\nstrate this principle in daoyin.*’ Ailing from Jao li & (35) #8 (3) liquor.®® The prescription for pulling is: grasp a staff in the right hand, face a wall, do not breathe, tread on the wall with the left foot, and rest when tired; likewise grasp the staff in the left hand, tread on the wall with the right foot, and rest when tired.

No such circuit is evident in the way the channels are formed in ‘Zubi jiujing’ and ‘Yinyang jiujing’, the excavated channel texts, where the anatomical references are given in an order that begins at the\n\nextremities and travels to the head. If gi were travelling in this direction it would be contrary to the natural movement given in ‘Maishu’ (6) quoted above. On the evidence of this passage and ‘Maishu’ (2), the text that contains descriptions of the route and direction of the channels, we can, therefore, dismiss the concept of circulation as a feature of the excavated texts.\n\nClassical medical writings From Huangdi neijing we can see that within two centuries following the closure of the Western Han tombs, the body was conceived as a complete microcosm of the external environment. A regulated flow of qi, the vital substance of life, was as basic to physical health as it was to the harmony of heaven and earth, and the channels through which it flowed were as carefully mapped as the waterways of the empire.*” The yin and yang viscera or the solid and hollow organs of the body (zangfu [ix ff), were also described as Officials of state with responsibility for the various ministries — for economy, for\n\nplanning, and for upright judgements.”’ In Huangdi neijing correspondences with yin and yang have transcended the basic sequence of opposites of light and shade, heaven and earth to become fundamental principles in human physiology, as well as in the classification of different physical substances and conditions, both normal and pathological. Stages in yinyang transformation explain states of health as well as the aetiology of disease. The acumoxa channels themselves even have acupoints that reflect the construction of the universe, the structure of the Empire, the Imperial palace, and the geography of China in their names. Amongst the acupoints are the heavenly pivot (tianshu K #i), body pillar (shenzhu & #£), sun and moon (riyue 4 A), spirit hall (shenting ## f=), and illuminated sea (zhaohai FR}).\n\n*° Lingshu, juan 3, pian 10, 1-9. *° In The Way of Water, Allan (1997), 39—40, describes how, in Chinese mythology, ‘directing water’ was the first step to a civilised world. Channelling gi into routes around the body, like digging irrigation ditches and flood control canals, marks a significant stage in bringing the body, conceived as natural process, under human control. In Lingshu 12 the rivers and streams of the body reflect the natural, rather than man-made, waterways of China, see n. 52. Once the analogy between the channels\n\nand man-made water courses has been made, all the qualities and techniques of directing and controlling water can then be applied to the movement of bodily qi. 生 Suwen 8, juan 2, pian 8, 1-2. Is the locus classicus for a representation of the body as a reflection of the Imperial structure, ‘the spleen and the stomach are the officers in charge of the granaries, the five flavours emerge from the large intestine who is the officer of the passage ways . . .” Unschuld (1985), 79-83, sets out some of these ideas. See also Chiu (1986), 73-7.\n\n32\n\nVivienne Lo\n\n.\n\nThe body is an intricately mapped out mirror of the macrocosm.” But how did this come about? How did the body begin to embrace the greater construction of the universe?\n\nA creative tension\n\nHow does the yangsheng literature relate to the medical texts that describe how to manage illness in other people? As all the literature came out of the same lacquer box at Mawangdui, we can assume their physical proximity means that all the manuscripts enjoyed a similar readership.” But do the ideas that the different genres of medical writings express emerge at the same time, in the same social context? To answer this question we must consider the dynamic nature of technical and conceptual developments and their reflection in literature during the early Imperial period. At a cursory glance it is easy to see that such concepts as yin BE, yang [%, essence (jing #4), spirit (shen ##), and gi 54 are more prevalent in some of the texts and barely appear in others. Cosmological explanations, for example, are not a significant feature of the pharmacologi-\n\ncal texts, but are ubiquitous in the descriptions of breath-cultivation in ‘Shiwen’.“ Rather than list the similarities between the assumptions of the yangsheng and the evolving acumoxa literature, it is more fruitful to investigate the differences between the two genres, before the medical synthesis of the ensuing centuries. Such a comparison will serve to emphasise that, for example, in exploring a language to express sexual relationships such texts as ‘He yinyang’ contributed a unique dimension to the development of later medical concepts. In fact there 1s a great deal of evidence to show that in the Western Han dynasty medical concepts were in the process of being worked out through the medium of different disciplines.*° Some contemporary attempts at categor-\n\nisation were destined for extinction.” “ Unschuld (1985), 51—100. ** Nurturing life texts are kept or catalogued next to the medical texts and in later works certainly refer to\n\nthe same body of knowledge. 44\n\n45\n\nWile (1992), 19-23, lists many points of similarity between the medical texts and those on the sexual\n\narts. He concludes that much is borrowed from medicine. My concern in this paper is what is borrowed back, what the special focus of, for example, the sexual practices eventually contributes to medicine. In later nurturing life literature there are many different constructions of the body that utilise terms and concepts which reflect the imperatives of the particular practice for which they were created. In the sexual arts the gate of life ( 4it F1 mingmen) will relate directly to the reproductive organs and be located deep inside the body. The same terminology in later acumoxa treatises refers to a point just beneath the\n\nskin between lumbar vertebrae two and three which can easily be penetrated with a needle, or affected 46\n\nby the heat of moxa, without damaging the tissue of the body. In a text that attributes the various stages of fetal development to wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, the\n\nFive Agents (wuxing 7.47), one stage is also attributed to stone (shi 4), apparently the sixth. This sixth agent was not to be adopted into later tables of correspondence. See Mawangdui Han mu boshu zhengli x1aozu (1985), 136.\n\nThe influence of nurturing life culture\n\n33\n\nItis not my thesis that the authors of what came to be viewed as classical medical treatises took on ideas from yangsheng culture wholesale, but that in the construction of the acumoxa body,”’ they selectively adopted some of the perspectives that had been refined through the older yangsheng studies. In order to understand the mode of construction of the classical medical body it is necessary to explore the dynamic between representations in such canons as Huangdi neijing and representations taken from earlier Western Han medical cultures found in the excavated texts. In particular, to demonstrate the priority of important features of classical Chinese medicine in yangsheng literature, I will compare the lyrical descriptions of the surface of the body found in sexualcultivation with more mundane representations of the exterior of the body in ‘Maishu’, where we find the earliest extant treatise on acumoxa theory and practice. The second task of this chapter will be to identify the influence of yangsheng culture, and in particular breath-cultivation, on the concept of a formalised movement of gi in the body. Included in the discussion will be an examination of early methods of influencing the movement of gi and how they had a bearing on the critical transition from the perception of gi as an independent external phenomenon, to the idea that it filled the body and was amenable to human intervention. In these two stages I will provide ample evidence to identify the influence of yangsheng on the development of classical medical theory.\n\nLandscaping the body By comparing ‘Maishu’ (2) and ‘He Yinyang’ we can begin to see how images of the social world were first brought to the surface of the body. In ‘Maishu’ (2) the body is described in simple terms inspired by superficial anatomy. In contrast, the lyrical descriptions of the sexual arts landscape the body with images of the natural and human world, with mountains and seas, bowls and stoves. The same perception of the body can be traced to the names of the acumoxa points in later medical classics such as Huangdi\n\nneijing Lingshu or Zhenjiu jiayi jing te A CZ. R8(AB Ca"
