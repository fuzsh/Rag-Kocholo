Decision-making on coastal development based on ESV estimation is significant for the sustainable utilization of coastal resource. In this study, coastal land-use changes in Zhejiang Province during rapid urbanization were discussed based on remote-sensing derived land-use maps created in the years 1990, 2000 and 2010. The ESV changes in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province from 1990 to 2010 were estimated by using the established ESV estimation model. The analysis results demonstrate the following: (1) with the continuous acceleration of urbanization, land-use types in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province changed significantly from 1990 to 2010, demonstrated by considerable growth of urban construction land and reduction of forest land and farmland; (2) in the study period, the total ESV in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province continuously decreased in value from RMB 35.278 billion to 29.964 billion, a reduction of 15.06%; (3) in terms of the spatial distribution of ESV, the ESVs in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province were generally converted from a higher ESV to a lower ESV; (4) estimates of ESV for the three years 1990, 2000 and 2010 appear to be relatively stable; and (5) land-use intensity in coastal zones in Zhejiang Province continuously increased during the 20 years. The spatial distribution of land-use intensity was consistent with that of the ESV change rate. Disordered land-use changes from forestland and farmland to urban construction land was a major cause of ESV loss.\n\n[Dynamics of recent cultivated land in Zhejiang Province and relevant driving factors].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Hai-dong; Yu, Dong-sheng; Shi, Xue-zheng; Liu, Ying-an; Wang, Shi-hang; Zhang, Guang-xing; Liu, Yang\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThrough the human-computer interactive interpretation of the 2000, 2005, and 2008 remote sensing images of Zhejiang Province with the help of RS and GIS techniques, the dynamic database of cultivated land change in the province in, 2000-2008 was established, and the driving factors of the cultivated land change were analyzed by ridge regression analysis. There was a notable cultivated land change in the province in 2000-2008. In 2000-2005 and 2005-2008, the annual cultivated land change in the province arrived -1.42% and -1.46%, respectively, and most of the cultivated land was changed into residential and industrial land. Non-agricultural population rate, real estate investment, urban green area, and orchard area were thought to be the main driving factors of the cultivated land change in Zhejiang Province, and even, in the developed areas of east China.\n\n[Molecular epidemiological study on rubella virus strains isolated in Zhejiang province, China, 2005-2010].\n\nPubMed\n\nFeng, Yan; Zhong, Shu-ling; Xu, Chang-ping; Shi, Wen; Lu, Yi-yu\n\n2011-09-01\n\nTo analyze the molecular epidemiological characteristic of rubella virus strains isolated in Zhejiang province from 2005 to 2010, to provide basic data for rubella prevention and control. Rubella virus strains were isolated on Vero cells from the suspected patients' specimens collected in Zhejiang province during 2005 to 2010. Partial fragments of the structural gene of Zhejiang rubella strains were amplified, using nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The amplified products were sequences and analyzed. In total, 7 rubella strains were isolated from 52 clinical specimens, of which six were classified as genotype 1E and only one was characterized as genotype 2B. In the phylogenetic tree, the Zhejiang 1E genotype rubella strains were located in the same branches with Hongkong or Hainan isolates respectively, but the Zhejiang 2B genotype strain were located in the same branch with oversea strain BuenosAires. ARG/46.08. Through p-distance analysis, results also showed that the Zhejiang 2B genotype strain was closer to the 2B strains isolated from overseas (0.011) than those strains from other provinces of China (0.023). Compared with Chinese vaccine strain BRD II, the homology on three structural genes was C > E2 > E1, but the homology of deduced amino acid sequence was E1 > C > E2, with corresponding 3, 11 and 23 amino acid mutations. There was only one amino acid on E1 gene with entropy value higher than 0.600, but seven sites on E2 gene with entropy value appeared higher than 0.600 and one with entropy value higher than 1.000. Two genotypes of rubella virus had circulated in Zhejiang province during 2005 to 2010. Genotype 1E appeared to be the predominant genotype and 2B being an imported one. Amino acid sequence of E1 gene from Zhejiang rubella strains was comparatively conserved, but E2 gene was hypervariable. Study on rubella virus E2 and C gene should be conducted in the epidemiological surveillance program of rubella.\n\n[Pollutant production and discharge from livestock and poultry industries and land carrying capacity in Zhejiang Province].\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Kai-ying; Liu, Jian; Chen, Xiao-xia; Dai, Xiao-rong; Feng, Shang-lian\n\n2009-12-01\n\nBased on the investigation of pollutant production and discharge from a typical scale pig farm in Zhejiang Province at three pig growth stages (piglets, fattening pigs, and sows) in the autumn and winter 2007 and the spring and summer 2008, the coefficients of pollutant production and discharge from the pigs as well as the total annual pollutant production and discharge from the farm were estimated. In the meantime, the annual application amount of animal manure to the farmlands in Zhejiang Province was estimated by using these coefficients and the livestock and poultry inventories in Zhejiang Province in 2007. It was estimated that the total amount of applied animal manure in the Province in 2007 was 2106.8 x 10(4) t x a(-1), containing 13.57 x 10(4) t x a(-1) of N, 6.7 x 10(4) t x a(-1) of P, 0.11 x 10(4) t x a(-1) of Cu, and 0.20 x 10(4) t x a(-1) of Zn. The pig-manure-equivalent farmland carrying capacity in the Province was 16.66 t x hm(-2) a(-1), and the average alarm limit was 0. 37. The application of animal manure in some areas of Zhejiang Province had exceeded the alarm limit for the land carrying capacity, and made a potential environmental threat.\n\n[A cross-sectional study on iodine nutrition in general population from Zhejiang province, China].\n\nPubMed\n\nMo, Zhe; Lou, Xiao-ming; Zhu, Wen-ming; Wang, Xiao-feng; Mao, Guang-ming; Zhou, Jin-shui; Ding, Gang-qiang\n\n2013-05-01\n\nTo understand the current status of iodine nutrition among the community residents to compare the level of iodine nutrition in different areas and groups of populations in Zhejiang province. Stratified cluster sampling method was adopted and residents from twenty-two communities in Zhejiang province were selected. A cross-sectional survey was conducted, using questionnaires, laboratory tests, on urinary iodine, water iodine and the concentration of the iodine in salt, which had played positive roles in the calculation of the level of iodine nutrition. of the iodine nutrition in this cross-sectional survey were as follows: the median water iodine and salt iodine of Zhejiang were 2.42 Âµg/L and 28.8 mg/kg, respectively. The coverage of iodized salts was 79.54%, with the ingesting rate of qualified iodized-salt as 76.65% and the median content of urinary iodine in the population of Zhejiang was 161 Âµg/L. The average iodine content among pregnant women was 138 Âµg/L, with the percentage of samples less than 100 Âµg/L as 25.92%, more than 300 Âµg/L as 15.30%. The proportions of iodine intake through water, salt and other foods were 1.70%, 76.41% and 21.89%, respectively. The status of iodine nutrition in Zhejiang province in general seemed to be appropriate, but the level of iodine nutrition in pregnant women was less than the requirement, which should call for attention.\n\nThe Measurements of the Equity of Compulsory Education Finance in Zhejiang Province\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGang, Cheng; Tao, Lin; Qiaozhen, Lin; Qinghuan, Zhu\n\n2009-01-01\n\nEducation equity is an important means for achieving social equity, but there are few empirical studies on education equity in Chinese academia owing to method limitations.

Methods Thirty cities/counties/districts from Zhejiang Province were selected using stratified cluster sampling approach. Children under five years in these areas were enrolled as the subjects. The U5MR and its contributors were analyzed in terms of age, migration status of mothers, and other indicators using classic descriptive methods and Chi square test. Results The U5MR in Zhejiang Province showed a declining trend from 14.83â° in 2000 to 9.49â° in 2009. In 2009, the U5MR was significantly higher in the rural areas than in the urban areas (9.14â° vs.6.50â°, P<0.01) and among floating populations than among local residents (12.12â° vs. 6.42â°, P<0.01). Preterm birth/low birth weight was the leading cause of U5MR in 2009. More specifically, preterm birth/low birth weight, congenital heart disease, and birth asphyxia were the top three causes of deaths among infants (<1 year), while drowning, traffic accidents, and accidental falls were the leading causes of deaths among children (1-4 years). Conclusion The U5MR in Zhejiang Province in 2009 differed between urban areas and rural areas and between floating populations and local residents. The main causes of death differ between infants and young children. Prevention of preterm birth/low birth weight and congenital anomalies will reduce infant death, while the main intervention for young children is to avoid accidental injuries.

Based on meteorological indices of tea growth and daily meteorological data from 1971 to 2010 in Zhejiang Province, three climate suitability models for single climate factors, including temperature, precipitation and sunshine, were established at a 10-day scale by using the fuzzy mathematics method, and a comprehensive climate suitability model was established with the geometric average method. The results indicated that the climate suitability was high in the tea growth season in Zhejiang Province, and the three kinds of climate suitability were all higher than 0.6. As for the single factor climate suitability, temperature suitability was the highest and sunshine suitability was the lowest. There were obvious inter-annual variations of tea climate suitability, with a decline trend in the 1970s, less variation in the 1980s, and an obvious incline trend after the 1990s. The change tendency of climate suitability for spring tea was similar with that of annual climate suitability, lower in the 1980s, higher in the 1970s and after the 1990s. However, the variation amplitude of the climate suitability for spring tea was larger. The climate suitability for summer tea and autumn tea showed a decline trend from 1971 to 2010.\n\nMolecular Epidemiology and Prevalence of Echovirus 30 in Zhejiang Province, China, from 2002 to 2015.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Yin; Sun, Yi; Yan, Juying; Miao, Ziping; Xu, Changping; Zhang, Yanjun; Mao, Haiyan; Gong, Liming\n\n2017-12-28\n\nEchovirus serotype 30 (ECHO30) has been responsible for several recent worldwide outbreaks of viral meningitis. In Zhejiang Province, China, ECHO30 has been one of the main causes of viral meningitis for years. This study, using phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene, was performed to investigate the general molecular epidemiology and genetic patterns of ECHO30 circulating in Zhejiang Province between the years 2002 and 2015. The nucleotide sequences of ECHO30 VP1 showed that they were 64.8% identical with the prototype strain, Bastianni, while the amino acids were 84.9% identical. Phylogenetic analyses showed that ECHO30 in the Zhejiang area has diverged into two genotypes. Genotype I consists of strains isolated since 2002, whereas genotype II includes strains that were mainly isolated during the 2002 to 2004 outbreak. ECHO30 has been endemically circulating in both humans and the environment for a long period of time. Additionally, we evaluated the significance of recombination presented during the years 2005 to 2007 to demonstrate that recombination plays an important role in the prevalence of ECHO30 in the Zhejiang area.\n\nAluminium in food and daily dietary intake assessment from 15 food groups in Zhejiang Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Hexiang; Tang, Jun; Huang, Lichun; Shen, Xianghong; Zhang, Ronghua; Chen, Jiang\n\n2016-06-01\n\nAluminium was measured in 2580 samples of 15 food groups and dietary exposure was estimated. Samples were purchased and analysed during 2010 to 2014. High aluminium levels were found in jellyfish (mean 4862Â mg/kg), laver (mean 455.2Â mg/kg) and fried twisted cruller (mean 392.4Â mg/kg). Dietary exposure to aluminium was estimated for Zhejiang residents. The average dietary exposure to aluminium via 15 food groups in Zhejiang Province was 1.15Â mg/kg bw/week, which is below the provisional tolerable weekly intake of 2Â mg/kg bw /week. Jellyfish is the main Al contributor, providing 37.6% of the daily intake via these 15 food groups. This study provided new information on aluminium levels and assessment of aluminium (Al) dietary exposure in Zhejiang Province of China.\n\nPaleosols of the Mid-Cretaceous: A Report from Zhejiang and Fujian, SE China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLI, Xianghui; CHEN, Sidun; CAO, Ke; CHEN, Yunhua; XU, Baoliang; JI, Yannan\n\nAn investigation on the mid-Cretaceous continental sediments was recently conducted in both SW Zhejiang and SW Fujian Provinces, SE China. It is the first time the Cretaceous paleosols in mainland China have been reported. Three types of paleosols are recognized, such as, argillisol, calcisol, and oxisol on the basis of observation on eleven cross sections and stops in the field. The argillisol is characterized by burrow and root trace within reddish (silty) mudrock, the calcisol marks by pedogenic carbonate concretion within pale purple calcareous mudrock, and the oxisol is the association of ferric tegument and concretion within reddish purple, grayish orange siltstone, and mudrock. According to climate direction of paleosol types, it is proposed that it could have been in aridity or semiaridity of subtropic climate during the Aptian-Albian epoch of the mid-Cretaceous in SW Zhejiang, where the calcisols were recorded in the Hengshan Formation, Zhongdai Formation, Jinhua Formation, Guantou Formation, and Chaochuan Formation; at the same time, it was in semiaridity of tropic climate in SW Fujian which was recorded by oxisols within the Bantou Formation, Junkou Formation, and Shaxian Formation. In the Cenomanian, it could become more moist in SW Zhejiang as evidenced by the production of the argillisol within the Quxian Formation with abundant organic activities, whereas the paleoclimate in SW Fujian in the Cenomanian might be similar with that in the Aptian-Albian even if the sediments were transformed to huge thick conglomerates (so-called \"Danxia Landform\") by tectonic uplift processes.\n\nDiagnosis, treatment and outcome of glutaric aciduria type I in Zhejiang Province, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYang, Lili; Yin, Huaiming; Yang, Rongwang; Huang, Xinwen\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSummary Background Glutaric aciduria type I (GA I; MIM 231670) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. This article reports our experience in the diagnosis, treatment and outcome of GA I patients in Zhejiang Province, China. Material/Methods A total of 129,415 newborns (accounting for approximately one-tenth of the annual births in Zhejiang Province) and 9640 high-risk infants were screened for inborn errors of metabolism in the Neonatal Screening Center of Zhejiang Province during a 3-year period. Tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used for diagnosis of the patients. Dietary modification, carnitine supplementation and aggressive treatment of intercurrent illnesses were adapted for GA I patients. Results Three infants were diagnosed with GA I by high-risk screening (detection rate: 1/3,213) and 2 were diagnosed by newborn screening (incidence: 1/64,708). Four patients (3 by high-risk screening and 1 by neonatal screening) undergoing MRI examination showed remarkable changes on T2-weighted image. Four patients accepted timely treatment, and in the patient diagnosed by neonatal screening, treatment was delayed until hypotonia appeared 3 months later. Neuropsychological assessment showed mental and motor retardation in 3 patients after treatment, including the patient diagnosed by neonatal screening. Conclusions Individualized timely treatment and close monitoring of GA I patients needs to be optimized in China. Appropriate communication with parents may help to achieve successful management of GA I patients.

A total of 2,738 malaria cases were identified in Zhejiang Province from 2005 to 2014, of which 2,018 were male and 720 were female. Notably, only 7% of malaria cases were indigenous and the other cases were all imported. The number of malaria cases increased from 2005 to 2007, peaked in 2007, and then decreased from 2007 to 2011. There were no indigenous cases from 2012 to 2014. Of all cases, 68% of cases contracted Plasmodium vivax, 27% of cases contracted P. falciparum, and two cases contracted P. malariae. About 88% of malaria cases during 2005â2011 occurred yearly between May and October, but the number of malaria cases in different months during 2012â2014 was similar. The median age was 33 years, and 1,892 cases occurred in persons aged 20â50 years. The proportion of businessmen increased and the proportion of migrant laborers decreased in recent years. The median time from illness onset to confirmation of malaria cases was 5 days and it decreased from 2005 to 2014. Some epidemiological characteristics of malaria have changed, and businessmen are the emphases to surveillance in every month.

This study aimed mainly at identifying the possible causes of poor fertilizer N use efficiency (NUE) of rice in Zhejiang by comparing farmers' fertilizer practice (FFP) with advanced site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) and real-time N management (RTNM). The results showed that compared to FFP, SSNM and RTNM reduced DMA and NA before panicle initiation and increased DMA and NA at post-flowering. There is no significant difference between SSNM and FFP in post-flowering dry matter redistribution (post-DMR) and post-flowering nitrogen redistribution (post-NR). These results suggest that high input rate of fertilizer N and improper fertilizer N timing are the main factors causing low NUE of irrigated rice in the farmer's routine practice of Zhejiang. With SSNM, about 15% of the current total N input in direct-seeding early rice and 45% in single rice could be reduced without yield loss in Zhejiang, China.\n\nImproving the maternal mortality ratio in Zhejiang Province, China, 1988-2008.\n\nPubMed\n\nQiu, Liqian; Lin, Jun; Ma, Yuanying; Wu, Weiwei; Qiu, Ling; Zhou, Aizhen; Shi, Wenjun; Lee, Andy; Binns, Colin\n\n2010-10-01\n\nmaternal mortality remains a major public health problem in many countries. The aim of this paper is to describe the progress made in maternal health care in Zhejiang Province, China over 20 years in reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR). Zhejiang Province is located on the mid-east coast of China, approximately 180km south of Shanghai, and has a population of 49 million. Almost all mothers give birth in hospitals or maternal and infant health institutes. the annual maternal death audit reports from 1988 to 2008 were analysed. These reports were prepared annually by the Zhejiang Prenatal Health Committee after auditing each individual case. China has made considerable progress in reducing the MMR. Zhejiang has one of fastest developing economies in China, and since the 86 economic reforms of 1978, health care has improved rapidly and the MMR has declined. During the 1988-2008 period, 2258 maternal deaths were reported from 8,880,457 live births. During these two decades, the MMR decreased dramatically from 48.50 in 1988 to 6.57 per 100,000 in 2008. The MMR in migrant women dropped from 66.87 in 2003 to 21.67 per 100,000 in 2008. The rate of decline was more rapid in rural areas than in the city. There has been a decline in the proportion of deaths with direct obstetric causes and a corresponding increase in the proportion of indirect causes. The proportion of deaths classified as preventable has declined in the past two decades. Social factors are important in maternal safety, and on average 26.8% of maternal deaths were influenced by these factors. as the economy was developing, maternal safety was made a priority health issue by the Government and health workers. The provincial MMR has dropped rapidly and is now similar to the rates in developed countries and lower than that in the USA. However, more work is still needed to ensure that all mothers, including migrant workers, continue to have these low rates. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Information on the cases was collected and followed by genomic DNA extraction. Gag gene fragments were amplified by nested PCR, followed by sequencing and bio-informatic analysis. The rate of success for sequence acquisition was 74.3% (225/303). Distributions of HIV subtypes were as follows: CRF01_AE (58.7%), CRF07_BC (13.8%), CRF08_BC (9.8%), B' (15.1%), C (1.8%), G (0.4%) and unassigned BC (unique recombinant form 0.4%). from the HIV BLAST analysis showed that the sources of strains with the highest homology involved in 10 provinces/municipalities (Liaoning, Guangxi, Yunnan, Henan, etc.) and five other countries (Thailand, Vietnam, India, South Africa and Libya). The CRF01_AE phylogenetic tree was divided into four clusters. The sequences of HIV/AIDS with homosexual transmission showed a gather in cluster 1, and mix with those infected through heterosexual contact. Circulating recombinant forms of HIV seemed to play a dominant role in Zhejiang province. Unique recombinant form and new subtype of HIV were found. People living with HIV under homosexual transmission and heterosexual transmission had a trend of interwoven with each other. Increase of both the diversity and complexity of HIV strains were also noticed in Zhejiang province.\n\n[Study on the etiological and molecular characteristics of aseptic meningitis epidemic in Zhejiang Province in 2002-2004].\n\nPubMed\n\nYan, Ju-Ying; Lu, Yi-Yu; Xu, Chang-Ping; Yu, Zhao; Gong, Li-Ming; Chen, Yin; Zhang, Yan-Jun\n\n2011-09-01\n\nIn order to confirm the cause of the outbreak of aseptic meningitis in Zhejiang Province in 2002-2004, trace the pathogen and analyze the molecular characteristics, 271 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and faeces specimens were collected from suspected patients. The virus strains from the specimens were isolated with RD and Hep-2 cell lines. The VP1 and VP4/VP2 genes of the isolated viruses were sequenced, and their phylogenetic and homology trees were also constructed. Of the total 271 samples, 78 Echovirus type 30 (E30) strains were isolated. All of the complete VP1 genes in 31 sequenced virus isolates of E30 were composed of 876 nt without any insertion or deletion, encoding 292 amino acids (aa). The identity of nucleotide and amino acid in VP1 gene were 84.7%-86.3% and 92.1%-94.2% between the 31 Zhejiang strains and the prototype strain Bastianni of E30, and 87.1%-99.4% and 96.2%-100% among the 31 Zhejiang strains, respectively. The Zhejiang strains of E30 in the phylogenetic tree of the VP1 gene were attributed into two branches of the G and H genotype, respectively. In G genotype, the Shangdong and Jiangsu E30 strains in 2003 among domestic strains and Ukraine E30 strain in 1999 among overseas strains had maximum similarity with the Zhejiang strains, while H genotype had maximum similarity with the Korea E30 strains in 2008. The phylogenetic tree of the VP4/VP2 genes was similar to that of VP1 gene. The results indicated that the outbreak of aseptic meningitis in Zhejiang Provinec in 2002-2004 was caused by the G and H genotypes of E30 strains existing simultaneously. The H genotype was a new variant strain, which was first isolated in Zhejiang Province in 2002.\n\nPrevalence of prior HIV testing and associated factors among MSM in Zhejiang Province, China: a cross-sectional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Runhua; Pan, Xiaohong; Ma, Qiaoqin; Wang, Hui; He, Lin; Jiang, Tingting; Wang, Dayong; Zhang, Yan; Zhang, Xingliang; Xia, Shichang\n\n2016-11-10\n\nMen who have sex with men (MSM) have become one of high-risk population for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, due to their multiple sex partners and unprotected anal intercourse. Promoting HIV testing is an effective strategy for the prevention and control of HIV infection. We assessed the factors associated with a prior HIV testing history, which could provide guidance for implementation of future HIV intervention programs. A cross-sectional study was conducted in three cities of Zhejiang Province, namely, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Wenzhou, using respondent-driven sampling, between December 2013 and June 2014. A face-to-face questionnaire survey was employed to collect relevant information about HIV testing. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with a prior HIV testing history. The adjusted rate of prior HIV testing among MSM in Zhejiang Province was 55.9Â %. The adjusted rates of HIV and syphilis infections among MSM in Zhejiang Province were 14.0Â % and 11.4Â %, respectively. A weighted multivariate analysis showed that MSM of older age were more likely to be tested, as were MSM with higher level of education, self-reported homosexuality and a higher frequency of receiving AIDS/sexually transmitted infections educational intervention in the past year. MSM with suicidal inclination and self-perceived lower possibility of HIV infection were less likely to report ever having undergone an HIV test. The prevalence of prior HIV testing among MSM in Zhejiang Province, China is low. Effective and more frequent interventional measures should be adopted to improve risk awareness and psychosocial support for younger, less educated MSM, and to encourage more MSM to undergo HIV testing.\n\nChanging Epidemiological Characteristics of Hepatitis A in Zhejiang Province, China: Increased Susceptibility in Adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Zhifang; Chen, Yaping; Xie, Shuyun; Lv, Huakun\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHepatitis A is a common acute hepatitis caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV). Annually, it affects 1.4 million people worldwide. Between 1991 and 1994, HAV infections were highly endemic in Zhejiang Province (China), with 78,720 reported HAV infections per year. Hepatitis A vaccine came on the market in 1995 and was implemented for voluntary immunization. Since 2008, hepatitis A vaccine has been integrated into the national childhood routine immunization program. To understand the current epidemiological profile of hepatitis A in Zhejiang Province since hepatitis A vaccine has been available for nearly two decades. This study used the 2005-2014 National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System data to evaluate the incidence rate of notified hepatitis A cases in Zhejiang Province. The overall trend of incidence rate of notified hepatitis A cases significantly decreased from 2005 to 2014 (P< 0.001). During the study period, the reported incidence rate in individuals aged â¤19 years declined to the historically lowest record in 2014. Compared with individuals aged â¤19 years, those aged â¥20 years showed the highest incidence rate (P< 0.001). Majority of HAV infected cases were Laborers, accounting for approximately 70% of reported cases. Childhood immunization strategy with hepatitis A vaccine seemed to be effective in decreasing notified hepatitis A incidence rate in individuals aged â¤19 years. Those aged â¥20 years were observed to be the most susceptible population. The vast majority of hepatitis A cases were notified among Laborers. Therefore, we strongly suggest that future preventive and control measures should focus more on adults, particularly Laborers, in addition to the current childhood hepatitis A vaccination programme.\n\nChanging Epidemiological Characteristics of Hepatitis A in Zhejiang Province, China: Increased Susceptibility in Adults\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Zhifang; Chen, Yaping; Xie, Shuyun; Lv, Huakun\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Hepatitis A is a common acute hepatitis caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV).

Methods: A total of 302 newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive patients were selected through stratified random sampling in Zhejiang in 2015. HIV-1 pol genes were sequenced successfully with reverse transcription PCR/nested PCR and phylogenetic analysis was conducted for 276 patients. Then a molecular epidemiologic study was performed combined with field epidemiological investigation. Results: Of 276 sequence samples analyzed, 122 CRF07_BC strains (44.2%), 103 CRF01_AE strains (37.3%), 17 CRF08_BC strains (6.1%), 9 B strains (3.2%), 6 CRF55_01B strains (2.2%), 5 C strains (1.8%), 1 CRF59_01B strain (0.4%), 1 CRF67_01B strain (0.4%), 1 A1 strain (0.4%), and 11 URFs strains (4.0%) were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 16 clusters with only 15.1% (34/225) sequences involved among CRF07_BC and CRF01_AE strains. The clustered cases in MSM were higher than that in populations with other transmission routes. And clusters existed between the populations with different transmission routes. Conclusion: The major strains of HIV-1 in Zhejiang are CRF07_BC and CRF01_AE. The HIV subtypes showed more complexity in Zhejiang. It is necessary to strengthen the surveillance for HIV subtypes, carry out classified management and conduct effective prevention and control in the population at high risk.\n\nRisk factors for avian influenza virus contamination of live poultry markets in Zhejiang, China during the 2015-2016 human influenza season.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Xiaoxiao; Wang, Qimei; Cheng, Wei; Yu, Zhao; Ling, Feng; Mao, Haiyan; Chen, Enfu\n\n2017-03-03\n\nLive bird markets (LBMs), being a potential source of avian influenza virus, require effective environmental surveillance management. In our study, a total of 2865 environmental samples were collected from 292 LBMs during the 2015-2016 human influenza season from 10 cities in Zhejiang province, China. The samples were tested by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Field investigations were carried out to investigate probable risk factors. Of the environmental samples, 1519 (53.0%) were contaminated by A subtype. The highest prevalence of the H9 subtype was 30.2%, and the frequencies of the H5 and H7 subtype were 9.3% and 17.3%, respectively. Hangzhou and Jinhua cities were contaminated more seriously than the others. The prevalence of H5/H7/H9 in drinking water samples was highest, at 50.9%, and chopping board swabs ranked second, at 49.3%. Duration of sales per day, types of live poultry, LBM location and the number of live poultry were the main risk factors for environmental contamination, according to logistic regression analysis. In conclusion, LBMs in Zhejiang were contaminated by avian influenza. Our study has provided clues for avian influenza prevention and control during the human influenza season, especially in areas where LBMs are not closed.\n\nIndicators of child health, service utilization and mortality in Zhejiang Province of China, 1998-2011.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Wei Fang; Xu, Yan Hua; Yang, Ru Lai; Zhao, Zheng Yan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTo investigate the levels of primary health care services for children and their changes in Zhejiang Province, China from 1998 to 2011. The data were drawn from Zhejiang maternal and child health statistics collected under the supervision of the Health Bureau of Zhejiang Province. Primary health care coverage, hospital deliveries, low birth weight, postnatal visits, breastfeeding, underweight, early neonatal (<7 days) mortality, neonatal mortality, infant mortality and under-5 mortality were investigated. The coverage rates for children under 3 years old and children under 7 years old increased in the last 14 years. The hospital delivery rate was high during the study period, and the overall difference narrowed. There was a significant difference (P<0.001) between the prevalence of low birth weight in 1998 (2.03%) and the prevalence in 2011 (2.71%). The increase in low birth weight was more significant in urban areas than in rural areas. The postnatal visit rate increased from 95.00% to 98.45% with a significant difference (P<0.001). The breastfeeding rate was the highest in 2004 at 74.79% and lowest in 2008 at 53.86%. The prevalence of underweight in children under 5 years old decreased from 1.63% to 0.65%, and the prevalence was higher in rural areas. The early neonatal, neonatal, infant and under-5 mortality rates decreased from 6.66â°, 8.67â°, 11.99â° and 15.28â° to 1.69â°, 2.36â°, 3.89â° and 5.42â°, respectively (P<0.001). The mortality rates in rural areas were slightly higher than those in urban areas each year, and the mortality rates were lower in Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Jiaxing regions and higher in Quzhou and Lishui regions. Primary health care services for children in Zhejiang Province improved from 1998 to 2011. Continued high rates of low birth weight in urban areas and mortality in rural areas may be addressed with improvements in health awareness and medical technology.\n\n[Exploration on academic thoughts of four medical families of acupuncture-moxibustion of the LING, YAN, SHI and SHENG in northern Zhejiang Province].\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Feng\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe academic origin and characteristics of medical families of acupuncture-moxibustion in northern Zhejiang Province were explored in this paper. With acupuncture-moxibustion characteristic of medical families in northern Zhejiang Province such as the LING (see text), the YAN (see text), the SHI (see text) and the SHENG (see text) analyzed and arranged, it was found out that taking the Internal Canon of Medicine as theory basis, their academic thoughts comprehensively absorbed acupuncture-moxibustion theories in all ages, and they continuously made innovations through constant practices, resulting in academic thoughts that focusing on application of acupuncture-moxibustion in clinic, using moxibustion for deficient illness and adopting acupuncture-moxibustion and Chinese herbs for severe and acute patients. The academic thoughts of medical families of acupuncture and moxibustion in northern Zhejiang Province are featured by unique acupoint selection and ma nipulation, thorough moxibustion methods and combined application of Chinese herbs and acupuncture-moxibustion, which is a clinical system of diagnosis and treatment with typical Jiangnan features.\n\n[Risk assessments and control strategies of plague in five key surveillance counties, Zhejiang province].\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Guoxiang; Ju, Cheng; Zhang, Rong; Zhang, Zheng; Sun, Jimin; Wang, Miaoruo; Zhang, Xiaohe; Ye, Xianming; Zhu, Zhihong; Xing, Jianguang; Liao, Xiaowei; Chen, Zhiping\n\n2015-10-01\n\nTo analyze the epidemiology data on plague in five counties in Zhejiang province and to evaluate the risk of plague in theses areas. We selected five monitoring stations as a risk assessment (Qingyuan county, Longquan city, Yiwu city, Wencheng county, and Ruian city) in Zhejiang province where the plague epidemic more serious in the history. At least one constant site and 1-4 variable sites where plague occurred in history were selected for monitoring. We collected the five counties (cities) surveillance data of indoor rat density, indoor Rattus flavipectus density, the Xenopsylla cheopis index of rat, the Xenopsylla cheopis index of Rattus flavipectus in 1995-2014. Isolation of Yersinia pestis was conducted among 171,201 liver samples and F1 antibody were detected among 228,775 serum samples. Risk matrix, Borda count method, and Delphi approach were conducted to assess risk of the plague of five counties (cities) in Zhejiang province. Indoor rat density in Qingyuan county, Longquan city, Yiwu city, Wencheng county, Ruian city was 1.58%-5.50%, 1.13%-9.76%, 0.56%-3.67%, 2.83%-16.08%, 7.16%-15.96%, respectively; Indoor Rattus flavipectus density of five counties (cities) was 0.08%-2.23%, 0-2.02%, 0-0.54%, 0.71%-5.58%, 0.55%-4.92%, respectively.

However, few of these studies have examined the role of humidity on temperature-mortality association. We investigated the joint effect between temperature and humidity on cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in Zhejiang Province, China. Methods: We collected data on daily meteorological and CVD mortality from 11 cities in Zhejiang Province during 2010â2013. We first applied time-series Poisson regression analysis within the framework of distributed lag non-linear models to estimate the city-specific effect of temperature and humidity on CVD mortality, after controlling for temporal trends and potential confounding variables. We then applied a multivariate meta-analytical model to pool the effect estimates in the 11 cities to generate an overall provincial estimate. The joint effects between them were calculated by the attributable fraction (AF). The analyses were further stratified by gender, age group, education level, and location of cities. Results: In total, 120,544 CVD deaths were recorded in this study. The mean values of temperature and humidity were 17.6 Â°C and 72.3%. The joint effect between low temperature and high humidity had the greatest impact on the CVD death burden over a lag of 0â21 days with a significant AF of 31.36% (95% eCI: 14.79â38.41%), while in a condition of low temperature and low humidity with a significant AF of 16.74% (95% eCI: 0.89, 24.44). The AFs were higher at low temperature and high humidity in different subgroups. When considering the levels of humidity, the AFs were significant at low temperature and high humidity for males, youth, those with a low level of education, and coastal area people.

A multi-stage sampling was applied. Around 6600 subjects were enrolled for questionnaire survey from December 2010 to January 2011 in Zhejiang province. Survey data were input by EpiData 3.0 software, and the the status of awareness on tuberculosis (TB) in the public and impact factors were analyzed by SPSS 13.0 software package. A total of 6546 subjects were investigated, the response rate was 99.18% (6546/6600), 3306 were male and 3240 were female, the age of subjects was (44.90 Â± 12.40) year-old. The total key information awareness rate of TB was 45.66% (14 944/32 730). 65.70% (4301/6546) knowing the transmission route, 33.30% (2180/6546) knowing the symptom of TB, 39.21% (2567/6546) knowing where to go when suspected suffering TB, 38.28% (2506, 6546) knowing national free anti-TB drug supply and examination of infectious TB patients, 51.79% (3390/6546) knowing TB is curable in most case. As for the the key information awareness rate, among senior high school or above, primary high school, primary school or below were 57.19% (3257/5695), 52.07% (6 066/11 650), 36.54% (5 621/15 385), respectively; among birthplace in city, rural areas were 54.70 (1745/3190), 44.68% (13 199/29 540), respectively; Amone male, female were 47.11% (7 788/16 530), 44.17% (7 156/16 200); among different occupations, cadre or staff was highest (59.43%, 1 563/2 630), whereas students was lowest (40.33%, 492/1220); among different age groups, subjects aged beyond 50 years was lowest (39.75%, 5 189/13 055).

The issue of equity in health has become urgent, and China has attached increasing attention to it. With rapid economic development and great changes in medical insurance policy, the pattern of equity in health has changed tremendously. The reform of healthcare in Zhejiang Province is at the forefront in China, and studies on Zhejiang Province are of great significance to the entire country. This paper aimed to measure health equity from the perspectives of health needs and health-seeking behavior and to provide suggestions for the next policy formulations, with respect to timeliness. The investigator's household survey was conducted in August 2016. A sample of 1000 households, which included2807 individuals in Zhejiang, China, was obtained with the multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method. Descriptive analysis and chi-square tests were adopted in the analysis. The value of the concentration index was used to measure the equity. This study found that the poor have more urgent health needs and poorer health situations than the rich. Through studies on health-seeking behavior, the utilization of outpatient services was almost equitable, while the utilization of hospitalization showed a pro-rich inequity (i.e., the rich use more services). Individuals with employer-based medical insurance used more outpatient services than those with rural and urban medical insurance. More people in the poorer income groups did not use inpatient services due to financial difficulties. Absolute medical prices and medical insurance may explain the equity in the utilization of outpatient services and the inequity in the utilization of hospitalization. In view of the pro-rich inequity of hospitalization, more financial protection should be provided for the poor.\n\n[Study on the pathological and molecular characteristics of viral meningitis outbreaks in Linhai county, Zhejiang province, 2004].\n\nPubMed\n\nYan, Ju-ying; Lu, Yi-yu; Xu, Chang-ping; Gong, Li-ming; Chen, Yin; Zhang, Yan-jun; Zhu, Jian-sheng\n\n2011-12-01\n\nIn order to confirm the causes of viral meningitis outbreaks in Linhai county, Zhejiang province in 2004, and to analyze the relationship between hereditary variation and evolution of the pathogen. 60 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were collected from the suspected patients. Virus strains from the specimens were isolated with RD and Hep-2 cell lines, and identified through neutralization test. VP1 and VP4/VP2 genes of the isolated viruses were sequenced. Both phylogenetic and homological trees were also constructed. 19 Echovirus type 30 (E30) strains were isolated from 60 CSFs, in which E30 accounted for 31.7%. All of the complete VP1 genes in 4 sequenced virus isolates of E30 were composed of 876 nt, encoding 292 amino acids (aa). The identity of nucleotide and amino acid in VP1 gene were 82.4% - 84.1% and 93.5% - 94.2% between the 4 Linhai strains and the prototype strain Bastianni of E30, were 87.1% - 99.9% and 97.9% - 100.0% among the 4 virus strains of E30 from Linhai, respectively. The 4 Linhai strains could be classified into two classes. The diversity of nt and aa was minimal in the same class but obvious between the two classes, with the range of diversities as 12.9% and 2.1%, respectively. The Linhai E30 strains had maximum similarity with the Zhejiang E30 strains in 2002 - 2003. The 4 Linhai strains of E30 in the phylogenetic tree of the VP1 gene were attributed into two branches of the G and H genotype, respectively. The G branch also included the E30 strains from Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shangdong in 2003, while the H branch including E30 strains from Zhuji, Zhejiang in 2002. The phylogenetic tree of VP4/VP2 genes was similar to that of VP1 gene. The outbreak of viral meningitis in Linhai county in 2004 was caused by the two classes of E30 strains with G and H genotype existed simultaneously. The Linhai E30 strains had maximum genetic relations to the Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shangdong strains of E30. The H genotype was inferred to be a new variant\n\nImpact factors on expansion of built-up areas in Zhejiang Province, China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Dong; Zhu, Qiankun; Li, Yan; Gong, Fang\n\n2017-10-01\n\nBuilt-up areas are the results of human activities. Not only are they the real reflection of human and society activities, but also one of the most important input parameters for the simulation of biogeochemical cycle. Therefore, it is very necessary to map the distribution of built-up areas and monitor their changes by using new technologies and methods at high spatiotemporal resolution. By combining technologies of GIS (Geographic Information System) and RS (Remote Sensing), this study mainly explored the expansion and driving factors of built-up areas at the beginning of the 21st century in Zhejiang Province, China. Firstly, it introduced the mapping processes of LULC (Land Use and Land Cover) based on the method which combined object-oriented method and binary decision tree. Then, it analyzed the expansion features of built-up areas in Zhejiang from 2000 to 2005 and 2005 to 2010. In addition to these, potential driving factors on the expansion of built-up areas were also explored, which contained physical geographical factors, railways, highways, rivers, urban centers, elevation, and slop. Results revealed that the expansions of built-up areas in Zhejiang from 2000 to 2005 and from 2005 to 2010 were very obvious and they showed high levels of variation in spatial heterogeneity. Except those, increased built-up areas with distance to railways, highways, rivers, and urban centers could be fitted with power function (y = a*xb ), with minimum R2 of 0.9507 for urban centers from 2000 to 2005; the increased permillages of built-up areas to mean elevation and mean slop could be fitted with exponential functions (y = a*ebx), with minimum R2 of 0.6657 for mean slop from 2005 to 2010. Besides, government policy could also impact expansion of built-up areas. In a nutshell, a series of conclusions were obtained through this study about the spatial features and driving factors of evolution of built-up areas in Zhejiang from 2000 to 2010.\n\nComparative biogeography of the gut microbiome between Jinhua and Landrace pigs.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiao, Yingping; Kong, Fanli; Xiang, Yun; Zhou, Weidong; Wang, Junjun; Yang, Hua; Zhang, Guolong; Zhao, Jiangchao\n\n2018-04-13\n\nTheÂ intestinal microbiome is critically important in shaping a variety of host physiological responses. However, it remains elusive on how gut microbiota impacts overall growth and more specifically, adipogenesis. Using the pig as an animal model, we compared the differences in bacterial community structure throughout the intestinal tract in two breeds (Landrace and Jinhua) of pigs with distinct phenotypes. The Landrace is a commercial purebred and the Jinhua is a Chinese indigenous, slow-growing breed with high propensity for fat deposition. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we revealed that the bacterial communities are more diverse in the duodenum, jejunum, and cecum of Jinhua pigs than in those of Landrace pigs, whereas the ileal and colonic microbiota show a similar complexity between the two breeds. Furthermore, a number of bacterial taxa differentially exist in Jinhua and Landrace pigs throughout the entire intestinal tract, with the jejunal and ileal microbiome showing the greatest contrast. Functional prediction of the bacterial community suggested increased fatty acid biosynthesis in Jinghua pigs, which could partially explain their adiposity phenotype. Further studies are warranted to experimentally verify the relative contribution of each enriched bacterial species and their effect on adipogenesis and animal growth.\n\nRural sewage treatment processing in Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, W. H.; Kuan, T. H.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nIssues regarding water pollution in rural areas of China have garnered increased attention over the years. Further discussion on the circumstances and results of existing domestic sewage treatment methods may serve as an appropriate reference in solving these important issues. This article explored the current conditions of water contamination in rural areas of China, introduced the characteristics and effects of applicable sewage treatment technology, and summarized the results of the planning, installation, and operation of rural sewage treatment facilities in Yongjia County in Zhejiang Province. However, relying on a single technical design rule is not adequate for solving the practical problems that these villages face. Instead, methods of planning rural sewage treatment should be adapted to better suit local conditions and different residential forms. It is crucial, ultimately, for any domestic sewage treatment system in a rural area to be commissioned, engineered, and maintained by a market-oriented professional company.\n\nOccurrence of Veterinary Antibiotics in Swine Manure from Large-scale Feedlots in Zhejiang Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Hua; Chu, Yixuan; Fang, Chengran\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe occurrence and distribution of five sulfonamides and three tetracyclines in swine manure sampled from large-scale feedlots in different areas of Zhejiang Province, China were detected using solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography. All eight test antibiotics were detected in most of the manure samples. The dominant antibiotics in swine manure were sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, sulfadimidine, tetracycline, and chlortetracycline. The maximum concentration of residual antibiotic reached up to 57.95Â mg/kg (chlortetracycline). The concentrations and distribution of both types of antibiotics in swine manure of different areas varied greatly. Relatively higher concentrations of sulfonamides were found in swine manure from the Zhejiang area in this experiment compared with previous studies. The results revealed that antibiotics were extensively used in feedlots in this district and that animal manure might act as a non-specific source of antibiotic residues in farmlands and aquatic environments.\n\nIsolation and characterization of a novel arenavirus harbored by Rodents and Shrews in Zhejiang province, China\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLi, Kun; Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Hangzhou; Lin, Xian-Dan\n\n2015-02-15\n\nTo determine the biodiversity of arenaviruses in China, we captured and screened rodents and shrews in Wenzhou city, Zhejiang province, a locality where hemorrhagic fever diseases are endemic in humans. Accordingly, arenaviruses were detected in 42 of 351 rodents from eight species, and in 12 of 272 Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus), by RT-PCR targeting the L segment. From these, a single arenavirus was successfully isolated in cell culture. The virion particles exhibited a typical arenavirus morphology under transmission electron microscopy. Comparison of the S and L segment sequences revealed high levels of nucleotide (>32.2% and >39.6%) and amino acidmoreÂ Â» (>28.8% and >43.8%) sequence differences from known arenaviruses, suggesting that it represents a novel arenavirus, which we designated Wenzhou virus (WENV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all WENV strains harbored by both rodents and Asian house shrews formed a distinct lineage most closely related to Old World arenaviruses. - Highlights: â¢ A novel arenavirus (Wenzhou virus) was identified in Zhejiang province, China. â¢ The virus is highly circulating in five species of rats and one species of shrews â¢ More efforts are needed to infer whether it is pathogenic to humans or not.Â«Â less\n\nContribution of Histidine and Lysine to the Generation of Volatile Compounds in Jinhua Ham Exposed to Ripening Conditions Via Maillard Reaction.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Chao-Zhi; Zhao, Jing-Li; Tian, Wei; Liu, Yan-Xia; Li, Miao-Yun; Zhao, Gai-Ming\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the role of Maillard reactions in the generation of flavor compounds in Jinhua ham, the reactions of glucose and ethanal with histidine and lysine, respectively, were studied by simulating the ripening conditions of Jinhua ham. The volatile products produced were analyzed using solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The results showed that 8 volatile compounds were generated by the reaction of glucose and histidine and 10 volatile compounds were generated by the reaction of glucose and lysine. Reactions of ethanal with lysine and with histidine both generated 31 volatile compounds that contributed to the flavor of Jinhua ham. This indicates that histidine and lysine related to Maillard reactions possibly play important roles in the generation of the unique flavor compounds in Jinhua ham. This research demonstrates that free amino acids participate in the generation of volatile compounds from Jinhua ham via the Maillard reaction and provides a basic mechanism to explain flavor formation in Jinhua ham. Jinhua ham is a well-known traditional Chinese dry-cured meat product. However, the formation of the compounds comprising its special flavor is not well understood. Our results indicate that Maillard reactions occur in Jinhua ham under ripening conditions. This work illustrates the contribution of Maillard reactions to the flavor of Jinhua ham.

Zhejiang province is a relatively developed area in eastern China and was an area with high endemicity for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection via mother-to-child transmission. The hepatitis B vaccine vaccination rates for the birth dose and 3- dose schedule in Zhejiang Province since 1992 have both remained above 90% [1]. The results of two hepatitis B seroepidemiological surveys conducted in 2006 and 2014, respectively, to evaluate the rates of notification and seroprevalence of HBV infection among the population of Zhejiang Province, China, aged between 1 and 29years. Data on the notification rates of HBV infection in Zhejiang province from 2006 to 2014 were obtained from the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NNDRS). The prevalence rate of HBV serological markers and the rate of immunization coverage were compared between surveys. The reported notification rates in people aged between 1 and 29years according to the NNDRS decreased approximately 4.88 times from 2006 to 2014. The prevalence of HBsAg decreased from 2.16% in 2006 to 1.05% in 2014, while the prevalence of anti-HBc decreased from 7.13% to 5.49%. The anti-HBc seroprevalence in the 15-29-year-old age group was significantly higher than that in all the other age groups both in the 2006 and 2014 serosurveys. The rate of anti-HBs seroprevalence in those aged between 1 and 14years was maintained at a high level between 2006 and 2014. The rate of hepatitis B reported and the rate of HBsAg positivity decreased significantly in Zhejiang province by maintaining the high-level coverage rate of the hepatitis B timely birth dose and three-dose schedule. While additional efforts are needed to achieve the goal of elimination. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) was first identified on March 31, 2013 in China. Out of the total number of 134 cases confirmed from March to September 2013 in China, Zhejiang Province saw the greatest number (46 cases). This study employed a mobile Internet survey to assess KAP regarding H7N9 among mobile phone users in Zhejiang Province. This study intended to examine KAP by region and the association between sociodemographic variables and KAP. An anonymous questionnaire was designed by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A cross-sectional survey was executed through a mobile Internet application platform of China Unicom in 5 regions in Zhejiang Province. Stratified and clustered sampling methods were applied and mobile phone users were invited to participate in the study voluntarily. A total of 9582 eligible mobile phone users participated in the survey with a response rate of 1.92% (9582/5,000,000). A total of 9105 valid responses (95.02%) were included for statistical analysis. Generally, more than three-quarters of the participants had some basic knowledge of H7N9 and held the attitude recommended by the Zhejiang CDC toward eating cooked poultry (77.55%, 7061/9105) and visiting a hospital at the occurrence of symptoms (78.51%, 7148/9105). Approximately half of the participants worried about contracting H7N9, and took preventive practices recommended by the Zhejiang CDC. But only 14.29% (1301/9105) of participants kept eating cooked poultry as usual. Although worry about H7N9 infection did not differ by region, Hangzhou saw the largest proportion of participants with knowledge of H7N9, which was probably because Hangzhou had the greatest number of H7N9 cases. KAP varied by some sociodemographic variables. Female participants were more likely to know about symptoms of H\n\n[Study on content of ethyl carbamate in yellow rice wine and its change in Zhejiang province].\n\nPubMed\n\nShen, Xiang-hong; Wu, Ping-gu; Wang, Li-yuan; Zhang, Jing; Tan, Ying; Ying, Ying; Ma, Bing-jie\n\n2013-11-01\n\nTo understand the content status of ethyl carbamate (EC) in yellow rice wine and the changes in storage period and shelf life in Zhejiang province. A total of 475 samples of yellow rice wine purchased randomly from supermarkets and food stores in Zhejiang province during 2008-2012, and 49 samples collected from manufacturers were measured for EC content. The sample collected from manufacturers by filter sterilization was placed at 4 Â°C, room temperature and 37 Â°C for 400 d, respectively;a bottled wine and a wine in bag were bought from market were placed for 400 d in room temperature to conduct shelf life storage test, and measure the content in every point in 2011. The EC of the samples was determinated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after the samples were diluted with D5-EC isotope dilution technique, and purified by alkaline diatomite solid phase extraction column. The overall detection rate of EC was 99% (472/475) in yellow rice wine of Zhejiang province in 2008-2012, the median value was 70-112 Âµg/kg, the 90th percentile was 190-333 Âµg/kg, the 95th percentile was 214-393 Âµg/kg, and the maximum value was 430-515 Âµg/kg. The content of EC was increased gradually along with the increasing of storage age in commercially yellow rice wine, and the average content of EC were positively correlated with storage age(r = 0.988). The contents of EC in yellow rice wine after sterilization increased from 74 Âµg/kg to 86 Âµg/kg, 127 Âµg/kg and 509 Âµg/kg at 4 Â°C, room temperature and 37Â°C, respectively for 400 d storage, the differences had statistical significance (F = 14.73, P < 0.01). The content of EC in yellow rice wines in shelf life, which stored in room temperature with bottle and bag package, was decreased slightly with increasing storage time in the beginning, from 215 to 184 Âµg/kg and 196 to 158 Âµg/kg, respectively, and increased again with increasing storage time after 250 d, with 252 Âµg/kg and 210 Âµg/kg in bottle and bag package after 400 d\n\nDemand Analysis of Logistics Information Matching Platform: A Survey from Highway Freight Market in Zhejiang Province\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Daqiang; Shen, Xiahong; Tong, Bing; Zhu, Xiaoxiao; Feng, Tao\n\nWith the increasing competition in logistics industry and promotion of lower logistics costs requirements, the construction of logistics information matching platform for highway transportation plays an important role, and the accuracy of platform design is the key to successful operation or not.

This is a remarkable accomplishment given that Chinaâs rapid industrialization and urbanization has led to a vast reduction of arable land and agricultural labor to non-agricultural sectors. While there are many factors contributing to this happy outcome, one potential contributing factor that has received increasing attention is the emergence of agricultural production outsourcing, a new rural institution that has emerged in recent years. This study aims to contribute to the limited but growing literature on agricultural production outsourcing in China. Specifically, this study analyzes factors affecting farmersâ decisions to outsource any or some production tasks using data from rice farmers in Zhejiang province. Results from a logistic model show that farm size and government subsidy encourages farmers to outsource while ownership of agricultural machines and land fragmentation have negative effects on farmersâ decisions to outsource production tasks.

Evidence from a Seroepidemiology Survey in Zhejiang, an Eastern Province of China.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Hanqing; Yao, Pingping; Zhou, Yang; Deng, Xuan; Pan, Jinren\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe resurgence of pertussis has occurred in many countries. However, the epidemiological profiles of pertussis cannot be well understood by the current surveillance system in China. This study was designed to investigate the age specific serologic evidence of antibodies against pertussis, and to offer information regarding the existence of pertussis infection in Zhejiang Province, China. A cross-sectional serosurvey was carried out in 6 counties of Zhejiang Province during September and October of 2014. The immunoglobulin G-pertussis toxin (IgG-PT) levels were measured quantitatively with a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antibody activities were expressed in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-U/ml and a level â¥30 FDA-U/ml was considered seropositive. An IgG-PT >80 FDA-U/ml indicated recent pertussis infection if the patient had not received immunization with the pertussis vaccine within the last year. The mean IgG-PT seropositivity rate among the 2107 subjects was 33.32% with a geometric mean concentration of 17.73 (95% confidence interval: 16.90-18.60) FDA-U/ml. The difference in the seropositivity rates reached significant means among the different age groups (waldÏ2 = 198.41, P<0.0005), and children aged 3 years had the highest percentage (63.24%) of undetectable IgG-PT level. Of the 1707 subjects â¥3 years of age, 169 (9.90%) had evidence of a recent infection. The highest proportion of IgG-PT levels â¥80 FDA-U/ml was found in â¥60 years age group followed by 11-15 and 16-25 years age groups. This study indicates the rather lower IgG-PT level sustained 1 year after the acellular pertussis vaccine booster dose, and substantial proportion of population susceptibility to pertussis in Zhejiang Province, China. Moreover, pertussis infection is not uncommon; it was estimated that 10% of subjects were recently infected approximately within the last 100 days. We highly suggest that the surveillance capacity should be\n\n[Sero-epidemiologic investigation on tick-borne diseases of humans and domestic animals in Zhejiang province].\n\nPubMed\n\nChai, Cheng-liang; Lu, Qun-ying; Sun, Ji-min; Jiang, Li-ping; Ling, Feng; Zhang, Li-juan; Zheng, Shou-gui; Zhang, Hong; Ge, Jun-hua\n\n2010-10-01\n\nTo investigate the seroprevalence of tick-borne diseases in humans and domestic animals from rural areas of Zhejiang province. Anji county, Jindong district and Tiantai county were selected for samples collection according to their geographic locations and historical prevalence of tick-borne diseases. Blood samples of humans and domestic animals were collected in the three sites. An indirect immuno-fluorescent antibody test was used to determine the presence of IgG antibodies of Rickettsiae heilongjiangii, Orientia tsutsugamushi, R. typhi, Anaplasma phagocytosis, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Bartonella, R. hainan and Coxiella burnetii in these samples. Six hundred and eighty-three blood samples including 579 from humans and 104 from domestic animals (53 from cattles and 51 from sheep) were collected from the three sites. Antibody positive rates of Orientia tsutsugamushi, R. typhi, Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Coxiella burnetii were significantly different between these sites. IgG from all the 8 pathogens were detected in samples from humans. It was found that the sero-prevalence rates of R. typhi, Bartonella and C. burnetii (20.7%, 10.9%, 5.5%) of adults were higher than those of other Rickettsiae under investigation. The seroprevalence of R. typhi increased along with age. IgG from the 7 pathogens were detected in samples from domestic animals except for Anaplasma phagocytosis. The sero-prevalence rates of R. typhi, Bartonella and R. hainan (69.2%, 51.0%, 22.1%) of adults were higher than those of other Rickettsiae investigated. Tick-borne diseases did spread widely in humans and domestic animals from different rural areas of Zhejiang province. The sero-prevalence rates of R. typhi, B. henselae, R. hainan and C. burnetii were higher than that from other pathogens.\n\nA new species of Neoperla (Plecoptera: Perlidae) from Zhejiang Province of China.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Zhi-Teng\n\n2016-03-24\n\nThe stonefly genus Neoperla Needham (1905) is primarily distributed in eastern North America, Tropical and Temperate Asia and central Africa, with at least 297 species known (Illies 1966, Zwick 1973, Stark & Gaufin 1976, DeWalt et al. 2016).

The annual average PM2.5 concentration was 58.83 Âµg/m3 in 2015 in Zhejiang. Element contents in PM2.5 varied greatly with the season and locations. Al, Pb, and Mn were the most abundant elements among the studied metal(loid)s in PM2.5. The non-carcinogenic risks of the 12 elements through inhalation and dermal contact exposure were lower than the safe level for children and adults. However, there were potential non-carcinogenic risks of Tl, As, and Sb for children and Tl for adults through ingestion exposure. The carcinogenic risks from As, Be, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Ni through inhalation exposure were less than the acceptable level (1 Ã 10â4) for children and adults. Pb may carry a potential carcinogenic risk for both children and adults through ingestion. More attention should be paid to alleviate non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks posed by particle-bound toxic elements through ingestion exposure.

Remote sensing data and surface observational data are used to investigate the urbanization process and related environmental consequences, focusing on extreme heat events and air pollution, in Zhejiang Province (ZJP, East China). Examination of satellite-measured nighttime light data indicates rapid urbanization in ZJP during the past decade, initially forming three urban clusters. With rapid urban sprawl, a significant Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect has emerged. During extreme heat events in summer, the UHI effect significantly exacerbates nocturnal heat stress in highly urbanized areas. Taking a long-term view, urbanization also causes additional hot days and hot degree days in urban areas. Urbanization also imposes a heavy burden on local and regional air quality in ZJP. Degraded visibility and an increase in haze days are observed at most meteorological stations, especially in the three urban clusters. The results show that urbanization has led to serious environmental problems in ZJP, not only on the city scale, but also on the regional scale. Maintaining a balance between the continuing process of urbanization and environmental sustainability is a major issue facing the local government.\n\nA new quantitative model of ecological compensation based on ecosystem capital in Zhejiang Province, China*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJin, Yan; Huang, Jing-feng; Peng, Dai-liang\n\n2009-01-01\n\nEcological compensation is becoming one of key and multidiscipline issues in the field of resources and environmental management.

A total of 4 797 teenagers selected from 36 schools through stratified multi-stage cluster sampling in Zhejiang province and were surveyed by using a questionnaire with 3 886 eligible ones for analysis. Indicators as tried smoking, current smoking, and secondhand smoke exposure, etc., were calculated by weight on age proportions from the numbers of juniors in Zhejiang province. Prevalence rates of tried smoking and current smoking among teenagers were 10.91% and 2.07%, respectively. 7.72% of the juniors were susceptible to future tobacco use. The prevalence rates of tried smoking were 15.65% for boys and 5.58% for girls, 12.13% in rural and 9.24% in urban areas. Students from the 9(th) grade showed the highest rate (15.15%) while the 7(th) graders appeared the lowest level of susceptibility to future tobacco use (5.22%). The highest level of current smoking was seen in the group of \" weekly allowance more than 30 Yuan, from parents\"(4.07%). The prevalence of secondhand exposure to smoke in outdoor and indoor places, public transport, or at home were 57.60%, 54.45%, 46.97%, and 43.16%, respectively, among the teenagers. 3 071 juniors (77.33%) saw the smoking scenes in the past 30 days but only 1 367 juniors (28.30%) were aware of the basic knowledge on tobaccos in class, in the past 12 months. There were juniors who tried to smoke or were current smokers. The rate of secondhand exposure to smoking was high. A large number of the juniors were lack of education on knowledge related to tobacco control, in the classroom. It was important to promote and publicize the knowledge on tobacco so as to reduce the number of teenagers who were susceptible to future tobacco use.\n\nTen-year epidemiology of chemical burns in western Zhejiang Province, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nYe, Chunjiang; Wang, Xingang; Zhang, Yuanhai; Ni, Liangfang; Jiang, Ruiming; Liu, Liping; Han, Chunmao\n\n2016-05-01\n\nChemical burns occur frequently in western Zhejiang Province. This study documents the epidemiology of chemical burns in the region using burn data from a local specialized hospital. Results from this analysis will assist in the planning of prevention strategies for high-risk occupations and groups. A 10-year retrospective analysis was conducted for all patients with chemical burns admitted to the Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery from January 2004 to December 2013. Information obtained for each patient included demographics (gender, age, occupation and education), location of the burn, cause of the burn, and categories of chemicals. Data regarding the season of admittance, prehospital treatment, wound site/size (area, region, and depth), accompanying injuries, operations, length of hospital stay and mortality were also assessed. A total of 690 patients (619 males, 71 females; average age: 30.6Â±12.4 years) were admitted to the department for chemical burns. Over the 10-year period, the incidence of chemical burns showed an increasing tendency. Chemical burns occurred most frequently in patients aged 20-59 years (94.79%). Most of the chemical burns were work-related, primarily in private enterprises (47.97%) and state-owned enterprises (24.93%). Operations (68.99%) and machine problems (17.26%) were the main causes of chemical burns in the workplace. With regard to burns caused by chemicals, most were caused by acids (72.01%), with hydrofluoric acid and sulphuric acid causing 51.45%. Most chemical burns occurred in the summer and autumn seasons (61.02%). The burn size was <10% of the total body surface area (TBSA) for 445 patients (64.49%), while only 26 patients (3.76%) had burns covering >40% TBSA. The most common burn sites were the upper extremities (31.57%), lower extremities (19.86%), and head and neck (28.83%). Most patients (581 (84.20%)) received water washing treatment on site immediately after exposure. The most common accompanying injuries included\n\n[Comparative analysis on the complete genome sequence of mumps epidemic strain and mumps vaccine strain S79 isolated in Zhejiang province, China between year 2005 and 2010].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Dong-Yan; Feng, Yan; Zhong, Shu-Ling; Lu, Yi-Yu; Zhuang, Fang-Cheng; Xu, Chang-Ping\n\n2012-03-01\n\nTo compare the differences in the complete genome sequence between mumps epidemic strain and mumps vaccine strain S79 isolated in Zhejiang province. A total of 4 mumps epidemic strains, which were separated from Zhejiang province during 2005 to 2010, named as ZJ05-1, ZJ06-3, ZJ08-1 and ZJ10-1 were selected in the study. The complete genome sequences were amplified using RT-PCR. The genetic differences between vaccine strain S79 and other genotype strains were compared; while the genetic-distance was calculated and the evolution was analyzed. The biggest difference between the 4 epidemic strains and the vaccine strain S79 was found on the membrane associated protein gene; whose average nucleotide differential number was 42.5 +/- 3.0 and the average variant ratio was 13.6%; while the mean amino acid differential number was 12.8 +/- 1.5 and the average variant ratio was 22.4%. The smallest difference among the 4 epidemic strains and the vaccine strain was found in stromatin genes, whose average nucleotide differential number was 73.8 +/- 2.5 and the average variant ratio was 5.9%; while the mean amino acid differential number was 3.0 +/- 0.8 and the average variant ratio was 0.8%. The dn/ds value of the stromatin genes of the 4 epidemic strains reached the highest, as 0.6526; but without any positive pressure (dn/ds < 1, chi2 = 0.87, P > 0.05). There were mutations happened on the known antigen epitope, as 8th amino acid of membrane associated protein genes and on the 336th and 356th amino acid of hemagglutinin/neuraminidase proteins. Compared with the vaccine strain, the glycosylation sites of ZJ05-1, ZJ06-3, ZJ08-1 and ZJ10-1 increased 1, 1, 2 and 2 respectively. The complete amino acid sequence of all strains showed that there were 17 characteristic sites found on the genotype-F mumps strain. Within the complete genome, the genetic-distance between epidemic strains and vaccine strains in Zhejiang province (0.071) was significantly larger than the genetic\n\nEnvironmental Consequences of Rapid Urbanization in Zhejiang Province, East China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYang, Xuchao; Yue, Wenze; Xu, Honghui; Wu, Jingsheng; He, Yue\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSince reforms carried out in the late 1970s, China has experienced unprecedented rates of urban growth. Remote sensing data and surface observational data are used to investigate the urbanization process and related environmental consequences, focusing on extreme heat events and air pollution, in Zhejiang Province (ZJP, East China). Examination of satellite-measured nighttime light data indicates rapid urbanization in ZJP during the past decade, initially forming three urban clusters. With rapid urban sprawl, a significant Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect has emerged. During extreme heat events in summer, the UHI effect significantly exacerbates nocturnal heat stress in highly urbanized areas. Taking a long-term view, urbanization also causes additional hot days and hot degree days in urban areas. Urbanization also imposes a heavy burden on local and regional air quality in ZJP. Degraded visibility and an increase in haze days are observed at most meteorological stations, especially in the three urban clusters. The results show that urbanization has led to serious environmental problems in ZJP, not only on the city scale, but also on the regional scale. Maintaining a balance between the continuing process of urbanization and environmental sustainability is a major issue facing the local government.
