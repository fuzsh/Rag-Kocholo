The work covers the best of the final semester design projects of students in the Master of Architecture, the Master of Landscape Architecture and the Master of Planning (Urban Design). These are capstone projects where students are asked to respond to an issue by imagining and developing an architectural or landscape intervention that might provide a highly innovative resolution."
