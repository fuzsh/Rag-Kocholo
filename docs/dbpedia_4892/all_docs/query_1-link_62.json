In Vietnam, only 14 surnames account for over 90% of the population.\n\nAre Vietnamese Last Names First?\n\nVietnamese last names are arranged with the surname first, followed by the middle name (if any), and the given name last. This is referred to as the ‚Äúeastern name order.‚Äù Vietnamese family names are passed down from parents and used by all siblings the same way they are in other countries.\n\nWhy Do Vietnamese Have Chinese Last Names?\n\nVietnamese surnames first appeared in 111 BCE, when the Chinese Han Dynasty began their occupation of Vietnam for one thousand years, until around 939 CE. This greatly affected the number of Vietnamese last names with Chinese origins. The naming order that includes using the surname first also came from this thousand-year Chinese occupation.\n\nFeedback: Was This Article Helpful?\n\nThank You For Your Feedback!\n\nThank You For Your Feedback!\n\nWhat Did You Like?\n\nWhat Went Wrong?\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMaryana Vestic\n\nMaryana Vestic is a Brooklyn-based writer, editor, and food photographer with a background in entertainment Business Affairs.
