        "text": "Human rabies in Tianjin, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nMontgomery, J P; Zhang, Y; Wells, E V; Liu, Y; Clayton, J L; Wang, X; Boulton, M L\n\n2012-12-01\n\nHuman rabies has recently re-emerged as a significant public health threat in Tianjin, China. Using surveillance data compiled by the Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we describe 60 cases of human rabies reported from 2005 to 2011 in the municipality of Tianjin, China. All 60 cases of human rabies resulted in death. Cases were primarily male (80%), middle aged (mean 40.6 years), and exposed to rabies in a rural setting (82%). Most exposures were associated with dog bites (93%) and no animal had a history of rabies vaccination; no cases were laboratory confirmed. Fifteen percent of patients sought medical attention for their wound, and none received a complete regimen of WHO-recommended post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). These findings suggest the need for China's public health authority to improve animal rabies surveillance and control strategies through laboratory case confirmation, more rapid response to potential exposures with provision of appropriate PEP, and education to the public and to health care providers on identifying and reducing rabies risk.\n\nNovel triple-reassortant H1N1 swine influenza viruses in pigs in Tianjin, Northern China.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Ying-Feng; Wang, Xiu-Hui; Li, Xiu-Li; Zhang, Li; Li, Hai-Hua; Lu, Chao; Yang, Chun-Lei; Feng, Jing; Han, Wei; Ren, Wei-Ke; Tian, Xiang-Xue; Tong, Guang-Zhi; Wen, Feng; Li, Ze-Jun; Gong, Xiao-Qian; Liu, Xiao-Min; Ruan, Bao-Yang; Yan, Ming-Hua; Yu, Hai\n\n2016-02-01\n\nPigs are susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses and therefore have been proposed to be mixing vessels for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses through reassortment. In this study, for the first time, we report the isolation and genetic analyses of three novel triple-reassortant H1N1 swine influenza viruses from pigs in Tianjin, Northern China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these novel viruses contained genes from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (PB2, PB1, PA and NP), Eurasian swine (HA, NA and M) and triple-reassortant swine (NS) lineages. This indicated that the reassortment among the 2009 pandemic H1N1, Eurasian swine and triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses had taken place in pigs in Tianjin and resulted in the generation of new viruses. Furthermore, three human-like H1N1, two classical swine H1N1 and two Eurasian swine H1N1 viruses were also isolated during the swine influenza virus surveillance from 2009 to 2013, which indicated that multiple genetic lineages of swine H1N1 viruses were co-circulating in the swine population in Tianjin, China. The emergence of novel triple-reassortant H1N1 swine influenza viruses may be a potential threat to human health and emphasizes the importance of further continuous surveillance.

Currently, HIV contains multiple subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs). Here, from an HIV-positive mother and her child in Tianjin, China, we identified a novel HIV-1 second-generation recombinant virus (TJ20170316 and TJ20170317) between CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC. Near full-length genomes were obtained from both samples, and they shared very close sequences, except some point mutations. Phylogenetic analyses of the near full-length genomes showed that they consist of CRF01_AE backbone and part CRF07_BC sequences. Recombinant Identification Program (RIP) and Simplot software identified four breakpoints in gag, pol, vif, tat genes in TJ20170316, totally different from other reported CRFs and URFs. The emergence of such URF in Tianjin, China, highlights the complexity of HIV-1 epidemic and more measures should be taken to prevent HIV transmissions.\n\nA Population Profile of Measles Susceptibility in Tianjin, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBoulton, Matthew L.; Wang, Xiexiu; Zhang, Ying; Montgomery, JoLynn P.; Wagner, Abram L.; Carlson, Bradley F.; Ding, Yaxing; Li, Xiaoyan; Gillespie, Brenda; Su, Xu\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Measles is a highly infectious illness requiring herd immunity of 95% to interrupt transmission. Measles is targeted for elimination in China, which has not reached elimination goals despite high vaccination coverage. We developed a population profile of measles immunity among residents aged 0 through 49 years in Tianjin, China. Methods Participants were either from community population registers or community immunization records. Measles IgG antibody status was assessed using dried blood spots. We examined the association between measles IgG antibody status and independent variables including urbanicity, sex, vaccination, measles history, and age. Results 2,818 people were enrolled. The proportion measles IgG negative increased from 50.7% for infants aged 1 month to 98.3% for those aged 7 months. After 8 months, the age of vaccination eligibility, the proportion of infants and children measles IgG negative decreased. Overall, 7.8% of participants 9 months of age or older lacked measles immunity including over 10% of those 20â39 years. Age and vaccination status were significantly associated with measles IgG status in the multivariable model. The odds of positive IgG status were 0.337 times as high for unvaccinated compared to vaccinated (95% CI: 0.217, 0.524). Conclusions The proportion of persons in Tianjin, China immune to measles was lower than herd immunity threshold with less than 90% of people aged 20â39 years demonstrating protection. Immunization programs in Tianjin have been successful in vaccinating younger age groups although high immunization coverage in infants and children alone wonât provide protective herd immunity, given the large proportion of non-immune adults.

Total data of mortality surveillance were collected by Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meteorological data and atmospheric pollution data were from Tianjin Meteorological Bureau and Tianjin Environmental Monitoring Center, respectively. Generalized additive Poisson regression model was used in time-series analysis on the relationship between air pollution and stroke mortality in Tianjin. Single-pollutant analysis and multi-pollutant analysis were performed after adjustment for confounding factors such as meteorological factors, long-term trend of death, \"days of the week\" effect and population. The crude death rates of stroke in Tianjin were from 136.67 in 2001 to 160.01/100000 in 2009, with an escalating trend (P = 0.000), while the standardized mortality ratios of stroke in Tianjin were from 138.36 to 99.14/100000, with a declining trend (P = 0.000). An increase of 10 Âµg/mÂ³ in daily average concentrations of atmospheric SOâ, NOâ and PMââ led to 1.0105 (95%CI: 1.0060 â¼ 1.0153), 1.0197 (95%CI: 1.0149 â¼ 1.0246) and 1.0064 (95%CI: 1.0052 â¼ 1.0077), respectively, in relative risks of stroke mortality. SOâ effect peaked after 1-day exposure, while NOâ and PMââ effects did within 1 day. Air pollution in Tianjin may increase the risk of stroke mortality in the population and induce acute onset of stroke. It is necessary to carry out air pollution control and allocate health resources rationally to reduce the hazard of stroke mortality.\n\nMarriage and Fertility in Tianjin, China: Fifty Years of Transition.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPasternak, Burton\n\nA report of research conducted in Tianjin, People's Republic of China (September 1981-January 1982) describes and analyses changes in family structure, marriage, post-marital residence, and fertility in a neighborhood of factory workers over a 50-year period.

It was found that in 2014, ship emissions are 2.93 Ã 104, 4.13 Ã 104, 4.03 Ã 103, 3.72 Ã 103, 1.72 Ã 103 and 3.57 Ã 103 tonnes of SO2, NOx, PM10, PM2.5, NMVOC and CO respectively, which are equivalent to 11.07%, 9.40%, 2.43%, 3.10%, 0.43% and 0.16% respectively of the non-ship anthropogenic totals in Tianjin. The total CO2 emissions is approximately 1.97 Ã 106 tonnes. The container ships and dry bulk cargo ships contributed about 70% of the total ship emissions of NOx, SO2 and PM10. Pollutants were mainly emitted during cruise and hotelling modes, and the highest intensities of emissions located in the vicinity of fairways, berth and anchorage areas in Tianjin Port. Distinctive difference between the lowest (February) and the highest (September) monthly emissions is due to the adjustment of freight volume during the Chinese New Year and the months before and after it.\n\nThe impact of Supplementary Immunization Activities on the epidemiology of measles in Tianjin, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWagner, Abram L.; Zhang, Ying; Mukherjee, Bhramar; Ding, Yaxing; Wells, Eden V.; Boulton, Matthew L.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSummary Objectives China has repeatedly used supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) to work towards measles elimination, but it is unknown if the SIAs are reaching non-locals, migrants from rural to urban areas. This study characterizes temporal trends in measles incidence by local and non-local residency and evaluates the impact of SIAs on measles incidence in Tianjin, China. Methods Daily measles case counts were tabulated separately by residency. These two datasets were combined so that each day had two observations. We conducted Poisson regression using generalized estimating equations with an exchangeable working correlation structure to estimate rate ratios (RRs). Results There were 12,465 measles cases in Tianjin over the 10-year period. The rate of measles was higher in non-locals than locals before the 2008 SIA (RR: 3.60, 95% CI: 3.27, 3.96), but this attenuates to a RR of 1.22 between the 2008 and 2010 SIAs (95% CI: 1.02, 1.45). Following the 2010 SIA, non-locals had a lower rate of measles (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.87). Conclusions The disparity in measles incidence between locals and non-locals was reduced following two SIAs. Sustained public health interventions will be needed to maintain low measles incidence among non-locals given ongoing migration of people throughout China.

Hepatitis A immunization program has been taken into effect since 2001 in Tianjin, China. This study evaluated the effectiveness of strategies in the prevention and control of hepatitis A. Data of serological survey, annual hepatitis A incidence, immunization coverage and the positive rate of hepatitis A IgG before and after the immunization program in residents under 15 years old were used to do the analysis. The results indicated that hepatitis A vaccine induced a striking decrease of hepatitis A incidence and a significant increase in the positive rate of anti-HAV IgG among the children younger than 15 years old. Hepatitis A vaccination in children was proved to be effective in the prevention and control of hepatitis A in Tianjin, China.

Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and demographic and occupational factors associated with three types of gynecologic pain among female factory workers in Tianjin. Methods: The study included 651 female workers from three factories in Tianjin, China. Logistic regression models were estimated to determine associations between occupational stress and gynecologic pain. Results: Occupational stress including high job strain, exhaustion, and stress related to working conditions was a risk factor for gynecologic pain. High job strain and poor job security were associated with an increased risk for dysmenorrhea. Compulsory overtime and exhaustion were associated with increased non-cyclic pelvic pain. Working overtime and exhaustion were associated with increased dyspareunia. Conclusions: As Chinaâs population of female factory workers grows, research on the reproductive health of this population is essential.

This study examines risk factors for measles acquisition among adults 20 to 49 years of age in Tianjin, China, and compares findings using measles IgG antibody-negative controls to all controls, both IgG-negative and IgG-positive. Measles cases were sampled from a disease registry, and controls were enrolled from community registries in Tianjin, China, 2011-2015. Through a best subsets selection procedure, we compared which variables were selected at different model sizes when using IgG-negative controls or all controls. We entered risk factors for measles in two separate logistic regression models: one with measles IgG-negative controls and the other with all controls. The study included 384 measles cases and 1,596 community controls (194 IgG-negative). Visiting a hospital was an important risk factor. For specialty hospitals, the odds ratio (OR) was 4.53 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28, 16.03) using IgG-negative controls, and OR = 5.27 (95% CI: 2.73, 10.18) using all controls. Variables, such as age or length of time in Tianjin, were differentially selected depending on the control group. Individuals living in Tianjin â¤3 years had 2.87 (95% CI: 1.46, 5.66) times greater odds of measles case status compared to all controls, but this relationship was not apparent for IgG-negative controls. We recommend that case-control studies examining risk factors for infectious diseases, particularly in the context of transmission dynamics, consider antibody-negative controls as the gold standard.\n\nMeasles Antibodies in Mother-Infant Dyads in Tianjin, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoulton, Matthew L; Wang, Xiexiu; Wagner, Abram L; Zhang, Ying; Carlson, Bradley F; Gillespie, Brenda W; Ding, Yaxing\n\n2017-11-27\n\nMany measles cases in Tianjin, China, occur in infants whose mothers were born after widespread vaccination programs. We assessed age-specific decreases in maternal measles antibodies in infants and examined maternal and infant characteristics in relation to infant antibody titers. Infant and mother dyads were enrolled from a sample of immunization clinics in all Tianjin districts. Participants' antibody titers were measured from dried blood spots. A multivariable log-linear model regressed infant antibody titers onto infant and mother characteristics. Among 551 infants aged â¤8 months, protective levels of measles antibodies were observed in infants whose mothers had measles titers â¥800 IU/mL (mean antibody titer, 542.5 IU/mL) or 400 to <800 IU/mL (mean, 202.2 IU/mL). Compared with infants whose mothers had no history of disease or vaccination, those with a history of disease had 1.60 times higher titers (95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.43). Limited vaccination programs in the 1980s have resulted in many Chinese women with inadequate protection against measles and an accordingly low efficiency of transplacental transmission to a fetus. Current vaccination programs, which target children aged 8 months through adolescence may be ineffective in controlling transmission of measles to infants. Â© The Author 2017.

The aims of this study were to quantify health care resource utilization and to estimate the direct medical costs for patients with schizophrenia in Tianjin, People's Republic of China. Data were obtained from the Tianjin Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) database. Adult patients with â¥1 diagnosis of schizophrenia and 12-month continuous enrollment after the first schizophrenia diagnosis between 2008 and 2009 were included. Both schizophrenia-related, psychiatric-related, and all-cause related resource utilization and direct medical costs were estimated. A total of 2,125 patients were included with a mean age of 52.3 years, and 50.7% of the patients were female. The annual mean all-cause costs were $2,863 per patient with psychiatric-related and schizophrenia-related costs accounting for 84.1% and 62.0% respectively. The schizophrenia-related costs for hospitalized patients were eleven times greater than that of patients who were not hospitalized. For schizophrenia-related health services, 60.8% of patients experienced at least one hospitalization with a mean (median) length of stay of 112.1 (71) days and a mean cost of $1,904 per admission; 59.0% of patients experienced at least one outpatient visit with a mean (median) number of visits of 6.2 (4) and a mean cost of $42 per visit during the 12-month follow-up period. Non-medication treatment costs were the most important element (45.7%) of schizophrenia-related costs, followed by laboratory and diagnostic costs (19.9%), medication costs (15.4%), and bed fees (13.3%). The costs related to the treatment of patients with schizophrenia were considerable in Tianjin, People's Republic of China, driven mainly by schizophrenia-related hospitalizations. Efforts focusing on community-based treatment programs and appropriate choice of drug treatment have the potential to reduce the use of inpatient services and\n\nA Survey of Current and Future Perceived Multi-National Corporation Manufacturing Training Needs in Tianjin, (T.E.D.A.) China.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHickey, Will\n\n2001-01-01\n\nDescribes a study that surveyed current and perceived future employer-provided training practices among multinational corporations manufacturing companies in the Tianjin Economic Development Area (T.E.D.A.) of China. Highlights include labor market; human resources management in China; workforce productivity; and return on investment. (Author/LRW)\n\nMeasuring and Benchmarking Technical Efficiency of Public Hospitals in Tianjin, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Hao; Dong, Siping\n\n2015-01-01\n\nChina has long been stuck in applying traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models to measure technical efficiency of public hospitals without bias correction of efficiency scores. In this article, we have introduced the Bootstrap-DEA approach from the international literature to analyze the technical efficiency of public hospitals in Tianjin (China) and tried to improve the application of this method for benchmarking and inter-organizational learning. It is found that the bias corrected efficiency scores of Bootstrap-DEA differ significantly from those of the traditional Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (BCC) model, which means that Chinese researchers need to update their DEA models for more scientific calculation of hospital efficiency scores. Our research has helped shorten the gap between China and the international world in relative efficiency measurement and improvement of hospitals. It is suggested that Bootstrap-DEA be widely applied into afterward research to measure relative efficiency and productivity of Chinese hospitals so as to better serve for efficiency improvement and related decision making.

Mobile observations were carried out along the city border road of Tianjin to obtain the vertical distribution characteristics of PM2.5. Hygroscopic growth was not considered since relative humidity was less than 60% during the observation experiments. PM2.5 profile was obtained with the linear regression equation between the particle extinction coefficient and PM2.5 mass concentration. In spring, the vertical distribution of PM2.5 exhibited a hierarchical structure. In addition to a layer of particles that gathered near the ground, a portion of particles floated at 0.6-2.5-km height. In summer and winter, the fine particles basically gathered below 1 km near the ground. In spring and summer, the concentration of fine particles in the south was higher than that in the north because of the influence of south wind. In winter, the distribution of fine particles was opposite to that measured during spring and summer. High concentrations of PM2.5 were observed in the rural areas of North Tianjin with a maximum of 350 Î¼g m-3 on 13 December 2016. It is shown that industrial and ship emissions in spring and summer and coal combustion in winter were the major sources of fine particles that polluted Tianjin. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of haze formation and the effects of meteorological conditions during haze-fog pollution episodes in the Tianjin area.\n\nLand subsidence in Tianjin for 2015 to 2016 revealed by the analysis of Sentinel-1A with SBAS-InSAR\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuo, Jiming; Hu, Jiyuan; Li, Bing; Zhou, Lv; Wang, Wei\n\n2017-04-01\n\nIt has been suggested that Tianjin, China, has significant land subsidence due to excessive extraction of water. Although it is presently under control, the land subsidence around Tianjin suburbs in recent years should not be ignored. However, existing research work on land subsidence is based on traditional synthetic aperture radar satellite images in which the research time spans are mainly before 2012. An advanced time-series method, namely small baselines subset (SBAS) technique, is applied to a total of 27 Sentinel-1A images over Tianjin acquired between May 31, 2015, and May 13, 2016, to derive the subsidence magnitude and distribution of Tianjin. Furthermore, the overall and quantitative validations of SBAS-derived results are implemented. First, the overall subsidence distribution derived by SBAS is compared with the annual report of land subsidence in Tianjin 2015, which shows the same subsidence trend and distribution. Then, 44 benchmarks and 2 continuously operating reference station datasets, i.e., CH01 and XQYY, are processed to provide a specific validation of SBAS-derived results of Sentinel-1A. Finally, through investigation, an interpretation from two aspects of groundwater extraction and geological structures of the surrounding Wangqingtuo settlement funnel area is given.\n\n[The modern TCM education of Tianjin].\n\nPubMed\n\nXie, J\n\n2016-11-28\n\nSchool education had gradually become the mainstream of medical education at the turn of the Qing Dynasty and Republican period. In Tianjin, there were western medical education, including the Peiyang Medical College, Army Medical College, and Lu's Medical School, whereas, there was no traditional medical school at all. To check this defect, two private TCM medical schools, the Learning School of TCM, and the Tianjin TCM Institution were set up by Chen Zedong and Gu Jinren respectively through persistent endeavor. Meanwhile, correspondence school of TCM were established by Zhang Xichun, Wei Jiaqian, and Ma Leshan. Though more TCM schools were planned, including Tianjin Private School of TCM by Lu Zongren and Qian Boquan, North China Professional TCM School by Zhang Yinqi and other colleagues, TCM Professional School by Zhang Dianju and the Tianjin Private Acu-Moxibustion School by Zhang Lihui, etc. All these did make their contributions to the training of TCM talents in modern times.\n\nCharacteristics and formation of heavy winter haze pollution during 2014-2015 in Tianjin, China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSun, Zhenli; Ma, Tao; Zhu, Lidan; Duan, Fengkui; He, Kebin\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWith the rapid increase in the amount of vehicles and energy consumption during the past two decades, China faces a serious air pollution in urban areas, which has produced negative impact on the society development and human health. Tianjin, locating on the southeast of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in north China, has been one of the heavy polluted cities during 2013-2016 of which the haze occurred frequently in particular in winter while the knowledge on its sources and formation mechanism are limited. For better understanding of the characteristics and the formation mechanisms of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter â¤2.5 Î¼m), especially secondary water-soluble inorganic species in these haze events, continuous and online hourly field observations in Tianjin urban area were carried out during 2014-2015 winter, that were, hourly concentrations of PM2.5, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (SNA) as well as the concentrations of gaseous pollutants and meteorological parameters. PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 5.6 Î¼gá¹¡m-3 to 495.5 Î¼gá¹¡m-3, with an average of 112.1 (Â±96.1) Î¼gá¹¡m-3. In general, SNA (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium) was the most abundant secondary water-soluble inorganic species and contributed to 35% of PM2.5 mass concentration. The most severe PM2.5 pollution was observed in January 2015 with four haze episodes observed. The chemical composition of four episodes was characterized by high level of SO42- (22%Ë38%), together with high concentration of NO3- (22%Ë34%), suggesting the contribution of secondary conversion. NOR and SOR increased with elevated PM2.5levels and heterogeneous processes seemed to be the most plausible explanation of this increase. Nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) was much higher than sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR), indicating the NO2 was easily oxidized in low temperature condition than that of SO2. Relative humidity (RH) played a considerable role in the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols, accelerated\n\nLeading causes of death from injury and poisoning by age, sex and urban/rural areas in Tianjin, China 1999-2006.\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Guohong; Choi, Bernard C K; Wang, Dezheng; Zhang, Hui; Zheng, Wenlong; Wu, Tongyu; Chang, Gai\n\n2011-05-01\n\nInjury and poisoning are a growing public health concern in China due to rapid economic growth, which has resulted in many cases with an injury-prone environment, such as overcrowded traffic, booming construction, and work-related stress. This study investigates the distribution and trends of deaths from injury and poisoning in Tianjin, China, by age, sex and urban/rural status, from 1999 to 2006. The study used data from the all-cause mortality surveillance system maintained by the Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Each death certificate recorded 53 variables. Cause of death was coded using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Standardized mortality rates and proportions of deaths were analyzed. Traffic accidents, suicide, poisoning, drowning and fall were the leading causes of fatal injuries in Tianjin from 1999 to 2006. Injury mortality rates were high in males, in rural areas, and in the older age groups. Despite low injury mortality rates, injury accounted for close to 50% of all deaths amongst the 5-29 year age group. Traffic accident mortality rates increased, although not significantly so, during the period from 1999 to 2006. Injury prevention and control is a high public health priority in Tianjin.

This study aims to estimate the proportion of children aged 8 months to 6 years vaccinated on time with measles-containing vaccines (MCV) and vaccinated during the 2008 and 2010 measles supplementary immunization activities. This study also characterizes differences in mean age at vaccination and vaccination timeliness by demographic characteristics, and describes maternal knowledge of measles vaccination. Immunization records were selected from a convenience sample of immunization clinics in Tianjin, China. From the records, overall vaccination coverage and timely vaccination coverage were calculated for different demographic groups. Mothers were also interviewed at these clinics to ascertain their knowledge of measles vaccination. Within the 329 immunization clinic records, child's birth year and district of residence were found to be significant predictors of different measures of vaccine timeliness. Children born in 2009 had a lower age at MCV dose 2 administration (17.96 months) than children born in 2005 (22.00 months). Children living in Hebei, a district in the urban center of Tianjin were less likely to be vaccinated late than children living in districts further from the urban core of Tianjin. From the 31 interviews with mothers, most women believed that timely vaccination was very important and more than one dose was very necessary; most did not know whether their child needed another dose. When reviewing MCV coverage in China, most studies do not consider timeliness. However, this study shows that overall vaccination coverage can greatly overestimate vaccination coverage within certain segments of the population, such as young infants.\n\nPet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children in Tianjin area, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLuo, Shugang; Sun, Yuexia; Hou, Jing; Kong, Xiangrui; Wang, Pan; Zhang, Qingnan; Sundell, Jan\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis study aims to find out the relationship between pet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children aged 0-8 years old in Tianjin, China. Parental or guardians reports of 7360 children were analyzed. 1490 (21.6%) families kept pets at the time of the survey (current), among them 4.0% cats, and 14.7% dogs. For the first year of life of children (early), 1196 (18.4%) families kept pets, and among them 3.2% cats, and 13.7% dogs. Exposure to a pet in early childhood significantly increased the risk of current wheeze, current dry cough, and diagnosed rhinitis. 17.9% of parents reported an avoidance behavior, i.e., had removed or refrained a pet due to asthma or allergy in the family. After adjustment for avoidance behavior, the negative effect of pet keeping on children's health became even more obvious, with e.g. an AOR of 3.37 (1.58-7.19) for diagnosed asthma, 3.60 (2.07-6.27) for diagnosed rhinitis, 1.92 (1.31-2.81) for diagnosed eczema. A dose-response relationship between pet keeping at current and current wheeze, current eczema and diagnosed eczema was found. In conclusion, pet exposure in early life of children in Tianjin is a risk factor for asthma and allergies among children aged 0-8 years old.\n\nTwo genotypes of H1N2 swine influenza viruses appeared among pigs in China.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Chuantian; Zhu, Qiyun; Yang, Huanliang; Zhang, Xiumei; Qiao, Chuanling; Chen, Yan; Xin, Xiaoguang; Chen, Hualan\n\n2009-10-01\n\nH1N2 is one of the main subtypes of influenza, which circulates in swine all over the world. To investigate the prevalence and genetic of H1N2 in swine of China. Two H1N2 swine influenza viruses were isolated from Tianjin and Guangdong province of China in 2004 and 2006, respectively. The molecular evolution of eight gene segments was analyzed. A/Swine/Tianjin/1/2004 has low identity with A/Swine/Guangdong/2006; in the phylogenetic tree of PA gene, A/Swine/Guangdong/1/2006 and A/Swine/Guangxi/1/2006 along with the H1N2 swine isolates of North America formed a cluster; and A/Swine/Tianjin/2004 and A/Swine/Zhejiang/2004, along with the classical H1N1 swine isolates formed another cluster; except that NA gene of A/Swine/Tianjin/1/2004 fell into the cluster of the H3N2 human influenza virus, indicating the reassortment between H3N2 human and H1N1 swine influenza viruses. Two different genotypes of H1N2 appeared among pigs in China. A/swine/Guangdong/1/06 was probably from H1N2 swine influenza viruses of North America; while A/swine/Tianjin/1/04 maybe come from reassortments of classical H1N1 swine and H3N2 human viruses prevalent in North America.\n\nHealth risks of heavy metals to the general public in Tianjin, China via consumption of vegetables and fish.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Xilong; Sato, T; Xing, Baoshan; Tao, S\n\n2005-11-01\n\nConsumption of vegetables and fish contaminated with the heavy metals Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Hg, and Cr is the most likely route for human exposure in Tianjin, China. Health risks associated with these heavy metals were assessed based on the target hazard quotients (THQs), which can be derived from concentrations of heavy metals in vegetables and fish consumed in four districts (Dong Li, Xi Qing, Jin Nan, and Bei Chen) and the urban area of Tianjin, China. Individual metal THQ (<1) values indicate the relative absence of health risks associated with intake of a single heavy metal through consumption of either contaminated vegetables or fish only. However, consumption of both vegetables and fish would lead to potential health risks especially for children, since individual THQs for vegetables and fish would sum up to almost 1. If individual THQs resulting from crops consumption are considered, the health risks would be greater for children since the THQ values will always be >1. Risk contribution from Cr is minimal compared to the other elements. Hg is the major risk contributor for children in Bei Chen since the THQ contribution amounts to about 45% of the total THQ values due to vegetables and fish consumption. The health risk to adults in Ding Li is ascribed mainly to the intake of Cd by vegetables and fish consumption, which contributes a substantial fraction to the total THQ (about 51%).\n\nSeismic Hazard and Risk Assessments for Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan, China, Area\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nXie, F.; Wang, Z.; Liu, J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSeismic hazard and risk in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan, China, area were estimated from 500-year intensity observations. First, we digitized the intensity observations (maps) using ArcGIS with a cell size of 0.1 ?? 0.1??. Second, we performed a statistical analysis on the digitized intensity data, determined an average b value (0.39), and derived the intensity-frequency relationship (hazard curve) for each cell. Finally, based on a Poisson model for earthquake occurrence, we calculated seismic risk in terms of a probability of I ??? 7, 8, or 9 in 50 years. We also calculated the corresponding 10 percent probability of exceedance of these intensities in 50 years. The advantages of assessing seismic hazard and risk from intensity records are that (1) fewer assumptions (i. e., earthquake source and ground motion attenuation) are made, and (2) site-effect is included. Our study shows that the area has high seismic hazard and risk. Our study also suggests that current design peak ground acceleration or intensity for the area may not be adequate. ?? 2010 Birkh??user / Springer Basel AG.\n\nSources and pathways of nutrients in the semi-arid region of Beijing-Tianjin, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nPernet-Coudrier, BenoÃ®t; Qi, Weixiao; Liu, Huijuan; MÃ¼ller, Beat; Berg, Michael\n\n2012-05-15\n\nSemiarid regions worldwide are particularly prone to eutrophication, which causes immense ecological and economic problems. One region that is in transition and requires systematic research for effective intervention is the dry landscape of Beijing-Tianjin (P. R. China). We investigated the sources and spatiotemporal loads of nitrogen and phosphorus species over a one-year period in the Haihe catchment that drains the megacity of Beijing. Although wastewater treatment was improved in recent years, the rivers were heavily contaminated by 0.3-5.3 mg P L(-1) and 3.0-49 mg N L(-1), with toxic levels of nitrite (â¥1 mg NO(2)-N L(-1)) and ammonia (â¥0.6 mg NH(3)-N L(-1)). The average NH(4)(+) (16.9 mg N L(-1)) increased by 160% compared to 1996-levels. Mass fluxes and Î´(15)N-signatures revealed that nutrients originated almost exclusively from sewage. Furthermore, the water balance demonstrated that >90% of the polluted river water was diverted for irrigation, thereby threatening food safety and groundwater quality. Per capita loads of 1.42 kg N/yr and 115 g P/yr were comparable to the peak discharges typical of Europe and the United States in 1970-1990, but concentrations were 2-3 times higher in the Beijing-Tianjin region. Our research identified sewage as the predominant nutrient source in this semiarid region, which suggests that state-of-the-art wastewater treatment would drastically mitigate eutrophication and even more rapidly than was previously observed in Europe.\n\nSources and Pathways of Nutrients in the Semi-Arid Region of BeijingâTianjin, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSemiarid regions worldwide are particularly prone to eutrophication, which causes immense ecological and economic problems.

The average concentrations of total HCHs and DDXs in the bulk soils were 3.6 and 80.1 ng/g for site A and 102 and 235 ng/g for site B, respectively. Relative accumulations of HCHs and DDXs in the rhizosphere soil from site A but not site B were demonstrated. The concentrations of total HCHs and DDXs in vegetable roots were 3.6-60 and 4.2-73 ng/g for site A and 15-152 and 7.1-136 ng/g for site B, respectively. Difference in bioaccumulation among various vegetables, especially between tuber and fibrous vegetables was significant. DDXs in spinach and cauliflower from site B and lindane (gamma-HCH) in cauliflower from both sites and violet from site B exceeded the maximum residual limits. Linear correlation of log-transformed HCHs and DDXs contents between the vegetable roots and the rhizosphere soils suggests the direct uptake of HCHs and DDXs.\n\n[A molecular epidemiological study of KI polyomavirus and WU polyomavirus in children with acute respiratory infection in Tianjin, China].\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Shu-Xiang; Wang, Wei; Guo, Wei; Yang, Hong-Jiang; Ma, Bai-Cheng; Fang, Yu-Lian; Xu, Yong-Sheng\n\n2017-07-01\n\nTo investigate the relationship of KI polyomavirus (KIPyV) and WU polyomavirus (WUPyV) with acute respiratory infection in children in Tianjin, China. A total of 3â730 nasopharyngeal secretions were collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory infection in Tianjin Children's Hospital from January 2011 to December 2013. Viral nucleic acid was extracted, and virus infection (KIPyV and WUPyV) was determined by PCR. Some KIPyV-positive and WUPyV-positive PCR products were subjected to sequencing. Sequencing results were aligned with the known gene sequences of KIPyV and WUPyV to construct a phylogenetic tree. Amplified VP1 fragments of KIPyV were inserted into the cloning vector (PUCm-T) transformed into E.â coli competent cells. Positive clones were identified by PCR and sequencing. The nucleotide sequences were submitted to GenBank. In addition, another seven common respiratory viruses in all samples were detected by direct immunofluorescence assay. In the 3â730 specimens, the KIPyV-positive rate was 12.14% (453/3â730) and the WUPyV-positive rate was 1.69% (63/3â730). The mean infection rate of KIPyV was significantly higher in June and July, while the mean infection rate of WUPyV peaked in February and March. Most of the KIPyV-positive or WUPyV-positive children were <3 years. The co-infections with KIPyV, WUPyV, and other respiratory viruses were observed in the children. The co-infection rate was 2.31% (86/3â730) and there were nine cases of co-infections with WUPyV and KIPyV. Thirty-five KIPyV-positive and twelve WUPyV-positive PCR products were sequenced and the alignment analysis showed that they had high homology with the known sequences (94%-100% vs 95%-100%). The VP1 gene sequences obtained from two KIPyV strains in this study were recorded in GenBank with the accession numbers of KY465925 and KY465926. For some children with acute respiratory infection in Tianjin, China, the acute respiratory infection may be associated with KIPy\n\nSpatial distribution of perchlorate, iodide and thiocyanate in the aquatic environment of Tianjin, China: environmental source analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nQin, Xiaolei; Zhang, Tao; Gan, Zhiwei; Sun, Hongwen\n\n2014-09-01\n\nAlthough China is the largest producer of fireworks (perchlorate-containing products) in the world, the pathways through which perchlorate enters the environment have not been characterized completely in this country. In this study, perchlorate, iodide and thiocyanate were measured in 101 water samples, including waste water, surface water, sea water and paired samples of rain water and surface runoff collected in Tianjin, China. The concentrations of the target anions were generally on the order of rain>surface waterâwaste water treatment plant (WWTP) influent>WWTP effluent. High concentrations of perchlorate, iodide and thiocyanate were detected in rain samples, ranging from 0.35 to 27.3 (median: 4.05), 0.51 to 8.33 (2.92), and 1.31 to 107 (5.62) ngmL(-)(1), respectively. Furthermore, the concentrations of the target anions in rain samples were significantly (r=0.596-0.750, p<0.01) positively correlated with the concentrations obtained in the paired surface runoff samples. The anions tested showed a clear spatial distribution, and higher concentrations were observed in the upper reaches of rivers, sea waters near the coast, and rain-surface runoff pairs sampled in urban areas. Our results revealed that precipitation may act as an important source of perchlorate, iodide and thiocyanate in surface water. Moreover, iodide concentrations in the Haihe River and Dagu Drainage Canal showed a good correlation with an ideal marker (acesulfame) of domestic waste water, indicating that input from domestic waste water was an important source of iodide in the surface waters of Tianjin.

The Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan urban region is one of the most heavily infected areas in the country. This study aimed to analyze epidemiological features of bacillary dysentery, detect spatial-temporal clusters of the disease, and analyze risk factors that may affect bacillary dysentery incidence in the region. Bacillary dysentery case data from January 2011 to December 2011 in Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan were used in this study. The epidemiological features of cases were characterized, then scan statistics were performed to detect spatial temporal clusters of bacillary dysentery. A spatial panel model was used to identify potential risk factors. There were a total of 28,765 cases of bacillary dysentery in 2011. The results of the analysis indicated that compared with other age groups, the highest incidence (473.75/105) occurred in individuals <5 years of age. The incidence in males (530.57/105) was higher compared with females (409.06/105). On a temporal basis, incidence increased rapidly starting in April. Peak incidence occurred in August (571.10/105). Analysis of the spatial distribution model revealed that factors such as population density, temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours were positively associated with incidence rate. Per capita gross domestic product was negatively associated with disease incidence. Meteorological and socio-economic factors have affected the transmission of bacillary dysentery in the urban Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region of China. The success of bacillary dysentery prevention and control department strategies would benefit from giving more consideration to climate variations and local socio-economic conditions.\n\nA study of ambient fine particles at Tianjin International Airport, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nRen, Jianlin; Liu, Junjie; Li, Fei; Cao, Xiaodong; Ren, Shengxiong; Xu, Bin; Zhu, Yifang\n\n2016-06-15\n\nThe total count number concentration of particles from 10 to 1000nm, particle size distribution, and PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameterâ¤2.5Î¼m) mass concentration were measured on a parking apron next to the runway at Tianjin International Airport in China. The data were collected 250, 270, 300, 350, and 400m from the runway. Wind direction and wind speed played important roles in determining the characteristics of the atmospheric particles. An inverted U-shaped relationship was observed between the measured particle number concentration and wind speed, with an average peak concentration of 2.2Ã10(5)particles/cm(3) at wind speeds of approximately 4-5m/s. The atmospheric particle number concentration was affected mainly by aircraft takeoffs and landings, and the PM2.5 mass concentration was affected mainly by the relative humidity (RH) of the atmosphere. Ultrafine particles (UFPs, diameter<100nm), with the highest number concentration at a particle size of approximately 16nm, dominated the measured particle size distributions. The calculated particle emission index values for aircraft takeoff and landing were nearly the same, with mean values of 7.5Ã10(15)particles/(kg fuel) and 7.6Ã10(15)particles/(kg fuel), respectively. The particle emission rate for one aircraft during takeoff is two orders of magnitude higher than for all gasoline-powered passenger vehicles in Tianjin combined. The particle number concentrations remained much higher than the background concentrations even beyond 400m from the runway. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei is one of the most polluted regions in China, so to monitor the PM2.5 concentrations over this region is quite critical for human health. By making use the new released hourly PM2.5 mass concentration from ground-based observations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei over China, and the collocated MODIS level 2 AOD data from April 2014 to March 2015, we explored the relation between surface PM2.5 mass concentration and MODIS AOD and possibility to derive the surface PM2.5 from satellite retrieval in the region. Our study show that the relation strongly depend on the seasons due to distinct seasonal characteristics of PM2.5 and AOD, with a relatively better correlation in spring and summertime than autumn and wintertime. Our analysis give an evidence that worse relationship and/or smaller number of sample in wintertime is associated with the significantly high PM2.5 concentration and a lot of missing data occurring in MODIS AOD, implying that current MODIS AOD retrieval scheme does not work very well in highly polluted cases. The derived PM2.5 mass concentration from MODIS AOD in summertime can basically capture the major observed features of the time series and about 20% large bias of the derived values compared to the observation is expected to be reduced once longer time period data is available and used for analysis.\n\nEffect of hurricane paths on storm surge response at Tianjin, China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFeng, Xingru; Yin, Baoshu; Yang, Dezhou\n\n2012-06-01\n\nA hurricane induced storm surge simulation system was developed for Tianjin coast, which consists of a hurricane model and a storm surge model. The peak storm surge result of the simulation agreed well with that of the observation. Three observed paths (Rita, Mimie and WINNIE) and a hypothetical path (Rita2) were chosen as the selective hurricane paths according to their positions relative to Tianjin. The sensitivity of Tianjin storm surge to the four paths was investigated using the validated storm surge simulation system. Three groups of experiments were done. In group one, the models were forced by the wind field and air pressure; in group two and three the models were forced by the wind only and the air pressure only respectively. In the experiments, the hurricane moved with a fixed speed and an intensity of 50 year return period. The simulation results show that path of the type Rita2 is the easiest to cause storm surge disaster in Tianjin, and the effect of air pressure forcing is most evident for path of the type Rita in Tianjin storm surge process. The above conclusions were analyzed through the evolution of the wind fields and the air pressure distributions. Comparing the experiment results of Group one, two and three, it can be seen that the storm surge is mainly induced by the wind forcing and the nonlinear interaction between the effect of wind forcing and air pressure forcing on the storm surge tends to weaken the storm surge.\n\nEvolution of the spatiotemporal pattern of PM2.5 concentrations in China - A case study from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYan, Dan; Lei, Yalin; Shi, Yukun; Zhu, Qing; Li, Li; Zhang, Zhien\n\n2018-06-01\n\nAtmospheric haze pollution has become a global concern because of its severe effects on human health and the environment. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration is located in northern China, and its haze is the most serious in China. The high concentration of PM2.5 is the main cause of haze pollution, and thus investigating the temporal and spatial characteristics of PM2.5 is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying PM2.5 pollution and for preventing haze. In this study, the PM2.5 concentration status in 13 cities from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was statistically analyzed from January 2016 to November 2016, and the spatial variation of PM2.5 was explored via spatial autocorrelation analysis. The research yielded three overall results. (1) The distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in this area varied greatly during the study period. The concentrations increased from late autumn to early winter, and the spatial range expanded from southeast to northwest. In contrast, the PM2.5 concentration decreased rapidly from late winter to early spring, and the spatial range narrowed from northwest to southeast. (2) The spatial dependence degree, by season from high to low, was in the order winter, autumn, spring, summer. Winter (from December to February of the subsequent year) and summer (from June to August) were, respectively, the highest and lowest seasons with regard to the spatial homogeneity of PM2.5 concentrations. (3) The PM2.5 concentration in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has significant spatial spillovers. Overall, cities far from Bohai Bay, such as Shijiazhuang and Hengshui, demonstrated a high-high concentration of PM2.5 pollution, while coastal cities, such as Chengde and Qinhuangdao, showed a low-low concentration.\n\nEpidemiological profile of thoracolumbar fracture (TLF) over a period of 10 years in Tianjin, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Bo; Sun, Chao; Zhao, Chenxi; Yao, Xue; Zhang, Yan; Duan, Huiquan; Hao, Jian; Guo, Xing; Fan, Baoyou; Ning, Guangzhi; Feng, Shiqing\n\n2018-03-29\n\nThe objective of the research was to illustrate the epidemiology profile of thoracolumbar fracture (TLF) in Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, China, from 2006-2015. Hospital-based retrospective study. Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. Medical records of inpatient patients with TLF from 1 January 2006 to December 2015 were collected. Detailed information on epidemiological characters were analyzed based on the medical records suffering from TLF from T11-L2 level, including incidence, age and sex, marital, occupation, etiology and fracture type, types of injuries. Totally 132 cases were identified. The incidence rate was 2.4 patient per million population at 2015. Male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1, with a mean age of 49.1âÂ±â17.7 years. The cases number in 46-60 group, totally 35 and accounting for 26.5%, was the largest. There is a significant differences of cases number between 2011-2015 group and 2006-2010 group. Retiree, taken up 48.5%, was the largest group among TLF patients. The most common injury level was T12 (34) accounting for 25.7%. Falls (57, 43.2%) (low falls and high falls) were the leading causes, followed by motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) (23, 17.4%).Compression is the only type of osteoporosis and took up 55.3%. The incidence ratio is increased annually in TMUGH. Male was more vulnerable than female based on different social character. The average age was older in 2011-2015, retiree accounted for the main proportion and compression took up the largest percentage, the mean age increased and osteoporosis takes more in recent years.\n\nScreening of 1300 organic micro-pollutants in groundwater from Beijing and Tianjin, North China.\n\nPubMed\n\nKong, Lingxiao; Kadokami, Kiwao; Duong, Hanh Thi; Chau, Hong Thi Cam\n\n2016-12-01\n\nGroundwater contamination in China has become a growing public concern because of the country's rapid economic development and dramatically increasing fresh water demand. However, there is little information available on groundwater quality, particularly with respect to trace organic micro-pollutants contamination. This study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence of 1300 pollutants at 27 groundwater sites in Beijing and Tianjin, North China. Seventy-eight chemicals (6% of the targeted compounds) were detected in at least one sampling point; observed chemicals included polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, plasticizers, antioxidants, pharmaceuticals and other emerging compounds. Chemicals with a frequency of detection over 70% were 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (median concentration 152Â ngÂ L -1 ), benzyl alcohol (582Â ngÂ L -1 ), 2-phenoxy-ethanol (129Â ngÂ L -1 ), acetophenone (74Â ngÂ L -1 ), pentamethylbenzene (51Â ngÂ L -1 ), nitrobenzene (40Â ngÂ L -1 ) and dimethyl phthalate (64Â ngÂ L -1 ). Pesticides with concentrations exceeding the EU maximum residual limits (MRL) of 0.1Â Î¼gÂ L -1 were 1,4-dichlorobenzene, oxadixyl, diflubenzuron, carbendazim, diuron, and the E and Z isomers of dimethomorph. Naphthalene and its 7 alkylated derivatives were widely observed at maximum concentration up to 30Â Î¼gÂ L -1 , which, although high, is still below the Australian drinking water guidelines of 70Â Î¼gÂ L -1 . The risk assessment indicated there is no human health risk through the oral consumption from most wells, although there were four wells in which total seven compounds were found at the concentrations with a potential adverse health effects. This work provides a wide reconnaissance on broad spectrum of organic micro-contaminants in groundwater in North China. Copyright Â© 2016.

The derived PM2.5 mass concentration from MODIS AOD in summertime can basically capture the major observed features of the time series and about 20% large bias of the derived values compared to the observation is expected to be reduced if longer time period data is available and used for analysis.\n\nOccurrence of seven artificial sweeteners in the aquatic environment and precipitation of Tianjin, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nGan, Zhiwei; Sun, Hongwen; Feng, Biting; Wang, Ruonan; Zhang, Yanwei\n\n2013-09-15\n\nSeventy water samples, including wastewaters, tap waters, fresh surface waters, coastal waters, groundwaters, and precipitation samples, from Tianjin, China, were analyzed for seven commonly used artificial sweeteners (ASs). The concentrations of the investigated ASs were generally in the order of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent > WWTP effluent > surface water > tap water > groundwater â precipitation, while the composition profiles of ASs varied in different waters. Acesulfame, sucralose, cyclamate, and saccharin were consistently detected in surface waters and ranged from 50 ng/L to 0.12 mg/L, while acesulfame was the dominant AS in surface and tap waters. Aspartame was found in all of the surface waters at a concentration up to 0.21 Î¼g/L, but was not found in groundwaters and tap waters. Neotame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone were less frequently detected and the concentrations were low. The concentrations of the ASs in some of the surface waters were of the same order with those in the WWTP influents, but not with the effluents, indicating there are probably untreated discharges into the surface waters. The ASs were detected in precipitation samples with high frequency, and acesulfame, saccharin, and cyclamate were the predominant ASs, with concentrations ranging from 3.5 ng/L to 1.3 Î¼g/L. A gross estimation revealed that precipitation may act as a source for saccharin and cyclamate in the surface environment of Tianjin city. Moreover, the presence of ASs in the atmosphere was primarily assessed by taking 4 air samples to evaluate their potential source in precipitation. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Baseline data were collected from policemen who completed the Occupational Stress Inventory-Revised (OSI-R) questionnaire, a self-designed questionnaire, and underwent free clinical measurements at the Medical Center of Police Hospital in Tianjin, China, in April 2007. A total of 5811 policemen participated in follow-up with the dynamic observation of new-onset diabetes (NOD) events occurring annually between 2008 and 2011. Occupational stress was measured by the OSI-R questionnaire, which contains 14 different scales. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) of the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by occupational stressors. A total of 3.1% of the participants (n = 179) developed NOD in the follow-up period from 2008 to 2011, and the incidence rates of NOD were 0.58% in 2008, 0.98% in 2009, 0.52% in 2010, and 1.01% in 2011. Role overload (RO), role boundary (RB), physical environment (PE), interpersonal strain (IS), and physical strain (PHS) were associated with the incidence of T2DM (RO: HR = 1.574, 95% CI = 1.071-2.372; RB: HR = 1.645, 95% CI = 1.144-2.365; PE: HR = 2.292, 95% CI = 1.545-3.400; IS: HR = 1.537, 95% CI = 1.079-2.191; and PHS: HR = 1.680, 95% CI = 1.167-2.006) after adjustment for confounding factors. A subgroup Cox regression analysis among traffic control police officers showed the specific work stressors remained robust except RO. Several aspects of stressors were independent predictors of T2DM in a prospective cohort study in Tianjin, China. This practical information can be applied to the development of psychological interventions against T2DM.\n\nModeling of a deep-seated geothermal system near Tianjin, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nXun, Z; Mingyou, C; Weiming, Z; Minglang, L\n\n2001-01-01\n\nA geothermal field is located in deep-seated basement aquifers in the northeastern part of the North China Plain near Tianjin, China. Carbonate rocks of Ordovician and Middle and Upper Proterozoic age on the Cangxian Uplift are capable of yielding 960 to 4200 m3/d of 57 degrees C to 96 degrees C water to wells from a depth of more than 1000 m. A three-dimensional nonisothermal numerical model was used to simulate and predict the spatial and temporal evolution of pressure and temperature in the geothermal system. The density of the geothermal water, which appears in the governing equations, can be expressed as a linear function of pressure, temperature, and total dissolved solids. A term describing the exchange of heat between water and rock is incorporated in the governing heat transport equation. Conductive heat flow from surrounding formations can be considered among the boundary conditions. Recent data of geothermal water production from the system were used for a first calibration of the numerical model. The calibrated model was used to predict the future changes in pressure and temperature of the geothermal water caused by two pumping schemes. The modeling results indicate that both pressure and temperature have a tendency to decrease with time and pumping. The current withdrawal rates and a pumping period of five months followed by a shut-off period of seven months are helpful in minimizing the degradation of the geothermal resource potential in the area.\n\nHow to reach haze control targets by air pollutants emission reduction in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China?\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Feng; Xiang, Nan; Higano, Yoshiro\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCurrently, Haze is one of the greatest environmental problems with serious impacts on human health in China, especially in capital region (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region). To alleviate this problem, the Chinese government introduced a National Air Pollution Control Action Plan (NAPCAP) with air pollutants reduction targets by 2017. However, there is doubt whether these targets can be achieved once the plan is implemented. In this work, the effectiveness of NAPCAP is analyzed by developing models of the statistical relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and air pollutant emissions (SO2, NOx, smoke and dust), while taking into account wind and neighboring transfer impacts. The model can also identify ways of calculating the intended emission levels in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. The results indicate that haze concentration control targets will not be attained by following the NAPCAP, and that the amount of progress needed to meet the targets is unrealistic. A more appropriate approach to reducing air emissions is proposed, which addresses joint regional efforts.\n\nRegional transport of anthropogenic pollution and dust aerosols in spring to Tianjin - A coastal megacity in China.\n\nPubMed\n\nSu, Xiaoli; Wang, Qiao; Li, Zhengqiang; Calvello, Mariarosaria; Esposito, Francesco; Pavese, Giulia; Lin, Meijing; Cao, Junji; Zhou, Chunyan; Li, Donghui; Xu, Hua\n\n2017-04-15\n\nSimultaneous measurements of columnar aerosol microphysical and optical properties, as well as PM 2.5 chemical compositions, were made during two types of spring pollution episodes in Tianjin, a coastal megacity of China. The events were investigated using field observations, satellite data, model simulations, and meteorological fields. The lower Ã ngstrÃ¶m Exponent and the higher aerosol optical depth on 29 March, compared with the earlier event on 26 March, implied a dominance of coarse mode particles - this was consistent with the differences in volume-size distributions. Based on the single scattering spectra, the dominant absorber (at blue wavelength) changed from black carbon during less polluted days to brown carbon on 26 March and dust on 29 March. The concentrations of major PM 2.5 species for these two episodes also differed, with the earlier event enriched in pollution-derived substances and the later with mineral dust elements. The formation mechanisms of these two pollution episodes were also examined. The 26 March episode was attributed to the accumulation of both local emissions and anthropogenic pollutants transported from the southwest of Tianjin under the control of high pressure system. While the high aerosol loading on 29 March was caused by the mixing of transported dust from northwest source region with local urban pollution. The mixing of transported anthropogenic pollutants and dust with local emissions demonstrated the complexity of springtime pollution in Tianjin. The synergy of multi-scale observations showed excellent potential for air pollution study. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the relationship between the gene structure and function of nucleoprotein (NP) of Tianjin strain, NP gene of paramyxovirus Tianjin strain was cloned and three domains of NP were expressed. The homologous and phylogenetic analysis of NP sequences among the paramyxovirus Tianjin strain and eight strains of Sendai viruses from GenBank were performed. The results indicated the recombinant proteins NP1, NP2 and NP3 showed the native antigenicity to the polyclonal antiserum of paramyxovirus Tianjin strain, ranking as NP3>NP1>NP2 (precedence order). The homology of NP nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences between paramyxovirus Tianjin strain and Sendai virus BB1 strain were 94.5%, 96.2%, respectively, whereas the identity were 85.1% - 88.7% and 92.4% - 94.7% among Tianjin strain and the 7 strains of Sendai viruses from GenBank respectively. There were 15 unique amino acid substitutions in Tianjin strain NP protein and 11 common amino acid substitutions same with BB1 strain. This research confirmed that paramyxovirus Tianjin strain might be a new genotype of Sendai virus and can be helpful in the establishment of detection assay applying recombinant NP as antigen instead of the whole virions.\n\nSpatial-temporal detection of risk factors for bacillary dysentery in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Chengdong; Li, Yuanyuan; Wang, Jinfeng; Xiao, Gexin\n\n2017-09-25\n\nBacillary dysentery is the third leading notifiable disease and remains a major public health concern in China. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban region is the biggest urban agglomeration in northern China, and it is one of the areas in the country that is most heavily infected with bacillary dysentery. The objective of the study was to analyze the spatial-temporal pattern and to determine any contributory risk factors on the bacillary dysentery. Bacillary dysentery case data from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 in Beijing-Tianjin- Hebei were employed. GeoDetector method was used to determine the impact of potential risk factors, and to identify regions and seasons at high risk of the disease. There were 36,472 cases of bacillary dysentery in 2012 in the study region. The incidence of bacillary dysentery varies widely amongst different age groups; the higher incidence of bacillary dysentery mainly occurs in the population under the age of five. Bacillary dysentery presents apparent seasonal variance, with the highest incidence occurring from June to September. In terms of the potential meteorological risk factors, mean temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, mean wind speed and sunshine hours explain the time variant of bacillary dysentery at 83%, 31%, 25%, 17% and 13%, respectively. The interactive effect between temperature and humidity has an explanatory power of 87%, indicating that a hot and humid environment is more likely to lead to the occurrence of bacillary dysentery. Socio-economic factors affect the spatial distribution of bacillary dysentery. The top four factors are age group, per capita GDP, population density and rural population proportion, and their determinant powers are 61%, 27%, 25% and 21%, respectively. The interactive effect between age group and the other factors accounts forÂ more than 60% of bacillary dysentery transmission. Bacillary dysentery poses a higher risk in the population of children. It is affected by meteorological and\n\nMeasuring and Benchmarking Technical Efficiency of Public Hospitals in Tianjin, China: A Bootstrap-Data Envelopment Analysis Approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Hao; Dong, Siping\n\n2015-01-01\n\nChina has long been stuck in applying traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models to measure technical efficiency of public hospitals without bias correction of efficiency scores. In this article, we have introduced the Bootstrap-DEA approach from the international literature to analyze the technical efficiency of public hospitals in Tianjin (China) and tried to improve the application of this method for benchmarking and inter-organizational learning. It is found that the bias corrected efficiency scores of Bootstrap-DEA differ significantly from those of the traditional Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (BCC) model, which means that Chinese researchers need to update their DEA models for more scientific calculation of hospital efficiency scores. Our research has helped shorten the gap between China and the international world in relative efficiency measurement and improvement of hospitals. It is suggested that Bootstrap-DEA be widely applied into afterward research to measure relative efficiency and productivity of Chinese hospitals so as to better serve for efficiency improvement and related decision making.

In the past decades, rapid urbanization and industrialization have given rise to a significant increase in ozone precursor emissions in many regions of China, especially in the densely populated megacities. Due to the highly nonlinear impacts of ozone precursors including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on ozone photochemistry, formation of ozone affected by different precursor emission patterns in those megacities has exhibited different characteristics. A comparative analysis of ozone photochemical production in the megacities of Tianjin and Shanghai has thus been carried out, using the data sets of surface ozone and its precursors measured respectively at an urban and a suburban site of the two megacities during the summertime. Observation-based analysis indicated an elevated ozone daily peak under photochemistry dominant conditions from the urban center to the suburb in both regions, nevertheless bearing different reasons. Ozone production was generally sensitive to VOCs in the Tianjin region, leading to a relatively higher level of ozone in the suburb where reactive VOCs were abundantly released from a number of industrial facilities, whereas a sensitivity of ozone production to NOx was found in Shanghai. The high level of NOx emitted mainly by motor vehicles in urban Shanghai largely inhibited ozone formation and resulted in a much more rapid decrease in ozone concentrations after reaching the daily maximum around midday compared with the other three areas. Ozone pollution in the megacity of Tianjin was more representative of the regional condition, implying that combined efforts would be needed to bring the ozone problem under control within this region.

Email addresses of co-authors: wanghaiyan@mail.bnu.edu.cnABSTRACTLaunched in 2000, the Beiing-Tainjin Sand Source Controlling Project (BTSSCP) is an ecological restoration project intended to prevent desertification in China. Evidence from multiple sources has confirmed increases in vegetation growth in the BTSSCP region since the initiation of the project. Precipitation and related soil moisture conditions typically are considered to be the main drivers of vegetation growth in this arid region. However, by investigating the relationships between vegetation growth and corresponding climatic factors, we identified seasonal variation in the climatic constraints of vegetation growth. In spring, vegetation growth is stimulated mainly by elevated temperature, whereas precipitation is the lead driver of summer greening. In autumn, positive effects of both temperature and precipitation on vegetation growth were observed. Furthermore, strong biosphere-atmosphere interactions were observed in this region. Spring warming promotes vegetation growth, but also reduces soil moisture. Summer greening has a strong cooling effect on land surface temperature. These results indicate that 1) precipitation-based projections of vegetation growth may be misleading; and 2) the ecological and environment consequences of ecological projects should be comprehensively evaluated. KEYWORDS: vegetation growth, climatic drivers, seasonal variation, BTSSCP\n\nOccurrence of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans and biphenyls pollution in sediments from the Haihe River and Dagu Drainage River in Tianjin City, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Hanxia; Zhang, Qinghua; Wang, Yawei; Cai, Zongwei; Jiang, Guibin\n\n2007-08-01\n\nThe pollution status of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the sediments of Haihe River, which is the most polluted among the seven largest basins in China, Dagu Drainage River flowing through a chemical industry zone, and two other rivers flowing into Bohai Sea in Tianjin City, China were investigated. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in the sediments from the mainstream of Haihe River were 1.3-26pgI-TEQg(-1) dry weight (dw) and 0.07-0.54pgTEQg(-1)dw, respectively. Heavy PCDD/Fs and PCBs pollution, with 1264pgI-TEQg(-1)dw and 21pgTEQg(-1)dw, was found in sediment from Dagu Drainage River. The congener profiles of PCDD/Fs indicated that the principal contamination source was the production of pentachlorophenol (PCP) or PCP-Na in this area. The correlation between PCDD/Fs or PCBs and total organic matter (TOM) showed that PCDD/Fs or PCBs were independent on TOM.\n\nHealth risk assessment of heavy metals in soils and vegetables from wastewater irrigated area, Beijing-Tianjin city cluster, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Yanchun; Qiao, Min; Liu, Yunxia; Zhu, Yongguan\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe possible health risks of heavy metals contamination to local population through food chain were evaluated in Beijing and Tianjin city cluster, China, where have a long history of sewage irrigation. The transfer factors (TF) for heavy metals from soil to vegetables for six elements including Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, As and Cd were calculated and the pollution load indexes (PLI) were also assessed. Results indicate that only Cd exceeded the maximum acceptable limit in these sites. So far, the heavy metal concentrations in soils and vegetables were all below the permissible limits set by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China and World Health Organization. The transfer factors of six heavy metals showed the trend as Cd > Zn > Cu > Pb > As > Cr, which were dependent on the vegetable species. The estimated dietary intakes of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, As and Cd were far below the tolerable limits and the target hazard quotient (THQ) values were less than 1, which suggested that the health risks of heavy metals exposure through consuming vegetables were generally assumed to be safe.\n\nAerosol chemical compositions in the North China Plain and the impact on the visibility in Beijing and Tianjin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZou, Jianan; Liu, Zirui; Hu, Bo; Huang, Xiaojuan; Wen, Tianxue; Ji, Dongsheng; Liu, Jingyun; Yang, Yang; Yao, Qing; Wang, Yuesi\n\n2018-03-01\n\nTo better understand the characteristics of the chemical compositions of aerosols comprised of water soluble ions (WSIs) and carbonaceous aerosol (CA) and their impacts on the visibility throughout the North China Plain (NCP), four experimental sampling campaigns were carried out between June 2013 and May 2014. The sampling sites were located in Beijing, Xiangshan, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Qinhuangdao. The air pollution episodes mainly occurred during the autumn and winter in the NCP. With regard to different particle size distributions, the ratio of anions to cations in the fine size (0.64) was greater than that in the coarse size (0.54) in the NCP. Coefficients of divergence indicate that aerosol pollution had similar characteristics in the five cities of the NCP and that the pollutants were characterized by mutual influences and regional transfer processes. There were different non-linear correlations between the visibility and mass concentrations of PM2.5 at different relative humidity (RH) conditions. When the RH was > 70%, the visibility was < 5 km; this shows that, due to hygroscopic growth in a higher RH, the increase in PM2.1 resulted in a decrease in the visibility. The Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) method was used to estimate the light extinction coefficients (LEC) from the measured concentrations of chemical species. Organic matter (OM), ammonium nitrate (AN), and ammonium sulfate (AS) were the three dominant species that contributed to the LEC in Beijing and had the highest proportions of total contributions to the LEC in the summer, accounting for 32.2%, 25.9%, and 24.4%, respectively. The LEC of sea salts did not change much throughout the year and accounted for 4.1-5.3% in Beijing and 4.8-7.4% in Tianjin. According to the Ambient Air Quality Standard, the days were divided into pollutional days (PD) and attained days (AD). The increasing concentrations of AN, AS and OM resulted in an increase in the LEC in the\n\nEco-efficiency for greenhouse gas emissions mitigation of municipal solid waste management: a case study of Tianjin, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Wei; Huppes, Gjalt; van der Voet, Ester\n\n2011-06-01\n\nThe issue of municipal solid waste (MSW) management has been highlighted in China due to the continually increasing MSW volumes being generated and the limited capacity of waste treatment facilities. This article presents a quantitative eco-efficiency (E/E) analysis on MSW management in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. A methodology for E/E analysis has been proposed, with an emphasis on the consistent integration of life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC). The environmental and economic impacts derived from LCA and LCC have been normalized and defined as a quantitative E/E indicator. The proposed method was applied in a case study of Tianjin, China. The study assessed the current MSW management system, as well as a set of alternative scenarios, to investigate trade-offs between economy and GHG emissions mitigation. Additionally, contribution analysis was conducted on both LCA and LCC to identify key issues driving environmental and economic impacts. The results show that the current Tianjin's MSW management system emits the highest GHG and costs the least, whereas the situation reverses in the integrated scenario. The key issues identified by the contribution analysis show no linear relationship between the global warming impact and the cost impact in MSW management system. The landfill gas utilization scenario is indicated as a potential optimum scenario by the proposed E/E analysis, given the characteristics of MSW, technology levels, and chosen methodologies. The E/E analysis provides an attractive direction towards sustainable waste management, though some questions with respect to uncertainty need to be discussed further. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

With meteorological data and pollutants monitoring data, the characteristics of this event and the role of fog in haze were investigated. During this process, the visibility was less than 600 m, especially in the haze and fog coexisting period (below 100 m). The peak value of PM2.5 mass concentration appeared in the haze only period was 446 Î¼g/m3. The fog played a role in scavenging and removing PM2.5 during haze and fog coexisting period. The surface high humidity province can match well with the high PM2.5 concentration region in pollutants removal period. The fog top height was reduced to about 200 m by cold air. Although the cold air has arrived in Tianjin high altitude, the saturated layer below 200 m maintained for nearly 12 h. The heavy fog prevented the momentum in upper atmosphere from transmitting downward and caused the high altitude cold air difficult to reach the ground. The latent heat flux was transmitted upward ahead of sensible heat flux in pollutants removal period, indicating the increasing tendency of mechanical turbulence after fog dissipation. Turbulent kinetic energy (Etk) and the surface mean kinetic energy (E) also enhanced after fog dissipation. It demonstrates that the termination of haze was delayed by heavy fog.\n\nGenetic polymorphisms of short tandem repeat loci D13S305, D13S631 and D13S634 in the Han population of Tianjin, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Yunfang; Li, Xiaozhou; Ju, Duan; Li, Yan; Zhang, Xiuling; Zhang, Ying\n\n2015-08-01\n\nShort tandem repeat (STR) markers, also known as microsatellites, are extensively used in mapping studies, forensics and disease diagnosis due to their small dimension and low mutation and high polymorphism rates. In recent years quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) has been successfully used to amplify STR markers in the prenatal diagnosis of common chromosomal abnormalities. This method provides a diagnosis of common aneuploidies 24-48 h after sampling with low error rates and cost; however, the size of different alleles, frequency, heterozygosity and distribution of STR markers vary among different populations. In the present study three STR markers, D13S305, D13S631 and D13S634, on chromosome 13 were analyzed in 350 unrelated individuals (200 males and 150 females) from the Han population of Tianjin, China using QF-PCR. Eleven, seven and 11 alleles of each marker were observed, respectively. The frequencies of the genotypes were in good agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P>0.05). The results showed that these three STR markers were highly polymorphic in the Han population of Tianjin, China. The study has provided basic data for use in the prenatal diagnosis of Patau syndrome.\n\nSource data supported high resolution carbon emissions inventory for urban areas of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region: Spatial patterns, decomposition and policy implications.\n\nPubMed\n\nCai, Bofeng; Li, Wanxin; Dhakal, Shobhakar; Wang, Jianghao\n\n2018-01-15\n\nThis paper developed internationally compatible methods for delineating boundaries of urban areas in China. By integrating emission source data with existing official statistics as well as using rescaling methodology of data mapping for 1Â km grid, the authors constructed high resolution emission gridded data in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) region in China for 2012. Comparisons between urban and non-urban areas of carbon emissions from industry, agriculture, household and transport exhibited regional disparities as well as sectoral differences. Except for the Hebei province, per capita total direct carbon emissions from urban extents in Beijing and Tianjin were both lower than provincial averages, indicating the climate benefit of urbanization, comparable to results from developed countries. Urban extents in the Hebei province were mainly industrial centers while those in Beijing and Tianjin were more service oriented. Further decomposition analysis revealed population to be a common major driver for increased carbon emissions but climate implications of urban design, economic productivity of land use, and carbon intensity of GDP were both cluster- and sector-specific. This study disapproves the one-size-fits-all solution for carbon mitigation but calls for down-scaled analysis of carbon emissions and formulation of localized carbon reduction strategies in the Jing-Jin-Ji as well as other regions in China.

These drugs, also called RUSH in China, have become attractive among Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) in the past few years. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to understand the knowledge, attitude, and status of nitrite inhalant use among Chinese MSM. The study participants were recruited from Tianjin, China between April and August 2012. Information, including demographics, sexual behavior, and RUSH use, was obtained through structured interviewer questionnaires. Blood samples were also collected to identify the status of HIV, HSV, and syphilis infections. A total of 500 participants were interviewed. Of the participants, 64.0% knew that RUSH could increase sexual pleasure and 38.6% of the participants had used RUSH at least once. The mean duration of RUSH use was 1.5Â years. Among the participants who were familiar with RUSH, 60.0% had heard of RUSH for the first time after 2011, 55% received information about RUSH via the internet, and only 42.2% knew the side effects of RUSH. RUSH users were more likely to work in companies (Odds ratio [OR]: 2.61; 95% CI: 1.65-4.12), live with homosexual partners (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.19-2.92), not live alone (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.29-3.96), smoke cigarettes (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.02-2.17), use alcohol (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.12-2.39), and seek sexual partners on the internet (OR: 2.59; 95% CI: 1.50-4.50). The impact of RUSH abuse on the expanding HIV epidemic among MSM has been demonstrated in China. Our findings suggest that the communication and awareness of health hazard of recreational drugs should be reinforced in HIV prevention education, especially through new media. Future research is needed to further explore how integrative strategies should be used to reduce the substance abuse and risky sexual behaviors.\n\nGenetic polymorphisms of short tandem repeat loci D13S305, D13S631 and D13S634 in the Han population of Tianjin, China\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSHI, YUNFANG; LI, XIAOZHOU; JU, DUAN; LI, YAN; ZHANG, XIULING; ZHANG, YING\n\n2015-01-01\n\nShort tandem repeat (STR) markers, also known as microsatellites, are extensively used in mapping studies, forensics and disease diagnosis due to their small dimension and low mutation and high polymorphism rates.

The results showed that these three STR markers were highly polymorphic in the Han population of Tianjin, China. The study has provided basic data for use in the prenatal diagnosis of Patau syndrome.

Based on the daily air pollution index (API) and surface meteorological elements in Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang from 2001 to 2010, the relationships between API and meteorological elements were analyzed. The statistical analysis focused on the relationships at seasonal and monthly average scales, on different air pollution grades and air pollution processes. The results revealed that the air pollution conditions in the three areas gradually improved from 2001 to 2010, especially during summer; and the worst conditions in air quality were recorded in Beijing in spring due to the influences of dust, while in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang in winter due to household heating. Meteorological elements exhibited different influences on air pollution, showing similar relationships between API in monthly averages and four meteorological elements (i.e., the average, maximum and minimum temperatures, maximum air pressure, vapor pressure, and maximum wind speed); while the relationships on a seasonal average scale demonstrated significant differences. Compared with seasonal and monthly average scales of API, the relation coefficients based on different air pollution grades were significatively lower; while the relationship between API and meteorological elements based on air pollution process reduced the smoothing effect due to the average processing of seasonal and monthly API and improved the accuracy of the results based on different air pollution grades. Finally, statistical analysis of the distribution of pollution days in different wind directions indicated the directions of extreme and maximum wind speeds that mainly influence air pollution; representing a valuable information that could support the definition of air pollution control strategies through the\n\nMercury and cadmium contamination of irrigation water, sediment, soil and shallow groundwater in a wastewater-irrigated field in Tianjin, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, G-H; Cao, S-S\n\n2010-03-01\n\nWe investigated the concentrations of Hg, Cd, Pb and As in samples of irrigation water, sediment, soil and groundwater from a field in Tianjin that was irrigated with wastewater. The results showed that the concentrations (Hg, 0.82 microg/L; Cd, 0.18 microg/L; Pb, 1.5 microg/L; As, 8.02 microg/L) in the irrigation water did not exceed the China Surface Water Quality Standard or the maximum concentrations in irrigation water recommended by the FAO. The concentrations of metals in the groundwater of wells (Hg, 0.016 microg/L; Cd, 0.128 microg/L; Pb, 0.25 microg/L; As, 4.65 microg/L) were lower than China Groundwater Quality Standard and the WHO guideline values for drinking water. The groundwater had not yet been contaminated through vertical infiltration-induced leaching. However, a substantial buildup of Hg and Cd in river sediments (I(geo) for Hg and Cd; 5.24 and 3.04, respectively) and wastewater-irrigated soils (I(geo) for Hg and Cd; 2.50 and 3.09, respectively) was observed. Taken together, these results indicated that irrigation with wastewater damaged the soil quality over the long term and that metals more easily accumulated in vegetable fields than rice fields.\n\nDispersion modeling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from combustion of biomass and fossil fuels and production of coke in Tianjin, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nTao, Shu; Li, Xinrong; Yang, Yu; Coveney, Raymond M; Lu, Xiaoxia; Chen, Haitao; Shen, Weiran\n\n2006-08-01\n\nA USEPA, procedure, ISCLT3 (Industrial Source Complex Long-Term), was applied to model the spatial distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emitted from various sources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, and biomass into the atmosphere of Tianjin, China. Benzo[a]pyrene equivalent concentrations (BaPeq) were calculated for risk assessment. Model results were provisionally validated for concentrations and profiles based on the observed data at two monitoring stations. The dominant emission sources in the area were domestic coal combustion, coke production, and biomass burning. Mainly because of the difference in the emission heights, the contributions of various sources to the average concentrations at receptors differ from proportions emitted. The shares of domestic coal increased from approximately 43% at the sources to 56% at the receptors, while the contributions of coking industry decreased from approximately 23% at the sources to 7% at the receptors. The spatial distributions of gaseous and particulate PAHs were similar, with higher concentrations occurring within urban districts because of domestic coal combustion. With relatively smaller contributions, the other minor sources had limited influences on the overall spatial distribution. The calculated average BaPeq value in air was 2.54 +/- 2.87 ng/m3 on an annual basis. Although only 2.3% of the area in Tianjin exceeded the national standard of 10 ng/m3, 41% of the entire population lives within this area.\n\nPhthalate esters (PAEs) i"
