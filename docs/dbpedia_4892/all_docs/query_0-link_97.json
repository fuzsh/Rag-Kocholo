Chapter one deals with different potentially malignant disorders in the development of OSCC, diagnostic methods of OSCC, the pertinence of biomarkers in OSCC therapy, classification of biomarkers, existing biomarkers in different stages of OSCC and the challenges of developing new biomarkers. Chapter two is focused on principles, systems, technologies, therapeutic approaches, safety and toxicity and patents comprising drug delivery systems for local oral squamous cell carcinoma treatment. Chapter three aims to highlight a detailed critical review of previous literature on putative cancer stem cell pathways for oral carcinoma and draw interest in targeting the most common cancer stem cell markers as a therapeutic regimen for oral cancer preneoplastic tumors, metastasis, and treatment progression. Chapter four aims to cover the recent developments in nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems, advanced nanomedicines and their diagnostics as well as therapeutic applications in OSCC. Finally, chapter five aims to elaborate on the importance of biomarkers as an early diagnostic tool in detecting oral squamous cell carcinoma. Chapter 1 - Oral Cancer is the sixth most common type of cancer worldwide and 90% of it is represented by Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma\n\nviii\n\nMatthew Rabin\n\n(OSCC). India has the highest prevalence of OSCC as per the World Oral Health Report. OSCC has few risk factors associated with it such as high metastasis rate, high probability of recurrence, less survival rate and lack of public awareness. Despite many advancements in therapeutic strategies, there is a tremendous increase in the mortality and morbidity rate due to the availability of tobacco and related products that elevate the occurrence of the disease. The majority of patients are diagnosed and treated for this disease at the terminal stages (III or IV). These are the main reasons for the escalating mortality rates. Due to this, there is an immense necessity for early diagnosis of OSCC which should be given utmost importance. Biomarkers are indispensable biological molecules that can be used to identify normal cellular alterations. Histological examination using biomarkers is considered as one of the most reliable technique for the diagnosis of OSCC. These biomarkers can also be analyzed by other means such as solid biopsy and liquid biopsy which contains DNA, RNA or proteins used for examining the expression pattern of particular genes or proteins. There are three broad categories of biomarker discoveries: Genomic, Proteomic and Metabolomic which is expressed during progression and metastasis of OSCC. This chapter deals with different potentially malignant disorders in the development of OSCC, diagnostic methods of OSCC, the pertinence of biomarker in OSCC therapy, classification of biomarkers, existing biomarkers in different stages of OSCC and the challenges of developing new biomarkers. Chapter 2 - Oral squamous cell carcinoma is the third most common type of malignancy in developing countries and the eighth most common in developed countries. The rate survival is poor when there is late detection of these lesions. The development of oral mucosal drug delivery systems may be quite useful as treatment and as adjuvant of oral cancer. This chapter is focused on principles, systems, technology, therapeutic approaches, safety and toxicity and patents comprising drug delivery systems for local oral squamous cell carcinoma treatment. In this context, the most valuable and up-to-date oral drug delivery systems for oral squamous cell carcinoma were discussed. Some aspects and definitions were revised in terms of oral mucosal environment, challenges, and benefits of local treatment of oral\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nsquamous cell carcinoma, as well as the characteristics of the active pharmaceutical ingredients. The strategies to foster the drug delivery, the advances in both in vitro and in vivo activity, and patents and registered products in the market aiming local treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma were considered. Chapter 3 - Recurrence of tumors despite chemotherapy represents a profound medical condition with cancer of the oral cavity. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been recognized to orchestrate metastasis and facilitate tumor development in oral squamous cell carcinoma via the capability of selfrenewal and proliferation to generate downstream progenitor cells and cancer cells. This chapter aims to highlight a detailed critical review of previous literature on putative cancer stem cell pathways for oral carcinoma and draw interest in targeting the most common cancer stem cell markers as a therapeutic regimen for oral cancer preneoplastic tumors, metastasis, and treatment progression. Thus, targeting cancer stem cells may help overcome the tumor spread and therapeutic resistance by reversing the epithelial and EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) subpopulations shifts. Chapter 4 - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common cancer worldwide. Several factors influence OSCC, tobacco use having a high impact on OSCC development. The prevention of OSCC may be possible by reducing exposure to the risk factors of OSCC. OSCC is the sixth most deadly cancer globally, owing to the drawback of the traditional approach in OSCC treatment and failure of diagnosis at an early stage. The primary stage of detection and a sedentary lifestyle mainly contributes to the morbidity and mortality of OSCC patients. In this scenario, nanotechnology gives a new direction for the treatment and diagnosis of oral cancer. Nanomedicine shows a highly promising result with low toxicity. The toxicity of nanomaterial can be controlled by improving functionalization and systematically minimizing toxicity. As a result, nanomaterial and nanomedicine becomes more biologically compatible. Nanomedicine-based targeted drug delivery to the tumor site releases therapeutic agents most effectively, possibly increasing the efficacy of nanomedicine. This book chapter aims to cover the recent developments in Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems, advance nanomedicines (Nano-capsules, Gold\n\nx\n\nMatthew Rabin\n\nnanoparticles, Quantum dots, and Carbon nanotubes) and their diagnostics as well as therapeutic applications in OSCC. Chapter 5 - According to global cancer statistics 2018 (GLOBOCAN 2018), cancer is the second leading cause of death globally. Estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases and 9.6 million cancer deaths. It is most common in India, accounting for 120000 with 90% of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The incidence and mortality rate of cancer has shown a sharp increase over the last two decades. Most oral cancers are not diagnosed at an early stage even though they are easily accessible under direct visual examination. Mortality rates remain unchanged despite vast advances in the field of oncology. Therefore, more intense efforts are required to fight against life-threatening diseases and to reduce morbidity and mortality rates. Biomarkers are powerful diagnostic tools that can be measured in bodily fluids such as blood, serum, plasma, and body secretions such as saliva. They release certain biochemical substances that are expressed in large quantities at the cell surface by malignant cells. The anatomical proximity of salivary biomarkers to oral cancer makes it the most accurate and specific diagnostic tool and it is a non-invasive alternative to serum testing. More than 100 salivary biomarkers have already been identified, including cytokines (IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-a), P53, transferrin, DUSP, MMP, and LDH. In recent years due to the revolution in molecular biology, the development of valid biomarkers has been a breakthrough in the field of cancer research and care. Substantial progress has been made in the development and clinical application of biomarkers and matched targeted therapies. The recent emergence of highly selective technologies has provided global information to observe genetic and proteomic alterations and to facilitate the discovery of new biomarkers with improved sensitivity and specificity. The use of biomarker-based diagnostics for cancer includes non-invasive screening for early-stage disease, detection and localization, risk assessment, disease stratification and prognosis, response to therapy and, for those in remission, screening for disease recurrence. The current chapter aims to elaborate on the importance of biomarkers as an early diagnostic tool in detecting oral squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nIn: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma ISBN: 978-1-53619-895-9 Editor: Matthew Rabin © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.\n\nChapter 1\n\nBIOMARKERS IN THE PROGRESSION AND METASTASIS OF ORAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA Bhuvanadas Sreeshma1, Diveyaa Sivakumar2, Dibyo Maiti3 and Arikketh Devi Department of Genetic Engineering, Cancer Biology and Stem Cell Biology Lab, School of Bioengineering, College of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, TamilNadu, India\n\nABSTRACT Oral Cancer is the sixth most common type of cancer worldwide and 90% of it is represented by Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC).

Every year, more than million patients are affected by cancer worldwide. Among the various types of cancer, the incidence and mortality rates of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is higher in the Asian continent, especially being one of the top three common cancer prevalent in SouthCentral Asia. In middle and low-income countries, specifically in India, men are more prone to this cancer due to the ease of availability and consumption of areca nut, smokeless tobacco and other related products (Petersen et al. 2009). OSCC includes cancer of the lips, tongue, cheeks, floor of the mouth,\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n3\n\nhard and soft palate, sinuses, pharynx or any other part of the oral cavity. According to the World Health Organization statistics, one-third of the OSCC cases are from India (World Health Organization 2016). It is estimated that this proportion may get doubled by 2030 (Varshitha et al. 2015). OSCC has multifactorial aetiology, where the challenges such as high recurrence rate, late diagnosis, patient negligence and 5-year survival rate contributes to the worsening of the disease and this has remained unchanged for the past few decades. The progression and metastasis of OSCC are primarily due to genetic as well as epigenetic changes combined with the environmental risk factors such as tobacco use, smoking, alcohol consumption, Human Papilloma Virus infection and chronic inflammation (B. Wang et al. 2013). In OSCC, 90% of the deaths are due to metastasis especially when the patients do not respond to any of the treatment options. Though an examination of the oral cavity is quite easy by visualization, most of the OSCC cases are not identified at the early stages as it is mostly asymptomatic during this stage. (Hadzic et al. 2017). Even though numerous prognostic and diagnostic methods for several cancers have been identified so far, the early detection of OSCC remains cumbersome. Furthermore, Epstein et al., 2015 has reported that abundant cases show delayed or misdiagnosis of OSCC by dental and medical health care providers while some others alleged that there are some health complications due to osteonecrosis of the jaw (Epstein et al. 2015).\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF ORAL SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OSCC tumorigenesis reveals a sequence of histopathological events ranging from hyperplasia to dysplasia of differing aggressiveness to carcinoma in situ which subsequently progresses to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (Hunter, Parkinson, and Harrison 2005). According to Braakhuis et al., 2003, OSCC is initiated by a genetic alteration in a stem cell located in the basal cell layer of oral mucosa which turns out into a patch termed as a clonal unit containing stem cell with its daughter cells having the same\n\n4\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\ngenetic alteration. Later, this patch expands along with additional genetic variations in the region and these mucosal fields dominate the growth of normal epithelium and expand in its size. These regions are invisible in the beginning but may appear as oral patches later. Eventually, clonal selection results in the formation of carcinoma (Braakhuis, B. J., Tabor, M. P., Kummer, J. A., Leemans, C. R., & Brakenhoff, n.d.). There are many Potentially Malignant Disorders (PMDs) that have a predisposition to reorganize into OSCC and these are the following: 1. Leukoplakia is common in men (54.2%) with around 80% of the cases leading to hyperkeratosis or acanthosis (Waldron and Shafer 1975). Bewley et al., 2017 has reported that this can lead to the formation of OSCC (Bewley and Farwell 2017), (Farooq and Bugshan 2020). 2. Proliferative Verrucous Leukoplakia (PVL) is a vigorous form of oral leukoplakia that forms white lesions which spreads slowly with a high rate of reappearance and malignancy (Thompson 2006). In addition, another study conducted by Bagán et al., 2004 showed similar results of a high probability of patients with PVL developing OSCC (Bagán et al. 2004). 3. Erythroleukoplakia is a condition of mixed red and white lesions appearing in the oral cavity. Abundant dysplastic lesions are seen in this condition when compared to leukoplakia (Bánóczy 1997). 4. Erythroplakia, a red coloured lesion, is considered a clinical finding of OSCC. Leukoplakia and erythroplakia are termed as predecessors of OSCC (Grajewski and Groneberg 2009). A study conducted by Yang et al., 2015 revealed that 91% of the samples are diagnosed as OSCC (51%), with 40% carcinoma in situ or severe dysplasia and 9% mild or moderate dysplasia (S. W. Yang et al. 2015). 5. Oral Lichen Planus (OLP) may persist for multiple years with periodic outbursts and remission. Although biopsies and histopathological examinations are recommended to diagnose this condition, there are no specific criteria to assess the risks associated with OLP. (Fitzpatrick, Hirsch, and Gordon 2014).\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n5\n\n6. Oral Lichenoid Lesions (OLL) or Oral Lichenoid Reactions (OLR) are intra-oral red and white lesions with similar clinical features as OLP. These are induced by drugs or can develop in persons who are continuous betel-quid chewers. Later, OLL can transform into malignant OSCC (van der Meij, Mast, and van der Waal 2007). 7. Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) is a condition caused as a result of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplants. It is accompanied by numerous signs and symptoms and involves multifarious organ sites, frequently affecting the oral cavity (Schubert and Correa 2008). It has been reported that GvHD has the potential to invade and form aggressive OSCC (Mawardi et al. 2011). 8. Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder with 20% of the patients manifesting oral lesions affecting buccal mucosa, palate and lips (Saman Warnakulasuriya 2018). The lower lip is the most commonly affected area in DLE mediated malignant transformation (Millard and Barker 1978). 9. Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSF) is a chronic disease involving the lamina propria of oral mucosa. As the disease progresses, it affects deeper tissues in the oral submucosa resulting in loss of fibroelasticity (Saman Warnakulasuriya 2018). The severity of the disease includes difficulty in opening the mouth and the presence of numerous lesions of erythroplakia and leukoplakia (S. Warnakulasuriya 1987), (Kerr et al. 2011). 10. Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a skin disease characterised by blisters and erosions in the oral mucosa. Even though EB is considered a potentially malignant disease, specific oral malignant lesions are not well characterized and the frequency of malignant transformation is comparatively less (Fine et al. 2009). 11. Leukokeratosis Nicotina Palatinae (LNP)/Palatal changes in reverse smokers is also another PMD that may transform to OSCC. Reverse smoking, is an unusual type of smoking in which the burned end of a rolled tobacco leaf termed as “chutta” (an Indian product) or cigarettes will be placed inside the mouth instead of the unsmoked\n\n6\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al. end. This type of habit is pervasive in many parts of India, Philippines, Panama, Colombia, Jamaica, Venezuela, Sardinia, Caribbean islands etc., Earlier research conducted by Gupta et al., in 1980 observed the presence of profuse PMDs in the oral palate in the course of a 10-year follow up (Gupta, Mehta, and Daftary 1980). This includes leukoplakia, mucosal nodularity, ulceration, yellowish-brown staining, erythema etc., which could develop into a malignancy. 12. Dyskeratosis congenital, a rare inherited condition of bone marrow failure shows oral leukoplakia as the most common symptom. These patients are more prone to develop malignancy (Bongiorno et al. 2017). 13. Actinic Cheilitis, achronic inflammation in lips, is caused due to prolonged exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation. Those who have less melanin content show significantly increased risk of developing this condition (Wood NH, Khammissa R, Meyerov R, Lemmer J, n.d.). During the disease progression, the ulcerative lesions may slowly develop, progress with inflammation, atrophy and finally, the loss of epithelium leads to the formation of OSCC (de Oliveira Ribeiro, da Silva, and Martins-Filho 2014). 14. Other PMDs include: a) Chronic Hyperplastic Candidiasis (CHC), also known by the term candidal leukoplakia is an oral candidiasis variant caused by Candida albicans. This condition is characterised by white patches in the oral mucosal layer. If the lesions are untreated, they may develop into OSCC (Shah et al. 2017). b) Syphilis is one of the main cause of cheilitis glandularis, which is a condition of hyperplasia of minor salivary glands that may progress to OSCC (Mortazavi, Baharvand, and Mehdipour 2014). c) Actinic Keratosis is an other intraepidermal skin tumour that can develop into SCC (Fuchs and Marmur 2007). d) Sideropenic Dysphagia, also known as Plummer-Vinson syndrome is a rare PMD characterized by dysphagia,\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n7\n\noesophageal webs and chronic iron deficiency anaemia. There are reports that this condition may also lead to the development of OSCC (Jessner et al. 2003).\n\nLATEST DIAGNOSTIC METHODS Despite the ease of clinical examination of the oral cavity, the majority of the PMDs are not diagnosed at their early stages and this is one of the reasons for the low survival rate of OSCC patients. In addition, lack of public awareness is also a crucial factor in OSCC diagnosis. Creating public awareness against the usage of tobacco-related products and reiterating the need for early diagnosis of OSCC by monitoring PMDs may effectively mitigate oral health problems (Macpherson et al. 2018), (Seki et al. 2011). Besides tumour size that plays a significant role in the prediction of OSCC, lymph node metastasis also is a decisive factor (S. F. Huang et al. 2012). Clinicians use the Tumor, Nodes and Metastasis (TNM) staging system to predict the tumour grade to date, but the unfortunate reality is that patients with identical TNM stages may exhibit different distinct clinical behaviours, treatment responses and patient outcomes (T. Y. Fu et al. 2016), (OliveiraCosta et al. 2015), (Jerjes et al. 2010). Thus, multitude of varying clinico pathological parameters can be observed for OSCC with regard to its incidence, recurrence, disease progression, survival and metastasis. Some of these are: 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) 7) 8) 9)\n\nPrimary site of occurrence Tumour size and volume (Depth of invasion) Lymph Node Involvement Metastasis (Distant/cervical) Degree of differentiation Invasive Front (Pattern of invasion) Perineural/Endoneural Invasion Gender Age at the first occurrence\n\n8\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al. 10) Race 11) Presence of dysplasia at the margin and severe dysplasia (SD) 12) Lymphovascular and nervous invasion 13) Bone/cartilage invasion 14) Tumour clearance\n\nAlthough there are advancements in existing clinical treatments, the overall survival rates of OSCC patients remains unsatisfactory. Preliminary diagnosis of OSCC is one of the pre-eminent way to alleviate the high mortality and morbidity of OSCC. Some of the non-invasive techniques used for diagnosis and confirmation of OSCC are:\n\nVital Staining These include some of the staining procedures followed using a collection of pigments that act on highly proliferative cells and neoplastic cells. A study highlighted the effective use of 5% acetic acid for OSCC diagnosis (Bhalang et al. 2008). Another research conducted by Sankaranarayanan et al., 2003 on cervical cancer stated that using 4% acetic acid is an effective diagnostic method with a sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 78% in particular (Sankaranarayanan et al. 2003). Toluidine blue staining is another easy, affordable and sensitive staining technique for identifying early stages of OSCC and severe dysplasia (Mashberg 1981). This acidophilic metachromatic nuclear stain helps to differentiate the carcinoma in situ regions or invasive carcinoma regions from normal tissue by staining only the nucleus which has a rapid proliferation rate. This stain is highly specific and sensitive to malignant regions. 1% of Toluidine Blue solution added for 30 seconds gives 93.5% to 97.8% sensitivity of OSCC screening and specificity ranging from 73.3% to 92.9% (Rosenberg and Cretin 1989). Methylene blue, an acidophilic dye penetrates into the cells containing a high amount of nucleic acid and shows variation in the uptake of stain between the normal and cancer cells (Y. W. Chen et al. 2007). Lugol’s\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n9\n\nIodine staining has more affinity towards glycogen in epithelial cells and therefore it stains normal cells more when compared to the cancer cells which have less glycogen content. As per a study conducted by Epstein et al.,1992, it was stated that Lugol’s Iodine can be used as a diagnostic procedure for oral malignancy (Epstein, Scully, and Spinelli 1992). The double staining procedure with Lugol’s Iodine and Methylene Blue greatly improves the detection efficiency of OSCC (G. Peng et al. 2011). Du et al., 2007 proposed a promising staining technique with Rose Bengal stain for evaluation of OSCC (Du et al. 2007).\n\nOral Brush Biopsy This simple, painless test is shown to have high sensitivity and specificity than surgical biopsies, ranging over 90%. Oral brush collects majority of the cells from the oral epithelium (Sciubba 1999), (Scheifele et al. 2004).\n\nSaliva Based OSCC Diagnosis This technique is an alternative for serum testing. Also, this is an effective diagnostic method for poor OSCC prognosis and to detect posttherapy status. Increased concentration of Cyfra 21-1, tissue polypeptide specific antigen (TPS), cancer antigen 125 (CA125) are a few of the antigens used for analysis (Handschel et al. 2007), (Zimmermann BG, n.d.). Liquid biopsy is one of the latest technology that makes use of saliva and is the most easily accessible, painless, low cost and helpful source of diagnostic and prognostic biomarker detection since it contains DNA, RNA, circulating tissue-derived cells, circulating tumour DNA, extracellular vesicles and miRNA.\n\n10\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\nLight-Based Detection System Devices specially designed with light source work on the tissue reflectance and tissue auto-fluorescence principle to enhance oral cavity scrutiny. Autofluorescence technique is introduced in some devices to analyse oral cavity such as VELscope®, Identafi 3000® with high specificity (Hanken et al. 2013), (Rana et al. 2012). Narrowband imaging is a novel endoscopic visualization technique using light generated with optical interference filters with varied lower frequency spectral range. Bhatia et al., 2013 revealed that the use of narrowband imaging technology is one of the processes with high specificity, sensitivity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for diagnosing OSCC (Bhatia et al. 2013).\n\nOther Light-Based Detection Systems include         \n\nRatio imaging Raman spectroscopy Elastic scattering spectroscopy Differential Path-Length Spectroscopy (DPS) Spectral Scatter Scanning System Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) Optical Coherence Tomography Infrared Spectroscopy Confocal Endomicroscopy\n\nChemiluminescence Based Detection ViziLite Plus® is a tissue reflectance-based device that uses a disposable chemiluminescent light packet. Microlux/DL® and Orascoptic DK® are devices that use a reusable LED (Light Emitting Diode) powered by a battery which provides light equivalent to blue-white light illumination (M.\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n11\n\nW. Lingen et al. 2008), (Rethman et al. 2010). The sensitivity and specificity of chemiluminescent based detection cannot be accounted as these were only conducted on patients with visible lesions.\n\nHistological and Cytological Techniques Incisional (IB) or Excisional Biopsy (EB) is the best available diagnostic technique for OSCC. Histopathology can determine the severity of epithelial dysplasia, the foremost prognostic malignancy indicator. Furthermore, histopathology helps to identify OSCC even though no lesions are visible. A study conducted by Goodson et al., 2011 reported that histological examinations are more accurate, as even the severity of dysplasia can be distinguished properly. According to pathologists complete excision of OSCC lesion is indispensable to diagnose and to expedite early potential therapy of undetectable OSCC with severe dysplastic and neoplastic lesions (Goodson and Thomson 2011). Cytopathology is the analysis of cell samples from oral mucosal surface collected by smears, scrapings, lavage etc., performed externally and using fine needle aspiration internally. Oral exfoliative cytology makes use of the cells that flake off from oral mucosa naturally or artificially and liquid-based cytology uses liquid medium for sampling, thence fixed to reduce sample degradation (M. W. Lingen et al. 2008). OralCDx® Brush Test system, Cytobrush®Plus GT are the types of specialized brushes which collect transepithelial cellular samples that contain cell clusters and free cells. There are innumerable literatures focussing on the efficacy and specificity of these systems (Fontes et al. 2013), (Delavarian et al. 2010).\n\nMolecular Analysis Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a slowly progressing aggressive cancer with multifarious levels of expression of signature molecular markers throughout the stages. These signature molecular\n\n12\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\nmarkers termed “biomarkers,” are identified and their expression patterns are ascertained in every stage of OSCC to distinguish the tumour grading. Therefore, the necessity for identifying a reliable biomarker for OSCC to differentiate various stages of OSCC is inevitable. There are numerous categories of biomarkers that have been identified so far in OSCC.\n\nEMINENCE OF BIOMARKERS IN OSCC THERAPY OSCC grading using molecular methods is one of the promising tools which minimizes the discrepancy in histology (Bremmer et al. 2005). The escalation of genetic variations in pivotal genes designated as protooncogenes, which can transform into oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes and DNA repair genes altogether facilitates the malformation of cells by modulation of normal cell genotype and phenotype. In addition to this, a series of molecular events which accelerate the development of deformed, rapidly proliferating cells (M. Lingen et al. 2011) also occurs continuously and these genetic alterations form the basis of oral tumorigenesis. The precise knowledge of these changes on genetic, molecular or metabolic molecules and the cellular processes underlying carcinogenesis can pave the way towards understanding and earliest identification of OSCC. The biomolecules generated by either tumour cells or other immune cells in the body in response to tumour development are called Cancer Biomarkers. It could be genes, gene products, cells, molecules, enzymes, hormones etc., that can be identified through tissues, blood, urine or other body fluids. These biomarkers are unique signature molecules that vary according to the type of cell it is derived from and may be released during OSCC initiation, development, progression and metastasis. Comprehending the oral tumorigenesis mechanism could explain the production and release of these markers into the blood or other body fluids in elevated amounts and its differential expression as cancer metastasizes. In addition to checking their presence or absence, the expression levels, activities of genes, proteins, molecular attributes etc., are also validated. Analysis of these candidate markers would facilitate and aid in understanding the molecular hallmarks\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n13\n\nof oral tumorigenesis. These molecular markers would also assist to anticipate, investigate and provide better knowledge on OSCC progression and metastasis. Moreover, the chromosomal aberrations corresponding to OSCC pathogenesis also needs to be analyzed and therefore it becomes a necessity to examine the predictive genetic markers for early detection, prognosis and predicting response to OSCC (M. Lingen et al. 2011). Biomarker analysis in OSCC plays a significant role in       \n\nEvaluating the risk of developing cancer (Easton et al. 1995) Screening (K. Lin et al. 2008) Differential diagnosis (Lauritano et al. 2016), (Blatt et al. 2017) Determining the prognosis of the disease (Harishankar et al. 2019), (Z. Yang et al. 2019) Predicting therapy response (Rettori et al. 2013) Monitoring disease recurrence (Rettori et al. 2013), (Cristaldi et al. 2019) Monitoring the progression or regression of metastasis (Sowmya, Rao, and Prasad 2020)\n\nAn ideal biomarker should be precise enough to differentiate benign case from the malignant cancer and aggressive metastasized tumour. Also, it should be         \n\nOrgan or tissue–specific Proportional to tumour volume Exhibit short half-life Easily identifyable even if present at low levels in the serum of healthy individuals (exist quantitatively) Distinguish metastasis Standardized Reproducible Validated Cost-effective\n\n14\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.    \n\nObtain the sample for testing in a non-invasive manner Reliable Accurate Specific and sensitive (Henry and Hayes 2012), (Kamel HF, n.d.).\n\nIDENTIFICATION OF CANDIDATE BIOMARKERS IN OSCC Biomarkers are identified by copious molecular techniques such as Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), High throughput NextGeneration sequencing, DNA arrays, Gene Expression Arrays, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), Ribonucleoprotein Immunoprecipitation-gene chip, Cross-linking Immunoprecipitation, Liquid Chromatography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Mass Spectroscopy, enzyme assays, Immunohistochemistry (IHC), multiplex IHC, Flow cytometry, mass cytometry, Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization etc., The principle approach to identify a candidate biomarker is based on the understanding of tumour biology and the tumour microenvironment or the metabolism of the pharmaceutical agent. With the advent of novel technologies, the research on the identification of suitable biomarker for specific cancers is going on at a fast pace. However, there are several processes involved in identifying a potential biomarker before it is clinically applicable. Initially, a set of samples are analysed to test the potential of the novel biomarker. To validate the hypothesis, a sequence of experiments substantiating the importance of the biomarker needs to be performed. This will assist to establish the clinical use of these biomarkers and further investigations on analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility (Teutsch et al. 2010) should be assessed to finally authenticate its use as a biomarker. Analytical validity is the verification of both the pre-analytical and analytical issues of the assay to approve the novel biomarker. This involves exploring the technical aspects of the biomarker assay that should meet certain criteria. Furthermore, it is critical to analyse sensitivity, specificity, the robustness of assay, accuracy and reproducibility in laboratories (Moore\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n15\n\net al. 2013). If a technically valid assay has been developed, then it should undergo clinical validity testing to assess if it has any clinical or biological validity before recommending the biomarker directly for clinical care (Ransohoff and Gourlay 2010). Clinical utility is the final step before introducing the biomarker to patient care. This assessment includes confirming the effectiveness of biomarker and the benefit to harm ratio etc., (Allegra et al. 2009). The final process will be the clinical implementation with regulatory committee approval, commercialization, health insurance coverage and incorporation to practice guidelines (Goossens et al. 2015). Some of the different types of biomarkers available are:\n\nPrognostic Biomarkers It is based on the clinical or biological attributes, which provides information on the probability of OSCC outcomes such as disease progression, metastasis, recurrence, duration of life without regard to the treatment taken. Biomarkers generally have a degree of prognostic value equivalent to their predictive role and therefore there are chances that one gets dominated by the other. The prognostic biomarker which gets wrongly labelled as predictive may have deteriorative effects and may end up misinterpreting the benefits of the treatment. Correspondingly, the price of the drug will shoot up as the demand increases although it is not ideal for all patients (Ruberg and Shen 2015). The prognostic biomarkers in OSCC include Matrix Metallo Protease2 (MMP2), Matrix Metallo Protease1 (MMP1), Cadherin-1, mucin-1, p53, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) etc., (Trivedi et al. 2011; G. Z. Huang et al. 2019; Wei et al. 2020; Jiang et al. 2015; Rivera et al. 2017).\n\nPredictive Biomarkers The predictive biomarker is a boon to the patient which aids in controlling the disease before it progresses. Assessing the risk of developing\n\n16\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\nmalignancy in a person can be determined by identifying the risk reduction strategies (lifestyle, prophylactic surgery, chemoprevention etc.,) or by more effective screening. This method is highly beneficial to patients who belong to the high-risk category than to the whole population. Thus, prognostic biomarkers help in determining the risk of developing OSCC by analysing the lifestyle, HPV status, genetic and epigenetic alterations. Ballman et al., 2015 revealed that there exists certain ambiguity on the distinction between predictive biomarkers and prognostic biomarkers (Ballman 2015). The utilisation of biomarkers in OSCC treatment imparts a prognostic signal that could have an impact on personal, financial and ethical issues. The predictive biomarkers discovery has led to the observation that there is a lack of attention in in-silico studies (X. Su et al. 2008). The articles on subgroup discovery comprehend predictive biomarkers as an intermediate step in cancer prediction along with Interaction Trees (X. Su et al. 2008), SIDES (Lipkovich et al. 2011) and Virtual Twins (Foster, Taylor, and Ruberg 2011). A novel bioinformatics tool termed INFO+ developed by Konstantinos Sechidis et al., 2018 which can distinguish between the prognostic and predictive role of the biomarkers is advantageous in this regard (Sechidis et al. 2018).\n\nDiagnostic Biomarkers The biomarkers which are used for screening OSCC by distinguishing the various possibilities for differential diagnosis sometimes are referred to as detective biomarkers. For example, if a patient has oral lesions, then the patient will be advised to provide biopsy specimens for histological evaluation that can determine whether the tissue is cancerous, has infection, inflammation or any other benign process. Further, immunohistochemistry is performed also to identify the tissue of origin once the cancerous condition is confirmed (Lauritano et al. 2016), (Henry and Hayes 2012).\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n17\n\nIn addition, there are several studies to identify diagnostic biomarkers through different types of approaches including proteomics studies (Z. Yang et al. 2019), (R. Wang et al. 2018; Chu et al. 2019; Tung et al. 2013; Lai et al. 2010).\n\nPharmacodynamic Biomarkers The biomolecules which indicate the effect of the drug on a target organism by evaluating the link between drug regimens, target effects and tumour responses are referred to as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. These help in drug development by measuring the molecular target status, pharmacokinetic parameters of drug exposure, pharmacodynamics endpoint of drug effects on targeted cells, pathway implications, assessment of downstream targets in the pathway, affected biological processes etc., and coupling novel drugs, combining targeted agents and optimizing schedules for combinational drug therapeutics. These biomarkers specifically play a crucial role in delivering targeted treatments by validating clinical pharmacodynamics biomarker assays in drug development. Major two programs where such biomarkers are intertwined include cancer imaging program and clinical assay laboratory which produce a robust and accurate measurement of drug effects in each patient thus supporting in NEXT drug development projects (Sarker and Workman 2006; Jackson 2012; Gainor, Longo, and Chabner 2014; “No Title,” n.d.).\n\nRisk Assessment Biomarkers With the increase in the cost of healthcare and new targeted therapies, the use of biomarkers has emanated as a method for assessing the risk of OSCC occurrence and recurrence. There are few bioinformatics tools available to predict cancer risk management and using molecular biomarkers with these tools enables to optimize the available resources to control cancer\n\n18\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\nprogression by assessing the risk associated with the particular tumour stage and predicting the disease development (X. Li et al. 2011), (Preston 2006).\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF OSCC BIOMARKERS The broad classification of biomarkers according to the OSCC stages, type of biomolecules and its applications as listed in Table 1.

Microsatellites are highly polymorphic, short tandem repeat sequence of 2-6 base pairs in length existing throughout the genome. Microsatellite Instability (MSI) is a type of gene mutation where replication errors and dysfunction of mismatch repair leads to DNA sequence alterations (Yamamoto and Imai 2015). A study reported of higher incidence of MSI at D2S123 loci in patients with OSCC and they suggested that MSI could act as a diagnostic indicator (Panda et al. 2015). Some other studies also reported a similar conclusion that patients with MSI have a higher probability of OSCC recurrence (J. C. Lin et al. 2016). Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) is a mechanism of tumour-suppressor gene inactivation by which the loss of a wild type allele of a chromosome changes a heterozygous somatic cell into a hemizygous cell (Happle 1999). It has been reported that the frequency of LOH is much more than MSI of upto 80% especially on chromosome arms 3p, 4q, 7q, 8q, 9p, 11q, 13q and 17p. These regions display abundance of tumour suppressor regions such as Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 2 (TGFBR2) and Contactin 4 (CNTN4) on Chr. 3p and Lysine Demethylase 4C (KDM4C), Interleukin33 (IL33), Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type D (PTPRD), SH3 Domain Containing GRB2 Like 2, Endophilin A1 (SH3GL2), FRAS1 Related Extracellular Matrix 1 (FREM1) on Chr. 9p, or neighbouring Tumour suppressor genes (TSG) regions such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16/CDKN2) gene cluster, Tumor Suppressor Candidate 1 (TUSC1) and Doublesex And Mab-3 Related Transcription Factor 2 (DMRT2) (Chen et al. 2015). Some literature states that LOH can be considered as a biomarker for identifying invasive OSCC (Rao et al. 2018; Numasawa et al. 2005; Kayahara et al. 2001). Another interesting feature of OSCC is that the oral and maxillofacial regions in the human body is rich in blood supply and because of the physical stimulation of external\n\n20\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\nimmense pressure created, the oral cancer regions will deliver genetic material into blood circulation in the form of either tumour cells or microvesicles. The circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) has the similar genetic feature as that of the tumour. Thus, the presence of ctDNA is used to diagnose the tumour which reduces the need of tissue biopsy. Its presence in the saliva is considered as one of the non-invasive liquid biopsy done on cancer samples (Bettegowda C, Sausen M, Leary RJ, Kinde I, Wang Y, Agrawal N, Bartlett BR, Wang H, Luber B, Alani RM, n.d.), (Babji et al. 2019). Saliva contains copious components such as cellular debris, microorganisms, inorganic and organic molecules (Chiappin et al. 2007). Biomarkers are detectable more in saliva than in serum or plasma (Yuxuan Wang et al. 2015). Saliva also contains tumour-derived DNA secreted by exosomes or microvesicles (Principe et al. 2013).\n\nSINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are defined as variations in a genetic sequence that affects only a single base in that sequence and is present in >1% of the population. SNPs are present throughout the entire human genome and is responsible for almost 90% of genetic variations that occurs in humans. Even though the majority of SNPs do not have any effect on normal cellular functions, some SNPs are involved in the development of various diseases including cancer. Such SNPs are usually present in genes that are involved in cell cycle regulation, cell metabolism, signalling pathways and DNA repair, thus interfering with normal cell function (Gayther et al. 2007; Grochola et al. 2010; J. Liu et al. 2014). Several studies have confirmed that certain SNPs have been associated with a higher risk of cancers including OSCC.\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n21\n\nTable 2.

G. Yao et al. 2008; N. Li et al. 2015; Chien et al. 2012), apoptosis genes (C. J. Weng et al. 2012; Yun Wang et al. 2015) and DNA repair genes (Jha et al. 2013). Identifying such SNPs will be useful in the development of biomarkers with diagnostic or prognostic values. Some of them are listed in Table 2.\n\nCHROMOSOMAL REARRANGEMENTS Chromosomal rearrangements have been well described in OSCC (Papanikolaou et al. 2018; Németh et al. 2019; Martin et al. 2008). Such chromosomal aberrations have been studied using low-resolution methods including Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH), spectral karyotyping and cytogenetic techniques. Now, using next-generation sequencing (NGS), the detection of chromosomal rearrangements can be performed in a faster and more efficient way. Chromosomal rearrangements that are specific to tumour tissues have the potential to be used as biomarkers for cancer detection. Such biomarkers would be useful for monitoring cancer progression, understanding tumour response to cancer therapies, detecting cancer recurrences and for long term patient management as well.\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n23\n\nOne type of chromosomal rearrangements includes recurrent gene fusions that are repeatedly observed in a specific type of tumour. Initially, recurrent gene fusions were only observed in hematologic malignancies, but recently recurrent gene fusions have also been observed in solid cancers. In a study conducted by Pan T et al., 2020, they have identified around 11 fused genes in OSCC, in which one of them is involved in OSCC progression. They found that the gene fusion Tripartite Motif Containing 52 - Receptor For Activated C Kinase 1 (TRIM52-RACK1) was caused by a deletion of 181,257,187-181,247,386 at 5q35.3 and it induces OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion (Pan et al. 2020). Some other similar studies also have detected gene fusions in OSCC which facilitates carcinogenesis and aggressiveness (Guo et al. 2016), (N. Singh et al. 2020). In addition, gene fusions are also reported in other types of cancers such as in prostate cancer, where a serine protease gene, androgen-regulated trans-membrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) was found to be fused with either Erythroblast Transformation Specific related gene (ERG) or ETS Variant Transcription Factor 1 (ETV1), which are members of the ETS family of oncogenes (Narod, Seth, and Nam 2008). Tomlins et al., 2005 reported that out of the 29 prostate cancer samples that were studied, 23 contained TMPRSS2-ERG or TMPRSS2-ETV1 fusion (Tomlins et al. 2005). In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), a gene fusion between Basal Cell Adhesion Molecule (BCAM) which is a membrane adhesion molecule, and AKT Serine/Threonine Kinase 2 (AKT2), a key kinase in the PI3K signalling pathway was also observed. In non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) patients, echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusions have been observed (Koivunen et al. 2008). Classifying the subtypes of cancer based on these recurrent gene fusions can also aid in the treatment of the disease. For example, in NSCLC patients, who have the EML4-ALK fusion gene, ALK inhibitor alone or in combination with other kinase inhibitors could be used as an effective treatment (Koivunen et al. 2008). Deletion is another chromosomal rearrangement that has been shown to play a major role in the development and progression of cancer where deletion of chromosomal regions may lead to the loss of certain tumour\n\n24\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\nsuppressor genes. Identifying these deletions may have remarkable significance in determining disease outcomes such as lymph node metastasis. These molecular classifications may also help in the early prediction of the disease or treatments such as personalised medicine. Deletions of a region in a chromosome or of a particular gene has been reported in several cancers. In a study conducted by Sukhija H et al., 2015 it has been revealed that out of 20 OSCC patient samples collected, each sample has a C- deletion mutation in exon 4 codon 63 of the p53 gene (Sukhija et al. 2015). The deletion of the gene GSTT1 which codes for Glutathione S-transferase Theta-1 enzyme has been observed to promote the risk of OSCC development (Neves Drummond et al. 2005). In addition, the deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a tumour suppressor gene was seen in 68% of samples of prostate cancer patients (Yoshimoto et al. 2006). In a study done on 38 NSCLC patients, two genes Hyaluronidase2 (HYAL2) and Fragile Histidine Triad Protein (FHIT) were observed to be deleted in 84% and 79% tumours respectively. It was also reported that 54% of patients who had HYAL2 deletions in tumour tissues also showed such deletions in their sputum and 50% of patients with FHIT deletions in tumours had the same deletion in their sputum. Therefore, HYAL2 and FHIT deletions in sputum may be used as diagnostic biomarkers for early-stage lung cancers (Vincent-Chong et al. 2017) In OSCC, deletions in 3p and 8p chromosomal regions, specifically at 3p21.31, 3p26.3-p26.1 and 8p23.2 were observed to be recurrent (Vincent-Chong et al. 2017). The genetic alteration in OSCC by combining array-based comparative genomic hybridization and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification technique was best studied by Cha et al., 2011. This study revealed that many of the genes such as Family with Sequence Similarity 5, Member B (FAM5B), Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible poly (ADPribose) polymerase (TiPARP), Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha (PIK3CA), Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1), Fibroblast Growth Factor 10 (FGF10), Histone Deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), Glutamate Metabotropic Receptor 3 (GRM3), Development And Differentiation Enhancing Factor 1 (DDEF1), Endothelin Receptor Type B (EDNRB), Chordin Like 1 (CHRDL1), and 5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n25\n\n2C (HTR2C) are amplified and genes such as Thyroid Hormone Receptor Associated Protein 3 (THRAP3), Cortactin Binding Protein 2 N-terminallike Protein (CTTNBP2NL), GATA Zinc Finger Domain Containing 2B (GATAD2B), REL, Cytoskeleton Associated Protein 2 Like (CKAP2L), Ras Homolog Family Member A (RHOA), Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4E Family Member 3 (EIF4E3), PDZ And LIM Domain 5 (PDLIM5), F-Box Protein 3 (FBXO3), Neuronal Differentiation 4 (NEUROD4), and ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily A Member 5 (ABCA5) are deleted during the progression of OSCC (Cha, Kim, and Cha 2011). Detection of these chromosomal rearrangements is of utmost importance as they play an important role as biomarkers. Fluorescence in situ hybridization which has been used as the gold standard for detecting structural chromosomal rearrangements has been shown to have a limited resolution and often needs to be substantiated by some other method or cytogenetic technique to increase resolution and provide accurate results. Mate pair whole genome sequencing (MP-WGS) is a technique that has been used to accompany karyotype analysis to detect structural chromosomal rearrangements. When MP-WGS was used to sequence ten bone marrow samples from leukaemia patients with recurrent rearrangements, all the rearrangements that were identified by FISH were successfully detected. MP-WGS also revealed additional rearrangements that were missed out by previous cytogenetic analysis. Coordinates for all detected rearrangement breakpoints were also identifiable using MP-WGS (Tran et al. 2018). When used for the characterisation of multiple myeloma, MP-WGS was observed to be a better method in identifying chromosomal rearrangements. Out of the 30 discordance cases between FISH analysis and MP-WGS, FISH analysis missed abnormalities in 19 cases which were identifiable using MPWGS (Smadbeck et al. 2019).\n\nEPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS AS BIOMARKERS Epigenetic changes refer to modifications that lead to the dysregulation of gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Without changing\n\n26\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\nthe DNA sequence, these modifications are capable of turning genes “on” and “off” thus affecting their expression pattern. Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through two mechanisms: 1) via modifications on histone proteins that affect the tertiary structure of DNA, thus interfering with DNA-protein interactions, or 2) By directly causing modifications on the DNA strand itself Modifications such as DNA methylation or histone acetylation/ methylations have been shown to cause changes in the process of chromatin condensation, thus affecting how transcription factors bind to promoter regions. Both DNA methylation and histone modifications are responsible for the altered gene expression that is observed in many human diseases including cancer. Changes in DNA methylation observed in cancer has been an indication that it could be used as a target for developing biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic and predictive purposes. Changes in DNA methylation patterns have been described in numerous cancers and it has been observed that these modifications are considered to be among the earliest aberrations that occur during carcinogenesis. The usage of several methylated genes as tumour biomarkers have been proposed for various cancers including breast (Obaidul et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2010; Kloten et al. 2013), lung (Vinayanuwattikun et al. 2011; Balgkouranidou et al. 2016; Powrózek et al. 2016), prostate (Payne et al. 2009; T. Wu et al. 2011; Haldrup et al. 2018) and gastric cancer (J. Nakamura et al. 2014; d’Errico et al. 2020; C. Li et al. 2020). In OSCC studies, promoter methylation of cell adhesion genes (Hsiao Wen Chang et al. 2002; Q. Chen et al. 2004; Mishra et al. 2018), cell-cycle control genes (Viswanathan, Tsuchida, and Shanmugam 2003; Strzelczyk, Krakowczyk, and Owczarek 2018; Allameh et al. 2019), apoptosis-related genes (Y. K. Wong, Lee, and Liu 2011; Y. Liu et al. 2012) and DNA-repair genes (Jayaprakash et al. 2017; Taioli et al. 2009; González-Ramírez et al. 2011; Czerninski et al. 2009) have been reported. Obtaining samples of plasma, serum, saliva and urine for the detection and analysis of these DNA methylation changes can be done in non-invasive or minimally invasive\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n27\n\nmethods via liquid biopsies. Due to advancements in technology, currently there are numerous methods for identifying and measuring DNA methylation (Tost 2018). Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) has been the most commonly adopted technique for determining promoter methylation levels in many cancer-related studies. MS-PCR is the preferred method as it provides rapid detection of the methylation status of the CpG islands, requires minute amounts of DNA, has high detection sensitivity and can be used for detecting methylation in different samples such as biofluids and even paraffin-embedded samples (Ramalho-Carvalho, Henrique, and Jerónimo 2018). The first part of this method is known as sodium bisulfite conversion, where unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracil and methylated cytosines remain unchanged. The converted sequence is then used as a template for PCR where primers and probes specific for the methylated and unmethylated sequences are used for quantitative analysis (Ramalho-Carvalho, Henrique, and Jerónimo 2018). In eukaryotes, DNA in the nucleus is associated with certain proteins known as histone proteins forming a highly condense and a compact structure called chromatin. Histone methylation and acetylation/ deacetylation are factors that have been known to alter the structure of chromatin, thus influencing its function. Histone acetylation is usually associated with transcriptionally active genes, whereas the effect of methylation mainly depends on the number of methyl groups, the residue itself and its location within the histone tails. The enzymes involved in the processes of histone modifications include histone acetyltransferases (HATs), histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and histone demethylases (HDMs). Numerous studies have reported that histone modifications can be used for the prognosis of cancer. Association between histone modification patterns and cancer detection, prognosis, recurrence and patient survival have been well explored in several cancers including lung (J. S. Song et al. 2012), prostate (Ellinger et al. 2010), breast (Elsheikh et al. 2009), leukaemia (Müller-Tidow et al. 2010) and oesophagal (Tzao et al. 2009) cancers. Immunohistochemistry has been the method that has been used in most studies to detect histone marks in tissue samples. The altered activity of HDACs has also been associated with the progression of\n\n28\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\nseveral human cancers including lung (Osada et al. 2004; Sasaki et al. 2004), gastric (Weichert, Röske, Niesporek, et al. 2008; Weichert, Röske, Gekeler, et al. 2008) and prostate (Abbas and Gupta, n.d.) cancers. Several papers have also discussed the dysregulation of specific HDACs in OSCC. The overexpression of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) (H. H. Chang et al. 2009) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) was observed in both OSCC cell lines and OSCC tissue samples as compared to normal oral keratinocytes and normal oral tissues. Significant differences in expression levels between the early stages and late stages of cancer also seems to suggest an association between HDAC6 expression levels and the clinical tumour stages, and overexpression of HDAC6 is observed in the later stages of OSCC (Sakuma et al. 2006). With further research into understanding how the dysregulation of these HDACs can be used as potential biomarkers for cancer and OSCC, new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers could be developed.\n\nRNA AS BIOMARKERS The potential use of RNAs as biomarkers for various cancers have been well explored and described in a multitude of papers (B. Yang et al. 2016; Hamam et al. 2017; S. wei Huang et al. 2018; G. Li et al. 2019; H. Liu et al. 2019). Information such as cellular stages and regulatory processes which cannot be obtained using DNA biomarkers can be obtained using RNA biomarkers. The variation in RNA copy numbers has also been shown to be a useful diagnostic tool to determine if a particular gene is being up or downregulated. The high sensitivity and specificity of RNA biomarkers allow even small traces of RNA to be amplified and captured using PCR. Using RNA biomarkers is also a cheaper alternative to protein biomarkers as detection of each protein requires a specific antibody. RNA dysregulation, specifically microRNAs (miRNA) dysregulation has been observed in different diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases (Akodad, Mericskay, and Roubille 2016; S. S. Zhou et al. 2018) and neurodegenerative diseases (Juźwik et al. 2019; Catanesi et al. 2020). There have been a multitude of papers that have described the alteration in miRNA\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n29\n\nexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma (C. Peng et al. 2019), breast (Kashyap and Kaur 2020), lung (C. Hu et al. 2020), gastric (Stojanovic et al. 2019) and prostate (C. J. Song et al. 2018) cancers. In addition to identifying tissue-based RNA biomarkers for diagnosis, there has been a great interest in identifying extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) as biomarkers due to the promising potential of developing a non-invasive diagnostic tool. ExRNAs are RNA molecules that are present outside the cells in which they were transcribed and can be found in biofluids such as whole blood, plasma, serum, urine, breast milk, saliva and cerebrospinal fluid. They are the signalling molecules that play a role in cell-cell communications (Dinger, Mercer, and Mattick 2008; Valadi et al. 2007) and are released by both normal cells and tumour cells but the differential expression of RNA from tumour cells can be of significant clinical relevance (Schwarzenbach et al. 2014). These exRNAs can be beneficial for the diagnosis and classification of cancers, especially when it might be difficult to obtain tumour tissues. The easiest method of obtaining exRNAs are through liquid biopsies which is a process of collecting body fluids to obtain diagnostic or prognostic information. Blood and saliva being the two most accessible biofluids are the most widely studied for determining and developing biomarkers. miRNAs are the most widely studied mRNAs which showed promising results as cancer biomarkers. miRNAs are small, single-stranded, noncoding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides. They play a role in regulating the expression pattern of coding genes by interacting with their complementary sequences usually present in the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of their target mRNAs.(Lewis et al. 2003) As miRNAs are involved in cell-cell communications, it has been established that miRNAs are expressed in a cell-specific manner, meaning that any regulatory changes or disease status in a cell will change the expression of miRNAs (Williams 2008) and due to their high tissue specificity, miRNAs are effective biomarkers for determining the tissue of origin in cancers (Rosenfeld et al. 2008). Due to their small size, as compared to mRNAs, miRNAs are more stable allowing for easier expression profiling from biological materials and thus promoting their use as non-invasive biomarkers. Some miRNAs are\n\n30\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\nupregulated, implicating their role as oncogenes whereas some miRNAs have been reported to be downregulated thus demonstrating tumour suppressive roles in OSCC tumorigenesis. Some reports have shown that dysregulated miRNA levels return to relatively normal levels after tumour resection and treatments such as chemotherapy. Sun et al., reported that the high levels of serum miR-155 in breast cancer patients are significantly reduced, reaching levels comparable to those of the controls, after tumour resection and chemotherapy. This trend of declined serum miRNA levels in post-operative samples were also observed in lung carcinoma (Le et al. 2012), renal cell carcinoma (X. Chen et al. 2018), colorectal cancer (Y. Zhao, Ren, and Zhu 2018) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (Romani et al. 2021). These studies provide evidences of the correlation between serum and salivary miRNA levels and tumour dynamics. The development of miRNA biomarker panels for OSCC diagnosis has also been studied by few groups. Biomarker panels have been shown to demonstrate a higher diagnostic power as compared to a single miRNA. Nakamura et al., 2021 concluded that a combination of 6 differently expressed miRNAs, namely, miR-24, miR-20a, miR-122, miR-150, miR-4419a and miR-5100 were capable of diagnosing OSCC by significantly distinguishing the expression between OSCC samples and healthy controls with a high degree of accuracy (K. Nakamura et al. 2021). Another group studied a cohort of two hundred and fifty Taiwanese patients and identified 3 plasma miRNAs for the detection of OSCC. The miRNA panel consisting of miR-222-3p, miR-150-5p and miR-423-5p were shown to be effective for early detection of OSCC (Y. A. Chang et al. 2018). Analysing mRNA expression levels is one of the easiest ways to study gene expression, and therefore, there have been many studies that have reported the prospective mRNA biomarkers that can be used for cancer detection, diagnosis and prognosis. As many genes are dysregulated in cancer, a multitude of papers have described the various mRNAs that are involved in different cancers. Studies have shown that circulating cell-free mRNA present in biofluids such as blood and saliva can be used as tumour markers. The diagnostic and prognostic value of such mRNAs have been tested in several cancers including gastric cancer (TANI et al. 2007; C. Su\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n31\n\net al. 2019), breast cancer (Yanlin Wu et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2019), lung cancer (S. Karimi et al. 2015) and OSCC (Elashoff et al. 2006; Márton et al. 2019; St. John et al. 2004; Hsueh Wei Chang et al. 2018; Oh et al. 2020). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a group of non-coding RNAs which have a covalently closed circular structure with transcript lengths of hundreds to thousands of nucleotides. Due to their circular structure, circRNAs have an increased resistance to digestion by exonucleases and therefore gets accumulated in tissues and body fluids. The expression of circRNAs is tissue-specific and recent studies have reported that circRNAs are also differentially expressed in several human tumours. The potential of using circRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer as well as for monitoring treatment response have been studied. Studies showing the promising use of circRNAs as biomarkers have been demonstrated in gastric cancer (P. Li et al. 2015; Shao et al. 2017), lung cancer (J. T. Yao et al. 2017; Tan et al. 2018), colorectal cancer (W. Weng et al. 2017; J. Lin et al. 2019) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Yu et al. 2016; L. Fu et al. 2017). The upregulation of hsa_circ_0001874, hsa_circ_0001971 and hsa_circ_0008068 and the downregulation of hsa_circ_0000140, hsa_circ_0002632 and hsa_circ_0008792 in saliva has been observed in OSCC patients (S.-Y. Zhao et al. 2018). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of RNAs that have transcripts ranging from 200 nucleotides to 100 kb. When first identified, lncRNAs were initially thought to be a by-product of transcription with practically no or very little function. However, subsequent studies revealed the possible role that lncRNAs play in various cellular processes including cell growth, cell differentiation, cell fate determination and even apoptosis (W. Hu, Alvarez‐Dominguez, and Lodish 2012; Flynn and Chang 2014; Rossi and Antonangeli 2014). The dysregulation of lncRNAs has also been observed in cancers and studies have revealed how lncRNAs play a role in regulating cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration (B. Liu et al. 2016; Qian et al. 2017; Z. Y. Yang et al. 2017).\n\n32\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\nTable 3.

Wang et al. 2017), gastric cancer (Pang et al. 2014; Shao et al. 2014), hepatocellular carcinoma (J. Tang et al. 2015; T. Zhou and Gao 2016) and colorectal cancer (Ge et al. 2013; Svoboda et al. 2014). In OSCC, HOX Antisense Intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1 (NEAT-1), Highly Up‐Regulated In Liver Cancer (HULC) and Urothelial Cancer Associated 1 (UCA1) are some of the lncRNAs that have been reported to be upregulated (H. Tang et al. 2013; Yansheng Wu et al. 2015). One of the main advantages of lncRNAs that make them suitable for usage of biomarkers is their high stability and resistance to ribonucleases when present in body fluids. Additionally, the lncRNA deregulation observed in primary tumour tissues have been shown to be the same in body fluids including blood, plasma, serum, saliva and urine. These characteristics of lncRNAs provide a promising opportunity for developing beneficial and minimally invasive biomarkers for cancer. The different types of RNA biomarkers implicated in OSCC is shown in Table 3.\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n37\n\nPROTEOMIC BIOMARKERS As the development and progression of cancer are driven by changes in the dysregulation of a variety of genes that are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and death, it is evident that there must be changes in the expression levels of numerous proteins as well. These changes in protein expression levels might lead to changes in cell growth, metabolism and even affect cell signalling. It has been shown that certain tumour-specific proteins produced by cancer cells may enter the patient’s circulation and these proteins can act as diagnostic or prognostic cancer biomarkers (Tung et al. 2013; Núñez 2019; El-Khoury et al. 2020). Protein-based biomarkers have been identified in several cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (Waidely et al. 2016), lung cancer (Zamay et al. 2017), colorectal cancer (Wilhelmsen et al. 2017), pancreatic cancer (Cohen et al. 2017) and OSCC. In a study done on 48 OSCC patients and 48 controls, five candidate biomarkers, Human Mac-2 binding protein (M2BP), Migration inhibitory factor-related protein 14 (MRP14), CD59, catalase and profilin were observed to be differently expressed in saliva with the potential of being OSCC biomarkers (S. Hu et al. 2008). In another study, five other proteins in saliva, Complement Factor B (CFB), Complement C3 (C3), Complement C4B (C4B), serine protease inhibitor Family A Member 1 (SERPINA1) and Leucine-Rich Alpha-2-Glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) were shown to be candidate biomarkers for OSCC (Kawahara et al. 2016). Serum-based proteomic biomarkers have also been studied and identified in OSCC (Bijian et al. 2009; Y. Yang et al. 2014). Chai et al., 2016 reported that four serum protein biomarkers, namely, gelsolin, fibronectin, angiotensinogen and haptoglobin were shown to be differentially expressed between node-positive and nodenegative cancer cell lines, indicating that identification of the biomarkers could be used for the prediction of metastasis in OSCC (Chai et al. 2016). Proteomic based identification of tumour biomarkers can be done using several techniques such as 2D gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LCMS) and more recently, matrix assist laser desorption ionization (MALDI)‐based imaging of tissues (Maruvada et al. 2005).\n\n38\n\nBhuvanadas Sreeshma, Diveyaa Sivakumar, Dibyo Maiti et al.\n\nMETABOLOMIC BIOMARKERS Metabolomic biomarkers in OSCC include carbohydrates, enzymes, metabolites and liquid biomarkers. During OSCC progression, the alterations in the expression of O-linked and N-linked glycans occur. These altered carbohydrate markers can be used as an influential biomarkers for OSCC detection. These markers from human samples such as serum, cancer cell lines or tissues obtained from biopsies are profiled using MALDI-TOF, Electrospray Ionization (ESI) etc., The most frequently used techniques to analyze metabolomic biomarkers in cancer are by Mass-Spectrometry (MS), Liquid Chromatography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, enzyme assays etc., (Arglebe 1981). The glycomarkers such as glycoproteins, proteoglycans, glycolipids are more stable than RNA and proteins. These markers are reported to be ideal for cancer prediction studies where screening of samples for the probability of carcinogenesis in the future can be analysed. It is reported that in many types of cancers, there are modifications in the glycomarkers as cancer progresses and these can be used to identify carcinogenesis (Saldova et al. 2008; Powlesland et al. 2009; Misonou et al. 2009; Abbott et al. 2008).\n\nCHALLENGES IN OSCC BIOMARKER DEVELOPMENT Few challenges faced by researchers in developing clinical cancer biomarkers are (i) the preparation of the sample is non-uniform, (ii) the difficulty in the storage of the sample, (iii) some techniques gives enormous data which makes it difficult to analyze, and (iv) cancer tissues comprise of disorganized cells as a result of mutations and all these limitations are challenges associated with biomarker development. In malignant conditions, the inherited genetic instability could pave the way to the new tumour cell subpopulation which can expand quickly as the growth potential increases (Vadas et al. 2008). During OSCC progression, the emergence of new clones with genetic and epigenetic alterations occurs, termed as “clonal diversity,”\n\nBiomarkers in the Progression and Metastasis …\n\n39\n\nwhich happens as a result of mutations and structural alterations. The clonal diversity along with genetic, epigenetic, heterogeneous nature of cells, histological aberrations increases with ageing that additionally complicates the detection of OSCC. As a result, many biomarkers may not even express during the detection process. Other problems are because of the overdetection, non-specific binding and over-treatment strategies of biomarkers resulting in misinterpretation of cancers including OSCC.\n\nCONCLUSION To reduce the impediments associated with the use of biomarkers based detection of OSCC, it is crucial to understand the types, steps and protocol of application of the biomarkers to evaluate the appropriate biomarkers according to the types and stages of the tumour. Further research should focus on developing new biomarkers for a heterogeneous population of cancer cells and its host-immune response. Distinct studies should be conducted on the diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Accordingly, the mechanism of OSCC oncogenesis has to be studied in detail for the identification of a reliable gene that could be used as a biomarker to predict the possibilities of OSCC occurrence and to prevent the advancement of OSCC. To reduce the patient mortality and morbidity rate of OSCC, it is highly suggested to develop valid clinical candidate markers with high clinical utility and screening efficacy.\n\nREFERENCES Abbas, Ata, and Sanjay Gupta. n.d. “The Role of Histone Deacetylases in Prostate Cancer.” Epigenetics 3 (6): 300–309. https://doi.org/10.4161/ epi.3.6.7273.
