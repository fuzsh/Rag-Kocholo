        "text": "The aim of this paper is to determine if the standardization strategies, widely implemented by the luxury companies in international markets, can successfully adopted in the Chinese Markets. In order to verify this statement we analyse the luxury cosmetics industry in a market characterized by evident cultural differences. The cultural differences have been studied in term of beauty ideals and consumers behavior and expectations. We study four western luxury cosmetics companies. Although the first moves were mainly shaped on replication and standardization, the cultural differences force the four western companies to transform their orientation towards adaptation. This finding was partially unexpected and suggests that for specific type of luxury products the adaptation and flexibility are required despite the drift to replicate the standardized marketing strategies. These results are consistent with those of other studies suggesting the need for a balanced approach of standardization and adaptation in managing the international strategies.\n\nThis paper investigates the impact that seven marketing activities namely event sponsorship, celebrity endorsements, advertising, distribution exclusivity, store atmospherics, brand websites and brand’s social media have on the brand equity of Haute Couture Brands. Globalization, high disposable income, economic prosperity and an increasing demand for luxury labels has contributed to the flourishing demand for Haute Couture Designer labels. The fashion calendar in India is full of Luxury and Haute Couture events throughout the year, thereby providing exhaustive purchase options for the affluent Indian consumer and exacerbating the market competition. This study attempts to assess the consumer based brand equity of Haute Couture Labels and apprehend their salience in the domestic market\n\nAltruism can be useful in understanding consumer purchase motivations, especially those related to the purchase of a domestic product where ‘buy national’ motives may be present. In this paper the dimensions of altruism, their antecedents, and the relationships between them are identified based on a survey of 212 consumers. The findings indicate that a total of eight altruism dimensions exist and interact in a manner that reflect two distinct factors of personal and purchasing altruism.\n\nThe basic aim of the proposed research is to unveil which Brand Experience dimensions are the most effective in terms of Brand Loyaltyin various Consumer Confidence levels.Ou et al.(2013) recently suggested moderation analysis in branding literature as the best methodology to explore the most effectiveCustomer Equity Drivers(CEDs) in terms of Brand Loyalty case sensitive to CC. The aforementioned researchers concluded that businesses should segment potential or existing customers and implement the most effective strategies depending on their CC status. Thus, the moderation effect of consumer confidence in the relationship between Brand Experience and Brand Loyalty will be explored for the first time. A “positivism” research philosophy will be used in combination with quantitative data collection method. Overall, more than 2000 adult consumers are planned to participate in a survey through a face to face handing over. The aforementioned survey is planned to cover both service and product brands in Greece. The data collected will be analyzed by using SPSS AMOS application. Structural Equitation Modeling (SEM) will be the core quantitative methodology in order to validate a reliable and consistent research model. Although there is a great deal of academic research exploring the relationship between Brand Experience and Brand Loyalty (Brakus et al., 2009; Lee and Kang, 2012; Ding et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2015), the implications of CC are still unchartered. Thus, the proposed paper will provide marketing practitioners and academics with enough piece of evidence needed to adjust brand experience practices depending on CC. In the proposed research model Demographics and Brand Involvement will be further used as controlling variables.\n\nAs a result of digital technology revolution and massive growth of smart phone usage, over 66% of world’s population (4.92 billion) is using mobile phones and over half of them are using social media. Mobile social networking (MSN) becomes one of the key communication tool, new trend, necessity and lifestyle. With information transparency, consumer value changes quickly, whilst rapid adaptation of similar offerings in the market place, it is essential for suppliers to keep pace with consumer value changes those directly affect the consumer satisfaction and loyalty. The research applies academic models and frameworks to the real life situation to develop a value proposition in the practical world by considering WeChat (1 billion active users) as the company under study and comparing it with WhatsApp (1.5 billion active users) as the leading competitor in the market. The objectives include identification of customers’ perception of a value for mobile social networking (MSN) services, followed by critical evaluation of existing value proposition of WeChat with Whatsapp to identify gap and finally to propose a new value proposition for WeChat. This paper first identifies customer perceived value (CPV) of mobile social networking (MSN) apps using Overby and Lee’s model (2004) followed by critical review of existing value proposition of WeChat and then comparing and contrasting with the leading player WhatsApp. Frameworks developed by Piercy (2009), Anderson J. et al. (2006) are employed for the same. Finally, the case develops new value proposition for WeChat by using Osterwalder et al 2014 and other frameworks. By the end of this research, a new consumer value proposition (CVP) proposal for WeChat is proposed for consideration in matching with the globally evaluated consumers’ value criteria\n\nWe looked through all the latest technology that could be used in conjunction with your smartphone, something that could really get shoppers engaged and interested in the experience and we found that in Gimbal, a software platform that can help shape our users shopping patterns through using the technology in their phone best suited our needs. Using this technology, the smartphone will be used as a tool to gain a privacy enhanced peek into user’s interests, habits and personality, therefore our application will slowly get to know the user and recommend items thorough push messages that users may have a need for."
