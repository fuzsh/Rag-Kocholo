        "text": "With the increasing demand and more consumption of cement in construction and improper waste management, researchers are always in search of different cement replacing materials. Due to the vast production of sugar cane in India, huge amount of sugarcane bagasse is being produced and which is a waste product coming out of sugar industries. Sugarcane bagasse ash is a byproduct of sugar factories found after burning sugarcane bagasse. Sugarcane bagasse is a fibrous waste product of sugar refining industry along with ethanol vapor. The utilization of industrial and agricultural waste produced by industrial process has been focus to waste reduction. The present study has been focused on assessing performance of SCBA concrete in different curing environments by the partial replacement of ordinary Portland cement with different weight percentages of SCBA (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%). The tests were conducted on cubes and cylinders and prisms at various ages of concrete i.e., 7, 28 and 56 days to assess the strength aspects of SCBA concrete. From the present study it is evident that, utilization of waste material sugar cane bagasse ash can be advantageously used as a replacement of cement up to 5% without reduction in strength of concrete. Also, it can be observed that, SCBA concrete performed better even in aggressive environments when compared to ordinary concrete even at later stages.\n\nAbstract: The present study deals with the effect of additives on the early strength gain of soil stabilized with conventional stabilizers like lime and cement. The development of UCC strength of stabilized soil admixed with industrial wastes over a curing period of 2 hours, 3 days and 7 days was studied. The industrial wastes used in the present work were ceramic dust and press mud obtained from pulverization of ceramic tiles from construction debris and sugar industry respectively. Ceramic dust was used as admixture for cement stabilization and press mud was used as admixture for lime stabilization of soil. The results of the study indicated that addition of press mud resulted in increase in early strength when sufficient quantity of lime was available for reaction. The addition of ceramic dust resulted in enhanced early strength in case of cement stabilization for all combinations studied but the maximum strength gain was achieved for a specific percentage of cement and ceramic dust which can be considered as the optimum dosage for the soil used in the study. The results of the study strengthen the fact established by earlier studies that industrial wastes can be effectively used for soil stabilization purposes as additives to conventional stabilizers. Keywords: Cement Stabilization, Lime Stabilization, Press Mud, Ceramic Dust, Early strength.\n\nThe International Journal of Earth Sciences and Engineering (IJEE) focus on Earth sciences and Engineering with emphasis on earth sciences and engineering.

In both economic point of view and use of eco-friendly materials, compressed mud bricks are used extensively as a construction material. The main objective of this paper is to present a feasibility study on the characteristics of the red mud bricks with Stabilizers such as GGBS, PFA, Lime etc., under different testing parameters such as compressive strength, water absorption, initial rate of absorption, efflorescence, SEM, EDAX or EDS and XRD.\n\nSoil is extremely complex, heterogeneous substance which has been subjected to varieties of nature. Properties of soil do not change only with location to location but also with respect to depth, climate and drainage condition of soil. Soil stabilization is the process by which strength properties of soil can be improved with the use of adding some materials like polypropylene, wheat husk fiber, copper slag etc. There is a rapid increase in waste quantity of plastic fibers, if this waste can be utilize for stabilization of soil than problem of solid waste can be resolve and also cost of soil stabilization can be reduced. This study presented a review of literature on soil stabilization using polypropylene and wheat husk fiber.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to investigate the potential use of various solid wastes for producing construction materials. The paper is based on the comprehensive review of available literature on the construction materials including different kinds of solid wastes. The traditional methods for producing construction materials are using the valuable natural resources. Besides, the industrial and urban management systems are generating solid wastes, and most often dumping them in open fields. These activities pose serious detrimental effects on the environment. To safeguard the environment, many efforts are being made for the recycling of different types of solid wastes with a view to utilizing them in the production of various construction materials. This paper discusses the environmental implications caused by the generation of various solid wastes, and highlights their recycling potentials and possible use for producing construction materials. In addition, this paper shows the applications of solid waste based construction materials in real construction, and identifies the research needs."
