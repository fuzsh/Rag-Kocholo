        "text": "Stands were partitioned to make room for a separate enclosure for Filipino fans but a low-key encounter ending in a tame 3-0 victory for South China over Global FC of the Philippines in the AFC Cup hardly ignited passions at Mong Kok Stadium on Wednesday night.\n\nThe last time a team from the Philippines visited Hong Kong - a friendly between the two national teams in June 2013 - it ended with the Hong Kong Football Association forced to pay a fine of more than HK$250,000 to Fifa, whichposed a penalty for racial abuse.\n\nA group of Filipino fans, including women and children, were reportedly verbally abused by home fans on that occasion.\n\nAfter complaints by the Philippines Football Association and the Philippine consulate in Hong Kong, the HKFA had to file a report on the incident and that resulted in a financial slap on the wrist.\n\nThe HKFA learned its lesson well. On Wednesday, one section at Mong Kok was kept exclusive for \"away\" fans, but only 13 turned up.\n\nThe rest of the 1,695-strong crowd was there to support the Caroliners, but they were more frustrated with their own team than with the visitors.\n\nIt was not surprising considering the quality dished out - at times mediocre to say the least. If not for a well-taken goal by Michael Cheng Lai-hin, who seconds after coming on as a substitute in the 39th minute connected sweetly with a cross from forward Daniel McBreen, the home team looked off-colour in the first half.\n\n\"It was boring,\" was South China coach Mario Gomez's tongue in cheek immediate assessment. But he was not far wrong.\n\nMissing injured strikers Chan Siu-ki and Mahama Awal, the Caroliners seemed unable to get out of second gear in attack for most of the game.\n\nBut man of the match Bojan Malisic refused to be downbeat. \"We are unbeaten after five matches in the AFC Cup and that is a very good performance. Some people might say our opponents are easy, but there are no easy games in this competition.\"\n\nIn the first encounter between the two sides, South China romped to a 6-1 victory with strikers McBreen and Awal getting a brace each. The latter has been on the injury list for a while and his spark is sorely lacking.\n\nTwo goals in the second half gave the scoreline a respectability it did not deserve - a header from a corner by defender Malisic midway through the second half and a last-gasp strike from McBreen in time added on.\n\nIn the end, the result was academic as South China had already booked their berth in the last 16. They are unbeaten and at the top of group G with a maximum 15 points, ensuring a home game in the knockout stage.\n\nWhile bemoaning a lack of firepower on attack, visiting coach Dan Padernal paid tribute to South China's defence.\n\n\"Their central defenders were very good and it was hard to break down their defence. We had a few chances, but our finishing was not that great,\" Padernal said.\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Little passion on and off the pitch"
