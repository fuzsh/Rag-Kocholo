        "text": "The aim of this study was to generate a national-scale landslide susceptibility map for Dominica. As the available data turned out to be insufficient to generate reliable results, we decided to generate several new data layers, and significantly improved some of the existing data. We generated a new database of disaster events for Dominica, making use of many different sources. This is the most complete inventory to our knowledge. It is quite clear from this database that the landslide reporting became more frequent in recent years, and less information on landslides is available when going back in time, whereas the data on tropical storms and hurricanes seems to be much more constant over time. The underreporting of landslides is a big problem in trying to evaluate landslide frequency/magnitude relations. We also compiled all available landslide occurrence data from different sources. We had to digitize some of the older inventories which were only available in paper format. Eventually we compiled landslide inventories for 1987, 1990, 2007 and we generated a completely new landslide inventory using multi-temporal visual image interpretation, and generated an extensive landslide database for Dominica. The resulting landslide database contains 980 landslides from 1987, 183 from 1990, 161 from 2007 and 986 new landslides were mapped representing the situation in 2014. We also compiled landslide inventories along the road network for five recent events from the maintenance records of the Ministry of Public Works. These contained 27 landslides for September 2009, 20 for October 2010, 84 for September 2011, 74 for November 2011 and 44 for April 2013. After completing the first version of the report a large number of landslides were triggered by tropical storm Erika in August 2015. We decided to include these data in this second version of the report, and also update the landslide inventory and susceptibility map. UNOSAT mapped a total of 1554 new landslides as polygons using semi-automatic image classification and BRGM mapped 89 landslides as points in the field. We analyzed the triggering conditions for landslides as far as was possible given the available data, and generated rainfall magnitude-frequency relations. However, there were not enough data (both in terms of landslide dates and date-related inventories) to be able to calculate magnitude-frequency relations for landslides, in terms of the number or density of landslide per different frequencies. We applied a method for landslide initiation susceptibility assessment that is the best possible, given the availability of data. A bi-variate statistical analysis provided indications on the importance of the possible contributing factors, but the actual combination of the factor maps was done using a subjective expert-based iterative weighing approach using Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE). The method is transparent, as the stakeholders (e.g. the engineers and planners from the four countries) and other consultants can consult the criteria trees and evaluate the standardization and weights, and make adjustments. The method analyses only landslide initiation susceptibility; landslide runout susceptibility should be included in local and site-investigation studies. The first version of the landslide susceptibility map was generated in June 2015. Shortly after that, in August 2015, tropical storm Erika triggered hundreds of landslides in Dominica. We decided to include the new event in the analysis, as this was a major event with many landslide, and to adjust the landslide susceptibility map so that the new landslides were included in the high and moderate susceptibility classes. The method for landslide susceptibility assessment was further expanded by including the historical landslides in the susceptibility map and by manual editing of the final map. The whole map was visually checked, and the modelled zones of high, moderate and low susceptibility were adapted when necessary, so that they reflect the best situation according to the mapping geomorphologist. This was a rather time consuming activity, but it allowed to analyse the different parts of the map separately, and therefore obtain results that also are valid for a local scale, and not only for a national scale. The manual editing of the susceptibility map was also done to simplify the susceptibility units. In the final landslide susceptibility map, 3% occurs in low susceptibility, 8 % in moderate, and 89 % in high susceptibility. Of the landslides that were triggered during tropical storm Erika 5% occurred in low susceptibility areas, 13% in moderate and 83% in high susceptibility classes. When considering the landslide density, the values for low, moderate and high 0.039, 0.262 and 5.658 % respectively based on area density and 0.174, 0.997 and 9.849 nr/km2 respectively for number density. It was very difficult to determine the frequency of the landslide densities due to a lack of sufficient event-based inventories. We have separated four types of events: frequent, moderate, large and major events. We selected landslide inventories with increasing densities to represent these four events. For the road network we also generated a landslide susceptibility map by subdividing the primary road network into homogeneous segments which were characterized by information from a road database provided by the Ministry of Public work. We also used SMCE to generate a susceptibility map which we characterized using the five available landslide inventories along the road. We calculated the maximum and average landslide density, as the number of landslides per kilometre of road. For the road network we also made an estimation of the average landslide density (as number per kilometer of road) for frequencies. Also exposure analysis was carried out for buildings. We mapped all buildings in Dominica using a combination of satellite image classification and visual interpretation. One should be careful when using the national-scale landslide susceptibility and hazard map for evaluating the landslide hazard of individual buildings and critical infrastructure. The scale of this map is not appropriate to utilize it for local or detailed scale analysis. Other, more detailed landslide hazard methods should be used for these scales, which also require more detailed information on soil characteristics, such as soil depth, hydrological and geotechnical properties."
