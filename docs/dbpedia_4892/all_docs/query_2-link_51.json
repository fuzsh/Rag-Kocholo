However, surface or interface leakage current has been a major issue for superlattice avalanche photodiodes, especially in infrared wavelength region. First, passivation of the superlattice device with ammonium sulfide and thioacetamide was carried out, and its surface quality was studied by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The study showed that both ammonium sulfide and thiacetamide passivation can actively remove the native oxide at the surface. Thiacetamide passivation combine more sulfur bonds with III-V elements than that of ammonium sulfide. Another X-ray photoelectron spectra of thiacetamide-treated atomic layer deposited zinc sulfide capped InAs/GaSb superlattice was performed to investigate the interface sulfur bond conditions. Sb--S and As--S bonds disappear while In-S bond gets enhanced, indicating that Indium Sulfide should be the major components at the interface after ZnS deposition. Second, the simulation of electrical characteristics for zinc sulfide, silicon nitride and silicon dioxide passivated superlattice devices was performed by SILVACO software to fit the experimental results and to discover the surface current mechanism. Different surface current mechanism strengths were found. Third, several novel dual-carrier avalanche photodiode structures were designed and simulated. The structures had alternate carrier multiplication regions, placed next to a wider electron multiplication region, creating dual-carrier multiplication feedback systems. Gain and excess noise factor of these structures were simulated and compared based on the dead space multiplication theory under uniform electric field. From the simulation, the applied bias can be greatly lowered or the thickness can be shrunk to achieve the same gain from the conventional device. The width of the thin region was the most\n\n21 CFR 73.2995 - Luminescent zinc sulfide.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 1 2013-04-01 2013-04-01 false Luminescent zinc sulfide. 73.2995 Section 73.2995 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES GENERAL LISTING OF COLOR ADDITIVES EXEMPT FROM CERTIFICATION Cosmetics Â§ 73.2995 Luminescent zinc sulfide.

Good matching between the ZnS and porous silicon (PS) structure was noted from the atomic force microscope (AFM) results. The reflectivity gave a clear observation of anti-reflected coating improvement for PS layer and more enhancements after the ZnS deposition. The optical properties show a blue shift in the bandgap for the ZnS deposited with higher substrate temperature and a red shift after doped with different elements. For ZnS/PS heterojunction, the electrical resistivity has been increased after PS layer formed and changed with the variation of the pore size and it was much higher after ZnS deposited on the PS. However, use of ZnS:Cu/PS photodetector showed much higher output current at the ultraviolet (UV) region compared to ZnS/PS. The ZnS:Cu/PS photodetector showed higher output current value than that of the ZnS/PS leading to improvement in the quantum efficiency of 42%.\n\nRelating Silicon Carbide Avalanche Breakdown Diode Design to Pulsed-Energy Capability\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-03-01\n\nRelating Silicon Carbide Avalanche Breakdown Diode Design to Pulsed- Energy Capability Damian Urciuoli, Miguel Hinojosa, and Ronald Green US...were pulse tested in an inductive load circuit at peak powers of over 110 kW.

Also the value of noise equivalent power NEP of these detectors is the smallest. In the paper, the design, technology and properties of the silicon avalanche photodiodes with a n+ - p - Ï - p+ epiplanar structure developed at the Institute of Electron Technology (ITE) are presented. The diameters of photosensitive area range from 0.3 mm to 5 mm. The ITE photodiodes are optimized for the detection of the 800 nm - 850 nm radiation, but the detailed research on spectral dependencies of the gain and noise parameters has revealed that the spectral operating range of the ITE photodiodes is considerable wider and achieves 550 - 1000 nm. These photodiodes can be used in detection of very weak and very fast optical signals. Presently in the world, the studies are carried out on applying the avalanche photodiodes in detection of X radiation and in the scintillation detection of nuclear radiation.\n\nRemediation of arsenic and lead with nanocrystalline zinc sulfide.\n\nPubMed\n\nPiquette, Alan; Cannon, Cody; Apblett, Allen W\n\n2012-07-27\n\nNanocrystalline (1.7 Â± 0.3 nm) zinc sulfide with a specific surface area up to 360 m(2) g(-1) was prepared from the thermal decomposition of a single-source precursor, zinc ethylxanthate. Zinc ethylxanthate decomposes to cubic zinc sulfide upon exposure to temperatures greater than or equal to 125 Â°C. The resulting zinc sulfide was tested as a water impurity extractant. The target impurities used in this study were As(5+), As(3+), and Pb(2+). The reaction of the nanocrystalline ZnS with Pb(2+) proceeds as a replacement reaction where solid PbS is formed and Zn(2+) is released into the aqueous system. Removal of lead to a level of less than two parts per billion is achievable. The results of a detailed kinetics experiment between the ZnS and Pb(2+) are included in this study. Unlike the instance of lead, both As(5+) and As(3+) adsorb on the surface of the ZnS extractant as opposed to an ion-exchange process. An uptake capacity of > 25 mg g(-1) for the removal of As(5+) is possible. The uptake of As(3+) appears to proceed by a slower process than that of the As(5+) with a capacity of nearly 20 mg g(-1). The nanocrystalline zinc sulfide was extremely successful for the removal of arsenic and lead from simulated oil sand tailing pond water.\n\nClassification of polytype structures of zinc sulfide\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLaptev, V.I.\n\n1994-12-31\n\nIt is suggested that the existing classification of polytype structures of zinc sulfide be supplemented with an additional criterion: the characteristic of regular point systems (Wyckoff positions) including their type, number, and multiplicity. The consideration of the Wyckoff positions allowed the establishment of construction principles of known polytype series of different symmetries and the systematization (for the first time) of the polytypes with the same number of differently packed layers. the classification suggested for polytype structures of zinc sulfide is compact and provides a basis for creating search systems. The classification table obtained can also be used for numerous siliconmoreÂ Â» carbide polytypes. 8 refs., 4 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nInhibition effects of protein-conjugated amorphous zinc sulfide nanoparticles on tumor cells growth\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCao, Ying; Wang, Hua-Jie; Cao, Cui; Sun, Yuan-Yuan; Yang, Lin; Wang, Bao-Qing; Zhou, Jian-Guo\n\n2011-07-01\n\nIn this article, a facile and environmentally friendly method was applied to fabricate BSA-conjugated amorphous zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanoparticles using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the matrix. Transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated that the stable and well-dispersed nanoparticles with the diameter of 15.9 Â± 2.1 nm were successfully prepared. The energy dispersive X-ray, X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrograph, high resolution transmission electron microscope, and selected area electron diffraction measurements showed that the obtained nanoparticles had the amorphous structure and the coordination occurred between zinc sulfide surfaces and BSA in the nanoparticles. In addition, the inhibition effects of BSA-conjugated amorphous zinc sulfide nanoparticles on tumor cells growth were described in detail by cell viability analysis, optical and electron microscopy methods. The results showed that BSA-conjugated amorphous zinc sulfide nanoparticles could inhibit the metabolism and proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and the inhibition was dose dependent. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.36 mg/mL. Overall, this study suggested that BSA-conjugated amorphous zinc sulfide nanoparticles had the application potential as cytostatic agents and BSA in the nanoparticles could provide the modifiable site for the nanoparticles to improve their bioactivity or to endow them with the target function.\n\nA field investigation of the relationship between zinc and acid volatile sulfide concentrations in freshwater sediments\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nAnkley, Gerald T.; Liber, Karsten; Call, Daniel J.; Markee, Thomas P.; Canfield, Timothy J.; Ingersoll, Christopher G.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nUnderstanding relationships between cationic metals such as cadmium, copper, nickel, lead and zinc, and amorphous iron sulfides, measured as acid volatile sulfide (AVS), is key to predicting metal bioavailability and toxicity insediments. The objective of the present study was to assess seasonal and spatial variations of AVS in freshwater sediments contaminated with zinc. Sediments were sampled from three streams with varying levels of zinc contamination at two different times, March and June of 1995, representing cold- and warm-weather situations. Interstitial (pore) water concentrations of zinc, and solid phase concentrations of AVS and zinc were measured in surficial and deep sediment horizons. Toxicity tests (10-d) with the amphipodHyalella azteca were conducted using intact cores. Sediment zinc concentrations from six sites within the primary test stream differed by about five-fold, and also varied seasonally. Acid volatile sulfide concentrations were generally lower than those of zinc, and pore water zinc concentrations typically were elevated. There was a positive correlation between solid-phase AVS and zinc concentrations, suggesting that the system was dominated by zinc, as opposed to iron sulfides. In contrast to expectations arising from some studies of seasonal variations of AVS in iron-dominated systems, AVS concentrations were smaller in June than in March. However, this was likely due to a major storm event and associated sediment scouring before the June sampling, rather than to seasonal processes related to variations in temperature and dissolved oxygen. Based upon an indirect analysis of depth variations in AVS, there was some indication that zinc sulfide might be less prone to oxidation than iron sulfide. There was a strong correlation between toxicity of the sediment samples toH. azteca and interstitial water concentrations of zinc; however, the possible contribution of other contaminants to sediment toxicity cannot be dismissed.\n\nTemperature characteristics of silicon avalanche photodiodes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWegrzecka, Iwona; Grynglas, Maria; Wegrzecki, Maciej; Bar, Jan; Grodecki, Remigiusz\n\n2001-08-01\n\nThe paper presents the results of studies on temperature dependence of such parameters as a dark current, noise current, gain, noise equivalent power and detectivity of silicon epiplanar avalanche photodiodes at the ITE. The photodiode reach-through structure is of an nPLU-p-(pi) - p+ type with an under-contact ring and a channel stopper. The temperature range was stretching from -40 C to +40 C. Specially developed for this purpose an automatic system for low noise measurements was used. A two- stage micro-cooler with a Peltier's element was applied to control and stabilize the temperature of measured structures.\n\nCadmium zinc sulfide by solution growth\n\nDOEpatents\n\nChen, Wen S.\n\n1992-05-12\n\nA process for depositing thin layers of a II-VI compound cadmium zinc sulfide (CdZnS) by an aqueous solution growth technique with quality suitable for high efficiency photovoltaic or other devices which can benefit from the band edge shift resulting from the inclusion of Zn in the sulfide. A first solution comprising CdCl.sub.2 2.5H.sub.2 O, NH.sub.4 Cl, NH.sub.4 OH and ZnCl.sub.2, and a second solution comprising thiourea ((NH.sub.2).sub.2 CS) are combined and placed in a deposition cell, along with a substrate to form a thin i.e. 10 nm film of CdZnS on the substrate. This process can be sequentially repeated with to achieve deposition of independent multiple layers having different Zn concentrations.\n\nNano-multiplication region avalanche photodiodes and arrays\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZheng, Xinyu (Inventor); Pain, Bedabrata (Inventor); Cunningham, Thomas J.

However, the S(0) formed in the DSR process are micro-sized colloids with negatively charged surface, making isolation of S(0) colloids from other biological cells and metabolites difficult. This study proposed the use of S(0) in DSR effluent as a novel adsorbent for zinc removal from wastewaters. Batch and continuous tests were conducted for efficient zinc removal with S(0)-containing DSR effluent. At pH<7.5, removal rates of zinc(II) were increased with increasing pH. The formed S(0) colloids carried negative charge onto which zinc(II) ions could be adsorbed via electrostatic interactions. The zinc(II) adsorbed S(0) colloids further enhanced coagulation-sedimentation efficiency of suspended solids in DSR effluents. The DSR effluent presents a promising coagulant for zinc(II) containing wastewaters. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

P.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nArrays of ZnO nanostructures, which are optically transparent in the visible range, were grown on the surface of porous silicon by electrochemical deposition. Photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra of the obtained hybrid structures were investigated in 220-450 and 400-800 nm regions, respectively. It is established that multicolor emission is formed by combining the luminescence bands of porous silicon and zinc oxide. The possibility of controlling the photoluminescence spectra by changing the excitation energy is demonstrated. It is revealed that thermal annealing has an effect on the luminescent properties of porous silicon/zinc oxide hybrid structures. Thermal processing at 500Â°C leads to a sharp decrease of long-wavelength luminescence associated with porous silicon and to an increase of short-wavelength luminescence intensity related to zinc oxide.\n\nSilicon-zinc-glycerol hydrogel, a potential immunotropic agent for topical application.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhonina, Tat'yana G; Ivanenko, Maria V; Chupakhin, Oleg N; Safronov, Alexander P; Bogdanova, Ekaterina A; Karabanalov, Maxim S; Permikin, Vasily V; Larionov, Leonid P; Drozdova, Lyudmila I\n\n2017-09-30\n\nNanoparticles synthesized using sol-gel method are promising agents for biomedical applications, in particular for the therapy and diagnosis of various diseases. Using silicon and zinc glycerolates as biocompatible precursors we synthesized by the sol-gel method a new bioactive silicon-zinc-containing glycerohydrogel combining the positive pharmacological properties of the precursors. In the present work the structural features of silicon-zinc-containing glycerohydrogel and its immunotropic properties were studied. The advanced physical methods, including XRD, TEM, dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering, were used for studying the structural features of the gel. Hydrolysis of zinc monoglycerolate was investigated under gelation conditions. Evaluation of the efficiency of silicon-zinc-containing glycerohydrogel in providing immune functions was carried out using a model of the complicated wound process behind immunosuppression induced by hydrocortisone administration in the Wistar rats. It has been shown that zinc monoglycerolate exists in the state of amorphous nanoparticles in the cells of 3D-network formed due to incomplete hydrolysis of silicon glycerolates and subsequent silanol condensation. Zinc monoglycerolate is not hydrolyzed and does not enter 3D-network of the gel with the formation of Zn-O-Si groups, but it forms a separate phase. Immunotropic action of silicon-zinc-containing glycerohydrogel was revealed by the histology and immunohistochemistry methods. Amorphous nanoparticles of zinc monoglycerolate, water-soluble silicon glycerolates, and products of their hydrolytic transformations, which are present in a aqueous-glycerol medium, are in the first place responsible for the pharmacological activity of hydrogel. The results obtained allow us to consider silicon-zinc-containing glycerohydrogel as a promising immunotropic agent for topical application. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated metals removal from lead-zinc mine tailings using bioleaching and followed by sulfide precipitation. Metals were dissolved from the tailings by the bacteria in a bioleaching reactor. During a 10% pulp density bioleaching experiment, approximately 0.82% Pb, 97.38% Zn, and 71.37% Fe were extracted after 50 days. With the pulp density of 10% and 20%, the dissolution of metals followed shrinking core kinetic model. Metals (Pb, Zn, and Fe) present in the pregnant bioleaching leachate. Metals were next precipitated as a sulfide phase using sodium sulfide (Na 2 S). Metal precipitations were selectively and quantitatively produced from the bioleaching leachate by adding Na 2 S. More than 99% of the zinc and 75% of the iron was precipitated using 25Â g/L Na 2 S in the bioleaching leachate. The results in the study were to provide useful information for recovering or removing metals from lead-zinc mine tailings. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The cell leachate was monitored for physicochemical parameters, ion concentrations and stable isotope ratios of zinc. Filtered zinc concentrations (<0.45 Î¼m) in the leachate ranged between 4.5 mg L(-1) and 1.9 g L(-1)-potentially controlled by pH, mineral solubility kinetics and (de)sorption processes. The zinc stable isotope ratios varied mass-dependently within +0.1 and +0.52â° relative to IRMM 3702, and were strongly dependent on the pH (rpH-d66Zn=0.65, p<0.005, n=31). At a pH below 5, zinc mobilization was governed by sphalerite oxidation and hydroxide dissolution-pointing to the isotope signature of sphalerite (+0.1 to +0.16â°). Desorption processes resulted in enrichment of (66)Zn in the leachate reaching a maximum offset of +0.32â° compared to the proposed sphalerite isotope signature. Over a period characterized by pH=6.1 Â± 0.6, isotope ratios were significantly more enriched in (66)Zn with an offset of â 0.23â° compared to sphalerite, suggesting that zinc release may have been derived from a second zinc source, such as carbonate minerals, which compose 8 wt.% of the tailings. This preliminary study confirms the benefit of applying zinc isotopes alongside standard monitoring parameters to track principal zinc sources and weathering processes in complex multi-phase matrices.

This study presents a new route, roasting combined with sulfidization-flotation, for the recovery of anglesite and silver from jarosite residues of zinc hydrometallurgy. Surface appearance and elemental distribution of jarosite residues was examined by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry analysis, respectively. Decomposition and transformation mechanisms of jarosite residues were illustrated by differential thermal analysis. Results showed that after roasting combined with flotation, the grade and recovery of lead were 43.89% and 66.86%, respectively, and those of silver were 1.3 kg/t and 81.60%, respectively. At 600-700 Â°C, jarosite was decomposed to release encapsulated valuable minerals such as anglesite (PbSO4) and silver mineral; silver jarosite decomposed into silver sulfate (Ag2SO4); and zinc ferrite (ZnO Â· Fe2O3) decomposed into zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) and hematite (Fe2O3). Bared anglesite and silver minerals were modified by sodium sulfide and easily collected by flotation collectors. This study demonstrates that the combination of roasting and sulfidization-flotation provides a promising process for the recovery of zinc, lead, and silver from jarosite residues of zinc hydrometallurgy.

It deactivates sphalerite flotation by substituting the activating metal ions, and depresses sphalerite flotation by forming hydrophilic coatings of zinc hydroxyl species on sphalerite surfaces. However, we recently observed that zinc sulfate could also induce coagulation of fine sphalerite particles and such coagulation significantly reduced the mechanical entrainment of the fine sphalerite. Therefore, it seems that the effectiveness of zinc sulfate as a selective sphalerite depressant is not only due to its ability to make mineral surface hydrophilic, which reduces genuine flotation, but also due to its ability to coagulate the mineral, which reduces mechanical entrainment. Zinc sulfate is a \"dual function\" selective flotation depressant.\n\nSynthesis and interface structures of zinc sulfide sheathed zinc-cadmium nanowire heterojunctions.\n\nPubMed\n\nShen, Guozhen; Bando, Yoshio; Gao, Yihua; Golberg, Dmitri\n\n2006-07-27\n\nZinc sulfide (ZnS) sheathed zinc (Zn)-cadmium (Cd) nanowire heterojunctions have been prepared by thermal evaporating of ZnS and CdS powders in a vertical induction furnace at 1200 degrees C. Studies found that both the Zn and Cd subnanowires, within a single nanoheterojunction, are single-crystallines with the growth directions perpendicular to the [210] plane, whereas the sheathed ZnS is polycrystalline with a thickness of ca. 5 nm. The Zn/Cd interface structure in the ZnS sheathed Zn-Cd nanowire heterojunctions was thoroughly experimentally studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and theoretically studied using a near-coincidence site lattice (NCSL) concept. The results show that the Cd and Zn have a crystalline orientation relationship as [0001]Zn//[0001]Cd, (10(-)10)Zn//(10(-)10)Cd, (01(-)10)Zn//(01(-)10)Cd, and ((-)1100)Zn//((-)1100)Cd.\n\nZinc sulfide in intestinal cell granules of Ancylostoma caninum adults\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGianotti, A.J.; Clark, D.T.; Dash, J.\n\n1991-04-01\n\nA source of confusion has existed since the turn of the century about the reddish brown, weakly birefringent 'sphaerocrystals' located in the intestines of strongyle nematodes, Strongylus and Ancylostoma. X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectrometric analyses were used for accurate determination of the crystalline order and elemental composition of the granules in the canine hookworm Ancylostoma caninum. The composition of the intestinal pigmented granules was identified unequivocally as zinc sulfide. It seems most probable that the granules serve to detoxify high levels of metallic ions (specifically zinc) present due to the large intake of host blood.\n\nPractical photon number detection with electric field-modulated silicon avalanche photodiodes.\n\nPubMed\n\nThomas, O; Yuan, Z L; Shields, A J\n\n2012-01-24\n\nLow-noise single-photon detection is a prerequisite for quantum information processing using photonic qubits. In particular, detectors that are able to accurately resolve the number of photons in an incident light pulse will find application in functions such as quantum teleportation and linear optics quantum computing. More generally, such a detector will allow the advantages of quantum light detection to be extended to stronger optical signals, permitting optical measurements limited only by fluctuations in the photon number of the source. Here we demonstrate a practical high-speed device, which allows the signals arising from multiple photon-induced avalanches to be precisely discriminated. We use a type of silicon avalanche photodiode in which the lateral electric field profile is strongly modulated in order to realize a spatially multiplexed detector. Clearly discerned multiphoton signals are obtained by applying sub-nanosecond voltage gates in order to restrict the detector current.\n\nChemical Vapor Deposited Zinc Sulfide. SPIE Press Monograph\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMcCloy, John S.; Tustison, Randal W.\n\n2013-04-22\n\nZinc sulfide has shown unequaled utility for infrared windows that require a combination of long-wavelength infrared transparency, mechanical durability, and elevated-temperature performance. This book reviews the physical properties of chemical vapor deposited ZnS and their relationship to the CVD process that produced them. An in-depth look at the material microstructure is included, along with a discussion of the material's optical properties. Finally, because the CVD process itself is central to the development of this material, a brief history is presented.\n\nEffect of zinc impurity on silicon solar-cell efficiency\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSah, C.-T.; Chan, P.

L.-Y.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nZinc is a major residue impurity in the preparation of solar-grade silicon material by the zinc vapor reduction of silicon tetrachloride. This paper projects that in order to get a 17-percent AM1 cell efficiency for the Block IV module of the Low-Cost Solar Array Project, the concentration of the zinc recombination centers in the base region of silicon solar cells must be less than 4 x 10 to the 11th Zn/cu cm in the p-base n+/p/p+ cell and 7 x 10 to the 11th Zn/cu cm in the n-base p+/n/n+ cell for a base dopant impurity concentration of 5 x 10 to the 14 atoms/cu cm. If the base dopant impurity concentration is increased by a factor of 10 to 5 x 10 to the 15th atoms/cu cm, then the maximum allowable zinc concentration is increased by a factor of about two for a 17-percent AM1 efficiency. The thermal equilibrium electron and hole recombination and generation rates at the double-acceptor zinc centers are obtained from previous high-field measurements as well as new measurements at zero field described in this paper. These rates are used in the exact dc-circuit model to compute the projections.\n\nSurface and capillary forces encountered by zinc sulfide microspheres in aqueous electrolyte.\n\nPubMed\n\nGillies, Graeme; Kappl, Michael; Butt, Hans-JÃ¼rgen\n\n2005-06-21\n\nThe colloid probe technique was used to investigate the interactions between individual zinc sulfide (ZnS) microspheres and an air bubble in electrolyte solution. Incorporation of zinc ions into the electrolyte solution overcomes the disproportionate zinc ion dissolution and mimics high-volume-fraction conditions common in flotation. Determined interaction forces revealed a distinct lack of long-ranged hydrophobic forces, indicated by the presence of a DLVO repulsion prior to particle engulfment. Single microsphere contact angles were determined from particle-bubble interactions. Contact angles increased with decreasing radii and with surface oxidation. Surface modification by the absorption of copper and subsequently potassium O-ethyldithiocarbonate (KED) reduced repulsive forces and strongly increased contact angles.\n\nA Study on Dielectric Properties of Cadmium Sulfide-Zinc Sulfide Core-Shell Nanocomposites for Application as Nanoelectronic Filter Component in the Microwave Domain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDevi, Jutika; Datta, Pranayee\n\n2018-07-01\n\nComplex permittivities of cadmium sulfide (CdS), zinc sulfide (ZnS), and of cadmium sulfide-zinc sulfide (CdS/ZnS) core-shell nanoparticles embedded in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix (PVA) were measured in liquid phase using a VectorNetwork Analyzer in the frequency range of 500 MHz-10 GHz.

The aim of this work was to investigate how the composition of dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) influences the stability of zinc sulfide nanoparticles as they nucleate and aggregate in water with dissolved NOM. We compared NOM fractions that were isolated from several surface waters and represented a range of characteristics including molecular weight, type of carbon, and ligand density. Dynamic light scattering was employed to monitor the growth and aggregation of ZnâSâNOM nanoparticles in supersaturated solutions containing dissolved aquatic humic substances. The NOM was observed to reduce particle growth rates, depending on solution variables such as type and concentration of NOM, monovalent electrolyte concentration, and pH. The rates of growth increased with increasing ionic strength, indicating that observed growth rates primarily represented aggregation of charged ZnâSâNOM particles. Furthermore, the observed rates decreased with increasing molecular weight and aromatic content of the NOM fractions, while carboxylate and reduced sulfur content had little effect. Differences between NOM were likely due to properties that increased electrosteric hindrances for aggregation. Overall, results of this study suggest that the composition and source of NOM are key factors that contribute to the stabilization and persistence of zinc sulfide nanoparticles in the aquatic environment.\n\nStudy of microstructure and electroluminescence of zinc sulfide thin film\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao-hong, Liu; Yu-jiang, Wang; Mou-zhi, Chen; Zhen-xiang, Chen; Shu-nong, Sun; Mei-chun, Huang\n\n1998-03-01\n\nThe electroluminscent zinc sulfide thin film doped with erbium, fabricated by thermal evaporation with two boats, are examined.

We show that using unenriched boron nitride powder, rather than the more commonly used enriched lithium fluoride, results in detection screens which produce less light but which are very considerably cheaper.

Some commercial activated carbons previously selected (Monteleoneet al., 2011) as being effective in hydrogen sulfide up taking have been tested in an adsorption measurement apparatus, by flowing both hydrogen sulphide and volatile siloxane (Decamethycyclopentasiloxane or D5) in a nitrogen stream,typically 25-300 ppm D5 over N2, through an clay minerals, Fe oxides and Silica; the adsorption process was analyzed by varying some experimental parameters (concentration, grain size, bed height). The best silica shows an adsorption capacity of 0.2 g D5 per gram of silica. The next thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) confirms the capacity data obtained experimentally by the breakthrough curve tests.The capacity results depend on D5 and hydrogen sulphide concentrations. A regenerative silica process is then carried out byheating the silica bed up to 200 Â° C and flushing out the adsorbed D5 and hydrogen sulphide samples in a nitrogen stream in athree step heating procedure up to 200 Â° C. The adsorption capacity is observed to degrade after cyclingthe samples through several adsorption-desorption cycles.\n\nResearch on the magnetorheological finishing of large aperture off-axis aspheric optical surfaces for zinc sulfide\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Yunfei; Huang, Wen; Zheng, Yongcheng; Ji, Fang; Xu, Min; Duan, Zhixin; Luo, Qing; Liu, Qian; Xiao, Hong\n\n2016-03-01\n\nZinc sulfide is a kind of typical infrared optical material, commonly produced using single point diamond turning (SPDT). SPDT can efficiently produce zinc sulfide aspheric surfaces with micro-roughness and acceptable figure error. However the tool marks left by the diamond turning process cause high micro-roughness that degrades the optical performance when used in the visible region of the spectrum. Magnetorheological finishing (MRF) is a deterministic, sub-aperture polishing technology that is very helpful in improving both surface micro-roughness and surface figure.This paper mainly investigates the MRF technology of large aperture off-axis aspheric optical surfaces for zinc sulfide. The topological structure and coordinate transformation of a MRF machine tool PKC1200Q2 are analyzed and its kinematics is calculated, then the post-processing algorithm model of MRF for an optical lens is established. By taking the post-processing of off-axis aspheric surfacefor example, a post-processing algorithm that can be used for a raster tool path is deduced and the errors produced by the approximate treatment are analyzed. A polishing algorithm of trajectory planning and dwell time based on matrix equation and optimization theory is presented in this paper. Adopting this algorithm an experiment is performed to machining a large-aperture off-axis aspheric surface on the MRF machine developed by ourselves. After several times' polishing, the figure accuracy PV is proved from 3.3Î» to 2.0Î» and RMS from 0.451Î» to 0.327Î». This algorithm is used to polish the other shapes including spheres, aspheres and prisms.\n\nZinc cobalt sulfide nanosheets array derived from 2D bimetallic metal-organic frameworks for high-performance supercapacitor.\n\nPubMed\n\nTao, Kai; Han, Xue; Cheng, Qiuhui; Yang, Yujing; Yang, Zheng; Ma, Qingxiang; Han, Lei\n\n2018-04-19\n\nPorous ternary metal sulfide integrated electrode materials with abundant electroactive sites and redox reactions are very promising for supercapacitors. Here, porous zinc cobalt sulfide nanosheets array on Ni foam (Zn-Co-S/NF) has been successfully constructed by a facile growth of 2D bimetallic zinc/cobalt-based metal-organic frameworks (Zn/Co-MOF) nanosheets with leaf-like morphology on Ni foam, followed by additional sulfurization. The Zn-Co-S/NF nanosheets array is directly acted as an electrode for supercapacitor, showing much better electrochemical performance (2354.3 F g-1 and 88.6% retention over 1000 cycles) when compared with zinc cobalt sulfide powder (355.3 F g-1 and 75.8% retention over 1000 cycles), which is originated from good electric conductivity and mechanical stability, abundant electroactive sites, and facilitated transportation of electron and electrolyte ion endowed by the unique nanosheets array structure. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device assembled from Zn-Co-S/NF and activated carbon electrodes can deliver the highest energy density of 31.9 Wh kg-1 and the maximum power density of 8.5 kW kg-1. Most importantly, this ASC also presents good cycling stability (97% retention over 1000 cycles). Furthermore, a red light-emitting diode (LED) can be illuminated by two connected ASCs, indicating that as-synthesized Zn-Co-S/NF hold great potential for practical applications.

The initial and exhausted samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR, potentiometric titration, EDX, thermal analysis, and nitrogen adsorption. An increase in the amount of H(2)S adsorbed/oxidized on their surfaces in comparison with that of pure Zn(OH)(2) is linked to the structure of the composite, the relative number of terminal hydroxyls, and the kind of graphene-based phase used. Although terminal groups are activated by a photochemical process, the graphite oxide component owing to the chemical bonds with the zinc(oxy)hydroxide phase and conductive properties helps in electron transfer, leading to more efficient oxygen activation via the formation of superoxide ions. Elemental sulfur, zinc sulfide, sulfite, and sulfate are formed on the surface. The formation of sulfur compounds on the surface of zinc(oxy)hydroxide during the course of the breakthrough experiments and thus Zn(OH)(2)-ZnS heterojunctions can also contribute to the increased surface activity of our materials. The results show the superiority of graphite oxide in the formation of composites owing to its active surface chemistry and the possibility of interface bond formation, leading to an increase in the number of electron-transfer reactions.

The bandgap energy and thus the cutoff wavelength are similar to silicon; however, since the bandgap of Al0.7In0.3As0.3Sb0.7 is direct, its absorption depth is 5 to 10 times shorter than indirect-bandgap silicon, potentially enabling significantly higher operating bandwidths. In addition, unlike other III-V avalanche photodiodes that operate in the visible or near infrared, the excess noise factor is comparable to or below that of silicon, with a k-value of approximately 0.015. Furthermore, the wide array of absorber regions compatible with GaSb substrates enable cutoff wavelengths ranging from 1 Î¼m to 12 Î¼m.\n\nX-ray spectroscopy with silicon pin and avalanche photo diodes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDesai, U.

About one keV resolution was achieved at room temperature for both the PIN and APD detectors for soft x rays (1 to 20 keV). Commercially available, low power (18 mV), low noise, hybrid preamplifiers, were used. These photodiodes were also coupled to CsI(TI) scintillator and obtained about 6 resolution at 662 keV. The photodiode frequency response matches well with the emission spectrum of the CsI(TI) scintillator providing good spectral resolution and a higher signal than NaI(TI) when viewed by conventional photomultipliers. A PIN-CsI(TI) combination provides a low energy threshold of around 60 keV while for the APD-CsI(TI) it is 15 keV.\n\nSilicon avalanche photodiode detector circuit for Nd:YAG laser scattering\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHsieh, C.

A charge-sensitive preamplifier has been developed for minimizing the noise contribution from the detector electronics. Signal levels as low as 20 photoelectrons (S/N=1) can be detected. Measurements show that both the signal and the variance of the signal vary linearly with the input light level over the range of interest, indicating Poisson statistics. The signal is processed using a 100 ns delay line and a differential amplifier which subtracts the low-frequency background light component. The background signal is amplified with a computer-controlled variable gain amplifier and is used for an estimate of the measurement error, calibration, and Zeff measurements of the plasma. The signal processing has been analyzed using a theoretical model to aid the system design and establish the procedure for data error analysis.\n\nAn Array of Layers in Silicon Sulfides: Chain-like and Ground State Structures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlonso-Lanza, TomÃ¡s; Ayuela, AndrÃ©s; Aguilera-Granja, Faustino\n\nWhile much is known about isoelectronic materials related to carbon nanostructures, such as boron nitride layers and nanotubes, rather less is known about equivalent silicon based materials. Following the recent discovery of phosphorene, we here discuss isoelectronic silicon monosulfide monolayers. We describe a set of anisotropic ground state structures that clearly have a high stability with respect to the near isotropic silicon monosulfide monolayers. The source of the layer anisotropy is related to the presence of Si-S double chains linked by some Si-Si covalent bonds, which lie at the core of the increased stability, together with a remarkable spd hybridization on Si. The involvement of d orbitals brings more variety to silicon-sulfide based nanostructures that are isoelectronic to phosphorene, which could be relevant for future applications, adding extra degrees of freedom.

The evolution process, phase and crystal growth were investigated by thermogravimetry (TG), X-Ray diffraction (XRD) along with thermodynamic calculation and scanning electron microscopy-Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), respectively, to interpret the formation mechanism of ZnS species. It was found that ZnS was initially generated at about 450âÂ°C and then the reaction prevailed at about 600âÂ°C. The generated Fe x S would dissolve into ZnS and then form (Zn, Fe)S compound in form of Fe 2 Zn 3 S 5 when temperature increased to about 750âÂ°C. This obviously accelerated ZnS phase formation and growth. In addition, it was known that increasing of ZnO dosage had few effects on the decomposition behavior of FeS 2 . Then, flotation tests of different zinc oxide materials before and after treatment were performed to further confirm that the flotation performances of the treated materials could be obviously improved. Finally, a scheme diagram was proposed to regular its application to mineral processing. It was systematically illustrated that different types of ZnS species needed to be synthetized when sulfidization roasting-flotation process was carried out to treat zinc oxide materials.\n\nUltrasound-assisted analyte extraction for the determination of sulfate and elemental sulfur in zinc sulfide by different liquid chromatography techniques.\n\nPubMed\n\nDash, K; Thangavel, S; Krishnamurthy, N V; Rao, S V; Karunasagar, D; Arunachalam, J\n\n2005-04-01\n\nThe speciation and determination of sulfate (SO4(2-)) and elemental sulfur (S degree) in zinc sulfide (ZnS) using ion-chromatography (IC) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) respectively is described. Three sample pretreatment approaches were employed with the aim of determining sulfate: (i) conventional water extraction of the analyte; (ii) solid-liquid aqueous extraction with an ultrasonic probe; and (iii) elimination of the zinc sulfide matrix via ion-exchange dissolution (IED). The separation of sulfate was carried out by an anion-exchange column (IonPac AS17), followed by suppressed conductivity detection. Elemental sulfur was extracted ultrasonically from the acid treated sample solution into chloroform and separated on a reversed phase HPLC column equipped with a diode array detector (DAD) at 264 nm. The achievable solid detection limits for sulfate and sulfur were 35 and 10 microg g(-1) respectively.\n\nDeposition of zinc sulfide thin films by chemical bath process\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOladeji, Isaiah O.; Chow, Lee\n\n1996-11-01\n\nDeposition of high quality zinc sulfide (ZnS) thin film over a large area is required if it is to be effectively used in electroluminescent devices, solar cells, and other optoelectronic devices. Of all deposition techniques, chemical bath deposition (CBD) is the least costly technique that meets the above requirements. Recently it is found that the growth of ZnS film, of thickness less than 100 nm in a single dip, by CBD is facilitated by the use of ammonia and hydrazine as complexing agents. Here we report that the thickness of the deposited ZnS film can be increased if ammonium salt is used as a buffer. We also present an analytical study to explain our results and to further understand the ZnS growth process in CBD.\n\nStudy of silicon doped with zinc ions and annealed in oxygen\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPrivezentsev, V.

Hemimorphite, a zinc hydroxyl silicate hydrate, is a significant source of Zn and Pb. It is difficult to obtain Zn and Pb from the hemimorphite using traditional technology. In this work, for the first time, sulfidation roasting of hemimorphite with pyrite was studied for the enrichment of Zn and Pb by a flotation process. Four stages of sulfidation roasting were determined based on x-ray diffraction and thermogravimetry analysis. Then, the effects of sulfidation temperature, pyrite dosage and reaction time on the sulfidation percentages were investigated at the laboratory scale. The experimental results showed that the sulfidation percentages of Pb and Zn were as high as 98.08% and 90.55% under optimum conditions, respectively. Finally, a flotation test was performed to enrich Zn and Pb in the sulfidation product. A flotation concentrate with 8.78% Zn and 9.25% Pb was obtained, and the recovery of Zn and Pb reached 56.14% and 75.94%, respectively.\n\n3D Silicon Coincidence Avalanche Detector (3D-SiCAD) for charged particle detection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVignetti, M.

SPADs have the advantage of featuring single photon sensitivity with timing resolution in the picoseconds range. Nevertheless, their relatively high Dark Count Rate (DCR) is a major issue for charged particle detection, especially when it is much higher than the incoming particle rate. To tackle this issue, we have developed a 3D Silicon Coincidence Avalanche Detector (3D-SiCAD). This novel device implements two vertically aligned SPADs featuring on-chip electronics for the detection of coincident avalanche events occurring on both SPADs. Such a coincidence detection mode allows an efficient discrimination of events related to an incoming charged particle (producing a quasi-simultaneous activation of both SPADs) from dark counts occurring independently on each SPAD. A 3D-SiCAD detector prototype has been fabricated in CMOS technology adopting a 3D flip-chip integration technique, and the main results of its characterization are reported in this work. The particle detection efficiency and noise rejection capability for this novel device have been evaluated by means of a Î²- strontium-90 radioactive source. Moreover the impact of the main operating parameters (i.e. the hold-off time, the coincidence window duration, the SPAD excess bias voltage) over the particle detection efficiency has been studied. Measurements have been performed with different Î²- particles rates and show that a 3D-SiCAD device outperforms single SPAD detectors: the former is indeed capable to detect particle rates much lower than the individual DCR observed in a single SPAD-based detectors (i.e. 2 to 3 orders of magnitudes lower).\n\nStudy on the surface sulfidization behavior of smithsonite at high temperature\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLv, Jin-fang; Tong, Xiong; Zheng, Yong-xing; Xie, Xian; Wang, Cong-bing\n\n2018-04-01\n\nSurface sulfidization behavior of smithsonite at high temperature was investigated by X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) along with thermodynamic calculation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The XRD and thermodynamic analyses indicated that the smithsonite was decomposed into zincite at high temperatures. After introducing a small amount of pyrite, artificial sulfides were formed at surface of the obtained zincite. The XPS analyses revealed that the sulfide species including zinc sulfide and zinc disulfide were generated at the zincite surface. The EPMA analyses demonstrated that the film of sulfides was unevenly distributed at the zincite surface. The average concentration of elemental sulfur at the sample surface increased with increasing of pyrite dosage. A suitable mole ratio of FeS2 to ZnCO3 for the surface thermal modification was determined to be about 0.3. These findings can provide theoretical support for improving the process during which the zinc recovery from refractory zinc oxide ores is achieved by xanthate flotation.\n\nMaterial and Energy Flows Associated with Select Metals in GREET 2.

We also analyzed the production of solar- and semiconductor-grade silicon. We described new additions to and expansions of the data in GREET 2. In some cases, we used operating permits and sustainability reports to estimate the material and energy flows for molybdenum, platinum, and nickel, while for zinc and silicon we relied on information provided in the literature.\n\nA lithium-ion sulfur battery based on a carbon-coated lithium-sulfide cathode and an electrodeposited silicon-based anode.\n\nPubMed\n\nAgostini, Marco; Hassoun, Jusef; Liu, Jun; Jeong, Moongook; Nara, Hiroki; Momma, Toshiyuki; Osaka, Tetsuya; Sun, Yang-Kook; Scrosati, Bruno\n\n2014-07-23\n\nIn this paper, we report a lithium-ion battery employing a lithium sulfide cathode and a silicon-based anode. The high capacity of the silicon anode and the high efficiency and cycling rate of the lithium sulfide cathode allowed optimal full cell balance. We show in fact that the battery operates with a very stable capacity of about 280 mAh g(-1) at an average voltage of 1.4 V. To the best of our knowledge, this battery is one of the rare examples of lithium-metal-free sulfur battery. Considering the high theoretical capacity of the employed electrodes, we believe that the battery here reported may be of potential interest as high-energy, safe, and low-cost power source for electric vehicles.\n\nA silicon avalanche photodiode detector circuit for Nd:YAG laser scattering\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHsieh, C.-L.; Haskovec, J.; Carlstrom, T. N.; Deboo, J. C.; Greenfield, C. M.; Snider, R. T.; Trost, P.\n\n1990-06-01\n\nA silicon avalanche photodiode with an internal gain of about 50 to 100 is used in a temperature controlled environment to measure the Nd:YAG laser Thomson scattered spectrum in the wavelength range from 700 to 1150 nm. A charge sensitive preamplifier was developed for minimizing the noise contribution from the detector electronics. Signal levels as low as 20 photoelectrons (S/N = 1) can be detected. Measurements show that both the signal and the variance of the signal vary linearly with the input light level over the range of interest, indicating Poisson statistics. The signal is processed using a 100 ns delay line and a differential amplifier which subtracts the low frequency background light component. The background signal is amplified with a computer controlled variable gain amplifier and is used for an estimate of the measurement error, calibration, and Z sub eff measurements of the plasma. The signal processing was analyzed using a theoretical model to aid the system design and establish the procedure for data error analysis.\n\nSelective Sulfidation of Lead Smelter Slag with Pyrite and Flotation Behavior of Synthetic ZnS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHan, Junwei; Liu, Wei; Wang, Dawei; Jiao, Fen; Zhang, Tianfu; Qin, Wenqing\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe selective sulfidation of lead smelter slag with pyrite in the presence of carbon and Na salts, and the flotation behavior of synthetic ZnS were studied. The effects of temperature, time, pyrite dosage, Na salts, and carbon additions were investigated based on thermodynamic calculation, and correspondingly, the growth mechanism of ZnS particles was studied at high temperatures. The results indicated that the zinc in lead smelter slag was selectively converted into zinc sulfides by sulfidation roasting. The sulfidation degree of zinc was increased until the temperature, time, pyrite, and carbon dosages reached their optimum values, under which it was more than 95 pct. The growth of ZnS particles largely depended upon roasting temperature, and the ZnS grains were significantly increased above 1373 K (1100 Â°C) due to the formation of a liquid phase. After the roasting, the zinc sulfides generated had a good floatability, and 88.34 pct of zinc was recovered by conventional flotation.\n\nAcid production potentials of massive sulfide minerals and lead-zinc mine tailings: a medium-term study.\n\nPubMed\n\nÃelebi, Emin Ender; Ãncel, Mehmet Salim; Kobya, Mehmet\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWeathering of sulfide minerals is a principal source of acid generation. To determine acid-forming potentials of sulfide-bearing materials, two basic approaches named static and kinetic tests are available. Static tests are short-term, and easily undertaken within a few days and in a laboratory. In contrast, kinetic tests are long-term procedures and mostly carried out on site. In this study, experiments were conducted over a medium-term period of 2 months, not as short as static tests and also not as long as kinetic tests. As a result, pH and electrical conductivity oscillations as a function of time, acid-forming potentials and elemental contents of synthetically prepared rainwater leachates of massive sulfides and sulfide-bearing lead-zinc tailings from abandoned and currently used deposition areas have been determined. Although the lowest final pH of 2.70 was obtained in massive pyrite leachate, massive chalcopyrite leachate showed the highest titrable acidity of 1.764 g H 2 SO 4 /L. On the other hand, a composite of currently deposited mine tailings showed no acidic characteristic with a final pH of 7.77. The composite abandoned mine tailing leachate had a final pH of 6.70, close to the final pH of massive galena and sphalerite leachates, and produced a slight titrable acidity of 0.130 g H 2 SO 4 /L.\n\nSilicon photon-counting avalanche diodes for single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMichalet, Xavier; Ingargiola, Antonino; Colyer, Ryan A.; Scalia, Giuseppe; Weiss, Shimon; Maccagnani, Piera; Gulinatti, Angelo; Rech, Ivan; Ghioni, Massimo\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSolution-based single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is a powerful experimental tool with applications in cell biology, biochemistry and biophysics. The basic feature of this technique is to excite and collect light from a very small volume and work in a low concentration regime resulting in rare burst-like events corresponding to the transit of a single molecule. Detecting photon bursts is a challenging task: the small number of emitted photons in each burst calls for high detector sensitivity. Bursts are very brief, requiring detectors with fast response time and capable of sustaining high count rates. Finally, many bursts need to be accumulated to achieve proper statistical accuracy, resulting in long measurement time unless parallelization strategies are implemented to speed up data acquisition. In this paper we will show that silicon single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) best meet the needs of single-molecule detection. We will review the key SPAD parameters and highlight the issues to be addressed in their design, fabrication and operation. After surveying the state-of-the-art SPAD technologies, we will describe our recent progress towards increasing the throughput of single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy in solution using parallel arrays of SPADs. The potential of this approach is illustrated with single-molecule FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer measurements.

The sulfidation treatment was carried out for five molten incineration fly ashes (Fly ash-A to Fly ash-E) by contacting each fly ash with Na(2)S solution for a period of 10 min to 6h. The initial molar ratio of S(2-) to Me(2+) was adjusted to 1.20. The conversion of heavy metals to metal sulfides was evaluated by measuring the S(2-) residual concentrations using an ion selective electrode. The formation of metal sulfides was studied by XRD and SEM-EDS analyses. In the case of Fly ash-A to Fly ash-D, more than 79% of heavy metals of zinc, lead and copper was converted to metal sulfides within the contacting period of 0.5h owing to a fast conversion of metal chlorides to metal sulfides. By contrast, the conversion of about 35% was achieved for Fly ash-E within the same contacting period, which was attributed to a high content of metal oxides. Further, the S(2-) to Me(2+) molar ratio was reduced to 1.00 to minimize Na(2)S consumption and the conversions obtained within the contacting period of 0.5h varied from 76% for Fly ash-D to 91% for Fly ash-C. Finally, soluble salts such as NaCl and KCl were removed during the sulfidation treatment, which brought about a significant enrichment in metals content by a factor varying from 1.5 for Fly ash-D to 4.9 for Fly ash-A.\n\nMeasurement of nuclear resonant scattering on 61Ni with fast scintillation detector using proportional-mode silicon avalanche photodiode\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nInoue, Keisuke; Kobayashi, Yasuhiro; Yoda, Yoshitaka; Koshimizu, Masanori; Nishikido, Fumihiko; Haruki, Rie; Kishimoto, Shunji\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe developed a new scintillation timing detector using a proportional-mode silicon avalanche photodiode (Si-APD) for synchrotron radiation nuclear resonant scattering. We report on the nuclear forward scattering measurement on 61Ni with a prototype detector using a lead-loaded plastic scintillator (EJ-256, 3 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness), mounted on a proportional-mode Si-APD. Using synchrotron X-rays of 67.41 keV, we successfully measured the time spectra of nuclear forward scattering on 61Ni enriched metal foil and 61Ni86V14 alloy. The prototype detector confirmed the expected dynamical beat structure with a time resolution of 0.53 ns (FWHM).\n\nDevelopment of a lithium fluoride zinc sulfide based neutron multiplicity counter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCowles, Christian; Behling, Spencer; Baldez, Phoenix; Folsom, Micah; Kouzes, Richard; Kukharev, Vladislav; Lintereur, Azaree; Robinson, Sean; Siciliano, Edward; Stave, Sean; Valdez, Patrick\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe feasibility of a full-scale lithium fluoride zinc sulfide (LiF/ZnS) based neutron multiplicity counter has been demonstrated. The counter was constructed of modular neutron detecting stacks that each contain five sheets of LiF/ZnS interleaved between six sheets of wavelength shifting plastic with a photomultiplier tube on each end. Twelve such detector stacks were placed around a sample chamber in a square arrangement with lithiated high-density polyethylene blocks in the corners to reflect high-energy neutrons and capture low-energy neutrons. The final system design was optimized via modeling and small-scale test. Measuring neutrons from a 252Cf source, the counter achieved a 36% neutron detection efficiency (É) and an 11 . 7 Î¼s neutron die-away time (Ï) for a doubles figure-of-merit (É2 / Ï) of 109. This is the highest doubles figure-of-merit measured to-date for a 3He-free neutron multiplicity counter.\n\nA low-cost, ultra-fast and ultra-low noise preamplifier for silicon avalanche photodiodes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGasmi, Khaled\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAn ultra-fast and ultra-low noise preamplifier for amplifying the fast and weak electrical signals generated by silicon avalanche photodiodes has been designed and developed. It is characterized by its simplicity, compactness, reliability and low cost of construction. A very wide bandwidth of 300 MHz, a very good linearity from 1âkHz to 280 MHz, an ultra-low noise level at the input of only 1.7 nV Hz-1/2 and a very good stability are its key features. The compact size (70âmmââÃââ90âmm) and light weight (45âg), as well as its excellent characteristics, make this preamplifier very competitive compared to any commercial preamplifier. The preamplifier, which is a main part of the detection system of a homemade laser remote sensing system, has been successfully tested. In addition, it is versatile and can be used in any optical detection system requiring high speed and very low noise electronics.\n\nReference Data for the Density and Viscosity of Liquid Cadmium, Cobalt, Gallium, Indium, Mercury, Silicon, Thallium, and Zinc\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAssael, Marc J.; Armyra, Ivi J.; Brillo, Juergen; Stankus, Sergei V.; Wu, Jiangtao; Wakeham, William A.\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe available experimental data for the density and viscosity of liquid cadmium, cobalt, gallium, indium, mercury, silicon, thallium, and zinc have been critically examined with the intention of establishing both a density and a viscosity standard. All experimental data have been categorized into primary and secondary data according to the quality of measurement, the technique employed and the presentation of the data, as specified by a series of criteria. The proposed standard reference correlations for the density of liquid cadmium, cobalt, gallium, indium, silicon, thallium, and zinc are characterized by percent deviations at the 95% confidence level of 0.6, 2.1, 0.4, 0.5, 2.2, 0.9, and 0.7, respectively. In the case of mercury, since density reference values already exist, no further work was carried out. The standard reference correlations for the viscosity of liquid cadmium, cobalt, gallium, indium, mercury, silicon, thallium, and zinc are characterized by percent deviations at the 95% confidence level of 9.4, 14.0, 13.5, 2.1, 7.3, 15.7, 5.1, and 9.3, respectively.\n\nAvalanche diode having reduced dark current and method for its manufacture\n\nDOEpatents\n\nDavids, Paul; Starbuck, Andrew Lee; Pomerene, Andrew T.

The detector's characteristics are simulated via a full process simulation to obtain the required doping profiles which demonstrate the desired operational characteristics of high breakdown voltage (500 V) and a gain of 10 at 200 V reverse bias for X-ray detection. The first low gain avalanche detectors fabricated by Micron Semiconductor Ltd are presented. The doping profiles of the multiplication junctions were measured with SIMS and reproduced by simulating the full fabrication process which enabled further development of the manufacturing process. The detectors are 300 Î¼m thick p-type silicon with a resistivity of 8.5 kÎ©cm, which fully depletes at 116 V. The current characteristics are presented and demonstrate breakdown voltages in excess of 500 V and a current density of 40 to 100 nAcmâ2 before breakdown measured at 20oC. The gain of the LGAD has been measured with a red laser (660 nm) and shown to be between 9 and 12 for an external bias voltage range from 150 V to 300 V.\n\nLeaching of Zinc Sulfide by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans: Experiments with a Controlled Redox Potential Indicate No Direct Bacterial Mechanism\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFowler, T. A.; Crundwell, F. K.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe role of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans in bacterial leaching of mineral sulfides is controversial. Much of the controversy is due to the fact that the solution conditions, especially the concentrations of ferric and ferrous ions, change during experiments. The role of the bacteria would be more easily discernible if the concentrations of ferric and ferrous ions were maintained at set values throughout the experimental period. In this paper we report results obtained by using the constant redox potential apparatus described previously (P. I. Harvey and F. K. Crundwell, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63:2586â2592, 1997). This apparatus is designed to control the redox potential in the leaching compartment of an electrolytic cell by reduction or oxidation of dissolved iron. By controlling the redox potential the apparatus maintains the concentrations of ferrous and ferric ions at their initial values. Experiments were conducted in the presence of T. ferrooxidans and under sterile conditions. Analysis of the conversion of zinc sulfide in the absence of the bacteria and analysis of the conversion of zinc sulfate in the presence of the bacteria produced the same results. This indicates that the only role of the bacteria under the conditions used is regeneration of ferric ions in solution. In this work we found no evidence that there is a direct mechanism for bacterial leaching.

Ketoconazole inhibited growth at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 micrograms/ml. For zinc pyrithione and selenium sulfide higher concentrations were needed. In a guinea pig model the efficacy of treatment with four shampoos (Nizoral [Jansen], EDS Zinc [Schering], Zinkan [Lederle], and Selsun [Abbott]) was compared. The animals were inoculated for 7 consecutive days on intact skin. The lesions were scored for erythema, folliculitis, and hyperkeratosis 24 hours after the last inoculation and after treatment. Final evaluations were made 13 days after infection (10 days after last shampoo application). Treatment with undiluted and diluted (1:10) shampoos showed consistently superior clinical and mycologic results for Nizoral shampoo. None of the shampoos produced side effects.\n\nMechanism study on the sulfidation of ZnO with sulfur and iron oxide at high temperature\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHan, Junwei; Liu, Wei; Zhang, Tianfu; Xue, Kai; Li, Wenhua; Jiao, Fen; Qin, Wenqing\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe mechanism of ZnO sulfidation with sulfur and iron oxide at high temperatures was studied. The thermodynamic analysis, sulfidation behavior of zinc, phase transformations, morphology changes, and surface properties were investigated by HSC 5.0 combined with FactSage 7.0, ICP, XRD, optical microscopy coupled with SEM-EDS, and XPS. The results indicate that increasing temperature and adding iron oxide can not only improve the sulfidation of ZnO but also promote the formation and growth of ZnS crystals. Fe2O3 captured the sulfur in the initial sulfidation process as iron sulfides, which then acted as the sulfurizing agent in the late period, thus reducing sulfur escape at high temperatures. The addition of carbon can not only enhance the sulfidation but increase sulfur utilization rate and eliminate the generation of SO2. The surfaces of marmatite and synthetic zinc sulfides contain high oxygen due to oxidation and oxygen adsorption. Hydroxyl easily absorbs on the surface of iron-bearing zinc sulfide (Zn1-xFexS). The oxidation of synthetic Zn1-xFexS is easier than marmatite in air.\n\nMechanism study on the sulfidation of ZnO with sulfur and iron oxide at high temperature\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHan, Junwei; Liu, Wei; Zhang, Tianfu; Xue, Kai; Li, Wenhua; Jiao, Fen; Qin, Wenqing\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe mechanism of ZnO sulfidation with sulfur and iron oxide at high temperatures was studied.

They have high modulation frequencies into the GHz range and can be fabricated to sub-micron dimensions. Due to subsurface light generation in the silicon device itself, and the high refractive index differences between silicon and the device environment, the exiting light radiation has interesting dispersion characteristics. Three junction micro p+-np+ Silicon Avalanche based Light Emitting Devices (Si Av LEDs) have been analyzed in terms of dispersion characteristics, generally resulting in different wavelengths of light (colors) being emitted at different angles and solid angles from the surfaces of these devices. The emission wavelength is in the 450 - 850 nm range. The devices are of micron dimension and operate at 8 - 10V, 1Î¼A - 2mA. The emission spot sizes are about 1 micron square. Emission intensities are up to 500 nW.Î¼m-2. The observed dispersion characteristics range from 0.05 degrees per nm per degree at emission angle of 5 degrees, to 0.15 degrees per nm at emission angles of 30 degrees. It is believed that the dispersion characteristics can find interesting and futuristic on-chip electro-optic applications involving particularly a ranging from on chip micro optical wavelength dispersers, communication de-multiplexers, and novel bio-sensor applications. All of these could penetrate into the nanoscale dimensions.\n\nSelective Sulfidation of Lead Smelter Slag with Sulfur\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHan, Junwei; Liu, Wei; Wang, Dawei; Jiao, Fen; Qin, Wenqing\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe selective sulfidation of lead smelter slag with sulfur was studied. The effects of temperature, sulfur dosage, carbon, and Na salts additions were investigated based on thermodynamic calculation. The results indicated that more than 96 pct of zinc in the slag could be converted into sulfides. Increasing temperature, sulfur dosage, or Na salts dosage was conducive to the sulfidation of the zinc oxides in the slag. High temperature and excess Na salts would result in the more consumption of carbon and sulfur. Carbon addition not only promoted the selective sulfidation but reduced the sulfur dosage and eliminated the generation of SO2. Iron oxides had a buffering role on the sulfur efficient utilization. The transformation of sphalerite to wurtzite was feasible under reducing condition at high temperature, especially above 1273 K (1000 Â°C). The growth of ZnS particles largely depended upon the roasting temperature. They were significantly increased when the temperature was above 1273 K (1000 Â°C), which was attributed to the formation of a liquid phase.\n\nDevelopment of a lithium fluoride zinc sulfide based neutron multiplicity counter\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCowles, Christian; Behling, Spencer; Baldez, Phoenix\n\nHere, the feasibility of a full-scale lithium fluoride zinc sulfide (LiF/ZnS) based neutron multiplicity counter has been demonstrated.

Zn2SiO4 is the primary Zn phase in willemite. Zn4Si2O7(OH)2(H2O), the main Zn phase in hemimorphite, transforms into Zn2SiO4 at temperatures above 600 Â°C. To enrich the Zn in willemite and hemimorphite, the Zn species should first be converted to ZnS. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the sulfidation reaction of Zn2SiO4 during roasting with pyrite is of vital important. In this study, the sulfidation behavior and reaction mechanisms of a Zn2SiO4-pyrite roasting system were determined using HSC 5.0 software, TG-FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, XPS and SEM-EDS. The results indicate that the sulfidation process can be divided into three steps: the decomposition of pyrite and formation of a sulfur-rich environment, the sulfur-induced migration of O2- and transformation of sulfur vapor, and the sulfidation reaction via oxygen-sulfur exchange. During the sulfidation roasting process, pyrite was converted to loose and porous Fe3O4, whereas Zn2SiO4 was transformed into ZnS and SiO2 in situ.

Epitaxially grown Ge-on-Si waveguide-coupled linear mode avalanche photodiodes with varying lateral multiplication regions and different charge implant dimensions are fabricated and their illuminated device characteristics and high-speed performance is measured. We report a record gain-bandwidth product of 432 GHz for our highest performing waveguide-coupled avalanche photodiode operating at 1510nm. Bit error rate measurements show operation with BER< 10 â12, in the range from â18.3 dBm to â12 dBm received optical powermoreÂ Â» into a 50 Î© load and open eye diagrams with 13 Gbps pseudo-random data at 1550 nm.Â«Â less\n\nAvalanche ecology and large magnitude avalanche events: Glacier National Park, Montana, USA\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFagre, Daniel B.; Peitzsch, Erich H.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nLarge magnitude snow avalanches play an important role ecologically in terms of wildlife habitat, vegetation diversity, and sediment transport within a watershed. Ecological effects from these infrequent avalanches can last for decades. Understanding the frequency of such large magnitude avalanches is also critical to avalanche forecasting for the Going-to-the-Sun Road (GTSR). In January 2009, a large magnitude avalanche cycle occurred in and around Glacier National Park, Montana. The study site is the Little Granite avalanche path located along the GTSR. The study is designed to quantify change in vegetative cover immediately after a large magnitude event and document ecological response over a multi-year period. GPS field mapping was completed to determine the redefined perimeter of the avalanche path. Vegetation was inventoried using modified U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis plots, cross sections were taken from over 100 dead trees throughout the avalanche path, and an avalanche chronology was developed. Initial results indicate that the perimeter of this path was expanded by 30%. The avalanche travelled approximately 1200 vertical meters and 3 linear kilometers. Stands of large conifers as old as 150 years were decimated by the avalanche, causing a shift in dominant vegetation types in many parts of the avalanche path. Woody debris is a major ground cover up to 3 m in depth on lower portions of the avalanche path and will likely affect tree regrowth. Monitoring and measuring the post-avalanche vegetation recovery of this particular avalanche path provides a unique dataset for determining the ecological role of avalanches in mountain landscapes.\n\nSolid-state flat panel imager with avalanche amorphous selenium\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScheuermann, James R.; Howansky, Adrian; Goldan, Amir H.; Tousignant, Olivier; LevÃ©ille, SÃ©bastien; Tanioka, K.; Zhao, Wei\n\n2016-03-01\n\nActive matrix flat panel imagers (AMFPI) have become the dominant detector technology for digital radiography and fluoroscopy. For low dose imaging, electronic noise from the amorphous silicon thin film transistor (TFT) array degrades imaging performance. We have fabricated the first prototype solid-state AMFPI using a uniform layer of avalanche amorphous selenium (a-Se) photoconductor to amplify the signal to eliminat"
