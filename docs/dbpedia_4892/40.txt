Lenny Rodrigues' close-range header opened the scoring for Mohun Bagan after just 15 minutes at Mong Kok Stadium before South China's Che Runqiu was sent-off less than a minute later after picking up two yellow cards in quick succession. And after Sony Norde and Cornell Glen increased Mohun Bagan's lead before half-time, Jeje Lalpekhlua sealed the win in the closing stages as Sanjoy Sen's side added to February's opening 5-2 home win over Maldivian outfit Maziya Sports & Recreation Club, while South China, quarter-finalists in 2015, suffered a second consecutive defeat having lost 2-1 to Yangon United in Myanmar.(Imaginechina via AP Images)
