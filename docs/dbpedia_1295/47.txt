McColm: What does the surname McColm mean?

The surname McColm is of Scottish origin, originating from the Scottish region of Galloway. The name is derived from the Gaelic personal name "Colm" or "Columba," which means "dove." This personal name was popular due to St. Columba, a 6th-century saint who was one of the twelve apostles of Ireland and the patron saint of Derry, and whose missionary work in the Scottish highlands led to him being regarded as one of Scotland's three chief saints along with St. Patrick and St. Bridget. The "Mc" in McColm represents the Gaelic prefix "Mac" which translates to "son of." Therefore, the name McColm can be interpreted to mean "son of Colm" or "son of Columba." Over time, the name has various spellings including McColm, Malcolm, Malcom, and Makcalum, among others. There are multiple families with the McColm surname, and each could potentially have a unique history associated with it. However, they all share the heritage of the name's original Gaelic meaning.
