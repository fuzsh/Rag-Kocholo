The surname McColm was first found in Argyllshire (Gaelic erra Ghaidheal), the region of western Scotland corresponding roughly with the ancient Kingdom of DÃ¡l Riata, in the Strathclyde region of Scotland, now part of the Council Area of Argyll and Bute, where they quickly attained the status of Clan. Their ancient Clan seat was at Poltalloch near Loch Craignish.

The related Clan Calum is said to have been from Ariskeodnish. One of the earliest records of the name was Reginald MacCallum of Corbarron who was made the hereditary constable of Craignish Castle in 1414. Sir Duncan Campbell granted him lands in Craignish and on Loch Avich. This arrangement demonstrates the strong alliance between the MacCallums and the Campbells of Argyll; an arrangement which made them deadly foes of the MacDonalds.

In 1647, Sir Alexander MacDonald killed Zacharie MacCallum, a supporter of the Campbell Chief, in battle at Ederline. In the 17th century, another Zachary Maccallum was bequeathed the Cobarron lands by the last of that branch.
