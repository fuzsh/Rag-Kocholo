REYNOLDS (1856 - ~1901) to Joseph Green REDDING (1892 - 1952) to Joseph George REDDING (1921 - 1989) to Joseph Dwayne REDDING (1945 - ) to me.\n\nJoseph Green REYNOLDS moved his family from MO (1850) through KS (1860) and to Pilot Point, Denton Co., TX (1870). His 1st cousin Claybourne BURNETT (son of Samuel, Sr.) and his family were in Bates county, MO in 1850 then were living at Pilot Point in 1860 but had moved to Montague Co., TX by 1870. Joseph Green REYNOLDS also moved to Montague Co. Joseph had another daughter, Eliza Jane REYNOLDS, who married Clayborn's son Madison Monroe BURNETT and had their first child by 1884 in Montague Co. So, specifically my query is searching for any tidbits on Joseph Green REYNOLDS and his descendants. His wife, Susan Elizabeth FINDLEY MURRAY REYNOLDS, died in 1877 in Denton County, so I am also trying to find her tombstone. Joseph Green REYNOLDS was in the 1900 Montague Co. census, with my gggrandmother Nancy REYNOLDS REDDING, ggrandfather Joseph Green REDDING and two other siblings living with him. He supposedly died in Purcell, McClain Co. OK, in 1905, but I have not found a tombstone there either. Most of the rest of his sons and daughters ended up around Norman, OK, in the counties of Cleveland, McClain, and Garvin.

My father was Jerry Burnett Minter, Sr. Until today I had no idea of my lineage reaching beyond Henrietta, TX where my grandparents are buried. I knew only that my great-grandparents had moved from Missouri to the Denton, Texas area. You have filled in for me some enormous blanks and extended my heritage all the way back to Scotland for which I am profoundly grateful. I have never had the time to engage my genealogy in a concentrated way; your work has done that for me!

Amazing how much information is out there and how fast connections are being made. Mother left father when I was 6 weeks old, so I have minimal information about my father's family. His mother was Catherine Burnett Gibson Bell VAN DEUSEN (1873 - 1933 or so). Her parents were Henry L. BURNETT and Sarah Lansing BURNETT of Canandaigue, New York. I'm assuming that I should be starting out by talking to the local historical society in Canandaigue. I've already talked to the Canon City, CO group where Catherine moved to in 1902. I can already see that solving family mysteries could get to be addictive.
