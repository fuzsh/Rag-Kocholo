I was born in, and still live in Australia. There are McColms spread right across our country. I believe that two McColm men sailed here from Scotland in search of gold, in the 1850's.\n\nDate: Tue Oct 22 14:05:34 2002\n\nName: Jean McWhirter\n\nE-mail:\n\nWebsite: http://site.domain/path'/\n\nComments: I find your Guest Book very interesting.

We are trying to find the parents of our gg gandfather Ira Curry Steele b 1814 or 1816 in Ohio. Family stories say he is scotch irish. Your John Ira Steeele and Ira John Steele perked my interest because of the naming tradition. If anyone could provide more information about David Steele it would be great. Keep up the good work all you workers.
