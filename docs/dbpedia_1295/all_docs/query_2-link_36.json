        "text": "This is Our Family: Tara Mallen, Keith Kupferer and Katherine Mallen Kupferer on “Ghostlight”\n\nWhen it comes to monumentally euphoric moviegoing experiences in 2024, Kelly O’Sullivan and Alex Thompson have set a mightily high bar with their latest crowd-pleaser, “Ghostlight.” Five years after helming one of my all-time favorite films, 2019’s “Saint Frances,” writer/co-director O’Sullivan and co-director/producer Thompson have […]\n\nUniquely Euphoric: Bridget Francis Harris and Virginia Alonso-Luis on “Places of Worship”\n\nEvery once in a while, I come across a film that feels as if it has been made especially for me. That happened most recently at this year’s joyous in-person installment of my wife Rebecca Martin Fagerholm’s Cinema Femme Short Film Festival held at Chicago’s […]\n\nShelter from the World: Iliana Zabeth on “House of Pleasures,” #MeToo in France and More\n\nOne of the finest female ensembles in recent years can be found in Bertrand Bonello’s 2011 masterwork, “House of Pleasures,” originally titled “L’Apollonide” in France, the name of the Parisian brothel where nearly every scene in the film takes place. “In a way, Bonello’s film […]\n\nAttracted to the Darkness: Sophia Adler on Her Pivotal Role in “Harlan Coben’s Shelter”\n\nIf there were any justice in the realm of film distribution, every member of the #MeToo movement would currently be the proud owner of a boxed set featuring four movies written and directed by New York-based auteur Deborah Kampmeier. Her 2003 debut, “Virgin,” starred Elisabeth […]\n\nI’m in the Wrong Story: Joanna Gleason on “The Grotto,” “Into the Woods” and More\n\n“Sometimes people leave you / Halfway through the wood / Do not let it grieve you / No one leaves for good / You are not alone / No one is alone” These poignant lyrics written by Stephen Sondheim for his 1987 masterpiece, the stage […]\n\nThe Poetry of Everyday Life: Brooke Westphal on “Young People”\n\nA film lasting only a few minutes has the potential to impact viewers in a way that is tantamount to a feature, and that is certainly the case with “Young People,” which marks the directorial debut of Brooke Westphal, a student at the University of […]\n\nRebecca Harrell Tickell on “Prancer,” “Regenerate Ojai” and “On Sacred Ground”\n\nWith over two feet of snow piled upon the driveway, I spent this past Christmas Eve with my wife, Cinema Femme founder Rebecca Martin Fagerholm, binging holiday perennials at her parents’ cozy home in Holland, Michigan. Well into the evening, we decided to watch a […]\n\nSlamdance 2023: Wendy McColm on Their Audacious Triumph, “Fuzzy Head”\n\n“To understand my work,” David Lynch once told a bewildered moviegoer in Chicago, “you must follow the emotion. Because if you follow the buttermilk, you’ll end up going to the dairy.” The same rule of thumb could be applied to writer/director Wendy McColm’s sophomore feature […]\n\nGotham Award Winner Gracija Filipović on Starring in Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović’s “Murina”\n\nOf all the categories at the Gotham Independent Film Awards, the one that voters seem to get right year after year is the one devoted to promising young talent. In past years, the Breakthrough Performer prize has gone to such indelible actors as Amy Adams […]\n\nGaysorn Thavat on Her Sublime Directorial Feature Debut, “The Justice of Bunny King”\n\nLike many moviegoers of my generation in the United States, I was first captivated by the breathtaking landscapes of New Zealand in Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy. Yet it wasn’t until I saw Niki Caro’s masterful “Whale Rider” upon its release two decades […]\n\nSundance 2022 Interview: Alli Haapasalo, Eleonoora Kauhanen, Linnea Leino and Aamu Milonoff on Girl Picture\n\nBringing back our Sundance interview for the film’s theater release today. One of my favorite movies I’ve seen at this year’s Sundance Film Festival is easily the Finnish coming-of-age drama, “Girl Picture,” directed by Alli Haapasalo. It is an unflinchingly honest, deeply moving and often […]\n\nNudity as a Political Statement: Eva Husson and Odessa Young on “Mothering Sunday”\n\nEva Husson’s “Mothering Sunday” is the sort of film that demands to be seen more than once in order to be fully appreciated. It plays on the senses like a hypnotic fever dream, mixing memory and fantasy until they are indiscernible from one another. Odessa […]"
