From performances staged in the camps and ghettos of Nazi-occupied Europe to adaptations of diaries and memoirs, from hidden children to postwar trials, and from one-person shows to musicals, Samantha looks at how theatre seeks to tell the human stories of the genocide, why they are needed today, and the difficult questions that actors and audiences face.\n\nâ\n\n18th October: Q&A with Dr Agnes Kaposi\n\nWe are privileged to have the opportunity to interview Dr. Agnes Kaposi following our matinee performance on the 18th of October. Born in Hungary in 1932, Dr. Kaposi's incredible journey includes surviving the Holocaust while laboring as a child in Austrian agricultural and armament camps. In the United Kingdom, she achieved great heights as an engineer, eventually becoming the third woman to be elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. Please join us for this important interview immediately after our performance, scheduled from 4:30 to 5:15.\n\nâ\n\n25th October: Q&A with the Cast and Crew\n\nâ\n\nAccess performance:\n\n31st October: Captioned performance\n\nâ\n\nAccess seats are available to book online.\n\nâWheelchair Accessible Spaces\n\nâFor each performance there is one wheelchair accessible space located in K5 with the companion seat K4.Please note that this is not on an aisle, if you wish to transfer it would be best to book one of the access and companion tickets. You can book here.\n\nâAccess and Companion Tickets\n\nThere are pre assigned access and companion seats located on the aisles on each side of the auditorium. These offer completely level access from the street. There is a gentle slope to the auditorium but no steps. You can book here.\n\nâ"
