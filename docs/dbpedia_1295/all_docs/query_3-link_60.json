        "text": "A Latta Confusion – A Surname Conundrum\n\nby\n\nHamish J. Thoms\n\nThis genealogical investigation first started by looking at the various surnames given to the children of Robert Thomas (1683 – 1740) and his wife Antonia McColm. Robert was the eldest son of Angus McIntosh (1645-1710) who had moved to Collairnie, sometime after 1692, possibly in the Parish of Dunbog or the Parish of Monimail. The move to Fife by Angus, the 10th dejure chief of Clan MacThomas, had been a natural one as there were existing family members already farming in the area. Previously, John McComie (b.circa 1588), the younger brother of Alexander McComie, the 6th dejure chief, had moved to Fife and presumably raised a family there, although we have not been able to uncover any pertinent records. In addition, some of the children and grandchildren of Alexander relocated to Ardonnachie, Fife and Hilton, near Monimail, Fife.(1)\n\nUnfortunately, there are no records that relate to the personal relationship between Angus McIntosh and his wife, Elizabeth Balfour and there are precious few other records pertaining to Angus, except for his name appearing in a number of sasines, his enrollment at St. Andrews, his activity and postings within the Church of Scotland, and his indictment (along with that of his father, John McIntosh) concerning the death of Robert Farquharson that went to trial in 1673. However, we have more detailed family information concerning his son, Robert who is buried in the churchyard at Monimail.\n\nHeadstone of Robert Thomas and Family Members, Monimail\n\nRobert and his wife had a number of children, the eldest of which was Ann, who we believe was born about 1716 or 1717. The only record found that relates to an Ann Thom, is detected in the Monimail Parish, where the father’s name is Robert Thom, but the mother’s name is listed as Isobel Sharp. It is dated January 20, 1717.\n\nMonimail Parish Record, January 20, 1717\n\nI am not convinced this record refers to the Ann we are looking for, but it is interesting because it reveals that there was another Robert Thom residing in the area. In the end, we may never be able to identify the baptismal record for Ann Thomas, owing to the fact that many of the rural church records are incomplete and fragmented for that period of time. In the Dunbog Parish, for example, baptismal records do not exist between December 1698 and January 1705, and mother’s names are not recorded until 1818. Marriages and banns are intermixed with baptisms until December of 1817, but there are no marriage entries from November 1719, to June 1721.\n\nWe can say, however, that most of the remaining baptisms recorded for Robert’s children took place in the Parish of Dunbog, Fife. Dunbog parish is bounded on the north by the River Tay, on the south by Monimail, on the east by Flisk and Creich, and on the west by the parish of Abdie.\n\nRobert’s name is first referenced in a family genealogical tract, commonly referred to as the Latta Manuscript.\n\n“Angus b. 1645 m. 1683 and had issue Robert b. 1683 and John 1689. Robert MacThomas or Thomas or ‘Tam’ b. 1683 m. 1715 Antonia, dau. of Wm. McColm or McThomas near Kirkmichael and had issue David 1721, Henry 1723, and ten others. David died an infant.”\n\nBaptismal Record of Elizabeth Thame – December 5, 1718\n\nRobert’s second child was Elizabeth, baptised on December 5, 1718, but here the father’s name is recorded as Robert Thame. More variations of the surname followed with subsequent births: Rachell Thom (1720), David Tham (1722), Henry Thom (1724), Robert Thom (1726), Antonia Thomas (1728), George Tam (1730), Agnes Thomas (1732), Mary Thomas (1734), and Isabel Thomas (1736). It would appear that the family finally adopted the surname of Thomas.\n\nThe Latta Manuscript, two small handwritten pages, penned sometime before February 1788, is the “holy grail” and single most important document in the Clan MacThomas archives. This document was examined in 1960 by Miss H E Peck MA, Keeper of the Archives at Cambridge University, who considered them to be a genuine 18th century document. The Latta MS was eventually admitted by the Lord Lyon, Sir Thomas Learney, as evidence in the MacThomas claim of Chiefship. The Latta Manuscript is signed “PL”, and this is presumed to have been Peter Latta, who died in 1788, tenant in Southfield, near Leuchars. His wife, Ann, was the eldest daughter of Robert Thomas in Balhelvie.\n\n“Balhelvie”\n\nIn the absence of other written evidence, the information provided by Latta formed the sole link between Robert Thomas and Angus McIntosh (or McComie, MacThomas) dejure 10th Chief.\n\nThe Latta Manuscript indicates that twelve children were born to Robert Thomas and Antonia McColm and it would be unusual for the author, Peter Latta, not to be familiar with the siblings of his wife, Ann Thomas. However, Burke’s Peerage suggests that there was a child named Janet, baptised on October 30, 1726, but as we have already discovered that Robert Tham was baptised on May 15, 1726, Janet’s dates are suspect. In addition, a thorough search of the National Records of Scotland uncovers no evidence of Janet’s birth or baptism. The other anomaly that exists concerns the birth of Isabel (or Isabella) Thomas, which we have ascribed to the year 1736 as reflected in Burke’s Peerage. Unfortunately a search in the National Records of Scotland has revealed no birth or baptismal records for Isabel. However we do find a record in the Parish of Flisk of her eventual marriage to Peter Brown on June 12, 1767.\n\nIsabel Thomas – Peter Brown Marriage – June 12, 1767, Flisk\n\nAttempting to obtain additional and accurate information about the marriage of Peter Latta to Ann Thomas has been somewhat of a challenge. The National Records of Scotland have parish records for both the death of Ann Thom who died June 13, 1786, and her husband, Peter Latta who died on February 9, 1788.\n\nNote that Ann’s surname is spelled “Thom” which we have decided was an early version of her maiden name and is a permutation of the later surname, Thomas. But she is described as a spouse of Peter Lato, not Latta.\n\nThe record of Peter Latta’s death is accurate as far we can gather, but when we attempt to find marriage records between the two individuals, we start to run into difficulty. A search of the National Records of Scotland produces a number of possibilities, but the names of the principles have changed.\n\nOn October 21, 1747, Patrick Lato of Leuchars Parish gave up his name for proclamation in order to marry Ann Thomas of Flisk Parish and on December 6 of that year, after no objections were forthcoming, they were married. As these individuals came from different parishes, it was likely that banns (2) were announced in both venues, and therefore we find another proclamation within the same time frame from the parish of Leuchars.\n\nUnder the date of October 24, 1747, the proclamation shows the contracted parties as Patrick Latto of Leuchars, and Ann Tam of Flisk. Is this just a transcription error, or is it indicative of the transmutability of names in those days? Or are we looking at different individuals ? Genealogist Geoffrey Latta, who has compiled Latta and Latto names (and variations of these) provides the following insight:\n\n“Prior to 1800 the name is spelled haphazardly by the clerks or clergy registering life events at the parish level. Given the general lack of literacy, those completing the records made the choice on spelling. If the same family moved from one parish to another or if a new clerk arrived in a given parish, the spelling would frequently change. From the early years of the nineteenth century, spelling became more standard. In Ayrshire, the accepted spelling became Latta and in Fifeshire and Angus, it became Latto, although with exceptions in both cases.“\n\nIn addition to this problem of flexibility in surname, we may also have the additional confusion of a change in Christian names. If that is the case, then we would have some difficulty in identifying any offspring from that union. Below is a list of possible children from the union of Peter (Patrick) Latta (Latto) and Ann Thom derived from FamilySearch.\n\nOne of the vital and final pieces of information we have concerning Peter Latta and Ann Thom can be found in Leuchars Churchyard, where there lies a monument inscribed as follow:\n\nAs a child of Peter (Patrick) and Ann, the most likely individual that corresponds to the information we have on hand is one Isobel Latto, born in Leuchars, 1757.\n\nBaptismal Record of Isobel Latto – Leuchars, 18 September, 1757\n\nThis genealogical investigation has been a provocative one, and it has inevitably led us to draw some conclusions. As a result of this scrutiny, it is entirely likely that Peter Latta and Patrick Latto are the same individual. This research has also led to some unanswered questions and some anomalies in names and chronology. But it has also provided uncharted areas that require further research. In our efforts to uncover documents relating to this subject matter, Grahame Thom believes he may have discovered a reference to John Thom (b. 1689), the youngest son of Angus McIntosh and younger brother to Robert.\n\nMarriage Record of John Thom & Isobel Alison – Monimail, 6 August, 1715\n\nThis John Thom, who married Isobel Alison, might well be the brother of Robert who married Antonia McColm. John Thom was married at Monimail on 6 August 1715 and had children baptised at Monimail – Elizabeth Thom 4 May 1718, Robert Thom 30 April 1721, and Isabel Thomas 10 March 1738. It is interesting to note that the first two children of John Thom and Isobel Alison were baptised Thom (1718 and 1721) and the third child was baptised Thomas (1738). We also note that the change from Thom to Thomas took place in Robert’s family just before or at the baptism of Antonia Thomas in 1728. Could this mean that Robert and John’s father, Angus McIntosh was never a Thomas, but changed his name to Thom or Tam when he moved to Collairnie?\n\nNote (1): This information is derived from the Latta Manuscript.\n\nNote (2): The purpose of banns is to enable anyone to raise any religious or civil impediment to the marriage, so as to prevent marriages that are invalid. Impediments vary between legal jurisdictions, but would normally include a pre-existing marriage that has been neither dissolved nor annulled, a vow of celibacy, lack of consent, or the couple’s being related within prohibited degrees of kinship.\n\nSources\n\nMy gratitude to Grahame Thom, Sennachie of Clan MacThomas for his assistance and guidance.\n\nClan MacThomas Website: https://clanmacthomas.com\n\nNational Records of Scotland: ScotlandsPeople _ Connecting Generations.https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/\n\nhttp://lattafamilyorigins.org/ – Webmaster: Geoffrey W.
