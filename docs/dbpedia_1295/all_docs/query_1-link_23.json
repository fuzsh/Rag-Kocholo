        "text": "Scott Edward Adkins was born on June 17, 1976 in Sutton Coldfield, England, into a family that for generations were butchers. Along with his elder brother Craig, he was raised by their parents, John and Janet (Sanders) Adkins, in a loving middle-class family. Scott attended Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. Probably not the best of students, he used to sneak downstairs after his parents had gone to bed and watch films all night then fall asleep during lessons. A natural athlete, Scott enjoyed a variety of sports as he grew up, but when he was 10 years old, he accompanied his father and brother to the local Judo club. The attraction was instantaneous. Idolising stars such as Bruce Lee and Jean-Claude Van Damme, Scott began to train everyday. He took over his Dad's garage and turned it into his own Dojo. He even had a shrine to Bruce Lee in there that he would bow to. He remembers being mugged on a bus when he was around 13 and that really kicked his training into overdrive. He wasn't ever going to let that happen again. At the age of 14, Scott went on to train in Tae Kwon Do under the instruction of Ron Sergiew with the T.A.G.B. After a few years, he moved on to Kickboxing under Anthony Jones. He is now a fully trained Kickboxing Instructor for the P. K. A. A self confessed \"film junkie\" Scott's attention was drawn to acting through the Hollywood Greats. He enrolled in a drama class at Sutton Coldfield College. Being a shy lad he initially found it difficult to be put on stage in front of an audience. Finally, at the age of 21, Scott was offered a place at the prestigious Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. However, as an impoverished student, he found it hard to make ends meet without a grant and was forced to leave without completing the course. Very dejected he thought that was the end.\n\nHis first break came when he was offered a role in a Hong Kong martial arts film called Dei seung chui keung (2001) (aka Extreme Challenge). Spotted by Head of The Hong Kong Stuntmen Association and director Wei Tung and English-born Hong Kong movie expert Bey Logan, Adkins found himself in the East for the first time. Scott got the chance to work with some of Hong Kong cinema's leading action directors including Woo-Ping Yuen, Corey Yuen, Sammo Kam-Bo Hung and the legendary Jackie Chan. Acting roles started to come in and he was offered a guest role in BBC's Doctors (2000) filmed at Birmingham's Pebble Mill. A few episodes in BBC's EastEnders (1985) and City Central (1998), and a lead role in Sky One comedy drama Mile High (2003) followed by a regular role in BBC's Holby City (1999) as Bradley Hume, the assistant General Manager of Holby General.\n\nStarring roles in feature films soon followed with his portrayal of Talbot in Special Forces USA (2003) and Yuri Boyka\" in Undisputed II: Last Man Standing (2006). It was this film that broke him into the mainstream with his villainous portrayal of a Russian MMA underground fighter Boyka in what has been hailed as one of the best American made Martial Arts films of recent times. Along with lead actor Michael Jai White, fight coordinator J.J. Perry and the slick direction of Isaac Florentine this movie has some unbelievably heart stopping fight scenes. After this Scott has had guest starring roles in bigger budget films like Das Bourne Ultimatum (2007) and The Tournament (2009), and played Jean-Claude Van Damme's main adversary in Sony Pictures The Shepherd (2008).\n\nWith a dedication to his craft, and consummate appetite for the world and people around him, Dave Baez has built a career on character study and cultivated a passion to share his experience with a new generation of theater and film actors.\n\nBorn in the old New England fishing town of New Bedford, Massachusetts, Dave grew up in a multi-ethnic family, deeply rooted in Portuguese and Puerto Rican culture. Raised with unwavering support from his parents, Dave developed a passion for the arts, leading him to the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. There, he majored in Theater Studies, performing in several plays as well as establishing a program for students called, \"The Experimental Stage,\" a creative outlet for free speech and the performing arts on campus.\n\nAfter college, Dave moved to Miami, and was cast in his first professional theater production as King Philip of France, in \"A Lion In Winter.\" A chance encounter with Frances Grill, founder of the CLICK modeling agency led to a meeting with fashion photographer Bruce Weber, who booked Dave for ads for Versace, Ralph Lauren, Brooks Bothers among others. Dave's focus, however, remained on acting as he used his newfound opportunity to move to New York and enroll in the acclaimed Herbert Bergdorf studio, studying under the late, celebrated actor, William Hickey, as well as an acceptance into the \"Absolute Theater Company,\" which produced off Broadway plays. After benefiting from a donation from Al Pacino, the Company was able to produce a showcase in Los Angeles, which in turn, allowed Dave to make his destined move out west.\n\nWith experience and a solid resume, Dave quickly booked a role in the final installment of the Crow franchise, The Crow: Wicked Prayer, for Dimension Films in 2005, opposite Danny Trejo and Dennis Hopper. Several parts in film and television followed, including recurring roles in NBC's \"Miss Match,\" alongside Alicia Silverstone and Ryan O'Neil, \"Las Vegas,\" opposite Josh Duhamel and Vanessa Marcil, and a five-episode arc on Showtime's \"Dexter,\" where Dave played Gabriel, the boyfriend to the title character's sister.\n\nDave can also be seen in the feature Mothers and Daughters, opposite Sharon Stone, Susan Sarandon, Selma Blair, Christina Ricci, and Courteney Cox, playing a doctor who develops a personal relationship with Selma Blair's character, as she struggles to make a tough decision regarding an unexpected pregnancy.\n\nOther credits include the Daytime Episodic, \"Days of Our Lives,\" CBS' \"The Mentalist,\" The CW fantasy-drama, \"The Secret Circle,\" the long-running Paramount comedy, \"All of Us,\" co-created by Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, and the popular IFC series \"Maron\" in 2015, along with countless commercials for brands such as, Bud Light, Craftsman, Honda, Toyota, Buick, Caress, Verizon and AT&T, among others.\n\nFor Dave, acting is a companion to his natural thirst for life and intense reflection into his own soul. He is keenly aware that an actors journey never ends, the craft never perfected, but only built layer upon layer. This intense passion has led Dave to a new endeavor as he transitions into teaching the craft as well, sharing his experience, trade-craft and unique insights of the industry that has fulfilled him for over a decade.\n\nEion is known for his performances in the Emmy and Golden Globe winning HBO miniseries Band of Brothers, character roles in \"Fight Club\" , \"Almost Famous\", \"Center Stage\" and leading man opposite Antonio Banderas in HBOs \"And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself\".
