They embody their discoveries, a live transmission, a possession, they are the sounds and movements of our zeitgeist. Honesty, force and elegance define Dahl & OE’s performance, giving voice to unspoken knowns and reigniting our desire to be bathed in the intangibles of live experience…\n\nView Event →\n\nHeart of the Ghost | tba\n\n“For years, few improvisation units have been as omnipresent in the D.C. area as Heart of the Ghost. For good reason: The trio of alto saxophonist Jarrett Gilgore, bassist Luke Stewart, and percussionist Ian McColm is something of a trinity of the finest free jazz improvisers in the region. If you’ve seen Heart of the Ghost in concert, then you know—Gilgore, Stewart, and McColm’s performances feel like a kind of séance, with the trio locked into a musical conversation with one another.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Transcendent Function | Thieves of Shiloh\n\nDaniel Levin is “one of the instrument’s most brilliant contemporary practitioners” (The Wire), “ridiculously fluent, virtually overflowing with ideas” (New York City Jazz Record) and “very much the man to watch.” (Penguin Guide to Jazz).
