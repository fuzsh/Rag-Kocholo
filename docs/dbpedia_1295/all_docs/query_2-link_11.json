She was so loved by her Florida “family”. Mom and I visited her in London in her High-Rise. We slept with Ian (on the bookcase)-Mary had such a great sense of humor! She was an amazing talented artist with her stained glass, rag rugs, and hand painted cards. Sadly, mom passed last August, but seeing Mary would have been waiting for her is comforting. Sorry my condolences are so late, but I had forgotten Mary’s last name, and just rediscovered one of her autographed cards. I also still have a stained glass cardinal she made that I treasure.\n\nC\n\nCathy uploaded photo(s)\n\n/public-file/374/Ultra/4b80375c-3980-409f-9d8d-0f7e16c79670.jpeg\n\n/public-file/375/Ultra/25ebfbb7-585b-462e-8bf8-f6944c80cd3f.jpeg\n\nWe wish to send our condolences on the death of our dearest “Nana Mary”. We have placed a cardinal on our Christmas tree in her honour and continue to decorate with the wooden horses she gave to us many years ago. Xo Cathy, Tom, Kelly and Jenn Faulds"
