        "text": "Sennachie indicated that having a Thoms ancestor from the eastern counties of Scotland, the enquirer has a connection to the Clan MacThomas.\n\nHe suggested for research, the following website pages may be of interest:\n\nhttps://www.genealogy.com/forum/surnames/topics/thoms/94/.\n\nhttps://www.myheritage.com/names/john_thoms.\n\nhttps://www.myheritage.com/names/joseph_thoms.\n\nFor searching Scottish records the best two sites are Scotlandpeople and familysearch.org. Sennachie asks if the enquirer has already used these sites. If not she will first need to open a free account.\n\nOn familysearch there is an Alexander Thoms said to have been born in 1818 and died in 1848. That means the next step is to search church records held on scotlandspeople, to hopefully confirm these years. It also means Alexander, his wife Helen and son George should appear on the 1841 Census with probably other family members. Hopefully using the church records on Scotlandspeople the enquirer may be able to go further back in time.\n\nSennachie suggested joining our Society via this link and offered to answer any further any questions that the enquirer may have.\n\nMcCombie\n\n(UK)\n\n(142)\n\nAdded 31/12/2023\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer was wondering what was the best way to trace family history. His father was from Skene born 1933, Alexander Angus McCombie and married his mother June McRobbie from Alford. He asks what the best way to go about it is.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised as the enquirer's surname is McCombie, it means our Chief accepts that he has a connection to the Clan MacThomas. If you join our Clan Society then you would have access to genealogical advice during the period of your membership. Otherwise, on this occasion there is limited general advice. To apply for membership please click here.\n\nThe following pages of this original website give you some general research advice:\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/genealogyfhgr.html\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/genealogyarticlesgtbfh.html\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/genealogyarticlesgtfhrbdm.html\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/genealogyarticlessnp.html\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/genealogyarticlesgtdnatalk.html\n\nSennachie suggested that first step is to see what relatives know, for example talk to parents, uncles and aunts or close cousins. There may be someone in the family has already done some research. Second see if a local public library has any “how to” books to borrow.\n\nFor Scotland, the most useful website is the government’s ScotlandsPeople. Registration is required to get access to their free indexes, and there are fees to purchase original records. Another useful free website is FamilySearch. Again registration is needed.\n\nThere are lots of other records available, but just using the above advice should result in setting up a family tree. Another useful site is Genuki as this will give guidance of available websites for UK research. Sennachie suggests not joining websites such as Ancestry at this stage.\n\nAlso appreciate that having DNA tested is just another tool to use. Some people think it could be the only thing to do. Sennachie recommends not using DNA until a tree back about five generations has been prepared.\n\nMacCone\n\n(USA)\n\n(141)\n\nAdded 31/12/2023\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer asks if her seven times great grandfather, who went as an indentured man in 1652 to Boston, USA at the age of 27 and whose name was probably MacCone in Scotland, is part of the Thomas clan. Another spelling of his name was MacCombe. He changed it or it got changed to Cone in the USA. It is thought that he fought and was captured in the Battle of Worcester, and was sent to the USA on a ship called the John and Sara.\n\nR\n\nThe Sennachie reported that there were two ships carrying prisoners of war from England to the American Colonies in 1650 and 1651. Much has been written about these two ships and the men who possibility sailed in them. A man named John McCoon is said to have arrived in New England on a ship called the Unity in December 1650 carrying prisoners from the Battle of Dunbar.\n\nThe John and Sara transported Scottish POW's from the Battle of Worcester to New England in 1651, and lists of men on board are said to include John and David MacHo[l]me. Sennachie does not believe John MacHolme and John MacCoon are the same person. Please see the following three links:\n\nhttps://spows.org/battle-of-dunbar/battle-of-dunbar-prisoners-of-war/battle-of-dunbar-prisoner-profiles/john-maccoon/\n\nhttps://spows.org/battle-of-dunbar/battle-of-dunbar-prisoners-of-war/battle-of-dunbar-prisoner-profiles/dunbar-prisoners-of-war-all/\n\nJohn and David MacHo(l)me on the John and Sara Passenger List (1651)\n\nWith regard to the surname M[a]cCoon[e] and MacCone, Sennacie looked at census records in the U.S. National Archives and found that the name seems to comes from Ireland. Although one source about John MacCoone above also states that he was probably born in Scotland.\n\nThe Earl/Marquess of Montrose led the Royalist army in Scotland during the English Civil War; our Clan chief at the time, McComie Mor, joined forces with him in 1644. This army was not only made up of Scots; there were Irishmen as well. Fast forward to Worcester and Dunbar five/six years later, it is likely there were still Irishmen fighting for the Royalist cause with the Scots - please see these links:\n\nM[a]cCoon[e]- U.S. National Archives- Census Record\n\nJames Graham, 5th Earl/1st Marquess of Montrose\n\nAlso a search for the name M(a)cCoone or MacCone on the website ScotlandsPeople did not reveal any early Scotsfolk named MacCoone (or variations). While a search for the name McCoon on the website FamilySearch does reveal results for McCoon(e) in Ireland.\n\nThe position of the Clan MacThomas at this time is that MacCone/McCoon etc is probably Irish and is not connected to our Clan. Of course there is a possibility that some time in the future this may change.\n\nSennachie notes that McCoone may be connected to the Clan McEwan. Reading about their clan history, the MacEwens have Irish roots (like some other clans) and apparently the clan genealogy can be hard to trace. See these page:\n\nClan MacEwen Sept Names- Clan MacEwen Society\n\nBrief History: Clan MacEwen\n\nPerhaps DNA testing may assist in sorting out who was who on these two ships. There is a group on familytreeDNA called the Scottish Prisoners of the Civil Wars (Dunbar and Worcester). This group looks at the yDNA results of living men who appear to have surnames linked to the surnames of men on these two ships. Do you have a close male relative with the surname Macone or Cone (or variations) that you could ask to have the yDNA test by familytreeDNA. Please see this web-page:\n\nhttps://www.familytreedna.com/public/ScottishPoWs/default.aspx?section=yresults\n\nIt is suggested that the enquirer might also like to see results for the Clan MacThomas DNA Group:\n\nhttps://www.familytreedna.com/groups/clan-mac-thomas-project/about\n\nhttps://www.familytreedna.com\n\nThomson\n\n(Not known)\n\n(140)\n\nAdded 31/12/2023\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer is looking into his step-father James Thomson’s family history. James was born in Scotland and up until a few months ago the family thought that he was linked to the Campbells. However, after a little more research they know differently and as such the enquirer is wondering if there is more information other than Glenshee, and Argyl etc. He asks if there is an actual place, ruin, meeting place can be visited? He notes that there is a meeting every 3 years and asks if this at Glenshee? Also how is it possible for him to attend?.\n\nR\n\nSennachie explained that a person with the surname Thomson or who has an ancestor with the surname Thomson is considered to have a connection to the Clan MacThomas where it is found that they have a Thomson ancestor who was born in the Scottish eastern highland counties, see link below.\n\nAlso see the Clan MacTavish website link below. So the question for the enquirer is, does his research of his step-father James Thomson’s ancestors show a link to the eastern highland counties? If it does then he would be welcomed to join the Clan MacThomas Society.\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/septthomson.html\n\nhttps://clanmactavish.org/scottish-thompson-name-mactavish\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/societymembership.html\n\nAll the enquirer's questions about our Clan and the Society can be answered by reading our original website. With regard to Glenshee and the Clan MacThomas site, the Cockstane, please use the links below. Anyone can visit the Cockstane area, on the A93 road just south of Glenshee.\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/glenshee.html\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/thecockstane.html\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/macthomaslinks2.html\n\nThe most recent Clan MacThomas gathering was held in August 2023, based on a hotel at Blairgowie, Perthshire. Our next Gathering is expected to be held in August 2026.\n\nThomas\n\n(USA)\n\n(139)\n\nAdded 17/04/23\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer has been researching his family history and,by using DNA matching results, is back to about his fifth great grandparent, surname Thomas. He asks if these Thomas ancestors connected to the Clan MacThomas.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that using DNA so far back is difficult. To be connected to our Clan, having the name Thomas, the enquirer would need to find a connection to the Eastern highland counties of Scotland - such as Aberdeen, Fife, Perth and Angus. Once that is established then he could become a full member of our Society. Click here to read more about our septs and here for information about our Society.\n\nResearch based on DNA results needs to be part of standard research using online websites such as ScotlandsPeople and familysearch.org and supported by research at facilities such as libraries, archives and specialist services such as family history societies.\n\nThomas is a common surname, more so in Wales and England. The enquirer later confirmed a likely Welsh connection.\n\nTams\n\n(England)\n\n(138)\n\nAdded 17/04/23\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer has been told that the Tams clansfolk left Scotland about 1600's to travel south and maybe to England. A tartan shop suggested a link to the Clan MacThomas. He asks if he is part of the extended family of our Clan.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that Tam/Tams is a less common surname in the history of the Clan MacThomas. Only one enquiry from someone with this surname has been received since 2010; please see entry No 40 on this page.\n\nThere is a dedicated page regarding the name Tam on this website.\n\nIt was suggested that the enquirer needs to carry out standard family history research along your Tams line to see if it you can establish a connection to the eastern highland counties of Scotland, such as Perthshire, Aberdeenshire or Fife. Sennachie carried out a search of the trees on the website Ancestry for Tams and discovered that there there are a number. He provided images of some. One thing that the enquirer could do is contact the \"owners\" of these trees using the Ancestry message facility.\n\nIf the Tams line dates back to the 1500s in England then it may be difficult to find a link into Scotland, due to lack of records such as baptism registers. An interesting large free website to use is familysearch.org.\n\nThis website includes some useful Staffordshire records which may be of interest.\n\nAnother approach is to take a DNA test. If you are just interested in your surname you could undertake the y-DNA test by Family Tree DNA. This is called a Paternal Test. Companies such as AncestryDNA, 23andMe DNA, MyHeritage DNA do not provide this test. The reason for using this type of test is that the results will apply to all your Tams male ancestors. Part of the result will be an estimated ethnic mix. If you take this test and the ethnic mix indicates a strong link to Scotland then our Clan Society would consider you have a connection to the Clan MacThomas.\n\nMacCoone\n\n(USA)\n\n(137)\n\nAdded 17/04/23\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer advised that his Scottish ancestor was a veteran of the Battle of Dunbar and was later transported to Boston on the ship John and Sara in 1651. The manifest lists his name as John MackHolme (spelled phonetically by the British). The enquirer have read that Clan MacThomas have identified him as one of their four Clan members on the ship. His original Scottish surname may have been McColm. In America he is known as John MacCoone. He may have had a brother named David MackHolme on the same ship. The enquirer asks if we can provide any information on this?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that it is likely John MacCoone has no connection to the Clan MacThomas.\n\nThere was a John MacCoon[e] who fought at Dunbar and arrived in New England on the Unity in 1650. A year later, John and David MacHo[l]me both arrived in New England on board the John and Sara after fighting at Worcester in late 1651. Due to this, we don't believe John MacHolme and John MacCoone are the same person. Please see these links:\n\nJohn MacCoone on the Unity (1650).\n\nJohn and David MacHo(l)me on the John and Sara Passenger List (1651).\n\nWith regard to the surname M[a]cCoon[e], the census records in the U.S. National Archives show that the name seems to comes from Ireland. The source provided on John MacCoone above also states that he was probably born in Scotland.\n\nThe Earl/Marquess of Montrose led the Royalist army in Scotland during the English Civil War and our Clan chief at that time, McComie Mor, joined forces with him in 1644. His army was not only made up of Scots; there were Irishmen as well. That means it is likely there were still Irishmen fighting for the Royalist cause with the Scots at Dunbar six years later. The following links provide further information:\n\nM[a]cCoon[e]- U.S. National Archives- Census Record.\n\nJames Graham, 5th Earl/1st Marquess of Montrose.\n\nFurthermore a search for the name M(a)cCoone on the website ScotlandsPeople does not reveal any early Scotsfolk named MacCoone (or variations). While a search for the name McCoone on the website FamilySearch does reveal results for McCoone in Ireland.\n\nFinally it is noted that McCoone may be connected to the Clan McEwan. Reading about this clan history, the MacEwens have Irish roots (like some other clans) and apparently the clan genealogy can be hard to trace. These links may be helpful: Clan MacEwen Sept Names- Clan MacEwen Society\n\nBrief History of Clan MacEwen\n\nThomson\n\n(USA)\n\n(136)\n\nAdded 17/04/23\n\nQ\n\nA member has researched his family tree back to Mary Thomson who married George Rae in Monimail, Fife on 25 January 1724. He asks if there is any possibility of finding anything more, especially about her family.\n\nR\n\nSennachie explained that at time spelling variations are quite common. So dont assume that Thomson must always be correct. Plus the lack of details in the old parish registers makes this task that much more difficult. Another factor that may be present is in relation to the naming of children, see this page.\n\nThe baptism of nine children of George Rae and Mary Thomson was found on familysearch.org with one baptised in Monimail, Fife and the others in the parish of Crese, Fife. Mary Thomson could have been christened Mary Thom or Thoms. The following baptism is of particular interest - Mary Thom christened 31 October 1697, Monimail, Fife, father David Thom, mother Mary Gilmour. There appears not to be a marriage of a Mary Thom in the early 1700s in Fife.\n\nIt is noted that Mary Thomson appears to have been pregnant when she married, Perhaps, for that reason she changed her surname slightly when she married. Also of interest is that women at that time generally ceased falling pregnant around 45 years old. Assuming Agnes born late in 1742 is their last child, then it is likely Mary was born about 1697.\n\nThere are many trees for George Rae and Mary Thomson on Ancestry with many saying Mary was born about 1711, making her about 13 when married, A marriage at that age is a bit suspect, especially in the light of the comment in previous paragraph.\n\nOur Clan Chief accepts there is a connection to the Clan if a member is satisfied that Mary Thomson came from Fife. It is generally impossible to make an absolute connection to a Clan. However at about the same time the Chiefly family were living in the area of Monimail; please refer to this page and this page on this website.\n\nMcCombie\n\n(USA)\n\n(135)\n\nAdded 16/04/23\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer in the USA is trying to link his earliest ancestors to their origin in the UK and Ireland. The enquiry relates to his ancestor, Mary McComb, possibly born about 1715 in Ireland, married James C. Young, Augusta, Virginia, USA.\n\nR\n\nSennachie responded that this was a difficult challenge that may not be solved. Check websites such as Ancestry, myheritage, familysearch for any family trees relating to this couple, to see if anyone has solved this; ie, the parents of Mary McComb. If there are trees and none reveal her parents, this in an indication other researchers have also reached this “brickwall”. Consider if there is a possible name change for McComb, such as McCombie. Consider the possibility of hard to find records in Augusta that may reveal Mary’s birthplace, such a newspapers. A good website to check is the wiki section of familysearch.org. Contact the Augusta County Historical Society. Search the website for the USA National Archives.\n\nSennachie prefers to use free genealogy websites. For Scotland these are mainly familysearch and ScotlandsPeople, with support from local sites where needed.\n\nMcCommie\n\n(USA)\n\n(134)\n\nAdded 14/08/22\n\nQ\n\nA new member advises that he is the great, great, great grandson of William McCommie of Alves, Morayshire, Scotland. Records show he christened his son there in 1798 and his daughter in 1801. He asks if there a connection to the Clan MacThomas and what the Sennachie’s thoughts are about his McCommie ancestors.\n\nR\n\nSennachie welcomed the enquirer to the Society and explained that his role is to try to help the member with his research. His assistance is free to members.\n\nSennachie prefers to use free genealogy websites. For Scotland these are mainly familysearch.org and ScotlandsPeople, with support from local sites where needed.\n\nIt was noted that the member’s research has taken him back into the 18th century. This means that the records being researched have limitations. For example, entries in parish register for baptisms, marriages, and burials give limited information compared to later years. Information from newspapers is limited. Many people could not read or write. Changes occurred to the spelling of names. Not all parish registers are extant.\n\nA search of familysearch of the member’s ancestors revealed:-\n\nGeorge McCommie baptised 27 May 1798, father William McCommie, mother Anne McAdam, Alves, Morayshire, Scotland.\n\nAnne McCommie, baptised 21 March 1801, born 18 March 1801, father William McCommie, mother Anne McAdam, Alves, Morayshire, Scotland.\n\nWilliam Mc Commie baptised 14 November 1795, born 8 November 1795, father William Mc Commie, mother Anne Mc Adam, at Drainie, Morayshire, Scotland.\n\nChristian Mc Komie, (female) baptised 15 March 1794, born 12 March 1794, father William Mc Komie, mother Ann Mc Adam, Drainie, Morayshire, Scotland.\n\nWilliam McHomas, married Ann McAdams, 25 May 1793, Draine, Morayshire, Scotland\n\nA tree on familysearch states William McCommie died on 17 July 1828. It does not indicate the source. One source could be from a headstone in a local cemetery where he was living. Sennachie suggested contacting the relevant family history society - http://www.morayandnairnfhs.co.uk.\n\nA very useful part of familysearch is its Wiki section where searches can be done for general information; for example, searching for Drainie, Scotland brings up this page: https://www.familysearch.org/en/wiki/Drainie,_Moray,_Scotland_Genealogy.\n\nSennachie suggested having a DNA test. It is a tool within the genealogy tool box to be used in conjunction with record research. More advice on DNA can be provided.\n\nAs to having a connection to the Clan MacThomas, as your ancestor in Moray has the surname McCommie and variations, that is a sufficient connection to our Clan. It is quite usual for members not achieving a connection to the Clan using records, but achieving a connection based on the traditional history of the Clan, through a link to Scotland related to a sept of the Clan.\n\nThom\n\n(USA)\n\n(133)\n\nAdded 25/06/22\n\nQ\n\nA new member advised that her great grandmother was Maragaret Thom (maiden name) born in Scotland in 1890. Her AncestryDNA results indicated 48% Scottish with ancestry in North East Scotland and the Northern Isles. She requested further information.\n\nR\n\nSennachie found the following entries on the ScotlandsPeople website that may relate to the enquirer's Thom ancestors:\n\nBirth: Thom ~ Margaret ~ F ~ 1890 ~ 583/ 11 ~ Coylton\n\nCensus: Thom ~ Margaret ~ 1891 ~ F ~ 1 {Age} ~ 583/ 4/ 2 ~ Coylton ~ Ayr\n\nIt would seem Margaret’s parents were John Thom (born c 1846) and Margaret (born c 1848). Margaret is probably Margaret Speir who married John Thom in 1871 at Ochiltree, Ayrshire.\n\nWith regard to the DNA test with ancestry, the member might like to join the Clan MacThomas DNA Group on the website familytreeDNA. She can do this by downloading from ancestry the raw data created by your test and uploading it to familytrreeDNA - see the following links: https://www.familytreedna.com/autosomal-transfer https://www.familytreedna.com/groups/clan-mac-thomas-project/about Sennachie offered more help if it is needed.\n\nThompson\n\n(USA)\n\n(132)\n\nAdded 25/06/22\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer recently found out about his Scottish ancestry through DNA, and read that Thompson is from the MacTavish clan. But then he discovered that it is from MacThomas. He asked which is correct as his DNA result according to Ancestry shows 50 percent Scottish. Also a “p” could have just been added very easily.\n\nR\n\nSenachie advised that based on evidence and traditional references the name Thompson has no connection to the Clan MacThomas. The only circumstance that someone with the surname Thompson has a connection to our Clan is where there is reasonable proof that back in time there had been a spelling variation. Even then if you can obtain proof that your surname was once Thomson, to be connected to our Clan your Thompson/Thomson name would need to have a connection to the eastern highland counties in Scotland, ie, Perthshire, Angus, Aberdeenshire and Fife. This is because we know that MacThomas clansfolk living in those counties many years ago did change their surnames to Thomson, but not to Thompson.\n\nThe following link explains of our Clan Chief's view regarding Thomson: https://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/septthomson.html/.\n\nThe enquirer cannot depend on DNA results alone to conclude that because a DNA test shows links to Scotland then your Thompson surname must be Scottish. DNA is just one tool to use in researching family history. That means DNA evidence needs to be part of standard genealogy research. Sennachie suggested research needs to be carried out on his Thompson line to see where in the UK that the Thompsons lived.\n\nAs for Clan MacTavish claiming Thompson as having a connection to their Clan, that is up to the MacTavish Chief to determine.\n\nHolmes\n\n(USA)\n\n(131)\n\nAdded 25/06/22\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer’s family has long held their Scottish heritage with great pride and are aware that their ancestors came from the Highlands. They may have been sent to America during the highland clearances but their exact origins are unclear. Sources indicate that Holmes might be a anglicised version of MacThomas. Any information regarding this suggestion would be greatly appreciated.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that the Chief of the Clan McThomas considers the name Holmes has no connection to the Clan MacThomas. Holmes is considered generally to be English with a possible connection to the Scottish Lowlands. The MacThomas Clan was based in the Scottish Highlands in Perthshire. Sennachie is not aware of any example where research has indicated that Holmes is a variation of MacThomas.\n\nThe enquirer needs to carry out some research to see where their Holmes ancestors came from. Another possible option is having a DNA test as this should generally provide a broad ethnic indication.\n\nAs an indication of the spread of the name Holmes, using the website familysearch.org a search using the exact spelling of Holmes in the UK resulted in 1.1 million for England and nearly 10,000 entries for Scotland.\n\nThom\n\n(USA)\n\n(130)\n\nAdded 25/06/22\n\nQ\n\nThom is the enquirer’s first name, but it is his mother's maiden name. Both sides of his mother's family (The Thoms and Sanfords) are from Scotland. Great great grandfather John Thom was a blacksmith who immigrated from Scotland and settled in Sandusky, Ohio US around 1850. A visit to Scotland is planned in August 2022 partly to celebrate his mother’s 80th birthday. The family would very much like to visit parts of the country where their family is from. Any advice of places to visit would be very welcome.\n\nR\n\nSennachie explained that just on the amount of information given it is difficult to say where John Thom was born and lived in Scotland. He asked if the enquirer has John’s death certificate as this should say how old he was when he died. It may even say where he was born in Scotland? Also is his wife’s name known?\n\nJohn’s ancestors may have come from the area where the Clan MacThomas was based in Glenshee, Perthshire, Scotland. Clansfolk moved away from Glenshee in the 1600s and early 1700s to other parts of Scotland and even to Ireland. The Sennachie suggested looking at the following pages on the Clan website and elsewhere.\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/clanhistory.html\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/membersusefulinformation.html\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/thecockstane_throughtheseasons_201804.html\n\nhttps://www.discoverglenshee.co.uk\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/septthom.html\n\nIt is likely that genealogy research may not be able to establish where John’s ancestors lived, but it is reasonable to assume one of them came from the Glenshee area some time ago. Using Sennachie’s tree as an example, his Thom line is from Australia to Old Monkland in Lanarkshire, east of Glasgow, in the late 1800s. They lived in that area back several generations to the mid 1700s. That is the end of the trail, but it is reasonable to assume they are connected to the Clan and Glenshee.\n\nThom\n\n(USA)\n\n(129)\n\nAdded 11/01/22\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer provided her Thom family tree indicating that her ancestors were William Thom who married Elisabeth McLintock in 1785 at Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland and that William’s parents could be Joseph Thom and Isobel Rob. There is uncertainty about the Thom/Rob marriage and some advice is therefore needed.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that getting back into 18th century could be as far back as you can go. A general search of the internet found no other researchers interested William and Elisabeth, except there was one tree on Ancestry that stopped at this couple. For Scottish research the two main websites are the official government site ScotlandsPeople and familysearch.org. Joseph Thom and Isobel Rob may not be William’s parents as there is at least another possible couple, namely John Thom and Euphame Law who had a son William baptised on 23 May 1763 in Cambusnetham, Lanarkshire.\n\nThom\n\n(Australia)\n\n(128)\n\nAdded 10/01/22\n\nQ\n\nA member enquired about researching his grandfather’s ancestry in Scotland. James Thom was born Glasgow in 1876, the son of James Thom and Mary Ann Ritchie.\n\nR\n\nSennachie provided details of this family from the 1881 Census of Scotland found on Ancestry, and advised that the next step was to use the website ScotlandsPeople to obtain a copy of the original 1881 Census return and also the marriage certificate for James Thom and Mary Ann Ritchie, who married in 1870 in the district of Bridgeton, Glasgow. More advice to follow after receiving these documents.\n\nMcComb\n\n(USA)\n\n(127)\n\nAdded 10/01/22\n\nQ\n\nGreat great grandmother Eliza McComb was born in 1843 in Ireland, possibly Co Derry and married James Mawhinney. Her death certificate states her father, Robert McComb was born in Scotland. The enquirer would appreciate any advice on researching this family in Ireland and Scotland.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that the website familysearch has the record of the death of Eliza Mawhinniey on 29 February 1908 in Boston USA aged 62 years. Her father, Robert McComb may have been born in Scotland (as stated) in about 1800 to 1830. Using this period, a search on the website familysearch.org results in only one baptism of a Robert McComb, son of James McComb and Jean Houston on 17 July 1825 in the parish of Neilston (near Glasgow).\n\nTo confirm that James and John are ancestors, the enquirer needs to see if some record relating to Robert reveals his parents names, such as Robert’s death certificate. The 1841 Census for Scotland may reveal an entry for this family. Having a DNA autosomal test may find a match to someone who has already researched this family. Note that having a McComb ancestor means the enquirer has a connection to the Clan MacThomas and therefore can join the Clan MacThomas Society.\n\nTomassini\n\n(Italy)\n\n(126)\n\nAdded 10/01/22\n\nQ\n\nAn associate member enquired about the possibility that his surname may have a connection to Scotland and the Clan MacThomas, as Tomassini means “son of Thomas” and DNA results indicate Scottish ancestry.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that there may be no connection to a Clan MacThomas sept just based on a DNA result. DNA testing is just another research avenue and needs to be supported by documentary research showing which ancestor has a connection to Scotland. If the connection is based on surnames Thomas or Thomson then further research would be necessary to establish a connection to the eastern highland counties, such as Perthshire, Angus and Aberdeenshire. Also to a large extent it depends upon which type of test was carried out - autosomal, y-DNA or mt-DNA.\n\nThom\n\n(Switzerland)\n\n(125)\n\nAdded 10/01/22\n\nQ\n\nTwo Thom brothers immigrated from France to Switzerland in about 1730. A living descendant is interested in knowing if it is possible that the ancestors of the brothers came from Scotland. Interest in asking for advice was encouraged during a tour of Scotland in 2020 when a stop was made at the Spittal where information about the Clan McThomas was read.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that a search of the website familysearch.org for the name Thom in France results in a number of possibilities and four examples were sent. Also general history of links between France and Scotland during the 17th century revealed strong connections. The enquirer was encouraged to carry out further basic genealogy research and consider the possibility of having a DNA test. The Clan MacThomas considers that people with the surname Thom do have a connection to the Clan and therefore the enquirer would be welcome to join our Clan Society.\n\nThom\n\n(Canada)\n\n(124)\n\nAdded 11/01/22\n\nQ\n\nEnquirer has recently started researching his Scottish ancestors and has found that his great great grandparents were Alexander Thom and Anne Anderson who married in Boharm, Banffshire on 20 June 1856. Information was found on Ancestry. He asks what else can be done and whether he qualifies for membership?\n\nR\n\nSennachie recommended that more research could be carried out using the websites familysearch.org and ScotlandsPeople, such as searching the census returns. Because his grandmother’s maiden name was Thom the enquirer has a connection to Clan MacThomas and he can join the Clan MacThomas Society. The Sennachie offered further assistance if needed.\n\nMcUmber\n\n(USA)\n\n(123)\n\nAdded 10/01/22\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer would like to know about where his father’s ancestors originated.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that McUmber is not a name associated with the Clan MacThomas. Nor is it likely to be Scottish. It is more likely to have originated from the southern English surname Maycumber, see a relevant article here.\n\nThomas\n\n(USA)\n\n(122)\n\nAdded 18/07/21\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer asked if his DNA test showed 50% Scottish, does that mean his ancestor Truman Thomas and his son Danford Thomas (1897-1920) could be connected to the Clan MacThomas.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that it is not possible to say from a DNA test showing 50% Scottish (or any country and percentage) which ancestors this relates to. So the surname Thomas could be related to the other 50%. Also the ethnic mix is just a guide and therefore cannot be taken as an absolute indicator. This means more research of documented records needs to be done, especially in establishing the origins of the Thomas ancestors. Brief searches on Ancestry, Familysearch and Google did not find any relevant results based on the limited information proveded by the enquirer.\n\nThom\n\n(USA)\n\n(121)\n\nAdded 30/05/21\n\nQ\n\nA member enquired about his father Nicholas Glen Thom born 1904 in or near Baldwin, Illinois. He had two brothers, Fred and Roland, and two sisters, Helen and Beulah . Their father was Jesse A Thom who died before 1951, wife was Mary Elizabeth Blank. He would appreciate guidance in researching further.\n\nR\n\nSennachie referred to pages on the Clan’s website regarding research. Copies of a relevant tree on ancestry were provided with the warning that the facts stated needed to be confirmed by research. Also advice was provided about DNA testing and the opportunity to join the Clan MacThomas Group on familytreeDNA website.\n\nMcComb\n\n(USA)\n\n(120)\n\nAdded 05/04/21\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer sought assistance in establishing their McComb connection to Scotland. Father McComb and sons James, John, Robert (ancestor), and William emigrated from County Antrim, Ireland to the USA prior to 1732.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that several Clan MacThomas members are related to this family, with research indicating that finding records in Ireland and then to Scotland, is very difficult, if not impossible, mainly due to the lack of records. For example, there are very few records on passengers moving from Scotland to Ireland back in the 1600s and 1700s. The best option is to engage a local professional researcher in Ireland. But in doing this, without knowing the town or district in Co Antrim will make research difficult. Please see an article on the Clan MacThomas Society website by clicking here.\n\nThomsson\n\n(Sweden)\n\n(119)\n\nAdded 05/04/21\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer asked if the Society had any record linking their Scottish ancestor to the Thomsson family in Sweden. Colonel Tomas Thomsson was born in Scotland and came to Sweden in 1595. He was the son of Henrik Thomsson - Williamsson born about 1540.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that the surname Thomsson was very rare in Scotland. In the 1500s the use of surnames in Scotland was developing and the name Thomsson in Sweden could have come from Thomson, Thom, Thomas and even McComie, an early name used by the Clan MacThomas. Church records prior to the early 1600s in Scotland are very limited and no record could be found for a Henry Thomson or father William Thomson. Even if a record could be found, proving a connection to someone in Sweden would be very difficult.\n\nThomson\n\n(Scotland)\n\n(118)\n\nAdded 05/04/21\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer has researched his Thomson ancestors back to the Rev Patrick Thomson who died aged 84 years in 1792 in Tillyfour, Aberdeenshire. He attended Marischal College in Aberdeen. He asks it there is there a link between Patrick and the Clan MacThomas.\n\nR\n\nSennachie responded saying that generally speaking a connection to the Clan MacThomas is based on the surname of a person born in Scotland, especially, in the case of Thomson. A Thomson family of the eastern highland counties of Scotland, including Aberdeenshire, means the Clan MacThomas would welcome you as a member of the Clan MacThomas Society. In relation to your ancestor Patrick Thomson, there is one relevant tree on the website familysearch.org. But no parents are listed. A general search for a Patrick Thomson born about 1708 in Aberdeenshire revealed a number of results which makes it difficult to establish if one relates to your Patrick. Being educated indicates his parents may have been middle class, so read some general history of the area and time looking for mention of a Thomson family in the late 1600s and early 1700s. .\n\nMcCombie\n\n(USA)\n\n(117)\n\nAdded 05/04/21\n\nC\n\nThe writer is the great great grandson of Robert Jacob McCombie mentioned in Hamish McCombie’s excellent article “McCombie - a One-Name Study”. Records found include the ship’s manifest for the Cornumia arriving Ellis Island in 1836, and his enlistment record showing he, together with his brother William, fought in the US civil war, and other family details.\n\nThom\n\n(England)\n\n(116)\n\nAdded 05/04/21\n\nQ\n\nA member asked for assistance in researching his Thom ancestors. Great grandparents were John and Caroline Thom (nee Smith). His grandfather Sidney was born in 1897 in Alverstoke, Hampshire, England. Father, John, was a Regimental Sergeant Major in the Royal Engineers, so the family lived in various localities. John was born in Largs, Ayrshire in about 1855.\n\nR\n\nSennachie recommended the use of websites Scotlandspeople, Familysearch, and Freebdm. Other websites, such as Ancestry and myHeritage can be useful but should be used as a guide to search for original records such as births, deaths and marriages and census records. Using these websites Sennachie was able to find details of his Thom ancestors back to the 18th century in Ayrshire.\n\nMcComb\n\n(USA)\n\n(115)\n\nAdded 18/10/20\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer asked if there are any details of the McComb migration from Scotland to Ireland. The Society's migration map indicates a move for southern Scotland to Ireland but it appears there are no family links to support the move.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that one of the biggest challenges is finding movements of your Scottish ancestors from Scotland to Ireland. In 1600s to the 1800s (and before) there was no requirement or need to keep records of people travelling from Great Britain to Ireland and the reverse. In those days there were no such thing as passports as we know today. It was simply the same as going across the River Thames, anyone could do it and there were no laws concerning such movements. The recording of general history tells us such movements happened but no details, except perhaps the movements of people of the upper class.\n\nHe suggested reading the familysearch wiki page below and watching the following familysearch video:\n\n\"Ireland Genealogy\" - click here.\n\n\"The Scots-Irish: Plantation and Settlement of Ulster in the 17th Century\" - click here.\n\nMcComb\n\n(USA)\n\n(114)\n\nAdded 01/08/20\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer sent to the Society details of her McComb ancestors, Andrew McComb and his wife Agnes (Nancy) Penney, with some photographs. Andrew was born in the Parish of Carnmoney in County Antrim, Ireland in 1812 and Agnes was born in the Parish of Ballylinny, Antrim in 1818. They arrived in the USA in 1874 on the ship Parthis, and settled in Manchester, New Hampshire. They had twelve children including Andrew who married Mary Ann Braine and lived in Pennsylvania. The other siblings lived in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Massachustetts.\n\nR\n\nSennachie thanked the enquirer for the photographs and information about her McComb ancestors. The Society had not received this information before and it will be filed in the Society’s records. Information was provided about joining the Society.\n\nMacCombie\n\n(USA)\n\n(113)\n\nAdded 06/06/20\n\nQ\n\nA new member sought advice on how to research their family history, especially their MacCombie ancestors. Great grandfather is John Spinks MacCombie who married Mary Dorward Ewing in Indiana, USA in 1901. He is said to have been born in Scotland in about 1868.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that there is what appears to be a well researched tree on ancestry.com but questioned its accuracy as research found no reference to John Spinks McCombie on either of the following sites. Sennachie questioned the use of the second given surname Spinks. He has observed that in America that there is a tendency for Americans to add a surname later in life as a second given name. That means the member's John Spinks McCombie may have been baptised as John McCombie.\n\nSennachie suggested that the member could do further research on scotlandspeople and familysearch.org. Indexes on scotlandspeople are free to search, but there is a cost to obtain copies of original documents. Familysearch is a free website. Researchers need to register first.\n\nThoms\n\n(Australia)\n\n(112)\n\nAdded 16/01/20\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer has been using Scotlanspeople with a good deal of success. Great great grandfather William Thoms parents were John Thoms and Helen Warden who married in Glenisla on 4 January 1793. He needs advice on finding John Thoms' birth and details about his parents.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that the name Thoms appears to have first been used in Dundee in the mid 1700s, click here. This was a result of a name change, probably from Thomas or Thom. A good example of this is the chiefly line, click here. A problem at that time was that some parish records have not survived. For this check the wiki section of familysearch.org. On this site I found a possible baptism for John, click here (It may be necessary to log in to use this link).\n\nHaving a Thoms ancestor means that you might like to consider joining the Clan MacThomas Society.\n\nMcComas\n\n(USA)\n\n(111)\n\nAdded 11/01/20\n\nQ\n\nA Society member has enquired about information on ancestor David McComas born about 1767, who married Chloe Bailey. There are indications that David’s parents were John McComas and Catherine Burke who may come to America in about the mid 1700s. Was John born in Ireland or maybe England.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that there are many trees on the internet relating to David McComas, with some having as his parents John and Catherine Burke. There is doubt as to when and where David was born. And the same goes for his father John. Many trees on sites such as ancestry, myheritage, genealogy, familytreecircles, and rootsweb indicate how confusing is the research. Maybe there is a need to go through all the McComas trees that are online, and look for references to original documents. Then review against what you have already found. Click here and here to read two interesting assessments.\n\nAdd to all that, it is difficult to undertake research in Ireland looking for information in the 1600s and 1700s. Have a read of the familysearch.org article on Ireland here.\n\nMcComas\n\n(USA)\n\n(110)\n\nAdded 08/01/20\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer came across the Clan MacThomas web page while doing research for an upcoming trip to Scotland. Researching back to Daniel McComas, who emigrated to the US from Scotland in the 1600s. She had always been told that McComas was a sept of the Clan Gunn. She asks if the Clan MacThomas point to something that would explain why two clans would both want to claim McComas as a sept? She is planning a trip to Scotland to visit important McComas places. One tree on the internet states that Daniel's father was a Donald who was from Kenmore. She would welcome suggestions of places to visit.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that there are many trees on the internet relating to Daniel McComas but it appears that no one, with proof, has been able to say where and when Daniel was born. Those who have stated where and when he was born are speculating. As to the Clan Gunn stating that McComas is a sept of that Clan, their reason for this claim is not known. Our Chief is definite that McComas is a sept of the Clan MacThomas as McComas is the Gaelic translation of MacThomas, with “Th” pronounced as “C” in days gone by. Kenmore is in Clan MacThomas territory while the Clan Gunn is based in the northern Scottish counties. As the enquirer is female and the last of her family, DNA will probably not help unless the autosomal test reveals a link to a male relative. The Society’s website has information on the McComas sept, click here. Our website contains a lot of information about Clan MacThomas significant sites. Sennachie suggests that she should consider joining our Society.\n\nCumbie\n\n(USA)\n\n(109)\n\nAdded 10/10/19\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer was in Scotland to do some family history research, especially relating to Cumbie ancestors and would welcome any advice.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that researching in Scotland for your Cumbie ancestors is difficult without knowing where in Scotland they came from, and also the challenge of a spelling variation. A number of online Cumbie family trees show no link to Scotland. It is reasonably certain Cumbie was not used in Scotland in the period before 1800. It is one of those spelling changes that happened in the US at the time an ancestor arrived there. Hence the use of the surname Cumbie probably originated in the US. Our Society is satisfied that Cumbie is likely to be a spelling variation of the surname Combie which is a sept name within the Clan MacThomas. Even accepting this it will be hard to make the link back to Scotland without knowing where in Scotland your ancestor lived.\n\nOne option to consider is having your DNA tested. This may result in finding a link to someone who has used the surname Cumbie or Combie, and may find research back to Scotland. As your DNA test was autosomal only it is suggested you have your y-DNA tested as this test evalutes the origin of your male line only, ie Cumbie line, see article here.\n\nAs the Clan MacThomas would be inclined to accept you as a clansman of our Clan please consider joining our Clan Society by submitting details of your Cumbie line with your application, click here.\n\nMcComas\n\n(USA)\n\n(108)\n\nAdded 30/09/19\n\nQ\n\nThe enquiring member is descended from John “David’ McComas and his wife Catherine Burke. John died in Giles County, Virginia around 1799. His parents could be Alexander McComas and Elizabeth Day and his Scottish grandfather Daniel McComas. He needs advice on how to obtain proof about this connection.\n\nR\n\nSennachie found that there are many trees on websites showing Daniel McComas as their ancestor. First step is to examine these trees closely for new reliable information that is based on original sources. Also consider contacting the “owners” of trees that look well researched. Having been DNA tested, consider joining the Clan McThomas Group on familytreeDNA. Check the Scottish government website Scotlandspeople. Please note the responses to enquiries 31, 34, 61 and 89 below.\n\nMcCombs\n\n(USA)\n\n(107)\n\nAdded 02/09/19\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer believes his surname McCombs 'traces back to' the Clan MacThomas. There appears to be little history about the name McCombs and most online information does not end in \"s\", ie McComb. He has established his great great grandfather was Henry McCombs who died 1866 in Illimois having married Ruth Walton. The assumption is that \"s\" was added when his ancestors came to America. The enquirer asks if this is so and would appreciate any information.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that there are many people in the USA today who have surnames that are slightly different to the name of their ancestor who arrived in America. We accept that someone with the surname McCombs is connected to our Clan. We have had enquiries from people with the name McCombs and comments can be seen by clicking here - look at numbers 23, 37, 66, 77 and 80.\n\nOne interesting free website is familysearch.org. This site requires researchers to register before accessing their data. After you register, enter the surname McCombs and the State where they lived in the US so as to see possible ancestors. Click on these links for other information, Schuyler and worldconnect.\n\nAnother possible opportunity is to have your DNA tested. If you are keen to explore your McCombs line further then in regards to DNA, you should have your y-DNA tested as this relates to your male line going back in time. Not all DNA testing companies do this test, especially ancestryDNA. In my view the best company for y-DNA is familytreeDNA, click here.\n\nIf you are interested in joining our Society, please click here.\n\nMacTavish\n\nThomson\n\n(England)\n\n(106)\n\nAdded 02/09/19\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer’s great great great grandmother was a Mctavish and his grandfather was a Thomson from Lossiemouth in Moray. Having recently visited the Cockstane he is interested to find out if there is a connection to Clan MacThoms on either side of his family ?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that the Clan MacThomas does not have a connection to McTavish despite the Clan MacTavish claiming some Clan MacThomas sept names - click here.\n\nThe Clan MacThomas origins are with the Clan MacIntosh in the western highlands back in the 15th century. The surname Thomas as a sept of the Clan MacThomas occurs within the Clan in the 17th century, click here.\n\nIf the enquirer's Thomson line can be traced back to the eastern highland counties of Scotland, then he can join our Society as a full member. If not he may like to consider joining as an associate member, click here. The enquirer was asked to contact the Sennachie again if has are further questions, especially in regards to the Thomson research.\n\nMcIntosh\n\nMcCombie\n\n(USA)\n\n(105)\n\nAdded 17/05/19\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer’s 2nd great grandmother is Laura Ann McIntosh, said to be descended from John McIntosh (1662-1729) from Wester Drakies, Inverness-shire whose father was John Iain Mohr McIntosh (1614-1674). She would appreciate more details about this line including the connection to the name McCombie?\n\nR\n\nSennachie first gave a short explanation about the name McCombie. This is more of a “modern” surname within the Clan MacThomas that is said to stem from McComie when clansfolk emigrated from Perthshire to Aberdeenshire in the late 16th and the 17th century. There is no evidence that the surname McCombie was used by the chiefly family of the Clan MacThomas. Nor is there any evidence of a link between a McCombie and McIntosh. Due to the lack of records that early its not possible to prove such a link. See the following pages on this website:\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/septmccombie.html\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/genealogyarticlesons.html\n\nIt also should be appreciated that in pre1700 times some supporters of Clans took up using a surname for the first time by adopting one of the Clan's main surnames, eg McComie, without being a blood relation. That means it cannot be assumed that a person today having a Clan name must be related to the chiefly line some time in the past. Its more likely not so. McIntosh is not a sept of the Clan MacThomas.\n\nIn your McIntosh line you have stated that the father of John McIntosh, born 1662, of Wester Drakies in Inverness Shire, was “John Iain Morh McIntosh” This is clearly wrong. John the 7th Chief had six sons, the last being born in 1645. It is highly unlikely that his wife Elizabeth had any more children, certainly not in 1662 - please see this website page:\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/genealogytreesearlychiefsnew.html\n\nFrom what you have provided your McIntosh line appears to come from Inverness Shire while the Chiefs of the Clan MacThomas lived in Perthshire. In those days the Clan MacThomas had connections to the eastern counties but there is no evidence of links to the north-west.\n\nThomson\n\n(USA)\n\n(104)\n\nAdded 22/04/19\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer has just started trying to compile a family tree. One line goes back to John Thomson who emigrated to the USA from Scotland. John was born in 1730 (either January or April) and was the son of Uzal Thomson. A web search for Uzal found an entry on the Clan's website but just as a reference that Uzal was the father of John. So for now this faimily line seems to end with John and Uzal Thomson. Does your Society know anything further about Uzal and his wife?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that what was found were extracts from a book, and placed on our website to help people who are researching their family history. The fact that the entries from the book are listed on our website, does not necessarily mean there is a connection to our Clan. Also Sennachie is not aware of the source the author used to create his listing, so perhaps it may be useful for the enquirer to have a look at this book. It may be listed in the online catalogue of the Library of Congress.\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/genealogydatadseusa.html\n\nhttps://openlibrary.org/books/OL5305188M/A_dictionary_of_\n\nScottish_emigrants_to_the_U.S.A.\n\nAs to the surname Thomson having a connection to the Clan MacThomas please read this page on our website:\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/septthomson.html\n\nIn regards to a person named Uzal Thomson living in Scotland in the early 1700s, a search of the official Scottish government website Scotlands People did not find any use of the given name Uzal (or variations). This is not a surprise, as Sennachie's reaction to this given name was that it is most likely Uzal Thomson was born in the USA and not Scotland. https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk\n\nMcComb\n\n(USA)\n\n(103)\n\nAdded 11/04/19\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer’s paternal line is Scottish. Andrew McComb married Christina Bell in mid 1700s and had at least three sons, while living in County Cork, Ireland. He referred to himself as a Scotsman and is said to have been born around Aberdeen in 1740. His son James was born in 1765 and by 1882 he and two brothers had made their way to Augusta County, Virginia, USA. Family history says the McCombs were of the MacKintosh Clan; even using their crest motto. The enquirer asks whether does the Clan know anything of Andrew McComb circa 1740? Also whether the Clan took part in the Battle of Culloden? Any information would be gladly appreciated.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that in relation to the Clan MacIntosh, the surname McComb was only used in Scotland from about the second half of the 1600s, and from the early 1700s in Ireland. In other words after the Clan MacThomas was established in the Glenshee area around 1500. Therefore it is generally accepted by Clans that McComb is a Clan MacThomas sept rather than Clan MacIntosh. Read a brief history of the Clan MacThomas at:\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/septmccomb.html\n\nhttps://clanmacthomas.uk/pages/clanhistory.html\n\nWas Andrew was born in Scotland? It is doubtful this has been proved by any researcher of this family. On the website worldconnect, there are three relevant trees, of which only one says, without proof, he was born in Scotland. On the website familysearch.org there are again three trees with two, without proof, saying he was born in Scotland. There are probably relevant trees on paid sites such as ancestry and myheritage. There is a possibility he was born in Ireland. This could be difficult to prove as many records were destroyed in Dublin in the Troubles in 1922; see the following link:\n\nhttps://www.irish-genealogy-toolkit.com/irish-records-burned.html\n\nIn relation to Culloden there are no known comprehensive lists of soldiers who took part in the 1746 Battle. Many names of officers are known but not the common soldier. None of the known officers had a Clan MacThomas sept name, and in the history of the Clan there is no mention of any clansfolk taking part in the Battle. But it is possible. If some did then they probably were in the Clan Chattan group, see link below. By the time of Culloden, the Clan MacThomas was well and truely dormant, see Clan history. So it is impossible to say that a McComb family member took part in the Battle.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Culloden\n\nhttps://www.unknownscottishhistory.com/articlefourteen.php\n\nThom\n\n(France)\n\n(102)\n\nAdded 31/03/19\n\nQ\n\nThe member is trying to find information about great grandfather James Thom, and his father John. The only information to hand is that James Thom was born in 1843 or 1844 in Aberdeen (according to Census returns of 1871 and 1881. His marriage certificate states his father was John Thom, a sheriff officer. James Thom married Eliza Root and they had 6 children; James, Robert, Isabella, Emma, Agatha and the enquirer's grandfather Donald Roy.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that the challenge is the change in Scotland from baptisms, marriages, and burials conducted by religious institutions, ie, churches, to the introduction in 1855 in Scotland of civil registration of births, marriages and deaths. This results in there being less information recorded in the earlier parish registers. Also the formal taking of a census did not begin in the UK until 1831, and then every 10 years since. However no personal details have been retained of the 1831 census. As a result census returns for 1841 to 1901 are a valuable link between the civil registration period and the church period for births, deaths and marriage details.\n\nThe other major problem is that its easy to come across multiple likely results, say of Thom births/baptisms pre 1856 and its a challenge to establish which is one's ancestor. This is also coupled with spelling variations. For example, a Thom ancestor may have been baptised with the surname Thoms.\n\nAs James was likely to have been born in Aberdeen in about 1843/44 and his father’s name is John, check using the website familysearch.org as there is one entry of interest. This baptism can also be found in the church records index on the official website ScotlandsPeople. A good move is to establish the name of James’ mother. Search the census returns for 1851 and 1861 looking for James Thom.\n\nThomas\n\n(USA)\n\n(101)\n\nAdded 31/03/19\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer’s surname is Robinson and his grandmother’s maiden name is Thomas. DNA results indicate a strong link to Scotland. He asks if the Clan's records reveal a Robinson with a link to Thomas? Great Great grandfather was James Henry Thomas, born 1843 in South Carolina, who married Sarah Francis Scott. The enquirer is interested in becoming a Clan Society member if there is a link to the Clan MacThomas. .\n\nR\n\nIn the Clan records, Sennachie has found no Robinson/Thomas connection. In order to claim a Thomas link with the Clan MacThomas the enquirer needs to research their Thomas line back in time to see if they come from one of the highland counties in the east of Scotland, such as Perthshire, Aberdeenshire, Fife, and Angus. There are a number of relevant trees on several websites (details provided). None go back to Scotland indicating that is a real challenge. That means the task of trying to link to the Clan MacThomas is difficult unless there is a DNA match to a person who can link to the Clan.\n\nThoms\n\n(UK)\n\n(100)\n\nAdded 22/12/18\n\nQ\n\nA long time member would like to add information to some incomplete branches on his family tree. He wants to establish whether there are any descendents from the siblings of his maternal great grandfather, Thomas Hunter Thoms. He would welcome any information or advice on how to proceed.\n\nR\n\nSennachie carried out some research using the following websites - scotlandspeople (births, deaths, marriages, and census returns), ancestry.com (deaths, naturalisation, census return for Arizona, USA), findagrave, billiongraves and docplayer.net (monumental inscriptions). Of the enquirer’s six great great uncles and aunts, only one appears to have the possibility of living descendants.\n\nGeorge Duncan Thoms appears to have died in 1863 aged 21 years, unmarried.\n\nJames Henry Thoms appears to have died in 1883 aged 41 years, unmarried.\n\nElizabeth Mitchell Thoms married David Scott Fergusson in 1866; they had three children who all died unmarried.\n\nWilliam Henry Thoms died 1848 aged 7 months.\n\nPatrick Hunter Thoms, died 1870 aged 22 in Brazil.\n\nAlexander Russell Thoms married in 1881 (died 1909 in Arizona) to Mary Buchanan Brown, they had two children, William Brown Thoms who died in 1960 in California, unmarried, and Nellie Chick Thoms, who married Alfred L Rogers and they had at least two children, Veral Rogers born 1904 and Milton Rogers born 1907 who married Alis Quakenbush in 1937 in California.\n\nTo see what Californian records are available go to the Wiki Section of the familysearch website.\n\nMackholmes\n\nMacKolmes\n\nMacCulm\n\nMacCoones\n\n(USA)\n\n(099)\n\nAdded 02/12/18\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer on Facebook asked whether the surnames Mackolmes/MacCulm/MacCoones part of the Clan MacThomas?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that there are many spelling variations for some of the sept names, especially in the USA. Some variations such as MacCoones are difficult to connect to a Scottish surname. It is unlikely to be connected to Mackholme. Changes happened as people penning spelt it as it sounded to them. As Mackholme and MacCulm may come from MacColm/McColm which is a sept of the Clan MacThomas, people with these surnames can apply for membership of the Clan MacThomas Society. MacCoones is not connected to Clan MacThomas.\n\nThomson\n\n(USA)\n\n(098)\n\nAdded 02/12/18\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer’s grandfather, John Bruce Thomson, was born in April 1893 in Methil in the District of Buckhaven, Fife. His parents being David Thomson and Margaret White. John emigrated to Canada around 1912 then to USA. She asks if the Sennachie can provide more information.\n\nR\n\nSennachie suggested website scotlandspeople, to access births, deaths, and marriages, census returns and wills. Other general sites that may be useful are familysearch and worldconnect. Buckhaven is in the Parish of Wemyss. Good sites to learn what parish records exist and where they are held (or copies) is the Wiki section of familysearch, and the Genuki section on Fife. Local websites that may be useful include the Buckhaven Library and Museum, Methil Library, Fife County Archives, and the Fife Council Archives. Sennachie also provided were some specific records found on familysearch\n\nTomé\n\n(UK)\n\n(097)\n\nAdded 24/11/18\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer’s family surname is Tomé and this Portuguese name is said to be the equivalent of Thomas. Does the Clan MacThomas have a presence in Portugal and what is the origin of this uncommon surname?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that surname probably goes back to the era of when people started to use surnames with a given names. It is said that Tomé is equivalent of Thomas in English. That does not mean it comes from Thomas, perhaps Thomas came from Tomé. We just dont know. It could be that someone in Portugal way back in the 14th century simply started using Tomé as a surname.\n\nBy accessing the website familysearch, a search for Tomé in Portugal will reveal over 1000 results, a very small number.\n\nSennachie doubts very much there will be a connection to Scotland, and therefore no connection to the Clan MacThomas. Perhaps the enquirer might consider doing a DNA test as that will give a general indication of where the Tomé ancestors lived back in time. Or maybe undertake standard family history research.\n\nThom\n\n(USA)\n\n(096)\n\nAdded 23/11/18\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer’s grandfather, Norman William Thom, was born to John Mollision Thom of Dundee and Mary Ann Crichton Smith of Edinburgh on 19th January 1920 in New York USA. She would like to know if John has a connection to the Clan and something about the history of this Thom line.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that as the enquirer's grandfather has the surname Thom and has a connection to Scotland, this means your Thom ancestors have a connection to the Clan MacThomas and that you can become a full member of the Clan MacThomas Society.\n\nThe first step is to obtain a copy of your grandfather's birth certificate and check for other information by clicking here.\n\nAs his naturalisation certificate gives John Mollison Thom’s birth date in Scotland use the website scotlandspeople to search back in time using birth, death and marriage indexes and records, census records and possibly wills, all online for a cost.\n\nSome Thom family trees may be found on websites such as familysearch, worldconnect, myheritage, ancestry. It should be appreciated that family trees on websites should be treated with caution, as experienced researchers find that many trees contain errors, usually due to wrong assumptions.\n\nThom\n\n(Canada)\n\n(095)\n\nAdded 22/09/18\n\nQ\n\nEnquirer would like to find more information about grandmother, Annie Christie Neil Thom, born in Glasgow in 1895, and her ancestors. Any help to learn where to begin searching would be appreciated.\n\nR\n\nSennachie suggested a visit to the local public library to borrow books on how to research family history, especially one that includes information on Scotland research. Also joining a local family history society, if there is one, as they will help with research.\n\nA useful website as a guide to internet sources for Scotland is GENUKI - http://www.genuki.org.uk.\n\nIn relation to the internet, the main site for Scotland is scotlandspeople - https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk.\n\nIt would be useful to obtain grandmother's birth certificate from scotlandspeople. The next step could be to search the 1901 Scottish census on scotlandspeople for the parents of Annie.\n\nIf Annie came to the US/Canada when she was young, her parents probably emigrated. So maybe search for Annie in the Canadian Census returns, say for 1911, and also obtain Annie’s marriage certificate as this may name her parents.\n\nMcColm\n\n(USA)\n\n(094)\n\nAdded 31/08/18\n\nQ\n\nA member is interested in researching his McColm ancestors. There are family trees on 'ancestry.com' that show ancestor Malcolm McColm and his father John were born in Strabane, Ireland in 1769 and 1730. Both died in the USA. The challenge is to find missing information such as the birth of John’s father in Scotland.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised of the need to check the published information in family trees on the internet such as ancestry.com against original sources. There are relevant McColm trees on other web sites such as worldconnect and familysearch.org. Another interesting site is:\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/mccolmfamilyhistory.\n\nOne of the main sites for Scottish research is scotlandspeople. Regardless of the challenges, as the member's grandmother’s maiden surname is McColm, he has a connection to our Clan and is most welcome.\n\nMcComb\n\n(USA)\n\n(093)\n\nAdded 13/08/18\n\nQ\n\nA member asked whether a tree on Ancestry is correct. Her ancestor Jacob James McComb’s father was William McComb and grandfather William Thomas McComb. Both William (b 1710) and William Thomas (b1680) were said to have been born in Ireland. Also the father of William Thomas McComb is stated to be John MMcComb(ie) born 1600 in Crandart, Scotland, (married Elizabeth Campbell) and his father Alexander McCommie, born 1578 Finegand (married to Margaret Small).\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that this may be an attempt to incorrectly link a McComb family in Ireland with the chiefly tree in Scotland. There are articles in the Genealogy section of the Clan’s web site that clearly indicate such connections are unlikely. First it is difficult to prove a link between Ireland and Scotland - although this is shown on the Clan Migration Map. Second no evidence has been found of members of the chiefly family changing their name to surnames such as McComb, McCombe, McCombie. Third is that its unlikely that a man born in 1600 would have a child born in 1680. This does not mean that members with these sept names are not members of Clan MacThomas.\n\nThom\n\n(Australia)\n\n(092)\n\nAdded 11/06/18\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer has been researching his Thom ancestors and has got back as far as Alexander Thom who married Margaret Gib in 1763 in Rothiemay, County Banff. There is a gap in the baptism records from 1711 to 1747. He requested advice on next research steps and asks if there a connection to Clan MacThomas?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that the web sites scotlandspeople and familysearch confirm the gap in the baptism records. A search of the baptism indexes on both these sites for Alexander Thom over the period 1700 to 1750 reveals many entries. Also a search for Thom baptisms in Banff 1658 and 1710 reveal 43 baptisms, all in the parish of St Fergus. Sennachie suggests that this may be where Alexander’s ancestors lived. But because of the gap in the Rothiemay records it is virtually impossible to go back any further. However as the enquirer's Scottish ancestor is named Thom it is accepted that there is a connection to the Clan MacThomas, perhaps by migration from Glenshee to Banff via Aberdeen.\n\nThomas\n\n(USA)\n\n(091)\n\nAdded 11/08/18\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer’s family has always said that they had connections to Ireland and Scotland. His grandfather was Burely McDonald Thomas.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that Thomas was a popular surname in the UK and Ireland, especially in England and Wales, and to a lessor extent in Ireland and Scotland. A search of the web sites worldconnect and ancestry revealed a number of relevant trees - Burley’s father is stated as Willis Washington Thomas, his grandfather William Hunsucker Thomas, great grandfather Aaron Obediah Thomas, and great great grandfather Joseph Thomas, all born in the USA. This line may go back to a Hugh Thomas in Maryland in the 1600s. If this is relevant then the most likely connection is to Wales. None of the family trees found has a connection to the UK or Ireland. Sennachie suggests that further research is needed.\n\nThom\n\n(USA)\n\n(090)\n\nAdded 24/02/18\n\nQ\n\nMuch research has been carried out on Thom line back to Joseph Thom who was born in the 1740s possibly in Ireland or Scotland. Help is needed to resolve his origin and trip to America.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that there are related trees on three web sites and that he has found a variety of data relating to the origins of Joseph Thom said to be born about 1743. Many Americans researching their family history find it difficult, if not impossible, to trace back to where their ancestors came from prior to their arrival in America. And this includes Joseph Thom.\n\nThe website familysearch.org has one Joseph Thom tree with origins in County Down, born about 1743 and another about 1748 in Aberdeen. The web site worldconnect has 30 related trees, with birth about 1743 or 1748, and in County Down, Ireland, Scotland, Aberdeen, and Pennsylvania. Ancestry has 212 with birth about 1743 (125) and 1748 (87). Lots give the birth place as Ireland, Pennsylvania and some in Scotland.\n\nOf course many of these trees may be simply repeating what they have found in other trees online. This is an indication that everyone is guessing.\n\nUsually the information about a person’s origins , if extant, can be found in the records of the “new” country. It looks like this information does not exist as none of the above trees refers to arrival data.\n\nNo baptism could be found for a Joseph Thom in Ireland around 1740s, in ancestry and familysearch.org. But many Irish church records have been destroyed. Four possible baptisms of a Joseph Thom in Scotland 1730-1760, were found on scotlandspeople. Any one of them could be the enquirer's Joseph.\n\nMcComas\n\n(USA)\n\n(089)\n\nAdded 24/02/18\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer was seeking information about ancestor Daniel McComas, born 1662 in Scotland, who married Elizabeth, and settled in Boston in 1685.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that two free web sites provide a variety of data related to the origins of a Daniel McComas, who is said to have been born about 1666. Many Americans doing their family history find it difficult, if not impossible, to trace their ancestors back to where they came from prior to their arrival in America. And this includes Daniel McComas.\n\nThere are 208 relevant trees on website worldconnect and around sixty on familysearch.org. Some researchers state he was a captain of the guard at Edinburgh Castle in about 1678. It is doubtful that Daniel McComas born 1666 would have been a captain at age 12 or even at 16 years.\n\nThe official Scottish government website, scotlandspeople, for early baptisms revealed no baptism for a Daniel McComas during the period 1630 to 1670. This is not absolute as some records are missing. The Society received an enquiry some years ago; please scroll down to entry 31 on this page.\n\nCombs/\n\nComb\n\n(USA)\n\n(088)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 10/01/18\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer’s Combs ancestors lived in London in the 1700s. DNA testing indicates Welsh, Scottish or Irish heritage. Can the enquirer wear the MacThomas tartan?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that there is no legal restriction to wearing any tartan. However, tradition and etiquette means that wearers of Clan tartans should limit their choice to a tartan that has a connection to a surname of an ancestor. Some tartans have no connection to a Scottish highland Clan.\n\nCombs (or Comb) is a widely spread name in the UK with a majority being English. There is no apparent connection to the Clan MacThomas. However there could be a connection where there has been a spelling variation or where the Combs ancestor in the 1700s came from the Scottish highland counties of Perthshire, Aberdeenshire, Angus or Kincardineshire.\n\nMcCoomb\n\n(NK)\n\n(087)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 22/12/17\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer asked if the name McCoomb is related to the MacThomas clan.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that McCoomb is not a surname used in Scotland. It appears to have been used only in Canada, USA and Australia to a very limited extent. This is a clear indication this surname is a spelling variation, probably from McComb, which is a sept name of our Clan.\n\nThomson\n\n(UK)\n\n(086)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 17/12/17\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer’s grandparents Stanley Robert Thomson and Jean Clark married in Scotland in 1957 and it is said their Thomson line went back several centuries in Aberdeenshire. DNA results indicate the ancestors came from the NE of Scotland and the central highlands. The enquirer asks if this indicates a link to the Clan MacThomas?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that if Thomson ancestors were born in the counties of Perthshire, Fife, Aberdeenshire and Kincardinshire then it is accepted there is a connection to the Clan MacThomas. Descendants can join our Society. Specific likely information was provided. Dont forget a DNA test by ancestryDNA will give information about all the enquirer's ancestors, not just the Thomson line.\n\nThom\n\n(New Zealand)\n\n(085)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 18/11/17\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer's ancestor, John Thom, was baptised on 2nd February 1740 in Elrick, Aberdeenshire. He married Jean Taylor in Fife on 21st June 1769. She asks if this Thom family is a Sept of the Clan MacThomas? If so, would this mean that our Clan tartan is that of the MacThomas Clan?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that having a Thom ancestor from Aberdeenshire is sufficient to have a connection to the Clan MacThomas. In fact it is enough to have the surname Thom with a Thom ancestor from Scotland.\n\nThere is no official register of who belongs to which Clan. It is all based on surnames and its even better to have an ancestor from Scotland. Sometimes with certain surnames, eg Thomson, a connection with an area in Scotland is needed, but not so for Thom. This surname is only associated with the Clan MacThomas.\n\nIn regards to tartans, it is as simple as which tartan is recognised by a Chief of the Clan as being the Clan Tartan. There are two MacThomas tartans - the ancient and the modern - for details see the web site - link.\n\nIt is very important for the tartan to be as specified at the bottom of the above page. Anyone can wear any tartan but convention usually means that only those associated with a particular Clan, wear that Clan's tartan.\n\nThoms\n\n(Germany)\n\n(084)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 17/10/17\n\nQ\n\nA member asked for assistance in finding more about grandparents Franz and Marie Thoms. They lived in Leba on the Baltic Sea, where their five children were probably born, before World War Two. Today Leba is in Poland. The family probably moved to the Hessen area around WW2 where descendants live today.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that due to World War Two researching German records can be difficult. The first step is to contact relatives to find out what they know about the Thoms family. Read a book on how to research genealogy or look online for research advice, on web sites such as familysearch.org. Visit your local family history society. A good web site for German research is https://www.genealoger.com.\n\nThom\n\n(Canada)\n\n(083)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 12/06/17\n\nQ\n\nAn enquirer was about to visit Scotland for the first time and asked for the Society's assistance in finding where his grandfather James Robertson Thom (born c 1898) lived in Scotland.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that James was born in Gartly, Aberdeenshire during the first quarter of 1898 to Walter Thom and Mina Stephen. Walter and Mina were married in 1896 in Kelvin, Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire. In the 1901 Census they are living in Gartly.\n\nWalter was born in Auchindoir, Aberdeenshire in 1870, the son of James Thom and Mary Baxter. James Thom was born in about 1835 in Dunnottar, Kincardineshire, the son of John Thom and Jane (Jean) Savage. John was also born in Dunnottar, Kincardineshire in 1792.\n\nSennachie provided some links about the above places in case a visit to Aberdeenshire was planned:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartly\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Kirk,_Auchindoir\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunnottar_Castle\n\nThe Clan MacThomas was based in the Glenshee area in Perthshire in the 17th Century and a good number of the Clan migrated to Aberdeen and in the County of Aberdeen.\n\nThom\n\n(USA)\n\n(082)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 16/04/17\n\nQ\n\nA follower has asked for an image of the Thom Family Crest\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that when a grant of arms is made it will include a crest. For Scottish names such as Thom, grants are made by the Lord Lyon of Scotland, an appointed government official. Individuals with Scottish ancestry can apply for a grant of arms from the Lord Lyon.\n\nA grant of arms and crest belong to the person who received the grant and no one else, not even his children. They can apply for a grant which usually will be based on their father’s. If the mother’s family has a grant of arms, then parts of it may be incorporated in the children’s arms (and crest). On the internet there are two crests for Thom relating to Germany, one for England; they may not be connected.\n\nThom is accepted as a sept of the Clan MacThomas. The Chief of the Clan has a grant of arms, including a crest - please click here to view.\n\nThe crest badge can be purchased from the MacThomas Clan Society, and worn by a person having a sept name. But it is not a Thom family crest. Under Scottish law it legally belongs to the Chief, and can be worn by clansfolk as a form of recognition as connected to the Clan MacThomas.\n\nMcCumber\n\nMcComber\n\n(USA)\n\n(081)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n#*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 16/04/17\n\nQ\n\nA researcher has been working hard to find his family clan. Georgina McCumber, of Ontario, Canada, was his great grandmother's (Beatrice Verna Raymond) mother, a descendant of Constant Macomber, who fought in the revolutionary war for the U.S. colonies. He has been told that 'Macomber' comes from the Gaelic 'MacThomaidh', which I believe is Clan MacThomas. He asks if this is correct?\n\nR\n\nSennachie responds that the surname McCumber and McComber are not names connected to the Clan MacThomas, and do not appear to be Scottish. Our Clan has had enquiries before regarding these names and variations - please click here to read an article explaining this.\n\nThe only way for the enquirer to find out the origin of his McCumber ancestor is to carry out family history research. Web sites worldconnect and ancestry.com have several McComber/McCumber trees. Please click here to read a relevant Facebook page.\n\nFor an explanation about surnames click here.\n\nMcComb/\n\nMcCombs\n\n(USA)\n\n(080)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 05/02/17\n\nQ\n\nThis member would like to hear from other members with McComb ancestors who have had their DNA tested. The member has been in contact with several McComb men and formed three small groups based on DNA results. She would like to make contact with other McComb/McCombs who have had their DNA tested or are interested in having their DNA tested, especially members who have researched their family tree.\n\nR\n\nIf anyone is interested in this enquiry and would like to make contact with the enquirer, please contact our Sennachie, or the webmaster.\n\nThomson\n\n(USA)\n\n(079)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 05/02/17\n\nQ\n\nThis member wishes to know more about his Thomson ancestors. Some years ago a professional researcher in Edinburgh reported that the member's ancestors James Simpson and Janet Thomson lived in the parish of Madderty, Perthshire in the late 16th century and that their son, James, was born there in about 1797. The member would be appreciate more information about them and their parents .\n\nR\n\nSennachie searched the parish records for Madderty on both Scotlandspeople and Familysearch and both revealed that an Anne Thomson married James Simpson in 1796 and that this couple then had three children baptised at Madderty - James in 1797, John in 1799 and Anne in 1801. The name Janet was given on the death certificate of son James in 1869 by grandson James. Sennachie considers the evidence now indicates Janet should be Anne Thomson. Sennachie suggests that further research using Familysearch and Scotlandspeople may reveal more.\n\nMcColm\n\n(Australia)\n\n(078)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 10/11/16\n\nQ\n\nA member wishes to know more about her McColm ancestors. Thomas McColm is thought to have been born in about 1830 in Londonderry, Ireland, the son of Hugh McColm. Thomas married Mary Jane Burt in 1866 in Wellington, NSW, Australia. Thomas’ son Thomas Edmund McColm died in 1939 at Mosman, NSW.\n\nR\n\nSennachie suggested that the NSW marriage and death certificates for Thomas should be obtained as they could reveal information about his origins in Ireland and confirm the names of his parents. The 1831 Irish Census on familysearch.org revealed that a Hugh McColm was living in Londonderry. If he lived beyond 1864 then his death should be indexed in the civil records on the web site https://www.irishgenealogy.ie/en/. Irish records are difficult to research because many were destroyed in 1922 “troubles”.\n\nMcCombs\n\n(USA)\n\n(077)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 10/11/16\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer's ancestor, Andrew McCombs is said to have been born in Wigtownshire, Scotland. Nothing is known beyond Andrew's birth in about 1740. In early US records his last name was on occasions spelt “MacKooms”. He married Anna Hilts in New York in 1768. She asks if the Society find more.\n\nR\n\nSennachie noted that there are severals trees on Ancestry.com and none of them have any further information beyond Andrew. Also on familysearch.org there are three Andrew McComb parish entries in Wigtownshire in the 1700's but none that can be linked to the enquirer's Andrew. It would seem that the use of MacKooms is a variation that started to be used only in the US after Andrew’s arrival as this spelling does not appear in old Scottish records, especially on the site ScotlandsPeople. There are a number of options in Scottish records as to the spelling of his surname such as McComb, McCombs, Combe. As the name is a sept of the Clan MacThomas, descendants of Andrew the enquirer is entitled to become a member of the Society.\n\nThomas\n\n(Australia)\n\n(076)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\nAdded 09/11/16\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer asked whether having a grandmother whose birth name was Thomas qualifies to apply for membership of Clan MacThomas? Her name was Annetta Thomas and she was born in Stansfield, West Yorkshire on 3rd February 1849, father Robert Thomas and mother Mary Stansfield.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that as Thomas is also a popular surname across the UK, especially in Wales, there would be a need to have a Thomas connection to the eastern highlands counties of Scotland, especially Aberdeen, Perth, Fife, and Kincardine. A search of census returns on the web site familysearch.org revealed that in 1861 father Robert Thomas, age 49, stated he was born in Rochdale, West Yorkshire. Also this Robert was likely baptised on 30 July 1812, at nearby Todmorden, son of John and Betty Thomas. More research is needed, as there is a possiblity that an earlier Thomas may have come from Scotland, but this will probably be difficult to prove and perhaps unlikely.\n\nMcChomay(s)\n\n(USA)\n\n(075)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\nAdded 16/08/16\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer recently found the name of one of his ancestors on a death certificate (for her daughter) that has her name written as McChomays. He could only find that name on www.electricscotland.com where they have it attached to clan McThomas. It could not be found on any reference anywhere else. It is assumed she lived and died in Northern Ireland as her husband Francis Breen was born and died in Northern Ireland, and all her children were born in Northern Ireland. The enquirer asked if Sennachie knows of any background that can help him?\n\nR\n\nSennachie responded that it is possible that surname McChomays originated from a Clan sept name, maybe McComie. Sennachie has not come across this name at all before. That means it is not certain that there is a link to the Clan MacThomas. It is likely that some surname websites try hard to link a Scottish looking surname to a Clan by simply selecting what they think is the most likely.\n\nOne of the issues in American research is that of name changes. Many immigrants on arrival could not read or write and the officials recording details for them were usually of English origin and had trouble understanding others, such as people coming from Scotland. So they simply wrote down an interpretation of what they heard. Then this spelling continued to be used or even varied again. Looking at possible variations, the “ay\" could be \"ie\" - McChomie. Then taking a step further it could be Mchomie, and this is an old version within the Clan MacThomas.\n\nIt is not possible to say with some certainty that McChomays was Scottish or even if they came from Scotland - “Mac” or “Mc” is not an absolute indicator that they came from Scotland. They could from Ireland or England.\n\nMcOmish\n\n(England)\n\n(074)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\nAdded 11/08/16\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer's grandfather is Robert McOmish and his wife Margaret Queen. Paternal great-grandfather married a McTaggart, and there is some suggestion of variations McOmish and McComish. They lived in Glasgow and possibly before that in Perthshire. Would like any further information.\n\nR\n\nSennachie suggested searching for McOmish births, marriages and deaths on the official Scottish web site scotlandspeople, then work backwards in time using such records as census returns and wills. Also read the help articles on scotlandspeople and the Clan’s web site. McOmish is generally accepted in the world of Scottish Clans as being a sept of the Clan MacThomas.\n\nCombe\n\n(SA)\n\n(073)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n***\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\nAdded 11/04/16\n\nQ\n\nA follower of the Clan is trying to trace his ancestry. Father Robert Macleod Combe was born in Linlithgow near Edinburgh and served as a Lance Corporal in the British Commando No. 6 Battalion. His father Robert Combe was the Town Clerk in Linlithgow. The family emigrated to South Africa in 1961. The follower would appreciate any pointers.\n\nR\n\nSennachie responded by explaining that Combe is one of the sept names of the Clan, and that it is accepted if a person named Combe has a link to Scotland then there is a link to the Clan MacThomas. The web site Scotlandspeople is the official Scottish government site where it is recorded your father was born on 4th March 1923 and that his father was Robert Lincoln Combe. The web site Geni (http://www.geni.com/) states that Robert Lincoln Combe was born on 11th March 1879 and that his father is Thomas Combe.\n\nIn relation to middle given names it is common practice in\n\nScotland for a baby to be baptised with one given name and for the middle name to be added some time later. It is likely that an entry for a Robert Combe in the 1891 Census recorded on the free web site familysearch.org, is relevant so Sennachie suggested obtaining the full family census entry from scotlandspeople.\n\nFurther research on these sites is recommended and it may be\n\nuseful to contact or even join the West Lothian Family History\n\nSociety:- http://www.wlfhs.org.uk\n\nCumbie\n\n(USA)\n\n(072)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n]*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n***\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\nAdded 28/02/16\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer would like information about their branch of the family Combie as they are trying to put together the Family history. They wants to find out when and why ancestors Cumbie or Combie came to the USA, as the family has been in the US for a long time, and why the spelling of the name changed. Some members used the name Combie at the time of the Civil War. Research is ongoing.\n\nR\n\nSennachie noted that there are quite a lot of Cumbie trees on ancestry.com and familysearch.org and not one has a link to Scotland. Only one has indicated a spelling variation of Combie. What evidence is there of a name change? This is because the name Cumbie appears in England in the 1600s, e.g., in Norfolk - more so than in Scotland. In Scotland there appear to be Cumbie families in the lowlands. All this indicates that Cumbie is likely to have no connection with our Clan and that the US Cumbie background has a greater chance of having English connections rather than Scottish. It also casts doubt on a name change from Combie, unless there is clear proof this occurred. The main reason/explanation of a spelling change is that when the emigrant arrived in the US the officials recording early events, e.g. ministers, made a best guess at how the surname was spelt. Finding a change in one generation in the US at the time of the Civil War is probably not sufficient proof.\n\n*******\n\nAs to where the first Cumbie came from in the UK, assuming it is the UK, the answer will be in US records, if at all. Those researching this name that have recorded their trees on the internet appear not to solve this. It should be noted that another spelling variation is Cambie, especially in England.\n\nComee\n\n(Japan/US)\n\n(071)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n***\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\nAdded 18/01/16\n\nQ\n\nA Society member descended from David Comee who died at Sudbury, Massachusetts USA in 1676 asked the Sennachie to comment on his tree, which shows that this David is David McComie, the son of Alexander, the 6th Chief of the Clan MacThomas and his wife Margaret Small.\n\nR\n\nSennachie has carried out extensive research on-line and into published material about the Clan's history and in particular the 6th Chief. As a result an article he has written is now available on this website, which concludes that David Comee, c1635-1676, is not the son of Alexander, 6th Chief, and his wife Margaret Small. The article can be read by clicking here.\n\n*****\n\nHowever, descendants of David Comee are accepted as clansfolk of the Clan MacThomas.\n\nMcComb\n\n(US)\n\n(070)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n***\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\nAdded 10/10/15\n\nQ\n\nPrior to visiting Scotland a member from the USA would like to establish sites in Glenshee and Aberdeen where his McComb ancestors could have lived according to information on the Clan's web site\n\nR\n\nSennachie carried out some research on the internet and by establishing that the Society's member's grandfather George A McComb died in 1954 in Pennsylvania, was then able to find trees of free sites such as worldconnect and familysearch that take his ancestors back to General James McComb who was born near Belfast in 1758. It may be difficult to establish a link to Scotland although the Clan is aware that McComb clansfolk did migrate from Glenshee to Aberdeen to Ireland.\n\nThom\n\n(US)\n\n(069)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n8\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\nAdded 31/05/15\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer's Grandfather was Alan Louis Thom, and his father was John Robertson Thom (both born and married in Scotland). John was born in 1889 in Dundee, parents James Thom and Susan Lindsay Robertson.\n\nShe is interested to learn more about what our Society does - such as events or committees. She also asks how she can become a member of the Clan Society?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that Thom is the most common surname amongst members of the Clan Society. The Clan Gathering was held at Pitlochry, Scotland in late August 2014. Reports about the Gathering appear on the Clan web site. The gathering is held every three years. The Clan Society has three branches: Australia, North America and Europe. Each Branch has functions from time to time, although it should appreciated that distance is an issue for a small Clan like ours.\n\nThere is a fair bit about activities on our website, although more is revealed to members in the secure areas. Also each member receives the Society's magazine and newsletters.\n\nTo join the Society, please click here.\n\n****\n\nInterestingly Sennachie could not find any reference to John Robertson Thom on free sites on the internet. But this could be his sister Davina's birth in 1891, on\n\nhttps://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XTFD-4LH\n\nTo find places in Scotland use Google and, for example, search for \"Dundee Scotland\".

See previous enquiries Numbers 8, 13, 26, 32, 35, 43, 50.\n\nR\n\nSennachie has again researched this group of names and written an article in which he concludes that not only is there no connection to the Clan, there appears to be no connection to Scotland in available records pre 1855. The possible origin from written records is southern England.

The enquirer hoped to learn a little bit more about the family's past.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that having the surname Thom means that our Chief accepts that you have a connection with the Clan MacThomas and that you may apply to join the Clan MacThomas Society.\n\n*****\n\nIn looking at the information that the enquirer provided, one of the first web sites to use is the free site familysearch.org. This site reveals details of four generations back from grandfather Hamilton Wesley Thom. Perhaps the enquirer's grandfather's papers will support this. Sennachie suggests looking further at this site and other sites such as http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com.\n\n*****\n\nOne of the challenges experienced by Americans researching back in time is establishing the connection from America to Scotland. Sennachie does not know if this has been done with the enquirer's tree. Further enquiries may reveal this.\n\nMcCombs\n\n(US)\n\n(066)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 04/04/15\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer is looking for a Robert McCombs who was born in about 1750; married a Margaret Wishard and lived in Lincoln County, North Carolina, fought in the Revolutionary War, and had a son named William.\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that a general search on the internet revealed nothing. He noted that others are researching this family and have not been able to establish these details. There are two trees on www.rootsweb.ancestry.com, and several trees on familysearch at familysearch.org/family-trees. Also there are possible ten trees on ancestry.com showing they had up to seven children.\n\nR\n\nSennachie considers that it is more than likely that the enquirer's surname has a Spanish background. However there is a possibility that it is connected to Scotland and the Clan MacThomas. One of the Clan names, as seen on this web site, is McComas. There are some instances, but not very many, where this name has been recorded as Comas. As a test, a surname search on the web site familysearch.org reveals only a few instances of Comas.\n\n*****\n\nThe only way to test a connection to Scotland, or to another location, is to carry out a standard family tree research by going back in time from yourself, your father, grandfather etc. This can be done by obtaining birth, death and marriage details. Sennachie knows little about researching family history in Spain but you could try a local library and see if they have any books on family history research. Also on familysearch you will see a section on Spain, go to:\n\n*****\n\nhttps://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Spain_Genealogy (link)\n\n*****\n\nAs to a link between Scotland and Spain in the past, Sennachie is sure that back in the 17th and 18th, and even earlier, some Scots did travel to Spain.\n\nThomson\n\n(US)\n\n(063)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 23/03/15\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer is trying to find out which Clan his family is descended from. He can trace back from his grandfather William Walker Thomson to the late 1700's to Alexander Thomson in Lanarkshire. He has completed 111 markers of DNA but has no real answers thus far. He asks if the Society can help him?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that as far as he is aware none of our Thomson members have been tested. Also it is still early days with DNA as there needs to be many more people tested who have also carried out extensive genealogical research. Our Chief will recognise a connection to the Clan MacThomas if a person has an ancestor, say Thomson, who was born in the eastern counties of the Scottish highlands, especially, for example, Perthshire and Aberdeenshire. I note your Thomson ancestors lived in Lanarkshire.\n\n*****\n\nCivil registration, ie vital statistics, started in Scotland in 1855. Prior to that it was up to the family if they wanted to have their children baptised and in what church. The other key record is a will but usually wills were only prepared for people with property and that meant only a small number. The same can be said of land records. So for the likes of most of our Scottish ancestors, it is usual to come to a dead end in the early 1800s or the mid 1700s, simply because of the difficulty of lack of information and the number of entries for the same name. For example there are probably many babies born around the late 1700s named Alexander Thomson and one is probably your ancestor, but its impossible to say which one.\n\n*****\n\nA search on the web site familysearch for the baptism of an Alexander Thomson in Scotland between 1780 and 1805 gave over 5000 results. Many will be duplicates but it does show the problem. If the search is restricted to Lanarkshire there are over 800 results. This may be as far as the research can go.\n\nComee\n\n(US)\n\n(062)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAdded 20/03/15\n\nQ\n\nThe enquirer can \"prove\" her ancestry back to David Comee, born about 1635 in Aberdeen, captured by the English and deported to Charlestown, in what is now Masschusetts in 1652. It appears that his parents were Alexander McComie and Margaret Small from Aberdeenshire. From the Clan website, it appears that Alexander was the 6th Chief. Is there any way that she can verify that information, and find out more about the earlier generations in Scotland?\n\nR\n\nSennachie advised that this enquiry is in the area of tradition rather than fact. It is difficult to know what is right and what is wrong. It is not known where son David of Alexander (6th Chief) and Margaret "
