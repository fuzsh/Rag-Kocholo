An insurance professor asked our class one time, “Have you ever read a car rental agreement? If you did you probably would not sign it.” Well an insurance policy isn’t that bad, but it does have exclusions and also exclusionary language through out. Most times an insured or business owner does not know what really is covered until after they report the claim. Have you ever asked at time of purchase what isn’t covered? Sure you can state you insured your building but for what? You may believe you have business interruption coverage, but for when? Did you know after a catastrophic weather event a large percentage of damage is not covered by insurance? It is either not insured at all, or was excluded under the current policy. And what about those large deductibles. Can your business weather an uninsured $100,000 loss, what about $500,000 or $1 million plus? Parametric insurance is a tool to assist in keeping your business and balance sheet afloat after catastrophic weather events. It supplements your current insurance to help fill in those uninsured and unexpected financial drains on your business. Ask your broker how parametric insurance can be a great addition to your current insurance program. #parametricinsurance #insuranceexclusions #hurricaneseason #weatherrisks #haildamage #flooddamage #floodinsurance #businessinterruption\n\nDiscover how Jade Sky Insurance protects what matters most to you with our comprehensive coverage plans.

DOES HOMEOWNERS’ INSURANCE COVER ROOF DAMAGE? The weight of snow or ice: Most carriers cover roof cave-ins or other damage caused by the weight of snow, sleet or ice on your roof, so review policy for specific details. Wind damage: Carriers cover wind damage to homes, including damage caused by wind itself and by falling objects like tree limbs. Wind deductibles can be higher on some policies.
