It doesn't mean that there's no-one with that name at all!\n\nFor less common surnames, the figures get progressively less reliable the fewer holders of that name there are. This data is aggregated from several public lists, and some stats are interpolated from known values. The margin of error is well over 100% at the rarest end of the table!\n\nFor less common surnames, the frequency and \"per million\" values may be 0 even though there are people with that name. That's because they represent less than one in a million of the population, which ends up as 0 after rounding.\n\nIt's possible for a surname to gain in rank and/or total while being less common per million people (or vice versa) as there are now more surnames in the USA as a result of immigration. In mathematical terms, the tail has got longer, with a far larger number of less common surnames.\n\nClassification and Origin of MCCULLEN\n\nRegion of origin: British Isles\n\nCountry of origin: Scotland\n\nLanguage of origin: Gaelic\n\nEthnic origin: Celtic\n\nReligious origin: Christian\n\nName derivation: From name of parent\n\nData for religion and/or language relates to the culture in which the MCCULLEN surname originated. It does not necessarily have any correlation with the language spoken, or religion practised, by the majority of current American citizens with that name.\n\nData for ethnic origin relates to the region and country in which the MCCULLEN surname originated. It does not necessarily have any correlation with the ethnicity of the majority of current American citizens with that name.\n\nEthnic distribution of MCCULLEN in the USA\n\nClassification Total Percent Black/African American 386 17.89 Mixed Race 32 1.48 White (Hispanic) 24 1.11 Asian/Pacific 17 0.79 Native American/Alaskan 17 0.79 White (Caucasian) 1,682 77.94\n\nEthnic distribution data shows the number and percentage of people with the MCCULLEN surname who reported their ethnic background as being in these broad categories in the most recent national census."
