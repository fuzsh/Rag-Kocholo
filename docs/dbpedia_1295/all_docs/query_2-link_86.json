Why did a good man die?\"\n\nThat is the time to say \"because he thought that he could get away\n\nwithout this precuation. He was wrong. What will you do when you\n\nget in your car?\"\n\nIf people realise that dying in a car accident isn't a thing\n\nthat only happens to strangers, then maybe they will spend just a little\n\nmore energy on protecting themselves. Meaning we don't have to go through\n\nthis again.\n\nMany years ago, when I was a small easily brainwashed child, I made my\n\nfather put on his seatbelt before he left the farm to drive into town -\n\nhe usually didn't, but they were insistent about it at school. Half an\n\nhour later when Mum and I left, we came across a car, upside downin a\n\nditch.... He was alive, hanging from his seatbelt.\n\nMaybe an SCA person will read of Osis's death, note that the seatbelt\n\nwas not on, remember it when they get into the car, and be found\n\nlike Dad - hanging upside down and alive.\n\nSilfren\n\n--\n\nZebee Johnstone (ze...@zip.com.au) Proud holder of aus.motorcycles Poser Permit #1.\n\n\"You don't own an Italian motorcycle\n\n- you merely have the privilege of paying its bills.\"\n\n> I don't think this is a good time for a safety\n\n> lesson. maybe I'm wrong.\n\nIts both the wrong time and the right time; however, I will agree with\n\nyou that this is the wrong time.\n\nBecause all this sad accident shows is a 50/50 chance of survival with\n\na seatbelt. From reading the Obituaries and Articles, I gather that the\n\nLady was indeed wearing her seat belt and she still did not make it\n\nthrough the rollover. Then again, his loose body may have contributed\n\nto her injuries. It tells me that this accident was probably worse than\n\nit was written up to be. No one will ever know... We can play the \"What\n\nIf...\" game until the end of time and still not know the true answer.\n\nI had a mundane friend killed several years ago who was wearing his\n\nseatbeat and the coroner said that it may have contributed to the extent\n\nof his internal injuries.\n\nI agree that this is not the right time, place, or example to use in\n\nthe seatbelt debate; however, I still wear mine and not because its the\n\nlaw. Its an unfortunate accident, they will be sourly missed, and this\n\ndebate should NOT have come up in this thread.\n\nSo who really knows except them and the Lord above.\n\n\n\n>\n\n>I agree that the message to wear seatbelts should be passed on, but I also\n\n>think that it could have waited at least until after the funerals.\n\n>\n\n>Ygraine\n\nWHY?? I mean WHY should we wait. As a LEO I have scraped and mopped up the\n\ndead, broken bodies of far too many people who died in TA's who would of been\n\nstill alive if they were belted in, or had their children in car seats. This\n\nwas a tragic death (name a TA fatality that isn't..) and well, as cold,\n\nheartless and uncaring that this may seem right now, these folks died because\n\nthey were either too lazy, had the \"It can't happen to me\" attitude or simply\n\ndidn't care.\n\nWhile nothing can change what had happened here, let this serve as a grim\n\nreminder and a warning to all: WEAR THE BELTS. WEAR THEM AT ALL TIMES. It may\n\njust SAVE YOUR LIFE....\n\nEach minute and hour we delay in getting this warning out places others at\n\nperil. No one can force someone else into doing this, but maybe, just maybe the\n\ndeaths of folks we know, know of or heard about within our group will wake some\n\nfolks up to the fact that what happened here could of been prevented by simply\n\nbuckling up the belt....\n\nI may seem to be a bit cold, cruel and heartless about this, but this was a\n\npreventable fatality and well, I have no sympathy for those who do this and end\n\nup paying for their folly with their lives. However I am not without compassion\n\nfor those who must now deal with the grief and loss, all due to the fact that\n\nsomone wasn't thinking, and ended up a fatality simply because they didn't use\n\na simple piece of safety equipment. I have seen this far too many times.\n\nDo yourself a favour, and all of us as well and wear the belts..They are there\n\nfor a reason...\n\nAtar\n\nDr JP Hrisoulas,\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n\nBladesmith, Metallographer, Researcher, Lecturer\n\nAuthor:\n\n\"The Complete Bladesmith\"\n\n\"The Master Bladesmith\"\n\n\"The Pattern Welded Blade\"\n\nLtC, NVDoM\n\nhttp://www.Atar.com\n\nI know this is a sensitive issue and in posting this I sincerely hope I\n\ndon't cause anyone more pain.\n\nEvery single time I get into that car, I think about what a powerful thing\n\nit truly is and the capacity it has for harm if not properly controlled.\n\nThen I think about the thousands of other people, driving similar\n\nmachines, I will be in contact with throughout the day, and I pray this\n\nisn't the day I happen to meet up with disaster because me or one of\n\nthose other drivers wasn't paying enough attention, or because the\n\nweather turned really bad, or because somone's wheel fell off and crashed\n\nthrough three lanes of traffic.\n\nI know many people whose lives have been changed forever by auto\n\naccidents. My best friend's parents were both killed when their van was\n\nstruck by a semi on the highway (the semi driver was asleep at the wheel).\n\nYou don't realize how profound an impact this has one someone's life until\n\nyou live with it, see the impact, and realize there are scars that will\n\nnever heal.\n\nDriving is an inherently risky business and my intent is not to moralize\n\nabout it but...\n\nPlease, everyone, take care when you drive to that next event. Take all\n\nthe precautions you can before you leave, get a good night's sleep, wear\n\nyour seatbelt, ensure your car is in good shape because we *need* you to\n\narrive safe and sound.\n\nMy extreme condolences go out to the friends and family of Osis and\n\nBernie.\n\nChris\n\nUnto the Wonderful Kingdom of Ealdormere, and Her Majesty Catlin does Don\n\nFrasier MacLeod send his most heart-felt greetings,\n\nI met Osis a few years ago while I was living in the Barony of the\n\nRhydderich Hael, (Buffalo, NY). I had travelled to the Barony of Rising Waters\n\nfor the 9th Annual Lady Mary's Memorial Tournament. That was the first year\n\nthey were offering a fencing tournament, so I decided to day trip to the event\n\nand have some fun.\n\nI remember the first time I saw Osis. The first thought that crossed my\n\nmind was \"God that man is BIG.\" Osis wasn't fighting in the tournament because\n\nhe had injured his shoulder at work, and could not swing a stick effectively.\n\nI watched him over the course of the day, and realized that his heart was truly\n\nlarger than the body containing it. Friendly, honorable, chivalrous, and above\n\nall kind.\n\nI was lucky enough to be victorious in that fencing tournament, and later\n\nafter court, Osis congragulated me on a job well done. To him I was a total\n\nstranger, but to me this was a Good Thing. I returned to Rising Waters the\n\nfollowing year to \"defend\" my title as champion, and Osis was again there,\n\nfighting this time. This was the first time I saw him fight, and I thought,\n\n\"God, don't ever let that man hit me.\"\n\nBefore the fighting started I wandered over to wish Osis good luck. He\n\nremembered me from the year before, having only met me the one time. Now I was\n\ntruly impressed. He wished me luck also, and we went to our respective\n\ntournaments. Well, it would seem that our wishes worked, for I again won the\n\nfencing tournament, and Osis won the Heavy tournament. During court, we\n\ncongragulated one another on jobs well done, and had a beer together after. I\n\nsaw Osis a couple of more times after that. Then I moved home (Maine).\n\nI am truly saddened to hear of his passing. If there is anything I can do\n\nfrom my distant land, I would do so. Though I did not know Osis for long or\n\nwell, I would call him friend.\n\nDon Frasier MacLeod\n\nOGR(East), OWS(AEthelmearc)\n\nDennis O'Connor <dm...@primenet.com> wrote in message\n\n> For me, two complete strangers out of the quarter-million\n\n> that died that day.\n\nThen try to be considerate of those who did know the deceased.

Now please us stop and reflect that the loss of anyone\n\nwithin the SCA family affects many, especially when they have had such a\n\nsignificant influence as Os had.\n\nMany of us Ealdormerians are now slowly coming to grips with what it\n\nmeans to lose you King.

Sitting at the pub with him after a\n\nfight practice and listening to him talk about how he felt that his\n\nresponsibility was to create an atmosphere that allowed people to enjoy\n\nthemselves. The sincerity that he showed at that time gave me a measure\n\nof who Osis was and a quiet respect that has held even when I disagreed\n\nwith him.\n\nRegretfully, over some minor \"political\" stuff I rashly posted a harsh\n\nnote about a decision made by Osis and Queen Caitlin. I was going to\n\napologize at \"the right time.\" I waited too long.\n\nFor the rest of you, please post your \"Os\" stories.

No need to mourn cause\n\nI didn't know you. No big loss to the world. But it would be a big\n\nloss to some people close to you. Most of us aren't slamming you\n\nbecause you started posting about seatbelts, just the way it was done.\n\nIt should have been continued as a new thread. I'm not trying to flame\n\nyou, just trying to get some peace. As a relative newcomer to the SCA,\n\nI didn't know Osis either but many of my friends in the Northern\n\nOutpost did, and they were grieving.\n\nAs for the royalty getting special favors thing, it's not so much a\n\nspecial favor as the simple and incontrovertible fact that royalty\n\nusually knows many more people than the average SCA'er. When you're\n\nroyalty. you almost always end up travelling between kindoms and hence\n\nbecome better known than most people. I'm from the Northern Outpost in\n\nthe East Kingdom but most of the group here knew Osis, even though he\n\nwasn't from here. Some of us aren't on the mailing lists so how would\n\nwe have known? Personal letters or e-mails from the aggrieved? I don't\n\nthink so. They have much more important things on their mind at the\n\ntime.\n\nAs I said, I'm not trying to flame you, just asking you to tone it\n\ndown a little. By your actions in continuing this flame war, you're\n\nshaming yourself and your group.
