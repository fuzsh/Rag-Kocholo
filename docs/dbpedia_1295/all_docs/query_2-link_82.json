        "text": "Leigh, a Lancashire town with a population barely reaching 45,000 and so small it does not have a train station to its name, has been threatening to write one of the most remarkable rugby league stories for a good few weeks. It has just taken another gargantuan leap towards that becoming a reality by advancing to the final of the Challenge Cup for the first time since their win over Leeds in 1971, their only other final coming in 1921.\n\nLast summer, Leigh Leopards were playing in the Championship and in the warm-up game to their local rivals, Wigan Warriors, on finals day last year at Tottenham. They won the 1895 Cup before the Warriors won the Challenge Cup final hours later. Leigh’s owner, Derek Beaumont, has frequently admitted how he dreams of a Leigh v Wigan cup final. If the Warriors hold up their end of the bargain with victory against Hull KR on Sunday, he will get his wish.\n\nIncredibly, despite being promoted last season, they sit second in Super League and their prospects of an astonishing treble remain alive after this nerve-shredding victory against the reigning Super League champions, St Helens.\n\nThrow in the fact that Beaumont rolled out an eye-catching rebrand under which the club were renamed the Leopards during the off-season, with a leopard-themed kit that produced much ridicule at the time, and this is a story that is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.\n\nHere there were adults in leopard costumes, leopard print bucket hats as far as the eye could see and at full-time celebrations the kind of which many Leigh supporters will have never experienced before.\n\n“I played in two cup finals but neither were at Wembley,” the Leigh coach, Adrian Lam, said. “The love affair with the cup, it’s all about Wembley. I’m getting emotional just thinking about it.\n\n“It feels like a dream. I hope that the town and the fans are proud of what they’ve seen from their team today. It’s just a complete dream and an incredible moment.”\n\nTrailing 6-0 at half-time, the Leopards then reproduced the form that has made them genuine Grand Final contenders. They were the better side and, when you consider the opposition have won the past four Super League titles, that is no mean feat for a team that were playing part-time opposition 12 months ago.\n\nSt Helens led at the interval courtesy of Joey Lussick’s try on what was the hooker’s final appearance. He will return to Australia in the coming days after agreeing a deal with Parramatta, and the former State of Origin player Moses Mbye will replace him. Crucially though, Tommy Makinson missed a penalty on the stroke of half‑time that would have made it 8-0, and his missed conversion in the final seconds proved decisive too.\n\nLeigh, roared on by what felt like the entire town on occasions, responded after half-time. It took them two minutes to level the scores after Lam’s son, Lachlan, provided a perfect pass for Oliver Holmes to cut through on the angle, with Ben Reynolds converting to make it 6-6.\n\nAs the game passed the hour mark, Lam struck again with a well-weighted kick and while winger Tom Briscoe missed it Zak Hardaker did not, grounding the ball inches from touch to put Leigh ahead. Reynolds then added a penalty with 15 minutes remaining to open up a six-point lead.\n\nThe pressure was on Saints to respond and they came desperately close when Jonny Lomax broke free, only to be hauled down by a superb last-ditch tackle from Hardaker, the kind of which epitomises the spirit that has taken the Leopards to the verge of history this season.\n\nSt Helens kept coming though and as the game entered the final minute Lomax wriggled free to touch down with their last real chance, but Makinson pushed the conversion wide.\n\n“Tommy is disappointed he didn’t kick the goal, but we walked in here as a group and we’ll walk out together,” the Saints head coach, Paul Wellens, said in a bullish defence of the England winger before admitting he was “devastated” with the outcome. “But I want to congratulate Leigh.”\n\nThat missed kick meant there was barely time to restart and, after surviving one last tackle the wild celebrations among the Leigh players staff and supporters underlined the scale of what had just been achieved. Wembley? More like WembLeigh, come 12 August."
