        "text": "Clan MacThomas Genealogy\n\nExtracts from Catholic Records Back\n\nMarriages\n\n*****\n\nThe parish records for Catholic marriages in Scotland have been brought together by the Scottish Catholic Archives project - although it should be stressed that for a number of reasons it has not been possible to record all the marriages. The indexes and images for the records that are available can now be viewed on the ScotlandsPeople website. As part of a promotional offer the Clan MacThomas genealogy team extracted a summary of relevant records from the indexes and these are listed below. Members wishing to view the the image of an actual document can do this via ScotlandsPeople. There will be a charge for doing this.\n\n******\n\nThe data includes records where either the husband or the wife has one of the main Clan sept names or a variation of it. There are no records where both the husband and wife have a sept name. The records are sorted alphabetically according to the surname and forename of the Clan member -with the husband records listed first for a particular surname. The husband or wife with the sept surname has been highlighted. Records are shown verbatim.\n\n*****\n\nThe records for the surnames Thomas and Thomson are listed on a separate page (link)."
