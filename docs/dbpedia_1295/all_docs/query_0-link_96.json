        "text": "November, 2008\n\nDear Cubbies,\n\nIssue Number 8 features:\n\nThe First Anniversary of the McCubbin DNA Project\n\nRonald ‘Rick’ McCubbin and his Amazing DNA Discovery\n\nThe Nicholas McCubbin Boys\n\nBargany House, Ayrshire and the McCubbin Family Connection\n\nWilhemina and the Master Mariner (and her son and six beautiful granddaughters)\n\nIsabella McCubbin’s son, the film star Wilfred Lawson\n\nQueries\n\nCUB BITS\n\nThe McCubbin DNA Project\n\nby Lorna McCubbin, Project Administrator\n\nThis is our first anniversary. We have 23 McCubbin members signed up!\n\nNovember 2007\n\nThe McCubbin surname project was started with the assistance of Susan Meates, Guild of One Name Studies DNA Co-ordinator and Don Chesnut, Co-administrator for the project.\n\nMales with the McCubbin surname were actively recruited by email. They were chosen from specific family tree charts in our database, in order to get base markers for each family group. Some of these men were offered the DNA test as a gift from the sponsors of the McCubbin Family History Association, in order to get the project started. Some members made a donation for other McCubbins to buy the kit.\n\nThen came the surprises for those of us who have been researching the McCubbin name for several years. We assumed that because McCubbin is a relatively rare name and seemingly has roots in a small area of the world, namely Southwest Scotland, that they would likely have the same DNA and be closely related. Not so!\n\nNovember 2008\n\n23 men have submitted DNA samples over the past year. Results have been received for 20 men, and 3 samples are awaiting analysis or are in transit.\n\nSix men with a haplotype of R1b1b2 were matched, 3 of whom had markers which indicated a relationship with King Niall of Ireland. *(see below). These men, presently living in Scotland, England, Canada and Australia are included in the following descendancy charts:\n\n– #05 John McCubbin (1745-1805) and Margaret Tait of Keir\n\n– #62 John McCubbin (married 1797) and Agnes Hodgeon of Maybole\n\n– #41 John McCubbin (1799-1889) and Elizabeth Beggs of Leswalt.\n\nWe do not have a paper trail before the 1750s for the above, therefore cannot link these charts, however through DNA we do know they have a common ancestor. Family folklore tells of a relationship to Alexander McCubbine, the Covenanter and martyr who was hung for attending a prayer meeting in 1685.\n\n*”A recent study conducted at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, found that a striking percentage of men in Ireland (and quite a few in Scotland) share the same Y chromosome, suggesting that the 5th-century warlord known as “Niall of the Nine Hostages” may be the ancestor of one in 12 Irishmen. Niall established a dynasty of powerful chieftains that dominated the island for six centuries.\n\nIn the study scientists found an area in northwest Ireland where they claim 21.5% carry Niall’s genetic fingerprint, says Brian McVoy, one of the team at Trinity. The same area of Ireland has previously been the subject of anthropological study and has shown a strikingly high percentage of men from Haplogroup R1b (98%) versus 90% in southeast Ireland. According to McVoy this area was the main powerbase of the Ui Neill kings, which literally translated means “descendants of Niall”. *from the FTDNA website\n\nFour men with a predicted haplotype of R1b1b2 were matched. A fifth man, not in the FTDNA project, found that he is an exact match with Ronald ‘Rick’ McCubbin. (See the following story). These five men, presently living in Kentucky, Maryland, Canada, Scotland and England, are included in the following descendancy charts:\n\n– #80, John the Colonist of America (1630-1686)\n\n– #61-43 John McCubbin and Janet Millar of Ayrshire (born 1692)\n\nFamily folklore and extensive research by others before us, show that this group goes back to the Lords of *Traddonuck and Knockdolian in Ayrshire. A variant that pops up in their DNA results is the name McBean, with whom they have a match. *Traddonuck has several spelling variations\n\nFive men with a haplotype of R1b1b2 were matched. These men presently living in the US, Scotland, and Australia as well as a Canadian, living in the Cayman Islands, are included in the following descendancy charts:\n\n– #A02, Alexander McCubbin (married 1736) and Jean McIlwraith of Ballantrae, Ayrshire\n\n– #44 John McCubbin (McKibbon) (married 1755) and Margaret Gibson of Stoneykirk, Wigtownshire\n\n– #45 Alexander McCubbin (c1789-1840) and Agnes Weir of Kirkmaiden and Stoneykirk.\n\nFamily folklore among some of them tells that they “came from Ireland way back”. Not only that, they are among the few in the Scottish records of McCubbins, who had their names written as McKibbon in the early parish registers of Wigtownshire. One other was Shaw McKibbon of Ireland whose son William McCubbin settled in Girvan. McKibbon is known as an Irish name and is rare in Scotland.\n\nTwo men with a haplotype of I1 are related. These men, presently living in England and Australia are included in the following descendancy chart:\n\n– #03 James McCubbin (married c 1780) and Isabella Lorimer of Penpont.\n\nAfter we have more DNA candidates we may have a better understanding of where this group links in with other McCubbin men. Two other men tested have no match with the McCubbin name, at this point.\n\nTests at the Lab – One male, a McCubbin, is a Jamaican of African descent. His family is anxiously waiting for his results which will be ready next month.\n\nWe are still looking for more DNA candidates. For more info contact Lorna. If you would like to join the project but cannot afford the price, there may be help available. Do not be embarrassed to apply. This is not charity. Your DNA sample is valuable to the McCubbin Society.\n\nSimilarly, if you would like to contribute to this cause, email for more information. You can read more about DNA in the previous CUB report, 2007.\n\nWomen who are interested in their family tree can help with our project by encouraging husbands, sons, grandfathers, uncles, cousins to take the test. It could be a chance for gift giving. Too, the cost has recently been reduced AND even more because we are members of a one-name study. Family Tree DNA has just announced their end-of-the-year savings. Contact Lorna to find out more about these special discounted rates.\n\nRonald ‘Rick’McCubbin and his Amazing DNA Discovery\n\nA McCubbin DNA Success Story\n\nBy: Ronald Rick McCubbin, Bardstown, Kentucky, USA\n\nWith modern technology and the advancement of DNA, those of us who are serious, yet amateur genealogists are finding more people paying the price to have their DNA tested in order to confirm lineage, find missing ancestors, or to simply locate every possible cousin that may exist. The latter is the reason that I decided to have my DNA compared to others in order to fill in any gaps in my McCubbin family tree, which I have diligently researched for many years.\n\nThe DNA story that is the center of attention is about my great grandmothers son, Robert E. McCubbin. Her other son, Richard Curtis McCubbin, was my grandfather.\n\nAs a young boy I was always interested in my family history. I knew everyone and how they were related, however, there was a picture of a man displayed in the front room of the house at 321 East Kentucky Street in Louisville. When I asked about this strange man whom I had never met but realized he was somebody important since he had an entire wall to himself, my great grandmother sat me down and told me that this was her son, my great uncle, Robert E. McCubbin. She told of him going to war in 1943 and died in 1944 after his famous unit, the 29th Infantry, hit Omaha Beach in Normandy, France.\n\nShe went on to tell me that my grandfather almost joined his brother Robert, but due to a slight disability was rejected and always felt the pain of losing a very close brother in a war that he could not be a part of, if for no other reason but to be with Robert. My grandfather told me that his biggest fear was that Robert, who was unmarried with no children, would be forgotten and his service to our nation unsung simply because he left no one to carry on his name. At that point, in 1978, I decided that no, Robert would be NOT be forgotten. When my great grandmother realized that I was sincere she gave me an old dusty box. It was full of Roberts items from the war; the flag that draped his coffin, letters from elected officials, his Purple Heart, all of the V-mail that she had received from him, and even his wallet that the Army returned after confirming his death.\n\nMany years have passed since I began my research and just last year I completed a page on Robert in my on-line Tree complete with pictures and information about his death. As I continued adding more McCubbin information that I had located I began to read about people having their DNA tested in order to scientifically confirm lineage. I read it with great interest not only because of the genealogical perspective, but when I started my law enforcement career, DNA was something of the future, and now, here we are using it for pleasure, not just to solve crimes. This past January I decided for my birthday I would give myself a present; order the DNA kit from Ancestry.com. What a gift it has been!!\n\nWhen my results were available I found I had been matched with 4 other men, none of which were McCubbins. DNA sites offer a contact email through their system and I emailed all four. On March 6th, 2008 I received a reply to my email from a man named Peter Vickery. Peter, who is in England, went on to write that he was not necessarily researching his Tree as most of us were, but that recently, at his fathers death, he was told that his father was not his biological father. He had submitted his DNA as a gamble to locate any information on who his biological father was. He said that his mother, who is well into her 80s, told him that his real father was an American soldier named Robert, in his 30s, was stationed in England and was deployed to Normandy. He was about 63, an airman. When she realized that she was pregnant, she attempted to contact him. She spoke with a commanding officer that advised her that Robert was injured and had been sent back to the States. Peter ended, tongue in cheek, jokingly stating that if I knew anyone in my family who fits this, to let him know. At this point, I nearly fell from my chair!\n\nI immediately e-mailed Peter back and said not only do I think I can help, I think I can solve this one! I told him about my great uncle who not only fit the description, but also with DNA scientifically linking that SOMEONE in my family was his father, I told him more, asked him for more, and we went back and forth that day on Robert. I asked him to email me pictures of himself and I sent him pictures of Robert. We continued, but cautiously, because there is always that question of is this real? Is it too good to be true? This man, in his 60s is searching for his biological father and on a gamble submits his DNA, and I, thousands of miles away in America, in Kentucky, had an uncle that fit every aspect of what he was told about his father; almost surreal. For several days we continued to compare pictures, descriptions, and information in order to rule out any doubt. The main tool, DNA is hard to argue; science doesnt lie. There were simply so many matches that we knew we had solved it; Robert E. McCubbin, a country boy from Hart County, Kentucky, who died in the famous Invasion of Normandy, was Peters father. We had one more confirmation up our sleeve; Peters mother, who was in a nursing home in England.\n\nWhen Peter took some of the many pictures I emailed him to his mother, he said, her face lit up and she confirmed this was his father. He was a lovely man she said. She went on to talk about Robert and what she remembered of him; he loved eating fish and chips, loved looking at the old buildings in England, and was a deep thinker. Lastly, Peter said that his mother asked him to leave the pictures of Robert for perhaps a trip down memory lane for her, but closure for Peter Vickery.\n\nNow that I have a cousin in England, my father Ron is excited that he has a 1st cousin as there are only 3 descendants alive from that immediate line. We have invited him to Kentucky where he will be treated like royalty, no English pun intended.\n\nUpdate: In the summer of 2008, Peter, who is married but has no children, arrived in Kentucky to meet an extra family he never knew existed. He visited the house on East Kentucky Street where his father had lived. Before the family was to visit the burial site of Robert Elvis McCubbin in Louisvilles Evergreen Cemetery, where Peter would lay a flag on his fathers grave, he told a Courier news reporter who was covering the story, Thats probably going to get to me. And it did!\n\nPete and his wife Jan have an appointment with the Embassy in London in November to what if any rights or privileges he may have since his father was American. He is doing so because Pete and Jan are planning to move from their native country and settle in Bardstown, KY..with his new family.\n\nThis story of success has inspired me to submit another DNA through Family Tree and submit the results to the McCubbin DNA Project and I encourage everyone to do the same. What a great feeling it is to not only confirm lineage, but who knows..you just might find a McCousin that you didnt know!! It is truly beyond words.\n\nThe Nicholas McCubbin Boys of America\n\nby Lorna McCubbin\n\nThe Nicholas Boys The evolution of the Nicholas name among the descendants of John the Colonist of Maryland\n\nNicholas as a boy’s first name was used generation after generation among the American McCubbins. Spelt Nicolas in Scotland, it was generally used as a girl’s name. The earliest appearance of the name in America was with Nicholas, born about 1708 in Anne Arundel County. He was the son of Zachariah MacCubbin and Susanna Nicholson. Susanna was the daughter of Nicholas Nicholson and Hester Larkin. This would point to the origin of the name, which has been a popular name for generations up to present day. Historical records in Maryland, Kentucky, North Carolina and Missouri, all show McCubbins with the Nicholas first name.\n\nCraig McCubbin of Baltimore recently contacted me. His uncle, grandfather, great grandfather and gg grandfather, all were called Nicholas. We’ve hit a brick wall at Nicholas, the Barber, born New York, 1831, who fought in the Civil War, then lived in Baltimore (according to the census of 1900). Of interest, is that Craig’s father recently had his DNA test done through our project and has an exact match with Rick McCubbin who has traced his family back to John the Colonist. So, DNA has proven for us that Craig and family are on the same tree, and at some point they both share an MRCA (most recent common ancestor).\n\nIf you have a Nicholas McCubbin (or variants) in your ancestry, and have a family Bible or birth, marriage, death certificates to help us with verification, we look forward to hearing from you. AND also helping you connect your Nicholas. Contact Rick\n\nOne more important aspect about the Nicholas name in the McCubbin DNA line. There will be descendants of Nicholas MacCubbin, born 1710, with the Carroll surname. Nicholas was the son of Zachariah MacCubbin, born 1679, a Justice of the Peace and High Sheriff in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Nicholas married Mary Clare Carroll, 1747, who was the daughter of Dr Charles Carroll. He amassed a huge amount of wealth and property. Mary’s sons were left large estates on the condition they change their surname to Carroll. Thus, descendants of this family are named Carroll not MacCubbin (or McCubbin).\n\nBargany House, Ayrshire and the McCubbin Family Connection (Chart #A02)\n\nby Penny McColm\n\nIn 1864 James Paterson wrote a history of the counties of Ayr formerly called Carrick and Wigton. Through the kind assistance of the Carnegie Library in Ayr I have been provided with an extract from this book in relation to the history of this ancient property.\n\nThe original old house of Bargany was situated close to the river Girvan, and it was considered a commodious house, but a new house was later built, further up the hill to where the house stands today, and was one of the first unfortified houses built in Scotland.\n\nOn the 26 May 1492 the name of Dougal McCuben of Trawdonnak occurs in a charter by Robert, Abbot of Crossarague. In that year Colin MacAlexander of Daltippen conveyed the lands of Tradonnag MucCubbing to Sir Thomas Kennedy of Bargany and Ardstincher. From being first as we have seen, Tennents (sic) or occupiers, the McCubbins subsequently became the proprietors of Tradunnock.\n\nIn 1511, Thomas McCubben held the property and a notional instrument narrates that on the 5th June 1548, Thomas Kennedy of Bargany gave sasine with his own hands to Thomas McCubbyn of the lands of Knockbrockloch, alias Tordenat, in the parish of Kirkoswald.\n\nSir Fergus MacCubbin of Tradunnock, Lord of Dunscoir, had a son John McCubbin, who was proprietor , in 1602 and it was probably his son Fergus McCubbin of Tradunnock who was subsequently styled of Knockdolian on the roll of Members of the Kirk of Colmonell, under date 1642.\n\nThere are documents held in the National Archives in Edinburgh relating to Bargany the McCubbins , the Kennedys and their families. A further connection to Bargany and the Hamilton-Dalyrmple family is through Alexander the baker, born 1827 is that as a young man he was employed at Cliveden the house situated on the Thames River in Buckinghamshire. Fred McCubbin recalls his parents being at Cliveden and Cookham when he visited Britain in 1907.\n\nBy coincidence one of Scotlands renowned painters the Reverend John Thomson (1778-1840) came from Dailly, his works are exhibited in the National Gallery of Scotland. The house was constructed with stone that was removed from a ruined castle on the banks of the Girvan River. There was an inscription in stone and it says that the house was built in 16H.B.81, the H. being for Hamilton & the B for Bargany, the builder was Lord John Bargany who died in 1693.\n\nThe house is situated 19 miles southeast of Ayr and is on the banks of the Girvan River it has had many alterations over the centuries and was known as the home of the Kennedy family until it eventually passed into the Hamilton family.\n\nSir Hew Dalrymple Hamilton of North Berwick and Bargany was elected M.P. for Haddington-shire in 1795. Sir Hew married Lady Jane daughter of Adam first Viscount of Duncan on the 19th May 1800, this is the Lady Jane referred to in the McCubbin family history.\n\nOn Lady Janes death in Paris, in March 1852 her obituary was full of praise for her long connected liberal, judicious, and unobtrusive charities (that) have long been doing a great deal of good to the youthful and poorer classes, and where her singular urbanity of temper and kindliness of manner endeared her to all ranks.”\n\nBargany is well known for its beautiful gardens, which were started in the late 18th century, there have been many well respected gardeners associated with there upkeep. An ornamental bridge was erected c.1756 known as the Dukes Bridge, to harmonise and complement the azalea beds.\n\nMy great great grandfather Alexander McCubbin born in 1794 has been variously named as a Factor of Lady Jane Hamilton, Baron Office, Land Steward, Gentleman, Farmer or a servant, depending on which document you are reading.\n\nIn the 1841 census the family of Alexander and his wife Anne Aitken were residing at Lovestone which was the factors house this house stands on the edge of the Bargany grounds, 2 of his children were born in Lovestone. This house still stands today.\n\nThere ends the connection between the McCubbins and Bargany House, I am unable to find any documents that could enlighten me as to the employment of any McCubbins prior to this generation.\n\nSome interesting anecdotes recorded by some of the servants employed at Bargany have been recorded about the daily life in the house which gives an insight into the running of large house in the eighteenth century.\n\nFrom John MacDonalds story published in Memoirs of an Eighteenth Century Footman. He states that in 1750 at the age of 9 he was hired by Bargany coachman John Bell, the very young John MacDonald was sent on horse back, dressed in postilions livery from Edinburgh to Bargany some considerable distance. He was taken to meet Lady Anne Hamilton on arrival there, to see if she approved of him, apparently she did approve of him and he commenced his employment.\n\nJohn left Bargany after six years of service, he left with some ill will from his former boss John Bell, the coachman, their relationship had been brutal and the animosity between the two was irrevocable. Remember that young John was by this time was aged about 15 years old.\n\nJohn became something of a ladies man and managed to get himself into all sorts of scrapes in the following years, which included a supposed relationship with, not only the Lady of the House where he was then employed, but also some of the maids, of his new employer the Earl of Craufurd, his reputation thus became severely tarnished.\n\nIn 1760 John was reemployed by John Hamilton of Bargany as a body servant a valet but the wife of John the Lady Ann Hamilton, became so alarmed at John MacDonalds philandering that she asked her god-daughter and several female members of the household to leave the house as she felt “there was something between them”. John was immediately dismissed. He ended up unemployed in London and lost his own wife as well!\n\nOther memoirs mentioned in Servants Of Ayrshire 1750-1914 were given by Mrs. Hume who was a cook at Bargany, She commenced work at the age of 15 as a scullery maid.\n\nShe continues Each person knew what to do. I wouldnt have dared to go up to Cook. You waited until you were spoken to. Cook was your mistress. She kept her place and you kept yours. She was nice to you in a way. Every morning the scullery maid took a big ewer of water up to the cooks bedroom no bathrooms (in those days). Sometimes she would say is there a cup of tea going?\n\nThe relationship of master and servant was just that the servants were powerless and they were governed by the will of their employers.\n\nMrs. Hume explained how she obtained her post at Bargany. You paid a yearly subscription (to an agency) (of ) 2/6d then 5/- (shillings) as your wage rose. When you wanted a job, you wrote and told them you were in need of a position. You told them where youd been previously employed and provided references if you wanted to improve your position. Mrs. Sharp the Cook /Housekeeper at Bargany spoke broad Scots to everybody. Fife was a retired butler. Ward also a butler, succeeded him. Somebody had to recommend you. Mrs. Sharp recommended me.\n\nAs for the house itself it has gone through many alterations, additions and transitions over the centuries. The18th century interiors are considered of great importance.\n\nIts much prized gardens have been added to and nurtured . Some years ago the Dalrymple-Hamilton family placed the property on the market, and in 1980 the family tried to have the house demolished but after much opposition the house was offered for rent. In 1985 an American investor offered £31,000 for the privilege of restoring Bargany.\n\nWe finally come to the gardens, which are particularly beautiful with a lake, many azaleas and wonderful trees. They are attributed to plans by Thomas White and George Robertson created in 1774. Many other gardeners were connected to the house and in the 1820 W.S Gilpin whose work is mainly to be seen now. The lake was created by joining several ponds together, and the surrounding parkland was crated at this time. There is a pineapple house situated in a walled garden created about 1818. There are colorful cherry trees, Snake Bark Maple, Tulip, Magnolia and many more exotic trees.\n\nSources: 1.

Penny McColm\n\nWilhemina and the Master Mariner – (and her son and six beautiful granddaughters)\n\nby Bill Smart, reviewed by Lorna McCubbin\n\nAlmost one hundred and fifty years ago, a young woman named Wilhemina McCubbin, left her home in Loveston, Ayrshire, Scotland, to travel to New Zealand. Both her parents had died, her father, Alexander, having been a ‘Land Officer’ at the Bargany estate. Some of her siblings had already left for Australia and New Zealand, where her brother John was the proprietor of the Otago Hotel in Dunedin. In New Zealand,Wilhemena met Master Mariner, Joseph Moodie.\n\nThey had a brief affair which resulted in the birth of a son, in 1866. Born Joseph Moodie McCubbin, in Hokitika, he was known throughout his life as William Joseph McCubbin. His mother, Wilhemina, apparently left him with her sister in Hokitika and became the Housekeeper at the Provincial Hotel in Dunedin. She died in Dunedin at the age of 43 from “Disease of the Heart”. William Joseph was now an orphan (his father, whom he likely never knew, had died when he was three years old). William, having been cared for by his mother’s family, was known as an intelligent and articulate boy.\n\nHe continued on with his schooling, finished it and started apprenticing as a Butcher in Hokitika He met and married Florence Mary Law (who had already been avidly courted via letter, by another man). These letters were also in ‘the find’ that Bill Smart found in his parents garage.\n\nAfter their marriage in 1891, they moved to Denniston where William was working for the Westcoast Coal company as a coal miner, until he took over as manager of the Cooperative Society Butchery.\n\n(Throughout the essay, Bill has given informative descriptions of the towns, Hokitika, Denniston and Westport, where Flo and William had lived). Flo and William went on to have six beautiful daughters – Mary, Florence, Annie, Jessie Doreen, Marion and Kathleen.\n\nEach had their own special qualities. Reading through the many letters that travelled among them, one can appreciate the love and care they all had for one another. Their letters tell of everyday life in New Zealand. One of the major events in the girls lives was when Jessie (known as Doreen) won the Miss Wellington beauty contest in 1926.\n\nSays Bill, “A contest like this had never been organised in NZ and from newspaper accounts of the day it is apparent that great enthusiasm was expressed over the whole of the country.” There were over 550 entries. Letters and telegrams flew from sister to sister and parents. Anne said in one letter, “Best Love, Anne. We are all sick with excitement.” Bill’s mother, Kathleen, the youngest of the six girls, was the athlete. “She was keen on playing sport and was a champion diver on the Westcoast. Cath was a keen swimmer as well. Hockey and Basket Ball were both games she enjoyed.”\n\nIt was a pleasure reading Bill’s compilation of his family’s letters as well as the descriptive dialogue he used to keep the story flowing.\n\nAND remember, please don’t throw out the family letters. You never know which of your children or grandchildren will take on the role of family historian, and jump with joy when they find a box of old letters and photos.\n\nIf any McCubbin is related to the #A02 tree (Alexander McCubbin & Jean McIlwraith, the Ballantrae McCubbins) and would like to contact Bill Smart, send an email via Penny.\n\nObituary of Martha McCubbin and mention of Isabella McCubbin’s son, the film star Wilfred Lawson\n\nfrom Lynne McCubbin in an email to Lorna\n\nI’ve just received an obituary for Martha McCubbin, daughter of William McC and Margaret Galloway, grandaughter of\n\nWilliam Mcc and Martha Hay. In this obit it states that she was the aunt of film star Wilfred Lawson (yeah I’d never heard of him either).\n\nHis mother was Isabella Mcc who moved to Yorkshire England where she was a housekeeper for John M D Worsnop in 1881. By 1891 she had become his wife and had Wilfred (you can see how the name Worsnop would never really have worked in the movies!). Anyway, a little bit of trivia for those directly connected to this line. Apparently he was pals with Richard Burton and starred with Michael Caine, John Wayne and various other big names.\n\nCheers, Lynne\n\nFrom Irvine Herald, Mar 27, 1942\n\nFilm Star’s Aunt\n\nDeath of Miss Martha McCubbin\n\n“Miss Martha M’Cubbin, who passed away, age of 81 years, will be remembered by generations of Irvineites as the dear old lady who kept a “tuck” shop in Montgomery Street for the long period of 40+ Years. She was beloved by the children for whom she always had a warm affection.\n\nBorn in Girvan she came to Irvine with her parents, the late Mr and Mrs William M’Cubbin, as a child, and was one of a family of four sons and four daughters. She is survived by two sisters and numerous nephews and nieces, one of her nephews being, Wilfred Lawson, the famous film star.”\n\nWilfred (1900 – 1966) played in movies such as War & Peace, The Naked Edge, Room at the Top and Tom Jones.\n\nThe above family is descended from Shaw McCubbin & Sarah Chapman, Chart #55\n\nCUB BITS\n\nfrom Lyn Smith of Australia\n\nLyn Smith of Australia wrote of Matthew McCubbin, a randy character, in her family tree.\n\n“Reading the Kirkmichael Parish registers a number of years ago. The Matthew McCubbin who was married to Margaret Howard, must have been a “bit of a lad”. Twice in the Kirk Session records it lists that Matthew had had illegitimate children with another local girl named Isabella Flood – in both cases the records state child’s name, “conceived in carnal lust” One daughter was christened on the same day as one of his legitimate children and the other a month before one of his earlier sons. Must have been an interesting family situation in a very small town!”\n\nThank you Lyn! I have been trying to link this Matthew who had children with Isabella Flood to his McCubbin ancestors. He’s been a ‘stray’ in my McCubbin database for years. Finally, I found the reason why. Goes to show that going to original old parish registers is the answer! Matthew himself was an illegitimate child of Rev Andrew McCubbin.\n\nThe above Rev Andrew McCubbin, (1765-1852) of Leswalt and son Matthew, (c1810-1866)of Kirkmichael and Maybole are included in Chart #46-56. The Reverend Andrew was a colorful character too. He had an unacknowledged son, whom he didn’t include in his will. He apparently spent time in Bermuda. Possibly Jamaica too – DNA may tell. And he married a 24 year old woman when he was in his late 60’s.\n\nNews from the Bard\n\nRob McCubbin (of Australia) is at it again! He’s working on “On Wings of Eagles”. Check with Rob where you can buy his books.\n\nOf his historical novels based on fictional stories of the McCubbin saga reviewers are saying, “-a narrative as sharp as a sword’s edge. A must read for those who love a ripping good yarn.” “Son of the Storm is a family saga with more than a hint of authenticity about – you’ll enjoy it.” “Rob McCubbin’s historical novel weaves a fascinating fiction of adventure and romance over the strands of his factual family history.”\n\nRob also has a contact who will make ‘shoulder patches’ of coats of arms with a McCubbin tartan background. They cost about $6.50 US and can be paid for by Pay Pal. Find out more from Bob Wright at Bob\n\nAbove is the crest (it is a different interpretation than the one with the arm and sword)\n\nFrom Sally Walker, wrote to Lorna in an email:\n\n“Re The Crest and Arms of Fergus McCubbin (Mcaben) of Knockdolian. I have just looked at the details from the office of the Lord Lyon recently available at http://www.scotlands people.gov.uk and have noticed something which may interest the McCubbin devotees.\n\nThe crest and a description of it is not very clear, but clarifies information I already hold. I previously understood that the motto was Nulli Proede – but that is incorrect, it is actually Nulli Preda. I have cast about for translations of this and the best I can come up with is “none prey” or “none predate” I was not sure about this but I spent a little time browsing the other symbols on the crest, a castle on a rock (presumably relating to Knockdolian) a helmet (common on such arms) and above that a swallow. Why a swallow? I then checked several other references, one of which is something called the Aberdeen Bestiary. Within the entry for “Swallow” is the following: It is not harassed by other birds and is never their prey. Birds of prey never fall upon it, in the same way that the contrite of heart are never the prey of devils.\n\nThat really seems to me to support my contention for the motto. I do hope you find that interesting.\n\nI have a further query, I note that the date of the entry of the arms is given as 1/7/1673, but I read somewhere that Fergus died fighting in the Pentland hills in 1666 at the age of about (loosely) 60. I guess then that this must be Fergus McCubbin 2 (I believe the Nephew of Fergus 1?)”\n\nMcCubbing People on FaceBook\n\nA note from Kathy McCubbing Hopkins\n\nSomething that has recently struck my interest is the McCubbing Facebook group: My brother joined and since then other members of my family and a few other Cubbies from across the globe. Email Kathy for an invitation if you’d like to check it out.\n\nQueries\n\nWe’re looking for DNA candidates for male descendants of James McCubbin & Isabella Lorimer, of Penpont Chart #03, Rev Andrew McCubbin of Leswalt, Chart #46-56, Shaw McCubbin & Sarah Chapman of Ireland & William, of Girvan, Chart #55 (this is Lynne McCubbin’s tree).\n\nAND the Tailors of Linslade (as we call them in our records). If you are a McCubbin and have ties to Leamington, Warwick, Leighton Buzzard, Linslade, Buckingham, we’d like to hear from you. We need a candidate to prove which tree you ‘belong’ to. We have two tentative conclusions – either Chart #A02 Alexander McCubbin & Jean McIlwraith, (one of their descendants is Frederick McCubbin, the artist of Australia). The second one is Chart #03 James McCubbin & Isabella Lorimer, whose descendants were skilled Masons.\n\nWe also need candidates from the ancestral homeland – Scotland. If you are a Scot whose family has lived in Scotland for centuries, or a Scot living abroad whose close family is from Scotland, you would be helping the project greatly if you would submit your DNA. This is not the DNA which is used for criminal investigations and your results are entirely anonymous at your discretion.\n\nThere are funds set aside for DNA candidates of the above. Contact Lorna\n\nOur New Co-ordinator for ‘The American McCubbins – descendants of John the Colonist’\n\nBy now, you’ve read about Rick (Ronald McCubbin) in the story near the beginning of this report, who has found a new cousin through DNA. I have communicated with Rick for the past few years and have found him to be a tenacious and meticulous researcher. He has traced his family back to John the Colonist and now, through DNA had found a match in Scotland to a 90 year old McCubbin who states that his family was related to the Lords Fergus and John McCubbin of Knockdolian. Rick has records and photos of his family and entered his chart with Ancestry.com. Our association has always needed a co-ordinator for the descendants of John the Colonist who arrived in America in the mid 1600’s. Rick has agreed to be the co-ordinator. If you know or think you are related to John the Colonist, please contact Rick. If you have records from a family Bible, or letters or photos, we hope you will share them with Rick, in order for him to gather together this large and diverse American family. And also help you with yours. Contact Rick\n\nForming a MCFHA committee\n\nAs our McCubbin Family Association (MCFHA) continues to grow, we’re finding the need to form a committee. Now that we have a sizable, well researched database for world McCubbins, except America, we can now continue on with other areas. Our new arrangement will be:\n\nChairman of McCubbin Family History Association – Kathy McCubbing Hopkins\n\nMember – Guild of One Name Studies – forwards queries – Kathy McCubbing Hopkins\n\nReseacher for early (pre 1700s) McCubbin name – Lorna McCubbin\n\nDNA Project Administrator – Lorna McCubbin\n\nCo-ordinators – Penny McColm, Lynne McCubbin, Kathy McCubbing Hopkins, Ronald ‘Rick’ McCubbin.\n\nThanks again to all who have added to our continuing research. We are especially thankful to those of you who contributed to the DNA project. It is providing a great insight into our past.\n\nContact us about any questions or queries about your McCubbin ancestors.\n\nAll the best for 2009!!"
