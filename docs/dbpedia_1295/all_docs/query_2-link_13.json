I am proud to have Duncan Robertson and Hugh Robertson, my great great grandfather, as having played a part in that area. Unfortunately, I nhave no information on who Duncan and Hugh's parents were and what part of Scotland that they came from. I do know that that the Robertson Clan came from land situated around Lake Lannoch, between Blair Athol and Straun. If anyone can help me with the Robertson name prior to them coming to America it would be most appreciated. I have a pretty good amount of information on the military and historical background of the Robertsons of Cascapedia Bay and would be happy to share. Again thanks for the pleasant reading your sight provided me with.\n\nDate: Mon Jun 21 09:31:54 2004\n\nName: Donald dasti\n\nE-mail: ddasti@whitbyinvestments.com\n\nComments: Great site, didn't know I had so many distant relatives.\n\nDate: Tue Jun 15 00:16:36 2004\n\nName: Setbud@aol.com\n\nE-mail: Setbud@aol.com\n\nComments: Setbud@aol.com\n\nDate: Sat Jun 5 21:16:42 2004\n\nName: Ronald Davison\n\nE-mail: annronald@btopopenworld.com\n\nComments: Interesting site.
