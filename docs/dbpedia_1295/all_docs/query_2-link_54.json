I’d like us to take into our summers the theme of Summer Sabbath Rest. I invite you to slow down, reflect, and rejuvenate in God’s presence during these warm and peaceful days. Here are some Bible passages, themes, and ideas to guide your Sabbath summer reflections this season.\n\nBible Passages for Reflection\n\nGenesis 2:2-3\n\nBy the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.\n\nReflection: Consider how God’s rest after creation sets a pattern for us. How can we make our Sabbath rest a holy time set apart for rejuvenation?\n\nExodus 20:8-11\n\nRemember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labour and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God.\n\nReflection: Reflect on the commandment to keep the Sabbath holy. How can we honour this commandment in our busy lives?\n\nMark 2:27\n\nThen he said to them, ‘The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.’\n\nReflection: Jesus teaches that the Sabbath is a gift for our benefit. How can we embrace this gift without turning it into a burden?\n\nMatthew 11:28-30\n\nCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.\n\nReflection: Meditate on Jesus’ invitation to find rest in Him. What burdens do you need to lay down to experience His rest?\n\nPsalm 23:1-3\n\nThe Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he refreshes my soul.\n\nReflection: Visualise the peaceful imagery of Psalm 23. How can you create spaces in your life that allow you to lie down in green pastures and be led beside quiet waters?\n\nThe Gift of Sabbath\n\nIn Genesis, God rested on the seventh day after creating the world, setting a divine example for us to follow. The Sabbath is not just a day but a mindset, a sacred time to disconnect from our busy lives and reconnect with God. This summer, let’s embrace this gift and find peace and restoration in Him.\n\nSummer Events and Opportunities\n\nMusic is one of the ways that I connect with God, and find a beautiful peace and rest. This month, we are holding a Musical Soirée on Saturday 13th July beginning at 7.00pm. Why not come along and hear the talents of our local musicians; from harp to guitar, it’ll be a wonderful evening!\n\nPrayer is an important part of Sabbath, and every Thursday evening at 7.30pm, we continue our weekly online service of Evening Prayers. Everyone is welcome to join us on Zoom, and the link is on our website.\n\nHolidays and Staycations: Whatever you have planned for the summer, set time aside to rest in the beauty of God’s creation, recharge your batteries – both physical and spiritual, and remember that God, who is love, is with you each day.\n\nBlessings,\n\nRevd Dawn Matthew\n\nConfirmation service and retirement of Bishop Kevin Pearson\n\nSunday, 23rd June was a momentous occasion for two reasons – firstly there were six members of Challoch and St. Margaret’s being confirmed; and secondly, it was Bishop Kevin’s last visit to us as he is retiring as our Bishop.\n\nWe were very fortunate indeed to have Bishop Kevin celebrate the confirmations, and this makes the third time he has taken a special service in the last couple of years – one was to attend our 150th anniversary celebration in November 2022, and the second was at the installation of our Priest-in-Charge, Dawn in February 2023.\n\nKeith Best, Dominique Pope, Rosie Manton, Lynne Wright, Sylvia Phillips, and Toby Wise had all decided to be confirmed\n\nKeith Best said: “For myself the whole confirmation process was insightful and educative. I found the ‘Confirmation For Adults’ book by Sharon Swain to be inspirational, as was Dawn’s facilitation and ongoing encouragement to further research. It was a truly memorable occasion with Bishop Kevin’s presence and his outstanding practical sermon.”\n\nFellowship Group Outings\n\nStephen Knowles joined a small but enthusiastic group of members at Logan House on 20th June to visit the gardens.\n\n“Almost immediately we became aware that the visit would not work out as planned…Despite having passed a sign saying “Gardens Open Today”, the reception area was deserted. It then became apparent that the inner grounds were closed (a padlocked gate) and so was the walled garden (another padlocked gate).\n\nAfter a brief discussion we decided to adjourn to the Café at the Mull of Galloway. There we enjoyed excellent refreshments and also had time for fellowship in very pleasant surroundings. After that, most of the group concluded the afternoon with a walk to the RSPB centre.\n\nSo, not the outing which we expected, but a very enjoyable few hours spent together none the less…”\n\nThe July outing was a visit to the Cream of Galloway for lunch and what else – but ice-cream! This was followed by a round of mini-golf. Thanks to Ann Yate for organising.\n\nMusical Soiree\n\nSaturday 13th July saw our second event of the year which showcased the amazing musical talent we have, both from church members and friends willing to come and perform for us.\n\nThe music ranged from classical to pop and the instruments included harp, guitar, piano, flute, violin and voice.\n\nOur musical minister was the compere for the evening as well as revealing her (previously hidden) talent on the flute. She was joined by Catherine Demetriadi (violin); Linda Green (piano); and Kirsty Anderson showing us her repertoire on the beautiful harp. Everyone sang along to Stuart and Angela Bain’s renditions of the Beatles’ favourites ‘Let it Be’ and ‘When I’m 64’. It was good to welcome acaella singers, the Wyrdy Women, over from the Glenkens. All in all, a very successful event made all the more enjoyable by copious supplies of refreshments and the floral displays supplied by volunteers.\n\nThe event was free and the church was packed to capacity raising an encouraging £155 in donations.\n\nThe next church event will be our autumn Flowerfest when we will be focussing on a harvest theme so do put the date in your diaries – Saturday, September 28th 10am-2pm with ploughman’s lunches being served, followed by our Harvest Festival Service and a harvest lunch on the Sunday.\n\nRemembering Rev. Michael J. Keeling, Bishop of Garlieston 1928-2004\n\nMichael Keeling, born in Warwickshire, was one of the more colourful people to have enriched our life at Challoch. After teacher training and teaching for seven years he went to theological college and was ordained. His first parish was in Australia, where he served until 1973. On returning to London he became involved first with the St. Mungo’s Community Trust and later with the St.George’s Community Trust and Patrick House, set up to shelter and feed the homeless. As the causes of homelessness became apparent, they dealt with drinking, drug and gambling addictions and mental health.\n\nIn the 1980s he became director of St Mungo’s just as HIV and AIDS arrived in London. At his funeral a co-worker described Michael’s inimitable management style. He had gone for a job interview, been shown into an apparently empty room and discovered Michael lying on the floor at the base of the back wall, from which recumbent position he conducted the interview. In response to the AIDS crisis Michael not only opened Patrick House to care for HIV sufferers with dementia, but also adapted his own house so that HIV patients could receive care from their own families in a non-medical setting.\n\nHe burst in on Dumfries and Galloway in 1990 when he retired to Garlieston and became our locum after the death of Father Campbell. Under Father Campbell things had been troubled, we had not been a happy church and had run out of money. We suddenly found this imposing man in the pulpit telling us what a miserable, unsupportive and unkind lot we had been. Having dressed us down Michael set about building us up again. He didn’t stay as our locum for long, but his creative and restless spirit got to work in Wigtownshire on all sorts of community projects. He remained our honorary assistant priest for the rest of his life. Michael was a founder member of the Challoch Festival Choir and participated in many choral events at church and around Wigtownshire.\n\nI remember being very upset by seeing his purple toes exposed in sandals whatever the weather. He suffered from sore, cold feet, a precursor of trouble to come, and couldn’t believe his weren’t suffering too, although he cheerfully claimed not to feel them. We ran regular Quiz Nights for fund raising and always had a Bible Knowledge round – at least it gave our teams a chance against other community groups. Teams were usually of four, but Michael was always his own team. He engaged in a duel with the question setters to get full marks in the Bible Knowledge round, which he never quite managed. He claimed we were being absurdly recondite and nobody could answer them all – to which we replied that the Wigtown Bookies, (aka the Sorrill Family) knew the answers, which they always did.\n\nMichael died in February 2004 just after celebrating his birthday with friends. His funeral was an event to remember, choreographed and organised by himself. He specified Sorbie church because of its size, the funeral rite to be used and all the music and readings. The finale was the Festival Choir singing “The bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a ling” from ‘Oh What a lovely War’ as his coffin was wheeled out, culminating in a great burst of applause. A remarkable man who pioneered many services still evolving, to serve those in need in the community and someone who was life enhancing and fun to know.\n\nRosemary Green\n\nIt’s not only Robert the Bruce who can learn from a spider…\n\nAs I sat in the bath, I noticed a tiny spider trying to climb the slippery side above the water. It climbed a couple of inches, then slipped back nearly as far. After watching it for a short while, I placed my finger just below the spider, so that when it fell, there was something to catch it. When it reached the top, it seemed unsure what to do or where to go ……insecure perhaps or afraid of its achievement. It then did a strange thing. It went to go into the bath, but I gently encouraged it up.\n\nIt occurred to me that our life as a Christian can be very similar. We take a few steps forward and because of difficulties, we slip back a bit. But as Christians, the Lord has promised that he will always be there to help and support us. Something we need to remember when the going gets tough, is to trust.\n\nMichael Clayton\n\nSweet Charity\n\nI have to admit I’m a self confessed addict – to charity shops! I like to think that it’s actually my contribution to Net Zero, but I became a fan many years ago when I worked in Wakefield. The local hospice had a charity shop just across from the Town Hall where I worked and some bright spark had decided to take it by the bootstraps and give it a makeover.\n\nSo the windows were dressed just like a ‘normal shop’ and the interior racks were laid out in co-ordinated colours – not just the random jumble style typical of many similar outlets. I must admit I did go in first with some trepidation. My mother was initially horrified, even though she and my father were both from very poor backgrounds. They had always worked hard and took pride in what they had achieved.\n\nBut I started buying a few items – and then I was hooked! A bit like Aldi’s middle aisle, you never know what you’re going to come across – whether it’s a baking tin, a dinner service, tools, a designer dress at affordable prices, the list is endless. A case in point is an immaculate Noritake dinner service I bought for £20 when buying just a plate costs the same,\n\nMany items now of course are new as the turnover of clothes in retail stores is so rapid, the charity shops get end of lines to clear out stock. But buying a T shirt or a pair of jeans for £5 or less just has to make sense doesn’t it? I do reciprocate and take my own unwanted items of course. I am my mother’s daughter and have always taken pride in my appearance but it does give me a sense of satisfaction to know that a whole outfit can cost as little as £20. I think since I first ventured into that hospice shop going back twenty years ago, a lot of people have followed suit.\n\nI should say that I don’t exclusively shop at charity shops – but there is always that temptation to have a look as you never know…..\n\nLesley\n\nThe Season of Creation Beckons……\n\nEach year in the church’s calendar we now have period called the Season of Creation and it runs from September 1st to 4th October – the feast day of St, Francis of Assisi. It is a time when we both stop and appreciate the glories and the gifts of creation but also a time for reflection upon the huge issues we face from climate change and humankind’s abuse and exploitation of creation. Inevitably it is a time for praise and lament, also for action and commitment.\n\nHere at Challoch we are going to focus on the material produced by the Diocesan Environmental Group, which each week gives us one of the Gospel parables of growth, the Mustard Seed, The Sower, The Fig Tree…. So in preaching, prayer and worship we will let God speak to us and lead our actions for change. It will be a time to think about practical things we can do as a church and as individuals to better care for God’s creation now and into the future, recognising that our actions do matter and can make a difference. I also feel another video coming on so I may well be having a word about a starring role.\n\nAll Saints is now a registered congregation with Eco-Congregations Scotland. This is a sign of our commitment to learning and growing as a church which practically demonstrates that we do indeed care about creation and the environment. It is most important that we all recognise the impact that climate change has on some of the poorest people in our world. Ultimately this is all about loving God and loving our neighbour. To help move us forward we are going to join the Eco-Congregation award scheme and work towards acquiring the Bronze Award and who knows, more can follow. This hopefully will help to keep us on track with real and practical actions, turning talk and aspiration into real change. Our own eco-group are now working on a plan of action and a timeline to achieve this, the good thing is we are not starting from scratch some of the work has already been done.\n\nSome news from the Diocesan Environmental Group. Saturday 5th October 10.00 and – 3.30 pm Eco-Pilgrimage St Mary’s Cathedral Glasgow, a day of worship, learning, networking and hopefully encouragement.\n\nDiocesan Synod video focus from the Environmental Group: https://www.glasgow.anglican.org/diocesan-environmental-group-shares-2024-focus/\n\nStuart Bain\n\nFood Train Knit-a-thon\n\nFood Train’s 30th Anniversary is next year, and a year-long knitting campaign has been organised to help generate funds. From July 2024 – June 2025, Food Train is encouraging beginners/established knitters, to take part on their own, together with another knitter, or with a group of crafty friends. You can knit a scarf, a hat or be more adventurous and knit some gloves – there are no limits on the number of items.\n\nThe aim is to raise over £30,000 of which every penny will directly contribute to supporting older people to eat well, age well and live well at home. Additionally, all knitted items will be gifted to our older members or individuals facing hardship within communities across Scotland.\n\nSign up to participate: HERE, or make a donation HERE Sponsoring someone? You can add their name in the comments box. There’s also a Facebook group: Food Train Knit-A-Thon | Facebook You can also donate wool, or share the event with your knitting community, group, school etc. If you need any marketing materials let Karen Barbour at Food Train know. For more information: https://thefoodtrain.co.uk/about/ or tel: 01671 401346.\n\nA different way to pray\n\nBefore coming to live in Scotland, I lived in North Wales. I was fortunate to live close by St. Beuno’s which is a Jesuit Spiritual Retreat Centre. It was popular with Anglican priests as well.\n\nI completed the nine month course of the Spiritual Exercises of St Ignatius. When the course started, I was given a prayer and encouraged to start using it:-\n\nLet your God love you\n\nBe silent.\n\nBe still.\n\nAlone.\n\nEmpty before your God.\n\nSay nothing.\n\nAsk nothing.\n\nBe silent. Be still.\n\nLet your God look upon you\n\nThat is all.\n\nHe knows.\n\nHe understands.\n\nHe loves you with an enormous love.\n\nHe only wants to look upon you with his love.\n\nQuiet.\n\nStill be.\n\nLet your God love you.\n\nI found this a very different way of praying, instead of starting to talk to God right away.\n\nJoan Clayton\n\nGiving to All Saints\n\nRecent Donations:\n\nSince April – Machars Churches Food Bank £45.45 and Christian Aid £150.20.\n\nAs is the case for each of us, All Saints Church’s running costs have escalated over the past year – our electricity bill alone has gone up by £300 + even with a fixed deal, and of course we haven’t really had a summer to speak of!\n\nYour one-off and regular donations count for a lot and help worshippers and visitors alike to continue using our wonderful church. Whether you put cash in the collection plate, use a donor envelope, or pay regularly via BACs or a standing order, you are making sure we can keep All Saints’ doors open for worship, prayer, and the many events we host each year.\n\nWhen you Gift Aid your donation, that’s an additional 25% to All Saints – and for larger gifts, the amount can even be good for your own pocketbook! We are very conscious of the fact that everyone’s circumstances are different, but if many of us could increase our regular giving, that would be an enormous help.\n\nAnother way to make a meaningful legacy gift is to include Challoch All Saints in your estate planning. Consider your own family first, and then the causes you have supported over the years, and do please consider your church.\n\nIf you are considering making or updating your will, then we would advise you to contact your solicitor or financial adviser to discuss further. Another option is to contact a charity of your choice who offer free will services, through one of their panel solicitors. Whichever way you choose, you can check on the authenticity of solicitors through the Law Society of Scotland’s website here: https://www.lawscot.org.uk/\n\nIf you wish to restrict your bequest in any way (for instance, paying for a project or by endowing your gift, or with a gift of property, art, jewellery, or other non-cash method), do please discuss this first with our treasurer, Mike Clayton. By not restricting your legacy gift, you are entrusting your Vestry, and All Saints’ vestries of the future, to make decisions about how best to address both the urgent and longer-term needs of the church fabric and our congregation.\n\nYou can bequeath a fixed amount or a percentage of your estate. It’s also possible to make All Saints a beneficiary of your life insurance or a trust – in fact, there are many different ways to plan your precious final gift. Your adviser or solicitor can discuss with you in consideration of your own circumstances.\n\nLet your solicitor know that the bequest is to be made to All Saints Episcopal Church with Saint Ninian’s Fellowship, Challoch, Newton Stewart DG8 6RB.\n\nOur charity registration number is SC003582. Your bequest may also reduce your inheritance tax liability – a nice win-win. Most important is that your bequest will be treated with the care it deserves.\n\nIf you do decide it’s time to put your affairs in order or to update your will, do please let Michael Clayton, our Treasurer, know. He would be only too happy to talk to you about how to go about this.\n\nThank you and God bless you and yours,\n\nDawn and Mike\n\nSCONE-TASTIC!\n\nI’ve recently been given this scone recipe and I was rather dubious since I’ve never been able to produce anything that rose high enough to qualify. However, not only does it score in the height stakes, but it is oh so simple and quick, not to mention economical on ingredients! So here it is and I urge you to give it a whirl. I’m quite addicted sadly for my waistline.\n\nIngredients\n\n400 g/14 oz S.R. Flour\n\n175/6 oz Lemonade\n\n175 6 oz Double Cream\n\nBeaten egg to glaze\n\nIf you wish you can add cheese, sultanas etc to the dough\n\nMethod\n\nHeat the oven to 200 degrees C/180 fan. Grease a baking tray.\n\nMix all the ingredients together to form a sticky dough. Form into a rough round shape but keep the thickness – handling as little as possible as this, I’m told, contributes to the success. Use a cutter to suit the size of scone you want and then reform the leftovers. I found this would make about 9 with a 3” cutter. Glaze with the beaten egg/milk and cook for 10 minutes. Voila!\n\nLesley"
