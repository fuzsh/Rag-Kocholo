        "text": "Eleven World Premieres plus $146,500 in cash and prizes to be awarded.\n\n‘Mary Queen of Scots’ and ‘Momentum Generation’ to bookend festival.\n\nCanadian Premieres include ‘On the Basis of Sex’, ‘Stockholm’, and ‘Untogether’. Western Canadian Premieres include ‘If Beale Street Could Talk’, ‘Roma’ and ‘At Eternity’s Gate’\n\nThe 18th annual Whistler Film Festival (WFF), November 28 to December 2, selected its opening night film and full program lineup from over 1,000 submissions. Festival goers can look forward to 85 fresh films including 50 features and 35 shorts representing 12 countries. Selections for this year’s festival include leading award season fare, quality Canadian content (69% of the lineup) and more female-directed films than ever before (46% of the lineup).\n\n‘Canada’s coolest film fest’ remains true to its mandate of discovering new talent, with the inclusion of 16 first time feature films, 21 feature films directed by women, and with 64% of its program premiering Canadian features, more than any other international Canadian film festival this year. Plus, WFF’s juries feature some of the industry’s top talent, who will present 14 film awards and $146,500 in cash and prizing ($31,500 cash and $115,000 in prizes).\n\nWFF is set to open this year with Josie Rourke’s Mary Queen Of Scots, starring two of last year’s Oscar nominated best actresses, Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie. Rourke’s breathtakingly beautiful directorial debut explores the turbulent life of the charismatic Mary Stuart (Ronan), and her struggle to reclaim her rightful throne as Queen of Scotland, then under the rule of the compelling Elizabeth I (Robbie).\n\nClosing the festival is the Canadian Premiere of groundbreaking surf documentary Momentum Generation. Directed by Academy Award-shortlisted and Emmy and Peabody Award-winning filmmakers Jeff and Michael Zimbalist, the documentary follows the biggest names in surfing, including Kelly Slater, Rob Machado, Shane Dorian,Kalani Robb and the late Todd Chesser. Executive produced by Sundance founder Robert Redford with stunning archival footage from the godfather of surf films Taylor Steele, Momentum Generation gives audiences an inside look at the lives of these teenagers as they rose to super stardom as the first competitive surfers.\n\nWFF is proud to screen six award season contenders including hosting the Canadian premieres of On the Basis of Sex, Mimi Leder’s topical biography of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg played by Felicity Jones, and Robert Budreau’s Stockholm, with Ethan Hawke and Noomi Rapace. The festival will also feature Western Canadian Premieres of At Eternity’s Gate, director Julian Schnabel’s take on the life on Vincent Van Gogh played by Willem Dafoe; If Beale Street Could Talk, the first film from director Barry Jenkins since winning the Academy Award for Best Picture with MOONLIGHT; Alfonso Cuarón’s masterful Roma, which — for the first time ever at WFF — will be shown in 4k projection and 7.2 sound; and Family First (Chien de garde) directed by Sophie Dupuis, Canada’s entry in this year’s Best Foreign Language Oscar category.\n\nOther highlights include the World Premiere of Borsos Jury member Bruce McDonald’s Claire’s Hat, an unprecedented filmic mea culpa about the making of the 2001 fiasco Picture Claire. This funny, insightful and brilliantly reconstructed exploration documents what went wrong during the shooting of McDonald’s biggest budget movie to date. Direct from its premiere at Telluride, Brigitte Berman’s Hugh Hefner’s After Dark: Speaking Out in America, features a treasure trove of archival footage with everyone from Lenny Bruce to Moms Mabley.\n\nDirector of Programming Paul Gratton stated: ”It is gratifying to note that the Whistler Film Festival continues to improve on the quality of its film offerings at the same time that it is growing its representation of female directed movies. It is not just at the first-time features end of the spectrum that female directors continue to shine at Whistler, many of our top titles are directed by women. The quality of our Canadian submissions are the best ever, with major directors such as Bruce McDonald, Brigitte Berman, Maxime Giroux, Gary Burns, Sébastien Pilote and Robert Budreau entrusting us with their latest films. The Borsos jury will have a particularly challenging time picking the winners this year.”\n\nProgramming strands include American Indies, Canadian Vanguard, Contenders, Doc Bloc, First Features, From Overseas, From The Vault, Mountain Culture, ShortWork, and World Premieres.\n\nThis year, WFF is proud to boast that four of its five films in its American Indies strand will grace Canadian screens for the first time in Whistler. Titles include Wendy McColm’s funny and bittersweet Birds Without Feathers; Adisa’s horrifying look at sex trafficking in Skin In The Game; Alex Harvey’s brilliant Walden: Life In The Woods with Oscar nominee Demián Bichir; and Emma Forrest’s moving Untogether, with Jamie Dornan (50 Shades Of Grey), Jemima Kirke, Lola Kirke, Ben Mendelsohn and Jennifer Grey. Finally, Sebastián Silva’s Tyrel features Michael Cera in a story about a lone black man on otherwise all-white weekend of drunken bro debauchery on a birthday trip to a cabin in the Catskills.\n\nIt’s not just Americans entrusting WFF with their Canadian premieres as WFF proudly presents the international premiere of WFF’s Canada-China co-production alumnus Lutao Wang’s first feature Karma, and the Canadian Premiere of the Norwegian disaster movie The Quake, featuring the same characters that survived THE WAVE, a 2015 hit that played at WFF.\n\nCinematic excellence remains at the heart of the Whistler Film Festival. To recognize the vitality of this art form, films are carefully programmed and slotted into seven juried sections. This year, WFF will present 14 film awards, with over $146,500 in cash and prizing ($31,500 cash and $115,000 in prizes) including:\n\nThe Borsos Award for Best Canadian Feature that includes a $15,000 cash prize presented by the Directors Guild of Canada, British Columbia and $15,000 Post Production Prize sponsored by Encore Vancouver, along with awards for Best Director also presented by the Directors Guild of Canada, British Columbia, Best Performance, Best Screenplay, and Best Cinematography presented by the International Cinematographers Guild, IATSE Local 669;\n\nWorld Documentary Award;\n\nMountain Culture Award presented by Whistler Blackcomb;\n\nInternational ShortWork Award;\n\nCanadian ShortWork Award ($1,000 cash award);\n\nBC Student ShortWork Award ($500 cash award);\n\nMPPIA Short Film Award ($15,000 cash award plus up to $100,000 in production services) presented by MPPIA and Creative BC;\n\nThe Alliance of Women Female Journalists (AWFJ) EDA Awards for Best Female-Directed Narrative Feature and Best Female-Directed Short Film; and\n\nAudience Award (to be announced on December 3).\n\nTo best honour the wealth of Canadian filmmaking talent, the 15th annual Borsos Competition for Best Canadian Feature returns with the second largest festival prize in the country in honour of the legacy of the man behind the title, Canadian filmmaker Philip Borsos, best known for his inspiring work on the Genie Award-winning films THE GREY FOX (‘82), and BETHUNE: THE MAKING OF A HERO (‘90). WFF opened up the Borsos Competition for Best Canadian Feature four years ago to all Canadian dramatic features making their Western Canadian Premiere at the festival.\n\nThis year, 18 Canadian films will compete for Canada’s second largest festival prize. Borsos titles feature seven World Premieres including Jon Silverberg’s haunting WOODLAND (shot in BC); Métis director Shane Belcourt’s mission to Mars comedy RED ROVER starring Cara Gee; Jesse Zigelstein’s restaurant owner drama for foodies NOSE TO TAIL, Carolyn Combs’ ode to multiculturalism in Vancouver BELLA CIAO!; Natty Zavitz’s moving forbidden romance drama ACQUAINTED; Maja Zdanowski’s ambitious multi-character drama IN GOD I TRUST; Zack Bernbaum’s hilariously deadpan road movie about two Toronto Jews on a trek into Poland THE DANCING DOGS OF DOMBROVA; and Rama Rau’s HONEY BEE, which features another unforgettable performance by Julia Sarah Stone (WFF 2017 Star to Watch Alumni) as an underage truckstop hooker. We are also honoured to present the World Premiere of Borsos Jury member Jennifer Dale’s latest starring role which she also co-wrote, Shelagh Carter’s INTO INVISIBLE LIGHT, about a widow’s attempt to rekindle lost artistic ambitions and a romantic flame, which will be shown out of competition.\n\nWestern Canadian premieres in the Borsos Competition include Deanne Foley’s poignant exploration of mental illness and maternal yearnings, AN AUDIENCE OF CHAIRS; Kristina Wagenbauer’s moving story of mother/daughter conflict SASHINKA; Geneviève Dulude-De Celles’ A COLONY (UNE COLONIE), a memorable small-town coming of age story; Roz Owen’s study of a disenfranchised First Nations woman TROUBLE IN THE GARDEN featuring Cara Gee; Renée Beaulieu’s shockingly honest THE NATURALLY WANTON PLEASURE OF SKIN (LES SALOPES); Darlene Naponse’s FALLS AROUND HER featuring a career-best performance by Tantoo Cardinal; Lenin M. Sivam’s ROOBHA, a moving and empathetic look at transgender romance within the Canadian Tamil community; Sébastien Pilote’s award-winning coming of age story THE FIREFLIES ARE GONE; Sophie Dupuis’ first feature FAMILY FIRST (CHIEN DE GARDE), Canada’s entry in this year’s Foreign language Oscar category; and the Canadian Premiere of Robert Budreau’s STOCKHOLM with Ethan Hawke and Noomi Rapace.\n\nIn addition to the Canadian Premiere of the definitive surfing documentary MOMENTUM GENERATION which will close the festival, this year’s Mountain Culture films include premieres of Whistler-based directors Brian Hockenstein and Tamo Campos’ THE RADICALS which follows a group of snowboarders and surfers who drift from the mountains and oceans into the world of activism; Patagonia’s stunning winter filmTREELINE which explores the diverse forests of British Columbia, Nevada, and Japan, directed by Vancouver-based Jordan Manley; and winner of the Best Documentary award at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival, FREE SOLO, directed by E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, a stunning, intimate and unflinching portrait of the free soloist climber Alex Honnold’s preparations to achieve his lifelong dream: climbing the face of the world’s most famous rock — the 3,000ft El Capitan in Yosemite National Park — without a rope.\n\nThis year’s Doc Bloc competition features a refreshingly diverse line-up. Two BC-based productions will grace our screens, including NEVER BE DONE: THE RICHARD GLEN LETT STORY directed by Roy Tighe about a self-sabotaging Vancouver based stand-up comic, and the World Premiere of FUCK YOU ALL: THE UWE BOLL STORY directed by Sean Patrick Shaul. Canadian premieres include Brian Bellinkoff’s PSYCHONAUTICS: A COMIC’S EXPLORATION OF PSYCHEDELICS with comedian Shane Mauss, and Brigitte Berman’s HUGH HEFNER’S AFTER DARK: SPEAKING OUT IN AMERICA. In addition, WFF will screen the World Premiere of Jaren Hayman’s eye-opening exploration of Canada’s largest black community in THIS IS NORTH PRESTON. Western Canadian premieres include THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING, Tom Donahue’s timely reminder of gender inequality in the film and television industries being shown as part of WFF’s Women on Top Series, and our British Columbia premiere selection includes Laura Marie Wayne’s LOVE, SCOTT, about the lasting impact of a horrific incident of homophobic violence, produced by the National Film Board of Canada.\n\nOther films of note in this year’s lineup include the family-friendly first feature from the Northwest Territories’ Jennifer Walden, ELIJAH AND THE ROCK CREATURE; musical Christmas zombie movie ANNA AND THE APOCALYPSE that simply must be seen to be believed; Gillian McKercher’s realistic look at working in the Alberta oil sands CIRCLE OF STEEL; Collin Friesen’s hilarious comedy about burying a deceased father’s ashes featuring a stand-out performance from Bruce Greenwood, SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS; and Eva Husson’s rousing film detailing a Kurdish all-female battalion, GIRLS OF THE SUN. Borsos award winner Maxime Giroux (FELIX AND MEIRA 2014) returns with his newest THE GREAT DARKENED DAYS, and Gary Burns honours us with his Mountain Culture entry MAN RUNNING, about a doctor running a marathon in the Rockies.\n\nWFF’s Borsos Competition for Best Canadian Feature jury is made up of a diverse group of Canadian storytellers all of whom have had films at our festival and two of which are previous Borsos Competition for Best Canadian Feature winners. This year’s jury includes Canadian film and television director, writer and producer Bruce McDonald (THE HUSBAND WFF 2013) known for his award-winning cult films ROADKILL and HARD CORE LOGO, and Canadian film director and writer, who won the 2016 Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television’s Canadian Screen Award for Best First Feature, Jamie M.

(November 1, 2018): The 18th annual Whistler Film Festival (WFF), taking place from November 28 to December 2, announced today its opening night film and full program lineup. Selected from over 1,000 submissions, festival goers can look forward to 85 fresh films including 50 features and 35 shorts representing 12 countries. Selections for this year’s festival include leading award season fare, quality Canadian content (69% of the lineup) and more female-directed films than ever before (46% of the lineup). ‘Canada’s coolest film fest’ remains true to its mandate of discovering new talent, with the inclusion of 16 first time feature films, 21 feature films directed by women, and with 64% of its program premiering Canadian features, more than any other international Canadian film festival this year. Plus, WFF’s juries feature some of the industry’s top talent, who will present 14 film awards and $146,500 in cash and prizing ($31,500 cash and $115,000 in prizes).\n\nWFF is set to open this year with Josie Rourke’s MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS, starring two of last year’s Oscar nominated best actresses, Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie. Rourke’s breathtakingly beautiful directorial debut explores the turbulent life of the charismatic Mary Stuart (Ronan), and her struggle to reclaim her rightful throne as Queen of Scotland, then under the rule of the compelling Elizabeth I (Robbie).\n\nClosing the festival is the Canadian Premiere of groundbreaking surf documentary MOMENTUM GENERATION. Directed by Academy Award-shortlisted and Emmy and Peabody Award-winning filmmakers Jeff and Michael Zimbalist, the documentary follows the biggest names in surfing, including Kelly Slater, Rob Machado, Shane Dorian,Kalani Robb and the late Todd Chesser. Executive produced by Sundance founderRobert Redford with stunning archival footage from the godfather of surf films Taylor Steele, MOMENTUM GENERATION gives audiences an inside look at the lives of these teenagers as they rose to super stardom as the first competitive surfers.\n\nWFF is proud to screen six award season contenders including hosting the Canadian premieres of ON THE BASIS OF SEX, Mimi Leder’s topical biography of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg played by Felicity Jones, and Robert Budreau’s STOCKHOLM with Ethan Hawke and Noomi Rapace. The festival will also feature Western Canadian Premieres of AT ETERNITY’S GATE, director Julian Schnabel’s take on the life on Vincent Van Gogh played by Willem Dafoe; IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK, the first film from director Barry Jenkins since winning the Academy Award for Best Picture with MOONLIGHT; Alfonso Cuarón’s masterful ROMA, which — for the first time ever at WFF — will be shown in 4k projection and 7.2 sound; and FAMILY FIRST(CHIEN DE GARDE) directed by Sophie Dupuis, Canada’s entry in this year’s Best Foreign Language Oscar category.\n\nOther highlights include the World Premiere of Borsos Jury member Bruce McDonald’s CLAIRE’S HAT, an unprecedented filmic mea culpa about the making of the 2001 fiasco PICTURE CLAIRE. This funny, insightful and brilliantly reconstructed exploration documents what went wrong during the shooting of McDonald’s biggest budget movie to date. Direct from its premiere at Telluride, Brigitte Berman’s HUGH HEFNER’S AFTER DARK: SPEAKING OUT IN AMERICA, features a treasure trove of archival footage with everyone from Lenny Bruce to Moms Mabley.\n\nDirector of Programming Paul Gratton stated: ”It is gratifying to note that the Whistler Film Festival continues to improve on the quality of its film offerings at the same time that it is growing its representation of female directed movies. It is not just at the first-time features end of the spectrum that female directors continue to shine at Whistler, many of our top titles are directed by women. The quality of our Canadian submissions are the best ever, with major directors such as Bruce McDonald, Brigitte Berman, Maxime Giroux, Gary Burns, Sébastien Pilote and Robert Budreau entrusting us with their latest films. The Borsos jury will have a particularly challenging time picking the winners this year.”\n\nProgramming strands include American Indies, Canadian Vanguard, Contenders, Doc Bloc, First Features, From Overseas, From The Vault, Mountain Culture, ShortWork, and World Premieres.\n\nThis year, WFF is proud to boast that four of its five films in its American Indies strand will grace Canadian screens for the first time in Whistler. Titles include Wendy McColm’sfunny and bittersweet BIRDS WITHOUT FEATHERS; Adisa’s horrifying look at sex trafficking in SKIN IN THE GAME; Alex Harvey’s brilliant WALDEN: LIFE IN THE WOODS with Oscar nominee Demián Bichir; and Emma Forrest’s moving UNTOGETHER, with Jamie Dornan (50 SHADES OF GREY), Jemima Kirke, Lola Kirke, Ben Mendelsohn and Jennifer Grey. Finally, Sebastián Silva’s TYREL features Michael Cera in a story about a lone black man on otherwise all-white weekend of drunken bro debauchery on a birthday trip to a cabin in the Catskills.\n\nIt’s not just Americans entrusting WFF with their Canadian premieres as WFF proudly presents the international premiere of WFF’s Canada-China co-production alumnus Lutao Wang’s first feature KARMA, and the Canadian Premiere of the Norwegian disaster movie THE QUAKE, featuring the same characters that survived THE WAVE, a 2015 hit that played at WFF.\n\nCinematic excellence remains at the heart of the Whistler Film Festival. To recognize the vitality of this art form, films are carefully programmed and slotted into seven juried sections. This year, WFF will present 14 film awards, with over $146,500 in cash and prizing ($31,500 cash and $115,000 in prizes) including:\n\nThe Borsos Award for Best Canadian Feature that includes a $15,000 cash prize presented by the Directors Guild of Canada, British Columbia and $15,000 Post Production Prize sponsored by Encore Vancouver, along with awards for Best Director also presented by the Directors Guild of Canada, British Columbia, Best Performance, Best Screenplay, and Best Cinematography presented by the International Cinematographers Guild, IATSE Local 669;\n\nWorld Documentary Award;\n\nMountain Culture Award presented by Whistler Blackcomb;\n\nInternational ShortWork Award;\n\nCanadian ShortWork Award ($1,000 cash award);\n\nBC Student ShortWork Award ($500 cash award);\n\nMPPIA Short Film Award ($15,000 cash award plus up to $100,000 in production services) presented by MPPIA and Creative BC;\n\nThe Alliance of Women Female Journalists (AWFJ) EDA Awards for Best Female-Directed Narrative Feature and Best Female-Directed Short Film; and\n\nAudience Award (to be announced on December 3).\n\nTo best honour the wealth of Canadian filmmaking talent, the 15th annual Borsos Competition for Best Canadian Feature returns with the second largest festival prize in the country in honour of the legacy of the man behind the title, Canadian filmmaker Philip Borsos, best known for his inspiring work on the Genie Award-winning films THE GREY FOX (‘82), and BETHUNE: THE MAKING OF A HERO (‘90). WFF opened up the Borsos Competition for Best Canadian Feature four years ago to all Canadian dramatic features making their Western Canadian Premiere at the festival.\n\nThis year, 18 Canadian films will compete for Canada’s second largest festival prize. Borsos titles feature seven World Premieres including Jon Silverberg’s haunting WOODLAND (shot in BC); Métis director Shane Belcourt’s mission to Mars comedy RED ROVER starring Cara Gee; Jesse Zigelstein’s restaurant owner drama for foodies NOSE TO TAIL, Carolyn Combs’ ode to multiculturalism in Vancouver BELLA CIAO!; Natty Zavitz’s moving forbidden romance drama ACQUAINTED; Maja Zdanowski’s ambitious multi-character drama IN GOD I TRUST; Zack Bernbaum’s hilariously deadpan road movie about two Toronto Jews on a trek into Poland THE DANCING DOGS OF DOMBROVA; and Rama Rau’s HONEY BEE, which features another unforgettable performance by Julia Sarah Stone (WFF 2017 Star to Watch Alumni) as an underage truckstop hooker. We are also honoured to present the World Premiere of Borsos Jury member Jennifer Dale’s latest starring role which she also co-wrote, Shelagh Carter’s INTO INVISIBLE LIGHT, about a widow’s attempt to rekindle lost artistic ambitions and a romantic flame, which will be shown out of competition.\n\nWestern Canadian premieres in the Borsos Competition include Deanne Foley’s poignant exploration of mental illness and maternal yearnings, AN AUDIENCE OF CHAIRS; Kristina Wagenbauer’s moving story of mother/daughter conflict SASHINKA; Geneviève Dulude-De Celles’ A COLONY (UNE COLONIE), a memorable small-town coming of age story; Roz Owen’s study of a disenfranchised First Nations woman TROUBLE IN THE GARDEN featuring Cara Gee; Renée Beaulieu’s shockingly honest THE NATURALLY WANTON PLEASURE OF SKIN (LES SALOPES); Darlene Naponse’s FALLS AROUND HER featuring a career-best performance by Tantoo Cardinal; Lenin M.

Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, a stunning, intimate and unflinching portrait of the free soloist climber Alex Honnold’s preparations to achieve his lifelong dream: climbing the face of the world’s most famous rock — the 3,000ft El Capitan in Yosemite National Park — without a rope.\n\nThis year’s Doc Bloc competition features a refreshingly diverse line-up. Two BC-based productions will grace our screens, including NEVER BE DONE: THE RICHARD GLEN LETT STORY directed by Roy Tighe about a self-sabotaging Vancouver based stand-up comic, and the World Premiere of FUCK YOU ALL: THE UWE BOLL STORY directed by Sean Patrick Shaul. Canadian premieres include Brian Bellinkoff’s PSYCHONAUTICS: A COMIC’S EXPLORATION OF PSYCHEDELICS with comedian Shane Mauss, and Brigitte Berman’s HUGH HEFNER’S AFTER DARK: SPEAKING OUT IN AMERICA. In addition, WFF will screen the World Premiere of Jaren Hayman’s eye-opening exploration of Canada’s largest black community in THIS IS NORTH PRESTON. Western Canadian premieres include THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING, Tom Donahue’s timely reminder of gender inequality in the film and television industries being shown as part of WFF’s Women on Top Series, and our British Columbia premiere selection includes Laura Marie Wayne’s LOVE, SCOTT, about the lasting impact of a horrific incident of homophobic violence, produced by the National Film Board of Canada.\n\nOther films of note in this year’s lineup include the family-friendly first feature from the Northwest Territories’ Jennifer Walden, ELIJAH AND THE ROCK CREATURE; musical Christmas zombie movie ANNA AND THE APOCALYPSE that simply must be seen to be believed; Gillian McKercher’s realistic look at working in the Alberta oil sands CIRCLE OF STEEL; Collin Friesen’s hilarious comedy about burying a deceased father’s ashes featuring a stand-out performance from Bruce Greenwood, SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS; and Eva Husson’s rousing film detailing a Kurdish all-female battalion, GIRLS OF THE SUN. Borsos award winner Maxime Giroux (FELIX AND MEIRA 2014) returns with his newest THE GREAT DARKENED DAYS, and Gary Burns honours us with his Mountain Culture entry MAN RUNNING, about a doctor running a marathon in the Rockies.\n\nWFF’s Borsos Competition for Best Canadian Feature jury is made up of a diverse group of Canadian storytellers all of whom have had films at our festival and two of which are previous Borsos Competition for Best Canadian Feature winners.
