        "text": "\"McColm\" is one of the main Sept Names of Clan MacThomas.\n\n*****\n\nThe name McColm, as a result of a very early migration, has been in Galloway in south-west Scotland for over 500 years (counties of Wigtownshire and Kirkcudbrightshire). Although this may seem a little unlikely, there are many cases of Highland families to be found in Galloway and as McColm is the phonetic form of the Gaelic MacThom, that is the son of Tom, which was pronounced “McHom”, the tradition exists that they are a major sept of the MacThomas Clan.\n\n*****\n\nThe migration map on this website shows how emigration from Badenoch was possible by sea as travelling over land would have been difficult and more dangerous. It is likely that at the time Tomaidh Mor left Badenoch in the late 15th century to settle in Glenshee, some members of the Clan travelled south by sea to settle in Galloway. Then later some Mcolm's left Galloway to settle in Ireland, where the name became McComb.\n\n*****\n\nBy the mid 17th century the name McColm had become established in the south west of Scotland and that remains the position today.\n\n*****\n\nPlease click here to visit our Home Page.\n\n*****\n\nThere is also more about all the Clan's septs in the book\n\n\"The History of the Clan MacThomas\" compiled by Andrew MacThomas of Finegand.\n\nMacThomas\n\nSept Names\n\n***\n\nCombe\n\nCombie\n\nMacOmie\n\nMacOmish\n\nMcColm\n\nMcComas\n\nMcComb\n\nMcCombe\n\nMcCombie\n\nMcComie\n\nMcComish\n\nTam\n\nThom\n\nThomas\n\nThoms\n\nThomson"
