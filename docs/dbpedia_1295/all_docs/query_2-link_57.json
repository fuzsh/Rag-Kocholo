My work begins with the body and seeks to nourish embodied wonder with absurd potentials. I aspire to be the clown, the fool, the bumbler who speaks in riddles at the feet of authority. I work to facilitate experiences for people through performances, recordings, videos, and text based work that refract our complicated contaminated world. May we find wonder and humor in the patterns that arise.\n\nThe heart of my research is the energetic exchange between audience and performer. Yet, in a global pandemic, how do we signify performer? The resonance of nervous systems drives me to create events where sensation, thinking, and empathy intertwine to re-shape people’s perspectives. In the face of a climate emergency and the great reckoning with global capitalism’s desire for complete control of life, we are offered little room to make meaningful choices. And yet we go on. Let us fill our bodies with visions of adaptation and resilience that persevere as we are marked.\" peterredgraveperforms.com/\n\n[back to the top]\n\nNate Scheible is a DC-based drummer who has performed and recorded in a variety of bands and ensembles spanning multiple genres over the past 25 years.

As performer and curator, Bushmeat Sound has been an integral part of a visionary music scene straddling the Baltimore-Washington corridor. His audio work employs musical sound to anchor, frame, and accelerate our subjective experience of history. In 2014 he authored the Execution of Sun Ra, a critical response to the cosmological prognostications of the late jazz iconoclast. Dr. Stanley has spent three decades exploring the ramifications of Alter Destiny, Sun Ra's unique construct for a just and sustainable AfroFuture. He has written and lectured extensively on emergent musical cultures and is co-author of George Clinton and P-Funk : An Oral History (1998, Avon paperback). He hosts \"Bushmeat's Jam Session,\" a weekly collage of radical music heard on WPFW-FM radio. His doctoral work examined Butch Morris' art of Conduction as an extended meta-instrument offering unique opportunities for musical pedagogy and ensemble consciousness. He is also featured in “Stranger”, a documentary film about seminal P-Funk and Talking Heads keyboardist Bernie Worrell.\n\nStanley’s Black Art is a loudly joyful noise, illuminated by Black light, the thundering gasp of serendipity in the caverns of bohemia as audio intentionality releasing frothy bubbles of anti-sovereignty, expanding microtemporalities erected as positive ghettoes of solar real estate, Blackadelic afterFutures outside of americanExceptionalism, yielding at least one tripped-out-impossibility of a timeline where no one ever dreamed america and the maroons never came down out of the hills and the Jankanu is still being danced on bloody feet that have never been enslaved and no tin-star soldier ever nullified Strange Fruit.\n\nIn 2003, Stanley was drafted by broadcast legend Bobby Hill to help design and launch an undergraduate course at George Mason University exploring Hip Hop as a complete cultural system. This highly popular course quickly turned into an assistant professorship which Stanley held until 2017 when his position was converted to adjunct status. Stanley/Bushmeat is an Independent Public Intellectual/Sound Artist working in the wilds of early 21st century North America because Black Art, Black Light, Black Sound, Black Love, and Black Lives Matter. eatbushmeat.bandcamp.com/\n\n[back to the top]\n\nLuke Stewart is a DC/NYC-based musician and organizer of important musical presentations, and has a strong presence in the national and international Improvised Music community.

His music explores the instability of listening and the disorientation of memory and affect while remaining grounded in history and symbol, song and story. His varied musical interests have led to performance situations as diverse as Richmond VA's Cat Mansion, the Kremlin Armoury, and the Cathedral of Nantes.\n\nHis most recent album River Without Banks was released on Unseen Worlds in 2019. It's title is taken from a chapter in Genrikh Orlov's Tree of Music, in which he describes the experience of listening to the chant It is to be immersed with, not operated upon, for being, not for doing... It is not expected to lead back to where it started, but instead it leads forward, to an unknown yet anticipated point in the future… leosvirsky.com/\n\n[back to the top]\n\nBorn and raised in Richmond VA, Khalid Thompson discovered a passion for poetry during creative writing classes in high school. Post-graduation, he sought to challenge his solitary nature via performance outlets such as acting and acoustic guitar. However, there persisted a deep desire within him to find an artistic path more suited to his inherent personality. In the spring of 2006 he decided to move to Washington, DC to gain inspiration from a culturally diverse, international city.After a serendipitous meeting with a charismatic visual artist from the Ivory Coast, Khalid began to reinvestigate a childhood love of drawing. The steady encouragement of this new friend coupled with a renewed sense of self led Khalid to explore his own abstract style of art. The creative freedom and process of improvisational painting became a perfect fit. Since 2008 he has completely devoted himself to painting and drawing.\n\nKhalid Thompson’s art is the spontaneous application of color and mixed media designed to emphasize free expression. Using intuition, he manifests a broad spectrum of abstraction that suggests relationships to jazz, nature, the African Diaspora and African culture. www.khalidthompson.com/\n\n[back to the top]\n\nNoelle Tolbert has used dance, choreography, performance art, teaching, and storytelling to heal and connect people in order to challenge how we engage with and define art.

Acquiring a monophonic synthesizer, a record player that could go down to 16 RPM, and a four-track tape recorder, they began weaving their own music into form. Digging the clarinet out of the closet and receiving the gift of a C-Melody sax provided the tools to more fully express her voice. After making certain sonic realizations, she met some likeminded individuals in the Washington DC area, proceeding to record, tour, and release a plethora of long players with the collective Twilight Memories of the Three Suns. Shuffling around the country for some years and tasting the experiences different environments provided, they collaborated with folks young and old, noise and jazz veterans alike. Settling in Baltimore in 2013 she found a living making preserves, and has been cultivating a relationship with growing medicine and food at Greenspring Punch, a small farm north of Baltimore. By allowing music and improvisation to continue to shepherd her through life, she feels better capable to surf the density of the human condition and seeks to channel healing and encourage imaginative exploration and listening with her work. Some highlights of their performance history have been working with the High Zero Foundation and the True Vine in Baltimore, Rhizome and Union Arts in DC, Vox Populi in Philadelphia. They highly value the intimacy found in the countless living rooms and basements that have also provided space to share their vision. Jenny Moon Tucker primarily plays Alto Sax and percussive textures sourced though a variety of scrappy tools and contact microphones. Through play she coaxes voices out of objects that speak to her. She currently performs and records by herself and in various collaborations in the Baltimore and DC area. jennymoontucker.bandcamp.com/\n\n[back to the top]"
