        "text": "Origin\n\nMcColl : Scottish and Irish: Anglicized form of Gaelic Mac Colla (earlier Conla(e)) a patronymic from a personal name borne by three brothers who were the legendary ancestors of the kings of mid Ulster. The name has been explained as possibly meaning ‘great chief’. Historically there seems to have some confusion with McCullough as the surname was sometimes pronounced with a final fricative as Mac Collach.\n\nColl : 1: Scottish and Irish (Donegal): shortened form of McColl.2: English: variant of Cole.3: English: topographic name for someone who lived on a hill from Middle English Old English coll ‘hill’.4: Catalan: topographic name from coll ‘mountain pass’ from Latin collis ‘hill’.5: Americanized form of German Koll or Kohl.\n\nCollums : Shortened form of northern Irish McCollum with the addition of English patronymic -s. This surname is found mainly in MS.\n\nColly : 1: see Colley. 2: possibly also a reduced form of McColly itself a variant of McCully.\n\nCullum : 1: English: habitational name in part from places in Oxfordshire and Berkshire called Culham or from Colham Green in Middlesex. The first is named with an Old English personal name Cūla + hamm ‘river meadow’; the Berkshire name is from Old English cyln ‘kiln’ + Old English hām ‘homestead’ or hamm ‘river meadow’; and the Middlesex name is from the Old English personal name Cola + hamm ‘river meadow’.3: Scottish: possibly a shortened form of McCollum.2: English: variant of Colomb 2.\n\nMcCalla : 1: Irish (northern): variant of McCullough.2: Irish (northern): perhaps a variant of McColl.\n\nMcCole : Irish:: 1: variant of McCool 1.2: variant of McColl.\n\nMcCollam : Irish (northern): variant of McCollum.\n\nMcColley : Irish: probably a variant of McColl.\n\nMcCollom : Irish (northern): variant of McCollum.\n\nMcColm : Irish: variant of McCollum.\n\nMcCulla : 1: Irish: variant of McCullough.2: Irish: variant of McColl.3: Americanized form of Ukrainian Mikula.\n\nMcCullom : Scottish or northern Irish: variant of McCallum or McCollum.\n\nMcCullough : Irish (especially Ulster): Anglicized form of Gaelic Mac Cú Uladh a patronymic from the personal name Cú Uladh ‘hound of Ulster’. Compare McNally which is from Mac Con Uladh genitive form of the same name and McColl with which the name seems to have sometimes been confused. The name McCullough has sometimes been associated with Gaelic cullach ‘wild boar’ and some families in County Sligo translated it into English as Boar. However Mac Cú Uladh is the more likely explanation.\n\nMcCullum : Scottish or northern Irish: variant of McCallum or McCollum.\n\nMcCully : 1: Scottish: variant of McCulloch.2: Irish: variant of McColl.\n\nMore\n\nSource : DAFN2 : Dictionary of American Family Names 2nd edition, ©2022 by Patrick Hanks and Oxford University Press\n\nFANBI : The Oxford Dictionary if Family Names in Britain and Ireland, ©2016, University of the West of England"
