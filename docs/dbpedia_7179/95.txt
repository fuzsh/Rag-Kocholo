A stranger recently stopped Barbra Streisand and James Brolin in the grocery store and asked if they were getting divorced. "We were in the market, walking around, holding hands and looking at ice cream," says James incredulously. "We've been terrific. It's been 25 years now."

Since the moment Barbara, 80, and James, 82, stepped on to their first red carpet together, onlookers have gossiped that the romance of the superstar performer and the still-dashing leading man would not last. Today, the couple are enjoying the last laugh.

Their rules for a happy marriage are simple. "Neither one of us have ever gone out the door," he: says. "We are good at talking things out."

Barbra, who has talked about the benefits of counseling, says it's all about respect. "I don't think you can take each other for granted," she says.
