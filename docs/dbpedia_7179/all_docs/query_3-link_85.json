Interestingly, it took 11 years for the iconic entertainer to purchase her dream home, which has housed many memories for the happy couple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegendary powerhouse performer Barbara Streisand, 82, and her iconic actor husband of 26 years, James Brolin, 83, have been living in the same house with their dogs for many years. However, the journey to buying the home was not easy. The couple had to work hard to get to where they wanted to be.\n\nBarbra Streisand and James Brolin at the premiere of \"And So It Goes\" in East Hampton, New York on July 6, 2014 | Source: Getty Images\n\nStreisand saw the home for the first time when she was living nearby. However, she could not buy it because her boyfriend at the time didn't like it. Another factor prohibiting her from making the purchase was the fact that she was unable to afford the house at the time.\n\nA view of Barbra Streisand and James Brolin's home, posted on Novmeber 14, 2023 | Source: YouTube/The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, the couple lives in Streisand's dream home. This is the same home that saw them recently celebrate their 26th wedding anniversary on July 1. Taking to Instagram to mark the momentous milestone, Streisand posted an endearing photo of the two posing for a picture in a side embrace.\n\n\"28 years today since we met honey… and 26 years today since we married! Love you. B ❤️,\" penned the \"Funny Girl\" star in her caption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrolin and Streisand live in their house with their adorable Maltese poodles, which they are enamored with. Streisand has even shared photos of the dogs on their birthdays on her Instagram page. There are three dogs, Scarlet, Violet, and Fanny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first time that Streisand saw the home was in 1984 when she lived on a ranch down the road most weekends. She mentioned that she never really enjoyed that house and so, her real estate broker introduced her to a place near the ocean.\n\nStreisand admitted that the house's facade was not grand because it was a modern gray and looked like some sort of \"contraption.\" However, when she entered the home, she found that it had a \"rustic charm.\"\n\nBarbra Streisand showing Stephen Colbert around her home, posted on November 14, 2023 | Source: YouTube/The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Broadway star immediately fell in love with the house and wanted to purchase it. Unfortunately, this was not in the cards for her yet, and she had to wait many more years before she could finally call the house home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt that point, Streisand owned the ranch that she had been staying on, and her manager told her that until she sold the ranch, she would not be able to afford the home she had fallen in love with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also admitted that her boyfriend at the time thought the home she loved was too close to the cliff on which the house was situated. Streisand decided that she wouldn't buy it but confessed, \"I was so forlorn when I found out that it was sold to someone else, and they had started renovating it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephen Colbert and Barbra Streisand having a discussion, posted on November 14, 2023 | Source: YouTube/The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nStreisand's love for the home did not fade with time. In fact, she never stopped thinking about her dream house that she could not purchase for herself. She divulged that she felt deeply about the house.\n\nBarbra Streisand showing Gayle King around her home, posted on November 5, 2023 | Source: YouTube/CBS Sunday Morning\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough, at the time, she did not buy the home, Streisand still lived on the nearby ranch and often saw the place. She also said that the couple who owned the property knew how much she loved it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking about what she did after finding out that the home had been sold, she admitted, \"I would climb over the fence and walk around to see what they were doing and pine, literally pine for this house I didn't buy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, some years later, her luck turned around when the couple who owned the house kept her in mind as they got ready to move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe even bought a house one house away from her beloved home just because they were close together. Streisand then made friends with the old couple that had the house between the one she wanted and the one she owned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe revealed that when the old couple moved away, she bought their house with the thought that she would knock both homes down and build one big house for herself on the two-acre property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLo and behold, fate finally smiled upon her. The couple in the house that she wanted got divorced and reduced the price of the home, which meant that Streisand could finally afford to purchase the property for herself and finally call it home in 1995. She said she was grateful for the house because she did not have to build it or fuss over small details.\n\nThe House Is Picture Perfect\n\nStreisand may have waited a long time for her home, but she has made her life in that home beautiful since she moved in almost 30 years ago. She said the house paid homage to craftsmanship.\n\nThe beach front home of Barbra Streisand in Malibu, California on June 30, 1998 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA view inside Barbra Streisand's home, posted on November 14, 2023 | Source: YouTube/The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nFor the first few years, Streisand lived in the home with her husband, Brolin, and their dog at the time, Samantha. Unfortunately, Samantha has since passed away but left Streisand with two sweet pups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe home sits on a large land adorned with lush green lawns. An aerial shot of the house reveals the spacious garden and the pool at the front of the mansion, facing the ocean. The driveway is at the back of the house.\n\nTo help her design the interior of her home, Streisand studied many books and drew inspiration from things she had seen while traveling that were appealing to her. She also mentioned that she loved doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA view inside Barbra Streisand's home, posted on November 14, 2023 | Source: YouTube/The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nA view of the kitchen ware and crockery in Barbra Streisand's home, A view inside Barbra Streisand's home, posted on November 14, 2023 | Source: YouTube/The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nThe actress said that designing the interior was like making a film; she had a dream and a vision for the house. She could see what would look good in her head and translated that into the space, and confirmed she was happy with the results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA view inside Barbra Streisand's home, posted on November 5, 2023 | Source: YouTube/CBS Sunday Morning\n\nA view inside Barbra Streisand's home, posted on November 5, 2023 | Source: YouTube/CBS Sunday Morning\n\nStreisand's home sits on three acres of property and consists of four buildings. The mill house, the barn, Grandma's house, and the house that Streisand and Brolin live in are all on her property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA view inside Barbra Streisand's home, posted on November 5, 2023 | Source: YouTube/CBS Sunday Morning\n\nA view inside Barbra Streisand's home, posted on November 14, 2023 | Source: YouTube/The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\n\nShe then added streams into the landscape because she finds water to be a soothing element. Her reason for wanting a barn was simple; she finds them to be a staple of American culture. Interestingly, she has hens in her barn that lay green eggs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreisand has a fish pond filled with black and white fish outside the barn. The fish's colors were chosen carefully because Streisand felt that the colors of the fish needed to complement the black and white trim on the barn houses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from water allowing Streisand to feel peaceful, she also has a spiritual space in her home. She finds roses ethereal and therefore finds walking through the rose garden on her property a spiritual experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe home has seen many happy moments in Streisand's life and has been the longest witness to Streisand's enduring marriage to her husband. They have been married for 26 years this year and are still going strong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrolin and Streisand's Married Life\n\nStreisand and Brolin met in 1996 when they were 54 and 56, respectively. Each of them has children from a previous marriage and blended their families. It was two years after they met that the couple got married.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey said their \"I dos\" on Streisand's property. In his wedding speech, Brolin said, \"Every night is a new adventure. Sleeping is a waste of time. I can't wait to see her again in the morning.\"\n\nJames Brolin and Barbra Streisand at the 61st Annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California in 2004. | Source: Getty Images\n\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic was brutal for many people, and some relationships suffered because of being in quarantine, Streisand confirmed that she and Brolin were not negatively affected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking about how her relationship with her husband faired during the lockdown period, Streisand said, \"We've literally fallen in love over this period of time, just being stuck together every day and making it work.\"\n\nJames Brolin and Barbra Streisand at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in Beverly Hills, California on February 24, 2019 | Source: Getty Images\n\nEven after all the years and the many trials and tribulations that the couple has faced during their time together, they are still as in love as ever and have expressed that through their social media pages. Barbra Streisand still calls Brolin the love of her life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that they have reached 26 years of marriage together, with all their kids being grown and out of the house, the couple is now enjoying a new phase in their lives; being grandparents.\n\nStreisand and Brolin have grandchildren from their adult children who they always welcome to spend time with them in their loving home."
