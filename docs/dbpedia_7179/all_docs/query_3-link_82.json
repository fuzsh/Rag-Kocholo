        "text": "Barbra Streisand is reportedly letting the stress of low book sales cause tension in her marriage to James Brolin, RadarOnline.com has learned.\n\nInsiders claim the Funny Girl actress is furious because her memoir, My Name is Barbra, only sold a measly 210,000 copies during its first weeks on store shelves.\n\nIn addition to lackluster sales, insiders claimed Streisand is still reeling from being accused of snubbing late fashion designer Nolan Miller in her book. Stress is now said to be spilling over into the hitmaker's marriage.\n\nIn the tell-all, Streisand credits Donna Karen with creating the outfits she wore for her 1994 comeback tour. But a former pal of Miller — who designed the glam gowns worn by Linda Evans and Joan Collins during Dynasty's TV heyday in the '80s — insists the renowned designer was the mastermind behind her custom dresses!\n\nMoles additionally claimed Streisand, who's worth $400 million, was stunned by public backlash over her film company getting a $200,000 handout from the government's COVID-19 Paycheck Protection Program to pay staff at her oceanfront estate!\n\nNow, spies snitch Brolin, 83, is bearing the brunt of his wife's bad moods!\n\n\"Jim is sick of being her whipping boy,\" a tipster told the National Enquirer. \"She's in his face constantly and complaining about this or that.\"\n\nThe stress of backlash from her low-selling memoir hasn't been the only issue allegedly plaguing Brolin's marriage to Streisand as of late.\n\nAs this outlet reported, insiders revealed Streisand's insatiable bedroom needs were becoming too much for Brolin, whom she married in 1998. Sources claimed the award-winning actor \"simply can't keep up\" with Streisand's intimate demands.\n\n\"They've had a very active sex life that would make their friends blush, but these days she's just wearing him out,\" a tipster said of the couple."
