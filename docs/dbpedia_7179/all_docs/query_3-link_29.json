        "text": "James Brolin revealed he and Barbra Streisand did not have sex until their wedding night.\n\nThe 83-year-old actor made the revelation during a recent interview with CBS Mornings, pulling out the letter he wrote for Streisand during their 25th anniversary this year.\n\nDespite dating for nearly three years before tying the knot in 1998, Brolin claimed he was “celibate” that entire time.\n\n“I had been — literally it’s a wild word — but I had been celibate for three years, saying, ‘Who needs this?'” he told Gayle King in a joint interview with Streisand, 81.\n\nHe furthered that he didn’t “have any interest in getting involved in a lousy situation” at the time.\n\nStreisand clarified that her husband’s skepticism was due to the fact he had been “married twice before” while she “was only married once.”\n\nStreisand had previously been married to Elliott Gould from 1963 to 1971, while Brolin had been married to Jane Cameron Agee from 1966 to 1984 and Jan Smithers from 1986 to 1995.\n\n“After three years, that must have been a hell of a night then?” King quipped. Brolin agreed with a laugh, calling it “wild!”\n\nAdditionally, in his letter, the “Westworld” actor revealed that he had asked the “Funny Girl” star to marry him “a minimum of three times” before she finally said yes.\n\n“She wasn’t sure about this idea,” Brolin jokingly told King, as Streisand added that she “had to try him out!”\n\nDespite the skepticism and celibacy, Broslin described marrying Streisand as “just the best thing I’ve ever done.”\n\nDespite her career spanning over six decades, the EGOT winner told BBC that she “hasn’t had much fun” in her life — which she is now hoping to change.\n\n“I want to live life,” she told the outlet Monday. “I want to get in my husband’s truck and just wander, hopefully with the children somewhere near us.”\n\n“Life is fun for me when they come over. They love playing with the dogs and we have fun,” she continued. “I haven’t had much fun in my life, to tell you the truth. And I want to have more fun.”"
