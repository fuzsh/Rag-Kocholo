        "text": "They do, at least, seem chummy towards each other to this day. At some point, I even remember Elliot mentioning that Barbra had wanted to do Gypsy with him in the 80's with him as Herbie. I always liked that it seemed like they really got along. Some people really are better off as friends.\n\nI feel like Barbra never got credit before being as stunning as she was when she was young.\n\nHer beauty is much more obvious in 2018 when you see more diversity in models / actresses. She was very beautiful in a non-vanilla way.\n\nDidn't he say something awful about her once, or was it another guy? Something like \"She wants to be a beautiful lady, but she is neither one of those\"\n\nThey may have gotten on good terms, but he was not-so-friendly when she was cheating on him.\n\nBut he was a drug addict. So there is that.\n\nWHY? Because she cheated on him from day 1, and he couldn't hold a job. Besides being a drug user Gould had a nasty gambling habit (with her money) too. .But mostly, like all people who become rich and famous, Babs realized she didn't have to settle for a goofy nerdy guy. She became sought after.\n\nR7, Rex Reed (he hated her, so take it with a grain of salt) quoted Omar Sharif saying something like \"she wants to be a woman, she wants to be beautiful. She is neither.\" Since they definitely had an affair during the making of Funny Girl (confirmed by him), I figure she could have left him abruptly when the film was over and pissed him off. But Omar was a very nice man and I can't really see him saying anything so ungentlemanly to a reporter.\n\nOP, exquisite stranger, gorgeous nosy yenta, you want to know why I divorced Elliot? It's simple. But, my darling, before I tell you.. I'd like for you to, ahem,\n\nput out the light\n\nand close your eyes\n\ncome lie beside me - don't ask why\n\ncan't hide the fEEEEEEEEElin'\n\nthe fEEEEEEEElin's gone\n\nmy heart beLAHHHHHHHngs to mEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nThey seem to have a similar arrogance and huge egos. They were doomed to fail. Both people can't be assholes - one has to be willing to stay in the background and allow the other to shine.\n\nWho knows- neither was famous when they started dating and within couple few years she was the biggest new star in the world and within 5 years perhaps the biggest star, period. That cannot be easy."
