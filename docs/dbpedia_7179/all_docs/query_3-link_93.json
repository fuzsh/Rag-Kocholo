James Brolin has been gushing about falling in love all over again with Barbra Streisand while living under lockdown, but the duo aren’t seeing eye-to-eye when it comes to post-pandemic life, a source tells OK!.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“Now that L.A.’s opened up again, James is making up for lost time,” the source spills. “He’s seeing friends nonstop and doing fun stuff, but Barbra rarely joins him. It’s frustrating.”\n\nStreisand, 79, who tied the knot with the Traffic star, 80, in 1998, “had a period where she loved throwing dinner parties and playing matchmaker for friends. Now it’s like she’s slipped into her antisocial tendencies again,” says the source, noting that the reclusive diva is perfectly happy keeping company with her beloved pooches.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIt's really no surprise that Streisand likes to stay in. It's widely known that the iconic Funny Girl star actually had a serious case of stage fright. (In 2018, as a guest on James Corden's Carpool Karaoke, the singer clarified that she doesn't get \"nervous, nervous,\" but that she still gets \"scared\" and doesn't want to \"disappoint people.\")\n\nMORE ON:\n\nbarbra streisand\n\nHow Barbra Streisand, 78, Keeps The ‘Spark Alive’ With James Brolin, 79\n\nJames Brolin Was Celibate for 3 Years Before Marrying Barbra Streisand\n\nBarbra Streisand Dishes On Her Experience With Drugs, Says She Tried Smoking But 'Didn't Like How It Made Me Feel'\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBrolin, however, “is tired of being cooped up,” the source adds. “He wants Barbra to get out of the house with him, but there’s not many places they can go because she always takes the dogs!”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIt seems like the longtime couple are always going through cycles like such. Roughly one year ago, OK! sources revealed that Streisand felt like she and Brolin were in a rut, and that she wanted him to bring his A-game in the romance department.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"[Barbra is] into togetherness, holding hands, and gestures and tokens of affection. Those mean everything to her,\" a source said at the time, adding that the couple started to take dance and cooking classes virtually, in addition to romantic walks, to get their relationship back on track.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nStreisand and Brolin have been married for over two decades. The couple tied the knot on July 1, 1998, but have no children together. Brolin has two sons, actor Josh Brolin and Jess, from his first marriage to Jane Cameron Agee, and one daughter, Molly, from his second marriage to Jan Smithers. Streisand shares son Jason with ex Elliott Gould.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore From OK! Magazine"
