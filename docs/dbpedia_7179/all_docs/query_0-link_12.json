        "text": "\"A little less conversation...\"\n\nThat's likely the same lyrics Elliott Gould would've repeated back to Elvis Presley after an encounter that riled that veteran actor way back when.\n\nGould, who can list the likes of The Long Goodbye, M*A*S*H, Friends, and Ocean's 11 amongst his acting credits, was a self-confessed Presley fanatic.\n\nAfter admiring him from afar throughout his youth, the actor eventually got the opportunity to meet the King Of Rock 'n' Roll during the 1970s.\n\nThough, it didn't necessarily pan out as he'd initially envisaged, as he recently recalled in an interview with FOX News.\n\nWatch Elvis Presley cover 'Get Back' in incredible Beatles rehearsal jam\n\nElvis Presley once admitted to Tom Jones who he thought the real king of rock and roll was\n\nWhen The Beatles paid tribute to their \"messiah\" with an Elvis Presley cover version\n\nElvis Presley's 25 greatest songs ever, ranked\n\n\"I had always wanted to meet Elvis,\" Gould gushed. \"I was deeply involved in musical comedy. I was a chorus boy on Broadway — I was brought up and trained that way.\"\n\n\"So I asked if we could arrange for me to come and meet Elvis… and I got it.\"\n\nGould was at the height of his fame at the same time Elvis Presley was performing at the International Hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nBut after only a few minutes in each other's company, the actor turned round to Presley and told him to \"shut up\".\n\nAfter watching Elvis perform in Las Vegas, Gould was taken backstage to meet The King, who was surrounded by his entourage of usual suspects: Colonel Tom Parker and his father.\n\n\"Elvis opened the door,\" recalled Gould. \"He had a gold-gilded .45 pistol in his belt. His father, Vernon, and his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, were in the room.\"\n\nBut rather than exchange tales of their success stories or admire each other's respective crafts, Presley only had one thing on his mind.\n\nGould had recently split from wife Barbra Streisand, who he married in 1963 after meeting on Broadway, and would later divorce in 1971.\n\n\"He said to me, 'Why did you and Barbra break up?' You're two of my favourite people.'\"\n\nTaken aback by the star's lack of decorum asking someone he'd never met about his marital strife, Gould snapped: \"Shut up, Elvis.\"\n\nElvis may've had a genuine interest in Barbra, who was one of the biggest stars of the era also.\n\nHe was reported to have been Streisand's first choice to feature alongside her in the 1976 remake of A Star Is Born, a role The King seriously considered taking.\n\nAny chance of starring in it was derailed by Colonel Tom Parker however, as his demands for top-billing and a preposterously eye-watering salary meant they looked elsewhere, eventually offering the role to country troubadour Kris Kristofferson.\n\nIn light of Presley getting straight to the nitty gritty of Gould's personal life, the actor did the same to Elvis, emphasising the control Parker and Presley's father had over his entire life.\n\n\"Your daddy and the Colonel aren't going to let us be alone for too long,\" he remembered telling Presley. \"You're a cash cow to these people.\"\n\nBarbra Streisand almost starred with Cliff Richard in The Young Ones, but was turned down\n\nWho was Colonel Tom Parker? The story of Elvis Presley's infamous manager\n\nElvis Presley's incredible performance of 'Unchained Melody' just two months before he died\n\nQUIZ: How well do you know Elvis Presley's song lyrics?\n\n\"Why don't you come out and just be free, just be a free spirit? Leave Elvis here and come out and be free.\"\n\nAs history tells us, Presley didn't heed the advice given to him by Gould, and remained under the watchful control of Parker and his father until his tragic death in 1977 at the age of just 42.\n\nSharing some insight into his relationship with Barbra after they split in 1971, Gould reiterated: \"She's family.\"\n\n\"She's the mother of my son [Jason]. My children are no errors. I'm devoted to my children and their mother(s).\""
