The couple finalized their divorce the following year but remain on good terms and have been seen together at dinners recently.\n\n\"Barbra is already planning intimate dinner parties where Jen will be seated next to someone genuinely compatible,\" shared the well-informed source.\n\n\"Jen is flattered by the special attention she's receiving and believes that positive changes are on the horizon.\n\nIn an interview with Allure magazine in December, Jennifer admitted to longing for a meaningful relationship.\n\n\"I would love to be in a partnership. Who knows? There are moments when I just want to curl up and say, 'I need support.' It would be wonderful to come home and find solace in someone's arms after a tough day,\" she noted."
