Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 1996: Streisand and Brolin were set up\n\nStreisand revealed in a 2021 appearance on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" that she and Brolin were set up on their first date at a dinner party.\n\n\"We were set up as a blind date, and I was so shy that I came into the house and I went downstairs to be with the children and play with them until I had to sit down at the table,\" Streisand said.\n\nAccording to the singer, she made a joke about Brolin's hair and didn't expect him to ask her on a second date.\n\n\"I expected a guy with a brown beard and brown, wavy hair, like a mountain man. And I saw a guy that had all his hair cut off, no beard, and I walked by him. I put my hand through his hair and said, 'Who fucked up your hair?'\" Streisand recalled.\n\nDespite her snarky remark, the two eventually began dating.\n\nNovember 1996: The couple made their red-carpet debut at the New York premiere of one of Streisand's films.\n\nStreisand directed and starred in the 1996 rom-com \"The Mirror Has Two Faces,\" which features Jeff Bridges as her character's love interest. Streisand also sang the theme song for the film, \"I Finally Found Someone.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch 1997: They attended the Oscars together.\n\nFor her performance of \"I Finally Found Someone,\" Streisand was nominated for an Oscar for best original song. Brolin once again accompanied her on the red carpet, and the couple posed for photos ahead of the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAugust 1998: The pair stepped out at Brolin's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony.\n\nJust a few weeks after their wedding, Brolin and Streisand made a public appearance together at the unveiling of Brolin's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFebruary 2001: Brolin was by Streisand's side when she was honored by the American Film Institute.\n\nStreisand received the AFI's lifetime achievement award in 2001, for her numerous contributions to film as a singer, actor, and director.\n\nBrolin walked the red carpet with his wife, and was also shown watching her adoringly while she gave her acceptance speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanuary 2003: Streisand attended the premiere of Brolin's film with him.\n\nBrolin appeared in the 2003 comedy \"A Guy Thing\" along with Jason Lee, Julia Stiles, and Selma Blair.\n\nThe inseparable couple walked the red carpet together at the Los Angeles premiere of the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2004: The couple made numerous public appearances together.\n\nIn addition to attending the Golden Globes and the Oscars that year, Brolin and Streisand also stepped out for the December premiere of Streisand's comedy \"Meet the Fockers.\"\n\nStreisand famously starred in the comedy along with Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, and Dustin Hoffman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 2007: The two traveled to France when Streisand was awarded the Légion d'Honneur.\n\nAs a 2008 article from the New York Times explained, the Legion d'Honneur is an award given out by the French government to French nationals or foreigners who've contributed significantly to either French culture or humanity's enrichment as a whole.\n\nStreisand was awarded chevalier status during the 2007 ceremony, with Brolin, of course, at her side.\n\nJanuary 2011: Streisand and Brolin attended a state dinner together.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama reportedly invited Brolin and Streisand to the dinner, which was hosted in honor of then Chinese president Hu Jintao during his visit to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 2018: Streisand and Brolin celebrated their 20th anniversary.\n\n\"Has it really been 22 years since our blind date @jamesbrolin_ ? Married for 20 years. Happy anniversary honey,\" Streisand captioned a sweet Instagram post featuring her and Brolin smiling together.\n\nShe signed her heartfelt message: \"Bee. X,\" an apparent reference to Brolin's nickname for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 2020: The pair celebrated another anniversary amid lockdown.\n\nThe \"Funny Girl\" star shared an image from her and Brolin's 1998 wedding on Instagram to celebrate their anniversary in lockdown.\n\n\"There's no one I'd rather be locked up with you honey — can't believe it's been 24 years together! Happy anniversary,\" Streisand captioned the photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 2023: Streisand's memoir is released, and includes details about her relationship with Brolin.\n\nStreisand devoted a whole chapter of her memoir to her relationship with Brolin, whom she affectionately calls Jim. In the chapter, she rehashes the details of their first meeting, and shares how she felt ambivalent about settling down again when they began dating.\n\n\"Jim and I met at a point in my life when I had basically given up on finding someone. And frankly, I was all right with being on my own. I had my son, I had great friends to keep me company, my work was fulfilling, and I loved my new house in Malibu overlooking the ocean,\" Streisand wrote.\n\n\"Maybe you have to be happy with yourself before you can be happy with someone else,\" she added.\n\nLater, Streisand praised Brolin's hobbies (including flying planes) and appearance.\n\n\"I thought he was such an intriguing combination… tall, great-looking, and if we were in a plane and something happened to the pilot, he could take over!\" she wrote.\n\n\"Jim was also a very good driver, from racing cars when he was younger. He was kindhearted and sensitive, and he made me feel safe,\" Streisand continued, adding: \"He told me, 'I fell in love with you the first night we met, when you said, Who fucked up your hair? I knew from that moment we would be together.'\"\n\nRead next\n\nCelebrities\n\nAdvertisement"
