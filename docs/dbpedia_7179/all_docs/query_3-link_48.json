She is among the few performers awarded an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT).\n\nBarbara Joan Streisand was born April 24, 1942 to Emanuel and Diana Streisand in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nBarbra started her career by performing in night clubs and theaters around New York. She signed to Columbia Records and released her first album, \"The Barbra Streisand Record,\" in 1963, which went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Album of the Year.\n\nBy the end of the sixties, Barbra ventured into film, starring in \"Funny Girl,\" which led to starring roles in several top films of the era. With the release of \"Yentl,\" she became the first woman to write, produce, direct, and star in a major studio film.\n\nBarbra has been married twice. Her first husband was actor Elliott Gould, whom she married on September 13, 1963. They announced their separation on February 12, 1969, and divorced on July 6, 1971. They had one child, Jason Gould.\n\nHer second husband is actor James Brolin, whom she married on July 1, 1998.\n\nStreisand is the owner of multiple dogs.\n\nBarbra dropped the middle \"a\" in her name in an attempt to unique (no one else was spelling it that way) yet still authentic to who she was (still a Barbara).\n\nSources\n\nWikipedia contributors, \"Barbra Streisand,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbra_Streisand&oldid=1129365885 (accessed December 26, 2022)."
