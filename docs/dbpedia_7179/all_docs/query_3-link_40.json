        "text": "Barbra Streisand and James Brolin's now-24-year love story began with a serendipitous meeting. Which, we can't lie, truly is the best kind.\n\nThe pair first met in 1996, shortly after the singer and actress directed and starred in the film The Mirror Has Two Faces. She was 55, while Brolin was 56.\n\nAccording to Streisand, she and Brolin, who has starred in films like Capricorn One (1977) and the Leonardo DiCaprio classic, Catch Me If You Can, were actually set up.\n\nREAD MORE: Salma Hayek's love story with billionaire François-Henri Pinault began with a 'silly' conversation\n\nWhile blind dates \"aren't her thing\", Streisand, now 80, says she played along, deciding to attend a dinner party thrown by her ex-boyfriend Jon Peters' ex-wife. (Try wrapping your head around that!)\n\nOn the night, Streisand wasn't afraid to be herself. In an interview with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, she admits she had a moment where she thought her brazenness may have cost her the match. Watch the hilarious clip above.\n\n\"I expected a guy with a brown beard and brown, wavy hair, like a mountain man,\" she told Fallon. \"And I saw a guy that had all his hair cut off, no beard, and I walked by him. I put my hand through his hair and I said, 'Who f---ed up your hair?'\"\n\nBut for Brolin, now 81, that was enough to capture his heart. \"He told me he knew right away,\" Streisand revealed. Meanwhile, for her, she says it \"took a few days\" until she knew the match was right.\n\nIn an interview with W Magazine, Streisand says she's realised the key to her husband's heart is being an open book. Recalling the meeting, she said, \"That's when he fell in love with me. My fella likes to hear the truth.\"\n\nAccording to her, the night they met, a smitten Brolin told her, \"I'm taking you home with me.\"\n\nStreisand admits: \"I've had butterflies in my stomach ever since.\"\n\nHow serendipity played its part\n\nThe Funny Girl star was never afraid to speak too early about how deeply in love she was with her new beau.\n\nIn a 1996 interview with The Los Angeles Times, a few months after their first meeting, an excited Streisand gushed about how she and Brolin's match truly came down to \"chance\".\n\nShe even went so far as to say that she \"manifested\" it after directing her film The Mirror Has Two Faces: \"You dream the film and then you manifest the film.\"\n\nIntriguingly, Streisand's character in the film is an overlooked, homely woman who ends up marrying a man for \"platonic reasons\". Yet by the end, the character ends up charming her husband, who at first, only saw their marriage as one of convenience.\n\nIn some ways, Streisand said she saw the film as a reflection of her life.\n\nAt the time, she had spent decades dating and jumping from relationship to relationship. She'd had a failed marriage with ex Elliot Gould, and then gone through a fizzled-out long-time relationship with film producer (who produced Streisand's star film, A Star is Born) Jon Peters.\n\nREAD MORE: Love Stories: Patrick Swayze thought there was no better dancer than his wife Lisa Niemi\n\nFor Streisand, she believes that by meeting Brolin, her trajectory in love and life was finally transformed.\n\nIn fact, in the interview, Streisand admitted that she was glad she'd crossed paths with Brolin at the time that she did.\n\n\"I couldn't have met him while I was making [The Mirror Has Two Faces]. I wouldn't have been open,\" she said at the time.\n\nOpposites attract\n\nIt's quite well known that both Streisand and Brolin are opposites in many ways. She loves to perform and be at the centre of the party, while he is quiet and reserved.\n\nYet they share some deep and important interests, from architecture and design to film, charitable work and politics.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Brolin revealed his wife often works a busy schedule, but they make an effort to carve out time for each other.\n\n\"I always get notes, 'Hurry home!' When I get there, there's always something kind of great waiting for me,\" he said.\n\nBrolin added they understand their space and boundaries, which makes their time together all the more special.\n\nWhile \"people dared to say [the relationship] wouldn't work\" when they first got together, Streisand and Brolin are now going on 25 years married, having wed on July 1, 1998.\n\nIt was a stripped-back affair, held at Streisand's gorgeous $100 million Malibu estate, which sits cliffside on Point Dume.\n\nThe home was bought by Streisand in 1997 and is made up of three different properties on the cliffside. It's so famous it's been featured in Architectural Digest and The Oprah Winfrey Show.\n\nGrowing old together\n\nIt's this grand home that now takes up most of the couple's spare time – at least, while they're not chasing after kids and grandkids.\n\nBrolin has three children, plus grandchildren from his former relationships, while Streisand has her son Jason Gould, who is now 55.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the pair enjoyed their time so much together, Brolin told The Talk they \"fell in love\" again.\n\nREAD MORE: Love Stories: Sarah put on ad on Gumtree and stumbled across the love of her life\n\n\"We've literary fallen in love over this period of time, just being stuck together every day and making it work,\" he said in the June 2021 interview.\n\n\"Neither one of us [have] ever gone out the door and we are good at talking things out and 23 years is better than ever.\"\n\nDuring that time, Brolin revealed to Parade Magazine their luxurious estate had, of course, provided all the comforts while they battled quarantine.\n\n\"It's brought us closer because we fill the day together. We sit out reading whatever periodicals are stacking up. This time has been a big gift.\"\n\nIn 2021, Streisand agreed life was much sweeter growing old with Brolin.\n\n\"I'm enjoying my grandchildren and there's nothing like family and home and pure love and joy and connection,\" she told Variety."
