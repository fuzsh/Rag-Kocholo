        "text": "She also says it took her ten years to – quite literally – pen her own biography.\n\nShe handwrote the entire manuscript, admitting: “I never learned to type.”\n\nThe book spans her life from a fatherless childhood in Brooklyn, through her stellar Hollywood career and first marriage to Elliot Gould as well as long-term partners Jon Peters and Richard Baskin.\n\nStreisand also recounts how she turned down an indecent proposal by Hollywood legend Marlon Brando, during a 1966 dinner party at which his then-wife was also a guest.\n\nDespite turning him down flat, the two became firm friends and she remembers him calling her to critique her performance in 1968’s Funny Girl, saying: “You were really good….but you run funny.”"
