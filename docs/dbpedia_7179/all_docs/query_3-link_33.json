        "text": "Background\n\nBarbra Joan Streisand was born on April 24, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York City, she was born in a Jewish family to Diana Ida and Emanuel. She joined a summer theater group in Malden Bridge, New York, and began concentrating on acting while still in high school. She moved to Manhattan, after graduation. And her first break came in 1960 when she sang at a small local nightclub and won an amateur talent contest. Eventually, she landed a small comic role as Miss Marmelstein in the Broadway musical “I Can Get It for You Wholesale” in 1962 and stole the show. An overnight sensation, she made several television appearances. In 1963, she released a series of best-selling record albums featuring vibrant and original interpretations of popular songs.\n\nHer debut solo album “The Barbra Streisand Album,” won Grammy Awards for album of the year and best female vocal performance — the first two of many. The actress starred in several film musicals during the 1960s and 70s, including “Funny Lady” in 1975, “Hello, Dolly!” in 1969, “On a Clear Day You Can See Forever” in 1970, and “A Star Is Born” in 1976. She played the romantic lead in the hugely popular “The Way We Were” in 1973. And made her directorial debut in 1983 with “Yentl,” followed by “Nuts” in 1987, “The Prince of Tides” in 1991, and “The Mirror Has Two Faces” in 1996. She then appeared in broad comedies like “Meet the Fockers” in 2004, the sequel “Little Fockers” in 2010, and “The Guilt Trip” in 2012. Despite the clear variety, most of Streisand’s characters shared the qualities of strength and fierce independence combined with vulnerability.\n\nShe has succeeded despite the widespread early opinion that her unconventional looks would keep her from becoming a major movie star. Streisand has been married twice. She married actor Elliott Gould on September 13, 1963. They divorced on July 6, 1971. They had one child, Jason. On July 1, 1998, she married actor James Brolin. They have no children yet but Brolin has two sons from his first marriage and a daughter from his second marriage. In her 50 years of profession, she has added to the entertainment industry in a personal and unique way and has gathered a multi-generational fan base."
