After being set up on a blind date in 1996, the two got married a couple years later, and have been going strong ever since.\n\nThe couple have supported one another during major career moments, but also weathered the initial COVID-19 lockdown together. And in Streisand's new memoir \"My Name is Barbra,\" released in November, she shared more details about her relationship with Brolin.\n\nHere's a timeline of Streisand and Brolin's iconic romance."
