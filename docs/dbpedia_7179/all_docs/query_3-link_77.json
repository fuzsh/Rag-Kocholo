Years before she met Brolin, Streisand married Elliot Gould in 1963 and welcomed son Jason before they split in 1971. Brolin, for his part, walked down the aisle twice before meeting the singer; he was married to Jane Cameron Agee from […]\n\nKing, 68, was taken aback by Brolin abstaining from sex for three years, but the Lightyear actor just had no desire to get mixed up with someone after his split from Jan Smithers in 1995. The former spouses, who share daughter Molly Elizabeth, were together nearly 10 years before calling it quits.\n\nBrolin was also married to Jane Cameron Agee from 1966 to 1984. He shares sons Josh and Jess Brolin with Agee, who died in 1995.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Couples Who Prove That Love Isn’t Dead\n\nIn light of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s headline-making split on Tuesday, September 20, Us Weekly rounded up some of Hollywood’s hottest celebrity couples who prove that love isn’t dead — see who made the cut!\n\n“I had not had any interest in getting involved in a lousy situation,” James explained to King, to which she replied, “After three years, that must have been a hell of a night then?” He let out a laugh, calling his and Streisand’s wedding night “wild.”\n\nThe couple, who celebrated 25 years of marriage in July, also shared James’ handwritten letter for the occasion with viewers. In the note, the Life in Pieces alum revealed that he proposed to the “Memory” singer three times before she agreed.\n\nRelated: Barbra Streisand’s Book Revelations: Bombshells From ‘My Name Is Barbra’\n\nBarbra Streisand didn’t hold back while writing her long-awaited memoir My Name Is Barbra. “For forty years, publishers have been asking me to write an autobiography. But I kept turning them down, because I prefer to live in the present rather than dwell on the past,” Streisand wrote in the prologue. “And the fact is, […]\n\n“I don’t know, I have to try them out first — for at least two years,” Streisand quipped when asked why she didn’t immediately say “yes” to an engagement. The Grammy winner appeared to be referring to her first marriage to Elliot Gould from 1963 to 1971. The exes share one son, Jason Gould.\n\nDespite a slow start to their union, James and Streisand’s romance has continued to grow in time. James proved that in his letter, writing, “Home is not a place, home is a person. You know someone is right for you if you love to be with them all the time. And when I go, when I finally go, I will love you then.”\n\nStreisand was in awe of her spouse, adding, “You wrote that honey … and I was, like, in shock!”"
