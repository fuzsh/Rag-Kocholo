For 10 years from 1867 to 1877 Tucson was the capital of the Arizona Territory. By the time Arizona became a state on February 14, 1912 the capital had been in Phoenix for several years.

The first capital in 1863 was Fort Whipple in Chino Valley, Arizona.

In 1867, the territorial capital was moved to Tucson for ten years.

During 1877, the capital moved back to Prescott.
