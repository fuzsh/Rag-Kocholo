        "text": "Tucson is the economic and dynamic cultural heart of a metro area that is home to more than one million people. It is Arizona’s second largest city and one of the longest continuously inhabited cities in the United States. The city has a rich historical and archeological record that dates back more than 4,000 years. It offers more than 350 days of sunshine and an average temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Surrounded by majestic mountains, Tucson offers year-round hiking, biking, golf and other outdoor activities. It is known for its market concentration of aerospace and defense companies and transportation and logistics assets. Tucson is home to one of the nation’s top research institutions, the University of Arizona.\n\nPrincipal Economic Activities\n\nPRINCIPAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES (SECOND PARAGRAPH): Tucson is recognized as a national leader in aerospace and defense, photonics and optics and renewable energy and natural resources. Research, development, and manufacturing in these industry sectors are major components of Tucson’s economy. Raytheon Missiles & Defense is the largest private sector employer in Tucson, with more than 12,000 employees, and the share of employment in the Aerospace and Defense cluster is almost eight times the national average. Tucson’s photonics and optics cluster is a key enabler of many industries, most notably aerospace and defense, and the share of employment in this industry is more than three times the national average. Tucson is also emerging as a hub for renewable energy and natural resources technology, with assets such as the University of Arizona Tech Park and Arizona Research Institute for Solar Energy. Tucson is a natural logistics hub because of its strategic location near the Mexican border and proximity to Phoenix and California. Excellent transportation infrastructure, including Tucson International Airport, the Union Pacific Railroad main line, Interstate 10 and Interstate 19 facilitate civic and commercial activity.

Tucson is a city that proudly embraces its people through cultural celebrations and activism. It is a UNESCO designated City of Gastronomy: locally sourced foods display the culture and long agricultural history native to the land. Tucson offers an amazing variety of attractions and events. Regional attractions include Saguaro National Park, the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, the Tucson Museum of Art, Coronado National Forest, Mission San Xavier del Bac and the Pima Air and Space Museum. Signature events include the world-renowned Tucson Gem & Mineral Show, the All Souls Procession, and the 4th Avenue Street Fair. Downtown Tucson is thriving like never before, thanks in large part to the SunLink modern streetcar. The 4-mile streetcar route connects major employment and entertainment districts that offer diverse opportunities for dining, entertainment, night life, shopping, employment, cultural experiences and lodging that are uniquely Tucson.\n\nCommunity Facilities\n\nWithin the last decade, sweeping infrastructure developments in Tucson have paved the way for increased economic development. From roadways to bridges to streetcars, improved infrastructure continues to attract private capital investment and create quality jobs in the community. Residents have empowered the City of Tucson to continue investing in public infrastructure. In May 2022, they voted for Proposition 411 to extend an existing temporary half-cent sales tax for an additional 10 years. An estimated $740 million generated by the tax will be used for neighborhood street improvements, traffic signal upgrades, and street safety projects. This follows on the success of previous voter approved investments in streets, public safety, and parks.
