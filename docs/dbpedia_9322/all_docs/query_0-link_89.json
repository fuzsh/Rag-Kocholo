The Indian name for the little town was \"stjukshon, which is pronounced like Tucson. The loose translation of the word is \"springs at the foot of the black hill,\" which is probably referring to the springs along the banks of the Santa Cruz River. The San Xavier Mission was established here in 1700 by a Spanish Jesuit Priest, Eusebio Francisco Kino. This settlement was actually at a nearby village named Bac. Many ranchers came which forced the Apaches out of their homes. This resulted in many Indian raids on the settlement causing the people to withdraw to a mission near Tubac. In 1776 a new presidio was built and the people all came to Tucson to live.\n\nIn 1821, Mexico took over possession of the area from Spain. During the Mexican War in 1846, a commander of the Mormon Battalion raised a US flag over the settlement. The road the battalion built was a major road for travelers to and from California. After much dispute over the corridor and the rights to the area, the Gadsden Purchase in 1854 established southern Arizona and Tucson with the rest of the Arizona Territory. In 1857, the area became a stage stop for the Overland Stage lines between San Diego and San Antonio. This was a well-used route by travelers. Tucson became a major supply center during the civil war both for soldiers and for miners.\n\nFrom 1867 to 1877, Tucson was the Arizona Territorial Capital. It gained further status with the arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1880 and the founding of the University of Arizona in 1885. It was Arizona's largest city until 1920 when Phoenix surpassed Tucson's numbers. During the 1950's, Tucson began to be a major tourist center. The \"Old Pueblo\" area was restored and is visited by many each year.\n\nHere is a history page for Tucson.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nThe founding of Tucson\n\n1775\n\nAttractions\n\nAttractions in Tucson.\n\nMetropolitan Tucson Convention & Visitors Bureau\n\n130 S.
