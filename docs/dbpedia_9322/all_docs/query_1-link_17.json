        "text": "The City Of Tucson AZ\n\nModern Lifestyles In The Heart Of The Old West\n\nTucson AZ is in southern Arizona about 90 miles south of Phoenix. And to the south, the Mexican border is 75 miles away.\n\nTucson is the second largest city in Arizona. And Tucson has the second lowest costs of living in the state. But Phoenix is more well known due to its size and as the Capital of Arizona.\n\nFor this reason, Tucson AZ has flown under the radar in many ways. It remains a hidden gem as a place to live, winter or to retire too. Tucson embraces its history and cultural heritage.\n\nAs a matter of fact, southern Arizona and the Tucson area are one of the oldest inhabited areas in North America. Long before Spanish soldiers arrived in the 1600’s, Hohokam Indians farmed the area. Yes, farmed in the Sonora Desert Valley that surrounds Tucson.\n\nFor 4,000 years the Hohokam’s built villages close to streams and the region’s rich bottom land. Furthermore, these Tuscon Basin villagers were part of the larger Hohokam world.\n\nCanals\n\nAlso, the Hohokam established significant trading centers throughout the southwest. And are the original builders of the canal system around the Phoenix area.\n\nThese ancient canals were rebuilt by Mormon pioneer settling in the Lehi area of Mesa, Arizona.\n\nThe name of the city “Tucson” also comes from the Pima Indians, direct descendants of the Hohokam’s.\n\nAt the foot of “A Mountain” west of the downtown Tucson AZ, is the site of Pima Indian village called “Schuk-shon”. The name means “the place at the foot of the Black Mountain”. The Spanish who inhabited the area in the early 1700’s pronounced it “Tucson”.\n\nSpain’s Role In Tucson\n\nAs Spain expanded its position in the world, they sent soldiers and priests to Mexico. A country they owned at that time.\n\nFrom there they moved north into America. Much of what is now the southwest United States was under Spanish rule.\n\nAlong with the soldiers, came Father Francisco Kino. He established the Mission San Xavier del Bac in 1699. It was a work in progress for almost 100 years. Being completed in 1797.\n\nAnother great work is the Mission San Agustin, a “visita” of San Xavier. This smaller mission sits on the west bank of the Santa Cruz River. The construction of the mission and the convento started in 1757. It took 33 years to complete construction and completed in 1790’s.\n\nIn 1775, Hugo O’Conor established the Tucson Presidio. That year marked the official birth date of the City of Tucson AZ.\n\nTucson was part of Mexico when it fought for independence from Spain in 1821. With the Gadsden Purchase in 1854, Tucson AZ became part of the United States.\n\nGadsden Purchase\n\nThe end of the Mexican-American in 1848 established the border between the countries. Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The U.S/Mexican border ran along the Gila River.\n\nIt is important to realize that the Gila River is south of Phoenix. And for this reason, what is now southern Arizona and the City of Tucson belonged to Mexico.\n\nIn 1862, the U.S. Government’s also decided to build the transcontinental railroad. In light of that, planning for two railroad lines began.\n\nOne with a central Route through the United States. And a second Southern route through Arizona and New Mexico.\n\nBut the treaty with Mexico meant the railroad needed to run north of the Gila River. The mountains in this area make the cost of the rail line more expensive.\n\nFor this reason, the Gadsden Purchase came about. It moved the U.S border farther south. And made building the southern transcontinental railroad cheaper and faster.\n\nTo be sure, without the Gadsden Purchase in 1853, Tucson AZ might still be part of Mexico.\n\nRailroads, Silver, And Gold\n\nOf equal importance, the Southern Railroad route was critical to settling the southwest.\n\nIn 1877 silver was discovered in southern Arizona near the Goose Flats. It was one of the largest silver finds of the time.\n\nIn a like manner, the growth of the mining industry created a population boom. And Tucson, along with other Arizona towns, began to grow.\n\nThe Journey To Now\n\nArizona became an official territory in 1863. And between 1867 and 1877, Tucson AZ was the territorial capital.\n\nIn 1880, Tucson’s population reached 8,000. The driver of this growth was the Southern Pacific Railroad.\n\nArizona became the 48th state in 1912. The last state on the 48 states in the continental United States.\n\nBy 1950 Tucson’s population reaches 120,000. And by 1960 it doubled to 220,000. Not only was this growth driven by copper mining, but also by new technology. Air Conditioning!\n\nBy 1990, Tucson AZ is the 33rd largest U.S. city with a population over 400,000. And the 2010 census estimated the population of the City of Tucson at 526,000.\n\nAnd coupled with the growth in the City Of Tucson, so did the greater metro area. The 2010 census estimated the population of the Tucson metro area to be 980,000.\n\nAnd the 2017 estimated population for the Tucson metro area is over 1 million.\n\nThings To Know About Living In The Tucson AZ Metro Area\n\nLiving In Tucson\n\nMonsoons In Tucson\n\nMoving To Tucson\n\nTucson Crime Report\n\nArizona Wildlife\n\nTucson Streetcars\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\nMountains Around Tucson\n\nSelecting A Moving Company\n\nSome Tucson History\n\nFree Info for Relocating to Tucson\n\nTucson’s “A” Mountain\n\nUniversity Of Arizona\n\nTucson Events\n\nTucson Attractions\n\nScenes Of Tucson\n\nTucson AZ Historic Neighborhoods\n\nBarrio Viejo\n\nLost Barrio\n\nSam Hughes\n\nA Perfect Blend Of Desert And Mountains\n\nThe Sonora Desert Valley is a unique setting for the City of Tucson AZ. Tucson and its neighboring communities exist in a natural desert landscape. But the surrounding mountain ranges create a stunning backdrop.\n\nEach of the five mountain ranges is distinct. From the soft rolling slopes of the Tortolita mountains in the north. To the tall and jagged ridges of the Catalina Mountains. The mountains create a unique and distinctive setting for the Town of Oro Valley.\n\nThe City of Tucson covers almost 600 square miles of desert landscape. The topography changes along with the mountain ranges based on where you are. This provides residents an array of natural landscapes, desert vistas, and mountain views.\n\nThe mountain ranges are a distinctive part of everyday life in the City of Tucson and metro area.\n\nTucson AZ And Southwest Home Decor\n\nArchitecture In the Southwest\n\nSouthwest Decor\n\nSouthwest Homes\n\nUse Desert Colors For A Tucson Home\n\nNew Construction Homes\n\nTop Color Trends\n\nBathroom Remodeling Ideas\n\nSwimming Pool Ideas And Tips\n\nWeather\n\nTucson Weather is “Outstanding”. Tucson AZ boasts more than 350 days of sunshine every year. That makes it the sunniest city in the United States! OK, there may be some broken clouds.\n\nTucson weather has warm days and when the sun sets the evenings are cool and comfortable. Tucson weather in spring, fall & winter seasons provides mild temperatures that are legendary.\n\nSummers can be hot. But the low humidity makes the high temperatures tolerable and the evenings pleasant.\n\nA study by the NOAA stated Tucson AZ is one of the cooler cities in Arizona. That’s based on average summer temperatures, not being a “cool place” to live.\n\nThe Gulf Of California influences Tucson’s desert climate. The Gulf Of California is about 200 miles to the southwest. The summer moisture from the gulf creates summer monsoons.\n\nWhat Is A Monsoon?\n\nOne of the frequent questions hear from our clients is “What is a monsoon?”\n\nThe word monsoon originates from the Arabic word mausim, which means season. For centuries traders sales the waters off the Arabian and Indian coasts.\n\nThey observed that dry northeast winds in the winter turned to the southwest in summer.\n\nThat change brought torrential rains to the Asian landmass.\n\nIn the Asian landmass and the Sonora Desert Valley of Tucson, these rains are beneficial. The desert wildlife and vegetation need water. Even the cacti.\n\nThese wind shifts are the mechanism for the monsoons in southern Arizona. For a most of the year, low-level winds of Tucson’s Sonora desert regions tend to blow from the land toward the sea.\n\nIn this case, the Sea is either the Gulf of California or Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBut in summer the winds shift from west to southeast. That brings moisture from the Gulf of California and Gulf of Mexico into the area.\n\nMonsoon Season\n\nThe official period for monsoons in Tucson AZ is from June 15 to September 30. During this period prevailing winds switch from westerly to southeasterly. That wind shift brings more moisture in from the Gulf of California (mostly) and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nCoupled with the increased moisture is a higher dew point.\n\nMost of Tucson’s summer days begin clear and warm. As the day progresses, giant clouds develop and tower high into the sky above the mountains. As the clouds rise, their temperatures cool.\n\nCooler temperatures combined with higher relative humidity creates the possibility of rain. Rain often dumping huge quantities of water in a very short time. These monsoon rains are very concentrated. One can drive from rain to no rain within a few blocks.\n\nThese “cloud bursts” will also be accompanied by strong winds, lightning and flash flooding. Flash flooding occurs as the rain comes off the mountains and collects in washes in the foothills of the mountains. As the water accumulates, it becomes deeper and moves faster. Real Fast!\n\nAlways observe the signs that says “Do Not Enter When Flooded”!\n\nTucson AZ Events, Attractions And Things To Do\n\nThe City Of Tucson offers an incredible array of things to do.\n\nPlaces to dine, annual events, entertainment, sports and, yes, shopping.\n\nThe weather in Tucson AZ means outdoor activities take place the year around.
