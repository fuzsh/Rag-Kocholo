        "text": "Lucy’s Warbler\n\nLeiothlypis luciae\n\nChipe de rabadilla rufa\n\nTiny Lucy’s is the only warbler that migrates to the Desert Southwest each spring to breed and unlike most warblers, these birds are cavity nesters, using abandoned woodpecker holes or openings beneath peeling mesquite bark. To help this declining species, in 2019 Tohono Chul became a test site for Tucson Audubon’s Lucy’s Nestboxes project. Learn more on their website here.\n\nb/w illustration attribution – photo by Budgora\n\nphoto attribution – Henry T McLin\n\nsound attribution – Scott Olmstead\n\nWho cannot be mesmerized by the majesty of this bird? . . . there is something mysterious and wise about it so that no matter how many times I see it, I continue to be awed and delighted when it presents itself, whether I hear its hoot in the night or see it roosting in a tree in the daytime. I had the privilege of having one roost in a tree in my neighbor’s backyard for about two weeks. Every afternoon as the sun got close to setting, it would begin to move. It would stretch one leg, then one wing, then the other leg and other wing – just like it was getting ready for a night of flight and hunting. The stretching and waking up activity would last for about an hour, and sometimes he would move out of the tree to stand on a wall or tall post. But each night just after the sun had set and it was growing dark, it would take off in flight. Even when I saw it for several days in a row, I continued to be fascinated and looked forward to the next afternoon when I could see it again.\n\n– Docent/Birder Carol Massanari\n\nHouse Finch\n\nHaemorhous mexicanus\n\nPinzon mexicano\n\nNative to the Southwest, House Finches, known as Hollywood Finches, were illegally sold in pet shops on the East Coast at the beginning of the last century. In 1940 shop owners released them to avoid prosecution and within 50 years these plucky birds had reunited with their western cousins in the middle of America.\n\n“I always thought of this bird as too “common,” but because it is everywhere, it is easy to hear it cheerfully singing in almost any backyard. It is such a cheerful song that it cannot help but make one smile.” – Carol Massanari\n\nb/w illustration attribution – Debbie Jensen\n\nphoto attribution – Jen Goellnitz\n\nsound attribution – Paul Marvin\n\nBlack-tailed Gnatcatcher\n\nPolioptila melanura\n\nPerlita del Desierto\n\nCommon throughout the Sonoran Desert year, Black-tailed Gnatcatcher is an active little bird. Foraging for small insects in shrubs and scrub growth, breeding pairs generally remaining together all year. It is worth noting, these Gnatcatchers usually nest only in native vegetation, avoid areas of introduced plants and are much less common in urban areas than in undeveloped spaces.\n\n“Black-tailed Gnatcatcher – This little bird is often hard to actually see because it flits around so much, but it is easily heard. And it’s distinctive raspy, almost a hiss, sound makes it easy to distinguish from other birds. “- Carol Massanari\n\nb/w illustration attribution – Debbie Jensen\n\nphoto attribution – Terry Sohl\n\nsound attribution – Scott Olmstead\n\nBell’s Vireo\n\nVireo bellii\n\nVireo de Bell\n\nJohn James Audubon was the first to describe Bell’s Vireo in 1843, calling it a “greenlet.” The variant species seen in southern Arizona is gray-brown with indistinct wing bars and only a suggestion of yellow along the flank – no green at all. Often heard before it is seen, the Vireo’s song asks and answers – tweedle, deedle, dee? tweedle, deedle, dum.\n\n“Bell’s Vireo – you know summer is close when you hear this bird. I did not know what I was hearing for a long time but when I heard this bird singing, it made me think of the House Wrens I loved hearing all summer when I lived back East. It is a different song, but it sings incessantly and always makes me smile.” – Carol Massanari\n\nb/w illustration attribution – Clark Miller\n\nphoto attribution – Erin and Lance Willett\n\nsound attribution – Scott Olmstead\n\nHarris’s Hawk\n\nParabuteo unicinctus\n\nAguililla de Harris\n\nYou will never forget the sight – a single Harris’s Hawk is perched on a saguaro or telephone pole and one or more additional birds will fly in and stand on its back. It’s called “stacking” and it may be a way to get a better look around. Or, they just want its perch! These very social raptors hunt cooperatively as well, several waiting on the backside of a bush as another flushes their prey.\n\nb/w illustration attribution – Debbie Jensen\n\nphoto attribution – Guy Dallaire\n\nsound attribution – Robin Carter\n\nTurkey Vulture\n\nCathartes aura\n\nZopilote Aura\n\nOne of the few birds with a sense of smell, Turkey Vultures are summer visitors to our area. As the surrounding air warms each morning, you may spot a “kettle” of Vultures taking advantage of rising air currents to ride the thermals high into the sky, soaring with wings held in a “V” shape. As for the reddish, bald head, an absence of feathers means a head that is easier to keep clean after dining on carrion.\n\n“Turkey Vulture – the beauty of this bird is in its soaring. It is easily identified by the way it catches the air waves and soars for long periods of time without a flap of the wing. It is easily distinguished from the ground by the two tones of its underwing – the upper part of the wing being dark (black) and the lower part of the wing appearing more silver or grey in color.” – Carol Massanari\n\nb/w illustration attribution – Debbie Jensen\n\nphoto attribution – unknown\n\nsound attribution – Andrew Spenser\n\nWestern Screech-Owl\n\nMegascops kennicottii\n\nTecolote Occidental\n\nFollowing the bouncing call! The cascading hoots of a Western Screech-Owl sounds like a bouncing ball. Small owls (less than 10” tall), Screech-Owls are opportunistic carnivores eating a variety of desert creatures from invertebrates to birds to mice and even bats, which they will catch on the wing. Cavity nesters, they will occupy abandoned saguaro holes or an appropriate nest box in your backyard.\n\n“I remember Tucson Audubon installing a nest box with the hope of attracting a Kestrel. Part of why that location was chosen was the excellent shade provided by the mesquite protecting it from harsh eastern sun exposure. Well, as they say, the best laid plans . . . The mesquite collapsed shortly after we put up the box removing all shade protection for any potential bird to be attracted to. I figured, well those are the breaks and we can forget about any bird finding that box appealing. But lo and behold a Western Screech-Owl starting roosting in the box. Unexpected and not our original target bird, but that just reinforced the beauty of the unexpected and unpredictable aspect of nature. If you think you can predict outcomes, you’ll be humbled by what nature has in store. It doesn’t care about your expectations. And that’s wonderful and something that keeps us coming back for more.” – Ray Deeney\n\nb/w illustration attribution – Debbie Jensen\n\nphoto attribution – Bryant Olsen\n\nsound attribution – Scott Olmstead"
