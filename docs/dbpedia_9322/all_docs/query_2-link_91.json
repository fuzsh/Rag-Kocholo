        "text": "In 1863, a bill passed the U.S. Senate officially organizing the Arizona Territory, and on February 24, President Abraham Lincoln signed it into law, naming Prescott as the capital. Tucson was stiffed for supporting the Confederacy. In itâ€™s original configuration, part of Nevada (where Las Vegas is today) was part of Arizona. In 1866, that northwest section was annexed to Nevada, and Tucson got the capital back, but then lost if for good in 1889 because it had too many Spanish speakers according to blatant racists who still hold high\n\noffice all these years later.\n\nhttps://truewestmagazine.com/fighting-editors-territorial-arizona/"
