        "text": "Before you start your adventure, be sure to visit our Southern Arizona Heritage and Visitor Center. You can’t miss us – we’re located in downtown Tucson, inside the Historic Pima County Courthouse at 115 N. Church Ave., Tucson, AZ 85701. Call toll-free: (800) 638-8350 or go to visitsouthernarizona.com/. Hours: Daily 10 a.m. - 5 p.m. Closed on these holidays: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Day, Presidents' Day, Easter Sunday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day. The visitor center includes various exhibits, a theater, gallery and other neat features designed to introduce you to new places and provide inspiration to guide your journey.\n\nWILDCAT PARENTS & VISITORS\n\nParents and visitors, consider yourself part of the extended family. Get to know the ins and outs of being a Wildcat – up close and personal with these online visitor information links.\n\nNo Code: We love casual cool, but you might want to pack a fancier outfit or two for upscale dining adventures or excursions at museums and galleries. Most of the time, you’ll be quite comfortable in the non-summer months in light pants and a shirt of some kind. A hat is a very good idea year-round.\n\nFall/Winter/Spring: Layers are advisable, as there can be a wide gulf between daytime highs and overnight lows. (You might feel all four seasons in a single February day here.) Winter may require something a bit heavier after dark. And if you want to strut your Western wear, that’s okay, too!\n\nSummer: The daytime highs consistently rise over 100 degrees F (32C). We suggest breathable long-sleeved clothing, along with hats, sunglasses, and sunblock. In general, limit outdoor activities that time of year to very early (before 7 a.m.), or after sundown (around 8 p.m.).\n\nAlways Carry Water: This is the Sonoran Desert, with Tucson sitting at an altitude of 2,643 feet (806m) above sea level. It may require a bit of an adjustment depending on where you’re coming from.\n\nTucson, with more than 340 days of sunshine a year, is primarily a dry climate, thanks to our location in the middle of the desert. Our monsoon rainy season stretches from mid-July through mid-September, producing epic thunderstorms and microbursts. Most of the year we’ve got plenty of sunshine and opportunities to explore the desert or hang out by the pool.\n\nAverage Tucson high and low temperatures by month, plus rainfall and more.\n\nAverage Weather In Tucson\n\nThe city of Tucson is 2,389 feet above sea level and covers nearly 500 square miles. The landscape is varied and includes flowering desert, rolling hills, winding dry riverbeds, rugged canyons and pine-topped peaks, all beneath a clear, blue sky. Scenery on the 90-minute drive from downtown Tucson to the top of the highest mountain peak in the Santa Catalina Mountains, Mt. Lemmon, is like what you'd see on a trip from Mexico to Canada. Sentinel Peak (also called \"A\" Mountain) is on the western fringe of the downtown historic district. The base of this peak is the site of a major archaeological dig for remnants of Tucson's earliest settlement, about 4,000 years ago.\n\nThe name Tucson itself comes from the Hohokam words “chuk shon,” roughly translating to ‘at the foot of the black mountain’, referring to dwellings by Native Americans that have called this area home for more than 4,000 years. That makes this one of the oldest continually inhabited areas in North America! The modern era of Tucson’s history began on August 20, 1775, with the founding of Presidio San Agustin del Tucson by Spanish settlers who first arrived in the late 1600s, having built Mission San Xavier del Bac.\n\nThe Tucson Region & History"
