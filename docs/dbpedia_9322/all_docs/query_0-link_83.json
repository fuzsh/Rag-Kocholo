        "text": "The communities of Green Valley and Sahuarita are located in the historic Santa Cruz River Valley, nestled between the Santa Rita Mountains to the east and the Tumacacori Mountains to the west.\n\nThe area has a rich history from the early ninth century Hohokam farming villages to the expeditions of Jesuit Padre Francisco Kino (1692) and Col. Juan Bautista de Anza (1775) who went on to colonize what would become the Port of San Francisco. The Arizona Territory was recognized by the United State in 1856 with \"Saurita\" first appearing on a map in 1879. Originally developed as an underground mine in 1907, the Sierrita open pit copper mine has been in operation since 1959 and is a copper and molybdenum mining complex. Over the last 100 years cotton, guayule plants (for rubber) and now Farmers Investment Co. with their 6,000 acres of pecan trees have made up large scale agriculture operations. In 1964 the first construction of \"apartments\" by Maxon Construction Company brought Green Valley to life. Sahuarita's incorporation in 1994 brings us where we are today.\n\nGreen Valley is an unincorporated community located in Pima County, AZ. Green Valley was founded in in 1964 and occupies part of the vast (46,697) acres of the San Ignacio de las Canoa Land Grant which was given to New Spain by the Spanish Crown in the 16th century. It is now a vibrant retirement community and gateway to historic southern Arizona located south of Tucson on Interstate 19.\n\nFor more recent history the Titan Missile Museum, a national historic landmark site, is located in Sahuarita, just off the interstate 19 at Duval Mine Road. A relic of the Cold War, this is the last remaining of the 54 Titan II sites that were on alert across the US from 1963 to 1987.\n\nContinental (a small community south of Green Valley) was a location of President Wilsonâ€™s guayule project. Guayule is a plant that produces latex. Its growth was encouraged in response that the Germans would overtake the rubber market during the first world war.\n\nGreen Valley is close enough to Tucson if you need the big city but far enough away for the quiet solitude and a great lifestyle a retirement community likes. Great weather for year round outdoor activities, shopping, restaurants and all the healthcare options you need are here in Green Valley!"
