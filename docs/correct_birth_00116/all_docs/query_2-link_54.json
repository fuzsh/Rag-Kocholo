        "text": "In January 1951, Dick took a significant step by enlisting in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War. After completing boot camp, he specialized in Medical Corps training, which led him to serve at military hospitals in San Diego, California, and Honolulu, Hawaii. His four years of service, culminating in an honorable discharge on October 14, 1954, were a testament to his commitment and resilience.\n\nPost-military life saw Dick enroll at the University of Utah, where he received his Bachelor's Degree in Microbiology. It was here that he met Flora May Heaton, who would become his eternal companion. The couple married in the Logan Temple on March 20, 1959. This union marked the beginning of a journey filled with challenges and triumphs.\n\nDick pursued his education at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, University of the Pacific in San Francisco, California. Despite the challenges of balancing studies and a growing family of four children, he graduated in 1964 with a Doctorate of Dental Science and further honed his skills with three additional years of preceptorship in orthodontics.\n\nDick's professional life as an orthodontist spanned 35 years in Brigham City and Smithfield, Utah. His career was more than a job; it was a calling that brought smiles to many. He retired in 1997 to dedicate his time to mission work with his wife, as well as to temple and family history work, a true passion.\n\nA father of six – Nathan H. (married to Ruth), Clayton L. (Sandra), LeeAnn Ruth (Roger), Daniel Beebe (Debbie), Matthew Christian (Jeri), and Rebekah Amy (Craig) – Dick was a family man at heart. His legacy extends to 26 grandchildren and 27 great-grandchildren, who knew him as a \"Gentle Giant.\" This label aptly describes a man who was gentle in character yet a giant in strength and determination, especially in living the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nAside from his family and professional commitments, Dick was an avid reader, and is remembered for his love for the works of Louis L'Amour. At home he was remembered for his cheery countenance. His children fondly remember waking up to the sound of \"Oh What a Beautiful Morning\", a tradition that epitomized his joyous approach to life.\n\nDick Cheney's journey ended on November 11, 2023, leaving behind a legacy of love, service, and faith. His life was an example of dedication to country, family, and faith. His memory will continue to inspire those who were fortunate enough to know him and to be touched by his gentle, yet giant, presence."
