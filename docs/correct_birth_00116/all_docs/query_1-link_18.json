        "text": "Sumner, Dawson County Nebraska\n\nPopulation 238\n\nStop #47\n\nPeak popluation in 1920 of 345. The town was named in honor of Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, who advocated the abolition of slavery. He was also a member of Abe Lincoln's cabinet.\n\nMark your calender for Sumner's 4th of July celebration. The town grows to nearly 1500!\n\nVice President Dick Cheney's grandparents lived in Sumner. Cheney spent many summer days visiting his family. Folks in Sumner tells us they pronounced the name 'chee-knee'.\n\nLocal folklore states that Jesse James once rode through town and hid out in some caves north of town.\n\nCheck out Tub's Pub for some great eating! No reservations! Matt Schick recommends the chicken fried steak.\n\nA couple years ago, some men in town re-created an old Sod House. It sits in the town park and inside features antiques and memoribilla.\n\nThe town also raised money to re-build an old landmark- the swinging bridge.\n\nDon't forget to see the mural painted on the side of a building on main street. The artists hoped it would last for at least 10 years. Fifteen years later, it still looks great!\n\nPatsy Rader welcomes artists to visit her craft shop across from the school. It's housed in a barn built as a school project. She holds craft classes and has many products for sale.\n\nCongrats to SEM basketball teams for all their success.\n\nOn one day Sumner had a set of triplets and twins born! (at Good Sam in Kearney)"
