        "text": "Richard Bruce Cheney (born January 30, 1941), also known as Dick Cheney, is an American politician and businessman who was the 46th Vice President of the United States from 2001 to 2009, under President George W. Bush.\n\nCheney was born on January 30, 1941 in Lincoln, Nebraska, as the son of Richard Herbert Cheney and Marjorie Lorraine Dickey. He was primarily raised in Sumner, Nebraska, and Casper, Wyoming. He attended Yale University, then the University of Wyoming, where he earned a BA and an MA in Political Science. He began his political career as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger, eventually working his way into the White House during the Nixon and Ford administrations, where he later served as the White House Chief of Staff, from 1975 to 1977. In 1978, Cheney was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Wyoming's At-large congressional district from 1979 to 1989; he was re-elected five times, briefly serving as House Minority Whip in 1989. Cheney was selected to be the Secretary of Defense during the presidency of George H. W. Bush, holding the position for the majority of Bush's term from 1989 to 1993. During his time in the Department of Defense, Cheney oversaw the 1991 Operation Desert Storm, among other actions. Out of office during the Clinton administration, Cheney was the Chairman and CEO of Halliburton Company from 1995 to 2000.\n\nIn July 2000, Cheney was chosen by presumptive Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush as his running mate in the 2000 presidential election. They defeated their Democratic opponents, incumbent President Al Gore and Senator Joe Lieberman. In 2004, Cheney was re-elected to his second term as Vice President, defeating Senator John Kerry's running mate, Senator John Edwards. During Cheney's tenure as Vice President, he played a lead behind-the-scenes role in Bush administration's response to the September 11 attacks and coordination of the global War on Terror. He was an early proponent of the 2003 Iraq War and defender of the administration's record on terrorism. He became at odds with the views of President Bush for his support of gay marriage in 2004. He left the position of Vice President in January 2009 with the inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n\nFamily[]\n\nCheney married Lynne Vincent in 1964, his high school sweetheart, whom he had met at age 14."
