        "text": "(born 1941). A leading conservative figure in the United States Republican party, Dick Cheney was the 46th vice president of the United States, serving from 2001 with Republican President George W. Bush. Prior to his vice presidency, Cheney had filled positions in three separate presidential administrations. Cheney’s long history of public service, most notably as United States secretary of defense during the Persian Gulf War, helped him to emerge as the Republican party nominee for the vice presidency in the 2000 presidential election. Bush and Cheney won election in 2000 and reelection in 2004.\n\nRichard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Neb., on Jan. 30, 1941. His father, an official in the United States Department of Agriculture, moved his family from Nebraska to Casper, Wyo. As a boy, Dick Cheney excelled in sports and developed a lifelong passion for hunting and fishing. An excellent student, he received a scholarship to attend Yale University in 1959 but left before completing his second year.\n\nAfter resuming his studies at the University of Wyoming, Cheney received a bachelor’s degree in 1965 and a master’s degree in political science the following year. He then enrolled in a doctoral program in political science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he gained his first political experience working as an aide to Wisconsin Governor Warren Knowles. Cheney left graduate school in 1968 to accept a full-time position in Washington on the staff of William Steiger, a Republican congressman from Wisconsin.\n\nIn Washington, Cheney quickly earned a reputation as a bright and hard-working political aide. In 1969 he received a position as an aide to Representative Donald Rumsfeld of Illinois, and he later served as Rumsfeld’s special assistant in the Office of Economic Opportunity. The position marked the first of several posts held by Cheney during the last years of the Richard Nixon Administration. Cheney left the administration in 1973 to accept a post in the private sector as a vice president of the Bradley, Woods and Company investment bank.\n\nCheney returned to public office in 1974, serving as deputy assistant to President Gerald Ford. The following year Ford appointed the 34-year-old Cheney his chief of staff, making Cheney one of the youngest people ever to hold that post. When Ford lost the 1976 presidential election to Jimmy Carter, Cheney returned home to Wyoming and resolved to run for Congress on the Republican ticket.\n\nIn the general election of 1978, Cheney was elected to the first of his six consecutive terms in the House of Representatives. As a member of the House, Cheney earned a reputation as one of the most conservative members of Congress. On domestic issues, he supported balancing the federal budget and slashing government spending for a variety of social programs. Additionally, he opposed all measures to restrict the availability of firearms, supported restrictions on the availability of abortions, and opposed federal busing programs designed to integrate public schools. In foreign affairs, Cheney consistently backed sharp increases in military spending, supported the production of chemical weapons, and backed the deployment of advanced intercontinental nuclear missiles. Cheney also strongly supported the creation of the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly referred to as the “Star Wars” missile-defense system. Fearful of alleged Soviet influence in the Western Hemisphere, Cheney vehemently supported funding anti-Communist forces in Nicaragua and elsewhere in Latin America.\n\nCheney gained a reputation as a tough but even-handed negotiator and quickly rose through the ranks of the Republican Congressional leadership. In only his second term, he became the fourth-highest-ranking Republican congressman when he was elected chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee. In 1988 Cheney became the second most powerful House Republican when he was elected party whip, in charge of maintaining discipline within the party.\n\nIn 1989 President George Bush nominated Cheney to become secretary of defense after the Senate rejected Bush’s initial choice for the post, Senator John Tower of Texas. Widely regarded as one of the leading experts on defense issues in the House of Representatives, Cheney easily won confirmation. As secretary of defense, Cheney oversaw the 1989 U.S. military operation that toppled Panamanian dictator Gen. Manuel Noriega. Cheney received his highest praise for his leadership role during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Cheney played a pivotal role in shoring up support for military intervention among U.S. allies, and he successfully helped to hold together a shaky alliance of rival factions throughout the Middle East during the course of the brief and successful war.\n\nFollowing the defeat of President Bush in the 1992 general election, Cheney returned to private life, becoming a successful chief executive for Halliburton Company, a petroleum services and construction company based in Texas. After eight years away from public service, Cheney was appointed to head the search committee for a vice presidential running mate for Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush. Cheney made a surprising return to the public sphere when he himself became the vice presidential candidate. With the narrow and highly contentious Republican victory over the Democratic ticket of Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph Lieberman in November 2000, Cheney assumed the vice presidency in January 2001. In the 2004 presidential elections, Bush again chose Cheney as his vice presidential running mate. The two were reelected by a small majority.\n\nCheney held great sway as vice president, especially in helping to craft the Bush Administration’s policies on energy and the Middle East. In 2002 the General Accounting Office (GAO) of the United States Congress sued him for refusing to disclose records of a task force he headed about the national energy policy. Cheney also played a central, controversial role in conveying intelligence reports that Saddam Hussein of Iraq had developed weapons of mass destruction in violation of resolutions passed by the United Nations. The administration used these reports to justify an invasion of Iraq in 2003. After the United States toppled the Iraqi government, the U.S. government awarded Halliburton, Cheney’s former company, profitable contracts for reconstruction work in Iraq. Critics questioned whether these no-bid contracts were the result of favoritism.\n\nIn 1964 Dick Cheney married Lynne Anne Vincent, who would later serve as the chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Dick and Lynne Cheney had two daughters, Elizabeth and Mary."
