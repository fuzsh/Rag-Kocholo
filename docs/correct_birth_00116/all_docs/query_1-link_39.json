        "text": "Governor George W. Bush Remarks:\n\nI believe you are looking at the next Vice President of the United States.\n\nThroughout this vice presidential selection process, my foremost goal has been to select an outstanding individual who is capable of serving as President of the United States.\n\nI wanted the selection process to be thorough and dignified. I reached out to a distinguished and experienced statesman to lead the search. For months, we worked closely together to review the qualifications of many impressive candidates.\n\nAs we worked to evaluate the strengths of others, I saw firsthand Dick Cheneys outstanding judgment. As we considered many different credentials, I benefited from his keen insight.\n\nI was impressed by the thoughtful and thorough way he approached his mission. And gradually, I realized that the person who was best qualified to be my vice presidential nominee was working by my side.\n\nBefore I asked Dick Cheney to chair the selection process, I had asked whether he would consider being a candidate himself. At the time, he said no. He had a challenging and demanding job leading a worldwide company; he was enjoying life in the private sector. But I kept the thought of him joining me in the back of my mind.\n\nWhen Secretary Cheney visited me in Crawford over the July 4th weekend, we reviewed many different candidates, all of whom are impressive. But I continued to believe the best candidate might be sitting next to me. I asked him again whether he would be willing to join me to accomplish some great goals for our country: to save and strengthen social security, to improve medicare and provide prescription drug benefits to seniors, to reform our public schools and to rebuild our military. This time he said he was willing to talk with his family and consider it.\n\nEarly this morning, I called and asked him to join me in renewing Americas purpose, together. So I am proud to announce that Dick Cheney, a man of great integrity and judgment and experience, is my choice to be the next Vice President of the United States. I cant wait for the delegates at our convention next week to hear from Dick Cheney and I will ask them to confirm this good man as our partys choice for Vice-President.\n\nThe fact that this outstanding man is willing to serve speaks to the power of our compassionate conservative message and its promise for our country.\n\nI have to admit: I didnt pick Dick Cheney because of Wyomings three electoral votes  although we want and will work hard to earn them. I picked him because he is without a doubt fully capable of being President of the United States and he will be a valuable partner in a Bush administration.\n\nDick Cheney has served our country as chief of staff to a President, served in the United States Congress and as Secretary of Defense. He is a man of integrity who is respected by Republicans and Democrats alike. Even my opponent, Vice President Gore, once said Dick Cheney is a good man who is well liked and respected by his colleagues. I am proud to call him my friend, and honored to call him my running mate.\n\nI also want to welcome Lynne Cheney. She is woman of many accomplishments. She served as chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities and she is a leader in developing high standards and sound curriculum for public schools. She is an important member of our team.\n\nLaura and I are delighted to have Dick and Lynne by our side. And we look forward to winning and working for a better America.\n\nBiography of Richard Cheney\n\nOn July 25, 2000, Secretary Richard B. Cheney, current Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Halliburton Company, was asked by the Republican nominee for President, George W. Bush, to serve as his Vice Presidential running mate. Secretary Cheney has had a distinguished career as a businessman and public servant, serving under three presidents, and as an elected official. Throughout his service, Secretary Cheney served with duty, honor and unwavering leadership.\n\nSecretary Cheney grew up in Casper, Wyoming and was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, on January 30, 1941. He earned BA and MA degrees from the University of Wyoming.\n\nHis career in public service began in 1969 when he joined the Nixon Administration, serving in a number of positions at the Cost of Living Council, the Office of Economic Opportunity, and within the White House.\n\nWhen Gerald Ford assumed the Presidency in August 1974, Mr. Cheney served on the transition team and later as Deputy Assistant to the President. In November 1975, he was named Assistant to the President and White House Chief of Staff, a position he held throughout the remainder of the Ford Administration.\n\nAfter he returned to his home state of Wyoming in 1977, Mr. Cheney was elected to serve as the states sole Congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was re-elected five times and elected by his colleagues to serve as Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 1981-1987. He was elected Chairman of the House Republican Conference in 1987 and elected House Minority Whip in 1988. During his tenure in the House, Secretary Cheney earned a reputation as a man of knowledge, character and accessibility.\n\nCheney also served a crucial role when America needed him most. As Secretary of Defense from March 1989 to January 1993, Mr. Cheney directed two of the largest military campaigns in recent history  Operation Just Cause in Panama and Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. He was responsible for shaping the future of the U.S. military in an age of profound and rapid change as the Cold War ended. For his leadership in the Gulf War, Secretary Cheney was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George Bush on July 3, 1991.\n\nSecretary Cheney married his high school sweetheart, Lynne Ann Vincent, in 1964. Lynne Cheney, is a distinguished public servant in her own right, having served as chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities. She is also a leader in developing high standards and sound curriculum for public schools. Mrs. Cheney was born in Casper, Wyoming. Secretary and Mrs. Cheney have two children, daughters Liz and Mary.\n\nSecretary Cheney is a Methodist and has served on the board of various charitable, business, and civic organizations including serving as National Fund Raising Co-Chair for the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation."
