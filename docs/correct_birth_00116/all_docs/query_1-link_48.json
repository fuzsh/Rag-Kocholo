        "text": "He reigns, in the popular liberal imagination, as the Lord Voldemort of the world stage: he whose location m ust not be named, a dark, didactic, unyielding presence who shoots first and asks questions later, and who answers to no one, not even the president he supposedly serves.\n\nBut there is a dwindling corps of old Washington hands who remember when Dick Cheney was not the Dark Lord, but the bright young wizard from Wyoming who ran the Ford White House at age 34, the youngest presidential chief of staff in American history. They remember when the curled-lip expression now assumed to be a malevolent sneer was only a lopsided smile.\n\nIt turns out that Dick Cheney remembers, too. On a morning not long ago, the vice president, whose relations with most Washington reporters are now so corrosive that he actually banned The New York Times from Air Force Two for the duration of the 2004 presidential campaign, was reminiscing about the *Times’*s Ford-era White House correspondent, James Naughton, in his day the mainstream media’s merriest prankster.\n\nIn the 1976 campaign, it was Naughton who appeared at an impromptu presidential press conference in the feathery yellow head of the San Diego Chicken sports mascot; who put a live sheep in a colleague’s hotel room with Cheney’s connivance; who sent out phony telegrams to his brethren on the bus, telling them they had just been chosen by the League of Women Voters to ask questions at the next televised presidential debate. And on the morning after the election, it was Cheney who helped reporters pay him back.\n\n“They recruited me to get Naughton for all that he’d done to the others in the press corps,” Cheney tells me in his West Wing office, his whole bearing suddenly softening as he rubs his palms together and warms to the tale. “So we basically made an arrangement that I would call Naughton and tell him that President Ford had decided to give one exclusive interview on what it was like to lose the presidency, and he wasn’t going to talk to anybody else. It was going to be Jim. And if he could be up at Camp David the next Saturday morning at eight, we’d let him into the gate, and he’d be able to do it. So he bit, hook, line, and sinker.\n\n“He got ahold of George Tames,” the *Times’*s most famous photographer, “flew him in from Florida. He was so worried about missing the date and the time that they went up and spent the night before at the Cozy motel in Thurmont, Maryland. And, of course, showed up at the gate on Saturday morning to do an interview with the president and discovered when they got there that nobody knew anything about the interview, and the president wasn’t even at Camp David. He was already headed for Palm Springs, California. And when Naughton called in—of course, he called my office down here—I was there, and he knew he’d been had.\n\n“But the kicker on it all was a couple of years later when I was in Wyoming, running for Congress in my first campaign, and I had a heart attack in Cheyenne. And I was in the hospital … lying there with tubes in every part of my body. I was 37 years old. I’d just had a heart attack. My future is passing before my eyes. Can I keep up my campaign? Am I going to have to give up the run for Congress and so forth. And Lynne walked in with a telegram, laughing. I looked at her. ‘What’s so funny? This is not the situation’ … and she handed me the telegram, and it said, ‘Dear Dick, I didn’t do it,’ signed Naughton.”\n\nNaughton’s memories of the old days are just as fond. But when I call him a few hours after my talk with the vice president, he wants to know, “Does he acknowledge that he is not as pleasant as he used to be?”\n\nA former executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, who oversaw work that won 10 Pulitzer Prizes, Naughton all but sighs in search of an explanation. “I guess I would like to believe,” he says, “without any evidence to support it, that coming very close to death has somehow compelled him to act as though he only has so much breath and so much life, that he’s only got so much time to accomplish what he has to do. But the public figure is nothing like the private one that I remember.”\n\nSince 1978, Cheney has suffered four heart attacks and undergone quadruple-bypass surgery, balloon angioplasty, and, in June of 2001, the implantation of a cardiac defibrillator, which includes a pacemaker that monitors every heartbeat and can speed up or slow down the rhythm of his heartbeat as needed. It also has the capability to shock the heart to rescue it from any potentially fatal change in rhythm. He takes a range of medications that he and his doctors decline to detail. The extent of his atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries, which, if it extends beyond the heart to the brain, can cause hard-to-recognize changes in cognition) is unknown. Bypass surgery itself has long been associated with subtle changes in neurological function. At age 65, Cheney is easily 30 or more pounds overweight, seems to have slacked off on what was once a more rigorous diet, and appears to suffer from recurrent bouts of gout. At a roundtable lunch with reporters a couple of years ago, two who were present say, he cut his buffalo steak in bite-size pieces the moment it arrived, then proceeded to salt each side of each piece.\n\nIn November 2004 the Johnston & Murphy shoe store at Tysons Corner in suburban Virginia issued a press release noting that Cheney’s shoe size had changed to 10EEE (in a Lasalle wingtip loafer in brushed mahogany), prompting overwrought speculation that such swollen feet signaled he could be suffering from undisclosed congestive heart failure.\n\nOther theories abound to explain Cheney’s present persona: His 10 years in Congress left him underwhelmed with the quality of that institution and determined to minimize its power, especially in foreign policy. Running the Pentagon for the first President Bush made him a player, not a staffer, and the power went to his head. Running Halliburton, the giant oil-field-services company, made him real money (many million times over) for the first time in his life, and he liked the privacy and comparative lack of BS. Being hustled out of his office by the Secret Service on September 11 to the bunker, then enduring months of life on the lam with a biohazard suit in the backseat of his limousine, confirmed all his worst fears about the dangers of the post–Cold War world.\n\nBut whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes, the conviction that Cheney has become the Grinch who stole Washington is a constant topic among some of those who have known him longest.\n\n“I do happen to know Ford thinks that he has gone too far to the right,” Lou Cannon, the respected Ronald Reagan biographer who covered Ford for The Washington Post, tells me, adding, “I don’t think he’s had any sharp change in views, but I do think something has happened, and I don’t know what that something is.”\n\nPresident Ford himself is more circumspect. “Well,” he tells me by telephone from Rancho Mirage, California, “he may have changed a bit, but that was required for the change of circumstances.” Ford, who will turn 93 in July, adds, “Times change, and people change as a result of that.”\n\nOne important former patron, Brent Scowcroft, who was national-security adviser in both the Ford and first Bush White Houses, and who helped make Cheney secretary of defense in the latter, famously told *The New Yorker’*s Jeffrey Goldberg last fall, “Dick Cheney I don’t know anymore.”\n\nRetired colonel Larry Wilkerson, a longtime top aide to Colin Powell when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Cheney and later secretary of state, has emerged as a scathing critic of the vice president’s handling of everything from postwar planning in Iraq to the prisoner-abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib. But he tells me that what he sees as this administration’s sheer ineptitude does not jibe with his knowledge of Cheney as defense secretary. “I probably have never seen a better executive, a man who could make a decision quicker and, more often than not, make the right decision,” he says. “And a man who could, if he were being led down the primrose path, identify it and throw everybody out of the office and tell, for instance, the chairman, ‘Get your act together and come back when you know what you’re talking about.’ ”\n\nJohn Perry Barlow, the Wyoming native, Internet-privacy advocate, and former Grateful Dead lyricist, who worked on Cheney’s first congressional campaign, is bluntest of all. He e-mails me that Cheney’s “dark intellect has become one of the most dangerous forces in the world; he has become a global sociopath, a creature of enormous power and intellect combined with all the empathy of a HAL 9000 [the murderous computer in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey].”\n\nI n fact, it is hard to reconcile the old Cheney with the new Dick. How did the young aide who, the political consultant Stuart Spencer recalled, was almost “spastic” with anxiety to quickly clarify Gerald Ford’s inadvertent liberation of Poland in a 1976 debate with Jimmy Carter become the grumpy old veep who waited four days to explain to the public (and 36 hours to explain to his increasingly unhappy boss) how he managed to accidentally shoot a 78-year-old quail-hunting companion in Texas in February?\n\nHow did the cool political hand who vanquished a finger-flipping and bullheaded vice president named Nelson Rockefeller, and who hid out at the Republican convention in Detroit in 1980 to avoid being drawn into what he regarded as a ludicrous discussion of a possible “co-presidency” between Ronald Reagan and Jerry Ford, become the most powerful vice president in history, and one who muttered “Fuck yourself” to Senator Patrick Leahy, of Vermont, on the Senate floor?\n\nAlmost 30 years ago, a White House chief of staff suggested one possible answer.\n\n“The problem when you try to put a vice-president in roles, you’re always trying to fit him somehow in staff operations inside the White House,” he said. “And the fact of the matter is you’ve got a different set of criteria for selecting a vice-president than you do staff. And by virtue of the fact that he is a constitutional officer, that he isn’t subject to the same kinds of—that it’s a different relationship, that other staff people oftentimes will defer to him as vice-president, rather than treat him as a staff person and argue and debate with him and so forth. There are just some very basic fundamental problems there in trying to make that work.”\n\nWho was that chief of staff? Dick Cheney, of course.\n\nSo what happened?\n\n“If you’re looking for a change from one point to another, being vice president is sui generis,” Lynne Cheney tells me. “It’s not quite like any other job.”\n\nBut Cheney is not quite like any other vice president. He runs a larger, more active national-security staff than any of his predecessors, and a former senior intelligence official told me that, while Cheney’s initial pre-war visits to ask the C.I.A. about Iraqi W.M.D. seemed supportive, the incessant demands of his staff to find evidence that wasn’t there became “probably a different matter.” His congressional-relations shop is similarly aggressive, and he carries Bush’s water on the toughest issues on Capitol Hill. At one point early in this Bush administration, a former official tells me, Cheney wanted to chair meetings of the National Security Council “principals”—the secretaries of state and defense, the C.I.A. director, and so on—in Bush’s absence, co-opting the usual role of the national-security adviser, then Condoleezza Rice. (He lost.) His influence is still brought to bear on almost every important administration policy, foreign and domestic, even if his most private advice to George W. Bush remains a matter of permanent conjecture.\n\n“Washington is a town that operates on easy myth, on conventional, easy-to-describe archetypes,” says Karl Rove, Bush’s chief political guru. “The vice president’s reality is a lot more complex and a lot more multi-dimensional than what passes for the description of him.”\n\nBut another senior administration aide says, “I’ll tell you what is true and helps create some of the mistruth about him. He can seem very intimidating. He’s such a quiet force.”\n\nHis younger daughter, Mary, tells me, “He has very little tolerance for bullshit, pardon my French.”\n\nIn our interview, Cheney rejects the caricature of him as the power behind the throne and insists, “I think we have created a system that works for this president and for me, in terms of my ability to be able to contribute and participate in the process.”\n\nBut almost five and a half years into this administration, the system isn’t working. In fact, it’s a shambles. I suspect that is part of the reason that I—a 23-year veteran of the newspaper that now chaps Cheney’s hide so much, and a new recruit to a magazine whose editor’s criticisms of the administration are loathed by the vice president’s wife and elder daughter, Elizabeth—found myself in front of the crackling fireplace in his West Wing office one Friday morning in March.\n\nAs we talked, the American invasion of Iraq that Cheney single-mindedly urged had left that country teetering on the brink of a Muslim civil war and had cost American taxpayers more than $250 billion. Republicans in Congress were atypically critical on issues that Cheney had dominated—from the treatment of enemy prisoners to warrantless domestic eavesdropping on suspected terrorists. A February CBS News poll showed Cheney’s favorable rating had slipped to just 18 percent. Even Rupert Murdoch’s normally friendly New York Post had made gleeful sport of his shooting accident, running a large photo of his face superimposed on Elmer Fudd’s cartoon body and a story whose lead paragraph called him “wascally.”\n\nCheney’s colossal unpopularity has hurt the president he signed up to serve, and he knows that people whose judgment he respects think so, even if he disagrees. So he is taking a chance.\n\n[#image: /photos/54cbfcbc932c5f781b3963f4]|||Aboard Air Force Two, Cheney watches President George W. Bush’s press conference of March 21, 2006. Enlarge this photo.|||\n\n“Explain to me what the project is,” he says at the beginning of a promised half-hour talk that will stretch to an hour and 10 minutes, and then to another conversation, aboard Air Force Two, a couple of weeks later. I tell him that I find him about the most interesting person in Washington, and that the cartoon that has prevailed about him cannot be accurate. “You might be worse than that,” I venture. He smiles. I think.\n\nA few minutes later, his entire demeanor the opposite of angry, Cheney says, “My image might be better out there, this caricature you talk about might be avoided, if I spent more time as a public figure trying to improve my image, but that’s not why I’m here.”\n\nI n fact, our talk seemed to be the beginning of a springtime Cheney charm offensive. A few weeks later, at the Radio & Television Correspondents Association’s annual dinner in Washington, he brought down the house in the dim ballroom when he said, “The light could be better,” then added: “But I can still see the whites of your eyes.”\n\nStill, Cheney refused to speak to me on the record on some of the most controversial and interesting topics, like the treatment of enemy prisoners. And he stands out in 21st-century Washington for his resolute refusal even to dip his toe into the confessional politics of the age. Perhaps the best press he has ever received from the national media came during the 2004 campaign when he broke with Bush and supported his younger daughter, Mary, who is gay, by expressing his distaste for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, saying, “Freedom means freedom for everybody.”\n\nIn her poignant and funny memoir, Now It’s My Turn, being published this month by Simon & Schuster’s new, conservative imprint, Threshold Editions, Mary Cheney recounts (in a voice very much like her father’s) how she came out to her parents as a junior in high school, on a day when she skipped school, after breaking up with her first girlfriend, ran a red light, and crashed the family car. Her mother hugged her, but then burst into tears, worried that she would face a life of pain and prejudice. The first words out of her father’s mouth, she writes, “were exactly the ones that I wanted to hear: ‘You’re my daughter, and I love you, and I just want you to be happy.’ ”\n\nAgain and again, the Cheneys’ oldest friends attest to the family’s closeness. John and Mary Kay Turner, longtime pals from Wyoming, showed me a photograph of Cheney and Mary around a campfire at the Turners’ Triangle X Ranch, in Jackson Hole, in which the vice president beams almost unrecognizably. But again and again friends warned me that asking the Cheneys about Mary would get their backs up. When I venture to ask the vice president whether he thinks gay people are born that way, he scrunches up his mouth, fixes me with a look that says, “Nice try,” then answers: “I’m not going to get into that. Those are deeply personal questions. You can ask.” (When I ask if he can remember the longest conversation he ever had with his own father, he smiles as if lost in thought, then says, “That’s private.”)\n\nMary Cheney says that one common reaction from people who have read the manuscript of her book is “ ‘Wow, you guys really have this close-knit, loving family,’ and it always strikes me as ‘Yeah, of course we do.’ It was very surprising to me that people would think we didn’t.”\n\nCheney’s old Wyoming friend former senator Alan Simpson laughs at efforts to psychoanalyze him. “It’s amazing to me how people try to get into his head, and ‘What is happening to Dick Cheney?’ ” he says. “Well, my answer is ‘nothing!’ He’s just the same.”\n\nThere is, in fact, much about the Cheney the world now knows that would be instantly recognizable to anyone who has ever worked with him. In the Ford years, Cheney’s White House communications call sign was “Backseat,” but some reporters called him Grand Teuton, in tribute to his Wyoming roots and unquestioned authority.\n\nJerry Ford liked to say that his post-Watergate White House operated on a “spokes of the wheel” organizational model, with open advice coming in to the president from all quarters. But at Cheney’s going-away party after Ford lost, his staff gave him a bicycle wheel mounted on a piece of plywood, with every spoke between the hub and the rim broken in two, except one.\n\nThen as now, Cheney took an extremely robust view of presidential power, and a near-pathological view of the need for secrecy. He may have played jokes on Jim Naughton, but as the author James Mann notes in Rise of the Vulcans, his groundbreaking 2004 study of the Bush foreign-policy team, Cheney also pondered whether to seek an indictment or a warrant to search the apartment of another Times reporter, Seymour Hersh, after Hersh reported how the C.I.A. in 1975 sought to recover a sunken Soviet submarine with a ship built by Howard Hughes.\n\nIn her first novel (of three), Executive Privilege, published in 1979, Lynne Cheney portrays a president who is willing to lie about having undergone past psychiatric treatment, in order to preserve the confidentiality of a sensitive foreign-intelligence mission being undertaken by one of his closest aides, who also happens to be a psychiatrist.\n\n“It seems to me that the history of the presidency in the twentieth century is the history of a gradually weakening institution,” President Zern Jenner rails at one point in the book to his pollster. “Think how many presidents have been brought to their knees, even destroyed in this office.… I have a right to confidential meetings with the people who work for me, and I’m not going to undermine it by going over the log with the White House press corps and telling them what’s going on when.”\n\nLynne dedicated the book “To Dick, who has shaped my life—and even one or two of my opinions.” So, Cheney’s secret energy task force should not have come as a surprise.\n\nMore than anything, Cheney’s quiet Joe Friday affect has masked the reality that he is among the most conservative Republicans ever to occupy such senior positions in national life. In his 1980 memoir, Palace Politics, Robert Hartmann, a veteran Ford aide who tangled bitterly with Cheney, wrote that, whenever Cheney’s “private ideology was exposed, he appeared somewhat to the right of Ford, Rumsfeld or, for that matter, Genghis Khan.”\n\nIn the 1980s, when The Washington Post referred to Congressman Cheney as a “moderate,” he told his longtime aide and friend David Gribbin to “tell them I’m a conservative.” Early in his vice-presidency, when Cheney’s counselor Mary Matalin told him that reporters were calling him a hard-liner, he replied, “I am a hard-liner.”\n\nFormer representative Tom Downey, a New York Democrat who liked Cheney and occasionally traveled the lecture circuit with him in the days when congressmen could still keep honoraria, recalls being with him in Red Square, in Moscow, on a beautiful July night in the mid-1980s. “I said, ‘What are your first thoughts, looking up at St. Basil’s Cathedral?’ and he said, ‘Well, I guess we’re at ground zero’ ” of any American nuclear strike. “His attitude toward the Russians was so uncompromisingly hard-line that I could never understand it.… You always got the sense that he felt he knew the truth. It’s interesting that he became a member of Congress, because I think he always thought we were a massive inconvenience to governing.”\n\nCheney’s conservatism is unsentimental. Bill Thomson, a longtime friend and lawyer in Cheyenne, Wyoming, tells me of “an example that stuck in my mind, mostly because I felt about two inches tall when it happened.” Thomson was president of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Wyoming when Cheney was in Congress, and once lobbied Cheney for more federal research money. “He was very patient, and then he said, ‘Bill, I understand what you’re saying.… But at the same time, you’re always saying we need to get the budget of the United States under control. And now you’re asking me to spend x numbers of tens or a hundred million dollars.’ He said, ‘What do you really believe?’ and I thought, Whoops!”\n\nThe 9/11 attacks “played on a personality that was ready to be played on,” says Larry Wilkerson. Cheney and key advisers such as his counsel (now chief of staff) David Addington moved the levers of power to produce a series of legal opinions and executive decisions that got around such old niceties as the Geneva Conventions and federal wiretapping laws and gave the White House new powers to fight a new kind of war, by whatever means necessary.\n\n“There was one air-force guy who worked for Cheney for quite a while, and he says, ‘I like the man,’ but he said, ‘I’d use this word: amoral,’ ” Wilkerson recalls. “And I asked if ‘you understand what you’re saying?’ And he said, ‘Yep, I’m saying he’s Machiavelli’s prince writ large.’ ”\n\nH ow he got the way he is in the first place is the most interesting question. Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1941, on Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 59th birthday, to a proud New Deal Democrat father who spent 37 years as a civil servant with the federal Soil Conservation Service, first in Nebraska and then in Casper, Wyoming, where the family moved when Dick was 13. The elder Richard Cheney’s idea of good conversation on a car trip was one comment every 30 miles or so. When his son first ran for Congress, Richard senior had to register as a Republican so he could vote for Dick in a contested primary, but he “would always say, ‘It’s temporary,’ and that I had to renew the lease every two years,” the vice president recalls.\n\nWhen I ask Cheney how he became such a staunch conservative, he says, “Well, it builds over time, obviously,” and then cites factors ranging from growing up in the West to his distaste for wage and price controls as a young aide to Rumsfeld in the Nixon administration. “In Wyoming, the legislature meets for 40 days every other year—or they did at the time,” he says. “Now they’ve added a 20-day budget session in the off year. That’s it. You got citizen legislators, not professionals. If you’re a farmer, you go down and serve on the agriculture committee because you know something about agriculture. We’ve gotten to the point around here where if you’re a banker, you don’t go on the banking committee because it’s a conflict of interest.”\n\nFifty years ago, Casper was a freewheeling, boom-and-bust town where oil was good (in the 1920s, it had built the million-dollar, collegiate-Gothic Natrona County High School, which Cheney attended) and gas was absolutely necessary. (Cheney’s high-school football coach, Harry Geldien, tells me his teams had to drive as far as Rapid City, South Dakota—325 miles away—to play schools of comparable size.) The nearest first-run movies were in Denver, and every December the public-high-school Christmas pageant rang in the season on an unapologetically “worshipful note,” as one yearbook of the period put it.\n\nThere were bars and gambling and prostitution—all the ancillary industries of an oil town—but also a sense of possibility for a young arrival from Nebraska, who spent his first summer in town reading through the history stacks of the local Carnegie library.\n\n[#image: /photos/54cbfcbc44a199085e894024]|||Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, near Cheney’s weekend home in St. Michaels, Maryland, March 25, 2006. Enlarge this photo.|||\n\nThe arc of Cheney’s public, adult career is by now well known: the internship in the Wyoming Senate; the five Vietnam draft deferments; the doctoral studies in political science at the University of Wisconsin, where he was put off by campus radicalism; the fellowship that took him to Washington as a congressional aide. Then came the job with Don Rumsfeld (for which Cheney was interviewed by a summer intern from the New York Knicks named Bill Bradley). In 1969 Rumsfeld was running the anti-poverty office in the Nixon White House, and it was he who eventually made Cheney deputy chief of staff in the Ford White House. That in turn led to everything else: White House chief of staff in 1975 and 1976; 10 years in Congress, from 1979 to 1989; 4 years as defense secretary under the first President Bush; an exploratory presidential bid that foundered in the mid-1990s; the top job at Halliburton; and his current post.\n\nMuch less well understood is just how far Cheney has come from the world of his boyhood. To stand in front of his parents’ tiny, wood-frame rambler, at 505 Texas Place, on the east side of Casper, is to get a sense of the distance. It is far from the best part of town, then or now. But Cheney’s elder daughter, Liz, a lawyer who is now the principal deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, with four young children of her own (whom Cheney dotes on) and a fifth on the way, recalls it as a happy place, full of family, good food, and fun.\n\n“Some of my fondest memories are of that house,” she tells me. “I never thought of it as a little house.” Dick’s mother, Marjorie, had been a champion softball player in her youth, and it was she who caught his pitches when he was learning to play baseball. She was also, Liz Cheney recalls, a wonderful cook, and until the Secret Service nixed the idea, Dick Cheney remained his family’s frequent grocery shopper and principal cook, whose specialties run to grilled meats, fish, chili, and spaghetti.\n\nIn school, Dick was a standout (president of the senior class, co-captain of the football team) with a thick brush cut and winning smile, but Lynne Anne Vincent was the undisputed star: a sexy, straight-A student, “Mustang Queen” at homecoming (in a campaign promoted by her boyfriend, Dick), and a state-champion baton twirler. Anyone trying to understand how her husband got where he did had better reckon with her.\n\nLynne’s father, Wayne, also worked for the government—for the Bureau of Reclamation—and her mother, the former Edna Loleta Lybyer, was a deputy sheriff. (A non-swimmer, she drowned at age 54 in enigmatic circumstances while walking her dog around a lake outside town one evening in 1973.) Mrs. Vincent’s law-enforcement job was largely clerical, but she carried a badge and “she knew everything there was to know about where we’d gone when we went out at night, what was happening in town,” Cheney tells me. “It didn’t matter what we did or where we went, we were always … Edna always knew.”\n\nThe Cheneys’ high-school friend Joe Meyer, now Wyoming’s Republican secretary of state, tells me with a smile, “You had to be careful” with Edna.\n\nYou had to be careful with Lynne too. “Dick fell in love with a cheerleader for about a week in our senior year,” she says, “so I dated Joe Meyer, who had the best car in high school,” a 1959 Pontiac convertible, “with fins, and it was gold.” Soon Dick saw the light. “It was too much to see me driving through Casper in a gold car with fins.”\n\nLynne went off to Colorado College, where she would graduate summa cum laude, while Dick headed east to Yale on a full scholarship arranged by a local oilman, Thomas Stroock, a classmate of George H. W. Bush’s. But he was not prepared to compete with the preppies and students from big urban high schools, missed Lynne terribly, and was forced to leave not once but twice for bad grades. He wound up back in Wyoming, erecting high-voltage power lines, and twice in the eight months between November 1962 and July 1963 was arrested for drunken driving, once in Cheyenne, once in Rock Springs.\n\nWhen I suggest to Lynne Cheney that this must have been a crushing time for him, she replies quickly, “That’s not a part of the experience I remember at all,” and adds, “I just always thought that the most amazing part was that one day he decided that he needed to straighten himself up, and he did.” A better reflection of both Cheneys’ feelings at the time may be contained in Executive Privilege, in which the fictional First Lady vows that she and her husband will never go back to Montana if he loses the White House, because doing so would re-awaken memories of his early, failed campaigns for the Senate.\n\n“The second time he had run for the Senate and failed,” Mary Jenner remembers in the novel, “the spirit had seemed to drain from him. The loss had robbed him of the spark and special brilliance which she had seen in him from the beginning and which she had known promised greatness.\n\n“She and he had never been given to examining each other’s feelings and motives the way she knew some of their married friends did, and so they hadn’t really talked much about why losing was so traumatic for him. She had supported him in the only way she knew how, by encouraging him to action.”\n\nIn real life, Lynne encouraged Dick to action. He married her in 1964, finished his degree at the University of Wyoming, and within 10 years was deputy White House chief of staff for President Ford.\n\n“One of the interesting things about Dick is that a word that is never used to describe him is ‘ambitious,’ ” says Robin West, an old friend from the Ford days who is now an energy consultant in Washington. “I think he is a deceptive fellow. It’s been a meteoric career.” And, he adds, “never underestimate Lynne.”\n\nWyoming is still a place where top state officeholders’ home numbers are listed in the phone book, but Cheney’s life today is so far from that easy openness that he tells me, “I don’t even think about it.” When he was a congressman, his district covered the whole state, and he tried to get back there at least once a month. He held regular office hours in Cheyenne, in which he would listen to all comers for 10 minutes each, on the second floor of the federal building downtown, without so much as a metal detector between him and his most unwashed constituents.\n\n“There was a fellow here they called ‘Dynamite Lopez,’ ” recalls Ruthann Norris, who was Cheney’s area representative in Cheyenne for virtually his entire time in Congress. “He was one of the ones that came to the office, and he reeked. He’d worked for the railroad, and he got fired, and then he thought the bank was withholding his money, and he walked in there one day and said, ‘I have a stick of dynamite.’ Now, back then, 20 years ago, they said, ‘Oh, well, come on, get out of here,’ and kicked him out. So he came up and would discuss with Dick how people had wronged him. He became almost a fixture every time Dick was in town. But Dick had time for him. For a while it was ‘Mr. Lopez, Mr. Lopez,’ and after a while it was just like the rest of us: ‘Dynamite, I just don’t know what I can do for you.’ ”\n\nThese days, the Secret Service insists for security reasons that the airspace be restricted above Cheney’s official residence, in Washington, at all times, and above his vacation homes when he is in them, including his new, $2.6 million weekend waterfront retreat, on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. But he hasn’t lost a certain sense of humor about his lot.\n\nWhen he gave his friend Robin West and his twin children a ride to the White House a couple of years ago, West commented on the fact that Cheney’s motorcade varied its daily path. “And he said, ‘Yeah, we take different routes so that “The Jackal” can’t get me,’ ” West recalls. “And then there was this big duffel bag in the middle of the backseat, and I said, ‘What’s that? It’s not very roomy in here.’ And he said, ‘No, because it’s a chemical-biological suit,’ and he looked at it and said, ‘Robin, there’s only one. You lose.’ ”\n\nIf much of Cheney’s current reality is shaped by his post-9/11 security, almost as much is shaped by his pre-vice-presidential wealth. When he left the Defense Department, in 1993, he and his son-in-law, Liz’s husband, Philip Perry, now the general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security, drove the family’s furniture cross-country from Washington to Jackson Hole in a rented U-Haul, to the “cluster home” he had bought in the gated Teton Pines community. After he became chairman and C.E.O. of Halliburton, then based in Dallas, he was landing at Jackson Hole in a private jet, and bought a bigger, $3 million home at Teton Pines.\n\nCheney’s stewardship of Halliburton is generally regarded as competent. In the 1990s his prominent stature as a Washington insider brought status and business to the company, just as it would bring unwanted attention and grief after Cheney became vice president. His principal achievement there—the 1998 merger with Dresser Industries, which made it the largest oil-field-services company in the world—later came a cropper over unanticipated asbestos-liability claims. But it was widely regarded as a good business move at the time.\n\nOne thing that is undisputed about Cheney’s tenure at Halliburton: it made him rich. From 1992, his last year as defense secretary, to 1999, his last full year at Halliburton, his annual income went from $258,394 to $4.4 million, and he left in 2000 with an accumulated package of stock, options, and deferred income worth more than $20 million. In the late 1990s he and Lynne also served on corporate boards that made them a total of an estimated $600,000 a year, and she made money from her work as an author and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\nC heney has been coming to Jackson to fish since the early 1950s, before he even moved to Wyoming, and no one will ever accuse him of fancy airs. He keeps in close touch with old friends from high school and quietly shows up for important occasions. But the truth is he now runs with a pretty rich crowd, in a club almost impossible to join if you’re not already a member. No demanding Dynamite Lopezes darken his door.\n\nOne of Cheney’s regular fishing-and-hunting buddies, Dick Scarlett, the chairman of the Jackson State Bank & Trust, shows me photographs of a shooting trip to South Dakota and a tent-camp outing on the South Fork of the Snake River in Idaho that call to mind those sepia-toned pictures of Warren G. Harding camping out with Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Harvey Firestone.\n\nThese are friends who ask no explanations from Cheney, who doesn’t give many. “He holds a lot inside himself,” Scarlett says.\n\nCheney’s most famous outbursts as vice president have tended to revolve around any suggestion that he acquired his late-in-life wealth by other than honorable means or has not shared enough of it. He dropped the F-bomb on Leahy two years ago, after the Democratic senator had insinuated that Halliburton received no-bid contracts in Iraq because of its connections to Cheney, then tried to kid Cheney about his standoffishness. (Cheney has maintained he takes no part as vice president in matters relating to Halliburton, and in 2004 FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan truth squad based at the University of Pennsylvania, said it had found “no credible allegation to the contrary.”)\n\nCheney’s run of bad blood with The New York Times dates to just before Labor Day 2000. Around then, Adam Clymer, then the paper’s Washington correspondent, wrote a story about the release of the Cheneys’ tax returns, noting that they had given just over 1 percent of their income to charity across the preceding 10 years. (Clymer tells me that the story was still rankling Cheney days later when he responded to Bush’s accidental open-mike description of Clymer as a “major-league asshole” by muttering, “He is, big-time.”)\n\nThough under no legal requirement to do so, before he took office, the Cheneys earmarked for charity the proceeds from what turned out to be more than $6.8 million in options in Halliburton and other companies that they were not yet entitled to exercise. They have since given the money to various causes, including $2.7 million to the George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates, whose doctors have taken care of his heart for two decades, to support research and clinical care related to cardiac diseases.\n\nCheney’s generosity to his doctors’ work is basic: he owes them his life. His entire electoral career has unfolded in the shadow of his chronic coronary-artery disease, and he is lucky that advances in medical technology have kept up with him. His condition is a subject of nearly endless speculation in political and medical circles, in part because he has repeatedly declined to say more than the minimum about it.\n\nWhen I ask him what he would have for breakfast at Nora’s Fish Creek Inn, his favorite pre-fishing spot in Wilson, Wyoming, he answers without missing a beat, “I’d probably have two eggs over easy, sausage, and hash browns,” then hastens to say that is not his normal breakfast. “The day I go fishing, I get off my diet,” he says. Asked if he is fatalistic about his illness, he replies, “I am. I don’t even think about it most of the time. You do those things a prudent man would do, and I live with it.”\n\nOf the prevailing caricatures of Cheney, those closest to him say, the most inaccurate one of all is that he is the senior partner who has led George Bush around by the nose. Al Simpson says those who think that are “dumb bastards.” It seems clear that Bush is less dependent on Cheney than he was when he took office, and there are some signs that Cheney’s influence in the bureaucracy has diminished, with the departure or marginalizing of a number of key allies from Bush’s first term, including the former deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz, who now heads the World Bank.\n\n“Maybe you could say that his political antennae aren’t up as high as they would be if he were running for president himself,” the former White House chief of staff Andrew Card acknowledges.\n\nThis spring, the Beltway gossip about Cheney’s future has embraced polar extremes: he will resign for reasons of health after this year’s midterm elections, or he will break his vow and run for president in 2008, in the name of protecting national security from Hillary Clinton and a weak Republican field. *The Washington Post’*s Bob Woodward, for whom Cheney has long been assumed to be an important source, has been perhaps the leading exponent of the latter theory.\n\nCheney’s old friends dismiss that idea outright. “Would you vote for someone who’d had four heart attacks?” Dave Gribbin asks me.\n\nBut Cheney has taken jobs he said he did not want in the past. When John Tower’s nomination to be the first President Bush’s secretary of defense was collapsing in 1989 over reports of his drinking and womanizing, Cheney was the logical alternative, but insisted he was not interested.\n\n“The first time he came back to Cheyenne as secretary of defense, he came back in a private plane and he got off and they had a thing out here to welcome him back,” Ruthann Norris recalls. “And I started crying. I don’t know why. So he came up and gave me a hug, and I said, ‘You told me you weren’t ever going to do this!’ And he said, ‘You know, when the president asks you to do something, you do it.’ ”\n\nSo I ask him whether in his “darkest night” he has even “a little doubt” about the administration’s course.\n\n“No,” he says. “I think what we’ve done has been what needed to be done.”\n\nOf the debate over whether the administration hyped pre-war intelligence on Iraq’s weapons, he says: “In the end, you can argue about the quality of the intelligence and so forth, but … I look at that whole spectrum of possibilities and options, and I think we did the right thing.”\n\nHe acknowledges that the task, in Iraq and Afghanistan, has not been simple: “It’s not easy. It’s hard. It’s three yards and a cloud of dust. There are no touchdown passes here that suddenly we might like to see.”\n\nAsked how he could have possibly objected to Senator John McCain’s amendment banning cruel and inhumane treatment of prisoners and detainees in American custody, Cheney declines to answer on the record, because, his aides explain, the issue touches on sensitive, classified matters.\n\nA couple of weeks later, on the way back from a rally for troops at Scott Air Force Base, in Illinois, just after the third anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq, I ask Cheney why so many of his contemporaries think he has changed. “Maybe because of my associations over the years, or because I came across as a reasonable guy, people have one view of me that was not necessarily an accurate reflection of my philosophy or my view of the world.” Then he proceeds to tell a story that makes me think he has changed. Early in his time in Congress, he was invited to join a caucus of moderate-to-liberal House Republicans that met once a week for beer and chips and called itself the Wednesday Group. One of its leaders was the late Barber Conable, an old-school Republican from upstate New York.\n\n“They came and asked me to join, and my initial reaction was ‘No, you guys are all libs and I’m a conservative,’ ” Cheney recalls. “And Conable called me up and said, ‘Come see me.’ So I went to see him, and he said, ‘Dumb move.’ He said, ‘You’re going to know all the conservatives. You need to know those of us of the more liberal persuasion, more moderate persuasion, that it’ll be good for the party in the House, you’ll help tie it together.’ He said, ‘It’ll be good for you, too, because you’ll have a foot in our camp.’ So they welcomed me.”\n\nAsked if he had a foot in any loyal-opposition camp these days, Cheney just shakes his head. Now he is a camp of one, and if he thinks he’s made any dumb moves, he doesn’t let on. His certitude goes far beyond political positioning, even in an administration as loath to acknowledge error as this one. The obvious political thing would be to admit miscalculations, ask forgiveness, and move on. His refusal to second-guess himself springs from some much deeper place, from the howling winds and long winters of Wyoming, the raw memory of youthful flameout, the ambition he has worked so hard to keep hidden, the distance he has come to fight the twilight struggle against global terror. He is content to wait for the judgment of history, daily headlines be damned. His track record is mixed at best. He may have been right to agree to end the first Persian Gulf War and wrong to help start the second. In his zeal to preserve the Pax Americana he grew up enjoying, he may help destroy it, abroad and at home.\n\nIf those possibilities trouble him, we’ll never know. Whatever we think he should be, or would be or could be, a man has to be what he is.\n\nTodd S. Purdum is *Vanity Fair’*s national editor."
