After leaving the White House, Cheney returned to his home state of Wyoming, where he was elected in 1978 as the state’s sole member of the House of Representatives.\n\nEarly in Cheney’s sixth term, in 1989, he was nominated by President George Bush to serve as Secretary of Defense, and was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate. In 1991, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nThrough most of the 1990s, Cheney worked in the private sector as chief executive officer of the Halliburton Company in Dallas, Texas. In 2000, George W. Bush asked Cheney to become his running mate and in August 2000, Cheney became the Republican vice presidential nominee. In the eight eventful years of the Bush presidency, the vice president was best known for his involvement in national security matters following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. President Bush and Vice President Cheney left office in January 2009.\n\nVice President Cheney was born on January 30, 1941 in Lincoln, Nebraska. He and his wife, Lynne V. Cheney, live in Wyoming and have two daughters and seven grandchildren. Vice President Cheney’s memoir, In My Time, was published in 2011. Heart: An American Medical Odyssey, was released in October 22, 2013, an his latest book Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, co-written with his daughter Elizabeth Cheney was released September 1, 2015."
