        "text": "6 days ago\n\nBy Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral , BBC News, Washington\n\nDonald Trump is expected to announce within hours who he has chosen as his Republican running mate.\n\nHis vice-presidential pick will be unveiled on the first day of the Republican party convention in Milwaukee on Monday, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\n\nThere are three names getting a lot of buzz - JD Vance, Doug Burgum and Marco Rubio - and they are reportedly in the final three.\n\nBut there are plenty of others who could spring a surprise.\n\nHere's a rundown.\n\nJD Vance\n\nJD Vance, 39, the junior senator from Ohio, has rallied support for Trump on several occasions in recent months.\n\nThe Yale-educated former venture capitalist wrote the best-selling book Hillbilly Elegy, a memoir that followed his blue-collar upbringing in the \"rust-belt\" Midwest.\n\nOnce a self-identified \"never-Trumper\", Mr Vance refashioned himself when he ran for the Senate in 2022 with Trump's crucial endorsement.\n\nIn office, he has championed many of the issues that animate Trump's base.\n\nMr Vance believes he would be of better use to a future Trump administration in the Senate, but he has not ruled out being vice-president.\n\n\"I want to help him however I can,\" he recently said.\n\nTrump has also dismissed a rumour floating that Mr Vance's beard would disqualify him - as the former president is reportedly averse to facial hair.\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nAnother of Trump's fallen primary opponents, Doug Burgum, 67, is in his second term as governor of North Dakota.\n\nMr Burgum made little impact as a presidential candidate but has returned to the campaign trail with his endorsement of Trump.\n\nA social conservative and fiscal hawk, he said in 2023 that he would never conduct business with Trump because \"you're judged by the company you keep\".\n\nMr Burgum began his career with a small software start-up later acquired by Microsoft and his years of entrepreneurship have earned him a billionaire fortune.\n\nHe is reported to have impressed Trump with his low-drama demeanour and political know-how - attributes that led to the selection of former VP Mike Pence in 2016.\n\nNorth Dakota's near-total abortion ban, which Mr Burgum supported, is \"a little bit of an issue\", Trump said during an interview on Fox News radio.\n\n\"I think Doug is great, but... he's taken a very strong stance,\" he said.\n\nBurgum has said he supports leaving abortion laws up to individual states, and a proposed Republican party platform has dropped a section calling for a nationwide abortion ban. The abortion issue drove Democratic voters to the polls in 2022's midterm elections.\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nTrump and Marco Rubio did not get on in the 2016 Republican primary race. Trump called him \"Little Marco\" - a reference to his stature - while Mr Rubio commented about Trump's small hands.\n\nThe Florida senator has since worked closely with his former rival, endorsing him early on in this primary season.\n\nThe son of working-class Cuban immigrants, Mr Rubio was once floated as a potential running mate to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nAt only 53 he is comparatively young and telegenic, and he could help Trump gain a larger share of the Latino vote.\n\nMr Rubio spoke at a rally for Trump in Florida on Tuesday, and afterwards the presidential candidate said: \"He's very good... Marco was great last night, very popular. And he's certainly one of the people that we're looking at.\"\n\nThe US Constitution could create a small procedural hurdle. It specifies that a state must cast its electoral votes for at least one candidate, president or vice-president who is not a resident of the state. Both Mr Rubio and Trump live in Florida, meaning the 30 electoral votes allocated to that state could be in doubt.\n\nIn practice, the issue could be solved by a large victory for the Republican ticket, or one of the candidates moving out of the Sunshine State. In 2000, Dick Cheney moved his official residence from Texas to Wyoming to become the running mate of another Texan, George W Bush.\n\nTrump has said the issue doesn't rule out Mr Rubio, \"but it does make it more complicated.\"\n\nTim Scott\n\nBeyond the leading trio, there is another group of possible contenders which includes Tim Scott.\n\nThe South Carolina senator is arguably the most prominent black Republican in the country. He was among the competitors Trump defeated in the party's primary contest.\n\nMr Scott, 58, pitched his brand of optimistic conservativism, in a play for the influential evangelical Christian vote in early voting states, but his campaign never caught fire.\n\nAfter struggling to raise money, and three lacklustre debate performances, he exited and quickly endorsed Trump.\n\nIt was his rousing remarks at a Trump campaign rally before the New Hampshire primary that elevated him as a top contender for vice-president.\n\n\"We need Donald Trump,\" he said, before appearing on stage during his fellow Republican's victory speech.\n\nHe told Trump: \"I just love you.\" With a smile, the former president responded: \"That's why you're a great politician.\"\n\nSince then, Trump has often remarked that Mr Scott is \"much better [at advocating] for me than he was for himself\".\n\nByron Donalds\n\nByron Donalds, 45, has helped raise the profile of black conservatism.\n\nBorn in New York to a single mother, Mr Donalds worked in banking, insurance and finance before entering local politics in Florida in 2012.\n\nAfter four years in the Florida House of Representatives, he has served since 2020 in the US House, representing the right-wing flank of his party in Washington.\n\nOn 15 June, Mr Donalds joined Trump at a Michigan campaign event aimed at winning over black voters. The former president openly touted Mr Donalds as a potential running mate.\n\n\"Byron Donalds is an incredible guy, and I noticed he happens to be on the list of potential vice-presidents,\" Trump said. \"Would anyone like to see him as a vice-president?\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, he played coy when asked if he had discussed the job with Trump.\n\n\"Maybe, maybe not,\" Mr Donalds said. \"I'm going to keep that to myself.\"\n\n\"I think President Trump is going to make a great decision,\" the congressman continued. \"Obviously it's his decision, his decision alone.\"\n\nTalk of his joining the ticket has cooled in recent days, however, as US media has reported that Trump's shortlist has narrowed.\n\nElise Stefanik\n\nElise Stefanik, 40, is a New York congresswoman and the highest-ranking Republican woman in the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe once-moderate Trump-hesitant Republican has drifted to the right in recent years, and is now widely considered one of Trump's most loyal defenders on Capitol Hill, even joining his defence at his first impeachment trial in 2020.\n\nIn recent months, she has also risen to modest fame in media circles, with her viral take-down of two Ivy League college presidents and elevation of the issue of antisemitism on US college campuses.\n\nShe has said that she would be \"honoured\" to serve in the Trump administration \"in any capacity\", but she too has not appeared on recent lists of the top contenders.\n\nTulsi Gabbard\n\nAs a Democrat, she was the first Hindu member of the US Congress. Now Tulsi Gabbard may be the biggest dark horse on Trump's list.\n\nA decade ago, the Iraq War veteran and US Army reservist served as vice-chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee - before resigning to endorse Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHer time in Congress, from 2013-21, was marked by frequent criticisms of the Obama administration and US military interventionism.\n\nShe ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with her most notable moment being a fierce critique of Kamala Harris - now the vice-president - over her past as a prosecutor in California.\n\nMs Gabbard, 43, then beefed up her contributions to Fox News and announced in 2022 that she was leaving the Democratic Party. But she would still be a huge surprise if chosen.\n\nKristi Noem\n\nKristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, once topped a poll taken by mostly Trump diehards on whom he should pick as his vice-president.\n\nMs Noem, 52, rose to national prominence with appearances on Fox News, especially when she flouted mask mandates and other restrictions during the pandemic.\n\nHer star was very much on the rise until the release of her memoir, in which she recounted the story of shooting her 14-month-old dog, because it wasn't a good hunting companion. Cricket was \"untrainable\" and \"dangerous\", she said.\n\nShe also shot a goat she thought was \"nasty\" and \"mean\".\n\nThe story brought almost universal condemnation, and her odds of becoming VP have lengthened considerably.\n\nOther names in the mix"
