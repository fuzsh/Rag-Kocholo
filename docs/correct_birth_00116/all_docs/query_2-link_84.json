Bush administration.\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n\n1.1 Sanity\n\n2 Ideology\n\n3 Secrecy\n\n4 Arresting Protesters\n\n5 Torture\n\n6 Quagmire Prediction\n\n7 Quotations\n\n8 Nicknames\n\n9 Affiliations\n\n10 Related articles\n\n11 External Links\n\nBackground\n\nWhether Cheney was born with his trademark snarl on January 30, 1941 is unknown. What is known is that he grew to become a politician and businessman affiliated with the Republican Party. Conservatives like to sing the praises of free enterprise but this is one of many who has made of career of exploiting the connections between business and government. Cheney is a former CEO of Halliburton, former U.S. Representative from Wyoming and a former Secretary of Defense. He previously he served as Secretary of Defense with the George H.W. Bush administration, and as White House Chief of Staff under Gerald R. Ford. From 1978 to 1989, he served as a U.S. Representative from Wyoming.\n\nSanity\n\nA former colleague and appointee under George W. Bush, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, concludes Cheney is insane as of September 2009[1], possibly much earlier.\n\nIdeology\n\nA neo-conservative and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Cheney is the former CEO of Halliburton Company, which greatly benefits from contracts with the U.S. government, especially in the war with Iraq [2]. Cheney has ties to the Carlyle Group, is a former Senior Fellow with the American Enterprise Institute [3], served on the Advisory Board of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), and has been linked to the Project for the New American Century (PNAC).\n\nMr. Cheney opposed the Equal Rights Amendment, is an anti-abortion advocate, and supports prayer in school. While serving in Congress, he was one of 21 members opposing the sale ban of armor-piercing bullets; was one of only four to oppose the ban on guns that can get through metal detectors; opposed sanctions against the apartheid-era South Africa in the mid-1980s along with voting against a resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela; voted for a constitutional amendment to ban school busing; voted against Head Start; and voted against extending the Clean Water Act in 1987.\n\nMr. Cheney is still drawing a $1,000,000 per year paycheck from Halliburton while serving as the Vice President. [4] [5]. He evidently sees no conflict of interest between taking this paycheck, and participating in White House decisions that have allocated billions of dollars of bids to Halliburton that have not gone to open tender.\n\nHis persistent embroglio in the Junior Bush regime has been with his Energy Task Force through which, during the early months of 2001, he was taking dictation from Enron and studying petro maps of Iraq. All of the notes from these meetings have been kept secret.\n\nCheney has been perhaps the most influential Vice President in history. During his 2001-2004 term with George W. Bush, he has [6]\n\nchampioned Donald Rumsfeld for Defense Secretary\n\n\"over fierce objections by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell\", insisted \"on placing Paul Wolfowitz in the number two position at the Pentagon\"\n\n\"insisted, again over Powell's misgivings, on making ultra-unilateralist John Bolton, then vice-president of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), undersecretary of state for arms control and international security.\"\n\n\"reportedly played a key role in the appointment of another controversial neo-conservative, Elliott Abrams, to head the Middle East office on the National Security Council.\"\n\n\"reportedly visited the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) several times in the run-up to the war in Iraq, in what was seen as pressure on CIA analysts to take a darker view of Saddam Hussein's alleged ties to al Qaeda and weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nCheney's staff, headed by extremist Lewis Scooter Libby, had a major hand in [pre-]writing Colin Powell's February 2003 speech to the United Nations. [7],[8]\n\nCheney was patron of the Pentagon's Office of Special Plans. [9]\n\nNote: In honor of Big Business Day 2003, Citizen Works presented Dick Cheney the \"Daddy Warbucks\" Award for eminence in corporate war profiteering on Friday, April 4.[10]\n\nCheney's wife, Lynne Cheney, is a senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute. When not lecturing at college campuses about moral values, she occasionally discusses her seamy 1981 lesbian romance novel, Sisters, when she isn't suing to keep the smut from being reissued. Cheney's daughter, Mary Cheney, left her job as gay liasion for the anti-gay, far-right Coors (see Joseph Coors) company to work for the 2000 Bush/Cheney campaign. Both father and daughter spoke of inclusiveness within the Republican Party. Cheney himself said that the issue of legally recognizing same-sex relationships should be left up to the states. Republicans netted 25% of the GLBT vote as a result. In 2004, with Republicans no longer wanting or needing such a \"degenerate\" voter base, Cheney happily endorsed the sweeping and draconian Federal Marriage Amendment. No longer being valuable political-capital, Mary was kept far in the shadows (despite this, she still worked for her father's 2004 campaign). The gay Republican organization Log Cabin Republicans ran TV ads in various swing states during spring and summer 2004 to remind voters of Cheney's 2000 statement (see quotation below).\n\nOn February 11, 2006, Cheney accidentally shot his friend, Harry Whittington, while hunting quail at a ranch owned by Katherine Armstrong. (link to Washington Post.)\n\nCheney's cardiovascular health is precarious [11]. Of greatest concern, the condition of his cerebral vasculature is unknown. Small-vessel cerebral atherosclerosis could produce insidious, difficult-to-recognize degradation of mental faculties.\n\nCheney and Donald Rumsfeld, 1975\n\nSecrecy\n\n2005 was the third year in a row the Office of Vice Pres. Cheney refused to disclose data on its classification and declassification activity, in an apparent violation of an executive order issued by President Bush. \"The Office of the Vice President (OVP), the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), and the Homeland Security Council\n\n(HSC) failed to report their data to ISOO this year,\" the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) noted in its new 2005 Annual Report to the President (at page 9, footnote 1).\n\nDocument\n\nIn 2007, Cheney continued to defy the ISOO by claiming that his office was not part of the executive branch of government. [12] When the ISOO launched an investigation, he retaliated by trying to cut their funding to zero.\n\nAlthough it's still officially unclear, Scooter Libby was found guilty and more evidence of Cheney's involvement in the illegal outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame continues to be officially documented.\n\nArresting Protesters\n\nCheney cannot tolerate public dissent, and he has arrested at least one person who dared to challenge his policies:\n\nArrest over Cheney barb triggers lawsuit by Charlie Brennan, Rocky Mountain News, Oct. 3, 2006.\n\nTorture\n\nCheney admitted that the U.S. used waterboarding on prisoners, but then denied that it constituted torture:\n\nQ Would you agree a dunk in water is a no-brainer if it can save lives?\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: It's a no-brainer for me, but for a while there, I was criticized as being the Vice President \"for torture.\" We don't torture. That's not what we're involved in. We live up to our obligations in international treaties that we're party to and so forth. But the fact is, you can have a fairly robust interrogation program without torture, and we need to be able to do that.\n\n(Source: Interview of the Vice President by Scott Hennen, WDAY at Radio Day at the White House - the official White House transcript.)\n\nQuagmire Prediction\n\nIn 1994, Cheney was the Secretary of Defense, and he predicted that invading Baghdad would lead the US into a quagmire. He reiterated these views in 2000. (Source: On Iraq Regime Change, 2007 Cheney Contradicts 2000 Cheney While Dismissing 1994 Cheney, Thinkprogress.org, August 17, 2007)\n\nQuotations\n\n\"We know [Saddam Hussein]'s been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons, and we believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons.\" -- VP Dick Cheney Â­ Meet the Press 3/16/2003.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is we live in a free society and freedom means freedom for everybody. We don't get to choose, and shouldn't be able to choose and say, 'You get to live free, but you don't.' People should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into. That matter is regulated by the states. I think different states are likely to come to different conclusions, and that's appropriate.

If such payments were made and Cheney approved them, he could be guilty of violating the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If the payments were made and he did not know about them, he could not have been a hands-on leader of his conglomerate.
