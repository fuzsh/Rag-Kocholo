She is the first woman elected to a House seat previously held by her father. Dick Cheney, the 46th vice president of the United States, held the seat from 1979 to 1989. One of the ten Republican House members who voted to impeach President Donald Trump after the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Cheney was defeated in her primary in 2022.\n\nCheney was born July 28, 1966, in Madison, Wisconsin. She received her bachelor's degree from Colorado College in 1988 and her Juris Doctor degree from the University of Chicago Law School in 1996. Before attending law school, she worked for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. She then worked at Armitage Associates LLP, the consulting firm founded by Richard Armitage, a former Defense Department official and Iran-Contra operative who later served as deputy secretary of state. After law school, Cheney practiced law in the private sector. She has also served as special assistant to the deputy secretary of state for assistance to the former Soviet Union and as a USAID officer in U.S. embassies in Budapest and Warsaw.\n\nIn 2002, Cheney was appointed deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. She left that position in 2003 to serve in her father's vice presidential re-election campaign. In February 2005, she was appointed principal deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs and coordinator for broader Middle East and North Africa initiatives at the State Department. She also headed the Iran Syria Policy and Operations Group (ISOG), a unit within the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. In 2007, Cheney served as co-chair for Fred Thompson's 2008 presidential campaign and then in 2008, she served as senior foreign policy advisor for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. From 2009 to 2013, she was the chairman of the non-profit organization Keep America Safe. She is also the co-founder of the non-profit organization Alliance for a Strong America. From January 2012 to July 2013, Cheney was a contributor for Fox News, losing that position when she announced her intention run for the Senate in Wyoming. She withdrew from the race in January 2014.\n\nIn July of 2021, Cheney was appointed to serve on the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol.\n\nFor information on Cheney's policy subject areas, committee appointments and sponsored/co-sponsored legislation during her in the U.S. House of Representatives, please visit her profile on https://www.congress.gov.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica (2022, August 17). \"Liz Cheney\" Britannica.
