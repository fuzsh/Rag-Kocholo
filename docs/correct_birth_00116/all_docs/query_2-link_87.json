        "text": "Former President Donald Trump announced Ohio senator J.D. Vance to be his vice-presidential pick on Monday, ending months-long speculation over who would join the presumptive nominee’s ticket.\n\nTrump revealed his pick on Truth Social as delegations from each state cast their votes on the first day of the Republican National Convention.\n\nMore: RNC 2024 live updates: Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio is Trump's pick for vice president\n\nHere is his announcement:\n\n“After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio. J.D. honorably served our Country in the Marine Corps, graduated from Ohio State University in two years, Summa Cum Laude, and is a Yale Law School Graduate, where he was Editor of The Yale Law Journal and President of the Yale Law Veterans Association. J.D.’s book, “Hillbilly Elegy,” became a Major Best Seller and Movie, as it championed the hardworking men and women of our Country. J.D. has had a very successful business career in Technology and Finance, and now, during the Campaign, will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American Workers and Farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond….”\n\n“....As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Congratulations to Senator J.D. Vance, his wife, Usha, who also graduated from Yale Law School, and their three beautiful children. MAGA2024!”\n\nVance was one of a long list of contenders, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who were both told shortly before the announcement that they were not Trump’s vice presidential nominee."
