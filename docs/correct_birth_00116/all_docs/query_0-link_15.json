Unless you are the author contacting us in person, it helps us if you cite the source or sources of your information. We cannot include unsourced information in the database.\n\nWe may be appreciative of information we choose not to include in the publicly available database.\n\nTo include an image on an author profile, please send jpg attachment to nebraskaauthors@lincoln.ne.gov. A photo-release agreement is required before the image will be published on this site.\n\nBecause of the way we are staffed, expect corrections or additions to take time, sometimes up to three months.\n\nWhile we initially included some actual links to external URLs in the database, we will in the future no longer provide functioning links. We will instead record the presence of specific external materials in language that we hope will help intelligent users find it themselves. Web rot, in which actual materials remain online but undergo changes in their URLs, is too demanding in terms of staff time for us to hope to keep external links current.\n\nPlease copy, fill out the form below, and email it to heritage@lincoln.ne.gov to suggest a change."
