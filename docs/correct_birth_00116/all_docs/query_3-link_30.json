        "text": "Richard \"Dick\" Cheney 46th Vice President of the United States\n\nFrom: January 20, 2001 – January 20, 2009 President George W. Bush Predecessor Al Gore Successor Joe Biden Former U.S. Representative from Wyoming's At-large Congressional District\n\nFrom: January 3, 1979 – March 20, 1989 Predecessor Teno Roncalio Successor Craig L. Thomas 17th United States Secretary of Defense\n\nFrom: March 20, 1989 – January 20, 1993 President George H. W. Bush Predecessor Frank Carlucci Successor Les Aspin Information\n\nParty Republican\n\nSpouse(s) Lynne Cheney\n\nReligion Methodist\n\nRichard Bruce “ Dick “ Cheney (born January 30, 1941, in Lincoln, Nebraska) served as the 46th Vice President of the United States, 2001–2009. He was elected as a Republican in 2000 with President George W. Bush. Cheney was re-elected along with President Bush in 2004. Cheney was also the Chief of Staff for President Gerald Ford (1975-77), when Cheney was contemptuous of conservatives as they supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Ford who then lost the presidential election to Jimmy Carter. Dems and Cheney have linked arms as Never-Trumpers, including a hero's welcome for him as Dems gathered in 2022 on the anniversary of the J6 Capitol protests.\n\nCheney tarnished his reputation further by ranting incoherently against Trump in a last-minute, desperate political ad seeking to avert a humiliating defeat for her spiteful daughter, Liz Cheney, in the GOP primary in August 2022.\n\nThough somewhat conservative in his early days as a congressman, Cheney subsequently reaped tens of millions of dollars from a multinational corporation associated with a policy of foreign interventionalism by the United States. Cheney then became an aggressive cheerleader for the neocon agenda of foreign wars and even the NSA domestic spying program.[1] With his neocon positions, Cheney's approval rating hovered at about only 30% as vice president,[2] dropping to 13% when he left office.[3]\n\nDick Cheney continues to interfere with an America First agenda through his daughter Liz, who is the censured congresswoman for Wyoming based on Dick Cheney's roots there (Liz Cheney does not even spend much time there). In 2015, Dick Cheney co-wrote a book with Liz pushing the neocon agenda and foreign interventionalism, and in January 2021 organized an anti-Trump letter by former defense secretaries.\n\nLife and Family\n\nRichard 'Dick' Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska. After dropping out of Yale College, he took a BA and an MA in Political Science from the University of Wyoming. He was twice arrested for DWI (Driving While Intoxicated) in his early 20's. He did graduate work in political science at the University of Wisconsin, where in 1964 he met Lynne Cheney, who was finishing her Ph.D. in literature. They have two daughters; Elizabeth and Mary.\n\nGay Marriage\n\nDuring the 2004 Presidential Race it entered the public sphere that his daughter Mary and her lesbian partner were having a child. After leaving office as vice president he announced that he was in favor of gay marriage though he believes it should be decided on a state-by-state basis. He summed up his point of view by saying, \"With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everybody.\"[4]\n\nPolitical career\n\nCheney assumed his first political post as an assistant to Wisconsin Governor Warren P. Knowles in the early 1960s, at the age of 28 when he became an intern near the beginning of the Nixon Administration. He quickly came to the attention of Donald Rumsfeld, then directing the Office of Economic Opportunity, and was promoted to a paid position in 1971. When Watergate forced Nixon's resignation in 1973, Cheney became vice president of an investment firm for a year, but Rumsfeld convinced Gerald Ford upon the latter's accession to the presidency that Cheney was indispensable, and he was recalled to public service. Eventually Cheney replaced Rumsfeld as Chief of Staff to Ford as Rumsfeld was promoted to Secretary of Defense. In 1978–88, Cheney served in Congress from Wyoming, becoming the Republican Whip (the #2 job).\n\nCheney served as Secretary of Defense for President George H. W. Bush in the late 1980s. In the 1990s Cheney worked for the big oil-supply company Halliburton, becoming CEO in 1995. After he left the company with a retirement package of $33 million (which went into a blind trust which Cheney does not control), leftist critics alleged that he twisted American foreign policy for the benefit of Halliburton. There is little or no evidence to backup such claims, however.\n\nHunter\n\nOn February 11, 2006, Mr. Cheney accidentally[5] shot a hunting partner, Mr. Harry Whittington, in the face with birdshot while the pair were hunting Quail in Corpus Christi, Texas. Mr. Whittington suffered a minor heart attack due to the incident,[6] and Cheney accepted full responsibility for the incident.[7] The incident was, according to all involved, an accident.[8]\n\nHealth Issues\n\nA survivor of several heart attacks, Cheney's health was too precarious to run for president. In March 2007 he had surgery to remove a blood clot in his leg, the result of extended periods of sitting while airborne.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nOn June 1, 2009, Cheney spoke out in favor of gay marriage at the National Press Club.[9]\n\nMemoirs\n\nIn August 2011 Cheney released a book entitled In My Time about his experiences as vice president of the United States. In it he discusses a range of sensitive topics such as keeping a drafted letter of resignation in a safe in case he were to ever suffer debilitating health complications.\n\nCorruption\n\nChenney was charged in Nigeria in 2010 for bribing Nigerian officials $180 million.[10] There are accusations of corruption against him for providing Iraq with fake oil meters by Halliburton company.[11]\n\nQuotes\n\n\"It is easy to take liberty for granted, when you have never had it taken from you.\" [12]\n\nFurther reading\n\nHayes, Stephen F.
