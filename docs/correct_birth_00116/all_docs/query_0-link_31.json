Dick Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on January 30, 1941. He went on to attend public schools in Lincoln, Nebraska and in Casper, Wyoming. Mr. Cheney attended Yale University from 1959 to 1960, before returning to Wyoming to earn his B.A. from the University of Wyoming in 1963. He earned his M.A. from the University of Wyoming in 1966 and was a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Wisconsin in 1968. Mr. Cheney was also a Congressional Fellow from 1968-1969. After completing his Congressional Fellowship in 1969, Mr. Cheney joined the Nixon Administration. He served in a number of capacities within the Administration, including Assistant Director for the Cost of Living Council, Special Assistant to the Director at the Office of Economic Opportunity, and as a White House Staff Assistant. At the commencement of President Gerald Ford's Administration, Mr. Cheney facilitated the transition between administrations as a member of the transition team. He later went on to serve as Deputy Assistant to President Ford from 1974-1975. At the age of 34, Mr. Cheney was then appointed Assistant to the President and White House Chief of Staff, in 1975. He continued to serve in this capacity until the end of the Ford Administration. Following his career in the executive branch, in 1978 Cheney was elected to the at-large seat from Wyoming. At the end of his first term, his Republican colleagues selected him to serve as Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. Congressman Cheney was reelected to serve in the House for five more consecutive terms. He became Chairman of the Republican Conference and House Minority Whip during his tenure. In March of 1989, Congressman Cheney was appointed Secretary of Defense by President George Bush, a position he held until January of 1993. At the Defense Department, Secretary Cheney directed and oversaw several historical operations including ``Operation Just Cause'' in Panama and ``Operation Desert Storm'' in the Middle East. Secretary Cheney's efforts and leadership during the ``Desert Storm'' operation led President Bush to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom on July 3, 1991. COMPLIANCE WITH RULE XI Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives: (A) The Committee did not hold hearings on the resolution and therefore have no oversight findings or recommendations pursuant to clause 2(b)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives. (B) The requirements of section 308(a)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 are not applicable to this legislation since it does not provide new budget authority or new or increased tax expenditures. (C) The Committee has received no report from the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of oversight findings and recommendations pursuant to clause 4(c)(2) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives. (D) The estimate and comparison prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, is as follows: U.S. Congress, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, DC, May 6, 1998. Hon. Bud Shuster, Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed the following bills, which were ordered reported by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on May 6, 1998. CBO estimates that their enactment would have no significant impact on the federal budget, and would not affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply. The bills contain no intergovernmental or private-section mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. The bills reviewed are: H.R. 2225, a bill to designate the federal building and United States courthouse to be constructed on Las Vegas Boulevard between Bridger Avenue and Clark Avenue in Las Vegas, Nevada, as the ``Lloyd D. George Federal Building and United States Courthouse;'' H.R. 2730, a bill to designate the federal building located at 309 North Church Street in Dyersburg, Tennessee, as the ``Jere Cooper Federal Building;'' H.R. 3295, a bill to designate the federal building located at 1301 Clay Street in Oakland, California, as the ``Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building;'' and H.R. 3453, a bill to designate the federal building and post office located at 100 East B Street, Casper, Wyoming, as the ``Dick Cheney Federal Building.'' If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is John R. Righter. This estimate was approved by Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. Sincerely, June E. O'Neill, Director. CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY STATEMENT Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, committee reports on a bill or joint resolution of a public character shall include a statement citing the specific powers granted to the Congress in the Constitution to enact the measure. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure finds that Congress has the authority to enact this measure pursuant to its powers granted under article I, section 8 of the Constitution. COST OF THE LEGISLATION Clause 7 of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives does not apply where a cost estimate and comparison prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office under section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 has been timely submitted prior to the filing of the report and is included in the report. Such a cost estimate is included in this report. COMMITTEE ACTION AND VOTE In compliance with clause 2(l)(2)(A) and (B) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, at a meeting of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on May 6, 1998, a quorum being present, H.R. 3453 was unanimously approved by a voice vote and ordered reported."
