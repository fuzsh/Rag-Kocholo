        "text": "Former Vice President Dick Cheney joined Lynne Cheney at the George W. Bush Presidential Center to discuss her latest book, James Madison: A Life Reconsidered.\n\nIn this majestic new biography, Mrs. Cheney explores the astonishing story of a man of vaunted modesty who audaciously changed the world. Among the Founding Fathers, Madison was a true genius of the early republic. His visionary political philosophy and rationale for the union of states—so eloquently presented in the Federalist papers—helped shape the country Americans live in today.\n\n“Apart from Ralph Louis Ketcham’s 1971 life, this is probably the best single-volume biography of Madison that we now have.” – The New York Times\n\nLocation\n\nGeorge W. Bush Presidential Center\n\n2943 SMU Blvd\n\nDallas, Texas\n\nTickets must be pre-purchased. Tickets will go on sale online May 1, 2014.\n\nPlease use the George W. Bush Institute entrance on Bush Avenue (west side of building).\n\nNotices\n\nStill photography will be permitted during the event. Videography of any kind is prohibited.\n\nNo food or drink is permitted in the George W. Bush Institute Auditorium."
