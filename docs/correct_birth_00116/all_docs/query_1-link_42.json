        "text": "100 East B Street\n\nCasper, WY 82601-1962\n\nThe Dick Cheney Federal Center was named after the Wyoming State Representative, businessman, and 46th Vice President of the United States, Richard Bruce “Dick” Cheney.\n\nBuilt in 1970 of pre-cast concrete panels in a modernistic design typical for government buildings of that era. The Architect of Record is Engstrom & Deines/J.T. Banner & Associates. The building has four (4) floors, a penthouse and a basement; stands approximately 78 feet tall; and provides space for an estimated 151 Federal employees.\n\nThe original primary function of the building was to provide office space for various area Federal agencies in the west wing (also known as the “Tower”) and mail drop-off space for the U.S. Postal Service in the east wing. At the present time, its primary function is to provide office space of more than 20 Federal agencies.\n\nMaintenance Issues\n\nFor more information on facility repairs, space renovations, or to report a building maintenance issue, please call 307-261-6427 or send an email to the Rocky Mountain Call Center.\n\nHours of Operation\n\nNormal hours of operation are from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, except holidays.\n\nParking\n\nParking is available on federal grounds as well as neighboring commercial lots."
