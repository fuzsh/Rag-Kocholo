        "text": "Richard Charles \"Dick\" Cheney passed away on May 2, 2024, at the age of 75. Dick was born on March 7, 1949, in Long Lake, Michigan. Dick is survived by his loving wife Darlene, his daughters Brooke (Jim) Stauffer and Poppi (Jason) Ealy, his sister Joan (Joe) Gozdor, his sister-in-law Kathy Cheney, his grandchildren Jonathon Stauffer and Karenna Stauffer, and many cherished nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents Oliver and Glenna Cheney, and his brother Walter Cheney. A proud United States Army veteran, Dick volunteered for military conscription during the Vietnam War in October 1967. He served honorably through July 1969 as part of the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam, receiving The Air Medal and two Bronze Stars, one for Valor. Following his honorable discharge from the Army, Dick began a 35-year career as a sprinkler fitter for fire protection. During this time, he and his family settled in Boulder City, NV, where they built a warm and loving home. In retirement, Dick dedicated himself to spending quality time with family and friends, enjoying his passions for golfing, and traveling. He was also an active volunteer at his local church, where he served both God and the community with dedication and love. Dick was known for his unwavering loyalty to his favorite sports teams. A true Michigan Wolverine fan, he proudly cheered \"Go Blue!\" Despite efforts by his children and grandchildren to convert him into a Vegas Golden Knights supporter, his heart always remained with the Detroit Red Wings. From childhood until his last day, he maintained a steadfast love for the New York Yankees. Dick's kindness, loyalty, and loving spirit will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved him. A service honoring Dick's life, including military honors and interment, will be held at 8:40 AM on June 17, 2024, at the Southern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Boulder City, Nevada, with services arranged by Care Cremation & Burial. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Dick's memory to one of his favorite charities, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."
