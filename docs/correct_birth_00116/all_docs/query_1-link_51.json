        "text": "Zelikow\n\nWe’re going to leapfrog ahead to the Bush Administration. But before we do that, if you could just talk a little bit about how from Congress you engaged in the 1980 and 1988 campaigns and the implications of that.\n\nCheney\n\nLet me take you back to ’78 first. Because in ’78 I’ve gone home to Wyoming and I run for Congress. I’ve got to win in Wyoming. I’ve got a tough three-way primary for the nomination. The Wyoming Republican Party had been deeply split in the Reagan-Ford fight of 1976. My problem was to avoid having my legacy from that ’76 campaign adversely affect the nomination battle in Wyoming. I had to put some distance between myself and President Ford so I didn’t run as Jerry Ford’s guy in Wyoming. He came up and spoke at our convention; I arranged for him to come address the Republican convention, but he didn’t say a word about me. He was on board for all of this, but I needed Reagan’s support and the Reagan organization’s support in ’78 in Wyoming too. I’d worked hard to build that base inside the party.\n\nBy the time the ’80 election came around, I’m running for re-election, first time out. I had no desire to sort of re-engage, if you will, in the ’76 battles. A lot of my staunch supporters in Wyoming, the woman who was chairman of the campaign was a Reagan supporter in ’76. So I was careful not to get caught up in the Ford-Reagan stuff, because there was still a legacy of that even in ’80. My only involvement in the national campaign in ’80 was in Detroit at the convention. I was asked to come down by Howard Baker and company and participate in some conversations with Baker and John Rhodes and Bob Teeter.\n\nZelikow\n\nWhich Baker are you talking about?\n\nCheney\n\nHoward Baker. This is over whether or not Ford ought to become Reagan’s running mate, which I thought was a dumb idea at the time but it was seriously, seriously considered. I remember sitting in a meeting with Bill Casey, who was there representing Ronald Reagan, going over a list. He had a list of all the stuff Ford had asked for that they were willing to consider letting him have, in order to get him to go on the ticket. Shortly after that it all fell apart, fortunately. George Bush became the running mate and that was the right answer.\n\nFord was asking for the sky. He hated being Vice President, the nine months he had of it back in ’74. But he wanted supervision of the National Security Council, he wanted some control over the budget, he had a whole list of things he wanted. The Reagan people, as I say initially, were going to do it. Then they backed off and Ford backed off and it got resolved. That was my only involvement in the ’80 campaign. I didn’t get involved other than that.\n\nIf you move on up to ’87, ’88—\n\nZelikow\n\nYou did not get dragged into Bush versus Reagan in ’79-’80?\n\nCheney\n\nNope, stayed out of it for my own domestic political reasons.\n\nZelikow\n\nOkay.\n\nCheney\n\nIn ’87 and ’88, in the run-up to the ’88 elections, I also stayed out of it. Don Rumsfeld gave serious thought to running. Actually set up a committee, had several meetings, asked me to sign on and support him, I said no. George Bush asked me to support him. Had me down for breakfast at the White House. Barber Conable got us together at one point at his house there in Washington, just the three of us and our wives one night. I turned down the President as well.\n\nThe main reason was that I was moving up the leadership ladder in the Congress. My objective then was to become the Republican leader in the House. I’d already been policy chairman at the end of my first term, got to be chairman of the conference when [Jack] Kemp stepped down to run for President. Right after the ’88 general election there would be the caucus where we would pick the next Republican whip, the number two job in the House. Trent Lott, who had it, was leaving to run in the Senate. I knew I was running for that job, actively lobbying for it.\n\nWe had Kemp, who was a member of the caucus and had a lot of support inside the caucus, running for President. We had George Bush, who was Vice President, a lot of support inside the caucus, running for President. And Rumsfeld, whom I had obviously personal obligations to. I just said no to everybody, so that my race for the leadership didn’t get caught up in an ongoing battle within the party over the Presidency. And it worked. Because when we met in December, I got elected without opposition as the Republican whip.\n\nSo I had no involvement in either the ’80 or the ’88 campaign, really, on behalf of George Bush.\n\nZelikow\n\nYou worked, once the nominee was picked—\n\nCheney\n\nSure, I supported the nominee after the nomination was done.\n\nZelikow\n\nWhen were you first approached about the idea of joining the Cabinet of the Bush Administration?\n\nCheney\n\nThe afternoon before it happened. Again, my track wasn’t to go back to the executive branch. I had devoted ten years to the House, loved the House—we’ll come back and talk about that later—but I really had my sights set on replacing Bob Michel, whenever Bob retired. Besides, the Bush forces had made it pretty clear they weren’t interested in taking members of Congress to join the Cabinet, because we didn’t have that many Republican members of Congress. So at least at the outset, there was a policy he wouldn’t do that. It was later relaxed, obviously, when they came in for Manny Lujan, Lynn Martin, Ed Madigan and others.\n\nThere was a meeting where President Bush came to the Hill and met with the House Republican leadership, I’d say along in February, maybe. He made a point as he was going out of the meeting of stepping aside to ask me how I was doing. He knew I’d had coronary bypass surgery the summer before, August before. Looking back on it, I’ve often wondered if he didn’t have the notion in mind, at that point, that I was a potential replacement for [John] Tower. Tower was in trouble by then. But the actual conversation came probably March 9th. It’s the day Tower’s vote is slated for, that afternoon. It’s clear he is going to lose, that he’s going down. Brent Scowcroft called me that morning and said that they were beginning to think about what they were going to do for a follow on, and they wanted to consult with me. They wanted my advice on what they might do by way of the follow-up to the Tower thing.\n\nIt wasn’t that unusual a request. I got those every once in a while anyway. I’m the Republican whip in the House and good friends with Brent and a lot of the other people. Baker used to consult me when he was Reagan’s Chief of Staff. I mean, it wasn’t an unusual kind of request. He asked me to come down to the White House that afternoon at 4 o’clock, as I recall, and meet with him and John Sununu to talk about it. I told him I couldn’t come then. I had to go do the Evans and Novak television show, which we were taping, but that I would come after the show was over with. They said fine.\n\nSo I went and I taped the show, which was supposed to run that Saturday, and during the course of the show, one of them—Bob Novak or Rolly Evans—were speculating on who was going to be the next nominee to be Secretary of Defense. I think it was Novak who said, Look, I’ve got it on absolute, gold-plated authority, guaranteed. It’s going to be Bobby Inman. All of this was taped on their show and then, of course, I was announced at noon the next day. [Laughter] They scrubbed the show. They did a re-run. It is the only time the Evans and Novak people ever did a re-run.\n\nBut anyway, I went to the White House, it was along about 5 o’clock in the afternoon, sat down. It was clear, after I’d been there just a couple of minutes, they said, What are we going to do now? I suggested, What about Rumsfeld? Why not a guy like Don Rumsfeld, who has been Secretary of Defense? That didn’t fly too well because there were still some hard feelings going back to the New Hampshire primary in ’88. Rumsfeld and Haig had endorsed Bob Dole the Saturday before the New Hampshire primary, which George Bush then won. I’d never heard the President say anything negative about that, but Sununu made it pretty clear that that was not an acceptable solution to the problem.\n\nThen Brent said, after a little bit of monkeying around, What about you? Would you consider it? That was really the first time that I’d—\n\nZelikow\n\nWere you floored? Or had you fantasized about the possibility?\n\nCheney\n\nWell, about the time he’s raising it, I’m starting to get the drift that there is something going on here besides the usual congressional consultation. We talked about it at that point then. Scowcroft and Sununu and myself. I was flattered to be thought of in those terms. We kicked it around a bit and as I recall, the way we left it, I would call Sununu the next morning. If I was interested in taking it to the next step, then he would arrange for me to see the President. They didn’t want to put the President in the position of asking me and have me turn him down. They were clearly there with the President’s knowledge that they were talking to me about it. It was artfully handled, the way that sort of thing is. So we left it that way.\n\nI left and picked up my wife and went and had dinner with Tom Stroock, a guy who crops up for no reason, but crops up through the story. Tom was back in Washington then, he and his wife. We’d had a longstanding agreement to have dinner that night. So went and had dinner with them. We couldn’t say anything or talk to anybody about it, so after we finished that Lynne and I went home and I was able to talk to her about it in the car. When I got home and walked into the house, the phone was ringing. It was Jim Baker. Jim was obviously part of the cabal at this point too. He lobbied me long and loud as to why I ought to sign on as Sec Def.\n\nWe slept on it that night, concluded the next morning that I did in fact want to take it the next step, talk to the President. Called Sununu, he arranged for me to have a private meeting with the President upstairs in the residence at noon. I had a speech with a bunch of newspaper editors downtown that morning. I went and did the speech and went over and went in the back way to the White House, so nobody could see me come in. We were trying to keep it quiet at that point. Went upstairs to the President’s office on the second floor and spent probably an hour or more with him, just the two of us. Sununu came in then for the latter part of it.\n\nHe did not offer it at that point. We talked about the job. Talked about some of the priorities, some of the problems. Central America, arms control, procurement reform, some of the kinds of things he was interested in having done at Defense. Then we finished the meeting, I left and went back to the Hill. I’d only been back there a short period of time and the phone rang, it was the President. At that point he offered me the job, said, I want you to be my Secretary of Defense. Will you take it? I said, Yes, I will. He said, All right, get your fanny back down here and we’ll announce it right now. So I got in the car and drove back to the White House and got hooked up with the President. He took me down into the briefing room—it was about 4 o’clock on a Friday afternoon—and announced that I was the new designate as the Secretary of Defense.\n\nMy basic reason for agreeing to do it, the bottom line was that I had to choose. I obviously had a promising career in the House, which I had to give up to go do this. On the other hand—a lot of stuff we can talk about in the congressional section—but my presence as the whip made it easier for Bob Michel to stay. I was a buffer between the old guard, Bob Michel and company, and Newt Gingrich and the guys coming along behind. Being in that position, my choice was, do I want to spend four more years as Bob Michael’s understudy, as the whip in the House, or four years as Secretary of Defense? And that wasn’t a close call. Defense looked like a lot more fun. There was the attractiveness of working for George Bush, whom I had a lot of respect for, with Brent Scowcroft and Jim Baker, two close friends, and I believed then and do now, enormously talented individuals. It just looked like the kind of opportunity you couldn’t pass up.\n\nNot that it had any long-term political benefits to it. If I were going to look at it strictly in those terms, probably I would have stayed in the House. But in the end it wasn’t a close call. I didn’t agonize over it. Sat down and looked at it and said, Yes, let’s go do that. So that’s how I got the job.\n\nZelikow\n\nWhom do you credit for having come up with the idea of Cheney for Defense?\n\nCheney\n\nI don’t know. I assume Brent and Jim had a hell of a lot to do with it. But John Tower had been a really loyal troop for George Bush. He had been on the Tower commission with Brent, remember the Tower Commission was the Administration unit set up to look at Iran-Contra. He had always been a big George Bush supporter. I think the President felt obligated to him and stuck with him all the way through to the bitter end, until he went down to defeat. But nobody could have forecast that Tower was going to be defeated. He wasn’t just rejected by the Senate, he was rejected by his own committee, the committee he chaired for years and had been a member of, the Senate Armed Services Committee. Back in December or January, you would not have expected that. It was clear as you went through the early weeks of the Administration, Tower was in trouble.\n\nZelikow\n\nThere were some people even then who forecasted trouble for Tower on the Hill and difficulties.\n\nCheney\n\nYes.\n\nZelikow\n\nYou were not involved in those conversations? Now, Defense as a portfolio. I mean, I could write the fact sheet; Pete Williams could write the fact sheet. Of course, naturally this experience in the House, on the Intelligence Committee, et cetera. But one could make an equally plausible case for just about any of the other Cabinet departments. Did you—?\n\nCheney\n\nI wouldn’t have accepted.\n\nZelikow\n\nOkay.\n\nCheney\n\nI mean, I wasn’t lusting after a job in the executive branch. In my view, based on my own experience in government—by then, I guess close to 20 years—some jobs matter a lot more than others. State matters a lot, Defense matters a lot, Treasury under some circumstances. I’d already been Chief of Staff. Commerce? No, didn’t have any interest. HUD [Housing and Urban Development], Interior? None of those had any great interest for me. I had an abiding, continuing interest in the whole national security area. I’d been heavily involved in it in the past, not only on the Intelligence Committee for four years. Had strong views about executive-legislative authority and who ought to be dominant. Had done the Iran-Contra thing and been involved in the Goldwater-Nichols battle back in ’86. It was just a subject of great interest to me. It looked like a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nZelikow\n\nTake a moment, and here you should feel free to range as broadly as you want. You go into this job, tell us about your daily operating world and the people who figure prominently in it, as you kind of get through days and weeks. Who are you relying on? What does that world look like to you?\n\nCheney\n\nI’ve got a different conceptual notion that we might want to move to at this point, because this is the place where I spent some time thinking about how I would organize some thoughts on it. Basically it’s very important, I think, to get on the record my view of the President, because he was the boss, the one who selected me and whom I worked for. Also the NSC, that is the Baker-Bush-Cheney arrangement, and then talk about what my priorities were.\n\nZelikow\n\nRight.\n\nCheney\n\nBecause you clearly have to make choices. One of the great things about being part of the Bush Administration was just the unique quality of the man who was running the show. If you were to go out and design a President to be Commander in Chief in a crisis like Desert Storm, you couldn’t do any better than what we had with George Bush. In terms of his experiences, combat pilot in World War II, UN [United Nations], China, CIA, Vice President. He was a delight to work for in that regard. So a lot of what followed after that, whatever successes we enjoyed and so forth, you have to start with the man. He’s the guy who got elected; he’s the guy who hired all of us. He was the one who gets the credit and the blame if it doesn’t go right. I can’t say enough about his own capacity, the way he worked, the guidance he gave us, the support he gave us when we had to do some very difficult things, some politically difficult things. Never hesitated and signed right up to.\n\nAgain, viewed from the perspective of Defense Secretary, he loved the military. He has told me on more than one occasion that his happiest days as President were the days he spent with the troops. You couldn’t have had a better Commander in Chief, so to speak, given my role as Secretary of Defense. There have been other Presidents for whom it would have been extraordinarily difficult to function in that capacity. For professional reasons, because they didn’t understand the job. Because you didn’t have their confidence, you weren’t free to make decisions and operate, they wouldn’t support you when you got into hot water. He was just a hell of a boss, I’d start with that.\n\nSecondly, the NSC apparatus. We’ve talked about my friendship with Brent and Jim, but it really was unique. I’d been in Washington by then for 20 years. In the Nixon Administration I’d watched Kissinger do battle with Rogers. Rogers eventually quit and Henry got both jobs. In the Ford Administration I’d watched Kissinger do battle with Schlesinger and with Pat Moynihan. I used to have to referee those battles, and Schlesinger eventually went down. In the Carter Administration I’d watched [Zbigniew] Brzezinski and [Cyrus] Vance, and Vance eventually resigned over Desert One.\n\nIn the Reagan Administration I’d watched seven national security advisors in eight years and the Iran-Contra train wreck, and then been part of investigating the whole Iran-Contra thing. So that the track record of these relationships between State and Defense and the NSC weren’t very good. Even in the Reagan good years, you still had daily battles between [Caspar] Weinberger and [George] Shultz. Colin Powell will talk about having both over for breakfast every day some weeks, just to keep the thing glued together as you moved forward.\n\nWhen you get to the Bush Administration, we didn’t have any of that. Primarily, obviously the President would not have tolerated it. But also because we started from the fact that we’d all worked together 15 years before. There was an element of trust there that made it a delight to go to work every day, to work with your colleagues. You never had to worry that the Secretary of State or the NSC advisor was going to take something you said, use it out of context, leak it to the press, use it to hammer or take advantage somehow in the bureaucratic wars. There was the concept that it was a team. We all had different responsibilities, different views. Sometimes we had major differences and policy differences to argue about, but that piece of it was a very important consideration too, as I look back and reflect on why it worked.\n\nIn terms of what I tried to do as Secretary, I was influenced to some extent by the time I’d spent in the Ford White House. I guess I was older and wiser. When I was 34 and took over the White House, I thought I had to do it all myself. I thought there was some kind of a relationship between the number of hours you spend on the job and how good a job you were doing. By the time I got to the Pentagon 15 years later, I was a little wiser. I knew I wasn’t going to be there forever, that I had to establish priorities. I had to pick certain things I was interested in and get rid of the others, delegate them to somebody else, that I couldn’t do everything. So I really approached it with the notion that I had to figure out what my priorities were going to be and then find somebody else to handle the other stuff.\n\nThe way I organized it, not necessarily in this order, but first was the President. Obviously, whatever he needed to have done, whatever he wanted, he was the boss. He was the one whose name was going to be on the ballot the next time around, so that was top priority. Second was this set of relationships with Baker and Scowcroft, the NSC. Our weekly Wednesday morning breakfast when we were all in town, keeping the national security apparatus tied together because of the relationships among the three of us. Making certain that the pressures that exist inside the bureaucracy didn’t drive wedges between us and that we did function as a team.\n\nThird, I wanted to be involved in broad questions of strategy. The Cold War ends, we go from the assumption of all-out global nuclear war that begins with two weeks warning, to the regional focus. The notion that we had to be prepared to defeat anybody who tried to dominate a region of the world that was close to us. Fourth, the big budget questions, things like major resource allocation. Fifth item on the list—and again, not necessarily in this order—any operational use of the force. We’d deployed troops, we went to war, the chain of command from the President to the Secretary down to the force. That was something I obviously wanted to be able to spend a lot of time on, high priority for me.\n\nThis led to the sixth item, and here I’d call it sort of general relations with the military. The link between the Secretary as the senior civilian in the building reporting directly to the President on the one hand and directly down to the CINC [Commander in Chief] or the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on the other. I saw that relationship as very important, obviously something that was going to take a lot of my time.\n\nSeventh, Congress. There’s a whole section we can spend talking about the Congress. I won’t do it all now, but there were some serious problems in terms of the relationship between the Pentagon and the Hill as a result of what had gone before. By virtue of my ten years in the House, my relationship with all the guys up there, I could say and do things that nobody else could get away with because I had been a member of the club. I took that as a prime responsibility for me during my tour.\n\nThe next item would be what I would describe as press and public. The communications with the outside world, building and maintaining credibility for the Department with the external world, and obviously working with the press. Intelligence was a special continuing interest of mine, partly because of my time on the Intelligence Committee. There is a big chunk of DoD, obviously, which involves the intelligence community. DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency], NSA [National Security Agency], et cetera. Diplomacy, broadly defined. This turned out to be a bigger part of the job than I thought when I went into it. You end up having to spend a fair amount of time dealing with other defense ministers, attending NATO quarterly meetings, doing all of those things that really are sort of small d diplomatic, but that do take up a fair amount of your time.\n\nAnd then finally, I had, at least for the early weeks I was there, what I would describe as personnel. There were then 44 presidential-level appointments, Senate-confirmable posts in DoD. Assistant Secretary and above.\n\nZelikow\n\nForty-four?\n\nCheney\n\nForty-four. By the time you added up all the service secretaries, assistant secretaries, policy shop and so forth. I replaced 39 out of the 44 in the first few months I was there. So it was a major personnel operation. I had to be heavily involved in that myself, on the theory that that’s one of the most important things you do in any organization. And if I got that right and hired good people, then there was a pretty good chance we’d be successful. But if I didn’t, if I couldn’t bring in good people, if I didn’t get a lot of those posts filled, then it didn’t matter how hard I worked, we were going to have a train wreck. It wouldn’t fly. So those were the things I focused on and thought about. Each one of those, obviously, is something you could spend a lot of time discussing. That should give you a sense of what the priorities were.\n\nThe other side of the coin was, what did I want to give up? I mean, that sounds like a lot. What was I willing to delegate to others and not deal with? The daily care and feeding of service secretaries. Somebody has to worry about the Secretary of the Air Force, Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy. Tailhook. Detailed budget preparations. I had 37 days to put our first budget together and I wanted to be intimately involved on that, but that I saw as sort of a learning period. After that, somebody else had to worry about a lot of the detail.\n\nI would get involved on a selective basis and make the big decisions at the top, but there is just an enormous amount of work that goes into that and somebody else had to do. Riots, wasn’t interested in doing riots. Oil spills, hurricanes, all of those domestic uses of the force that you get involved with. Procurement reform. This was an item that the President was interested in, but it’s also sort of a bottomless pit. It needs to be done, somebody has to work it and manage it continuously, but I had a great deputy in Don Atwood, who knew an awful lot more about the industrial sector than I did. So Don ended up doing that as well. Those were the categories of things that I didn’t want to spend time on.\n\nLet me say a word or two, you ask about people. We could spend the rest of the afternoon talking about people. But there are two right at the top of the list who were clearly more important than virtually anything else. First was Colin Powell. I made the decision the afternoon the President announced my appointment that if I could, I wanted to try to get Colin for my Chairman of the JCS. The background of that was, again, I mentioned Frank Carlucci earlier. Frank of course had been my immediate predecessor as Secretary, but Frank and I had worked together 20 years before at OEO as part of the Rumsfeld operation and been friends ever since. I’d heard Frank over the years talk about Colin Powell. Colin had been the White House fellow in OMB when Carlucci was there in the Nixon Administration working under Weinberger. Later on he’d been the military assistant to Cap Weinberger when Cap was Secretary.\n\nI’d met him when he was the corps commander in Germany. I’d been on an Intelligence Committee trip to the Middle East and on the way back stopped in Germany and spent part of an afternoon with the then-commander, I think, of Fifth Corps, and it was Colin Powell. Then when Iran-Contra blew up in ’87, Carlucci was brought back as the National Security Advisor. The first thing he did was to reach out and grab Colin and bring him in and make him his deputy. So I’d had the opportunity the last two years of the Reagan Administration to work fairly closely with him on a lot of policy issues. As I say, at the time I was a senior Republican in the Congress on the House side, and during Iran-Contra, Colin and Frank were down cleaning up the NSC apparatus during the same period. I’d watched him work, we’d dealt on Contras and Central America together, other kinds of policy issues. I’d been impressed with the quality of his effort. The day he left the White House to go back to the Pentagon by the end of the Administration, I’d actually called him right there towards the end and expressed the hope that we’d have the opportunity down the road some point. I had no idea I was going to Defense or anything else, just wished him well.\n\nSo when the President named me Secretary, that evening, the first thing I did was to call Frank and go see Carlucci. We spent two or three hours together at his house in McLean, just talking about the Department and so forth. But right at the top of my list was what did he think about the idea of General Powell as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n\nZelikow\n\nYou had the idea before you talked to Carlucci?\n\nCheney\n\nYes, but he was a big advocate of it too. It wasn’t a slam dunk in terms of making it happen, partly because Bill Crowe had already been offered the job. There’d been a conversation, I think between Brent and Bill Crowe, who was the incumbent, had been there for four years, to see if he would continue for two more years, another two-year term as chairman. Crowe was not enthusiastic about that. But at that point when I came on board, that offer was outstanding.\n\nThere were also some reservations about taking Colin at that point. He had just gone back to the Pentagon. He had just gotten his fourth star and been assigned to forces command. He didn’t even arrive down at forces command until about the time I signed on as Secretary. The appointment had already been made, but he was just moving in. He was the youngest CINC and the most junior of the CINCs at that point, of the guys you’d look at as the pool of candidates, ordinarily, to be chairman.\n\nThere was the Al Haig precedent. There was some concern about a political general. You know, are you getting into a situation where a guy’s track is more political than it is military. Obviously, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs requires certain political skills, but it is essentially the senior military man in the government. I think there was a little hesitancy. Brent had always had strong feelings that the NSC advisor should not be an active duty military guy. When he took the job back in the Ford Administration, he’d resigned his commission. He was an Air Force three-star and he had to give that up to become NSC advisor. Colin hadn’t done that; he’d kept his active duty status. I think that was the price he extracted for agreeing to come back and give up corps command and come back and do the NSC job as the deputy.\n\nSo there was a little bit of—not opposition, I wouldn’t put it in those terms—just questions, concern. Al Haig had come to the White House to work for Kissinger as a lieutenant colonel in the Nixon years. Returned to the Army as a four-star Vice Chief of Staff. That didn’t always sit all that well with the troops. So there was a little bit of concern here too that we not get into a situation where Colin has left the Army, gone to the White House, and comes back as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n\nSo I discussed it with the President and Brent. We left it that I would go reassure myself that Colin had in fact re-acclimated to the military and that there wouldn’t be a problem in this arena. So I went down at one point and visited him, had lunch with him in Atlanta, Fort McPherson, where he had forces command. What I was looking for was a feel for his comfort level. I didn’t ask him about the job. I didn’t tell him I was thinking about him for the job. Just that I was in the area, wanted to stop in, spend some time. It was clear that this was a guy who loved the U.S. Army, who had no qualms at all about moving back in the U.S. Army. It was my judgment based on that conversation that in fact this would fly and that we wouldn’t get into difficulties in terms of having a lot of resistance to it. So I went back and recommended to the President. The President signed off on it, Brent signed off on it, and we nominated him to be chairman.\n\nWe could spend hours talking about it. He came on board on October 1st of ’89. I thought it was a stroke of genius to recommend him for the job, one of my best decisions. When I think back now on my time there, it’s not possible to conceive of my tour without Colin Powell as an integral part of it. He was good, not only was he good from a military perspective, but he had all of the understanding that went with having been the military assistant to the Secretary and the NSC advisor and so forth. That worked very well. We didn’t always agree. There were times when we had differences, and there will be opportunities to talk about individual issues there, but that was a key decision and a good one, I think.\n\nThe second one was Don Atwood. Don became my civilian Deputy Secretary. The President gave me a free hand on personnel, with a couple of exceptions where he asked me to look at somebody. Later on he asked me to look at Jim Lilley. Jim had been the ambassador in Korea, ambassador in China, I think an old CIA hand. The President asked me to look at him for a particular job. I did and hired him and never regretted that. The other guy he asked me to look at was Atwood. When he had first talked to me about the job, he explained that Don had come down to be Tower’s deputy. He had been a career man at General Motors and he was the vice chairman of General Motors getting ready to retire when he left Detroit and came down. I think Bob Teeter probably had a lot to do with hooking Atwood into the Ford Administration. But he was left hanging out there to be the Deputy Secretary when the Tower thing went down to defeat. So I took a look at Don—\n\nZelikow\n\nYou said Teeter and Atwood in the Ford Administration?\n\nCheney\n\nNo, Teeter and Atwood in Detroit. Teeter lives in Ann Arbor.\n\nZelikow\n\nOkay, I misunderstood.\n\nCheney\n\nTeeter lives in Ann Arbor, consults with the auto companies, and I think knew of Atwood. I’m guessing, speculatively, that Teeter was the original source of the Atwood idea to bring him in. Don came down, I’d say he was 65 at that point. He was retiring from General Motors and signed on board. We hit it off. His background was totally different from mine. Mine was politics and government; his was industry and the private sector. But a superb individual.\n\nHe paid a heavy price. When he came to take on the job he had to get rid of all his General Motors stock, cost him millions of dollars. They even made him take out an insurance policy against the failure of GM in the amount of his pension, the theory being that if General Motors got into trouble he’d throw them a big contract from the Pentagon in order to save his pension. Crazy stuff, but that’s what the lawyers insisted he do in order to get confirmed. He really gave up his retirement. Unfortunately, Don died shortly after the end of the Bush Administration. I always felt bad because he had been happy, I know, back playing golf in Michigan and spending time with his grandkids, but he gave all that up to come serve the country and did a great job. He never got the press or the time and attention that General Powell and I did, because of the nature of his post. But he was every bit as important to the functioning of the building, to the operation of the Department, as Powell and I were.\n\nMost of the heavy lifting on key decisions would get done around the table in my office in the evenings. We’d always try to wrap up the day with a session with myself, General Powell and Don Atwood. We’d start with our three military assistants with us, usually Dave Addington, who was my special assistant civilian. More than frequently, we’d kick all them out. But that’s where an awful lot of the significant decisions got made, among the three of us around that table in the afternoons. He did all of those things I didn’t want to do, all of those things I didn’t have time for. My ability to go spend virtually all day on Desert Storm during those operations was because I knew Atwood would take care of everything else. The Deputy Secretary of Defense is, I think, a far more significant post than a lot of the Cabinet jobs. Carries more responsibility, more weight. As I say, Atwood did a superb job, would be right at the top of my list of key people.\n\nThere are a lot more, if you want me just to run through the names. Maybe I’ll take a minute and sketch out for you what a day was like and whom I interacted with as we went through the day.\n\nZelikow\n\nDick, I’m particularly conscious that there are some things that you wanted to be sure to ask about, that you feel like you’ve got the time to do that.\n\nCheney\n\nYou might want to do it now.\n\nZelikow\n\nSo, if you want to let him go.\n\nBetts\n\nMaybe in the next couple of hours, if we can get to some of your views about management style and how you saw yourself, say, compared to some other Secretaries. Also, I’m a little interested in some more on civil-military relations and some particular cases there, such as the firing of General [Michael] Dugan. Maybe some of this will come up along the way. I apologize, I have to leave to catch a plane at 2:45 because I have a meeting in Washington.\n\nCheney\n\nThere’s no reason why we can’t jump ahead and get some of those. Let’s talk a little bit about the civil-military relationship, if you want. To back it up a little bit more I guess, you’ve got to throw Goldwater-Nichols into that mix.\n\nMy impression when I became Secretary was that the Department under Cap had worn thin on the Hill. I don’t mean to be critical of Cap Weinberger. I called him and Frank Carlucci right after the Gulf War and thanked them for what they’d done to create the force that we used in 1989. I even called former President Reagan that same day and thanked him.\n\nTraditionally I was a big supporter of the military as Secretary and as a Congressman, voted for most of the budgets and programs, got involved a bit in the military reform movement through Newt Gingrich. Newt was a classmate of mine. We’d gotten elected together; we were good friends. One of the things that Newt did in the ’80s before he got into the leadership was he was working the military reform axis. I didn’t like everything about the military reform caucus, like Barbara Boxer, for example. Barbara is not one of my favorite people. There were people who really didn’t like the military, never supported it, who would use the reform caucus for their own purposes. But there were a lot of us on the Hill who were strongly supportive of the military and the Administration and the Defense Department, who nonetheless thought there were problems.\n\nAnd Goldwater-Nichols came along. I won’t bore you with all the details there. I thought it was a good piece of legislation. I believe I co-sponsored it in the House, voted for it. My friend Frank Carlucci didn’t like that. Frank and I, I remember, had a conversation at one point. The Administration, especially the guys in the Pentagon—Weinberger and Carlucci—were adamantly opposed to the Goldwater-Nichols. I think it was felt by them that this was unnecessary interference by the Congress with the executive. [I remember] saying I had a predilection for the executive ordinarily and in these kinds of conflicts I’d come down on the side of the executive branch, but this was on the heels of Lebanon and Grenada.\n\nI’d been involved when the Grenada operation went down. I was asked to join Bob Michel, Tom Foley, and a handful of other members on a bipartisan basis. We went to Grenada right after the operation; the troops were still mopping up when we got there. The more I looked at the Grenada operation, the more it was clear even here, where we’d had a relative success, got everybody out and so forth, that there were problems. The Army guy on the beach can’t talk to the ships at sea, so he’s using his AT&T credit card to call Fort Bragg, so they can put him in touch with the Navy in the Pentagon, so they can talk to the guy off the coast. Serious screw-ups. The Navy Seals had some serious problems. Just a lot of things that didn’t go right when you looked underneath the operation.\n\nSo there was a body of thought, some of it driven by people who didn’t like the military, but a body of thought as well by some people who really felt there was serious need to make some changes that generated that. I would put myself in that latter camp when I arrived and when I went down to the Pentagon. There was a guy named Colonel John Boyd. I don’t know if you’ve come across Boyd’s work. Again, Newt had introduced me to Boyd. Boyd had been a fighter pilot in Korea, OODA [Observe, Orient, Decide, Act] loops. I still remember, I spent hours listening to him as he went through his briefs on OODA loops. But there were some people you had to admire and who were thoughtful who could look at the Weinberger Pentagon and conclude that we’d burned up some relationships there. Cap had reached the point where he never said yes when anybody ever asked him to give him up anything. It was always, No, no, hell no. You couldn’t even negotiate with him.\n\nI was concerned about those kinds of problems when I went down. So one of the areas I’d carved out, I mentioned earlier, to be focused on was Congress. I felt I had to take on that responsibility and try to restore and rebuild some of those relationships. Goldwater-Nichols, I believe today, based on my own experience with it—we were really the first Administration to use it fairly extensively—that it was exactly what the doctor ordered. It was the right thing to have done for a lot of reasons, partly because it clarified the chain of command, the role of the CINCs. It made it possible for the chairman to function as the principal military advisor to the Secretary. The President was no longer in a position where you could only get the lowest common denominator of advice out of the Chiefs. We used it, I think, very effectively.\n\nZelikow\n\nCan I just interrupt with a specific factual question? When you would deal with the other Chiefs, did you do that through Powell or did you do that independently, directly with them?\n\nCheney\n\nBoth.\n\nZelikow\n\nAll right.\n\nCheney\n\nIt depended, lots of times. I dealt with Colin most of the time, because we deal with each other every day, direct line from my phone to his phone. He would be in my office sometimes several times a day; it was a very close working relationship. But I felt perfectly free and often did deal independently with the Chiefs. As a general practice, Tony McPeak would have me up for briefings where he would bring in some of his guys on a particular program or something they were interested in. I’d spend a couple of hours with the Air Force and the Air Force Chief. I’d go down and have lunch with the CNO [Chief of Naval Operations]. Carl Mundy felt free to come in.\n\nI mean, if the Chiefs wanted to see me one on one, I would see them. Frequently it would be the other way around, too. I’d want to interact with them for some reason.\n\nBetts\n\nWas there any pattern in your eyes to which of the services tended to give you the most heartburn over things, or the least?\n\nCheney\n\nLet me make a note here before I forget. Well, the conventional wisdom, shall we say—and I think this was reinforced by my experience—was when you’ve got some bad news to deliver, you need the services to do something, give up bases, for example, budget, whatever, the Army would salute smartly and try like hell to do it. The Navy would say, Hell no, no way. And the Air Force would do everything they could to convince you they were doing it, and then they’d do something else.\n\nThat’s probably overly crude, probably not fair to everybody involved, and it turned a lot on personalities and also what I was asking them to do. The general arrangement I had with General Powell was that in terms of giving directives—the operational use of the force, dealing with the CINC, for example—I would always go through him. Didn’t have to, that was our option. Under Goldwater-Nichols I could go direct to the CINC if I wanted, but I would refrain from reaching around him to go to the CINC when I was passing something down. I wanted it all to go down through him. I wanted him to have some pretty tight control of that.\n\nI did not want a single channel coming up. I wanted multiple sources of information coming up. I did not want him to be the screen for information coming to the Secretary from the military. There were a couple of times when that got a little tense, which Colin will tell you too. I used my military assistants an awful lot as a source of information or to go pulse the system and generate stuff I needed. I had three great ones. I inherited Bill Owens when I got there. Bill, of course, later became vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, one of the most creative guys I ever got around. I inherited him from Carlucci. Superb guy, Rhodes scholar, nuclear submariner.\n\nThen when Bill got ready to move on—we sent him out to Sixth Fleet—I went to Tom Kelly. Tom was the J3 on the Joint staff, Army three-star. This was summer of ’91, shortly before the Iraq thing started—\n\nZelikow\n\nSummer of ’90?\n\nCheney\n\nYes, ’90. I called Tom in one day and said, Who’s the best one-star in the U.S. Army? I want to make him my military assistant. I had had a Navy guy, probably ought to rotate. The services all nominate. They’ve all got their guy they want on that job, because they want nothing better than to have their brightest young one-star sitting up there at the right hand of the Secretary. But I didn’t want their guy, I wanted my guy in that job and I wanted somebody off the Joint staff. I wanted somebody who had those ties and connections. The direction we’d gone in, the emphasis on Joint, the Goldwater-Nichols, all the rest of it, what I needed was to make sure I had good access to the Joint staff as well. I wanted somebody who came out of that background.\n\nOne of the things that General Powell and I had done was to make sure, when we got people assigned to the Joint staff, that they had a billet back home and that they were going to move up. This wasn’t the end of a guy’s career. You didn’t bury him by sending him to Joint staff. We wanted the best and brightest to come to the Joint staff, and that they’d then have a place to go when their tour was up, and we made that stick.\n\nBut anyway, I called Tom Kelly and said, Who’s the best one-star in the Army? He said, Joe Lopez. I said, Wait a minute, Lopez is Navy. He said, You want Lopez. That was a hell of a recommendation. So I called Joe Lopez in. I knew him; he was working for Kelly down on the Joint staff, but I called Joe in and interviewed him and hired him. Great choice. Did a fantastic job. He’s now working for us here at Halliburton since he returned from the Navy a year ago. Then when Lopez left, I went and got John Jumper, an Air Force in this case. Again, I’d seen John operate during the Gulf War on the Joint staff, and then we pulled him out of there. He just took over the air combat command for the Air Force down at Langley, got his fourth star. Doing a hell of a job too.\n\nThe three of them, very different backgrounds, very talented individuals and enormously valuable to me. All of them eventually went on to get their four stars and had major assignments and did yeoman duty. But I used them extensively when the balloon first went up in the Gulf and Iraq invaded Kuwait to begin to generate options and pull up options for what we might do. I could send Owens and Lopez down around, say, Go tell me, find out for me, what’s the Navy got on this? Stuff I wanted from the Joint staff too, but I wasn’t getting enough and I wasn’t getting it fast enough. Then you could use the military assistants for that. They also had a requirement. They had to go to the POAC once a week—the Pentagon Officers Athletic Club—because that’s where you found out what the hell was really going on in the building. Lopez would go down there at least once a week and hang out in the gym, work out with the guys, take showers, whatever. That was a vital piece of information, whatever was being passed around the POAC.\n\nIn terms of the relationships with the military, there were a couple who have gotten a lot of press commentary. You guys had some clips in there on the Larry Welch affair. When I arrived, first press conference I had when I’d been there about a week, my first meeting with the press, that morning there was a story in the Washington Post that had a picture of Larry and a prominent story about him on the Hill negotiating on strategic missiles, ballistic missiles. How we were going to go there earlier. I was asked a question about that at my press conference, and I basically said that he’d been freelancing. He’d been up there without my approval.\n\nNow in fairness to Welch, at the time it was a very good signal to send around the building. It was a target of opportunity if you wanted to sort of reassert civilian control. Part of the difficulty was during the Tower nomination fight, nobody had been in charge. Carlucci had left January 20th. Will Taft was still there as the deputy, but he’s part of the old guard on his way out. Then there was a real vacuum at the top of the building. Larry was doing what he needed to do. He was worried about the future of the program; he’s out dealing with the Congress. I always felt afterwards that he got a bit of a bum rap out of that. He was clearly not happy.\n\nBetts\n\nBut you did see it as a way to send a signal?\n\nCheney\n\nAbsolutely. You start to define what the boundaries are. And I did not want, as a general matter, the Air Force Chief of Staff up there cutting deals on something as vital as the future of our strategic weapons system, and Peacekeeper missiles versus single-warhead Midgetman, and all the rest of the stuff. Those are presidential-level decisions and certainly secretarial-level decisions, and they don’t get made independently by the services.\n\nNow there was a unique set of circumstances that led Larry to be up there doing what he was doing. I think eventually I repaired the relationship and we got along fine. I have a lot of respect for him—it was a different deal with Dugan—but I thought it was important. As a matter of management, again, the reputation on Cap was that he did not assert authority over the military. That he sat on top of the building, but that he had never really—he had a big impact and he did good work. He went out and got the resources they needed to rebuild the military at the time they needed them. There was a lot of respect for him, but he had never hammered anybody. He had never really asserted his will inside the building, or at least that was the rap on him on the Hill. It might not have been a true statement.\n\nI think lots of times, rather than send everybody a memo, sometimes a signal like the one I sent that day has a much bigger effect. The other one that had an enormous effect, obviously, was when I fired Dugan. Again, you say it’s business, it’s not personal. I’d met Mike Dugan when I was on the Intelligence Committee. He used to come up occasionally and brief us up there when he was a two-star, very bright guy. When Larry Welch got ready to retire, we had two candidates to be the Air Force chief: One was Mike Dugan and the other was Tony McPeak. Tony was an F-15 driver, a fighter pilot’s fighter pilot, but from a different sort of wing of the Air Force, if you will, than Dugan was. Dugan I think was much more cerebral, probably more intelligent. Both Welch and Don Rice, who was the Air Force secretary, wanted Dugan.\n\nI interviewed both of them and in the end decided to go with Dugan, based on the recommendation I’d gotten from Rice and from Larry Welch. He had only been on board a couple of months when the Gulf crisis developed and then he went off on a trip to the Gulf. This must have been early September of ’90. Contrary to advice, he took some reporters with him. Pete Williams, I think, had been involved and said, Look, you don’t need to haul reporters with you on the plane. There are a lot of them over there already. But Dugan went ahead, and he had, I think, a Washington Post reporter and maybe John Broder from the L.A. Times, two or three journalists. Spent 14 hours with them in the airplane on the way back.\n\nNow I don’t care who you are, if you spend 14 hours with a reporter, you’re going to get in trouble of some kind. What emerged out of that was a front-page story in the Washington Post that I thought went over the top. It ran on a Sunday morning. I got up and read it, made me mad. So I put it aside, went down and took a walk on the C&O Canal and cooled off. Came back, read the article over again, made me mad all over again.\n\nThe problem with it, it portrayed this notion that somehow the Air Force was going to win the war all by themselves. He got into talking about targeting and how we are going to go after Saddam’s [Hussein] mistress, things that just were inappropriate. The thing that bothered me, I think, most of all was this notion that somehow the chief could go running off to the Gulf and then come back. We’re trying to emphasize jointness. We’ve got a CINC; we’ve got a command structure there in place. He’s not even in the chain of command; he’s the Air Force chief. He’s got no operating role in terms of the deployment and use of the force. Here we are with this story all over the deal, and we’ve got some little service rivalry in there, and the ground troops may be needed, but they’ll be able to walk right in after we take care of them with the Air Force.\n\nSo I called the President up at Camp David, got him off the tennis court and told him I had a real problem with the Dugan story and that I might have to relieve him. That I was going to call him in the next morning, Monday morning, and just wanted to give this warning to the President in advance, make sure he didn’t have any trouble with it. I mean, it is a presidential appointment. He said, Whatever you need to do, Dick, is fine by me. Just let me know which way it goes. So I had Dugan lined up to report the next morning. I had Don Atwood sit in with me. General Powell came in shortly before Dugan did and I told Colin what I was going to do. Then he left. General Dugan came in. I asked him if the story—\n\nZelikow\n\nMay I just interject, did Colin make a recommendation?\n\nCheney\n\nNo. I think he was a little hesitant. I always thought Colin thought I hit Dugan too hard, that he would have argued for more moderation on my part. Never objected, I’m just reading between the lines. I think he was surprised that I moved as quickly as I did to get rid of Dugan. But I had Mike in, asked him if in fact the story was accurate. He said, yes, basically it was. I said, I need your resignation. You’re relieved. End of story. He left. We had Tony McPeak in the wings, brought Tony in. He took over as chief.\n\nThere was a funny follow-on story to it. A couple of weeks later we had a meeting of all the Air Force four-stars and retired four-stars. They have a small club that meets periodically, comes down and the incumbent chief briefs all the former chiefs and top commanders of the Air Force. Tony invited me to come up and speak to the assembled group. General Dugan’s in the audience; he’s one of them. He is now a retired four-star. And he’s sitting there alongside all the former chiefs and all the other former four-stars of the United States Air Force. Tony got up in front of the group and said, Gentlemen, we’ve got the Secretary of Defense here today to talk to us. He wasn’t the President’s first choice to be Secretary of Defense either. Absolutely broke the place up. Got everything off to a good start, back on the right track. But the Dugan thing was important.\n\nZelikow\n\nWhen you relieved Dugan, did you make your case to him as to why you thought this had been bad, or did you just give him the news and let him work out why you were making this decision?\n\nCheney\n\nI think he knew when he walked in that he’d gone beyond the pale. I did not spend a lot of time arguing with him.\n\nZelikow\n\nOkay.\n\nCheney\n\nWhat I wanted to confirm was that he in fact had said what was in the press. You know, you don’t always believe everything you read in the newspapers. He did, and so I relieved him. I said that I thought that was inappropriate. I’d made a speech that day—well I held a press briefing, I think, later on that morning and answered a lot of press questions on why I did why I did. That’s all on the record.\n\nBetts\n\nWas this all just on the merits of what he had done, or was there any other element in this case too, sort of sending a signal at a crucial time of reminding people who’s in charge and all that?\n\nCheney\n\nNo, I thought the action stood on its own merits. But I also, I think it had very positive benefits and consequences. That’s a very rare occurrence, that somebody fires a member of the Joint Chiefs.\n\nBetts\n\nFirst in 40 years.\n\nCheney\n\nIt does not happen. It served once again to reinforce, and as I say, I did a press briefing afterwards, which I’m sure there’s a transcript of, that lays out in some detail what my concerns were. That was all public and it sent a hell of a message. You know, I’m not sure, there was a lot of chatter in the POAC after the word came down that Dugan had gone to the Gulf, came back, got his picture on the front page of the newspaper, and he was toast, he was gone.\n\nI think it set the right tone for the way I wanted to conduct those operations. It was part of maintaining what I call the integrity of the chain of command, which was a very important consideration for us and, as you know, a complete separate subject in itself. But the chain of command ran from the President to the Secretary, down to the CINC. And, if I wished, through the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, which I so designated. And everybody else in the building, I mean everybody—the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Chief of Naval Operations—not in the chain of command. It was partly reinforcing the whole concept of Goldwater-Nicholson, we weren’t going to have a situation where everybody and his brother feels free to go operate in the Gulf. It was part and parcel of the system we had in place, where no units could deploy over there unless the CINC had requested them and signed up to it. We reinforced that idea. Colin reinforced it as well.\n\nWe kept all of the people in Washington who want to give you military advice when you deploy the force in their proper roles. We didn’t have the State Department coming over, picking targets of what we were going to hit. We didn’t get undue interference from the West Wing of the White House or the NSC staff, trying to do what essentially was the military function and responsibility. And the Dugan thing, in making certain that everybody understood that this was going to be a joint operation. We were going to function that way accordingly and we weren’t going to have a lot of high ranking officers out freelancing to the press. It was a very important message to get across. I didn’t have to go—I mean, Dugan was a gift, from that perspective. There would have been other ways to do it if that hadn’t happened, but it happened.\n\nIt was an unpleasant business too. Nobody likes to fire someone. Mike Dugan, hell, he had a distinguished career: He had risen to the peak; he’s now the Air Force Chief of Staff. To say it wasn’t personal, it was business, but I thought it was the right response.\n\nBetts\n\nIn a number of ways you’ve indicated that you were more of an activist leader in this role than somebody like Weinberger, who dominated a lot of recent memory in the Department. Did you have any sense that there was any discomfort or resentment of that change among the professional military? One doesn’t get the sense on the outside that you were criticized for micromanagement the way somebody like [Robert] McNamara was, but you do seem to have taken a much stronger role in imposing your will downwards than some of your predecessors.\n\nCheney\n\nThey never said anything to me.\n\nBetts\n\nI guess they got the message.\n\nCheney\n\nI wouldn’t expect them to. I think most of the military agreed with what I did or at least were willing to take that on board. It was probably not anything they had anticipated, but I think a lot of them thought about it, reflected on it, and said, Okay, those are the rules and we’ll play by the rules. As I say, nobody ever came to me and was critical of that action, but you wouldn’t expect them to do that or respond in that way.\n\nAs I say, Colin never said any word after that initial time. I always had the feeling when he left that morning that he was surprised that I was going to put the hammer down on Dugan, but never argued with him.\n\nMcCall\n\nThere was something not quite to that scale, but before Christmas in ’90, when there was speculation about the timetable for the launch of the air campaign and there was also speculation on when ground forces were going to be ready. Perhaps this is the time of trying to get in the last elements on the ground. Of course, out of the field comes—in the press—differing notions of when the troops are going to be ready. And, I think, do both you and Powell go over to handle it? Can you link that experience with—\n\nCheney\n\nWhat happened here, I mean, we haven’t even talked about Norm Schwarzkopf yet. Norm’s a whole book in himself. This is on one of our trips over there and I can’t remember—in December we went over. Then we were trying to nail down the start date for the air war. The diplomatic thing had been squared away with the UN and so forth. We came back and met with the President up at Camp David, as I recall. This is shortly before Christmas. At that point, that’s when we set the H-hour, if you will, for the onset of the air war.\n\nThen we were back over after the air war had started. This is probably late January, early February. It was one of those trips where basically what happened was Cal Waller—Cal was the deputy commander, the deputy CINC in effect—and Cal was relatively new to the theater. He made a statement that the force wasn’t going to be ready by next day. He was talking about the ground force, and that was true. They were still feeding in the theater, the decision that had been made back in October in terms of doubling the size of the force and all the additional deployments, there was still going to be some time before they were ready to go and that’s what he had reference to.\n\nThe press, as the press often does, got it kind of screwed up. I think some people took this as saying we weren’t going to be ready to launch the air war until later. That wasn’t true. We accepted and tolerated the little bit of chaos that was built into the system partly because Cal was new, partly because it wasn’t all that bad having confusion in Saddam’s mind as to what the hell was going to happen when, and partly because Waller was put there for a unique reason. This was another case where we sort of violated tradition. Tradition would have been you have an Army CINC, you’re going to have somebody from another service as the number two. We didn’t. We went out to Fort Lewis and got Waller, an Army general, and put him under an Army general, even though there was a little bit of flack about that.\n\nWe did it because Waller had worked for Schwarzkopf before. This is about the third time Cal had worked under Norm. Though I love Norm Schwarzkopf, he’s a great American, did a hell of a job for us, he’s not the easiest guy in the world to work for. He can be an absolute terror in terms of his people who work underneath him. He has a tendency to be volatile, emotional, and explode at people. He gets over it quickly, but you really need a bit of a buffer there. One of the things we did was to put Cal Waller into that slot because he knew how to manage Norm’s occasional outburst. That’s why he was there. He wasn’t all that happy about having to do that.\n\nBetts\n\nIt wasn’t a planned deception, though.\n\nCheney\n\nNo.\n\nBetts\n\nI’d always hoped it was.\n\nCheney\n\nNo, we weren’t that well organized. We did do some deception, but that wasn’t part of it. Part of my job, coming back again to the civil-military thing, I think one of the Secretary’s responsibilities is when you get ready to do one of these operations, first thing you better make sure of is that you’ve got the right guy to command it. History, our history, is replete with the difficulties Presidents and former Secretaries have had on that very point. In the case of Panama we concluded we weren’t happy with the leadership in Panama, the CINC in South-COM. So I replaced him.\n\nZelikow\n\nYou’re talking now about—\n\nCheney\n\n[Frederick] Woerner.\n\nZelikow\n\nThe assignment of [Max] Thurman in place of Woerner in May of ’89.\n\nCheney\n\nSent Max Thurman down. This is something that was worked out with Brent; Brent felt strongly about it too. There was just a feeling in the Panama situation—that’s a separate subject—but Woerner could find an excuse not to do anything in Panama. We had continuing problems in relationships down there. So after a conversation with Brent, I called Woerner in and relieved him. Then sent Max Thurman, who was getting ready to retire, who I think was a giant in the Army and had really done some phenomenally good things. I asked Max to go down and take on the assignment. He did and within a matter of months it was all wrapped up. [Manuel] Noriega was in prison in Miami and the problem was solved.\n\nThere were a lot of other things that went into it. But when it came time to do the Iraqi Gulf crisis, one of the first decisions I had to make was whether or not we wanted Schwarzkopf in that role or whether I wanted somebody else. I thought long and hard about it. That’s one where I spent a lot of time talking to General Powell. I didn’t know Norm that well. He’d been the CENTCOM [Central Command] CINC for a period of time before I arrived. I met with him a few times, usually in a larger group, but I didn’t really have strong personal feelings about it. He was with us the first weekend of the Gulf crisis. He was part of the party when I flew out to meet with King Fahd in Saudi Arabia that weekend. He was on the plane with me. But as I say, Norm had a reputation, a reputation as a guy who was very, very hard on his subordinates. My basic question to Colin was, Is this the right guy or should I pull the plug on him and get somebody else?\n\nBetts\n\nWas there anybody else in contention in your mind or was it just doubts about Schwarzkopf?\n\nCheney\n\nNo, I had the general view, and I still do to this day, that we had dozens of officers who could fill those slots, really, really talented people. Without taking anything away from a Colin Powell or a Norm Schwarzkopf or any of the other guys who gained legitimate recognition for what they did, we had a lot of other guys you could have plugged into those slots who would have done very, very well in those assignments. That was one of the things that I was always struck by during my time there. The senior military leadership these days is very good.\n\nSo as I say, that was a very conscious decision. It was primarily on Colin’s recommendation that he could work with him and we could keep it all stitched together. And Norm had some great strengths, he did a hell of a job with the public, he had enormous tolerance for dealing with allies. He’s got 37 different people over there, the Senegalese and the Moroccans. Everybody and his brother sending troops but they don’t have any logistic support, very limited military capability. Every time the State Department would go get another contingent from Burundi, you know, we’d have to take care of it. And Norm did all that; he managed all that stuff very well. He was great with the press and so forth.\n\nWhen you put all that together, managing that coalition, he did a hell of a job. But like all of us, you’ve got strengths and weaknesses. One of his weaknesses was that he was a real SOB to his staff, and he needed somebody like a Cal Waller there to sort of absorb that abuse. Which wasn’t fair to Cal, but Cal had been there before to make it all work.\n\nBetts\n\nIn that period, did you have a sense of trouble from your perspective about Air Force relationships with Schwarzkopf and Powell and the Air Force, as you put it, planning to win the war all on their own? Certainly at the planning level there was a lot of tension. Was that more or less handled by Powell and the military chain of command, or did you have to deal with it?\n\nCheney\n\nNo, I got into it some.\n\nZelikow\n\nThere is a subset of that too, which is that there are actually factions inside the Air Force. It’s not just Air Force versus CENTCOM; it’s factions inside the Air Force. One of those factions being allied with the air commander at CENTCOM.\n\nCheney\n\nYep. I mean we had Checkmate, for example. You’re familiar with the Checkmate Operation, down in the bowels of the Pentagon, did an awful lot of the targeting. This stuff would then feed out through the theater where it needed to be and then get worked into the operation. I was always amazed—I mean, there is a great anecdote about Buster Glosson. General Glosson when I arrived was a one-star Air Force general who was working the congressional relations shop in the Secretary’s office and had been there a long time. Welch disliked him intensely. My guys came in—and I had a new assistant secretary, had been my top staff guy on the Hill and so forth—so it was time to move General Glosson out. Somehow he had managed over the years to offend the powers that be in the Air Force and so they shipped him out. They looked for a place where they could bury him.\n\nWhen I show up, by this time it’s mid-August. It’s my second trip to the Gulf after the crisis. I stop in Bahrain and I go to the Navy command ship, the fleet command ship there, where it’s docked in Bahrain. I’m walking across the deck and getting ready to go downstairs for a briefing and I hear somebody yell, Hey, Mr. Secretary. I turn around and look and it’s Buster Glosson, General Glosson, they shipped him out to Bahrain. I don’t think there was another Air Force officer within a thousand miles of there, certainly not one of their airplanes. They thought they’d buried him. [Laughter] This is early 1990. He ends up running the air war; he was in charge. I think he eventually got his third star. He was subsequently retired. It was a classic case of taking a guy they thought they were getting rid of and moving out here, but he was there. He was good. Did a hell of a job, worked for Chuck Horner.\n\nSo there were problems inside the command structure, without question. Frictions and so forth there. A certain amount of that you have to tolerate, and a certain amount of that, from my perspective, I didn’t need to worry about. If it got too nasty or too messy, I’d hear about it. General Powell might bring something to me. In terms of managing that relationship between Colin and Norm, that was really for the two of them to sort out. If it didn’t work then I’d have to intervene. So when you went farther on down the ranks, you know, stuff happens. You have got your model for how you want things to work and who ought to be doing what to whom. But I would, periodically, go down to the Checkmate Operation in the basement of the Pentagon. That was not by any means an official channel, but it was another source of information for me about what was going on and how we were doing picking our targets and bomb damage assessment and those kinds of issues. So I made it a point to go down there periodically and get a feel for that.\n\nThe air war is the one place where I intervened and overrode the CINC in the conduct of the operation. The problem we had were the SCUDs. We had made a decision, obviously, that we wanted to keep the Israelis out of the conflict. The SCUDs were a direct threat to Israel. In order to keep the Israelis out, it was necessary for me to be able to say every day—because I talked on the phone every day to Moshe Arens, the Israeli defense chief; I had a secure line set up between our offices. In order to justify not allowing them in and to keep them out, we had to be able to say to them and demonstrate to them that we were doing everything we could to deal with the SCUD threat. That involved reallocating some of our air assets off the targets in Baghdad and putting them out in the western desert, trying to hunt down SCUDs.\n\nNow from Norm’s standpoint, that was a waste of assets. Israel wasn’t in his theater. Israel was excluded from central command; it was part of the European command. The SCUDs weren’t doing a lot of damage. Knocking down a few houses, but it was no big thing until later, obviously, when we lost 28 people in that one attack in Saudi. But from his perspective, he’s got a mission; he’s got a plan. He’s got assets; he’s applying his assets to his targets. The last thing he wants is to take a bunch of F-15s off of the Baghdad targets and instead put them out in the western desert. I intervened.\n\nThe President knew what I was going to do and required him to reallocate those resources. Then got a report every day on exactly how many missions we’d flown the night before, who was flying them and so forth, so that I could go back to Arens and say, Look, here’s what we’ve done. These are the steps we’ve taken, to keep the Israelis out. Viewed at the CINC’s level, he had one set of priorities. But from a strategic level and the standpoint of keeping the coalition together and avoiding the train wreck that would have occurred if the Israelis had intervened, it was very important that we make that reallocation. So that was a case, where, as I say, with the approval of the President—he knew what I was doing—I intervened and forced reallocation of assets.\n\nZelikow\n\nYou intervened through Powell?\n\nCheney\n\nYep. We’d be on the phone—\n\nZelikow\n\nOr would you go directly to Schwarzkopf?\n\nCheney\n\nI would go through Colin, or both of us would get on the phone together and talk to Norm.\n\nMcCall\n\nDid that extend beyond the F-15s to the other assets that were being deployed out there?\n\nCheney\n\nYes. I mean, I got personally involved in the use of some of our Special Ops teams. Norm wasn’t very big on, he really had a strong bias against our Special Ops guys. Didn’t like them. Not an unconventional kind of attitude from the standpoint of some in the military. But we’d worked with them previously. Wayne Downing was the guy, I’d dealt with him directly on a number of occasions. We’d done the planning for Panama, for example, and I’d watched him in operation there. I had a lot of confidence in him and I thought they were appropriate for us to use. The Brits had started before we did, really. Norm finally bought off on that as well. But I pushed it and nudged it along to get Downing—\n\nZelikow\n\nThe Brits with their SAS [Special Air Services], with their special operating, yes.\n\nMcCall\n\nWas there a similar situation with Panama? The reason I ask this is part of what happened with Panama was that there was a lot of force allocation out there that was, shall we say, unnecessary. Did you find you had to override—?\n\nCheney\n\nStealth bombers.\n\nMcCall\n\nWe had forces coming from everywhere.\n\nCheney\n\nWell, what happened in Panama. Panama was a great training experience for us as an Administration. We had the opportunity to have an objective, have to use force, coordinate with the Congress, deal with the public, all of those things that come with using the force. It was really the first time we’d done it as an Administration and we learned from that. I looked at the Panama operation, I remember going over the plans and raising questions. You’re going to fly 117s to Panama? I said, How tough is the Panamanian air defense system? Do they even have one? In the end, the argument of course was that they wanted to drop these weapons to stun the Panamanian forces. It was a lot of hooey. They finally cut the size of the deployment, but I think they flew two aircraft down there, did fly a mission and claimed great accuracy, which turned out not to be true: they missed when they got there.\n\nSo there were, I think, probably some excesses in connection with Panama. You know, you can make the argument in the case of Desert Storm that we used a hell of a lot of force and did we really need all of those. But that’s a whole separate story. It’s an important part of the civil-military thing if you want to get into it. It’s down the chronology a ways, in terms of the Desert Storm scenario itself. I can do it right now if you want, if it fits with your priorities.\n\nMcCall\n\nCan I ask one follow up on the Panama. One of the other issues, it’s not just the 117s in Panama, there is a lot of inter-service rivalry about what assets are going to be allocated down there. You have pieces of everything being brought in.\n\nCheney\n\nWell hell, there was a small contingent—\n\nMcCall\n\nDid you have to adjudicate that?\n\nCheney\n\nThere was a small contingent of Marines that were already on the ground. Marines are the only ones with rubber-tired armored vehicles. The Army doesn’t have—didn’t have then—any rubber-tired armored vehicles. You didn’t really need Abrams tanks, though we ended up using M-113s. You had a unique situation in Panama because you had a lot of stuff already on the ground there. You had a permanent presence in Panama under our rights under the treaty, which had been there for a long time, so you were routinely rotating folks down there.\n\nNow partly what we did, once we got Max Thurman in place, as we went in, we’d been through this exercise about the first of October—was the day that Colin Powell came on board, we had this abortive coup. We had gotten word that there was going to be a coup attempt. We scurried around on it. By the time, we weren’t even able to make a decision as an Administration as to how we were going to respond to that. There had been some response down at the local level, at the theater level. But by then the guy had made the attempt to place Noriega under arrest, Noriega reversed the tables and shot him and it was all over with. Partly that led to a couple of things. It led, one thing, to the tightening up of our interagency processes. The increased reliance on the deputy’s group, the fact that we had been slow and hadn’t reacted fast enough on that particular case.\n\nBut it also led to, as Max took over down there, he asked for a lot of stuff and we put a lot of stuff in there. Partly, I think, because of a why not send enough mindset. That comes back later, and we’ll talk about in connection with Desert Storm, but there is always competition among the services to get in there. But again, nothing went in there unless Max had signed off on it. We ran a pretty tight ship among Max and General Powell and myself as we did the operation. And you know, the PDF [Panamanian Defense Forces] turned out not to be all that formidable a force. But we didn’t screw around. We did their Commendancia with C-130 gun ships. That was a very direct, very aggressive, Yes, we could probably do it with less force and less violence, but why screw around?\n\nBetts\n\nYou brought up the coup attempt and it sounded as if, from your point of view, you really didn’t have a chance to decide completely. From other reports, it seemed like there was a deliberate decision not to get involved. I was sort of curious about what you remember from those discussions and what the determining factor was. For example, one thing I’ve heard but never seen anywhere in print—I heard from someone on the NSC staff—was that there was some concern about the assassination ban. That U.S. support for the coup could wind up being interpreted as complicit in Noriega’s assassination if that happened. Do you recall that as an issue?\n\nCheney\n\nNo, I don’t recall. What happened from my perspective, I had Marshal [Dimitri]Yazov in town, the Soviet defense minister. I was hosting him and I had decided—you know, every time I went over there they took me out to another battlefield or another cemetery where they’d buried thousands of troops. I took him to Gettysburg. We got a guy, an historian up there at Carlisle War College who is a superb historian of the Gettysburg battle. Put all the Soviets on the bus and drove around all day on the bus and did a tour of the Gettysburg battlefield, which was superb. But in the middle of all of that—I had Bill Owens sitting behind me on the bus and Yazov is on my right—Bill said I had a call from General Powell. It was Colin’s first day on the job. I said, Pass the cell phone up to me. I used the cell phone to talk to General Powell. The thing that just stunned Yazov was that cell phone. He’d never seen anything like that in his life. But this was the phone call about the Panama situation.\n\nWe were disorganized, out of place. I’m up running around in Gettysburg. General Powell has just been sworn in; he’s the brand new chairman. I don’t know where the hell Baker was. We didn’t react well to it and it bothered us a lot. What it led to, as I say, was a real strengthening of the processes. The deputies committee in particular and the way they worked and coordinated the number twos, Wolfowitz, [Robert] Gates, people like that who were able to function so that we could operate better. We learned from the Panamanian experience, both the failure when the coup attempt came in October as well as when we finally did the operation in December. We learned a lot as a team, how to work, how to function, what the issues were you’re going to have to deal with.\n\nOne of the real problems you have with any new Administration, even one as experienced as ours was—I mean, we weren’t a bunch of amateurs, we’d been around there before—it’s hard. You know, there is no training ground for senior civilian political leaders in an Administration. We were lucky. We had a President who had been schooled in it for years. I’d been White House Chief of Staff. Scowcroft was doing the NSC job for the second time. We used to joke he was going to have keep doing it until he got it right. Baker had been Chief of Staff and Secretary of Treasury and now State. General Powell’s background. This was a pretty experienced crew.\n\nBut even then, we weren’t as good as we needed to be. There isn’t any process today by which the new team, when they come on board, get any of that experience. What you do is you bring in the President-elect and you brief him on the SIOP [Single Integrated Operational Plan], scare the hell out of him, and then everybody goes home. End of story. He puts a team in place, and if you’re lucky, you get an operation like we had in Panama, which let us test some things and build relationships and develop understandings and procedures that stood us in good stead then a year later when we had to do Iraq. But we were lucky.\n\nI’ve come back again, trying to focus on your civil-military questions. Brent and I used to talk in the run-up to Desert Storm about our reluctant generals. You helped him with the book, does he write about that, he and the President—\n\nMcCall\n\n[George Brinton] McClellan.\n\nCheney\n\nMcClellan. Brent’s too nice.\n\nBetts\n\nBob Gates’s line, I think, McClellan lives.\n\nCheney\n\nBut it was understandable, partly because of the Vietnam legacy. When the Gulf crisis first started, there were two camps. There were those of us who believed this really was a major strategic threat to the U.S., we couldn’t afford to have Saddam dominate the Gulf. The other school of thought was more a matter of, Kuwait, who cares about Kuwait? It’s a little bitty country over there in the Gulf. Most of their citizens live in the south of France anyway. Why should we get exercised about Kuwait? Of course, the former view was the one that eventually prevailed and I think was the right one. But there was a certain hesitation in the system in terms of offering up options initially, because I think they weren’t quite sure what we’d do with them. I’m talking here a matter of hours or a few days.\n\nBy the time we get to Camp David that first weekend, we’ve got the stuff starting to flow pretty good. But as we went through the fall and we did the initial deployment and then we got ready to go, trying to think about how we were going to use the force, we sort of begin to transition from defense to offense. And thinking about liberating Kuwait, there was a concern—that was my experience and Brent’s experience as well—that we weren’t getting the kind of forward-leaning posture we wanted in terms of military planning. I think from the standpoint of the military, partly based on their Vietnam experience—again, I heard my friend Jack Leighty mentioned just last night—they didn’t know quite what to make of this new crowd. The last time we’d been through one of these drills, back in Vietnam, civilians had screwed it up, at least that was the conventional wisdom.\n\nSo there were questions about were we really committed to doing it, would we do it right, would we use enough force, would we try to second guess what ought to be military decisions in terms of selecting targets and so forth. Did the President have the balls to call out the Reserves? We had to address those questions as we went through the early stages of the Gulf crisis. Our reaction to the first proposals that we got when we told Norm to give us a plan for aggressively, offensively using the forces to liberate Kuwait. We got the air war plan pretty good, the one we eventually used, at least the broad outlines of it. Totally unhappy with the ground war plan. So was Norm; he didn’t like it either. His last chart on the briefing was that he didn’t care for it, but it was basically fairly conservative and went right straight up the middle into Kuwait. I think the argument then from them was that they didn’t have enough force to defend Saudi and reach around and do something else.\n\nSo we had a meeting at the White House where we reviewed those plans down in the Situation Room. The President was there. We all concluded—Brent, myself, the President, and I think Jim—that we didn’t have it yet; we didn’t have the plan. The conclusion was that we’d send Colin back out to the Gulf to meet with Norm and get an answer to the question, Norm, what do you have to have? What are you going to need to be comfortable undertaking offensive military actions to liberate Kuwait? Colin went out; he came back. Another meeting in the White House. He said, We want 7th Corps out of Germany. We want the 1st Infantry Division out of Fort Riley, Kansas. We want another Marine division. We want six aircraft carriers, et cetera. I mean, hell of a shopping list. Sat there and said, Okay, you got it. Now what the hell are you going to do with it? That was sort of the ultimate test. I think from that point on, things began to flow pretty well.\n\nThere were still differences of opinion. I think General Powell was always more conservative than I was in terms of reluctance to use the force, more willing to consider sanctions for a longer period of time. I arranged to take him back over one day. He wanted to make sure that the President had heard all of the pro-sanctions arguments. So I scheduled a session with the President one day and took General Powell with me. We went in and sat down in the Oval Office and Colin made all the arguments. Not so much of, This is what I believe, but rather, This is one scenario. You might want to make sure you’ve considered it and thought about this. And of course, you had Congress, a lot of the members of Congress advocating sanctions as a course of action during that period of time.\n\nZelikow\n\nAbout what time would that be, that work that you’re talking about? Powell trying to make sure that the President understands the arguments? Would this be October or would this even be later than that?\n\nCheney\n\nI think this is probably later than that.\n\nBetts\n\nThis ties up with another question I had and that was when could you identify the point that there was a decision for war. For example, the whole set of issues involved in Reserve call-ups and then the decision around October not to rotate the forces. It seemed from the outside that that decision was probably tantamount to a decision for war. Was that the way it seemed at your end?\n\nCheney\n\nI’d back it up even earlier than that. There was never any doubt in my mind, from the very earliest days, and I think Brent would say the same thing, that if Saddam refused to leave, we were going to war. That the President made that decision. And I took what he said that very first weekend of the crisis, when he came back down—by then I was on my way to Saudi—but he came back down and got off the helicopter on a Sunday night from Camp David and announced, This aggression will not stand.\n\nFrom that point there was never any doubt in my mind that if we had to, we were ready to go. He was going to use the force. As I say, I always had the feeling Brent had the same basic understanding. There were others—I would put Baker and Powell in this camp—that weren’t there at that stage. We were still going to do a lot of diplomacy. It wasn’t that we had rejected diplomatic efforts or anything else. It was just that I was convinced that the President had made the decision. Then, if you come later on and look at deployments, the best way to enhance the prospects that he would withdraw was to put a hell of a lot of force over there. The best way to guarantee you could prevail if he didn’t withdraw was put a hell of a lot of force over there. It wasn’t an either/or kind of proposition in my mind.\n\nAnd there is no question, I knew exactly what I was doing when we went and got the Reserves, called up the Reserves. We put a stop/loss order out, nobody got out of the service. We stopped the rotation and I announced there will not be any rotation. You were going to deploy as units; you were going to come home as units when it was over with. And that sent a hell of a signal.\n\nThere were several different audiences. Obviously the military and the troops seemed fine with it. They all understood we were deadly serious and we really meant business. To the public, you could feel public support begin to build once they understood that we really were deadly serious, this was a serious problem. All of a sudden we are calling up Reservists from all over the country. Then Sam Nunn. I mean, Sam’s no fool. I can remember going up, having to testify before the Armed Services Committee. He very quickly put two and two together and said, Look, there isn’t any way you guys are going to leave a force of this size over there in the desert for a year or two while you’re waiting for sanctions to work. I mean, this is a go to war decision if he doesn’t get out. Yes, it is.\n\nBetts\n\nEarlier, towards the end of the summer, with the initial decisions on Reserve call-ups, do you recall if there was much concern about the timing of the call-ups due to the limitations on how long you could keep people without emergency declarations and things of that sort? Did that cause you to delay some call-ups?\n\nCheney\n\nNo. The Reserve call-ups, when I wanted them and got the President to sign the order, we thought about those kinds of issues. The place where it had an impact was the roundout brigades. We really didn’t get into difficulties with most of the Reserve call-ups, but the roundout brigades were a problem. The fact of the matter was that we had this theory, at least all the way through the ’80s, that you could take a heavy division and have two active brigades and then have a Reserve brigade that would be the roundout brigade that you’d deploy if you had to deploy them, and that you could call them up and go.\n\nIt first surfaced with the 24th Division and Norm Schwarzkopf directly. Norm did not want the roundout brigade of the 24th. Norm had commanded the 24th before and knew all about it. It was a division in the Georgia National Guard maybe, the brigade. He persuaded me—and he and Colin both did—that they weren’t ready to go, and they weren’t. They had a commander that we had to replace eventually, he had been there for essentially political reasons, They had 50-year-old tank commanders. They had not trained in anything approaching brigade size any time in recent history. They just weren’t ready to go. So what we ended up doing then was sending them to the desert, out to Fort Irwin to train.\n\nI took a lot of flak from the National Guard community, and especially the guys on the Hill who were big on this concept, but I made the decision that I wouldn’t send them, that I would listen to what Schwarzkopf and Powell had to say about it. We left them out. Now, I think that once they got to the desert, they got some training, they got some new leadership, I think they would have been perfectly capable of going and operating. Of course, by then the operation was over with. One of the lessons we learned in all of this was that the concept of roundout brigade, at least as it applies to the Army, is flawed.\n\nThe Marines had some Reserve tank units they called up, who performed very well. I think smaller size, different set of circumstances perhaps, different doctrine. But they didn’t encounter the problem that the Army did with the large roundout formations.\n\nBetts\n\nDo you recall much of the discussion about the danger of biological attack and what to do about it? There are some vague references in public to the threats conveyed about the letter that Baker gave to Tariq Aziz, I guess, and some other things.\n\nCheney\n\nAziz wouldn’t accept it.\n\nBetts\n\nBut the impression one gets from reading the secondary accounts is that there were these vague threats. Then, I believe it was Bush in his memoirs said that he decided he wouldn’t do it. In any case, was there much thought beyond that? Or was there just so much going on that people wrung their hands for a little bit and then moved on to other things?\n\nCheney\n\nNo, we spent quite a bit of time worrying about bugs and gas. John Jumper, who later became my military assistant, was the guy who was in charge of the horse up at Michigan State or wherever the hell it was that we used to produce anthrax. There was only one horse in America that could be used for that purpose and John was in big trouble if his horse died.\n\nWe knew he had both biological and chemical agents. We knew he had used chemical agents before on the Kurds, used them in the war with Iran. We didn’t know whether or not he had warheads for the SCUDs that contained chemical or biological agents. Turned out he did. We were really worried that he might launch one of those against Israel. And if he hit Israel with bugs or gas, then all bets were off. We weren’t going to be able to keep them out, obviously. But he didn’t, he never used it.\n\nWe spent time. We had a formulation that we used, that I used repeatedly in public with the press. People would ask about this, to the effect that if he uses biological or chemical agents against our troops, all bets are off and we reserve the right to use any means at our disposal to respond. That was specifically meant to keep him off balance and make sure he understood we might. Obviously we weren’t going to use chemical or biological agents. The threat clearly was that we’d use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons. I asked for—and had to ask a number of times—for there to be some planning done in the Joint staff about how we would react if in fact that happened. I said, I want to know how many tactical nuclear weapons will it take to destroy a division of the Iraqi Republican Guard. Here’s your divisions laid out there. You come back and tell me how many nukes. And the answer finally came back one day. We never got to the point obviously where we were—\n\nBetts\n\nAnd Powell said he had the study destroyed afterwards.\n\nCheney\n\nColin really didn’t want to give me those numbers. But I thought it was important we at least think about it. I would say, if I were to fault the military—and I don’t aim this as criticism at any one individual, it’s a hard subject for them to deal with because it’s sort of outside the box. You have a few units that think about weapons of mass destruction. But you know, for the guy commanding a division or who is dealing with his armor or infantry or whatever it might be, the whole idea of chemical and biological weapons has never been front and center as a specialty in the Army. It forces them to think about things they’re very uncomfortable thinking about. Now as I say, fortunately we didn’t get into a situation where we had to respond to that. But I was perfectly prepared, if I thought it had made sense, to recommend that we consider the use of tactical nuclear weapons if he’d done it.\n\nBetts\n\nThis wasn’t the subject of any long conversations between you and the President?\n\nCheney\n\nNo.\n\nZelikow\n\nThe subject of any conversations between you and the President?\n\nCheney\n\nI don’t recall any conversations. I’m sure he would have been briefed on the Iraqis’ biological and chemical capabilities and so on. It was my view, still is today, that if a foreign power uses weapons of mass destruction, biological or chemical agents against U.S. forces, that the American people would be perfectly prepared to tolerate the use of a tactical nuclear weapon. You would at least consider it. That’s the unthinkable. Again, I come back to the notion that that is far enough outside the box that it makes people nervous. But I wanted to have at least a little bit of information about what we were talking about if we went after some military targets that the Iraqis had. We never had to address that, so.\n\nZelikow\n\nIn a way I’m astonished at your modesty, because they have the stuff deployed in the forces, ready to use them. The notion that you would not have—if this had happened, and then folks said, We’re ready for that contingency, aren’t we? And the answer is, No, because it was too far out of the box—\n\nCheney\n\nNo.\n\nZelikow\n\n—This would not be a good answer.\n\nCheney\n\nNo, but the answer that you get. How many hours of footage ran of guys practicing the drill, putting on the suits and taking off the suits? We wore those suits out. You know, they probably had holes in them by the time the war actually started. A lot of that was intended specifically to convey the message to Saddam Hussein—and I think it was an accurate message—that if he did use these kinds of systems, that we were prepared to operate in that type of environment. He knew he wasn’t. They didn’t begin to have the kind of counter-measures that we had routinely deployed with our forces. So there was a real reluctance and there is to this day. I’m sure you could go to the Pentagon today and sit down and have a conversation like this about how you deal with these kinds of weapons—\n\nZelikow\n\nI’m surprised that this issue was not discussed with the President.\n\nCheney\n\nI didn’t say that.\n\nZelikow\n\nThat the issue of—\n\nCheney\n\nOf a response.\n\nZelikow\n\nOf what kind of WMD [weapons of mass destruction] response, if any, the United States might make, was not discussed with the President. Further, when you talk about using tactical nuclear weapons against frontline divisions.\n\nCheney\n\nAgainst military targets.\n\nZelikow\n\nThat’s certainly one acceptable target category, but not necessarily the only or perhaps even the best one. Given that those are the forces that are in the closest proximity to your own units, et cetera.\n\nCheney\n\nThe Republican Guard wasn’t, though. They initially went in and took Kuwait, and then they pulled back. They were deployed up along the Iraqi border. They weren’t the frontline divisions.\n\nMcCall\n\nI should interject two things. First, there was a conversation with the President about, in broad terms, response to bugs and gas and other delights of warfare. The President recounts it in his book. We did have conversations about this in preparation. That was the only time really that it was brought up. I think you were there for that; it was just a general discussion. The President discounted it.\n\nZelikow\n\nDiscounted the threat?\n\nMcCall\n\nNo, he didn’t discount the threat. My recollection—again, you’re getting this secondhand now from me and there isn’t really a written record of this other than the President’s and Brent’s comments—was exactly what you said at the outset here, that there was an awareness that we could not take it off the table, but the nukes were probably taken out of the actual—\n\nCheney\n\nIf something like that would have happened, nobody is authorized, the"
