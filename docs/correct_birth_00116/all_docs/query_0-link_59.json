Cheney is the Republican party's Vice Presidential nominee. He repeated his campaign refrain that he and Bush have a mission to restore honor and integrity to the White House. And he pointed to fundamental differences between Bush and Gore's approaches to the world. The Bush-Cheney ticket says the engine that drives the American economy is not the government, but the people. While the Democrats like to take credit for the surplus, Cheney says it was created by the hard work of millions of Americans. Under the Democratic plan, says Cheney, the surplus would be overspent by millions, with bigger government and higher taxes. But under Bush-Cheney, he argued, some of the surplus would go back to the people.\n\nDick Cheney (14.4 | 28.8)\n\nMorning Edition, October 11, 2000\n\nHost Bob Edwards talks with Republican vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney about this year's presidential campaign.
