        "text": "UNDER George W Bush, Republican Dick Cheney served as the US vice president from 2001 to 2009.\n\nAnd politics runs in the family, with Dick backing his daughter Liz Cheney who has been the US representative for Wyoming since 2017.\n\nWho is Dick Cheney?\n\nDick Cheney, whose full name is Richard Bruce Cheney, is a former US vice president and businessman from Nebraska.\n\nHe is considered the most powerful vice president in history during his eight-year term alongside former president George W. Bush.\n\nRaised in Sumner, Nebraska, and Casper, Wyoming, Cheney went to Yale University and then the University of Wyoming, where he received his Bachelor's degree before moving on to obtain his Master's degree in political science at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nHe began his political career in the White House under former President Richard Nixon and former President Gerald Ford and served as the Chief of Staff from 1975-1977.\n\nFrom March 1989 to January 1993, Cheney directed two impactful military campaigns - Operation Just Cause in Panama and Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East.\n\nOperation Just Cause was an invasion of Panama to remove General Manuel Noreiga from power. He was then extradited to the US for drug trafficking and money laundering charges.\n\nOperation Desert Storm was carried out during the Gulf War to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait after they invaded and annexed the country months earlier.\n\nCheney was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his leadership in the Gulf War by President George HW Bush on July 3, 1991.\n\nHe is also thought to have played a significant role in the Bush administration's response to the 9/11 attacks and the global war on terrorism that followed and during his visit to Afghanistan, there was a failed assassination attempt against him on February 27, 2007, when a suicide bomber killed 23 people.\n\nWho is Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz Cheney?\n\nLiz Cheney is a House representative who has spearheaded the House select committee in the investigation of the January 6 Capitol riot and Donald Trump's role on that day.\n\nShe is running for re-election but has been ostracized from the Republican party for leading the committee and has been strongly criticised by Trump loyalists and has been called a RINO (Republican In Name Only).\n\nShe was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2016 and later was elevated to the third-ranking Republican in the House but was removed from her position as chair of the House Republican Conference on May 12, 2021.\n\nThe decision came only 20 minutes after Liz told the House: \"We cannot let the former president drag us backward and make us complicit in his efforts to unravel our democracy.\"\n\nFollowing her removal from her position, she told reporters: \"I will do everything I can to ensure that the former president never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.\"\n\nWhat did he say in Liz Cheney's ad campaign?\n\nDick featured in a new advertisement for Liz 's campaign to be re-elected to her House seat in November 2022.\n\nThe ad, titled He Knows It, is an attack on former President Donald Trump and his influence on American democracy.\n\nDick Cheney said in the ad: “In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who has posed a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.\n\n“He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.\"\n\nHe continued: “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters.\n\n\"He lost his election and he lost big. I know it, he knows it, and deep down, I think most Republicans know it.\n\n“Lynne and I are so proud of Liz for standing up for the truth, doing what’s right, honoring her oath to the Constitution when so many in our party are too scared to do so.\"\n\nDick addressed his daughter's tenacity in the ad, saying: “Liz is fearless. She never backs down from a fight.\n\n\"There is nothing more important she will ever do than lead the effort to make sure Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office. And she will succeed.\n\n“I’m Dick Cheney. I proudly voted for my daughter. I hope you will too.”"
