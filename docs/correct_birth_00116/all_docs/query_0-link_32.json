        "text": "This Sunday, former Vice President Dick Cheney will be interviewed on \"This Week\" by ABC News' Jonathan Karl.\n\nCheney is no stranger to \"This Week.\" His appearances date back to at least Aug. 19, 1990, when he was interviewed by Barbara Walters, who was substituting for David Brinkley. He was most recently interviewed by George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\" about his book, \"Heart,\" last fall\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by the former vice president and his daughter, Liz, that lambasted President Obama for his foreign policy. The two also released the video below announcing the launch of a new organization, The Alliance for a Strong America.\n\nBefore the interview on Sunday, here are four things you might not know about the former vice president.\n\n1) HIS EARLY LIFE:\n\nRichard B. Cheney (his middle name is \"Bruce\") was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1941. He earned a bachelor's and master's degree from the University of Wyoming after failing out of Yale University, which is the same school where former President George W. Bush received his undergraduate degree. Cheney is married to Lynne Cheney and the couple have two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. \"Liz\" has led a much more public life, making a brief bid for Senate last year and making television appearances on shows such as \"GMA\" and \"This Week.\" Mary, who is openly gay, generally kept a much lower profile until this past fall when she publicly rebuked Liz Cheney on Facebook for her comments on gay marriage [see below]. Dick Cheney has expressed support for gay marriage, which very few high-profile Republicans have done.\n\n// <![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;"
