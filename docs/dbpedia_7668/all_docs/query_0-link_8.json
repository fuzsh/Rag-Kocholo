        "text": "Notes from the nonprofit\n\nOver the past 10 years the traditional newspaper model died. Historically, newspapers were not only the only source of community news, but were also profitable enough to create foundations to give to the community. Qhis model is no longer viable. Rigerious journalism is essential to the the survival of a democracy. Voice of OC is the future of journalism - and in a very real sense the health of non-profit news is the best indicator of the long term prospects for government by the people and for the people. Without credible news coverage all other non-profits will suffer from lack of coverage necessary to build awareness, and provide service. We do not charge for subscriptions - everyone has access. A gift to Voice of OC is a gift to all of Orange County because it will ensure that the clear, straightforward and comprehensive information they need to engage government and participate in the culture of the region will always be available to everyone in Orange County."
