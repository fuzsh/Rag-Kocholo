        "text": "Each week, some of the best TV critics in the game join AirTalk, LAist 89.3's daily news program, to share TV recommendations. Dominic Patten, executive editor for Deadline, and Marcus Jones, awards editor for TV & Film at IndieWire, joined to discuss the House of the Dragon season finale episode, and they share the docuseries they're watching right now.\n\nHouse of the Dragon\n\nSeason 2, Episode 8 aired this past weekend, and it wasn't necessarily the explosive finale many Game of Thrones fans have come to know and love. But a path for Season 3 has certainly been set.\n\n\"There were some who doubted that it could actually meet the standards set by Game of Thrones,\" said Patten. \"This finale really pushed it up there. I often think that in this era we live in, we don't give patience enough to some shows.\"\n\nWhere to watch: Season 1 and 2 are available now on Max.\n\nHollywood Black\n\nFrom the director of Dear White People and The Haunted Mansion remake, the four-part documentary series chronicles the history of the Black experience in Hollywood and features prominent voices like Forest Whitaker, Issa Rae, Ava DuVernay, Omar Epps, LaKeith Stanfield and more.\n\n“It emphasizes how Black people have actually been a part of cinema from the beginning and adds this real context,” Jones said.\n\nWhere to watch: Episodes premiere on Sunday, Aug. 11, on MGM+, which offers a free week-long trial if you don't already have access to the network through a cable subscription.\n\nKennedy, Sinatra, and the Mafia\n\nThe details are in the title. JFK, Frank Sinatra, and the mob. The two-part docuseries looks at the connections between those three entities, especially during and after the 1960 election.\n\n“It really looks at the transactional realities of America, certainly during that period of the post war era, specifically how the mafia helps JFK get elected mainly through these connections with his father... and how Frank Sinatra's career rose through the mafia,” Patten said.\n\nWhere to watch: Episodes are available on Sundance Now, which offers a free week-long trial.\n\nListen for more"
