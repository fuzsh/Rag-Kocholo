        "text": "In the vast and vibrant universe of sports, no other is as democratic, passionate, magical, and chaotic than the soccer. You don't need much to play it, just a ball, or something that looks like one, and a place to imagine the goal.\n\nAh, soccer!\n\nThe magic of the dazzling dribbles, the 90th-minute comeback goals, and the screams of the fans that make any stadium shake.\n\nFrom its earliest days, when the British played during breaks in their factory shifts, to the present day, when the best players in the world take to the most famous pitches on the planet, soccer has always been an irresistible mix of talent, improvisation, and sheer dedication.\n\nDecades ago, there was Pelé, the king of soccer, who took the sport to a new level with his quick dribbling, spectacular goals, and a charisma that transcended borders.\n\nMore recently, we've seen Zico, the first player with surgical precision in his passes and free kicks. Also Ronaldinho Gaúcho, who, with his joy in his legs and his magic with the ball, turned football into a spectacle of pure art.\n\nAt the beginning of the millennium, the greatest rivalry in history was born. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, two true scoring machines whose statistics would impress even the most skeptical critics: more than 800 goals each, hundreds of assists, and two collections of titles that would make any museum jealous.\n\nBetween the astronomical numbers and the memorable plays, soccer has become a true global spectacle, the greatest of all sports, uniting people of all ages, genders and nationalities in a continuous celebration with the right to scream, sweat and tears. But behind the many stars who shine in the world's stadiums, there are millions of young dreamers who believe, day after day, that they could be the next to have their lives changed by this sport.\n\nAmong those millions, there was once a Japanese boy. Just one among many. His name? Lucas Tanaka, the son of an American father and a Japanese mother.\n\nLucas grew up listening to stories about Pele, admiring Ronaldinho's dribbling on various YouTube videos, and trying to imitate Cristiano Ronaldo's mythological goals.\n\nIn school games or on the municipal field, he played with the same joy as his idols, dreaming, like so many others, of one day becoming part of this glorious history called football.\n\nIn Japan, the country where Lucas Tanaka was born and raised, people also loved soccer. It was a sport that was greatly admired, and throughout his childhood, Lucas Tanaka was praised for his skill and dedication to soccer.\n\nHowever, when he reached the age of 18 and decided not to go to university or a preparatory course, dreaming of finding a place in one of the Japanese national league teams, the J-LEAGUE, the people around him, the same ones who had previously congratulated him for all his efforts, began to judge him.\n\nThese people said that Lucas was wasting his life on a \"stupid\" dream and that he should focus on a path that would be safer and more stable for him and his family.\n\nThat same day, not feeling up to going to the city park to work out, Lucas Tanaka sat down in front of the old TV in his room, turned on the sports channel, and started watching. As it happened, a sixteen-year-old boy was making his debut for Barcelona FC. The boy was thinner and shorter than Lucas Tanaka, but there he was, in the center of world soccer.\n\nSo Lucas decided that society was right about his dream and gave in to social pressure.\n\n\"It's too late...\"\n\nLucas simply couldn't have imagined that he would end up as an almost thirty-year-old single man living in a tiny apartment in Tokyo.\n\n\"Hey, Tanaka, did you finish that design I asked you to do?\" His boss asked routinely, several times a day.\n\n\"Yes, boss. It's in your e-mail.\"\n\nInstead of becoming a soccer player, Tanaka went to business school. After college, he found work in a design firm and had to adapt to keep from getting fired. So his life became a loop of monotonous days, working every day until after hours in a gray office, surrounded by piles of papers and disapproving looks.\n\nOne cold evening, after leaving the office late, Lucas Tanaka stopped at a convenience store to buy something to eat.\n\n*Grrrrr*\n\nHis stomach rumbled loudly.\n\n\"Easy, easy...\" Lucas stroked his stomach as if there really was a monster inside.\n\nWhen he entered the convenience store, the characteristic bell rang, but the clerk didn't even look at him, as he seemed to be concentrating.\n\nLucas then went to the instant noodle aisle and began to analyze which of the many flavors he would choose this time. He had already tried all the flavors, even the strangest ones.\n\nThe store was so empty and quiet that Victor could hear what the clerk at the counter was watching.\n\n\"Honestly, this is one of the most impressive finals I've ever seen. Mbappé is only 24, and this is his third goal. Ladies and gentlemen, I may be jumping the gun, but it looks like we're witnessing the birth of a football legend,\" the narrator said.\n\n\"Sir...?\" the salesman asked.\n\nSuddenly, Lucas found himself unconsciously standing in front of the counter with a randomly flavored instant noodle in one hand. Unbeknownst to him, he had been captivated by the soccer game playing on the television next to the cashier.\n\nThe cashier looked on with a puzzled expression, and Lucas quickly handed the noodles to the young man to pick up. As he did so, Lucas peered around the inside of the counter again, trying to catch a glimpse of the game.\n\n\"Sir, that'll be 400 yen.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes...\" Lucas took some coins out of his pocket and began to count.\n\nHe was a poor worker; he didn't have much money. Nevertheless, he found a 1000 yen coin, which he handed to the young clerk.\n\nLucas' attention soon returned to the soccer game. \"Excuse me for asking, young man. But that game you're watching... Who's playing?\"\n\n\"Um... This one? France and Argentina. It's the recorded final of the 2022 World Cup. I like to watch that game sometimes.\"\n\nLucas looked at the scoreboard. It was 3-3 after 119 minutes. The young player Mbappé was shining for France with 3 goals.\n\nLucas Tanaka left the convenience store with a bitter taste in his mouth, holding the bag of instant noodles in one hand and the change and receipt in the other.\n\n\"World Cup 2022... I was 21 at the time, but I'd already given up watching soccer. That explains why I don't remember the game.\"\n\nThe year in question was 2031, almost 10 years after the 2022 World Cup. It was impossible for Lucas not to feel nostalgic, and then to feel the mixture of frustration, disappointment, and anger that always came over him when he remembered the dreams he had given up.\n\nAdjusting the scarf around his neck to protect himself from the freezing wind, Lucas tried to shake those tumultuous thoughts away.\n\nBut the 3-3 scoreline of a World Cup final still echoed in his mind, like a cruel reminder of the dreams he had given up. It was every man's dream to be in the position the young French player had been in, and Lucas wondered what his life would have been like if he had followed his passion for football.\n\n'Instead, I'm stuck in an endless cycle of gray days in an office that seems to be slowly sucking away my soul... I think I'd do it differently.'\n\nWalking through the streets, Lucas came upon a narrow alley lit only by a flickering streetlight. Normally, he would have changed his route just in case, but then he heard a muffled sound, something between a scream and a desperate whisper. Then, under the flickering light of the lamppost, he saw a scene that made his heart skip a beat.\n\nA hooded man was holding a long-haired woman against the wall. His dirty hand covered her mouth as he muttered something inaudible near her neck.\n\nThe woman obviously tried to break free. But the man was stronger, holding her by the wrists.\n\n'An abuser!'\n\nLucas didn't want any trouble. He had enough trouble in his own life. But something inside him wouldn't let him just ignore the situation. He always avoided conflict, always took the easy way out, always let his boss take credit for his designs, but, that night, something changed.\n\n\"Hey!\" he shouted.\n\nThe hooded man abruptly turned his head in Lucas' direction, and the woman used the distraction to try to break free. With no luck, the man pulled her back violently.\n\n\"Who are you? Her boyfriend?\" The man growled.\n\nLucas swallowed. He didn't have a good physique for fighting, but he couldn't back down now either. \"It doesn't matter! Leave her alone!\"\n\nThe man smiled bitterly and let go of only one of the woman's arms. \"Are you going to stop me?\" he asked, pulling a knife from his jacket pocket.\n\nLucas clenched his fist, gripping the grocery bag tightly. \"Yes, I will.\"\n\nThe man then clucked his tongue, let go of the woman, and moved quickly forward with the knife.\n\n\"You don't know who you're messing with!\" the attacker shouted.\n\nA shiver ran down Lucas' spine as he saw the man run toward him with the knife in his hand, but with a scream he didn't know where it came from, Lucas raised the arm holding the bag and threw it with all his might at his attacker. The plastic bag broke in midair, and the package flew toward the attacker like an improvised projectile, hitting the man in the face. It was enough to disorient him for a moment.\n\nTaking advantage of the distraction, Lucas lunged forward and punched the man with all the force he could muster.\n\nHe felt pain as his fingers struck the hooded man's jaw.\n\nFortunately, the blow was strong enough to knock the attacker to the ground.\n\nFor a moment, everything seemed to freeze. The woman, frightened and still leaning against the wall, stared at Lucas with wide eyes, barely believing what he had done.\n\nThe man on the floor was stunned, but when his eyes met Lucas', an expression of fear and amazement appeared on his face.\n\nLucas didn't understand why the man was afraid until he felt a stabbing pain in his stomach. He looked down to see the knife buried in his stomach, blood seeping through his clothes.\n\nShock overcame his body, and he staggered backwards, his knees weak.\n\n\"Shit, shit, shit!\" The man on the ground took the opportunity to get up and run.\n\nLucas tried to yell at him not to run, but his voice wouldn't come out. The next thing he knew, he felt dizzy and fell backwards.\n\nThe woman ran over to him and shouted something, but her words sounded far away, muffled, as if he were underwater.\n\n\"Hang on!\" she cried as her trembling hands pressed down on the knife, trying to stop the bleeding. \"It's going to be okay, just hang on! Help me! Please, someone!\"\n\nThe cold of the night enveloped Lucas, but he could barely feel it. He felt numb, unable to focus on anything but the pain and the desperate face of the woman trying to help him. She was very beautiful.\n\nSoon Lucas heard the sound of hurried footsteps, alarmed voices, and the sound of sirens in the distance. He tried to focus on those voices. It was no use. Everything was slipping away. The surrounding darkness quickly engulfed everything.\n\nSuddenly, everything was silent.\n\nThe world around him seemed to stop, and Lucas felt like he was floating.\n\nIt was a strange, almost comforting sensation, as if he was being pulled out of his body.\n\nThen he heard an emotionless voice in his head. It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.\n\n[The ability of <System> has been granted.]\n\n[<System> unlocked.]\n\n[The ability <System> has granted you the ability <Céos>.]\n\n[<Céos> unlocked.]\n\n[The ability <System> has given you the ability <Sharp Intuition>.]\n\n[<Sharp Intuition> unlocked].\n\n[The skill <System> has given you the skill <Attribute Progression>.]\n\n[<Attribute Progression> unlocked].\n\n[The skill <System> gave you the skill <Supernatural Resistance>.]\n\n[<Supernatural Resistance> unlocked].\n\n[Thanks to the divine effect of <Supernatural Resistance>, death will no longer be a problem for you.]\n\nLucas tried to understand what was happening, but his mind was foggy.\n\nThe pain was gone, replaced by a strange feeling of relief. He was no longer cold, but warm.\n\nThe darkness became complete, and Lucas fell into it, lost in an infinite void.\n\nWhen Lucas opened his eyes again, he was no longer in the partially dark street, nor did he hear sirens. He was in a completely different place. It was a vast field of green grass. The sky above was a deep blue, without a single cloud.\n\n\"Tanaka! Cross for me!\" A voice shouted.\n\nThen Lucas heard a sound, a *thump*, and something touched his feet. As soon as he looked down, he realized that what had touched him was a ball, a soccer ball.\n\nApparently, for some reason, he was in the middle of a soccer game.\n\nRaising his head again, Lucas looked ahead and saw young Shoei Baro, a childhood friend of his, but the strangest thing was that Baro looked to be in his sixteenth year, and that scared Lucas more than anything else. He remembered it well. Baro had become a world-famous player after passing the Blue Lock, a Japanese national tryout to select the striker who would lead Japan to its first World Cup.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSupport me to write more and you can read up to 20 advanced chapters!\n\nP-atreon.com/palmer_1998\n\n(Just remove the hyphen to access Patreon normally.)\n\nNEXT CHAPTERS:\n\n02 - Sixteen Again!\n\n03 - My <Champion System>\n\n04 - Copy Conditions\n\n05 - The End of the Training Game\n\n06 - Days that seemed so far away\n\n06.5 - Back to the family\n\n07 - Star Level\n\n08 - Daily Mission\n\n09 - Shoei Baro\n\n10 - <Stellar Impulse>\n\n11 - Chubu Region Summer Championship\n\n12 - Rival Schools\n\n13 - Tactical Formation\n\n14 - Being a substitute is bad\n\n15 - Troubleshooter\n\n16 - Evolution\n\n17 - Injury\n\n18 - Option to Pass\n\nWhen Lucas Tanaka looked down at his feet and saw the ball, he shook his head, not understanding what was happening. He raised his head to see Shoei Baro still running with one arm raised, indicating that he wanted to receive the pass.\n\nLucas lifted his foot, instinctively wanting to pass the ball to Baro, but soccer is a fast-paced sport that requires sharp decision-making, and there's usually not much time to think on the field. Just as Lucas was about to kick the ball, an opponent suddenly appeared and, with impressive speed, this player glided across the field and made a perfect, clean run to steal the ball from Lucas.\n\nLucas' fall was sudden. The trolley took the ball from him, but it also knocked him down. But the tackle wasn't, and the opponent didn't bother to help him. Instead, the boy got up and started running quickly with the ball, setting up a counterattack.\n\nLucas tried to get up quickly, but the pain in his heel stopped him.\n\nBaro, returning from the attack, was the one to offer a hand to help him up.\n\n\"Tanaka, why didn't you give me the passport?\" Baro asked as he helped him to his feet.\n\nLucas didn't know what to say, nor did he understand what was going on.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I hesitated...\"\n\nBaro gave Lucas a weak pat on the back. \"It's okay, I'll be there next time. Just pass it to me and I'll score.\"\n\nBut there was no next time. For the next few minutes, Lucas tried to keep up with the pace of the game, but each move seemed more difficult than the last. His mind was foggy, and he simply couldn't process the surrounding events clearly. He tripped over the ball a few times and fell, and his legs felt heavy and uncoordinated.\n\n\"Tanaka, what's happening to you?\" asked Baro during a brief stoppage in play after a foul. \"You're our playmaker. If you can't connect passes, we can't score.\"\n\nHis friend's worried look only added to Lucas' confusion.\n\n\"I... I don't know,\" Lucas mumbled, trying to wipe the sweat from his brow.\n\nOver the next few minutes, the ball stopped coming to Lucas. His team's players began to make more runs down the flanks, trying to get into the attacking half.\n\nIt was then that the team's coach, Mr. Yamamoto, noticed the situation. With a serious look on his face, he signaled for Lucas to leave the field.\n\nLucas slowly walked to the side of the field, greeted the teammate who would be replacing him, then the coach, and sat down on the bench in frustration.\n\nWith a towel over his head, he took a moment to take a deep breath and try to understand what had happened.\n\nThe strange transition from a near-death state to this familiar but confusing scenario was beyond what an ordinary human mind could easily process.\n\nHe knew something extraordinary had happened. Lucas looked around. The sounds of the game, the shouts of the players, the people, everything was too real to be a dream. He closed his eyes, trying to clear his vision and his mind. The towel over his head isolated him at least a little from the stares of the surrounding people.\n\n'Why? Why is this happening to me?' he asked himself, looking down at his hands.\n\nHis hands weren't chubby, nor were they full of wrinkles like before, and looking at his own body, he could easily see that he was younger, much younger. It was clear that he had somehow rejuvenated himself or rather gone back in time.\n\nLucas then raised his head and began to pay more attention to his surroundings.\n\nThere were only a few people on the bench. He was one of the few players there.\n\nThe coach, Mr. Yamamoto, a man in his fifties, was giving instructions to both teams. Of course, it was a practice game of eleven against eleven, but the field was smaller than a normal soccer field. It was a reduced soccer field, in other words, the school field.\n\nSeveral times a week they practiced on the school field, so this could have been any day, but there was something different.\n\nOn the field, the players gave their all and seemed focused. Something important was about to happen. However, it was impossible for Lucas to easily remember such a normal situation from his youth, and it would be strange to suddenly ask for the date in question. Therefore, it was useless for him to try to find out what day it was at this moment.\n\nThe same was true for the mysterious reason why he was back. If there was a reason, Lucas felt it was to play soccer, otherwise why on earth would he come back in the middle of a game?\n\nLucas clenched his fist, stood up, tossed his towel aside and said:\n\n\"Mr. Yamamoto, can I come back in?\"\n\n\"Tanaka, of course you can't come in, you just...\"\n\nWhen Yamamoto turned to look at Lucas as he replied, Lucas could tell just by looking into Yamamoto's eyes that something had changed. At that moment, Yamamoto stopped halfway through his answer, looked straight ahead, crossed his arms and continued:\n\n\"Okay, but get a vest. You'll be on the reserve team.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nLucas quickly grabbed the vest, eager to get back into the game. The sun was still high and strong, and his heart was beating faster.\n\nThe reserve team was struggling to keep up with the first team, but the score was 4-2.\n\nLucas took a deep breath, and when he finally took his first step onto the field, everything around him stopped, and the same voice he had heard before echoed in his mind.\n\n[The skill of <System> has evolved into <Champion System>].\n\n[<Champion System> unlocked].\n\n[To become a champion, you must increase your star level.]\n\n[Your current Star Level is 0].\n\n[Complete missions in the <Champion System> to increase your star level and earn other rewards].\n\n[The rewards will increase with each level you reach].\n\n[The <Champion System> skill is activated.]\n\n[The mission \"The first step of the second chance\" has been granted].\n\n[Do you want to know the purpose of this mission?]\n\nLucas, still stunned by what had happened, blinked twice, looked around, saw that time had stopped, and nodded without a choice. The words were gone from his mouth.\n\n[Main Mission: The First Step of a Second Chance\n\nDescription: This is a practice game before an important school championship.

From the heat and the sound of cicadas in the bushes not far from the field, Lucas Tanaka could easily tell that it was summer.\n\nSo if, as the mission description stated, this was a practice game to determine who would start in the first league game, then the league in question could only be the Chubu Summer League, which used school vacations to promote a major league that included most of the teams in the Chubu region of Japan.\n\nThe Chubu Summer League wasn't as famous as the Kanto Summer League, but it was certainly important.\n\nLucas took a deep breath, feeling the tension in his muscles and the sweat dripping down his forehead. The vest he wore now seemed to weigh more than it should, carrying with it a series of dreams and burdens whose weight he hadn't felt at sixteen in the past. He looked at his teammates, some waving at him in encouragement, others simply focused on the ball.\n\nEveryone was aware that this was a crucial opportunity, and everyone wanted to be in the starting lineup.\n\nCoach Yamamoto's whistle blew sharply, breaking the momentary silence and signaling the resumption of the game.\n\nLucas was a midfielder, so he saw several players advance in front of him when the ball was released. They were the strikers.\n\nLucas' heart quickened as the ball and his team advanced toward the opposing defense. His legs moved almost automatically because his eyes were focused.\n\n[Paying attention to the ball is important, but it can also be good to pay attention to the surrounding players.]\n\n'That voice again...' Lucas thought. 'And it's still telling me how to play soccer? Who do you think you are?'\n\n[I am Céos, your assistant skill.]\n\nLucas was still very confused by what was happening to him, but he didn't have time for more questions because his first opportunity came when one of the team's players lost control of the ball. Without hesitation, he charged forward and intercepted a desperation pass.\n\nThe crowd, made up of a few schoolmates on the railings around the field, let out a murmur of excitement.\n\nLucas was known to be a good player at school, so it was somewhat normal for people to get excited when he touched the ball.\n\nQuickly, another player from the first team rushed towards Lucas to cover his teammate's mistake, but Lucas almost automatically turned his body to protect the ball from his opponent. As a result, the first-team defender ran right past him, leaving a wide corridor in front of Lucas.\n\n\"I'll stop you, Tanaka!\" shouted Baro, suddenly appearing behind Lucas.\n\nBaro was a natural center forward. It was unusual for him to be so far back, running behind a midfielder. This was just a small proof that the first team players knew how dangerous Lucas could be.\n\nBaro's teammates were also quick to try to close the gap created by Lucas' dribbling.\n\n[It's wise to pass the ball.]\n\n\"You don't have to tell me! I know how to play soccer!\" Lucas shouted.\n\nHe quickly raised his head to look for a teammate in a better position. He saw Junpei open on the right wing. It was a perfect opportunity. Lucas fired a powerful shot, sending the ball high into the air.\n\nThe sound of the shot echoed across the field, and for a moment, all eyes were on the sky. The ball rose so high that it cast a shadow against the bright sun.\n\nJunpei ran, taking advantage of the gap in the defense created by the opponent's desperation to mark Lucas.\n\nHowever, Lucas clearly missed the speed and height of the pass. Junpei was supposed to receive the ball at his feet and run forward to cross the ball into the box or shoot, but Lucas' pass was too high.\n\nJunpei even tried to head the ball from behind, but it was too high. He could barely get his head on the ball and it continued on its way, landing outside the box.\n\nLucas paused, gasping as he watched the wasted opportunity.\n\nJunpei raised his hand in an apologetic gesture, but Lucas knew it was his fault. He had put too much force into the pass, and now the team had to regroup quickly.\n\n\"Hey, Tanaka, what was that you were yelling?\" One of Lucas' reserve teammates asked.\n\nBaro stopped beside him, a little out of breath. \"It was ' I know how to play soccer!', wasn't it? Hhahaha!\"\n\n\"You can't yell that and then miss a pass, man!\"\n\nLucas put a hand to the back of his head and followed the laughter, a little embarrassed. He didn't even realize it, but in the heat of the moment, he yelled at Céos in a loud voice.\n\nThe game restarted with a fullback for the first team. Lucas retreated a bit down the field, already feeling the sweat running down his face and neck.\n\nThe ball was put back into play, and the opposition began to move forward. Lucas positioned himself strategically, this time following Ceo's advice and watching his opponents' movements more closely. When a pass was directed to the middle, he anticipated it and tried to anticipate the ball again.\n\nHowever, Kenji, another first team midfielder, was quicker than Lucas and kept the ball for his team. He picked up the ball and made a quick pass to the left back, who in turn made a vertical pass to the first team left winger.\n\nThe play was frenetic, and most of the first team was much more in sync. It didn't take long for the left winger to get to the top of the box, where Baro was screaming for the ball.\n\nBaro was a natural center forward. No matter how the ball came to him in the box, he would find a way to finish. He was too dangerous not to be marked, but that wasn't Lucas' job.\n\nLucas trusted the work of his team's defenders and prepared for the counterattack.\n\nBut when the ball was crossed, it didn't go towards the penalty area, but to the halfway line, where Kenji was waiting.\n\nThe gleam in Kenji's eyes revealed his clear intention: he was ready to finish the job.\n\nFrom that moment on, every movement on the field seemed to be in slow motion for Lucas, who, even from a distance, was able to capture every detail with astonishing clarity.\n\nKenji took a firm step forward and his right foot met the ball in mid-air. He sent it towards the goal with frightening power and precision.\n\nThe ball sliced through the air like an arrow, or rather a spear, traveling at high speed as it spun around its own axis.\n\nThe opposing goalkeeper tried to reach the ball, stretching as far as he could, but there was no way. The ball had a predetermined trajectory that took it straight into the upper right corner of the goal.\n\nThe unmistakable sound of the net rattled across the pitch, followed by a brief moment of absolute silence. Then an explosion of cheers and applause swept the field, the celebration of a magnificent goal, with even the reserve players praising Kenji.\n\nLucas stood still, unresponsive. At that moment, a movie played in Lucas' head, literally the movie of his life. Kenji's goal pushed Lucas even further away from his dream. If he couldn't be a starter and excel in the summer league, he would never go to Bleu Lock, just like in his previous life.\n\n[The hidden function of the skill <Champion System> has been unlocked].\n\n[The skill of <Replicator Genius> has been granted].\n\n[<Replicator Genius> unlocked].\n\n[The player Kenji Nakamaru has just demonstrated the skill <Advanced First Kick>, do you want to check the copying conditions?]\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSupport me to write more and you can read up to 20 advanced chapters!\n\nP-atreon.com/palmer_1998\n\n(Just remove the hyphen to access Patreon normally.)\n\nNEXT CHAPTERS:\n\n04 - Copy Conditions\n\n05 - The End of the Training Game\n\n06 - Days that seemed so far away\n\n06.5 - Back to the family\n\n07 - Star Level\n\n08 - Daily Mission\n\n09 - Shoei Baro\n\n10 - <Stellar Impulse>\n\n11 - Chubu Region Summer Championship\n\n12 - Rival Schools\n\n13 - Tactical Formation\n\n14 - Being a substitute is bad\n\n15 - Troubleshooter\n\n16 - Evolution\n\n17 - Injury\n\n18 - Option to Pass\n\n[The player Kenji Nakamaru has just demonstrated the skill <Advanced First-Touch Kick>. Do you want to check the copying conditions for this skill?]\n\nThis message flashed in front of Luke's eyes, and even though he had become accustomed to these idiosyncrasies, he was still startled by the possibility of being able to copy the skill of one of his teammates. It was an unexpected stroke of luck.\n\nStill, Lucas remained sane and rational. With a conscious effort, he pushed aside the initial excitement and concentrated on the message as everyone returned to their positions after Kenji's goal.\n\n'Yes, I want to check the copying conditions.' He agreed thoughtfully, his heart racing with anticipation.\n\nAlmost immediately, a new message appeared.\n\n[Skill Copy Conditions <Advanced First-Touch Kick>: Execute a first shot on goal in front of player Kenji Nakamaru].\n\n'In other words, you want me to take revenge for him scoring in front of me.' Lucas took a deep breath and understood the purpose.\n\nThe task seemed simple in theory, but, in practice, it was a different story.\n\nKenji was a clever midfielder who positioned himself very well, was solid defensively and also shot well from outside the box. It would have been a bit tricky to put him in one place on the pitch and just have him watch me kick a first touch into the goal. However, the opportunity and curiosity of learning a new skill without having to practice it for months was too tempting to ignore.\n\nWhen the ball returned to the center of the field and play returned, Lucas looked at Kenji. He had to keep an eye on the movement of the opposing team and the formation of his own team. The right opportunity would come. He just had to be ready to take it.\n\nThe fast pace of the game didn't slow down when the match resumed. There was no room for distractions, and Lucas remained focused.\n\nThe ball circulated between the reserve players, and Lucas kept moving so the defense wouldn't think he was a threat.\n\nEvery touch, every pass, was a potential opportunity. He had to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nAnd then the opportunity came.\n\nThe ball was passed to him, and he took it and turned his body to move up the field. The opposition tried to surround him, and Kenji seemed to stop him.\n\nLucas played the ball to a teammate on his right who was passing.\n\nThe ball slid quickly along the ground, and this time the pass was accurate, but Lucas' teammate had no room to advance and dropped the ball back into midfield.\n\nStill, Lucas' forward pass alone was enough to draw the first team defense back a bit. They moved forward a bit when the ball came back to them, but Lucas didn't retreat to his side of the pitch. He pushed forward. In doing so, he forced his team's attackers to stay back, as well as his first team's defenders.\n\nThis was a dangerous thing to do because it was essential to get back to score, but it also created a huge gap between the first team defense and the midfield.\n\nWhen the reserve team kicked a ball to the right point, Kenji would look back and see more reserve team players in their backfield than his own team. This was absurd.\n\nWith a quick glance at Kenji, who was the only one in the starting midfield who had stayed back, Lucas ran forward with the forwards.\n\nThe reserve team's right winger made a quick pass to the holding midfielder, who was advancing alongside the right winger.\n\nThe holding midfielder was basically responsible for coordinating the team's possession. In the first team, this was Kenji Nakamaru, while Lucas Tanaka was more of a No. 8, but in the reserve team, the holding midfielder was Masamitsu, a smaller kid and not as skilled as Kenji.\n\nMasamitsu received the ball but couldn't hold it for long, so he passed it back to the speedy right winger, completing a triangle.\n\nThe right winger ran to the sideline, giving the reserves time to fill the entire penalty area.\n\nThe scenario was almost identical to Kenji's goal, with one exception. However, this was also a classic crossing move, so the first team players had no idea that the scenario of Kenji's goal was about to be repeated. What made this different from Kenji's goal was the confidence of the player on the edge of the box to cross the ball exactly into the crescent.\n\nLucas didn't know all the players in the school's soccer club, let alone have friendships with all of them, but he knew that he had the confidence of most of them because he had given goal passes to most of them.\n\n\"Here!\" Lucas ordered.\n\nThis was something he never did, literally never, because Lucas wasn't someone who focused on scoring goals. He wasn't a selfish striker. But apparently the system wanted to change his nature.\n\nI need to score this goal! I have to turn this game around!\n\nThe player on the edge heard the call, raised his head, and looked at his options. In the penalty area, the players were piled up, and a little behind them, they weren't. On the halfway line, almost outside the penalty area, there was only Lucas and a few other players spread out a bit more. So he crossed for Lucas without thinking twice.\n\n\"Take that, Tanaka!\"\n\nThe ball arced perfectly, and Lucas, his eyes fixed on the ball, swallowed dryly as he watched it head his way. He knew this was the moment he had been waiting for, the moment that could change the course of the game and, who knows, his own path to becoming a professional soccer player.\n\nAs the ball flew through the air, Lucas noticed Kenji Nakamaru running towards him with his eyes fixed on him. Kenji was a good player, with a natural ability to position himself defensively, break down opponents, and shoot from outside the box. A classic No. 5. If we were to compare him to anyone, it would be Casemiro.\n\nBut that didn't matter to Lucas, who took a few steps back, adjusted his position and prepared to shoot. This was his chance, and he wasn't going to waste it. In one fluid motion, Lucas swung his right leg back and then quickly stepped forward, kicking the ball with the instep of his right foot.\n\nThe sound of the kick echoed across the pitch, a solid beat that sounded like a drum.\n\nThe ball flew, cutting through the air at an impressive speed.\n\n[Copy Conditions Achieved].\n\n[Skill of <Advanced First-Touch Kick> obtained].\n\n[<Advanced First-Touch Kick> unlocked].\n\nThe system's confirmation was the icing on the cake at this point. However, the goal was yet to come.\n\nThe trajectory of the ball suddenly made a curve and an effect as if it had been kicked with the last three toes, and went straight into the top corner of the goal, replicating Kenji's feat.\n\nThe sound of the ball hitting the net was like a key turning, as Lucas clenched his fist and shouted in front of Kenji:\n\n\"THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT! WHAT A GOAL!\"\n\nAll the adrenaline and satisfaction of scoring a goal was released all at once by Lucas after so many years of not playing soccer. He couldn't contain the joy in his heart.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSupport me to write more and you can read up to 20 advanced chapters!\n\nP-atreon.com/palmer_1998\n\n(Just remove the hyphen to access Patreon normally.)\n\nNEXT CHAPTERS:\n\n04 - Copy Conditions\n\n05 - The End of the Training Game\n\n06 - Days that seemed so far away\n\n06.5 - Back to the family\n\n07 - Star Level\n\n08 - Daily Mission\n\n09 - Shoei Baro\n\n10 - <Stellar Impulse>\n\n11 - Chubu Region Summer Championship\n\n12 - Rival Schools\n\n13 - Tactical Formation\n\n14 - Being a substitute is bad\n\n15 - Troubleshooter\n\n16 - Evolution\n\n17 - Injury\n\n18 - Option to Pass\n\nThe feeling of scoring a goal was a truly unique sensation for Lucas. The happiness mixed with the accomplishment and excitement of everyone on his team was delicious. Lucas could feel his heart beating fast. He could almost taste victory, as it tasted salty from the sweat dripping down his face.\n\nThe roar of celebration that echoed from his lips was an outpouring of the years of futile effort he had spent in that design office.\n\nOn the soccer field, even if it was between four lines, Lucas Tanaka felt true freedom.\n\nHis teammates ran toward him, their faces lit up with smiles of pure euphoria.\n\nThat moment, that goal, was more than just a point on the scoreboard. It was proof that Lucas' dreams were within reach of his hands - or rather, his feet.\n\n\"Lucas! What a beautiful goal! Yes, yes!\" shouted Mr. Yamamoto, congratulating him from the sidelines.\n\nKenji, the player whose skill Lucas had copied, approached Lucas. \"You were too smart this time.\"\n\nLucas, still panting, smiled proudly: \"Thank you, Kenji. It was a kick inspired by yours.\"\n\n\"I could tell!\"\n\nWith the game restarted, there were only ten minutes left before the final whistle. The adrenaline was still pumping through Lucas' veins, but he knew he had to keep a cool head and concentrate on the game. He had the system to help him. He could draw and then win.\n\nThe first team players, alert, changed their strategy. Lucas began to feel the eyes of each defender on him, watching his movements with the intensity of predators watching their prey. They were his teammates, but he had the feeling they had never looked at him so hungrily.\n\nEvery touch of the ball was fiercely contested, every pass a challenge to find space. This was no ordinary training session, and the other students who passed by the field after finishing their club activities that afternoon could see that.\n\n\"Eh... The soccer club really works hard, right?\"\n\n\"During the holidays… They should take it a little easier.\"\n\n\"Didn't you see the poster? There's going to be a regional championship soon.\"\n\n\"That must be why they're working so hard.\"\n\nThe clock seemed to speed up, the seconds turning into a relentless countdown.\n\nLucas received the ball again and was quickly surrounded by opponents. He turned, trying to find an opening, a way forward. He made a simple touch to the right back who was advancing a bit ahead, but the ball was given back to him. This was not good. The reserves were relying on him to organize the team and keep up the aggressive pace of the game.\n\nLucas' eyes scanned the field looking for the best option for the next pass. He saw one of his team's strikers advance and played the ball between two defenders, but a third defender cut the ball back and sent it to the left side.\n\nPlay continued as normal. Lucas had no way of controlling the players on his team to make them play the way he wanted, but that was part of the fun of soccer. Besides, everyone was tired, and the reserve team was made up of many players who weren't even considered part of the club; they did more training than they actually played.\n\nStill, Lucas Tanaka believed in winning. If there was a reason why he was back for this game, it was because he needed to use this game to change the course of his life, and he wasn't going to waste this second chance.\n\nIt was then that the ball, deflected by one of his team's defenders, came back to him, slowly rolling towards him from outside the box. Normally, Lucas would dominate the ball, trying to buy himself more time to think and pass to a better-placed teammate. He was a number 8, passing was what he did. However, it was always by passing to other players that he never made a name for himself outside his own team and consequently never became a professional.\n\nThe new skill he had acquired echoed in his mind... <Advanced First Kick>... He knew that he could rely on this new power, and it was what secured his goal.\n\nWith a sudden surge of confidence, Lucas decided to take a shot at the ball as well. He swung his leg out and hit the ball, hoping it would repeat the perfect trajectory of the first goal. This time, however, the ball deflected to the right and went wide of the goal.\n\n\"What?!\" Lucas shouted, scratching his head and a little embarrassed.\n\n\"What's that, Tanaka? Were you trying to kill an owl?\" Tsukada, number 10 in the starting lineup, asked under his breath.\n\nLucas had no answer and just laughed awkwardly.\n\n'Why didn't I get it right this time? What about my new skill?'\n\n[The hit chance of the skill <First Kick Advanced> is 25%. The closer you are to the target, the higher the chance, and the farther you are, the lower the chance].\n\n[With effort and practice, it's possible to increase the hit probability of the skill <First Kick Advanced> to 50% at medium distance.]\n\nCéos was merciless in his analysis.\n\nLucas felt a pang of frustration because he thought that the hit probability of this skill was 100%. However, it also made sense that a skill like this wouldn't have such a high hit probability, otherwise it would be too broken. Normally, he wouldn't even be able to hit the ball the first time.\n\n\"Come on, Lucas! Shake it off and let's go!\" shouted Baro, the number 9 of the first team, to encourage him.\n\nDespite Baro's words of encouragement, the game remained the same for the next few minutes, and in the last minute, Baro personally increased the score for the first team.\n\n[Final score: First Team 6 x 0 Reserve Team.]\n\nLucas couldn't change the pace of the game or secure victory, so he knelt on the ground and punched the turf, frustrated at failing in his first mission.\n\n'Shit, shit, shit! Maybe if I hadn't kicked it in the first place... No, I should have kicked it!'\n\n[Mission \"The First Step of the Second Chance\" failed].\n\n[There will be a penalty for failing a mission].\n\n[The punishment will be...]\n\n[Daily Mission: \"Effort X Reward\" completed].\n\n[Daily Mission: Effort X Reward.\n\nDescription: You're not good enough, try harder.\n\nDaily goal:\n\n0/100 Pushups\n\n0/100 Abs\n\n0/100 Squats\n\n0/10KM Run\n\nRewards:\n\n+1 Star Point.\n\n+1 Loot Box].\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSupport me to write more and you can read up to 20 advanced chapters!\n\nP-atreon.com/palmer_1998\n\n(Just remove the hyphen to access Patreon normally.)\n\nNEXT CHAPTERS:\n\n04 - Copy Conditions\n\n05 - The End of the Training Game\n\n06 - Days that seemed so far away\n\n06.5 - Back to the family\n\n07 - Star Level\n\n08 - Daily Mission\n\n09 - Shoei Baro\n\n10 - <Stellar Impulse>\n\n11 - Chubu Region Summer Championship\n\n12 - Rival Schools\n\n13 - Tactical Formation\n\n14 - Being a substitute is bad\n\n15 - Troubleshooter\n\n16 - Evolution\n\n17 - Injury\n\n18 - Option to Pass\n\n\"Did I get a new mission because I failed another one?\" Lucas asked himself, still on his knees, lamenting his defeat.\n\nPriiiii! A whistle blew from one side of the field. Everyone looked in the direction of the sound and saw Mr. Yamamoto taking his old metal whistle out of his mouth.\n\n\"Please gather everyone here.\" Mr. Yamamoto said, gesturing with his hand for all the players to come forward.\n\nTired and very sweaty, Lucas stood up and walked to the edge of the field where all the players of the soccer club were gathered.\n\n\"Today's practice was very good and much more intense than usual. Can any of you tell me why?\" Mr. Yamamoto was the coach of the soccer club and also a physical education teacher at School Wushia, so he was very didactic in his conversations with the boys.\n\nOne player raised his hand. \"Is it because the summer championships are coming up?\"\n\n\"Very good, Kaue. I think that's the main reason, too. Everyone on both teams was doing their best because they wanted to be in the starting lineup for the opening game of the tournament, right? I admire that about you guys. And it's not just me...\" Mr. Yamamoto pointed behind him, and there were several students from the other clubs watching them through the bars.\n\n\"Wow, they're really fast. Do you think they can do well this year?\" One of the spectators commented to his friend as he turned to leave.\n\n\"I don't know much about soccer, but they seemed to be trying hard. If they show that will in the league, they'll impress.\" The other replied with a shrug.\n\nMr. Yamamoto drew a small smile on his wrinkled face. \"You see? Even the other students are starting to notice how hard you work. So you should know that even those of you who don't start in the first team in the first game will still be able to help us a lot during the championship. After all, substitutions exist in soccer to make the game more dynamic and fun.\"\n\nThe coach, with his wise face and small eyes, looked at his students. They were all tired and worried.\n\n\"I can see that you're all waiting for something,\" Mr. Yamamoto said in a calm voice that cut through the silence like a knife. \"I know you're anxious to know who's going to start the first game, but I'm going to reflect about it. It's not the kind of thing you decide on the spur of the moment. I'm going to watch the training footage, analyze each of you, and consider not just today's performance, but your effort, your dedication, and your tactics. You deserve that consideration.\"\n\nThere was a collective murmur of mixed relief and a minor disappointment. Lucas felt a mixture of conflicting emotions. Part of him was relieved that there was no immediate decision, but another part longed to know the outcome.\n\n\"I will send a message to each of you individually later, informing you of my decision and the reason for it,\" Mr. Yamamoto continued, nodding. \"For now, you are dismissed. Rest, rehydrate, and prepare for Saturday. Remember, the road to victory is paved with hard work and perseverance.\"\n\nThe players began to disperse, walking slowly toward the locker rooms.\n\nLucas dragged himself along with them, feeling the weight of fatigue on his shoulders. He entered the locker room and began to change. Every movement seemed more difficult when he was too tired, but as a former office worker with back pain, it wasn't that bothersome.\n\nAs he walked to the school's exit gate, Lucas saw someone standing there waiting for him. It was Baro.\n\n\"Shall we go?\" Baro asked with his usual serious face.\n\n\"Yes.\" Lucas replied.\n\nHowever, Baro noticed that Lucas' answer seemed more automatic than usual, so he asked:\n\n\"You're still thinking about the game, aren't you?\"\n\nLucas nodded.\n\n\"Are you worried about not being in the starting lineup because you played badly today? If so, don't worry too much. The coach will look at your performance in other training sessions and you played well when you came on at the end. You even scored a goal.\"\n\n\"I know, but the competition in the first team midfield is very tough. Even if I played well for a few minutes, it might not be enough and...\"\n\nSlap!\n\nSuddenly, Baro slapped Lucas' back. \"Don't overthink it, Tanaka! Just trust...\"\n\n\"It's easy to talk about being the team's leading scorer and... Wait a minute, why do you call me by my second name and when it's Kenji, you call him by his first name?\" Lucas stopped walking and asked.\n\nBaro gave him a puzzled look. Lucas' question seemed to have an obvious answer, but it wasn't obvious to Lucas. Baro looked down and scratched the back of his head, a nervous habit.\n\n\"Ah, so you forgot our promise...\" Baro began, his tone lower than usual.\n\n\"Promise?\"\n\n\"Do you remember when we were sitting on the park field after a game a few years ago? We were talking about the names we wanted on our jerseys when we turned pro.\"\n\nLucas blinked, trying to remember. The last fourteen stressful years had etched over many of his old memories, erasing most of them, but then the aforementioned memory slowly resurfaced.\n\nOn that day, Lucas Baro was laughing and dreaming far into the future.\n\n\"Ah, yes...\" Lucas murmured as the pieces fell into place. \"I chose Tanaka because...\"\n\n\"Because it's your grandfather's name, and you said you wanted to honor him.\" Baro added with a slight smile. \"And I chose Baro because, well, it's my family name.\"\n\nLucas laughed. \"Sound cool? It doesn't sound like something you would do these days.\"\n\n\"But it's a promise. I won't change it until we go pro.\"\n\nSo many years had passed since Lucas had a casual conversation with Baro. It was too nostalgic for Lucas to walk home in the evening.\n\nHe and Baro had been close friends since they were kids, because although they had different personalities, they shared the dream of becoming professional soccer players.\n\nHowever, that friendship ended sooner than either of them expected, specifically after that summer league. In Lucas' past life, Baro had a great championship and was the second highest scorer, while Lucas did what his position required and distributed passes. In the end, Baro was chosen to participate in the JFA's big project to change Japanese soccer: the Blue Lock. And Lucas Tanaka went on to play in regional championships with Wushia College until the end of high school.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSupport me to write more and you can read up to 20 advanced chapters!\n\nP-atreon.com/palmer_1998\n\n(Just remove the hyphen to access Patreon normally.)\n\nNEXT CHAPTERS:\n\n04 - Copy Conditions\n\n05 - The End of the Training Game\n\n06 - Days that seemed so far away\n\n06.5 - Back to the family\n\n07 - Star Level\n\n08 - Daily Mission\n\n09 - Shoei Baro\n\n10 - <Stellar Impulse>\n\n11 - Chubu Region Summer Championship\n\n12 - Rival Schools\n\n13 - Tactical Formation\n\n14 - Being a substitute is bad\n\n15 - Troubleshooter\n\n16 - Evolution\n\n17 - Injury\n\n18 - Option to Pass\n\nIn his former life, Lucas Tanaka wasn't very close to his family. However, growing up and moving away from them hurt more than he could have imagined.\n\nHe had a mother who ran the household. A woman with delicate features, almond eyes, and black hair. Her name was Ayumi Tanaka.\n\nAyumi was traveling to the United States when she met Lucas' father, John Tanaka, an American with black hair and blue eyes.\n\nJohn was a man of medium height, with an air of seriousness that was often intimidating, but a gentle smile that could warm anyone's heart.\n\nLucas also had a younger sister. Hana was her name, a bright and vibrant girl, only three years younger than Lucas, or thirteen. They had always been close, perhaps because they were close in age.\n\nAlthough not a family with much conflict, the Tanaka family had its challenges. John worked relentlessly at a patent office, putting in long hours to provide a stable life for his family. Ayumi, on the other hand, devoted herself to the home and the small flower shop she owned in the neighborhood.\n\nRunning the flower shop took a lot out of Ayumi, often leaving her exhausted at the end of the day, so Lucas and Hana always helped her keep the house organized.\n\nLucas grew up seeing the sacrifices his parents made. He would see his father go out early and come back late, almost always looking tired, yet trying to hide the dark circles under his glasses and his exhaustion with a forced smile. This was one of the main reasons why Lucas had so \"easily\" given up his dream of becoming a professional soccer player. He didn't want to burden his parents with his decisions.\n\n\"For these reasons, I need to become a professional as soon as possible and secure a salary! That way, my parents can enjoy life more!\" Lucas said to himself as he stood at the door of his house.\n\nThen Lucas looked at his house again and admired it. It wasn't an immense house, but it was the house he lived in until he moved to Tokyo to go to college, so it brought back so many memories. He touched the doorknob in front of him, turned it, and saw his house after so long.\n\nThe door creaked softly as it opened, like a welcome. He entered slowly and stood there in shock. Everything was just as he remembered it. The bright yellow walls of the foyer, the familiar smell of fresh flowers, and the cozy feeling of being home again filled his senses. However, the house seemed empty, shrouded in a silence that almost made him doubt if anyone was really there. He took a few tentative steps, listening to the muffled sound of his own shoes on the wooden floor, and began to remove his shoes.\n\nThen Lucas heard the faint sound of footsteps coming down the stairs, followed by an excited cry.\n\n\"Lucas!\" Hana, his sister, appeared at the top of the stairs. Her face beamed with joy.\n\nShe quickly descended the stairs, skipping the last two steps to fall straight down, and excitedly approach her brother.\n\n\"How many goals have you scored today? Six?! No, seven?!\" she asked excitedly.\n\nJust then, Ayumi Tanaka appeared at the end of the main corridor, drying her hands with a dishcloth. She looked at her son and said, \"Son, I'm glad you're okay,\" she said. \"Welcome back.\"\n\nLucas felt an overwhelming emotion when he saw her. He blinked quickly to keep the tears from forming. The sight of his mother and sister contrasted sharply with the memories of the loneliness of his small apartment in Tokyo, where he felt so alone every night.\n\n\"How are you, Mom?\" he asked, his voice cracking a little.\n\n\"We're all fine, aren't we?\" replied Ayumi, looking a little worried.\n\n\"It's nothing. I'm just a little tired.\"\n\nAyumi smiled proudly. \"That means you're hungry. Get out of your sweaty clothes and take a shower, then come down for dinner.\"\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nSupport me to write more and you can read up to 20 advanced chapters!\n\nP-atreon.com/palmer_1998\n\n(Just remove the hyphen to access Patreon normally.)\n\nNEXT CHAPTERS:\n\n06.5 - Back to the family\n\n07 - Star Level\n\n08 - Daily Mission\n\n09 - Shoei Baro\n\n10 - <Stellar Impulse>\n\n11 - Chubu Region Summer Championship\n\n12 - Rival Schools\n\n13 - Tactical Formation\n\n14 - Being a substitute is bad\n\n15 - Troubleshooter\n\n16 - Evolution\n\n17 - Injury\n\n18 - Option to Pass"
