        "text": "The sun shines through the window; sunlight filters through the sheer curtains, casting a warm, golden glow across the room. In this serene setting, Davy is just beginning to wake up. He stired beneath the covers, slowly blinking away the remnants of sleep. His hair is tousled, and his face is still soft and relaxed from a night of rest. He stretched his arms listlessly, reaching his arms above his head with a contented sigh, as if savoring the last few moments of comfort before fully embracing the day.\n\n\"Good morning, Glaceon.\" He greeted Glaceon half asleep on the chair and wrapped in her mattress. Slowly opening her eyes, a she replied with a gentle purr and a big yawn, they spent a bit more time in bed before deciding to go down and have breakfast. Walking down the stairs, they could hear the noises of someone cooking on the kitchen; the sizzling sound of something being stir fried, its aroma is rich and invigorating.\n\nOn the outside, they could hear the birds chirping and the gentle wind breeze of winter. The scenery outside reminded Davy that spring has come, snow started to melt and flowers started to bloom albeit slowly. Soon later a woman came out of the kitchen. \"Good morning, Davy.\" Her voice seems low, her face, gloomy and apologetic.\n\n\"Good morning, Enya, I'll help you out.\"\n\n\"No, it's fine, it's just the plates and utensils remaining anyway.\"\n\n\"I'll go get them.\" He then walked to the kitchen before Enya could reply.\n\nIn his hands were two white glass plates and two pairs of spoon and fork. He then gently put them on the table where they are seated. Together, they ate in awkward silence. Enya kept looking at Davy.\n\n\"Is there something on my face?\" He asked while scratching his chin.\n\n\"N-no, nothing is there don't worry.\" They continued eating, her eyes still glued to him as if trying to look directly at his soul. After eating, Davy took a shower and then got ready to go to the lab. As he was about to leave, Enya grabbed his hand.\n\n\"I want to apologize.\"\n\nHis brows furrowed, looking back at her, he could not tell why she was apologizing.\n\nWhy does she want to apologize? I don't remember anything that happened.'\n\n\"I might have hurt your feelings yesterday because of my blabbering. I'm sorry.\" She lowered her head and bowed\n\n\"It's alright, I'm used to it and actually, I want to thank you for that.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nHer brows furrowed, on her face is genuine confusion. Davy smiled and scratched the back of his head and continued. \"Thanks to our talk last night, I found a determination to look forward and try to find what I can do. So, thanks.\" He looks down, his face slightly blushing.\n\nEnya looked at him in surprise, before giving a warm smile. She held both his hand’s, her smile grew wider as she spoke. \"I'm glad, I'll help you on finding your way, you can count on me!\" They left the house together afterwards.\n\n***\n\nAt the lab, Enya was tending to the egg. A flashlight like tool as placed on top of the egg, she was trying to see the silhouette inside the egg, to see what kind of pokemon it is. Contrary to her expectations, the egg doesn't show any kind of silhouette, its hard and thick shell covering every spot of the egg, making it impossible to see what's inside. She sat on the chair near the door. Enya decided to help Davy on finding his purpose, it is a spur of the moment decision she made. Thinking about the mystery that surrounds Davy, she can't help but wonder what her choice will lead her to.\n\nLunch came and the group gathered at the garden at the lab's backyard. The food is ready, and the sight of the snow melting compliments the warm sunlight that's permeating from the sun, giving a subtle and beautiful scenery.\n\n\"What's the problem Dawn? You've sighting since earlier.\" Asked Roseanne.\n\n\"It's nothing, I just feel so bored. There's nothing for us to do here aside from all this repetitive work. I just wish the season starts already so at least I won't get this bored.\" With another sigh, Dawn slumped back on her chair, arms stretched forward on the table.\n\nTime passes by and it’s time for Josue and Roseanne to get to work, while the rest have nothing more to do. Enya bought the egg with her strapped on her back.\n\n\"Hey, Davy, I forgot to introduce you to the town, want me to give you a tour of the town?\" Dawn asked.\n\n\"A tour?! I'll go with you!\" Enya beamed and offered to come.\n\n\"The more the merrier. So, what do say Davy?\"\n\n\"I guess I'll take you up on that offer.\" Davy never explored the town, there's no harm on getting to know the people that lives here.\n\nEnya puts the egg back at the lab, before going.\n\n***\n\nTogether, Enya Dawn and Davy toured Sandgem Town. They introduced Davy to the residents one by one. Sandgem town isn't very big, its population is on the low side, even so, the people here is friendly and accepting. The kids would show Davy their pokemon, and he would try to pet them, resulting in getting bit or scratched.\n\n\"And this, is my house.\" Dawn showed them where she lived with her family. She invited them both inside, which they accepted. The house is normal, with a kitchen, living room, bed rooms and toilets. The furniture inside looked normal. The chairs and the couch are made of soft and fluffy fabric, while the table and the shelves are made of oak wood. The only things that stand out is the ribbons on the shelves. Each of them is different, showing the different contests they're from. There are three shelves on the living room. Each have different amounts of ribbons, the lowest only having five different ones.\n\n\"Mom! I'm home!\"\n\n\"Dawn welcome home. Oh? Welcome, Enya, And, you must be Davy, the new assistant of Professor Rowan?\" She gestured at them to sit at the living room as she serves tea.\n\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you ma'am, yes my name is Davy, Davy Miles.\"\n\n\"You can just call me Johanna.\"\n\n\"Thank you miss Johanna, Dawn has taken good care for me and taught me well at work.\"\n\n\"That's good to hear. How have you been Enya?\" She asked Enya as she pours the tea.\n\n\"I've been fine miss Johanna, thanks for your concern.\" They exchanged pleasantries and did small talk before Davy's eyes landed on the ribbons on the shelves.\n\n\"May I ask what those are miss Johanna?\"\n\n\"No need to be formal, Davy. Those are the ribbons we won on contests. The shelf on the right is my husband, Josue. The one on the left is mine, while the last one on the middle is Dawn's\"\n\nJohanna explained where each of the ribbons came from. There are ones that came from other regions and ones that is local. Some even is limited and entitled to their name.\n\n\"This one is from Dawn's first ever win on a contest. I remember her crying out when she first won it, it was so-\"\n\n\"Mom! no need to say that part!\" Dawn embarrassed, stop Johanna from saying anything more.\n\n\"Miss Johanna, I'm interested, please tell us more!\" Enya made a wry smile and looked at Dawn in the eyes.\n\nIf you encounter this story on Amazon, note that it's taken without permission from the author. Report it.\n\nDawn, annoyed and frustrated, tried to compromise.\n\n\"Mom! I'll tell them myself, so you don't need to say anything anymore!\"\n\n\"Please tell us, Miss, Dawn.\" Davy watched all this time, not giving any comment or opinions.\n\n\"I'll tell you when we get back at the lab next time, the sun is going down I think you two should go ba-\" The front door opened and a girl, not older than 16, came in.\n\n\"Welcome back Joanna.\" Johanna greeted.\n\n\"I'm back mom.\" Her eyes landed on Enya. \"Sister Enya!\" Joanna rushed to hug Enya.\n\n\"Did you play out all this time?\" Enya asked.\n\n\"Yes, I had fun!\" Her smile beamed. She looks so comfortable around Enya.\n\n\"I'm sure you did, but don't play out late, okay? Or else Darkrai will visit you in your dreams and devour your dreams!\" She raised her hands, trying to look intimidating while scaring Joanna, which fails.\n\n\"Joanna, greet Mr. Davy first.\" Johanna scolded her. She goes over to Davy shyly.\n\n\"Um... Hello Mr. Davy.\"\n\n\"Hi, Joanna.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nAn awkward silence came. Both doesn't know how to continue the conversation. Sweat start to form as Davy started to feel the look of everyone directed at them.\n\n'What do I do?! Come on me! say something!'\n\nJohanna, unable to endure the awkward silence, quickly added. \"He's the newest assistant of Professor Rowan, dad and Dawn's new colleague.\"\n\nWith that, Joanna's eyes beamed, she then asked him a lot of questions. \"How did you meet Professor Rowan?! What kind of work do you do?! Have you been at any research project?! What's your favorite pokemon?!\"\n\nDavy was bombarded with questions. The seemingly shy girl was replaced with a whirlwind of curiosity and enthusiasm. Joanna, now brimming with energy, eagerly inquired about his experiences, his thoughts on various Pokémon, and his impressions of the research they were conducting.\n\n\"Alright missy, that's enough. The sun is going down and Enya and Davy still have to go home.\" Johanna calmed down the living questionnaire and led Davy and Enya at the door.\n\n\"Then I'll walk you guys back\" As they are about to leave, Dawn's phone rang. \"I'm sorry, I can't walk you back, Professor Rowan just sent me some documents that needs urgent processing.\" Dawn apologized. The sudden call was unexpected but it can't be helped.\n\n\"It's fine, we can walk back ourselves, and thank you for the tour, I enjoyed it.\" Davy replied with a genuine smile.\n\n\"Comeback again, Enya, Davy and please tell Josue to come home already, it’s getting late.\"\n\n\"We will miss Johanna, and thank you for the hospitality.\" Davy and Enya said their goodbyes and goes on their way back\n\nThey walked back at the lab. On their way Davy can't help but get mesmerized by the twilight. \"It's so calming and beautiful.\"\n\n\"I know right, even in Kalos, it's hard to find a place like this.\" Enya commented as she walks on backward facing Davy.\n\nThe place brings a tranquil blend of coastal charm and urban serenity. The sky deepens from bright blue to soft shades of orange and pink, casting a warm glow over the town. Streetlights begin to flicker on, adding a gentle illumination to the quaint streets. The distant sound of waves crashing against the shore mixes with the soft hum of evening activity. Shops and cafes near the beach cast a cozy, inviting light, and the cool breeze carries a hint of sea salt. The town slowly shifts from the day’s buzz to a peaceful, relaxed ambiance as night falls.\n\nReaching the lab, they found Josue and delivered Johanna's message. Josue was still inside the lab, processing some papers and research results while drinking coffee.\n\n\"Thank you, I'll be back home soon, I just have to finish organizing this, it won't take long. He reassured, and they both goes on their way home, leaving the still working Josue.\n\nThe rest of the night was bland and uneventful. Walking back home in silence, eating dinner while having small talk and watching poketube before going to bed.\n\n'This life is nice, I wish everyday is like this.'\n\n*** Time skip ***\n\nIt's been a month since he started working for Professor Rowan The amount of work he was given increased. Each of them leaning more and more towards outdoor activity. Because of that, Davy started working out and training Glaceon. Davy trained his muscles to be tougher and harder; each exercise and workout he does is focused on stamina, endurance, and leg training. In just a month, the results of this were noticeable. His previously slender frame had hardened and became tougher and he could feel the difference in his strength and agility. His legs, once merely strong, now felt like powerful. The increased endurance allowed him to push through longer, more intense sessions without feeling the same fatigue.\n\nGlaceon who was already, nimble and fast, focused on her control. Her Icy wind became stronger, resulting on her learning the move Ice shard. From time to time, Davy and Glaceon goes into the forest to find pokemon that they can fight. Each time Glaceon beats her opponent, Davy would record the moves used and their progress. Occasionally Davy would just watch Glaceon fight on her own to see the natural way she fights, and to prepare her, for the time when they will start to challenge the gyms.\n\nEarly morning, Davy wakes up in bed, Glaceon was in her usual spot Sleeping soundly. The morning was normal like the days before. They got up and goes down excitedly to eat. It's his first salary and he can finally pay back Enya for the food.\n\n\"Excited, aren't we?\" She teased with a smile on her face while pointing the fork at him.\n\n\"Ahaha, Is it that obvious?\"\n\n\"It's literally on your face. You kept grinning like an idiot.\" Enya and Davy got closer, aside from sharing the same house, they're the only ones with the same age that isn't very busy. Roseanne was always on the lab doing research and Dawn sometimes can't follow their conversation.\n\n\"Remember, you have to pay me for last month’s food okay, I'm not doing a charity here.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll pay you.\" He grumbles and continued eating his food.\n\n'Enya is so friendly, If not for her taking the first step, we wouldn't be this close even if we're living on the same house'\n\n'She's so sharp, and she always knows how to help me... or tease me to oblivion... or prank me till death.'\n\nMemories living with her this last month was warm and terrifying. Enya would just come out of the door with nothing but a towel, sometimes she would sneak up behind and Davy and scare him. Her antics was nothing but normal. One time she made her VIvilion spread powder at the front of Davy's room, resulting in his nonstop sneezing for an hour. One time, she made Glaceon sit on the freezer for hours because it broke. Of course, Glaceon didn't like that so she blew up the freezer with ice shards. Aside from that, she was been helpful. She filled up Davy's missing knowledge on pokemons in general, and helped Davy on training Glaceon. She's also knowlegable on certain topics like economics, pokefood mixes and regional specialties.\n\n\"What would you buy with your first salary?\" She asked.\n\n\"I'll buy a few pokeball then I'll save up the rest.\" Davy already planned up what he'll do for his first salary, aside from food expenses, buying some pokeballs and some pocket money, he plans to save up the rest for future use. No one knows what will happen on the future so it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\n\"Then let's get you a bank account. It's secured and you'll gain interest overtime.\"\n\n\"I've searched it up actually, and the interest in all banks is just...\"\n\n\"Low, miniscule, unimpressive?\" She snickered.\n\n\"Yes, it's unsavory.\" They both laughed and finished eating.\n\nAt the lab, everyone gathered at Professor Rowan's office to receive their salary. On his desk were two envelopes and a few papers and folders. One of the folders are labeled \"Classified\". Everyone noticed the folder. Roseanne, Davy and Josue seem to hide their curiosity while Dawn is clearly showing her own, Enya on the other hand seems unbothered by it.\n\n\"I gathered everyone here today not just because it’s time for your salaries, but also about the research project that we'll do a week from now.\" He looked at everyone before continuing. \"Lucas and Barry are busy investigating Mt Coronet along with Cynthia. As everyone already knows, I've also gone there a month ago.\"\n\n\"Professor, I thought it was dismissed as just a stronger blizzard. Are you saying that it's still not finished and someone or something is behind it?\" Josue asked.\n\n\"Yes, it was dismissed as just a stronger blizzard. But it isn't that simple. Currently we don't know the reason behind it, that's why Champion Cynthia is personally investigating it. But we're sure it's something related to the Legends and the origin of Sinnoh.\"\n\n\"What evidence do you have Professor?\" Roseanne asked\n\n\"During that time, the citizens saw a flash of light appear on top of the mountain, it was so bright that they can see it even through the harsh blizzard. It leads us to believe that one of the ancient deities are involved.\"\n\n\"But if what you're saying is right, then we should have seen a flash of light ourselves if it comes from the peak of Mt Coronet.\" Enya was right, if it is that strong of a light then it should've been seen throughout Sinnoh. As the conversation continues, Davy started to get more and more nervous. Enya's argument made so much sense and further increased his anxiety.\n\n\"Have you heard of the legend of Palkia. It is said that he can bend space at its will,\"\n\n\"Are you saying that the people there saw Palkia on the mountain?\" Dawn asked.\n\nProfessor Rowan then opened his computer and showed everyone a video. The place in the video is undoubtedly at Snowpoint City. The blizzard was already so strong that it’s hard to see. Everyone watched the video for a few minutes but nothing happened.\n\n\"Professor what are you trying to show us?\" Enya asked.\n\n\"Just keep watching.\"\n\nA few more minutes goes by and as the video is about to end, it happened. A huge flash of light can be seen on top of the mountain, its rays shined, the light was so blinding, that the person on the video shielded their eyes and dropped the camera. Moments passed and the light finally dissipated, on the top of the mountain a silhouette can be seen. It was a blur but everyone could see a figure standing on there. Professor Rowan zoomed at the silhouette and the shape and form could now be seen.\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nEveryone was speechless and their eyes widened, unable to process what they had seen.\n\n\"This is highly classified information and should not be released on public. Our lab is entrusted with keeping this information and making detailed analysis on the subject.\"\n\nDavy himself could not believe what he has seen. He did saw a light when he was about to die. But who would have thought that the same light, stronger and brighter one appeared.\n\nProfessor Rowan continued. \"They will send us reports of their findings and we will be the ones that will analyze it and report it to the champion directly. I trust everyone here, so please take this task with outmost care and caution. You're all dismissed.\"\n\nNo words were exchanged after that. Everyone started to leave one by one.\n\n\"Davy, there's something I would like to talk to you about.\"\n\nExcept for Davy"
