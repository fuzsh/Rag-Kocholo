        "text": "RENO, Nev. (KOLO) - On July 16, 2024, the Washoe County Commission did an about-face on a vote they took just one week before.\n\nOn a vote of four to one, the commission certified a recount of two races conducted during the primary election in June.\n\nIn the week between votes, Nevada’s secretary of state and attorney general filed a writ of mandamus with the Nevada Supreme Court asking for clarification on what county commissioners can do as it applies to canvassing the vote.\n\n“When people go and vote they expect that vote to count. And when a commissioner decides not to certify an election, they are taking away that right to vote,” says Cisco Aguilar, Nevada Secretary of State. “Our right to vote is a fundamental right. And it is an obligation of the elected official to do their responsibility and follow Nevada law to ensure the vote gets certified.”\n\nAguilar says in his and the attorney general’s opinion the law is very clear. In their writ of mandamus to the highest court in Nevada, they spell it out to justices: According to state law, county commissions canvass the vote.\n\nWashoe County Commission’s reversal doesn’t change any of that.\n\nBut according to Aguilar other county commissioners throughout the state may decide to not canvass the vote in November for the presidential race.\n\nThat could have a cascade effect with Nevada’s electoral votes held in limbo.\n\n“There are certain individuals should not have a voice in the future of our state of Nevada,” says Aguilar. “There are some people deciding whose voice should be heard. And that is unacceptable. What we are saying is every vote should be counted and every voice should be heard in this state, no matter where they live.”\n\nAguilar says he can’t tell the Supreme Court when to release their opinion. But he hopes it is sooner rather than later.\n\nThat way county commissions and commissioners will understand what state law is before the November Election."
