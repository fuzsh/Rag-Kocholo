        "text": "Good morning, Michigan and Happy Election Day! Not registered to vote? Didn't cast an absentee ballot or vote early? No need to worry! There's still time to participate and make sure your voice is heard as long as you're in line by 8 p.m.\n\nHead over to your local clerk's office to register to vote. Or, if you're already registered to vote, you can go to your polling place to vote in person.\n\nThe primary election will decide the Democratic and Republican candidates for U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, Michigan House of Representatives and local offices. Local millage proposals may also be on your ballot.\n\nNot sure if you're registered to vote? You can look that up!\n\nIf you're unsure whether you're registered to vote, you can check your status online using the Michigan Secretary of State's voter information center.\n\nGo to mvic.sos.state.mi.us and click \"Am I registered?\" Enter your first name, last name, birth month, birth year and ZIP code. You can also search your registration status by entering your driver's license number, driver's license birth month and driver's license birth year.\n\nHow to register to vote in Michigan on Election Day\n\nNot registered to vote? You still can today if you live in Michigan, are a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years old and are not currently serving a sentence in jail or prison.\n\nGo to your local clerk's office and bring documentation to prove your residency with you.\n\nYou can find the address for your clerk's office using the Secretary of State's Michigan Voter Information Center available at mvic.sos.state.mi.us. Under \"Your voter information,\" click on \"Where are my clerk's offices?\" Enter your address or search by your county and click on the municipality where you live.\n\nTo prove your residency, you'll need paper or digital documentation with your name and address. That could be your driver's license, state ID, U.S. passport, a utility bill, insurance document, bank or credit card statement, financial aid or school enrollment document, a lease agreement, a paycheck or other government check or another government document, according to a list on the Secretary of State's website.\n\nIf you're unhoused and registering to vote on Election Day, you can prove your residency by bringing a letter from a shelter, place of worship or public assistance agency you interact with that includes your name and states that you live in the jurisdiction, according to the Secretary of State's Office.\n\nAs soon as you're registered, you have two options for casting a ballot. Those registering to vote on Election Day can request an absentee ballot to fill out and submit at your clerk's office. As long as you're in line at your clerk's office by 8 p.m., you can register to vote and cast an absentee ballot. If you choose to visit your polling location instead after registering to vote at your clerk's office on Election Day, you must be in line by 8 p.m. to cast a ballot.\n\nMichigan Voter Guide: Key Races\n\nHow to find your polling place to vote in-person on Election Day\n\nIf you're already registered to vote, you can head over to your polling location to cast a ballot between the hours of 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. If you're in line by 8 p.m., you can vote.\n\nYou can find your polling location using the Secretary of State's Michigan Voter Information Center available at mvic.sos.state.mi.us.
