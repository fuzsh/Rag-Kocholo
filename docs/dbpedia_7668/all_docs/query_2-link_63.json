And life is better when you go with your gut. Breakfast for Dinner? Right on. Or maybe it's a little sweet and savory mixed together. Because you're into that sort of thing. Because we're into that sort of thing. And that sort of thing should be celebrated.\n\nYou want what you want. We're here for it.\n\nGreat food, great service, great relaxed ambience, what more can you ask for?! Been here 3 times, brunch, lunch and dinner. Every dish was good. All servers were so friendly and knowledgeable. Each dish is huge, even if you come hungry, you're probably still leaving with take out.\n\nTony N\n\nTampa, FL\n\nThis is the best and one of the most economical place to go for breakfast or lunch. The service is phenomenal and the staff is always happy and cheerful. Food comes out freshly made to your desire in a very efficient manner. One of my all time favorite spots in Jacksonville.\n\nStephanie A\n\nJacksonville, FL"
