        "text": "County in California, United States\n\nCounty in California, United States\n\nOrange County (officially the County of Orange; often known by its initials O.C.) is a county located in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in Southern California, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 3,186,989,[4] making it the third-most-populous county in California, the sixth-most-populous in the United States, and more populous than 19 American states and Washington, D.C.[6] Although largely suburban, it is the second-most-densely-populated county in the state behind San Francisco County.[7] The county's three most-populous cities are Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine, each of which has a population exceeding 300,000.[8] Santa Ana is also the county seat. Six cities in Orange County are on the Pacific coast: Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, and San Clemente.\n\nOrange County is included in the Los Angeles–Long Beach–Anaheim Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county has 34 incorporated cities. Older cities like Tustin, Santa Ana, Anaheim, Orange, and Fullerton have traditional downtowns dating back to the 19th century, while newer commercial development or \"edge cities\" stretch along the Interstate 5 (Santa Ana) Freeway between Disneyland and Santa Ana and between South Coast Plaza and the Irvine Business Complex, and cluster at Irvine Spectrum. Although single-family homes make up the dominant landscape of most of the county, northern and central Orange County is relatively more urbanized and dense as compared to those areas south of Irvine, which are less dense, though still contiguous and primarily suburban rather than exurban.\n\nThe county is a tourist center, with attractions like Disneyland Resort, Knott's Berry Farm, Mission San Juan Capistrano, Huntington Beach Pier, the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, Modjeska House, Segerstrom Center for the Arts, Yost Theater, Bowers Museum, Balboa Island, Angel Stadium, Downtown Santa Ana, Crystal Cove Historic District, the Honda Center, the Old Orange County Courthouse, the Irvine Ranch Natural Landmarks, and several popular beaches along its more than 40 mi (64 km) of coastline. It is also home to a major research university, the University of California, Irvine (UCI), along with a number of other notable colleges and universities such as Chapman University and Cal State Fullerton.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIndigenous\n\n[edit]\n\nArcheological evidence shows the area to have been inhabited beginning about 9,500 years ago.[10] At the time of European contact, the northern area of what is now Orange County was primarily inhabited by the Tongva indigenous people, a part of Tovaangar, while the southern area of the county, below Aliso Creek, was primarily inhabited by the Acjachemen.[11][12] Both groups lived in villages throughout the area. Large villages were sometimes multiethnic and multilingual, such as Genga, located in what is now Newport Beach. The village was shared by the Tongva and Acjachemen.[13] The village of Puhú was located in what is now Black Star Canyon and was shared by multiple groups, including the Tongva, Acjachemen, Serrano and Payómkawichum.[14]\n\nThe mother village of the Acjachemen was Putiidhem and is now located in San Juan Capistrano underneath Junipero Serra Catholic High School.[15][16] For the Tongva, north Orange County was at the southern extent of their village sites.[17] In coastal villages like Lupukngna, at least 3,000 years old located in what is now Huntington Beach, villagers likely used te'aats or plank boats to navigate the coastline, with fish and shellfish being more central to the diet.[18][19] In inland villages such as Hutuknga, rabbit and mule deer were more central, in addition to acorns from oak trees and seeds from grasses and sage bushes common everywhere.[20]\n\nSpanish mission period\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the 1769 expedition of Gaspar de Portolà, a Spanish expedition led by Junipero Serra named the area Valle de Santa Ana (Valley of Saint Anne).[22] On November 1, 1776, Mission San Juan Capistrano became the area's first permanent European settlement. Among those who came with Portolá were José Manuel Nieto and José Antonio Yorba. Both these men were given land grants—Rancho Los Nietos and Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, respectively.[23]\n\nThe Nieto heirs were granted land in 1834. The Nieto ranches were known as Rancho Los Alamitos, Rancho Las Bolsas, and Rancho Los Coyotes. Yorba heirs Bernardo Yorba and Teodosio Yorba were also granted Rancho Cañón de Santa Ana (Santa Ana Canyon Ranch) and Rancho Lomas de Santiago, respectively. Other ranchos in Orange County were granted by the Mexican government during the Mexican period in Alta California.[23]\n\nSaint Junípero Serra y Ferrer and the early components of the Portolá Expedition arrived in modern-day San Diego, south of present-day Orange County, in mid-late 1769. During these early Mission years, however, the early immigrants continued to rely on imports of both Mexican-grown and Spanish-grown wines; Serra repeatedly complained of the process of repeated, labored import.[24] The first grape crop production was produced in 1782 at San Juan Capistrano, with vines potentially brought through supply ships in 1778.[24]\n\n19th century\n\n[edit]\n\nViticulture became an increasingly important crop in Los Angeles and Orange Counties through the subsequent decades. By the 1850s, the regions supported more than 100 vineyards.[25] In 1857, Anaheim was founded by 50 German-Americans (with lineage extending back to Franconia) in search of a suitable grape-growing region.[26] This group purchased a 1,165 acres (4.71 km2) parcel from Juan Pacifico Ontiveros's Rancho San Juan Cajon de Santa Ana for $2 per acre and later formed the Anaheim Vineyard Company.[27][25] With surveyor George Hansen, two of the wine colony's founders, John Frohling and Charles Kohler, planted 400,000 grapevines along the Santa Ana River; by 1875, \"there were as many as 50 wineries in Anaheim, and the city's wine production topped 1 million gallons annually.\"[25] Despite later afflictions of both Phylloxera and Pierce's Disease, wine growing is still practiced.[28]\n\nA severe drought in the 1860s devastated the prevailing industry, cattle ranching, and much land came into the possession of Richard O'Neill Sr.[29] James Irvine and other land barons. In 1887, silver was discovered in the Santa Ana Mountains, attracting settlers via the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads. High rates of Anglo migration gradually moved Mexicans into colonias, or segregated ethnic enclaves.[30]\n\nCounty establishment\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter several failed attempts in previous sessions, the California State Legislature passed a bill authorizing the portion of Los Angeles County south of Coyote Creek to hold a referendum on whether to remain part of Los Angeles County or to secede and form a new county to be named \"Orange\" as directed by the legislature. The referendum required a 2/3 vote for secession to take place, and on June 4, 1889, the vote was 2,509 to 500 in favor of secession. After the referendum, Los Angeles County filed three lawsuits to prevent the secession,[citation needed] but their attempts were futile.[citation needed]\n\nOn July 17, 1889, a second referendum was held south of the Coyote Creek to determine if the county seat of the new county would be Anaheim or Santa Ana, along with an election for every county officer. Santa Ana defeated Anaheim in the referendum. With the referendum having passed, the County of Orange was officially incorporated on August 1, 1889.[31] Since the incorporation of the county, the only geographical changes made to the boundary was when the County and Los Angeles County traded some parcels of land around Coyote Creek to conform to city blocks.[when?]\n\nThe county is said to have been named for the citrus fruit in an attempt to promote immigration by suggesting a semi-tropical paradise – a place where anything could grow.[32]\n\nIn 1919, the California State Legislature redefined the county's boundary with Los Angeles County to no longer follow Coyote Creek but instead along Public Land Survey System township lines instead.[33]\n\n20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nOther citrus crops, avocados, and oil extraction were also important to the early economy. Orange County benefited from the July 4, 1904, completion of the Pacific Electric Railway, a trolley connecting Los Angeles with Santa Ana and Newport Beach. The link made Orange County an accessible weekend retreat for celebrities of early Hollywood. It was deemed so significant that Pacific City changed its name to Huntington Beach in honor of Henry E. Huntington, president of the Pacific Electric and nephew of Collis Huntington. Transportation further improved with the completion of the State Route and U.S. Route 101 (now mostly Interstate 5) in the 1920s.\n\nIn the 1910s, agriculture in Orange County was largely centered on grains, hay, and potatoes by small farmers, accounting for 60% of the county's exports. The Segerstroms and Irvines once produced so many lima beans that the county was called \"Beanville\".[34] By 1920, fruit and nut exports exploded, which led to the increase of industrialized farming and the decline of family farms. For example, by 1917, William Chapman came to own 350,000 acres in northeastern Orange County from the Valencia orange.[35] Around the 1910s and 1920s, most of the barrios of Orange County, such as in Santa Ana, further developed as company towns of Mexican laborers, who worked in the industrial orange groves.[36] Poor working conditions resulted in the Citrus Strike of 1936, in which more than half of the orange industry's workforce, largely Mexican, demanded better working conditions. The strike was heavily repressed, with forced evictions and state-sanctioned violence being used as tactics of suppression.[37] Carey McWilliams referred to the suppression as \"the toughest violation of civil rights in the nation.\"[30]\n\nThe Los Angeles flood of 1938 devastated some areas of Orange County, with most of the effects being in Santa Ana and Anaheim, which were flooded with six feet of water. As an eight-foot-high rush of water further spilled out of the Santa Ana Canyon, forty-three people were killed in the predominately Mexican communities of Atwood and La Jolla in Placentia.[38] The devastation from this event, as well as from the 1939 California tropical storm, meant that Orange County was in need of new infrastructure, which was supported by the New Deal. This included the construction of numerous schools, city halls, post offices, parks, libraries, and fire stations, as well as the improvement of road infrastructure throughout Orange County.[39]\n\nSchool segregation between Mexican and white students in Orange County was widespread in the mid-1940s, with 80% of Mexican students attending 14 segregated schools. These schools taught Mexican children manual education – or gardening, bootmaking, blacksmithing, and carpentry for Mexican boys and sewing and homemaking for girls – while white schools taught academic preparation.[40] The landmark case Mendez vs. Westminster (1947) desegregated Orange County schools, after the Mendez family were denied enrollment into the 17th Street School in Westminster in 1944, despite their cousins with lighter skin being admitted, and were instead told to enroll at the Hoover Elementary School for Mexican children.[41]\n\nIn the 1950s, agriculture, such as that involving the boysenberries made famous by Buena Park native Walter Knott, began to decline. However, the county's prosperity soared during this time. The completion of Interstate 5 in 1954 helped make Orange County a bedroom community for many who moved to Southern California to work in aerospace and manufacturing.[42] Orange County received a further economic boost in 1955 with the opening of Disneyland.\n\nIn 1969, Yorba Linda-born Orange County native Richard Nixon became the 37th President of the United States. He established a \"Western White House\" in San Clemente, in South Orange County, known as La Casa Pacifica, and visited throughout his presidency.[43]\n\nIn the late 1970s, Vietnamese and Latino immigrants began to populate central Orange County.[44]\n\nIn the 1980s, Orange County had become the second most populous county in California as the population topped two million for the first time.\n\nIn the 1990s, red foxes became common in Orange County as a non-native mesopredator, with increasing urban development pushing out coyote and mountain lion populations to the county's shrinking natural areas.[45][46]\n\nIn 1994, an investment fund meltdown led to the criminal prosecution of treasurer Robert Citron. The county lost at least $1.5 billion through high-risk investments in bonds. The loss was blamed on derivatives by some media reports.[47] On December 6, 1994, the County of Orange declared Chapter 9 bankruptcy,[47] from which it emerged on June 12, 1996.[48] The Orange County bankruptcy was at the time the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.[47]\n\nLand use conflicts arose between established areas in the north and less developed areas in the south. These conflicts were over issues such as construction of new toll roads and the repurposing of a decommissioned air base. El Toro Marine Corps Air Station was designated by a voter measure in 1994 to be developed into an international airport to complement the existing John Wayne Airport. But subsequent voter initiatives and court actions caused the airport plan to be permanently shelved. It has developed into the Orange County Great Park and housing.[49]\n\n21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 21st century, the social landscape of Orange County has continued to change. The opioid epidemic saw a rise in Orange County, with unintentional overdoses becoming the third highest contributor of deaths by 2014. As in other areas, the deaths disproportionately occurred in the homeless population. However, deaths were widespread among affluent and poorer areas in Orange County, with the highest at-risk group being Caucasian males between the ages of 45–55. A 2018 study found that supply reduction was not sufficient to preventing deaths.[50]\n\nIn 2008, a report issued by the Orange County Superior Court found that the county was experiencing a pet \"overpopulation problem,\" with the growing number of pets leading to an increase in euthanasias at the Orange County Animal Shelter to 13,000 for the year alone.[51]\n\nFollowing the 2016 presidential election, Santa Ana become a sanctuary city for the protection of those immigrants who worked around the legally established process of becoming a legal resident in Orange and other California counties. This created an intense debate in Orange County surrounding politics toward unlawful immigration, with many cities opposing pro-immigration policies.[52]\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Orange County disproportionately affected lower income and Latino residents.[53]\n\nImplementation of renewable energy and climate change awareness in Orange County increased, with the city of Irvine pledging to be a zero-carbon economy by 2030 and Buena Park, Huntington Beach, and Fullerton pledging to move to 100% clean energy.[54] Residential solar panel installation has rapidly increased, even among middle-income families, as a result of the state's residential solar program which began in 2006.\n\nIn the 2010s, campaigns to conserve remaining natural areas gained awareness.[55][56] By the early 2020s, some success was found, with the conservation of 24 acres in the West Coyote Hills of a total 510 acres and the Genga/Banning Ranch project moving forward, conserving some 385 acres, which was part of the Tongva village area of Genga.[55][56][57] In 2021, the commemorative 1.5 acre Putuidem village opened after years of delays and campaigning by the Acjachemen.[58]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 948 sq mi (2,460 km2), of which 791 sq mi (2,050 km2) is land and 157 sq mi (410 km2) (16.6%) is water.[59] It is the smallest county by area in Southern California, being just over 40% the size of the region's next smallest county, Ventura. The average annual temperature is about 68 °F (20 °C).\n\nOrange County is bordered on the southwest by the Pacific Ocean, on the north by Los Angeles County, on the northeast by San Bernardino County, on the east by Riverside County, and on the southeast by San Diego County.\n\nThe northwestern part of the county lies on the coastal plain of the Los Angeles Basin, while the southeastern end rises into the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains. Most of Orange County's population reside in one of two shallow coastal valleys that lie in the basin, the Santa Ana Valley and the Saddleback Valley. The Santa Ana Mountains lie within the eastern boundaries of the county and of the Cleveland National Forest. The high point is Santiago Peak (5,689 ft (1,734 m)[60]), about 20 mi (32 km) east of Santa Ana. Santiago Peak and nearby Modjeska Peak, just 200 ft (60 m) shorter, form a ridge known as Saddleback, visible from almost everywhere in the county. The Peralta Hills extend westward from the Santa Ana Mountains through the communities of Anaheim Hills, Orange, and ending in Olive. The Loma Ridge is another prominent feature, running parallel to the Santa Ana Mountains through the central part of the county, separated from the taller mountains to the east by Santiago Canyon.\n\nThe Santa Ana River is the county's principal watercourse, flowing through the middle of the county from northeast to southwest. Its major tributary to the south and east is Santiago Creek. Other watercourses within the county include Aliso Creek, San Juan Creek, and Horsethief Creek. In the North, the San Gabriel River also briefly crosses into Orange County and exits into the Pacific on the Los Angeles-Orange County line between the cities of Long Beach and Seal Beach. Laguna Beach is home to the county's only natural lakes, Laguna Lakes, which are formed by water rising up against an underground fault.\n\nRegions of Orange County\n\n[edit]\n\nOrange County is sometimes divided into northern and southern regions. There are significant political, demographic, economic and cultural distinctions between North and South Orange County.[61] A popular dividing line between the two regions is the Costa Mesa Freeway.\n\nNorthern Orange County, including Anaheim, Fullerton, Garden Grove and Santa Ana, was the first part of the county to be developed and is culturally closer to neighboring Los Angeles County. This region is more Hispanic (mostly Mexican) and Asian (predominantly Vietnamese and Korean),[62] more densely populated (Santa Ana is the one hundredth and one most densely-populated city in the United States with a population of over 300,000), younger, less wealthy and with higher unemployment. It has more renters and fewer homeowners and generally votes Democratic. There are notable exceptions to these general trends, such as strongly Republican Yorba Linda and affluent Anaheim Hills, North Tustin, and Villa Park.[61] Northern Orange County is predominantly flat, giving way to the Santa Ana Mountains in the Northeast.\n\nSouthern Orange County is wealthier, more residential, more Republican, predominantly non-Hispanic white, and more recently developed. Irvine, the largest city in the region, is an exception to some of these trends, being not only a major employment center, but also a major tech hub and education center with UCI. Furthermore, the city is an Asian plurality (both South and East Asian), and votes reliably Democratic in recent years. Southern Orange County almost always includes Irvine,[63] Newport Beach, and the cities to their southeast, including Lake Forest, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Beach, Mission Viejo, and San Clemente. Alternatively, Irvine and Newport Beach are sometimes seen as Central Orange County, acting as a transition zone between north and south; when this viewpoint is taken Tustin is also considered to be in Central Orange County. Costa Mesa is sometimes included in South County,[64] although it is located predominantly to the west of the Costa Mesa Freeway and is part of the even street grid network of northern Orange County.[65] Irvine is located in a valley defined by the Santa Ana Mountains and the San Joaquin Hills, while much of Southern Orange County is very hilly.\n\nAnother region of Orange County is the Orange Coast, which includes the six cities bordering the Pacific Ocean. These are, from northwest to southeast: Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point and San Clemente, although Seal Beach is sometimes viewed as an extension of neighboring Long Beach in Los Angeles County.\n\nCommercial districts and edge cities\n\n[edit]\n\nOlder cities in North Orange County like Santa Ana, Anaheim, Orange and Fullerton have traditional downtowns dating to the late 19th century, with Downtown Santa Ana being the home of the county, state and federal institutions. However, far more commercial activity is concentrated in clusters of newer commercial development located further south in the county's edge cities. The three largest edge cities, from north to south, are:\n\nAnaheim–Santa Ana, running along Interstate 5 between Disneyland and Downtown Santa Ana,\n\nThe South Coast Metro, located along Interstate 405 and including South Coast Plaza, John Wayne Airport and the Irvine Business Complex; and\n\nIrvine Spectrum in eastern Irvine, at the interchange where I-5 and I-405 meet.\n\nAnaheim—Santa Ana edge city\n\n[edit]\n\nA contiguous strip of commercial development (an edge city) stretches from Disneyland through to MainPlace Mall along the I-5 Santa Ana Freeway,[66][67][68][69][70] straddling the city limits of Anaheim, Garden Grove, Orange, and Santa Ana, and in fact stretching between the original downtowns of those four cities.\n\nEntertainment and cultural facilities include Disneyland Resort, Angel Stadium, Christ Cathedral (formerly Crystal Cathedral), City National Grove of Anaheim – a live concert venue, Discovery Cube Orange County, the Honda Center – home to the Anaheim Ducks of the NHL (National Hockey League), and the Anaheim Convention Center. Health care facilities include CHOC (Children's Hospital of Orange County), Kaiser Permanente Health Pavilion (Anaheim), St. Joseph Hospital (Orange), and the UCI Medical Center.\n\nRetail complexes include Anaheim GardenWalk, Anaheim Marketplace (claiming to be the largest indoor swap meet in Orange County with more than 200 vendors), MainPlace Mall, Orange Town & Country, and The Outlets at Orange, originally a mall named \"The City\" which was the centerpiece of a planned, 1970s mixed-use development by the same name. There is commercial strip-style development including big box retailers along West Chapman Avenue in Orange, along Harbor Boulevard in Garden Grove, and around Harbor Boulevard and Chapman Avenue in Anaheim.\n\nMajor hotels line Harbor Boulevard from Disneyland south to Garden Grove. The Orange County Transit Authority studied the corridor as the possible route for a streetcar, a proposal that was dropped in 2018 due to opposition from Anaheim and other city governments.[71]\n\nIn addition to suburban-style apartment complexes, Anaheim's Platinum Triangle is undergoing transformation from a low-density commercial and industrial zone into a more urban environment with high-density housing, commercial office towers, and retail space. Anaheim envisions it as a \"downtown for Orange County\".[72] The 820 acres (330 ha) area undergoing this large-scale redevelopment includes the city's two major sports venues, the Honda Center and Angel Stadium of Anaheim.[73]\n\nNational protected areas\n\n[edit]\n\nCleveland National Forest (part)\n\nSeal Beach National Wildlife Refuge\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 189013,589—190019,69644.9%191034,43674.8%192061,37578.2%1930118,67493.4%1940130,76010.2%1950216,22465.4%1960703,925225.6%19701,420,386101.8%19801,932,70936.1%19902,410,556[75]24.7%20002,846,289[75]18.1%20103,010,232[76]5.8%20203,186,989[77]5.9%2023 (est.)3,135,755[78]−1.6%\n\n2020\n\n[edit]\n\nOrange County, California – Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

Anaheim is the main tourist hub, with the Disneyland Resort's Disneyland being the second most visited theme park in the world. Also, Knott's Berry Farm gets about 7 million visitors annually and is located in the city of Buena Park. The Anaheim Convention Center holds many major conventions throughout the year. Resorts within the Beach Cities receive visitors throughout the year due to their close proximity to the beach, biking paths, mountain hiking trails, golf courses, shopping and dining.\n\nFood culture\n\n[edit]\n\nAs recently as the 1990s, award-winning restaurants in Orange County consisted mostly of national chain restaurants with traditional American or Tex-Mex comfort food.[citation needed] In the late 1990s, Tim and Liza Goodell with chef Florent Marneau, and David Wilhelm, established culinary restaurant groups featuring nouvelle cuisine, gourmet burgers and more. The Orange County Register states that the \"tipping point\" came in 2007 when Marneaus founded Marché Moderne (since moved to Crystal Cove), and Top Chef chef Amar Santana opened a branch of Charlie Palmer (closed 2015),[112] both at South Coast Plaza. Santana followed opening restaurants Broadway in Laguna Beach and Vaca in Costa Mesa. Other Top Chef chefs followed with their own restaurants including Brian Huskey (Tackle Box), Shirley Chung (Twenty Eight), Jamie Gwen of Cutthroat Kitchen, and from The Great Food Truck Race, Jason Quinn (Playground), who also opened three stands at the 4th Street Market[113] food hall in Downtown Santa Ana in 2016.[114]\n\nFood halls with gourmet vendors include the 42,000 sq ft (3,900 m2) Anaheim Packing District, the 4th Street Market in Downtown Santa Ana, Lot 579 in Huntington Beach, Trade Food Hall in Irvine,[115] OC Mix in Costa Mesa, and The Source OC in Buena Park.[116]\n\nIn 2019, the Michelin Guide awarded stars for the first time to Orange County restaurants, awarding Hana Re and Taco Maria one star each.[117] In 2021, Knife Pleat in Costa Mesa was awarded one Michelin star as well.[118]\n\nArts and culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area's warm Mediterranean climate and 42 mi (68 km) of year-round beaches attract millions of tourists annually. Huntington Beach is a hot spot for sunbathing and surfing; nicknamed \"Surf City, U.S.A.\", it is home to many surfing competitions. \"The Wedge\", at the tip of The Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach, is one of the most famous body surfing spots in the world. Southern California surf culture is prominent in Orange County's beach cities. Another one of these beach cities being Laguna Beach, just south of Newport Beach. A few popular beaches include A Thousand Steps on 9th Street, Main Street Beach, and The Montage.\n\nOther tourist destinations include the theme parks Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim and Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park. Due to the 2022 reopening of Wild Rivers in Irvine, the county is home to three water parks along with Soak City in Buena Park and Great Wolf Lodge in Anaheim.[119] The Anaheim Convention Center is the largest such facility on the West Coast. The Old Towne, Orange Historic District in the City of Orange (the traffic circle at the middle of Chapman Avenue at Glassell Street) still maintains its 1950s image, and appeared in the movie That Thing You Do!.\n\nLittle Saigon is another tourist destination, home to the largest concentration of Vietnamese people outside Vietnam. There are also sizable Taiwanese, Filipino, Chinese, and Korean communities, particularly in western Orange County. This is evident in several Asian-influenced shopping centers in Asian American hubs like Irvine. Popular food festival 626 Night Market has a location at OC Fair & Event Center in Costa Mesa and is a popular attraction for Asian and fusion food, as well as an Art Walk and live entertainment.[120]\n\nHistorical points of interest include Mission San Juan Capistrano, the renowned destination of migrating swallows.

The team won the World Series under manager Mike Scioscia in 2002. In 2005, new owner Arte Moreno wanted to change the name to \"Los Angeles Angels\" in order to better tap into the Los Angeles media market, the second largest in the country. However, the standing agreement with the city of Anaheim demanded that they have \"Anaheim\" in the name, so they became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. This name change was hotly disputed by the city of Anaheim, but the change stood, which prompted a lawsuit by the city of Anaheim against Arte Moreno, won by the latter. Prior to the 2016 Moreno and the club officially dropped the Anaheim moniker now simply going by the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe county's National Hockey League team, the Anaheim Ducks, won the 2007 Stanley Cup beating the Ottawa Senators.

Except for the Board of Supervisors, each of these elected officers are elected by the voters of the entire county and oversee their own County departments.[136]\n\nAs of January 2023 , the six countywide elected officers are:[136][137]\n\nAssessor: Claude Parrish, Republican (since January 5, 2015)\n\nAuditor-Controller: Andrew Hamilton, CPA, Republican (since January 2, 2023)\n\nClerk-Recorder: Hugh Nguyen, Republican (since April 3, 2013)\n\nDistrict Attorney-Public Administrator: Todd Spitzer, Republican (since January 7, 2019)\n\nSheriff-Coroner: Don Barnes, Republican (since January 7, 2019)\n\nTreasurer-Tax Collector: Shari Freidenrich, CPA, Republican (since January 3, 2011)\n\nA seventh countywide elected officer, the County Superintendent of Schools (jointly with an independently elected County Board of Education) oversees the independent Orange County Department of Education.[138]\n\nBoard of Supervisors\n\n[edit]\n\nEach of the five members of the Board of Supervisors is elected from a regional district, and together, the board oversees the activities of the county's agencies and departments and sets policy on development, public improvements, and county services. At the beginning of each calendar year, the Supervisors select a chair and Vice Chair amongst themselves. The chair presides over board meetings, and the Vice Chair presides when the chair is not present. The Board appoints the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors, the County Counsel, the Performance Audit Director, and the Director of the Office of Independent Review. The Board also appoints the County Executive Officer to act as the chief administrative officer of the county and the manager of all agencies and departments not under the sole jurisdiction of an elected county official nor the sole jurisdiction of one of the four aforementioned officers appointed by the Board.[139]\n\nAs of January 2023 , the members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors are:[136][137][139]\n\nDistrict 1: Andrew Do, Republican (since February 3, 2015)\n\nDistrict 2: Vicente Sarmiento, Democrat (since January 2, 2023)\n\nDistrict 3: Donald P. Wagner, Republican (since March 27, 2019)\n\nDistrict 4: Doug Chaffee, Democrat (since January 7, 2019)\n\nDistrict 5: Katrina Foley, Democrat (since March 23, 2021)\n\nDepartment of Education\n\n[edit]\n\nThe County Department of Education is wholly separate from the County government and is jointly overseen by the elected County Superintendent of Schools and the five-member Orange County Board of Education, whose trustees are popularly elected from five separate trustee areas.[138]\n\nAs of January 2023 , the six elected officials overseeing the Orange County Department of Education are:[137][140][141]\n\nTrustee Area 1: Jorge Valdes, Republican\n\nTrustee Area 2: Mari Barke, Republican\n\nTrustee Area 3: Ken Williams, Republican\n\nTrustee Area 4: Tim Shaw, Republican\n\nTrustee Area 5: Lisa Sparks, Republican\n\nSuperintendent of Schools: Stefan Bean, Republican\n\nPension scandal\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 12, 2010, it was revealed that former Sheriff Mike Carona received over $215,000 in pension checks in 2009, despite his felony conviction.[142] A 2005 state law denied a public pension to public officials convicted of wrongdoing in office, however, that law only applied to benefits accrued after December 2005. Carona became eligible for his pension at age 50, and is also entitled, by law, to medical and dental benefits.[143][144] It was noted that the county's retirement system faces a massive shortfall totaling $3.7 billion unfunded liabilities, and Carona was one of approximately 400 retired Orange County public servants who received more than $100,000 in benefits in 2009.[145] Also on the list of those receiving extra-large pension checks is former treasurer-tax collector Robert Citron, whose investments, which were made while consulting psychics and astrologers, led Orange County into bankruptcy in 1994.[146]\n\nCitron, a Democrat, funneled billions of public dollars into questionable investments, and at first the returns were high and cities, schools and special districts borrowed millions to join in the investments. But the strategy backfired, and Citron's investment pool lost $1.64 billion. Nearly $200 million had to be slashed from the county budget and more than 1,000 jobs were cut. The county was forced to borrow $1 billion.[147]\n\nThe California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility filed a lawsuit against the pension system to get the list. The agency had claimed that pensioner privacy would be compromised by the release. A judge approved the release and the documents were released late June 2010. The release of the documents has reopened debate on the pension plan for retired public safety workers approved in 2001 when Carona was sheriff.[148]\n\nCalled \"3 percent at 50,\" it lets deputies retire at age 50 with 3 percent of their highest year's pay for every year of service. Before it was approved and applied retroactively, employees received 2 percent.[149] \"It was right after Sept. 11,\" said Orange County Supervisor John Moorlach. \"All of a sudden, public safety people became elevated to god status. The Board of Supervisors were tripping over themselves to make the motion.\" He called it \"one of the biggest shifts of money from the private sector to the public sector.\" Moorlach, who was not on the board when the plan was approved, led the fight to repeal the benefit. A lawsuit, which said the benefit should go before voters, was rejected in Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2009 and is now under appeal.[148] Carona opposed the lawsuit when it was filed, likening its filing to a \"nuclear bomb\" for deputies.[citation needed]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring most of the 20th century and up until 2016, Orange County was known for its political conservatism and for being a bastion for the Republican Party, with a 2005 academic study listing three Orange County cities as among America's 25 most conservative.[151] However, the county's changing demographics have coincided with a shift in political alignments, making it far more competitive in recent years. In 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first Democrat since 1936 to carry Orange County in a presidential election and in the 2018 midterm elections the Democratic Party gained control of every Congressional seat in the county.[152][153][154][155] Although Democrats controlled all congressional districts in Orange County at the time, Republicans maintained a lead in voter registration numbers (although it shrunk to less than a percentage point as of February 10, 2019,[156] as compared with over 10% on February 10, 2013).[157] The number of registered Democrats surpassed the number of registered Republicans in the county in August 2019. As the number of Democrats increased, the number of voters not aligned with a political party increased to comprise 27.4% of the county's voters in 2019.[158] Republicans held a majority on the county Board of Supervisors until 2022, when Democrats established a 3–2 control of the body. Seven out of the 12 state legislators from Orange County are also Republicans.\n\nPolitical history\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom the mid-20th century until the 2010s, Orange County was known as a Republican stronghold and consistently sent Republican representatives to the state and federal legislatures—so strongly so, that Ronald Reagan described it as the place that \"all the good Republicans go to die.\"[152] Republican majorities in Orange County helped deliver California's electoral votes to Republican nominees Richard Nixon in 1960, 1968, and 1972; Gerald Ford in 1976; Reagan in 1980 and 1984; and George H. W. Bush in 1988. It was one of five counties in the state that voted for Barry Goldwater in 1964.\n\nIn 1936, Orange County gave Franklin D. Roosevelt a majority of its presidential vote. The Republican nominee won Orange County by double digits in the next seventeen presidential elections. Orange County's Republican registration reached its apex in 1991, 55.6% of registered voters.[159] But with the 2008 election it began trending Democratic until Hillary Clinton won the county with an eight-point majority in 2016.[160][161] In 2020, Joe Biden further improved slightly on Clinton's 2016 margin of victory.[162][163] In 2023, the Republican party's registration was 33%, while the Democratic party's registration was 37.5%.[159]\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Orange County, California[164] Year Republican Democratic Third party(ies) No. % No. % No. % 2020 676,498 44.44% 814,009 53.48% 31,606 2.08% 2016 507,148 42.35% 609,961 50.94% 80,412 6.71% 2012 582,332 51.87% 512,440 45.65% 27,892 2.48% 2008 579,064 50.19% 549,558 47.63% 25,065 2.17% 2004 641,832 59.68% 419,239 38.98% 14,328 1.33% 2000 541,299 55.75% 391,819 40.36% 37,787 3.89% 1996 446,717 51.67% 327,485 37.88% 90,374 10.45% 1992 426,613 43.87% 306,930 31.56% 239,006 24.58% 1988 586,230 67.75% 269,013 31.09% 10,064 1.16% 1984 635,013 74.70% 206,272 24.27% 8,792 1.03% 1980 529,797 67.90% 176,704 22.65% 73,711 9.45% 1976 408,632 62.16% 232,246 35.33% 16,555 2.52% 1972 448,291 68.27% 176,847 26.93% 31,515 4.80% 1968 314,905 63.14% 148,869 29.85% 34,933 7.00% 1964 224,196 55.89% 176,539 44.01% 430 0.11% 1960 174,891 60.81% 112,007 38.95% 701 0.24% 1956 113,510 66.82% 54,895 32.31% 1,474 0.87% 1952 80,994 70.29% 33,397 28.98% 844 0.73% 1948 48,587 60.88% 29,018 36.36% 2,209 2.77% 1944 38,394 56.92% 28,649 42.47% 407 0.60% 1940 36,070 55.49% 28,236 43.44% 691 1.06% 1936 23,494 43.31% 29,836 55.00% 921 1.70% 1932 22,623 45.91% 23,835 48.37% 2,818 5.72% 1928 30,572 79.35% 7,611 19.75% 344 0.89% 1924 19,913 67.35% 2,565 8.68% 7,088 23.97% 1920 12,797 71.52% 3,502 19.57% 1,594 8.91% 1916 10,609 56.59% 6,474 34.54% 1,663 8.87% 1912 123 1.08% 4,406 38.58% 6,892 60.34% 1908 3,244 53.74% 1,911 31.65% 882 14.61% 1904 2,665 59.54% 1,034 23.10% 777 17.36% 1900 2,155 51.24% 1,777 42.25% 274 6.51% 1896 1,932 51.06% 1,712 45.24% 140 3.70% 1892 1,152 39.74% 1,000 34.49% 747 25.77%\n\nThe Republican margin began to narrow in the 1990s and 2000s as the state trended Democratic until the mid- to late-2010s when it voted for the Democratic Party in 2016 and in 2018, when the Democratic party won every United States House District anchored in the county, including four that had previously been held by Republicans.[166] This prompted media outlets to declare Orange County's Republican leanings \"dead\", with the Los Angeles Times running an op-ed titled, \"An obituary to old Orange County, dead at age 129.\"[152][153][154][155][167] While Republicans were able to recapture two of the seven U.S. House seats in Orange County in 2020, Democrats continued to hold the other five, Biden won the county by a slightly greater margin than Clinton had, and Democrats received a majority of the votes in each of the seven congressional districts.[163] Republicans still carry more weight at the local level, and in 2020 for the State Assembly elections, they won 50.2% of the vote and four out of seven seats of the county.[168] In the 2022 midterm elections, no congressional districts flipped, though Republicans performed strongly in Orange County, with every statewide GOP candidate carrying it.\n\nFor the 118th United States Congress in the United States House of Representatives, Orange County is split between six congressional districts:[169]\n\nCalifornia's 38th congressional district, represented by Democrat Linda Sánchez,\n\nCalifornia's 40th congressional district, represented by Republican Young Kim,\n\nCalifornia's 45th congressional district, represented by Republican Michelle Steel,\n\nCalifornia's 46th congressional district, represented by Democrat Lou Correa,\n\nCalifornia's 47th congressional district, represented by Democrat Katie Porter, and\n\nCalifornia's 49th congressional district, represented by Democrat Mike Levin.\n\nThe 40th, 45th, 46th, and 47th districts are all centered in Orange County. The 38th has its population center in Los Angeles County, while the 49th is primarily San Diego County-based. 132, 154, 188 In the California State Senate, Orange County is split into 7 districts:[169]\n\nthe 29th Senate District, represented by Democrat Josh Newman,\n\nthe 30th Senate District, represented by Democrat Bob Archuleta,\n\nthe 32nd Senate District, represented by Republican Kelly Seyarto,\n\nthe 34th Senate District, represented by Democrat Tom Umberg,\n\nthe 36th Senate District, represented by Republican Janet Nguyen,\n\nthe 37th Senate District, represented by Democrat Dave Min, and\n\nthe 38th Senate District, represented by Democrat Catherine Blakespear.\n\nIn the California State Assembly, Orange County is split into 9 districts:[169]\n\nthe 59th Assembly District, represented by Republican Phillip Chen,\n\nthe 64th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Blanca Pacheco,\n\nthe 67th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Sharon Quirk-Silva,\n\nthe 68th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Avelino Valencia,\n\nthe 70th Assembly District, represented by Republican Tri Ta,\n\nthe 71st Assembly District, represented by Republican Kate Sanchez,\n\nthe 72nd Assembly District, represented by Republican Diane Dixon,\n\nthe 73rd Assembly District, represented by Democrat Cottie Petrie-Norris, and\n\nthe 74th Assembly District, represented by Republican Laurie Davies.\n\nAccording to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Orange County has 1,591,543 registered voters. Of these, 34% (541,711) are registered Republicans, and 33.3% (529,651) are registered Democrats. An additional 28.5% (453,343) declined to state a political party.[156]\n\nOrange County has produced notable Republicans, such as President Richard Nixon (born in Yorba Linda and lived in Fullerton and San Clemente), U.S. Senator John F. Seymour (previously mayor of Anaheim), and U.S. Senator Thomas Kuchel (of Anaheim). Former Congressman Christopher Cox (of Newport Beach), a White House counsel for President Reagan, is also a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Orange County was also home to former Republican Congressman John G. Schmitz, a presidential candidate in 1972 from the ultra-conservative American Independent Party, John Birch Society member, and the father of Mary Kay Letourneau. In 1996, Curt Pringle (later mayor of Anaheim) became the first Republican Speaker of the California State Assembly in decades.\n\nWhile the growth of the county's Hispanic and Asian populations in recent decades has significantly influenced Orange County's culture, its conservative reputation has remained largely intact. Partisan voter registration patterns of Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic minorities in the county have tended to reflect the surrounding demographics, with resultant Republican majorities in all but the central portion of the county. When Loretta Sanchez, a Blue Dog Democrat, defeated veteran Republican Bob Dornan in 1996, she was continuing a trend of Democratic representation of that district that had been interrupted by Dornan's 1984 upset of former Congressman Jerry Patterson. Until 1992, Sanchez herself was a moderate Republican, and she is viewed as somewhat more moderate than other Democrats from Southern California.\n\nIn 2004, George W. Bush captured 60% of the county's vote, up from 56% in 2000 despite a higher Democratic popular vote statewide. Although Barbara Boxer won statewide in the simultaneously held senate election and fared better in Orange County than she did in 1998, Republican Bill Jones defeated her in the county, 51% to 43%. While the 39% that John Kerry received is higher than the percentage Bill Clinton won in 1992 or 1996, the percentage of the vote George W. Bush received in 2004 is the highest any presidential candidate has received since 1988, showing a still-dominant GOP presence in the county. In 2006, Senator Dianne Feinstein won 45% of the vote in the county, the best showing of a Democrat in a Senate race in over four decades, but Orange was nevertheless the only Coastal California county to vote for her Republican opponent, Dick Mountjoy.\n\nThe county is featured prominently in Lisa McGirr's book Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right. She argues that its conservative political orientation in the 20th century owed much to its settlement by farmers from the Great Plains, who reacted strongly to communist sympathies, the civil rights movement, and the turmoil of the 1960s in nearby Los Angeles — across the \"Orange Curtain\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Orange County was one of California's leading Republican voting blocs and a subculture of residents with \"Middle American\" values that emphasized capitalist religious morality[clarification needed] in contrast to West coast liberalism.\n\nOrange County has many Republican voters from culturally conservative Asian-American, Middle Eastern and Latino immigrant groups. The large Vietnamese-American communities in Garden Grove and Westminster are predominantly Republican; Vietnamese Americans registered Republicans outnumber those registered as Democrats, 55% to 22% as of 2007, while as of 2017 that figure is 42% to 36%. Republican Assemblyman Van Tran was the first Vietnamese-American elected to a state legislature and joined with Texan Hubert Vo as the highest-ranking elected Vietnamese-American in the United States until the 2008 election of Joseph Cao in Louisiana's 2nd congressional district. In the 2007 special election for the vacant county supervisor seat following Democrat Lou Correa's election to the state senate, two Vietnamese-American Republican candidates topped the list of 10 candidates, separated from each other by only seven votes, making the Orange County Board of Supervisors entirely Republican; Correa is first of only two Democrats to have served on the Board since 1987 and only the fifth since 1963.\n\nEven with the Democratic sweep of Orange County's congressional seats in 2018, as well as a steady trend of Democratic gains in voter registration, the county remains very Republican downballot. Generally, larger cities–those with a population over 100,000, such as Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Irvine – feature a registration advantage for Democrats, while the other municipalities still have a Republican voter registration advantage. This is especially true in Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, and Villa Park, the three cities where the Republican advantage is largest. As of February 10, 2019, the only exceptions to the former are Huntington Beach and Orange, while exceptions to the latter include Buena Park, Laguna Beach and Stanton.[156]\n\nSimilarly, despite Orange county supporting Democratic candidates for president in 2016, and 2020, there are still several smaller municipalities in the county that have continued to vote Republican for president. In addition to the aforementioned Newport Beach, Yorba Linda, and Villa Park, the cities of Huntington Beach, Dana Point, San Juan Capistrano, and San Clemente also supported Republican nominee Donald Trump for president twice.[170]\n\nVoter registration (2020 census)\n\n[edit]\n\nPopulation and registered voters Total population[171] 3,186,989 Registered voters[150][note 1] 1,811,669 56.85% total Democratic[150] 677,915 37.4% Republican[150] 603,479 33.3% Democratic–Republican spread +74,436 +4.1% American Independent[150] 61,539 3.4% Green[150] 5,990 0.3% Libertarian[150] 21,244 1.2% Peace and Freedom[150] 7,479 0.4% Miscellaneous[150] 6,855 0.4% No party preference[150] 427,168 23.6%\n\nCities by population and voter registration (2020 census)\n\n[edit]\n\nCities by population and voter registration City Population[171] Registered voters[150][note 1] Democratic[150] Republican[150] D–R spread[150] Other[150] No party preference[150] Aliso Viejo 52,176 32,135 36.9% 32.5% +4.4% 6.1% 24.4% Anaheim 346,824 168,104 44.3% 27.0% +17.3% 5.4% 23.2% Brea 47,325 29,364 34.3% 37.4% −2.9% 5.3% 23.1% Buena Park 84,034 43,670 42.7% 27.3% +15.4% 5.3% 24.8% Costa Mesa 111,918 61,574 37.4% 31.9% +5.5% 7.0% 23.6% Cypress 50,151 30,701 37.1% 33.3% +3.8% 5.3% 24.2% Dana Point 33,107 24,114 30.6% 41.1% −10.5% 7.0% 21.3% Fountain Valley 57,047 37,582 32.5% 38.7% −6.2% 5.3% 23.6% Fullerton 143,617 77,691 40.6% 30.3% +10.3% 5.5% 23.6% Garden Grove 171,949 88,852 38.3% 31.3% +7.0% 5.3% 25.0% Huntington Beach 198,711 133,245 31.4% 40.1% −8.7% 6.6% 22.0% Irvine 307,670 152,646 41.2% 24.7% +16.5% 4.6% 29.6% La Habra 63,097 33,306 42.3% 30.1% +12.2% 5.8% 21.8% La Palma 15,581 9,654 39.7% 31.0% +8.7% 4.2% 25.0% Laguna Beach 23,032 18,109 43.1% 28.4% +14.7% 6.5% 22.3% Laguna Hills 31,374 19,992 34.6% 36.0% −1.4% 5.8% 23.5% Laguna Niguel 64,355 45,080 33.6% 37.4% −3.8% 6.4% 22.6% Laguna Woods 17,644 15,174 40.5% 34.8% +5.7% 4.5% 20.2% Lake Forest 85,858 53,037 34.9% 35.5% −0.6% 5.9% 23.7% Los Alamitos 11,780 7,283 36.3% 34.6% +1.7% 6.8% 22.2% Mission Viejo 93,653 65,727 33.0% 38.6% −5.6% 6.1% 22.3% Newport Beach 85,239 60,767 25.8% 46.7% −20.9% 5.8% 21.7% Orange 139,911 78,156 36.7% 35.1% +1.6% 5.9% 22.3% Placentia 51,824 30,820 36.0% 36.1% −0.1% 5.5% 22.5% Rancho Santa Margarita 47,949 31,423 31.0% 40.2% −9.2% 6.0% 22.8% San Clemente 64,293 44,705 28.1% 43.8% −15.7% 6.7% 21.3% San Juan Capistrano 35,196 22,391 32.5% 39.5% −7.0% 6.4% 21.5% Santa Ana 310,227 127,205 52.8% 18.1% +34.7% 5.2% 23.9% Seal Beach 25,242 19,201 36.4% 39.9% −3.5% 5.2% 18.6% Stanton 37,962 17,632 44.6% 26.0% +18.6% 5.3% 24.1% Tustin 80,276 41,439 41.4% 27.3% +14.1% 5.6% 25.9% Villa Park 5,843 4,647 22.6% 52.3% −29.7% 5.4% 19.7% Westminster 90,911 51,929 33.5% 35.1% −1.6% 5.7% 25.6% Yorba Linda 68,336 48,005 25.9% 47.8% −21.9% 5.1% 21.2%\n\nFormer congressional districts\n\n[edit]\n\nFormer congressional districts by year Year Congressional district(s) 1885–1893 6 1893–1903[172][173] 7 1903–1913[172][174] 8 1913–1933 11 1933–1943[172][175] 19 1943–1953[172][176] 22 1953–1963[172][177] 28 1963–1973[172][178] 34, 35 1973–1983 38, 39, 40 1983–1993 38, 39, 40 1993–2003 40, 46, 47, 48 2003–2013[172][179] 40, 42, 44, 46, 47, 48\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nOrange County is the home of many colleges and universities, including:\n\nSome institutions not based in Orange County operate satellite campuses, including the University of Southern California, National University, Pepperdine University, and Springfield College.\n\nThe Orange County Department of Education oversees 28 school districts.\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nOrange County is served by media in Los Angeles, including its TV and radio stations. Two television stations—KOCE-TV, the main PBS member station in the Southland and KDOC-TV, a Tri-State Christian Television (TCT) owned-and-operated station—are located in Orange County.\n\nThere are a few radio stations that are actually located in Orange County. KYLA 92.7 FM has a Christian format. KSBR 88.5 FM airs a jazz music format branded as \"Jazz-FM\" along with news programming. KUCI 88.9 FM is a free form college radio station that broadcasts from UC Irvine. KWIZ 96.7 FM, located in Santa Ana, airs a regional Mexican music format branded as \"La Rockola 96.7\". KWVE-FM 107.9 is owned by the Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa. KWVE-FM is also the primary Emergency Alert System station for the county. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim also own and operate a sports-only radio station from Orange, KLAA. KX 93.5 FM[180] broadcasts out of Laguna Beach and features an eclectic mix of mostly alternative rock.\n\nCounty-wide politics and government coverage is primarily provided by the Orange County Register and Voice of OC. OC Weekly was an alternative weekly publication, and Excélsior is a Spanish-language newspaper. A few communities are served by the Los Angeles Times' publication of the Daily Pilot. Orange Coast was established in 1974 and is the oldest continuously published lifestyle magazine in the region. OC Music Magazine is also based out of Orange County, serving local musicians and artists.\n\nThe Orange County Plain Dealer (January 1898 to May 8, 1925), was a mostly Anaheim-based newspaper, and successor to The Independent, bought by James E. Valjean, a Republican and edited by him, a former editor of the Portsmouth Blade (Ohio).[181][182]\n\nOther newspapers were: Anaheim Daily Herald, Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim Bulletin.[183]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nTransit in Orange County is offered primarily by the Orange County Transportation Authority. OCTA manages the county's bus network and funds the construction and maintenance of local streets, highways, and freeways; regulates taxicab services; maintains express toll lanes through the median of California State Route 91; and works with Southern California's Metrolink to provide commuter rail service along three lines: the Orange County Line, the 91/Perris Valley Line, and the Inland Empire–Orange County Line, along with owning the land on which the Surf Line rests upon from the county line just north of Trestles Bridge until the wye adjacent to Fullerton Station.\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nGround transportation in Orange County relies heavily on three major interstate highways: the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5), the San Diego Freeway (I-405 and I-5 south of Irvine), and the San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605), which briefly passes through northwestern Orange County. The other freeways in the county are state highways, and include the Riverside and Artesia Freeway (SR 91) and the Garden Grove Freeway (SR 22) running east–west, and the Orange Freeway (SR 57), the Costa Mesa Freeway (SR 55), the Laguna Freeway (SR 133), the San Joaquin Transportation Corridor (SR 73), the Eastern Transportation Corridor (SR 261, SR 133, SR 241), and the Foothill Transportation Corridor (SR 241) running north–south. Minor stub freeways include the Richard M. Nixon Freeway (SR 90), also known as Imperial Highway, and the southern terminus of Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1). There are no U.S. Highways in Orange County, though two existed in the county until the mid-1960s: 91 and 101. US 91 went through what is now the state route of the same number, and US 101 was replaced by Interstate 5. SR 1 was once a bypass of US 101 (Route 101A).\n\nBus\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Orange County Transportation Authority\n\nThe bus network comprises 6,542 stops on 77 lines, running along most major streets, and accounts for 210,000 boardings a day. The fleet of 817 buses is gradually being replaced by CNG (Compressed natural gas)-powered vehicles, which already represent over 40% of the total fleet. Service is operated by OCTA employees and First Transit under contract. OCTA operates one bus rapid transit service, Bravo, on Harbor Boulevard. In addition, OCTA offers paratransit service for the disabled (OC ACCESS), also operated by MV.\n\nRail\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 1992, Metrolink has operated three commuter rail lines through Orange County, and has also maintained Rail-to-Rail service with parallel Amtrak service. On a typical weekday, over 40 trains run along the Orange County Line, the 91/Perris Valley Line and the Inland Empire–Orange County Line. Along with Metrolink riders on parallel Amtrak lines, these lines generate approximately 15,000 boardings per weekday. Metrolink also began offering weekend service on the Orange County Line and the Inland Empire-Orange County line in the summer of 2006. As ridership has steadily increased in the region, new stations have opened at Anaheim Canyon, Buena Park, Tustin, and Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo. Plans for a future station in Placentia are underway and is expected to be completed by 2020.\n\nSince 1938, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad and later Amtrak, has operated the Pacific Surfliner regional passenger train route (previously named the San Diegan until 2000)[184] through Orange County. The route includes stops at eight stations in Orange County including, in northbound order, San Clemente Pier (selected trips), San Juan Capistrano, Laguna Niguel/Mission Viejo (formerly), Irvine Transportation Center, Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center, Orange Transportation Center (formerly), Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center (ARTIC), and Fullerton Transportation Center.\n\nOC Streetcar, formerly known as the Santa Ana/Garden Grove Fixed Guideway Project, is a streetcar line connecting Downtown Santa Ana to the Depot at Santa Ana which is currently under construction and expected to open in 2023.[185] OCTA has also proposed connecting the two systems via Harbor Boulevard and the West Santa Ana Branch corridor.[186][187] Plans for a streetcar for Harbor Boulevard in Fullerton, Anaheim, and Garden Grove — the Anaheim Rapid Connection — were shelved in 2018.\n\nSea\n\n[edit]\n\nA car and passenger ferry service, the Balboa Island Ferry, comprising three ferries running every five minutes, operates within Newport Harbor between Balboa Peninsula and Balboa Island in Newport Beach. The Catalina Flyer connects the Balboa Peninsula to Avalon with daily round-trip passage through about nine months of the year. The Catalina Express connects Dana Point to Avalon (with departures from two greater Long Beach ports also connecting to Two Harbors).\n\nAir\n\n[edit]\n\nOrange County's only major airport is John Wayne Airport; its abbreviation (SNA) refers to Santa Ana, the closest large town in the early 20th century. The airport is located in unincorporated territory surrounded by Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, and Irvine. On destination monitors with flights to SNA, the airport is usually described as \"Orange County, CA\" or \"Santa Ana/Orange County\". In 2014, its Thomas F. Riley Terminal handled over 9 million passengers annually and as of 2019, seven airline brands provide scheduled service.\n\nCommunities\n\n[edit]\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\n[edit]\n\nThese communities are outside city limits in unincorporated county territory.\n\nPlanned communities\n\n[edit]\n\nOrange County has a history of large planned communities. Nearly 30 percent of the county was created as master planned communities,[citation needed] the most notable being the City of Irvine, Coto de Caza, Anaheim Hills, Tustin Ranch, Tustin Legacy, Ladera Ranch, Talega, Rancho Santa Margarita, and Mission Viejo. Irvine is often referred to as a model master-planned city because its original seven villages (College Park, The Colony, The Ranch, Culverdale, The Racket Club, University Park, and Turtle Rock) were laid out by the Irvine Company of the mid-1960s before it was bought by a group of investors including Donald Bren.\n\nIn culture\n\n[edit]\n\nOrange County has been the setting for numerous written works and motion pictures, as well as a popular location for shooting motion pictures.\n\nThe city of San Juan Capistrano is where writer Johnston McCulley set the first novella about Zorro, The Curse of Capistrano. It was published in 1919 and later renamed The Mark of Zorro. Science fiction novels set in Orange County include A Scanner Darkly (1977) by Philip K. Dick and the Three Californias trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson (1984–1990). Many novels by suspense thriller writer Dean Koontz are set in Orange County; Koontz is a resident of Newport Beach.\n\nOrange County was featured by Huell Howser in Road Trip Episode 109.[188]\n\nPopular television series set in Orange County include the Fox drama The O.C. (2003–2007), the Fox sitcom Arrested Development (2003–2006), and the Bravo reality show The Real Housewives of Orange County (2006–present). The three programs share a common focus on the extravagant lifestyles of the county's upper class.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nGreater Los Angeles portal\n\nList of museums in Orange County, California\n\nList of people from Orange County, California\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Orange County, California\n\nOrange County (film)\n\nOrange County Fair (California)\n\nOrange County School of the Arts\n\nSantiago Library System\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nRobin Rockey, 100 Things to Do in Orange County Before You Die.
