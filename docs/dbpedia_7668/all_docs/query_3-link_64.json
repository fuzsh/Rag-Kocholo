        "text": "IRVINE, CA (WVUE) - We’re only two days away for the Saints visiting Arizona to take on the Cardinals. The big question going into this game, will we see Derek Carr? Right now, we don’t know.\n\n“We’ll talk about it tonight as a staff and make a decision on what we want to do with all of our guys in terms of whether they’re going to play or not play. I haven’t had any communication with the players at all in terms of what we’re going to do. So until I have an opportunity to do that, I won’t discuss any of that publicly,” said head coach Dennis Allen.\n\nSo Allen hasn’t made a final decision yet but Carr is making it quite clear, he wants to be on the field Saturday night.\n\n“Yeah, I think I would like to. I think just getting out there and just hearing Klint’s voice in the helmet calling plays, getting the substitutions in and out. I think that’d just be good for us as an offense. As the preseason goes it’s very basic stuff, very easy and simple. You don’t wanna show anything, all that kind of stuff,” said quarterback Derek Carr.\n\n“But even with that said, you’re not game planning the team. I haven’t seen any film. So you go out there and play. But I think just operation and just getting in and out of the huddle with each other, getting used to it, getting back in that swing. I think hopefully you knock some of that game day rust off before you really get to the regular season.”\n\nCarr played in only one preseason game last season. That was the opener against the Chiefs. The Saints scored a touchdown on his only drive.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story? Click Here to report it. Please include the headline.\n\nSubscribe to the Fox 8 YouTube channel."
