        "text": "The November election is less than 100 days away, and CalMatters will have the lowdown on each of the ballot’s 10 propositions. Today we’re highlighting Proposition 32, which seeks to raise California’s minimum wage, as well as Prop. 35, which proposes to ensure that a tax on health care plans is spent on low-income patients.\n\nWhile workers in health care and fast food won major legislative victories last year to secure higher hourly wages, Prop. 32 would raise the current statewide minimum wage of $16 to $18 by January.\n\nLabor groups say the measure will help workers with the rising cost of living, though $18 still might not be enough to eke out a comfortable living in the state. But business groups argue that businesses also struggle with inflation and increasing labor costs will force them to lay off staff, cut hours or raise prices.\n\nLearn more about Prop. 32 from CalMatters Capitol reporter Jeanne Kuang in our one-minute video. And take a quiz from CalMatters data reporter Erica Yee to see how you might vote.\n\nProp. 35 would require tax revenue that the state receives from managed health care insurance plans be spent on care for Medi-Cal patients. Because Medi-Cal, the state-run health insurance program for low-income residents, is funded with both state and federal money, California can use that tax money to request matching federal dollars and help reduce the budget gap. With the state facing a $56 billion shortfall over the next two years, that’s exactly what Gov. Gavin Newsom did this year.\n\nProp. 35 would instead lock in that money — which is expected to be $35 billion over the next four years — for Medi-Cal and its services, including ​​primary and specialty care, emergency services, family planning, prescription drugs and more.\n\nHealth providers, who would receive higher payments, support the measure, as well as both the California Democratic and Republican parties. No formal opposition is registered, but Newsom has raised concerns that restricting how the state can spend that tax revenue “hamstrings” future lawmakers and their ability to balance the budget.\n\nTo know more, watch a video explainer on Prop. 35 from CalMatters health reporter Kristen Hwang. And take the quiz from Erica.\n\nIn other election news: Republican U.S. Senate candidate Steve Garvey has agreed to participate in two statewide televised debates with Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, one hosted by ABC 7 Los Angeles and the League of Women Voters California, and the other by the Nexstar Media Group.\n\nSchiff hasn’t confirmed, but his campaign is “in communication with both debate organizers,” said spokesperson Marisol Samayoa.\n\nGarvey, in a statement: “I look forward to a civil and substantive discussion about our state’s future and how we can work together to solve the challenges we face.”\n\nGarvey and Schiff debated three times before the March 5 primary, along with Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee and Katie Porter. The former L.A. Dodgers star trails Schiff significantly in the polls, though he has closed the gap in fundraising.\n\nNovember election: It’s not too early to get informed.

And check out our Voter Guide, including a FAQ on how to vote.\n\nFrom CalMatters higher education reporter Mikhail Zinshteyn:\n\nMichael Drake, president of the University of California, announced Wednesday he intends to step down next summer, closing out his job as the system’s top executive after steering it through a pandemic, two graduate student strikes and a system convulsing over free speech and dueling charges of intolerance.\n\nAlong the way, the UC has continued to notch key wins during his tenure that began in August of 2020: steady four-year graduation rates despite the pandemic, significantly more state funding for its education mission and more California students receiving a world-class education through expanded UC enrollment — also bankrolled by state dollars.\n\nStill, some of the UC’s marquee commitments are so far falling short, such as closing the gap in graduation rates among students from different racial and ethnic groups by the end of the decade. UC’s intermediate goal is to have 69% of Black, Latino and Native American freshmen graduate in four years by 2025-26. The latest data, for 2022-23, has that figure at 63%.\n\nDrake, 74, in a written statement: “It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve as president of the University of California these past several years, and I am immensely proud of what the UC community has accomplished. At every turn, I have sought to listen to those I served, to uphold our shared UC values, and to do all I could to leave this institution in better shape than it was before.”\n\nHis office wouldn’t explain why he chose now to step down.\n\nAs a system synonymous with the free speech movement of the 1960s, the UC was under intense national scrutiny for how it addressed campus protests this past academic year over the Gaza war. Despite calls for greater campus comity and $7 million to battle intolerance last November, student anguish only intensified. It culminated into overnight encampments, some that were violently attacked by outsiders, shut down by police officers who made hundreds of arrests, or both.\n\nFrom those protests emerged the second graduate worker strike during Drake’s tenure, one that UC fought aggressively to squelch. The system ultimately prevailed in ending the strike through a judge order in June.\n\nFrom CalMatters Capitol reporter Jeanne Kuang:\n\nFour months after California raised fast food workers’ minimum wage to $20 an hour, a group of ice cream parlor owners still haven’t gotten state labor officials to explicitly say whether or not they have to comply.\n\nThe rollout of the new wage in April was met with confusion from those on the edges of the food-and-beverage world, CalMatters reported earlier this year. While it was clear that McDonald’s and other chains were covered, less obvious were numerous varieties of confectionary shops, boba vendors and ice cream parlors.\n\nOn Wednesday, Gabriela Campbell, the owner of a Handel’s franchised ice cream shop in San Diego County, urged the state’s new fast food regulatory council to say she’s exempt. She was joined by several other franchised ice cream shop owners, many of whom said they mostly employ high schoolers or college students who work a few hours a week.\n\nCampbell told CalMatters she has not raised her wages to $20 because the state’s guidance says the law applies to “limited service restaurants,” while her store is a “snack and non-alcoholic beverages” establishment that she said is prohibited by the franchisor from selling food. And she said lawmakers’ staff told her ice cream shops aren’t part of the “legislative intent.”\n\nBut ice cream shop owners want to make sure they’re legally in the clear; guidance from the state’s Department of Industrial Relations states selling ice cream doesn’t automatically exempt a business owner from being counted as fast food.\n\nCampbell: “We are not asking for an exemption. We’re not asking for a new law to be written … I’m hoping to get clarity.”\n\nShe was disappointed when, later in the meeting, the state appeared to punt.\n\nDepartment attorney Miles Locker: “Absent new legislation or new court decisions, I don’t foresee any changes to the FAQs.”\n\nLawmakers earlier this year passed exemptions to the $20 wage for fast food restaurants in hotels, airports and other locations. Campbell said legislation may be her next move."
