That way we’ll know to take extra steps to notify you about PSPS outages in your area that could result in your home losing power.\n\nComplete the self-certification form below so we can place a note on your account. If a PSPS outage occurs, we’ll know to send a representative to your home to make contact if we are unable to reach you by email, voice call, or text.\n\nYour completed self-certification form is only good for 90 days. It does not automatically renew but you can resubmit the form to renew it."
