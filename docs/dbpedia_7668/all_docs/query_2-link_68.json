        "text": "Catherine and John soon added six more children to their burgeoning household having 12 children total, with 10 surviving to adulthood. The living children’s names were: Frank Peter, John William, Mary Elizabeth (Altmiller), Joseph Anton, Henry Joseph, William Henry, George William, Charles Edward, Elizabeth Mary (Brock), and Clarence.\n\nWhen the Maag family moved to California from Nebraska in 1891, they first settled in a small house that pre-existed on their property near Fairhaven Memorial Park. Around 1895, John and Catherine Maag started building a larger home and the twelve-room Maag Farmhouse was custom built from 1895 to 1899 to accommodate their family. It was expected that all eight boys would help John on the ranch when they were not in school and in return, when a son turned twenty-one years of age they were given a team of horses and a parcel of land so each of the Maag sons could establish his own ranch. For this purpose, several of them took business courses at local colleges and they became orange and avocado farmers. In a true sign of the times the family lived in, when the girls came of age they received a piano.\n\nCatherine Maag was a strong woman just like her husband. While John was developing the ranch, she was busy taking care of the children and creating a warm, friendly home. Catherine worked constantly to keep the house clean and organized. Until the family bought a washing machine, clothes were washed outside in a washtub and hung outside on the clotheslines to dry. With such a large family Catherine did a lot of sewing and had a tiny room that had her sewing machine set up, ready to go. Catherine loved to cook and had a large wood burning stove. She especially liked baking pies, cakes, and cookies. When Catherine became a grandmother, she established a tradition of sending cookies home with the grandchildren after their Sunday visits.\n\nThe Maag daughters helped their mother around the house. This was especially true of eldest daughter Mary. Mary also helped Catherine with the raising of the younger children and Mary never received a formal education. However, second daughter Elizabeth, who was twelve years younger than Mary, was sent to private school. Both girls learned to play the piano. Mary Maag stayed in her parents’ home for thirty-eight years until her marriage. After her wedding she moved with her husband to the town of Taft in Kern County, California, but she still visited her parents regularly, about every two weeks.\n\nSoon after the Maags became established, an overabundance of oranges created such a strong buyer’s market that the local farmers could not earn enough to make a profit. As a successful citrus and walnut farmer in early Orange County with a keen business sense, John Maag saw a need to collaborate with his fellow orange growers to establish fair prices for agricultural products. To accomplish this, he organized a co-op with the orange growers between Santa Ana and Redlands and formed the Santiago Orange Growers Association. Under Maag’s President and Directorship of the association for over 20 years this foundation is what eventually became the well-known Sunkist Growers. He was also instrumental in the creation of several other produce growing associations: Central Lemon Growers; the Olive Heights Orange Growers; Richland Walnut Growers Association; and the Orange County Fumigating Association. Memberships in these associations led to his involvement in the development of Sunkist Growers.\n\nOver time John bought several more ranches, which made him a very prosperous man. In 1917, John Maag owned one of the few Sampson tractors in Orange County. He purchased the tractor for $1,400 which is about $29,000 in today’s money. He applied these experiences towards helping organize the Citizens Commercial and Savings Bank of Santa Ana, now known as the California National Bank, cementing his already impressive involvement as an Orange County pioneer creating and raising OC’s economic stability.\n\nThe Maags were devoutly religious. They were parishioners of St. Joseph’s Church in Santa Ana where John participated in the Altar Society, an organization that collected funds for the church and maintained the altar vessels for Mass. He was also a member of the Holy Family Catholic Church, Santa Ana Order of the Elks, and a member of the Knights of Columbus.\n\nAlthough devout, the Maags were a buoyant and active family. They liked visiting the beach at Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. They enjoyed hiking and camping in local places such as Mount Lowe, the San Gabriel Mountains or Matilija Hot Springs in Ventura County. They visited their relatives in Santa Paula, Ventura County and traveled farther north to San Francisco. In 1915, the family even took a return trip to Columbus, Nebraska to visit relatives.\n\nJohn and Catherine Maag enjoyed a happy and loving marriage, celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church. The celebration included a musical program of organ selections and vocal solos from family and friends. After attendance at the church, 250 guests were invited to the Maag home for a celebratory dinner.\n\nJohn was remembered by a Maag granddaughter, Lucina Maag Considine as a “German authoritarian, firm but fair” and by others as a staunch family man, remaining on his family ranch until his death on the property in 1931 at the age of 80. Catherine remained on the family ranch until her own death in 1955.\n\nFor firsthand accounts and remembrances of life on the Maag Farmhouse Ranch from some of the Maag grandchildren, view this 2001 HMOC Maag article (then Discovery Museum of OC).\n\nMAAG FAMILY HISTORY (sources: HMOC Board notes, 2009; County Courier Newsletter, 2005; Discovery Museum of Orange County Teletype, 2001; HMOC Archives)"
