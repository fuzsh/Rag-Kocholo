        "text": "Longtime Real Housewives of Orange County frenemies Vicki Gunvalson and Alexis Bellino came face to face while attending a prix fixe dinner put on by Gina Kirschenheiter during Season 18, Episode 5 (which aired August 8).\n\nSuffice to say, it didn't take long for the drama to start. In fact, as soon as Vicki walked through the door, Alexis greeted her by referencing a line that the OG of the OC had stated back in 2011. More specifically, Alexis said, \"Look who's in my world now.\"\n\n\"Her world?\" Vicki replied. \"Sit down, bitch.\"\n\n\"What is wrong with this woman?\" Vicki continued in a confessional interview. \"She's gone Looney Tunes. She's gone cuckoo birds. Girl's nuts.\"\n\nLuckily, the two weren't seated next to each other. However, later on in the dinner, Vicki gave her take on the group's drama as a whole. \"I think it's disgusting, because a friend's a friend,\" she said. \"This whole fighting thing.\"\n\nHow do Alexis Bellino and Vicki Gunvalson know each other?\n\nAlexis and Vicki met in the most traditional way: Both were full-time cast members during RHOC Season 5.\n\nAlexis remained on the show through Season 8, while Vicki kept her orange through Season 13. As fans very well know, both women have made appearances on the show since, popping up time and time again since their exits.\n\nVicki Gunvalson and Alexis Bellino's relationship through the years\n\nVicki and Alexis have had plenty of ups and downs over the years. During Season 5, they got into a fight after Vicki was rude at a dinner party and Alexis asked her to take accountability for her actions. Later, they became good friends — a relationship that ended after Alexis and Tamra got into a (since-resolved) tiff, and Vicki took Tamra's side.\n\nIn June 2012, Alexis told RadarOnline that she was \"definitely close\" with her fellow 'Wife, but the relationship had \"been slow\" to build.\n\n\"[Vicki] went away with me last weekend, we’re going out tonight, we’re taking baby steps and we’re both very cautious,\" she said. \"We’re not, ‘Oh, best friends! Let’s call each other and get on the phone right now. You’re my best friend. I’ll talk to you five times a day!’ It’s not like that. We’re very guarded and we were realistic in the fact that one of us could get hurt. I think both her and I are just trying to protect ourselves.\"\n\nSo, will we see these frenemies interact any further on RHOC Season 18? Tune into Bravo Thursdays at 9/8c to find out. Episodes stream the next day on Peacock.\n\nShop The Real Housewives of Orange County merch"
