        "text": "As the Friendship Express train made its final descent into Ponyville, Octavia Melody looked out the carriage window and sighed. It had been dark and rainy all afternoon, and the ground was very muddy. Octavia was not looking forward to walking all the way across town to get home. The train came to a stop, and the gray mare reluctantly got off with her cello case in tow. The cold, hard rain hit her mane instantly, weighing it down as she stepped off the station platform and onto the wet, muddy grass.\n\nThe walk home was every bit as uncomfortable as Octavia expected. Very few ponies were out and about, and it was easy to see why. The rain pounded down, soaking the straw roofs of houses, and the wind blew fiercely. That morning, Octavia had performed at a classical concert in Canterlot. It had been meant to take place in an outdoor garden, but was moved indoors due to the inclement weather. Octavia wished it had been rescheduled to a different day entirely. She had put in extra care to look her best, and now she was getting wet and dirty regardless.\n\nOctavia’s route home ran alongside the river. The heavy rain had caused the water to rise, and it looked dangerously close to flooding. Struggling to see what was in front of her, Octavia stepped on a spot that had absorbed too much water, and that part of the riverbank fell away completely. Octavia jumped back in alarm, and decided to give the river a wide berth for the rest of the journey.\n\nFurther upstream, the river was swelling even more. Realizing she was nearly home, Octavia let out a sigh of relief, only to catch sight of something splashing around in the river. Looking closely, she realized that it was a small animal, battling for its life against the rapid current. As much as she wanted to get out of the storm, Octavia couldn’t leave the animal to drown. Without hesitation, she ran down to the riverbank, her cello weighing heavily upon her back. She miraculously made it without slipping, then grabbed onto the animal and pulled it free of the water.\n\nWith the animal in her front hooves, Octavia was able to get a closer look at it. It was a brown mongoose, with little claws and ears, and a long furry tail. Octavia didn’t know much else about mongooses, but this one was pretty cute. “Come on, love,” she said to it. “Let’s get you to someplace dry.” She allowed the mongoose to climb onto her back, and continued on her way home.\n\nAfter what felt like quite a while, Octavia arrived back at the house she shared with her friend Vinyl Scratch. Though their musical tastes were complete opposites, and Vinyl never actually said a word, Octavia felt that her housemate always understood her. Vinyl was relaxing on the couch on her side of the main room when Octavia came in and set her cello against the wall. The mongoose climbed down from her back and shook itself dry. When Vinyl noticed Octavia’s little companion, she tilted her head and lowered her shades.\n\n“I found this little one fighting for its life in the river, and I just had to rescue it,” Octavia explained. “I hope you don’t mind.”\n\nVinyl gave a smile and a nod. She didn’t mind having extra company.\n\nOctavia figured that the mongoose could stay for a while, at least until the rainstorm passed. She then looked down and saw that her hooves and her belly were covered in wet, gooey mud. “Oh, bother…” she muttered. “I must take a shower.”\n\nOctavia hurried upstairs to the bathroom, but as she went up the steps, she noticed that the mongoose was following behind her. “I’m only going to the bath. I’m not leaving you!”\n\nNonetheless, the mongoose had made up its mind. When Octavia entered her bathroom, the mongoose ran in with her before she could close the door. “Well, I do value my alone time in the bath, but if you must accompany me, then be my guest.” Octavia climbed into the bathtub, closed the curtain, and turned on the shower. As the water began to wash away the mud and grass from her underside, she felt most relieved.\n\nOctavia was just starting to shampoo her mane when the mongoose hopped into the bathtub with her. “Oh my goodness!” she exclaimed. “I’m perfectly happy to have you as a guest, but can a mare not bathe in peace?” She tugged on the shower curtain to signal for the mongoose to get out, but it just got up on two legs and tilted its head. Octavia sighed. “Very well then. It’s a good thing you’re so cute.” She began rinsing the suds out of her mane. I never thought I’d be one to converse with animals, she thought to herself. Anyone would think I was copying Fluttershy. Still, I did save that mongoose’s life today. Can’t simply ignore it, can I?\n\nOctavia thoroughly washed her entire body as the mongoose watched intently. When she was finished, she turned off the shower and pulled open the curtain to grab her towel. She stepped out to dry herself off, and the mongoose tried to follow her, but struggled to climb over the wall of the wet tub. “Do you need some help?” Octavia asked. She reached out to allow the mongoose to grab onto her hoof, and gently lifted it over the edge of the tub. “Here you go, love.”\n\nThe mongoose smiled and gently rubbed itself against Octavia’s front legs. “Oh, you…” Octavia giggled. She was taking quite a liking to her new furry friend.\n\nOctavia dried off her body with her lavender towel, then used her air dryer to blow-dry her mane. Now nice and clean, she headed to her bedroom, with the mongoose following diligently behind her.\n\n“I’m going to take a nap after the day I’ve had. You may stay here if you wish, but Vinyl is downstairs as well.” Octavia crawled into her bed and laid down under the covers. The mongoose promptly climbed onto the bed with her. Octavia was soon asleep, but the mongoose stayed awake, watching its surroundings vigilantly.\n\nThe next day, the sun was shining once again. Octavia had agreed to meet up with her friend Lyra for lunch at the Ponyville Cafe. As she was about to leave, the mongoose stood by her side, just as it had done for the entire morning. “Yes, you may join me for lunch!” she chuckled. “Although to say you’ve become attached to me would be quite the understatement.”\n\nThe mongoose hopped up onto her back, and Octavia left the house. She trotted along the stone path and was soon in the town center. When she arrived at the Ponyville Cafe, she found Lyra Heartstrings waiting at one of the outdoor tables.\n\n“Hey, Octavia!” Lyra called with a grin.\n\n“Hello, Lyra!” Octavia replied as she sat down. The mongoose hopped off her back and onto another stool nearby. “It’s a lovely day, isn’t it? Much better than yesterday.”\n\n“Oh, tell me about it!” agreed Lyra. “Yesterday I just stayed inside and read the new Shadow Spade book.” She then noticed the mongoose sitting next to Octavia. “Who’s this little guy?”\n\nOctavia smiled. “Oh, the mongoose? I saved it from drowning in the river yesterday, on my way home from the concert. It’s been following me around ever since, even when I took a shower.”\n\n“Awww…” Lyra giggled. “Well, if I were you, I wouldn’t mind that. It’s so adorable!”\n\n“Yes, it is quite cute. Still, I’m curious to know why it’s become so attached to me.”\n\n“Well, you saved its life yesterday, so it probably just wants to be your friend!” Lyra turned to the mongoose. “Isn’t that right?”\n\nThe mongoose stood up on two legs and seemed to nod before sitting back down. “Yep, that’s it!” said Lyra. “You’ve got a new little buddy!”\n\nOctavia was happy about that, but she hoped that the mongoose’s following her around would eventually stop. She needed her alone time too, after all.\n\nJust then, Fluttershy trotted past, and Lyra waved to her. “Hi, Fluttershy!”\n\n“Hi, Lyra!” replied Fluttershy. She then spotted the mongoose, and her eyes went wide. “Ricky!” she exclaimed. “Oh, I’ve been looking all over for you!”\n\n“Ricky?” Octavia remarked. “Is that the mongoose’s name?”\n\n“Yes, it is!” said Fluttershy. “He lives in a burrow near my cottage, but he went out to hunt yesterday and didn’t come back. I was so worried about him! I’m glad to see he’s safe.”\n\n“Well, he’s been in good hooves with me,” said Octavia.\n\n“Oh?” Fluttershy asked. “How did you two meet?”\n\nBefore Octavia could reply, Ricky leaned into Fluttershy’s ear and began chattering quietly. “You fell in the river? And Octavia rescued you? Oh, of course! I’m sure you’ll be a wonderful guardian for her!”\n\n“What did he say?” asked Octavia.\n\n“Ricky says that since you saved him yesterday, he’ll be your personal guardian until he has the chance to save you,” Fluttershy explained. “Mongooses are very courageous creatures, and loyal to a fault.”\n\n“Ah, so that’s why he’s been following me!” remarked Octavia.\n\nFluttershy nodded. “That’s right! He just wants to make sure you’re safe.”\n\n“That’s good to know. But does that mean he’ll be accompanying me in the shower for the foreseeable future?”\n\nRicky chattered something to Fluttershy. “Only if it’s okay with you.”\n\n“I see,” said Octavia. “I’ll have to think about that.”\n\n“That’s okay,” said Fluttershy. “But I really should tell you about his diet. Mongooses are carnivores, so they normally eat insects and lizards. Ricky was hunting for lizards when he fell in the river yesterday. Do you have any of those near your house?”\n\n“Well, I’m not sure about lizards, but I’m sure Vinyl and I have plenty of insects in our vicinity.”\n\n“That’s good. I know he likes to follow you, but he also needs to eat, so be sure to let him go outside to hunt throughout the day.”\n\n“I will do that. Thank you, Fluttershy!”\n\n“Any time, Octavia,” Fluttershy said with a smile. “Anyway, I have to go now. I’m needed at Twilight’s castle. I’m sure you’ll take great care of Ricky.” With that, the yellow pegasus departed.\n\n“Looks like somepony’s got a new pet!” chuckled Lyra.\n\nOctavia nodded. “It seems so! I’m glad I know his name now, and what he eats. Trying to feed him pony food this morning was a bit of a struggle.”\n\n“Well, I don’t think you’d like being fed bugs or lizards either!” teased Lyra.\n\nSuddenly, Lyra and Octavia heard a rustling noise coming from the shrubs surrounding the cafe. They turned to see Ricky eating a dragonfly that had landed on one of the leaves.\n\n“Well, there you go!” said Octavia. “Quite the skilled little hunter he is.”\n\nA waiter soon arrived, and Octavia and Lyra ordered their food. They continued chatting over hay burgers and milkshakes, while Ricky feasted on whatever insects he could find.\n\nFor the next two weeks, Octavia kept the back door of her house open throughout the day, so Ricky could go outside and hunt for insects. Ricky spent much of his time in the backyard, but always came back inside after dusk. He spent each night on the rug in Octavia’s room, guarding her bed vigilantly until they were both asleep. Octavia liked having him around, but didn’t think he would ever be able to save her in the way that she saved him.\n\nSoon, it was time for Octavia to prepare for another concert performance. About a month earlier, she had received a special invitation to play her cello at that year’s Brushwood Light Music Concert. The village of Brushwood, located on the other side of the Everfree Forest, had long been famous as a fine arts haven. Octavia had visited it several times before, but this would be her first time playing music there. On the night before the concert, Octavia went to bed early so that she would be well-rested before her performance.\n\nThat night, another rainstorm passed through Ponyville. While Octavia and Ricky had no trouble sleeping through the rain, the storm’s effects were evident when Octavia opened her curtains the next morning. The grass was very wet, and many small branches were scattered on the ground. “Well, at least it won’t be raining during the concert this time,” Octavia remarked.\n\nAfter having a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast, Octavia put her cello in its case and slung it over her back. “I’m off to Brushwood for the day,” she said. “Would you like to come with me, Ricky?”\n\nRicky stood up on two legs and nodded. Vinyl waved goodbye to her housemate, and Octavia headed out the door with Ricky following close behind.\n\nLeaving Ponyville, the Friendship Express’s South Line curved around the Everfree Forest before crossing over Ghastly Gorge. The first stop on the other side was for Brushwood. This was normally a quick and easy ride, but when Octavia arrived at the Ponyville train station, she found the stationmaster standing alone on the platform next to a large red sign.\n\n“What’s the matter?” Octavia asked the stationmaster.\n\n“Last night’s storm brought down a big tree two miles south of here, and it’s blocking the tracks,” the stationmaster explained. “All trains from Canterlot have to terminate here today.” He pointed to the sign, which confirmed that no southbound trains could go past Ponyville.\n\n“Oh, bother!” groaned Octavia. “Is there any other way to reach Brushwood from here?”\n\n“There’s a path through the Everfree that will get you there,” said the stationmaster. “Though you’ll probably come across more fallen trees.”\n\n“Well, it’s worth a try. Thank you!”\n\nSoon after leaving the train station, Octavia and Ricky entered the Everfree Forest, which looked as foreboding as ever. Dark trees towered over them on either side, leaves dripping wet from the storm. Nonetheless, everything was quiet. Ricky climbed onto Octavia’s back to keep a lookout. “At least I have you for company,” said Octavia.\n\nA few miles further south, the main path split at a fork. A faded and mossy wooden sign stood in the center. Octavia tried to read the carved lettering. According to the sign, the path to the right led to Brushwood. “This way!” Octavia said to Ricky. “Not long now, I’m sure.”\n\nUnfortunately, this path did not turn out how Octavia had hoped. The forest soon gave way to a bog, full of mangroves and bubbling swamp water, with one narrow strip of land leading over it. Octavia carefully made her way, balancing both Ricky and her cello on her back. “Oh dear, I don’t like this place at all…” she whimpered. She was about halfway across when she heard a strange slithering noise. She began to walk faster, but stopped as Ricky let out a loud screech. A gigantic cobra emerged from the water, glaring down at Octavia and hissing loudly.\n\nOctavia screamed and tried to run away, but there was a limit to how fast she could run while carrying a cello on her back. The cobra slithered after her, its shadow looming larger and larger. Octavia then tripped over a mangrove root and was sent sprawling. She landed with her cello on top of her, pinning her down. As the cobra came up behind her, she was certain that she was a goner.\n\nBut Ricky had jumped off Octavia’s back as soon as she fell. He let out a shrill battle cry, and charged at the cobra as fast as his little paws would carry him. The cobra lunged and hissed in return, and just as Octavia realized what was happening, Ricky leaped through the air and sunk his teeth into the cobra’s throat. The cobra thrashed violently, trying to free itself, but Ricky had it pinned. With one final bite, Ricky brought the cobra to its death. He then let go of the hood, and the cobra’s dead body rolled into the swampy water and sank like a stone.\n\nOctavia was amazed by what she’d seen. “You… you saved my life!”\n\nRicky simply nodded, then walked over to Octavia and rubbed himself against her face. Octavia gave a warm smile, and put a gentle hoof on Ricky’s back to pet him. “I can’t thank you enough…”\n\nRicky smiled and tilted his head, as if to say it was just a knack. Octavia got back up, and she and Ricky set off once more. The rest of the journey went smoothly, and they arrived in Brushwood without a hitch.\n\n“Hello, Octavia!” said Beauty Brass, a mare who played the sousaphone and often performed alongside Octavia. “It’s good to see you again! I heard the train from Ponyville couldn’t run today.”\n\n“Yes, that is correct,” chuckled Octavia. “I had to walk through the Everfree Forest to get here, and I was nearly attacked by a giant cobra in the bog. But Ricky saved me by taking the cobra down himself!” She pointed to her mongoose friend, who was standing alongside her.\n\n“That little fellow saved you?” Beauty asked incredulously. “But the cobras in the bog are at least forty feet long! My cousin once had a near-miss with one.”\n\n“That they are,” replied Octavia, “but they’re still no match for a brave mongoose. He charged it and brought it down with his teeth!”\n\n“Well then, he’s quite the noble creature!” remarked Beauty. “He’s welcome to watch us perform any time.”\n\nRicky nodded and smiled. Octavia, meanwhile, was thinking back to what Fluttershy had said. Ricky had been able to save her life after all.\n\nIt was soon time for the light music concert to begin. Unlike the concert in Canterlot two weeks ago, this one was held outdoors as intended, and everypony had a wonderful time.\n\nWhen the event was over, Octavia headed down to the Brushwood train station. The big tree had been cleared away from the tracks, so the Friendship Express was able to resume normal services. Octavia and Ricky got on the next train together, and rode it back home to Ponyville.\n\nNear the river, Octavia ran into Fluttershy again. “Good evening, Fluttershy!” Octavia said with a smile. “You’ll never guess what happened to me and Ricky today!”\n\n“Oh, what happened?” asked Fluttershy.\n\n“Ricky saved my life!” replied Octavia, and she recounted that morning’s events.\n\n“Well done, Ricky!” exclaimed Fluttershy. “I’m so proud of you!”\n\nRicky chattered something to Fluttershy. “You do?” Fluttershy asked. “Okay then, if that’s what you’d like!”\n\nFluttershy turned back to Octavia. “Ricky says that even though he’s fulfilled his duty, he still wants to continue living with you. He promises that he’ll dig a new burrow for himself in your backyard.”\n\nOctavia beamed. “He is more than welcome to! And I am honored to have him as my pet.”\n\nRicky now lives in Octavia and Vinyl’s backyard, with his burrow below Octavia’s bedroom window. He guards the house from pests, devouring any insects that try to come in. If there are any snakes in Ponyville, they certainly won’t be going after Octavia ever again."
