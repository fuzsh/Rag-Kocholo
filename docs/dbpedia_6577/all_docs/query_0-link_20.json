        "text": "The Ghost of Frankenstein, released 13 March 1942, was the fourth film in Universal’s very popular Frankenstein’s Monster franchise. Though Son of Frankenstein (1939) was the last A-quality film in the series, and Universal had by this time moved away from serious horror films and towards mere monster movies, Ghost of Frankenstein is still quite good.\n\nEveryone expected Boris Karloff would once again play the Monster, but his schedule with the very popular play Arsenic and Old Lace precluded him from reprising his signature character. A day after the film was announced, Lon Chaney, Jr. was cast in the role, and producer George Waggner was ordered to use Karloff’s exact same makeup so as to retain continuity and not lose fans of the franchise.\n\nLon, Jr. missed a few days of filming when he had a severe allergic reaction to the makeup.\n\nThere’s trouble in the village of Frankenstein, as angry, disgruntled villagers insist all their current problems are caused by the curse of Frankenstein. The Mayor urges them to be rational, and reminds them the Monster perished in a sulphur pit and his master Ygor is probably dead as well, but mob justice prevails, and Dr. Frankenstein’s castle is destroyed.\n\nThe explosions reveal the Monster was preserved intact in hardened sulphur, which fills the also very much alive Ygor (Béla Lugosi) with delight. As they’re fleeing the besieged castle, the Monster is struck by lightning. Ygor decides they should go to Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein, the older son of Dr. Henry Frankenstein, in Visaria.\n\nTrouble begins in Visaria almost immediately, as villagers misinterpret the childlike Monster’s intentions towards a little girl, Cloestine, whom he’s trying to help. His appearance also terrifies them, and he lashes out the only way he knows how, by killing two people. Though the girl’s father is prevailed upon to not shoot him, and the Monster peacefully returns the girl after fetching her ball on a roof, cops and other people in the mob set upon him.\n\nThe Monster is taken to jail as a madman, and the town prosecutor alerts Ludwig (Cedric Hardwicke) to the Monster’s presence. Ludwig agrees to examine this strange, violent giant.\n\nNo sooner is Ludwig alone than Ygor steals in to see him, begging him to heal the Monster both body and brain. This is a most disagreeable proposition, but Ygor forces his hand by threatening to publicly reveal his true ancestry.\n\nThe Monster is chained up and questioned by a judge as the mob congregates, but he refuses to speak. Even Cloestine’s sweet, patient, innocent questions are met with silence.\n\nWhen Ludwig arrives, he denies recognition of his father’s creation in horror, and the Monster breaks his chains. Ygor flees with the Monster in the back of a wagon, hidden inside a crate.\n\nLudwig’s daughter Elsa (Evelyn Ankers) discovers her grandfather’s old journals and reads about the Monster’s creation (with scenes from the first film). She’s terrified by strange shadows outside the window, which she’s positive belong to the Monster, but Ludwig insists her mind was tricked by the storm.\n\nThe Monster and Ygor indeed have gained access to the Frankenstein residence, and the Monster kills one of Ludwig’s assistants. The Monster also grabs Elsa, but Ludwig manages to knock him out with sulphuric gas.\n\nLudwig is attempting to examine the unconscious Monster, belted down to a table in his lab, when the Monster starts sitting up and breaks one of the belts. Ludwig immediately tranquilizes him.\n\nLudwig’s begs his surviving assistant, Dr. Theodore Bohmer (Lionel Atwill), to help him with dismantling the Monster in exactly the way he was created, piece by piece, but Dr. Bohmer refuses and says that would be murder. Ludwig then reads his father’s old journals and is visited by Henry’s ghost, who tells him the Monster was created with a criminal brain. Henry implores his son to put another brain into the Monster, which will remove his evil inclination and transform him into a force for good.\n\nLudwig tells Ygor and Dr. Bohmer he’s going to use the brain of the killed assistant, Dr. Kettering. Ygor begs Ludwig to use his brain instead, so he can become one with the Monster. Ludwig refuses on account of Ygor’s evil nature.\n\nElsa thinks the operation is a very dangerous idea, but her father insists on going ahead with it as soon as possible.\n\nThe plot thickens when Ygor asks Dr. Bohmer to use his brain so he can become a superman who lives forever, freed of his disfigured body. If Dr. Bohmer obeys, he’ll get all the medical glory he’s been denied as Ludwig’s mere assistant.\n\nAnd meanwhile, the cops are hot on the Monster’s trail. Their search brings them to Ludwig’s house, which Ygor and the Monster have fled.\n\nWhat sorts of murderous mayhem might the Monster make this time? And if the operation goes through, just whose brain will be used?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nReleased 8 May 1942, The Corpse Vanishes was produced by Monogram Pictures (one of the best studios at Poverty Row). It was the fourth of nine films Béla Lugosi made for Monogram during the period in his career when he was bouncing back and forth between many different studios.\n\nIn another 1942 Lugosi film, Bowery at Midnight, a poster for The Corpse Vanishes briefly appears, featuring his name and image.\n\nYou might recognize dwarf character Toby (Angelo Rossitto) from Freaks.\n\nMystery Science Theater 3000 lampooned The Corpse Vanishes in 1989.\n\nPhyllis Hammerton faints at the altar on her wedding day, right after she says “I do.” When the priests asks Dr. Raybert if he should phone an ambulance, the doctor says he should phone an undertaker instead, because she’s dead. Her body mysteriously vanishes from the morgue, and Phyllis becomes the fourth society bride in recent days to suffer such a strange disappearance.\n\nThis news is so concerning, Alice Wentworth and her mother go to the district attorney to beg for protection at Alice’s upcoming wedding. After they leave, the DA begs an aggressive reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters), to not print any more stories about vanishing brides, since it’s creating too much panic.\n\nShortly before the wedding, a very unusual-looking orchid under a glass case is delivered to Alice’s room, along with a love note she and Mrs. Wentworth presume is from Dwight, the groom. Though Mrs. Wentworth is terrified about Alice becoming the fifth victim, Alice refuses to believe such a thing could happen to her.\n\nAnd like clockwork, Alice too faints dead away at the altar.\n\nPatricia is still hot on the trail of a sizzling news story, and suspects the strange orchid Alice wore might have something to do with all this business. Even more unusually, this orchid has a scent, a peculiar sweet odor.\n\nWhile Alice is en route to the morgue, cops accompanying the undertaker’s vehicle on motorcycles pull away to investigate a burning car with no driver or license plate. By the time they return to the undertaker’s van, Alice’s corpse has vanished.\n\nPatricia goes to her editor, Mr. Keenan (Kenneth Harlan), with her suspicions that the orchid has something to do with all these disappearances, since all the vanishing brides wore one. Mr. Keenan threatens to fire her unless she produces a whiz-bang story about this business and proves it’s not just a silly society story.\n\nAlice’s corpse is brought into the cellar lab of a mad scientist, Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi). In the corner, his wife (Elizabeth Russell) is hysterical with tears and fears about dying if he doesn’t hurry. Dr. Lorenz proceeds to extract some kind of fluid from Alice and inject it into his screaming wife.\n\nOnce injected, Countess Lorenz transforms into a young, beautiful woman, with a very calm demeanour.\n\nPatricia is directed to Dr. Lorenz in her quest to investigate the mysterious orchid, since he created that particular hybrid. When she arrives at the depot to get a taxi, the cabbie says he’s out of gas, and suggests she hitch a ride with a truck heading to Dr. Lorenz with a coffin.\n\nThis driver too refuses to take Patricia, since she hasn’t a prior invitation to see Dr. Lorenz. Undeterred, she jumps onto the back of the truck. Trouble rears its head when the driver eventually discovers her and bodily removes her, then drives away with her purse still on board.\n\nPatricia follows the truck on foot until she encounters another car driving to the Lorenz residence, and finally gets a ride. On the way, driver Dr. Foster (Tristram Coffin) highly praises Dr. Lorenz, but says his wife is rather peculiar, and that both of them are rather eccentric.\n\nDr. Lorenz cheerfully welcomes Patricia to his home, but Countess Lorenz is outraged to learn Patricia is a reporter. She slaps Patricia and stalks away in an angry fit.\n\nPatricia pretends she’s doing an article on orchids, and Dr. Lorenz says he’s too busy to grant an interview now. However, he’ll be glad to do it in the morning. He also insists Patricia and Dr. Foster stay overnight on account of a storm.\n\nPatricia wakes up in the middle of the night when a creepy intruder strokes her hair. He flees when she screams, and when she goes in search of Dr. Foster, she finds the Lorenzes asleep in coffins.\n\nDetermined to get to the bottom of things, Patricia sneaks into the cellar and discovers the corpses of several brides being felt up by creepy hunchback Angel (Frank Moran). She faints when she sees Angel unconscious after being strangled by Dr. Lorenz.\n\nIn the morning, Patricia confronts Dr. Lorenz about his mausoleum, and he insists she had a horrible dream. The orchid has also vanished from her purse, but another bundle of orchids has appeared on her bed in its place.\n\nPatricia says she has to return to the city, and asks to reschedule the interview.\n\nPatricia and Dr. Foster go to Mr. Keenan to report what they witnessed, and Dr. Foster suggests a theory that Dr. Lorenz is somehow using young brides to keep his wife looking so strangely young for her old age. Eventually, they hatch a plan to expose Dr. Lorenz with a phony wedding.\n\nWill their scheme be successful, or will Dr. Lorenz capture yet another victim?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nReleased 25 April 1941, Invisible Ghost was the first of Béla Lugosi’s nine films with Poverty Row studio Monogram Pictures. Despite Monogram’s lack of financial resources, however, they produced a lot of solid films, managed to lure a lot of stars (both current and former) from other studios, and launched a number of new stars. They also won an Academy for Best Short Subject (Two Reeler) in 1947, and were nominated for a number of other Academy Awards.\n\nLugosi went to work for them when his career was in the doldrums, a consequence of the restrictive Hays Code coupled with a British ban on horror films.\n\nCharles Kessler (Lugosi) seems for all intents and purposes a very nice, respectable man, except for one big flaw—he went half-mad after his wife left him for his best friend a few years ago. She and her lover are believed to have died in a terrible car accident, and now every year on the Kesslers’ wedding anniversary, Mr. Kessler pretends she’s alive. The butler Evans (Clarence Muse) sets the table for two, and Mr. Kessler talks to this invisible presence.\n\nMr. Kessler’s daughter Virginia (Polly Ann Young, older sister of Loretta Young) is aghast when her serious beau Ralph Dickson (John McGuire) visits on this very evening and witnesses the bizarre spectacle. In embarrassment, she draws him aside and explains what’s going on.\n\nRalph was also secretly seeing the Kesslers’ maid Cecile Mannix (Terry Walker), but broke it off with her because he fell in love with Virginia. Now Cecile won’t accept the fact that it’s over and that Ralph’s heart is no longer hers. After they quarrel that night, Ralph drives off and Cecile retreats to her room.\n\nWe then learn Mrs. Kessler (Betty Compson) is alive, albeit not very well, and living in the cellar, where the gardener (not her lover) takes care of her. She’s terrified to come home, believing her husband will kill her, and anybody else as well. However, she regularly prowls through the grounds at night to appear below Mr. Kessler’s window.\n\nAnd when he sees her, he goes into a trance and indeed kills someone.\n\nThat night, Mr. Kessler strangles Cecile with his overcoat (to avoid fingerprints). Evans discovers her corpse in the morning, and Ralph is accused of the crime. Though he heartily pleads his innocence, it seems an open and shut case of guilt due to the lovers’ quarrel Evans overheard. Ralph gets the death penalty.\n\nShortly afterwards, a dead ringer for Ralph visits and becomes a longterm houseguest—his twin brother Paul (also John McGuire). Paul is determined to get to the bottom of what really happened. While he believes Ralph was innocent on account of their being brothers, he also is highly suspicious of how several other servants in the household were murdered before that.\n\nThe next victim is the gardener, who’s also found by Evans. This time, Evans is accused of the crime, despite having no motive or suspicious behaviour. Mr. Kessler and Virginia also fully stand behind his innocence and good moral character.\n\nPaul is also still determined to get to the bottom of all these mysterious murders, and some unexpected twists and turns may just expose what’s really been going on.\n\nInvisible Ghost was very positively reviewed by The Los Angeles Times, which called it “head and shoulders above the average horror picture” and praised it for evoking a creepy mood more through psychological and psychopathic situations instead of directly showing the horror. They also loved Lugosi’s acting.\n\nAnother wonderful aspect of this film is the character of Evans. Clarence Muse always imbued his characters with such fully-realised humanity, dignity, and intelligence, whether they were servants or leading roles. Evans is a very important secondary character, and is never once cast as a stereotype or used for cheap laughs. This was quite refreshingly unusual for the era.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nReleased 20 January 1936, The Invisible Ray was the third of the eight films Boris Karloff and Béla Lugosi made together. Initially, their next teaming had been planned as Bluebeard, but the script wasn’t ready in time. The powers that be put Bluebeard on the back burner and instead found a different film.\n\nDirector Stuart Walker didn’t like John Colton’s script for The Invisible Ray, and asked for a three-day break to fix it. When Universal refused, Mr. Walker left, and was replaced by Lambert Hillyer.\n\nThe initial budget was $166,875, considered fairly lavish for a B-movie. The production went over by $68,000, as well as going over schedule (17 September–25 October 1935). According to Stuart, “The director who did the picture started nine or ten days after I was ordered to start and finished 25 or more days after I was ordered to finish.”\n\nDr. Janos Rukh, like many mad scientists in the tradition before him, is widely seen as a crank whose obsessive research and unusual theories are an embarrassment and ridiculous vanity project. However, he’s bound and determined to prove his work is on the level and that he’s on the verge of the next great scientific breakthrough.\n\nTowards that end, he convinces two such naysayers, Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi) and Sir Dr. Francis Stevens (Walter Kingsford), to come to his home for a demonstration of a fascinating new telescope. Francis also brings his wife, Lady Arabella Stevens (Beulah Bondi), and his nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton).\n\nPredictably, Dr. Rukh’s much-younger and very pretty wife of three years, Diana (Frances Drake), has an immediate and mutual attraction to Ronald. Diana’s father was Dr. Rukh’s assistant, and when he passed away, she dutifully married Dr. Rukh. However, she’s never felt romantic love for him.\n\nWhen everyone is seated, Dr. Rukh gives a marvellous demonstration of a new telescope, along with narration. The telescope not only gives a great planetarium show, it also projects images from millions of years ago. One of these images is a meteorite striking somewhere in Africa.\n\nDrs. Benet and Stevens are so impressed by this magical telescope, they abandon their former hardened skepticism and agree to accompany Dr. Rukh on an expedition to find the impact site and harvest the material in this ancient meteorite.\n\nThe African quest takes far longer than expected, and nothing has been found. Though the others are starting to have second thoughts and planning to return to England soon, Dr. Rukh insists on staying just a bit longer. He feels he’s on the verge of a breakthrough in discovering the impact site, and with it incredible scientific secrets.\n\nFind it he does, with the help of a bunch of natives. As per the unfortunate standards of most films of this era, they’re depicted as easily-spooked and having really cartoonish reactions to their fear.\n\nThough Dr. Rukh is delighted to discover not only the impact site but the actual meteorite itself, his excitement is short-lived. When the meteorite is exposed to daylight again, it explodes and sends out dangerous radiation which sickens him quite badly. Dr. Rukh now glows in the dark, and his touch is deadly.\n\nDr. Benet compassionately creates an antidote which Dr. Rukh must take at the same time every day. If he doesn’t inject himself religiously, he’ll go back to his fully radioactive state. However, the newly-discovered element Radium X may have permanently altered his brain, and eventual madness may descend. The antidote also isn’t a cure, just a means of keeping the worst effects under control.\n\nAfter Dr. Rukh returns to base camp, Dr. Benet tells him of the secret romance between Diana and Ronald. Knowing full well Diana never loved him, Dr. Rukh fakes his own death shortly after coming to Paris. He finds a man who very much resembles him, murders him, and makes him look like he died of radiation poisoning.\n\nDr. Benet returns to Europe with a piece of the meteorite and uses its powers for good. His procedure for curing blindness is embraced as a miracle. He also cures other ailments with a modified form of Radium X.\n\nThough Dr. Rukh also uses Radium X to cure his mother’s blindness, his altruism doesn’t last for long. He presently sets his mind firmly upon revenge, and takes up residence in a boardinghouse across the street from a church with six statues. Each figure represents to him one member of the African expedition, and thus the people he believes ruined his life by getting rich and famous off of his discovery and hard work.\n\nAnd thus begins a reign of terror from a mysterious invisible force.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nReleased 25 May 1945, The Body Snatcher was based on Robert Louis Stevenson’s 1884 short story of the same name. It was the first of three films Boris Karloff did with RKO Radio Pictures after leaving Universal, and the final film in which he co-starred with Béla Lugosi.\n\nThough Karloff continued doing horror pictures, he felt the Frankenstein’s Monster franchise had run out of steam, and didn’t want to be involved with it in any capacity any longer, even though he no longer played the Monster in these films. He lauded RKO producer Val Lewton as “the man who rescued him from the living dead and restored, so to speak, his soul.”\n\nIn 1831 Edinburgh, cabman John Gray (Karloff) drops Mrs. Marsh (Rita Corday) and her young daughter Georgina (Sharyn Moffett, now 84 years old) off at the home of the esteemed Dr. Wolfe “Toddy” MacFarlane (Henry Daniell). Little Georgina was paralysed after a carriage rolled on top of her, an accident which took the life of her father. She seemed to be recovering at first, but then her condition worsened.\n\nMrs. Marsh says all the other doctors recommended Dr. MacFarlane very highly, and feels he’s their final hope. The consultation doesn’t seem to be getting anywhere, since Georgina can’t even tell him where exactly it hurts, but everything changes when Dr. MacFarlane’s student Donald Fettes (Russell Wade) comes in.\n\nGeorgina immediately warms to him, and lets him pick her up and put her on a table in another room. Without even trying, Fettes gets all the preliminary information needed. He calls Dr. MacFarlane in to take a look at the bony tumour at the base of Georgina’s spine, and surgery is suggested.\n\nDr. MacFarlane bears no ill will towards the Marshes, but begs off performing surgery. He’s far too busy with his teaching duties, and isn’t sure if he’s still as good of a physician as he is a med school teacher. If he operated on all the desperate people who come to him, he’d have no time to teach.\n\nAfter the Marshes leave, Fettes announces he’s quitting med school because he hasn’t enough funds. Dr. MacFarlane, loath to lose one of his best students, offers him a paid position as a lab assistant for a very important research project.\n\nAt night, Gray arrives with a fresh corpse for Dr. MacFarlane’s anatomy class, and tells Fettes to unlock a desk where the money is kept. His fee for this service is £10. Fettes doesn’t think too much of it until he discovers just where this body came from.\n\nFettes is horrified to discover the body was the victim of grave robbery, and that the young man’s loyal little dog was murdered while standing watch over his lost master. He understands the importance of human vivisection for teaching med students, but doesn’t feel it’s right to obtain the bodies by robbing graves.\n\nMrs. Marsh returns to beg Fettes for Dr. MacFarlane to operate on Georgina. Initially Dr. MacFarlane agrees, but soon walks back to his fear of no longer being a good enough surgeon and better-suited to the classroom.\n\nGray and Fettes manage to convince Dr. MacFarlane to do the operation. Fettes appeals to his humanitarian side, while Gray reminds him there’s a dark secret in his past. It would be a shame if that secret were revealed.\n\nNot realizing what kind of trouble he’s about to wade into, Fettes asks Gray to get another body for anatomy class. He assumes Gray will dig up a grave, but instead is delivered the fresh corpse of someone who was alive and healthy just that night.\n\nWhen Fettes shares his suspicions with Dr. MacFarlane, he’s told he might be arrested as an accomplice to murder if he reports Gray to the cops.\n\nGeorgina’s operation appears to be a success, but she doesn’t think she can stand up and walk. Dr. MacFarlane did everything right, but Georgina insists it’s impossible. As someone who couldn’t walk for eleven months following my car accident, I know all too well that powerful mind-body connection.\n\nDr. MacFarlane goes to the local tavern to drink away his disappointment, and Gray once again taunts him about that dark secret from his past.\n\nThen Dr. MacFarlane’s servant Joseph (Lugosi) pays a visit to Gray and attempts to blackmail him, which sets in motion a thick and fast parade of horrors.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
