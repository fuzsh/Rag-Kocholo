        "text": "It’s time for a little rectifyin’. Longtime readers may recall my 2016 review of Pop Flix’s 2-disc, 8-movie Bela Lugosi DVD set. To this day, it’s still my favorite budget DVD release of Lugosi’s poverty row (and subsequently public domain) movies. Have there been more comprehensive collections released? Well, yeah. And yet, the concise all-killer, no-filler line-up of films and clean, attractive presentation of them in Pop Flix’s offering continues to overwhelmingly appeal to yours truly, over 6 years later. I even gifted a copy to my cousin last Christmas, such was and is my continuing fondness for the set.\n\nWhile my love of the collection hasn’t changed, my list of personal favorites contained within it has – somewhat. The Devil Bat and The Corpse Vanishes continue to reside in the upper echelon of Lugosi flicks in my mind, whereas The Ape Man, which I raved about back in ’16, has fallen in stature precipitously. And Bowery at Midnight, which was the big surprise of the set for me, frankly, that has grown to become what just may be my all-time favorite Bela movie, poverty row or otherwise.\n\nIf you go back and read that article, you’ll note that I was somewhat lukewarm on 1941’s Invisible Ghost. In fact, my conclusion back then was: “…this, for me, is one of the weaker entries, though that’s really only relatively speaking; this is still a good one, but it’s a bit overshadowed by some of the other flicks here, in my eyes.”\n\nYeah, that opinion has changed quite a bit in the intervening years as well. I didn’t intentionally set out to change my earlier viewpoint, but regular watches in the time since has resulted in Invisible Ghost steadily growing to ultimately become what is very likely a top 3’er in my Bela favorites (The Devil Bat and Bowery at Midnight being the other two).\n\nAs such, rather than going back and modifying the original review, which is something I really, really didn’t feel like, a full-fledged update seemed to be in order. But by what vehicle? Should I bust out the Pop Flix DVD and (re-)review just that movie? Nah, too easy. Or maybe the movie as presented by The Ghoul back in 2000? (I briefly mentioned that episode and the thought of reviewing it in that 2016 article, after all.) Nah, too much work. Do I try to snag a cheap copy of the appropriate entry in GoldStar Video’s Tales of Horror VHS series, which I like to babble about? Actually, I tried, but there were 0 copies available online that I could see.\n\nSo you know what that means? Yes indeed, it’s Grampa Al Lewis time once again!\n\nHey, it’s October, Halloween month, and as I write this, it’s cold and overcast and rainy out, so the setting is right. Plus, I’m pretty sure these Amvest/Grampa VHS articles get more continuing views than anything else I write about, so might as well!\n\nIt’s true: Invisible Ghost was released as part of Amvest Video’s 1988 “Grampa Presents” VHS series. I’ve written about these plenty (here’s the latest – from last October); they are, bar none, my favorite budget video releases, of yesterday or today. So if I’m going to revisit Invisible Ghost and give it its proper props, this is the correct way to go about it. I mean, maybe not from a non-obsolete technology or picture quality standpoint, but…\n\nGet them synapses fired up and you’ll realize this is the respective VHS cover right here. The artist’s rendition of one of the more-famous images from the film is perfectly respectable, and while I’m not a big fan of how the movie title itself was rendered (it looks hairy, like it would be better suited for a werewolf movie or sumpin’), the artwork is nice and colorful and it’s overseen by the “Grampa Presents” banner at the very top, which puts it above many, many other budget tapes from the era. Heck, it puts it above other tapes in the very same series!\n\nOddly, not every Grampa tape used the motif, but these tapes were supposed to have that banner, along with a “Grampa’s Ratings” feature on the back. I don’t really have anything much to say about the reverse of the sleeve, but Grampa did rank this one two bats and remarked “a deadly obsession” there, which doesn’t really tell anyone anything, but at least it’s present. (I have my doubts Al Lewis himself actually sat down to rate and write these – but I sure like to imagine he did.)\n\nI’ve written about these Grampa tapes so many times by now that there’s little I can say about them that wouldn’t be massively repeating myself. Follow the link I gave you before and go from there if you want to know more. Or hit the search button; that works too, I guess.\n\nPut shortly, movies in this series were hosted by Al Lewis, doing his Grandpa Munster shtick without being called Munster; here he’s simply “Grampa.” Accompanied by a green (blue?) screen, old horror movie clips, computer-animated special effects, neon squiggles, and an off-screen Igor that you may or may not hear, Lewis does his tried-and-true “I’m an old vampire” routine.\n\nThe intros and outros for these tapes were always the same, and despite the late-80s budget video trappings, they’re a lot of fun. The intro was more for setting up the premise and announcing the movie (which was supposed to be announced by the unseen Igor, though a good part of the time they didn’t even bother including it; such was the case here) while the outro focused mainly on the titles available in the series and how you could go about getting them. Same every time or not, these host segments add so much to these tapes; not only are they a unique touch in the world of budget home video from that time, but they recall the television horror hosts that were an endangered species even then. If you’re gonna watch a cheap VHS release of a public domain movie, there were (are) far, FAR worse ways to go about it.\n\nSo that’s the background to the main reason for this article: giving Invisible Ghost its deserved due. Things go better with Grampa, but our real focus today is the movie, so let’s get to that now.\n\nInvisible Ghost was released in 1941, the first of ultimately 9 movies Bela Lugosi did for poverty row outfit Monogram Pictures. From my understanding, it’s often considered the best of the bunch, and while I’m not sure I completely agree with that, it’s definitely a good’un. As The Ghoul used to occasionally say, “it’s a dandy!”\n\nOur plot: Lugosi plays one Charles Kessler, a man of considerable wealth and power (though unless I’ve just totally missed them over and over, specifics as to how/why are never given; dude’s mad rich, okay?). Some years prior to the start of the film, Kessler’s wife cheated on him with his best friend, they reconciled, but then apparently ran off with said friend anyway, something that left Kessler devastated. As the movie begins, Kessler is seen having dinner and talking with “his wife,” who of course isn’t actually there. Evidently this is something he does each year on their wedding anniversary, though he’s (seemingly) normal otherwise. In fact, he’s overwhelmingly caring and kind.\n\nUnbeknownst to Kessler though, his wife is still around. The night she ran off, there was a car wreck, and while the best friend died, she survived, and she’s been squirreled away nearby by Kessler’s gardener. Wifey is in a perpetually dazed, amnesic state, so she’s being kept hidden until she’s “better.”\n\nShe gets out sometimes though, and when Kessler spots her standing outside of his window, he’s goes into a homicidal trance, in which he simply has to strangle someone with his robe. That’s right, prior to the start of the film, there’s been multiple unsolved murders amongst the staff of the Kessler home (an exact number is never given, but it’s noted as “a lot”). No one knows it’s Kessler – not even Kessler himself!\n\nThis may all sound farfetched, but suspension of belief is often required with these 1930s/1940s horror cheapies, so nothing too out of the ordinary there. But what drives Invisible Ghost and makes it so much fun is just how nutty it is. No one in this movie ever behaves in a logical manner, it never plays out how you think it should, even by wartime poverty row standards. And because of that, it’s an absolute blast to watch. Some of the notable aspects that’ll have you simultaneously scratching your head and getting a total kick out of the proceedings (CAUTION: some spoilers are coming!):\n\nOkay, so multiple people have been murdered in the Kessler home over an unspecified number of years, most or all of them apparently being servile employees. And yet, suspicion never falls on Kessler or his daughter or, really, anyone else in the house that hasn’t been offed yet? Did the cops think some rando is just occasionally stopping by and doing this, and leaving it at that?\n\nKessler is rich and powerful, so it’s no stretch to imagine these murders are newsworthy; we’re talking front page kinda stuff here. In fact, late in the film it’s implied they have made the papers. So how exactly are they still finding employees? A high probability of being murdered isn’t exactly a perk, no matter how tough the job market in the area may or may not be. (Speaking of that late film moment, it’s during a conversation with the new cook, who mentions she doesn’t read the papers. So how’d she find out about the job? Does Kessler put up a “help wanted” sign in his window? And if it was by word of mouth, newspapers or no, wouldn’t the reputation of the house precede it?)\n\nWhy not move out of the house? This is explained away as “sentimental reasons,” cause, wife. Okay, fine, I’ll buy that, but why keep hiring staff if there’s the strong possibility they’ll be killed? Kessler (when he’s not in nutso mode) is seen to be kind and compassionate, so wouldn’t he, you know, want to keep people as safe as possible until the murderer is apprehended? Can’t he make his own dinner for awhile?\n\nAre we really supposed to believe the gardener has hidden Kessler’s wife away for several years? And while I can kinda sorta understand his rationale for keeping her hidden (it’d crush Kessler), she’s obviously damaged mentally – is hiding her away until she “gets better” really the best course of medical action? And after a number of years without getting “better,” shouldn’t he try to find a doctor, at least on the sly? I mean, the gardener is clearly no Einstein, but this is still incredibly stupid. And by the way, he doesn’t want to bring Kessler’s wife to him cause it’d hurt Kessler? Dude, the guy is having a yearly dinner conversation with an empty chair!\n\nKessler has a daughter, Virginia, who has a quasi-fiancée, Ralph. Ralph evidently had some sort of relationship with Kessler’s new maid, Cecile. Cecile still carries a torch for Ralph, even though Ralph says it’s over. Ralph is overheard telling her she’s not going to stand in the way of his happiness, so when Cecile is murdered by Kessler, Ralph is convicted on that slimmest of circumstantial evidence – and executed!\n\nIn the very next scene, Ralph’s identical twin brother Paul shows up at the house! Say what?! He couldn’t get there in time for the trial/execution, but he wants to help solve the murders, so he’s quickly given a room! Paul never really does that much, making you wonder why they’d even bother with the whole twins thing in the first place. And speaking of, Paul never seems too upset his brother was executed for a murder he presumably didn’t commit. In fact, except for a moment when Kessler is afraid the new cook has been murdered, none of the main characters ever seem too concerned/upset when a new murder has been committed. Even the cop in charge of the investigation seems more annoyed with it than anything.\n\nAt one point the idiot gardener gets offed by Kessler – except that he doesn’t, except that he does. Y’see, Kessler strangles him during one of his trances, the body is found, and eventually taken to the coroner. When the gardener’s wife shows up to see the body (she seems upset, even though she’s not really a main character), she discovers that he’s still alive! He dies for good soon thereafter, but it’s such an odd, odd moment. First off, the wife screams in terror rather than being overjoyed he’s alive. But also, I mean, the guy’s heart was still beating, yet missed by the cops, coroner et al., for seemingly hours (Jack Klugman would have never stood for that – and as the story goes, he didn’t). And not just that, but is this really a believable outcome of strangulation? The guy was hurt bad enough to be unconscious for a relatively lengthy period of time, only to randomly regain consciousness momentarily before completely dying? I can see something like that happening as the result of a head injury or whatever, but having the air choked out of you?\n\nLate in the film, when it’s suspected the butler is the culprit, Paul insists he be tested to see if he’s insane before being arrested. Ignoring that the test is hilariously simple, it’s a nice thought, especially since the evidence, while still circumstantial, is much stronger than what got Ralph executed.\n\nNot really a strange moment, but Bela’s declaration of “apple pie? My, that will be a treat” at one point is pretty hilarious.\n\nKessler’s wife seems to have a strange psychic connection with Kessler. He seems to magically know whenever she’s standing outside the window, and at the climax when he’s in mid-strangle (this time with observers), she suddenly drops dead, which then immediately releases her mental hold on Kessler. This ‘connection’ is never explained. So we have to surmise that his love for her was so strong that he just ‘knew’, I guess?\n\nIf it seems like I’m picking the film apart just for the sake of being snarky, trust me, I’m not. Invisible Ghost is so much fun simply because it’s so loopy. Forget suspension of belief, just throw your ideas of logic right out the window from the start. No one behaves logically in this film, so just sit back, accept that from the word go, and hold on for the ride!\n\nSome positive positives: they’re somewhat obscured in the dupey, worn print Amvest utilized, but the usage of shadows and evocative camera angles in Invisible Ghost is truly impressive. It’s all relative, but this movie is more atmospheric and artistic than it really has any right to be. (Kino’s terrific 2017 Blu-ray release shows all this much better, though it seems to be out of print now, which is a shame, because it’s amazing to realize the film could look as terrific as it does there.)\n\nAlso, the butler Evans is played by African-American Charles Muse, and far from a jokey Mantan Moreland-like character, Muse plays the role with dignity and intelligence. Considering the time period this was released, this is both amazing and refreshing. Muse is excellent.\n\n(Speaking of acting, as always, Lugosi is terrific.)\n\nI can’t recommend Invisible Ghost highly enough. At only a little over an hour, it naturally moves fast, and its complete lack of predictable behavior is an asset, not a detriment. It’s breezy, cheap, wartime poverty row horror, and it’s irresistible.\n\nOf course, in this case, things finish up with Grampa, which is just the icing on the cake. Again, like a television horror host, it’s an appropriate (and fun!) way to wind up the presentation.\n\nLike the intro, I can only say so much about the outro that I haven’t said before. A list of available titles are given, a way to order them is shown, Lewis makes corny jokes, the end.\n\nAlthough, despite having seen this stuff so many times prior, something humorous that struck me this time around (and which I can’t really recall taking stock of before) is Lewis’ reactions to the appearance of the “Casket of Horrors” (supposedly a display found in video stores, it was meant to house this Amvest video series, though how many, IF any, made it out there is up for question). His reactions go from shocked and confused to accepting of the sudden appearance of the display, which I found kinda funny.\n\nBy the way, the blank space between the end of the movie and the start of the outro is considerable – so much so that I initially thought Amvest accidentally left the outro off entirely at first. Which isn’t unprecedented; one of my tapes from this series totally left it off, which in retrospect made Lewis’ hype for it in the intro unintentionally funny. But it leads to this question: were they putting these intros/outros on manually each time? The jump in video quality from the host segments (which weren’t exactly HD anyway) to that of the movie (which often looks like a copy of a copy) is usually pretty noticeable. And if you’ll recall my last Amvest post here, where the opening credits of the movie were cut off somewhat, it makes me echo a question I asked last time: how does this even happen?\n\nNo matter, cause the package was ultimately complete here, and all the better for it. But don’t let Al Lewis be the deciding factor; Invisible Ghost can and does stand on its own as a fun, often ridiculous piece of entertainment. As an entry in Bela’s poverty row output, it may not be high art, but it’s irresistible all the same. You can’t not love it! Give it a shot, and if you can do that with Al “Grampa” Lewis in the vicinity, all the better!"
