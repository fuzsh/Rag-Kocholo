        "text": "Nothing screams Halloween like a good ghost-hunting show.\n\nSo with All Hallows' Eve only a week away, we decided it was time to take a closer look at the paranormal reality shows that make those little hairs on the back of our neck stand up. We know not everyone believes in ghosts and ghouls, which is why we're examining both the series that take themselves seriously and the shows unafraid to have a little fun.\n\nFor instance, Buzzfeed Unsolved: Supernatural launched its seventh and final season on Oct. 15. And even after countless investigations, hosts Ryan Bergara and Shane Madej still come off as amateur ghost hunters—in the best way. The longtime partners are unafraid to roast themselves while touring infamous locations—like the allegedly possessed Conjuring house—leaving us entertained while hoping for a ghost to pop up."
