        "text": "‘It’s only a movie’. At one point or another, you’ve likely repeated that phrase to yourself whenever watching a particularly terrifying horror film, to bring yourself down from an anxiety attack or stave off any potential nightmares. But what happens when a movie isn’t just a movie? What if what you’re watching actually happened? Sure, you might be able to convince yourself that the filmmakers are embellishing the facts for cinematic effect, and that’s usually true… but not always.\n\nIn these 15 frightening films based on actual events, you might find some truth being stretched, but the stories skew a bit too close to reality for comfort. Don’t freak out, though: for you, it really is still just a movie. Just keep in mind that for someone else, it was reality.\n\nRecommended:"
