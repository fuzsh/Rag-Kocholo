        "text": "As the Ghost Hunters all enjoy a hiatus, or should I say, as I enjoy a hiatus from covering the Ghost Hunters shows (the current Ghost Hunters teams, both the Original and the extra-crispy International teams, are on the road shooting right now) I finally get a few minutes here and there to do some background columns and maybe even a bit of deeper analysis. At least it lets me get to the email and comments that have been piling up behind my back when I wasn’t looking.\n\nAn email I received recently indeed, got me thinking about some of the old TAPS team members and I began to wonder what they may be up to lately. Then I figured, if I’m wondering, then maybe you are too, so over the next couple of days we’ll check out the scoop on a few of our favorites like Andy Andrews and Brian Harnois. Who knows, maybe I’ll even manage to scare up a couple more that have been hiding out lately. Lucky for you, we’ll start with everyone’s favorite.\n\nDonna Lacroix\n\nThe last article I wrote about Donna Lacroix still goes off the charts every month with people looking for information on what she is up to so I did a little digging and I managed to find Donna's relatively new Facebook page, called appropriately enough \"The OFFICIAL Donna LaCroix Fan Page.\"\n\nA quick run through of the page finds that Donna's Crohn's disease apparently in remission and she says that she is doing well. Good news! The last we had heard after that horrific radio show fiasco was that her health was 'deteriorating.'\n\nIn fact, Donna is doing so well that she has taken up acting. In an announcement on the Facebook page she tells us that she has landed a role as a police detective named Sarah Parker in a serial killer film called \"Watching You.\" There isn't that much available on the the film other than it appears that it is being shot rather locally, with a casting call coming up on May 7th in Newport, Rhode Island. There is a photo gallery over here that you can check out. I'd give you the names of the Director and the film company but frankly, they don't even have Facebook pages, nevermind a web presence where you can check them out, but hey, neither did Blair Witch before it went all huge on us, right? Right.\n\nOddly, Donna is also scheduled to be on an internet radio talk show again. Yes. You read that correctly. She is doing an internet radio talk show. Again. You can hear Donna at 7pm on May 5th and forever after in their archives, I'm sure. Don't bother checking Donna's Facebook page for the address on this once because she didn't even come close to posting the correct address. If you want to hear what she has to say on this radio show, go over here to listen in. I'm sure everyone is hoping that this interview turns out better than that other one, but hey, a big 2 points for climbing right back on that bucking bronco.\n\nSo that about sums up what former Ghost Hunters / Ghost Hunters International case manager Donna Lacroix is up to these days, follow along with her on Facebook or you can always read the book when it comes out. Yes, supposedly there is a Donna Lacroix book in the works as well. I’ll be sure to drop you all a link to it when it shows up on Amazon."
