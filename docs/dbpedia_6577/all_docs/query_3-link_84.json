        "text": "Whether you believe in ghosts or not, it's hard not to be intrigued by the paranormal.\n\nThe world of television has jumped on this fascination by giving us shows like Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures, and Kindred Spirits, all of which seek to expand our knowledge of the spirit world and prove the existence of ghosts.\n\nMore or less, these shows follow a similar format: investigators learn about the history of an allegedly haunted building, speak with witnesses who have experienced paranormal activity there, and conduct an overnight investigation where they try to prove or disprove various claims.\n\nThese programs are interesting to watch no matter where you stand on the idea of ghosts.\n\nIf you're a believer who thinks that there are too many stories of unexplained activity for everything to be bunk, you can deepen and expand your knowledge of the paranormal by watching these shows.\n\nIf you're a skeptic who's not quite sure where you stand, you can see what the investigators find and assess whether or not the evidence is enough to convince you.\n\nAnd if you're a non-believer who thinks all of this is all absolute poppycock and that those on ghost shows are all liars trying to make a buck, well, you can try to debunk what you see.\n\nEither way, ghost shows have been around for a while, and many episodes feature New England locations.\n\nHere are 20 spots in New Hampshire and Massachusetts that have been seen on Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures, and Kindred Spirits."
