        "text": "Directed by Roy Del Ruth\n\nProduced by Jack Leewood\n\nScreenplay by Orville H. Hampton\n\nStory by Orville H. Hampton & Charles O’Neal\n\nDirector Of Photography: Karl Struss, ASC\n\nSupervising Film Editor: Harry Gerstad\n\nMakeup: Ben Nye & Dick Smith\n\nMusic by Irving Gertz\n\nCast: Beverly Garland (Joyce Webster/Jane Marvin), Bruce Bennett (Dr. Eric Lorimer), Lon Chaney Jr. (Manon), George Macready (Dr. Mark Sinclair), Frieda Inescort (Mrs. Lavinia Hawthorne), Richard Crane (Paul Webster), Douglas Kennedy (Dr. Wayne MacGregor), Dudley Dickerson (Porter), Hal K. Dawson (Conductor), Ruby Goodwin (Louann the Maid), Vince Townsend Jr. (Toby)\n\nAs a kid, I’d see stills from The Alligator People (1959) in Famous Monsters or one of my sci-fi and horror film books, and it looked like the Perfect Movie. If only I could see it!\n\nGuess I haven’t developed a whole lot since those Monster Kid days, because now that I’ve seen it (first on the late show and finally on Blu-Ray), I’m still of a mind that The Alligator People comes real close to being the Perfect Movie — in my Hollywood, at least.\n\nOn a train on their wedding night, Beverly Garland’s husband (Richard Crane) gets a telegram and splits. Beverly’s search for her man takes her to a plantation in Louisiana, where it turns out Crane has been the subject of George Macready’s medical experiments using reptile hormones to regenerate limbs. Crane had been mangled in a plane crash, and while the gator juice injections were working, something started going wrong — hence the cryptic telegram and the quick exit. Macready found that radiation treatments were looking promising, but would that cure Crane or further his reptilian transformation?\n\nThe Alligator People, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\n\nIt’s in black and white CinemaScope, a glorious aesthetic that can elevate almost any junk to classic status (the key to my love of Lippert’s Regal and API movies).\n\nIt mines the tried and true people-turning-into-animals vein, a theme that had been proving itself since Island Of Lost Souls (1932) — and that Lippert had already used successfully with The Fly (1958).\n\nIt makes great use of its Southern Gothic plantation setting. As a kid in South Georgia (Thomasville), plantation houses, Spanish moss, even alligators were familiar to me. This made the movie kinda plausible!\n\nIt’s got Beverly Garland in it. For me and a lot of other male Monster Kids, she was an early crush. Later, I’d appreciate what a terrific actress she was.\n\nAlong with Ms. Garland, there’s a solid cast of real 50s pros — Bruce Bennett, George Macready, Douglas Kennedy. You need guys like that to add credence to all the pseudo-scientific dialogue.\n\nA hook-armed Lon Chaney, Jr. is on hand to add some classic horror credibility to the proceedings, and he’s gleefully over the top.\n\nThe alligator people makeup effects are just good enough — and bad enough. That mix is crucial.\n\nBut the thing that really makes The Alligator People is that key ingredient found in so many B Movies of the 50s (regardless of the genre) — the combined craft of the people who made them. Sure, it’s hokum, but it’s really well-made hokum.\n\nThe talent behind the camera is certainly impressive. This was director Roy Del Ruth’s next-to-last film. Oscar-winner Karl Struss’s cinematography is gorgeous. He was one of the DPs on Gone With The Wind (1939), and he shot a number of the Regal and API pictures. Ben Nye and Dick Smith handled the makeup; Nye had worked on The Fly. The editing is tight, and the art direction looks bigger than the picture’s $300,000 budget would have you expect. (That was really splurging for API.)\n\nWhat’s more, everyone knew to play it straight (even though Beverly Garland always said the hardest thing about making this movie was keeping a straight face). Horror and science fiction films have to create their own logic, sweep up the audience and keep them so involved they don’t have a chance to realize how ridiculous it all is. The Alligator People does this very well.\n\nThe Alligator People was released in July of 1959, paired with another “Terror-Topping, Supershock Thrill Sensation,” Edward Bernds’ Return Of The Fly. I can’t imagine a cooler night at the movies.\n\nWith movies like this, the major studios tried to compete with what Roger Corman, AIP and Allied Artists were offering to the lucrative teenager audience. 20th Century-Fox was smart to put Lippert and his gang in charge of films like this, with Fox’s major-studio facilities (and ‘Scope lenses) adding production values the independents could only dream of. (The cheaper ones were shot on independent lots around Hollywood.)\n\nIn that way, The Alligator People is the best of both worlds — and, yep, a pretty Perfect Movie.\n\nI’m really excited about this one, as Shout Factory’s Universal Horror Blu-Ray series moves into the 50s. This is announced for release on August 25.\n\nThe Black Castle (1952)\n\nDirected by Nathan H. Juran\n\nStarring Richard Greene, Boris Karloff, Stephen McNally, Rita Corday, Lon Chaney, Jr., John Hoyt, Michael Pate\n\nYou could say this was the last of the true Universal-type horror movies, with all the trapping and a few of the actors we associate with such things. It was Nathan Juran’s first time as director. He was on the film as art director, but was moved into the director’s chair when Joseph Pevney walked.\n\nCult Of The Cobra (1955)\n\nDirected by Francis D. Lyon\n\nStarring Faith Domergue, Richard Long, Kathleen Hughes, Marshall Thompson, Jack Kelly, William Reynolds, David Janssen\n\nThis story of a cult of snake worshippers, a deadly curse and the beautiful, deadly snake goddess (Faith Domergue) making their way to New York went out as the second feature behind Revenge Of The Creature (1955).\n\nThe Thing That Couldn’t Die (1958)\n\nDirected by Will Cowan\n\nStarring William Reynolds, Andra Martin, Jeffrey Stone, Carolyn Kearney\n\nRunning just 69 minutes, shot by the great Russell Metty and with terrific poster art from Reynold Brown (up top), this played with Hamer’s Horror Of Dracula (1958) in the States. It’s about a telepathic head that’s discovered in a box at a dude ranch.\n\nThe Shadow Of The Cat (1961)\n\nDirected by John Gilling\n\nStarring André Morell, Barbara Shelley, William Lucas, Fred Jackson\n\nA cat witnesses a murder, then helps both solve it and bring the culprits to their just rewards. Shot in black & white by Hammer’s ace cameraman Arthur Grant.\n\nScream Factory has come up with some real gold in this one, and it’s good to see these more obscure Universal horror pictures get a chance to shine. They’ll be seen in their original widescreen aspect ratio, with the exception of The Black Castle, which predates the shift to widescreen. Highly recommended."
