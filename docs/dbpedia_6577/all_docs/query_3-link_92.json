        "text": "Carrying out thorough ghost hunting investigations is a long and tedious process, and to be in with the best chance of catching some evidence, you need to have the right ghost hunting equipment with you. The larger professional teams have an array of equipment they use, some of it costly, that ordinary groups and individuals don’t have the budget to buy.\n\nBelow, you’ll find the more popular and affordable pieces of ghost hunting equipment that you’ll need for your investigations. It’s not all necessary at once, as you can get started with nothing more than a decent camera. If you have a small budget, start there, then add to your ghost hunting kit over time.\n\nSo, let’s get to it. Here are some top recommendations for what ghost hunting equipment you need for a thorough ghost hunt.\n\nFor the countless fans of ghost hunting TV shows who are itching to get off the couch and track some spirits on their own, professional ghost hunter Russ Vogel’s arms beginners with all they need to start investigating. Discover proven scientific methods and the latest technology used by the pros.\n\nHunting Ghosts: A Paranormal Investigator’s Guide\n\nThe most basic necessity of all the tools for paranormal investigation is the camera. They’re not only used to capture any paranormal activity, they can be used to document your investigation.\n\nDigital cameras are the simplest and best option for amateur and professional ghost hunters alike. Because you can transfer photos directly to your computer for further investigation, it saves a lot of time and money compared to developing shots taken using a film camera.\n\nThe one drawback of using a digital camera can be the lack of settings to choose from (in many cases), and there can be a lag period when taking your photos.\n\nBest Selling Digital Cameras\n\nIR Cameras (Night Vision)\n\nYou may want to record a video to document your experiences on an investigation. For this, you’re going to need a good IR (infra-red) night vision camera.\n\nRecommended Night Vision Camera\n\nIt’s a matter of preference whether you choose digital over analogue. Both have their benefits. With digital, it allows for easy uploading to a computer, and the audio file can then be shared easily. Some seasoned investigators still use analogue as they allow for better record keeping. Whichever digital recorder you choose, it’s recommended that you have two with you at all times so that you can cross-reference each during a review.\n\nBest Selling Digital Recorders\n\nAs you may be investigating in the dark, it’s a good idea to stock up on torches. Preferably it will be one with a red lens, but clear ones are fine too. The red lens doesn’t interfere with night vision, yet it still provides you with a good light source for finding your way around a location.\n\nRecommended Ghost Hunting Torch\n\nExtra Batteries\n\nPack at least three, maybe even five sets of spare batteries for each device! Spirits are known to drain the energy from fully charged devices, and you never know when your batteries will run out of power! So it’s always better to prepare.\n\nBest Selling Camera Batteries\n\nWalkie Talkies\n\nIf a group of you are investigating a location and you are splitting up, it’s always handy to have a walkie talkie with each party, as you can cross-reference experiences as they happen.\n\nRecommended Walkie Talkies\n\nWatch\n\nUsed to note the time of any experiences and to time your investigations in different areas of the location. Best to buy one with an illuminating face or fingers so you can see it in the dark. Of course, you can use your phone, but we recommend using a watch as it wouldn’t affect your eyes like the screen’s lighting on a phone would.\n\nNotepad & Pens\n\nIt would be best if you had a notepad and pen to note down anything and everything that happened on the night, such as fluctuations in meter readings, anomalies on camera, recordings, and any personal feelings or experiences.\n\nA video record of what is going on is always a good idea, just in case you miss something with the naked eye, which is likely given you’ll be in the dark! You should carry one around with you, as well as have one or two stationary in rooms where you’re not investigating. Ideally, they’ll have a built-in hard drive or record on memory cards, so you can easily upload the footage to a computer to analyse any evidence.\n\nRecommended Night Vision Camera\n\nThe EMF detects electromagnetic fields, a known attribute to paranormal activity. If you notice a sudden high spike in one particular area, this could relate to something paranormal. However, it could also be related to wiring. Check to see if you’re near any wiring in the walls, floors, ceiling etc. If you get an unusual reading, do your best to rule out only other sources before you come to any conclusion!\n\nRecommended EMF Detector\n\nSudden cold spots can often be associated with ghosts, so having a thermometer on hand when you need it is crucial. It can be used as a backup to any readings from your EMF detector or other captured anomalies. Always take a base reading throughout the location first, and note any drafty areas that could be caused by ventilation or old windows.\n\nRecommended Thermometer\n\nIf you Want Something Special\n\nWe’ve spotted a great little product available on Amazon, and it’s a thermal imager/night vision camera in one.\n\nView Perfect Prime Infrared (IR) Thermal Imager & Visible Light Camera\n\nThis is a good bit of kit to have set up when you’re in other areas investigating. If it goes off when you’re in another room, it can lead to some interesting evidence. When you set this up in an area, always make sure you have a camcorder set up, pointing towards it, so you can review the footage to see what set it off.\n\nRecommended Motion Detector Alarm\n\nThe spirit box is a relatively new piece of ghost hunting kit designed by Frank Sumption back in 2000 whilst he was carrying out his EVP research. The box received notoriety when the Ghost Adventures crew used it for the first time during an investigation at Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum on October 30, 2009.\n\nRead reviews of the Spirit Box on Amazon\n\nHow the SB7 Spirit Box Works\n\nThe box rapidly flicks between AM frequencies, with white noise as a filler. The received noise was then fed into an ‘echo chamber’ on the box, which enabled spirits to manipulate the noise to form words, and the output is fed into a speaker, thus allowing communications in real-time."
