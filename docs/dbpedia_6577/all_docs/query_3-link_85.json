        "text": "SAGINAW, MI - Lights flicker and buzz, a door bangs and footsteps echo in an empty hallway.\n\nIt’s exactly what the crew making the latest movie for the Haunted Saginaw series is hoping to see.\n\nDirector Steve Shippy’s paranormal documentary series returns in November, marking its 10th anniversary. The newest film, “A Haunting on Brockway Street,” details the investigation of a local family’s historic home.\n\nThe film premieres Nov. 15-16 at the Temple Theatre. Tickets are $27 and VIP access is available for an additional $35 that includes a tour of the historic Temple Theatre and an after party in the historic ballroom. Tickets can be bought online, by calling 989-754-SHOW, or by stopping by the Temple box office.\n\nEach attendee will get a copy of the DVD.\n\nSteve Gonsalves of the TV show “Ghost Hunters” and the Travel Channel show “Ghost Nation” is slated to attend the premiere and the after party.\n\nShippy said his interest in the paranormal began while growing up in a house that was haunted. He began investigating the paranormal as a teenager and conducted amateur investigations at local hotspots with the goal of capturing evidence.\n\nAs time went on, Shippy’s investigations got more intricate as he acquired more professional gear. He got to the point of wanting to document the investigations he was doing with other investigators.\n\n“At one point I kept saying, ‘What if we film this, what if we actually documented what we’re doing?’\" he said.\n\nThe first documentary, “Haunting at Hamilton Street,” which focused on Old Town Saginaw, was born and it sold out for its two-day premiere at the Temple Theatre, which seats about 2,000.\n\nInspired by the success of the first documentary, a new Haunted Saginaw documentary has been produced every year since then and has premiered to large audiences each time.\n\nShippy’s documentaries have focused on numerous locations throughout the Saginaw area, including the old Potter Street Train Station, the Temple Theatre and Hoyt Library.\n\nShippy says people are intrigued by paranormal activity, but the history of the featured locations are also a draw.\n\nShippy said his success has led to him earning a spot on the Travel Channel. The network plans to air a series in January that focuses on Shippy and his team traveling around Michigan and states such as Iowa, Kansas, and Tennessee to conduct investigations. The show is titled, “Haunting in the Heartland.”\n\nAll of the Haunted Saginaw documentaries are available to stream for free to Amazon Prime members.\n\nRelated:\n\nGhost hunter’s ‘A Haunting at Hoyt Library’ premiers in Saginaw\n\nIs this house still ‘haunted’ 42 years later?
