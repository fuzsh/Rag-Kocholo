        "text": "The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It\n\nThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is the third movie in the Conjuring instalment – if you’re not counting the other movies in the Conjuring universe, like Annabelle. But we’re not here to talk about haunted dolls! This film delivers thrilling ghost-hunting reality right to our screens. And to make it more creepy, it’s based on a true story!\n\nThe iconic paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren, return for a new spin on horror movies. This tale is a thrilling mix of horror and mystery, and the crime in question? Murder. That’s right – a man is accused of murder and claims the devil made him do it.\n\nGhost stories based on reality don’t come around often – plus, at the end of the movie, you’ll hear the real audio from the exorcism!\n\nIf you want to skip to the “real stuff,” you can listen to David Glatzel’s exorcism audio.\n\nGhostbusters\n\nLet’s turn back the clock and talk about the OG, the trendsetter, the classic among ghost movies – Ghostbusters! This iconic ghost film from 1984 is a great mash-up of comedy and horror.\n\nWatch the misadventures of the Ghostbusters – a fun group of ghost hunters working hard to catch ghosts with Proton Packs. While we don’t have Proton Packs, we have EMF meters to help you track your ghosts.\n\nIt’s a fantastic way to indulge in the mysteries of paranormal investigation while keeping it light-hearted; you probably won’t struggle to sleep after Ghostbusters, unlike some other horror films on this list.\n\nInsidious\n\nLet’s return to 2010 to the fantastic original Insidious movie – although the following chapters are pretty good, too! The Lambert family moves into a new house when their son explores the creepy attic and slips into a coma the next day. Weird, right?\n\nEven weirder, the kid is stuck in a coma for three months as paranormal things happen around the house. Eventually, they call in some professional paranormal investigators, but things keep getting out of hand in their haunted house! Talk about unlucky real estate.\n\nThe Insidious ghost movies are well on their way to becoming classics, and for good reason.\n\nThe Haunting\n\nThe Haunting (1999) is a chilling horror movie that could actually happen, especially in this day and age.\n\nThis classic ghost story is set in the infamous Hill House, where a team is called in to investigate weird sleep disorders in the mansion and the haunting rumours that followed.\n\nThe movie is a remake of the 1963 film of the same name, but the better special effects send more shivers down your spine. The cast includes Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones.\n\nIf you’re a fan of ghost films, love a celebrity cast, and are looking for a reason not to sleep tonight, then we’re sure this creepy house will welcome you! You’ll certainly be able to flex your muscles as a paranormal investigator.\n\nGrave Encounters\n\nGet ready for a grave encounter… pun intended.\n\nThis 2011 gem is a found-footage horror movie that takes ghost films to a new level of spookiness! The movie follows a TV series crew of ghost-hunters as they investigate an abandoned psychiatric hospital. They’re trying to get more ratings for their show, so they lock themselves in the hospital!\n\nStrange things begin to happen when they step inside the eerie asylum. There’s also a sequel, Grave Encounters 2 (2012), where a new group of filmmakers (slash ghost hunters) check out the events from the first movie.\n\nIf you’re a fan of horror and love a good ghost story with a dose of found-footage thrills, Grave Encounters is one of the best ghost films and puts a realistic spin on spookiness.\n\nThe Frighteners\n\n“My body is a roadmap of pain. And pain has its valves.” That line hasn’t left our minds since we saw this thrilling movie!\n\nThe Frighteners hit screens in 1996 and is an incredible horror-comedy that’s sure to tickle your funny bone (giving you some ghostly chills!). This gem of a film stands out for its storyline and cast – it stars none other than the legendary Michael J. Fox!\n\nFrank Bannister, played by Fox, has a unique talent – he can communicate with ghosts! Using his ghost busting skills, Frank teams up with some friendly spirits to con people by pretending to haunt their homes. But then, a ghost starts causing real problems in town.\n\nThe Frighteners have a cool twist on traditional horror movies by making the protagonist a ghost. Michael J. Fox’s performance adds an extra layer of spooky charm.\n\nThe Legend of Hell House\n\nAnother oldie, but goodie!\n\nThe Legend of Hell House is a 1973 ghost movie based around the Belasco house, a place with a weird and sinister history. A group of investigators is hired to check it out in a slow burn, and they gradually start to unravel the horrors!\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, the team faces a series of unexplained events. If you’re a fan of ghost movies and love a good haunted house tale with a dose of mystery, this “hell house” opens its doors for you.\n\nThe Others\n\n2001 brought us The Others, and we are forever grateful for ghost movies like this classic! Nicole Kidman plays a mother in a haunted mansion whose two children have a strange sensitivity to light.\n\nIt’s a psychological thriller that will keep you guessing to the end as weird things slowly happen around the house. Once the credits roll, you must figure out what’s real! The perspective is super fresh and extremely mysterious.\n\n1408\n\nAnother one to mess with your mind! 1408, which dropped in 2007, is a psychological horror based on the Dolphin Hotel. You’ve probably heard of this paranormal base! Our main man, John Cusack, plays a writer who specializes in debunking supernatural claims.\n\nHe gets a postcard telling him not to stay in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel, but he can’t resist. He spends the night, and things get creepy pretty quickly. John Cusack’s awesome performance, combined with the film’s mind-twisting nature, makes it a must for your movie bucket list.\n\nIf you plan on staying in room 1408, you might need a protection spell!\n\nTips Before Watching These Films\n\nPreparing yourself before watching these scary ghost movies would be best. Here are our top 3 tips:\n\nDim the lights, close the curtains, and light some candles. This will set the spooky mood!\n\nBring your bravest friends – it’s way more fun in a group! Plus, you can protect each other if something sinister goes down.\n\nStock up on some ghost-themed snacks. It helps to have something to bite down on during tense moments!\n\nFAQs\n\nAre ghost-hunting movies family-friendly?\n\nMost ghost movies can get scary, so check the rating before letting the kids watch. Ghostbusters are probably the most family-friendly movie on our list.\n\nAre the ghosts in ghost-hunting movies real?\n\nThey can be based on real events and real evil spirits, but they are usually completely fictional!\n\nReferences"
