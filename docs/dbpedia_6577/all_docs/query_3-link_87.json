        "text": "Aug 17, 2016 by Haunted Manhattan\n\nIt’s no secret that Americans have become kind of obsessed with the paranormal in the past few years. With the astounding success of horror movies centered around haunted houses, and tours launching daily of famous haunted locations like Eastern State Penitentiary, Alcatraz, and of course our haunting tours of three different areas of Manhattan, people are more and more into ghosts every day.\n\nFor us, we love entertaining and educating the people about the spirits lurking around Manhattan, and we’ve dedicated ourselves to making our tours better each year. However, we can’t answer your emergency calls if there is a malevolent spirit in your house. The following people have made a career out of investigating the claims made by homeowners and business owners that have a haunting that is interrupting their daily lives.\n\nEd and Lorraine Warren – This husband and wife team started out back in the seventies, and they have investigated some of the worst claims of malevolent hauntings in the world, including the true story that inspired the movie The Conjuring. These two call themselves psychic investigators that help to try and rid homes of demonic presence, although Ed is a demonologist and Lorraine is a trance medium. Together, they have seen some of the most horrifically haunted homes in the country, and have since retired, passing the torch to their son in law.\n\nHarry Price – This man earned the designation of being named one of the first paranormal investigators in the world, although he had no experience to back it up. He was a magician who claimed to be able to detect fake apparitions. His first experience with the paranormal started when he was just a teenager and spent the night in a haunted house with his friend. When they tried to capture the spirit they saw, the camera flash malfunctioned and they were unable to do so. He worked many famous cases until his death in 1948.\n\nThe Ghost Hunters – Not to be confused with the Ghostbusters, Grant Wilson and Jason Hawes were the two lead investigators on the SyFy show, Ghost Hunters. They quickly became famous for going into homes and businesses that claimed to have a haunting. The two of them formed The Atlantic Paranormal Society in 1990 and privately investigated cases until 2004 when they were picked up as national televised ghost hunting show. They completed eleven seasons of the show on the SyFy network, and previously planned to conclude, but have recently announced they will be returning in August of this year.\n\nIf you’re crazy about The Conjuring, or gaga for The Ghostbusters, come check out one of our tours and find out the haunted history that surrounds each of our apparitions.
