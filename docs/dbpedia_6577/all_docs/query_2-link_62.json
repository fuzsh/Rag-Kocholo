        "text": "It’s been over a month ago since I first discovered The Blackwell Ghost streaming on Amazon Prime. Honestly, I had passed it over in the suggestions menu several times, but it was one of those late nights where I wanted one last movie and this one was only an hour or so long.\n\nThe first interesting thing about this film is that it is described as a documentary. In fact, there was no mention of this being a horror film or even found footage in any description I could find.\n\nNow, I’m a paranormal enthusiast and have been an investigator for years, so I was further excited as the film began and the filmmaker in voiceover talked about his experiences making zombie movies in Los Angeles and how he’d decided to try something new.\n\nIn short, he wanted to make a documentary about the paranormal, and his interest had grown from a viral video that had made the rounds on YouTube of supposed actual paranormal phenomena caught on CCTV.\n\nOver the next hour, I watched as the amateur documentarian went on his own adventure investigating a home in Pennsylvania. Supposedly, in the 1940s, the home was owned by James and Ruth Blackwell.\n\nRuth had a reputation for being a bit strange, so it was no surprise to her neighbors when she was accused of murdering seven children and disposing of their bodies down the well in the basement.\n\nThroughout the film, he never once wavers in his assertion that what he and his wife, Terri, are experiencing is actually real. Furthermore, he backs up those claims with alleged researched proof of the history of the home. I have to admit, by the end of the film I wasn’t entirely sure what to believe. What I knew for sure was that it was a hell of a movie that I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nOver the next few days, I watched the film five or six more times. I showed it to local friends and recommended it to others. Everyone seemed to really enjoy it, but their reactions were the same across the board–they just weren’t sure they could believe what they were watching.\n\nAnd really, who could blame them?\n\nWe live in a post Paranormal Activity world. In an era filled with technology where the line between reality and illusion seems to blur more and more every day, and while belief in the paranormal is actually growing, there’s a general certainty that we won’t find it on film.\n\nPerhaps it was natural that my reporter’s sense kicked in at this point. I chatted with our editor-in-chief here at iHorror and decided I needed to dig into the story of The Blackwell Ghost.\n\nI began my search by attempting to discover who the filmmaker was. He is not listed in the credits; however, he did include pictures of a couple of scenes from one of his zombie films.\n\nI was able to match those scenes to a film called Disaster L.A., a low-budget zombie flick from 2014. The name of the filmmaker there was Turner Clay, but Clay is a total ghost online. I found no actual pictures of him and so I could not verify that the man in the film was the man who made the movie.\n\nAfter hitting a virtual dead end while tracking down information on Turner Clay, I turned my search to James and Ruth Blackwell in Pennsylvania in the 1940s and immediately got a hit on the names. However, census records show that the only James and Ruth Blackwell in Pennsylvania in the 1940s were a young African American couple. James and Ruth in the film were not only white, but they were also a much older couple as evidenced by the picture of Ruth that the filmmaker displays in the film.\n\nIt was another dead end but I wasn’t ready to give up just yet.\n\nI contacted Dr. Marie Hardin at Penn State University who put me in contact with Jeff Knapp at the Larry and Ellen Foster Communications Library.\n\nKnapp spent a weekend digging into the library’s considerable resources and at the end of his research could find no mention of the murder I described in 1941 or the years surrounding it.\n\nFurthermore, he could not find a James or Ruth Blackwell connected to a murder investigation at all in the time period. Finally, nowhere in the archives were details of Detective Jim Hooper, a name I had pulled from a newspaper article the filmmaker displays in the movie.\n\nWith this information in hand, I sent a series of emails to the filmmaker via a third party in hope that he would make some time to talk to me. As of this writing, none of those emails have been answered.\n\nSo, here I am, several weeks on with no definitive answers to my questions. I have, however, whittled the possibilities down in my mind.\n\nA. The filmmaker came up with as clever a plan for marketing a horror film as I’ve seen since The Blair Witch Project way back in the 1990s. He filled his film with just the right kind of information to draw the viewer in and foster belief in his audience. In which case, I say “Bravo, a job well done!”\n\nOR\n\nB. The filmmaker actually made a documentary and in the rarest of cases caught actual evidence on camera. For whatever reasons, to protect his own identity or the descendants of those mentioned in the film, he decided to change the names and locations of the home and its sordid history.\n\nAt this time I personally lean toward my first explanation. As I said in the beginning, I am a paranormal investigator and have spent a large part of my life pursuing those mysteries. In other words, to embrace the cliche, I WANT TO BELIEVE!\n\nIf you’re out there reading this, Mr. Clay, please reach out. I’d love to discuss your movie.\n\nIn the meantime, fans of the paranormal or horror movies in general, I encourage you to check out the trailer for The Blackwell Ghost below and stream it on Amazon Prime.\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals\n\nCan you believe it’s been 21 years since Freddy threw down with Jason? The jury is still out on who won.\n\nThis was the last film in which Robert Englund appeared in makeup as Freddy. It’s unclear when or if Freddy will return to a mainstream film, as there is some debate in the surviving Craven household regarding the character’s copyright. Wes Craven directed the first A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984.\n\nPitting famous movie monsters against each other in crossover battles isn’t a new concept. Universal embraced this idea and began doing it back in the 1940s with their own IPs. As is the case with Freddy vs. Jason, the films usually had open endings or no clear winner, since everyone has their favorite and doesn’t want them to lose.\n\nInteresting fact about Freddy vs. Jason: James Wan was supposed to direct, but he chose to make Saw instead.\n\nBelow, we have listed some great horror movie (sci-fi) battle films, starting with the birthday boys themselves. These films range from the biggest budgets to the lowest, but all are a great time.\n\nIf you want to check any of them out, go over to JustWatch and search for the title to find your preferred medium.\n\nFreddy vs. Jason (2003)\n\nFreddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees return to terrorize the teenagers of Elm Street. Only this time, they’re out to get each other, too.\n\nAlien vs. Predator (2004)\n\nDuring an archaeological expedition on Bouvetøya Island in Antarctica, a team of archaeologists and other scientists find themselves caught up in a battle between the two legends. Soon, the team realize that only one species can win.\n\nGodzilla vs. Kong (2021)\n\nLegends collide as Godzilla and Kong, the two most powerful forces of nature, clash on the big screen in a spectacular battle for the ages. As a squadron embarks on a perilous mission into fantastic uncharted terrain, unearthing clues to the Titans’ very origins and mankind’s survival, a conspiracy threatens to wipe the creatures, both good and bad, from the face of the earth forever.\n\nDracula vs Frankenstein (1971)\n\nDracula conspires with a mad doctor to resurrect the Frankenstein Monster.\n\nDollman vs. Demonic Toys (1993)\n\nJudith Grey teams with Brick Bardo (Dollman) and his girlfriend Ginger to face the evil Demonic Toys for one final battle.\n\nDinocroc vs Supergator (2010 – TV movie)\n\nCreated in the laboratories of a biotech corporation, two ravenous mega-reptiles level everything in their way. Now, three defenders must try to save the day. Who shall live and who shall die in the battle between Dinocroc and Supergator?\n\nVersus Films: End of an Era or a Fresh Start?\n\nVersus films, where iconic characters face off in epic battles, have always been a fan favorite, but they are becoming increasingly difficult to produce. Legal complexities and character rights often stand in the way, even though audiences love watching these epic showdowns.\n\nHowever, with classic characters entering the public domain, a new era of versus films is emerging. One of the most anticipated versus films is Mickey vs. Winnie in the upcoming horror film MVW, scheduled for release in 2025.\n\nThis film marks the beginning of a new evolution in versus movies, where beloved childhood icons are transformed into nightmarish adversaries in a terrifying battle that will captivate and horrify audiences. The synopsis teases a chilling confrontation in a cursed forest, where innocence and evil collide in a bloody showdown.\n\nHere is a further description of the Mickey Vs Winnie horror film MVW:\n\n“A century ago, two convicts disappeared into Hell Forest, a place feared for its dark legends and whispers of a sinister curse. The mysterious force lurking within the forest feeds on those who dare to enter.\n\nIn the present day, a group of ex-wilderness reform school survivalists, reunited and bound by a shared history of trauma and rebellion, travels back to their abandoned disciplinary teen camp, nestled at the forest’s edge. The desolate school stands as a decaying symbol of their lost innocence, its walls echoing with secrets and forgotten horrors.\n\nAs they step into the eerie corridors of the school and the shadowy depths of Hell Forest, they unknowingly stir the curse that has lain dormant for generations. The school’s long-buried malevolence intertwines with the forest’s ancient evil, feeding off the ex-troubled teens’—now in their 30s—hidden fears and desires, manifesting as two monstrous figures: Dark Mickey and Dark Winnie, once cherished childhood icons now twisted into grotesque nightmares.\n\nThese twisted incarnations, born from the curse and the group’s own inner demons, become locked in a vicious battle. The hellish energy that transformed innocence into horror now seeks to consume the survivalists, forcing them to confront not only the nightmarish creatures but also the dark secrets from their teen years at Camp Misery Bay Reform School.”\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals"
