        "text": "Ooooh, I haven’t posted since August; whoops! My bad! Time to rectify that, cause it’s October, and that means Halloween is a’comin’, and that means cheesy horror movies. And boy do I have a cheesy flick for us today! Two of ’em, actually.\n\nDig this: from the primordial days of home video, we have a Hollywood Home Theatre release! From 1980! 1980! As of this writing, a whopping 43 years ago! Because they came so early in the home video era (VHS had only been around for three years at that point, and was still a few away from well and truly taking off in a mainstream sense), these Hollywood Home Theatre tapes tend to be pretty rare; for example, it took me years to nab a copy of their Metropolis release. What happened was I ordered one for sale online, and then waited…and waited…and waited. Evidently it had already sold in the seller’s brick-and-mortar store, so a refund was issued, and then I waited even longer (WAY longer. SEVERAL YEARS longer) for another to show up. When one did, I naturally bought it, and while my hopes of a Channing Pollock edit were dashed upon arrival (it turned out to be more or less the same print as what we looked at a thousand years ago here), at least I finally had it.\n\nIndeed, they may be tough finds nowadays (and even back then?), but there were plenty of titles to their credit. In fact, several months back, I kept watching (and unwatching) an auction with a bunch of old western movie VHS tapes. Most of them I didn’t care about, but there were three of these HHT tapes, each featuring multiple b-westerns per, and that’s what kept my ears figuratively perked. I didn’t technically need most of the films presented (and the ones I didn’t, to the best of my recollection, already have, I also didn’t really want), but the rarity of the tapes themselves still kept my interest level higher than it might otherwise have been. Eventually the lot sold to someone not named me, but I wasn’t too disappointed – after all, I still had this tape in my arsenal.\n\nI’m just surmisin’ here, but as with other VHS tapes that still hold some value in this day and age, I imagine the horror and sci-fi HHT releases tend to garner the most attention. At least they do in my case. As such, when this “Aztec Mummy Double Feature” release popped up for really cheap, and I had never seen it before (or since), I jumped on it. Funny thing was, I never even had much interest in these films prior, but cornball old horror movies on rare VHS releases for really good prices, hey, that’s always gonna get my attention. In this case, I didn’t even hesitate when it came to hitting the “spend money on this” button. I probably should learn to hesitate more when it comes to that button, but this time around, I’m glad I didn’t!\n\nPresented via an annoyingly uncentered sticker on the front sleeve, the movies that make up our double feature are The Curse of the Aztec Mummy and The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy, which are actually movies #2 and #3 of a late 1950s horror trilogy from Mexico. Beginning with 1957’s The Aztec Mummy, these were all filmed back-to-back-to-back. While that first film seemed to ultimately get some kind of butchered release in the U.S., the second and third parts were imported here in the early-60s by K. Gordon Murray, who specialized in this sort of thing, and it’s those Murray products we have here. (It appears Murray never tackled the first installment.)\n\nThere was also a 1960s effort titled The Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy, but near as I can tell, it’s not actually part of this series.\n\nFor my part, I tend to run hot and cold on these K. Gordon Murray imports. My interest in this sort of thing was higher in my early, early horror & sci-fi fandom (when I was around 11, 12 years old) but has since eroded precipitously. For example, I’ve never much cared for the bizarre 1959 Santa Claus he brought here (instead, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians has traditionally been my silly Christmas movie of choice), but his World of the Vampires was something that peaked my interest back then but doesn’t really now. (A revisit probably is in order, however.)\n\nOn the other hand, I saw The Brainiac for the first time a little over 10 years ago, and quite unexpectedly on my part, absolutely loved it. As such, I was hoping the two movies on this tape would fall more towards that end of this particular spectrum. Did they? Read on!\n\nActually, before we get to that, let’s take a quick look at the back of this sleeve. I didn’t really intend on including this, because these HHT sleeves are mostly generic from release to release. (I say mostly, because while you’d think they’re all uniform aside from the sticker on the front, the appropriate titles are printed on the sides. So why the sticker at all? A savings in cost is my best guess.)\n\nAnyway, generic sleeves weren’t really uncommon in the early days of home video, especially where the backs were concerned. A good part of the time, these included a standard pitch (like what you’re seeing here) or a listing of other releases, some copyright info, and little else. It took a bit for manufacturers to realize, hey, we could be utilizing the back sleeves to, you know, really sell the movie proper.\n\nAlso, I just noticed it’s spelled “theater” on the back here, but “theatre” everywhere else. This discrepancy mildly disconcerts me, especially since I’m going against my every natural instinct and going with the “theatre” spelling in this article. It feels wrong. It feels dirty.\n\nOh alright, I’m gonna come clean: the real reason I’m bothering with the back of the sleeve is the old Blockbuster sticker still affixed to it. Forget the era the sticker alone evokes; I’m just amazed a tape of this nature could survive at a Blockbuster as late as May 24, 1994! Want an added bit of age-related depression? As of this writing, we’re coming up on the 30th anniversary of that date. No, that doesn’t make me feel good either. I think we need to wrap ourselves in some nonsensical silliness now.\n\nI was passingly familiar with The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy beforehand (more on that aspect momentarily), but The Curse of the Aztec Mummy was the more new-to-me flick here. Online reviews made it sound like it would be sufficiently goofy for me – and it was.\n\n(WARNING: some spoilers are ahead, as if anyone cares.)\n\nThe plot evidently picks up immediately after the first entry, which is odd since it seems that flick, in a butchered English translation at least, hadn’t even been released in the U.S. yet. A flashback at one point fills that part in: previously one Dr. Almada hypnotized his fiancée Flor in order to recall her past life as an Aztec maiden (a plot element obviously inspired by the Bridey Murphy craze of the 1950s; U.S. filmgoers had already gotten homegrown cinematic efforts in the horror vein with fare such as The She-Creature and The Undead, flicks that dealt with past life regression or some gobbledygook like that). It seems that the former-Flor had defied Aztec law and fallen in love with a warrior, which resulted in her being put to death and the warrior being given an eternal sentence as undead guard of an Aztec breastplate and bracelet. (That’s our titular mummy!)\n\nApparently the first Aztec Mummy was a big fat rip-off of Universal’s 1932 The Mummy, with the Egyptians being replaced by the Aztecs. Wanna know a secret? Despite being a classic horror and sci-fi lover, I’ve never much cared for the Universal Mummy films. Even the highly-regarded original has never been of much interest to me. I recall kinda enjoying one of the later b-movie entries in the series, but without doing a bit of (admittedly minimal) legwork, I couldn’t even tell you offhand which one that was. I guess I could go look, but that seems like an awful lot of trouble for an article only 7 people will ever actually read.\n\nAnyway, as Curse opens, villain of the first film Dr. Krupp (alias “The Bat” for some reason) is in police custody (his interrogation seems almost entirely too informal and nonchalant, but then, I’ve been watching a lot of Miami Vice lately so maybe my perception is just skewed. I do wish Tubbs was here to yell at him, though). Krupp is, in almost comically short-order, rescued by his underlings, and seemingly undeterred by the events of the first film, continues on his quest to retrieve the breastplate and bracelet. It seems deciphering the hieroglyphics on them will lead to an ancient Aztec treasure. I guess the probability of making an undead mummy with superhuman strength really, really mad by doing this isn’t something he considers a big issue.\n\nThis may all sound like pretty standard cheapie horror flick material, but what drives Curse is just how unrelentingly nutty it is. This is some cheap, goofy stuff, and I consider that most definitely a good thing. For instance, as Krupp’s gang is breaking him out of police custody (the cops shake clearly non-firing machine guns at them while sound effects tell us, yes, they are indeed firing bullets and how dare you think otherwise), who should arrive to attempt saving the day? A masked superhero called “The Angel.” Think of a lucha libre, though I’m not sure he’s technically a wrestler. Nevertheless, the scene with Angel matter-of-factly driving down the road to intercept the baddies is wonderful, and his ineffectiveness at doing so gives me some real Prince of Space vibes. Angel is pretty useless for the most part, but his random presence gives this movie just the over-the-top factor it needs.\n\nSome of the prevailing nuttiness of Curse is there naturally, while some of it is a result of the insipid dubbing. For example: Angel is promptly overpowered by henchmen, and while he’s on the ground unconscious, Krupp stops one of his underlings from shooting Angel dead. Krupp then clarifies that he wants Angel dead, but he wants to kill him in his own special way. They then leave him on the ground, get in the car and drive away! Ignoring the fact the baddies just gunned down a bunch of cops without hesitation or remorse, what really confuses me about this scene is that Angel’s head looks like it’s positioned under the tire of the getaway car, but Krupp’s gang hesitates just long enough to allow him to move it to the side before they drive away. This whole moment is handled so, I don’t know, lackadaisically I guess, that I honestly can’t figure out if squishing Angel’s head was Krupp’s special way of offing him, or if that’s just where the actor was and someone off camera told him to move so the car can split.\n\nA lot of the goofiness is strictly dialogue-based, however. Certainly this is purely a fault on the part of the dubbing, but that doesn’t mean I don’t love it. When Angel randomly shows up at the home of Dr. Almada, his sudden appearance is treated with less shock than you might expect a masked stranger to elicit. Angel then refuses to explain why he’s wearing a mask because it’ll take too long, then just moments later explains he wears it to make his crime fighting job easier. (It neither takes too long to explain nor even really needs explanation.) During that same scene, after Angel explains how Krupp escaped by gunning down cops, Flor states “what a ruthless thing to do” in a tone that doesn’t at all capture what a ruthless thing it was to do.\n\nDialogue dumbness doesn’t end there, either. Speech is redundant or nonsensical time and time again, and while we’re at it, I noticed the voice given to Krupp doesn’t fit the villainousness of the character; he actually sounds sorta kind and compassionate!\n\nAlso, Angel is eventually revealed to be Almada’s wimpy, bespectacled assistant. It’s something you can see coming a mile away, but it gives the film an additional, mild Superman vibe. Just, you know, minus the whole genuinely heroic thing.\n\nThe Aztec Mummy himself (itself?) doesn’t actually figure into the plot all that much until the film is nearly over, though at only a little over an hour long it’s not like it takes all that long to get there. Basically the breastplate and bracelet are stolen, mums wakes up, heads to Krupp’s hideout, does some pummelin’, retrieves the items, and leaves. Alright then, thanks for stoppin’ by!\n\nI genuinely enjoyed this movie! It’s so fast-paced, goofy and at times outright stupid that you can’t help but love it. Plus, its brevity is an attribute, not a detriment. So does it indeed fall towards the Brainiac end of the silly Mexican horror spectrum for me? Yes, and in fact, I may like it more! As far as this tape goes, The Curse of the Aztec Mummy is worth the price of admission alone. Well, as long as said price is pretty cheap, like it was for me.\n\nOkay, time for the second feature…OH HEY, WAIT!\n\nLookit that! In between the movies, HHT actually included the old Let’s All go to the Lobby snipe, plus intermission and feature presentation cards! I sure wasn’t expecting that! It’s a small thing, but it sure adds to the whole “double feature” aspect of the tape! I would have expected something quirky like this on a release from the 1990s, but for one as old as 1980, it’s definitely a pleasant surprise!\n\nAnd that brings us to movie #2: The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy. As I said before, I’ve had a passing familiarity with this movie, but until this tape, it wasn’t something I had actually watched. Besides this VHS, I own it twice-over, as part of the Grampa series (because of course), and as a longtime MSTie, I have that particular Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode on its respective DVD set. The Grampa tape is a later release so his intro/outro isn’t even on it, and the MST3K episode, that’s a first season installment, one I’ve heard isn’t particularly great even by the standards of that year, so I never even bothered firing it up. Add to that the movie’s reputation as dull and littered with flashbacks to the previous two entries, and yeah, I wasn’t exactly chomping at the bit to dig into this one beforehand, not until I had fun with Curse anyway.\n\n(WARNING: some more spoilers coming, like it matters.)\n\nDespite being filmed immediately after the movie we just saw, and in stark contrast to that flick’s plot, Robot doesn’t take place right where Curse left off. Instead, it picks up five years after the events of the preceding film. I’m not sure I like that, but it’s not like I had much say in the matter.\n\nOne thing’s for sure: it’s definitely loaded with flashbacks, including lengthy ones from the first film in the series. In the context of this tape, that works, and really, even in the context of the time in which this was first released here, it’s appropriate, since as previously stated that first movie hadn’t properly hit the U.S. yet. It’s kind of a drag seeing things we had already seen flashbacked to an hour or so before, and even more of a drag seeing flashbacks to the movie we had just watched, but it is what it is. And, there are large portions from the first movie seen here that we didn’t see in Curse, which helps flesh out the overall story somewhat. It’s here that we first see the mummy repelled by the sight of a Crucifix, Dracula-style, and while it’s not something touched on again (not in these English translations at least), it’s something that pleased this good Cat’lic boy.\n\nAfter getting the preliminary flashbacks out of the way, the film then starts flashing back to (presumably) new footage to set up the main story, and actually, now that I think about it, much of the movie is one big flashback, being related to friends of Almada and his now-wife Flor. (Nice continuity!)\n\nIt seems Krupp escaped his apparent death at the end of the last film, and for the past five years has been working on his ultimate plan to defeat the mummy, retrieve the artifacts and get his precious, precious treasure. By hypnotizing Flor, Krupp is able to find out where the stupid mummy is now located, and with that knowledge in hand, his scheme is revealed: he’s built a remote controlled, atomic powered robot! When the breastplate and bracelet are retrieved and the mummy predictably wakes up to deliver a beat down, said robot should be able to withstand the assault and instead defeat the mummy once and for all.\n\nAnd what a robot! This thing is a boxy, stereotypical 1950s bot, beyond cheap looking and impossible to take seriously. Inside its helmet is a real person’s face, assumed to be a corpse Krupp stole, and decked out with lightbulbs, the thing is just plain goofy.\n\nBut you know, when the climatic-yet-brief fight finally occurs, it does seem that the robot has the upper hand; it withstands every attack from the mummy. Like the last film, the mummy doesn’t really factor into things (barring flashbacks) until the end here. It does seem like he/it/whatever might lose the battle, though since it’s an eternal, supernatural mummy, maybe the fight would just go on and on and on in a repetitively endless draw or something. But when our protagonists arrive and shoot the remote control out of Krupp’s hands, the mummy makes quick work of the thing, shaking it apart like a bunch of tin cans. It’s both funny looking and highly anticlimactic.\n\nI have less to say about Robot than I did Curse, because Robot just isn’t as much stupid fun. The titular bout is wacky enough, but the first half or so (it’s not like I timed it) of the film is mainly recounting the previous entries, and even when the new story proper gets rolling, it’s not as entertainingly stupid as the last movie. Even the dubbed dialogue takes awhile to get funny. The movie starts promisingly enough, with an introductory narration that promises the events to be notarized as true (yeah, okay) but then immediately contradicts itself by claiming the film is a work of both fact and fiction (which may hold some truth; the Aztecs apparently did have their own mummies, though I’m not sure how close they looked to the cinematic representation here, and at any rate I’m fairly certain none of them ever came back to life to fight crime), but until the end of the movie, things just never live up to that silly goose hype.\n\nFurthermore, Almada’s assistant is back, but The Angel doesn’t make a reappearance, not even in the flashbacks (at least not masked and in action). Krupp does obliquely reference The Angel once, but if you hadn’t seen Curse first, you’d be none the wiser. That’s a let down, and takes away a lot of inherent goofiness, something Robot has but needs more of. A LOT more of. It’s just not as entertaining as Aztec Mummy #2.\n\nI did really like the cheap-but-endearing cemetery and laboratory sets, however.\n\nSo that’s Hollywood Home Theatre’s Aztec Mummy two-fer. The second half of the double feature may not live up to the first, but you know, as a whole this release is still a lot of fun. Certainly it’s an early example of home video; the sleeve is mostly bare bones and the prints utilized aren’t exactly pristine (Robot looks a bit better than Curse, but not by much. That said, both are entirely watchable). Nevertheless, the movies are just wacky enough to recall the drive-in double features of yesteryear, something that is only reinforced by the intermission segment. If that’s what HHT was seeking to achieve, I dare say they succeeded!\n\nIs this the most sought-after release on the label? I’m almost positive that it isn’t. There’s at least one Godzilla entry in their oeuvre, and I’d imagine that is worth some mega bucks to ‘Zilla/VHS collectors. Nevertheless, I’d think there’s some inherent value to anything vintage horror and/or sci-fi on the label, but even if there isn’t, I’d still say this is a cool way to visit, or revisit, these flicks. Provided you can find the tape in the first place, that is!\n\nSometimes, these posts take months to actually make happen. Case in point: today’s subject is something I referenced in the intro of this post; yes indeed, I originally wanted to write about this one this past November! Obviously that didn’t happen. But hey, better late than never, especially with this subject, cause it’s a legit goody. Brace yourselves gang, cause we’re taking another trip into the world of public domain Dick Tracy entertainment!\n\nNo jive, this one’s been on my writin’-radar for awhile now. This ultimately stems from nostalgia related to the big time 1990 Warren Beatty film adaptation, which as I’ve related more than once, hit me hard upon release, but even disregarding that, the Dick Tracy films of the 1940s are just right up my alley nowadays. These RKO productions were strictly “B” movies, but ones that went down the film noir route, while also, needless to say, taking inspiration from the Chester Gould comic strips this all originally springs from. In other words, they’re irresistible.\n\n‘Course, the last time we looked at one of these, it was ostensibly considered one of the worst films ever – in some circles, anyway. (My conclusion? It wasn’t, not by a longshot.) But today, we’re looking at what I presume is generally considered one of the better entries, based solely on one big, big factor: Boris Karloff!\n\nThat’s right, it’s 1947’s Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome, by way of budget video manufacturer of yesteryear, Trans-Atlantic Video. And even better, it’s dated 1990, which means it was a release quite likely piggybacking on the hype of the aforementioned Milton Armitage Warren Beatty movie! Neato!\n\nA coupla things before we look at the movie proper:\n\nFirst, obviously, this is our cover here, and I love it! The “movie favorites” banner is not only a sure sign of Trans-Atlantic Video, but also of the kind of ballyhoo that was commonly seen on budget videos of the time. Hey, back then, you did what you could to sell this stuff to a public hungry to add to their burgeoning video libraries. (Remember, home video as something the general public could partake in was still relatively new, and the idea that tapes could be affordable enough to own outright, rather than simply renting, was even newer.) But even better than that is the usage of the original poster art, because man, that artwork is just fantastic! It’s 1940s in all the best ways, with the horrific visage of Karloff looming over top of it all nothing short of fantastic.\n\nSecondly, and speaking of Karloff, take note that he receives top billing over Ralph Byrd’s Dick Tracy. You want another, admittedly more tenuous connection to 1990’s Dick Tracy? Here you go: that 1990 flick was intended to ape the hype and subsequent summertime success surrounding 1989’s Batman, in which Jack Nicholson’s Joker was famously (infamously?) billed over Michael Keaton’s titular character. Am I grasping at straws with this line of thinking? Well sure I am!\n\nThird, but perhaps but most importantly, this is the 40s Tracy flick I go back furthest with. Y’see, a few years after that 1990 Dick Tracy came and went (I’m estimating 1993 or thereabouts), mom took my brother and I to Toys-R-Us, and on a clearance table were some budget VHS tapes of these RKO Tracy films. Not from this label, but nevertheless, there they were. In hindsight, I’d hypothesize they were leftovers from that 1990 push, but that could be all sorts of wrong. At any rate, my brother got Dick Tracy’s Dilemma and I got Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome. Being little kids, and in my case one who hadn’t quite fostered a true love of classic cinema just yet, these were more for a fondness of the character than things we’d endlessly watch (we didn’t), though as the years went by this turned out to be a wise purchase on ma’s part. (I still have both of those tapes to this day.) Come to think of it, this was my first true exposure to Boris Karloff, too!\n\nFinally, I’m not going to bother posting a pic of the back of the VHS sleeve, mainly because I have little to say about it, but before we head into the movie, I just want to point out that officially, the manufacturer of this tape is listed as “ATI Mark V Productions Inc./TAV.” The TAV is clearly Trans-Atlantic Video, but I’m not familiar with the rest of that. Unlike earlier TAV vids, there’s an actual synopsis on the back (as opposed to a one-line summary with promotions for other TAV products filling out most of the space), so maybe Mark V was responsible for that, I don’t now. Anyway, for the sake of (relative) brevity, I’m just going to keep calling this a TAV release.\n\nAlright then, 1947’s Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome. This was actually the fourth and final RKO Tracy film. Because of the Karloff konnection, it’s also probably the most famous, or at least the biggest chaser for classic movie lovers. Is it the best of the series? I’ll leave that up to your individual tastes, but I’m gonna tell you up front: I think this movie is terrific! The low budget film noir elements coupled with the comic strip roots and even some science fiction aspects, not to mention a breezy 65 minute runtime, it all combines to make this one a lot of fun.\n\nKarloff is Gruesome, who as the story opens is fresh outta prison and immediately ready to dive back into a life of crime. Thanks to a connection with an old crony named Melody, Gruesome quickly gets in league with some baddies who are in possession of gas bombs that temporarily paralyze anyone who inhales their contents. This leads to a daylight bank robbery where everyone inside said bank are frozen (except Tracy’s girlfriend Tess Truehart; she was in a phone booth) and money is taken with ease. Nevertheless, during their escape, a cop is shot dead outside. Needless to say, super sleuth Tracy is now on the case.\n\nKarloff lends a legitimate horror film presence to the proceedings, though the film, in addition to being a noirish crime thriller, is more science fiction than horror, mainly when the people in the bank are frozen in place. Granted, it’s light sci-fi, but the elements are still there. (The frozen people thing comes off a little goofy, but harmless enough, and still less goofy than the space age Dick Tracy comic strips sound. I haven’t read any of those, but I’m not sure I want to!)\n\nAnd, it’s easy to see why Karloff received top billing; besides being (I imagine) a bigger name draw, he dominates this film in a way that Byrd’s Tracy just doesn’t. It goes without saying Boris is excellent in the role, and I was impressed with the way his character progresses during such a short running time; as I watched, I was first prepared to say Karloff’s Gruesome was, in comparison, a more sympathetic character than Cueball, who we/I saw last time around. Certainly Gruesome is tough and violent and no-nonsense, but earlier in the film at least, he seems more greedy than anything, even decrying the shooting of the police officer, which he deems unnecessary. But then, as the film goes on, he becomes more ruthless, displaying traits that really live up to his moniker. Some of this is in the writing, but I dare say it’s Karloff’s performance that truly makes this progression work.\n\nWith such a brief running time and low budget, it’s naturally not a perfect film; Byrd’s Tracy receives plenty of screentime but still never seems like the main focus, as you would expect of a, you know, Dick Tracy film. (Maybe that Nicholson/Keaton comparison earlier was apt after all?) Furthermore, a plot point involving Dr. A. Tomic is never fleshed out as much as I would have liked, with his assistant I.M. Learned (gotta love those names!) becoming more of a focus as the film goes on.\n\nThose are small complaints though, because this movie is just, so, so entertaining as it is. It’s got that late-40s, post war matinee movie sheen that you just can’t not love. High art? Well, no, but something tells me it was never intended to be. Much of the movie is bathed in shadows, as you would expect of a b-noir, but with enough comic strip origin elements to keep it from becoming too dark (more figuratively than literally, I mean.)\n\nFunny self-referential moment: earlier in the film, a character declares that if he didn’t know better, he’d think they were dealing with Boris Karloff! Nicely played, RKO!\n\n(TAV utilized a fairly decent print of the movie for this tape. It’s by no means pristine, but consistently watchable throughout.)\n\nOh hey, at the very end of the movie, the ending card was faded out just early enough for TAV to fade into this screen as the closing music was still playing: a little advertisement for their other [general] offerings! Usually I’d prefer that a company do that once the movie has finished in its entirety, but I don’t know, it just didn’t bother me that much this time around. Probably because it’s such a simple-but-fun reminder of the era this tape originally hails from.\n\nSo anyway, Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome, this isn’t a hard movie to seek out in the slightest; it has long been delightfully public domain, which means it’s readily available in any number of formats. DVDs? Absolutely. VHS? If that’s your preference, there’s numerous choices out there (this TAV issue was but one of many), and hey, you could even watch it free an’ legal online if that’s your thing. No joshin’, this one gets a big recommendation from yours truly.\n\n‘Course, if you’re like me and grew up with all the hype surrounding the 1990 Dick Tracy, there’s something kinda neat about watching a release that was in all likelihood attempting to capture some of said hype (and I lived through it; it wasn’t a small push by any means). But even without that aspect, it’s fun to just go back and watch it the way our home video ancestors did. (Wait, if I lived through the era, can I really say “our ancestors” here? Doesn’t that make me my own ancestor? Aw now I’m confusing myself…)\n\nIt’s time for a little rectifyin’. Longtime readers may recall my 2016 review of Pop Flix’s 2-disc, 8-movie Bela Lugosi DVD set. To this day, it’s still my favorite budget DVD release of Lugosi’s poverty row (and subsequently public domain) movies. Have there been more comprehensive collections released? Well, yeah. And yet, the concise all-killer, no-filler line-up of films and clean, attractive presentation of them in Pop Flix’s offering continues to overwhelmingly appeal to yours truly, over 6 years later. I even gifted a copy to my cousin last Christmas, such was and is my continuing fondness for the set.\n\nWhile my love of the collection hasn’t changed, my list of personal favorites contained within it has – somewhat. The Devil Bat and The Corpse Vanishes continue to reside in the upper echelon of Lugosi flicks in my mind, whereas The Ape Man, which I raved about back in ’16, has fallen in stature precipitously. And Bowery at Midnight, which was the big surprise of the set for me, frankly, that has grown to become what just may be my all-time favorite Bela movie, poverty row or otherwise.\n\nIf you go back and read that article, you’ll note that I was somewhat lukewarm on 1941’s Invisible Ghost. In fact, my conclusion back then was: “…this, for me, is one of the weaker entries, though that’s really only relatively speaking; this is still a good one, but it’s a bit overshadowed by some of the other flicks here, in my eyes.”\n\nYeah, that opinion has changed quite a bit in the intervening years as well. I didn’t intentionally set out to change my earlier viewpoint, but regular watches in the time since has resulted in Invisible Ghost steadily growing to ultimately become what is very likely a top 3’er in my Bela favorites (The Devil Bat and Bowery at Midnight being the other two).\n\nAs such, rather than going back and modifying the original review, which is something I really, really didn’t feel like, a full-fledged update seemed to be in order. But by what vehicle? Should I bust out the Pop Flix DVD and (re-)review just that movie? Nah, too easy. Or maybe the movie as presented by The Ghoul back in 2000? (I briefly mentioned that episode and the thought of reviewing it in that 2016 article, after all.) Nah, too much work. Do I try to snag a cheap copy of the appropriate entry in GoldStar Video’s Tales of Horror VHS series, which I like to babble about? Actually, I tried, but there were 0 copies available online that I could see.\n\nSo you know what that means? Yes indeed, it’s Grampa Al Lewis time once again!\n\nHey, it’s October, Halloween month, and as I write this, it’s cold and overcast and rainy out, so the setting is right. Plus, I’m pretty sure these Amvest/Grampa VHS articles get more continuing views than anything else I write about, so might as well!\n\nIt’s true: Invisible Ghost was released as part of Amvest Video’s 1988 “Grampa Presents” VHS series. I’ve written about these plenty (here’s the latest – from last October); they are, bar none, my favorite budget video releases, of yesterday or today. So if I’m going to revisit Invisible Ghost and give it its proper props, this is the correct way to go about it. I mean, maybe not from a non-obsolete technology or picture quality standpoint, but…\n\nGet them synapses fired up and you’ll realize this is the respective VHS cover right here. The artist’s rendition of one of the more-famous images from the film is perfectly respectable, and while I’m not a big fan of how the movie title itself was rendered (it looks hairy, like it would be better suited for a werewolf movie or sumpin’), the artwork is nice and colorful and it’s overseen by the “Grampa Presents” banner at the very top, which puts it above many, many other budget tapes from the era. Heck, it puts it above other tapes in the very same series!\n\nOddly, not every Grampa tape used the motif, but these tapes were supposed to have that banner, along with a “Grampa’s Ratings” feature on the back. I don’t really have anything much to say about the reverse of the sleeve, but Grampa did rank this one two bats and remarked “a deadly obsession” there, which doesn’t really tell anyone anything, but at least it’s present. (I have my doubts Al Lewis himself actually sat down to rate and write these – but I sure like to imagine he did.)\n\nI’ve written about these Grampa tapes so many times by now that there’s little I can say about them that wouldn’t be massively repeating myself. Follow the link I gave you before and go from there if you want to know more. Or hit the search button; that works too, I guess.\n\nPut shortly, movies in this series were hosted by Al Lewis, doing his Grandpa Munster shtick without being called Munster; here he’s simply “Grampa.” Accompanied by a green (blue?) screen, old horror movie clips, computer-animated special effects, neon squiggles, and an off-screen Igor that you may or may not hear, Lewis does his tried-and-true “I’m an old vampire” routine.\n\nThe intros and outros for these tapes were always the same, and despite the late-80s budget video trappings, they’re a lot of fun. The intro was more for setting up the premise and announcing the movie (which was supposed to be announced by the unseen Igor, though a good part of the time they didn’t even bother including it; such was the case here) while the outro focused mainly on the titles available in the series and how you could go about getting them. Same every time or not, these host segments add so much to these tapes; not only are they a unique touch in the world of budget home video from that time, but they recall the television horror hosts that were an endangered species even then. If you’re gonna watch a cheap VHS release of a public domain movie, there were (are) far, FAR worse ways to go about it.\n\nSo that’s the background to the main reason for this article: giving Invisible Ghost its deserved due. Things go better with Grampa, but our real focus today is the movie, so let’s get to that now.\n\nInvisible Ghost was released in 1941, the first of ultimately 9 movies Bela Lugosi did for poverty row outfit Monogram Pictures. From my understanding, it’s often considered the best of the bunch, and while I’m not sure I completely agree with that, it’s definitely a good’un. As The Ghoul used to occasionally say, “it’s a dandy!”\n\nOur plot: Lugosi plays one Charles Kessler, a man of considerable wealth and power (though unless I’ve just totally missed them over and over, specifics as to how/why are never given; dude’s mad rich, okay?). Some years prior to the start of the film, Kessler’s wife cheated on him with his best friend, they reconciled, but then apparently ran off with said friend anyway, something that left Kessler devastated. As the movie begins, Kessler is seen having dinner and talking with “his wife,” who of course isn’t actually there. Evidently this is something he does each year on their wedding anniversary, though he’s (seemingly) normal otherwise. In fact, he’s overwhelmingly caring and kind.\n\nUnbeknownst to Kessler though, his wife is still around. The night she ran off, there was a car wreck, and while the best friend died, she survived, and she’s been squirreled away nearby by Kessler’s gardener. Wifey is in a perpetually dazed, amnesic state, so she’s being kept hidden until she’s “better.”\n\nShe gets out sometimes though, and when Kessler spots her standing outside of his window, he’s goes into a homicidal trance, in which he simply has to strangle someone with his robe. That’s right, prior to the start of the film, there’s been multiple unsolved murders amongst the staff of the Kessler home (an exact number is never given, but it’s noted as “a lot”). No one knows it’s Kessler – not even Kessler himself!\n\nThis may all sound farfetched, but suspension of belief is often required with these 1930s/1940s horror cheapies, so nothing too out of the ordinary there. But what drives Invisible Ghost and makes it so much fun is just how nutty it is. No one in this movie ever behaves in a logical manner, it never plays out how you think it should, even by wartime poverty row standards. And because of that, it’s an absolute blast to watch. Some of the notable aspects that’ll have you simultaneously scratching your head and getting a total kick out of the proceedings (CAUTION: some spoilers are coming!):\n\nOkay, so multiple people have been murdered in the Kessler home over an unspecified number of years, most or all of them apparently being servile employees. And yet, suspicion never falls on Kessler or his daughter or, really, anyone else in the house that hasn’t been offed yet? Did the cops think some rando is just occasionally stopping by and doing this, and leaving it at that?\n\nKessler is rich and powerful, so it’s no stretch to imagine these murders are newsworthy; we’re talking front page kinda stuff here. In fact, late in the film it’s implied they have made the papers. So how exactly are they still finding employees? A high probability of being murdered isn’t exactly a perk, no matter how tough the job market in the area may or may not be. (Speaking of that late film moment, it’s during a conversation with the new cook, who mentions she doesn’t read the papers. So how’d she find out about the job? Does Kessler put up a “help wanted” sign in his window? And if it was by word of mouth, newspapers or no, wouldn’t the reputation of the house precede it?)\n\nWhy not move out of the house? This is explained away as “sentimental reasons,” cause, wife. Okay, fine, I’ll buy that, but why keep hiring staff if there’s the strong possibility they’ll be killed? Kessler (when he’s not in nutso mode) is seen to be kind and compassionate, so wouldn’t he, you know, want to keep people as safe as possible until the murderer is apprehended? Can’t he make his own dinner for awhile?\n\nAre we really supposed to believe the gardener has hidden Kessler’s wife away for several years? And while I can kinda sorta understand his rationale for keeping her hidden (it’d crush Kessler), she’s obviously damaged mentally – is hiding her away until she “gets better” really the best course of medical action? And after a number of years without getting “better,” shouldn’t he try to find a doctor, at least on the sly? I mean, the gardener is clearly no Einstein, but this is still incredibly stupid. And by the way, he doesn’t want to bring Kessler’s wife to him cause it’d hurt Kessler? Dude, the guy is having a yearly dinner conversation with an empty chair!\n\nKessler has a daughter, Virginia, who has a quasi-fiancée, Ralph. Ralph evidently had some sort of relationship with Kessler’s new maid, Cecile. Cecile still carries a torch for Ralph, even though Ralph says it’s over. Ralph is overheard telling her she’s not going to stand in the way of his happiness, so when Cecile is murdered by Kessler, Ralph is convicted on that slimmest of circumstantial evidence – and executed!\n\nIn the very next scene, Ralph’s identical twin brother Paul shows up at the house! Say what?! He couldn’t get there in time for the trial/execution, but he wants to help solve the murders, so he’s quickly given a room! Paul never really does that much, making you wonder why they’d even bother with the whole twins thing in the first place. And speaking of, Paul never seems too upset his brother was executed for a murder he presumably didn’t commit. In fact, except for a moment when Kessler is afraid the new cook has been murdered, none of the main characters ever seem too concerned/upset when a new murder has been committed. Even the cop in charge of the investigation seems more annoyed with it than anything.\n\nAt one point the idiot gardener gets offed by Kessler – except that he doesn’t, except that he does. Y’see, Kessler strangles him during one of his trances, the body is found, and eventually taken to the coroner. When the gardener’s wife shows up to see the body (she seems upset, even though she’s not really a main character), she discovers that he’s still alive! He dies for good soon thereafter, but it’s such an odd, odd moment. First off, the wife screams in terror rather than being overjoyed he’s alive. But also, I mean, the guy’s heart was still beating, yet missed by the cops, coroner et al., for seemingly hours (Jack Klugman would have never stood for that – and as the story goes, he didn’t). And not just that, but is this really a believable outcome of strangulation? The guy was hurt bad enough to be unconscious for a relatively lengthy period of time, only to randomly regain consciousness momentarily before completely dying? I can see something like that happening as the result of a head injury or whatever, but having the air choked out of you?\n\nLate in the film, when it’s suspected the butler is the culprit, Paul insists he be tested to see if he’s insane before being arrested. Ignoring that the test is hilariously simple, it’s a nice thought, especially since the evidence, while still circumstantial, is much stronger than what got Ralph executed.\n\nNot really a strange moment, but Bela’s declaration of “apple pie? My, that will be a treat” at one point is pretty hilarious.\n\nKessler’s wife seems to have a strange psychic connection with Kessler. He seems to magically know whenever she’s standing outside the window, and at the climax when he’s in mid-strangle (this time with observers), she suddenly drops dead, which then immediately releases her mental hold on Kessler. This ‘connection’ is never explained. So we have to surmise that his love for her was so strong that he just ‘knew’, I guess?\n\nIf it seems like I’m picking the film apart just for the sake of being snarky, trust me, I’m not. Invisible Ghost is so much fun simply because it’s so loopy. Forget suspension of belief, just throw your ideas of logic right out the window from the start. No one behaves logically in this film, so just sit back, accept that from the word go, and hold on for the ride!\n\nSome positive positives: they’re somewhat obscured in the dupey, worn print Amvest utilized, but the usage of shadows and evocative camera angles in Invisible Ghost is truly impressive. It’s all relative, but this movie is more atmospheric and artistic than it really has any right to be. (Kino’s terrific 2017 Blu-ray release shows all this much better, though it seems to be out of print now, which is a shame, because it’s amazing to realize the film could look as terrific as it does there.)\n\nAlso, the butler Evans is played by African-American Charles Muse, and far from a jokey Mantan Moreland-like character, Muse plays the role with dignity and intelligence. Considering the time period this was released, this is both amazing and refreshing. Muse is excellent.\n\n(Speaking of acting, as always, Lugosi is terrific.)\n\nI can’t recommend Invisible Ghost highly enough. At only a little over an hour, it naturally moves fast, and its complete lack of predictable behavior is an asset, not a detriment. It’s breezy, cheap, wartime poverty row horror, and it’s irresistible.\n\nOf course, in this case, things finish up with Grampa, which is just the icing on the cake. Again, like a television horror host, it’s an appropriate (and fun!) way to wind up the presentation.\n\nLike the intro, I can only say so much about the outro that I haven’t said before. A list of available titles are given, a way to order them is shown, Lewis makes corny jokes, the end.\n\nAlthough, despite having seen this stuff so many times prior, something humorous that struck me this time around (and which I can’t really recall taking stock of before) is Lewis’ reactions to the appearance of the “Casket of Horrors” (supposedly a display found in video stores, it was meant to house this Amvest video series, though how many, IF any, made it out there is up for question). His reactions go from shocked and confused to accepting of the sudden appearance of the display, which I found kinda funny.\n\nBy the way, the blank space between the end of the movie and the start of the outro is considerable – so much so that I initially thought Amvest accidentally left the outro off entirely at first. Which isn’t unprecedented; one of my tapes from this series totally left it off, which in retrospect made Lewis’ hype for it in the intro unintentionally funny. But it leads to this question: were they putting these intros/outros on manually each time? The jump in video quality from the host segments (which weren’t exactly HD anyway) to that of the movie (which often looks like a copy of a copy) is usually pretty noticeable. And if you’ll recall my last Amvest post here, where the opening credits of the movie were cut off somewhat, it makes me echo a question I asked last time: how does this even happen?\n\nNo matter, cause the package was ultimately complete here, and all the better for it. But don’t let Al Lewis be the deciding factor; Invisible Ghost can and does stand on its own as a fun, often ridiculous piece of entertainment. As an entry in Bela’s poverty row output, it may not be high art, but it’s irresistible all the same. You can’t not love it! Give it a shot, and if you can do that with Al “Grampa” Lewis in the vicinity, all the better!\n\nOver the last two or three years, I’ve found myself really getting into the classic mystery (read: whodunit) films. Not that I had never watched them before or didn’t have any in my collection; I had and I did. But as you may or may not have surmised while looking at my dumb blog, my tastes have traditionally (but not exclusively) leaned towards classic horror & sci-fi. (Well, and b-westerns, too.) The sad fact of the matter is whodunit flicks had been woefully neglected for much of my movie-watchin’ life.\n\nWhile I still love the stuff that has mostly been my bread & butter, as I’ve grown older I’ve also progressively grown to appreciate an absorbing mys’try flick. Charlie Chan, Mr. Wong, Bulldog Drummond, lay ’em on me mama. (Nearly a year ago, we took a look at an old Dick Tracy film, but I tend to think of those movies more as crime thrillers than full-fledged whodunits – though ultimately in the same wheelhouse.)\n\nAnyway, Sherlock Holmes. The name is practically synonymous with “whodunit.” I haven’t read any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s original stories, but I’ve certainly gotten into films based on the character. Well, classic films. Well, the Basil Rathbone series, at least. I have no idea which cinematic version of the character purists consider definitive, but I think it’s safe to say that in the general public consciousness, Rathbone’s rendition is the one that immediately comes to mind. We’re talkin’ iconic here.\n\nAnd that brings us to or subject today.\n\nFour of the films in the Rathbone series have long been delightfully public domain, and while my current probable-favorite in the series (The House of Fear) isn’t one of them, there’s still good stuff to be had. And even more fun is the smorgasbord of budget releases these now-PD entries have enjoyed over the years. And that brings us to our subject today. (Wait, I already said that.)\n\n1942’s Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon is the earliest of the series to go public domain, though luckily in regards to this review, it’s one I hadn’t seen prior.\n\nWacky Fact: I picked up a terrific two-disc DVD set at the dollar store some months back that included all four PD Rathbone flicks, other vintage, presumably-PD Holmes movies, and a load of episodes from the 1950s TV series. I had the ‘movies’ disc loaded up for quite awhile, but as is my wont, aside from a quick looksee, I never got around to actually watching any of it before it got swapped out for something else. Not that I can’t load it back up again when the mood strikes me, of course, and if nothing else, the four Rathbone flicks were more than worth the price of admission alone.\n\nMy unintended hesitation turned out to be fortuitous though, because when this particular home video release turned up for sale online and I duly slammed my meaty paws on the “BUY DIS” button, I got to go into it fresh. Once the tape arrived and I found the time/drive to sit down and watch it, I mean.\n\nAs you can see, we are once again taking a trip into the world of Vintage Video/Amvest VHS. A cursory glance through the contents of this site will quickly show how fond I am of this label. Certainly we’ve looked at their Grampa Al Lewis series multiple times, but our subject today is more in line with one of their ‘regular’ releases, which we’ve also seen before. (In other words, no, Al Lewis doesn’t host Holmes here, though that would have been pretty baller.)\n\nI’m a real sucker for tapes from this manufacturer, even though they (mostly) dealt with the same public domain movies multiple budget outfits during the home video boom of the 1980s dealt with. Certainly this all stems from the aforementioned Grampa series, but there’s also the sometimes-unique cover art, sometimes-interesting prints used, and frankly, the relative-obscurity the releases as a whole share. (They tend to be scarce – maybe one or two copies for every, I don’t know, twenty comparable releases from Goodtimes – though they’re not particularly valuable. This copy here, the first I’d ever seen, was mega cheap – and still sealed, to boot.)\n\n‘Course, you kinda need an affinity for VHS and budget home video and whatnot to appreciate all this (growing up with it all probably helps, too), because technically, this is pretty superfluous to have in the day and age. We’ve got DVD and Blu-ray and innernet streamin’ and all that, and when the movie in question has long been in the public domain, from a practicality standpoint, there’s really no reason to get so stoked over something like this.\n\nExcept that with the right mindset, there is: forget picture quality and bulkiness and ease of use – it’s all about taking a trip back in time here. Are there better ways to watch this movie? Well, yeah. But this here, it’s like holding a piece of a bygone era in home video in your hands – which of course is exactly what is indeed happening. Necessary? Naw. A trip back in time? Well, yeh. (Or so says I, and as we all know, my word is of tantamount importance.)\n\nI like the cover art here; certainly it’s in the 1980s budget video release tradition, but that’s perfect for our purposes today. A good many of these VV/Amvest tapes, at least earlier ones (1985, as opposed to 1988 and beyond) simply used original poster art, usually (but not always) bordered with the VV banner you’re seeing here. There could be some modifications to the original artwork, but for the most part, it was still ultimately, you know, the original poster art. However, the tapes I find especially interesting in this particular arena are the ones that used original, or at least more original, motifs. Such is our case here: sure, they just used stock photos of Rathbone’s Holmes (along with Nigel Bruce’s Dr. Watson), but the watercolor (?) filtering (?) of them coupled with the unique title font (and slightly silly “Who dun-it this time?” tagline) intrigues your pal me. Also, dig the credits at the bottom of the cover, you can’t really read ’em here but they seem to be mimicking those of a ‘big time’ video release, which is something I can’t really recall one of these VV tapes identically doing. Was there some then-recent Sherlock Holmes movie this was piggybacking on?\n\n(Speaking of dates, the one found on the back of the box here was indeed 1985, but in the interest of full disclosure, the label on the tape itself was a newer one akin to what Amvest was using around 1988 or so. Thus, this was undoubtedly a later re-release, but since I don’t have an exact date otherwise, I’m sticking with ’85 here, as you can see in the article title above. Aw, it’s not like it really matters anyway…)\n\nI don’t have much interesting to say about the back of the box, so what say we look at the movie proper now…\n\nUpon firing the tape up, I was treated to this: the credits already in progress, right from the very start. No title card, credits already rolling. Thaaaaaanks. Ah, budget tape tradition! I’m not going to go out of my way to track down another copy to see if they’re all like this (‘course, if I come across another one in-person during my travels…), but this begs the question: how does this even happen? Was it the way their “master tape” (whatever that constituted) was, or were they making copies tape-by-tape and this was a goof they didn’t notice or just didn’t feel like correcting? It’s kinda funny, but also kinda irritating. Then again, this sort of thing wasn’t totally uncommon with budget video releases, and it’s not even the first time I’ve run into the opening/closing parts of whatever being MIA with VV/Amvest. It is what it is.\n\nOur plot: Holmes has been enlisted to protect one Dr. Tobel, who has created a new fancy schmancy bombsight to fight them Nazis with. As a precaution, he separates the bombsight into four pieces and entrusts them to four different scientists. For good measure, he notates who has what, but as a coded message involving “dancing men.” (Said code being the only part of this movie that was based upon an original Doyle story, apparently.)\n\nOf course, rather than following Holmes’ simple directions and staying put, Tobel just has to slip out of protective custody to visit his fiancée (wimmins, amiright?), which promptly and naturally gets him abducted by baddies. The specific baddies in question? Holmes’ arch-nemesis Professor Moriarty and his cohorts, that’s who! Turns out Moriarty is in league with the Nazis; selling them the bombsight would be very lucrative, as you may well imagine. This is undesirable to say the least, so now Holmes must rescue Tobel, recover the four pieces of the bombsight, and thwart Moriarty (and by extension, the Nazis), for the time being at least.\n\nWait, Nazis? Say what?! It’s true; this is a WWII-era Sherlock Holmes adventure! Y’see, 20th Century Fox produced the first two entries in the Rathbone Holmes series, and they were in the natural Victorian setting. But afterwards, Universal picked up the series, turned them into b-movies, and placed them in a then-modern wartime setting. (Supposedly with an explanatory “Sherlock Holmes is timeless” or something along those lines; I haven’t seen that first Universal effort. Secret Weapon here was the second.) It’s pretty unexpected, and really, to be frank, pretty awesome. I mean, it’s Sherlock Holmes, fightin’ Nazis! Unless you’re a purist’s purist, you can’t not love that! I haven’t seen every entry in the Rathbone Holmes series, but I sure hope there’s a scene where he decks Hitler at some point, not unlike that crowd pleasing moment in Zone Troopers. “Did I just engage Adolph in fisticuffs?” “You sure did, my good chap!”\n\nNot gonna lie: this is some good stuff right here. You’ve got Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes, which automatically makes things worthwhile, but then you add a WWII setting and a breezy, b-movie sheen over top of all of it, no jivin’, it’s just irresistible. The movie is more spy-ish than I was first anticipating, with Holmes’ disguising himself and going undercover more than once. And while I’m not sure I’d consider it a full-fledged whodunit (probably the only real sleuthing sleuthing is deciphering the code), it’s got some noirish elements, terrific acting (Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Lionel Atwill as Moriarty? Plus Nigel Bruce’s ever-reliable Watson? Yes, please!), and even some gruesome elements (besides the obvious implications of the Nazis gaining the bombsight, at one point Moriarty attempts to slowly kill Holmes by draining his blood, drop by drop). I ain’t joshin’ you, this is a lot of fun. If you’re a sucker for wartime b-movie action like I am, Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon is a must.\n\nSo, what kind of print did Vintage Video/Amvest/whoever utilize for this release? Their tapes could feature prints ranging from “okay” to “dragged around the parking lot multiple times.” Secret Weapon falls more towards the latter end of that spectrum. While the duplication itself was decent enough I guess, the print they got was, well, it was pretty wasted. It’s probably darker than it was intended to be, and there are a lot of film scratches, dust, dirt, debris, splices, what have you. There are some moments of really heavy wear, and while things seem to calm down somewhat as the film progresses, this probably isn’t the, uh, best the movie has ever looked.\n\nFurthermore, the run time: the back of the box sez 70 minutes, the official run time I’m seeing online is supposedly 68 minutes, but the actual running time here is really about 56 minutes. So unless the missing part of those opening credits ran 11+ minutes (something tells me they didn’t/don’t), it’s a safe assumption this is an edited print. Cut for TV at some point? Really egregious splices? Something else? No idea.\n\nBut you know, none of that really bothers me. Okay, sure, if I’m paying for a big deluxe Blu-ray or something, I’d want the movie to look like Rathbone et al. are performing live right in front of me, inexplicably in grayscale, at that very moment. But this tape as it is, it presents the movie in a way that recalls countless trips through the projector, multiple runs on late night television over the decades, an old timey cinematic feeling, something along those lines. It’s part of the fun (at least in retrospect; it probably wasn’t a blast back then) of collecting these old school budget tapes: you never quite know what you’re going to get. Unlike today, where it seems like the same prints just keep getting shared over and over, copies could really vary from manufacturer to manufacturer back then.\n\nStill, the complete opening credits would have been nice. And speaking of the credits, the final cast credits card is there, but cuts off really quickly, as if whoever couldn’t wait to be done with the whole thing. Of course the meat of the movie (i.e., the important stuff) is all there – such as it is I mean – but yeah, this really exemplifies the mid/late-1980s budget home video release ideal. (Ideal?)\n\nSo there you have it: Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, as presented by Vintage Video slash Amvest back in the 1980s. If you just want to see the movie (and seriously, it has my recommendation), that’s something that can be easily accomplished. Home video releases are numerous, but since it’s public domain, you can watch it free an’ legal online right now if you so desired! Would that be as much fun as taking an unnecessary trip back to the 1980s as I’ve done here? I’ll let you decide that aspect for yourself.\n\nBy the way, this wasn’t the only Rathbone Holmes VV put out: The Woman in Green and Terror by Night also saw releases on the label. (I couldn’t find Dressed to Kill, the last PD Rathbone Holmes as well as the last Rathbone Holmes period, via VV, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there was one of those out there, too.)\n\nOh hey, fun facts up in here: this post was first intended to be just as you’ve seen it now, but then I thought about three separate reviews over three days for the three VV releases, and then I thought about a single post spotlighting the triple bill, and then I considered four reviews over four consecutive days with Congress Video’s 1985 VHS release of Dressed to Kill filling out the fourth, and then as late as yesterday I considered a single post, double bill looking at just Secret Weapon and The Woman in Green, before simply going back to the original plan and giving Secret Weapon the sole spotlight. I enjoyed it so much, it deserves the space to itself.\n\nDid I ultimately make the right decision? Well, we’re just going to have to live with the results, anyway.\n\nHey, what do you know; it’s 2022 now. I’m not really going anywhere with that opening line, though come to think of it, it IS the 30th anniversary of our subject today. Does anybody care? Well of course they…don’t. And yet, here we are, and here we shall remain for the duration of the post. (Unless you exit out early. Please don’t though; my unwarranted ego can’t take it.)\n\nListen up gang, it’s time to revisit another old favorite here on the blog. Back in October, we saw the return of Amvest Video’s Al “Grampa” Lewis VHS series after a several year hiatus on the site, and today we’ve got another one: Goldstar Video’s “Tales of Horror” series, a budget line that spanned 1991 & 1992. I never looked at these tapes as extensively as Grampa’s oeuvre – only twice (here and here) – but rest assured, I’m pretty derned fond of ’em. They may lack touches as overwhelmingly unique as Al Lewis being a mista silly man to intro and outro movies, but from strictly outside appearances, you know, these just scream “early-90s budget videotape.” The volumized numbering aspect, the simple-yet-eye catching artwork (they all share a similar motif of cheesy drippin’ blood and a film strip containing a grainy screenshot from the film; only the finer details of each respective release would change), the fact they couldn’t have possibly cost very much originally, and all hailing from an era when VHS had well and truly become mainstream, no joshin’, it all takes me way back.\n\n(Just ignore the fact that I never owned – or even recall seeing – any of these back in the day. Thas missin’ the point, MAN. They totally evoke a specific era in home video, and that’s what gets me all fired up. Well, that and because they just look cool.)\n\nSo yes, I’m pretty happy to feature the return of these here today. And I’m even happier that the movie featured is, as you can see, the Lon Chaney Jr. opus Indestructible Man. Released in 1956 (though apparently filmed in 1954), this has really become one of my favorite sci-fi offerings from the 50s. And in 1992, Goldstar Video released it as volume #6 in their “Tales of Horror” VHS series. Neato!\n\nActually, my love of this movie is more of a recent thing. Oh I grew up with it alright – it’s just that, for many years, I didn’t really care for it. Its public domain status ensured that it was always seemingly ‘around,’ on TV, home video, what have you. That was all fine and dandy, except that the movie just didn’t do much for me when I first saw it at 11/12 years old. It’s definitively science fiction, but for the most part it doesn’t come off overtly sci-fi, if that makes any sense. It actually plays out more like a film noir (more on that aspect in a bit) than a typical 50s entry in the genre, and way back when, that wasn’t what I was looking for. A few years after my initial viewing, The Ghoul ran the flick in the very episode that I happened to appear in (in the crowd, at a personal appearance; it wasn’t like I set a stool up next to him and co-hosted the movie or anything), and even that momentous occasion wasn’t enough to raise Indestructible Man‘s stature in my eyes.\n\nWhat turned me around and set me on the right path in life? A few years back, during TCM’s annual Halloween marathon, I saw they were running the movie, so I DVR’d it. Not because I was looking to change my opinion on the film; I just wanted to see what kind of print they’d run of what is typically a public domain staple. So it recorded, I fired it up later, merely intending to just check it out a bit and then delete…and instead I ended up staying for the whole thing. I was quickly absorbed, quite unexpectedly on my part, and I’ve loved the movie ever since. (Also, TCM ran the best print of this movie I’ve ever seen. If it wasn’t pristine – which is how I remember it – it was pretty close.)\n\nSubsequently, this Goldstar “Tales of Horror” release became one of my chasers, based solely on how much I ended up enjoying the movie. Not that it’s particularly rare or anything, but still, I was waiting for the right opportunity to nab a copy cheap enough to satisfy my wallet and my posting needs. Needless to say, I was ultimately successful. (I actually bought a sealed copy a few years ago, but I never had the heart to crack the seal.)\n\nHere’s the back of the sleeve. See, Goldstar Video, 1992. Did you think I was lying? I wasn’t. Also, I’ve raised this point before, but I don’t think this Goldstar is related to the GoldStar of electronics fame. Or maybe it is, what do I know. The logo’s different, and while I’m expending my energy to write at an alarming rate and thus don’t feel like doing the legwork right now, I think I probably did some sleuthing for one of my earlier posts and drew the conclusion that they’re different companies then. Or maybe I didn’t, what do I know. Pay attention, this is important stuff.\n\nTo be honest with y’all, the descriptions on the back of these tapes can vary from okay to…sorta awkward. This one is better than it isn’t, and does an okay job of selling the movie. In actuality, Chaney’s character is sentenced to die after being convicted of a big ol’ robbery; presumably some people were killed and that’s why he’s sentenced to death (unless they used to gas people for big ol’ robberies, what do I know), but the summary makes him out to be a serial killer, which he, I assume, wasn’t. (Then again, that nickname…)\n\nAlso, “avenge himself on…” – really? And, that closing line: while this was made in the second-half of Chaney Jr.’s movie career, there’s still a good number of films between this and the ultra-terrible Dracula vs. Frankenstein he finished things up with in 1971. (In other words, this isn’t really one of his last films.)\n\nOh, and ignore that 76 minute runtime; it’s actually about 72 minutes. Pay attention, this is important stuff.\n\nYou know, while I didn’t grow up with these “Tales of Horror” tapes specifically (and if I ever saw them anywhere, it didn’t register enough for me to retain the memory today), I wasn’t totally unfamiliar with Goldstar. I may have related this tale on the blog before, but my grandmother had a copy of the 1935 version of Scrooge put out by them. Probably something she got through Avon. It kinda just resided in one of her tape cabinets, unwatched and maybe even forgotten completely, when young movie buff me begged her for it. She acquiesced, I took it home, and it promptly got jammed in my VCR. The tape got tossed naturally, though I inexplicably (?) held onto the sleeve (which is actually still around here…somewhere…). So, weird as it may sound, Goldstar Video actually makes me think of mah gramma and that general time in my young movie-lovin’ life.\n\nNone of which changes the fact that these weren’t just budget tapes, these were the budget tape’s budget tape. If you’re a sucker for this sort of thing like I obviously I am, and especially if you grew up during the era, the early-90s aura of these things is pretty powerful, in ways I’m honestly finding it difficult to accurately explain. And heck, I’m not saying you couldn’t find these in legit video stores (you almost certainly could), but these “Tales of Horror” releases just scream “supermarket offerings” to me. Lemme explain: I have this very clear mental picture (and that’s all this is, a mental picture; not a memory) of all of these volumes gathered up on racks together and sold for cheap during the Halloween season at a, say it with me, supermarket. That’s not an unreasonable thing to imagine, is it?\n\nActually, the thought recalls (and this is a real memory) the racks of tapes put out by Acme Video I remember seeing at the Chapel Hill plaza Tops (I guess it was Tops by then; post-Finast, pre-Giant Eagle, methinks) during that Halloween season at some point in the (again, methinks) 1990s. I only got one at the time, The Slime People, but the memory itself is indelible. And yes, Indestructible Man was part of that series, too.\n\nAm I babbling too much for you right now? Probably, but you know what? Don’t go telling me what to write. Maaaan I’m trying to broaden your horizons up in here – you think I’m doing this for my health?! I’ve got Mannix season one on DVD already loaded up, or I could have DVR’d Caroline in the City and been watching that right now instead. But no, I chose to be here, writing this, attempting to inform and, dare I say, ENTERTAIN you. And yet, I sense you remain unimpressed. I JUST CAN’T WIN.\n\nSorry, went off on a weird little tangent there. Anyway, enough tapehead gushing. Indestructible Man the movie proper – this one’s a lot of fun. It’s not typically regarded as a great film, and technically, well, it’s not. But I really don’t think it’s all that bad, either.\n\nOur plot concerns one Charles “Butcher” Benton (Lon Chaney Jr.!), who, as the movie opens, is on death row. He believes his lawyer and accomplices in a heist that netted a honkin’ 600 grand double-crossed him in court in order to keep the loot for themselves. He’s actually right, but with his execution imminent, there’s not a whole heck of a lot he can do about it. That doesn’t stop him from vowing to kill them all in revenge anyway. Hey, why sweat the small details?\n\nWell, his execution goes down, but his body is then illegally sold from the mortuary to a scientist (played by Robert “Inspector Henderson from Adventures of Superman” Shayne) and his assistant (played by Joe “the captain from that 60s sitcom I really, really can’t stand despite the presence of Tim Conway” Flynn) to be used for cancer research. And as so often happens in these situations, he’s accidentally brought back to life – but now with superhuman strength. (He’s an indestructible man, man.) So now that he’s breathing again, super strong, and retains the memory of his death row vow, he sets off to get revenge on the guys who done him wrong.\n\nAlso on the case (despite never actually giving it up, even though it was seemingly closed) is Lt. Dick Chasen (Casey Adams), who isn’t satisfied with Butcher being dead (or so he thinks HAW HAW HAW); he suspects Benton’s lawyer was crooked and wants to recover the loot besides. Along the way, he strikes up a romance with Benton’s girlfriend, dancer Eva Martin (Marian Carr).\n\nWhat makes Indestructible Man particularly cool (and what – probably – didn’t appeal to me back in the day but sure does now) is how noirish it is. While absolutely science fiction, it plays out more like a crime thriller. And, it’s narrated throughout by Lt. Chasen – that coupled with the noir-like elements are obvious indicators that the 1950s iteration of Dragnet was a clear influence on this movie. Indeed, The Little Shop of Horrors would later go the same route, albeit with solid doses of parody and black humor. Even though Shop is by far the higher-regarded offering, I actually don’t think it would make a bad double feature with Indestructible Man, thanks mainly to those faux-Dragnet vibes.\n\nWhile it’s mostly a serious film, there are some humorous moments here, though perhaps unintentionally. Early on, when Benton first vows his revenge, his lawyer reminds him he’s scheduled to die, to which Benton briefly looks down in an “oh, that’s right” manner. Also, the aspect of using Benton’s body for cancer research really only works if Benton had cancer, something that’s never established in the movie. Finally, when one of Benton’s accomplices, the wonderfully named “Squeamy Ellis,” meets his demise and Eva is told it was someone named “Squeamy” who croaked, she actually asks if it was Squeamy *Ellis* – lady, how many people named “Squeamy” could you possibly know?!\n\nIndestructible Man has long been a public domain staple, appearing numerous times on VHS (obviously!), DVD, in various home video compilations, on TV, and so on and so forth. You know, just as you’d expect. The Lon Chaney Jr. name draw probably helps, too. I was pleased to see that the print Goldstar utilized actually wasn’t too bad. It’s not a great print, there’s the expected dirt and scratches and whatnot, a few instances of heavier wear, and some scenes are too dark, but for the most part, it’s okay. Despite being a 30 year old budget VHS tape recorded in SLP, it looked reasonably decent when played on the S-VHS RCA VCR I once wrote about. (Yeah, the thing still works like a champ.) Maybe more “typical PD movie print” than outright good, but yeah, decent enough.\n\nOh, and there was an aspect to this print that I can’t recall ever seeing before: a little post-opening credits introductory scrawl, as well as cast credits at the end! (Joe Flynn totally got short shrift.)\n\nWhere did these elements come from? Were they added for television showings, or do they hail from earlier theatrical prints? My gut tells me it was the former rather than the latter, but that’s merely guesswork on my part; I really have no idea. Still, kinda neat, and definitely unexpected on my part!\n\nJust as I anticipated, I enjoyed Indestructible Man upon this latest viewing quite a bit. At only 70+ minutes, it’s definitely breezy, and that sci-fi/Dragnet mash-up is something I find incredibly appealing. Is it occasionally a little silly? Well, yeah, but then, this isn’t high art, nor was it (probably) intended to be. It’s fun, it’s entertaining, and it’s 1950s; what more do you need?\n\nFor a movie I once didn’t care much for, over the years it has really become an area of extreme interest for me. If I stumble across a release during my travels that I don’t already have, you can be sure that, odds are, it’s comin’ home with me. And even when it comes to TV showings, I may not watch ’em in full, but they’re worth at least a cursory glance, if only for print quality. In fact, when Svengoolie ran this back in November, to be totally honest with you, it was the most excited I had been for one of his movies in quite awhile. (He ran a really nice copy of the movie. Maybe not as pristine as the TCM one I saw years ago, but then, I’m going from memory; they may have been one and the same for all I know.)\n\nSo yes, a movie I enjoy and collect, and presented in a way that could have only come from the early 1990s. Goldstar’s “Tales of Horror” series was clearly a budget line, but even though it presented flicks that could be perceived as “standard issue,” or even “well worn,” that doesn’t mean it wasn’t capable of providing some terrific entertainment – and in an attractive package to boot! There’s no better example of that than their 1992 release of Indestructible Man.\n\nOH HEY BUT WAIT!\n\nYou may be wondering just what other titles were presented as “Tales of Horror.” After all, there were multiple volumes released, and I’ve only detailed three of them in my time here. So, what all did they put out?\n\nWell, I don’t have a complete list, because unlike the Amvest Grampa tapes, in which a scroll of possible releases was presented in the outros, no such luxury exists with these Goldstar tapes. Not to the best of my knowledge, anyway. As such, and with no one else (again, to the best of my knowledge) putting together such a list, all I can do is keep an eye out and notate if/when I can. Here’s what I’ve come up with so far [UPDATED 8/27/22]:\n\nVolume #1: The Man and the Monster\n\nVolume #2: Black Dragons\n\nVolume #3: The Corpse Vanishes\n\nVolume #4: Dark Eyes of London\n\nVolume #5: Dementia 13\n\nVolume #6: Indestructible Man\n\nVolume #7: King of the Zombies\n\nVolume #8: Monster From Green Hell\n\nVolume #9: Night of the Living Dead\n\nVolume #10: Phantom Ship\n\nVolume #11: House of Exorcism\n\nVolume #12: Bowery at Midnight\n\nVolume #13: The Black Raven\n\nVolume #14: ???\n\nVolume #15: Invisible Ghost\n\nVolume #16: The Terror\n\nVolume #17: The Mad Monster\n\nVolume #18: Bluebeard\n\nVolume #19: Samson vs. the Vampire Women\n\nVolume #20: Fury of the Wolf Man\n\nVolume #21: Snake People\n\nVolume #22: Lady Frankenstein\n\nVolume #23: The Most Dangerous Game\n\nVolume #24: Scared to Death\n\nVolume #25+: ???\n\nWere there more than 24 volumes? What’s the missing title of #14? I don’t know, but if you do, hey, hit up the comments!\n\nFound earlier tonight, only mere hours ago as of this writing, is something so undeniably cool, so definitively hailing from the golden age of VHS (and by extension, the golden age of video rental stores), that I just couldn’t wait to get a post out of it. Also, I haven’t updated since Halloween; something needs to go up just to let y’all know I’m still here.\n\nDig this: from 1989, it’s a plastic promotional piggy [alliteration] bank commemorating the movie How I Got Into College, particularly (presumably) its initial release on home video. Neato! Found in a $4 bag of (mostly) animal toys, as soon as I spotted this piece residing in its depths, there was no way it wasn’t coming home with me. I wouldn’t have minded had they been asking $4 for this alone, though considering (almost) everything else in the bag was what I considered to be junk, it kinda worked out the same for me anyway.\n\nIt’s not a particularly big bank, though I’m not going to go back upstairs just to measure it. Provided you’re an adult, I’d say it’s “handheld.” You can fit several bucks worth of quarters in it easily.\n\nObviously, the main area of interest in the picture here is the How I Got Into College logo emblazoned on the side of the swine. That, coupled with the Twentieth Century Fox date & copyright notation underneath, says beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is in relation to the 1989 romantic comedy that, apparently, wasn’t much of a box office success. (Or so says that Wikipedia link above.) How did it do on home video? I, uh, have no idea. Certainly there were movies that did poorly in theaters but found popularity on video, but as to whether How I Got Into College was one of those or not, I couldn’t say.\n\nWhy a piggy bank? Because you gotta save your money for college HAW HAW HAW! Well, unless there’s a specific tie-in to the film here; I haven’t actually seen it. I’m using deductive reasoning or an educated guess or something like that.\n\nLike any self-respecting piggy bank, there’s a slot along the top to deposit your various coinage. However, the fact that there’s nowhere to easily extricate said coinage (short of smashing it to little itty bitty piggy bits, anyway) points to this being more of a promotional novelty than something someone would seriously use to beat the big city banks at their own game. I like the little hat the pig is wearing.\n\n“Now just a minute, blogger video person; how do ya know it’s for the home video release of the movie? Maybe it’s for the theatrical release!”\n\nThis is how:\n\nEmblazoned on the other side of our hapless hog is the old CBS/FOX Video logo. Since CBS/FOX distributed the initial home video release of the movie, I’m just going to go ahead and use that patented deductive reasoning/educated guessing/whatevering again and figure this was put out in conjunction with said home video release. Putting clues like these together is just another reason why I like to fancy myself “Mista Archaeological Man.”\n\nI’m not sure it’ll mean anything to someone who didn’t grow up constantly seeing it, but MAN, that CBS/FOX logo, I always have and always will love it. It’s just such a source of nostalgia and that era in home video. Found on numerous, now-old tapes, both big time titles or otherwise, CBS/FOX releases were truly ubiquitous throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s. They put out so many movies, I’d think a store selling or renting videos back then would have had to been trying to not have at least several CBS/FOX offerings on their shelves.\n\nTo this day, when I spot an old VHS put out by them at a thrift store, I’ll take at least a cursory glance; even if I don’t buy it, I will at least momentarily appreciate the CBS/FOXiness of the tape. And, I’ll go to my grave insisting that the definitive home video releases of Star Wars/The Empire Strikes Back/Return of the Jedi are the VHS’ put out by them, using the poster art for the front covers. You can keep your THXs and your DVDs and your modern enhancements (where applicable); Luke Skywalker raising his lightsaber triumphantly while the visage of Darth Vader looms ominously in the background is where it’s at.\n\nSo yes, I do indeed like seeing that logo on the other side of the piggy bank here. (I wonder if these piggy banks were sold as blanks/generics to places for promotional purposes? As in, the same pig design can be found with or without advertising for various releases or establishments? It seems like a natural promo item for banks to hand out. But, that’s just me hypothesizin’ up in here.)\n\nAs of this writing, I can’t find any other images of this specific bank online, through auctions or otherwise. As such, I doubt this was something every customer got when they picked up their fresh new VHS copy of How I Got Into College from their preferred video retail establishment upon release. Otherwise, I’d probably be seeing something on it out there, right? Perhaps it was simply to entice retailers to order copies of How I Got Into College for the store, or maybe to act as a temporary tip jar on the counter as patrons (hopefully) purchased a copy of How I Got Into College to call their own? Could this be considered the piggy bank equivalent of one of those screener tapes?\n\nThis is all strictly guesswork on my part; I really have no idea. If anyone knows for sure, hey, I have a comment section for a reason.\n\nLike I said before, I haven’t seen How I Got Into College. I guess I had at least heard of it before, but that was pretty much it. Looking online, it has a good cast and is supposedly pretty light. Apparently it isn’t raunchy, which is good, since I’m not a fan of the raunchiness. I guess I’ll keep an eye out for it during my travels – you can be sure that a CBS/FOX copy of the movie that crosses my path will in all likelihood be entering my collection soon after. A candidate for a possible future old VHS review? Could be!\n\nHey, look at that; some 31 years after it came on the scene, this promotional piggy bank is still doing its job!\n\nSometimes (sometimes) it’s a little surprising being the Northeast Ohio Video Hunter. Flattering, but surprising. How so? Because when it comes to the vintage electronics posts, specifically VCRs as per our subject today, some of the feedback I receive can be (figuratively) eyebrow-raising. Mostly it’s in the form of viewership; for the most part I tend to get more views with the articles on old electronics than I do any other post. Sometimes though, people get the impression that I know more about all this stuff than I really do, and they’ll come to me with questions, either in the comment sections or in private emails.\n\nI really am flattered by that, but I’m by no means an expert where VCRs are concerned. Don’t get me wrong, I know the basics about them, I can usually tell when one is ‘good’ or there’s something unique or special regarding it, but it doesn’t take much online searching to find the real experts; folks that discuss pinch rollers and diodes and such. You know, the kind of technical stuff that makes my head swim.\n\nI never meant to make people think I’m so kind of authority (ha!) on the subject, but rather, the unspoken idea behind my VCR articles was supposed to be from the viewpoint of a “regular guy.” An every man describing what he comes across from his POV, which is of course the exact reality. And it’s about to happen again.\n\nSo yeah, here’s another VCR article. Ladies and gentleman, rest your eyes upon the behemoth Panasonic PV-1500!\n\nVia estate sale, I brought home the Panasonic PV-1500 not this past summer, but rather the summer before. No joke, this beast was the culminating find in a pretty good day of yard saleing (sailing?), over a year ago. I think the guy wanted $15 for it but took $8, if I recall correctly. So I paid up, flexed my negligible muscular abilities and hauled it home, and it’s been sitting off to the side in my basement floor ever since. Indeed, the pic above is from when it first entered my abode; subsequent pics, taken just the other day, will feature an obviously different locale, both because this thing is mammoth and I only want to mess with it so much, and because, frankly, this picture remained the best “all encompassing” shot of the thing. Don’t worry, we’ll take a closer look at all the particulars.\n\nI don’t have an exact date for this VCR. The only mention I saw online was in this 1979 Popular Science scan, hence the “circa” of my title. Unfortunately, even the vintage VHS gallery currently skips from the PV-1300 to the PV-1600 in their listings. Stylistically the PV-1500 looks nearly identical to the PV-1600, except the latter features recording/playback in SP, LP and EP, whereas the former only features SP and LP. Being older, that, uh, makes sense.\n\nAs we saw in this terrible old article regarding a big huge Quasar VCR, I love these humongous early examples of home video technology. Not only are they absolute throwbacks to a totally bygone era (“gee, no kidding!”), but you, or at least I, don’t come across them very often – for obvious reasons. The difference of only a few years rendered decks like this wildly obsolete in size and looks and (most) abilities, and even nowadays these earlier machines don’t have much practical use, even as far as this incredibly niche hobby is concerned. This is about as far away from my beloved Panasonic AG-1970 as it gets!\n\nThat’s not to say VCRs like this should be tossed (again, as far as this niche hobby is concerned nowadays; the general public stopped caring about any and all VHS loooooong ago). Huge, impractical and lacking in certain abilities though it may be, as a historical piece of late-70s/early-80s tech, if nothing else it sure looks neat. Provided you’ve got the space for it, anyway; the footprint on these ain’t exactly dainty.\n\nManufacturers really went the extra mile with their products back then. Not only is this VCR built like a tank (with the size to match; I’m considering climbing in it and rolling down the street and wow that has to be the dumbest thing I’ve ever written on this blog), but it came with a protective dust cover. As per warnings found on said dust cover, you can’t have it on when the thing is playing or the timer is set or apparently at any other time except when the machine is sitting idle. This is understandable, since I imagine the amount of heat this units generates when powered up is comparable to a dern blast furnace.\n\nSpeaking of powered up, when I first considered writing an article on this VCR last week, I did indeed lug it out, plug it in, turn it on and test it as best I could. Not that I had any illusions of this magically working like new (these old machines may have been well built, but c’mon, this is still a roughly 40 year old electronic we’re talking about), but even so, the whirring/grinding noise it made when I ran a tape – one I didn’t care about – was borderline stomach-churning, and made all the more unsettling by the fact it wouldn’t stop even when I finally got the tape out (and when I powered off then on, the grinding would start right back up again).\n\nAlso, messing with some of the switches didn’t seem to produce any effect (i.e., they weren’t registering), I couldn’t get the clock to display even a flashing 12:00, and to top it all off, the decades of accumulated dust/grime/I don’t know produced a smell that was not particularly pleasant (and also not unlike what I briefly described in my RCA TV/Atari Xenophobe post).\n\nAll of which is to say that unlike my usual M.O., you’re not getting any pictures of this deck powered on, playing a tape, or what have you. As such, for me, it has been rendered most definitively a display piece. A very large display piece. A display piece that constantly threatens to absolutely obliterate one of my feet should it drop when my muscles give out while trying to carry it.\n\nWhether correctly working or not (and trust me, it’s the latter, not the former), the channel selectors on the front panel absolutely made this worth the eight bucks or however much I dropped on it.\n\nIndeed, if you recall this old Toshiba Betamax post (the odds are you won’t), you’ll remember that that machine featured the same set-up, and that I was quite enamored with it. Why? Because it’s so absolutely, undeniably Northeast Ohio.\n\nI don’t know what 2 stood for, but 3 = WKYC (NBC), 5 = WEWS (Cleveland’s ABC), 8 = WJKW (CBS), 43 = WUAB (independent station), 25 = WVIZ (Cleveland PBS), 61 = WCLQ (another indie, and points to this being used in the early 1980s, as that station signed on in ’81), 45 = WNEO (Alliance/Youngstown PBS), 23 = WAKR (Akron’s ABC), 17 = WJAN or WDLI, depending on if it’s before 1983 or after (religious indie), and 9 = no idea.\n\nAlso, look close and you can see the remote control (they were corded back then!) and microphone inputs at the very bottom of the unit.\n\nHere’s how you’d tune the aforementioned channels in. I guess once they were entered into the presets it wasn’t a big deal, but man oh man, getting there practically required a master’s degree in engineering or sumpin’. Seriously, this pretty much makes my head swim just looking at it.\n\nAlso, your obligatory tracking knob as well as a tuner/camera toggle are located on this panel.\n\nIn the same wheelhouse, located just above the channel presets is the VCR timer station and clock-settin’ switches. While somewhat less complicated than the requirements, erm, required for tuning the channels, it’s still something that looks like a far bigger pain than you’d expect. Seriously, it’s the kind of thing that would have had me staying up till all hours just to “easy” record something. (I.e., simply press the record button at the specific time whatever I wanted was set to begin.)\n\nLike most everything else about this VCR, these are functions that would be (thankfully) simplified just a few short years later. Suddenly I get all the “I can’t get the clock to stop flashin’ 12:00!” jokes.\n\nAlso, I’ve never liked the old school ‘number counters’ found on older decks. Gimme good ol’ hours and minutes any day!\n\nThis is a top-loading VCR, and as such, tapes are loaded (say it with me) on the top of the unit, via raising/lowering drawer. When the powered up, a light illuminates the inside of the drawer, a feature that does indeed still work on this machine.\n\nAnother hallmark of these early-gen VCRs: cassette player-styled buttons for play, stop, etc.\n\nAnd, an option that would continue for some years after VCRs began being downsized and simplified but was largely absent as the 1990s dawned on lower-end consumer models is the audio dub feature, which as you can see was present here.\n\nLike I said before, I couldn’t get the clock to come on, no matter what I slammed my paws on. As such, this picture here is little different than if I had the machine plugged in. So why are you getting so upset?\n\nThe power light is self-explanatory, but the one labeled “dew” stands for a dew indicator. Basically, if there was moisture in the machine, the light would come on and the machine would refuse to function until said moisture had dissipated or was otherwise removed. Pretty smart move, especially since water and electricity don’t mix and the last thing you need is one of these VCRs exploding like that one planet in Star Wars.\n\nAlso, toggles for power, and TV/VTR (VTR standing for Video Tape Recorder). And as you can see, only two recording speeds were available: SP and LP. People like to mention how the earliest VCRs had a two-hour SP VHS recording time over Betamax’s mere single hour, but you know, I’ve got an RCA VBT-200 from 1977, apparently the first VHS VCR released in the U.S., and unless it’s a later revision but with the same model number, mine features the same SP/LP option. Heck, the earliest blank VHS tapes also indicated 2 or 4 hour recording times.\n\nAll of which goes to say that for as much as I love Beta, VHS had an even bigger advantage in recording times from the very start than is usually stated. Did you want better picture quality or way more recording time? I really do love Betamax, but there’s a reason VHS won the war.\n\nI’ve mentioned before that I feel for these VCR posts to be “complete,” I have to take a look at the inputs/outputs/etc. on the back of the machines, but in truth, I never really have all that much to say about them. I mean, what can I say? Stuff is kinda self-explanatory.\n\nI do like seeing the input/outputs for both UHF and VHS, that’s a nice throwback, and I especially like that AV cables are supported. Had it looked like this VCR even remotely still functioned correctly, I’d have taken advantage of them and hopefully posted a screencap of something playing, but twas not to be.\n\n“Remote Pause” I’m assuming refers to an option separate from the corded remote input found on the front? Something to pause a recording as it, uh, records, I’m guessing?\n\nSee, PV-1500. Did you think I was lying? I wasn’t.\n\nThe PV-1500 complies with the FCC, as you’d hope, but the real interesting thing here is the disclaimer about recording. Ah, the days before the 1984 court case put that issue to bed!\n\nI like the warning about not getting water all over the VCR. You’d think such a warning is merely covering all the bases, but let’s face it, there were probably some folks out there who needed that reminder. The very same folks who would have (presumably) been wrestling with the channel-tuning and clock-setting features, which is kinda mind blowing.\n\nYou know, over the years I’ve collected a lot of VCRs. Some for actual use, some merely for the sake of collecting. And one thing I’ve come to realize is that Panasonics are probably my favorites. Generally well-built, sometimes feature-packed, and very often just plain cool-lookin’, as far as I’m concerned Panasonic put out some of the best machines in that (in my opinion) 1985-1990 sweet spot of consumer VCRs. Heck, years later I’m still enamored by the slick and swanky PV-1730. Certainly in this day and age some models will probably need some work, at least belt replacements, to get them up and running correctly, but that’s just the nature of old electronics.\n\nAnyway, this PV-1500 hails from a bit before all that, in the relatively more-lawless early days of the format. Innovations and downsizing and such were still forthcoming, but for the time, this was a revolutionary (and undoubtedly expensive!) piece of technology. I’d like to think that in this age of high-def and streaming services and whatnot, that can still be appreciated.\n\n(I don’t know how else to end this article; I’m kinda spent. It’s a cool old VCR, okay?)\n\nHey, do you like The Blues Brothers? Sure you do! I mean, who doesn’t? Movie’s a legit classic, yo. I certainly love the film; a random weekend broadcast years and years ago introduced me proper to it, and I’ve been a fan ever since. To me, it’s the gold standard of SNL-based movies, and – unless you’re counting something like Ghostbusters which featured more than one SNL alumni but wasn’t based on an actual SNL skit – man, it’s not even close.\n\nWhich makes this random find from last week so mind blowing to yours truly. While looking over rows of used VHS at a thrift store, my eyes feel upon, say it with me, The Blues Brothers. Upon first glance it appeared to be just another relatively-early copy of the film; I may love the movie, but earlier pressings are practically a dime-a-dozen.\n\nThat is, until I noticed the copyright of 1980 at the top of the sleeve spine (reason enough alone to snap it up; earlier copies may be common, but not necessarily the earliest) and, perhaps more interestingly, the notation of “Part II.”\n\nThe historical aspects of this find were immediately evident: this was almost-certainly the very first home video issue of the film (it’s from 1980; it can’t go any earlier than that, cause that’s the same year the movie came out, man!), and as such, because it was a fairly lengthy film (2 hours 13 minutes), it had to be split over two VHS tapes.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I must specify that I only have Part II here. I certainly looked at the thrift, but Part I was MIA. Either someone didn’t realize what was up and bought tape #1 before I got there, or (what seems more likely) Part I was loooong gone before Part II ever set foot in the store. Either way this was mildly irritating for yours truly, but I can’t complain too much; I had zero idea that The Blues Brothers was split over two tapes for its initial video release, or truthfully, that the movie even had a video release the same year it hit theaters.\n\nIt makes sense that they’d have to split the movie into two parts that early on though; that sort of thing was not uncommon in the early years of VHS for longer flicks such as this. The first video release of the 1976 King Kong remake went the same route, for example. Just a few years later, companies figured out how to get the entire film all in one package. Indeed, by 1983 The Blue Brothers was seemingly all on one tape, but apparently the technology wasn’t there yet in 1980.\n\nFrom initial appearances, the front cover here doesn’t look too different from the common VHS releases of the films seen throughout the rest of the 1980s and probably into the 1990s. Visit that just-linked page and you’ll see that the 1983 edition looks pretty close front-cover-wise to this one – except that for this initial issue they colored Jake & Elwood’s sunglasses green. I don’t know why they colored the sunglasses green, but it seems to be unique to this first release.\n\nOther than that though, the cover looks extremely similar to that 1983 edition, and barring just a few further changes, even the 1985 release looks pretty much the same. It’s all about those green glasses and, you know, two-part thing here. (Also, I just noticed John Candy didn’t get a credit at the very top; say what?!)\n\nIf you go back up and check out that link to the 1983 edition of this film, you’ll see that by and large it looks very, very similar as far as the back cover goes, too. In fact, except for that whole “Part II” notation here and the missing credits and “Dolby” info seen in ’83, it looks pretty identical. Even the synopsis is the same.\n\nThe summary on the back is fine, and it’s not like there’s room for a novel back there, but even so, some pertinent info was left out. Namely, that Jake & Elwood are in a race against time to raise some (honest) money in order to save their childhood orphanage. Remember, they’re “on a mission from God.”\n\nTo do this, they have to get their old band back together, do some playin’ and make some "
