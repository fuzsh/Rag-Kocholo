        "text": "In Auckland, New Zealand Academy Cinemas will present First Blood (1982, a 4k restoration) Friday, November 6, The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956, exclusive to Academy Cinemas members and the first of an Alfred Hitchcock retrospective) Saturday, November 7, Rear Window (1954) Monday, November 9 and Friday, November 20, Strangers On a Train (1951) Tuesday, November 10 and Saturday, November 21, Rope (1948) Thursday, November 12 and Saturday, November 21, Psycho (1960) Friday, November 13 and Monday, November 16, Foreign Correspondent (1940) Saturday, November 14 and Tuesday, November 17, Shadow of a Doubt (1943) Saturday, November 14 and Thursday, November 19, a Double Feature of Saboteur (1942) and North by Northwest (1959) Sunday, November 15 and a Double Feature of The Birds (1963) and Marnie (1964) on Sunday, November 22.\n\nFor more information specifically on each of these programmes, click on the corresponding above image. To see the entire month of November’s programming click on the banner above.\n\nNoir City International, the Film Noir Foundation's first virtual film festival, is happening November 13-29, 2020. Presented by the Film Noir Foundation in partnership with AFI Silver Theatre, details for the streaming festival (including film schedule, passes, and the purchase of individual films) are available by clicking on the above image.\n\nThere are 23 recommended films to watch on Turner Classic Movies in the U.S. this month:\n\nDick Powell’s Everyman faces a mid-life crisis, including a far more considerable threat to his well being in the form of Raymond Burr’s jealous contractor, in Pitfall, previously recommended here. Pitfall will occur Wednesday, November 4 at 9 pm PST.\n\nMy next two recommendations both concern influential spirits from the past:\n\nThe first has an other worldly apparition but could hardly qualify as possessing a \"horror\" or even \"haunted\" theme, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, one of the most beautifully touching love stories ever brought to film. This incredibly moving drama is reviewed here. The romance will commence Thursday, November 5 at 5 pm PST.\n\nThose who associate the name Sam Peckinpah with a strong dose of cinematic violence might be surprised to see the elegiac Ride the High Country, one of his early and finest westerns with far less than the usual amount of physical conflict portrayed by the maverick director. This is Top Ten Western #4 and will ride into TCM territory Friday, November 6 at 3 pm PST.\n\nMy next two TCM recommendations are not only romance films with two of the same cast members (Paul Henreid and Claude Rains), they were both produced by Hal Wallis and share screenwriting duties by Casey Robinson.\n\nNow, Voyager is up first and displays the greater romantic fireworks of the two, presented with fervour, maturity and elegance. Previously reviewed here, Now, Voyager will set sail Tuesday, November 10 at 10:30 am PST.\n\nImmediately following, 1944's Academy Award Best Picture Winner Casablanca will air which I criticised in my review here, for its emotionally underwhelming Parisian flashback, partly due to the fact that we did not see the romance develop before these rather lukewarm scenes took place. There is, however, no denying the fact that this film casts a magical spell and is certainly capable of sweeping one up in its appealing blend of romance, sacrifice and political intrigue. This 1942 classic, one of Hollywood's proudest, arrives Tuesday, November 10 at 12:45 pm PST.\n\nBelieve it or not, once again this month we have Hidden Gem #10: They Won't Believe Me (1947), with its fascinating, twisted plot and antithetically noir central character. This was my very first entry (linked here) for the Cinema Cafe Site with some kind words from the \"Czar of Noir\" himself, Eddie Muller, in the comments section below the review. If you're a noir fan and haven't seen this unusual motion picture, please believe me, you don't want to miss this major opportunity. The next film to emerge from the TCM shadows will air Thursday, November 12 at 5 am PST.\n\nNext up is a more realistic and far less glamorous alternative to the James Bond world of espionage, The Ipcress File, previously reviewed as a Blu-ray selection here. One will know why I chose the heading \"Now Listen to Me...\" for my monthly column after seeing this film. The spying will begin Sunday, November 15 at 5 pm PST.\n\nMany of the films first listed as \"Hidden Gems\" are not so hidden anymore thanks to those companies releasing them on DVD and Blu-ray in addition to their regular showings on TCM. One of these is Hidden Gem #59, The Hill, an intense dramatic achievement, as is the late Sean Connery’s performance. I've previously reviewed this film here. The Hill can be marvelled at on TCM Thursday, November 26 at (early morning) 12:15 am PST.\n\nThis noir’s triangular relationship curiously mirrors Columbia’s Gilda released only several months later. While Gilda is the more fulfilling, polished and therefore intriguing of the two films, Suspense conjures up some striking impressions of its own. British skating star Belita was also Monogram’s rising star for a few years and in Suspense, her skills on the ice are on fire. You see, she’s also the star of this film’s “The Ice Parade”, a revue featuring spectacular sets, colourful costumes and magnificent musical numbers. Her husband, played by Albert Dekker, is the show’s impresario whose sinister demeanour will later become more than just a facade. Enter the uncouth, down and out Barry Sullivan with a dubious history who’s hired as the show’s peanut vendor but has bigger ambitions which, after a spell of promotions, include Dekker’s wife. Then there’s Bonita Granville whom Sullivan abandoned in Chicago, still carrying the torch. She arrives on the scene making threats to expose Sullivan’s sordid past. The fact that Sullivan’s character is presented as purposely unsympathetic but still in possession of such identifiably noir motives, is one of the film’s courageous strengths. So is Dekker’s commanding characterisation of slowly consuming jealousy which leads to an eye-catching snowbound assassination attempt. There are other visual wonders to behold, plays with light and shadows amidst ominous set designs like the pendulum swinging lamp anticipating a similar effect employed in the film noir Desperate (1947) and Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960). Finally there is the final presence of character actor Eugene Pallette with his unmistakable raspy signature sound who lends further distinction to the proceedings.\n\nUnfortunately, a few elements are ineffectively developed and resolved, such as Belita’s vapid feelings toward Sullivan, the aforementioned threats made by Bonita Granville’s character, and a physical confrontation between two of the male characters toward the conclusion that goes unnervingly unseen. As impressive as the film’s “showstoppers” are, they can’t help but be just that: Belita’s spirited showcasing minimises the film’s darker “behind the scenes” exploits… until the last icy performance that is: an inspired integration of ‘Daliesque’ death defiance with deadly intent. This penultimate act not only delivers on the title’s promise, it foreshadows noir’s final vow ***(Spoiler Present)*** of our anti-hero’s deathly demise. Stars Sullivan and Belita would team up again in Monogram’s more resolute film noir The Gangster (1947). Frank Tuttle directed from Philip Yordan’s original screenplay with cinematography by Karl Struss and music by Daniele Amfitheatrof. Suspense will occur on TCM (updated) Friday, January 5 (2024) at 11:15 am PST.\n\nSuspense is also November’s DVD recommendation, listed as the last entry in this column.\n\nMy last TCM recommendation this month is star Jimmy Cagney's most formidable foray into noir, White Heat. A criminal's mother-fixated pathology and the undercover cop trying to catch him are the topics of this previous recommendation here. TCM's screen will heat up Monday, November 30 at 2:45 pm PST.\n\nEven though it is clear that Jacob’s Ladder is intent on not being clear (unlike, say, 1999’s The Sixth Sense when all is said and done), the numerous nightmarish scenes of supernatural danger that befall our main character Jacob Singer, played by Tim Robbins, start to take on a common degree of alienating abstraction (horrifyingly palpable as they are) making their effect repetitious, stifling the narrative’s progression. Themes of interest, such as failed covert medical experiments on military personnel and the sever aftereffects of combat, are hinted at but left undeveloped, not to mention negated altogether by the film’s somewhat cop-out conclusion. As a result, the “Ladder” can seem more like a step stool. We know and are reminded of how unpleasant these thoughts/events are but other than that, due to their highly metaphysical nature, they don’t contribute much to Jacob’s identify.\n\nSo, like some other films reviewed on this site, it is left to the composer to add dimension and lay the emotional groundwork so that hopefully what will be remembered amounts to more than just some dominant images… more like imagery with a purpose. Maurice Jarre’s score goes some way to provide just that: an unorthodox, otherworldly and yet at times, intimate soundscape, one that infuses a much needed personal quality to Jacob’s, and therefore the viewer’s, experience.\n\nQuartet Records and Studio Canal are making this expanded, remastered soundtrack available as a limited edition. This 2-CD set is now available from Intrada Records. More information including international ordering can be obtained by clicking on the accompanying image."
