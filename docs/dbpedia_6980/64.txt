Grace Brewster Murray was born on December 9, 1906, in New York, New York. She was the eldest of three children. Grace’s parents believed that she, her sister, and her brother could achieve whatever they set their minds to. However, Grace’s mother stopped Grace from taking apart too many alarm clocks. At age seven Grace took apart seven alarm clocks to examine how the parts worked and fit together.

In 1928 Murray graduated from Vassar College with honors in physics and mathematics. Her last name changed to Hopper after she married in 1930. She received two more degrees in mathematics from Yale University: a master’s in 1930 and a doctorate in 1934. Hopper taught mathematics at Vassar before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1943.

In 1944 Hopper was assigned to work at Harvard University. There she worked on a series of early computers. While working there she was one of the first to use the term bug to refer to an unexplained computer failure. The term referred to a moth that had caused a problem by entering the circuits of one of the early computers.

In 1957 Hopper and her colleagues created a program called Flow-Matic. The program allowed for English words to be used in the commands. Before Flow-Matic, only mathematical notation could be used. From this work another important programming language called COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) was created in 1959. Hopper used COBOL to develop computer programs for the navy.

Hopper was a commander when she retired from the U.S. Navy in 1966. However, she returned the following year to help with the navy’s computer languages. In 1986 Hopper was the eldest officer on active duty in the U.S. Navy before she retired that year.

Hopper died on January 1, 1992, in Arlington, Virginia. In 2016 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
