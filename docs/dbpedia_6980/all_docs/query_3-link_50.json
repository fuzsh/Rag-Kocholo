        "text": "This document contains information related to feature and module-based licensing options for Cisco Nexus switches that run Cisco NX-OS software.\n\nNote: The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.\n\nThe following table lists the changes to this document.\n\nLicensing Cisco NX-OS Software Features\n\nLicensing allows you to access specified premium features on your device after you install the appropriate license for that feature. The following table compares licensing support between Cisco Nexus 5000/7000 Series switches and Cisco Nexus 3000/9000 Series switches.\n\nTable 1.Licensing Support for Cisco NX-OS Switches\n\n1 The following warning might display when installing the honor-based license. Please ignore this warning and continue with the install. !!!!!! WARNING: 'LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG' LICENSE NOT FOUND ON THE SYSTEM !!!!!!. You have tried to enable a licensed feature [ospf] without installing the 'LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG' license, which has not been found on the system.\n\n2 Temporary licenses with an expiry date are available for evaluation and lab use purposes. They are strictly not allowed to be used in production. Please use a permanent or subscription license that has been purchased through Cisco for production purposes. Evaluation license is supported with Smart Software License but not with Traditional license in Cisco Nexus 9000 series switches.\n\nTier-Based Licenses\n\nTier-based licensing is available for some Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series switches. This licensing model applies to both Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and NX-OS standalone architectures where these switches can be deployed.\n\nThe Release History for Licensing section lists the platforms that support tier-based licensing and the release in which support was introduced.\n\nFor the full breakdown of what features are included in each tier (Essentials, Advantage, and Premier), please reference the Cisco DCN Software Subscriptions page.\n\nTier-based licenses are available as subscription and perpetual consumption models and offer the following benefits:\n\nSubscription — These term-based software licenses are available in 3-year, 5-year, and 7-year terms.\n\n● Consistency across ACI and NX-OS licensing (for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches).\n\n● Tiered licenses are available in DCN Essentials, DCN Advantage, and DCN Premier levels tiers.\n\n● Purchasing a subscription-based license gives you the opportunity to adjust/upgrade the terms of the license (such as moving from Advantage to Premier or 3-year to 5-year.)\n\n● For customers that have a net Total Contract Value (TCV) of more than $100,000, we recommend data-center enrollment for a Cisco Enterprise Agreement. Learn more about Enterprise Agreements to cover your data-center technologies.\n\nPerpetual — This is a nontransferable, fixed-price, traditional licensing model with the right to use covered features for a perpetual term.\n\nNote: DCN Perpetual licenses are not portable between devices.\n\n● The DCN Advantage tier is available as a perpetual license.\n\nNote: Several add-on licenses are also available, which can be added to either tier or purchased independently.\n\nAlong with the infographic below, the Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 Series NX-OS Switch License Navigator (https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/Website/datacenter/license/index.html) is available to help you select the appropriate license for your needs.\n\nFigure 1. Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 Series NX-OS Switch License Navigator Infographic\n\nTable 2.NX-OS License Package features Included in Tier-Based Licenses for Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 Series Switches\n\n3 No license is consumed if default/management VRF is enabled. Enabling additional VRFs will require Essentials license.\n\n4 Feature Pervasive Load Balancing (PLB) is deprecated. Instead, feature ePBR was introduced in NXOS 9.3.5 for all service redirection and load-balancing needs.\n\nTable 3.NX-OS License Package features Included in Add-On Licenses for Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 Series Switches\n\n4 Beginning with Cisco Nexus Release 9.3(5), Secure VXLAN EVPN Multi-Site using CloudSec is supported only on Cisco Nexus 9300-FX2 platform switches. Beginning with Cisco Nexus Release 10.1(1), Secure VXLAN EVPN Multi-Site using CloudSec is supported on Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 platform switches.\n\nNote: Feature support varies by platform and release. See the Nexus Switch Platform Support Matrix to determine which features are supported for your platform.\n\nThe following options are available when you order an Essentials or Advantage package:\n\n· Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches\n\no Essentials or Advantage subscription license for DCN (ACI+NX-OS) for 3, 5, or 7 years\n\no Advantage perpetual license for DCN (ACI+NX-OS) — not portable between devices\n\no Advantage perpetual license for NX-OS — not portable between devices\n\no NX-OS upgrade licenses\n\n· Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches\n\no Essentials or Advantage subscription license for NX-OS for 3, 5, or 7 years\n\no Advantage perpetual license for NX-OS — not portable between devices\n\nEssentials package is offered as subscription only. Essential perpetual license is no longer sold.\n\nIf you install a subscription-based license, you will be notified 90 days before your licensing contract expires.\n\nNote: If the Essentials license expires after the Advantage license is installed, the following message appears: \"LIC_LICENSE_EXPIRED: License expired for feature NXOS_ESSENTIALS_XF. Feature will run in honor mode.\" You can ignore this message because the license is no longer in use.\n\nCisco Nexus 9000 Series Tier-Based Licenses\n\nThe DCN (ACI+NX-OS) Essentials, Advantage, and add-on licenses are supported for Cisco Nexus 9300 platform switches beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(3). Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I7(7) and 9.3(2), the ACI Premier licenses are supported for Cisco Nexus 9300 platform switches. These licenses support license migration from Cisco NX-OS to ACI. Any attempt to install these licenses for a prior release will fail.\n\nWhen you downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(3) to an earlier release, the features that use the DCN (ACI+NX-OS) Essentials, Advantage, and add-on licenses continue to work in honor mode in the downgraded version. In addition, the output of the show license usage command continues to include entries for these unsupported licenses.\n\nTable 4.License Categories and Associated Supported Platforms (Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches)\n\nNote: The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches support static routes, switch virtual interfaces (SVIs), and Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) by default without any license.\n\nTable 5.PIDs for Subscription Tier-Based Licenses for DCN (ACI+NX-OS) (Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches - Fixed Platforms)\n\n* Cisco Nexus 9300-GX platforms do not support MACSec feature.\n\n*Security add on license is mandatory for N9K-C9348D-GX2A platform. This platform is targeted for use cases that require MACSec on all ports.\n\n# Sync-E add-on licenses are applicable only for Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 platforms.\n\nTable 6.PIDs for Subscription Tier-Based Licenses for DCN (ACI+NX-OS) (Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches - Modular Platforms)\n\n7 The ACI Premier license package includes the ACI Essentials and ACI Advantage license packages.\n\nTable 7.PIDs for Perpetual Tier-Based Licenses for DCN (ACI+NX-OS) (Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches). DCN perpetual licenses are not portable between devices.\n\n10 The licenses for the Cisco Nexus 9364C switch are supported beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I7(6). The licenses for the Cisco Nexus 9300-GX switches are supported beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(3).\n\n11 Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Releases 7.0(3)I7(6) and 9.3(1), the -XF2 Essentials and Advantage licenses have priority over the -XF licenses. If an -XF license is installed and features are checked out from this license and then you later install the -XF2 license, the -XF license shows as unused (in the output of the show license usage command), and the features become checked out from the -XF2 license. The Advantage licenses continue to have priority over the Essentials licenses.\n\n12 The following statements are applicable for ACI-STRG:\n\n● This license includes DCNM/NDFC SAN Advanced and is available for Cisco Nexus 93180YC-FX and 93360YC-FX2 platform switches. ACI-STRG will license only 48 ports of native Fiber Channel ports.\n\n● Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(1)F, FCoE with N9K-C93180YC-FX3 in FEX mode is supported only with N9K-C93180YC-FX switches in NPV mode so the ACI-STRG license is needed for the N9K-C93180YC-FX. No ACI-STRG license is needed for N9K-C93180YC-FX3 running in FEX mode. N9K-C93180YC-FX3 in switch mode does not support FCoE.\n\n13 SyncE supported by 9300-FX3 and -FX3S Switch starting from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(5) onwards.\n\nThe NX-OS Essentials, Advantage, and add-on licenses are supported for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I7(3).\n\nTable 8.PIDs for Perpetual Tier-Based Licenses for NX-OS (Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches - Fixed Platforms) . DCN perpetual licenses are not portable between devices.\n\n13 The licenses for the Cisco Nexus 9364C switch are supported beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I7(6). The licenses for the Cisco Nexus 9300-GX switches are supported beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(3).\n\n14 Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Releases 7.0(3)I7(6) and 9.3(1), the -XF2 Essentials and Advantage licenses have priority over the -XF licenses. If an -XF license is installed and features are checked out from this license and then you later install the -XF2 license, the -XF license shows as unused (in the output of the show license usage command), and the features become checked out from the -XF2 license. The Advantage licenses continue to have priority over the Essentials licenses.\n\n15 ACI-SEC-XF is required only for supporting the uplink ports on 9348GC-FXP Platform.\n\n16 ACI-SEC-XF replaces NXOS-SEC-XF. NXOS-SEC-XF is no longer orderable.\n\n17 This license includes DCNM/NDFC SAN Advanced. NXOS-STRG is no longer orderable.\n\nTable 9.PIDs for Perpetual Tier-Based Licenses for NX-OS (Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches - Modular Platforms) . DCN perpetual licenses are not portable between devices.\n\nYou can use the following licenses to upgrade from an NX-OS LAN Enterprise Services license to an NX-OS Essentials or Advantage license.\n\nTable 10.NX-OS Supported Upgrade Licenses (Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches)\n\nCisco Nexus 3000 Series Tier-Based Licenses\n\nThe NX-OS Essentials, Advantage, and add-on licenses are supported for some Cisco Nexus 3000 Series switches.\n\nThe -XM licenses apply to modular switches, the -XF licenses apply to switches with less than 6.4 Tbps, and the -XF2 licenses apply to switches with more than 6.4 Tbps.\n\nThe -XF2 Essentials and Advantage licenses have priority over the -XF licenses. If an -XF license is installed and features are checked out from this license and then you later install the -XF2 license, the -XF license shows as unused (in the output of the show license usage command), and the features become checked out from the -XF2 license. The Advantage licenses to have priority over the Essentials licenses.\n\nTable 11.PIDs for Subscription Tier-Based Licenses for NX-OS (Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches)\n\n18 License support for Cisco Nexus 3400-S switches:\n\n·N3K-C3408-S: N3K-ES-XM-3Y and N3K-ES-XM-5Y\n\n·N3K-C3432D-S: N3K-ES-XF2-3Y and N3K-ES-XF2-5Y\n\nTable 12.PIDs for Perpetual Tier-Based Licenses for NX-OS (Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches). N3K perpetual licenses are not portable between devices.\n\nFeature-Based Licenses (End of Sale)\n\nFeature-based licenses make features available to the entire physical device. Therefore, you only require one copy of the license for a device. A license only supports the listed features. Licenses may be specific to a particular hardware platform. These are legacy licenses and no longer sold.\n\nAny feature that is not included in a license package is bundled with the Cisco NX-OS software and is provided at no extra charge to you.\n\nNote: For specific implementation of features, see the Release Notes document and configuration guides for the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches.\n\nNote: The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches support static routes, switch virtual interfaces (SVIs), and Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) by default (without any license).\n\nThe licenses are independent of each other. If you want to use features that are covered by different licenses, you must install all the appropriate licenses.\n\nThe following table lists the feature-based license packages for the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series (which includes Cisco Nexus 9200, 9300, 9300-EX, 9300-FX/FX2/FX3/FXP, and 9500 switches) in Cisco NX-OS mode.\n\nNote: In the CCW tool, these licenses are described as legacy NX-OS software licenses.\n\nTable 13.Feature-Based Licenses for the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series in Cisco NX-OS Mode\n\n*The 24-port licenses are hardware licenses. They are independent of any Cisco NX-OS or ACI software feature sets or software licenses.\n\n**ACI-SEC-XF replaces NXOS-SEC-XF. NXOS-SEC-XF is no longer orderable.\n\n***ACI-SEC-XM replaces NXOS-SEC-XM. NXOS-SEC-XM is no longer orderable.\n\nThe following table lists the feature-based license packages for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series, which includes Cisco Nexus 7000 switches and Cisco Nexus 7700 switches.\n\nTable 14.Feature-Based Licenses for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series\n\nThe following table lists the feature-based license packages for the Cisco Nexus 6000 Series switches.\n\nTable 15.Feature-Based Licenses for the Cisco Nexus 6000 Series\n\n20 The LAN_BASE_SERVICES_PKG gives unlimited static routes and a maximum of 256 dynamic routes across all the protocols.\n\n21 Routes above 256 for all protocols are included in the LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG license.\n\n22 Although this feature can be enabled and configured in the CLI without this license, it will not function until the license is installed. When you configure HSRP in a virtual port channel (vPC) on the Cisco Nexus 6000 platform without installing the LAN_BASE_SERVICES_PKG license, it sends an HSRP hello message to the link-local multicast address and enables the Active-Active state.\n\n23 Although this feature can be enabled and configured in the CLI without this license, it will not function until the license is installed.\n\n24 The LAN_BASE_SERVICES_PKG license should be installed in order to use the LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG license.\n\n25 Routes above 256 for all the protocols included in the LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG license.\n\n26 L3 IS-IS will be available starting with the Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(1)N1(1).\n\n27 N6K-SERVICES1K9 is available from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.2(0)N1(1).

From Cisco NX-OS Release 7.2(1)N1(1), VXLAN Flood and Learn will require the LAN_BASE_SERVICES_PKG license and the LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG license only.\n\n37 VXLAN EVPN is supported from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.3(0)N1(1) and will require the LAN_BASE_SERVICES_PKG license and the LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG license.\n\n38 N56-SERVICES1K9 is available from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.2(0)N1(1). To use RISE and ITD features with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.1(1)N1(1), use the ENHANCED_LAYER2_PKG license.\n\n39 This license is applicable to Cisco Nexus 5672UP-16G only.\n\n40 This license is applicable to Cisco Nexus 5696 20 Port UP LEM only.\n\nThe prefix of the Product ID number indicates the platform for which the license applies. For example, N5548 indicates that the license is for the Cisco Nexus 5548 switch only, and N5K indicates that the license is for all Cisco Nexus 5000 Series switches.\n\nThe following table lists the feature-based license packages for the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series and Cisco 5500 Series Platform.\n\nTable 17.Feature-Based Licenses for the Cisco Nexus 5000 and Nexus 5500 Series\n\n41 The LAN_BASE_SERVICES_PKG gives unlimited static routes and a maximum of 256 dynamic routes across all the protocols.\n\n42 Although this feature can be enabled and configured in the CLI without this license, it will not function until the license is installed.\n\n43 Although this feature can be enabled and configured in the CLI without this license, it will not function until the license is installed.\n\n44 The LAN_BASE_SERVICES_PKG license should be installed to use the LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG license.\n\n45 Routes above 256 for all the protocols are included in the LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG license.\n\n46 N55-SERVICES1K9 is available from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.2(0)N1(1). To use RISE and ITD features with the Cisco NX-OS Release 7.1(1)N1(1), use the LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG license.\n\n47 Starting NXOS 7.2(0)N1(1), LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG package does not contain ITD license. You need to install NETWORK_SERVICES_PKG package for ITD.\n\nThe following table lists the feature-based license packages for the Cisco Nexus 4000 Series.\n\nTable 18.Feature-Based Licenses for the Cisco Nexus 4000 Series\n\nThe following table lists the feature-based license packages for the Cisco Nexus 3600 platform switches.\n\nTable 19.Feature-Based Licenses for the Cisco Nexus 3600 Platform Switches\n\nThe following table lists the feature-based license packages for the Cisco Nexus 3500 Series switches.\n\nTable 20.Feature-Based Licenses for the Cisco Nexus 3500 Series Switches\n\n4824P_LIC_PKG is the default 24-port license for Cisco Nexus 3524 and 3548 platform switches. 24P_UPG_PKG is the additional 24-port upgrade license for Cisco Nexus 3548 platform switches. This is the upgrade license to enable additional 24 ports and it can only be applied to Cisco Nexus 3548 platform switches.\n\n49 For Cisco NX-OS releases prior to 9.3(3), the BGP feature is checked out from the LAN1K9_ENT_SERVICES_PKG for both Cisco Nexus 3524 and 3548 platform switches.\n\n50 For Cisco NX-OS releases prior to 9.3(3), the PBR feature is checked out from the LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG for both Cisco Nexus 3524 and 3548 platform switches.\n\nNote: After upgrading to Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I7(7), the show license usage command might display license mismatches that do not apply to Cisco Nexus 3500 Series switches. A \"License Missing\" warning in the comments section may also be displayed. Issue the clear license sprom command to recover from this state.\n\nThe following table lists the feature-based license packages for the Cisco Nexus 3000 Series.\n\nTable 21.Feature-Based Licenses for the Cisco Nexus 3000 Series\n\nModule-based Licenses\n\nModule-based licenses make features available to one module on the physical device, so you need one copy of the license for each module that you want to enable the features on. Each license only supports the listed features. Licenses may be specific to a particular hardware platform or module.\n\nAny feature not included in a license package is bundled with the Cisco NX-OS software and is provided at no extra charge to you.\n\nThis table lists the module license packages for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series, which includes Cisco Nexus 7000 switches and Cisco Nexus 7700 switches.\n\nTable 22.Module-Based Licenses for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series\n\nNote: The licenses are independent of each other. If you want to use features that are covered by different licenses, you must install all appropriate licenses. For example, if you want to use EIGRP and VDCs on the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series, you must install both the Enterprise Services Package license and the Advanced Services Package license.\n\nBundle/Chassis-based Licenses\n\nBundle/Chassis-based licensing makes the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) feature available for all supported line card modules such as F2 and F3 for that particular chassis with max counts supported by that chassis.\n\nNote: Bundle/Chassis-based licensing is not supported for the Cisco Nexus 7000 series.\n\nThis table lists the bundle/chassis-based licenses for the Cisco Nexus 7700 Series.\n\nTable 23.Bundle/Chassis-Based Licenses for the Cisco Nexus 7700 Series\n\nHonor Mode Licensing\n\nStarting from Cisco NX-OS Releases 8.2(4) and 8.4(1), Honor Mode Licensing is supported on Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches. Honor mode licensing allows you to enable or continue using a feature without having a valid license for that feature. In such a scenario, a syslog is generated once every 7 days until you acquire the required license. An example of such a syslog is given below.\n\n%LICMGR-2-LOG_LIC_MISSING_WARNING: A feature that requires LAN_ENTERPRISE_SERVICES_PKG\n\nlicense is not installed. System supports honor based licensing so feature will\n\ncontinue to be fully functional. Use 'show license usage <package-name>' to find\n\nfeatures using missing license.\n\nLicensing Terminology\n\nThe following terms are used in this document:\n\nLicensed feature\n\nPermission to use a particular feature through a license file, a hardware object, or a legal contract. This permission is limited to the number of users, number of instances, time span, and the implemented device.\n\nLicensed application\n\nA software feature that requires a license to be used.\n\nLicense enforcement\n\nA mechanism that prevents a feature from being used without first obtaining a license.\n\nNode-locked license\n\nA license that can only be used on a particular device using the device’s unique host ID.\n\nHost IDs\n\nA unique chassis serial number that is specific to each device.\n\nSoftware license claim certificate\n\nA document entitling its rightful owner to use licensed features on one device as described in that document.\n\nProduct Authorization Key (PAK)\n\nThe PAK allows you to obtain a license key from one of the sites listed in the software license claim certificate document. After registering at the specified website, you will receive your license key file and installation instructions through e-mail.\n\nLicense key file\n\nA device-specific unique file that specifies the licensed features. Each file contains digital signatures to prevent tampering and modification. License keys are required to use a licensed feature. License keys are enforced within a specified time span.\n\nMissing license\n\nOnce a license is installed, the license file can be deleted from bootflash as the license is copied to the internal file system. If the internal file system becomes corrupted or a supervisor module is replaced after you have installed a license, the license shows as missing although the feature continues to work. In this case, copy the license file (.lic) into bootflash and reinstall it as soon as possible.\n\nEvaluation license\n\nA temporary license. Evaluation licenses are time bound (valid for a specified number of days) and are tied to a host ID (device serial number).\n\nNote: Temporary licenses with an expiry date are available for evaluation and lab use purposes. They are strictly not allowed to be used in production. Please use a permanent or subscription license that has been purchased through Cisco for production purposes.\n\nPermanent license\n\nA license that is not time bound is called a permanent license.\n\nGrace period\n\nThe amount of time the features in a license package can continue functioning without a license.\n\nSupport\n\nIf you purchased Cisco support through a Cisco reseller, contact the reseller directly. If you purchased support directly from Cisco, contact Cisco Technical Support at this URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/ support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\n\nLicensing Virtualization Support\n\nOn the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series, you install and manage licenses on the physical device in the default virtual device context (VDC 1). Licenses apply to features in all VDCs and Virtual Routing and Forwarding instances (VRFs) on the physical device. You do not need to obtain a separate license for each VDC or VRF. For more information on VDCs, see the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Virtual Device Context Configuration Guide.\n\nLicensing High Availability\n\nAs with other Cisco NX-OS features, the licensing feature also maintains the following high-availability standards:\n\n● Installing any license in the device is a nondisruptive process.\n\n● Installing a license automatically saves a copy of permanent licenses to the chassis.\n\n● If you have enabled the grace period feature, enabling a licensed feature that does not have a license key starts a counter on the grace period. You then have 120 days to install the appropriate license keys, disable the use of that feature, or disable the grace period feature. If at the end of the 120-day grace period the device does not have a valid license key for the feature, the Cisco NX-OS software automatically disables the feature and removes the configuration from the device.\n\nNote: The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series do not support the grace period feature.\n\nNote: The Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches support grace period on Cisco NX-OS Release 8.2(3) and earlier 8.x releases. From Cisco NX-OS Releases 8.2(4) and 8.4(1), Grace period is not supported on Cisco Nexus 7000 Series switches.\n\nNote: Some licenses, for example Cisco TrustSec for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series or Layer 3 Enterprise Services for the Cisco Nexus 5000 Series, do not have a grace period.\n\nDevices with dual supervisors have the following additional high-availability features:\n\n● The license software runs on both supervisor modules and provides failover protection.\n\n● The license key file is mirrored on both supervisor modules. Even if both supervisor modules fail, the license file continues to function from the version that is available on the chassis.\n\nRelease History for Licensing\n\nThis table lists the release history for this feature.\n\nTable 24.Release History for Licensing\n\nSmart Software Licensing for Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches\n\nSmart Software Licensing Overview\n\nCisco Smart Licensing is a flexible licensing model that provides you with an easier, faster, and more consistent way to purchase and manage software across the Cisco portfolio and across your organization. And it’s secure – you control what users can access. With Smart Licensing you get:\n\n●Easy Activation: Smart Licensing establishes a pool of software licenses that can be used across the entire organization—no more PAKs (Product Activation Keys).\n\n●Unified Management: My Cisco Entitlements (MCE) provides a complete view into all of your Cisco products and services in an easy-to-use portal, so you always know what you have and what you are using.\n\n●License Flexibility: Your software is not node-locked to your hardware, so you can easily use and transfer licenses as needed.\n\nTo use Smart Licensing, you must first set up a Smart Account on Cisco Software Central (software.cisco.com).\n\nFor a more detailed overview on Cisco Licensing, go to cisco.com/go/licensingguide.\n\nTraditional Licensing Overview\n\nTraditional licensing at Cisco is a legacy licensing model based on Product Activation Keys (PAK) and Unique Device Identifiers (UDI). On most Cisco NX-OS 7000 Series Switches, capacity needs are assessed prior to obtaining and installing a .tar file on switches to retrieve the UDI. Customers place an order for a PAK, and the PAK is emailed to the user. A combination of them. UDI and PAK is used to receive a license file that is installed in the boot directory of the switch to complete the installation of the Cisco NX-OS software.\n\nThe License Registration Portal (LRP) is available to help migrate traditional licenses to smart licenses. To access the LRP, obtain training, and manage licenses, go to http://tools.cisco.com/SWIFT/LicensingUI/Home.\n\nYou can convert the traditional license to a smart license in the following ways:\n\n●Converting a Traditional License to a Smart License\n\n●Converting a Traditional License to a Smart License—CLI Version\n\nComparing Licensing Models\n\nTwo types of licensing models are used for the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches—traditional licensing and Smart Software Licensing.\n\nTable 25.Comparison Between Traditional Licensing and Smart Software Licensing\n\nGuidelines and Limitations for Smart Software Licensing\n\n● You cannot use both traditional licensing and Smart Software Licensing at the same time on the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches.\n\n● Smart Software Licensing is not supported on Cisco N-Port Virtualizer (Cisco NPV) devices.\n\n● Port licenses will be in out-of-compliance state when you move from a traditional license to a Smart Software License.\n\nSmart Accounts and Virtual Accounts\n\n● A Smart account provides you with a single location for all smart-account enabled products and licenses. It assists you in speedy procurement, deployment, and maintenance of your Cisco software.\n\nIf you are requesting a Smart account on behalf of an organization, you must have the authority to represent the requesting organization when creating a Smart account. After submitting the request, the request goes through an approval process before you are provided with access to your Smart account.\n\nGo to http://software.cisco.com to learn about, set up, and manage a Smart account.\n\n● A virtual account is a subaccount within a Smart account. You can define the virtual account's structure based on organizational layout, business function, geography, or any defined hierarchy. Virtual accounts can be created and maintained only by Smart account administrators.\n\nSmart Software Manager Overview\n\nSmart Software Manager enables the management of software licenses and Smart accounts from a single portal. The interface allows you to activate your product, manage entitlements, renew, and upgrade software. An active Smart account is required to complete the registration process. To access the Smart Software Manager, go to http://www.cisco.com/web/ordering/smart-software-manager/index.html.\n\nYou must add the following information in the Smart Software Manager:\n\n● Trusted Unique Identifier—This is the device ID (Secure Unique Device Identifier (SUDI)).\n\n● Organizational Identifier—This is a numerical format to associate a product with a Smart account or Virtual account.\n\n● Licenses consumed—Allows the Smart Software Manager to understand the license type and the level of consumption.\n\nSmart Call Home Overview\n\nNote: You must configure the DNS client and virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) before using Smart Call Home. For more information, see Configuring DNS Client and Configuring VRFs To Send Messages Using HTTP.\n\nUse the Smart Call Home feature to communicate with the Smart Software Manager. Smart Call Home is enabled automatically when you configure Smart Software Licensing. On Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Smart Software Licensing is not enabled by default.\n\nThe Smart Call Home (SCH) server runs on the Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM) satellite by default. You can access this service using the following URL:\n\nhttps://<CSSM satllite IP>/Transportgateway/services/DeviceRequestHandler\n\nProvide this URL as part of Smart Call Home configuration so that the device registration works with the CSSM satellite. For a sample configuration, see Configuration Examples for Smart Software Licensing.\n\nSmart Call Home creates a CiscoTAC-1 profile. The associated Smart Call Home messages are sent to the Smart Software Manager only after enabling Smart Call Home. For switches in which Smart Software Licensing is enabled by default, Smart Call Home is also enabled by default, along with the associated messages.\n\nTo disable Smart Software Licensing, see Disabling Smart Software Licensing.\n\nSmart Software Manager Satellite\n\nSmart Software Manager satellite is a component of Smart Software Licensing and works in conjunction with the Smart Software Manager to manage software licenses. You can intelligently manage product licenses and get near real-time visibility and reports pertaining to the Cisco licenses you purchased and consumed.\n\nIf you do not want to manage your installed base using a direct Internet connection, the Smart Software Manager satellite will be installed on your premises to provide a subset of the Smart Software Manager functionality. You can download the satellite application, deploy it, and register it with the Smart Software Manager.\n\nYou can perform the following functions using the satellite application on your premises:\n\n● Activate or register a license\n\n● Get visibility to your company's licenses\n\n● Transfer licenses between company entities\n\nTo learn more about the Smart Software Manager satellite, go to http://www.cisco.com/go/smartsatellite.\n\nAdditional References for Smart Software Licensing\n\nTable 26.Technical Assistance\n\nFeature History for Smart Software Licensing\n\nTable 27.Feature History\n\nSmart Software Licensing for Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches\n\nSmart Software Licensing Overview\n\nCisco Smart Licensing is a flexible licensing model that provides you with an easier, faster, and more consistent way to purchase and manage software across the Cisco portfolio and across your organization.

For more information, see Configuring DNS Client and Configuring VRFs to Send Messages.\n\nTraditional Licensing Overview\n\nTraditional licensing at Cisco is a legacy licensing model based on Product Activation Keys (PAKs) and Unique Device Identifiers (UDIs). On most Cisco NX-OS switches, capacity needs are assessed prior to obtaining and installing a .tar file on switches to retrieve the UDI. Customers place an order for a PAK, and the PAK is emailed to the user. The UDI and PAK are used to receive a license file that is installed in the boot directory of the switch to complete the installation of the Cisco NX-OS software.\n\nNote: Traditional license installation via Power On Auto Provisioning (POAP) ends with release 10.2(1).\n\nThe License Registration Portal (LRP) is available to help migrate traditional licenses to smart licenses. To access the LRP, obtain training, and manage licenses, go to http://tools.cisco.com/SWIFT/LicensingUI/Home.\n\nComparing Licensing Models\n\nTwo types of licensing models are used for the Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches: traditional licensing and Smart Software Licensing.\n\nTable 29.Comparison Between Traditional Licensing and Smart Software Licensing\n\nThe licensing mode changes based on the configuration provided. If Smart Software Licensing is enabled, all license requests are passed to the CSSM. If Smart Software Licensing is disabled, all license requests are fulfilled based on the license files installed on the device.\n\nGuidelines and Limitations for Smart Software Licensing\n\n● The smart license reservation command is not supported for Nexus 9000, although the command may still be found in old code.\n\n● If the switch has no connectivity to a CSSM server, the show running command may get stuck or may take up to 2 minutes to respond. We suggest that the CSSM server is always reachable when smart-licensing is enabled.\n\n● Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(3), all Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series switches (except the Cisco Nexus 3016 and 3064 platform switches) support Smart Software Licensing.\n\n● You cannot use both traditional licensing and Smart Software Licensing at the same time.\n\n● The FC_PORT_ACTIVATION_PKG license consumes the FC 48 ports entitlement tag regardless of the number of FC ports acquired (Cisco NX-OS 9.3(4) and earlier releases).\n\n● Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(5), when a term license is reserved and its term has expired, the license is still shown as Authorized with the show license usage command. In CSSM, alerts will continue and any new licenses from the same pool added to the virtual account are assigned to the reservation.\n\n● Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(5), disabling and enabling an installed feature when the license is in a “Not Authorized” state, the license no longer appears in the display of the license usage.\n\n● Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(5), the conversion of a traditional license to a Smart License using DLC (Device Led Conversion) on Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series switches, fails when performing additional subsequent Device Led Conversions.\n\n● Converting a traditional license to a Smart License — DLC fails unless licenses are installed in traditional mode (Cisco NX-OS 9.3(5) and later releases)\n\n● After converting a traditional license to a Smart License — DLC on a (On-Prem) device, the device does not receive a pass/fail response from the On-Prem Server. Manual synchronization of the On-Prem Server to CSSM might be required to get the return response to the device. (Cisco NX-OS 9.3(5) and later releases)\n\n● Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(5), the conversion of a traditional license to a Smart License using DLC (Device Led Conversion) is not supported on Cisco Nexus 3408-S switches.\n\n● License Borrowing — When license borrowing is calculated, compliance is accomplished in the quickest way possible. Typically, this means that license borrowing is from its immediate parent.\n\n● An alternative is considered if no licenses are found to be eligible to be borrowed from the immediate parent. If during a subsequent call, a device is found not be in compliance, a recalculation for optimization is done. The trigger for a completely optimized pool is a device that is potentially receiving OOC.\n\nAdditional References for Smart Software Licensing\n\nTable 30.Technical Assistance\n\nSmart Software Licensing using Policy for Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches (from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(1)F onwards)\n\nSoftware Licensing using Policy (SLP) Overview\n\nSmart Licensing Using Policy (SLP) is an enhanced version of Smart Licensing, the objective of which is to provide a licensing solution that does not interrupt the operations of your network and to enable a compliance relationship to account for the hardware and software licenses you purchase and use.\n\nSLP is supported starting with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(1). The primary benefits of this enhanced licensing model are:\n\nSeamless day-0 operations: After a license is ordered, no preliminary steps, such as registration or generation of keys, are required unless you use an export-controlled or enforced license. There are no export-controlled or enforced licenses on Cisco Nexus Switches, and product features can be configured on the device right-away.\n\nConsistency in Cisco NX-OS: Devices that run Cisco NX-OS software have a uniform licensing experience.\n\nVisibility and manageability: Tools, telemetry, and product tagging to know what in-use is.\n\nFlexible, time series reporting to remain compliant: Easy reporting options are available, whether you are directly or indirectly connected to Cisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM) or are in an air-gapped network.\n\nTo use Smart Licensing, you must first set up a Smart Account on Cisco Software Central (software.cisco.com).\n\nFor SLP configuration see the Cisco Smart Licensing Using Policy User Guide.\n\nFor a more detailed overview on Cisco Licensing, go to cisco.com/go/licensingguide.\n\nSmart Software Manager (CSSM)\n\nCisco Smart Software Manager (CSSM) is a portal that enables you to manage all your Cisco software licenses from a centralized location. CSSM helps you manage current requirements and review usage trends to plan for future license requirements.\n\nYou can access the CSSM Web UI at https://software.cisco.com. Navigate to Manage licenses link.\n\nSee the Supported Topologies section to know about the different ways in which you can connect to CSSM\n\nIn CSSM you can:\n\n● Create, manage, or view virtual accounts.\n\n● Create and manage Product Instance Registration Tokens.\n\n● Transfer licenses between virtual accounts or view licenses. • Transfer, remove, or view product instances.\n\n● Run reports against your virtual accounts.\n\n● Modify your email notification settings.\n\n● View overall account information.\n\nCisco Smart License Utility (CSLU)\n\nCisco Smart License Utility (CSLU) is a reporting utility that provides aggregate licensing workflows. This utility performs the following key functions:\n\n● Collects usage reports from the product instance and uploads these usage reports to the corresponding Smart Account or Virtual Account, online or offline, using files. Similarly, the RUM report ACK is collected online or offline and sent back to the product instance.\n\n● Sends authorization code requests to CSSM and receives authorization codes from CSSM, if applicable.\n\nCSLU can be part of your implementation in the following ways:\n\n● Install the Windows application to use CSLU as a standalone tool that is connected to CSSM.\n\n● Install the Windows application to use CSLU as a standalone tool that is disconnected from CSSM. With this option, the required aggerated usage information is downloaded to a file and then uploaded to CSSM. This is suited for air-gapped networks.\n\nSmart Software Manager On-Prem\n\nSoftware Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) is an asset manager, which works in conjunction with CSSM. It enables you to administer products and licenses on your premises instead of having to directly connect to CSSM.\n\nFor more information about SSM On-Prem, see Smart Software Manager On-Prem on the Software Download page.\n\nSmart Accounts and Virtual Accounts\n\nA Smart account provides you with a single location for all smart-account enabled products and licenses. It assists you in speedy procurement, deployment, and maintenance of your Cisco software.\n\nIf you are requesting a Smart account on behalf of an organization, you must have the authority to represent the requesting organization when creating a Smart account. After submitting the request, the request goes through an approval process before you are provided with access to your Smart account.\n\nGo to http://software.cisco.com to learn about, set up, and manage a Smart account.\n\nA virtual account is a subaccount within a Smart account. You can define the virtual account's structure based on organizational layout, business function, geography, or any defined hierarchy. Virtual accounts can be created and maintained only by Smart account administrators.\n\nSmart License using Policy Deployment Modes\n\nThe following figure illustrates the deployment modes of SLP.\n\nFigure 3. Smart Licensing using Policy deployment modes\n\nSupported Deployment Topologies for SLP\n\nSmart licensing using policy supports the following deployment topologies. These topologies can be selected by configuring the transport type after the upgrade. The default transport type will depend on the existing setup before migration.\n\n● Product instance connected to CSSM through CSLU. This is the default mode for new deployments and upgrades from PAK based licensing.\n\n● Product instance connected directly to CSSM\n\n● Product instance connected to CSLU and CSLU is not connected to CSSM. This is used for air-gapped networks. Aggregated usage report is downloaded from CSLU and uploaded to CSSM manually.\n\n● No connectivity to CSSM and no CSLU installed. (All communications are in the form of uploaded and downloaded files)\n\n● Connected to CSSM through (connected or disconnected) SSM On-Prem. (Instead of performing license management on cloud using CSSM, customers can do this locally using SSM On-Prem)\n\nSLP Greenfield and Brownfield Deployment Workflow\n\nFrom NX-OS 10.2.1 onwards, Smart License using Policy is the only supported way to manage licenses on the NX-OS platform.\n\nWhen you purchase a new device, Cisco recommends providing your Smart Account and Virtual Account (SA/VA) information when placing an order to simplify licence management. Cisco will assign all purchases to the respective account. Once devices are delivered, customers can start using them right away and no device registration is required. The devices will periodically report license consumption to CSSM based on set policy. The standard policy is to report once every 365 days or within 90 days of any change in feature consumption.\n\nThe following illustration shows the new deployment workflow for Smart license using Policy:\n\nFigure 4. Deployment workflow for SLP\n\nWhen you migrate to Smart Licensing using Policy, the product instance will continue to operate without any license changes. License reporting method is set based on the licensing model used before the upgrade.\n\nWhen you migrate from older version of Smart Licensing (SL) to Smart Licensing using Policy (SLP), devices will continue to use CALL HOME transport type for reporting after the upgrade as well.\n\nWhen you migrate from PAK based licenses to Smart Licensing using Policy (SLP), by default, device will look for a CSLU in the local environment to report license usage. These transport settings can be changed by running the command license smart transport {cslu | callhome | smart | off}.\n\nFor SLP configuration details, see Cisco Smart Licensing Using Policy User Guide, Release10.2(x).\n\nComparison between PAK-based Licensing and Smart License using Policy (SLP)\n\nTable 31.Comparison: PAK-Based Licensing and SLP\n\nComparison between Smart Licensing and Smart License using Policy (SLP)\n\nTable 32.Comparison: Smart Licensing and SLP\n\nGuidelines and Limitations\n\n● CSLU-initiated communication/pull mode is not supported in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(1).\n\nRefer to ‘Guidelines and Limitations’ section in Cisco Smart Licensing Using Policy User Guide for more details.\n\nAdditional Documentation\n\nFeature History for Smart Software Licensing using Policy\n\nLegal Information\n\nCisco and the Cisco logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Cisco and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and other countries.
