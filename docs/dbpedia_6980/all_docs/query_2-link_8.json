        "text": "A Spartan’s Sorrow by Hannah M. Lynn\n\nGenre: historical fiction\n\nI read it as a(n): ARC\n\nLength: 332 pp\n\nHer Grace’s rating: 4 stars\n\nEveryone knows at least the gist of the Trojan War and its major players – idiot Paris, Helen with her face that launched a thousand ships, brave Achilles and Odysseus, Menelaus and Agamemnon. Probably, too, people are more familiar with portrayals of Agamemnon’s wife, Clytemnestra, as a devious, selfish, and vengeful woman who gets her comeuppance in the fullness of time. Well, Hannah M. Lynn’s novel, A Spartan’s Sorrow, turns that portrayal right on its head. Instead, we see Clytemnestra as a complex figure, abused, grieving, and fiercely protective of her children.\n\nThe novel begins with Agamemnon’s fleet ready to set sail to Troy. The seas, however, are becalmed and nobody’s going anywhere until that changes. Turns out, Agamemnon pissed off the goddess Artemis when he killed a stag that was special to her. To appease Artemis and get her to return the wind to the seas, he sacrifices his eldest daughter with Clytemnestra, Iphigenia. Then off he pops to Troy for ten years, leaving his wife shattered with grief and 100% planning her revenge.\n\nDuring the course of the novel, we see behind the throne, as it were, into the inner workings of the Mycenean kingdom. Clytemnestra is that most terrifying character of all – a strong, brave, competent woman. She rules Mycenea fairly and efficiently, and in time her subjects come to regard her with tremendous respect. She is a single working mother of the ancient world in every respect that matters. She raises her children as fairly as she can, including supporting their interests, teaching them the ways of their social class, and fosters their love for their people. Even though she has plenty of cause to, Clytemnestra also never speaks badly of Agamemnon to her children, which should probably count as some kind of Herculean task. If my husband killed not only one of my children with him, but also my first husband and infant son, you can bet I would be telling everyone about it. Equatorial pygmies would know how I felt about him.\n\nSo once he kills Iphigenia, do you think Clytemnestra is just going to sit back and wait to see if he feels he needs to kill another one of his kids? No. No, she does not. Every single thing she does is to ensure the safety of her surviving children, no matter how difficult it is for her personally.\n\nI loved this book because it showed her in a much more realistic light. In most of literature, Clytemnestra is portrayed as being such a cow. In this book, she is a mother first and foremost. The things she thinks and feels and does are understandable to any woman who has children of her own. She is a complex, well-rounded figure in the book, not a one-dimensional, scheming villain. She is a flawed, realistic woman.\n\nSimilarly, the other characters are also very well-developed. Electra, her youngest daughter, evolves from a bold little girl to a young woman who despises her mother based on an incorrect assumption. And yet, she loves her little brother, Orestes, deeply and unconditionally. Orestes himself grows from a toddler to a young man and king in his own right, retaining his sweetness and gentleness but honing his political acumen to great effect.\n\nI definitely enjoyed this book and, even though it is listed as the second in a trilogy, it easily reads as a standalone. I enjoyed it enough that I may well go back and read the first one, which I believe focuses on Medusa. YASSSS, queen, give me all the feminist retellings, please!\n\nA version of this review was originally published in the Historical Novels Review.\n\nI Am Rome by Santiago Posteguillo\n\nGenre: historical fiction\n\nI read it as a(n): digital ARC\n\nLength: 634 pp\n\nHer Grace’s rating: 5 stars\n\nThe end of the Roman Republic was a time of great strife and even greater corruption. Members of the ruling classes clashed with the regular population in terms of what taxes and rights each social class had. A prime example of this corruption was Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella, close advisor to the dictator Sulla and governor of Macedonia. During his stint as governor, Dolabella abused his position to gain tremendous wealth, ignoring his duties in favor of abusing the people under his care and stealing taxes. He was charged in Rome with corruption, theft, and rape. However, since it was an age rife with general corruption, all of the jurors and judges were bribed to exonerate him. No one wanted to step into the role of prosecutor since doing so would not only effectively end a man’s political career but also very likely terminate his life. Except one young and inexperienced man decided he would do it. Gaius Julius Caesar was his name.\n\nThis novel was a 600+ page doorstopper – and I read it in just a few days. The story flowed rapidly and engaged my interest from page one. The novel’s structure was divided into sections dedicated to Dolabella’s trial mixed with flashbacks from various characters’ perspectives of events that led up to the trial over the course of many years. Readers are introduced to the main players and given glimpses into their motivations based on their experiences.\n\nThe action-heavy scenes and battles are vividly depicted and exciting. This is definitely the novel’s strength. Many techniques the Romans were famous for, such as the testudo formation, are described here in detail, enhancing the action without slowing it down. The military strategies used throughout the novel would be familiar to students of Rome or military history. To the uninitiated, these details merely add to the excitement of the moment.\n\nThe main drawback to Posteguillo’s novel is that there is little in the way of actual character development. Caesar largely remains the same throughout the book even though he is shown at various ages from childhood to early adulthood. Similarly, the dialogue is a little lacking and feels a bit stilted in places. It was great fun, though, to see Posteguillo’s young Caesar reflecting about how he will never be known as a military genius like his uncle Marius, or how he will never amount to anything if he loses the case against Dolabella. It is also always interesting when other real-life figures make appearances, such as Cicero here and there throughout the trial.\n\nI don’t usually look at any other reviews before I read a book, and I didn’t this time, either. I did, though, look at some after I finished. It seems that some readers felt the book was very inaccurate and played fast and loose with historical events. Normally I am a stickler for high fidelity in historical fiction since it will make historians happy and the rest of us won’t know any different. Perhaps this book is inaccurate, but I happily fall into the latter camp despite having taken 7 years of Latin throughout my college and grad school career. I just thought it was a great read and I would happily read more of Posteguillo’s works if they ever get translated into English.\n\nAll in all, I thought this was a highly enjoyable novel, even if it had some flaws and inaccuracies. Definitely recommended.\n\nThe Gentleman by Forrest Leo\n\nGenre: fantasy, I guess?\n\nI read it as a(n): audiobook\n\nNarrator: Samuel Roukin and John Keating\n\nLength: 7:56:00\n\nHer Grace’s rating: 4 stars\n\nImagine you are a writer. Maybe not a super successful one, maybe not the very best one, but a writer all the same. You make words on the page and sell them and people buy them and at least some of those people enjoy them and are eager to read the next words you put on the page and sell. You love what you do but then you discover that you’re broke and so you decide to find a lady and marry her just for her money. This effectively kills your muse and you don’t write for months. Then, during a dinner party you didn’t want to host, you accidentally sell your new wife to the devil – the Gentleman in question – and then, to your horror, discover that you actually are in love with her and now you have to go on a mission to get her back.\n\nThis is what happens to Lionel Savage, broke peer of the realm, mediocre poet, and failed but besotted husband. The book is told through Lionel’s essay on the adventure, with footnotes added by his editor (and cousin-by-marriage), Hubert Lancaster, who is possibly the best character in the book besides Simmons the butler.\n\nIf you are looking for a book that challenges your deeply-held beliefs or is a philosophical exploration on the mysteries of love, inspiration, and family dynamics, this is absolutely not the book for you! If you want a pseudo-Victorian historical fiction filled with duels, flying machines, secret societies, a soft-spoken Devil who uses Dante as a gardener, literary snobbery by one of the characters, derring-do, brutal British wit, and general madcap adventure in the vein os Pratchett, Wilde, or Wodehouse, then step right up!\n\nI haven’t laughed this hard at a book since the last Scalzi I read.\n\nFlights of Treason (Tesha #4) by Judith Starkston\n\nGenre: historical fantasy\n\nI read it as a(n): digital ARC\n\nLength: 522 pp\n\nHer Grace’s rating: 5 stars\n\nFlights of Treason, the 4th and final book in Judith Starkston’s Tesha historical fantasy series, takes place about 3 years after the end of book 3, Of Kings and Griffins. Queen Tesha of Alpara and her husband, King Hattu, are facing off against Hattu’s corrupt and incompetent nephew, Great King Urhi. Adding to this already tense political situation is the fact that Traj, one of the griffin cubs from the previous book, has been lured to Hattusa where he was bound with evil magic and nearly killed. The griffin king is enraged by the harm to his son and vows to kill the sorceror who hurt Traj. Unfortunately, that sorceror appears to be Tesha and Hattu’s 4-year-old daughter, Arinnel. Magic, demons, griffins, and more converge into this exciting final novel in the Tesha series!\n\nI loved this book so much! In the spirit of full transparency, Judith is a friend of mine. However, that doesn’t change the fact that this was an awesome read. The characters all have a great deal of growth throughout this book as well as the series overall. Tesha has tremendous guilt about her magic, which is powerful, but she refuses to use it to its full potential because of the inadvertent damage it did to Arinnel in the womb. (For that story, you’ll need to read book 2, Sorcery in Alpara.) Tesha tries to do what she can to help without using magic, and she has to work through her feelings of guilt and fear to become the queen she needs to be. Her reluctance to use her magic causes some tension with Hattu, particularly when it comes to using it to force his nephew, Urhi, to become a better king. I liked this because it felt like an actual issue that causes couples to get mad at each other in real life. It wasn’t Big Drama, it wasn’t hugely emotional or a cause to worry that Tesha and Hattu were going to call it quits. It was just one of those things that happens to any couple on occasion, and it made the novel feel that much more relatable.\n\nTesha’s older, blind sister, Daniti, has a big role as well. Her previous bond with the griffins and her ability to speak telepathically to them over great distances plays a vital role in the conflict between humans and griffins. Arinnel shares her aunt’s telepathic abilities, a source of tremendous joy to both of them most of the time. Arinnel, though, has blocked Daniti out of her thoughts and, because of this, everyone fears that that little girl was, in fact, responsible for the grievous injuries the griffin cub Traj suffered.\n\nMarak, Hattu’s second in command and Daniti’s husband, has a slightly smaller role in this than he did in previous books, but his role remains important. He is almost as brilliant a military strategist as Hattu himself, and Marak’s diplomatic bonds with the Paskans comes into play in a very big way. I have a soft spot for Marak. He always strikes me as sort of a protective big brother who seems fierce but is all squishy around the edges.\n\nFlights of Treason is filled with exciting battles ranging from fighting with human armies, facing off against sorcerors, or making a stand against fantastical beasts. These scenes are all vividly depicted and they played out like a movie in my mind.\n\nStarkston absolutely excels at the historical details in this book, as she does in all her other books as well. The series might be marketed as historical fantasy, but it is solidly based in actual Hittite history. Many of the spells and incantations are actual documented parts of ceremonies and rituals found on clay tablets from the Hittite Empire. Her skill lies in taking those snippets of historical fact and weaving them into a fascinating new story that is both unique and also remains true to the remarkable, ancient people who provided the inspiration.\n\nI have said for years and years that sci-fi/fantasy is an ideal medium in which to discuss real-world issues. Flights of Treason is no different. I love the themes of fighting for one’s home, doing what needs doing even if it scares the crap out of you, and going through self-discovery to become who you are really supposed to be. These are all things that people in the real world need to do at one point or another. Maybe we don’t battle actual griffins in our life, but we sure as hell battle our own inner demons. We do things that scare us because we need to do them. We learn to define what “home” means to each of us, and then fight to keep it safe. There are so many things we do in real life that are explored in fantasy novels, barely hidden beneath the veneer of magic. In a well-written fantasy such as this, it is easy to find ourselves in the pages even as we get lost in the story.\n\nOne more thing that I really loved about this book was actually the ending. Starkston did what I wish more authors of series could do: she gave a satisfying ending with no loose threads left, didn’t make those endings feel like an afterthought by rushing through them, and yet still left openings to return to the series later if she decides to. I honestly am not sure of any other authors that I have personally read who managed to pull that off so well! Because I am a selfish creature, I want MORE Tesha books, but if such is not meant to be, then the way this one ended is the ideal way to conclude the series.\n\nAs with the three preceding books in the series, I highly recommend Flights of Treason for the amazing world-building, complex characters, and fascinating historical details woven into every page. You will not be sorry you read this!\n\nThorn Hedge by T. Kingfisher\n\nGenre: fantasy\n\nI read it as a(n): hardback\n\nLength: 116 pp\n\nHer Grace’s rating: 4 stars\n\nA retelling of “Sleeping Beauty,” Thorn Hedge asks, “What if Briar Rose slept not because she was cursed but to protect everybody else?” Not all curses should be broken, as the blurb says, and it’s true. Kingfisher takes a beloved fairy tale and breathes new life into it. I loved everything about this story – the atmosphere, the self-discovery, and the anxiety it gave me to think about what might happen if the Princess woke up. Also, I think there needs to be a cat at some point in my future that I will name Toadling.\n\nHell Followed With Us by Andrew Joseph White\n\nGenre: SF\n\nI read it as a(n): paperback\n\nLength: 398 pp\n\nHer Grace’s rating: 3 stars\n\nI had read White’s second book, The Spirit Bares Its Teeth, a while back and loved it. My daughter read this one first and begged me to read it, too, so I did. I enjoyed it but I was kind of grossed out. I dig a good cult book and escaping from said cult, but the body horror in this one was over the top. I loved the characters, though, and the dynamics between them all.\n\nThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet by Becky Chambers\n\nGenre: SF\n\nI read it as a(n): paperback\n\nLength: 441 pp\n\nHer Grace’s rating: 5 stars\n\nI’ve had this one on my TBR for several years and I don’t know what took me so long to get around to reading it. I loved it! In some ways, it felt a bit like a more lighthearted version of The Expanse books. Not in terms of plot at all, but more in the sense of found family. It had enough action but also plenty of terrific world-building and character development.\n\nHappy March, friends. I like to call it Middle Earth March. I specifically look forward to March 25th each year. In the Tolkienverse, it’s the Gondorian New Year, the day Sauron fell, the One Ring was destroyed, and the beginning of the Fourth Age of Gondor. It’s often celebrated as Tolkien Reading Day, the theme of which this year is “Service and Sacrifice.” March 25 is also my almost-birthday. On this day, I fix many meals – first and second breakfast, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, and supper – and hole up with a Tolkien book. Ha ha, get it? In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit? Anyway. Sometimes I reread an old favorite and revisit The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings. Other times, I’ll pick a less familiar work. It’s been probably 20 years and more since I read The Silmarillion, and I have only read Leaf by Niggle but once. Might be the year for that. Who knows? I did read The Fellowship of the Ring to my daughter for the first time a couple years ago. She was ten at the time and was mightily impressed that Frodo gets to go on a quest and see the elves and all. I think she will never forgive me for not warning her that Gandalf falls in Moria, though. She’s still mad at me for not warning her. But what could I do? I couldn’t spoil it for her. On the Gondorian New Year, I’ll definitely make all the food for her. I’m determined to make her a Tolkien fan and so far, my plan seems to be working.\n\nAs a lifelong Tolkien fan myself, it is natural for me to reread the books every few years. Each time, I discover something entirely new in them. I’ve always changed in some way between readings, grown older, hopefully a little wiser, and so I pick up new things in the text. It’s like an English trifle, each reading revealing a hidden layer to reveal some new treasure within. It’s delightful. I honestly don’t know if it is just because I love Tolkien’s works so much, or if they are just that rich, or what, because there are any number of other books that I adore and reread often but don’t find that much new in them upon rereading. In any case, there are many life lessons I have learned from Tolkien’s works. Just a few of the ones I have found to be the most meaningful are below. Continue reading “Middle Earth March: Life Lessons from Tolkien” →\n\nThe Salt Path by Raynor Winn\n\nGenre: memoir\n\nI read it as a(n): audiobook\n\nNarrator: Raynor Winn\n\nLength: 09:00:00\n\nHer Grace’s rating: 5 stars\n\nRaynor Winn and her husband, Moth, are in their 50s when they lose everything due to a bad business scheme their friend got them into. They find themselves with no home, no business, no money, and no one able to help. On top of all that, Moth is diagnosed with a terminal degenerative illness just days after they lost everything else. So they pack their backpacks and set off to walk the South West Coastal Path, a 600+ mile trail around the Cornish peninsula. Just like any normal person would (WARNING: sarcasm detected). Having lost all their savings, they are dependent upon the miniscule amount of government funds they’re entitled to, which is something like £20 per week.\n\nI first became aware of this book because of an article I saw that said it was being filmed and is starring Jason Isaacs and Gillian Anderson. BOTH of my celebrity crushes in the SAME MOVIE OMFG *FLAIL* WHEN CAN I WATCH IT??\n\nHere’s the thing, though. After reading it, it doesn’t even matter to me if Jason and Gillian are starring. At this point, I would have watched it no matter who was in the film. They could have cast Adam Sandler (shudder) and Gwyneth Paltrow (double shudder) and I would still watch it. That’s because I already know this book will top out in my 5 favorite reads of 2024.\n\nI read this book a few weeks ago and I still can’t get it out of my head. I felt so bad for Ray and Moth. I can’t imagine how hurt and scared they must have been to be screwed over like they were by a “friend” or how unfair the legal system was to them (they had proof they were not at fault but weren’t allowed to use it because they didn’t submit a form exactly right WTF). Also, how awful it must have been for Moth to carry on when his body was betraying him.\n\nOne thing that struck me throughout the book was the casual cruelty they experienced. They could be sitting by themselves, bothering nobody, in a public park, and someone often would come along and tell them they’re disgusting for being drunk in public or sleeping in public or being crazy in public or whatever the fuck. Nevermind the fact that they were not drunk or stoned or anything like that, and they were homeless. There aren’t enough shelters or space in the existing ones. Where the fuck are they supposed to sleep, the Savoy? And what kind of judgmental jerk automatically assumes that if a person is homeless, they must also be an addict, criminal, or mental patient of some kind? I guess being poor in public is also frowned upon. The fact that these were educated, productive members of society prior to their devastating loss apparently never even occurred to any of the people who gave them grief. Also? I don’t know about you but if I were homeless, numbing all of that with drugs and alcohol probably would seem like an excellent idea.\n\nI think the thing that made me feel the worst to hear about was when they were laying in their tent in the early morning (in a location where it is perfectly fine to pitch a tent) and waiting to get the day started when a random hiker and his dog both take a piss on their tent. I mean, who the fuck DOES that? What kind of asshole do you have to be to piss, literally, on someone’s home? See, this is an example of why I should never become a Jedi. If I had the Force, there is a 100% chance I would use it to give instant karma to assholes like that. Want to pee on someone’s tent? Cool – instant, antibiotic-resistant UTI for you. Maybe a scorching case of jock itch as well. Enjoy it, dickweed.\n\nAll that is to say that this book correctly challenges the perceptions much of society has towards people who are marginalized, whether they are unhoused, addicted, mentally ill, or anything else. People without homes are still people. People with addictions are still people. People who are impoverished are still people. The fact that this needs to be said is a pathetic indictment on humanity as a whole.\n\nThat said, they also did encounter many people who were kind and helpful along the way. Some of them were also walking the south west coast path and they ran into them more than once, though those people were all walking on vacation and only had so many days before they got into a car and drove back home. While they were generally kind and eager to share, it seemed like that was a painful encounter as well since Ray and Moth had no home to go to when they were cold or hungry or sick. Listening to it felt a little like rubbing salt in the wound.\n\nThe book is also an exploration of home and what makes a home. Initially, home was their lost farm, the place where their kids had been born and grew up, where all their things were. By the end, home was simply with each other. They learned that they needed far less than they ever thought, and got by on less than that even though it was out of necessity. As long as they were together, that was really all they needed. That was home and they can take it with them anywhere they go.\n\nFAVORITE QUOTE\n\nWe were lightly salted blackberries, hanging in the last of the summer sun, and this perfect moment was the only one we needed.\n\nSince I decided to make my own reading challenge for 2024, I figured it is a good idea to figure out which books I might want to use to complete the tasks. I’m going to see how many of my own TBR books I can use, first, and how many I can do with women/LGBTQ+/BIPOC authors for as many as I can. Below are some suggestions for each task. Double-dipping is totally allowed!\n\nAlso, as I researched for books to complete these tasks, I learned that I need better definitions for some things, or that some others could be worded differently, or be defined in a broader way. Sorry about that! I will try to do better for next year’s tasks.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for any of the tasks, please share them in the comments!

Dr. Culber had been standing in as the counselor for the crew, but now that they’re at a starbase, a temporary replacement counselor has been assigned. Then they all get sent out to continue their mission of reconnecting with formerly allied planets that had been cut off from the Burn. They answer a distress signal and discover a ship of Xaheans, staunch allies of the Federation in the 22nd century. Only now, the Xaheans have by necessity become a wandering society and are isolationist on the verge of xenophobia. Capt Burnham has to try her hand at diplomacy to resolve a potentially deadly situation from exploding, and taking her ship and crew with it.\n\nI have never taken so long to read a Star Trek book in my life. I was carting this around with me for the better part of a month! It was barely 300 pages, it should have taken me maybe a week even with work. It was. So. S L O W. I have never DNFed a Trek book but I came very close to doing so on this one. It was so out of character for Dayton Ward’s novels that it was kind of shocking how fucking bored I was with this one. It felt like he wrote himself into a corner and had no options for resolution other than cheesy and unbelievable ones.\n\nThe overarching theme in the story is, of course, finding where one belongs. Ward explores the topics of what makes a home, how we create a found family, if home is a place or a feeling, and so on. At times, the exploration was a bit ham-handed. It felt sermony, which is usually reserved for Burnham although she managed to refrain from sermonizing this time.\n\nAlso, this is kind of a weird observation. To be fair, I haven’t read every Trek book Ward has written so I could be wrong. But this book makes me think that he does not know how to write gay male characters. Stamets and Culber were definitely not right in this book. They were always saying something petulant or acting moody. Even though the characters recognized that and corrected it, it was still the first thing that was described. None of the other characters were handled that way. Maybe he just doesn’t like Culber or Stamets, which is fine if so. We don’t have to like all the characters. But I hope he figures out how to write those two characters better if he writes more Discovery books in the future. And I DO hope he does! He wrote Drastic Measures, which is one of my favorite Disco books, partly because it focused mainly on a young Lieutenant Gabriel Lorca, and he’s played by Jason Isaacs who I’m in love with. And partly because of that little tidbit at the very end that was obviously a confused and scared Prime Lorca stuck in the MU and I want to read that story!"
