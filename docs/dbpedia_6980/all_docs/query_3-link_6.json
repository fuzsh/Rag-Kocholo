        "text": "When you're spoken to they will always speak in English, this is common enough (although uncommon in that you're in the UK and they're speaking French).\n\nAt the end of the day this doesn't have to impact on your work, I live in a country where they all speak the vernacular, I know the language now, but didn't when I started. And I work with teams in other languages including French. Lots of people are in your situation.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with politely asking them to speak English if they forget or if you need clarification.\n\nIt's also an opportunity to do something useful for yourself. When I first came here I didn't speak the language, I'm fluent now though. But, and this is the thing, most people from overseas never learn beyond a few words even those here for decades and married to locals. So I always speak English and overhear a LOT of stuff that is useful to me because they don't realise I understand everything they're saying. It's quite amusing to listen to some of the things they say to foreigners secure in the knowledge that the foreigner doesn't have a clue. It has been very useful for me anyway in many facets of life.\n\nYou are fighting an uphill battle. Speaking a native language is so much easier that getting them to change is fighting a most basic human impulse. You are in a bilingual workplace; people are going to speak the dominant language. I'm not saying it's impossible, but your options are to either remind them constantly and become the office nag, or start learning French.\n\nHowever, what you consider an aggravation may in fact be a great opportunity to learn a second language, the more so because you have people to practice with. Many people learn a second language, but quickly become rusty because they lack practice. But you are thrust into a situation every day where you have ample opportunity to practice.\n\nAn easy way to begin learning a conversational language is to start watching TV in that language. At first with subtitles, but over time without. Also, language learning software can be helpful since you have people to practice against. If you are a white-collar / professional, you can probably make the case for spending 15 minutes of work time per day learning the dominant language. Tell you boss it will have a dramatic impact on your ability to work with your coworkers and bring value to the business.\n\nFinally, you may find that if you make an effort, your coworkers will reciprocate. It is always endearing to people when outsiders make an effort to learn their language and culture. If you make a little effort to engage them in their language, they may meet you halfway and engage with you in yours.\n\nThe other members of your team are comfortable conversing in French which is why they chose to use it when talking amongst themselves. They are not trying to exclude you; French is their comfort zone and people like to stay within their comfort zones if possible. In the same way, English is your comfort zone and you prefer using English to converse.\n\nHave you considered trying to incorporate activities in your extracurricular activities to learn a new language? This combines activities you already do with learning French to better communicate with your co-workers in a place they are comfortable.\n\nFor example, my favorite way to improve my listening comprehension and vocabulary in a new language is to find a TV show or movie and watch it in the foreign language with my native language as subtitles. This helps pair the words I hear with the words I read.\n\nAnother way is to ask your coworkers if they could teach you a little French when you have downtime at work. This builds a relationship between you and your coworker and gives you a different way to connect with them outside of group events and discussions.\n\nWhy do I ask if you can find a way to learn French? It shows you are willing to bridge the communication gap. When you ask politely if your coworkers can please use English because your French language skills are not yet on par with the conversation, they will be more understanding and sympathetic to your situation because you are trying. People are more willing to assist or agree to a request when they see the other party is reaching out to them on their terms rather than issuing a proposal.\n\n@Kilisi also makes a good point, this is an excellent time to start learning French yourself. As our world becomes more diverse, a second language, even at a novice level, is a great tool to have professionally."
