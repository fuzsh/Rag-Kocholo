        "text": "Guidance for Undergraduate Students in the Department\n\nProgram Planning for all Students\n\nStudents who entered Columbia (as first‐year students or as transfer students) in or after Fall 2024 may select from a curriculum of majors and minors. The requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree, and role of majors and minors in those requirements, can be found in the Academic Requirements section of the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student matriculated at Columbia and the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student was a sophomore and declared programs of study.\n\nStudents who entered Columbia in or before Fall 2023 may select from a curriculum of majors and minors and concentrations. The requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree, and the role of majors and minors in those requirements, can be found in the Academic Requirements section of the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student matriculated at Columbia and the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student was a sophomore and declared programs of study.\n\nThe program of study is to be planned as early as possible with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students are advised to meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies each semester in order to obtain program approval.\n\nCourse Numbering Structure\n\nWith the exception of conversation courses, Elementary language classes are UN1XXX, Intermediate language classes are UN2XXX, and Advanced language classes are UN3XXX. (Conversation courses do not count toward the Major or the Minor and all start with UN1XXX, regardless of level.) Any literature, culture or history courses at the 4XXX level start with GU and are suitable for undergraduate students as well as graduate students. Undergraduate literature, culture or history courses start with UN3XXXX.\n\nGuidance for First-Year Students\n\nFor students pursuing an Italian Major or Minor the prerequisite is Intermediate II or a demonstrated equivalent level of knowledge of the Italian language.\n\nFor students who have no prior knowledge of Italian, the required sequence is Elementary Italian I & II (UN1101-UN1102) or Intensive Elementary Italian (UN1121) and Intermediate Italian I & II (UN2101-UN2102) or Intensive Intermediate Italian (UN2121).\n\nStudents with prior knowledge of Italian must take the Italian placement exam before declaring the Italian Major or Minor. Students may be exempted from the language requirement in Italian in one of three ways: a) by presenting a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Italian Exam; b) by presenting a score of 780 or above on the SAT Subject Test in Italian; c) by obtaining a satisfactory score on the department’s placement examination\n\nGuidance for Transfer Students\n\nTransfer students pursuing an Italian Major or Minor may need to enroll in Intensive Italian courses (ITAL UN1121 Intensive Elementary Italian; ITAL UN2121 Intensive Intermediate Italian) in order to fulfill the language prerequisite in time.\n\nDouble-counting Guidelines for All Students\n\nIf a student decides to pursue more than one program of study, the student’s declared programs of study may not both be governed by the same department. For example, a student may not declare a Major or a Minor in Italian and a Minor in Mediterranean Studies.\n\nStudents may double-count courses taken to fulfill the Language requirement and the Global Core requirement toward programs of Study (Italian Major and Minor, and Minor in Mediterranean Studies). Note: The shared courses of the Core Curriculum—specifically, Art Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Frontiers of Science, Literature Humanities, Music Humanities, and University Writing—may not be double-counted with any major or minor.\n\nIn addition to double-counting any courses described above, students pursuing two programs of study may double-count a maximum of two classes of any type, if the classes are approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies to fulfill a requirement for each program of study.\n\nUndergraduate Programs of Study\n\nMajor in Italian\n\nThe Major in Italian offers students in-depth knowledge of Italian language, literature, history, and culture from the Middle Ages to the present. Through a cluster of courses from the Italian Department, as well as other Humanities and Social Science departments and approved study abroad programs, the Major in Italian seeks to enhance students’ knowledge of Italy in a globalized world.\n\nThe learning goals of the Major in Italian are therefore: 1) to give students an advanced knowledge of the Italian language; and 2) to help students gain a deeper understanding of the literature, culture and history of Italy.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Major in Italian requires a minimum of 30 points (10 courses).\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe 30 required points (10 courses) do not include the necessary prerequisites, i.e. Intermediate II or a demonstrated equivalent level of knowledge of the Italian language.\n\nFor students who have no prior knowledge of Italian, the required sequence to cover the prerequisite is Elementary Italian I & II (UN1101-UN1102) and Intermediate Italian I & II (UN2101-UN2102), or Intensive Elementary Italian (ITAL UN1121) and Intensive Intermediate Italian (ITAL UN2121), or a combination between a regular sequence and an intensive course. Therefore, for a student who must take all coursework at Columbia (i.e., who does not enter Columbia with advanced placement) the overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Major is 14 (46 points, 16 of which count also toward the Language requirement). However, the overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Major becomes either 12 if the student chooses the Intensive Elementary & Intermediate Italian option (42 points, 12 of which count also toward the Language requirement), or 13 if the student chooses a combination between a regular sequence and an intensive course (44 points, 14 of which count also toward the Language requirement).\n\nHowever, students with prior knowledge of Italian may be exempted from the prerequisites in one of three ways: a) by presenting a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Italian Exam; b) by presenting a score of 780 or above on the SAT Subject Test in Italian; c) by obtaining a satisfactory score on the department’s placement examination. Therefore, for them the overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Major is 10 (30 points).\n\nRequired Courses\n\nItalian majors are required to take two sequences: a) a sequence of Advanced Italian Language courses and b) a sequence of courses in Italian Literature or Cultural Studies:\n\nAdvanced Italian Language (this sequence should be taken in progressive order)\n\n• Advanced Italian (ITAL UN3335). Advanced reading, writing, speaking with emphasis on authentic cultural materials. Topic and semester themes vary. Taught in Italian.\n\n• Italian Language through Content. Course offerings under this category include courses such as: Italian through Cinema (ITAL UN3337); Italiana. Introduction to Italian Culture, the High, the Low, and the In-between (ITAL UN3338); Learning Italian in Class and Online: A Telecollaboration with Italy (ITAL UN3339); Art Itineraries: Italian through Art (ITAL UN3341); Business Italian and the Made in Italy Excellence: Learning Italian for trade and industry (ITAL UN3342); Advanced Italian: Comparative Stylistics & Translation (ITAL UN3343); Italy: Emigration-Immigration (ITAL UN3232); and Grand Tour in Italy (ITAL UN3645). These are all courses of Advanced Italian Language through a specific subject and with emphasis on cultural content. Taught in Italian.\n\nand\n\nItalian Literature or Cultural Studies\n\nIntroduction to Italian Literature I and II (ITAL UN3333-4) provides an overview of major authors and works in the Italian literary tradition from the Middle Ages to the present. Taught in Italian. (This sequence does not need to be taken in progressive order.)\n\nor\n\nItalian Cultural Studies I and II (ITAL GU4502-3). An interdisciplinary investigation into Italian culture and society from national unification in 1860 to the present. Taught in English. (This sequence does not need to be taken in progressive order.)\n\nElective Courses\n\nWith the permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Italian majors select six additional courses from the department’s 3000- or 4000-level offerings or from other Humanities and Social Science departments with a focus on Italian culture, society and history from the Middle Ages to the present (at least 50% of the material of courses offered outside of the Italian Department should focus on Italian topics). Students who have taken courses in Italian Literature, Italian History, and/or Italian Culture while abroad should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to determine if the courses may be applicable to the Major.\n\nHighly motivated students have the opportunity to pursue a senior thesis under the guidance of a faculty adviser in an area of Italian literature or culture of their choosing. The senior thesis tutorial (ITAL UN3993 Senior Thesis/Tutorial) will count for 3 points.\n\nMajors in Italian are required to take at least two of the six elective courses from the Italian Department’s offerings, which are not Language Through Content courses. The remaining four elective courses can include Language Through Content courses or offerings from other Humanities and Social Science departments and study abroad Programs.\n\nStudents pursuing an Italian Major should download and use the relevant worksheet.\n\nMinor in Italian\n\nThe Minor in Italian is a smaller and more flexible course of study aiming to introduce students to Italian language, literature, history, and culture from the Middle Ages to the present day. Through a cluster of courses from the Italian Department, as well as from other Humanities and Social Science departments and approved study abroad programs, the Minor in Italian seeks to enhance students’ knowledge of Italy in a globalized world.\n\nThe learning goals of the Minor in Italian are therefore: 1) to give students an advanced-level knowledge of the Italian language; and 2) to help students gain a deeper understanding of the literature, culture, and history of Italy.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Minor in Italian requires a minimum of 15 points (5 courses).\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe 15 required points (5 courses) do not include the necessary prerequisites, i.e., Intermediate II or a demonstrated equivalent level of knowledge of the Italian language.\n\nFor students who have no prior knowledge of Italian, the required sequence to cover the prerequisite is Elementary Italian I & II (UN1101-UN1102) and Intermediate Italian I & II (UN2101-UN2102), or Intensive Elementary Italian (ITAL UN1121) and Intensive Intermediate Italian (ITAL UN2121), or a combination between a regular sequence and an intensive course. Therefore, for a student who must take all coursework at Columbia (i.e., who does not enter Columbia with advanced placement) the overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Minor is 9 (31 points, 16 of which count also toward the Language requirement). However, the overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Major becomes either 7 if the student chooses the Intensive Elementary & Intermediate Italian option (27 points, 12 of which count also toward the Language requirement), or 8 if the student chooses a combination between a regular sequence and an intensive course (29 points, 14 of which count also toward the Language requirement)\n\nHowever, students with prior knowledge of Italian may be exempted from the prerequisites in one of three ways: a) by presenting a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Italian Exam; b) by presenting a score of 780 or above on the SAT Subject Test in Italian; c) by obtaining a satisfactory score on the department’s placement examination. Therefore, for them the overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Minor is 5 (15 points).\n\nRequired Courses\n\nItalian minors are required to take one of the following course sequences: a) Advanced Italian Language; b) Italian Literature; c) Italian Cultural Studies:\n\nAdvanced Italian Language (this sequence should be taken in progressive order)\n\n• Advanced Italian (ITAL UN3335). Advanced reading, writing, speaking with emphasis on authentic cultural materials. Topic and semester themes vary. Taught in Italian.\n\n• Italian Language through Content. Course offerings under this category include courses such as: Italian through Cinema (ITAL UN3337); Italiana. Introduction to Italian Culture, the High, the Low, and the In-between (ITAL UN3338); Learning Italian in Class and Online: A Telecollaboration with Italy (ITAL UN3339); Art Itineraries: Italian through Art (ITAL UN3341); Business Italian and the Made in Italy Excellence: Learning Italian for trade and industry (ITAL UN3342); Advanced Italian: Comparative Stylistics & Translation (ITAL UN3343); Italy: Emigration-Immigration (ITAL UN3232); and Grand Tour in Italy (ITAL UN3645). These are all courses of Advanced Italian Language through a specific subject and with emphasis on cultural content. Taught in Italian.\n\nor\n\nItalian Literature\n\nIntroduction to Italian Literature I and II (ITAL UN3333-4) provides an overview of major authors and works in the Italian literary tradition from the Middle Ages to the present. Taught in Italian. (This sequence does not need to be taken in progressive order.)\n\nor\n\nItalian Cultural Studies\n\nItalian Cultural Studies I and II (ITAL GU4502-3). An interdisciplinary investigation into Italian culture and society from national unification in 1860 to the present. Taught in English. (This sequence does not need to be taken in progressive order.)\n\nElective Courses\n\nIn addition to one of the above sequences, students pursuing the Minor in Italian will be asked to select three courses from the department’s 3000- or 4000-level offerings or from other Humanities and Social Science departments with a focus on Italian culture, society and history from the Middle Ages to the present (at least 50% of the material of courses offered outside of the Italian Department should focus on Italian topics). Minors in Italian are required to take at least one of the three elective courses within the Italian Department’s offerings which are not Language Through Content Courses, chosen in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\n\nStudents pursuing an Italian Minor should download and use the relevant worksheet.\n\nMinor in Mediterranean Studies\n\nThe Minor in Mediterranean Studies is a flexible course of study intended to introduce students to the various facets of the Mediterranean Sea from a cross-disciplinary perspective. Drawing on courses from within the Italian Department as well as departments and units across the university, the program seeks to enhance students’ understanding of this culturally diverse and politically important region of the world. It offers them the opportunity to explore the connections among the peoples living in this geographic area over a broad chronological span—from prehistoric times to the present—and to focus on issues that go beyond specific nations, cultures, and states, such as migration, cultural transfers, diversity, multilingualism, translation, border crossing, empires and colonialism, circulation of goods and ideas, islands, the physical environment, and resource management. The learning goals of the Minor in Mediterranean Studies are therefore: 1) to give students vital tools for thinking about the world from the perspective of an interconnected sea space and through a comparative and transnational point of view; and 2) to help students gain a deeper understanding of the history, and culture of the Mediterranean through an interdisciplinary path of study. Upon completion of the Minor, students should be able to have a basic knowledge of the ways in which the Mediterranean Sea has served over time as a medium of contact, exchange, and interaction among multiple societies, nations, religions, and languages, and use this knowledge to reconsider global relations in the world today.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Minor in Mediterranean Studies requires a minimum of 15 points (5 courses).\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThere are no prerequisites.\n\nRequired Courses\n\nMinors in Mediterranean Studies are required to take the following two-semester sequence (not necessarily taken in progressive order). This sequence also fulfills the Global Core requirement:\n\nMediterranean Humanities I (CLIA GU4499)\n\nCourse description: Mediterranean Humanities I explores the literatures of the Mediterranean from the late Middle Ages to the Early Nineteenth Century. We will read Boccaccio, and Cervantes, as well as Ottoman poetry, Iberian Muslim apocalyptic literature, and the Eurasian connected versions of the One Thousand and One Nights. We will dive into the travel of texts and people, stories and storytellers across the shores of the Middle Sea. Based on the reading of literary texts (love poetry, short stories, theater, and travel literature), as well as letters, biographies, memoirs, and other ego-documents produced and consumed in the Early Modern Mediterranean, we will discuss big themes such as Orientalism, estrangement, forced mobility, connectivity, multiculturalism and the clash of civilizations. Also, following in the footsteps of Fernand Braudel and Erich Auerbach, we will reflect on the Mediterranean in the age of the first globalization as a laboratory of the modern global world and world literature.\n\nMediterranean Humanities II (CLIA GU4500)\n\nCourse description: What is the Mediterranean and how was it constructed and canonized as a space of civilization? A highly multicultural, multilingual area whose people represent a broad array of religious, ethnic, social and political differences, the Mediterranean has been seen as the cradle of western civilization, but also as a dividing border and a unifying confluence zone: as a sea of pleasure and a sea of death. The course aims to enhance students’ understanding of the multiple ways this body of water has been imagined by the people who lived or traveled across its shores. By exploring major works of theory, literature and cinema since 1800, it encourages students to engage critically with a number of questions (nationalism vs cosmopolitanism, South/North and East/West divides, tourism, exile and migration, colonialism and orientalism, borders and divided societies) and to ‘read’ the sea through different viewpoints. In the final analysis, Med Hum II is meant to engage the question of what it means to stand on watery grounds and to view the world through a constantly shifting lens.\n\nElective Courses\n\nIn addition to these two Global Core courses, students pursuing the Minor in Mediterranean Studies will take three elective courses. One should be from the Mediterranean offerings of the Italian Department, while the other two can be from other departments and units across the university. The approved courses should adopt a Mediterranean transnational, comparative or regional perspective, engage with issues on a cross-Mediterranean scale (such as migration, cultural transfers, translation, borders, contacts and conflicts, empires and colonialism, islands, circulation of goods and ideas, common environmental and resource management questions), or place their particular topics within a Mediterranean framework (at least 50% of the course material should fulfill these requirements). Students pursuing a Minor in Mediterranean Studies should download and use the relevant worksheet.\n\nFor students who entered Columbia in or before the 2023-24 academic year\n\nConcentrations are available to students who entered Columbia in or before Fall 2023. The requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree, and the role of the concentration in those requirements, can be found in the Academic Requirements section of the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student matriculated at Columbia and the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student was a sophomore and declared programs of study. Concentrations are not available to students who entered Columbia in or after Fall 2024.\n\nConcentration in Italian\n\nThe Concentration in Italian requires a minimum of 24 points (8 courses).\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe 24 required points (8 courses) do not include the necessary prerequisites, i.e., Intermediate II or a demonstrated equivalent level of knowledge of the Italian language.\n\nFor students who have no prior knowledge of Italian, the required sequence to cover the prerequisite is Elementary Italian I & II (UN1101-UN1102) and Intermediate Italian I & II (UN2101-UN2102), or Intensive Elementary Italian (ITAL UN1121) and Intensive Intermediate Italian (ITAL UN2121), or a combination between a regular sequence and an intensive course. Therefore, for a student who must take all coursework at Columbia (i.e., who does not enter Columbia with advanced placement) the overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Concentration is 12 (40 points, 16 of which count also toward the Language requirement). However, the overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Major becomes either 10 if the student chooses the Intensive Elementary & Intermediate Italian option (36 points, 12 of which count also toward the Language requirement), or 11 if the student chooses a combination between a regular sequence and an intensive course (38 points, 14 of which count also toward the Language requirement).\n\nHowever, students with prior knowledge of Italian may be exempted from the prerequisites in one of three ways: a) by presenting a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Italian Exam; b) by presenting a score of 780 or above on the SAT Subject Test in Italian; c) by obtaining a satisfactory score on the department’s placement examination. Therefore, for them the overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Concentration is 6 (24 points).\n\nRequired Courses\n\nItalian concentrators are required to take two sequences: a) a sequence of Advanced Italian Language courses and b) a sequence of courses in Italian Literature or Cultural Studies:\n\nAdvanced Italian Language (this sequence should be taken in progressive order)\n\n• Advanced Italian (ITAL UN3335). Advanced reading, writing, speaking with emphasis on authentic cultural materials. Topic and semester themes vary. Taught in Italian.\n\n• Italian Language through Content. Course offerings under this category include courses such as: Italian through Cinema (ITAL UN3337); Italiana. Introduction to Italian Culture, the High, the Low, and the In-between (ITAL UN3338); Learning Italian in Class and Online: A Telecollaboration with Italy (ITAL UN3339); Art Itineraries: Italian through Art (ITAL UN3341); Business Italian and the Made in Italy Excellence: Learning Italian for trade and industry (ITAL UN3342); Advanced Italian: Comparative Stylistics & Translation (ITAL UN3343); Italy: Emigration-Immigration (ITAL UN3232); and Grand Tour in Italy (ITAL UN3645). These are all courses of Advanced Italian Language through a specific subject and with emphasis on cultural content. Taught in Italian.\n\nand\n\nItalian Literature or Cultural Studies\n\nIntroduction to Italian Literature I and II (ITAL UN3333-4) provides an overview of major authors and works in the Italian literary tradition from the Middle Ages to the present.
