        "text": "gnosticism\n\nA movement during the early church period that focused on the quest for secret knowledge transmitted only to the \"enlightened.\" Gnostics viewed matter as evil and denied the humanity of Jesus.\n\nThe supreme being who is the creator and sustainer of the universe. Christians believe that God is the Trinity consisting of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nUnmerited favor. God's grace is given freely to sinful humanity in manifold ways and ultimately for Christians in the salvation and forgiveness through Jesus Christ.\n\nThe place beyond the earth that is the living place of God. In Christianity, it is the future eternal home of those who receive salvation in Christ.\n\nIn Christian belief, the place of the dead after death in which the wicked endure eternal punishment. It is a condition of total separation from God.\n\nA contemporary recognition in philosophy and biblical interpretation that the person who interprets inevitably is part of the interpretive process. This means that one's understanding of biblical texts cannot help but be affected by this person's own context.\n\nThe study of the meanings of writings, speech, and therefore also of biblical texts. The study of the methodology of interpretation.\n\nA word often used in the Old Testament to characterize God. Hesed indicates God's loving-kindness in keeping covenant promises despite human failings. The word is Hebrew translates to loving-kindness, benevolence, mercy or charity.\n\nA theological approach that opens an issue for further questioning and analysis.\n\nThe organized and structured levels of power within church government.\n\nThe perspective that ancient texts were shaped by the cultural context and thoughts of those who composed them.\n\nTo be holy is to be set apart. Christian holiness is the sanctified life of believers. It is often defined in terms of personal character or actions.\n\nThe third person of the Trinity.\n\nThe active, positive expectation of something in the future. In Christianity, the active expectation of future blessings as the fulfillment of God's covenant faithfulness and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. One of the three theological virtues with faith and love (1 Cor 13:13).\n\nThose rights that humans have by virtue of their humanity and not by any merit of their own. In Christianity these rights emerge from the fact that God created humanity and loves humanity.\n\nThe July 25, 1968 encyclical letter of Pope Paul VI, subtitled \"The Right Order to Be Followed in the Propagation of Human Offspring.\"\n\nAn individual, complete substance existing entirely in itself; the term used by the Church to identify the persons in the Trinity and the union of two natures in one divine person in Christ (Chalcedon 451 CE).\n\nThe union of divinity and humanity in the one person of Jesus Christ, defined at the Council of Chalcedon (451 CE).\n\nThe body of ideas reflecting the needs and aspirations of a particular individual, group, class, or culture.\n\nThe worship of false or nonexistent gods (idols).\n\nA Spanish churchman and founder of the Jesuits (14911556).\n\nLiterally, this means \"image of God.\" In theology it is the term used to describe the uniqueness of humans as the creation of God (Gen 1:26-27).\n\nThe concept that God is present in, close to and involved with creation. In Christian theology this means that God is continuously involved in creation without becoming exhausted or ceasing to be divine. The word \"immanence\" comes from the Latin meaning \"remaining in.\"\n\nThe term used to explore and explain the internal workings and relationships among the three persons of the Trinity. In many ways this relationship is an inexpressible mystery.\n\nFreedom from change. In theology, God's changeless perfection and constancy.\n\nThe Latin word for \"inclusion.\" In scripture and literature, the use of the same term or motif at the beginning and end of a literary unit (e.g. Matt 1:23 and 28:20).\n\nThe assimilation of something into a specific culture through observation, experience, and teaching. In theology, this is the process by which the gospel message is assimilated into a specific cultural setting.\n\nLiving life without any influence from one's belief in God. The term can also mean that all the differences between various Christian groups or denominations have little genuine significance.\n\nThe concept that the Bible is written without error. For fundamentalist Christians, the concept is interpreted to mean that the Bible enjoys full historical and scientific accuracy on all matters. In contrast, the Catholic Church holds that \"The Bible teaches firmly, faithfully, and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation\" (Dei Verbum par. 11). This means that the Bible need not, and is not be, historically or scientifically factual in every detail; what is reliable, inerrant and true are those matters necessary for human salvation.\n\nThe characteristic of something said or written that it will not deceive or lead to error.\n\nThe receiving by humans of divine or supernatural truths. It is often associated with the biblical writers in writing the Scripture. From the Latin word inspirare meaning \"to breathe in.\"\n\nIrenaeus (120203 CE) bishop of Lyons and leading Christian theologian of the 2nd-century. His work Adversus Haereses (Against Heresies), written in about 180, was a refutation of Gnosticism. In the course of his writings Irenaeus advanced the development of an authoritative canon of Scriptures, the creed, and the authority of the episcopal office.\n\nA seventeenth-century Roman Catholic theological and spiritual movement characterized by moral rigidity and pessimism about the human condition. It was named after Cornelius Otto Jansen (15851638). The movement was condemned by Pope Innocent X in 1653.\n\nThe theological perspectives found in the New Testament writings attributed to John. These include the Gospel of John, 1, 2, 3 John, and Revelation.\n\nA theory developed by Augustine that, despite its evils, war may be morally justified under certain conditions.\n\nFairness and uprightness. Biblically this concept is usually associated with right relationships and persons receiving a fair share of the resources of the society.\n\nThe saving gift of righteousness which comes through faith in Christ and makes human beings acceptable to God.\n\nA Greek term for \"time\" or \"right time\" meaning a special time when God's will and purposes are carried out. For Christian, Kairos denotes God's final dealings with humans through Christ in the fullness of time.\n\nPositive statements about the perfections or characteristics ascribable to God. These statements are in contrast to negative or \"apophatic\" statements.\n\nThe Greek roots of the term catholic or universal come from kata meaning \"according to\" and holos meaning \"the whole\" or more colloquially, \"universal.\"\n\nA theological term referring to the self-emptying of Christ in the incarnation, as well as his conscious acceptance of obedience to the divine will that led him to death (Phil 2:3-11). The Greek word for \"emptying,\" in the sense of becoming empty-handed or destitute.\n\nThe act of proclaiming. The term often refers to the New Testament message of the gospel of Jesus Christ and to the proclamation of this message.\n\nDanish philosopher and religious writer (18131855) who was a precursor of 20th-century Existentialism and a major influence on modern Protestant theology. Kierkegaard described the various stages of existence as the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious; advancing through this existential dialectic, the individual becomes increasingly aware of his or her relationship to God.\n\nA term that refers to the community or fellowship of Christian believers participating together in the life of Christ. A Greek word meaning communion, fellowship, or common life.\n\nThe faithful who have been fully incorporated into the body of Christ. The term usually refers to those who are non-ordained to distinguish them from ordained clergy from the Greek word for \"people\" (laos, λαὀς)\n\nRelease from captivity into freedom. Christian salvation is a theological image of being released from the captivity of sin into the freedom of life in Christ.\n\nA largely Latin-American movement developed in the late 1960s which provides a prophetic call for justice to overcome poverty and oppression.\n\nA term used disparagingly for a free thinker who is unrestrained by convention or traditional morality.\n\nA term from Roman Catholic canon law for the status of a sacrament in relation to church law. The word comes from the Latin word licere meaning to be permitted. A licit sacrament is one performed in accordance with church law.\n\nThe process whereby writers include themselves in the story or write a story in such a way that the reader is included. For example, Matthew puts himself in the tax collector's place in the gospel that he has written. John mentions a beloved unnamed disciple that allows the reader to identify with the character and be drawn into the gospel story that he has written.\n\nThe service of God offered by the people of God in divine worship. From the Greek word leitourgia (λειτουργία) meaning \"work of the people.\"\n\nLogos (λὀγος) is the Greek word for word, account, discourse or study. This type of Christology follows from John's Gospel prologue that says ῾the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.῾\n\nA strong feeling of personal affection, care, and desire for the well-being of another. In Greek there are three words for love. These are agape (ἀγάπη) meaning self-sacrificial love, thus the love of God for people, the love of people for God and the unselfish love of people for others. This type of love is the primary characteristic of God's nature toward people. The second Greek word for love is philia (φιλία) which is friendship, a reciprocal form of love between equals. The third Greek word for love is eros (ἔρος) meaning a form of love that satisfies one's desires, such as erotic love.\n\nThe Dogmatic Constitution on the Church of the Second Vatican Council. The purpose of this document is twofold, first to explain the Church's nature as \"a sign and instrument of communion with God and of unity among all men,\" and second, to clarify the Church's universal mission as the sacrament of human salvation.\n\nA key figure of the Protestant Reformation and founder of the Lutheran church who lived 14831546.\n\nThe teaching office and authority of the church, teaching the gospel in the name of Christ. The word is Latin for \"office of teacher.\"\n\nThe teaching of Marcion in the second-century. This teaching held that the God depicted in the Old Testament was a God of wrath and justice completely unrelated to the God of love as depicted in the New Testament. Dependent on neo-Platonic thought, Marcion taught that Jesus was the first direct revelation of the Supreme God, while the God of the Old Testament was merely the derivative Logos or demiurge of the Supreme God, itself an emanation of God that was responsible for expressing the ideal forms into matter. Marcionism rejected the Old Testament and much of the New Testament (whereever it quoted from or depended upon the Old Testament).\n\nThe process of placing persons in positions of marginal importance, influence, or power.\n\nThe song of Mary, the mother of Jesus, at the occasion of her visit to her cousin Elizabeth before the birth of Jesus (Luke 1:46-55), named after the first word in the Latin Vulgate passage.\n\nGod's kind and compassionate care for all creatures, especially human beings. It also refers to a positive characteristic of Christians.\n\nThe Hebrew word for \"anointed one.\" In Greek christos (χριστός). The promised deliverer of Israel who would reestablish God's governance of one or all institutions of society. There are at least seven different types of messiah mentioned either in Jewish or Christian scriptures; see this chart.\n\nA term from the New Testament meaning repentance or \"change of heart\" that flows from sorrow for sin and includes a turning (conversion) from sinfulness to righteousness. This word is Greek for \"change of mind.\"\n\nA field of philosophy dealing with questions of ultimate reality. This branch of philosophy is close to religion and has had a strong impact on theology. The word in Greek means \"beyond the physical.\"\n\nA particular systematic procedure, technique, or mode of inquiry used in the development of a theological position or theological understanding.\n\nA concept for the application of inductive reasoning to the understanding of nature by Francis Bacon (15611626) proposed as the basis for scientific study. He proposed that true scientific thought progressed from observations that are particular, to lesser axioms, then to middle axioms, and finally to generalities.\n\nService to God rendered by the church and by individuals through the power of the Holy Spirit. All the faithful participate in ministry by virtue of their baptism.\n\nA Christological view of the early church which taught that Jesus Christ had only one nature rather than a divine and a human nature. From the Greek words monos (μόνος) meaning \"one\" and physis (φύσις) meaning \"nature.\"\n\nThe rightness or wrongness of actions in relation to a particular standard or norm of conduct.\n\nThe laws given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai and summarized in the 10 commandments and the great commandment.\n\nAn attitude of respect for and engagement with many distinctly different cultures.\n\nIn the secular world this means an obscure or inexplicable matter. In Christian theology it refers to any truth beyond human comprehension, for example God's loving plan for human salvation revealed through the incarnation of Christ and the sending of the Holy Spirit.\n\nOne who experiences a deep union with the divine often with an overwhelming feeling of awe or blessedness.\n\nThe experience of the divine by means of a direct and personal encounter or union with God.\n\nA collection of 53 ancient texts collated in 13 leather-bound books discovered at Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945. These documents are primary texts of Gnosticism.\n\nA 20th-century theology that utilizes the concept of a story and a human storyteller to provide an opportunity for theological reflection.\n\nAs distinct from revealed law (divine law), natural law is what God has produced in the world of creation. It is what all people know (or can know) of what God has created.\n\nA term used in ancient liturgies to describe those who were newly baptize, from the Greek word neo (νεο) meaning \"new\" and phytos (φυτός) meaning planted.\n\nA prominent American theologian of the mid-20th-century. Niebuhr emphasized \"Christian realism\" as an ethical posture in relating love and justice.\n\nIn ethics, the rule, pattern, or model used as a standard of right action in human behavior.\n\nThe declaration in the Second Vatican Council on the relation of the Church to non-Christian religions.\n\nAn encyclical letter from Pope Paul VI published on May 14, 1971 on the 80th anniversary of Rerum Novarum. This encyclical was entitled \"A Call to Action\" and is considered one of the key writings on Catholic Social Doctrine.\n\nThe branch of metaphysics concerned with the nature of being. One of the most comprehensive of all human disciplines. Ontology can also be called metaphysics, that which is beyond the physical, or the underlying and undergirding source of all reality.\n\nThe things that are considered correct and proper beliefs. This word comes from the Greek words orthos (ὀρθός) meaning \"straight\" or \"right\" and doxa (δόξα) meaning \"praise.\"\n\nThe encyclical of Pope John XXIII on \"Establishing Universal Peace in Truth, Justice, Charity and Liberty,\" promulgated April 11, 1963.\n\nCapable of being touched or felt.\n\nA term developed by John Toland (16701722) meaning everything God. This view is that God is everything and everything is God. Pantheism is different from panentheism which means God is in the universe but is greater than it.\n\nA term used to describe the second coming of Christ.\n\nThe openness and fearlessness with which the apostles publicly proclaimed the message of the crucified and risen Christ in spite of the threat of imprisonment and punishment. (Acts 2:29, 4:29, 31).\n\nThe redemption provided by Christ through his life, death, resurrection, ascension, and sending of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe New Testament letters to Timothy and Titus, ostensibly by Paul, offering advice to these second-generation shepherds/ministers (pastor is the Latin for shepherd).\n\nThe part of practical theology that deals with the relationships between the Word of God and the lives of God's people.\n\nRelating to the early church fathers. The patristic era began after the death of the apostles and ended at the start of the Middle Ages (100750).\n\nLiterature of the Fathers of the Church.\n\nThe apostle Paul of the New Testament. Tarsus is a city on the south coast of Turkey.\n\nNot only a lack of war, but also a time of full societal and personal well-being. In Hebrew, shalom (שׁלום).\n\nThe art or science of teaching and the methods used to teach.\n\nThe heretical theological view of the British monk Pelagius (354420 CE) who taught that humans can achieve salvation through their own sustained efforts.\n\nFifty days after Passover, a major Jewish feast celebrating harvest and later celebrating the giving of the law to Moses in Sinai. In the Christian tradition, the Holy Spirit came upon the disciples on the Jewish feast of Pentecost (Acts 2).\n\nThe Greek word for \"spirit\" or \"breath.\"\n\nThe theological doctrine of the Holy Spirit. The study of the divine Spirit of God.\n\nA confrontational argument that challenges a particular position. The word comes from the Greek word polemikos (πολεμικός) meaning \"of or for war.\"\n\nThe provisions made by a particular denomination for government and discipline.\n\nAn encyclical letter of Pope Paul VI promulgated on March 26, 1967 entitled \"On the Development of Peoples.\" The document manifests the Church's concern and interest in the progressive development of all people, especially those who are trying to escape the ravages of hunger, poverty, endemic disease, and ignorance.\n\nThe field that reflects on the church's life in both group and individual expressions. A curriculum in practical theology usually covering preaching, worship, pastoral care, church administration, and church polity.\n\nAn introduction to liturgical books (Latin). These introductions provide details on how the liturgy is to be conducted.\n\nA term used to describe a self-critical activity which is not just satisfied with finding the truth, but also aims to verify this truth by transforming society. The term is widely used in liberation theology.\n\nA term used in liberation theology to describe God's special concern for those subjected to poverty and oppression and their advantage in being able to know God.\n\nPre-moral or ontic evil refers to the \"inevitable ambiguity of human actions\" (Gula, 269), where good is only imperfectly realized in human actions, even the most noble ones. But this is, as it were, a purely objective factum and not an intended state of affairs, hence, not strictly speaking a matter of \"moral\" evil. It does not come out of freedom, but from the finite conditions of human existence. There is a helpful discussion of this in Richard Gula, Reason Informed by Faith: Foundations of Catholic Morality (New York: Paulist, 1989).\n\nOne of the four authors of the Hebrew Bible often represented as the \"P\" source. The other three authors are the Deutereonomistic \"D\" source, the Elohist \"E\" source, and the Yahwist \"J\" source. The \"P\" source reveals interest and concern in whatever pertains to worship, thus earning the name of the priestly source. Not only does \"P\" employ a distinctive Hebrew vocabulary but, influenced by a desire to categorize and systematize material, develops a precise, and at times a somewhat labored or pedantic, style. The \"P\" source was dated around the time of Ezra, or about 450 BCE (see Documentary Hypothesis). For more on the sections of the Pentateuch attributed to the Priestly source and the themes of this material, see The Priestly Source (Dr. Murphy's SCTR 15 Texting God class).\n\nThe theological movement inspired by Alfred North Whitehead (18611947) whose philosophy stresses the importance of becoming over being.\n\nThat which anticipates a future event. An eschatological outlook that treats a future event or development as currently existing or already accomplished. Jesus' resurrection is a prolepsis of the general resurrection that will mark the end of the present age.\n\nA phrase coined by Pope John XXIII in Pacem in Terris, April 1963: \"Peace is the fruit of justice and is dependent upon right order among humans and among nations. The arms race must cease and progressive disarmament must take place if the future is to be secure. In order to promote peace and the conditions of peace, and effective international authority is necessary.\"\n\nA cross-cultural phenomenon; in the Hebrew Bible, speech on behalf of God or God's people to communicate God's will.\n\nA cross-cultural phenomenon; in the Hebrew Bible, those who speak on behalf of God to communicate God's will to God's people. They are often called to this task; see Isaiah 6.\n\nAn ethical teaching that suggests a determination of the rightness or wrongness of an action may be done by weighing of the positive results of that action against the negative results.\n\nThe Greek word prosopon (πρόσωπον) means person. The concept of divine person and human person together describes the nature of Jesus Christ. The unique and altogether singular event of the Incarnation of the Son of God does not mean that Jesus Christ is part God and part human, nor does it imply that he is the result of a confused mixture of the divine and the human. He became truly human while remaining truly God. Jesus Christ is true God and true human. During the first centuries, the Church had to defend and clarify this truth of faith against the heresies that falsified it (from The Catechism of the Catholic Church).\n\nThe 16th-century movement in Europe led by figures such as Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin that ultimately led to the development of Protestant theology and Protestant churches.\n\nAssent based on sufficient evidence to justify a reasonable person acting in a particular way regarding one's own or someone else's welfare. It is founded on ordinary diligence and good will in the practical matters associated with daily life.\n\nA form of practical psychology whose aim is to diagnose, cure and prevent mental disorders. It often involves having a subject speak freely about himself or herself to the person providing treatment.\n\nThe exercise of theological reflection in public affairs. Although many theologians agree that religion is best served if the church and the governing authority are two separate and distinct entities, there is nonetheless an important connection between the two when matters of public policy contain moral and ethical dimensions. The interplay of religion and public policy is the domain of public theology. It is an area that has seen renewed emphasis following Vatican II.\n\nQ is short for the German word Quelle, which means \"source.\" It refers to one of two sources used by the authors of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke (see Two-Source Hypothesis). Although this \"lost\" Gospel has not been found, its presence is manifest in material found in the Matthew and Luke but not in Mark (cf. Gospel of Thomas). It is believed that the Q Gospel is a collection of Jesus' sayings.\n\nA German theologian (19041984) regarded by many as the leading Roman Catholic theologian of the 20th-century. Rahner entered the Jesuit order in 1922. His doctoral dissertation was on a new interpretation of the thought of Thomas Aquinas. Rahner's influence grew after his service as an official papal theological expert before and during the Second Vatican Council (19601965).\n\nThe view that Jesus Christ is truly present in the celebration of the Lord's Supper. Theologians and churches have differed on the exact way that this real presence is to be understood.\n\nA form of logical reasoning in which one deduces that a conclusion must be true if the premises are true. This style of logic moves from the general to the specific case.\n\nA form of logical reasoning in which the premises give grounds for the conclusion but do not necessitate it. This style of logic moves from the specific to the general.\n\nThe concept that sinful humans are \"bought back\" from the bondage of sin into a renewed relationship with God through a human act or grace by a down payment such as Jesus' death. It is essentially a commercial metaphor applied to the economy of salvation.\n\nExplaining complex ideas using terms and methods that are not appropriate to their complexity.\n\nThe fallacy in philosophy whereby one treats a psychological or mental entity as though it were an object or thing.\n\nThe kingdom of God. Jesus' central message about God's sovereign rule in the present and the future.\n\nThe philosophical view that there are no absolutes but that truths and values are determined by cultures and societal practices.\n\nReligion is the practice of piety toward God as the Creator of the universe. The Latin word religare means \"to tie, fasten or bind\" and the word relegere means \"to gather up, treat with care.\"\n\nThe freedom to practice one's form of religion according to the dictates of one's conscience without coercion or governmental interference.\n\nAn important encyclical letter from Pope Leo XII issued on May 15, 1891 titled \"On the Condition of the Working Classes.\"\n\nThe resurrection of Christ is the central defining theme of the Christian faith. Not a mere return to earthly life by the resuscitation of the body, resurrection is a transformation both morally and spiritually with bodies adapted for eternal life with God.\n\nThe process by which God discloses the divine nature and the mystery of the divine to human beings.\n\nA set or form of religious observances that performed and thereby help to shape a religious experience or set of beliefs.\n\nThe directions or rules for conducting church services including liturgical actions and gestures.\n\nThe view that ordination gives a person the ability to administer the sacraments and thus gives that person the ability to convey God's grace in a priestly way. It has also come to mean that the church has come to rely too much on the clergy. The word comes from the Latin word sacerdos meaning \"priest.\"'\n\nAn outward sign instituted by God to convey an inward or spiritual grace. Sacraments are a significant part of the liturgical practices of churches. Roman Catholicism recognizes seven sacraments, and Protestants recognize two.\n\nThe theological concept that God's grace is conveyed through religious rites designated as sacraments.\n\nReferring to the new understanding of grace elaborated at Vatican II in which all of creation participates in God's grace. Sacramentality refers to the presence of the divine in all things as in Rahner's \"radical gracing of reality.\" It presupposes a creation-centered theology. God is good, life is good and all water becomes \"holy.\"\n\nIntercessory prayers similar to sacraments which are considered to bestow benefits indirectly to those who practice them. Unlike the sacraments, these are not given to us by Christ. (e.g., distribution of ashes, blessing of one's children).\n\nSacred means holy or divine. It is that which pertains to God as distinguished from that which relates to human beings. The word comes from the Latin sacrare meaning \"set apart.\" Profane means \"not set apart,\" \"secular,\" or \"human.\" In a theological sense it does not always mean profanity, rather, it implies something that is set in contrast to the Creator who is holy. The word comes from the Latin profanes meaning \"lying outside the temple,\" \"ordinary,\" or \"not holy.\"\n\nSomething of value offered as an act of worship or devotion to God.\n\nGod's activities that bring humans into a right relationship with God and with one another through Christ.\n\nBiblical events narrated from the perspective of faith and showing God's redemptive purposes for the world.\n\nThe area in a church where worship takes place.\n\nA formal break or division within a religious group usually arising from a long-standing disagreement.\n\nThe system and methods of learning for both philosophy and religion in European universities during the medieval period.\n\nWritings regarded as sacred. In the Christian tradition, this consists of the Old and New Testaments as the self-revelation of God.\n\nSee \"consistent life ethic.\"\n\nA sociological term for a group with voluntary members, exclusive in its membership, with a unique identity.\n\nA belief system that denies the reality of God and religion and instead identifies itself with the world and human viewpoints.\n\nThe process of moving from a religious orientation toward one that is focused on the world.\n\nLiterally \"sense of the faithful,\" an ancient phrase which is commonly invoked as a defense against new heresies and as one of the traditional sources of the magisterium.\n\nThe translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek completed approximately a century before the time of Christ. Tradition has it that this was the work of seventy or seventy-two persons (hence the name that is Latin for seventy).\n\nThe signs predicted by Christ foretelling his second coming and the end of the world; also used in recent conciliar documents to refer to developments in the contemporary world that reflect God's ongoing presence with us.\n\nThe human condition of separation from God requiring forgiveness.\n\nThe view that right and wrong must be judged in relation to the particular situation in which they occur.\n\nEthical reflection that focuses on social structures and communities of persons.\n\nA principle used in logic whereby if the first two of a set of three propositions are true, then it is concluded that the third must also be true.\n\nIn ancient philosophy, this was a blending together of views from different philosophies or religions. It has since come to mean a collection of views without coherence.\n\nA synod is a formal meeting of church leaders to deal with church matters. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Synod of Bishops is an assembly of bishops which represents all the episcopal conferences. This group meets every three years in Rome in the month of October.\n\nSynoptic means \"seeing together\" (Greek sun [συν] + opsis [οψις]). The Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, which frequently parallel each other and provide a similar account of the life and teaching of Jesus Christ, are referred to as the synoptic gospels.\n\nThe challenge of accounting for the literary relationship of the synoptic gospels Matthew, Mark and Luke. Since they share not only stories, but the vocabulary of those stories, often word-for-word, the simplest explanation is that one served as a base text that the other two later copied. But which was first? And how does one account for material that is shared only by Matthew and Luke (almost all of these sayings of Jesus), as well as the material only in Matthew and the material only in Mark? There are many solutions to the problem, with the consensus being the Two-Source Hypothesis.\n\nThe mental act of combining simple ideas into more complex concepts. The word comes from the Greek synthesis (σύνθεσις) meaning \"putting together.\"\n\nThe branch of theology that attempts to study, in a coherent fashion, the main doctrines of Christianity.\n\nA branch of philosophy that deals with ends or final causes. The telelogical argument is one of the five arguments for the existence of God formulated by Thomas Aquinas (12251274). It states that God must exist because of the purposeful order of the universe that points to the work of a \"Master Architect\" rather than the result of chance.\n\nGod-centered belief. From the Greek words theos (θεός) meaning \"God\" and kentron (κέντρον) meaning center.\n\nA view of government in which God is acknowledged to be the supreme ruler. Many ancient nations believed their rulers were invested with divine authority and that the laws that governed their state were of divine origin.\n\nA philosophical term introduced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (16411716). The term refers to the belief that God is omnipotent, all-loving, and just in spite of the reality of evil in the world.\n\nThe ordered, systematic study of God. The word comes from the Greek words theos (θεός) meaning \"God\" and logos (λόγος) meaning word, account, discourse.\n\nAn manifestation of God that is visible to human eyes. The word comes from the Greek words theos (θεός) meaning \"God\" and phainesthai (φαίνεσθαι) meaning \"to appear.\"\n\nItalian philosopher-theologian (12251274). Aquinas was perhaps the most influential of the medieval thinkers. He was able to combine Aristotelian and neo-Platonist elements of philosophy in a Christian context.\n\nThe philosophical and theological teaching of Thomas Aquinas (12251274).\n\nThe transmission of received teachings or practice.\n\nAn appeal to past forms of a religion including its culture and patterns.\n\nThe \"tranquility of (the social) order.\" This concept was first described by Augustine in an attempt to describe the peace to be sought among nations and states.\n\nFrom the Latin word for \"surpassing.\" The transcendence of God goes beyond the universe and surpasses it in every way.\n\nThat which stands beyond all limits of human experience.\n\nA 20th-century Roman Catholic theological movement that joined the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas (12251274) with that of Immanuel Kant (17241804).\n\nSee covenant treaty.\n\nReferring to the Council of Trent (15451563) and to the theological thought and practice in the Roman Catholic Church that resulted from this Council.\n\nThat part of theology that attempts to understand the central Christian mystery of one God in three distinct personsFather, Son, and Holy Spirit. Sometimes described in terms of their actions: Creation, Incarnation, Sanctification.\n\nGod in three personsFather, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nGerman Protestant theologian and scholar (18651923), whose historical and sociological approach to the philosophy of religion became a major influence in 20th-century theology. His most important work is The Social Teaching of the Christian Churches (1912; trans. 1931), a historical and cultural analysis of Christian social ethics.\n\nThe twelve disciples of Christ named (differently) in the Gospels and Acts.\n\nThe most widely held theory to explain the relationship of the synoptic gospels, Matthew, Mark and Luke (see synoptic problem). The theory holds that Matthew and Luke had two sources in common when they composed their gospelsthe Gospel of Mark and \"Q,\" a list of sayings of Jesus that do not appear in Mark. Mark is thought to be the earliest gospel because of its rough grammar, poor Greek style, plotting anomalies and unusual portrait of Jesus, the disciples, and Jesus' family (at least unusual when compared to the direction the tradition goes). It is easier to explain that Matthew and Luke improved on Mark than that Mark took either Matthew or Luke and made them worse. Dependence on \"Q\" explains why over 50 times, Matthew and Luke share a passage not in Mark, and almost all of this material is sayings of Jesus. In addition to the two shared sources, Matthew and Luke each added their own unique material to their stories.\n\nThis body is composed of all active and retired members of the Catholic hierarchy in the United States and the Territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands, and are served by a staff of 315 lay people, priests, deacons and religious at their office in Washington, D.C. Together, the bishops exercise their pastoral office jointly in order to enhance the Church's beneficial influence on all people. Like other episcopal conferences throughout the world, the USCCB fulfills the Vatican Council's mandate that bishops \"jointly exercise their pastoral office\" (from the Second Vatican Council's Decree on the Bishops' Pastoral Office in the Church, #38). The USCCB operates through a number of committees made up exclusively of bishops.\n\nA group of Eastern churches that are in union with the Roman Catholic Church, who acknowledge the Roman pope as supreme in matters of faith, but maintain their own liturgy, discipline, and rite.\n\nKarl Mannheim (18931947), Hungarian sociologist who settled in the U.K. in 1933. His book Ideology and Utopia, published in 1929, is a study of the myths by which society lives and evolves.\n\nThe First Vatican Council (18691870) was convoked by Pius IX and produced two constitutions: Dei Filius (Latin for \"Son of God\") on God the creator and Pastor Aeternus (Latin for \"Eternal Shepherd\") on papal primacy and infallibility.\n\nThe Second Vatican Council (19621965) met for one session under Pope John XXIII and three sessions under Pope Paul VI. This Council aimed to update the church's life and doctrinal formulations.\n\nA small room or hallway between the outer doors of a church and the sanctuary.\n\nThe term used to describe the traces of God found in all creatures except humans.\n\nA choice to live in a way that focuses not on personal possessions or material things, following Jesus' teaching to the rich young man, \"Go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me\" (Mark 10:21). Francis and Clare of Assisi famously followed this teaching, as did the other mendicant orders. In our own time, Dorothy Day, co-founder of the Catholic Worker movement, tells us that because Peter had chosen to be poor he had remained free; he had time to think. He lived a rich and abundant life because of that very poverty (Catholic Worker, February 1945). Peter understood that detachment from material things is the mysterious key to spiritual freedom, to joy and to the ability to possess things as God wishes us to possess themon loan, as it were, for this life.\n\nA name deriving from vulgata editio (Latin for \"popular edition\") and referring to the most widely used Latin translation of the Bible. This version was the basis for the official Bible of the Roman Catholic Church from the 16th to the 20th-century, and the Nova Vulgataa version of the Vulgate updated from Hebrew and Greek manuscript discoveries of the past 200 yearscontinues to serve as the basis of the lectionary.\n\nIn the Christian perspective, work means glorifying and serving God through service to others and to society.\n\nThe writer of the \"Yahwist\" (or J) source of traditions in the Pentateuch. These writings are distinguished by their use of the term \"Yahweh\" (יהוה) for God and are thought to derive from the united and then southern kingdom based in Jerusalem (see Documentary Hypothesis). For more on the sections of the Pentateuch attributed to the Yahwist source and the themes of this material, see The Yahwist Source (Dr. Murphy's SCTR 15 Texting God class).\n\nAlso known as the Benedictus (Dominus Deus), this is the song of praise delivered by Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist, when he first had his speech restored after the birth of his son (Luke 1:67-80). This song is often used liturgically."
