        "text": "During the pandemic, she applied and was accepted to Harvard Divinity School. When it came time for her thesis, she remembered that book her mom gave her, and it gave her an idea.\n\nThat idea turned into a 35-minute pilot episode of what she calls a “reimagined” version of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” which will premier at the Regent Theatre in Arlington at 7 p.m. on Thursday. Bugeau-Heartt hopes to continue to pursue the project and upload it for streaming. Of course, she noted there is the dream of “getting in the right rooms with the right people” to make it into a larger series and spread the show’s positive message to a modern audience.\n\n“We’ve got an election coming up, the climate crisis isn’t going away, there’s a war in Gaza, there’s still so much pain and suffering,” Bugeau-Heartt said. “Not that this pilot at all even comes close to being a Band-Aid, but to have an opportunity to continue a message of healing, goodness, kindness, and community was a huge opportunity.”\n\nThe “Neighborhood” pilot was shot in Bugeau-Heartt’s Arlington studio apartment in mid-March, with a cast and crew of 23 people. Along with her team, Bugeau-Heartt raised over $8,000 on GoFundMe to support the project. It will look familiar to fans of the original program: There is a land of make believe, a musical guest, and Bugeau-Heartt as the equivalent of the titular character, donning a red sweater.\n\nThe target audience is different, however: Bugeau-Heartt noted that the original program spoke primarily to children, whereas her adaptation attempts to speak to “a childlike place in grown-ups.”\n\n“It’s not a heavy piece, but it strikes me as a little darker than the ‘Mister Rogers’ show,” Bugeau-Heartt said. “There’s a shade in there of speaking to things that alludes to the darkness that feels deeper than it did maybe 40, 50 years ago for certain people.”\n\nOf course, there is another key difference: She’s a woman. Bugeau-Heartt often wondered if the identity shift to a cisgender white female was “drastic enough.” Moreover, she wondered if she was the right person to play the part.\n\n“Mr. Rogers was some otherworldly being, and I’m very human and very flawed,” Bugeau-Heartt said. “Mr. Rogers had such poise and grace about him and openness that I often don’t possess. How was I going to uphold that [while also being] true to myself?”\n\nAdriane Moreno, one of the pilot’s producers and its set designer who has known Bugeau-Heartt for over a decade, said Bugeau-Heartt’s “infectious energy just draws people in.”\n\n“She’s so playful and hilarious, when you’re talking with her, you end up kind of seeing the poetry of the world,” Moreno said.\n\nTo Moreno, what set this project apart from the many others she and Bugeau-Heartt have worked on together was the team behind it. Bugeau-Heartt wanted to compile a cast and crew of people that reflected the values of the piece, which made the environment deeply collaborative.\n\n“Conceptually, [the pilot] brings together a lot of things that Madeline and I have been interested in for a long time, about finding a place where you kind of create belonging, where you find ways to ask questions about what is keeping people separate, and ways to talk about what makes a quality life,” Moreno said.\n\nUltimately, Bugeau-Heartt is looking forward to celebrating the work of her crew at the premiere, and hopes audiences walk away with a reminder of Mr. Rogers’s key message: “The greatest thing we can do is to let people know that they are loved and capable of loving.”\n\n“Mr. Rogers, in his own time and context, saw media, film, TV, as kind of an inevitable, ubiquitous source of learning for people,” said Gianluca Avanzato, who played the delivery man in the pilot and assisted Bugeau-Heartt in writing the script. “Everyone was tuned into their TVs, and he didn’t like everything that he saw. Just like he was trying to do, Madeleine, and the crew behind this, is trying to create a different way of being in the world, and one that is more in tune with each other and a lot kinder.”"
