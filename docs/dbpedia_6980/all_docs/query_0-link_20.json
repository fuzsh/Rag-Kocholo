        "text": "Aarushee graduated from UC Irvine in June 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a Minor in Business. Currently, she is a Master of Science in Business Analytics student at UCLA Anderson School of Management, with an Anderson Merit Fellowship.\n\nDuring her fourth-year business classes, she came across courses like New Product Development and Management and Database Management. These exposed her to concepts such as A/B Testing, Hierarchical Clustering, and, Hypothesis Testing. Additionally, she worked on data analytics projects using Python that improved her knowledge of the role statistics and quantitative analysis play in financial case studies. With all these exposures, she developed a strong interest in problem-solving and realized how she can use her background as an engineer and move forward in her journey to synergize the worlds of Technology and Business!\n\nShe’s currently taking a course on Machine Learning for Decision Making and is looking forward to learning how to use machine-learning algorithms to learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention!\n\nAarushee is also an innovator and received her patent from the Indian Government at 13 for a prototype in tetra-pak.
