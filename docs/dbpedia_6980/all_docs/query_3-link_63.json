        "text": "“ Promise me one thing. Whatever happens, when you get back to Olympus, when you're a god again, remember. Remember what it's like to be human. ”\n\n–Jason to Apollo on learning from his time as a mortal in The Burning Maze.\n\nJason Grace was a Roman demigod, the son of Jupiter and the mortal Beryl Grace, as well as the younger brother of Thalia Grace. Jason was a praetor of the Twelfth Legion at Camp Jupiter until he gave his rank to Frank Zhang during The House of Hades as a field promotion; he was the former head counselor of Cabin One at Camp Half-Blood and the Pontifex Maximus at Camp Jupiter. He was the former boyfriend of Piper McLean. Half a year after the giant war, he died at the hands of the third emperor, Caligula, when fighting aboard his yachts but was later avenged when Caligula was killed during the Battle of San Francisco Bay. Nico di Angelo subsequently had a feeling that Jason was somewhere better, although he wasn't sure if Jason was in Elysium or if he chose rebirth.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nJason was born on July 1 to the god Jupiter, the Roman aspect of Zeus and the mortal actress Beryl Grace; his sister, Thalia, was born seven years prior. Because his father had consecutively sired two children with his mother, Juno, the Roman form of Hera, was made Jason's guardian to placate the indignant goddess' anger, as Jupiter went so far as to name his newborn son after his wife's favorite hero, Jason, in the attempt to appease his wife for his infidelity.\n\nAs a child, Jason didn't remember much about his mother and Thalia, but he and Thalia were very close and would play hide and seek in his apartment. Beryl would try to tell Jason about his father, and showed him a storm at the beach, saying it was his father. When Jason was two, he tried to eat a stapler, in which he got his scar from. Jason was the only reason Thalia stayed home, because she thought he was cute and didn't trust Beryl to take care of him.\n\nAfter Jupiter left Beryl and Thalia, Beryl became resentful of him leaving and began to act out again, resulting Thalia increasingly distrusting her ability to look after Jason. She blamed Hera for them leaving and claimed that she was going after them, saying that two demigods from one godly parent was an insult.\n\nGoing to the Wolf House[]\n\nOne day, when Jason was two, Beryl took Thalia and Jason on a family vacation. She drove them up to Wine Country, insisting she wanted to show them a park. When they made it there, she showed Jason to a big building in the park and told Thalia to get a picnic basket. Thalia didn't want Jason to be alone with her, but she thought it would only be for a few minutes. Beryl wanted to stay with him, but Jupiter and Juno gave her no choice. When they made it to the Wolf House, she hugged him for one last time in the ruins of the Wolf house, and promised that it was alright, she would come back and see him soon, with her eyes brimmed with tears. But Jason knew that it wasn't all right. Jason cried in the Wolf House waiting for Thalia and Beryl, but they never came. Instead, Lupa and the wolves did. Because of this incident, Jason wanted to follow rules and keep promises so no one would be abandoned like she did to them.\n\nWhen Thalia found Beryl, she was sobbing at Stone steps of the Wolf House and said that Jason was claimed by Hera and left for dead, and was inconsolable for days. Thalia ran looking for him, but she couldn't find him. Thalia called the police, who questioned Beryl for a long time. Thalia and Beryl subsequently fought for a long time until Thalia ran away, now that Jason was gone. Thalia never learned the truth about her brother and thought he was dead until The Lost Hero, and never told anyone about him, not even Luke and Annabeth.\n\nJason was trained at the Wolf house by Lupa. She found him and tested him on his first night there, to see if he would be a pup or food. She took him under her wing, training him, protecting him and nurturing him, but he couldn't show weakness around her or else he would be torn to shreds - there cannot be weakness in the Wolf pack. She trained him and taught him things such as that he cannot fight force with force, something that helped him years later when fighting Enceladus. She also told him that death in battle was honorable.\n\nLife at Camp Jupiter[]\n\nEventually, Lupa took him on a trip south to Camp Jupiter, where she showed him around Camp. Jason was offered a place in the First Cohort, but he denied it, and decided to join the Fifth Cohort to restore honor to it after what happened to Michael Varus. But he also joined it to try to alter his destiny as the son of Jupiter.\n\nAt Camp Jupiter, everyone expected Jason to lead and treated him like a prince in waiting. To try to alter it, he befriended the least popular kids and went on the least glamorous quests, but there was no use. He followed all the rules, but in reality, he chafed under the rules and traditions there, and felt a little unconventional. He also hated the infighting and the power plays there. He spent twelve years in the legion. Jason's entire career at Camp Jupiter had been built on careful choices. He mediated between demigods, listened to all sides of an argument, and made compromises. He was always the leader and never on a team of equals.\n\nJason eventually became Centurion of the Fifth Cohort, and while Centurion, his cohort always got the job of cleaning out Basilisk's nests.\n\nWhile at Camp, he befriended Reyna Ramírez-Arellano, and became very close to her. The two bonded over Diocletian and both shared an interest over him and his life. They made a promise that even though it was forbidden, if they ever crossed the Mare Nostrum, they would go to Dalmatia, where he had lived. Reyna eventually developed feelings for him, and although Jason knew, he never shut them down, even though he never had feelings for her besides kinship. One time, Jason learned Reyna's last name and tried to pronounce it correctly, and Reyna gave him a murderous look, saying that was the name of a little girl from San Juan and she left it in Puerto Rico.\n\nWhen they were fifteen, they went to Charleston, South Carolina, to salvage Imperial Gold torpedoes from the C.S.S Hunley. Jason and Reyna went to The Battery, and they saw something in the park. They thought it was a Southern belle from the civil war, but every time they tried to approach it, it disappeared. Reyna decided to approach it on her own. When she came back, she seemed shaken up and didn't tell Jason what it said. Reyna never acted the same around him after that.\n\nJason went on plenty of quests while at Camp Jupiter. He stayed at the palace of Aeolus while waiting to slay the Trojan Sea Monster. He also went on an unknown quest to San Bernardino, to kill ghouls and helped find Bacchus' missing leopard in Sonoma.\n\nJason remembered Octavian from Camp Jupiter and hated him, knowing how persuasive he was. Jason learned many stories and legends from Camp Jupiter, including the Mark of Athena, and the story of Cupid and Psyche.\n\nFighting on the Western Front[]\n\nWhile the Greeks were fighting Kronos and the main Titan army in the Battle of Manhattan, Jason led the Twelfth Legion in an assault on Mount Othrys where he fought through an army of Scythian Dracanae with the Roman demigods and defeated the Titan Krios himself with hand to hand combat. During the battle, he toppled the iron throne of Kronos. His actions, which resulted in the destruction of Mount Othrys and probably contributed to the Titans' eventual defeat, led the members of the legion to raise him to the rank of praetor.\n\nPraetor of Camp Jupiter[]\n\nWhen Jason was promoted Praetor, he was raised up on his shield as everyone chanted his name, surrounded by Reyna, Gwendolyn, Bobby, and Dakota. Jason was praetor for around two months with Reyna. During that time, Jason and Reyna grew closer together which made Reyna believe that they had a future together.\n\nWhile praetor, the son of Jupiter fought to change the camp's rules and traditions, even trying to change the name, Twelfth Legion, to First Legion. But it was no use, and Camp was too traditional. But while Praetor, Fifth Cohort's reputation was restored in the eyes of Camp and it became respected again for the first time since the 1980s. Jason welcomed numerous demigods to camp, including Hazel Levesque. Jason and Hazel became friends, though Hazel thought of him as hard to read and more as a legend than a person, and he told her about his battle with Krios. Jason and Reyna also met Nico di Angelo when he introduced himself as a son of Pluto, and welcomed him to camp, letting him be ambassador.\n\nUnfortunately, Jason wasn't praetor for long until he went missing that October. Reyna was the last person he spoke to in private.\n\nThe Heroes of Olympus[]\n\nThe Diary of Luke Castellan[]\n\nYears before the outbreak of the second war with the Titans, Luke Castellan, and Thalia Grace were on the run. In one of their journeys, they were led by the goat Amaltheia into a house where they were temporarily entrapped. While there, Thalia and Luke encountered its prisoner: Halcyon Green, the demigod son of Apollo, gifted with the power of prophecy. One of the prophecies Hal told them about was the fact that Thalia would be reunited with her family, but that it was not Thalia's mother he was referring to. Although Luke didn't understand the context behind Hal's words, Thalia was shaken by what she heard.\n\nThe Lost Hero[]\n\nTo see this text, hit the \"Expand\" link to the right. Jason wakes up on a bus belonging to the Wilderness School holding hands with a girl he doesn't even know. He finds that he has no memory of even going to this school or having a best friend named Leo and a girlfriend named Piper. Gleeson Hedge, his supposed gym teacher and satyr protector (though Jason doesn't know that yet), tells him that he's never seen him before today and that the Mist has been manipulated to make everyone think that they know him. He also reveals that he, Piper, and Leo are demigods and that an extraction team (Annabeth and Butch) was coming to get Piper and Leo to camp along with an unknown \"special package\", which turns out to be Jason.\n\nWhen an unnaturally powerful storm arrives, Dylan revealed himself to be a Ventus or venti, a storm spirit, and Jason instinctively took out his gold coin, flipped it, and it became a well-balanced sword made of Imperial Gold though he didn't know how he did it.\n\nWhile he and Piper fought off Dylan, Hedge (who revealed himself to be a middle-aged satyr) climbed down the canyon wall to retrieve Leo when he was thrown down by a strong gust of wind. Jason also survived a lightning bolt that Dylan attacked him with that could have killed twenty men, blowing off his shoe. This surprises Dylan. Piper was thrown off the sky-walk and Jason jumps after her, discovering that he can manipulate air. After a long battle, Dylan takes Hedge away and leaves Leo, Jason, and Piper on the canyon sky-walk.\n\nJust then two half-bloods arrive on a chariot pulled by pegasi; a guy named Butch, son of Iris, and Annabeth, daughter of Athena. When Annabeth and Butch notice Jason only has one shoe on (as the other one was blasted into bits by the lightning bolt), Butch tells them that Annabeth had a vision that a boy with one shoe would help her find one of the campers, who has been missing for three days, her boyfriend Percy Jackson.\n\nAfter they arrive at Camp Half-Blood, Annabeth gives Jason and Piper a tour of the camp while Will Solace takes Leo to his cabin (since he was almost immediately claimed). Jason then meets Chiron (whom he was taken to immediately after Annabeth realized he forgot his memory) who immediately realizes who Jason was by speaking in Latin, to which he responds in Latin. Afterward, they find out Hera was in danger, and Jason must lead a quest in order to save her. Jason reveals his godly parent through the summoning of a lightning bolt, showing that he was a son of Jupiter. He chooses Piper, shortly after she was claimed by Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and Leo, who was claimed by Hephaestus when they got to Camp Half-blood, to go with him on his quest. Jason also receives a prophecy saying that he must beware of the earth, possibly because Gaea, the Earth, was his enemy and that she bears arms to the Doors of Death. This convinces Leo to capture and fix the metallic dragon whom he calls Festus who had gone wild and malfunctioned after his builder Charles Beckendorf died during the Second Titan War.\n\nAfter they embark upon their quest, they meet King Boreas, who tells them to go to Chicago, the windy city. Although Boreas' daughter Khione wanted to kill the three, Boreas set them free because he thought it was more amusing to watch them fail their quest. Leo's dragon malfunctions in Detroit and there, they fall into an old factory that originally produced weapons. There, three cyclopes appear and they knock Piper and Jason out preparing to cook and eat them. Leo manages to escape without being seen and he defeats the Cyclopes using crane-like machines he manages to quickly build. Leo soon manages to fix the dragon, and he, Piper, and Jason head towards Chicago. There they meet Medea, a mortal who was supposed to have died more than 3000 years ago. Medea tries to get Jason and Leo to fight each other using her Charmspeak but Piper counters with her own charm speak and manages to break them free of the spell. They then defeat Medea and blow up her department store. Later, Jason and his companions meet another mortal who was supposed to have died millennia ago, Midas and his son Lityerses. King Midas, the king who wished for the golden touch, then learned to bring back people from their golden state with running water. Midas quickly turns Piper and Leo into gold statues. Jason then fights Lit and defeats him with his unorthodox style and tricks Midas into touching his son. Jason retaliates by summoning a lightning bolt to destroy Midas and rain to free Piper and Leo.\n\nThey head to Pike's Peak to meet Aeolus, master of the winds. Then Piper reveals that she was, in fact, the traitor because her father had been kidnapped. Jason and Leo resolve to rescue him, even though it jeopardizes the quest. Soon after, Lycaon and his wolves attack. The three fight the wolves but couldn't harm them without silver weapons. Then, the Hunter of Artemis comes in and saves them injuring Lycaon and forcing the wolves away. There, Jason discovers that the leader of the Hunters, Thalia, was his sister. Together they head up the mountain to meet Aeolus. Thalia turns back, and the trio faces Aeolus alone. However, the master of the winds was angry that they aren't there to promote them, but Mellie, an Aura (cloud nymph) blasts them to a cafe near Mount Diablo before he can kill them. He also gave Jason and his companions a lot of information. On the mountain, they find Enceladus, the giant born to kill Athena. Jason faces off against Enceladus and manages to wound him several times. Meanwhile, Piper and Leo fight Earthborn that were summoned by Enceladus. However, because of his strength, Jason cannot kill him as it would take the power of a god and demigod. Jason's weapon breaks, releasing a massive amount of energy but fails to kill Enceladus. Enceladus tries to kill him but he was saved by Piper and Leo who manage to build a machine to knock Enceladus into a pit. Jason calls on Jupiter to save him and his faith rewarded with an incredible lightning bolt, shattering the mountain killing the giant. Hedge takes Piper's father home while the three continue on their journey.\n\nFrom there, Leo flies Jason and Piper to the Wolf House, where Thalia and the Hunters of Artemis are defending against a pack of lycanthropes and Earthborns. Because his sword was broken, Jason was forced to fight with nothing but a board. He still managed to smack some wolves around with it though. After Khione arrives and freezes all the Hunters, Jason watched as Leo fought her off. After Khione retreated, Porphyrion awakens and Jason decides to hold him off while Leo and Piper try and free Hera. Porphyrion wonders if Jason was Hermes or Ares, but laughs at Jason after learning he was just a demigod. Porphyrion allows Jason to boast, not feeling threatened at all. The two fight with Jason clearly being outmatched by the still weak Porphyrion. Jason even manages to stab him in the ear and blast him with lightning, but it only served to blacken the giants face and the giant then knocks him down. It wasn't until Hera was freed that Porphyrion retreats (most likely because a god and a demigod combined could take him down and he was still in his weak form).\n\nHera unleashes her true form after warning the demigods to look away. Jason doesn't understand the warning until it's too late and sees Hera's true form, which kills all the monsters still remaining in the area. Jason was put into a near-death state, with Hera and Thalia both believing he was dead. Thalia blames Hera for this and tells her to revive Jason but she stated she can't. Piper says he was breathing, something that Hera doesn't believe to be possible. Piper then uses her charmspeak to awaken Jason, much to the relief and surprise of everyone.\n\nWhen he, Piper, and Leo arrive back at camp, he was visited by Juno, the Roman counterpart of Hera when he was in his cabin alone and was given a new gladius as a replacement for the one he lost while fighting the giant, Enceladus. After this, a head counselor meeting was called, where he then revealed that he was from a Roman equivalent of Camp Half-Blood, and that was where Percy was most likely at (he remembered this because his memory had started returning). Jason also reveals that if the campers at Camp Jupiter discover that Percy's from Camp-Half Blood, they may not be that nice. It was decided that he, Leo, Piper, and Annabeth will go and find Percy at the Roman Camp and then set sail for Greece by sailing on the Argo II.\n\nLeo Valdez and the Quest for Buford[]\n\nBefore the Argo II was fully made, Jason and Piper, who are officially dating, help Leo get Buford back before the Argo II can explode most of the forest.\n\nThe Son of Neptune[]\n\nJason was mentioned several times by the campers of Camp Jupiter because they've been wondering where he has gone (just like Camp Half-Blood was wondering where Percy was gone). During Percy's time in Camp Jupiter, he noticed that Reyna had romantic feelings for Jason. Percy has a brief dream of Leo working on the Argo II with Piper and Jason behind him. As well, when Percy, Frank, and Hazel are watching Polybotes from afar Ma Gasket yells, \"The camp, yes. Vengeance! The orange and purple ones destroy my home. Now Ma Gasket will destroy theirs,\" referencing how Jason destroyed her factory. She then mentions him, Piper and Leo by name though neither Percy, Hazel or Frank knows who they are. After returning from their quest and saving Camp Jupiter, Leo sends a video scroll to ask for safe passage from the Romans. While Percy tries to tell them that they won't attack, he tells them that Jason was on board the ship, leading Reyna to allow the ship to land, but not without any kind of security. Reyna says that she hoped Jason was returning and she missed him.\n\nThe Mark of Athena[]\n\nThe House of Hades[]\n\nThe Blood of Olympus[]\n\nPercy Jackson's Greek Heroes[]\n\nRight after finishing his narration of this book, Percy reveals that after the events of The Blood of Olympus, he, Jason, and the rest of the Seven started the tradition of monthly Argo II reunion parties, and he was quite worried about being late to the current one.\n\nBetween the Series[]\n\nSeveral days after the deaths of Gaea and Leo, a parchment scroll with a holographic message, sent from the resurrected Leo, came fluttering into Camp Half-Blood on the wind. Jason and Piper spend most of September searching for Leo, Festus, and Calypso until Chiron persuades them to return to their normal lives.\n\nEventually, however, Chiron persuades them to resume their school year, and so Jason and Piper depart to a school in Los Angeles (where Tristan McLean lives), taking Gleeson Hedge, Mellie, and Chuck along with them.\n\nThe Senior Year Adventures[]\n\nThe Chalice of the Gods[]\n\nWhen wrestling Geras, Percy thinks of Jason telling him a vision the Son of Jupiter had during the Battle of the Acropolis of him and Piper as grandparents.\n\nThe Trials of Apollo[]\n\nThe Hidden Oracle[]\n\nJason was not present at Camp Half-Blood when the de-powered Apollo and Meg McCaffrey arrive, so Nico di Angelo explains where he and the rest of the Seven are now while showing Leo's holographic message. It was noted that Jason was in Los Angeles, studying with Piper after an unsuccessful search for Leo. Later, during the Colossus Neronis' attack, Apollo asks about Jason, calling him the \"flying boy\". Percy replies that they are \"fresh out of flying boys\" and they needed Apollo to use his plague arrow instead.\n\nThe Dark Prophecy[]\n\nThalia tells Apollo to check in on her brother for her if he and Meg make it to Los Angeles.\n\nThe Burning Maze[]\n\nApollo, Meg McCaffrey, and Grover Underwood are searching for a way into the Labyrinth and learn from Gleeson Hedge that Piper and Jason had found a way into the Labyrinth. The trio drives to Los Angeles to retrieve Jason and Piper. After meeting Piper, they learn that Piper and Jason have broken up.\n\nWhile the trio plus Piper are in the Labyrinth, they encounter Medea and learn that Jason learned a truth that was enough to break him. They learn that Jason found the Sybil and knows the location of the emperor, Caligula.\n\nThey visit Jason's new all-boys school, Edgarton Day and Boarding School, that Jason transferred to once Piper and he broke up. They get out of the middle of a class, where Jason was expecting them. As he takes them to his dorm, explaining that he already killed a blemmyae and thinks a teacher was an empousa. He learns that Leo was alive and they discuss how Jason has created a redesign for Camp Jupiter to include more shrines for gods. Jason also reveals to Apollo that the Sybil gave him a dreadful prophecy: if he went after Caligula, either Jason or Piper would die permanently. Because of that, he plans to confront Caligula himself along with Apollo and Meg in order to protect Piper, even if that means his death. He made Apollo promise that he will bring his designs for the new Temple Hill to Camp Jupiter in case something happens to him, although Apollo refuses to believe that Jason would die. Jason also tells Apollo that if he eventually regains his godhood, he should remember what it's like to be human.\n\nThey take one of his school's vans to drive to Santa Barbara, searching the Stearns Wharf for hours. During dinner they see a fleet of yachts form a blockade around the harbor with the coastguard and local law enforcement helping with security. They agree to search the center ship. Piper talks some mercenaries into giving them their dinghy and they head to the heart of the blockade. Jason takes Piper up first. They are quickly captured by Pandai and, along with the recently captured Meg and Apollo, taken to an interrogation room. After Meg tricks them into revealing the locations of the shoes and Caligula, the daughter of Demeter attacks. Jason destroys one with a bolt of lightning, altering their presence on the boats. He and Meg go after Caligula while Piper and Apollo find the shoes. They then put up a fight before being imprisoned in tornadoes. He was shocked by Piper's condition. He breaks free of the twister prison and disintegrates numerous pandai before fighting Caligula. However, Jason was shot by multiple arrows on his arms and legs. It appears that he knew he could only buy them time, and his last words to Apollo were \"Get out of here! Go! GO! Remember!\" He holds his gaze just a moment too long, and Caligula, taking advantage of this, jabs him between the shoulder blades with a spear. Jason's final noble action was sacrificing himself to save Apollo, Meg, and Piper from the third emperor. He collapses from Tempest's back and falls face-first onto the boat floor, and Caligula stabs Jason in the back again to make sure he was dead.\n\nOnce the gang was onshore, they find Jason's body, blank as parchment and covered in slime, brought to them by Tempest. A heartbroken Piper begs Apollo to save him like how Leo took the Physician's Cure, but Apollo says death was not in his hands. Piper says they can use plants based on a Cherokee myth to save him, but Meg says that too will fail. Her last hope of using the Doors of Death was crushed by Apollo's gentle reminder that Jason was not a cheater and that he will not elude the laws of death. When Tristan McLean arrives, the Mist makes him believe Jason died in a surfing accident.\n\nLater, when Meg and Apollo met up with Piper in Santa Monica, Jason's coffin was being loaded into Tristan McLean's plane for Meg and Apollo to take to Camp Jupiter for Jason to be buried there. Leo Valdez drops in on Festus, and was told the bad news about Jason, Leo was extremely upset that he didn't get to see Jason after he died fighting Gaea. As he and Meg are flying to Camp Jupiter, Apollo swears vengeance on the Triumvirate for Jason Grace.\n\nThe Tyrant's Tomb[]\n\nApollo and Meg take his body to Camp Jupiter. On the way to camp, they are attacked by an Eurynomos who tries to eat both them and the son of Jupiter's body. However, they are saved by Lavinia Asimov and she takes them and Jason to camp. Along the way, they are attacked by two more eurynomos but they are soon defeated and the procession continues. Two days later he was given a state funeral with full honors.\n\nDuring the Battle of San Francisco Bay, Frank Zhang avenges Jason by killing Caligula by burning his stick. As Frank kills the emperor and avenges his friend's death, he states that it's for Jason Grace. Apollo notes that the last word Caligula ever heard was Jason's name.\n\nThe Tower of Nero[]\n\nAfter Apollo tends to Luguselwa the best he can, he passes out and dreams of the son of Jupiter. He apologizes for his death, but Jason says he chose the fate to save his friends. He then tells Apollo the Nero's fasces was guarded by something he knows, a servant of Mithras. But before he can say more he leaves.\n\nWhen Apollo visits Camp Jupiter, its stated that Jason's temple-expansion plan was still moving forward with new shrines being added every week. When Percy and Annabeth arrive at the camp, Annabeth tells Apollo that she cried herself sick at the news of Jason's death while Percy can barely talk about it without breaking down. The three agree that Jason was the best of them.\n\nWhile at Camp Half-Blood, Apollo discusses with Nico di Angelo a voice that he hears calling for help. Nico was sure that it might be Iapetus, but Apollo asks if it could be Jason. Nico admits that he considered the possibility and the idea of trying to find Jason and bring him back, but decided against it. Nico has a feeling that Jason made his choice and bringing him back wouldn't be honoring his sacrifice if Nico undid it, unlike Hazel who was floating around in Asphodel and needed to come back. Nico has a feeling that Jason was somewhere better now and Apollo suggests that Jason could be in Elysium or experiencing rebirth. However, Apollo has no idea for sure as he's clueless about after-death matters.\n\nMagnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard []\n\nThe Sword of Summer []\n\nJason was mentioned in the title of Chapter 48, with the title being, \"Hearthstone Passes Out Even More than Jason Grace (Though I Have No Idea Who That was)\".\n\nThe Ship of the Dead[]\n\nPercy mentions Jason when he talks about how you don't have to know about the sea to fight in the sea. He explains how the son of Jupiter saved him from Kymopoleia by offering her fame to Magnus and his friend, Alex Fierro.\n\nTowards the end of the novel, Annabeth calls Magnus and was crying. The reason was revealed to be Jason's death in The Burning Maze.\n\nThe Sun and the Star: A Nico di Angelo Adventure[]\n\nThe son of Jupiter was mentioned constantly when Nico was thinking of traumatic events and when speaking with Piper, who said she cared for Jason.\n\nAppearance[]\n\n“ If Jason were here, Calypso would fall all over him. She'd beg him to stay, but he'd be all noble about returning to his duties, and he'd leave Calypso brokenhearted. ”\n\n–Leo Valdez saying Calypso would fall in love with Jason, in The House of Hades.\n\nJason Grace was described to be extremely handsome, and he was arguably the most attractive demigod in the series. Jason had the regal features of a Roman statue, electric blue eyes, and close-cropped blond hair that grew out during his time at Camp Half-Blood. Jason also had a small scar on the corner of his lip from trying to eat a stapler when he was two years old. Piper noted that the scar made him look even more attractive. Piper said that his face was kind and gentle but always looked a little sad.\n\nJason looked nothing like his father. Instead, he looked more like his mother. Jason was very tall, he was one inch taller than Percy Jackson at the beginning of the quest, despite being nearly a year younger. Jason had a very athletic build; Piper said that Jason was more muscular than Percy. Leo described Jason to be \"rugged\" and handsome multiple times throughout the series. Leo also felt uncomfortable and jealous next him since Jason was really attractive. He had well-muscled, tanned arms and legs. His tattoo had the picture of an eagle with SPQR and twelve lines, indicating he had been at Camp Jupiter since he was three or four years old. Piper noted that his eyes seemed to hold some deep sadness, much like her father.\n\nJason's looked attract female attention; two daughters of Aphrodite, Drew Tanaka and Piper McLean, fell in love with Jason because of his good looked. Also, when Aphrodite gave Jason's team a makeover, Jason was the least modified, implying that Aphrodite approves of his physical attributes. Other females have fallen in love with Jason Grace and complimented his looked, like Reyna.\n\nIn The Mark of Athena, Annabeth Chase says that Jason was \"ruggedly handsome\" and he \"looked too perfect,\" which was why she didn't trust him. Percy Jackson described Jason to look like \"blond Superman\" when he's flying.\n\nIn The House of Hades, Leo Valdez states that if Jason fell in Ogygia instead, Calypso would fall in love with him due to his attractiveness and beg Jason to stay. After his encounter with Sciron, Jason's hair has had a groove in it since a Celestial Bronze bullet grazed him. Later in the quest, Piper said that Jason's height had grown taller, his body became more slender, and his hair had become longer and shaggier, giving it a \"rebellious\" look.\n\nIn The Blood of Olympus, Reyna described Jason to be the \"All-American Boy\" (and hes the only demigod Reyna complimented in terms of appearance). Reyna also says that Jason's electric blue eyes are intense, alert, and distracting. Nico says Jason looked like a fighter since he's constantly alert, has a lot of energy in his frame, and his stare was very intense. Nico describes Jason's blond hair to be shaggy like Will Solace. Eventually, Jason started wearing glasses made out of Imperial Gold due to being diagnosed by Asclepius as nearsighted.\n\nAlso, throughout the series, Khione (a beautiful snow goddess) was shown to be attracted to Jason's appearance. Khione genuinely wanted Jason to be one of her ice statues and was delighted when he became one. Khione later admits that she hated Piper for taking Jason away from her.\n\nIn The Burning Maze, Jason's hair was cut short again and had its original close-cropped style. Jason wore a regular school uniform and black-rimmed glasses. Apollo says that Jason looked quite \"impressive\" in terms of his physical appearance. During Jason's adventure, he wore his glasses, dress shirt, slacks, and loafers. Apollo said Jason's outfit made him look like a paralegal.\n\nPersonality[]\n\n“ But if a hero isn't ready to lose everything for a greater cause, is that person really a hero? ”\n\n–Jason to Apollo on being a hero in The Tower of Nero.\n\nJason Grace was a very responsible, kind, and open-minded person. Since he was not given a point of view until The Heroes of Olympus, much of his retroactive personality and quirks must be deduced from his memories and friendships but it was the general consensus that all who knew him thought him to be a very honorable and selfless person.\n\nMuch of Jason's personality derived from how his parentage caused him to be placed on a pedestal. On the outside, a lot of people initially regarded Jason as too perfect and straight-laced, with Reyna even thinking of him as the perfect 'all-American boy.' Due to the duality of Hera's scheme to join the camps, Jason was often seen as the opposite of Percy which causes people who really like Percy (like Annabeth and Hazel) to initially dislike/distrust Jason. In actuality, Jason was more similar than dissimilar to Percy. As centurion and then praetor, Jason mentions that there were multiple times when he chafed against the stringent rules and expectations of the legion. Although Jason followed rules and obeyed authority most of the time, he was actually a staunch proponent of change whenever he noticed someone was being treated unfairly. This can seen when he stood up to Zeus and called him 'unwise' for blaming the entirety of the Gaia crisis Apollo; or again when he dedicates himself towards giving minor gods the respect and recognition they deserve.\n\nJason had a tough time figuring out who he was and who he wanted to be. He came to resent being a son of Jupiter and thought his parentage was trapping him into a destiny he couldn't control - he hated that he was forced to be a leader, and treated like a prince-in-waiting. Jason's stay at Camp Half-Blood was quite transformative for him and without the pressure of the legion he becomes much more laid-back and introspective. He begins to break rules and crack jokes. He even allows his hair to grow out and become messier. Even though he enjoys his time there, it causes Jason to have an identity crisis because he feels as though he was betraying his roots and the people who have for so long followed him and given him a home. Jason thought he solved it by deciding to be Greek and resigning as Praetor in the House of Hades, but he questioned who he was even more after being stabbed by Michael Varus in Ithaca. Finally, as he faced Kymopoleia, Jason realized that he was both Greek and Roman. Both camps were a part of his family, and he decided to become a Pontifex Maximus. Afterwards he had no problem accepting his parentage and recognized Zeus as his father just as much as Jupiter.\n\nIt should be noted that Jason's tumultuous childhood left him with deep-seated abandonment wassues. Being deprived of the presence and memory of his sister and mother, he often felt alone and grew up believing he came from nothing. It was due to this, that what he learned at the Wolf House became the very formative pillars of his character - such as not showing weakness or insecurity, which sometimes caused others to see him as aloof and cold. He thinks of rules as promises he needs to keep, which was why he always hesitates before breaking them. A particular point of pain for Jason was learning about the life and subsequent death of his mother, and seeing her mania at Ithaca left him distressed. Jason can also be too noble and brave and often disregards his own safety for the sake of his loved ones, such as when he challenged Porphyrion without a weapon and dueled the emperor Caligula by himself, subsequently resulting in his own death.\n\nJason was also quite oblivious of peoples romantic feelings towards him (similar to Percy). Jason didn't realize that Reyna had a crush on him for years despite them being very close. Jason also didn't know Reyna was \"cursed\" by Aphrodite while the rest of Camp Jupiter did. Jason also didn't realize that Piper was jealous of Reyna while other Argo II members did, like Annabeth Chase and Hazel. However despite this lack of self-awareness, one of Jason's defining features was that he was very caring and often tries to help his loved ones overcome personal wassues.There are countless examples of this within the series such as Jason befriending Nico and immediately being accepting and supportive of his sexuality when he was outed by Cupid; Jason always befriending the unpopular kids at Camp Jupiter; and throughout The Lost Hero always trying to make Leo feel confident and wanted. He knew his friends very well and was the only person who can read Reyna's body language and understand when she was weary and tired, something other people cannot notice. It was in part because of his loving and enduring personality that his death was felt far and wide by all who knew him and even those who didn't.\n\nLastly, Jason's honorable personality made him favored by the gods. Hera considers Jason to be her champion and holds a motherly love for him. Athena approves of Jason and Artemis thanks him in The Blood of Olympus. Zeus [before Jason spoke against him] was proud of his son for his bravery during the quest. Apollo loved Jason dearly (despite not knowing him for long) and his death had a massive impact on him. In The Tower of Nero, Hera accuses her husband of not caring that Jason was dead, although Zeus insists that there was nothing he could have done to save him. In turn, Hera was shown to be deeply grieving the loss of Jason despite her usual dislike for her husband's demigod children.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nMagical Pets/Companions[]\n\nTempest - A chaotic storm spirit that was in the form of a horse made out of electricity and thunderclouds. It was found and tamed by Jason in The Lost Hero. Jason was later able to summon him for help in The Mark of Athena. During The Burning Maze, Tempest was seen returning Jason's body to his friends after he was killed by Caligula.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFamily[]\n\nLove Interests[]\n\nFriends[]\n\nEtymology[]\n\nJason was a masculine given name of Greek origin meaning \"healer\".\n\nGrace was a surname of English origin.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nJason was named after the original Jason, Hera's favorite hero, by Jupiter to please Juno after being conceived.\n\nPercy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, and Jason Grace are the only three demigods out of the Seven to fight in the Titan and Giant Wars consecutively (though Nico di Angelo has participated in some battles of both).\n\nOf all the Greek and Roman children of the Big Three, Jason was the only one who was not confirmed to have had his aging process interrupted at some point. His sister Thalia aged slowly as a tree and became immortal as a hunter, Percy, Bianca, and Nico all had their ages stunted in the Lotus Hotel and Casino, and Hazel stopped aging while she was dead.\n\nJason Grace was similar to Luke Castellan in several ways\n\nThey were both possessed by a figure from Greek mythology, turning their blue eyes gold (Kronos and eidolon respectively).\n\nThey are both accomplished swordsmen.\n\nThey both have a scar on their face (Luke's diagonally across his face, Jason's was on his lip)\n\nThey are both considered physically attractive and charismatic.\n\nThey both have charmed several women (Reyna and Piper McLean were in love with Jason. Annabeth Chase and Silena Beauregard had a crush on Luke).\n\nThey both have blond hair and blue eyes with athletic builds.\n\nThey both have a history with Thalia - Luke was her oldest friend, and Jason was her long-lost brother.\n\nThey both are repeatedly compared to Percy.\n\nThey both wielded a blade given to them by a deity (Backbiter, Juno's gladius).\n\nThey both killed a Titan (Kronos, Krios).\n\nBoth of their mothers were unstable - May Castellan was turned insane when she tried to become the Oracle of Delphi, and Beryl Grace was unable to handle Zeus/Jupiter leaving her.\n\nThey both led an attack on a deity's throne room - Luke (while being controlled by Kronos) led an attack on Mount Olympus before recovering his spirit and sacrificing his life to save it , and Jason led an attack on Mount Othrys simultaneously.\n\nThey both sacrificed themselves to save the other characters\n\nJason has fought six Giants and killed them, albeit with some help.\n\nHe killed Enceladus with the help of Piper, Leo and a lightning bolt from Zeus.\n\nHe killed Otis and Ephialtes with the help of Percy Jackson, Bacchus, and Leo.\n\nHe killed Clytius along with Nico, Piper, Hazel, Frank, and Hecate.\n\nHe helped Kymopoleia kill Polybotes.\n\nHe fought alongside Zeus to kill Porphyrion.\n\nJason was similar to Percy Jackson in several ways\n\nBoth were named after legendary Greek heroes\n\nBoth are children of the big three gods\n\nBoth are looked at as leaders of their respective camps\n\nBoth were praetors of Camp Jupiter at one point\n\nBoth are dense about love (Jason never realized that Reyna loved him for years, and Percy didn't know Annabeth Chase had a crush on him since she was 12)\n\nBoth are accomplished swordsmen\n\nSimilar to the original Jason, he was aided by Juno and was recognized by the fact that he was wearing only one shoe.\n\nJason and Thalia are the only known siblings to be from different aspects of the same god, while also having the same mortal parent. Thalia was a Greek demigod, being a daughter of Zeus, and Jason was Roman, being a son of Jupiter, as stated by Hera/Juno herself.\n\nUnlike other children of Zeus/Jupiter, Hera doesn't hate him or try to kill him like his other siblings. Hera said that she was Jason's patron and Jason was her champion. In The Tower of Nero, it's shown that Hera was grieving Jason's death and was angry at her husband for his apparent lack of care over it.\n\nThalia and Jason are both mentioned to like cheeseburgers just like Percy does.\n\nThe scar in Jason's mouth came from trying to eat a stapler when he was 2 years old. Because of this, Coach Hedge says that he has \"excellent taste.\"\n\nIt was mentioned by Aeolus that Jason once stayed with him on a quest to kill a sea monster. It was later revealed Jason had killed the Trojan Sea Monster.\n\nAlthough one of the demigods \"afflictions\" was usually dyslexia, Jason could read Midas' brochure for Gold: Invest for Eternity just fine. Although it may have been in Latin or Jason may not have dyslexia like Frank Zhang.\n\nJason claims to be the Praetor of the First Legion in The Lost Hero, but Camp Jupiter was made up of only the Twelfth Legion.\n\nIt's revealed in The House of Hades that he wanted the Twelfth Legion to be renamed the First Legion to symbolize a new start for Rome, but the idea was shot down.\n\nJason sometimes feels uncomfortable with the attention that was given to him due to him being the son of Jupiter and people expecting that he will not fail.\n\nPiper calls Jason Sparky and Lightning Boy on occasions.\n\nSo far, Jason was the first known mortal to have seen a god's true form and lived.\n\nThough this could've been because the Doors of Death were open at that time, giving Piper the chance to call Jason's soul back using charmspeak.\n\nDespite being Roman, Jason was a Greek name, meaning \"healer\". This was because Jupiter felt that naming him after Hera/Juno's favorite hero would quell her anger.\n\nJason's name being a way to placate Hera may be a nod towards his older half-brother Hercules who was named after her. Although it was to be noted that Hera did drive Hercules temporarily insane and killed his family.\n\nJason's birthday was revealed to be July 1, the first day of the month named after Julius Caesar and was also considered Juno's sacred day.\n\nJason and Piper were the only couple who were not from the same camp as Jason's Roman while Piper's Greek.\n\nLike Percy, Jason was also named after a legendary Greek hero.\n\nJason's favorite treat from the New Rome bakeries was brownies.\n\nHe was the only member of the Seven not to have met his godly parent in his respective form.\n\nWhen Jason, Percy, and Piper met Bacchus at the Topeka sign, Bacchus called Jason \"John Green,\" which was the name of an author who also writes young adult novels.\n\nThis was also similar to how Dionysus would call Percy variations on his name most of the time.\n\nApparently, Jason was nearsighted, causing him to wear glasses in The Blood of Olympus. This makes him one of the only demigods to wear glasses along with Meg McCaffrey as shown in The Hidden Oracle.\n\nHe has a mole on his left foot.\n\nHe plays lacrosse.\n\nCan draw really well as said in ToA\n\nInterestingly, Jason and Percy are the only two demigods that are compared to superheroes from DC Comics–Percy claims that Jason looked like a blonde Superman when he flies, while Leo and Meg jokingly call Percy Aquaman for his water-based abilities. Percy's half-sister Kymopoleia, on the other hand, was compared to a superhero from Marvel Comics – Captain America.\n\nJason has a chapter title in honor of him in The Sword of Summer.\n\nChapter 48 was \"Hearthstone Passes Out Even More than Jason Grace (Though I Have No Idea Who That was)\"\n\nThe chapter makes fun of Jason constantly getting knocked out as seen in The Mark of Athena.\n\nThis goes to the point that there was an official ship called 'Brason' which ships Jason with a brick. This was similar to the Adrissant ship from the Miraculous Fandom.\n\nIn \"Apollo's Puzzle Collection\" included in The Burning Maze books exclusive to Barnes & Noble, there was an acrostic describing Jason as \"Definition of a Hero\". This may foreshadow Jason's death at the hands of Caligula and his self-sacrifice to save Apollo, Meg and Piper.\n\nJupiter\n\nAssertive\n\nStrong\n\nOracle\n\nNoble\n\nJason was the first Roman demigod shown dying in the series with all other known deaths being either historically as in the case of Michael Varus who only appeared undead later, or being legacies like Octavian and Bryce Lawrence. He was also the first of the Seven to die and not be brought back to life in the same book as was the case with Hazel and Leo.\n\nAs revealed in Percy Jackson's Greek Heroes, Jason tends to leave his glasses on his head while he was looking for them.\n\nJason was the only character in the entire series to have both a known date of birth and date of death.\n\nGiven the attack on Camp Jupiter took place on April 8th, and there was a two day delay in Apollo and Meg flying to Camp Jupiter from Los Angeles, along with a further five or six total days it took for Commodus and Caligula to get to Camp Jupiter, it can be assumed that Jason Grace died on either March 31st or April 1.\n\nJason's birthday was the first day of July. His name could be considered an acronym, as it spells out the first letters of his birthday month and the following four. July, August, September, October, and November respectively.\n\nGallery[]\n\nThe Heroes of Olympus Core Series: The Lost Hero | The Son of Neptune | The Mark of Athena | The House of Hades | The Blood of Olympus Main Characters: Jason Grace | Piper McLean | Leo Valdez | Percy Jackson | Frank Zhang | Hazel Levesque | Annabeth Chase | Iapetus/Bob | Reyna Ramírez-Arellano | Nico di Angelo | Gleeson Hedge Secondary Characters: Hylla Ramírez-Arellano | Dakota | Tyson | Ella | Octavian | Halcyon Green | Dr. Howard Claymore | Alabaster C.
