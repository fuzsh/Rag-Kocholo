        "text": "DePaul University School of Law is seeking to hire an adjunct in its Business Law Clinic (the Clinic). The Clinic, the law school’s only In-House transactional clinic, provides law students the opportunity to offer legal counsel to corporations on transactional matters. These small businesses are referred to us as part of the Clinic's partnerships with the Women in Entrepreneurship Institute and the Coleman Entrepreneurship Center in the University’s College of Business.\n\nThe Clinic represents clients on legal issues faced by post-revenue for-profit businesses. The Clinic does not represent non-profits or individuals. The adjunct professor would be expected to help supervise 8 second and third-year law students as they counsel and represent these clients in transactional settings. Clinic clients often need assistance with transactional negotiations; drafting and negotiating contracts including service and licensing agreements; drafting corporate documents including shareholder agreements, corporate bylaws and operating agreements; drafting client memoranda; corporate transactional and corporate governance legal issues; real estate issues; employment law issues common with small businesses including employment law contracts and employee handbooks. Clients often also seek assistance with corporate intellectual property issues, such as advising on copyright and trademark registration issues, and technology and IP licensing matters.\n\nThe adjunct professor will be part of a team, working with the Clinic Director and Clinic staff that oversee the operation and development of the program. The applicant’s primary responsibility will be to help supervise and assist students with direct client representation matters, teach and assist with the development of curricular materials for the Clinic’s year-long seminar, and assist in the strategic growth and development of the Clinic. The Clinic runs for the academic year which runs from early August until mid-May.\n\nThe Clinic has two components the seminar and the client service component. The adjunct would be expected to teach some class sessions of the seminar and co-supervise the students. The class sessions meet in-person on Tues and Thurs from 1-2:50. The Clinic accepts 8 students per academic year who are divided into teams of 2 (4 teams). The expected time commitment would be (i) to attend most of the Thursday class sessions (approximately 2 hours per week from Aug until the end of November and again from mid-Jan until the end of April), (ii) to teach 2-3 Tuesday class sessions (approximately 2 hours per week during Fall semester) and, (iii) to attend the weekly team meetings (approximately 4 hours per week). The class sessions and the team meetings are during the workday.\n\nWhile adjunct appointments are on a semester-by-semester basis, the attorney will be expected to be a part of the Clinic during the 2024-2025 academic year with the possibility of renewal.\n\nInterested candidates are encouraged to apply early.\n\nTo learn more about the law school, visit our website here.
