        "text": "Bible department\n\nPurpose:\n\nYoung people who have become Christians need to establish roots and begin growing to maturity. Since it is true in all that it teaches, the inerrant Bible must be their sole authority for faith and practice. The student must understand the Bible to be God’s inspired written word, and as such, it is inerrant (2 Timothy 3:15-17).\n\nThe Bible is the primary source for biblical instruction at all grade levels. This instruction includes higher-level thinking skills built upon knowledge of biblical doctrine, right thinking, and memorization of Scripture. Students should be able to defend their faith to others.\n\nWe believe that students should be instructed and encouraged to allow their daily lives to be governed by the application of biblical truth by the guidance of the Holy Spirit. We hope that upon graduation, students will be able to participate in the marketplace of ideas for the cause of Christ (Acts 17:16-34).\n\nDepartment Chair:\n\nDr. Kevin Hall: B.A. in Biblical Theology and Apologetics, The Master’s University; M.Div. in Pastoral Ministry, The Master’s Seminary; Th.M. in Systematic Theology, The Master’s University; Ph.D. in Systematic Theology, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. 10th year at Grace.

All literature is analyzed through a Biblical worldview with Christ at the center.\n\nSpeaking and writing skills are also emphasized to a great degree. It is important for students to not only know how to interpret and analyze the ideas expressed in a work of literature but also to communicate their ideas clearly, effectively, and respectfully. Writing is an essential skill that transcends nearly all areas of life; therefore, the English department strives to prepare students in becoming highly effective and competent communicators by offering a myriad of speaking and writing opportunities.\n\ndepartment chair:\n\nMr. David Carter: B.A. in Biblical Studies, The Master’s University; B.A. in English: Literary Criticism, William Jessup University.

Studying different cultures also aids the understanding of others as well as the fulfillment of the Great Commission. Our goal here at Grace is that each language student would not only acquire a language but also would have a greater understanding of other cultures and would be able to share their faith wherever the Lord would lead them.\n\nThe Grace Language Department facilitates whole language acquisition that will be useful in real-world situations. Students will have the opportunity to develop their speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills in the target language.

As mathematics is studied in the classroom, its greatest value can be seen as it reflects the wisdom and purpose of our Creator. Our teachers relate biblical truths to the beauty of math. We believe that math is a God-given tool for learning problem-solving skills. What the students study today will be used in life tomorrow.\n\nThe mathematics department enhances the traditional study of math with demonstrations and the utilization of computer programs, online activities, and manipulatives. We use a variety of activities and assessments to encourage deeper understanding and competency.\n\nDepartment Chair:\n\nMrs. Lauri Kreiger: B.A. in Liberal Studies, California State University, Northridge; M.S. in Marriage and Family Therapy, Fuller Theological Seminary.
