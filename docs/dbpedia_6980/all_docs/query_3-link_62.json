        "text": "System Configuration\n\nYou can customize FortiSOAR and configure several default options used throughout the system, including the way FortiSOAR gets displayed to the users and the way notifications are sent to the users. To configure the system, you must be assigned CRUD permissions to the Application module. The Application module is assigned by default to the Application Administrator role. For information about roles, refer to the Default Roles section in the Security Management chapter.\n\nClick the Settings ( ) icon to open the System (System Configuration) page. Use the Application Configuration tab on the System Configuration page to edit several default options found throughout the system, especially in the user profile. These include the following:\n\nDefault notifications for system and cluster health monitoring\n\nDefault Comment Modification\n\nSetting a language other than English for your FortiSOAR UI\n\nDefault Playbook Execution Logging Levels\n\nDefault Playbook Recovery options\n\nDefault rendering of expressions in the Playbook Designer (Simplified Expression View)\n\nDefault DateTime Format\n\nDefault timezone for exporting reports\n\nHiding the FortiSOAR Setup Guide\n\nDefault theme\n\nPurging of audit logs and executed playbook logs and cleaning the database\n\nSettings for recycle bin records including, purging of recycle bin records and restricting permanent deletion recycle bin records\n\nDefault country code\n\nDefault navigation bar style\n\nManage user listings in People Lookup fields\n\nEnable MIME type validation for file uploads\n\nFor more information on user profile configuration, refer to the User Profiles section in the Security Management chapter.\n\nYou can modify all the default values on a per-user basis on any user's Profile page.\n\nTo enable sending system notifications, including requests for resetting passwords, and also for sending emails outside FortiSOAR you must configure the SMTP connector. For more information on FortiSOAR Built-in connectors, including the SMTP connector, see the \"FortiSOAR Built-in connectors\" article.\n\nClick Settings > Audit Log to open the Audit Log page. Use the Audit Log page to view a chronological record of all actions across FortiSOAR. For more information, see Audit Log.\n\nClick Settings > License Manager to open the License Manager page. Use the License Manager page to update your license and view the details of your FortiSOAR license. For more information, see License Manager.\n\nClick Settings > Notifications to open the Notifications page. Use the Notifications page to configure rules for delivery of notifications and also configure notification channels. For more information, see Notifications.\n\nClick Settings > Data Archival to open the Data Archival page. Use the Data Archival page to configure settings for data archival and to search for records in the data archives. For more information, see Data Archival.\n\nUse the Environment Variables tab on the System Configuration page to add proxies to serve HTTP, HTTPS, or other protocol requests from FortiSOAR or define environment variables. For the procedure for configuring proxy settings and defining environment variables is included in the Configuring Proxy Settings and environment variables topic in the Additional configuration settings for FortiSOAR chapter of the \"Deployment Guide.\"\n\nUse the Branding tab on the System Configuration page to customize FortiSOAR branding based on your license type. For more information, see Branding.\n\nUse the System Fixtures tab on the System Configuration page to view the links to various playbook collections, email templates, and the self agent and self tenant pages, which are included by default with FortiSOAR. For more information, see System Fixtures.\n\nApplication Configuration\n\nOn the Application Configuration page, you can configure settings that will apply across FortiSOAR. You can edit the settings and then click Save to apply the changes or click Revert to revert your changes.\n\nConfiguring System and Cluster Health Monitoring\n\nYou can set up system monitoring for FortiSOAR, both in the case of a single node system and in High Availability (HA) clusters. To receive email notifications of any FortiSOAR service failure, or of any monitored threshold exceeding the set threshold, etc., click the Enable Notification checkbox in the System & Cluster Health Monitoring section.\n\nOnce you click the Enable Notification checkbox, from the Service drop-down list, select the service to be used for notifications. You can choose between SMTP or Exchange. In the Email field, specify a comma-separated list of email addresses of users who should receive email notifications in case of any FortiSOAR service failures, or of any monitored threshold exceeding the set threshold, etc.\n\nIn the Monitoring Interval (Minutes) field, specify the interval in minutes at which you want to monitor the system and perform the health check of the HA cluster. By default, the system is monitored every 5 minutes.\n\nIn the System Health Thresholds section, you can set the thresholds, in percentages, for Memory Utilization (80% default), CPU Utilization (80% default), Disk Utilization (80% default), Swap Memory Utilization (50% default), Workflow Queue, i.e., the value of the celery queue size, and WAL Files Size (GB), which by default is set as 20 GB. The default value of the workflow queue is set at 100. If the thresholds set are reached or crossed for any of the monitored parameters, an email notification is sent to all the specified email addresses.\n\nIf you have an HA environment, then additionally, RabbitMQ certificates, Nginx certificates, and self-signed PostgreSQL certificates are also monitored and notifications can be sent to specified users when any of the certificates is nearing expiry.\n\nHeartbeat failures and replication lags between nodes of your HA cluster can also be monitored and notifications can be sent to specified users in the event of heartbeat failures and high replication lags between nodes of your HA cluster. You can specify values for these parameters in the Cluster Health section:\n\nIn the Missed Heartbeat Count field, specify the number of missed heartbeats after which notifications of failure will be sent to all the specified email addresses.\n\nIn the Replication Lag field, specify the lag value for the replication lag between nodes. By default, this is set to 3, i.e., 3GB. If the replication lag threshold is reached or crossed, then an email notification is sent to all the specified email addresses.\n\nSome examples of how Monitoring Interval (Minutes) and Missed Heartbeat Count values help you in monitoring heartbeats between nodes in an HA cluster:\n\nCase 1\n\nIf you have set the Monitoring Interval to 5 minutes and the Missed Heartbeat Count to 3, this means that when the heartbeat is missed (the cyops-ha service is down) for the last >=15 minutes (monitoring interval * missed heartbeat count), the heartbeat missed notification will be sent to all the email addresses that you have specified in the Email field.\n\nThe cluster health check is performed based on the monitoring interval specified. For example, if you specify 3 minutes in the Monitoring Interval (Minutes) field, then the HA cluster health check will be run every 3 minutes.\n\nNotifications are sent based on the multiplication of the values that you have set in the monitoring interval and the missed heartbeat count. For example, if you have set the monitoring interval to 3 and missed heartbeat count to 4, and if the heartbeat is missed for the last >=12 minutes, then heartbeat missed notifications will be sent to all the email addresses that you have specified in the Email field.\n\nCase 2\n\nIf you have had no heartbeats missed for the last >=15 minutes, considering the monitoring interval that is set to 5 minutes and the missed heartbeat count set to 3, however, there is a service down or a service connectivity failure found in the health check, then a notification for service down or service connectivity failure will be sent to all the email addresses that you have specified in the Email field.\n\nFor more information on HA, see the High Availability support in FortiSOAR chapter.\n\nConfiguring Comments\n\nA user who has Security Update permissions can edit comments of any FortiSOAR user, and a user who has Security Delete permissions can delete comments of any FortiSOAR user. There is no time limit for the Security user to update or delete comments.\n\nUsers can edit and delete their own comments in the \"Collaboration\" window or in the Comments widget, if you (the administrator) has enabled the settings for comment modification and if the user has appropriate CRUD permissions on the Comments module.\n\nTo allow users to edit and delete their own comments, click the Settings icon, which opens the System Configuration page. On the Application Configuration tab, in the Comment Modification section, select the Allow Comment Modification checkbox.\n\nYou can also specify the time until when the user can edit or delete their comments in the Allow users to modify /delete their comments for a duration of field. For example, if you select 1 minute from this field, then users can edit and delete their comments until 1 minute after which they have added the comment. By default, the Allow users to modify/delete their comments for a duration of field is set to 5 minutes. Users cannot edit or delete their comments after the time specified in the Allow users to modify/delete their comments for a duration of field.\n\nYou can also specify the behavior of the comment \"delete\" action, i.e., when a user deletes a comment, you can choose to permanently delete the comment or flag the comment for deletion, i.e., Soft Delete. If you choose to keep the Soft Delete checkbox checked (default), then the comments will be soft deleted, i.e., on the UI you will see --Comment Deleted-- instead of the comment. In case you have cleared the Soft Delete checkbox, you will not see anything on the UI since the comment has been permanently deleted.\n\nSetting a language other than English for your FortiSOAR system\n\nSupport for 'Internationalization' has been added to the FortiSOAR platform in release 7.5.0, enabling FortiSOAR to meet the linguistic, cultural, and other needs of a particular locale. The default language set for the FortiSOAR UI is English, with additional support now available for the following languages:\n\nJapanese (Preview)\n\nKorean (Preview)\n\nSimplified Chinese (Preview)\n\nTo support internationalization, FortiSOAR uses a system widget named \"Language Pack\" that includes the supported languages. This widget is automatically installed during the installation or upgrade of FortiSOAR to release 7.5.0 or later.\n\nAdministrators must be assigned the 'Read' or 'Usage' permission on 'Widgets' (in addition to other necessary permissions) to modify the global language settings. Without this permission, the FortiSOAR UI remains in English, regardless of the language you set.\n\nTo change the language in FortiSOAR for all users, switch from English to any of the supported languages by clicking the Settings icon, which opens the System Configuration page. In the Set Language section, select the language you want from the Select Language drop-down list for the FortiSOAR UI then click Save to apply the change:\n\nUsers can set the language for their FortiSOAR instance in their profile. The language set in the user profile takes precedence over the language set by an administrator. For example, if the administrator sets the FortiSOAR language to 'Korean' using this process, but a user sets their profile language to 'Japanese', the user's FortiSOAR UI will be displayed in Japanese. For information on setting the language in a user profile, refer to the Overview chapter in the \"User Guide.\"\n\nWhen changing the language in FortiSOAR from English to any of the supported language, all static text in the FortiSOAR UI gets displayed in the selected language. Static text includes labels of fields, tabs, and buttons, titles of dialog boxes, descriptions, static message content, such as content displayed in confirmation, error, or warning messages, etc.\n\nContent that can be changed by the user, gets displayed in English and not in the selected language, some examples of such type of content include:\n\nNames or titles of playbooks, connectors, and built-in widgets such as charts, grids, tabs, etc.\n\nTab names, headings, subheadings, etc., in the record detail view and list view as these are user-editable fields.\n\nValues of picklist items and navigation menu items.\n\nFor modules (mmd) on the Module Editor page, the name of a module and the title of a field must be in English, as the Type (for modules) and Field API Key (for fields) are auto-generated and must be in English as they are used to identify the module or field in the API.\n\nApart from the above the following content also gets displayed in English and not in the selected language:\n\nSyslogs forwarded from a FortiSOAR system.\n\nPlaybook step results.\n\nGrid view exported in the CSV format.\n\nTooltips, error messages, and toaster messages that are generated from the backend such as tooltips on the Module Editor page or the health check disconnected error message for the Recommendation Engine.\n\nFor information on various services, functions, etc., added for multilingual support for widgets created starting from release 7.5.0, see the \"Widget Development Guide.\"\n\nEditing locale files for existing modules\n\nYou can modify the files for the supported locales (Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese) for existing modules using the Export and Import Wizards. For details on these wizards, see the Export and Import Wizards topic in the Application Editor chapter. If you want to update some translations of modules, such as the 'Alerts' Module, follow these steps:\n\nExport the 'Alerts' module and download the .zip file of the export.\n\nExtract the downloaded .zip file to your local disk. A sample folder structure of the exported 'Alerts' module is as follows:\n\nexportTemplate folder\n\n--+ modules\n\n---+ alerts\n\n-----+ languages\n\n-------+ en.json\n\n-------+ ja.json\n\n-------+ ko.json\n\n-------+ zh_cn.json\n\n-----+ detail-layout.json\n\n-----+ form-layout.json\n\n-----+ list-layout.json\n\n-----+ mmd.json\n\n--+ picklists\n\n--+ records\n\n--+ info.json\n\nOpen the language json file you want to edit for the module. For example, to edit the Japanese language file, open the ja.json file.\n\nUpdate the necessary translations and save the file.\n\nCreate a .zip file of the Alerts module with the updated translations.\n\nImport the zip file to your FortiSOAR instance using the Import Wizard.\n\nAfter a successful import, you will see the updated translations for the 'Alerts' module.\n\nPurging of audit logs and executed playbook logs and reclaiming unused disk space\n\nYou can schedule purging, on a global level, for both audit logs and executed playbook logs. Click the Settings icon, which opens the System Configuration page. In the Purge Logs section, you can define the schedule for purging both Audit Logs and Executed Playbook Logs.\n\nBy default, audit logs are not purged and executed playbooks logs are purged.\n\nPurging logs deletes old records from the respective tables; however, it does not free up the PostgreSQL database space, which could cause space and performance issues in FortiSOAR. Therefore, from version 7.0.2 onward, FortiSOAR provides you with an option to reclaim unused disk space. This activity clears all the empty rows in tables and indexes, which helps in improving the performance by optimizing the space. By default, this cleanup activity is run \"Weekly at 02:01 AM (UTC) on Sunday\"; however, you have the ability to update the schedule of this cleanup activity as per your requirement.\n\nScheduling purging of audit logs\n\nTo purge Audit Logs, you must be assigned a role that has a minimum of Read permission on the Security module, Read permission on the Application module, and Delete permissions on the Audit Log module.\n\nTo enable purging of Audit logs, select the Enable Purging checkbox that appears in the Audit Logs section.\n\nOnce you select the Enable Purging checkbox, you require to define the schedule for purging of audit logs. To specify the time for which you want to retain the logs, you must select the appropriate option from the Keep logs Of drop-down list. You can choose from the following options: Last month, Last 3 months, Last 6 months, Last year, or Custom as shown in the following image:\n\nIf you choose Custom, then you must specify the number of days for which you want to retain the logs.\n\nThe purging schedule clears all logs that belong to a timeframe earlier than what you have specified.\n\nFor example, if you want to retain audit logs for a month, then select Last month from the Keep logs of drop-down list. Once you save this setting all audit logs that are older than 1 month (30 days) will be cleared, and this will be an ongoing process, as the audit log records will all be time-stamped and the ones older than 30 days will be purged.\n\nScheduling purging of executed playbook logs\n\nTo purge Executed Playbook Logs, you must be assigned a role that has a minimum of Read and Update permissions on the Security module, Read and Update permissions on the Application module, and Delete permissions on the Playbooks module.\n\nPurging of executed playbook logs based on date or days criteria\n\nExecuted Playbook Logs are purged by default, and therefore the Enable Purging checkbox is already selected in the Executed Playbook Logs section. By default, any executed playbook logs that are older than 15 days are purged. You can change time for which you want to retain the playbook execution logs by selecting the appropriate option from the Keep logs Of drop-down list, as is the case with audit logs.\n\nA system schedule, named \"Purge Executed Playbook Logs\" is also already created and active on the Schedules page. This schedule runs every midnight (UTC time) and clears all logs that have exceeded the time duration that is specified. If you want to run the purging activity at a different time of the day or for a different duration, you can do so by editing this schedule.\n\nPurging of executed playbook logs based on criteria other than date or days\n\nFrom version 7.0.0 onwards, you can purge executed playbook logs based on some complex query condition that involves multiple parameters and not just the date or days criteria. For example, clearing logs of ingestion playbooks that have completed their execution. Being able to clear logs based on these criteria is useful since ingestion playbooks are generally scheduled and they can occupy a major chunk of playbook history in the database. Therefore, this feature provides you with an option to build desired queries for purging executed playbook logs and scheduling the purging.\n\nTo add the custom criteria, based on the clearing ingestion playbook that have completed their execution example, do the following:\n\nClick the +Additional Criteria link.\n\nIn the Criteria Title field, enter the title of the criteria based on which you want to purge the executed playbook logs. For example, Purging Ingestion Playbook Logs.\n\nSelect the logical operator, All of the below are True (AND), or Any of the below is True (OR). For our example, we require the AND operator, since we want to purge all playbooks that contain the \"ingestion\" tag and whose status is finished, so select All of the below are True (AND).\n\nClick the Add Condition link to add conditions for purging the executed playbook logs:\n\nFrom the Select a field drop-down, select Tags, from the Operator drop-down list select Contains Any and in the Add Tags field, enter dataingestion. Click the Add Condition link again, and from the Select a field drop-down, select Status, from the Operator drop-down list select Equals, in the Status drop-down list select Finished.\n\nYou can add additional conditions or criteria as per your requirements.\n\nSchedule the purging of the executed playbooks logs based on the above-specified criteria by selecting the appropriate option from the Keep Logs Of drop-down list. You can choose from the following options: Last month, Last 3 months, Last 6 months, Last year, or Custom.\n\nFor our example, we choose the Custom option and specify 1 for days, which means that keep the logs for the ingestion playbooks that have finished their execution for just 1 day in the database.\n\nTo save the criteria for purging executed playbook logs, click Save.\n\nPoints to be considered while setting multiple purging criteria\n\nIf you have added multiple purging criteria, then the purge functionality purges logs sequentially.\n\nFor example, if you have defined the following criteria\n\nDefault: Keep logs of the last 2 days.\n\nIf 'Playbook Execution Status = Failed', then keep logs for last 1 day.\n\nIf Tags contain Ingest, then keep logs for last 1 day.\n\nIn such a scenario, logs are purged as follows:\n\nRetains logs for the last 2 days only, and purges the remaining logs.\n\nFrom the logs of the last 2 days, looks for logs that have 'Playbook Execution Status = Failed', and keeps such logs for the last 1 day only.\n\nLooks for logs that have 'Tags' containing 'Ingest', and keeps such logs for the last 1 day only.\n\nScheduling storage space reclamation\n\nTo reclaim unused space, ensure that the Storage Space Reclamation option is selected (default). This activity clears all the empty rows in tables and indexes, which helps in improving the performance by optimizing the space.\n\nYou can schedule regular storage space reclamation to ensure that space gets regularly freed up in the PostgreSQL database as per your requirements.\n\nIn the Storage Space Reclamation Settings section, you can select the frequency of running the storage space reclamation activity. You can choose between running this activity Weekly or Daily or to some custom frequency based on your requirements. By default, a system schedule named \"Reclaim Disk Space (Playbook Logs)\" is created in Automation > Schedules to periodically clear the playbook execution logs \"Weekly at 02:01 AM on Sunday\".\n\nTo change this schedule to a custom frequency, click the View link to display its Schedule Details and edit the schedule as per your requirement, and then click Save. For example, to run this activity \"Weekly on Mondays at 12:01\", change the schedule as follows:\n\nYou can view the % of disk space that is being used for playbook logs that is eligible for cleanup and which can be reclaimed, and you can also immediately initiate a cleanup of playbook logs by clicking the Initiate Cleanup Now link, which displays a confirmation dialog. Clicking Confirm on the dialog immediately starts the disk space reclamation activity.\n\nConfiguring the logging level for Playbook Execution Logs\n\nYou can define the logging levels for your playbook execution logs, both globally as well as at the individual playbook level. On the System Configuration page, you can choose either INFO or DEBUG as the global playbook logging level.\n\nINFO is set as the default global playbook logging level for fresh installations of FortiSOAR. If you are upgrading FortiSOAR, then the DEBUG mode is set as the default playbook logging level to ensure that there is no data loss.\n\nINFO: At the 'INFO' (default) level, only the final playbook execution status and individual playbook step status information is available after playbooks have completed their execution. It is recommended that you keep the logging level at INFO for production instances and in scenarios where you want to use storage space efficiently.\n\nWhen you retain the default INFO logging level, the Enable DEBUG level logging for failed playbooks checkbox is selected by default, which means that 'DEBUG-level' logging is set for failed playbooks and users do not need to rerun the playbook to view the exact reason for playbook failures.\n\nDEBUG: At the 'DEBUG' level, detailed logging is enabled that includes additional execution information like step input, output, configurations and other details.\n\nEnabling DEBUG level logging can quickly fill up the storage space. It is recommended to use it only while designing or debugging playbooks, or use this option wisely only for certain playbooks where this data might be useful\n\nRetaining the selection of the Allow individual playbook log level logging settings to override global settings checkbox honors the logging level that has been set at the individual playbook level. If you clear this checkbox, or do not change the logging level at the individual playbook level (default is INFO), then the global playbook logging level gets applicable. This is useful if you want to temporarily switch logging for the entire environment.\n\nConfiguring Playbook Recovery\n\nUse the autosave feature in playbooks to recover playbook drafts in cases where you accidentally close your browser or face any issues while working on a playbook.\n\nIn the Playbook Recovery section, you can define the following:\n\nIf you do not want FortiSOAR to save playbook drafts, clear the Enable Playbook Recovery option. By default, this option is checked.\n\nIn the Save Drafts Every field, enter the time, in seconds, after which FortiSOAR will save playbook drafts. By default, FortiSOAR saves playbook drafts 15 seconds after the last change.\n\nThe minimum time that you can set for saving playbook drafts is 5 seconds after the last change.\n\nConfiguring the Simplified Expression View\n\nFor fresh installations of FortiSOAR release 7.4.0 or later, by default, the Simplified Expression View option is selected on the System Configuration page, rendering a simplified expression based on tags rather than the full Jinja expression in the playbook designer.\n\nFor upgraded FortiSOAR systems, by default, the Simplified Expression View option is cleared. If you deselect this option, then the complete Jinja expressions are displayed in the playbook designer. For more information, see the \"Playbooks Guide.\"\n\nSystem Settings for Recycle Bin\n\nScheduling purging of recycle bin records\n\nYou can schedule the purging of recycle bin records to periodically clear the soft-deleted records from the recycle bin. For more information, see the Recycle Bin chapter.\n\nTo purge Recycle Bin records, you must be assigned a role that has a minimum of Read and Update permissions on the 'Application' module. To enable purging of recycle bin records do the following:\n\nClick the Settings icon, which opens the System Configuration page.\n\nIn the Purge Recycle Bin section, select Enable Purging.\n\nOnce you select the Enable Purging checkbox, you require to define the schedule for purging of recycle bin records.\n\nIn the Purge Recycle Bin section, set up the purging schedule, which is a system schedule named 'Recycle Bin Cleanup' that runs periodically as per the time-frame you have configured and purges recycle bin records:\n\nClick View beside Schedule Status, which is set to Inactive, to open the Schedule Details dialog.\n\nClick Start Schedule to begin the schedule immediately, or you can also set the Start Time and End Time for the schedule.\n\nIn the Schedule Frequency section, choose the frequency of running this schedule.\n\nFor example, to purge recycle bin records daily at 6:00 am, click Daily and then in the hour field enter 6 and in the minute field enter 0.\n\nFrom the Timezone drop-down list, select the timezone in which you want the schedule to run. By default, this is set as UTC.\n\nIf you want to ensure that you do not rerun the workflow, if previous scheduled instance is yet running, then click Limit execution to one active instance at a time.\n\n(Optional) From the Start Time field, select the date and time from when the schedule should start running.\n\n(Optional) From the End Time field, select the date and time till when the schedule should run, i.e., the date and time to stop the schedule. For more details on schedules, see the Schedules chapter in the \"User Guide.\"\n\nClick Save to save the schedule.\n\nOnce the schedule is saved, you can see that the Schedule Status has changed to Active:\n\nTo specify the time for which you want to retain the recycle bin records, you must select the appropriate option from the Keep records upto drop-down list. You can choose from the following options: Last month, Last 3 months, Last 6 months, Last year, or Custom as shown in the following image:\n\nIf you choose Custom, then you must specify the number of days for which you want to retain the recycle bin records.\n\nFor example, if you want to retain the recycle bin records for a month, then select Last month from the Keep records upto drop-down list. Once you save this setting all recycle bin records that are older than 1 month (30 days) will be cleared, and this will be an ongoing process, as the records will all be time-stamped and the ones older than 30 days will be purged.\n\nRestricting access for permanent deletion of recycle bin records to only \"admin\" users\n\nTo restrict access for permanently deleting records to only users with the 'Administrator' role, i.e., users having Delete permission on the 'Application' module, select the Restrict Permanent Delete option. If you enable this settings, then non-admin users can soft-delete records but cannot permanently delete them, which would help prevent accidental deletion of records by non-admin users. For more information on the Recycle Bin, see the Recycle Bin chapter.\n\nSetting the formats for Date and DateTime fields on the FortiSOAR UI\n\nUsing standard syntax (https://angular.io/api/common/DatePipe), you can customize the formats for Date and DateTime fields on the FortiSOAR UI.\n\nTo configure the formats for the DateTime and Date fields, in the Datetime Format section, from the Select Datetime Format drop-down list, select the required DateTime format. Similarly, from the Select Date Format drop-down list, select the required Date format and click Save.The FortiSOAR UI now displays all DateTime and Date fields in the set format.\n\nFor example, if you set the DateTime format to 'HH:mm EEEE MMMM dd', all the DateTime fields on the FortiSOAR UI, such as Resolved Date, Ack Due Date, etc., will be present in this format, i.e., as '15:24 Wednesday August 30'.\n\nConfiguring the default timezone for exporting reports\n\nYou can define a timezone that will be used by default for exporting reports. This timezone will be applied by default to all reports that you export from the Reports page. To apply the default timezone, click the Enable Timezone Selection option in the Report Export section. Then from the Timezone drop-down list, search for and select the timezone in which you want to export the report. For example, if you want to search for the timezone of Los Angeles, you can type los in the search box below the Timezone field to find the correct timezone, as shown in the following image:\n\nManaging user listings in People Lookup fields\n\nFrom version 7.0.1 onwards, you can choose to display only active users in 'people lookup' fields, such as assignedTo, across FortiSOAR. To manage user listings in people look up fields, ensure that the Restrict People Lookups To Active Users checkbox in the People Lookup Filter section is selected. If the Restrict People Lookups To Active Users checkbox is cleared then both active and inactive users will be displayed in people lookup fields.\n\nEnabling MIME type validations for file uploads\n\nYou can specify the MIME types that will be disallowed from being uploaded in Attachments, Comments, or any other modules that have fields of type 'File'. Using this option, administrators can restrict potentially malicious files of types such as .exe, .bat, etc. to be uploaded into FortiSOAR, which users can later download. FortiSOAR has not added this restriction as defaults since there could be business use cases such as where users as part of automation read the file being sent to them in emails, and then upload the same to FortiSOAR to be used in the future for different operations like sandboxing, etc. Therefore, administrators can enable MIME type validations for file uploads as per their organization’s policies by adding MIME types in the Restricted File MIME Types section:\n\nFrom release 7.2.1 onwards, by default, SVG files are disallowed from being uploaded in any modules that have fields of type 'File'. If you want to allow uploading of SVG files, then you can remove the image/svg and image/svg+xml tags from the Restricted File MIME Types section.\n\nIn addition to restricting MIME types, you can also block specific HTML tags and attributes from being added to HTML content in Rich Text fields. For more information, see Blocking specific HTML tags and attributes.\n\nHiding the FortiSOAR Setup Guide\n\nThe FortiSOAR Setup Guide helps first-time or recurrent administrators of FortiSOAR to optimally set up FortiSOAR based on best practices. For more information on the FortiSOAR Setup Guide, see the Overview chapter.\n\nBy default, the FortiSOAR Setup Guide icon and notification are visible in the top-right corner of FortiSOAR:\n\nIf you want to hide the FortiSOAR Setup Guide icon and notifications, on the System Configuration page, clear the Enable Setup Guide option, which is selected by default, and click Save:\n\nOnce the updated setting is saved, you will observe that the FortiSOAR Setup Guide icon and notification are not visible in the top-right corner of FortiSOAR.\n\nConfiguring Themes\n\nYou can configure the FortiSOAR theme that will apply to all the users in the system.\n\nNon-admin users can change the theme by editing their user profile. Changes made by a non-admin user to the theme are applicable only to those users who have not changed their default user profile settings.\n\nThere are currently three theme options, Dark, Light, and Space, with Space being the default. On the Application Configuration page, select the theme that you want to apply across FortiSOAR. Click Preview Theme to view how the theme would look and click Save to apply the theme.\n\nTo revert the theme to the default, click Revert Theme.\n\nConfiguring Default Country Code\n\nYou can configure country code format for contact numbers that will apply to all users in the system. In the Phone Number section, select the Default Country and thereby the default country code that you want to apply across FortiSOAR and click Save to apply the code.\n\nConfiguring Navigation Preferences\n\nYou can configure the behavior of the left navigation bar across FortiSOAR. You can choose whether you want the left navigation bar to collapse to just display icons of the modules or expand to display both icons and titles of modules. In the Navigation Preferences section, click Collapse Navigation to collapse the left navigation bar and click Save to apply the behavior of the left navigation bar across the system.\n\nLog Forwarding\n\nMany organizations use an external log management server (syslog server) to manage logs and maintain all logs at a single place, making analysis efficient. From version 6.4.3 onwards, FortiSOAR application logs and audit logs can be forwarded to your central log management server that supports a Rsyslog client, using both the FortiSOAR UI and the csadm CLI. You can also select the category of the logs you want to forward to the external log management server. For information about configuring forwarding of logs to an external log management server using the CLI, see the FortiSOAR Admin CLI chapter.\n\nYou could also send FortiSOAR logs to a SIEM, since all SIEMs support syslog ingestion, and which would help you achieve the following\n\nEase High Availability (HA) troubleshooting since now you can use consolidated logs instead of having to go individual nodes to debug HA issues.\n\nAbility to forward FortiSOAR logs to your SIEM, if you have a policy of setting up log forwarding to SIEM for all your production devices.\n\nOnce the logs are in the a SIEM, you can further configure rules for raising alerts for specific failure, making system monitoring more effective.\n\nClick Settings > System Configuration and then click the Log Forwarding tab to open the Log Forwarding page. Use the Log Forwarding page to setup, modify, and enable or disable your syslog forwarding of FortiSOAR logs to your central syslog server. To enable syslog forwarding, click the Enable Log Forwarding check box.\n\nOnce you select the Enable Log Forwarding, you require to fill in the details of the syslog server to which you want to forward the FortiSOAR logs, the type of logs to forward, etc.\n\nYou can configure only a single syslog server.\n\nIn the Configuration Name field, add the name of the configuration in which you want to store the log forwarding configuration details.\n\nNote: The name that you specify must not have any special characters, underscores, or spaces.\n\nIn the Syslog Server Details section, enter the following details:\n\nIn the Server field enter the DNS name or IP address of the syslog server to which you want to forward the FortiSOAR logs.\n\nFrom the Protocol drop-down list, select the protocol that you want to use to communicate with the syslog server. You can choose between UDP, TCP, or RELP.\n\nIn the Port field enter the port number that you want to use to communicate with the syslog server.\n\n(Optional) To securely communicate with the syslog server, click Enable TLS.\n\nOnce you click Enable TLS, in the Certificate field, you must enter your CA certificate.\n\nIf you have a client certificate for your FortiSOAR client, then in the Client Certificate and Client Key fields, you must enter the client certificate and the client key.\n\nIn the Choose Log Types To Forward section, choose the types of FortiSOAR logs you want to forward to the syslog server.\n\nApplication Logs include OS logs, and this checkbox is selected by default. To also forward FortiSOAR audit logs, click the Audit Logs checkbox. Once you select audit logs, you can define the following:\n\nFrom the Specify Audit Log Detail Level drop-down list, select the amount of data, Basic or Detailed that you want to forward to the syslog server. Basic (default and recommended) sends high-level details of the event per audit log, whereas Detailed sends detailed information about the event per audit log.\n\nIn the Configure Audit Log Forward Rules section, define the rules to forward audit logs:\n\nFrom the Record Type drop-down list, select the record types such as, Alerts, Incidents, etc. whose audit logs you want to forward to the syslog server.\n\nFrom the User drop-down list, select the users such as, CS Admin etc., whose audit logs you want to forward to the syslog server.\n\nFrom the Operation drop-down list, select the operations such as Create, UpdateConfig, Delete, etc., whose audit logs you want to forward to the syslog server.\n\nFrom the Playbooks drop-down list, select the operations such as Generate Incident Summary Report, Playbook Execution History Cleanup, etc., whose audit logs you want to forward to the syslog server.\n\nTo add more rules, click the Define More Rules link.\n\nImportant: If you do not define rules, then all the audit logs will be forwarded.\n\nOnce you have completed configuring syslog forwarding, click Save.\n\nFortiSOAR performs validations such as, whether the syslog server is reachable on the specified port etc. before adding the syslog server.\n\nOnce the syslog server is added, you can update or remove the configuration as per your requirements.\n\nPersisting the FortiSOAR logs\n\nIf your external log management server goes down, then the FortiSOAR logs generated during that time period will not be sent by FortiSOAR to your syslog server. If you want to persist the logs for the time frame when external log management server is down and send those logs when server comes back online, you need to do the following:\n\nIn the /etc/rsyslog.d/00-rsyslog-fortisoar-settings.conf file, add the following contents after the #### add the server details after this #### line:\n\n#### add the server details after this #### $ActionQueueType LinkedList $WorkDirectory /home/csadmin/.offline-rsyslogs/ # # for the workdir mentioned above, make sure you run # chown -R -t syslogd_var_lib_t /home/csadmin/.offline-rsyslogs/ # $ActionQueueMaxDiskSpace 1gb # 1gb space limit (You can change this value) $ActionQueueFileName fortisoar-offline-rsyslog $ActionResumeRetryCount -1 $ActionQueueSaveOnShutdown on\n\nNext, run the following commands:\n\nmkdir -p /home/csadmin/.offline-rsyslogs/\n\nchcon -R -t syslogd_var_lib_t /home/csadmin/.offline-rsyslogs/\n\nsystemctl restart rsyslog\n\nEnvironment Variables\n\nYou can use the Environment Variables tab on the System Configuration page to configure proxy settings for FortiSOAR and to define any other environment variables.\n\nThe procedure of how to configure proxy settings and define environment variables is included in the Configuring Proxy Settings and environment variables section in the Additional configuration settings for FortiSOAR chapter of the \"Deployment Guide\".\n\nBranding\n\nYou can customize branding of FortiSOAR as per your requirement. Branding is not bound based on licensing, i.e., all customers can customize FortiSOAR branding as per their requirements.\n\nTo customize your branding in FortiSOAR, you must have a role which has a minimum of Application Update permission and then can do any or all of the following branding changes:\n\nChanging Logos: You can update the FortiSOAR logo to reflect your logo in the FortiSOAR UI. However, note that the maximum file size for a logo is 1 MB. Also, the different logos have specific dimensions, and if the image files exceed the specified dimensions, then the FortiSOAR UI displays relevant error messages and prevents users from uploading images that exceed the file size and/or have the wrong dimensions.\n\nYou can update your logo in the Logo Settings section:\n\nBrand Logo (Small) - Dark Theme and Brand Logo (Large) - Dark Theme: Click the FortiSOAR logos and browse to the logos that you want to display in FortiSOAR Dark or Steel theme in two dimensions: Small (90px X 72px) and Large (210px X 24px).\n\nBrand Logo (Small) - Light Theme and Brand Logo (Large) - Light Theme: Click the FortiSOAR logos and browse to the logos that you want to display in FortiSOAR Light theme in two dimensions: Small (90px X 72px) and Large (210px X 24px).\n\nNote: You can hover on the information icon to view where these logos will appear in FortiSOAR.\n\nChanging the Favicon: To change the favicon that is displayed in FortiSOAR, click the FortiSOAR favicon and browse to the icon that you want to display as a favicon.

Administrators can click these links to easily access all the system fixtures to understand their workings and make changes in them if required. In the previous versions, administrators required to know the complete URL for these fixtures to access them and make required changes.\n\nThe following fixtures are included:\n\nPlaybooks:\n\nApproval/Manual Task Playbooks collection: Includes a collection of system-level playbooks that are used to automate approvals and manual tasks, such as triggering the resume playbook when the input is received for manual tasks.\n\nSchedule Management Playbooks collection: Includes a collection of system-level playbooks that are used for the scheduler module and used for various scheduler actions such as scheduling playbook execution history cleanup, audit log cleanup, etc.\n\nReport Management Playbooks collection: Includes a collection of system-level playbooks that are used to manage generation of FortiSOAR Reports, such as exporting reports, generating reports, generating reports based on a schedule, etc.\n\nPlaybooks that contain a reference to the approvalHost global variable fail with the 'approvalHost variable undefined' error, since the approvalHost global variable is removed from release 7.2.0 onwards. To resolve this error, replace the approvalHost global variable in the playbook with the Server_fqhn global variable.\n\nFor more information on system-level playbooks, see the Introduction to Playbooks chapter in the \"Playbooks Guide.\"\n\nEmail Templates\n\nPassword Reset Token: Includes an email template that is sent to FortiSOAR users' who forget their password and click on the Forgot Password link, so that they can reset their password. This email contains a link that the user can use to create their new password.\n\nSend Email To New User: Includes an email template that is sent to a new FortiSOAR users' and it contains a link that the new user can use to create their own new password.\n\nSend Email For Password Change: Includes an email template that is sent when a user requests for a change in their FortiSOAR password.\n\nSend Email For Reset Password By Admin: Includes an email template that is sent to FortiSOAR users' whose password has been reset by an administrator.\n\nTo modify the content of the email templates, click the email template whose content you want to change, for example, click Password Reset Token to open the email template. Click the Edit Record button to edit the contents of the template. You can also click the Edit Template icon to edit the structure of the email or click Actions to perform actions on the record.\n\nTo change the content of the email, click the Edit icon, or click the Edit Record to open the email template in a \"form\" format in which you can change the contents of the email as per your requirement, and then click Save to save your changes.\n\nIn case you have deleted the email templates, and you require to update or modify the default email templates, then you require to edit the mailtemplate.yml file located at /opt/cyops/configs/cyops-api/\n\nSelf Tenant and Agent\n\nThis section contains dedicated pages for the self tenant and self agent, making it easier to update details of the self tenant and agent such as remapping teams linked to the self tenant or tenants linked to the self agent.\n\nSelf Tenant: Click the Self Tenant link to access the self tenant in its own page in a new window, where you can edit the details of the self tenant record:\n\nSelf Agent: Click the Self Agent link to access the self tenant in its own page in a new window, where you can edit the details of the self agent record:\n\nAudit Log\n\nYou can view the historical record of activities across FortiSOAR using the Audit Log, the User-Specific Audit Logs, and the graphical representation of the Audit Log in the detail view of a record.\n\nAudit Log Permissions\n\nTo view your own audit logs, you must have a role with a minimum of Read permission on the Audit Log Activities module. To view audit logs of all users, you must have a role with a minimum of Read permission on the Security and Audit Log Activities modules.\n\nTo filter audit logs based on users you must have a role with a minimum of Read permission on the People, Appliances, and Audit Log Activities modules.\n\nTo delete your own audit logs, you must have a role with a minimum of Delete permission on the Audit Log Activities module. To delete audit logs of all users, you must have a role with a minimum of Delete permission on the Security and Audit Log Activities modules.\n\nNote: The Delete permission on the Audit Log Activities module will be removed for both csadmin and playbook appliances roles, and also this will not be enabled (checked) by default for the Full App Permissions role. Therefore, if you want any user or role to have the right to delete audit logs, you must explicitly assign the Delete permission on the Audit Log Activities module to that particular user or role.\n\nIf you cannot access the Audit Log, you must ask your administrator for access. FortiSOAR displays an error, as shown in the following image, if you do not have access to Audit Logs:\n\nYou can view historical record of activities across FortiSOAR using the following options:\n\nAudit Log: Audit Log displays a chronological list of all the actions across all the modules of FortiSOAR. Click Settings > Audit Log to open the Audit Log page.\n\nUser-Specific Audit Logs: User-Specific Audit Logs displays a chronological list of all the actions across all the modules of FortiSOAR for a particular user.\n\nViewing Audit Log in the detailed view of a record: You can view a graphical presentation, or grid view, of all the actions performed on that particular record. The audit log is displayed in a graphical format using the Timeline widget.\n\nAudit Logs include data such as, recording the name of the user who had deleted the record, linking and delinking events, picklist events, and model metadata events (including changes made in model metadata during the staging phrase). Free text search, additional filtering criteria, the ability to quickly add auditing for a new service and lazy loading has also been implemented in audit logs.\n\nAudit logs also contain operations related to playbooks such as trigger, update, terminate, resume, create and delete playbook versions, etc. From version 6.4.1 onwards, the operations such as Snapshot Created and Snapshot Deleted operations are renamed to Version Created and Version Deleted since snapshots have been renamed to versions. However, for older audit logs in cases of an upgrade, you will see the old audit log entries with the older names such as Snapshot Created or Snapshot Deleted.\n\nThe data included in the audit log also contains the following types of entries:\n\nUsers' login success or failures and logout events. The login event includes all three supported login types, which are DB Login, LDAP Login, and SSO Login.\n\nUsers' login with an invalid username.\n\nLocked users's attempts to log on to FortiSOAR.\n\nLocking of users' account in the event of multiple failed login attempts.\n\nInactive users's attempts to log on to FortiSOAR.\n\nForced log out events by an administrator using the UI\n\nForced log out events by an administrator using the CLI\n\nChange in user's access type, i.e., Named to Concurrent, or vice-versa, by an administrator\n\nTriggering of the workflow Execution history cleanup job\n\nSuccess or failure entry every time the storage space reclamation job is run along with the information about the date and time of the job run and table name on which the job is run.\n\nSuccess entry when the storage reclamation job is successfully completed: \"Workflow Execution history cleanup job Completed\".\n\nFailure entry on failure of the storage reclamation job: \"Workflow Execution history cleanup job Failed\". This occurs mainly due to insufficient space.\n\nCreating, updating, and deleting rules and channels.\n\nDeleting system notifications.\n\nPurging of system notifications.\n\nSoft deletion of records.\n\nRestoring of records from Recycle Bin.\n\nCreation of audit records each time a pre-processing rule matches a record. These records include the rule name, UUID, record information and date.\n\nAll operations involving the creation, update, or deletion of pre-processing rules are audited for tracking purposes. Failures in executing pre-processing rules are also audited.\n\nRecords that are dropped due to the 'Drop' pre-processing rule and records that are updated due to the 'Update' pre-processing rule are also audited.\n\nAll operations related to API key, such as regenerating an API key, creating an API key, updating an API key, etc.\n\nSuccess or failure entry every time the data archival service is run.\n\nSetting of the archival option for a module.\n\nChanging configuration of rules\n\nCreating, updating, or deleting playbook blocks\n\nCreating, activating, deactivating or deleting an MFA method\n\nAdding global configuration for an MFA method\n\nMandating 2FA for all users\n\nActivating grace period for each MFA user\n\nLocking user account after expiration of grace period\n\nYou can purge Audit Logs using the Purge Logs button on the top-right of the Audit Log page. You will see the Purge Logs button only if you have Delete permissions on the Audit Log Activities module.\n\nYou can also use the Audit Log Purge API to purge audit logs on an automated as well as an on-demand basis. For more information, see the API Methods chapter in the \"API Guide.\"\n\nViewing Audit Log\n\nUse the Audit Log to view a chronological list of all the actions across all the modules of FortiSOAR. To view the Audit Log page, you must have access to the Audit Log Activities module. Click Settings > Audit Log to open the Audit Log page. The Audit Log page filters audit logs, by default, to only show audit data from the previous 8 days. User can modify the date filter to suit their needs:\n\nThe audit log displays users' login success or failures and logout events. The login event includes all three supported login types, which are DB Login, LDAP Login, and SSO Login. You can filter the audit logs to display the audit logs for a particular record type, such as Alerts, Rules, API Key, Incidents, Tasks, etc., by selecting the record type from the Record Type drop-down list. You can also filter audit logs on users, operations, and data range, apart from modules.\n\nTo filter audit logs on for a particular user, select the user from the Select User drop-down list.\n\nTo filter audit logs on for a particular operation, select the operation from the Select Operation drop-down list. You can choose from the operations such as, Comment, Create, Delete, Link, Login Failed, Snapshot Created, Trigger, Unlink, Update, etc.\n\nYou can also filter audit logs for a particular date range by selecting the From Date and To Date using the calendar icon.\n\nYou can also search for audit logs using free text search. Click the Search icon and enter a search criterion in the Search Logs field to search the audit logs.\n\nThe Audit Log displays the following historical information for each record:\n\nTitle: Title of the record on which the action was performed.\n\nNote: In case of Approval playbooks the playbook audit log displays the Approval Description field, which represents the name of the approval record, in the Title field. In this case, the Title field will be displayed in the format Approval [Approval Description] Operation Performed. For example, Approval [Approval Test] Created.\n\nRecord Type: Type (module) of the record on which the action was performed such as Alerts, Incidents, Configs, Indicators, etc.\n\nOperation: Operation that was performed.\n\nUser: User who performed the operation such as the name of the user who performed the operation, or if the operation was performed by the system, playbooks, agents.\n\nNote: From version 7.0.2 onwards, operations performed by FortiSOAR such as the creation of schema for various modules (Alerts, Events, etc.) are added as a global audit log user filter named 'SYSTEM', and is applicable for audits generated from version 7.0.2 onwards. Audits done by the SYSTEM user prior to version 7.0.2 will not be visible when filtered by the SYSTEM user.\n\nSource: Source IP address where the operation that was performed.\n\nTransaction date: Date and time that the record was updated in the format DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM.\n\nTo view the details of an audit log entry, click the expand icon (>) in the audit entry row. Details in the audit log entry are present in the JSON format, and include the old data and updated (new) data for a record, in case of an update operation, and all attributes and their details, such as ID and type, for a record, in case of a create operation. You can copy the data using the Copy to Clipboard button.\n\nYou can perform the following operations on the Audit Log page, by clicking the More Options icon ( ) to the right of the table header:\n\nExport Visible Columns As CSV: Use this option to export visible columns of the audit log to a .csv file.\n\nNote: You can hide columns by deselecting a column from the list of columns present within the More Options menu. The hidden columns appear with a red cross.\n\nOnce you click this option, the Export Visible Columns As CSV dialog is displayed:\n\nIn this dialog, the All records in current page option is selected by default, which exports visible column data of the records on the current page. If you clear this option, then visible column data of all the records is exported.\n\nAdditionally, you can select the Neutralize CSV checkbox, if you want to make the formulas contained in the CSV file that you want to export ineffective. This helps protect the exported data from any malicious code that makes use of CSV injections (embedding untrusted input inside CSV files).\n\nClick Download File to download the CSV file containing the exported records.\n\nExport Visible Columns As PDF: Use this option to export visible columns of the audit log to a .pdf file.\n\nNote: If you want to export records from the record's grid and view panel that contain unsupported character sets such as Korean or Chinese, then you need to perform additional configurations. For more information, see the 'Configurations required for exporting of records with unsupported character sets in the PDF format' topic in the Debugging, Troubleshooting, and Optimizing FortiSOAR chapter.\n\nReset Columns To Default: Use this option to reset the audit log fields to the default fields specified for the audit log.\n\nYou can view logs specific to a particular module, by clicking Settings > Modules (in the Application Editor section) and from the Select a module to edit or create new module drop-down list, select the module whose audit log you want to view, and then click the Audit Logs button.\n\nYou view the same details and perform the same actions as mentioned earlier on the Audit Logs Dialog. You can filter the audit logs for modules on users, operations, and date range. For example, you can filter logs which have an Create operation performed on a particular record type (module), as shown in the following image:\n\nSimilarly, you can also view logs specific to a particular picklist, go to Settings > Picklists (in the Application Editor section). From the Select a picklist or edit or create a new picklist drop-down list select the picklist whose audit log you want to view and click the Audit Logs button. You view the same details and perform the same actions as mentioned earlier on the Audit Logs Dialog. You can filter the audit logs for picklists on users, operations, and date range.\n\nAudit logs also include the auditing of the following actions so that you can get comprehensive records of all activities across FortiSOAR :\n\nSchedule actions - Create, update and delete, start, and stop\n\nRules actions - Create, update, delete, activate, and deactivate\n\nDashboard/Report actions - Create, update, and delete\n\nNavigation actions - All\n\nLicense Update actions - All\n\nSVT Update actions - All\n\nRole - Modification (Create and Delete already gets audited)\n\nTeam - Modification (including team hierarchy updates), User Link/Unlink (Create and Delete already gets audited)\n\nFrom version 7.0.0 onwards, the following fields have been added to audit and system logs to provide more information about your FortiSOAR system and to help FortiAnalyzer (FAZ) integration:\n\nvd(enterprise|master|tenant) - The value of this field is \"enterprise\" for an enterprise setup, \"master\" for the master node in a multi-tenant setup, and \"tenant\" for the tenant node in a multi-tenant setup.\n\nlevel(emerg|alert|crit|err|warning|notice|info|debug) - The severity level of the event.\n\nNote that the following audit operations will be considered as 'warning' severity operations: Delete, Unlink, Terminate, Version Deleted, Uninstall, DeleteConfig, Deactivate and Replication Failed. All other audit operations are considered as 'info' severity.\n\ndevid - FortiSOAR's SNO, i.e., the same serial number from the license file.\n\ndatetime - Event timestamp in the 'epoch' format. This is applicable only for audit logs.\n\ntype(AuditLog|System Log) - The Log type.\n\nSample Audit log: 2021-02-19T06:17:24.958779+00:00 fsrprimary fortisoar-audit-log: CEF:0|Fortinet Inc|FortiSOAR|7.0.0|Alert Deleted|Alert Deleted|1|devid=\"FSRVMPTM20000061\" vd=\"enterprise\" level=\"warning\" type=\"Audit Log\" msg=\"Alert [1] Deleted \" src=\"192.168.56.1\" suid=\"3451141c-bac6-467c-8d72-85e0fab569ce\" suser=\"CS Admin\" end=1613634028029 playbookName=\"\" playbookId=\"\" eventTimeStr=\"18 Feb 2021 07:40:28.029\"\n\nViewing User-Specific Audit Logs\n\nUse the User-Specific Audit Logs to view the chronological list of all the actions across all the modules of FortiSOAR for a particular user. Users can view their own audit logs by clicking the User Profile icon and selecting the Edit Profile option and clicking the Audit Logs panel. Administrators who have a minimum of Read access on the Audit Log Activities module along with access to the People module, which allows them to access a user's profile, can view User Specific Audit Logs. The user-specific audit log also displays user's login success or failures and logout events. The login event includes all three supported login types, which are DB Login, LDAP Login, and SSO Login.\n\nUse the same filtering and searching techniques mentioned in the Viewing Audit Log section. You can filter the user-specific audit logs on record types (modules) and date range.\n\nThe user-specific audit logs display the same information as the audit log, and you can also perform the same actions here as you can perform in case of audit logs. For more information, see the Viewing Audit Log section.\n\nViewing Audit Log in the detailed view of a record\n\nUse the Audit Log tab, which is present in the detail view of a record, to view the graphical presentation of all the actions performed on that particular record. The Audit Log tab uses the Timeline widget to display the graphical representation of the details of the record. You cannot edit the Timeline widget. For more information about widgets, see the Using Template Widgets topic in the \"User Guide.\"\n\nYou can toggle the view in the Audit Log tab to view the details in both the grid view and the timeline (graphical) view. Use the same filtering and searching techniques mentioned in the Viewing Audit Log section. You can filter the user-specific audit logs on record types and date range.\n\nClick a record within a module to open the detail view of a record and then click the Audit Log tab to view the graphical representation, or grid view of the details of the record, as shown in the following image:\n\nA timeline item mentions the action performed on the record, such as Created, Updated, Commented, Attached, or Linked, the name of the person who has made the update, and the date and time that the update was made.\n\nWhen you update any detail in a record, then you can click the refresh button in the timeline to view the updates in timeline immediately.

For more information, see the Viewing Audit Log section.\n\nPurging Audit Logs\n\nYou can purge Audit Logs using the Purge Logs button on the top-right of the Audit Log page. Purging audit logs allows you to permanently delete old audit logs that you do not require and frees up space on your FortiSOAR instance. You can also schedule purging, on a global level, for both audit logs and executed playbook logs. For information on scheduling Audit Logs and Executed Playbook Logs, see Scheduling purging of audit logs and executed playbook logs.\n\nTo purge Audit Logs, you must be assigned a role that has a minimum of Read permission on the Security module and Delete permissions on the Audit Log Activies module.\n\nTo purge Audit Logs, click the Purge Logs button on the Audit Log page, which displays the Purge Audit Logs dialog:\n\nIn the Purge all logs before, field, select the time frame (using the calendar widget) before which you want to clear all the audit logs. For example, if you want to clear all audit logs before January 1st, 2023, 12:00 AM, then select this date and time using the calendar widget.\n\nBy default, logs of all events are purged and the Select All checkbox is selected. However, if you want to purge just a few event types such as \"Archival Start\", \"Retry\", \"Stop\", and \"Start\", clear the Select All checkbox, and then select only these event types, as shown in the following image:\n\nTo purge the logs, click the Purge Logs button, which displays a warning as shown in the following image:\n\nClick the I Have Read the warning - Purge Logs to continue the purging process.\n\nLicense Manager\n\nFortiSOAR enforces licensing using the License Manager. The License Manager restricts the usage of FortiSOAR by specifying the following:\n\nThe maximum number of active named users in FortiSOAR at any point in time.\n\nThe type and edition of the license.\n\nThe expiry date of the license.\n\nThe restrictions on usage of Threat Intelligent Management (TIM) features.\n\nFor details of the FortiSOAR licensing process, including deploying your FortiSOAR license for the first time, see the Licensing FortiSOAR chapter in the \"Deployment Guide.\"\n\nClick Settings > License Manager to open the License Manager page as shown in the following image:\n\nYou can use the License Manager page to view your license details and to update your license. FortiSOAR displays a message about the expiration of your license 15 days prior to the date your license is going to expire. If you license type is Evaluation or Perpetual, then you must update your license within 15 days, if you want to keep using FortiSOAR. To update your license, click Update License and either drag-and-drop your updated license or click and browse to the location where your license file is located, then select the file and click Open. If your license type is Subscription, you must renew your subscription.\n\nFor more information on licensing and for details about the various parameters on the License Manager page, see the Licensing FortiSOAR chapter in the \"Deployment Guide.\"\n\nNotifications\n\nFortiSOAR is built on the premise of humans being in the loop for effective orchestrated investigation; therefore, ensuring timely action-centric (or informational) notifications are generated becomes vital in achieving this goal. To achieve this goal, in release 7.2.0, FortiSOAR introduces a common framework for diverse notifications, such as email notifications, UI notifications from various services (like alerts/incidents/tasks assignments), Comments @mentions, workflow failures, etc. This common notification framework makes it possible for users to have complete control of the setup and consumption of notifications, i.e., how and when they want to consume notifications, and what notifications they want to consume.\n\nFrom release 7.2.0 onwards, there is a single 'Notifications' page using which you can enable, disable, or edit the notifications settings and add, edit or deactivate notification channels.\n\nTo view the Notifications page, click Settings > Notifications.\n\nOn the Notifications page, you will see the Delivery Rules, Notification Channels, and Failure Notification Logs tabs:\n\nThe Delivery Rules page contains default rules that are included by default in FortiSOAR and which have already been created for some common use cases, such as notifications to be generated when an approval request is created - 'Pending Approval Notification', or when comments that have @mentions are updated or added, or for playbook failures, etc. It also specifies the channel used for sending the notifications. Some examples of jinja expressions that can be used while creating or adding notifications are included in the Usage examples of Jinja Expressions in Notifications topic.\n\nNote: To edit an existing rule, you can click the row of the rule to open the edit <named of the rule> page, make the required changes, and then click Update.\n\nFor example, if you want playbook failure notifications to be sent using the email channel in addition to the default In App notifications, click the Notify On Playbook Failure rule to display the Edit Notify On Playbook Failure dialog, then in the Select Channel page, from the Notification Channels drop-down list, select Email Notification and click Add Channel:\n\nNote: Ensure that you have added appropriate notification details to the Email channel before you add the Email channel for playbook failures. For details on how to set up a notification channel, see the Setting up Notifications Channels topic.\n\nThe Notification Channels page lists the channels that can be used to send notifications. The default channels are In-App Notifications and Email Notifications.\n\nThe Failure Notification Logs page contains a list of notification failures with their respective error messages using which you can debug the notification failure. Once you have fixed the issues in the notification, you can select that particular log entry and click Retry Notification.\n\nTo purge failure notification logs, click the Purge Logs button on the Failure Notification Logs page, which displays the Purge Failed Notification Logs dialog. In this dialog, select the time frame (using the calendar widget) before which you want to clear all the failure notification logs.\n\nAdding Delivery Rules\n\nYou can add your own custom delivery rules based on which notifications will be created and delivered as follows:\n\nClick Settings > Notifications > Delivery Rules.\n\nOn the Delivery Rules page, click Add Delivery Rule, to open the 'Create New Delivery Rule' wizard.\n\nOn the Rule Details screen, you can define the rules for generating the notifications:\n\nTo create the rule in the 'Active' state, leave the Active toggle button as YES.\n\nIn the Name field, add a name that describes the purpose of the rule. For example, if you want to generate a notification if the reputation of an indicator is updated to malicious, then add the name as Indicator > Notify Indicator Reputation Updated to Malicious\n\nAdd the rule for generating notifications:\n\nWhen an Indicator is updated\n\nThen add the additional conditions for generating the notification. In our example, we want to generate a notification only if the reputation of the indicator is updated to 'Malicious' is added. Therefore, in the Condition section, choose the logical operator AND or OR and then add the condition as:\n\nReputation Equals Malicious\n\nYou can add additional conditions as per your requirement.\n\nNOTE: The 'Playbook Status' filter includes a list of all playbook statuses, allowing you to build notifications based on playbook statuses, such as sending notifications when playbooks are in the \"Finished with Error\" state.\n\nOnce you have completed adding the details for the rule, click Continue.\n\nOn the Select Channel screen using which users can consume the notifications.\n\nNote: You can choose only those channels that have been created. In-App Notifications and Email Notification are channels that are set up by default. For more information, see the Setting up Notifications Channels topic.\n\nFrom the Notification Channels drop-down list, select the channel using which you want to deliver the notifications. If you want to deliver notifications using the Notifications icon present on the top-right corner in FortiSOAR, select In-App Notifications and click Add Column. You can further configure the settings for this notification:\n\nTo enable or disable this notification, you can toggle the Enabled button.\n\nIn the Content field, add the content that you want to display as part of the notification. For example:\n\nA malicious indicator, {{vars.input.record.value}}, has been created!\n\nIn the Ownership section, you can choose to assign this notification to a specific user or to make it public. In this example, we have chosen to make it public.\n\nSimilarly, you can choose to deliver notifications from other notification channels, such as Email Notification.\n\nOnce you have completed setting up the notification channels, click Continue.\n\nOn the Review Rule Details screen, review the details of the rule for generating the specific notification:\n\nOnce you are satisfied, click the Create button.\n\nYou will observe that whenever a malicious indicator is added, a notification will be generated, that can be viewed by clicking the Notifications icon:\n\nUsage examples of Jinja Expressions in Notifications\n\nFollowing are some examples of jinja expressions that can be used while adding or customizing notifications:\n\nJinja expressions to get records details:\n\nTo get the name of a record:\n\n{{ vars.input.record.name }}\n\nTo get the severity of a record:\n\n{{ (vars.input.record.severity | fromIRI).itemValue }}\n\nTo get the URL to access a record:\n\n{% set idParts = vars.input.record['@id'].split('/') %}\n\n{{globalVars.Server_fqhn}}{{ '/modules/alerts/' + (idParts | last) }}\n\nJinja expressions to get the email address of the record owner based on the notification channels:\n\nTo fetch the record owner's email address while customizing the \"Email\" channel when you are adding or customizing a rule:\n\n{{vars.input.record.assignedTo}}\n\nTo fetch the record owner's email address while customizing \"any\" channel apart from the \"Email\" channel when you are adding or customizing a rule:\n\n{{(vars.input.record.assignedTo | fromIRI).email}}\n\nJinja expressions to customize \"Manual Inputs\":\n\nTo fetch the title of the manual input:\n\n{{vars.input.record.input.schema.title}}\n\nTo access the parent record of the record that contains the manual input trigger:\n\n{{ vars.input.record.record }}\n\nTo get the 'type' of record that contains the manual input trigger:\n\n{{(vars.input.record.record | fromIRI).type.itemValue }}\n\nTo print the IRI of the parent record of the record that contains the manual input trigger:\n\n{% if vars.input.record.record != '' %} Record Link - {{vars.input.record.record.split('/')[-2]}}{% endif %}\n\nTo fetch the email address of the owner in the case of an external or unauthenticated manual input:\n\n{{vars.input.record.owner_details.emailRecipients}}\n\nJinja expressions to get comment record details:\n\nTo get the 'first name' of the user who added the comment:\n\n{{(vars.input.record.createUser | fromIRI).firstname }}\n\nTo get the 'last name' of the user who added the comment:\n\n{{(vars.input.record.createUser | fromIRI).lastname }}\n\nSetting up Notification Channels\n\nNotification channels define the mechanism using which notifications are delivered to users. By default, the 'In-App Notifications' and 'Email Notification' (using the SMTP integration) channels are set up. Users cannot delete these default notification channels and they also cannot edit the In-App Notification channel.\n\nYou can set up other channels to deliver notifications using desktop applications, slack, microsoft teams, mobile applications, etc. You could also edit the existing 'Email Notification' channel to use Exchange or any other email server to send email notifications.\n\nTo set up a new channel for delivering notifications, for example, a Slack channel, do the following:\n\nEnsure that you have installed and configured the Slack connector and its 'Health Check' displays 'Available'. Also, ensure that you have set up a channel in Slack for receiving the notifications.\n\nFor information on connectors, see the Introduction to connectors chapter in the 'Connectors Guide.'\n\nClick Settings > Notifications> Notification Channels.\n\nOn the Notification Channels page, click Add, to open the 'Create New Notification Channel' wizard.\n\nIn the 'Create New Notification Channel' wizard, click Let's Build a Channel.\n\nOn the Channel Details screen, specify the details of the notification channel:\n\nTo create the notification channel in the 'Active' state, leave the Active toggle button as YES.\n\nIn the Name field, add the name of the channel, for example, Slack Notifications.\n\nIn the Channel Description field, add a brief description of the channel, for example, Channel for sending notifications using Slack.\n\nOnce you have completed adding the details for the channel, click Continue.\n\nOn the Integrations screen, configure the connector using which you want to send notifications to the users:\n\nFrom the Choose Suitable Connector drop-down list, select Slack.\n\nIn the Choose Configuration and Action section, configure the following:\n\nToggle Configuration Target to Agent if you want to configure the connector for a remote FSR Agent, or retain the configuration for the current FortiSOAR node, i.e., Self (default). For more information on agents and how to run remote actions using FSR Agents, see the Segmented Network support in FortiSOAR chapter.\n\nFrom the Choose Connector Configuration drop-down list, select the connector configuration that you want to use to send notifications and ensure that the 'Health Check' displays Available. For our example, select Default.\n\nFrom the Choose Action drop-down list, select the action that you want to perform using the Slack connector. For our example, select Send Message. The Send Message action will send the notifications to the specific channel that you have set up on your Slack Cloud.\n\nIn the Default Value for Action Inputs section, enter the ID of the channel (or user) that you have created for receiving notifications from FortiSOAR, and the default message that you want to include for notifications.\n\nOnce you have completed setting up the integration, click Continue.\n\nOn the Test Run screen, you can test your integration by providing sample inputs and clicking Trigger Test Notification.\n\nClicking Trigger Test Notification sends a live notification to the Slack channel that you have configured for receiving notifications.\n\nTo move to the next screen, click Continue.\n\nOn the Review Channel Details screen, review the details of the notification channel:\n\nOnce you are satisfied, click the Save button.\n\nWorking with Delivery Rules and Notification Channels\n\nThe default notification channel for emails is SMTP; however, you can choose to change this to Exchange or any other email service provider. If you set, for example, Exchange as the default notification channel, then all notifications such as workflow failures, creation and updates of alerts, incidents, etc, actions pending for some user actions, etc., will all be delivered using Exchange. In such a case, you must do the following:\n\nConfigure the Exchange connector and its 'Health Check' displays 'Available'.\n\nNavigate to Notifications > Notifications Channel and click the Email Notification row. In the Update Email Notification Channel wizard, edit the email notification channel to use the Exchange connector instead of the SMTP connector. The Update Email Notification Channel wizard is exactly like the Create New Notification Channel wizard, steps for which are described in the Setting Up Notifications Channels topic.\n\nIf however, you want to use SMTP as the default notification channel and use Exchange only for specific use cases, for example, to use Exchange in cases where you want to request decisions or other inputs from either FortiSOAR or non-FortiSOAR users; then, or you want Approvals notifications sent using Exchange, then you have to update the respective delivery rules, i.e., Notify On Pending External Manual Input, Notify On Pending Internal Manual Input, or Notify On Pending Approval Notification. For our example, we will use exchange for sending pending external manual input notifications:\n\nEnsure that you have configured the Exchange connector and set up a new notification channel using the Exchange connector. For steps on setting up a notification channel, see Setting Up Notifications Channels.\n\nUpdate the delivery rule to use Exchange instead of SMTP for delivering pending external manual input notifications:\n\nNavigate to Notifications > Delivery Rules and click the Pending External Manual Input Notification row.\n\nIn the Edit Pending External Manual Input Notification wizard, leave the Rules Details screen unchanged and click Continue. On the Select Channel screen, remove Email Notification, which is the default SMTP notification channel, and add the notification channel that you have set up for Exchange. Next, you must specify the details that you want to send through the notifications:\n\nOn this screen, you can also customize the email content, including adding custom Jinja input in the email body that gets sent to the configured email addresses. You can also specify a list of record IRIs or file IDs for attachments that you want to add to the email in the Attachment IRI List field.\n\nOnce you have specified all the details, click Continue.\n\nOn the Review Rule Details screen, review the details of the rule you have set up, and if satisfied click Update.\n\nThis updates the Pending External Manual Input Notification rule to send pending external manual input notifications using Exchange.\n\nDisabling a Delivery Rule\n\nIf you have upgraded your FortiSOAR system to release 7.3.x from a release prior to 7.3.0, you can disable the Notify On Pending Manual Input rule, if you want to disable the manual input notification from the 'Notifications Panel'; else you will receive the manual input notification in both the 'Notifications Panel' and the 'Pending Tasks'. In the case of a fresh installation of FortiSOAR 7.3.x, notifications for manual input are visible on only the Manual Input tab in the 'Pending Tasks' panel.\n\nIn the case of a fresh installation of FortiSOAR 7.4.0 (or later), by default, the Notify On Pending Manual Input rule is removed, and if you upgrade to FortiSOAR 7.4.0, then by default, the Notify On Pending Manual Input rule is in the 'Inactive' state.\n\nTo disable the Notify On Pending Manual Input rule do the following:\n\nClick Settings > Notifications > Delivery Rules.\n\nOn the Delivery Rules page, click the Notify On Pending Manual Input rule.\n\nOn the Rules Details screen, toggle Active to No.\n\nClick Continue on the Select Channel screen, and then click Update on the Rules Details screen.\n\nYou can disable any rule on your FortiSOAR system using these steps.\n\nModifying the 'Notify On Pending External Manual Input' delivery rule post-upgrade to release 7.3.0 or later\n\nFrom FortiSOAR 7.3.0 onwards, you can choose to run unauthenticated manual inputs in segmented networks using FSR agents. To achieve this, the 'Notify On Pending External Manual Input' delivery rule has been updated in the case of fresh installations of FortiSOAR 7.3.0. However, if you have upgraded your FortiSOAR instance to release 7.3.0 or later from a release prior to 7.3.0, you must modify the 'Notify On Pending External Manual Input' rule to allow the running of manual inputs on FSR agents as follows:\n\nOpen the Notifications page by clicking Settings > Notifications.\n\nOn the Delivery Rules tab, click the Notify On Pending External Manual Input delivery rule row to edit this rule.\n\nOn the Edit Notify On Pending External Manual Input dialog, click Continue on the Rule Details screen.\n\nOn the Select Channel screen, expand the 'Email' channel or any other channel used to send the notifications.\n\nIn the Body section, do the following:\n\nSelect the Open Input Form text, and then click the Insert/Edit Link button to edit the manual input link.\n\nIn the Insert/Edit Link dialog in the URL field, enter the following URL:\n\nhttps://{{vars.input.record.server_fqhn | ternary(vars.input.record.server_fqhn, globalVars.Server_fqhn)}}/{{vars.input.record.agent_id | ternary('', 'input')}}?inputId={{vars.input.record.id}}&token={{vars.input.record.token}}\n\nand then click Save.\n\nReplace the existing URL text that is present in the Body section after the 'Alternatively, copy/paste this in your browser:' sentence with the following URL:\n\nhttps://{{vars.input.record.server_fqhn | ternary(vars.input.record.server_fqhn, globalVars.Server_fqhn)}}/{{vars.input.record.agent_id | ternary('', 'input')}}?inputId={{vars.input.record.id}}&token={{vars.input.record.token}}\n\nand then click Save.\n\nOn the Select Channel screen, click Continue.\n\nOn the Rule Details screen, review the rule and then click Update to update the rule to send external manual input notification on both your FortiSOAR instance as well as your FSR agent.\n\nPurging of notifications\n\nBy default FortiSOAR, runs a system schedule, every day at midnight (00:00 hrs) to purge all system notifications, both read and unread, that are older than 14 days. The cron expression for this system schedule is present in the /opt/cyops-workflow/sealab/sealab/config.ini file as follows:\n\nPURGE_NOTIFICATION_SCHEDULE: {'minute': '0', 'hour': '0', 'day_of_week': '*', 'day_of_month': '*', 'month_of_year': '*'}\n\nNOTE: The days of the week are represented by integers from 0 to 6, with 0 representing Sunday and 6 representing Saturday. Therefore the day_of_week property accepts * or [0-6] characters.\n\nYou can update this cron expression if you want to change the default schedule timing window of 12 am, and then run the following command:\n\n$ sudo -u nginx /opt/cyops-workflow/.env/bin/python /opt/cyops-workflow/sealab/manage.py default_schedules\n\nThen restart the services using the following command:\n\nsystemctl restart celeryd celerybeatd fsr-workflow\n\nSimilarly, the KEEP_SYSTEM_NOTIFICATION_DAYS parameter in the config.ini sets the default number of days that read system notifications are retained in the system, which by default is set to 7 days as follows:\n\nKEEP_SYSTEM_NOTIFICATION_DAYS = 7\n\nYou can change this setting as per your requirements. After you have completed making changes to this setting, you must restart the default schedules using the following command:\n\n$ sudo -u nginx /opt/cyops-workflow/.env/bin/python /opt/cyops-workflow/sealab/manage.py default_schedules\n\nNext, you must restart the services using the following command:\n\nsystemctl restart celeryd celerybeatd fsr-workflow\n\nUsers with a minimum of Update permissions on the Security Module also use the FortiSOAR UI to purge notifications. To purge notifications, click the Notifications icon on the top-right corner of the FortiSOAR UI to display the Notifications Panel. Then click the Purge All icon to display the Purge Notifications dialog. Click Purge All Notifications to delete all notifications or click Purge All Read Notifications to delete all read notifications:\n\nData Archival\n\nThe volume of data ingested in SOAR platforms grows exponentially as SOCs across the globe automate most of their procedures using SOAR solutions. Over years of usage, as the volume of data grows, which can adversely affect the performance of a SOAR platform as follows:\n\nDatabase queries become slower and more and more resource-intensive.\n\nUI becomes very sluggish as more time is needed to fetch the required data.\n\nMore disk space for storage on the primary system.\n\nHistorical data is not required for day-to-day investigation. However, it cannot be discarded completely as organizations need it for audit and compliance reviews, and also for occasional references.\n\nTo solve the mentioned issues and to retain historical data for the long term by preserving it in your data lake, FortiSOAR provides a way to archive data. The data archival solution in FortiSOAR provides the following advantages:\n\nImproves the overall performance of your FortiSOAR instance by helping to lessen the primary data volume.\n\nAbility to move historical data that is not accessed frequently to less expensive storage.\n\nAbility to configure timeframes for data to be kept at primary and for data to be archived.\n\nAbility to search the archive for certain specific records or record attributes.\n\nAbility to archive certain specific types of records. For example, critical and closed alerts and incidents.\n\nThe following modules cannot be archived:\n\nAgents\n\nAppliances\n\nApprovals\n\nPeople\n\nRouters\n\nSaved Reports\n\nTenants\n\nMethods of Setting Up Data Archival\n\nExternal Database (Recommended): Use an external database for data archival purposes.\n\nInternal Database: Use an internal database for data archival purposes; this can be used for testing purposes.\n\nSyslog Forwarding: You can also archive data to an external Syslog server. You can choose to enable Syslog forwarding in addition to archiving data on databases or can set it up as a sole data archival destination.\n\nImportant: Data that you archive using only Syslog Forwarding cannot be searched using FortiSOAR.\n\nYou can use a combination of methods for archiving your data. For example, you can choose to archive data in an external Syslog server, in addition to storing that in an internal or external database. If you choose to archive data in both the external Syslog server and a database, then any record that is archived will be forwarded to the Syslog server and will also be stored as a row in the database. You can use such a combination if you want an archival strategy in which you want to forward records to an external Syslog server to keep data there for a longer timeframe say 20 years, but also keep a record in the database for a shorter timeframe say 2 years so that the recent historical records are searchable and for very old records you can go back to the Syslog server.\n\nSetting up an External Database for Data Archival\n\nTo set up an external database for data archival, do the following:\n\nCreate the db_external_config.yml file at the following location /opt/cyops/configs/database/\n\nUse the following command to create the db_external_config.yml file:\n\n# cp /opt/cyops/configs/database/db_config.yml /opt/cyops/configs/database/db_external_config.yml\n\nNote: If you have already externalized your FortiSOAR databases, then a db_external_config.yml file will already be present.\n\nEdit the db_external_config.yml file to add the details for the data_archival external database as follows:\n\nIn the postgres_archival section:\n\nSet the pg_archival_external parameter to \"true\".\n\nThis parameter determines whether or not the Postgres archival database needs to be externalized. If it is set to \"true\", then the Postgres archival database is externalized, and if set to \"false\" (default), then the Postgres archival database is not externalized.\n\nUpdate the value of the data archival host (pg_archival_host) and data archival port (pg_archival_port) (if needed) parameters.\n\nAdd the encrypted password that you have set on your remote Data Archival server in the pg_archival_password parameter.\n\nYou can encrypt your passwords by running the csadm db --encrypt command as a root user. For more information on csadm, see the FortiSOAR Admin CLI chapter.\n\nOn the externalized data archival database run the following commands:\n\nTo ensure that the data archival server allows connections, open the firewall port:\n\n# firewall-cmd --add-service=postgresql --permanent\n\n# firewall-cmd --reload\n\nTo ensure that the pg_hba.conf file trusts the FortiSOAR server for incoming connections:\n\nAdd the following entry to the file /var/lib/pgsql/16/data/pg_hba.conf file:\n\nhost all all ip/subnetmask trust\n\nFor example, if the ip/subnetmask of your externalized PostgreSQL database is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx then add the following to the pg_hba.conf file:\n\nhost all all xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx trust\n\nTo ensure that the postgresql.conf file trusts the FortiSOAR server for incoming connections:\n\nMake the following changes to the /var/lib/pgsql/16/data/postgresql.conf file:\n\nlisten_addresses = '*'\n\nport = 5432\n\nRestart PostgreSQL using the following command:\n\n# systemctl restart postgresql-16\n\nCreate a cyberpgsql user using the following commands:\n\n# psql -U postgres -c \"CREATE USER cyberpgsql WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD '<password>'\";\n\nSSH to your FortiSOAR VM and log in as a root user.\n\nCheck the connectivity between the FortiSOAR local instance and remote data archival database using the csadm db --check-connection command.\n\nTo externalize the data archival database, type the following command:\n\n# csadm db --archival-externalize\n\nOr run the following command to externalize all the FortiSOAR databases, including the data archival database:\n\n# csadm db --externalize\n\nOnce you run the above command, you will be asked to provide the path in which you want to save your database backup file.\n\nNote: If you run the # csadm db --externalize option more than once (i.e., you are running the option again after the first time), then csadm will display a message such as:\n\nThe databases already exist in postgresql, do you want to delete these databases (y/n): If you want to externalize your PostgreSQL database again you must type y.\n\nAfter you have completed externalizing your PostgreSQL database, you should restart your schedules.\n\nConfiguring various settings for Data Archival\n\nImportant: To configure various settings for data archival, such as archival frequency, rules for archival, etc., you must have Update permission on the Application module and Create, Read, Update, and Delete permissions on the Data Archival module.\n\nLog onto FortiSOAR and in System click the Data Archival option.\n\nOn the Data Archival page, in the Setting tab, in the Archival Destination section, you can view the details of the database that you have set up for data archival. Details include the host, port, and name of the database and the username that you have set up for the database. In the case of an internal database, details will appear as shown in the following image:\n\nIf you have set up an external database for data archival, its details are shown in the Database section. For information on how to set up an external database for data archival, see the Setting up an External Database for Data Archival topic.\n\nIf you want to archive data to an external Syslog server, either in addition to the external or internal database or as a sole archival destination, then to update the Syslog configurations, you must have Security Update permissions and you must ensure that the destination Syslog server IP is reachable from the FortiSOAR instance and should accept TCP/UDP data in port that is set up for communication.\n\nTo configure Syslog, click Setup in Syslog Forwarding and enter the following details in the Archival Syslog Setting dialog:\n\nIn the Server field, enter the IP or hostname of the Syslog server that you want to set up for data archival.\n\nFrom the Protocol drop-down list, choose UDP or TCP as the protocol to be used to communicate with the Syslog server.\n\nIn the Port field, enter the port number to be used to communicate with the Syslog server.\n\nClick Save to save the Syslog details.\n\nIn the Archival Frequency section, set up the archival schedule, which is a system schedule that runs periodically as per the timeframe you have configured and archives data:\n\nClick View beside Schedule Status, which is set to Inactive, to open the Schedule Details dialog.\n\nClick Start Schedule to begin the schedule immediately, or you can also set the Start Time and End Time for the schedule.\n\nIn the Schedule Frequency section, choose the frequency of running this schedule.\n\nFor example, to run the data archival daily at 6:00 am, click Daily and then in the hour field enter 6 and in the minute field enter 0.\n\nFrom the Timezone drop-down list, select the timezone in which you want the schedule to run. By default, this is set as UTC.\n\nIf you want to ensure that you do not rerun the workflow, if previous scheduled instance is yet running, then click Limit execution to one active instance at a time.\n\n(Optional) From the Start Time field, select the date and time from when the schedule should start running.\n\n(Optional) From the End Time field, select the date and time till when the schedule should run, i.e., the date and time to stop the schedule.\n\nFor more details on schedules, see the Schedules chapter in the \"User Guide.\"\n\nClick Save to save the schedule.\n\nOnce the schedule is saved, you can see that the Schedule Status has changed to Active:\n\nIn the Archival Rules section, you can choose the modules that you want to archive as well as set up rules for archival:\n\nFrom the Choose Module To Archive drop-down list, select the module whose records you want to archive and click Add Module.\n\nFor example, select Alerts and click Add Module.\n\nIn the Archive all data modified earlier than field, enter the number of months earlier than which you want to archive the records. For example, if you enter 12 in this field, then it means that all records, which were modified earlier than 12 months will be archived.\n\nNote: The value that you mention in this field must be in multiples of 3.\n\nFrom the Retain archived data for drop-down list, choose the number of years the archived data should be retained in the specified archival destination.\n\nIn the Additional Criteria section, add conditions that refine the selection of data to be archived.\n\nFor example, if you want to archive closed alerts only, then click Add Condition and from the Select a field drop-down list, select Status, from the Operator drop-down list, select Equals, and then select Closed.\n\nClick Save and Start Archival to save the settings and start data archival for the specified module. Settings are saved in the Draft mode if you do not click Save and Start Archival.\n\nIn the Archived Modules section, you can Pause and Resume a particular archival or Pause and Resume all ongoing archivals.\n\nYou can also edit the settings for any archival, by clicking Edit Settings.\n\nViewing and Searching Archived Records\n\nTo view archived records, you must have permissions on the module to view the archi"
