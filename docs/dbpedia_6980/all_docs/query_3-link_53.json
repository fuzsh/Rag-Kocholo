If you’re a trader, you’ll need to provide your trader information before you can submit your app for review.\n\nFebruary 17, 2025: Apps without trader status will be removed from the App Store in the EU until trader status is provided and verified.\n\nLearn what a trader is and how to enter your status\n\nUpdates to the StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement\n\nIn response to the announcement by the European Commission in June, we’re making the following changes to Apple’s Digital Markets Act compliance plan. We’re introducing updated terms that will apply this fall for developers with apps in the European Union storefronts of the App Store that use the StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement. Key changes include:\n\nDevelopers can communicate and promote offers for purchases available at a destination of their choice. The destination can be an alternative app marketplace, another app, or a website, and it can be accessed outside the app or via a web view that appears in the app.\n\nDevelopers may design and execute within their apps the communication and promotion of offers. This includes providing information about prices of subscriptions or any other offer available both within or outside the app, and providing explanations or instructions about how to subscribe to offers outside the application. These communications must provide accurate information regarding the digital goods or services available for purchase.\n\nDevelopers may choose to use an actionable link that can be tapped, clicked, or scanned, to take users to their destination.\n\nDevelopers can use any number of URLs, without declaring them in the app’s Info.plist.\n\nLinks with parameters, redirects, and intermediate links to landing pages are permitted.\n\nUpdated business terms for apps with the External Purchase Link Entitlement are being introduced to align with the changes to these capabilities.\n\nLearn more by visiting Alternative payment options on the App Store in the European Union or request a 30-minute online consultation to ask questions and provide feedback about these changes.\n\nUpdated guidelines now available\n\nThe App Review Guidelines have been revised to support updated policies and upcoming features, and to provide clarification.\n\nUpdated 4.7 to clarify that PC emulator apps can offer to download games.\n\nAdded 4.7, 4.7.2, and 4.7.3 to Notarization.\n\nView the App Review Guidelines\n\nGet resources and support to prepare for App Review\n\nTranslations of the guidelines will be available on the Apple Developer website within one month.\n\nThe App Store on Apple Vision Pro expands to new markets\n\nApple Vision Pro will launch in China mainland, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore on June 28 and in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom on July 12.

We believe anyone with a good idea and the ingenuity to bring it to life should have the opportunity to offer their app to the world. Only developers who reach significant scale (more than one million first annual installs per year in the EU) pay the CTF. Nonprofit organizations, government entities, and educational institutions approved for a fee waiver don’t pay the CTF. Today, we’re introducing two additional conditions in which the CTF is not required:\n\nFirst, no CTF is required if a developer has no revenue whatsoever. This includes creating a free app without monetization that is not related to revenue of any kind (physical, digital, advertising, or otherwise). This condition is intended to give students, hobbyists, and other non-commercial developers an opportunity to create a popular app without paying the CTF.\n\nSecond, small developers (less than €10 million in global annual business revenue*) that adopt the alternative business terms receive a 3-year free on-ramp to the CTF to help them create innovative apps and rapidly grow their business. Within this 3-year period, if a small developer that hasn’t previously exceeded one million first annual installs crosses the threshold for the first time, they won’t pay the CTF, even if they continue to exceed one million first annual installs during that time. If a small developer grows to earn global revenue between €10 million and €50 million within the 3-year on-ramp period, they’ll start to pay the CTF after one million first annual installs up to a cap of €1 million per year.\n\niPadOS\n\nThis week, the European Commission designated iPadOS a gatekeeper platform under the Digital Markets Act. Apple will bring our recent iOS changes for apps in the European Union (EU) to iPadOS later this fall, as required. Developers can choose to adopt the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU that will include these additional capabilities and options on iPadOS, or stay on Apple’s existing terms.\n\nOnce these changes are publicly available to users in the EU, the CTF will also apply to iPadOS apps downloaded through the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative marketplaces. Users who install the same app on both iOS and iPadOS within a 12-month period will only generate one first annual install for that app. To help developers estimate any potential impact on their app businesses under the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU, we’ve updated the App Install reports in App Store Connect that can be used with our fee calculator.\n\nFor more details, visit Understanding the Core Technology Fee for iOS apps in the European Union. If you’ve already entered into the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU, be sure to sign the updated terms.\n\nGlobal business revenue takes into account revenue across all commercial activity, including from associated corporate entities. For additional details, read the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU.\n\nReminder: Privacy requirement for app submissions starts May 1\n\nThe App Store was created to be a safe place for users to discover and get millions of apps all around the world. Over the years, we‘ve built many critical privacy and security features that help protect users and give them transparency and control — from Privacy Nutrition Labels to app tracking transparency, and so many more.\n\nAn essential requirement of maintaining user trust is that developers are responsible for all of the code in their apps, including code frameworks and libraries from other sources. That‘s why we’ve created privacy manifests and signature requirements for the most popular third-party SDKs, as well as required reasons for covered APIs.\n\nStarting May 1, 2024, new or updated apps that have a newly added third-party SDK that‘s on the list of commonly used third-party SDKs will need all of the following to be submitted in App Store Connect:\n\nRequired reasons for each listed API\n\nPrivacy manifests\n\nValid signatures when the SDK is added as a binary dependency\n\nApps won’t be accepted if they fail to meet the manifest and signature requirements. Apps also won’t be accepted if all of the following apply:\n\nThey’re missing a reason for a listed API\n\nThe code is part of a dynamic framework embedded via the Embed Frameworks build phase\n\nThe framework is a newly added third-party SDK that’s on the list of commonly used third-party SDKs\n\nIn the future, these required reason requirements will expand to include the entire app binary. If you’re not using an API for an approved reason, please find an alternative. These changes are designed to help you better understand how third-party SDKs use data, secure software dependencies, and provide additional privacy protection for users.\n\nThis is a step forward for all apps and we encourage all SDKs to adopt this functionality to better support the apps that depend on them.\n\nCheck out our newest developer activities\n\nJoin us around the world to learn about growing your business, elevating your app design, and preparing for the App Review process.

Marketplaces can choose to offer a catalog of apps solely from the developer of the marketplace.\n\nLinking out to purchase. When directing users to complete a transaction for digital goods or services on an external webpage, developers can choose how to design promotions, discounts, and other deals. The Apple-provided design templates, which are optimized for key purchase and promotional use cases, are now optional.\n\nDistributing directly from your website\n\nWeb Distribution, available with a software update later this spring, will let authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website owned by the developer. Apple will provide authorized developers access to APIs that facilitate the distribution of their apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up and restore users’ apps, and more. For details, visit Getting ready for Web Distribution in the EU.\n\nNew App Store and iOS data analytics now available\n\nWe’re expanding the analytics available for your apps to help you get even more insight into your business and apps’ performance.\n\nOver 50 new reports are now available through the App Store Connect API to help you analyze your apps’ App Store and iOS performance. These reports include hundreds of new metrics that can enable you to evaluate your performance and find opportunities for improvement. Reports are organized into the following categories:\n\nApp Store Engagement — the number of users on the App Store interacting with a developer’s app or sharing it with others\n\nApp Store Commerce — downloads, sales, pre-orders, and transactions made with the secure App Store In-App Purchase system\n\nApp Usage — active devices, installs, app deletions, and more\n\nFrameworks Usage — an app’s interaction with OS capabilities, such as PhotoPicker and Widgets\n\nPerformance — how your apps perform and how users interact with specific features\n\nAdditionally, new reports are also available through the CloudKit console with data about Apple Push Notifications and File Provider.\n\nApple Push Notifications — notification states as they pass through the Apple Push Notification service (APNs)\n\nFile Provider — usage, consistency, and error data\n\nUpdates to app distribution in the European Union\n\nOver the past several weeks, we’ve communicated with thousands of developers to discuss DMA-related changes to iOS, Safari, and the App Store impacting apps in the European Union. As a result of the valuable feedback received, we’ve revised the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU to update the following policies and provide developers more flexibility:\n\nDecisioning by membership: To make it easier for more developers to sign up for the new terms, we’ve removed the corporate entity requirement that the Addendum must be signed by each membership that controls, is controlled by, or is under control with another membership. This means an entity can now choose to sign up for the new terms at the developer account level.\n\nSwitching back: To help reduce the risk of unexpected business changes under the new terms, such as reaching massive scale more quickly than anticipated, or if you simply change your mind, we’ve created a one-time option to terminate the Addendum under certain circumstances and switch back to Apple’s standard business terms for your EU apps. For details, view the Addendum.\n\nAlternative app marketplace requirements: To make it easier for developers who want to create alternative app marketplaces, we’ve added a new eligibility criteria that lets developers qualify without a stand-by letter of credit. For details, view the marketplace support page.\n\nIf you’ve already entered into the Addendum, you can sign the updated version here.\n\nUpdated App Review Guidelines now available\n\nThe App Store Review Guidelines have been revised to support updated policies, upcoming features, and to provide clarification.\n\nThe title of the document has been changed to App Review Guidelines.\n\nThe Introduction section explains that in the European Union, developers can also distribute notarized iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces. This section provides links to further information about alternative app marketplaces and Notarization for iOS apps.\n\nThe following guidelines have been updated:\n\n2.3.1: Added that a violation of this rule is grounds for an app being blocked from installing via alternative distribution.\n\n2.3.10: Added that developers cannot include names, icons, or imagery of other mobile platforms or alternative app marketplaces in their apps or metadata, unless there is specific, approved interactive functionality.\n\n3.1.3(b): Added a link to 3.1.1 to make clear that 3.1.1(a) applies, and multiplatform services apps can use the 3.1.1(a) entitlement.\n\n4.8 Login Services: Updated to make clear that the login service cannot collect interactions with your app for advertising purposes without consent. It also adds that another login service is not required if your app is an alternative app marketplace, or an app distributed from an alternative app marketplace, that uses a marketplace-specific login for account, download, and commerce features.\n\n5.1.1(viii): Added that apps that compile personal information from any source that is not directly from the user or without the user’s explicit consent, even public databases, are not permitted on alternative app marketplaces.\n\n5.4 and 5.5: Updated to state that apps that do not comply with these guidelines will be blocked from installing via alternative distribution.\n\nBug Fix Submissions: Added that bug fixes will not be delayed for apps that are already on alternative app marketplaces, except for those related to legal or safety issues.\n\nView the App Review Guidelines\n\nTranslations of the guidelines will be available on the Apple Developer website within one month.\n\nApp submissions now open for the latest OS releases\n\nSubmit in App Store Connect\n\niOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, tvOS 17.4, visionOS 1.1, and watchOS 10.4 will soon be available to customers worldwide.

When tax regulations or foreign exchange rates change, we sometimes need to update prices on the App Store in certain regions and/or adjust your proceeds. These updates are done using publicly available exchange rate information from financial data providers to help ensure prices for apps and in‑app purchases stay equalized across all storefronts.\n\nOn July 25, pricing for apps and in‑app purchases (excluding auto‑renewable subscriptions) will be updated for the Egypt, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Türkiye storefronts. These updates also consider the following tax changes:\n\nEgypt: introduction of a value‑added tax (VAT) of 14%\n\nTanzania: introduction of a VAT of 18% and a digital service tax of 2%\n\nTürkiye: increase of the VAT rate from 18% to 20%\n\nHow this impacts pricing\n\nIf you’ve selected Egypt, Nigeria, Tanzania, or Türkiye as the base storefront for your app or in‑app purchase (excluding auto‑renewable subscriptions), the price won’t change on that storefront. Prices on other storefronts will be updated to maintain equalization with your chosen base price.\n\nIf the base storefront for your app or in‑app purchase (excluding auto‑renewable subscriptions) isn’t Egypt, Nigeria, Tanzania, or Türkiye, prices will increase on the Egypt, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Türkiye storefronts.\n\nIf your in‑app purchase is an auto‑renewable subscription or if you manually manage prices on storefronts instead of using the automated equalized prices, your prices won’t change.\n\nThe Pricing and Availability section of My Apps has been updated in App Store Connect to display these upcoming price changes. As always, you can change the prices of your apps, in‑app purchases, and auto‑renewable subscriptions at any time.\n\nHow this impacts proceeds and tax administration\n\nYour proceeds for sales of apps and in-app purchases (including auto‑renewable subscriptions) will change to reflect the new tax rates and updated prices. Exhibit B of the Paid Applications Agreement has been updated to indicate that Apple collects and remits applicable taxes in Egypt and Tanzania.\n\nLearn more about managing your prices\n\nViewing new pricing\n\nSelecting a base country or region\n\nPricing and availability start times by region\n\nSetting in‑app purchase pricing\n\nNew design resources now available\n\nNow it’s even easier to design your apps quickly and accurately with new and updated design resources for creating apps on Apple platforms.\n\nvisionOS design library and templates for Figma and Sketch.\n\niOS 17 and iPadOS 17 design kits for Figma and Sketch.\n\nmacOS Sonoma design kits for Figma and Sketch.\n\nwatchOS 10 design kit for Sketch.\n\nSF Symbols 5 beta, with over 700 new symbols.\n\nUpdated Human Interface Guidelines, now in Chinese and Japanese.\n\nSF script extensions, now with Armenian, Georgian, and Hebrew.\n\nWWDC23 resources and survey\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us for an amazing week.

With an incredible new opportunity in spatial computing in visionOS, new features in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, and major enhancements across languages, frameworks, tools and services, you can create even more unique experiences for users worldwide.\n\nLearn what’s new\n\nWhat’s new in privacy on the App Store\n\nAt Apple, we believe privacy is a fundamental human right. That is why we’ve built a number of features to help users understand developers’ privacy and data collection and sharing practices, and put users in the driver’s seat when it comes to their data. App Tracking Transparency (ATT) empowers users to choose whether an app has permission to track their activity across other companies’ apps and websites for the purposes of advertising or sharing with data brokers. With Privacy Nutrition Labels and App Privacy Report, users can see what data an app collects and how it’s used.\n\nMany apps leverage third-party software development kits (SDKs), which can offer great functionality but may have implications on how the apps handle user data. To make it even easier for developers to create great apps while informing users and respecting their choices about how their data is used, we’re introducing two new features.\n\nFirst, to help developers understand how third-party SDKs use data, we’re introducing new privacy manifests — files that outline the privacy practices of the third-party code in an app, in a single standard format. When developers prepare to distribute their app, Xcode will combine the privacy manifests across all the third-party SDKs that a developer is using into a single, easy-to-use report. With one comprehensive report that summarizes all the third-party SDKs found in an app, it will be even easier for developers to create more accurate Privacy Nutrition Labels.\n\nAdditionally, to offer additional privacy protection for users, apps referencing APIs that could potentially be used for fingerprinting — a practice that is prohibited on the App Store — will now be required to select an allowed reason for usage of the API and declare that usage in the privacy manifest. As part of this process, apps must accurately describe their usage of these APIs, and may only use the APIs for the reasons described in their privacy manifest.\n\nSecond, we want to help developers improve the integrity of their software supply chain. When using third-party SDKs, it can be hard for developers to know the code that they downloaded was written by the developer that they expect. To address that, we’re introducing signatures for SDKs so that when a developer adopts a new version of a third-party SDK in their app, Xcode will validate that it was signed by the same developer. Developers and users alike will benefit from this feature.\n\nWe’ll publish additional information later this year, including:\n\nA list of privacy-impacting SDKs (third-party SDKs that have particularly high impact on user privacy)\n\nA list of “required reason” APIs for which an allowed reason must be declared\n\nA developer feedback form to suggest new reasons for calling covered APIs\n\nAdditional documentation on the benefits of and details about signatures, privacy manifests, and when they will be required\n\nUpcoming tax changes for apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions\n\nThe App Store’s commerce and payments system was built to empower you to conveniently set up and sell your products and services at a global scale in 44 currencies across 175 storefronts. Apple administers tax on behalf of developers in over 70 countries and regions and provides you with the ability to assign tax categories to your apps and in‑app purchases. Periodically, we update your proceeds in certain regions based on changes in tax regulations.\n\nOn May 31, your proceeds from the sale of apps and in‑app purchases (including auto‑renewable subscriptions) will be adjusted to reflect the tax changes listed below. Prices will not change.\n\nGhana: Increase of the VAT rate from 12.5% to 15%.\n\nLithuania: Reduction of the VAT rate from 21% to 9% for eligible e‑books and audiobooks.\n\nMoldova: Reduction of the VAT rate from 20% to 0% for eligible e‑books and periodicals.\n\nSpain: Digital services tax of 3%.\n\nDue to changes to tax regulations in Brazil, Apple now withholds taxes for all App Store sales in Brazil. We’ll administer the collection and remittance of taxes to the appropriate tax authority on a monthly basis. You can view the amount of tax deducted from your proceeds starting in June 2023 with your May earnings. Developers based in Brazil aren’t impacted by this change.\n\nOnce these changes go into effect, the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps will be updated in App Store Connect. As always, you can change the prices of your apps and in‑app purchases (including auto‑renewable subscriptions) at any time. And now you can change them for any storefront with 900 price points to choose from.\n\nUpcoming changes to the App Store receipt signing intermediate certificate\n\nAs part of ongoing efforts to improve security and privacy on Apple platforms, the App Store receipt signing intermediate certificate that’s used to verify the sale of apps and associated in‑app purchases is being updated to use the SHA‑256 cryptographic algorithm. This update will be completed in multiple phases and new apps and app updates may be impacted, depending on how they verify receipts.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nIf your app verifies App Store transactions using the AppTransaction and Transaction APIs, or the verifyReceipt web service endpoint, no action is required.\n\nIf your app validates App Store receipts on device, make sure your app will support the SHA-256 version of this certificate. New apps and app updates that don’t support the SHA-256 version of this certificate will no longer be accepted by the App Store starting August 14, 2023.\n\nImportant dates\n\nJune 20, 2023. Receipts in the sandbox environment will be signed with the SHA‑256 version of this certificate for devices running a minimum of iOS 16.6, iPadOS 16.6, tvOS 16.6, watchOS 9.6, or macOS Ventura 13.5.\n\nAugust 14, 2023. Receipts in new apps and app updates submitted to the App Store, as well as all apps in sandbox, will be signed with the SHA‑256 intermediate certificate.\n\nFor more details, view TN3138: Handling App Store receipt signing certificate change.\n\nApp Store pricing upgrades have expanded to all purchase types\n\nIn December, we announced the most comprehensive upgrade to pricing capabilities since the App Store first launched, including additional price points and new tools to manage pricing by storefront. Starting today, these upgrades and new prices are now available for all app and in‑app purchase types, including paid apps and one‑time in‑app purchases.\n\nMore flexible price points. Choose from 900 price points — nearly 10 times the number of price points previously available for paid apps and one‑time in‑app purchases. These options also offer more flexibility, increasing incrementally across price ranges (for example, every $0.10 up to $10, every $0.50 between $10 and $50, etc.).\n\nEnhanced global pricing. Use globally equalized prices that follow the most common pricing conventions in each country or region, so you can provide pricing that’s more relevant to customers.\n\nWorldwide options for base price. Specify a country or region you’re familiar with as the basis for globally equalized prices across the other 174 storefronts and 43 currencies for paid apps and one‑time in‑app purchases. Prices you set for this base storefront won’t be adjusted by Apple to account for taxes or foreign currency changes, and you’ll be able to set prices for each storefront if you prefer.\n\nRegional options for availability. Define the availability of in‑app purchases (including subscriptions) by storefront, so you can deliver content and services customized for each market.\n\nGet ready for enhanced global pricing updates in May\n\nThe App Store’s global equalization tools provide a simple and convenient way to manage pricing across international markets. On May 9, 2023, pricing for existing apps and one‑time in‑app purchases will be updated across all 175 App Store storefronts to take advantage of new enhanced global pricing. The updated prices will be globally equalized to your selected base country or region using publicly available exchange rate information from financial data providers. These price points will also follow the most common conventions in each country or region so that prices are more relevant to customers.\n\nYou can now update your current pricing to take advantage of the enhanced global pricing using App Store Connect or the App Store Connect API. If you haven’t made price updates for your existing apps and one‑time in‑app purchases by May 9, Apple will update them for you using your current price in the United States as the basis. If you’d like a different price to be used as the basis, update the base country or region for your apps or in‑app purchases to your preferred storefront. You can also choose to manually manage prices on storefronts of your choice instead of using the equalized price.\n\nLearn how to select a base storefront\n\nLearn how to set in-app purchase availability\n\nLearn how to view the new pricing\n\nUpcoming tax and price changes for apps and in‑app purchases\n\nThe App Store’s commerce and payments system was built to empower you to conveniently set up and sell your products and services at a global scale with 44 currencies across 175 storefronts. Periodically, we update prices on the App Store in certain regions based on changes in taxes and foreign exchange rates. This is done using publicly available exchange rate information from financial data providers to help ensure prices for apps and in‑app purchases stay equalized across all storefronts.\n\nOn February 13, 2023, prices of apps and in-app purchases (excluding auto-renewable subscriptions) on the App Store will increase in Colombia, Egypt, Hungary, Nigeria, Norway, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Prices in Uzbekistan will decrease to reflect a reduction of the value-added tax rate from 15% to 12%. Your proceeds will be adjusted accordingly and will be calculated based on the tax-exclusive price.\n\nWhile prices on the App Store in Ireland, Luxembourg, Singapore, and Zimbabwe won't change, your proceeds will be adjusted to reflect the following tax changes:\n\nIreland: Reduction of value-added tax rate on electronic newspapers and periodicals from 9% to 0%\n\nLuxembourg: Reduction of value-added tax rate from 17% to 16%\n\nSingapore: Increase of goods and services tax rate from 7% to 8%\n\nZimbabwe: Increase of value-added tax rate from 14.5% to 15%\n\nAdditionally, by the end of January proceeds will increase for local developers selling in Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia, Singapore, South Korea, Tajikistan, Thailand, and Uzbekistan.\n\nApple will estimate and remove taxes based on the tax category information you have provided before calculating commission. Exhibit B of the Paid Applications Agreement will be updated to reflect this change.\n\nOnce these changes go into effect, the Pricing and Availability section of My Apps will be updated. As always, you can change the price of your apps and in-app purchases (including auto-renewable subscriptions) at any time in App Store Connect. If you offer subscriptions, you can choose to preserve prices for existing subscribers.\n\nAnd as previously announced, in spring 2023, upgraded pricing capabilities for apps and in-app purchases will provide you 700 additional price points and more flexibility to set prices per storefront, so you can manage foreign exchange rate changes independent of globally equalized prices.\n\nView the updated price tier charts.\n\nSKAdNetwork 4.0 now available\n\nThe SKAdNetwork API lets advertisers measure the success of advertisements by attributing app installations to specific ad campaigns — all while maintaining user privacy.
