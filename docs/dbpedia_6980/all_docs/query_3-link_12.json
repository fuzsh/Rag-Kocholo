        "text": "BEATRICE\n\nWhat should I do with him? Dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard isless than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not forhim. Therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bearherd, and lead his apes into hell.\n\nBEATRICE\n\nAnd what would I do with him? Dress him up in my clothes and make him my serving woman? If he has a beard, he's more than a youth. And if he has no beard, he's less than a man. If he's older than a handsome youth, then he's not for me. But if he's less than a man, then he wouldn't be able to handle me. Therefore, I bet that I'll die an old maid, and lead apes and bears in hell, as they say unmarried women will.\n\nBEATRICE\n\nNo, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say, “Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here’s no place for you maids.” So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter. For the heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the dayis long.\n\nBEATRICE\n\nNo, just to its gates. There the devil will meet me, looking like an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say, \"Go off to heaven, Beatrice, go off to heaven. Hell is no place for virgins.\" So, I'll leave my apes behind and fly up to Saint Peter at heaven's gates. Then he'll show me the part of heaven where the unmarried people live, and we'll all live together happily ever after.\n\nBEATRICE\n\nThe fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time. If the Prince be too important, tellhim there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For hear me, Hero, wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace. The first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly modest as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave.\n\nBEATRICE\n\nCousin, if he doesn't court you properly and appropriately, the fault will be in his timing. If he presses you too hard, tell him that everything has its proper rhythm, and romance is like a dance. Listen, Hero, the three stages of romance are like three dances. The initial courtship is hot and hasty like a Scottish jig, and just as full of fantasy. Then the wedding is a slower, more solemn dance, full of dignity and tradition. And then comes the stage where you regret your marriage, and this stage is like the lively cinquepace dance, which keeps getting faster and faster until you fall into your grave.\n\nBEATRICE\n\nWhy, he is the Prince’s jester, a very dull fool, only his gift is in devising impossible slanders. None but libertines delight in him, and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villainy, for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet. I would he had boarded me.\n\nBEATRICE\n\nWhy, he's the Prince's jester—a very stupid fool, whose only gift is coming up with outrageous insults. Only immoral rascals enjoy his company, and they don't like his wit, but only his rudeness. He both pleases and angers people; they laugh at him and then beat him up. I'm sure he's in that army of dancers out there. I wish he had been brave enough to approach me for a battle.\n\nCLAUDIO\n\n[unmasking] Thus answer I in the name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio. 'Tis certain so, the Prince woos for himself. Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love. Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues. Let every eye negotiate for itself And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood. This is an accident of hourly proof, Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero.\n\nCLAUDIO\n\n[Taking off his mask] I answered to Benedick's name, but I heard this bad news with Claudio's ears. So it's true: the Prince wants Hero for himself. Friendship is loyal in all things except for the business of love. Therefore all lovers should speak only for themselves. Let everyone do their own courting, and not trust any middle-men. Beauty is a witch whose spells melt honor into passion. This is something that happens all the time, but I never expected it to happen to me. Farewell then, Hero.\n\nBENEDICK\n\nAlas, poor hurt fowl, now will he creep into sedges. But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The Prince’s fool! Ha, it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong. I am not so reputed! It is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out. Well, I’ll berevenged as I may.\n\nBENEDICK\n\nAlas, that poor wounded bird. Now he'll crawl into the bushes and hide. But how strange that Lady Beatrice should seem to recognize me, and yet also not recognize me! \"The Prince's jester!\" Ha, maybe they call me that because I am cheerful. No, but I'm only insulting myself by thinking this. I don't have that kind of a reputation! It's just Beatrice's mean, sarcastic nature that causes her to think that everyone in the world shares her opinion, and therefore makes her describe me in this way. Well, I'll get my revenge if I can.\n\nBENEDICK\n\nTroth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the goodwill of this young lady, and I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.\n\nBENEDICK\n\nTruly, my lord, I played the part of Lady Rumor and relayed the news to him. I found him here, as melancholy as a rabbit in a burrow. I told him—and I think I told him the truth—that you had won over the lady's goodwill. I then offered to accompany him to a willow tree, to either help him make a garland as a forsaken lover, or else to bind willow switches into a whip to beat him.\n\nBENEDICK\n\nO, she misused me past the endurance of a block! An oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her. My very visor began to assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that Iwas the Prince’s jester, that I was duller than a greatthaw, huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed. She would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire, too. Come, talk not of her. You shall find herthe infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while sheis here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither. So indeedall disquiet, horror and perturbation follows her.\n\nBENEDICK\n\nOh, she's insulted me so badly that not even a block of wood could endure it! An oak tree with only one green leaf left would revive itself to respond to her abuse. Even my mask started to come to life and try to argue with her. She told me—not recognizing me as myself—that I was the Prince's jester, and duller than mud. She piled up mockery upon mockery until I stood paralyzed, like a man set up as a target with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks daggers, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her insults, she would stink up and kill everything from here to the North Star. I wouldn't marry her even if her dowry were Paradise. If Hercules were her husband, she'd make him cook for her, and chop up his club for firewood. Come on, don't talk about her. She's like Atë dressed up in fine clothes. I wish to God that some magician would exorcize her, for as long as she's here on earth, hell itself must be just as quiet as a church. People sin on purpose just so they can go to hell and escape her. Indeed, chaos, horror, and turmoil follow her everywhere.\n\nBENEDICK\n\nWill your grace command me any service to the world’s end? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on. I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of Prester John’s foot, fetchyou a hair off the great Cham’s beard, do you any embassage to the Pygmies, rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me?\n\nBENEDICK\n\nWill your Grace please send me on a mission to the ends of the earth? I'll go to the other side of the globe for any silly errand you can come up with. I'll fetch you a toothpick from the farthest reaches of Asia, or find out Prester John's shoe size, or bring you a hair from Cham's beard, or deliver any message you want to send to the Pygmies—anything rather than exchange three words with this man-eating vulture. Don't you have any work for me?\n\nCLAUDIO\n\nSilence is the best announcer of joy. If I were only a little happy, I could say how much, but as it is I'm speechless.\n\n[To HERO] Lady, you are mine, and I am yours. I give myself away for you, and I delight in the trade.\n\nDON PEDRO\n\n[to CLAUDIO] Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing, but I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shallnot go dully by us. I will in the interim undertake oneof Hercules' labors, which is to bring Signor Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection, th' one with th' other. I would fain have it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction.\n\nDON PEDRO\n\n[To CLAUDIO] Come, you shake your head at such a long wait. But I promise you, Claudio, the time won't be boring for us. While we wait, I intend to take on an impossible task, like one of the Labors of Hercules: I want to make Sir Benedick and Lady Beatrice fall totally in love with each other. I want to see them matched. And I'm sure I can arrange it, if you three will help me when I ask for it.\n\nDON PEDRO\n\nAnd Benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that I know. Thus far can I praise him: he is of a noble strain, of approved valor, and confirmed honesty. I willteach you how to humor your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick. —And I, with your two helps, will so practice on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer; his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.\n\nDON PEDRO\n\nAnd Benedick isn't the worst husband I know. I can praise him this much at least: he is well-born, he's had his bravery tested in battle, and he is established as an honorable man. I'll teach you how to influence your cousin so that she falls in love with Benedick.\n\n[To CLAUDIO and LEONATO] And we men will scheme against Benedick so that, despite his quick wit and fear of marriage, he will fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, then we'll steal all of Cupid's glory. He won't even be able to call himself an archer anymore—we will be the only gods of love! Now come inside with me, and I'll tell you my plan."
