This Agreement may not be changed or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of Rockwell Automation. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The parties acknowledge that they have required the Agreement to be drafted in English. In the event of a conflict between the English and other language versions, the English version will prevail.
