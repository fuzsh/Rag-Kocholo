        "text": "Save as PDF\n\nTranslatable\n\nThis page provides an overview of working with letters including configuration, enabling/disabling letters, a list of all the letter types, etc. For specific information on topics such as the available options for overdue notices, the types of print slips and receipt notices that are available, support for sending ad-hoc messages to patrons or patron groups, etc., see Notices.\n\nTo configure letters, you must have one of the following roles:\n\nGeneral System Administrator\n\nLetter Administrator\n\nAlma provides a letter system to send highly customizable messages to patrons, librarians, and vendors. Messages include warnings, confirmations, notifications, summary information, orders, fulfillment requests, and so forth. Messages can be sent by email, SMS, ISO protocol, or other means, or they can by printed out via printer or an external system to be sent by mail. Every letter that can be sent to a printer/email can be printed out using Quick Printing.\n\nAlma includes a list of letter types, where a single letter type can be used to send multiple letters that use the same structure. Alma constructs a letter by combining dynamic XML fields generated by Alma (data), labels (static text), and a template (formatting). The static labels and template (XSL style sheets) are included with Alma but may be configured by the user. For institutions whose users prefer languages other than English, label sets are provided in multiple languages.\n\nMost letters are sent automatically by Alma at the appropriate stage in a workflow. For example, Alma sends a letter to a patron after an item borrowed by the patron is marked as overdue. Some letters can be sent by a user at any time, such as a query to a vendor or a patron.\n\nAlma does not use the letter subsystem for certain types of protocol-specific communication with supporting entities, such as ERPs or other ILSs. For example, Alma can use electronic data interchange (EDI) in place of email to communicate with supporting vendors.\n\nFor a video showing the entire letter configuration process in Alma see Letter Configuration in Alma.\n\nFor an overview of configuring Alma letters watch the Configuring Letters in Alma video (5:38 minutes).\n\nAccessing and Configuring Alma Letters\n\nAll Alma letters appear on the Letters Configuration page (Configuration Menu > General > Letters > Letters Configuration).\n\nYou can view specific groups of letters by using the filters above the list of letters.\n\nThe Description text is hard-coded and cannot be configured.\n\nIn addition you can perform the following actions:\n\nEnabling/disabling letters\n\nSetting retention periods\n\nUpdating templates to set the content and formatting for letters\n\nUpdating labels (fields/strings of text that are used in the letter and can be translated)\n\nUpdating and Previewing Example Letters for Testing\n\nContributing Letter Customizations to the Community Zone\n\nYou will need to assign the Letter Administrator role to users who will customize or maintain the email letters. For more information on assigning roles, see Adding Roles to Users.\n\nIf you are working in a sandbox environment or a pre-”Go Live” production environment, add the letter administrators’ email addresses to the allowed email list (see Configuring Allowed Emails).\n\nEnabling/Disabling Letters\n\nSome letters can be activated for different types of notifications, for example SMS and email; the notification type of a letter is listed in the Channel column. If the email version of a letter type is disabled, for example, then email communication is disabled for the relevant scenario.\n\nAlma does not send disabled letters. Attempting to send a disabled letter may result in an error notification when the letter is triggered.\n\nSome notifications may be disabled for specific users or for bulk sets of users. For more information, please see Configuring Library Notices Opt-In.\n\nSelect Restore Activation in the row actions menu for a specific letter, to restore the Enabled button to its Out of The Box (OTB) state. If the button is already in its OTB state, this button does nothing.\n\nSetting Letter Retention\n\nTo indicate that the configured letters are deleted after a certain number of days, add a retention period, in number of days, in the Retention Period field of email letters. If no retention period was defined, then letters sent by Alma are retained indefinitely and available on the Attachments tab of the User Details (see Managing User Attachments).\n\nA weekly job, Letters Purge with Retention, deletes all enabled letters, if they were created more than the configured number of days ago.\n\nIn the Letters list, you can restore the default retention period for all letters by selecting the Restore letters' retention table.\n\nUsing Labels to Update the Fields in the Letter\n\nIf you want to configure display labels for Primo VE, see Configuring Display Labels.\n\nWhat are Letter Labels\n\nTwo kinds of data are used by the letter before it is sent to the patron, printer, etc: labels and XML data. Labels are static strings of text that you can update and translate. XML data is generated automatically by Alma, and can be updated by configuring the XSL template (see Customizing Letter Templates).\n\nYou can use the labels to easily edit a letter without needing to edit the actual XSL template. For example, if you want the letter to state \"Item Description\" instead of just \"Description\", then you can change it in the labels:\n\nHow to Configure Letter Labels\n\nYou can configure the labels for a specific letter as described below.\n\nTo configure letter labels:\n\nSelect Edit on the row action list of the letter.\n\nSelect the Labels button at the top of the page.\n\nSelect Customize from the row actions menu. You can update the following:\n\nEnabled — Use this toggle to activate/deactivate the label for usage in the letter.\n\nDescription — Update the label description that displays on the letter.\n\nNote that using HTML tags in the Description field is not supported.\n\nTranslation — If another language is enabled in Alma and it is selected in the Filter drop down, you can edit the translation.\n\nRestore — If the line was modified, the Enabled and Description fields are restored to their default.\n\nRestore Translation — If another language is enabled in Alma and its Translation label was modified, the field is restored to the default.\n\nSelect Customize All to edit all rows.\n\nSelect Restore All to restore all rows to their default.\n\nSelect Restore Default Translations to restore all translations.\n\nWhen done, select Save. Any changes made to the Labels List are saved, regardless of the Save/Cancel action selected on the main XSL Preview page.\n\nYou can view the changes in the letter preview pane.\n\nTo disable a label, see the knowledge base article How can I disable a line in an Alma email letter?\n\nIncluding Request ID in the Subject Label\n\nSome letters can include the string %reqId% in the description column of the Subject label. This will be replaced with the request’s ID when the letter is generated. The letters that include this option are:\n\nBorrower Overdue Email Letter\n\nExternally Obtained Letter\n\nFul Cancel Email Letter\n\nFul Outgoing Email Letter\n\nFul Renew Email Letter\n\nLending Recall Email Letter\n\nQuery To Patron Letter\n\nUsing Templates to Update Letter Formatting and Content\n\nIf you have reached this section of the online help while attempting to configure a copyright declaration, see Configuring Copyright Declarations. For information on configuring a resource sharing copyright declaration, see Configuring a Resource Sharing Copyright Declaration.\n\nIn addition to editing labels (see Configuring Letter Labels) you can edit the template (XSL style sheet). The XSL template determines which fields and text appear in the letter and is used to format the letter. You can use XSL conditional statements to make decisions about what appears in a letter, and even whether the letter is sent. For an example, see How to use the if condition to configure a letter to not be sent under certain circumstances.docx.\n\nHow to Customize Letter Templates\n\nEx Libris Support is available to assist with issues related to customized XSL stylesheets. However, their troubleshooting effort is within practical limits. If a style sheet is heavily customized, it may require time-consuming analysis to identify a specific error. Such validation cannot be provided by Support for all customized style sheets. The best practice in these situations is for you to eliminate one condition/test/section at a time to determine what causes the problem.\n\nTo customize a letter's template (XSL style sheets):\n\nSelect Edit on the row action list of the letter. The XSL and XML information appear to the left of the letter.\n\nTo the right of the XML/XSL panes is a preview pane of the actual letter output.\n\nChanges in the XSL/XML are immediately reflected in the preview pane.\n\nErrors that are detected while editing the XSL/XML are marked with a red X on the relevant line.\n\nNote that Due to technical limitations, there might be a gap between the error line number reported on the XSL/XML and the line number reported on the Preview pane.\n\nThe editor also marks the XSL segments in color and implements auto-completion. Ctrl+f can be used to find items within the editor.\n\nYou can use Ctrl+Shift+f to implement Prettyprint (convert and present the XSL source code with line breaks and indentations to make the code easier to read).\n\nYou can use Ctrl+Shift+H to provide the X-Path for a particular XML element when you click on that element within the XML editor textbox. This is especially useful when you need to copy an XML element into the XSL.\n\nYou can maximize the XML/XSL windows using the full-screen icon.\n\nUpdate the labels associated with the letter (see Using Labels). Changes to the labels display in the preview pane.\n\nSelect Open in new tab to open the preview in a separate browser tab and edit the HTML using accessibility plugins.\n\nSelect Visual or HTML to toggle between a visual and HTML view.\n\nSelect another language in the Language drop down to view the letter in a different language. The languages that appear depend on the settings configured in Alma.\n\nSome elements, such as the letter name and subject, are extracted from the letter XML and therefore will not change when changing the preview letter language.\n\nUpdate the Width to visualize the output as it will be displayed in narrow screens or printers. Use px to configure the width in pixels, for example 500px.\n\nReusable components display in the preview pane (see Reusing Components Across Letters).\n\nSelect Save Draft to save your customizations as a draft. Changes done in the draft will not be applied to the real letter. Select Remove Draft to erase the draft and display the last saved XSL. Select Restore to restore the XSL to its original state.\n\nNote that while a draft is active, the Edit Draft and Remove Draft options are available in the row actions menu for the letter.\n\nThe draft watermark displays in the preview pane.\n\nSelect Save to apply the changes to the real letter. This removes the draft (if one exists for this letter). Note that after saving, the letter remains in the preview window. To return to the full list of letters, select Cancel.\n\nTo send an example by email, add an address to the Send example by email field and select Send.\n\nYou can view examples of letters by selecting Letter Examples. In the Letter Examples page you can add examples of letters that were sent by Esploro and upload new examples. See Updating and Previewing Example Letters for Testing.\n\nIf you use a tag to refer to an outside location such as a template or URL (for example, <xsl:include href=\"http://{$PathToWeb}/html/xsl/head.xsl\">) and the outside source changes, refresh the XSL (by re-saving it) for the new information to be included in the letter.\n\nConditional Statements\n\nFor a description of how to use conditional statements, see How to use the if condition to configure a letter to not be sent under certain circumstances.docx.\n\nGeneral Examples of XSL Customizations\n\nThe following examples show what you can do with XSL to customize the output of your letters. For examples of specific letters see Example of Query to Patron Letter Customization and Example of Borrowing Activity Letter Customization.\n\nOutput Last Four Digits of a Code\n\nUse the substring and string-length functions to output the last four digits of a code:\n\n<b>@@requested_for@@ :*****\n\n<xsl:value-of select=\"substring (notification_data/user_for_printing/identifiers/code_value/value,string-length(notification_data/user_for_printing/identifiers/code_value/value) - 3)\"/></b>\n\nAdd Notes to Vendor and Rush Indicator to Order List Mail Letter\n\nAdd notes to the vendor (from the PO line) and the rush indicator to the Order List Mail letter:\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><b>Notes To Vendor: </b><xsl:value-of select=\"/notification_data/po/po_line_list/po_line/vendor_note\"/>&#160;</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><b>Is Rush? </b><xsl:value-of select=\"/notification_data/po/po_line_list/po_line/rush\"/>&#160;</td>\n\n</tr>\n\nAdd Condition for Notes that May Affect Loan\n\nEnsure that the Notes that may affect loan line appears in the On Hold Shelf letter only if there is a block on the patron:\n\n<xsl:if test=\"notification_data/request/system_notes !=''\">\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><b>@@notes_affect_loan@@:</b></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><xsl:value-of select=\"notification_data/request/system_notes\"/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\nSee also How to use the if condition to configure a letter to not be sent under certain circumstances.docx.\n\nInclude Phone Number in All Letters Using this Template\n\nIf the following snippet follows the address line in the SenderReceiver.xsl file, you can ensure that the user’s phone number is included in all the letters that use this template.\n\n<tr>\n\n<td><xsl:value-of select=\"notification_data/user_for_printing/phone\"/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\nInclude Template Name as Hidden Text\n\nHave the name of the template appear as hidden text in the output by adding the following after the <html> tag:\n\n<html> <xsl:attribute name=\"data-filename\"> <xsl:value-of select=\"/notification_data/general_data/letter_type\"/> </xsl:attribute>\n\nThe output will include something like:\n\n<html data-filename=”FulLoanReceiptLetter”> ...\n\nRemove an Element from a Letter\n\nTo remove an element from a letter, find the element to be removed. Add comment indicators on either side of the line, such as, <!--<th>@@description@@</th>-->.\n\n<th>@@title@@</th>\n\n<!--<th>@@description@@</th>-->\n\n<th>@@author@@</th>\n\n<th>@@due_date@@</th>\n\n<th>@@fine@@</th>\n\n<th>@@library@@</th>\n\nThe output table displays without the description column.\n\nSuppress Letters to Users in Specific Group\n\nSuppress a letter being sent to users in a specific user group. Add a terminate clause condition in these two places.\n\nAfter the initial include lines at the top of the letter, as follows:\n\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr><td><xsl:for-each select=\"notification_data\">\n\n<xsl:if test=\"user_for_printing/user_group='STUDENT_GRADUATE'\">\n\n<xsl:message terminate=\"yes\">user group is STUDENT_GRADUATE </xsl:message></xsl:if></xsl:for-each></td></tr>\n\n</table>\n\nAnd below this line:\n\n<xsl:template match=\"/\">\n\nIn the above example, the letter is not generated for users in the Graduate Student user group. For a more detailed explanation, see How to use the if condition to configure a letter to not be sent under certain circumstances.docx.\n\nExample of Query to Patron Letter Customization\n\nYou can use the enhanced XSL Query to Patron letter to configure alternative versions of query letters that can be sent to patrons when library staff have questions about a particular resource-sharing borrowing request. For general examples of what you can do with XSL to customize the output of your letters, see General Examples of XSL Customizations.\n\nYou can define up to 30 versions of the letter, for example, one for a question about the requested item and another for a query about how to handle a problem that has arisen with regard to a request (see Configuring Patron Query Types).\n\nOnce the patron query types are configured, a user with the Letter Administrator role can modify the labels and the style sheet of the Query to Patron letter.\n\nTo modify the Query to Patron letter:\n\nConfirm that the Query to Patron letter is enabled (see Enabling/Disabling Letters).\n\nDownload a copy of the Query to Patron XML fields, as follows:\n\nAdd a borrowing request for an inventory item (make yourself the Requester; see Adding a Resource Sharing Borrowing Task From a Search).\n\nOn the Resource Sharing Borrowing Requests page (Fulfillment > Resource Sharing > Borrowing Requests), in the row actions of the new request, select Send query to patron (see Managing Resource Sharing Borrowing Requests).\n\nUnder Email template, select the letter to send, and then select Send Email to send it.\n\nEdit the Query to Patron letter (Edit from the row actions menu).\n\nSelect the Letter Examples button.\n\nSelect the Add from System Letters button.\n\nSelect the letter that was sent.\n\nIn the Letter Examples page make this letter the Default Preview.\n\nIn the XML preview pane, you will now see the new letter.\n\nSelect Download to save the XML letter to a file, such as letter.xml.\n\nModify the labels:\n\nOn the Letters Configuration page (Configuration Menu > General > Letters > Letters Configuration), locate the Query to Patron letter and open it for editing.\n\nSelect the Labels button.\n\nEntries whose Codes begin with Type_xx (Type_1, Type_2, Type_3, and so forth) will only be included in the versions of the Query to Patron letter whose patron query types correspond with those numbers (see Configuring Patron Query Types). For example, the Codes of the entries that will only be included in the Type_1_query_name version of the query letter begin with Type_1 (e.g., Type_1_header, Type_1_subject).\n\nFor each of the entries that are specific to the enabled patron query types, in the row actions, select Customize, and then enter the appropriate text in the Description column.\n\nSelect Save.\n\nModify the XSL:\n\nIn the Xsl pane, modify the relevant XSL to change the format of your letter. The same XSL file is used to format all of the versions of the Query to Patron letter. You can add labels or fields from the XML, use the values of these fields to define conditions, and so forth.\n\nFor example, a conditional clause looks something like:\n\n<xsl:when test=\"notification_data/query_type = 'Type_1_query_name'\">\n\n... special configurations for type 1 queries ....\n\n</when>\n\nThe default template only includes rules for patron query types 1 and 2. If your system has more than two types defined, you must add rules for the additional types to the template before you can configure them. You can do this by copying one of the existing rules and modifying the copy as required for each additional rule.\n\nSelect Save (or Save Draft as described in How to Customize Letter Templates).\n\nTo test your changes, upload the XML (letter.xml) as described in Updating and Previewing Example Letters for Testing.\n\nExample of Borrowing Activity Letter Customization\n\nThis example shows how to make the customizations to the Borrowing Activity Letter email. For general examples of what you can do with XSL to customize the output of your letters, see General Examples of XSL Customizations.\n\nThis example describes how to do the following:\n\nChange the name of the letter.\n\nAdd a library-specific message.\n\nDisplay the material type in the list of loans.\n\nSelect here for an example of how to print a barcode to be a scannable barcode as opposed to numbers in the Borrowing Activity Letter.\n\nTo customize the Borrowing Activity letter:\n\nChange the name of the letter to Patron Activity Letter:\n\nOn the Letters Configuration page, find and edit the Borrowing Activity Letter (Configuration > General > Letters Configuration and select Edit from the row actions menu).\n\nSelect the Labels button.\n\nSelect English from the Filter drop-down list. Note that, in addition to changing the names of labels, you can also translate the labels for other languages.\n\nSelect Customize in the row actions list containing the letterName code.\n\nIn the Description field, change the text to Patron Activity Letter.\n\nSelect the Save page action to store the modified values.\n\nConfigure the XML output and view the output in the preview pane.\n\nTo send a sample letter, enter the email address in the Send Example by Email field in the preview pane and select Send.\n\nSelect Save. Note that after saving, the letter remains in the preview window.

For system notifications and letters that incorporate name information such as the Mail Reason Letter XSL, the preferred names can be specified using preferred_first_name, preferred_middle_name, and preferred_last_name. See the following example:\n\n<xsl:value-of select=\"receivers/receiver/user/preferred_last_name\"/>\n\nFor more information on preferred names, see Managing Users.\n\nFor more information on the mailReason.xsl letter, see Reusing Components Across Letters. Configuring Components.\n\nReusing Components Across Letters\n\nYou can reuse components such as headers and footers across letters. See Reusing Components Across Letters.\n\nUpdating and Previewing Example Letters for Testing\n\nOverview of Letter Templates\n\nA template (XSL stylesheet) does not look much like the letter it is used to create, but it contains variable elements in a particular order. The template contains text and XML, as well as XSL commands and variables. Language-dependent text is kept out of the template.\n\nThe letter data comes from internally generated XML fields and from the labels. Label values and XML fields are substituted into the variables in the templates. For example, if the page POLineClaimLetter contains the label greeting, the value you enter into this label is substituted into <xsl:variable name=greeting> in the POLineClaimLetter template.\n\nIf you store the XML output in a file that has an .xml suffix, you can use it to test changes to the letter (see How to download letters as XML files). As an example, here is part of the XML output used to generate a Query to Patron letter.\n\n<notification_data>\n\n<general_data>\n\n<address_c>None</address_c>\n\n<address_c>None</address_c>\n\n<address_from>nosuchmail@no.such.mail.com</address_from>\n\n<current_date>01/08/2017</current_date>\n\n<letter_channel_info></letter_channel_info>\n\n<letter_name>Regarding your request</letter_name>\n\n<letter_type>QueryToPatronLetter</letter_type>\n\n<subject>Regarding your request</subject>\n\n</general_data>\n\n<languages>\n\n<string>en</string>\n\n</languages>\n\n<letter_params>\n\n<address_from>nosuchmail@no.such.mail.com</address_from>\n\n<letter_name></letter_name>\n\n<subject>Regarding your request</subject>\n\n</letter_params>\n\n<letter_texts></letter_texts>\n\n<library>\n\n<address>\n\n<city>chicago</city>\n\n<country>USA</country>\n\n<country_display>United States</country_display>\n\n<create_date>06/20/2014</create_date>\n\n<entity_action></entity_action>\n\n<library_id>12900830000541</library_id>\n\n<library_unit_id></library_unit_id>\n\n<line1>library 2</line1>\n\n<line2></line2>\n\n<line3></line3>\n\n<line4></line4>\n\n<line5></line5>\n\n<note></note>\n\n<originating_id></originating_id>\n\n<postal_code>36500</postal_code>\n\n<preferred>true</preferred>\n\n<segment_types_display>\n\n<string>Billing</string>\n\n<string>Patron Communications</string>\n\n<string>Primary</string>\n\n<string>Shipping</string>\n\n</segment_types_display>\n\n<state_province>IL</state_province>\n\n<user_address_types_display></user_address_types_display>\n\n</address>\n\n<automatic_creation>false</automatic_creation>\n\n<automatically_activate_locate_profile>false</automatically_activate_locate_profile>\n\n<automatically_locate_resource>true</automatically_locate_resource>\n\n<bibliographic_titles></bibliographic_titles>\n\n<cancel_request_on_locate_failure>true</cancel_request_on_locate_failure>\n\n<code>RES_SHARE</code>\n\n<code_rfid></code_rfid>\n\n<create_date></create_date>\n\n<default_acq_loctaion_id></default_acq_loctaion_id>\n\n<default_item_loctaion_id>12900870000541</default_item_loctaion_id>\n\n<default_move_loctaion_id>12900850000541</default_move_loctaion_id>\n\n<default_pickup_loctaion_id>12900830000541</default_pickup_loctaion_id>\n\n<default_printer></default_printer>\n\n<description>Temporarily manages inventory that is sent to or received from resource sharing partners</description>\n\n<digital_objects></digital_objects>\n\n<digital_storage_size></digital_storage_size>\n\n<disable_call_number_calculation>false</disable_call_number_calculation>\n\n<edi_code></edi_code>\n\n<edi_type></edi_type>\n\n<email>\n\n<create_date>03/31/2013</create_date>\n\n<description></description>\n\n<email>nosuchmail@no.such.mail.com</email>\n\n<entity_action></entity_action>\n\n<external_id></external_id>\n\n<library_id>12900830000541</library_id>\n\n<library_unit_id></library_unit_id>\n\n<originating_id></originating_id>\n\n<preferred>true</preferred>\n\n</email>\n\n<entity_action></entity_action>\n\n<ignore_electronic>false</ignore_electronic>\n\n<itemless_library></itemless_library>\n\n<leader_institution_id></leader_institution_id>\n\n<library_id>12900830000541</library_id>\n\n...\n\nUsing Example Letters for Testing\n\nOn the Letter Examples tab, you can use the available XML examples to preview letters and test changes.\n\nIt is recommended to first create a letter example using the regular Alma flow to more closely represent a real letter. Any identifying information should be removed from this example.\n\nHow to Access the Letter Examples:\n\nNavigate to Configuration > General > Letters > Letters Configuration.\n\nSelect Edit in the row actions menu for the relevant letter.\n\nSelect the Letter Examples button.\n\nThere is always one default letter that appears, but you can add more examples as described below.\n\nHow to add existing letters that were generated in your institution:\n\nIn the Letter Examples page, select the Add from system letters button. Note that if this letter has never been sent in the past, as part of the Alma flow, then the Add from system letters button will not display.\n\nThe Sent Letters page appears, showing up to 10 of the most recent XMLs from the last 7 days.\n\nSelect the letter to add.\n\nThe selected letter appears in the Letter Examples page.\n\nSelect Save. This letter will now be the one displayed in the XML pane.\n\nYou can switch between letters in the XML pane by selecting the relevant letter in the drop down list.\n\nHow to download letters as XML files:\n\nIn the Letters Configuration page, for the relevant letter select Edit in the row actions menu.\n\nIn the XML pane, select the Download button.\n\nEdit the file in an XML editor to make any relevant changes.\n\nA dropdown has been introduced above the XML editor, displaying all available example letters XML files. Users can switch between files by selecting an option from this dropdown. Upon selection, the XML editor content is replaced with the information from the chosen file, and the letter preview is automatically refreshed.\n\nHow to add letters that were downloaded as XML files:\n\nIn the Letter Examples page select the Upload letter example (XML) button.\n\nBrowse to and select the XM file and select Upload.\n\nThe added letter is not marked for default preview unless you select it in the Default Preview column.\n\nThese examples are subject to the retention policy of the institution. The XML files saved in the system will be retained for seven days and will be removed by the weekly cleanup job. The XML examples added to the XML list from the system are persistent and will not be cleaned by the weekly job. Any identifying information should be removed from these examples.\n\nContributing Letter Customizations to the Community Zone\n\nYou can contribute XSL templates to the Community Zone and you can copy shared XSL templates from the CZ to your institution for local use. You can also preview how a template will work and look before copying it. This makes it much easier to share XSL templates between institutions.\n\nTo contribute XSL templates to the Community Zone:\n\nAccess the letter you want to contribute to the Community Zone from the Letter Configuration page (Configuration > General > Letters > Letter Configuration).\n\nSelect the ... icon in the XSL pane and then select Contribute.\n\nAdd a description that will help other users in the Community Zone understand your edits to the configuration, and provide the contact information by which other users can contact you in case they have questions.\n\nBy default, your email address appears in the Contact person. You can change this information, for example, to another user's email address or a phone number.\n\nSelect Confirm. The XSL template is contributed to the Community Zone.\n\nIf you or others from your institution attempt to contribute this same XSL configuration again, you are prompted: \"This letter was already contributed for this institution. Are you sure you want to overwrite?\", since the new contribution overwrites the previous contribution. Select Confirm to re-contribute.\n\nYou can view contributed letters by selecting the ... icon in the XSL pane, and then selecting the Shared XSLs option.\n\nIn the row actions menu for the relevant letter, select the Preview option to view the letter.\n\nIf at some point your institution decides to stop sharing a letter, select the Shared XSLs on the XSL pane and find your letter version in the list of versions contributed by all the contributing institutions. Select Delete in the row actions to remove the letter.\n\nTo copy a contributed XSL template to your institution:\n\nAccess the letter you want to copy from the Letter Configuration page (Configuration > General > Letters > Letter Configuration).\n\nIn the XSL pane select the ... icon and then Shared XSLs. This displays all of the XSL versions contributed by multiple institutions.\n\nSelect the relevant letter to copy to your institution and then use the Select button to add it.\n\nThe selected version now displays in the preview window.\n\nSelect Save to save the letter locally at your institution.\n\nConfiguring the From and EnvelopeFrom Addresses for Outgoing Email\n\nAlma sends emails to patrons, library staff, and vendors.\n\nEvery email has two \"from\" addresses:\n\nFrom: Appears in the user's mail reader (generally used to determine the reply to address).\n\nSMTP EnvelopeFrom address Used internally by mail relay servers to determine the origin of the message. This field appears as From (without the colon :) at the very top of the email packet when you look at the packet source, but does not normally appear in the user's mail reader. You may want to configure this field in order to catch bounced emails. This field is configured in the mail handling integration profile (see Setting the EnvelopeFrom Address with the Integration Profile).\n\nSetting the From Address\n\nThe From address can be configured from the addressFrom label or from the Organization Unit page, as described below.\n\nSetting the From Address with the addressFrom Label\n\nYou can configure each outgoing email's From: address by configuring the letter's addressFrom label. The addressFrom label must contain a valid email address. You can also specify an alias for the addressFrom parameter in the following format: alias <actual_email_ID@university.edu>.\n\nNote that for the General mail that you can send when managing a user (see Editing Users), the default From: address is set using the from_address parameter (see Configuring Other Settings).\n\nPurchase order and claim notifications ignore the configured addressFrom field in the letter when an email address is defined in the institution for order response or claim response, respectively. See Configuring Institution/Library Contact Information and Communicating with Vendors.\n\nSetting the From Address for Resource Sharing Letters\n\nFor resource sharing letters, the From: address contains the library's preferred email address, if this address is configured. If the address is not configured, the letters use ILL@exlibrisgroup.com as the From address.\n\nWhen rs_use_addressfrom_letter_param (Configuration > Fulfillment > General > Other Settings) is set to true (default is false), then some letters are sent from the letter configuration for addressFrom (Configuration > General > Letters > Letters Configuration) instead of being sent from the Preferred Email Address set in Configuration > General > Libraries > Add a Library or Edit Library Information > Contact Information tab > Add Address/Edit an existing address. For more information see Configuring Other Settings (Fulfillment). Below is the list of letters that this relates to:\n\nARTEmail message\n\nBorrower Claim Email Letter\n\nBorrower Overdue Email Letter\n\nBorrower Receive Email Letter\n\nBorrower Return Email Letter\n\nExternally Obtained Letter\n\nFul Cancel Email Letter\n\nFul Damaged Email Letter\n\nFul Incoming Slip Letter\n\nFul Lost Email Letter\n\nFul Outgoing Email Letter\n\nFul Renew Email Letter\n\nGeneral mail Letter\n\nInterested In Letter\n\nLender Checked-in Email Letter\n\nLender Email Letter\n\nLender Reject Email Letter\n\nLender Response Email Letter\n\nLender Ship Email Letter\n\nLender Will Supply Email Letter\n\nLending Recall Email Letter\n\nOrderListLetter (if any of the library's email addresses are of type 'Order response')\n\nQuery To Patron Letter\n\nResource Sharing Request Confirmation Letter\n\nResource Sharing Return Slip Letter\n\nResource Sharing Shipping Slip Letter\n\nSee also the documentation regarding Patron Notifications for Fulfillment Library Independence.\n\nSetting the EnvelopeFrom Address with the Integration Profile\n\nThe mail handling integration profile can be set up with a SMTP Envelope From address. You can also use the mail handling integration profile to have Alma send all email through the institution's mail relay server. In this case, the mail relay server sets EnvelopeFrom on the outgoing email.\n\nNote that if a recipient's email server (for patrons and staff, this is generally a server run by your institution) has set up a spam filter, the filter checks whether received emails are actually sent by the domain of the address in EnvelopeFrom. When there is a mismatch, emails may be filtered as spam. To prevent this from happening, EnvelopeFrom should remain <something>@exlibrisgroup.com (unless your institution's anti-spam filters and SPF records are configured properly so that this is not an issue). If you are not worried about emails being filtered as spam, you may want to configure EnvelopeFrom in order to catch bounced emails. Emails caught in an email server's spam filter do not generally result in bounced emails. See Mail device configuration on Ex Libris servers and/or applications for more information.\n\nTo configure the mail handling integration profile:\n\nFor more information on email handling in Alma, see the Alma Technical Requirements document.\n\nOn the Integration Profile List page (Configuration Menu > General > External Systems > Integration Profiles), select Add Integration Profile. Alma allows you to define only one mail handling integration profile. If there is already a mail handling integration profile, select Edit in the row actions list to edit the profile.\n\nEnter a unique code and name for the profile.\n\nIn the Integration Type field, select Mail Handling.\n\nSelect Next. The second page of the wizard appears. Active is selected by default.\n\nIf you want to continue to use Alma's mail server:\n\nSelect Send directly from Ex Libris (selected by default).\n\nEnter a valid email address for SMTP EnvelopeFrom address.\n\nTo use your institution's mail relay server:\n\nSelect Send using institution mail relay. Several additional fields appear.\n\nEnter the institution domain name. After you do this, the domain name appears after the SMTP EnvelopeFrom address field as @<domain name>. The domain name can contain up to 63 lower case alphanumeric characters, dashes -, and periods followed by a period and a two to six character lower case alphabetic top-level domain.\n\nEnter the institution SMTP mail relay host name. The host name can contain lower case alphanumeric characters as well as any of the characters - ! # $ % & ' * + / = ? ^ _ ` { | } or ~ and a period.\n\nCustom SMTP EnvelopeFrom address is selected by default. Enter a username of the address in the unlabeled field below this option. This sets EnvelopeFrom to <username>@<domain name>. The username can contain the same characters as the SMTP mail relay host name.\n\nIf the mail relay requires a username and password to accept email from Ex Libris, enter the username and password. These can be any ASCII characters.\n\nIf the mail relay requires encryption, select Use encryption.\n\nEncryption port is set to 587 for you.\n\nSelect Save.\n\nAfter creating the mail handling integration profile, users are able to test the email configuration. When executed, an email is sent to the preferred email of the logged-in user. In the Mail Handling Definitions section, enter the email address and select Save and Test.\n\nAlma Recommendation for Mail Relay and Support Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)\n\nWhen an email is received by an SMTP server there are several security checks that occur to determine if the email is legitimate or suspicious. If an email is marked as suspicious the SMTP server may delay the delivery of the email, mark the email as ‘spam’ or not deliver the email at all. This article describes how to ensure emails from the Ex Libris cloud will not get marked as suspicious.\n\nEmails can be sent out from Ex Libris products in one of two ways:\n\n1) With a ‘From address’ domain of @exlibrisgroup.com\n\n2) With a branded ‘From address’ for example @institution.edu\n\nFor customers using Primo Classic, we recommend changing the value of default.email.form in the 'Send Email and Sms' code table from default \"donotreply@exlibris.cloud\" to a more appropriate value for your institution, or \"donotreply@exlibrisgroup.com\".\n\nDKIM is currently supported for both of the above methods. Emails sent from our cloud with a ‘From address’ domain of @exlibrisgroup.com should not be marked as suspicious as they are signed using DKIM and Ex Libris has a DMARC policy. Please note that both the SMTP Envelope ‘From address’ as well as the ‘header.from address’ must use the same domain. The SMTP Envelope from address is configured in the Mail Handling integration profile and the header.from address is configured on each individual letter that is sent out. More information on configuring outgoing mail can be found here.\n\nSince late 2023, email services like GMAIL are gradually encouraging DKIM/SPF compliance (see details here: https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?hl=en&sjid=15453546060050396344-EU). This may impact your patron’s user experience.\n\nIf you want to have a DKIM-compliant setup with a custom domain, the recommended method is to configure the Alma mail integration profile with the \"Send using institution email relay\" option and implement DKIM on your institutional email relay.\n\nEmails sent from Ex Libris that are branded with the institution’s domain can be implemented securely in the following two ways:\n\ni) Configure the Ex Libris application to pass the email directly to the institution’s SMTP server to be authenticated under the institution’s policies (DKIM + DMARC).\n\nTo configure the Alma Platform to pass the email to an external SMTP server, please refer to ‘configure the mail handling integration profile’ in the documentation here. Depending on the firewall policy of the institution your IT may need to open access from Ex Libris cloud to the SMTP server for the relevant port. The outgoing IP range for Alma, Primo VE and Primo Classic can be found here .\n\nii) Configure the email to be sent from the Ex Libris cloud and be authenticated using the “Sender Policy Framework” (SPF) and DKIM.\n\nSPF is a method of allowing the Ex Libris cloud to send emails on behalf of the institution. When an email is received by a SMTP server, a security check is performed where the IP that had sent the email is compared to the IPs listed in the DNS record for the ‘From Address’ domain. To configure SPF, the DNS administrator of the institution needs to add the Ex Libris mail relay IP’s to the institution’s domain in a TXT record. The Ex Libris mail relay IP’s differ based on the region of the customer so the relevant ‘SPF Include Entry’ should be chosen. The different ‘SPF Include Entries’ for the different regions can be found here.\n\nDKIM, or DomainKeys Identified Mail, serves as an email authentication method specifically designed to identify fraudulent sender addresses in emails, addressing the issue of email spoofing. Once the DKIM functionality is activated for your institution, the Mail-Handling Integration-Profile will include support for DKIM digital signatures in outgoing emails. Configuration instructions can be found here.\n\nFor more information, see Outgoing emails configuration.\n\nTo Enable DKIM:\n\nMark the DKIM Setup checkbox. This creates the keys and uploads the public key to the Ex Libris DNS. A pop-up window appears with the CNAME details.\n\nCopy the CNAME from the dialogue window and pass it on to your IT, for them to add it to your DNS.\n\nAfter your IT has added it to the DNS, select the Test DKIM DNS Setup option to test it. If the test passed, a success message will appear. If the test failed for whatever reason, a message will appear with details of the failure.\n\nAfter successful testing, select the DKIM Active checkbox. From this point on, outgoing emails will include the DKIM signature.\n\nLetter List\n\nThe following table lists the letters available in Alma.\n\nNotes regarding the following columns in the Alma Letters table below:\n\nThe Translation Eligible column corresponds to the Patron Facing column in the Alma Letters Configuration page. In both cases, a yes, or check mark, in this column means that the letter is eligible for translation for environments using languages other than English.\n\nAlma Letters Letter Name Letter Description Category Channel Translation Eligible ('Patron Facing' flag in Alma) Analytics Letter Contains an analytics report that is sent to report subscribers.
