        "text": "About the Program\n\nBachelor of Arts (BA)\n\nThe sequence of undergraduate programs of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese is designed to lead from the acquisition of competence in written and spoken Spanish or Portuguese, through an acquaintance with the structure and history of one or both of these languages and a critical understanding of the development and achievements of their literatures in the Old World and in the New, to training in advanced study and independent research. The departmentâ€™s policy is to maintain a balanced strength between language and literature and between Peninsular and Latin American facets of a unified field.\n\nStudents in this major choose one of the following concentrations based on general area of interest:\n\nConcentration A: The Languages, Literatures, and Cultures of the Spanish-Speaking World\n\nThis concentration is recommended for students interested in the languages, literature, and cultures of the Spanish-speaking World on both sides of the Atlantic and/or a career in K-12 foreign language teaching, as well as for future graduate students in Hispanic Studies. Spanish is required for this option, and Portuguese and Catalan are optional.\n\nConcentration B: The Languages, Literatures, and Cultures of the Portuguese-Speaking World\n\nThis concentration is recommended for students interested in the language, literature, and culture of the Portuguese-speaking world, and may include up to two upper division electives in Spanish. Portuguese is required for this option, and Spanish is optional.\n\nConcentration C: Latin American Languages, Literatures, and Cultures\n\nThis concentration is recommended for students interested in the languages, literatures, and cultures of both Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking Latin America, and/or a career in K-12 foreign language teaching, as well as for future graduate students in Spanish and Portuguese studies. It requires coursework in both Spanish and Portuguese, which makes possible comparative approaches to the culture, literature, and history of the region.\n\nConcentration D: Hispanic Languages, Linguistics, and Bilingualism\n\nThis concentration is recommended for students interested in the linguistic structure of Spanish and/or Portuguese, bilingualism in society, and/or career in K-12 foreign language teaching, as well as for future graduate students in (Hispanic) Linguistics.\n\nDeclaring the Major\n\nStudents can receive pre-major advising at any time, from the undergraduate major advisor (spanua@berkeley.edu). Students can declare the major once they have completed SPANISH 25 and one upper division course from the department for concentrations A, C, and D. For concentration B, students must complete Spanish 25, PORTUG 50, and one upper division course from the department before declaring the major. These prerequisite courses must be taken for a letter grade.\n\nHonors Program\n\nStudents are eligible to do honors work within the Department of Spanish and Portuguese if they have completed at least two semesters of work at Berkeley with an overall grade point average of 3.3 and a grade point average of at least 3.6 in those courses taken within the major. Students must complete two honors courses, SPANISH H195A (1.5 units) and SPANISH H195B (1.5 units), in two successive semesters, and will write a thesis under the supervision of an appropriate departmental faculty member over the course of two successive semesters. A letter grade, reflecting progress, will be given after the first semester. H195A/B will not count toward the required upper division work in the major. Before the semester in which students intend to begin the honors program, they should speak with the staff undergraduate advisor to verify eligibility for honors work and to discuss the process.\n\nVisit Department Website\n\nCollege Requirements\n\nUndergraduate students must fulfill the following requirements in addition to those required by their major program.\n\nFor a detailed lists of L&S requirements, please see Overview tab to the right in this guide or visit the L&S Degree Requirements webpage. For College advising appointments, please visit the L&S Advising Pages.\n\nUniversity of California Requirements\n\nEntry Level Writing\n\nAll students who will enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley and must be taken for a letter grade.\n\nAmerican History and American Institutions\n\nThe American History and American Institutions requirements are based on the principle that all U.S. residents who have graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.\n\nBerkeley Campus Requirement\n\nAmerican Cultures\n\nAll undergraduate students at Cal need to take and pass this campus requirement course in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity and culture of the United States. AC courses are plentiful and offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American Culture.\n\nCollege of Letters & Science Essential Skills Requirements\n\nQuantitative Reasoning\n\nThe Quantitative Reasoning requirement is designed to ensure that students graduate with basic understanding and competency in math, statistics, or computer/data science. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course taken for a letter grade.\n\nForeign Language\n\nThe Foreign Language requirement may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work taken for a letter grade.\n\nReading and Composition\n\nIn order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing, and critical thinking the College of Letters and Science requires two semesters of lower division work in composition in sequence. Students must complete parts A & B reading and composition courses in sequential order by the end of their fourth semester for a letter grade.\n\nCollege of Letters & Science 7 Course Breadth Requirements\n\nBreadth Requirements\n\nThe undergraduate breadth requirements provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepares Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.\n\nUnit Requirements\n\n120 total units\n\nOf the 120 units, 36 must be upper division units\n\nOf the 36 upper division units, 6 must be taken in courses offered outside your major department\n\nResidence Requirements\n\nFor units to be considered in \"residence,\" you must be registered in courses on the Berkeley campus as a student in the College of Letters & Science. Most students automatically fulfill the residence requirement by attending classes at Cal for four years, or two years for transfer students. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless you graduate early, go abroad for a semester or year, or want to take courses at another institution or through UC Extension during your senior year. In these cases, you should make an appointment to meet an L&S College adviser to determine how you can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.\n\nNote: Courses taken through UC Extension do not count toward residence.\n\nSenior Residence Requirement\n\nAfter you become a senior (with 90 semester units earned toward your B.A. degree), you must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence in at least two semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units. Intercampus Visitor, EAP, and UC Berkeley-Washington Program (UCDC) units are excluded.\n\nYou may use a Berkeley Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence requirement, provided that you successfully complete 6 units of course work in the Summer Session and that you have been enrolled previously in the college.\n\nModified Senior Residence Requirement\n\nParticipants in the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP), Berkeley Summer Abroad, or the UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) may meet a Modified Senior Residence requirement by completing 24 (excluding EAP) of their final 60 semester units in residence. At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after you have completed 90 units.\n\nUpper Division Residence Requirement\n\nYou must complete in residence a minimum of 18 units of upper division courses (excluding UCEAP units), 12 of which must satisfy the requirements for your major.\n\nAcademic Opportunities\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nThere are several options for studying abroad in a Spanish speaking country, with program options that are suitable for students who have no Spanish language background, as well as opportunities for those who are fully fluent. The UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) offers summer, semester and classic full academic year immersion programs. Students with existing language ability may pursue their major studies at some of the most prestigious institutions in Spain and Latin America.\n\nSpanish & Portuguese majors can take up to three approved upper-division elective courses while studying abroad, and five upper-division courses must be taken within the department here at Berkeley.\n\nSpanish & Portuguese minors can take up to two approved upper-division elective courses while studying abroad, and three upper-division courses must be taken within the department here at Berkeley.\n\nThe UCEAP office on campus is in 160 Stephens Hall. More information can be found on the UCEAP website.\n\nPrizes and Awards\n\nThe John K. Walsh Undergraduate Scholarship is awarded to Spanish and Portuguese majors to recognize academic achievement and alleviate the financial burden of education for outstanding undergraduate majors.\n\nCervantes Prize: This prize is for excellence in undergraduate literary studies in Spanish.\n\nCedergren Prize: This prize is for excellence in undergraduate studies in Hispanic Linguistics"
