        "text": "Irving Flint \"Bud\" Foote (1930-2005) spent his career as a professor of English at the School of Literature, Communication, and Culture at the Georgia Institute of Technology. His scholarly interest in science fiction extended to his teaching: He pioneered classes in the study of science fiction, as well as in speed reading and African-American studies.\n\nBud Foote was born on August 19, 1930 in Linconia, New Hampshire. Foote attended Princeton University and received a B.A. in English in 1952 (Summa Cum Laude). Later, Foote attended the University of Connecticut to obtain an M.A. in English before coming to Georgia Tech in 1957. As a professor at Georgia Tech, Foote influenced the curriculum as much as he influenced his students. Both a political activist and folk-music enthusiast, Foote was passionate about the arts and teaching. He had eclectic tastes, and on many occasions he brought his banjo to class.\n\nFoote published poetry, a novel, music and several short pieces of literature (sometimes under the pseudonym \"Og, King of Bashan\"). He amassed a large collection of over 8,000 science fiction books during his career.\n\nFoote retired from Georgia Tech in 1999 after teaching for over thirty years. He died on March 12, 2005."
