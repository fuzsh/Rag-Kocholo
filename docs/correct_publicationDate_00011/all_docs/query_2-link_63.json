Jacket and endpaper art by Kevin Eugene Johnson.\n\nPrivate North Carolina Collection\n\nMurgunstrumm and Others was the winner of the World Fantasy Award for Best Collection/Anthology in 1978.\n\nCarcosa was a small publishing company started by two writers in North Carolina. While it published only four books in eight years, the titles are highly collectable and important for both their illustrations and their contributions to the horror and fantasy genres.\n\nCarcosa books very good in very good jackets. Wellman title with head and tail of spine bumped, light toning to pages, light mark to back board; jacket scuffed, with (1) small stain and edgewear, not price clipped. Cave title with spine lightly rubbed at head and tail, slight separation from text block, marks and scuffing to edges; jacket toned, with edgewear and several closed tears, not price clipped. De Camp title with head of spine lightly bumped, slight separation from text block, small tear and loss to front paste-down endpaper; jacket not price clipped; very good to near fine in near fine slipcase."
