The tradition of keeping track of anonymous overheard bits and bobs started for us at the 2002 ConJose in San Jose, where trying (or trying not to) fill in the blanks on overheard conversations made us laugh so much that we made it a tradition. This issue we share some highlights from this year's World Science Fiction Convention in Anaheim:\n\n\"Just remember how much I love you and disregard how bitchy I'm going to be for the next few days.\"\n\n\"We are two men very pleased with our meat.\"\n\n\"When there are five Australians at the table, it is inevitable that one will try to set the dessert afire.\"\n\n\"You're not going to catch me molesting the bronze giraffe!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, have we met?\"\n\n\"Um, yeah.

More than usual, I mean. If you would like a copy of OLD MAN'S WAR (trade paperback only) or THE GHOST BRIGADES (hardcover only) signed by John Scalzi, or a copy of DOWN AND OUT IN THE MAGIC KINGDOM (trade paperback only), EASTERN STANDARD TRIBE, or SOMEONE COMES TO TOWN, SOMEONE LEAVES TOWN signed by Cory Doctorow, hurry on in (or give us a call) while supplies last! We also have some titles signed by Kathleen Ann Goonan, Robin Hobb, Sean McMullen, artist John Picacio, Brandon Sanderson, Sharon Shinn, Sean Williams and many many others I am forgetting in the post-Worldcon haze.\n\n*Jude would like to point out to everyone that Ellen Kushner's fabulous new novel THE PRIVILEGE OF THE SWORD shortens to the acronym TPOTS, which would have to be pronounced \"teapots\". Thanks to Ellen for bringing this to our attention!\n\nFrom The Office\n\nI've been reading quite a bit lately. Not quite sure how that worked out since I've also been very busy with World Con and all and yet . . . it happened. Not that I'm complaining. Since I opened Borderlands I've probably had less time to read than any other time in my life. That's what happens when you make a hobby into a business.\n\nOne of the standout novels I read was NIGHTWATCH by Sergei Lukyanenko. This is the novel that was the basis for the film. The translation from Russian is excellent, so good in fact that it almost reads like it was originally written in English. When I started it (partly on the advice of my daughter) I was pretty doubtful but within the first chapter or two I was hooked. As usual, I'm not going to waste time with a synopsis but I will say that it is probably the best novel of its type that I've _ever_ read. I should probably explain what its \"type\" is -- a story of secret warfare between the supernatural forces of light and darkness set in modern times. Think of Green's Nightside novels, Leiber's Conjure Wife, Butcher's Dresden Files, Lackey's Diana Trigarde or about half of Tim Powers' work.\n\nI just finished THE HARROWING by Alexandra Sokoloff. It's a pretty straightforward ghost story with all the usual props (like ouiji boards, stormy nights, a deserted school and so forth). That said, the writing is quite good and the pace is engaging. If you like ghost stories, this will satisfy. You'll also have a chance to meet the author in about month since she'll be doing a reading at the store on October 4th.\n\nIt must have been the sunny summer weather that drove me to reading more supernatural material than usual. I didn't notice the trend until now but another book that I greatly enjoyed was SNAKE AGENT by Liz Williams. Detective Inspector Chen works for the Chinese police in the near future. But it's not our future. In Chen's world the supernatural and high tech coexist and the gods (and hell, for that matter) are very real, everyday forces in the world. And Chen's specialty is investigating cases involving the supernatural.\n\nThe thing that I thought was outstanding about SNAKE AGENT is Williams' artful job of sidestepping some of the awkward questions that come up when a writer adds magic to a modern society. For example, how does history change when the forces of hell are players in world politics? One common solution is to make the existence of magic a secret, as Lukyanenko does in NIGHTWATCH. But if the general population knows that the supernatural exists, history and the structure of society changes. If these changes aren't addressed by the author it makes it very hard for the reader to \"believe\" the story.\n\nWilliams' solution is to set the story both slightly in the future and in a very foreign culture. I (and I suspect most readers) don't know enough about Chinese society and culture to spot the inconsistencies (if there are any). Combined with Williams' solid prose and descriptions, this gives the world a depth and reality not often equaled. It's good stuff and I'm quite looking forward to reading the sequel, DEMON IN THE CITY, which has just come in as a hardcover.\n\nAnd now it's time for an embarrassing confession -- until last month I had never read WAR FOR THE OAKS by Emma Bull. Mikael, when he heard, said something very unflattering about my intelligence and my parents' marital status. I would avoid mentioning it to anyone but I really liked it and so I want to tell people about it. It's a great story about a mortal who is pulled into a war between two factions of fairies. Not the cute, Tinkerbell type of fairies but the scary, Thomas the Rhymer variety. If you enjoyed books like TITHE by Holly Black or some of Neil Gaiman's work, you should really give WAR FOR THE OAKS a try. One warning though, it was first published in 1987 and though not dated in most ways there is a sometimes painful New Wave quality that pops up once in a while, especially in the characters' wardrobes. Very painful at times. Did _anyone_ ever actually dress that way? I have some faint memories of it but they're very blurry. It's probably a subconscious self-defense mechanism.\n\nI've still got lots of catch-up to do in the aftermath of the World Science Fiction Convention so I'll wish you all a nice September and talk to you soon.\n\nCafe Update\n\nThings continue to move slowly. I've been short on time to get much work done and so I'm _still_ putting together the permit package. In the past I've started businesses but I've never tried to start one while running another. It's harder than I expected. Running a business takes small amounts of constant effort whereas starting one requires big bursts of effort. The combination is hard to manage. Hopefully there'll be some more news next month.\n\nBest,\n\nAlan\n\nPS If you're in SF, you have got to come out tomorrow night for our last regularly-scheduled movie night at the Variety Screening Room. We're showing FLASH GORDON (the one from the 80s with the soundtrack by Queen) and it's going to be just too cool for words.\n\nTop Sellers At Borderlands\n\nHardcovers\n\n1) Dzur by Steven Brust\n\n2) Hunters of Dune by Kevin J.

The first one I wanted to bring to your attention is the totally over-the-top Bio-zombie thriller called Sars Wars. It’s a Thai production, and is funny as hell and way too enjoyable for its own good.\n\nOn the Anime side of the house, we’ve just got in Cowboy BeBop #1. This is the beginning of one of the landmarks of modern serial Anime and should not be missed.\n\nFrom Korea, we have Forbidden Warrior, which is a costume/period/fantasy piece that delivers the goods. Epic battles between good and evil, crazy wire stunts and a solid story.\n\nFrom Japan, we have Godzilla, Final Wars, which is a must-see for any monster movie fan, as it is the latest Japanese installment (from 2004) of the series that started it all. Also not to be missed is the new US disk: Godzilla - Gojira Deluxe Collector's Edition, which features the original Japanese version of the first Godzilla movie, side by side with the bastardized, re-cut US version of the 1956 classic. This one is a really nice package and it features a ton of extras.\n\nFor an enjoyable little romp that is sure to set all your Pagan/Wiccan friends' teeth on edge, The Craft just came in. The funny thing about this movie is that it preceded the whole Willow the Witch stuff on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but is very much in that vein. This is much more fun, and much funnier then it has any right to be.\n\nSpeaking of being better then it has any right to be, the Dark Castle Remake of The House on Haunted Hill has just been released as a double feature with the original House on Haunted Hill. If you are missing either of these films, be sure to pick up this disk, 'cause it's (excuse the pun) priceless to see Vincent Price in the first film, and then watch Geoffrey Rush do a brilliant homage/sendup to the master. Great stuff.\n\nBack to Japan, for a crazy horror exploitation flick by one of Japan’s weirdest and most prolific directors, Takashi Miike. If you’re not familiar with his work, think of him as John Carpenter meets David Lynch, from Japan. Ichi the Killer is a great place to start sampling the weirdness that is Miike.\n\nAnd finally, from Europe there’s Dario Argento’s foray into the Masters of Horror series: his contribution to this series is called “Jenifer” and is a nice addition to Argento’s catalog, which has been kind of spotty of late.\n\nAnd finally, something for the kids. MGM is looking to cash in on the Pirates of the Caribbean craze, and has released new super extra special editions of The Princess Bride… one with a “Princess Buttercup” themed-package, and one with a “Dread Pirate Roberts\" package. We’ve got both editions in stock. Have fun storming the Castle!\n\n-Jeremy Lassen\n\njlassen@borderlands-books.com\n\nBook Club Info\n\nThe Gay Men's Book Club will meet on Sunday, September 10th, at 5 pm to discuss THE WATCHMEN by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons.

He was looking for a little entertainment. He finds instead a nightmare in the form of a beautiful but strangely pale woman. A woman who offers him passion, ecstasy—and eternal life—but takes in exchange his lifeblood and his very soul.\" LIVE GIRLS is a vampire classic, but it also a skillful, beautiful and terrible look at sexuality and obsession in the shabby world of 1980's Times Square. Meet Ray Garton and celebrate the paperback re-release of the book that made him famous!\n\nThursday, September 14th: Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers' Group Meeting - Contact Jade Livingston at sfscifi@yahoo.com for more information about this writers' group, which meets at Borderlands the second and fourth Thursdays of each month at 6:00 pm.\n\nSunday, September 17th at 3:00 pm: Marcus Ewert, Susan Marie Groppi, and Tim Pratt, TWENTY EPICS (All Star Stories) - From the All-Star Stories website: \"Epics have lost their charm.

Placing five unattached, emotionally-wounded students together on a college campus, Sokoloff delivers a fast-paced psychological thriller. . . Robin Stone decides to stay on Baird College's campus for Thanksgiving break, seemingly alone, just as she had hoped. Then four schoolmates reveal their presence: Patrick, a larger-than-life football player; Lisa, an exotic, boundary-testing tease; Cain, a brooding, dark musician; and Martin, a serious, scholarly eccentric. Each has forsaken a long weekend at home due to assorted family dysfunctions.\n\nWhen Lisa stumbles upon a tarnished, ancient Ouija board, the five students gather for a seance. While at first innocent, the game quickly manifests into something more serious and sinister. They channel a spirit -- Zachary Prince, a Baird student who perished in a fire on the school's campus in 1920 -- and soon strange and inexplicable events start happening.\n\nThanksgiving break concludes, the rest of campus returns, and the quintet settle into an uneasy routine. But soon they realize that they can't possibly forget what they shared on that long weekend, and they can't resist getting together for one more session with Zachary -- or whatever it is that their innocent game has unleashed.\"\n\nSaturday, October 7th at 3:00 pm: Kage Baker, DARK MONDAYS (Nightshade Books) and THE MACHINE'S CHILD (Tor) - Kage Baker has not one but two fabulous books coming out!

It is impossible to describe without spoilers, so we'll just say that the unlikely cavalry heads off to rescue Mendoza from her exile, and then. . .darn it, you'll just have to read the book! Come chat with Kage and find out what is next in store for this talented author and her poor, benighted characters.\n\nSaturday, October 7th at 5:00 pm: Glen Hirshberg, AMERICAN MORONS (Earthling Publications) - \"From the author of the acclaimed novel THE SNOWMAN'S CHILDREN and the award-winning collection THE TWO SAMS comes American Morons, a new collection of dazzling and haunting tales...\n\nTwo traveling college students confront their disintegrating relationship and the new American reality in a breakdown lane along the Italian Superstrade. A woman chases the ghost of her neglectful father to a vanished amusement park at the end of the Long Beach pier. Two recently retired teachers learn just how much Los Angeles has taken from them.\n\nIn these atmospheric, wide-ranging, surprisingly playful, and deeply mournful stories, grandkids and widows, ice cream-truck drivers and judges, travelers and invalids all discover — and sometimes even survive — the everyday losses from which the most vengeful ghosts so often spring.\"\n\nSaturday, October 14th, Litquake Litcrawl: Litquake, San Francisco's Literary Festival, will be held from October 6 to 14.

Frost (DAW , Hardcover, $24.95) - A sweet urban fantasy that reads like a cross between Hamilton's Anita Blake books and Emma Bull. Tess is a recently widowed fantasy writer and a member of the super-secret Sisterhood of the Celestial Blade. She spends this novel attending science fiction conventions while trying to solve a very peculiar mystery with the help of a companion imp that only she can see. The novel frequently strains even fantasy credulity, but the book's heroine is so darn plucky and likable and the fannish silliness is so engaging that it is easy to forgive. Plus, this book contains lyrics to the best filk song ever! Recommended by Jude.\n\nThe Floating Island by Elizabeth Haydon (Starscape, Hardcover, $17.95)\n\nTime for the Stars by Robert A.

Clarke Award, and one of which (Chasm City) won the British Science Fiction Association Award, this is his very first short fiction collection.\n\nIt spans almost the whole of his career, ranging from “Enola” (which appeared in 1991, only his third sale) right up to recent work such as “Understanding Space and Time,” a novella written in 2005, and “Signal to Noise,” a new piece written specially for this book. It is the perfect showcase for the evolution of his writing and themes over the last sixteen years, and features extensive story notes.\n\nSince 2000, Reynolds has been publishing large novels at a rate of one a year, all but two of them are set against a consistent background known as the Revelation Space universe. The stories in ZIMA BLUE, however, while occasionally related to each other, do not partake of that claustrophobic, machine-haunted history. They represent a more optimistic take on humanity’s future, a view that says there may be wars, there may be catastrophes and cosmic errors, but something human will still survive.\n\nTHE SECRET CITY by Carol Emshwiller (Tachyon Publications, Trade Paperback, $14.95) - This inventive adventure centers on a mysterious enclave protecting a lost culture, a hidden city in the wilderness where stranded aliens struggle to preserve their fragile society. Hoping for a better life many have fled the Secret City, trying to survive in the harsh human world; others remain concealed, living out a fading memory in hope of deliverance. When the mythical rescuers suddenly arrive, insisting on an immediate interplanetary return, these very-human aliens discover that neither world is truly their own. This highly original novel leads readers on a heroic journey, told with a subtle interplay of camaraderie and alienation, delving into the very essence of identity.\n\nPORTABLE CHILDHOODS by Ellen Klages (Tachyon Publications, Trade Paperback, $14.95) - Skirting the border between childhood and adulthood this innovative collection offers a tantalizing glimpse of what lies hidden just beyond the ordinary. Mysticism, heroism, cruelty, and compassion thread through these multifaceted tales, which range from the origins of the Manhattan Project to a culinary object-lesson, from 1950s-era corruption to a slight glitch in Creation. From the publication of her first story, nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula awards, Ellen Klages has continued to entertain and challenge her readers. Collected here for the first time, and including an excerpt from her breakout first novel THE GREEN GLASS SEA, these stories have been called timeless, delightful, chilling, and beautiful. This is short fiction at its best, emerging from a unique and powerful voice.\n\nPAST MAGIC by Ian MacLeod (PS Publishing Deluxe Slipcased Hardcover (Limited to 200 copies) $90.00 and Hardcover (Limited to 500 copies) $45.00) - One of the finest SF and fantasy short fiction writers in Britain today, Ian R. MacLeod has won or been shortlisted for Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Sturgeon, British SF, Tiptree, John W. Campbell and Sidewise Awards for his deeply felt, marvelously atmospheric, and highly ingenious stories. Like an inspired fusion of Ray Bradbury and Brian Aldiss, he captures brilliantly the intersection of future possibility and the extremes of human emotion. Now, PS Publishing presents PAST MAGIC, MacLeod's third collection, and his strongest yet.\n\nThe tales gathered here range from slyly rendered time travel to Lovecraftian horror, from alternate histories of theocratic ascendancy and alienated celebrities to a vision of an astronaut lost between universes, from vivid speculative social realism to a meditation on the place of realist art in a world dominated by effortless virtual reality.\n\nThis newsletter is distributed monthly free of charge and may be distributed without charge so long all the following information is included.\n\nDispatches from the Border\n\nEditor - Jude Feldman\n\nAssistant Editor - Alan Beatts\n\nAll contents unless otherwise noted are the property of\n\nBorderlands Books\n\n866 Valencia St.\n\nSan Francisco, CA 94110\n\n415-824-8203\n\nhttp://www.borderlands-books.com\n\nComments and suggestions should be directed to editor@borderlands-books.com\n\nBACK ISSUES OF NEWSLETTER\n\n2006\n\nAUGUST, 2006\n\nJULY, 2006\n\nJUNE, 2006\n\nMAY, 2006\n\nAPRIL, 2006\n\nMARCH, 2006\n\nFEBRUARY, 2006\n\nJANUARY, 2006\n\n2005\n\nDECEMBER, 2005\n\nNOVEMBER, 2005\n\nOCTOBER, 2005\n\nSEPTEMBER, 2005\n\nAUGUST, 2005\n\nJULY, 2005\n\nJUNE, 2005\n\nMAY, 2005\n\nAPRIL, 2005\n\nMARCH, 2005\n\nFEBRUARY, 2005\n\nJANUARY, 2005\n\n2004\n\nDECEMBER, 2004\n\nNOVEMBER, 2004\n\nOCTOBER, 2004\n\nSEPTEMBER, 2004\n\nAUGUST, 2004\n\nJULY, 2004\n\nJUNE, 2004\n\nMAY, 2004\n\nAPRIL, 2004\n\nMARCH, 2004\n\nFEBRUARY, 2004\n\nJANUARY, 2004"
