        "text": "1955 Advent:uring Through the Years 2005\n\nBy Earl Kemp\n\nRobert Briney\n\nSidney Coleman (Retired 2001)\n\nEarl Kemp\n\nJames O'Meara\n\nGeorge Price\n\nJon Stopa\n\nEd Wood (Deceased 1995)\n\nIn the first issue of eI, my friend and Advent partner George Price wrote an article under this same heading. It was George's inside view of the history of Advent:Publishers. The thought occurred to me that I should use the same title to introduce George's Master Archive of the titles published by Advent:Publishers.\n\nOriginally I wanted George to name the piece \"Fifty Years of Advent\" only George was adamant. Because it hadn't actually been fifty years of Advent, we couldn't say it. Now, of course, as it is still not quite yet 2005, Advent is still not yet fifty years old.\n\nIt's a bit difficult, though, to think of this not being at least the pre celebration to Advent's Fiftieth Anniversary that will be accomplished with the publication of Joseph Major's definitive study of Heinlein's juvenile novels, Heinlein's Children.\n\n#\n\nQuestions regarding the availability of Advent titles, and orders for same, should be addressed directly to http://nesfa.org/press/Books/Advent/index.html who have been handling those tasks for a number of years now and are expected to continue doing so in the future.\n\nFollowing is George Price's Master Archive of Advent titles:\n\n#\n\nThe Advent:Publishers Master Archive\n\nCompiled by George W. Price\n\n(with a little help from Robert E. Briney, Earl Kemp, and Jon Stopa)\n\nFirst cloth edition\n\nTitle In Search of Wonder Subtitle Essays on Modern Science Fiction Author Damon Knight (or damon knight) Edition & binding First cloth Date 1956 Introduction Anthony Boucher, pp. vi-xi Foreword Preface Illustrator, jacket/cover Jon Stopa Illustrator, interior J.
