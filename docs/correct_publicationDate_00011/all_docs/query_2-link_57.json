        "text": "Read\n\nJuly 24, 2018\n\nL Sprague de Camp always recedes to niches in my mind, and whenever I come across one of his books, I'm again surprised by his peculiar humor. This is a book of 'The Adventures of W Wilson Newbury, Ensorcelled Banker'.\n\nDedication: \"To Jocelyn Harold Darling, whose Pink Panther inspired the title story\".\n\nThe Acknowledgement pages give the original printing information for the stories, which range from 1975-9.\n\nContents:\n\nForeword: A capsule faux biography of W Wilson Newbury.\n\nI Balsamo's Mirror: The sordid side of time travel\n\nII The Lamp: A former potentate tries to recoup his faded fortunes by using a lamp, said to be from Atlantis, to conjure an Atlantean god.\n\nIII Algy: Trying to track down the Lake Algonquin Monster\n\nIV The Menhir: If you don't know what a 'menhir' is, it's probably best to start with Asterix. Obelix was always carrying one around. So is it legal to restore a broken one?\n\nV Darius: A horse takes a scunner at the protagonist, for reasons (at least at first) obscure.\n\nVI United Imp: What if the small folk unionize?\n\nVII Tiki: An eccentric millionaire (a friend of the Showa Emperor, 'because of their common interest in marine biology'), runs into problems with his collection of marine isopods.\n\nVIII Far Babylon: Why NOT make a model of the Ziggurat of Marduk, aka the Tower of Babel?\n\nIX The Yellow Man: A mixup of leases results in a dispute about who gets to live in a vacation house.\n\nX A Sending of Serpents: A woman joins a cult, and her banker worries about her denuding herself of all her worldly goods to support the cult leader.\n\nXI The Huns: Putting a hex on a motorcycle gang.\n\nXII The Purple Pterodactyls: Genies for minor spells come into conflict when their masters do.\n\nXIII Dead Man's Chest: A more accurate version of the anthropology of pirates. But what if some ships were run differently?\n\nXIV The Figurine: A 'Mayan' (maybe) idol bought as a souvenir plays havoc with television reception...and maybe other things, as well.\n\nThis is the 1979 edition. Normally I don't take much note of the other books advertised in the back, but in this volume there's an ad for Randal Garrett's book Murder & Magic, which was probably a Lord d'Arcy book (Yep, just looked it up: it was the FIRST Lord d'Arcy book). So I'll have to keep an eye out for that. Probably won't find it, but it's worth a try. A good reminder that the text of books is not the whole of their value."
