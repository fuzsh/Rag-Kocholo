While the first two books have been easy to find since their publication, the third volume—an Elliott-O’Donnell style book of royal hauntings in the palaces and castles of Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Russia—vanished from the face of the earth.\n\nIn a feat of literary detection, award-winning editor Johnny Mains and Ramble House have brought this truly lost collection back to life since it was first published and, in doing so, relate the story of an author who lived an incredulous life full of deceit and deviance and visits to several prisons.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n-----------------------\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n-----------------------\n\nThe House of Horror by Robert Halifax\n\nDesmond Charnock, a clever electrical engineer, decides to follow a woman he sees after he leaves a Masonic dinner. He has been struck by love’s lightning bolt. Moments later a man appears, also with an interest in the mysterious woman. The man is swiftly felled by Desmond’s hand.\n\nAnd so begins the extraordinary The House of Horror, a novel unfairly lost since 1911. Written by ‘Robert Halifax’, the pseudonym of Post Office telegraphist Robert Edward Young, The House of Horror is a rare excursion into adventure writing for the author, who was most at home writing novels about the slums of London and the people who lived in them.\n\nIt won’t be long until fate brings Desmond into the life of Gloria, the daughter of the mad anarchist inventor Count Franzmann. The Count needs Desmond’s skill in completing an engine of mass destruction — part of an infernal plot to destroy London and overthrow the Empire. Can Desmond rescue Gloria from the House of Horror?\n\nPart melodrama, with a dashing of anarchism and science-fiction, The House of Horror is a true lost gem, uncovered from the archives by genre researcher and editor Johnny Mains.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n-----------------------\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n-----------------------\n\n___________________________________________\n\n___________________________________________\n\n___________________________________________\n\n___________________________________________\n\nSubscribe to The Rambler\n\n___________________________________________\n\n___________________________________________\n\n(If you haven't received a Rambler for a while, please resubscribe.
