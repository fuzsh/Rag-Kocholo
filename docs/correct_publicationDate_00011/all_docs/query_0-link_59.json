The library in the adjacent barn contained all the works that should have been written and/or published but weren't. These included Love's Labour Found (William Shakespeare), When You Care, When You Love (Theodore Sturgeon), The Wonderful Journey to Mars (Jules Verne), Potpourri Planet (Stanley Weinbaum). After his uncles dies, John goes to live at his home. One morning John's unpublished novel Dangerous Dreams appears on the shelf.\n\nTomorrow Speculative Fiction 1:5 October 1993 (pp14-17)\n\nDane, Lisa, Diamonds and Denim [Romance]\n\nKristine Jackson is a New York publicist. Her latest assignment takes her to Utah to talk best-selling SF writer Roidan Ryder, whose Klakith books are being made into a film by Starburst Pictures, into a publicity tour. Ryder turns out to be a pseudonym of Adam Chaney. Jackson just happens to resemble Embling, the heroine of the book he is currently writing. Naturally, they fall in love. Judging from his library, Cheney has good taste in both SF and mystery. The Chronicles of Klakith (a cross between Burrough's Barsoom and Norman's Gor) are published by Asteroid Books. Eight of the twenty titles are mentioned.\n\nBerkley Different Worlds 13300-1, June 1992\n\nDaniel, Tony, \"Barry Malzberg Drives a Black Cadillac\"\n\nAt age 13 Daniel is sent to retrieve Malzberg from a black hole in the center of the galaxy. This is mostly a tribute to Malzberg and his influence on the writings of Daniel.\n\nTalebones 23 Winter 2001 (pp.4-11)\n\nDaniel, Tony, \"Death of Reason\"\n\nThis is a marginal item. The viewpoint character is a policeman, Meander Harco, who also writes about a time traveling detective Minden Sibley (of the U. S. Time Company). Harco has constructed the Three Temporal Laws upon which his stories are based. Harco has returned to Birmingham, Alabama to track down the murderer of the man who taught him how to write.\n\nIsaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine 16:10 September 1992 (pp120-167)\n\nDanvers, Dennis, Heres What I Know\n\nDennis Danvers, an SF writer, meets his father in a used bookstore. This is somewhat unusual because his father died 23 years ago. There is a plethora of family background but the important issue for the story is that the author has a half-sister in Philadelphia. She attends a science fiction convention therewith his dead fatherand meets her. Together with their father they head off to recover a trove of collectables.\n\nRealms of Fantasy 14:5 June 2008 (pp.74-79, 94)\n\nDarke, David, Shade\n\nScarlett Shade has written a number of successful vampire novels about Countess Showery and Count Downe for Dark Descent Books. One of the reasons for their realism is that Shade herself is a vampire. (It's unusual in the publishing field for a writer to be considered a \"blood sucker.\")\n\nZebra 0-8217-4566-2 May 1994\n\nDarlington, Andrew, \"Derek and the Vampires\"\n\nDerek's flatmate Pete has acquired an old (July 1954) sf magazine, Science Fantasy Adventures #3. It contains stories by John Wyndham and Richard Matheson, among others, and the cover depicts a future city in a bleak, furnace-hot burning desert. Moreover, an ad on the back age contains a website addressdecades before such things existed. After Pete logs in to the address, both he and Derek are visited by erotic dreams/hallucinations of women (or parts of women) and are tempted to produce orgasms. The premise suggested is that males of the far future (presumably the one on the magazine cover) have become sterile from radiation, and that the time link and erotic sendings are a method to steal sperm from healthy males of the past.

Was That the Squeal of an Angry Thoat?\"\n\nSurreal is one description of this item set in Greenwich Village of the 1950sbut a Greenwich Village that did not exist in our world or, perhaps, any world. It is more a description of the characters living near Avram Davidson (for he is one of the characters, here) than of any planned story. One writer is identified by name; this is Calvin M. Knox, a pseudonym used by Robert Silverberg, who was living in New York at that time. Wendell Garrett may be Randall Garrett. Near the end of the story John Carter shows up looking to send a message to his nephew, Edgar Rice Burroughs. Finally, a Thark astride a thoat rides through the streets, seen by a small boy.\n\nFantastic Stories, 6:4 December 1977 (pp.76-83) [Title misspelled as \"Throat\"]\n\nThe Years Best Fantasy Stories: 4, (edited by Lin Carter), DAW UE1425 (no. 318), December 1978 (pp.103-113)\n\nInside the Funhouse, (edited by Mike Resnick), AvoNova 76643-4, August 1992 (pp.220-230)\n\nDeBaun, R.

Sally-Ann Turner lives in a future New York where private ownership of pets is banned. She wants a dog and convinces a famous inventor to let her help him build a robotic one.

The Royal Librarian writes a preface and foreword to the Castle Edition of the book. He is suitably appalled that he is quoted in a blurb on the back cover of the book lending his approbation to the volume. The framing is the recursive element here, although books such as Foundation's Robots and I Remember Rama keep appearing in the Library.\n\nAce 09273-X, May 1991\n\nDeChancie, John and Bischoff, David, Dr. Dimension\n\nDr. Demetrios Demopoulos is the archetypal mad scientist, complete with beautiful blonde female and a dull football-playing assistants (one each).

Heinlein was born 7 July 1907 and this would make it the 1980 Word Science Fiction Convention Noreascon 2, held in Boston, Massachusetts, not Texas.

The population's fears has caused them to be constructed with rules derived from ancient SF stories - the Three Laws of Asenion (Asimov). It turns out that a code of ethics is preferable in robots, as in organic beings, to a rigid set of programming rules. \"Asenion\" is a misreading of a sloppy version of the signature \"Asimov.\" It was a standing joke between Del Rey and Asimov. Asimov later incorporated the name into his Robot novels; Asenion robots are built with the Three Laws - no others have ever been built (see Asimov's The Caves of Steel for details).\n\nWorlds of If, November 1966 vol. 16 no. 11 (pp. 78-94)\n\ndel Rey, Lester, \"Vengeance is Mine\" [aka \"To Avenge Man\"]\n\nSam is a robot abandoned on the Moon while mankind destroys itself. However, Sam cannot believe that mankind did this and, based upon his reading of SF books, he decides that mankind was done in by alien invaders. He manages to return to Earth where he begins to built robots to avenge humanity. Over the eons the robots search the galaxy but find only bucolic civilizations and the ruins of technological ones. A long study of Earth reveals the truth but Sam suppresses it to allow the robots to still have a purpose.\n\nGalaxy 23:2 December 1956 (pp.156-194) [To Avenge Man]\n\nThe Ninth Galaxy Reader (edited by Frederik Pohl) Doubleday 1966; Pocket Books 1967; Gollancz 1967\n\nGods and Golems Ballantine 03087 February 1973\n\nThe Best of Lester del Rey 1978 Ballantine; New York: Ballantine 2000 0-345-43949-X\n\nThose Amazing Electronic Thinking Machines (edited by Isaac Asimov, Martin H.

However, it did not stop there as he made prediction after prediction and used them to prime his authors. Finally, he was arrested, tried in secret, and sentenced to prison for twenty years.
