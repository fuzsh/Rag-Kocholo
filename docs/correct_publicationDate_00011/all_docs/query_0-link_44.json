        "text": "It’s that time of year again. I decided that, before the revelry got too outta hand, I better get this list posted. Some of you might notice a few reoccurring entries from last year’s list. That’s because some of them are traditional yearly rereads and others just needed to be read yet another time, dammit.\n\nTake special note of the Gardner Fox historical adventure novels. The man has very quickly become one of my favorite historical authors. He totally delivers blood, passion and great storytelling. Howardesque with a solid dose of Sabatini. If only Gar had applied himself to the same degree in regard to his S&S novels…\n\nVarious books from the DMR stable appear below. That’s not out of some sort of “corporate loyalty”—though I do wish Dave would slacken my shackles just a bit and add just one Slim Jim to the bread and water he usually delivers to my cubicle… No, it’s because this has been a truly outstanding year, quality- and volume-wise, for DMR publications. “Skull-crushing” might be the term I’m looking for. I just call ‘em as I see ‘em.\n\nThe list below is comprised of all the books I remember reading or rereading in 2019. There is certainly the possibility that I've forgotten some worthy books I read earlier in the year. Rest assured that all of the books listed are ones I actually liked—books I didn’t like simply became one with the dust of forgotten ages. YMMV. Like before, the list is a mix of vintage and “just published yesterday” books. As always, please try to support small and independent publishers/authors, especially the ones who don’t hate you.\n\nIn general, I have tried to embed a link in each book title to the exact edition I read. That may not be so in some cases, however. Also, I'm not listing the books in any particular order, alphabetical or otherwise. More like, “Here’s the first bookstack. This is the top book on the bookstack.”\n\nI hope all our Readers of the DMR Blog have a great New Year and let’s look forward to a rockin’ 2020."
