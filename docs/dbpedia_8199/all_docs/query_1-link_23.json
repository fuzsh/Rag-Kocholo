This book of chess puzzles is intended for novice players who can already see simple mates and direct captures, but now wish to move up a level.\n\nThe book, containing 275 puzzles, begins with fairly simple tasks and ends with a set of puzzles that are somewhat more challenging.\n\nAll of the puzzles are provided with explanations to facilitate the understanding of what happened and the assimilation of tactical patterns.\n\nZenón Franco Ocampos was born in Asunción, Paraguay, on the 12th of May 1956. After living for many years in Buenos Aires, from the 1990s he has been based in Spain.\n\nHe was awarded the 2016 Isaac Boleslavsky Prize by the FIDE Trainers Commission in the ‘author’ section.\n\nIn 2016 the Honourable Chamber of Deputies of Paraguay awarded him the National Order of Community Merit, \"in recognition of his invaluable and meritorious contribution to Paraguayan sport, with a long and successful sports career in this discipline...\"\n\nIn 2001 he was named a “Beloved Son of the City of Asunción\", by the Municipality of his home town and in 2001 he received the decoration \"Honour to Sporting Merit\" in 2001, granted by the National Sports Council of Paraguay."
