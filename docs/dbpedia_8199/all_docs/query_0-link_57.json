Zach showed a keen interest in this project from its beginning. When we encountered what seemed to be an insurmountable hurdle thrown in our path by the bureaucracy of a State, he found a way for us to overcome it. I am indebted to Romina Akemi and Javier Sethness-Castro for accepting Zachâs invitation to write the Introduction to this volume. I am very grateful for the talented editorial hands first of Molly Toth, of Youngstown, Ohio, and then of Emma Young, of Bloomington, Indiana. My home institution, Youngstown State University, provided me with a Research Professorship to complete this project. I am most gratefulâand grateful everydayâfor the kindness, friendship, and love of my wife, Sarah V. Lown. These simple words of thanks to them leave much unsaid.\n\nÃngel Cappelletti, Biographical Note\n\nÃngel Cappelletti was born in 1927 and died in 1995 in Rosario, Argentina. This industrial port city was a major center of anarchist activities beginning in the late 19th century, when Italian immigrants formed a group called El Miserable. A little later, the anarcho-communist group Ciencia y Progreso was formed in Rosario, and the Italian anarchist paper Demoliamo, as well as the anarcho-feminist La Voz de la Mujer, edited by Virginia Bolten, were published there. In 1890 Bolten headed the first march ever held in Rosario to mark the 1st of May. She carried a red flag with this inscription in black: âFirst of May. Universal Brotherhood. We, the workers of Rosario, abide by the dispositions of the International Labour Committee in Paris.â Other anarchist papers published in Rosario at this time were La Verdad (1896), La Libre Iniciativa (1895â1896), La FederaciÃ³n Obrera (1896), and La Libera Parola. There were also general strikes in 1901 and 1907, as well as repression, persecution, and execution of militants. Ernesto âCheâ Guevara would be born in Rosario in 1928.\n\nCappelletti received a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Buenos Aires in 1954 and for the next twenty-seven years taught the history of philosophy, logic, sociology, Latin, Greek, and the history of political ideas at the Universidades de Cuyo y Litoral, Argentina, Universidad de Montevideo, Uruguay, and the Universidad Central y SimÃ³n Bolivar de Caracas, Venezuela. He is the author or editor of 40 books, including UtopÃ­as antiguas y modernas (Puebla, 1967), Abelardo (Buenos Aires, 1967), El Socialismo utÃ³pico (Rosario, 1968), Marco Aurelio (Buenos Aires 1968), La filosofÃ­a de HerÃ¡clito de Efeso (Caracas, 1969), IntroduciÃ³n a SÃ©neca (Caracas, 1973), IntroduciÃ³n a Condillac (Maracaibo, 1974), Cuatro filÃ³sofos de la Alta Edad Media (MÃ©rida, 1975), Etapas del pensamiento socialista (Madrid, 1978), El pensamiento de Kropotkin (Madrid, 1978), Ensayos sobre los atomistas griegos (Caracas, 1979), La teorÃ­a de la propieded en Proudhon (Madrid, 1980), Ciencia jÃ³nica y pitagÃ³rica (Caracas, 1980), Prehistoria del Anarquismo (Madrid, 1983), La filosofÃ­a de AnaxÃ¡goras (Caracas, 1984).\n\nThe present translation originally appeared as a Preface by Cappelletti to a volume of previously published anarchist writings by Latin American authors. The volume was conceived and begun by Carlos Manuel Rama. At the time of his death in 1982, Rama had completed an initial selection of the material. Cappelletti would conclude the project several years later. The volume was scheduled to appear in 1990 through the Venezuelan publisher Biblioteca Ayacucho. But due to several complications it did not appear in print until 1993. Rama was a Uruguayan historian and sociologist. Among his publications are: Historia del movimiento obrero y social latinoamericano contemporÃ¡neo (1967), SociologÃ­a de AmÃ©rica Latina (1970), Las ideas socialistas en el siglo XIX (1976), SociologÃ­a de AmÃ©rica Latina (1977), and La ideologÃ­a fascista (1979), among others.\n\nâGabriel Palmer-FernÃ¡ndez\n\nAbbreviations\n\nACAT AsociaciÃ³n Continental Americana de Trabajadores\n\nAFL American Federation of Labor\n\nAIT AsociaciÃ³n Internacional de Trabajadores (International Workersâ Association, IWA)\n\nALU AcciÃ³n Libertaria Uruguaya\n\nAPRA Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (Peru)\n\nCGS Centro Gremial Sindicalista (Ecuador)\n\nCGT ConfederaciÃ³n General del Trabajo (Argentina)\n\nCGT ConfederaciÃ³n General de Trabajadores (Chile, also Mexico)\n\nCOA ConfederaciÃ³n Obrera Argentina (Workers Confederation of Argentina)\n\nCOB ConfederaciÃ³n Obrera BrasileÃ±a\n\nCORA ConfederaciÃ³n Obrera Regional Argentina\n\nCNT ConfederaciÃ³n Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labor)\n\nCROM ConfederaciÃ³n Regional Obrera Mexicana\n\nCRRA ComitÃ© Regional de Relaciones Anarquistas (Regional Committee of Anarchist Relations)\n\nCTCH ConfederaciÃ³n de Trabajadores de Chile\n\nFACA FederaciÃ³n Anarco-Comunista Argentina (Argentinean Anarcho-Communist Federation)\n\nFAI FederaciÃ³n Anarquista IbÃ©rica (Iberian Anarchist Federation)\n\nFAU FederaciÃ³n Anarquista Uruguaya\n\nFCPM FederaciÃ³n Comunista del Proletariado Mexicano\n\nFLA FederaciÃ³n Libertaria Argentina\n\nFOA FederaciÃ³n Obrera Argentina\n\nFOCH FederaciÃ³n Obrera Chilena\n\nFOH FederaciÃ³n Obrera de la Habana\n\nFOI FederaciÃ³n Obrera Internacional (Bolivia)\n\nFOL FederaciÃ³n Obrera Local de la Paz (Bolivia)\n\nFORA FederaciÃ³n Obrera Regional Argentina (Argentine Regional Workers Federation)\n\nFORP FederaciÃ³n Obrera Regional Paraguaya\n\nFORP FederaciÃ³n Obrera Regional Peruana\n\nFORU FederaciÃ³n Obrera Regional Uruguaya (Uruguayan Regional Workersâ Federation)\n\nFOT FederaciÃ³n Obrera del Trabajo (Bolivia)\n\nIWA International Workersâ Association\n\nIWW Industrial Workers of the World\n\nPRC Partido Revolucionario Cubano (Cuba).\n\nPIT-CNT Plenario Intersindical de Trabajadores and ConvenciÃ³n Nacional Trabajadores\n\nUGT UniÃ³n General de Trabajadores (General Union of Workers)\n\nUSA UniÃ³n Sindical Argentina (Syndicalist Union of Argentina)\n\nUSU UniÃ³n Sindical Uruguaya (Syndicalist Union of Uruguay)\n\nPreface\n\nAnarchism emerged in Europe as an ideology and social philosophy during the first half of the nineteenth century. One of several kinds of pre-Marxist socialist thought, it was essentially a French product and owed its name and first systematic formulation to Proudhon, although it had two powerful predecessors in England and Germany, Godwin and Stirner, respectively. Prior to 1850 in France, as a social movement of the productive classes (workers, artisans, peasants), it assumed a mutualist form. Under Bakunin after the 1860s it appeared in a collectivist form and joined its activities to the First International, gradually becoming the dominant position within the movement. During these decades the majority of organized workers in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, and elsewhere either were anarchist or professed a closely related revolutionary socialism. Even trade unionism in Great Britain, though of moderate tendencies, was closer to Proudhon than to Marx.\n\nBy the 1860s anarchism reached Latin America and took root in a number of activist groups. Sections of the First International formed in the French Antilles; the ideas of Proudhon and Bakunin were disseminated throughout Mexico; and the first organizations of workers, peasants, and students with a libertarian bent were established there. In the 1870s there was a clear presence of anarchist groups on both sides of the RÃ­o de la Plata. For the next half century, anarchism enjoyed a steady even if often irregular history in many Latin American countries. It absorbed the major part of the working classes through unions and resistance societies for several decades in Argentina and Uruguay. In other countries, like Mexico, it played an important role in their political history and armed struggles. In Chile and Peru it sparked the revolutionary dimension of the working class struggle. There is no doubt that even in some countries whose later history failed to produce an organized and significant labor movementâsuch as Ecuador, Panama, and Guatemalaâthere were early workersâ organizations that went beyond simple mutual aid societies and carried forward the class struggle, and they were anarchist.\n\nThus anarchism in Latin America has an ample history rich in struggles peaceful and violent; in demonstrations of individual and collective heroism; in organizational efforts; in oral, written, and practical propaganda; in literary works; and in theatrical, pedagogical, cooperative, and communitarian experiments. That history has not been totally documented, although a few fine partial studies are available. Moreover, many writers of the social, political, cultural, literary, and philosophical history of the continent either ignore or downplay the important role of anarchismâthe result of ignorance or bad faith. Some historians do not know the achievements of anarchism or consider anarchism a marginal philosophy or totally undesirable. Others are aware of the significant role anarchism has played in the history of socialist ideas and understand its position towards Marxism well, but precisely because of that forget or belittle its role: a sign of their revolutionary immaturity, abstract utopianism, pragmatic or petty bourgeois rebelliousness.\n\nThis work does not pretend to be a comprehensive history of Latin American anarchism but simply a sketch of it. But the range of the material and the dearth of impartial studies available do prompt a sustained treatment of that history. Hence this work examines the social achievements, the popular writings, and the anarchist literature of each Latin American country from Argentina to Mexico.\n\nAs with other ideas of European origin, anarchist ideology was a product imported to Latin America. But ideas are not simply products. They are also living organisms and, as such, ought to adapt themselves to new environments; in so doing, they evolve in lesser or greater ways. To say that European immigrants brought anarchism to these shores states only the obvious. And to take that as a kind of weakness is plain stupidity. Like the very ideas of nation and of a nationalistic ideology, anarchism comes to us from Europe.\n\nAnarchism is not merely the ideology of the working and peasant masses who, arriving in the new continent, are robbed of their hopes for a better life and witness the exchange of oppression by the ancient monarchies for the no less brutal oppression of the new republican oligarchies. Soon some of the native and also indigenous masses adopt the anarchist view of the world and society, from Mexico to Argentina, and from Francisco Zalacosta in the Chalco to FacÃ³n Grande in Patagonia. It is seldom noted that the anarchist doctrine of self-managed collectivism has a close resemblance to the ancient ways of life and organizations of the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Peru, ways of life that were practiced prior to the imperialism of not only the Spanish, but also the Aztecs and Inca before them. To the extent that anarchists reached the indigenous, they did not have to inculcate exotic ideologies but only to make conscious the ancient peasant ideologies of the Matagalpan calpulli and the Andean ayllu.\n\nAt the same time, a tendency towards liberty and indifference towards all forms of statist structure was already present in the Creole population. When that tendency was not usurped by the ways of the feudal caudillos, it proved fertile soil for a libertarian ideology. Few mention the existence of an anarchist gauchaje in Argentina and Uruguay, or its literary expression in libertarian payadores. But those matters asideâundoubtedly they will be looked upon as having little consequence by academic and Marxist historiansâwithout hesitation we can say that anarchism took root much more deeply and extensively among indigenous workers than did Marxism, perhaps with the exception of Chile.\n\nIt is important to note that from a theoretical perspective, even if the Latin American movement did not make fundamental contributions to anarchist thought, it did produce forms of organization and praxis that were unknown in Europe. For example, the FederaciÃ³n Obrera Regional Argentina (FORA), a labor union that was majoritarian (becoming almost the only union), never conceded to syndical bureaucracy, and developed an organizational form as different from the ConfederaciÃ³n National del Trabajo (CNT) and other European anarcho-syndicalist unions as it was from the North American Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). A second example, typically Latin American, is the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM). Primarily through the efforts of Ricardo Flores MagÃ³n, within a few years of its founding it adopted an ideology that was unquestionably anarchist, nonetheless keeping its name while continuing as a political party, and thereby earning sharp criticism from some European orthodox thinkers like Jean Grave.\n\nWith the exception of that singular case, anarchism in Latin America is nearly always anarcho-syndicalism and is essentially linked to workersâ and peasantsâ organizations. To be sure, there were some anarcho-individualists in Argentina, Uruguay, Panama, and other places, as well as anarcho-communists, the latter foes of the syndical organization in Buenos Aires in the 1880s and 1890s. But the vast majority of Latin American anarchists were adherents of a revolutionary and anti-political syndicalismânot, as some say, a-political. That is an important difference between Latin and North American anarchism. An anarchist syndicalism was evident in the United States and its greatest witness was the sacrifice of the Chicago martyrs. It represented the continuation of the anti-slavery movement into the industrial context, and was promoted by Italians, Germans, and Slavic immigrants, with the German Johann Most as its revolutionary prototype. Later a revolutionary syndicalism emerged (anarchist or quasi-anarchist) among the working classes, organized through the IWW. There was also an earlier movement unrelated to the working classes, represented by important literary figures such as Thoreau and Emerson. Its predecessor is found in the liberal radicalism of Jefferson and other eighteenth century thinkers, and is perhaps represented today by what is known as âlibertarianism.â While it was not an anti-workersâ ideologyâalthough today there are Right-libertariansâit developed along lines quite alien to the struggles of the working classes, and its principal concerns include individual human rights, anti-militarism, and the abolition of bureaucracy and the State.\n\nBut anarchism developed in different ways in the various Latin American countries. In Argentina, FORA was sufficiently radical to be considered extremist by the Spanish CNT. In Uruguay it tended to be nonviolent, as Max Nettlau notes, perhaps because it was less persecuted, except during the last dictatorship. In Mexico it influenced government not only because of Magonist participation in the revolution against Porfirio DÃ­az, but also because La Casa del Obrero Mundial provided Venustiano Carranza his âred battalionsâ in the fight against Villa and Zapata, and because the leadership of the ConfederaciÃ³n General del Trabajo (CGT) engaged President ObregÃ³n in public political debates. In Brazil, on the other hand, it was always at the margins of the state, and the military-oligarchic republic did nothing but persecute, ostracize, or assassinate its leaders. A phenomenon common in several Latin American countries between 1918 and 1923 was anarcho-Bolshevism. Following the Bolshevik revolution many anarchists in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and especially Mexico supported Lenin and declared their unconditional support of the Soviet government, yet still considered themselves anarchists. With Leninâs death this trend disappeared. Those who still chose to follow Stalin no longer dared to call themselves anarchists.\n\nIn addition to a vast newspaper propaganda and extensive bibliography, anarchism in all Latin American countries produced many poets and writers who were among the most prominent in their respective national literatures. They were not, however, equally numerous and important in all regions. It is safe to say that in Argentina and Uruguay most writers publishing between 1890 and 1920 were at one time or another anarchists. Likewise in Brazil and Chile, where during this time there were more than a few literary anarchist writers, though not as many as in the RÃ­o de la Plata region. In Columbia, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico, if a properly anarchist literature did not fully flourish, the influence of a libertarian ideology was greater among writers and poets than in the workersâ movement. But even in those places where literature and anarchism were nearly synonymous, as in the RÃ­o de la Plata, anarchist intellectuals never played the role of elite or revolutionary vanguard, nor did they have any dealings with universities or official culture. In this respect anarchismâs trajectory differs profoundly from that of Marxism.\n\nThe decline of the anarchist movement in Latin America (which does not imply its total disappearance) may be attributed to three causes. First is a series of coups dâÃ©tat, mostly fascist, in the 1930sâUriburu in Argentina, Vargas in Brazil, Terra in Uruguay. All are characterized by a general repression of the workersâ movement, Left-leaning groups, and particularly of anarchists. In certain cases (e.g., Argentina) the state achieved the total dismantlement of the organizational and propagandistic structure of the workersâ anarcho-syndicalist federations. A second factor is the founding of communist parties (Bolsheviks). The support of the Soviet Union and of affiliated European parties gave them a strength sorely lacking in anarchist organizations, which had no other resources than the dues paid by their own militants. Some anarchists chose to join the communist party, more in some countries (Brazil) and fewer in others (Argentina). Finally, the emergence of nationalist-populist sentiments more or less linked to the armed forces and, in a few cases, with the promoters of fascist coups completes the factors that caused anarchismâs decline.\n\nThe unique situation of dependence in which Latin American countries found themselves with regard to European and, above all, North American imperialism caused the class struggle to be substituted by struggles for national liberation. Consequently, workers conceived of their exploitation as arising from foreign powers. The bourgeoisie, both domestic and foreign, together with various sectors of the military and the Catholic church, convinced them that the enemy was not Capital and State as such, but foreign Capital and State. Skillfully manipulated, this very conviction was the principal cause of the decline of anarchism. All else is secondary, even the intrinsic difficulties faced by anarchist organizations in the actual world, such as the need to make unions function without bureaucracy or the impossibility, real or apparent, of concrete proposals.\n\nIntroduction: Anarchism in Latin America by Romina Akemi & Javier Sethness-Castro\n\nAfter authoring dozens of books on classical Greek and anarchist philosophy, Ãngel Cappelletti dedicated his last monograph to a forgotten history of anarchism in the region. The publication of Anarchism in Latin America (El Anarquismo en America Latina) in 1990 coincided with important historical impasses such as the fall of the Soviet Union and the aggressive spread of neoliberalism. These events roused disillusionment about whether socialism was even still a viable option while, at the same time, frustration with austerity measures across the region catalyzed a revival of social movements after decades of military rule and civil wars. Cappelletti explains that his work is not intended to be âa comprehensive history of Latin American anarchismâ but to fill a gap in labor and revolutionary literature dominated by Marxist historians who either glossed over or erased the contributions of anarchists. Cappelletti did not live long enough to see the revival of anarchism across the region, in which his work became an important fixture in the arsenal of ideas for a new generation seeking tenets to aid their struggles for liberation and the coming of socialist revolution.\n\nCappellettiâs research covers the development of anarchism in the Americas, marking its origins in the mid-nineteenth century with the arrival of European migrants who brought with them ideas about socialist utopianism. The beginning of his chapters emphasize the role of the anarchist press in disseminating their ideas. The printed press is an obvious go-to in terms of archival research. But, at least in his description of Argentina, there is a sense that the press, literature, and popular poets were a prime force in spreading revolutionary prefigurative dreams among the popular classes. A combination of cultural and political language influenced the broader working class culture to embrace and familiarize themselves with the meaning of solidarity, mutualism, and autogestiÃ³n (or self-management), even if they were not militants or partisans faithful to those ideas. He spotlights the role of workersâ mutual aid societies in Venezuela and Mexico, some of which developed into prominent proto-syndicalist resistance societies, as well as numerous examples of anarchistic utopian experiments, such as the Cecilia colony (1890â1894), the Cosmos commune, and the potentially Tolstoyan Varpa community, all established in Brazil, to say nothing of the two utopian communities founded by Vasco de Quiroja in sixteenth-century Mexico, which strived to emulate Thomas Moreâs Utopia. Though Cappelletti acknowledges Robert Owenâs proposal (1828) to the Mexican government to establish a utopian-socialist colony in Texas, which remained merely abstract, he doesnât mention the Spiritual Franciscansâs earlier attempts to construct Christian communism with Nahua people in Mexico. He does focus attention on Plotino Rhodakanaty, the Greek anarcho-physician and missionary who founded several revolutionary collectivist organizations in Mexico after migrating there in the mid-nineteenth century with an eye to propagating Charles Fourier and Pierre-Joseph Proudhonâs social prescriptions. In this way, the two strongest currents in Latin America soon became anarcho-syndicalism and anarchist-communism; while individualism developed into a regional anarchist tenet over time, it played a less significant role in comparison to Europe or the US. The relationship with Iberian anarchism remains particularly close up to this day, partly due to the colonial legacy, but mostly due to language that facilitated the easy exchange of ideas. This connection was most felt during the Spanish Civil War (1936â1939), when many Cuban anarchists joined the CNT-FAI in resisting fascism, but particularly in light of the thousands of refugees who arrived to the continent after their defeat by the combined forces of Franco, Mussolini, and Hitler.\n\nCappelletti correctly highlights the role of European migrants as central in bringing revolutionary traditions to the continent but misses the opportunity to connect anarchism with the regionâs prior revolutionary traditions. Latin Americaâs regional characteristics, especially between 1860 and 1920, were more rooted in transculturation. In other words, Latin American anarchism, with all its regional variants, was the product of a confluence of local and exogenous ideas, practices, and realities, the combination of economic and political pressures produced by the regional nation-states and imperialist forces and the modalities of struggle from below to resist hegemonic power.\n\nWhy is Cappellettiâs Book Relevant for Anarchists in the United States?\n\nNational histories and languages influence how we think about political legacies and with whom we communicate. Residents of the US are bound to the Americas in terms of geography and migration, and due to the legacy of imperialism that rests heavily on its economic and military expansion over the region. US leftists tend to be influenced by European traditions thanks to the availability of English-language books and online resources, and the influence of a Western-centric education. However, with an ever-growing Latinx population, already a majority ethnic population in many US states, there is a growing group of bilingual speakers who also have regular communication with organizations south of the RÃ­o Grande. This heightens the need for US revolutionaries to become fluent in Spanish, and for the production and publication of more pamphlets and books either in Spanish or in bilingual form.\n\nThe power and violence relating to national borders and citizenship increases day by day. While heads-of-state expound nationalism and xenophobia in Latin America, the popular classes are bound together by colonial legacy and imperialist domination. It is not uncommon for a US citizen traveling in Latin America to refer to themselves as âAmericanâ and to be quickly corrected by a local that we, across the continent, are all Americansâyet only one country declares ownership. The reason for emphasizing this is to highlight two things: the need to challenge US exceptionalism in Left politics, and the reality that anarchist-communist revolution cannot succeed if only realized in one country.\n\nThe publishing of Cappellettiâs monograph by AK Press feeds a growing hunger by Latinx anarchists who want to read more about their history, and for gringo anarchists to become further acquainted with a history to which they are historically bound. This connection ranges from the role of US Wobbly seafarers in forming the IWW in Chile in the early 1920s to the case of MagÃ³n and the revolutionary-anarchist Mexican Liberal Party (PLM), based importantly in Los Angeles, California. The book is also a useful encyclopedic list of organizations and individuals to reference. It details some interesting political debates and challenges in organization-building. Too many books published about Latin America are geared toward a US audience, often emphasizing the continentâs exotic revolutionary character, focusing less on political theory and analysis. For example, the many books and articles published in the 1990sâand, in fact, still being published âhighlighting the image and word of Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos, thus downplaying the organizational form of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN). This was Marcosâs precise point in announcing his âdeathâ and subsequent resurrection as Subcomandante Insurgente Galeano, named after an EZLN support-base comrade who was murdered in a paramilitary attack on the La Realidad caracol in 2014: the mediaâs emphasis on spectacle ensured that the focus would be on Marcosâs style and appearance, based on his hegemonic and familiar European features, thus marginalizing the EZLNâs base and the rest of its leadership, which is comprised of Tsotsil, Tseltal, Châol, Zoque, Tojolabal, and Mam peoples. Since this announcement, the indigenous Subcomandante Insurgente MoisÃ©s has taken over the role of EZLN spokesperson.\n\nThus, while US-based anarchists have more familiarity with the European historical tradition, Latin America is where we can learn more about cross-race solidarity and organizing in both its positive implementation and its disastrous effects due to racism and patriarchy. This includes indigenous autogestiÃ³n, quilombo politics, and a regional common identity threatening the strength of national boundaries. Cappelletti does at times underscore the importance of certain figures such as Malatesta in Argentina or Fourier, Proudhon, and Mikhail Bakunin in Mexico, but their influence and ideas, while important guiding voices, were part of something larger than themselves during this time period. Also, rather than continually exoticizing Latin American figures, ranging from Clotario Blest to Flores MagÃ³n, without knowing their political opinions, we need to see these individuals too as participants in broader political movements.\n\nCuba, Mexico, Nicaragua: National Liberation, Anti-Militarism, Social Revolution\n\nThe extensive regional historical entries that Cappelletti shares in this volume contain multitudes of lessons, which resonate through time. Past anarchist efforts in Latin America continue to inform ongoing struggles on the continent, holding great promise for the prospect of global emancipation from capitalism, militarism, and authority. Given the historical weight of colonialism and neo-colonialism hanging over the continent, anarchism in Latin America has intersected critically with national-liberation and anti-militarist movements to present a social-revolutionary challenge to the oppression upheld by imperialists in conjunction with local elites. This dynamic brings to mind the luminous observation made by the Nicaraguan radical Augusto Sandino, that âonly the workers and peasants will go all the way, only their organized force will attain victoryâ for the social revolution. As anarchists, we are critical of the nation-state as either a stage or end goal for social liberation, but we nevertheless embrace the spirit of autonomous organizing against colonial oppression and the intersection of such proletarian-peasant unity with struggles for libertarian communism. With that in mind, weâd like to highlight important lessons for anarchists from the revolutionary national-liberation movements in Cuba, Mexico, and Nicaragua during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, struggles that persist to this day.\n\nAlongside Puerto Rico, Cuba was the last of the Spanish colonies in Latin America to gain formal independence, in 1902, four years after the end of the Spanish-American War, which saw the former colonial power replaced by US military occupation. Cappelletti stresses that Cuban anarchists participated enthusiastically in the national-liberation movement, anticipating a future liberated from the âcolonial authoritarian spirit and bureaucratic structure[s].â In this way, they echoed Bakunin and Alexander Herzenâs agitation in favor of Polish emancipation from tsarist domination, and Rhodakanatyâs participation in the 1848 Hungarian war of independence. In their struggle, the Cuban anarchists directly confronted racism in labor, opposed the neo-colonial stipulations of the Platt Amendment (1901), and organized numerous strikes among sugarcane workers and other proletarian sectors against the post-colonial State. Through the efforts of individuals such as Alfredo LÃ³pez and groups like the General Union of Industrial Fabric Workers and the Workersâs Federation of La Havana (FOH), together with a vibrant libertarian press, anarcho-syndicalism became the predominant ideology among the Cuban working class. While Cuban anarchists continued to organize workers and the oppressed after independence from Spain and the US, conflict with the Communists undermined their effectiveness. The Communistâs emphasis on the construction of parties led them, during the dictatorships of Gerardo Machado (1933) and Fulgencio Batista (1935), respectively, to actively disrupt strikes organized by anarcho-syndicalists. Such undermining of anarchist efforts, presaging the generalized repression after the 1959 Revolution, would prepare the way for its Stalinization, a development that echoed the fate of the Russian Revolution four decades prior. Indeed, throughout Latin America, the fate of the Russian Revolution considerably accentuated the differences between anarchists and authoritarian socialists, divergences that have resonated in the distinct tactics and strategies taken up by radicals on the continent since.\n\nShifting southwest, the Mexican Revolution (1910â1920) should be considered a national-liberation struggle of sorts, in light of the vast foreign control of land and resources that underpinned the Porfiriato, or Porfirio DÃ­azâs dictatorship (1876â1911), perpetuating the titanic social discontent that would explode during the upheaval. Indeed, collectivist anarchism and anarcho-communism had melded with indigenous autonomy in Mexico to propel the specter of a libertarian-emancipatory revolution, summarized by the slogan âÂ¡Tierra y Libertad!â (âLand and Freedom!â) This very slogan, in fact, was developed by Herzen and Bakunin through their collaboration with the Polish opposition, taken up and propagated by Ricardo Flores MagÃ³n and the Liberal Mexican Party (PLM) in their renowned newspaper RegeneraciÃ³n, and ultimately emblazoned in the program and banners of the Zapatista EjÃ©rcito Libertador del Sur during the Revolution. Whereas the PLMistas organized via networks of Clubes Liberales on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border and championed strikes and insurrections as the means to restore popular control over the fields, factories, and workshops, the revolutionary potential of the PLMâs vision was inhibited by the targeted imprisonment and martyrdom of its leading figures, including MagÃ³n and Praxedis Guerrero.\n\nIn contrast La Casa del Obrero Mundial (The House of the Global Worker), a syndicalist union founded in 1912 by some ex-comrades of MagÃ³nâs in Mexico City, represented a more âsuccessfulâ anarchist movement at the time. As La Casa faced immediate repression at the hands of the Huerta dictatorship that overthrew Madero in 1913, its membership anticipated Huertaâs defeat by the combined forces of Zapata, Pancho Villa, and the Constitutionalists. Yet geographical and cultural differences between the more rationalist anarchist workers and the indigenous-campesinx Zapatistas led the former to find affinity with the Constitutionalists. In fact, in 1915 La Casa made a fatal deal to support the latterâs counter-insurgent efforts by supplying troops for the Batallones Rojos that were used specifically against Zapata and Villaâs armies. In exchange, La Casa was allowed to organize labor freely, resulting in the establishment of numerous sections throughout the country. La Casa sealed the fate of the Revolution with this move, serving to disrupt the potentially emancipatory unity of proletariat and peasantry, as recognized by the PLM and Sandino alike, thus greatly facilitating the nationalist integration of labor into the post-revolutionary State.[12] Nonetheless, perhaps preserving a future hope for a profound social revolution uniting proletariat and peasantry, Cappelletti auspiciously clarifies that his research on the Batallones Rojos suggests that La Casaâs rank-and-file membership disagreed with the leadership over this fateful decision.\n\nUnfortunately, the 1979 Sandinista Revolution to depose General Somoza was similarly constrained by the insurgentsâ opting to seize state power rather than seeking its abolition. All this despite the fact that the FSLN (Sandinista Front for National Liberation) was named for the anarcho-syndicalist guerrilla Sandino, whose peasant army expelled the US Marines in 1933. Since that time, the nominally left-wing FSLN has struck deals with the far-right to prohibit abortion, advance free-trade agreements, and effectively become a brand that represents the interests of a small elite of families content with managing the âhacienda feudalismâ that the revolution had sought to abolish. Self-evidently, Sandinoâs emphasis on cooperative labor and his followersâ historical anti-dictatorial orientation retain all their relevance today.\n\nTaking a global view, we see that Cubaâs national-liberation struggle shares some similarities with those of South Asia and Algeria, considering the militant and, sometimes, anarchist network known as the Ghadar movement that was central to the resistance against the British Raj, giving rise to India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, and the widespread autogestion that arose in the fields and factories abandoned by French settlers in Algeria following its victory in the independence war. Whereas formal independence ultimately yielded despotic, centralized post-colonial power elites in Cuba and AlgeriaâCastro and the Communist Party and the Front de LibÃ©ration Nationale (FLN), respectivelyâas well as repression of the Kabyle minority and a brutal civil war between Islamists and the Algerian State, India since independence has vacillated between domination by neo-liberal parliamentarism and neo-fascist communalism, both of which perpetuate vast human suffering.\n\nVisibilizing Gender Relations\n\nWhile Cappellettiâs book is groundbreaking, it nevertheless overlooks the contributions by women in the development of Latin American anarchism. He does mention some anarchist-feminists by name, including the Argentine Virginia Bolten who was editor of the Rosario-based La Voz de la Mujerâthe only anarchist-communist newspaper dedicated to womenâs emancipation at the turn of the last century. However, there are major omissions, such as Luisa Capetillo, a central figure in the Puerto Rican labor movement, and Juana BelÃ©n GutiÃ©rrez de Mendoza, an anarchist journalist who joined Madero temporarily after MagÃ³n had her expelled from the PLM for being a lesbian, only to unite with the Zapatistas, co-author the Plan de Ayala, and serve as comandanta in the EjÃ©rcito Libertador. Yet, beyond individual female mentions, the overall analysis fails to weave in how these women contributed, the issues they emphasized, the challenges they faced, and how patriarchy affected solidarity and movement building. These issues and experiences cannot be separated from the history of anarchism.\n\nBeyond the purview of this book, we would like to use this opportunity to urge readers and future researchers to devote themselves to developing the history of anarchist-feminism and gender relations within the movement. In the period that this book covers, female anarchists were part of a larger current of revolutionary and militant women who defined themselves against the First Wave of middle-class and elite feminism that fought for suffrage. These women did not want political equality under capitalism, they sought revolution; they did not center their activism on charity and social uplift, but instead on autonomy and autogestiÃ³n. Some of the best theoretical and organizational contributions by anarchist women during this time were critiques about the family, support for free love, and the creation of mutualism and labor unions by and for women. In reviewing many writings in which these women are mentioned or were written about, we see two elements emerging: First, that many of these revolutionary-minded women across the globe were in communication with each other; second, they tended to suppress their gendered hardships for the good of the movement. In the case of Virginia Bolten, she was in direct correspondence with Emma Goldman and Louise Michel. The Chilean anarchist Flora Sanhueza owed a great deal of her political development to when she travelled to Spain in 1935 to subsume herself in the libertarian struggle. There is also the story of the Argentine anarchist Mika Feldman de EtchebÃ©hÃ¨re, who was active in Mujeres Libres and a captain in a POUM squadron. Even though there are many books that discuss the impact of the Spanish Civil War in Latin America, there are no studies on whether Mujeres Libres influenced the anarchist movement on the continent. In the article âBreaking the Waves: Challenging the Liberal Tendency in Anarchist-Feminism,â Bree Busk and Romina Akemi explain the difficulty in defining anarchist-feminism due to the lack of a historical narrative that describes its contributions within the movement rather than placing individuals on pedestals. There are also examples in Latin American anarchism of innate challenges to gender politics and patriarchy, in which the most striking cases emerged during the Mexican Revolution; a moment at which social order and gender expectations were in question. This ranged from the role by the soldaderas, also known as Adelitas, who challenged the masculine assumption of soldiering that was tied to citizenship, and individuals such as the Zapatista Amelio Robles who, assigned female at birth, emerged a colonel and recognized veteran for his role in the revolution. These histories are often treated as side stories, and we still struggle today to discuss them as examples that molded, guided, and influenced the politics of anarchism.\n\nIn the 60s and 70s, Latin America experienced continental revolutionary upheaval inspired by the 1959 Cuban Revolution and in reaction to growing economic crises. The second wave feminist movement that swept through Western countries had little resonance in the Global South, which was embroiled in national liberation movements and US sponsored military dictatorships. Women and queer militants in these revolutionary movements had minimal space to engage or discuss their political struggles and incorporate them into their organizational programs and praxis. In countries that fell under dictatorial rule, many social gains, especially those made by the working class, as well as indigenous and womenâs rights, were severely rolled back. According to the Chilean feminist Julieta Kirkwood, the military dictatorship was the embodiment of patriarchy. In the case of Chile, feminism grew from a social movement in the 1980s resisting Pinochetâs dictatorship. Feminists used their position as womenâperceived as the weaker and fragile sexâto create political space. Such scenes were repeated across the continent, especially by the mothers of the disappeared from Guatemala to Argentina who became symbols of political and feminist resistance. By the 1990s with the return of liberal democracies and the growing influence of anarchism, women began to openly discuss the pressures and labors of double-duty militancyâas members of their political or social organizations and, in addition, their feminist work. Issues that were once deemed âprivate mattersâ or âbetween couplesâ began to be discussed more openly. And by the mid-2000s a feminist movement was brewing that drew from womenâs past political experiences yet was informed by the present, embracing demands for the legalization of abortion and the end of femicide. Now it was up to their political and social organizations taking up the banner of feminism and sexual dissidence and supporting their demands as part of a prefigurative program. When a group of female members of the Chilean FederaciÃ³n de Estudiantes Libertarios (FEL), or the Libertarian Student Federation, decided in 2012 to organize an informal meeting to discuss patriarchal behavior within the student movement, rather than receiving support from their comrades, they were bullied and mocked. Such hostility motivated several of these women, along with male accomplices, to form La Alzada-AcciÃ³n Feminista Libertario in 2013. This example marks a historical shift within anarchism and feminism, when for most of the twentieth century, the formation of separate anarchist spaces by and for women was openly criticized. Instead of accusing anarchist feminists, queers, and sexual dissidents of dividing the movement, we should use the opportunity to challenge our own presumptions. As Latin American revolutionary feminists exclaim: âla revoluciÃ³n serÃ¡ feminista, Â¡o no serÃ¡! (âthe revolution will be feminist or it will not be!â).\n\nIs Anarchism an Ideology that Transcends the European Experience?\n\nThe question of whether radical ideologies such as Marxism and anarchism are European or white impositions that have no place in anti-colonial struggles or resistance among people of color is raised more in the US than in Latin Americaâbut nonetheless, it warrants engagement. Initially, we can say that anarchism shares little of Marx and Engelsâs enthusiasm for British colonialism in India or US victory in the Mexican-American War of 1848, respectively, regardless of the degree to which the former rethought his stance later in life after studying anthropology and history more closely. Though Bakunin doubtless was, like Proudhon, a vile anti-Semite, he consistently supported national-liberation struggles and stressed the importance of coordinated global revolution against all empires and despots: âBut states do not topple of their own accord; they can only be toppled by a multi-national, multi-racial, world-wide social revolution.â Additionally, his critique of Marxâs deterministic stages theory of history can be considered anti-racist in that it rejects the illogic that demands the full development of imperialism and capitalismâwhether in India, Mexico, or elsewhereâas a precondition for the flowering of communism.\n\nYet in parallel to the anti-Semitic associations he would make between Jews and political centralism, Bakunin subscribed to some rather questionable racialism, particularly in Statism and Anarchy from 1873, where he expounds his views on the German nation and Pan-Germanism, both of which he considered great centralizing threats, no doubt due at least in part to Marxâs expulsion of himself and his comrade James Guillaume from the First International. In this text, the anarcho-collectivist further expresses Sinophobia, worrying that China is âa threat by virtue of [its] numbers alone.â Bakuninâs caricatures about Germans being âintrinsically bourgeois and thereby statistâ are hence nearly as absurd as Engelsâs celebration of California having been taken by the white-settler State from the âlazy Mexicans [sic].â Nevertheless, Bakuninâs alarm over the âdangerâ supposedly âthreatening us from the Eastâ likely springs from a similar source as does Marx and Engelsâs chauvinism. Still, whether ironically or not, both Marxism and anarchism have inspired revolt and revolution in Latin America and much of the rest of the Global South. Cappelletti clarifies, however, that among radical Cuban workers of the late nineteenth century, â[n]o one speaks about Marx or Engels,â whereas Bakunin, Malatesta, Peter Kropotkin, ÃlisÃ©e Reclus, and Anselmo Lorenzo were âread and interpreted on a daily basis.â\n\nCappelletti premises his presentation by underlining the role of Spanish and Italian migrants in spreading socialist utopianism and anarchism in the mid- to late-nineteenth century. Anarchism has had a mass appeal in Latin America due to its ability to transcend and connect with material demands for autonomy and better living conditions, including those sought by indigenous peoples. More in passing, Cappelletti offers some examples in which indigenous communities viewed anarchism as either a useful tool for struggle or an ideology that complemented their own struggle for land and autonomy. For example, in his chapter on Peru he notes the attempt to organize the FederaciÃ³n Regional de Obreros Indios (Regional Federation of Indian Workers) in 1923. In Bolivia, he highlights the role of a châixi mechanic, Luis Cusicanqui, in keeping anarcho-syndicalism alive at a moment when Marxism was gaining ground among the working classes. In Brazil, the author identifies the quilombos established by former slaves as âindigenous precedents to the anarchist movement,â and in Mexico, Cappelletti points out the commonalities between anarchism and Zapatismo, though he underplays the specifically indigenous dimension of the latter movement, portraying it as primarily rural and campesino.\n\nThere are at least three issues with Cappellettiâs analysis that should be mentioned here. First, he begins his historical arch with Spanish, Italian, and Greek proselytizers of the faith as active subjects while indigenous and mestizo people are described as the objects who consume the faith. In various chapters, Cappelletti insists that anarchism was introduced throughout the region only through contact with Euro-American workers and migrants. For example, in the Brazil section, the author simply mentions how a Frenchman named P. Berthelot âmade contact with some indigenous tribes and attempted to promote libertarian organization among themâ in the early twentieth century. There is no explicit recognition of the neo-colonial dimensions of these or related relationships, including Owenâs proposal to establish socialist colonies in Texas or Giovanni Rossiâs acceptance of Emperor Pedroâs granting of land to the Cecilia colony. Second, the author mentions the Aztec calpulli and the Andean ayllu systems as being important foundations for political commonality, but does not clarify why those pre-Columbian governing systems complemented socialist utopianism. We presume that this is due to a shared emphasis on the importance of the commons, as is reflected in the overlap between Zapatismo and the PLMâs anarchism. Third, Cappelletti presents an over-idealization of the Aztec and Inka empires that does not take into account the oppressive role those empires played in colonizing and enslaving surrounding indigenous communities, though at times he does point out how the anarcho-agrarian revolts of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries echoed ancestral indigenous organizing practices against European and native imperialism alike. Although his points about endogenous and exogenous connections that defined Latin American anarchism were not fully developed in understanding indigenous and African influences, he nevertheless touches on a few historical threads and ideas about their confluence that need to be examined more closely by future researchers.\n\nMany historians have glossed over indigenous identities, emphasizing their class relationships instead and encompassing them in the larger category of peasant or urban worker, ignoring the reasons why indigenous communities supported land reform and where those reasons contrasted those of mestizo or criollo peasants. Identifying those disparate reasons does not minimize the material conditions that brought them together; this form of alliance building needs to be replicated more and not less. The Peruvian anthropologist Marisol de la Cadena explains how the Quechua paqo leader, Mariano Turpo, described this legacy: âFrom him I learned that indigenous utilization of class rhetoric was a political option that did not represent the loss of indigenous culture, but was rather a strategy toward its empowerment.â She learned that at times indigenous communities minimized their ethnic identity in their political slogans to create alliances or have broader appeal that could be read by some as de-indianization. Other times their cultural or ethnic identities were emphasized to gain ground or make certain claims to the state. Such intentionality to the outside viewer has often been misinterpreted as a progressive loss of identity or a Foucaultian submission to the state and its economic system, rather than calculated decisions. What appears as a growth of indigenous identities in Latin America beginning in the 1990s is actually the consequence of greater visibility by which these communities have been able to assert themselves in the public arena and make political demands to reclaim stolen resources and land, as well as combat against imposed political and economic systems from European to nation-state colonialism. Wingka anarchistsâto use the Mapuzungun termârooted by their experiences with national-liberation, have learned the need to support indigenous demands and become accomplices in their struggles. Liberation from capitalist oppression and imperialism will require alliances, trust-building, and respect for autonomy in many spheres.\n\nAutonomy and Ecology in Latin America\n\nThe environmentalist and ecological movements in Latin America have produced their own martyrs, including Chico Mendes and Berta CÃ¡ceres, Mariano Abarca, and Bernardo VÃ¡squez SÃ¡nchezâanti-mining organizers from Chiapas and Oaxaca, respectivelyâalong with countless others. Indeed, ecologists and land defenders have been singled out for repression at the hands of the state and private interests in Latin America, with hundreds of organizers killed annually in the past few years. The severity of such suppression reflects the fears of the ruling classes regarding the potential for autonomous indigenous, communalist, and anarchist movements engaging in radical ecological praxis: recovering and communizing the land, expropriating the expropriators, employing agroecology, abolishing or at least minimizing alienated labor, completely redistributing wealth and resources, redesigning the cities for collective living and sustainability, reducing pollution and productivism, halting economic growth, delineating biosphere reserves, and equilibrating the overall relationship between humanity and nature.\n\nAgainst such ends stand foreign and domestic capital and the state. Canadian capital, for example, owns between 50â70% of all mines in Latin America, and for this reason is responsible for vast environmental destruction and widespread human-rights abuses. In many cases, Latin American states facilitate these extractive ventures, or themselves greatly accelerate domestic extractivist projects. We see this in the âPink Tideâ countries of Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, and Uruguay that are pursuing a âTwenty-First Century Socialismâ that closely mimics neoliberalism. Such productivism in turn belies these statesâ claims to be environmental champions: while Brazil commits itself to the goal of âzero illegal deforestationâ by 2030, researchers project that the majority of Amazonian tree species will be extinct by mid-century at current rates of clearance. The Brazilian Labor Party has also encouraged the construction of hundreds of dams in the Amazon, with the most notorious being the Belo Monte mega-dam on the Xingu River, a project that would flood vast expanses of the rainforest, forcibly displace tens of thousands, threaten the survival of indigenous peoples, and affect peasants both in Brazil and regionally. The stipulation that nature or Pacha Mama has a right to be âcomprehensively respected,â as enshrined in the Ecuadorean Constitution since 2008, has not stopped petroleum extraction from the highly biodiverse YasunÃ­ National Park. For its part, the resistance of the US government to decriminalizing or legalizing drugs effectively perpetuates the power of the cartels, whose paramilitary-capitalist operations involve considerable environmental damage. Direct military support from the US for Mexican and Colombian counter-insurgency operations and its coordination of trade and investment throughout the hemisphere help maintain profits at the expense of the environment and society.\n\nLet us briefly consider revolutionary indigenous movements in Colombia and Mexico that represent dialectical inversions of the dominant, globally ecocidal, and thanotic trends. First, in southwestern Colombia, the Consejo Regional IndÃ­gena del Cauca (Regional Indigenous Council of the Cauca, or CRIC), is a collective organization of 120 indigenous council governments comprised of Coconuco, Nasa, Misak, TotorÃ³, AmbalueÃ±o, QuizgÃ¼eÃ±o, Heperara, and Inga peoples. Founded in 1971, the CRIC is engaged in the recuperation of the commons, the expropriation of privately-owned lands, the furtherance of cooperatives, the maintenance and expansion of indigenous government, resistance to megamines, organizing in favor of political prisoners, and advocating a popular and reconstructive resolution to the countryâs civil war. Similar to the repression faced by the EZLN, the seizure of lands by CRIC communards for purposes of communal subsistence often meets with direct military and paramilitary repression, particularly during days of collective labor. Paramilitary violence against organized indigenous-campesinx communities in Cauca seeks to clear the way for capitalist development, such that only the âthe dedicated and sincere organization, actions in solidarity, and struggle of all the oppressed social classes and sectorsâ can do away with âthe unhappy world of mineral and agro-industrial exploitation of the land and labor.â\n\nIn several states of southern Mexico, communal self-defense groups and autogestive processes have arisen in recent years to resist caciques (local bosses), the state, foreign extractive industries, and narco-traffickers alike. In Guerrero, the Regional Coordinator of Communal Authorities-Communal Police (CRAC-PC) has been defending indigenous communities from these forces for two decades, while in April 2011, women from the PâurâhÃ©pecha community of CherÃ¡n Kâeri, MichoacÃ¡n, rose up to overthrow the hegemonic drug cartels engaged in mass-deforestation, establishing an emancipatory Commune in the process. In 2013, autodefensas surged elsewhere in MichoacÃ¡n to resist societal domination by the Knights Templar cartel, leading President PeÃ±a Nieto to send the Army in to quell and disarm the revolt. Though these autodefensa brigades, some of whom explicitly organized in the model of popular security, achieved a great deal in a short period of time, many of them ultimately integrated into the state or the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, rivals to the Knights Templar. In contrast, in Ayutla de los Libres, Guerrero, home of several of the 43 students from Ayotzinapa who were forcibly disappeared in Iguala in September, 2014, the majority of neighborhoods and communities opted for autogestiÃ³n via popular assemblies during a vote in June 2017, thus exercising their right to associate according to indigenous âuses and customs,â rejecting electoralism. This right, recognized by the International Labor Organizationâs Convention 169, is hardly binding on states, being part of international law. Current events and the history of Latin America clearly reveal a systematic disregard from above for indigenous autonomy, human rights, collective liberation, and environmental balance. Within such a context, amidst the utter failure of capital and authority to address such radical demands, these hegemonic forces must be swept away so that the rest of us can get on with reorganizing society. Today, a hundred years since the Russian Revolution, the time is ripe for another global rebellion against capital and the state: another Mexican Revolution, a worldwide neo-Zapatista uprising.\n\nThe Re-Emergence of Anarchism as a Viable Current\n\nThis book follows on the heels of other books by AK Press concerned with the region, including the English translated editions of Horizontalism (edited by Marina Sitrin), Osvaldo Bayerâs classic Rebellion in Patagonia, and Juan Surianoâs Paradoxes of Utopia, among other publications. However, anarchist history and theory produced in Latin America, past and present, is extremely vast and difficult to detail. It should be noted that Cappellettiâs book marks the beginning of a reengagement with libertarianism after decades of its being overshadowed by Marxism. The 90s anarchist revival was more than a social movement phenomenon, as more people sought to revisit their anarchist predecessors once deemed âultra-leftistsâ or proto-communists, engendering new research by academics and worker-intellectuals alike.\n\nThe worldwide rebirth of anarchism in the 90s was spurred on by the failures by authoritarian socialism, exemplified in the fall of the Soviet Union, the aggressive spread of neoliberal policies disguised as globalization, and the breaking down of class identities that asserted individual identities and activism, as well as support for specific causes. There is a tendency to assume that these patterns manifested in the same way across the world as in the US. However, the overly-individualistic modality seen in US anarchist circles is not universal across the Americas, where anarchism remains a political ideology and not an individual identity or lifestyle. This is not to say that squats and communal living did not spread across the continentâthey did, especially in the early 2000s. Living together did not create de-facto prefigurative politics, but fighting together to demand housing and land rights was foundational. As Sitrin covers in Horizontalism, the deep economic crisis experienced in Argentina in the 90s impulsed many to organize and create new forms of social movement organizations that were rooted in autogestiÃ³n, becoming the living embodiment of popular power.\n\nCappellettiâs book ends around the middle of the twentieth century. For those unfamiliar with anarchist and autonomist organizing since then, we will offer some highlights. In his chapter on Uruguay, he notes the formation of the FederaciÃ³n Anarquista Uruguaya (FAU), founded in 1956. The FAU, after surviving state terrorism and dictatorship, proved influential in the development of organized anarchism across the southern region. FAU was founded by mostly Spanish anarchist refugees fleeing General Francoâs fascist forces who realized the need for a specific anarchist organization that they termed especifismo. Their social insertion work has centered on constructing autogestiÃ³n neighborhood centers and social insertion work in industrial unions constructing an independent militant class politic. For young libertarians seeking guidance on how to build an organized presence within their class, a pilgrimage to the FAU headquarters in Montevideo was imperative in the 90s and 00s. The FAUâs steady work with young anarchists in the neighboring Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul led to the eventual formation of the FederaÃ§Ã£o Anarquista GaÃºcha (FAG) in 1996. The FAG militants eventually influenced the formation of especifista groupings in Brazil, including the FederaÃ§Ã£o Anarquista do Rio do Janeiro (FARJ). During the FARJâs 2008 congress, the document âSocial Anarchism and Organizationâ emerged from their discussions about strategy, rooted in their current organizational and social movement experiences. They eventually joined efforts made by the Forum of Organized Anarchism (FAO) that evolved into the larger federative networkâCoordenaÃ§Ã£o Anarquista Brasileira (CAB)âthat includes locals from 11 cities. In the realm of anarchist stratagem to organize for revolution, the FAUâs main contributions were especifismo, while the FARJ, in discussion with other libertarian militants in Brazil, gave social insertion greater emphasis as a method of struggle to insert ourselves into the organizations and movements that are the best expressions of resistance by our class. Social insertion is both a commitment to those spaces to flourish into healthy organizations and, at the same time, a means to assert our core ideological principles as we fight for the hearts and minds of the working class.\n\nThe other region with an important organized libertarian network is Chile. The presence of anarchism within the labor movement from the 1950s to the 1990s is owed to syndicalists such as Clotario Blest, Celso Poblete, Ernesto Miranda, JosÃ© Ego-Aguirre, and Hugo CÃ¡rter. Ego-Aguirre and CÃ¡rter, older anarcho-syndicalists, influenced a group of young people in the 1980s that led to the foundation of the Hombre y Sociedad (Man and Society) newspaper that ran from 1985 until 1988, with financial support from anarchists exiled in Europe, including Nestor Vega and Urbano Burgos. From then on, other small publications emerged across the country, including El Ãcrata and AcciÃ³n Directa. The multi-generational formation associated with Hombre y Sociedad became an important confluence of experience and new ideas.\n\nAccording to the Chilean anarchist JosÃ© Antonio GutiÃ©rrez Danton, the 1990s can be described as âa virtual âboomâ of anarchist ideas and practicesâ and a ârediscoveryâ of anarchism as a historical current in Chile. In 1998 the publication of George Fontenisâs El Manifiesto Comunista Libertario sparked polemics among libertarian circles and helped consolidate those interested in forming an anarchist-communist organization, motivating a sector that were mostly punk rock anarchists to become serious political actors. The Congreso de UnificaciÃ³n Anarco Comunista (CUAC), founded in November 1999, was an important milestone for a new generation of libertarian revolutionaries attempting to expand their political work into various social sectorsâbolstered by their unity around a set of agreed-upon principles, in a single organization. CUAC was formed in the construction workers union hall, FETRACOMA, which also functioned as their headquarters. This proximity helped develop deeper bonds and integration with the labor movement. CUAC owes a greater deal of its political development to the Chilean Marxist organizations such as the Movimiento Izquierda Revolucionario (MIR) and the Frente PatriÃ³tico Manuel RodrÃ­guez (FPMR). CUAC played a key role in initiating discussions about the need for organized presence within the burgeoning student movement that led to the formation of the Frente de Estudiantes Libertarios (FEL) in May 2003. The CUAC split in 2003, leading to the formation of two currents: the OrganizaciÃ³n Comunista Libertaria (Communist Libertarian OrganizationâOCL) and the Corriente Revolucionaria Anarquista (Anarchist Revolutionary CurrentâCRA), while the FEL remained aligned with the OCL. The eventual explosion of a militant high school student movement in 2006, calling for free education, evolved into a well-strategized (yet very top-down) university student movement. The movement climaxed in 2011, and has assured anarchismâs ideological viability in Chile today.\n\nAnother important turning point in organized anarchism in Chile occurred in 2013. A sector within OCL and FEL called Red Libertaria (Libertarian NetworkâRL) who âfirmly and enthusiastically joined the âTodos a la Monedaâ (Everyone to La Moneda) platform, whose candidate was Marcel Claude.â In an article penned by GutiÃ©rrez Danton and Rafael Agacino, they underscore, âBut it was not only the decision itself to participate in an election that produced this seismic reaction within the Chilean libertarian movement; it was the manner in which the decision was made,â especially the secrecy by a sector within OCL and FEL that left many of their comrades dumbfounded and feeling betrayed. Those who questioned the creation of RL and a move toward electoralism were expelled, sparking resignations. The expelled grouping, along with other collectives and individuals not associated with OCL, organized the Communist Libertarian Congress over the course of two years that led to the founding of Solidaridad-FederaciÃ³n Comunista Libertaria (SolidarityâCommunist Libertarian Federation) in January 2016.\n\nThis organizational split placed the FEL in a difficult position when anarchists gained the presidency of the Chilean University Student Federation (FECH) with their candidate Melissa SepÃºlveda, a feat not accomplished since the 1920s. A decision was made to postpone the FEL split until the end of SepÃºlvedaâs term. SepÃºlveda, who ran on an explicit feminist and anarchist platform, was a political departure from Camila Vallejo, a Communist Party member and FECH president in 2011 who received international attention. SepÃºlveda publically supported student-worker alliances and autonomous organizing amongst the working class. At the end of her term in April 2015, SepÃºlveda, along with other FEL dissidents who opposed the electoralism move, founded AcciÃ³n Libertaria (Libertarian ActionâAL).\n\nWhile authoritarian dictatorships claimed the lives of thousands in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, Mexicoâs âDirty Warâ of the 60s and 70s saw the full repressive power of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) directed against leftists, youth, organizers, and the landless peasantry in the wake of the Tlatelolco massacre of October 2, 1968. The State murdered hundreds of students in Mexico City that day, and the PRI forcibly disappeared and extrajudicially executed thousands more as part of its counter-insurgency strategy to suppress the generalized societal outrage provoked by the same. The EZLN itself was founded in 1983 as a union between landless indigenous Chiapanecxs and urban-based mestizo and European-descended militants from the Fuerzas de LiberaciÃ³n Nacional (FLN), which had been created in 1969 âmuch as the ten-year Colombian civil war known as La Violencia, which claimed thousands of lives catalyzed the founding in 1964 of the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and the ELN (National Liberation Army). The neo-Zapatista insurrection on January 1, 1994, proclaimed a radical halt to the ceaseless ethnocide targeting indigenous peoples since the Spanish conquest. The rapid response of domestic and international civil society to the uprising limited the intensity of direct repression by the Mexican Army, resulting paradoxically in the PRIâs resorting instead to employing paramilitary terror against Zapatista support-bases and Zapatista-sympathizing communities in Chiapasâa strategy that continues to this day. Following the inevitable breakdown of negotiations with a racist state failing to observe the San AndrÃ©s Accords (1996), the EZLN focused intensely on furthering communal autonomy by strengthening the participatory alternate institutions that comprise the movement. These insitutions, including cooperatives, autonomous education, the public health sector, and popular assemblies, exist alongside the military structures. This project of autonomy advanced importantly in 2003 with the announcement of the Good-Government Councils (JBGâs), comprised of delegates, sometimes as young as adolescents, who rotate in the administration of the five regions of Chiapas where the EZLN has a presence.\n\nHence, while it is true that the EZLNâs initial uprising sought to inspire a regional or country-wide revolution to take over the stateâwith the Zapatistas hoping to march on Mexico City and liberate it once againâthe neo-Zapatista movement has distinguished itself from other Latin American guerrilla struggles by the anti-electoralism and anti-statism that has defined the development of its autonomy. A decade ago, the EZLN launched La Otra CampaÃ±a as an effort to unite a nation-wide anti-authoritarian left alternative to political parties and the state amidst the ongoing battle for power between the right-wing National Action Party (PAN) and AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, the social-democrat candidate, in the 2006 elections. In parallel, la Sexta DeclaraciÃ³n de la Selva Lacandona (Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle [2005]) proudly declared the movementâs autonomy in search of a new constitution that would meet its original thirteen demands.\n\nYet now, after having championed autonomous social organization as a viable alternative for over a decade, the EZLN joins its comrade-representatives from the National Indigenous Congress (CNI) in endorsing the proposal for an Indigenous Government Council (CIG) and in presenting the Nahua traditional healer MarÃ­a de JesÃºs âMarichuyâ Patricio MartÃ­nez as CIG spokesperson, councilor, and candidate for the 2018 presidential elections. The CNI describes this move as âgoing on the offensive,â and it paradoxically claims not to want to administer power but rather to dismantle it. Since the announcement, Marichuy and comrades have stressed that the focus is not on the ballot but rather âorganization, life, and the defense of territory.â Yet the conclusion of the Fifth CNI in early 2017 is clear: the CIG is meant to âgovern this country.â It remains to be seen how this move will play out, and how it will affect the Zapatista movement and autonomous indigenous movements elsewhere in Mexico and Latin America. We imagine that this shift toward electoralism is being met with a degree of resistance within Zapatista ranks, particularly among the youth who have been raised with the JBGâs and la Sexta.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank by name several comrades across the Americas who contributed to this introduction: JosÃ© Antonio GutiÃ©rrez D. and Pablo Abufom S. for their useful input about the history of contemporary organizations in the Southern Cone; Lorena Mans and Bree Busk whose anarchist-feminist contributions make us all better militants and more accurate writers; Joshua Savala, whose historical analysis is informed by his everyday praxis, and who can be counted on for his historical knowledge and attention to detail; also Scott Nappalos, who will ensure that our platformism does not overshadow the contribution of anarcho-syndicalists; and finally, all those in Latin America who, past and present, make anarchism a viable option and this revolutionary dream not only possible, but necessary.\n\n[12]] See Ricardo Flores MagÃ³nâs caustic portrayal of the arrangement in Act IV of the play âTierra y Libertad,â in Obra Literaria: Cuentos.

Utopian Socialism\n\nUtopian socialism is a designation commonly carrying a pejorative meaning in Marxist literature and is considered a precursor to anarchism. But we must recognize that it is a precursor to Marxism as well. During the dictatorship of Juan Manuel de Rosas (1829â52), Eugenio Tandonnet, a Fourierist, visited Buenos Aires. He got along just as well with that bloodthirsty feudal ruler as with the liberal Domingo Sarmiento, future president, whom he met on board a ship en route to Europe. Even though the latter seemed to have understood and appreciated the French journalistâs politics, the dictator doubtless considered them insane, as De Angelis, his biographer, would later say.\n\nThe ideas of Saint-Simon, Leroux, and other utopian socialists had already influenced the Generation of â37 and Esteban EchevarrÃ­a, who referred to them in his Dogma socialista. Their ideas entered the pages of La Moda, the weekly publication run by Juan Bautista Alberdi and Juan MarÃ­a GutiÃ©rrez. The term socialismo itself, meant to describe a âtendency towards sociability and humanitarianism,â was used for the first time in the RÃ­o de la Plata region during the Rosas era.\n\nIn all of Latin America, utopian socialism had no greater influence on the leading Romantic writers than in Argentina. But while it is important to note this, for obvious reasons we must put aside the examination of that ideological movement here.\n\nBetween this early period and the organization of workers brought about by the First International, we should mention the little known figure of the Balearic printer BartolomÃ© Victory y SuÃ¡rez, who âarrived in Argentina around 1860 already with a history of engagement in social struggles.â He was associated with freemasonry; served as editor of La RepÃºblica (journal of the Bilbao brothers) and as director of La CrÃ³nica del Progreso and Revista masÃ³nica americana; and was the translator, as well as commentator, of Cabetâs El comunismo, although he made clear that he was not partisan to the âmonastic system.â His humanistic socialism was influenced by Fernando Garrido, and the latterâs exposition of Rochdaleâs experience greatly interested him.\n\nB. Beginnings of Anarchist Propaganda, 1871 to 1889\n\nRefugees from the Paris Commune began to arrive in 1871. Some of them were anarchists, such as Gobley, who had been imprisoned in Quelern along with the illustrious geographer ÃlisÃ©e Reclus. After brief stays in Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo he settled in Buenos Aires in 1878. Vladimir MuÃ±oz recounts that in 1885 V. Mariani distributed Le RevoltÃ© in the Argentinean capital and notes that on July 15, 1887 that journal, founded in Switzerland by Kropotkin, published the following note: âThe anarchist group of Buenos Aires meets every Wednesday at eight oâclock in the evening in the CafÃ© Turco on Serrito Street on the corner of Cuyo.â Before this, a public gathering in solidarity with the martyrs of Chicago had attracted some 350 persons. On March 18, 1888 anarchists celebrated the anniversary of the Paris Commune in the headquarters of the social democrats of Buenos Aires, with six of the eventâs organizers arrested by police.\n\nIn these early years anarchist books and pamphlets frequently arrived in Buenos Aires from Spain, Italy, France, and other places. For example, the Belgian Emile Piette received a parcel with a dozen copies of Kropotkinâs Words of a Rebel. In 1889 Piette served as courier for a sum of money sent by a group of Chilean anarchistsâWashington Marzoratti, Alfred MÃ¼ller, Bernard Bouyre, SalamÃ³n y Primâto assist the already famous libertarian champion Le RevoltÃ©. Meanwhile, some early local groups were beginning their own written propaganda. And the Catalan carpenter Juan Vila in Buenos Aires was at work on his translation of Kropotkinâs The Conquest of Bread.\n\nDuring this early period of anarchist propaganda in Argentina members of a few French and Italian groups stand out for the vigor they brought from their home countries to the libertarian workersâ movement. Several of them retained their militancy for many decades, such as A. Sadier, who died on March 8, 1936; others were active for shorter periods of time, such as F. Denambride, who after 1887 tried to spread anarchist ideology in the province of Santa Fe. A few Italian anarchists from the same native town or region formed groups and then with missionary zeal reached deep into national territory settling in agricultural or manufacturing centers to spread the good news of libertarian socialism. Thus Italian militants originally from Isola Dovarese, where a group had formed under the name I Ribelli, set out to the industrial port city of Rosario and established a group called El Miserable. An anonymous French militant arrived in Azul, a city in the province of Buenos Aires, and was able to bring together anarchists and other similar groups into a single association. ]\n\nCoordinated action got a boost in the 1870s. An initiative by the Central Committee of the International Workingmenâs Association to establish a section in Buenos Aires was warmly supported by a group of Spanish workers and promptly implemented by them. In September 1872, during the Hague Conference, news arrived of the existence of internationalist workersâ groups in Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina. A letter dated March 23, 1873 reads:\n\nThere are presently three sections of the International in Buenos Aires, based on the various languages: the French section, the Italian and Spanish sections that formed later; each section has its own central committee and matters of general interest are addressed by a federal committee of six members, two from each section.\n\nThe letter was signed by A. Aubert, then general secretary of the International in Buenos Aires, and reveals the enormous difficulties the project encountered in founding a section, specifically mentioning âthe persistent attacks by the press.â\n\nSoon enough ideological differences reflecting divisions in the international workersâ movement emerged in the very heart of the Argentinean section. In Buenos Aires disputes between âauthoritariansâ (Marxists) and âantiauthoritariansâ or âfederalistsâ (anarchists) were evident from the start.\n\nWe will soon see that in the French section the authoritarians dominated, rather puzzling when one bears in mind that Proudhonism was then the majority position in the metropolitan workersâ movement; while Bakuninist ideas had always aroused the greatest following in the Italian and Spanish sections. Nonetheless, the authoritarian minority was able to impose the ideological tone of the Argentinean section, as we can surmise from a letter by F. C. CalcerÃ¡n, secretary of the Uruguayan section, to his Mexican comrades on May 25, 1872: âWe are preparing a newspaper that will be called El obrero federalista to fight the authoritarians who have set up camp in Buenos Aires.â In a subsequent letter of January 1, 1873 addressed to the same group, CalcerÃ¡n clarified who the âauthoritariansâ were: âWe inform you and the section you represent that a group of French citizens in Buenos Aires has formed a section of the International representing the antidemocratic spirit of the Central Committee in London.â It thus appears that the members of the French sectionâundoubtedly the least numerous of the threeâwere in line with the politics of Marx and his allies. Perhaps they were Marxists. But given that Marxism was hardly present in France during this time, one can well suppose they were Blanquists, who had joined the Marxists in the Congresses of the International. In any event, after 1876 the âantiauthoritarianâ Bakuninists dominated. In an article published in the Almanaque Socialista de La Vanguardia (1898), JosÃ© Ingenieros wrote that âa Bakuninist Center of Workersâ Propaganda has been established with the almost exclusive purpose of combating the Marxists.â\n\nIn early 1879 El Descamisado appeared in Buenos Aires, considered by some the âfirst anarchist newspaperâ in Argentina. We know from Max Nettlau that it was âvery primitive in its conception of ideas,â a âbit vague and confused.â Perhaps on that account the title of that newspaper, and perhaps also its viewpoint, were echoed by the Peronist press seventy years later.\n\nThe incipient anarchist movement in Argentina began to lose its vitality and by the 1880s seemed nearly extinguished. It did not take long, however, for it to regain full strength as a consequence of the enormous European immigration to Argentina and many regions of its interior. Oved writes:\n\nFrom 1880 to 1914 massive waves of immigrants flowed into Argentina totaling 3,034,000 people, an important factor in the impressive growth of the population, from 2,492,00 inhabitants in 1880 to 7,855,000 in 1904. A direct result of this massive immigration was that in 1914 one third of the total population consisted of foreigners and the percentage of immigrants in the total population was the highest in the world.\n\nThis very unusual demographic phenomenon proved decisive for the history of anarchism and the workersâ movement in Argentina. As SantillÃ¡n puts it, the main source of growth âcame from the immigration of numerous internationalists persecuted in Europe who were able to make the most out of the harshness of the struggle for existence among the popular masses.â\n\nIt is important to remember the work of some of these internationalists. In 1880 HÃ©ctor Mattei arrived in Buenos Aires. An Italian militant, in 1887 he began to publish an anarcho-communist weekly along the ideological lines of Errico Malatesta, El Socialista: Organo de los Trabajadores. According to Mattei, a group of Italian workersâamong whom he names Marino Garbaccio, baker; Washington Marzoratti, engraver; and Miguel Fazzi, cabinet-makerâfounded an anarcho-communist group in June 1884 with the objective of engaging in public discussions on the âsocial question,â and made available some of the anarchist papers from Europe free of charge. Several Spanish immigrants who were more inclined to the collectivism of Bakunin than the communism of Kropotkin and Malatesta, among them Francisco Morales and Feliciano Rey, also joined the propaganda efforts at this time. The native anarchist press began to grow and to gain vigor. Between May 2 and September 28, 1884 La Lucha Obrera was published in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn February (or March) 1885 to avoid another imprisonment the already famous revolutionary Ericco Malatesta, in an incredible episode, fled Italy inside a crate of sewing machines. His destination was Buenos Aires. Mattei wrote the following in the September 1, 1909 issue of La Protesta:\n\nCommunist and anarchist propaganda intensified when, after two or three months of the arrival in Buenos Aires of our comrade Malatesta, a CÃ­rculo de Estudio Sociales was formed with great enthusiasm, located in 1375 BartolomÃ© Mitre Street, where Malatesta and other comrades gave the first communist anarchist public speeches, later published in Italian in La Questione Sociale. In the following years other circles and clubs of âestudios socialesâ were formed, some of them communist anarchist.â¦ In 1887 Errico Malatesta cooperated with other anarchist comrades in the permanent organization of the Sociedad Cosmopolita de Obreros Panaderos, giving speeches at their meetings.\n\nIn 1886 Malatesta set out on a journey worthy of being narrated by his compatriot Emilio Salgari: the search for gold in the vast Patagonian deserts captured from indigenous peoples several years earlier by the Argentinean army. His purpose was to gather funds to promote libertarian propaganda and to assist workersâ organizations in their revolutionary activities. So, along with four comrades he settled in a cabin above Cabo Virgenes, preceded by a party with tools and other necessary supplies.\n\nFor a few weeks they lived on seafood, and then returned to Buenos Aires empty-handed. By midâ1889 Malatesta was en route back to Europe, returning not with the gold he had hoped to find but with the satisfaction of having organized the first workersâ unions and planted the seeds of a great movement of anarchist workers in Argentina which, a few years later, the Valencian novelist Blasco IbÃ¡Ã±ez would call the âpeopleâs land.â\n\nAccording to the German Marxist Augusto KÃ¼hn, between 1887 and 1888 a group known as CÃ­rculo socialista internacional, dominated by Spanish and Italian anarchists, would meet in CafÃ© Grutli (on Cerrito Street, between BartolomÃ© Mitre and Cangallo streets). Once again libertarian ideology, particularly in its Kropotkian and Malatestian visions, prevailed in the majority of groups within the Argentinean proletariat. But as the 1880s come to an end a new crisis emerged. As KÃ¼hn observed, the groups that had sprung up like mushrooms on the plains of the Pampas now split and reconvened only âto wage an implacable war against the recent socialist organization (i.e., Marxist).â This constant battle between anarchists and Marxists culminated, SantillÃ¡n says, âin oratories of epic proportions in the period of Pietro Gori.â But polemics in Argentinean anarchism hardly rose to what was then common in Spain.\n\nC. 1890 to 1896\n\nMarxists of the VorwÃ¤rts group sent Professor Alejo Peyret as a delegate to the 1889 International Socialist Congress in Paris, and convened a political rally in the Prado EspaÃ±ol in Buenos Aires with the objective of founding a workersâ federation and a Spanish newspaper to articulate the ideas and aspirations of the working class. Anarchists were also reorganizing their existing groups and starting new ones that will later show great determination, for example, Los desheredados. In the January 22, 1909 issue of La Protesta, M. Reguera recounted the prodigious propagandist activity of Los desheredados:\n\nLet us summarize the first deeds of that handful of fighting enthusiasts: initiation of continuous and simultaneous speeches in three or four places distant from each other; uninterrupted publications of violent and provocative manifestations of combat and actionâ¦ The speeches given by two or three orators would follow each otherâ¦ It was not rare to announce, for example, a speech at two oâclock in the afternoon in Almagro, another an hour later in Corrales, a third one at four oâclock in Barracas, and a fourth one in the city square at night. For all of this two and sometimes one orator would carry out the program with precision and punctuality. The outstanding orator of that period was comrade Rafael Roca.\n\nRoca, who died prematurely, had edited the initial âManifestoâ of El Perseguido, in which he articulated the meaning of anarcho-communism. That manifesto led to severe political repression and the confiscation of a number of issues of the newspaper that, precisely for that reason, was called El Perseguido. In spite of all the persecutions it published more than one hundred issues and was available from May 18, 1890 until the last weeks of 1896. The fruit of the enthusiastic and heroic labor of a small group of militants, it can be considered the most representative libertarian publication of the period. Its first page gave the following warning: âPublished when possible.â Oved observes:\n\nThe problems were abundant, the members of the group edited, printed, and distributed the paper; distribution was accomplished in clandestine conditions and with grave risks. It was delivered in the streets, in workersâ neighborhoods, in gatherings, by mail, and sometimes surreptitiously placed inside issues of La Prensa.\n\nPropaganda was not limited to the national capital. During these same years the Italian anarchist paper Demoliamo and the anarcho-feminist La Voz de la Mujer, edited by Virginia Bolten, were published in Rosario.\n\nIn addition to Roca and Mattei, active militants during this period also included the Belgian bookseller Emile Piette, the painter Ragazzini, the Spanish worker Victoriano San JosÃ©, the French journalist Pierre Quiroule, the Catalan Inglan LaFarga (later an editor of La Protesta), Manuel Reguera, Fortunato Serantoni, Juan Vila, F. Denambride, Espinosa, Lacour, Reaux, and the writer Orsini Bertani, who was the editor of Barrettâs work, and in later years during his residency in Montevideo was a proponent of that current of thought then known as anarcho-Batllism. Also during this period two notable anarchist physicians began their popularizing work: Dr. Creaghe in LujÃ¡n and Dr. Arana in Rosario, both magnificent and overlooked examples of the Latin American professional committed to the people. As SantillÃ¡n notes, âThe salient character of the movement in this period is the aggressive, enthusiastic, and proselytizing fever that did not back down from any sacrifice.â\n\nThe first important polemic within the Argentinean anarchist movement occurred during the 1890s. On the one hand, the anarcho-communists of El Perseguido showed themselves to be enemies of all organization that transcends affinity groups, and in particular opposed the creation of anarchist syndicates. On the other hand, those called âanarcho-socialists,â whose organs were Serantoniâs La Questione Sociale and Dr. Creagheâs El Oprimido and were in contact with Malatesta and the dominant tendency of the Italian movement, supported the creation of resistance societies and anarchist syndicates. In the midâ1890s the latter group, which responded equally to the example of Malatesta from the previous decade and to the thought of Kropotkin, came to comprise an ample majority of the workersâ movement. The Kropotkian view of La RÃ©voltÃ© was represented by Pierre Quirouleâs newspaper La LibertÃ©, for which the later celebrated Auguste Vaillant would write during his residence in Argentina. Quirouleâs La LibertÃ©, though partisan to workersâ organizations, favored propaganda by the deed and, like El Perseguidoâfrom which it differed by a more theoretical and doctrinaire attitudeâdefended all anarchist attentats, then much in vogue, but more frequent in Europe than in Argentina. Yet in Rosario, the anarcho-communist group Ciencia y Progreso, apparently influenced by Dr. Arana, had since 1896 opposed terrorism as a tactic and even as a rhetorical trope.\n\nD. 1897 to 1910\n\nAn organizational tendency favorable to the syndicalistâs struggle in Argentinean anarchism clearly asserted itself during this period. Anarcho-communist groups, which had predicted an immediate social revolution and rejected all forms of syndicalism as either an obstacle or a trap set by social democrats, by 1905 had waned to the point of near extinction.\n\nStrikes and other workersâ struggles were abundant in 1896, yet anarchist intervention was limited, according to the chief of police of Buenos Aires, Manuel Campos. Things changed the following year, however. In 1897, both as effect and cause of the growing anarchist presence in the struggles of Argentinean workers, La Protesta Humana was founded, the most important and enduring anarchist newspaper in Latin America. Its pages reflected not only the turbulent trajectory of the libertarian movement, but also the entire history of the Argentinean workersâ syndicalism from a point of view that is at once revolutionary, ethical, socialist, and libertarian. According to Fernando Quesada:\n\nDuring its long life it survived all the alternatives; overcame all internal crises that destroyed a large part of the movement; absorbed all challenges and provocations. Neither state persecutions nor ideological disagreements between brothers were able to blunt its cutting edge. â¦ It was born to overcome all calamities.â\n\nThe inaugural issue hit the streets on June 13, 1897. Its first editor was the Catalan carpenter Gregorio Inglan Lafarga; its first administrator, the Italian baker Francisco Berri; and among its first collaborators were JosÃ© Prat, Eduardo GilimÃ³n, and Mariano CortÃ©s, later joined by well-known literary figures of the time, for example, Florencio SÃ¡nchez, Pascual Guaglianone, Julio Camba, and Santiago Locascio. After November 7, 1903 the journalâs title was shortened to La Protesta. A group of collaborators and sympathizers headed by Dr. Creaghe were successful in obtaining a proper printing press, first used on March 5, 1904 for issue number 253 of the paper. A few weeks later, on April 1, it became a daily publication. Its first daily issue contained the following remark: âThe importance of this publication to the world of laborers is so great that it is difficult to measure. It affirms the anarchist personality in Argentina.â The editorship went first to Elam Ravel and then Alberto Ghiraldo, with whom prominent literary figures like Julio R. Barcos, Edmundo Biachi, and JosÃ© de Maturana collaborated.\n\nOn March 7, 1910 Argentinean anarchists started a second daily paper, La Batalla, published in the evenings, with the dramatist Rodolfo GonzÃ¡lez Pacheco and the journalist Teodoro AntillÃ­ as principal editors. Their accomplishment clearly shows the vitality of the movement at this time. Anarchist newspapers in Spanish, Italian, and French flourished everywhere, not only in Buenos Aires but also in the interior of the country. Nettlau gives us a list: in Buenos Aires, in Spanish La RevoluciÃ³n Social (1897), Ni Dios ni amo (1896), Ciencia Social (1897â1899), Germinal (1897â1898), El Rebelde (1899â1902), Los Tiempos Nuevos (1900), Vida Nueva (1903â1904); in Italian, Lavoriamo (1893), La Nuova CivilitÃ¡ (1901), Venti Settembre (1895â1903); in French, Le Cyclone (1895). And in the interior of the republic: in Rosario, La Verdad (1896), La Libre Iniciativa (1895â1896), La FederaciÃ³n Obrera (1896), and La Libera Parola; in La Plata La AnarquÃ­a (1895), in Barracas, El Revolucionario (1895), and in Chilcoy, La Fuerza de la RazÃ³n.\n\nIt is also worth noting publications by syndicates and diverse groups with anarchist leanings, as well as an increasing number of translations of well-known European anarchists. Kropotkinâs Conquest of Bread appeared in 1895, followed in 1896 by Jean Graveâs The Future Society. The group called Los Acratas published a series of books and pamphlets, such as Malatestaâs Among Peasants and Kropotkinâs Anarchism: Its Philosophy and Ideal, among others.\n\nWith the objective of overcoming anti-organization tendencies, still present even if only in a minority, the FederaciÃ³n Libertaria de los Grupos Socialistas-anarquistas was founded, with Pietro Gori drafting its fundamental principles. This celebrated Italian lawyer and criminologist, born in Messina in 1869, arrived in Buenos Aires on July 21, 1898 fleeing authorities that sought to arrest him for disseminating anarchist propaganda. Several months later he founded the journal CriminologÃ­a moderna, later titled Archivos de psiquiatrÃ­a y criminologÃ­a. A brilliant group of young jurists and criminologistsâJosÃ© Ingenieros, Antonio Dellepiane, Luis Maria Drago, Rodolfo Rivarole, Juan Vucetich, and othersâwas attracted to his scientific teachings; another group, no less brilliant, of young writers and poetsâPascual Guaglianone, FÃ©lix Basterra, Alberto Ghilardoâwas swayed by his socialist libertarian ideology. An orator of easy and fiery speech, and at the same time of firm and coherent ideas, always more attentive to scientific rigor than rhetorical effect, Gori travelled to all the principal cities of Argentina, receiving great acclaim not only from workers and anarchists but also from bourgeois and conservatives. He wrote several pamphlets such as Las bases morales de la anarquÃ­a, Vuestro orden y nuestro desorden, among others. In January 1902 he returned to his native land, but not without leaving a profound influence on the scientific, literary, and anarchist movements in Argentina.\n\nWith the crisis of 1890 the economic situation worsened. As always, the working class suffered the most painful consequences. According to La Prensa, in Buenos Aires there were some forty thousand unemployed. Strikes proliferated in the capital as well as in various urban centers of the interior. The strikes were sometimes successful, but they did not lead to lasting results and in more than a few instances victories quickly were rendered meaningless or simply disregarded. Consequently, a workersâ central came to be seen as an absolute necessity in the struggle.\n\nThe idea that began to take hold among workers and anarchist groups was to convene all resistance societies in Argentina with the objective of starting such a central. On June 25, 1901 a congress assembled with attendance âof some fifty delegates representing thirty to thirty-five workersâ organizations both from the capital and the interior,â but not without objections from various radical groups, always fearful of traps by the social democrats. There the FederaciÃ³n Obrera Argentina (FOA) was founded. Anarchists did âall possible to create an entity that included all workers without regard to their races or beliefs, based on a solid foundation of direct action and economic struggle.â Nonetheless, the Marxist socialists, obviously a minority position, soon broke away, unable to put the new organization to the service of the party or their political goals. AdriÃ¡n Patroni, a delegate to the founding congress, and the Marxist group La organizaciÃ³n began an âincessant and treacherous war against FOA,â and promoted the idea that it is necessary to create a second workersâ federation without anarchistsâof course, controlled by the Socialist Party and as its mere mouthpieceâan act tantamount to excluding the vast majority of workers who were politically aware and ideologically defined.\n\nThe new federation had immediate occasion to commit itself in a struggle, as the period of 1901â1902 was one of great social and proletariat agitation. Strikes erupted in all trades and regions of the republic. The crisis produced a stern defense of higher salaries and better working conditions. At the time, the workday was usually no less than ten hours long and wages were at best subsistence pay. Many of the strikes were successful and brought a relative degree of relief to the condition of workers, demonstrati"
