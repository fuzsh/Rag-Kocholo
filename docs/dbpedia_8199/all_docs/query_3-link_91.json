        "text": "Transcript of “How to Obtain Residency in Paraguay”\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Hello, everyone. Ladislas Maurice from thewanderinginvestor.com. So today, I’m in Paraguay with my agent, Aleksandr. Aleksandr, how are you?\n\nALEKSANDR: Fine. And you?\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Good, good. So Aleksandr is helping me obtain residency here in Paraguay, and the process has changed versus last year. So there was a lot of kind of fear going on online about the changes that were to happen here in Paraguay in terms of immigration. At the end of the day, it’s not that bad. So we’re going to go through what the old program was, and what now the program actually is, and how to obtain residency from now on here in this country.\n\nALEKSANDR: Yeah.\n\nThe old permanent residency program in Paraguay\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: So Aleksandr, can you elaborate on what the program was before, roughly, and what the changes are?\n\nALEKSANDR: Basically, before the new law, you could apply for the permanent residency directly only by showing bank deposit of $5,000 or university diploma. And then you will get that residency in five, six, up to seven months. Now, after the new law, you cannot apply directly for the permanent residency. You can apply only, first way is for temporary residency, which they will give you for two years. And then, after the temporary residency, you apply for the permanent.\n\nThe new residency program in Paraguay\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: So now, essentially, you do not need the $5,000 deposit anymore?\n\nALEKSANDR: Now you don’t need, for the temporary residency.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: So essentially, it’s, in many ways, even easier than before, but the difference being that you don’t get permanent residency immediately?\n\nALEKSANDR: Yeah.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Okay.\n\nALEKSANDR: Yeah.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Does this change the amount of trips that people need to take to get permanent residency? Because before, essentially, you needed to take two trips, one trip to apply, one trip to actually receive your Cédula, your card.\n\nALEKSANDR: Yeah.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: What about now?\n\nALEKSANDR: Now it’s three trips. First, is to apply for the temporary residency. Then, by law, you need to come back in one year. And then, after two years, you need to come back again to apply for the permanent residency.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Okay.\n\nALEKSANDR: So basically, it’s minimum three, maximum four.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Cool. And after one year, you need to come back to check into the country, that’s by law. I don’t know, I’ve heard of people not doing it and getting away with it. I can’t recommend it because these things change. But essentially, officially, you need to take three trips as opposed to two before.\n\nALEKSANDR: Yeah.\n\nPhysical presence requirements for permanent residents of Paraguay\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Okay. And once you receive permanent residency in Paraguay, what are the requirements to keep the permanent residency?\n\nALEKSANDR: You need to be in the country once every three years.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Okay, so once every three years you just come for a day and that’s–\n\nALEKSANDR: Yeah. Yeah, for a couple days, you just make a check-in, and then you leave the country.\n\nHow long is permanent residency valid for in Paraguay\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Clear. And let’s say, I mean you’re going to help me get to the permanent residency stage, because I’m applying through the new process, so I’m going to get my temporary residency in a few months. And in two years from now, two-and-a-half years from now, Aleksandr will help me obtain my permanent residency. So once I obtain my permanent residency, how long is it valid for?\n\nALEKSANDR: Ten years.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: What happens after the 10 years? Do I have to apply again?\n\nALEKSANDR: No, you need to just renew your ID, Cédula. You don’t need to show again your birth certificate or stuff like that. You just need to give them new police record document from Paraguay, and then you just renew your Cédula, and that’s it.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Cool. So really, you’re a permanent resident, you just need to just renew your card.\n\nALEKSANDR: Yeah. And the card of, like you need to renew your both cards. One from immigration, the permanent residency, and the second is the ID from police department.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Okay.\n\nALEKSANDR: You need to renew both of them.\n\nWhat documents are required to apply for residency in Paraguay\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Okay, clear. And what documents, so now that I don’t have to essentially deposit $5,000, what documents do people need to give for the application?\n\nALEKSANDR: Police record from the country that you were born or from the country of your passport, then your birth certificate, and a marriage certificate, if you have that social status. And three of those documents should be apostilled, and have to apostilled on the original document, not on the copy. Even if notarized, doesn’t matter, have to be on the original one. And the police record have a validity for three months here, if you apply for the temporary. Then, if you apply for the ID, for the Cédula, they can accept your police record even if it’s six months.\n\nHow to obtain permanent residency in Paraguay immediately\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: So that’s why it’s important to recruit an agent that can help you with these things. I mean, you can do it on your own, for sure, but it’s going to be time-consuming, you’re going to make mistakes, and it’s just, at the end of the day, it’s going to cost you more. So it’s just better to just hire someone and get it done and focus on other things, really. So there’s also a way to obtain permanent residency immediately, so there’s still a way. Can you elaborate on it?\n\nALEKSANDR: Yeah. To apply directly, you need to build a company here, hiring five people, like local people who are born here or resident in Paraguay. And then you need to make an investment of $70,000 for each investor. So if it’s a family, then each adult investor show that amount of investment. Not showing, they need to promise. You will promise that you will spend that money during a limited period, like one year, six months, two years, depending on the ministry. And your kids, if you have a family, will have to apply for the temporary. It only work for adults.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Cool. So essentially, if you want residency in Paraguay, don’t even bother with that special investment one, unless you actually want to start a business here. If not, just do like everyone else, get your temporary residency, come back two years later, and then apply for your permanent residency, I think, for sure. It’s not worth it.\n\nALEKSANDR: Yeah, because they have the right, if, for example, you will try to cheat them, they have the right to remove the permanent residency in the future.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Just yeah, like just not worth it.\n\nALEKSANDR: Yeah.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Cool. At least this is clear. So essentially, obtaining residency in Paraguay is still very easy. You just need to come here with the right documents and to be willing to come here two to three times. And then you essentially get, after two, two-and-a-half years, you will get your permanent residency which is valid for life, essentially. So a big really interesting Plan B, especially taking into account, also, the taxes here that are very low, 10% tax on local income and nothing on income stemming from outside of Paraguay, if you structure things properly. Fantastic. So if you are interested in obtaining residency here in Paraguay, do get in touch with Aleksandr. There is his email below. There’s also a link, you can get in touch with him, and then he’ll send you a brochure with all his pricing and the process in greater detail.\n\nALEKSANDR: Yeah.\n\nLADISLAS MAURICE: Aleksandr, thank you very much."
