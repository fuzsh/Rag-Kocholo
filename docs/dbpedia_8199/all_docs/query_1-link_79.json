Facebook. * a date conundrum here. The original scoresheets for these games are dated 2 October 1976 through to 8 October 1976 but all other evidence points to the tournament running from 3 to 9 October 1976, including the meticulously-maintained Guernsey Congress website, the report in BCM (January 1977, p16) and Dr JM Aitken's game record. All Guernsey tournaments from the first one in 1975 for at least ten years started on a Sunday, so the first round must have been played on Sunday 3 October 1976 despite what appears on Murray Chandler's scoresheets.

First published on 29 August 2020, this started as a showcase for the New Zealand GM's early games during a particularly exciting and important era in British chess when he was resident in the UK. During the summer of 2020 Murray made available to me scans of scoresheets which he had discovered amongst his family's effects, and I keyed in the moves. These were mostly from the time he arrived in England in 1975, and well into the 1980s. I've endeavoured to discover the event in which they were played (the teenage Murray didn't always fill in all the fields of his scoresheets), date them, work out round numbers and opponents' names, and then place them in chronological order. (I do hope readers will help in the identification process and perhaps send in games of Murray's which are missing.) I have also appended a list of the tournaments that Murray took part in. I've since added some of his early New Zealand games - these are being worked on independently by Bill Forster and in the course of time these will be made available at the Peter Stuart NZ Games Database, which I recommend you to visit. I can also recommend following Murray's excellent Facebook chess autobiography where he is recounting his chess career in regular segments. Together with his BritBase collection it provides a unique and innovative insight into the career of a grandmaster. 27 August 2020\n\nInitial upload of 1,587 games, from 1973 to the end of 1989 (including Hastings 1989/90). These include several hundred games not seen before, mostly from domestic UK events such as weekenders and club/county matches. Murray sent me scans of scoresheets which I then input. A few scores are incomplete (moves missing, partly illegible); others are missing names of opponents, event identifiers, dates, etc. I have concentrated mainly on games Murray played in the UK, with my understanding being that Murray's New Zealand games are being worked on by Bill Forster in New Zealand (results of his work to be found at the Peter Stuart NZ Games Games Database). That said, it embraces all the games that have been hitherto available on commercial databases, and I have endeavoured to find round numbers and dates for these games where they are missing on ChessBase, as well as correcting misidentified opponents, etc. I am continuing to edit games played by Murray from 1990 onwards (another 651 games as things stand) and will add these when I've finished tidying up dates and round numbers.\n\nBelow on this page I have appended some rough notes I made whilst conducting the input process, identifying many of the domestic UK events that Murray played in during the 1970s and 1980s. I used it to help sort out which events various unattributed scoresheets related to, and it occurs to me that it might prove useful for others to refer to.\n\nI have timed publication of this database of games to coincide with Murray's own Facebook autobiography at the point when he arrived in England in 1975, in which he uses images of his old scoresheets and press cuttings to illustrate the story of his chess career. This unique and innovative narrative is open to all to read, whether Facebook users or not, at this link: https://www.facebook.com/murray.chandler.58\n\n29 August 2020 Number of games now 1,592. Following the initial upload, I am grateful for amendments and additions from Andy Ansel, Ian Rogers and Michael Yeo. Andy helped me with names of players from Murray's 1979 visit to the USA. Michael provided me with further data regarding his game with Murray from Charlton 1977, including the fact that the Charlton tournament, though retaining its usual name, was actually played in Moorgate, London, due to the unavailability of its usual venue. Ian has supplied some further games: (1) Johansen-MC, Portsmouth 1985; (2) Johansen-MC, Hong Kong Commonwealth Championship 1983; (3) D Johansen-MC, Borehamwood 1983; (4) D Johansen-MC, Australian Junior (U18) Championship 1975; (5) MC-I.Rogers, Aysralian Junior (U18) Championship 1975. Many thanks to all. I've also tidied up a few names and added a few more ratings where they were missing. 29 August 2020 Phil Adams informs me that, in his game against Murray from Chorley 1976, the colours and result were Chandler (white) 1-0 Adams (black). Many thanks for that, Phil, and I solemnly promise never to insert a spurious middle initial \"J\" into your name again. 30 August 2020 Tim Harding pointed out date errors in some of the games played in the City of London Open, February 1979. The tournament dates are correct but four of the game dates showed the year as 1977. Now fixed. Thanks for the feedback, Tim. 1 September 2020 Brian Denman has kindly gone to the trouble of contacting Murray's opponent Alan Palmer in their game from October 1975 to tighten up an unclear score. As a result we now have a slight correction to the moves at the end of the game, plus more detailed game data and date. It was played on 30 October 1975. Thanks to Brian and Alan. 2 September 2020 A couple of amendments to the tournament notes given below. Ian Thompson supplied some further info regarding the Kent Junior Championships of October 1975, and I have included some comments from Murray's postcard to his parents that he featured in his latest Facebook entry (also October 1975). Thanks to Ian and Murray. 2 September 2020 Mark Page contributed a rapidplay game he played with Murray at the British Quickplay Championship in Leeds in July 1989. Thanks, Mark. 3 September 2020 Brian Denman points out a wrong date - from the July 1979 National Bank of Dubai Open â the 5th round game against Douglas Shallcross should be dated 29.07.1979 (not 1980). Later that same year, the Brighton tournament: the start and end dates (13 December and 19 December) are correct but the rounds were played thus (round numbers in brackets): (1) 13.12.1979; (2) 14.12.1979; (3) 14.12.1979; (4) 15.12.1979; (5) 16.12.1979; (6) 16.12.1979; (7) 17.12.1979; (8) 18.12.1979; (9) 19.12.1979. My thanks to Brian. 4 September 2020 Robert K Taylor emailed me with some more info regarding the Buckley Open of May 1976. Firstly, his name is as given (not RG Taylor which was my original interpretation of a very faint scoresheet). Secondly, his game with Murray was played in the second round, so the Timmins game must have been played in round 4. Robert has also given a little further information about who scored what in the tournament which I have placed in the notes down the page. He remembers that Murray's colour sequence was BBWW and was expecting White in the fifth and final round. But David Levy expected White too! He had had BWBW previously, and won the argument as to who had White in the final round. I've also supplied a forename for Murray's third round opponent, Peter G Killick. 11 September 2020 Murray has resolved the mystery about his opponent in the 1976 Max Fuller Elo tournament. It was Paul the son (and not John the father) Littlewood whom he played. The file has been updated. 15 September 2020 Murray has reconstructed the bulk of the moves of his win against Julian Hodgson from the last round of the 1975 Southampton Open by reference to his private notes and a contemporary publication of part of the game. I have included some of his contemporary analysis in the score. 16 September 2020 One more game added: Lawrence Cooper kindly sent me his draw with Murray in the 4th round of the Barnsdale Young Masters, 25 February 1989. 24 September 2020 One of the stub games on file now has now been reunited with all its moves. I found Chandler-Angantysson from the England v Iceland European Team Championship qualifying match on 10 July 1982 in CHESS, August 1982, page 88. 2 November 2020 For further material relating to Murray Chandler, it is worth checking out the online archive of his 'Listener' columns, written for a New Zealand newspaper from 1976 onwards. 30 November 2020 Added crosstable for the 1976 London 'Maxelo' tournament, sourced from the Chandler FaceBook post for 30 November. 15 February 2021 First update in a while: (1) added a stub game MC 1-0 Andrew Ledger, Barnsdale YM, Round 1, 24.02.89; (2) MC 1-0 Peter Hannan, Charlton CC, June 1977 (no exact day given but MC says it was played in the interval between Ilford and Charlton tournaments); (3) MC 1-0 Michael C Davis, Surrey op, Rd 3, 16.07.77; (4) MC 0-1 Jim Plaskett, Charlton op, Rd 2, 18.06.77; (5) S Dolton 0-1 MC, Charlton op, Rd 3, 18.06.77; (6) Peter Sowray 0-1 MC, Charlton op, Rd 5, 19.06.77. I have also adjusted the round number of the game MC 1-0 Chris Cooley, Charlton op, 18.06.77 to round 4. Thanks to Murray Chandler for the additional scores. Running total of games now 1,600. 6 April 2021 No new games but dates added/corrected for the 1977/78 New Zealand Championship, played in Wellington. 13 May 2021 Another seven games added, from the 1979 World Open in which Murray scored 7/10. We now have all his games from this event. The new ones are Rd 1 v Da Silva*, Rd 2 v Kamude*, Rd 3 v Demplar*, Rd 5 v Turner*, Rd 7 v Zuckerman, Rd 8 v Bisguier and Rd 9 v Gogol*. Where I have asterisked names, it's either because I'm not sure of the spelling of the surnames or I'm lacking details of forenames/initials, or both of these things. Any help appreciated. 15 May 2021\n\nOne blank game entry already on the file now has the moves included - all 90 of them. An important addition: Chandler 1-0 Short, Benedictine 1979, Rd 1. My thanks to Murray for digging out the score. Incidentally, that leaves another 28 game entries where we have details of a game being played but no moves. I may as well list them here for ease of reference:\n\n(1) Paignton Premier Paignton (rd 1), 07.09.1975 win v John C Cock;\n\n(2) Paignton Premier Paignton (rd 3), 09.09.1975 loss v Robert Bellin;\n\n(3) Guernsey op Guernsey (rd 5), 09.10.1975 loss v Ray Gamble;\n\n(4) LARA op 2nd London (rd 2), 01.11.1975 loss v Alan Perkins;\n\n(5) Guernsey op Guernsey (rd 3), 04.10.1976 win v M Gielow;\n\n(6) County Match London, St Brides (board 1), 11.12.1976 win v Robert Bellin;\n\n(7) County Champ Semi-Final (board 1), 07.06.1980 win v Nigel Short;\n\n(8) Lloyds Bank Masters 04th London (rd 5), 24.08.1980 draw v Simon Knott;\n\n(9) Malta Olympiad 24th Valetta (rd 13), 04.12.1980 Â½-Â½ v Toufeeq Catalan;\n\n(10) Bundesliga 1981/82 (rd 4.2), 05.12.1981 win v Hoffmann,Hans; this game now included\n\n(11) EU-chT 8th qual Gr3 Middlesbrough (rd 2.5), 11.07.1982 loss to Helgi Olafsson;\n\n(12) WchT U26 Chicago (rd 2), 08.1983 win v Moses Matjola;\n\n(13) WchT U26 Chicago (rd 4), 08.1983 win v Jorge H Gomez Baillo;\n\n(14) WchT U26 Chicago (rd 6), 08.1983 draw with Artur Yusupov;\n\n(15) WchT U26 Chicago (rd 7), 08.1983 win v James Rizzitano;\n\n(16) WchT U26 Chicago (rd 8), 08.1983 win v Fernand Gobet;\n\n(17) WchT U26 Chicago (rd 10), 08.1983 Â win v Joel Benjamin;\n\n(18) WchT U26 Chicago (rd 11), 08.1983 loss v Eric Lobron;\n\n(19) Bundesliga 1984/85 (rd 3.2), 11.11.1984 draw with Dirk Paulsen;\n\n(20) Bundesliga 1985/86 Germany (rd 10.2), 22.02.1986 Â win v Karl Heinz Goehring;\n\n(21) Dubai Olympiad 27th Dubai (rd 1), 15.11.1986 Â win v Luis J Torres;\n\n(22) Barnsdale Young Masters Uppingham (rd 1), 24.02.1989 Â win v Andrew Ledger\n\nâ and from the 1990s onwards â\n\n(23) 4NCL 1995/96 Rd03-Abergavenny (rd 3.1), 20.01.1996 draw with Mark Hebden;\n\n(24) 4NCL 1995/96 Rd04-Abergavenny (rd 4.1), 21.01.1996 draw with Keith Arkell;\n\n(25) 4NCL 1995/96 Rd06-Birmingham (6.1), 18.02.1996 Â win v Charlie Storey;\n\n(26) 4NCL 1995/96 Rd07-Ware (7.1), 16.03.1996 win v Graham Burgess;\n\n(27) 4NCL 1995/96 Rd11-Warwick (11.1), 25.05.1996 win v Gary Quillan;\n\n(28) 4NCL 1995/96 Rd13-Warwick (13.1), 27.05.1996 win v Andrew Harley.\n\nAny info leading to the apprehension of these escaped scoresheets and their subsequent incarceration in the BritBase Penitentiary will be much appreciated.\n\n4 June 2021 Six additional games, sent by Murray Chandler: a complete set of his six games from the ARC Young Masters weekender, 27 February - 1 March 1987 (I've added a note of the tournament results in the chronological list of events above). Secondly, the game with an incomplete score played at the Oxford City weekender on 17.11.1979 has had colours/result amended to Chandler 0-1 N.R. Benjamin. Thirdly, the undated Borehamwood weekender games have been shifted from a provisional date of 1980 to one of end-May 1981. I think this has a good chance of being right; Murray played his fellow countryman RI Nokes during this event and RI Nokes was also present in the UK at the Manor Tyres tournament in Bristol a few weeks later. 4 June 2021 Murray has sent me the score of his game against Hoffman, Bundesliga 05.12.1981, which had previously been shown as a header with no moves (see entry above dated 15 May 2021). Thanks, Murray. 7 June 2021 A major update: the number of games has increased from 1,613 to 2,433 (of which 68 are blanks). I have now added games dated after 1989, making use of the Peter Stuart New Zealand database and also a separate database sent to me by Gerald Hartmann, who has compiled a Chandler database of his own. Gerald's database was particularly useful in supplying dates and round numbers for games. Many thanks to Gerald, and also to the editors of the NZL database Bill Forster and Helen Milligan. 8 June 2021 I'm grateful to Brian Denman for pointing out that one of the games featured in the database, Shephard-Chandler, Brighton 1979, was in fact a truncated version of the game C.Shephard-C.Chandler from the 1977 British Championship and nothing to do with Murray Chandler. I have deleted it from the file which now totals 2,432 games. 19 June 2021 Murray Chandler sent me amendments to three games: (1) The MI Davis game correctly batched with the 1982 Bristol Manor Tyres tournament games nevertheless had a wrong game date - it should be 26.06.1982 (not 1980); (2) a clearer scan of the game played in round 2 of the 1980 Chelmsford tournament (date 04.10.1980) enabled him to make out the opponent's name, which was Karl Bowden. It also became possible to make out some more moves of this game, though the score is missing a few moves before the time control so it is still not complete; (3) another better scan of the round 5 game from the same tournament vs DR Lewis (dated 05.10.1980) enabled me to complete the input of the remaining moves of the game. 4 July 2021 A number of amendments/additions: (1) the moves of the game Catalan-MC, round 13 (Syria v New Zealand), Malta Olympiad 1980, now available; (2) Bundesliga games from early 1981: Borik-MC was played 21.02.1981 and MC-Huebner played 22.02.1981 (not in January as previously given on Big Database 2020, which was my source for these games). There is also a correction to the final moves played in the Huebner game. Finally, as these games turned out to be played played after Bundesliga games vs Soos and Haubt (and not before), I have adjusted the round numbers for these four games accordingly; (3) date of MC vs Goehring, Bundesliga 1980, adjusted to 13.12.1980; (4) S.Jackson-MC, NN 1979, now thought to have been played on 18 January 1981 in round 5 of the Portsmouth Open. Thanks to Murray Chandler for supplying details of these additions/corrections. 6 July 2021 Two games supposedly played by Murray Chandler vs Charles Schulien in the USA in 1980 have been deleted as we suspect they were played by a different Chandler. Number of games now 2,430. 9 July 2021 One additional game and one correction: the extra game is Chandler-Westerinen, a 24-move draw, but unfortunately we don't know the date or the event in which it was played. One clue is the scoresheet which was marked SC Bamberg, a German Bundesliga club, but we don't think the game was actually played in the Bundesliga proper. I've assigned the game a provisional date of 1981 but that is just so that it appears somewhere vaguely plausible in chronological order. The correction is to the game Chandler-Pickard, Borehamwood, 31.05.1981, which was a draw, not a loss for White. Thanks to Murray Chandler for the additional info. 10 July 2021 Oops. That extra game, Chandler-Westerinen, wasn't an extra game at at all. It was actually Chandler-Westermeier, Bundesliga 1981, which was already on the database. 20 July 2021 An extra game added: Ward 0-1 Chandler, Remploy Calderdale (Halifax) Open, 02.05.1988. My thanks to Gerald Hartmann for finding it in BCM, July 1988. Total now 2,431. 2 August 2021 One game added: Povah Â½-Â½ Chandler, North London Open, 01.11.1981. Also, the game Povah 0-1 Chandler, Streatham v Charlton, previously undated but estimated as 1977, has now been pinpointed by Nigel Povah as being played on 20.12.1978. My thanks to Nigel Povah and Murray Chandler for passing on the game score and information, and also for supplying the full crosstable of the 1980 Regency Masters tournament held in Ramsgate, which I have included further up this page. 6 August 2021 The game Emms Â½-Â½ Chandler, Charlton, formerly given as 18.07.1981, was actually played at the 1982 Charlton Open, and should be dated 17.07.1982. 27 August 2021 Three corrections applied after notification from Murray Chandler: (1) Groszpeter v MC, Minsk 1982 â 24 Rcd1 was played; (2) Bundesliga game v Schussler â played Saturday 5 June 1982; (3) Bundesliga game v Hecht â Sunday 6 June 1982 20 October 2021 Adjusted dates of the 1976 Guernsey Open games (dated 3-9 October - not 2-8 October). 23 January 2023 We now have precise dates and venues for the Chandler-Rogers match played in May 1986. The four games involved have been updated. 4 May 2023 I just noticed a result error: the game Chandler-Adams, Watson Farley & Williams Challenge, rd 10, 30.04.1990, was a draw (not a win for Black). Correction applied. Also a date error: the 1996/97 season Bundesliga game Movsziszian 0-1 Chandler was surely played on 12.04.1997 (not 04.12.1997). 12 July 2024 Added a simul game, Chandler 1-0 J.Carr (12.12.1987, Cheltenham) and a game finish, Chandler 1-0 Mortazavi, North London Open Oct/Nov 1987. 29 July 2024 We now have the score for the game MC Â½-Â½ Dan Cramling, World U17 Championship, rd 9, 13.07.1976, replacing a previous stub. My thanks to Murray Chandler and Ian Rogers for sending it. 11 August 2024 The game J.Nunn - M.Chandler (rd 4, ARC Young Masters 1983) now has some more moves and a different result - it was a draw, not a win for White. My thanks to John Nunn for supplying the correction.\n\n© 2021-2024 John Saunders"
