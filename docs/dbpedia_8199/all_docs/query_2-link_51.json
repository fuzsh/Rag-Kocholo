You are invited to leave aside your computer for a while, set up the chess pieces on a board and ‘play’, as if it were a real game. It is best to move down each page gradually, in such a way as to conceal the next move. Although you will be ‘playing’ each game from one side of the board, sometimes you are asked to decide upon moves for your ‘opponent’. This is because, in chess, we don’t just have to see our own moves, we also have to think about what our opponent is doing, or trying to do, or should do. You should spend between an hour and a half and two hours on each game. Points are awarded for selecting the best moves and are deducted for blunders. At the end there is a scale to indicate how well you ‘played’. Of course it is also possible to treat these simply as annotated games, without testing yourself, but the training benefit is greater if you take an active part in the ‘lesson’. A few years ago it gave me great pleasure to read that the Spanish scientific popularizer, Eduard Punset, believed that it was very important for the student to take an active part in the lesson, since in this way his or her learning would be enhanced. That is precisely the idea behind this book. My fondness for this type of training goes back to my childhood in Buenos Aires, where I learnt my chess; the many chess clubs there used to hold regular competitions where you had to guess the next move, and this tradition continues to this day. With the passage of time the pupil became a teacher and in the 1970s I started writing training articles based on this format for the now defunct magazine El Rey de Argentina. I still do so today, for various media, and my articles have been the basis for several books in Spanish and one previous one in English, entitled Chess Self-Improvement. This book will also appear in electronic format. The computer is now of huge importance in the dissemination of chess information and it also provides an opportunity for improved training. Used properly, information technology is fantastic, but poor practice can have negative consequences. It is more and more common to come across weak players (and even some strong ones) who rely completely on the computer for their evaluations and even express strong opinions, without being able to back these up with their own arguments. Nigel Short has written about this in the magazine New in Chess, and I was also very amused by the reaction of an American master, who was commenting on a game being broadcast live on ICC (the Internet Chess Club); the player with the white pieces was trying to win a rook ending with three pawns against two and of course the computer was evaluating this as a draw, assuming best play by both sides. Several low-rated chess fans were expressing their indignation on ICC that the player with White was actually carrying on and still trying to win. The master’s response was: “90% of you guys would lose this ending with Black, and the other 10% would even lose it with White.”\n\n6\n\nThe structure of the book The book is divided into four parts. Part 1 is called ‘Attacking the King’, which is self-explanatory: in the eleven games presented, the main theme is the attack on the enemy king. Part 2, with twelve games, is entitled ‘Attack, Defence and Counter-attack’, where the scenario is the most usual one, in that there are not only attacks but also good defences and successful counterattacks. Part 3, is called ‘Typical Structures and Positional Play’ and consists of twelve games where the main theme is positional play and/or the handling of typical pawn structures. Part 4, ‘Endings’, is the shortest section, with five games in which the emphasis is mainly on the final phase of the game. There is inevitably some cross-over of ideas between the four sections, but I believe that this division is a reasonable one. As for the scoring, I cannot claim that it is mathematically precise, but I have tried to be as objective as possible in the awarding of points. In my experience, students (especially younger ones) ascribe great importance to the scoring; I consider it to be a useful challenge and a stimulus to learning; I find that when the children are told that a move can gain points they really sit up and take notice, with improved concentration. The games have been checked with analysis engines, but obviously, as time passes, improvements might be found. I have tried to reward ‘human moves’ more than ‘computer moves’; I consider it more important to be able to understand a move, rather than justify it tactically with a complex line that only a computer could see. Wherever possible I have also used the players’ own annotations, since there can be no better guide, though I have generally expanded these, since very often what is obvious to a master often requires further clarification to the student. As always, writing about chess is a pleasure for me. I hope that each one of these forty games will help you to improve your play and your judgment, so that the above-mentioned American master will not be able to include you among the 90% of players he was talking about, and certainly not among the other 10%.

Nb4! (4 points) 12 exf6 (12 a3? loses to 12 ... Rxc3!) 12 ... Rxc3! 13 Nd4 (defending c2; whereas 13 bxc3? allows 13 ... Qa3+ 14 Kb1 Qxa2+ 15 Kc1 Qa1 mate) 13 ... Ra3 (threatening 14 ... Nxa2+ 15 Kb1 Nc3+ and mates) 14 Bc4 (worse is 14 Nb3 Rxb3! 15 cxb3 Nxa2+ 16 Kb1 Nb4 with a strong attack which more than compensates for the sacrificed exchange) 14 ... Nxa2+ 15 Bxa2 Qxd2+ 16 Rxd2 Rxa2 17 Kb1 Ra4 and Black is a pawn up. 11 ... b5\n\nGame 1 White: You Black: Master Sicilian Defence [B67] 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nf6 5 Nc3 d6 6 Bg5 e6 7 Qd2 a6 8 0-0-0 Bd7 9 f4 Rc8 This move is less popular than 9 ... b5, 9 ... Be7, and even 9 ... Qc7, preparing queenside castling. 10 Nf3 Qa5\n\nBlack activates his forces on the queenside, but the d7-bishop is left rather loose. Is it possible to take advantage of this?\n\nBlack continues to play actively, ignoring both the central break 12 e5 and the damage that would result to his kingside pawn structure after 12 Bxf6 gxf6.\n\n– Your Move –\n\nChoose between 11 e5, 11 Kb1, and 11 Bxf6. 11 Kb1! 3 points. A typical defensive move, reinforcing the position; the king defends the a2-pawn and escapes the influence of the c8-rook. Of course there are tactical reasons to discard more active options. 11 Bxf6 (0 points) is playable but not very flexible. In general, if there’s no clear path to an advantage, it’s preferable to keep as many options open as possible. Besides, the move Bxf6 will be still be available later. If you chose 11 e5? you will have to deduct 2 points at the end of the exercise. Why did White reject 11 e5 - ?\n\n– Your Move – 12 Bxf6 1 point. But only if you have already planned your next move. Surprisingly the young attacking player playing White rejected the complications resulting from 12 e5 (2 points). Black can’t counterattack with 12 ... b4, because after 13 exf6 bxc3 14 fxg7 Bxg7 15 Qxd6 White’s advantage is clear; so the reply 12 ... Nd5 is forced, and following 13 Nxd5 Qxd2 14 Rxd2 exd5 White can either capture the d5-pawn, which allows Black to gain some activity in return after 15 Rxd5 Be6 16 Rd2 dxe5 17 fxe5 Bc5, or, probably the best option, create further weaknesses in Black’s position with 15 a4!.\n\n– Your Move – (as Black; after 11 e5)\n\n9\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King 12 ... gxf6 – Your Move – 13 f5\n\n– Your Move – (as Black) Choose between 15 ... Nxd4, 15 ... Ne5, and 15 ... b4.\n\n2 points. A thematic continuation, White fixes the doubled f-pawns and puts pressure on the e6-pawn; one idea now is to open the f-file and another is to try to force Black to play ... e6-e5; of course Black should do this only when a white knight can’t easily reach the weakened d5-square. – Your Move – (as Black) 13 ... Nb4! 3 points. An unusual manoeuvre; Black threatens ... Rxc3, but after the obvious white response, Black will have lost two tempi. In return he gains the possibility of the pawn break ... b5-b4, which seems adequate compensation. In similar positions a standard idea is to dislodge the c3-knight with 13 ... b4 (2 points) and after 14 Ne2 (intending 15 Nf4), now that this knight can no longer go to d5, Black can safely play 14 ... e5, controlling both f4 and d4. It is also worth considering 13 ... h5 (2 points), a move which allows the eventual activation of the dark-squared bishop via h6, while preventing the advance g2-g4. 14 a3 Nc6 15 Nd4\n\n15 ... Nxd4? This is inconsistent with Black’s previous play and loses 2 points. It was better to play 15 ... Ne5 (1 point), when the ambitious 16 Qf2 (threatening 17 fxe6 followed by Qxf6, as well as the 17 Nce2-f4 idea) is questionable on account of 16 ... Rxc3!; for example, 17 fxe6 fxe6 18 Qxf6 Rg8! 19 bxc3 Qxc3 etc. So 16 Be2 is preferable, and White’s has slightly the better chances after 16 ... h5 17 Rhf1, or 16 ... Nc4 17 Bxc4 bxc4 18 Qe2! (targeting the c4-pawn, in order to discourage the immediate 18 ... Rb8), followed by 19 Rhf1, since in both cases the insecurity of the black king is of mounting importance. To return to the original question, Black’s best option is 15 ... b4! (4 points), and after 16 axb4 Nxb4, Black has retained his strong knight and opened the b-file against the white king, justifying the idea initiated with 13 ... Nb4. No better for White is 16 Nxc6 Bxc6 17 axb4 Qxb4 18 Qd4, and after 18 ... Rb8 19 Qxb4 Rxb4 20 Bxa6, instead of 20 ... Bxe4, which is fully playable, Black can delay the capture of the pawn and trust in his two bishops and pressure along the open lines by playing, for example, 20 ... h5, with the plan of ... Ke7, ... Bh6, ... Rhb8 etc. 16 Qxd4 Be7\n\n10\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King\n\n– Your Move – 17 Be2 2 points. With the typical idea of 18 Bh5, putting pressure on the f7-pawn and threatening f5xe6. 17 ... Kd8 Seeking a safer location. If 17 ... h5 then 18 Rhf1. Black’s original intention was to play 17 ... 0-0; why do you think he had second thoughts? – Your Move – (after 17 ... 0-0) Answer: The strongest option is direct attack, starting with the manoeuvre 18 Rd3! (3 points) e.g. 18 ... Kh8 19 Rh3 (threatening Qe3-h6), and after 19 ... Rg8 20 fxe6, the positionally desirable 20 ... fxe6 loses to 21 e5! fxe5? 22 Qe4 Rg7 23 Bd3 etc, but if Black gives up control of d5 with 20 ... Bxe6, the move 21 Nd5 is strong, and White is clearly better. Also attractive are 18 g4 (1 point) and 18 Rhf1 (1 point) – Your Move – 18 Rhf1 2 points. This idea should already be familiar; the weakness on f6 is highlighted and now, after f5xe6, the sacrifice Rxf6 is in the air. As there’s no immediate black threat, there are other good moves such as 18 g4 (1 point), but this is less straightforward than the move played.\n\n– Your Move – (as Black) Choose between 18 ... Rf8, 18 ... Rg8, and 18 ... Rb8. 18 ... Rb8?! The counter-attack will not be successful, so this move loses 1 point. After 18 ... Rg8?! (which also loses 1 point), if White wants to avoid complications he has two strong options in 19 g4 and 19 Bh5!, when 19 ... Rxg2? 20 Rg1 would be almost suicidal; Black would have to play the sad 19 ... Rf8, leaving White with the advantage after, for instance, 20 Rf3. It is also possible for White to plunge in with 19 fxe6 fxe6 20 Rxf6!, when the least of the evils for Black seems to be 20 ... Rxc3 21 bxc3 Bxf6 22 Qxf6+ Kc7 23 Qe7 Qb6, but then White can gain a clear advantage in several ways, such as the active 24 Rf1 Rxg2 25 Rf7, or simply 24 Bf3. Worse is 20 ... Bxf6?! 21 Qxf6+ Kc7 22 Qe7 Qb6 23 e5! (23 Bxb5! is also good) 23 ... d5 24 Rxd5 etc. As is only to be expected, a move like 20 ... Rxg2?! is bad; one effective response is 21 Rf7 Rxc3 22 Rxe7! Rc6 23 Rf1 (also strong is 23 Rxh7!; e.g. 23 ... Rxe2 24 Rh8+! Be8 25 Qf6+! Kd7 26 Qg7+ Kd8 27 Qf7 etc) 23 ... e5, and now how should White continue?\n\n11\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King – Your Move – (after 21 ... Kc7) Answer: One good way forward is 22 Qe7 (2 points) and if 22 ... Qb6 then 23 e5; but the most accurate continuation is in fact the immediate 22 e5! (3 points), and if 22 ... d5 then 23 Rxd5! (23 Nxd5+! is also good) 23 ... Rbd8 24 Qe7 Qb6 (or 24 ... exd5 25 b4) 25 Rd6 Qg1+ 26 Ka2 Qa7 (or 26 ... Kc8 27 Rxa6) 27 Bxb5! with a winning position. But what happens after 23 ... exd5, instead of 23 ... Rbd8 - ? – Your Move – (after 23 ... e5) Answer: The strongest continuation, and the only one that gains any points, is the winning combination 24 Rxd7+! Kxd7 25 Rf7+ Ke8 26 Qa7 etc (2 points). Going back to the initial question, since the counter-attack doesn’t work, in view of the threat of 19 fxe6 and 20 Rxf6, the most tenacious move is the natural 18 ... Rf8 (2 points). White can continue advantageously with 19 g4, planning h2-h4 and g4-g5. Also possible is 19 Rf3, continuing to activate his forces. 19 fxe6 fxe6\n\n– Your Move – (after 23 ... exd5) Answer: 24 b4! (2 points) wins, since the black queen must move, but after 24 ... Qxa3 25 Nxd5+ Kc8, White can take the rook on h8; 26 Bg4! also wins.\n\n– Your Move – 20 Rxf6! 2 points. Of course – why not? 20 ... b4 What happens after 20 .. Bxf6 21 Qxf6+ Kc7 - ?\n\n– Your Move – Choose between 21 Rf3, 21 Rf7, 21 Rf5, and 21 Rxe6. 21 Rf5! 3 points. Plunging into the complications. Also advantageous, but with an endgame in mind, is 21 Rxe6! (2 points) and after 21 ... bxc3 22 Qxh8+ Kc7 23 Qxb8+ Kxb8 24 Rxe7 cxb2 25 Kxb2, White is much better, decisively so according to the chess engines. White has a material advantage, which in many variations allows him to exchange the two rooks for the queen, reaching a winning pawn ending. Less clear is 21 Rf7 (0 points), which leads to the same ending as after 21 Rxe6, but without having captured the e6-pawn. 12\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King 21 Rf3?! (deduct 1 point), isn’t dangerous, because there are no substantial threats and Black can fight on with 21 ... Rg8. 21 ... e5\n\n– Your Move –\n\nNow there are no less than three white pieces en prise. – Your Move – 22 Qa7! 2 points. The only move, but crushing. 22 ... Qb6 The ending offers no relief, but there’s nothing anything better. On 22 ... Rc8, White can play 23 Nd5; e.g. 23 ... bxa3 24 b4 Qa4 25 Qb6+, mating. 23 Qxb6+ Rxb6\n\n25 exf5! 3 points. This exchange sacrifice is the most forceful continuation; in return White gets two pawns, a dangerous passed f-pawn and a 3-to1 majority on the kingside, without allowing any counterplay. 25 Nxb6?! (deduct 1 point) is less clear, as it gives Black some hopes of salvation, based on his bishop pair and active play; for example, 25 ... Bxe4 26 axb4 Rf8 27 Bxa6 Rf2 28 Bd3 Bxg2 29 Bxh7 Kc7 30 Nc4 Bc6 31 Rd2 Rf4 etc. 25 ... Rb8 26 f6 Bf8 27 axb4 Kd7 28 g4 Rg8 29 h4 h6 30 Rg1!\n\n– Your Move – 24 Nd5 1 point. Forced – any other move loses 1 point. 24 ... Bxf5\n\nThere are many winning moves, but this is the clearest way; White gets two connected passed pawns and the rest is straightforward. 30 ... e4 31 g5 hxg5 32 hxg5 Ke6 33 Bc4 Ke5 34 g6 Bh6 35 Ne7 Rgd8 36 g7 1-0\n\nMikhail Tal vs. Semen Furman, Riga 1955. 13\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King Some lessons from this game: 1. You should always give serious consideration to any possible pawn breaks; equally you should not rush in without precise calculation. (11 e5?) 2. It helps to be familiar with the typical manoeuvres in the positions you are playing. (11 Kb1!, 13 f5!) 3. You should do training to be able to sense the critical moments of the game, when precise calculation is needed. (15 ... b4!, 18 ... Rf8!, 20 Rxf6!) 4. Of course it’s always good to capture material ‘for nothing’, but you should always check to see whether it really is ‘for nothing’ and decide whether it’s better to decline the offer. (25 exf5!) Italics refer to variations, as opposed to moves actually played. How did you do? (Maximum score: 45 points) More than 39 points: Super-Grandmaster. Between 35 and 39 points: Grandmaster. Between 28 and 34 points: International Master. Between 20 and 27 points: Tal is one of your favourite players! Between 10 and 19 points: You found several key moves. Less than 10 points: You need to be more careful next time!\n\nGame 2 White: You Black: Master Pirc Defence [B08] 1 e4 d6 2 d4 g6 3 Nc3 Bg7 4 Nf3 c6 5 Bc4 Nf6 6 e5 The player with white pieces criticized his own move here: “This is hardly the way to obtain an advantage. The activity of the white pieces turns out to be fictitious.” 6 Bb3 and 6 Qe2 are more usual. 6 ... dxe5 7 Nxe5 0-0 8 0-0 Nbd7\n\n– Your Move – 9 f4 1 point. Semen Furman used to say jokingly, “As you make your bed, so you must lie in it.” White took on a commitment by playing 6 e5 and now he has to justify his ambitious decision. Taking on d7 or retreating from e5 would be a premature admission of failure, so the knight needs reinforcing in its strong position. However, this move isn’t without drawbacks; for instance, the c1-bishop now has less scope. 9 ... Qc7 10 Qf3 a6 Controlling b5, in order to play ... c6-c5 without fearing Nb5; it also prepares ... b7b5. The immediate 10 ... c5 was also worth consideration, but then the sacrifice 11 Nxf7\n\n14\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King has to be considered – how would you respond to that?\n\n– Your Move – (as Black; after 11 Nxf7) Answer: Not 11 ... Rxf7?! because of 12 Nb5! Qa5 13 Qb3, winning material; if you chose this, deduct 1 point. Much better is 11 ... cxd4! (3 points), when the position would be approximately equal after the practically forced sequence 12 Ne5+ Kh8 13 Nb5 Nxe5 14 Nxc7 Nxf3+ 15 Rxf3 Rb8 etc. 11 Nb5 is another possibility; what would you play now?\n\n11 ... Qb8?! (deduct 1 point) isn’t playable either, as after 12 Bxf7+! (even better than 12 Nxf7) 12 ... Rxf7 13 Nxf7 Kxf7 14 f5! (threatening 15 Bf4) 14 ... gxf5 15 Qb3+! Kf8 16 Bf4 e5 17 dxe5 Nxe5, White’s advantage is clear; he has several attractive continuations, such as 18 Rad1 and 18 Rae1, bringing the rook into the attack, or even 18 Qe3, planning to answer 18 ... Ne4 with 19 Qxe4! fxe4 20 Bxe5+. The best response to 11 Nb5 is 11 ... Qa5! (3 points), and now 12 Nxf7?! isn’t dangerous since Black can play 12 ...

Rxf7? is bad because of 13 Rxe7, but after either 12 ... Nb6 or 12 ... cxd4 White is almost forced to take the draw. After 12 ... cxd4, one amusing variation is 13 Ne5+ Kh8 14 Nd5 Qc5 (not 14 ... Nxd5? 15 Nxg6+ hxg6 16 Qh3+ Kg8 17 Bxd5+ Rf7 18 Rxe7 and wins) 15 Nxg6+ hxg6 16 Nxe7 Qxc4 17 Qh3+ Nh7 18 Nxg6+ Kg8 19 Ne7+ with a draw. 12 Bb3 White spent some time here considering 12 f5, but he rejected it because Black can simply play 12 ... exf5!, not fearing 13 Nxf7 Rxf7 14 Re7 since he has the counterblow 14 ... Qd6!; for example, 15 Bxf7+ Kf8 16 Re6 Qxd4+ 17 Be3, and now 17 ... Qb4 wins material. It was also possible to play 12 ... Qb6, among other moves. 12 ... c5 – Your Move – 13 Be3 1 point. Completing development; White gains nothing by opening the position with 13 d5 exd5 14 Bxd5 Nb6! etc.\n\n13 ... cxd4? If you chose this move, deduct 2 points, as we are at “the critical point of the game. With this exchange Black frees the locked-in bishop on e3, and all White’s pseudo-active moves in the opening prove in fact to be useful.” (Tal) It was better to play 13 ... b5! (4 points), when 14 Qxa8? Bb7 15 Qa7 Ra8 favours Black, since the black queen is stronger than the rooks and the b3-bishop is out of the game; in fact this bishop will be sorely missed on the kingside after an eventual ... Qc6 or ... Qb7. Instead, White intended to reply with 14 dxc5, obtaining three minor pieces and a pawn for the queen after 14 ...

Bd7! (2 points), when the a8-rook joins in the defence. Now 30 h6? fails to 30 ... Qf8, so White should play 30 Bxe6+ Bxe6 31 Qxe6+ Kg7 32 Qf6+ with a draw. The computer suggests some other ‘imaginative’ moves that don’t lose, such as 29 ... h6 (1 point) and 29 ... Nf3 (1 point), but for playing moves like these it’s better to have silicon assistance. On the other hand, 29 ... gxh5? loses in several ways, one being 30 Qg5+ Kh8 31 Rf7 Nxf7 32 Qxc5 with a decisive material advantage, thanks to the threatened mate on f8. – Your Move – 24 Ne4 1 point. Now the best course is to target the f6-pawn. Again after 24 Ne8+?! (0 points) 24 ... Rxe8 55 Qxf6+ Kg8, there’s no more than a draw. 24 ... Qe7\n\nInstead, after 25 ... a4 White could play 26 h6+ followed by 27 Nxf6; whereas in reply to 25 ... g5, White would have played 26 Qg3, threatening 27 Nxf6 and 27 Nxg5, and the defence is difficult. What was the best response to 25 ... gxh5 - ? – Your Move – (after 25 ... gxh5) Answer: White has 26 Nxf6! (1 point) and Black can’t play 26 ... Qxf6? because 27 Qg3+ wins. – Your Move – 26 Qg3! 2 points. Renewing the threat of Nxf6 and exploiting the fresh weakness at g6. 26 ... a4 After 26 ... Qc7, one convincing line is 27 hxg6 a4 28 Nxf6! (28 Rxf6! is also strong) 28 ... Rxf6 29 Rxf6 Kxf6 30 g7, as pointed out by Tal, and now if 30 ... Qxg7 then 31 Rf1+.\n\n– Your Move – – Your Move – 25 h5! 2 points. This was what White intended with 23 h4, though exact calculation is required. 25 ... h6 Preventing 26 h6, but at some cost.\n\n27 Rxf6! 2 points. The demolition begins. This time 27 Nxf6? is bad and loses 3 points – why? – Your Move – (as Black; after 27 Nxf6)\n\n18\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King Answer: Because of the calm defence 27 ... Ra5!! (3 points), defending the knight; Black wins a piece and the game. 27 ... Rxf6 28 Qxe5 axb3 – Your Move – 29 axb3! 1 point. There is no need to hurry, since White’s position is strong enough to stand the loss of a tempo. 29 ... b6 The pin is very annoying and Black can’t get rid of it without losing material or coming under a mating attack, as Tal pointed out. Let’s examine his variations, first analysed forty years ago, yet they still stand up to the scrutiny of current analysis engines: a) 29 ... Kf7 30 Nxf6 Qxf6 31 Qc7+ etc. b) If 29 ... g5, there’s a win with 30 Rf1 Ra5 31 Qxf6+ Qxf6 32 Rxf6 and the h6-pawn will soon be lost. c) After 29 ... gxh5, it’s best to continue as in the game, although 30 Nxf6 is also strong, as after 30 ... Qxf6 31 Qc7+ Kg6 32 Qxc8, Black’s king is too exposed. In this last line, why is 30 Rf1 inferior? – Your Move – (as Black; after 30 Rf1) Answer: Because Black can force an exchange of queens and reach a satisfactory position with the counter-blow 30 ... Ra5! (2 points).\n\n– Your Move – 30 b4! 1-0 2 points. This is best, as “the threat is stronger than the execution” (Nimzowitsch, and others). It prevents ... Ra5 and at the same time maintains all the threats. Mikhail Tal vs. Istvan Bilek, Miskolc 1963. Some lessons from this game: 1. “In for a penny, in for a pound”. (9 f4!) 2. Sometimes, even against a strong tactician, it’s necessary to enter complications. (11 ... b5!, 13 ... b5!) 3. Preventing the opponent’s activity can be as important as activating one’s own forces. (13 ... cxd4?, 13 ... b5!, 13 ... b6!) 4. Don’t forget to ‘invite everyone to the party’, bringing fresh forces into the attack. (16 Ne4!, 18 Rad1!, 23 h4!) 5. Beautiful sacrifices were always present when Tal was on the attack. (16 Ne4!, 27 Rxf6!) Italics refer to variations, as opposed to moves actually played. How did you do? (Maximum score: 45 points) More than 39 points: Super-Grandmaster. Between 35 and 39 points: Grandmaster. Between 29 and 34 points: International Master. Between 21 and 28 points: You play almost like Tal! Between 10 and 20 points: You found several key attacking moves. Less than 10 points: You must keep trying.\n\n19\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King Game 3 White: You Black: Master Caro-Kann Defence [B15] 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 b5\n\n– Your Move – Choose between 6 Bd3, 6 Ng3, and 6 Nc5.\n\nAn unusual move, typical of the player with the black pieces, for whom the “creative element predominates over the practical”, in the words of the White player. 4 a3 This was played after some twenty minutes’ thought; the White player came to the conclusion that isn’t possible to refute 3 ... b5 immediately, so he made a move that kept nearly all his options open. He considered that there were several reasonable responses, such as 4 e5 or 4 Bd3, but in the latter case, after 4 ... b4 5 Nce2 dxe4 6 Bxe4 Nf6 7 Bd3 g6, he thought that the early advance of the b-pawn justified itself. From now on, at every move, it will be necessary to evaluate which side is favoured by the inclusion of the moves ... b7-b5 and a2a3, in comparison with the ‘normal’ positions. 4 ... dxe4 5 Nxe4 Bf5 It is also possible to play 5 ... Nf6, and after 6 Nxf6+ exf6, the advance c2-c4 is hindered, thanks to 3 ... b5.\n\n6 Bd3 2 points. No great courage is required to sacrifice the d-pawn, as after 6 ... Qxd4 7 Nf3 Qd5 (or 7 ... Qd8) 8 Qe2 etc, White gets a lot of compensation. Of course it was also possible to continue as if the moves ... b7-b5 and a2-a3 had not been inserted. After 6 Ng3 (1 point) 6 ... Bg6 7 Nf3 Nd7 8 h4 etc, the line without these moves is very popular, but the inclusion of ... b7-b5 favours Black, “since it begins a struggle for the occupation of the central d5-square” (Tal); when a black knight reaches d5 it will not be easily dislodged, since the move c2-c4 will be less effective. On the other hand, 6 Nc5 (0 points) is less promising, because now (thanks to the insertion of 3 ... b5) there’s no pawn on b7 to be attacked; Black can play 6 ... e6, 6 ... Nd7 or even 6 ... e5. 6 ... Bxe4 7 Bxe4 Nf6 8 Bd3 White again thought for quite a long time here, 8 Bf3 suggested itself, targeting c6 and controlling the long diagonal, but he considered that Black would play 8 ... e6, followed by “ ... Bd6, ... Qc7, ... 0-0 and then at some point prepare the freeing advance ... e5.” In reply to a3-a4 Black would play ... b5-b4, preventing the opening of lines on the queenside. Maybe it’s just a matter of taste, though. After 8 Bf3 e6 9 Ne2 Bd6 White can play, for 20\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King example, 10 Nc3 a6 11 a4 b4 12 Ne4 Nxe4 13 Bxe4 0-0 14 g3!? (but not 14 0-0? Bxh2+!), reaching a pleasant position.\n\n– Your Move – – Your Move – (as Black) 8 ... e6 1 point. Black continues with his development, just as the winner was expecting. 8 ... g6 (1 point) is of similar value. Nevertheless, after 8 ... Qxd4! (2 points) the engines are more or less in agreement with the winner, who wrote that “White has the initiative and a good position for the pawn, but it can hardly be said that this is adequate compensation.” After 9 Nf3 the chess engines like 9 ... Qd6, although there are other playable queen moves as well. White chose his move on the basis of ‘playing the man’, since he knew that Black disliked “positions in which, for a minimal material advantage, he has to conduct a lengthy, painstaking, and relatively cheerless defence.” 9 Nf3 Be7\n\n10 Qe2 1 point. White wants to keep open the possibility of queenside castling, since, in his words, “the advance of Black’s queenside pawns appears fairly harmless.” He also wanted to delay a decision about where to develop his queen’s bishop. Very soon, however, he changed his mind, because in a position with a definite advantage there’s no point in complicating the game. With this in mind, we can safely conclude that it was better to play the immediate 10 0-0! (2 points) Another interesting idea is 10 a4, forcing 10 ... b4, followed by 11 Ne5 and 12 0-0 with the initiative (2 points).\n\n– Your Move – (as Black) Choose between 10 ... Nbd7 and 10 ... 0-0. 10 ... Nbd7 2 points. Black also delays committing his king. If then 11 Bd2, preparing queenside castling, Black can play 11 ... Qc7 and, after 12 0-0-0, he can follow suit with 12 ... 0-0-0. White considered the following variation: 13 c4 bxc4 14 Bxc4 Nb6, “and with the d5-square in his hands Black can look to the future with reasonable optimism.” So once again 3 ... b5 would have been justified. Of course 10 ... 0-0 (1 point) was playable as well. 11 0-0 0-0\n\n21\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King\n\n– Your Move – Choose between 12 Re1 and 12 Ne5. 12 Re1 1 point. White refrained from the immediate 12 Ne5 (0 points) – why?\n\n– Your Move – (as Black; after 12 Ne5) Answer: Because after 12 ... Nxe5 13 dxe5 Nd7, followed by 14 ... Nc5, Black can eliminate the strong d3-bishop with a good position (2 points). If 14 Rd1 then 14 ... Qc7; and there’s no time to prepare a retreat to c2 with 14 c3 because of 14 ... Nxe5!. White can win a pawn with 14 Qe4 g6 15 Qxc6 Nxe5 16 Qxb5, but after 16 ... Nxd3 17 Qxd3 Qxd3 18 cxd3 Rfd8 19 Rd1 Bf6 etc, Black gets excellent compensation. Something similar happens following 15 Bh6 Re8 16 Qxc6 Nxe5 17 Qxb5, when Black can play 17 ... Nxd3 18 Qxd3 Qxd3 19 cxd3 Reb8 20 b4 (if 20 Rab1 then 20 ... Rb3) 18 ... a5 etc, or simply 17 ... Bd6. 12 ... Re8 Aiming to reinforce his king’s position; 12 ... a6, preparing ... c6-c5, was also worth considering. What would happen after 12 ... Qc7 - ?\n\n– Your Move – (after 12 ... Qc7) Answer: There are several ‘normal’ moves, such as 13 Bd2 (1 point), but 13 Ne5 (2 points) is sharper, and after 13 ... Nxe5 14 dxe5 Nd7, White has time for 15 c3 (or 15 c4), and then if 15 ... Nc5, it’s possible to play 16 Bc2.\n\n– Your Move – 13 Ne5 1 point. This threatens the c6-pawn and so prevents Black from strengthening his kingside with 13 ... Nf8. 13 ... Nxe5 14 dxe5 Nd5\n\nThis was one of the main ideas behind 3 ... b5: to gain a strong position for the knight on d5, without fearing the immediate c2-c4. The advance ... a7-a5-a4 is also on the agenda, consolidating the knight’s position. Since the e5-pawn is now defended, there’s no point in playing 14 ... Nd7?, as after 15 Qe4 22\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King there will be no compensation for losing a pawn.\n\n– Your Move – 15 Qg4 2 points. Black has obtained a strong centralized knight, but this has left his king rather short of defenders. Since there’s nothing immediately decisive, White tries to slowly build up an attacking position, first putting pressure on g7. 15 Qe4 (0 points) forces 15 ... g6, but the queen is less well placed on e4, and after 16 Bh6, Black can answer 16 ... Bg5 with a good position and a safe king.\n\n– Your Move – (as Black) 15 ... a5? Black doesn’t see any reason to act on the kingside and continues with his plan. There is logic in his choice; he wants to play ... a5-a4, but this move loses 2 points. The complete answer is given after White’s 18th move.\n\nWhite has the enemy king in his sights, so he doesn’t want to create any distraction on the opposite wing with moves like 16 a4 or 16 c4. Nor does he want to make a committal move, such as 16 Bh6, which would only force Black into a useful move in reply. (0 points for any of these.) 16 ... Bxh4\n\n– Your Move – 17 g3 1 point. The first step. 17 ... Be7\n\n– Your Move – 18 Kg2 1 point. This was the idea; White was happy to pay the price of a pawn to gain an open file against Black’s king with tempo. Going back, and completing the answer to the question posed at Black’s fifteenth move, it was better to anticipate White’s h2-h4-h5 idea by playing 15 ... g6! (4 points); then if White wants to continue as in the game with 16 h4, this time it would be “a pawn sacrifice whose consequences are not altogether clear”, according to the winner. After 16 ... Bxh4, a possible continuation would be 17 g3 Be7 18 Kg2 h5! etc. Black was afraid of 16 b3, aiming for c2-c4, but the winner believed that with 16 ... a5, followed by ... a5-a4, Black would get a good position, since 17 c4 Nc3! leaves the knight well placed, hampering the activity of White’s forces.\n\n– Your Move – 16 h4! 4 points. Played with the idea of h4-h5-h6, to weaken the dark squares around Black’s king. After 17 h5, Black will also face the threat of 18 Bh6 Bf8 19 Bxg7 Bxg7 20 h6. Black is almost forced to accept the pawn sacrifice.\n\n23\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King White can play 19 Rh1, but after 19 ... Qxe5 there isn’t anything concrete. – Your Move – 19 Rh1 1 point. Of course! 19 ... Bf8 What punishment can be meted out if Black counter-attacks against the e5-pawn by playing 19 ... Qc7 now?\n\n– Your Move – (as Black) Choose between 18 ... b4, 18 ... g6, 18 ... Bf8, and 18 ... Qc7. 18 ... g6 (0 points) Black restricts the activity of the d3bishop for the moment, but White’s attack continues anyway. After 18 ... Bf8 (0 points) White would answer 19 Rh1, and if 19 ... f5 then 20 Qh5! is very strong; for example, after 20 ... h6 21 Qg6 Kh8, the black king’s position is demolished by 22 Bxh6! gxh6 23 Rxh6+ Bxh6 24 Rh1 Ne3+ 25 fxe3 Qd5+ 26 e4, winning. It would be better to play 19 ... g6, when we could transpose to the game. What would happen following a neutral move, such as 18 ... b4 - ? (0 points). – Your Move – (after 18 ... b4) Answer: 19 Bxh7+? (deduct 2 points) is tempting, but it doesn’t win: after 19 ... Kxh7 20 Qh5+ Kg8 21 Rh1, either 21 ... f5 or 21 ... f6 seems to force White to take a draw with 22 Qh8+ Kf7 23 Qh5+. 19 Rh1! (2 points) is stronger, and after 19 ... g6 20 Bxg6! hxg6 (worse is 20 ... fxg6? 21 Qxe6+ Kg7 22 Bh6+ Kh8 23 Qf7 etc) 21 Qh3 Bh4 22 Qxh4 Qxh4 23 Rxh4, White threatens 24 Bg5 and Rah1. To answer the initial question, the best option was 18 ... Qc7! (3 points), increasing the pressure on the important e5-pawn. If then 19 Bxh7+ Kxh7 20 Qh5+ Kg8 21 Rh1, there’s only a draw once again after 21 ... f6 or 21 ... f5.\n\n– Your Move – (after 19 ... Qc7) Answer: 20 Rxh7! (2 points) is crushing: 20 ... Kxh7 (if 20 ... Qxe5 then 21 Rxf7! wins, but not 21 Bxg6? as after 21 ... Nf6!, the attack is surprisingly halted) 21 Qh5+ Kg7 22 Qh6+ Kg8 23 Bxg6! with mate in a few moves. What would happen after 19 ... Ra7, defending along the second rank? – Your Move – (after 19 ... Ra7) Answer: White again wins by executing his main threat: 20 Rxh7! (3 points) and if 20 ... Kxh7 21 Qh5+ Kg7 22 Qh6+ Kg8, there comes a second sacrifice with 23 Bxg6! fxg6 24 Qxg6+ Kh8 25 Qh6+ Kg8 26 Qxe6+ Kg7 27 Qh6+ Kg8 28 Qg6+ Kh8, and now 29 Bg5! looks decisive, though as Lev Psakhis points out, it isn’t quite over yet. His main variation is based on the brilliant defensive resource 29 ... Nf4+!, and after 30 Bxf4 Bh4! 31 Rh1 Rf8! 32 Qxc6 Rg7 33 Qe4 Rg4, there’s only one good move for White. Can you find it? 24\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King\n\n– Your Move – (after 32 ... Rg4) Answer: White wins with 33 Kf3! (2 points) 33 ... Qg5 34 Ke3! and “having performed a swift forced march into the middle of the board, the white monarch takes personal command at the head of his forces!” (Psakhis) – Your Move – 20 Bg5! 3 points. “This intermediate move is necessary,” as the winner said. It is clearly better than 20 Qh3 (0 points) 20 ... h5 21 g4 h4 22 g5 Bg7, as now the c1-bishop is unable to join in the attack. The direct 20 Rxh7? (deduct 2 points) 20 ...

Qh5 and we reach an equal ending after the exchange of queens followed by Bxc6. It is also possible to play 21 ... Qd7! (3 points); e.g. 22 Qh4+ Kg8 23 Rh1 Bg7 24 Qh7+ Kf8 25 Bh6 f5! 26 Qh8+ Ke7 27 Qxg7+ Kd8 and White has compensation for the exchange, but nothing more. 24 Bf6 Nxf6 25 exf6 is no better, since Black has the now familiar resource 25 ... Qd5+, followed by 26 ... Qh5. 20 ... Qc7 After 20 ... Be7, the sacrifice 21 Rxh7! wins; e.g. 21 ... Bxg5 22 Rah1 Kf8 23 Rxf7+! (23 Bxg6 wins as well) 23 ... Kxf7 24 Bxg6+! with a decisive attack: after 24 ... Kxg6 Black is mated in four moves, starting with 25 Qe4+. 20 ... Ne7 can be punished either by 21 Bf6, or directly with 21 Bxg6! hxg6 (or 21 ... fxg6 22 Qxe6+ Kh8 23 Rxh7+! Kxh7 24 Rh1+ Bh6 25 Qf7+, mating) 22 Qh4 Bg7 23 Qh7+ Kf8 24 Bf6 with a winning attack. 20 ... Qd7 was another possible defence, when the sacrifice 21 Rxh7 is unclear, but here White has 21 Qh4! with a decisive attack after 21 ... h5 22 g4 Bg7 23 Rae1! etc.\n\n– Your Move – – Your Move – (as Black; after 21 Bg5) Answer: There are two good responses.

Concrete play, rather than general considerations! Instead, 22 Rah1? (deduct 2 points), chosen on the principle of ‘adding more attacking pieces’, is inferior here, since Black has 22 ... f5! (possibly 22 ... Bg7 23 Bh6 Bxh6, followed by 24 ... Nf6!, isn’t losing either) and there’s no mate after 23 Qh3 Bg7 24 Bh6 Ra7 etc. 22 ... Kxf7?! This loses quickly. 22 ... Bh6 was better, though Black still faces a very difficult defensive task after 23 Bxh6 Kxf7 24 Bxg6+ Ke7 25 Bxe8 Rxe8 26 c3 etc.\n\n– Your Move – (after 24 ... Kh8) Answer: 25 Rh1?! (deduct 1 point) is unclear after 25 ... Bg7!, or similarly 25 Qh5?! (deduct 1 point) 25 ... Re7! etc. The best move is 25 Bg6! (3 points), threatening 26 Qh5+ and mate; while after 25 ... Bg7, White wins with 26 Bf7!. 24 ... Bg7 25 Bd7 Nc7 This loses a second pawn, but 25 ... Ne3+ 26 Bxe3 Qd5+ 27 Qf3 Qxd7 28 Rd1 also leads to a hopeless position for Black, as the winner pointed out. 26 Bxc6\n\n– Your Move – 23 Bxg6+! 2 points. Neat, but also necessary, preventing the coordination of Black’s forces. 23 ... Kg8 Or 23 ... Kxg6 24 Bf4+ etc. 24 Bxe8\n\nThe rest is easy. 26 ... Rf8 27 Rd1 Qc5 28 Bf3 Qxc2 29 Rd7 Rf7 30 Rd8+ Rf8 31 Bf6 Qh7 32 Be4 Qh6 33 Bg5 Qh8 34 Rd7 1-0\n\n26\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King 34 Rxf8+ Kxf8 35 Qf4+ etc was also sufficient. Mikhail Tal vs. Bukhuti Gurgenidze, USSR Championship, Alma Ata 1968. Some lessons from this game: 1. It’s very useful to know something about your opponent, such as his likes and dislikes. (8 Bd3!) 2. Sometimes it isn’t easy to distinguish between a position where it’s best just to make a flexible move and one where the moment to take decisive action has arrived and precise calculation is required. (8 ... Qxd4!, 10 0-0!, 15 ... g6!) 3. A prophylactic move, anticipating the opponent’s attacking ideas, is sometimes necessary. Again, accurate calculation is needed. (15 ... g6!) 4. As we mentioned earlier, beautiful moves and sacrifices were very often a feature of Tal’s attacking games. (16 h4!, 21 Rxh7!, 22 Rxf7!, 23 Bxg6+!) 5. A chess masterpiece needs not only to be beautiful, but also to be backed up by very accurate moves. (20 Bg5! vs. 20 Rxh7? Kxh7 21 Bg5, 22 Rxf7! vs. 22 Rah1?) Italics refer to variations, as opposed to moves actually played. How did you do? (Maximum score: 55 points) More than 45 points: Super-Grandmaster. Between 39 and 45 points: Grandmaster. Between 30 and 38 points: International Master. Between 21 and 29 points: Very well played! Between 10 and 20 points: Your attacking skills continue to improve! Less than 10 points: You need to be more careful next time!\n\nGame 4 White: You Black: Master Ruy Lopez [C95] 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 a6 4 Ba4 Nf6 5 0-0 Be7 6 Re1 b5 7 Bb3 d6 8 c3 0-0 9 h3 Nb8 10 d4 Nbd7 11 Nbd2 Bb7\n\n12 Bc2 This is a well-known position from the Breyer Variation of the Ruy Lopez. With this move White defends the e4-pawn, so that he can execute the typical Spanish knight manoeuvre Nf1-g3 (or sometimes Nf1-e3, though not in this case). Another possibility is to play 11 a4 c5 and then decide between 12 d5 and 12 Bc2. 12 ... Re8 13 Nf1 Bf8 14 Ng3 g6 15 a4 c5 16 d5 c4 This move, clearing c5 for the knight, has replaced the older 16 ... Nb6. 17 Bg5 Trying to provoke ... h7-h6; the less popular alternative is to play 17 Be3 immediately. 17 ... h6 Black sees no problem in allowing himself to be provoked; other moves played are 17 ... Bg7 and 17 ... Rb8. 18 Be3 Rb8 And here 18 ... Nc5 and 18 ... Bg7 are more common choices.\n\n27\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King\n\n– Your Move –\n\nAnswer: Since White’s plan is to advance with f2-f4, the most logical move is to play 21 f4 (2 points) at once, as the winner pointed out. Preparing the pawn advance with a ‘useful’ move such as 21 Rf1 (1 point) is also logical, although in that case it’s necessary to ascertain who derives the greater benefit from the following continuation: 21 ... h4 22 Ne2 Nh5, which was Black’s intended response – even though Black has weakened his king position, the consequences of a subsequent f2-f4 would now be less clear. 21 Nxh7 Kxh7\n\n19 Qd2 1 point. This was the idea of 17 Bg5, to attack the h6-pawn with tempo. Now Black has to decide what to do about his attacked pawn. 19 ... h5 Intending to stabilize the kingside with ... Nh7, ... Be7 and ... h5-h4. What would you play against 19 ... Kh7, the other logical move here? – Your Move – (after 19 ... Kh7) Answer: There are two reasonable plans. One is to play on the queenside with 20 b3 or 20 b4 (almost forcing Black to take on b3), or perhaps prepare it by playing 20 Reb1 first. The other option is to focus on the kingside with 20 Nh2, preparing the breakthrough with f2-f4 and trying to take advantage of the closed centre; this was what White intended to play. You get 1 point for choosing either of these plans. 20 Ng5 White immediately occupies the weakened square. 20 ... Nh7 Black tackles the intruder right away; 20 ... Be7 was another idea – how would you play in that case? – Your Move – (after 20 ... Be7)\n\n– Your Move – 22 Rf1 1 point. “There is nothing new under the sun.” This prepares f2-f4 again. 22 ... Kg8 – Your Move – Choose between 23 Kh1 and 23 f4. 23 Kh1 0 points. Even though the position is closed, and so time is a less important factor than in open positions, it’s nevertheless questionable whether evacuating the king from the g1-a7 diagonal is strictly necessary. 23 f4 (1 point) is preferable, as the winner admitted. 23 ... Bg7\n\n28\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King Bf6, White has succeeded in weakening Black’s castled position with advantage after, for example, 28 ... Bxf6 29 Rxf6 Nd7, and now some deep calculation is required before deciding between 30 Nxh5 Re5 31 Rf5, or 30 Rf5 immediately, or the modest 30 Rf2 – in all cases White’s position is the more promising. Going back in this line, what would happen if Black plays, not 27 ... Qc7, but 27 ... f6 - ?\n\n– Your Move – 24 axb5 3 points. This pawn exchange will give White greater freedom of action. Again 24 f4 (1 point) was also playable, but after the planned 24 ... exf4 25 Bxf4 h4 26 Ne2 Nc5 27 axb5, besides 27 ... axb5 (transposing to 26 ... h4 27 Ne2 Nc5 in the game), Black can play 27 ... Nxe4 28 Bxe4 Rxe4 29 bxa6 Ba8 with a complex position; White is a pawn up but also has weaknesses at d5 and b2, and Black has active play. Even less convincing is 27 Bg5 f6 28 Bh6 (here 28 Bxh4 Nxe4 29 Qf4 Qc7, planning ... f6-f5, isn’t worrying for Black) 28 ... Nxe4 29 Bxe4 Rxe4 30 Bxg7 Kxg7 31 Nf4 Bc8! 32 axb5 Rxb5! etc. Opening the a-file at once with 24 axb5 avoids this last possibility. 24 ... axb5 – Your Move – 25 f4 1 point. There are no useful preparatory moves left. 25 ... exf4 26 Bxf4 Qe7 After 26 ... Ne5, the knight occupies a good central square, but this isn’t ideal for Black, since the e4-pawn is under less pressure and White can now improve the position of his knight with 27 Ne2, heading for d4. 26 ... Nc5 is another possibility, but there isn’t yet a threat to take on e4. After 27 Bg5 Qc7 28\n\n– Your Move – (after 27 ... f6) Answer: In that case White can launch a crushing attack with 28 Bxf6! (3 points) 28 ... Bxf6 29 Qh6!; for example, 29 ... Bg7 30 Qxg6 (threatening 31 Rf7) 30 ... Re7 31 e5! (31 Nf5 and 31 Nxh5 are also strong) 31 ... Nd3 32 Ne4 and wins. Black was unsure about the right moment to expel the g3-knight. On 26 ... h4, it’s possible to play 27 Bg5, sacrificing a piece after 27 ... f6 28 Bxh4 g5 29 Nf5 gxh4 30 Nxd6 Re5, when White has undeniable compensation, for example, 31 Qf4 Qc7 (if 31 ... Nc5 then 32 Nf7!) 32 Nxb5 or 32 Nf5. The knight could also simply retreat, as after 27 Ne2 Nc5 28 Bg5 f6 29 Bh6, the move 29 ... Nxe4 is inaccurate – how can this be demonstrated?\n\n29\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King White could also avoid the bishop exchange with the retreat 28 Be3. – Your Move –\n\n– Your Move – (after 29 ... Nxe4) Answer: There could follow 30 Bxe4 Rxe4 31 Bxg7 Kxg7 32 Nf4, and the threatened invasion on e6 forces concessions, because with the afile open 32 ... Bc8?! can now be answered by 33 Ra7+! Re7 34 Qe3! (3 points); for example, 34 ... Rf7 35 Qd4 (threatening 36 Ne6+) 35 ... Rfb7 36 Rxb7 Rxb7 37 Qe4 f5 (not 37 ... Bf5? 38 Qxf5) 38 Qe6!. 27 Bg5\n\n28 Bf4 1 point. There is no need for radical measures yet. The sacrifice 28 Nxh5?! loses 1 point, because there’s nothing special after 28 ... gxh5 29 Rf5 Qg3. Here White’s best course of action is to force a draw with 30 Rf3 Qe5 31 Rf5 etc, because neither 30 Bf4 Qg6 31 Rg5 Qf6, nor 31 e5 dxe5 32 Rxe5 Qb6 33 Rxh5 Rbd8 are good for White. Going back, 27 ... Qe5 receives 1 point, because Black would not be unhappy with a draw, and although that move isn’t ambitious, it isn’t bad either, since Black could change his mind later (29 ... f6). 28 ... Qe7 29 Bg5 Qe5 30 Rf3\n\n– Your Move – (as Black) – Your Move – (as Black) 27 ... Qe5 We shall come back to this move in the next note. Alternatively, 27 ... f6! (2 points) is a good move, since after 28 Bh6, Black has 28 ... Ra8, demonstrating that the opening of the a-file was not exclusively to White’s benefit. In that case Black’s position would be more secure than in the lines we looked at previously.\n\n30 ... Ra8?! Black sees no danger and occupies the open file, trusting in his defensive resources on the kingside. This move receives 0 points. It was better to create a weakness on c3 with 30 ... b4! (4 points), and after 31 Raf1 (or 31 Ba4 Ra8!) 31 ... bxc3 32 bxc3 Rf8, the black kingside is solid enough, even if White’s prospects are slightly better after 33 Ne2 (Tal), but not now 33 Nxh5?! because of 33 ... gxh5 34 Rf5? Qxc3. 31 Raf1 30\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King – Your Move – (as Black) Choose between 31 ... Rf8 and 31 ... f6. 31 ... Rf8? Black wants to keep the a1-h8 diagonal open, which looks right, but in this position tactical factors are predominant and choosing this move loses 2 points. By a process of elimination, 31 ... f6! (3 points) should have been played, when Black’s position is tenable.\n\n34 Bh6?! f6! isn’t any good either. 34 ... dxe5 On 34 ... Nxe5, the reply is 35 Bf6! and the black kingside is defenceless; for instance, 35 ... Ng6 (or 35 ... Bxf6 36 Rxf6 Ng6 37 Qh6 and wins) 36 Bxg7 (or 36 Rxh5, when 36 ... Bxf6? 37 Qh6! mates) 36 ... Kxg7 37 Rxh5 Rh8 38 Bxg6! fxg6 39 Qd4+. Let’s deal with Black’s other possible defensive tries: – Your Move – (after 34 ... Bxe5)\n\n– Your Move – 32 Nxh5! 3 points. Now White’s attack will be irresistible. There was an alternative which was equally strong, but more ‘computer-like’: 32 Nf5! (3 points), which threatens 33 Bf4; then 32 ... gxf5 33 Rxf5 would transpose to the game. 32 ... gxh5?! It was better just to accept the loss of the pawn. 33 Rf5 Qe8 Now 33 ... Qg3 loses the queen after 34 R1f3 Ra1+ 35 Bd1 etc.\n\nAnswer: After 34 ... Bxe5, the strongest move is 35 Bf6! (2 points) and the attack prevails; e.g. 35 ... Bxf6 36 Rg5+! (or 36 Qh6!) 36 ... Bg7 37 Rxg7+! Kxg7 38 Qg5+ and mate in three moves. – Your Move – (after 34 ... f6) Answer: After 34 ... f6, White wins by 35 exf6 Nxf6 36 Bxf6 Rxf6 37 Rxf6 Bxf6, and if you planned 38 Qh6! then you earn 3 points. Instead, 38 Rxf6? fails to 38 ... Ra1+ 39 Kh2 Qe5+ and the win slips away. 35 Bh6 Ra6 Black tries to bring more forces to the defence. Closing lines with 35 ... f6 was no longer effective – why not? – Your Move – (after 35 ... f6) Answer: Black’s position falls apart after 36 Bxg7 Kxg7 37 Rg5+! (2 points) 37 ... Kf7 (or 37 ... Kh8 38 Rg3 and mate in four moves) 38 Bg6+ etc. 36 Bxg7 Kxg7\n\n– Your Move – 34 e5!! 4 points. “Awakening the sleeping giant” at c2; White now threatens to exchange a vital black defender with Bf6. The immediate 34 Bf6? fails to 34 ... Nxf6 35 Rxf6 Bxf6 36 Rxf6 Qe5, since if 37 Rf5 then 37 ... Ra1+! wins.\n\n– Your Move – 37 d6! 2 points. Cutting the lines of communication between the two flanks. Instead, 37 Qg5+? (deduct 2 points) gives White no more than a draw after 37 ... Rg6 38 Rxf7+ Rxf7 39 Qxg6+ Kf8 40 Qh6+ Ke7. 31\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King 37 ... f6 Vacating the f8-square for the king with 37 ... Rh8 fails to 38 Qg5+ Kf8 39 Rxf7+ Qxf7 40 Qe7+ etc.\n\n– Your Move – 38 Rg5+! 2 points. The final blow – the attack by all four white pieces will be unstoppable. 38 ... Kf7 Giving up the queen, but there’s nothing better: 38 ... fxg5 39 Qxg5+ leads to mate in two; while after 38 ... Kh8, both 39 Rg4 and 39 Rg3 win. 39 Bg6+ Ke6 40 Bf5+ Kf7 41 Qd1! There are several winning moves here, but this is the most elegant. 41 ... Rh8 41 ... fxg5 leads to mate after 42 Qxh5+ Kf6 43 Qh6+ Kf7 44 Qg6 or 44 Be6. 42 Bg6+ Ke6 43 Bxe8 Rxe8 44 Qxh5 Rd8 45 Rg7 Kxd6 46 Qf7 1-0\n\nas important as advancing one’s own.” (27 ... f6!, 30 ... Ra8?, 30 ... b4!) 3. Tal never neglected to involve as many pieces as possible in the attack, while at the same time hindering the reorganization of opponent’s defensive forces. (34 e5!, 37 d6!) 4. Let’s note once again the brilliant sacrifices ever-present when Tal was on the attack. (32 Nxh5!, 34 e5!, 38 Rg5+!) Italics refer to variations, as opposed to moves actually played. How did you do? (Maximum score: 46 points) More than 40 points: Super-Grandmaster. Between 35 and 40 points: Grandmaster. Between 28 and 36 points: International Master. Between 20 and 27 points: You are a master of the Ruy Lopez! Between 10 and 19 points: Good tactical vision! Less than 10 points: Better luck in the next game.\n\nMikhail Tal vs. Boris Spassky, Tilburg 1980. Some lessons from this game: 1. When is it useful to maintain the tension? When is it necessary to release it? There are no easy answers; these are difficult skills to learn. (23 Kh1?, 23 f4!, 24 axb5!, 30 ... Ra8?, 30 ... b4!, 31 ... Rf8?) 2. Something we have already seen and shall see again: “Preventing the opponent’s plan is\n\n32\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King Game 5 White: You Black: Master Pirc Defence [B08] 1 e4 d6 2 d4 Nf6 3 Nc3 g6 4 Nf3 Bg7 5 h3 This move used to be very popular; it controls g4 and thus prepares Be3. It was later replaced by 5 Be3, since it was found that ... Ng4 isn’t a problem (White responds with Bg5), and so h2-h3 can kept in reserve for when it’s really necessary. 5 ... 0-0 6 Be3 a6 7 a4 White prevents expansion with ... b7-b5, but now castling queenside is much less appealing. 7 ... b6 8 Bc4\n\nWhite chooses the most active development for his bishop; it could also go to d3 or e2, or White could play 8 Qd2.\n\nThe other developing move 8 ... Nc6 (0 points) is no better; White would continue as in the game. More prudent, and also more accurate, is 8 ... e6! (2 points). – Your Move – (after 8 ... Bb7?!) Choose between 9 e5, 9 d5, and 9 Nd2. 9 e5 2 points. “In a greater sense this move is forced and both players follow a narrow tactical play.” (Seirawan) Any other choice loses 1 point. 9 d5?! is illogical, as it blocks the bishop’s diagonal; Black could respond with 9 ... Nbd7 and ... Nc5, or 9 ... c6, opening the c-file in his favour. Or on 9 Nd2?!, Black can take advantage of the bishop on c4 to react strongly with 9 ... d5!. 9 ... Ne4 Of course the passive 9 ... Ne8 was not part of Black’s plan, and 10 e6 might follow. The ending isn’t fully satisfactory either. After, for example, 9 ... dxe5 10 dxe5 Ne4 (not 10 ... Nfd7?! because of 11 e6) 11 Bxf7+! Kxf7 12 Nxe4 Bxe4 13 Ng5+ Kg8 14 Nxe4 Bxe5 15 Bh6 Qxd1+ 16 Rxd1 Re8 17 c3, White has the superior structure and a clear advantage. 10 Nxe4 Bxe4\n\n– Your Move – (as Black) Choose between 8 ... Bb7, 8 ... e6, and 8 ... Nc6. 8 ... Bb7?! This is a developing move, but it’s also rather provocative. Black reckons that the hardly very active moves h2-h3 and a2-a4 don’t fit together very well; they are not bad moves, but as Black hasn’t done anything ‘wrong’, he should be able to deal with any premature attack. While this is correct in theory, practice is a different matter and tactics will override any other factors.\n\n– Your Move – Choose between 11 e6, 11 0-0, and 11 Ng5. 11 Ng5! 4 points. Consistent with White’s previous aggressive play. The quiet 11 0-0 (0 points) 33\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King causes Black no problems, and 11 ... dxe5 12 Nxe5 Nc6 is equal. After 11 e6 (0 points), the white centre loses its mobility and doesn’t look dangerous – with 11 ... f5, followed for example by ... d6-d5, ... f5-f4, ... Nc6 etc, Black has a decent position. – Your Move – (as Black) 11 ... Bxg2 2 points. This was Black’s intention in playing 8 ... Bb7 and it’s a case of “in for a penny, in for a pound”. There was really no decent alternative. After 11 ... d5 (deduct 1 point), a possible continuation is 12 Nxe4 dxc4 (not 12 ... dxe4? 13 Qg4) 13 0-0, when Black’s structure is inferior and the g7-bishop remains passive. After 11 ... Bb7 (deduct 1 point), 12 e6 is now strong. The engines don’t like Black’s position after 12 ... f5 13 d5 Bxb2 14 Bd4 Bxa1 15 Qxa1 – even though he is the exchange and a pawn up, he is playing without his queenside pieces (besides, the exchange can be recovered at any time with Bh6) – or 14 ... Bxd4 15 Qxd4, followed by h3-h4, and Black’s position is dubious. 12 Rg1 Bc6 A tough decision; it was impossible to be sure which square was better, c6 or b7. With the move chosen, Black wants to have ... Be8 available, and he also targets the a4-pawn.\n\n4 points. Charge! White just masses his pieces on the kingside, ignoring the fate of the e5pawn. The alternative was 13 e6 (1 point), but closing the position is something White should think twice about; Seirawan gives 13 ... f6 14 Nf7 Qc8 15 d5 Be8 16 Nh6+ Kh8, and “White has overextended himself.” 13 ... e6 With so many pieces attacking Black’s king, taking the pawn with 13 ... dxe5 looks extremely risky. White could simply respond with 14 dxe5, but there’s a more concrete continuation – what is it? – Your Move – (after 13 ... dxe5) Answer: The most straightforward response is 14 Nxh7! (2 points), since the attack is unstoppable after 14 ... Kxh7? 15 Qh4+ Kg8 16 Rxg6 etc. Actually, there is more than one convincing continuation. Also playable is 14 Qh4! (2 points), and if 14 ... h6 then 15 Ne6! is very strong; e.g. 15 ... fxe6 16 Bxh6 Qxd4 (or 16 ... Bd5 17 Rxg6 Rf7 18 Bxg7 Rxg7 19 Rxg7+ Kxg7 and now, for instance, 20 Ra3 followed by Rg3+) 17 Bxe6+ Rf7 18 Rg4 Qxb2 19 Rd1! with a decisive attack. White might also play 15 Nxf7! Rxf7 16 Rxg6 Bd5 and now, for instance, 17 Bxh6 Bxc4 18 0-0-0, followed by Rdg1 and Qg5. 14 0-0-0 Nd7 Targeting e5; Black accepts the challenge of hand-to-hand combat, trusting in his defensive resources. More prudent is 14 ... Qe7, but not necessarily better. Black defends e6 and f7, and hopes to play ... b6-b5 and maybe ... h7-h5 (this idea requires having ... Be8 available). White would continue as in the game.\n\n– Your Move – 13 Qg4!\n\n34\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King How would you refute 18 ... Rfe8 - ?\n\n– Your Move – 15 h4! 4 points. Consistent with his main idea – White wants to open lines. There are various sacrificial possibilities instead, but the position isn’t yet ripe for these: There is no advantage in 15 Nxf7 (0 points) 15 ... Rxf7 16 Qxe6 d5! (even better than 16 ... Qf8 17 Qxf7+ Qxf7 18 Bxf7+ Kxf7 19 d5 Bxd5 20 Rxd5 Nxe5, when the two pawns give Black decent compensation for the exchange) 17 Qxc6 dxc4 18 e6 Rf6 19 Qxd7 Qxd7 20 exd7 Rd6 with an equal ending. 15 Bxe6 (0 points) doesn’t yield anything concrete either. After 15 ... fxe6 16 Qxe6+ Kh8 17 Nxh7 Qe8 18 Nxf8 Nxf8 19 Qxe8 Bxe8 20 exd6 cxd6, even though White has two pawns and a rook for the two minor pieces, his rooks are ineffective, while the black pieces can soon occupy active posts. 15 ... dxe5 Playing ... h7-h5, either now or on the next move, would radically prevent the opening of the h-file but weaken the black kingside even more. Instead, 15 ... Qe7? gives more protection to e6 and f7, but after 16 h5! White’s attack proceeds unchecked; for example, 16 ... dxe5 17 hxg6! (17 Qh3 and 17 Nxh7 are also promising) 17 ... hxg6 18 Qh3, and now 18 ... Nf6 fails to 19 Nxe6! fxe6 20 Bxe6+ Rf7 21 Rxg6 and there’s no defence. Let’s continue this line a little further: 21 ... Kf8 22 dxe5 Ng8 23 Bxf7 Qxf7 24 Rxc6 etc.\n\n– Your Move – (after 18 ... Rfe8) Answer: With 19 Bxe6! fxe6 20 Qh7+ Kf8 21 Qxg6 (2 points), threatening 22 Nxe6+, or if 21 ... Bd5 then 22 Nh7+ Kg8 23 Bh6 etc. – Your Move – 16 dxe5! 3 points. Opening the d-file ... in White’s favour? Exactly so, as we shall see. The alternative, 16 Nxe6! (2 points), at first seems to give White no more than an equal game, but let’s examine it: 16 ... fxe6 17 Qxe6+ Kh8 18 Qxc6 exd4 19 Bxd4?! Bxd4 20 Rxd4, and now – how to continue? – Your Move – (as Black; after 20 Rxd4) Answer: The only move that offers any chances of equality is 20 ... Qf6! (2 points), when 21 Qxd7? is no good because of 21 ... Rad8, while 21 Qxf6+ Nxf6 leads to an approximately equal position, since the superior black structure compensates for White’s greater dynamism. However, White’s play can be improved with 19 Rxd4!, when 19 ... Bxd4? is inadvisable in view of 20 Bxd4+ Nf6 21 Bd5!, followed by h4h5. The best defence is 19 ... Qf6, intending to play 20 ... c5 if the white queen moves; but instead of exchanging the queens and trusting in his pair of bishops, White can play 20 Qh1!!, planning to answer 20 ... c5?! with 21 h5! and a decisive attack. For instance, if 21 ... cxd4? 35\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King then 22 hxg6 just wins; while if Black tries 20 ... h5, then after 21 c3 the continued presence of the queens on the board is a serious threat to the security of the black king. 16 ... Qe7\n\n– Your Move – 17 Rxd7! 5 points. “Both forced and good” (Seirawan) – a very important defender is eliminated. After the natural 17 f4 (1 point), Black first plays 17 ... b5! 18 Ba2 and then regroups with 18 ... Rfd8 19 h5 Nf8 etc, when the kingside defences have been strengthened by the arrival of the knight. 17 ... Bxd7 After 17 ... Qxd7, White’s attack continues unabated; for example, 18 h5 Bd5 19 hxg6 hxg6 20 Qh4 Rfd8 21 Bd3 and Bxg6 is coming – the engines quickly decide that there’s no defence for Black. 18 h5 “Boris is an unstoppable attacking machine,” said Seirawan. 18 ... f5?! “A bad move, which succeeds only in weakening my kingside.” (Seirawan) However, finding a satisfactory defence isn’t easy, as we shall see: a) After 18 ... b5 White, logically, doesn’t take on b5. One possibility is to switch the bishop to a more effective diagonal with 19 Bd3 (the simple 19 hxg6! is another strong continuation), and if 19 ... bxa4 then 20 hxg6 hxg6 21 Qh3 Rfb8 22 Qh7+ Kf8 23 Nxf7! wins,\n\nsince White’s attack is faster; e.g. 23 ... Qxf7 24 Bxg6 Qe7 25 Bh5!, planning Rxg7 and Bh6. If instead, 19 ... Bxe5, another of the sacrifices latent in the position makes its appearance: 20 Nxh7! Rfe8 (20 ... Rfd8 is similar, while 20 ... Kxh7 21 hxg6+ leads to mate in five) 21 Qe4! Bg7 22 hxg6 f6 23 Qh4, intending Bc5!. b) 18 ... h6 doesn’t inspire confidence. White can gain a clear advantage with 19 hxg6! hxg5 20 Bxg5 Qc5 21 Bf6! Qxf2 22 Bxg7! (not 22 gxf7+? Rxf7 23 Bxg7 Qxg1+! 24 Qxg1 Rxg7 and Black is okay) 22 ... Kxg7 (if 22 ... Qxg1+ 23 Qxg1 Kxg7, then 24 Bd3! wins) 23 gxf7+ Kxf7 24 Rf1 and Black’s king is in a bad way. c) At first Black was relying on 18 ... Bxe5 19 Nxh7! Qb4 (not 19 ... Kxh7? 20 hxg6+ and it’s mate in five again) – what should White play here?\n\n– Your Move – (after 19 ... Qb4) Answer: The only winning continuation is 20 Bd4! (2 points). Black was initially going to play 20 ... Qxc4 (20 ... Bxd4 21 Qxd4 Kxh7 22 hxg6+ is another mate in five) 21 Bxe5 Qxg4 22 Nf6+ Kg7, but at the last moment he saw the flaw in his analysis. What had he missed?\n\n36\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King\n\n– Your Move – (after 22 ... Kg7) Answer: 23 Rxg4? (deduct 1 point) gives nothing after 23 ... Bc6 24 h6+ Kxh6 25 f4 (or 25 Rh4+ Kg5 26 Rg4+ Kh6) 25 ... Bf3 26 Rh4+ Bh5, and White must take the draw with 27 Ng4+ Kh7 28 Nf6+ Kh6 etc. White is better after 23 Nxg4+ (1 point) 23 ... f6 24 Nxf6 Rxf6 25 Rxg6+ Kh7 26 Rxf6 Bxa4 etc, but not clearly winning. White can reach a superior rook ending with 23 Nxd7+ (2 points) 23 ... f6 (now 23 ... Kh6 24 Rxg4 Kxh5 25 Nf6+ Kh6 loses to 26 f4!) 24 Rxg4 fxe5 25 Rxg6+ Kh7 26 Nxf8+ Rxf8 27 Rxe6, when White is a pawn up, and although there’s a saying that “all rook endings are drawn”, Black will have to suffer here to prove it. However, there is a clear win with 23 h6+!! (4 points) 23 ... Kh8 (after 23 ... Kxh6 24 Nxg4+ Kg5 25 Ne3+ mate soon follows) 24 Rxg4 Bc6, when Black is paralysed and can only watch while White weaves a mating net; for example with 25 Rg3, controlling f3 (to prevent the manoeuvre ... Bf3-h5), followed by h6-h7 and Ng8+.\n\n– Your Move – Choose between 19 exf6 and 19 Qh3. 19 Qh3! 2 points. The correct move, not deviating from the chosen path. Instead, 19 exf6? (deduct 2 points) breathes fresh life into Black’s position – he is more active after 19 ... Qxf6, attacking b2 and with ... Qf5 on the agenda. Then 20 Bxe6+?! doesn’t work, as after 20 ... Bxe6 21 Qxe6+ Kh8!, Black’s material advantage is significant. 19 ... f4 Black tries to block the e3-bishop’s access to the kingside. How would you finish the game after ... h6 - ? – Your Move – (after 19 ... h6) Answer: White wins with the simple 20 hxg6 (1 point) and after, for example, 20 ... Bxe5, both 21 Nf7 and 21 Qxh6 Qg7 22 Nxe6 Qxh6 23 Bxh6 etc are winning. Black can prevent h5xg6 with 19 ... gxh5, but then both the g- and h-files are open, and White’s attack is unstoppable after 20 Qxh5 h6 21 Nh3 Kh8 22 Nf4 Qf7 23 Qh4, planning, for example, Nh5 or Be2-h5. 20 hxg6 Bxe5 There is no good defence. What happens after 20 ... h6, which places two white pieces en prise?\n\n37\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King – Your Move –\n\n– Your Move – (after 20 ... h6) Answer: There are several tempting continuations, such as 21 Nxe6? (deduct 1 point), when 21 ... fxe3? loses to 22 Nxf8+ Kxf8 23 Qf3+ etc. Unfortunately, after 21 ... Kh8! White’s pieces really are in danger, and the combinative solution 22 Bd4 Rfe8 23 Nxg7 Bxh3 24 Nxe8 Rxe8 25 g7+ Qxg7 26 Rxg7 Kxg7 27 Bxa6 Be6 leads only to a Black advantage. Nevertheless, as Seirawan pointed out, after 20 ... h6, Black “had no threat to take the g5knight at all. White could just ignore my ‘threat’ and play 21 Bd2!” (3 points), retaining all his attacking options; for example, 21 ... Bxe5 is punished by 22 Nf7! Bg7 23 Bc3 Rfe8, and now there’s a choice between the spectacular 24 Qxh6 and the prosaic 24 Bxg7, both winning. Or after 21 ... Rfe8, White wins with 22 Nf7! Qc5 23 Nxh6+ Kf8 24 Rg4! Re7 (or 24 ... Bxe5 25 g7+ Ke7 26 g8Q Rxg8 27 Nxg8+ etc) 25 Rxf4+ Ke8 26 Ng8 Qxe5 27 Qh4.\n\n21 Nxe6! 3 points. The strongest move, although not the only winning one. White could also play 21 Nf7! (2 points), as after the virtually forced line 21 ... Rxf7 22 gxf7+ Kh8 23 Qg2! Qf8 24 Qe4! White mates, since 24 ... Bg7 is met by 25 Bd3. White’s position is so strong that there are other ways to win, such as 21 Bd2, but these gain no points – we should try to finish the game off as quickly as possible, not prolong the struggle. 21 ... Bxe6 Now 21 ... Kh8 loses to 22 Rh1. 22 Bxe6+ Kg7 Again if 22 ... Kh8, then 23 Rh1 is the quickest solution. 23 gxh7+ 1-0\n\nBoris Spassky vs. Yasser Seirawan, Zürich 1984. Some lessons from this game: 1. Self-confidence is essential, but this can easily be carried too far. (8 ... Bb7?!) 2. With the benefit of hindsight, it’s easy to recommend prudence. (8 ... e6!) 3. “Charge!” – as we read, Seirawan referred to Spassky in this game as an “unstoppable attacking machine”. The former world champion also played many other games which justify this description. It is amazing how many powerful attacking moves White played in this short game. (9 e5!, 11 Ng5!, 13 Qg4!, 15 h4!, 17 Rxd7! etc) 4. The true value of the pieces can vary, depending on the position. Sometimes a sacrifice is justified to prevent a key defensive manoeuvre. This idea can be seen in many combinations. (17 Rxd7!) 5. A good dose of both imagination and precise analysis are indispensable for carrying out such a brilliant attack. Italics refer to variations, as opposed to moves actually played. 38\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King How did you do?

The drawback, compared with the alternative retreat 6 ... Be7, is that the bishop will be missed in the defence of both the kingside and the d6-square. 7 Qe2 White prepares Be3, neutralizing the annoying bishop. The main alternatives are 7 c4 and 7 Qg4. 7 ... Nc6 8 Be3 d6 9 f4\n\n– Your Move – (as Black) Choose between 9 ... b5, 9 ... Nf6, 9 ... Nge7, 9 ... Qc7, and 9 ... Bxe3. 9 ... Qc7 0 points. This is a typical Sicilian move, but it isn’t really essential in this position, as we shall see. The advance 9 ... b5 (deduct 1 point) also looks ‘normal’ but isn’t the most accurate either. When considering what to play, we should always keep in mind the opponent’s possibilities. Since the white knight is still on b1, 10 a4! should first spring to mind; Black then has to choose between two evils: 10 ... 39\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King bxa4 11 Rxa4 activates White’s forces and leaves the a6-pawn weak; while 10 ... b4 is even worse, since after 11 Bxa7 Rxa7 12 0-0 Nf6 13 N1d2 0-0 14 a5, Black has weaknesses on d6 and b6, much to the ‘delight’ of the d2knight. The exchange 9 ... Bxe3 (0 points) 10 Qxe3 just helps White’s development, without any obvious benefits to Black. 9 ... Nf6 (2 points) or 9 ... Nge7 (2 points) are the best choices. For instance: 9 ... Nf6 10 Bxa7 Rxa7 11 c4 (11 Nc3 would be the main alternative) 11 ... 0-0 12 Nc3 b6 13 0-0 Nd7 14 Rad1 Nc5 15 Bb1 Rd7 (this is one reason why 9 ... Qc7 may not be the best – the rook is prevented from going to c7, occupying the c-file, or to d7, as in this case, overprotecting the d6-pawn) and now, after 16 Nd2, Black has 16 ... b5! with good play, as practice has shown. 10 0-0 Nf6 11 Bxa7 The black queen being on c7 makes this a logical choice, as we have seen. Now the white queen has more freedom. 11 ... Rxa7 12 Nc3 b5?!\n\nQuieter moves such as 13 a3 and 13 Qe3, suggested by the winner, deserve only 1 point. 13 ... b4 – Your Move – 14 Nd1 2 points. The best retreat, as the knight has greater mobility via d1-e3 than b1-d2. White now threatens 15 a5, fixing the a6-pawn. Black’s next move solves this problem; on the other hand, the b5-square is relinquished, even if that factor doesn’t seem relevant at this point. 14 ... a5 15 Ne3 In their excellent book, San Luis 2005, Gershon and Nor sum up the position thus: “Initial results of the last three moves: Black weakened b5 and c4; White transferred his knight to a much better position, still eyeing the vital d5-square, only one step away from attacking the black king.” 15 ... 0-0 16 Kh1 Bb7\n\n– Your Move – – Your Move – 13 a4! 3 points. This move is still promising even with the knight on c3. We shall soon appreciate the strength of this advance, so we can quickly conclude that it was better for Black to play a ‘normal’ move such as 12 ... 0-0, postponing a decision about the b-pawn.\n\n17 Ng4! 3 points. Black’s kingside is poorly defended, so no other move is as logical as this one, exchanging the defending knight. No other move receives any points. The a1-rook is the only white piece that isn’t active; this can be easily remedied, but which square it should go to is something to be decided later. Black has now a difficult defensive task.\n\n40\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King – Your Move – (as Black) Choose between 17 ... Nxg4, 17 ... Nd7, and 17 ... Qe7.\n\nplanning to transfer the other knight to the kingside.\n\n17 ... Nxg4 0 points. White is happy with this exchange, which is exactly what he wants – especially in this way, improving the position of his queen, while Black gets almost nothing in return. After 17 ... Nd7?! (deduct 1 point), retaining the knight for the defence, White can prepare the f4-f5 advance with 18 Qf2, followed by Qg3, or 18 Rf3 and Rg3, though it’s possibly best just to play 18 f5 immediately. Black’s best option is to draft in another defender with 17 ... Qe7! (3 points) and if 18 Rae1, then halt the planned advance of the white e-pawn with 18 ... e5!, as pointed out by the winner. 18 Qxg4 Raa8 The advance 18 ... e5, stabilizing the centre, is generally something Black wants to do, but here, after 19 f5 f6 20 Rf3, White’s attack is both dangerous and easy to play. 19 Rae1 Qe7\n\n– Your Move – (as Black) Choose between 20 ... Rad8, 20 ... g6, and 20 ... e5. 20 ... g6? It is true that after the coming Rg3 a weakening move like this will be necessary in any case, but Black should not have ‘volunteered’ it without a concrete reason. This move therefore loses 2 points. 20 ... Rad8 isn’t a particularly useful move and receives no points. This was the right moment to play 20 ... e5! (3 points) and after 21 f5, instead of stopping the pawn advance 22 f6 with 21 ... f6, Black can play 21 ... Qf6!. White should thus probably refrain from advancing the f-pawn and play 21 Rg3 instead; whereas 21 Rh3 wouldn’t be very dangerous – why not?\n\n– Your Move – (as Black; after 21 Rh3) – Your Move – 20 Re3 2 points. The rook moves closer to the kingside, which is bad news for Black, who sorely misses his f6-knight. The alternative was the immediate 20 e5 (1 point). Black could counter-attack with 20 ... f5, which gains him some counterplay after 21 exf6 Rxf6. However, Black’s structure is inferior and White appears to be better after, for instance, 22 Nd2,\n\nAnswer: Because Black could establish a powerful ‘Sicilian knight’ on e5 after 21 ... exf4! (2 points). If White tries to prevent ... Ne5 by playing 22 e5, then after 22 ... g6 the main beneficiary of the opening of the diagonals would be Black’s bishop on b7, rather than White’s on d3. – Your Move – 21 Qg3! 41\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King 3 points. This prepares the f4-f5 advance, since the e3-rook is now defended; the queen also moves out of range of an eventual ... Ne5. Another plus is that the queen now exerts Xray pressure on the d6-pawn. The chess engines prefer other moves here, but they are not really better. Surprisingly, at first one of their ‘top’ suggestions is 21 Ree1. 21 ... Rfe8 Preventing f4-f5 again; Leko indicates that after 21 ... Kh8 White could play 22 f5 anyway, as the opening of the g-file isn’t unfavourable to White; e.g. 22 ... gxf5? 23 exf5 Rg8 and White’s attack is devastating after 24 Qh3 Ne5 25 f6! etc.\n\nNd4 with the initiative – the presence of the pawn on b5 is awkward for Black and his pieces are badly coordinated. No better was 24 ... Na7 25 Nd4, since if 25 ... Qb7, White gets a strong attack with 26 f5!, threatening 27 f6, among other things. – Your Move – 23 c3! 3 points. A complement to the previous move; White plans to continue with 24 Nd4. If now 23 ... bxc3 24 Rxc3, White would once again be threatening to play f4-f5. The engines prefer an ‘inhuman’ move, such as 23 c4. 23 ... Red8\n\n– Your Move – 22 Bb5! 5 points. With this unexpected switch of diagonal, the bishop creates an annoying pin and exerts more pressure on the a5-pawn. Does this mean that the attack against the king has been abandoned? Not at all. According to Gershon and Nor, this manoeuvre recalls Karpov in his heyday. It was also reasonable to improve the position of the worst-placed piece by playing 22 Nd2 (1 point). Insisting on playing f4-f5 with 22 Rfe1 would move the rook away from the f-file where it’s needed, so this receives no points. 22 ... Rac8 If Black unpins the knight with 22 ... Red8, White would naturally play 23 f5; while if Black exchanges bishops with 22 ... Ba6, the winner indicated the line 23 Rd3 Bxb5 24 axb5 Nb8 25\n\n– Your Move – 24 f5! 2 points. Of course! Now that the rook is no longer on e8, White plays his planned pawn break. For any other move, deduct 1 point. Black can’t take advantage of the one drawback of this advance by playing 24 ... Ne5, owing to 25 Nxa5. 24 ... bxc3 – Your Move – 25 bxc3! 2 points. Although this move weakens White’s pawn structure, Black can’t do much to exploit it. White’s priority is to prevent Black’s counterplay. And besides, as I once heard 42\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King someone say, “In the next game, all the pawns will be neatly arranged once again.” After the apparently ‘healthier’ recapture 25 Rxc3?! (deduct 1 point), Black could respond effectively with 25 ... Ne5!, since the e4-pawn is then en prise and a new front, the c-file, is opened up, which could well distract White from his kingside attack. 25 ... Ra8\n\n– Your Move – (as Black; after 29 Rh6)\n\n– Your Move – 26 f6 1 point. This wedge is extremely powerful, as White’s major pieces can quickly move to the kingside. 26 ... Qf8 27 Qf4 h6?! This doesn’t hinder White’s attacking intentions; and the radical 27 ... h5 can be answered by 28 g4. One annotator wrote that 27 ... Ne5! would be met by 28 Rh3 (intending 29 Rh6, followed by Qh4), when 28 ... h5 would fail to 29 Be2! and Bxh5. But in fact Black has enough resources after 28 ... Ba6!; if then 29 Rh6, what is the correct defensive move?\n\nAnswer: The clearest way is 29 ... Ng4! (2 points) and the rook must retreat. Returning to 27 ... Ne5, another option for White is 28 c4!?, planning to undermine the strong black knight with an eventual c4-c5. 28 Rh3 g5 Not a pleasant move to have to make, but 28 ... Kh7 was not the solution either – how would you respond to this? – Your Move – (after 28 ... Kh7) Answer: After 29 Qg5! (2 points), with the plan of Rf4-h4, there’s no good defence. If 29 ... e5, preventing Rf4, one winning line is 30 Rh4 Rab8 31 Rf3 Bc8 and now simply 32 g4. 29 Qe3 Ne5\n\n– Your Move – 30 Rh5! 43\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King 2 points. Threatening Qh3. There isn’t a great deal of space on the h-file, but there’s just enough; White also threatens 31 h4. This is much stronger than 30 Rg3 (0 points) 30 ... Kh7 31 h4 g4 etc. 30 ... Ng6 – Your Move – 31 Qh3 2 points. This was the idea – straightforward and probably best. Leko gives 31 h4! (2 points) as a strong alternative; then if 31 ... Nf4 White has 32 Rxf4! gxf4 33 Qxf4 e5 (after 33 ... Kh7 the easiest way is 34 Bd3, when 34 ... e5 35 Qf5+ Kg8 36 Bc4! is similar, and 34 ... Ba6 35 c4 e5 doesn’t really help after 36 Qg5 and 37 Nd4) 34 Qg4+ Kh7 35 Qf5+ Kh8 36 Bc4! (threatening 37 Bxf7) 36 ... d5 37 Qg5! Kh7 38 exd5 Bxd5 39 Bd3+ e4 40 Nd4! and Nf5, winning. Instead, 31 ... Nxh4 is punished by 32 Rxh4 gxh4 33 Rf4 Kh7 34 Rg4 etc. No better is 31 ... gxh4, since after 32 Rxh6 Bxe4 33 Qg5!, White can exploit the opening of the h-file – the threat is Rf4xh4, or if 33 ... e5 then 34 Rxh4 Bc2 35 Rh3, followed by Qh5 wins. 31 ... Bxe4 If 31 ... Nf4 then simply 32 Rxf4 gxf4 33 Rxh6 etc. 32 Nd2! Harassing the bishop, which has become a good defensive piece. Nevertheless, the simple 32 Rxh6! is even stronger according to the engines.\n\n– Your Move – (as Black) 32 ... Bc2! 2 points. The most tenacious. This move isn’t enough to save the game, but it sets the most problems. It’s better than 32 ... Bf5 (0 points) 33 g4 Bc2 34 Rxh6, when Black is helpless against the threat of Rh7-g7+. Black’s king position is also demolished after 32 ... d5 (0 points) 33 Rxh6 Rac8 34 Qh5 Rxc3?! 35 Nxe4 (better than the intended 35 Rh7) 35 ... dxe4 36 Rxg6+! fxg6 37 Qxg6+ Kh8 38 Qh5+ Kg8 39 f7+ Kg7 40 Qxg5+ and the c3-rook will be captured in a few more moves. 33 Rxh6 Finally opening the h-file. The engines like 33 Be2! (preventing ... g5-g4), which is also strong. 33 ... Rac8 What would you play to counter the move ‘feared’ by the computers – 33 ... g4 - ?\n\n– Your Move – (after 33 ... g4) Answer: White must combine attack with defence. 34 Qh5? (deduct 1 point) doesn’t work, since Black can counter-attack with 34 ... Rac8!, when 35 Rh7? is bad because of 35 ... Rc5!, forcing the exchange of queens. The best way is 34 Qe3! (3 points), and if 34 ... Rac8, there are several strong continuations, such as 35 Rc1 Bf5 36 Nb3, threatening Nd4 as well as the capture of the a5-pawn. But the strongest move seems to be 35 h3!, again with the idea of occupying the h-file – it threatens 36 hxg4, followed by Qh3 etc, or if 35 ... g3 44\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King then 36 Rf3 and Black’s position remains critical. 34 Rh5 Rc5 35 Rc1 In time trouble White allows Black a practical chance. There were several good moves, such as 35 Be2! (the engines’ preference), 35 Qg3, and even 35 c4, threatening 36 Qc3. – Your Move – (as Black) 35 ... g4! 2 points. Maximum resistance! This is the move that 35 Be2 would have prevented. Not 35 ... Bf5? (deduct 1 point) 36 g4 and the bishop is lost. 36 Qxg4 – Your Move – (as Black) 36 ... Bf5?! 0 points. In time trouble himself, Black fails to find the more tenacious 36 ... Rxc3! (2 points), threatening 37 ... Bf5, and the struggle would continue. Now we can clearly see why 35 c4 was suggested. 37 Qg3 d5\n\n– Your Move – 38 Nb3 1 point. Once the knight enters the fray the result will become clear. 38 ... Rcc8 39 Nd4 Even the materialistic 39 Nxa5 was good. 39 ... Be4 40 Nc6\n\nWinning the exchange; though as Leko pointed out, 40 Qg5 was even stronger, intending 41 Rh3 and Qh5. 40 ... Rxc6 After 40 ... Rd7 41 Ne5 Rdc7, White has 42 Bd7!, threatening the rook as well as 43 Bxe6. If then 42 ... Rxd7 43 Nxd7 Qd8, the quickest way is 44 Qg5 with mate in eight, according to Houdini, although the odd-looking 44 Rh7 forces mate in just one move more. 41 Bxc6 Qd6 42 Qg5 Qf4 43 Qxf4 Nxf4 44 Rg5+ The rest is easy. 44 ... Kh7 45 Bb5 Kh6 46 h4 Nxg2 47 Rxg2 Rg8 48 Rc2! 1-0 Peter Leko vs. Rustam Kasimdzhanov, FIDE World Championship, San Luis 2005. Some lessons from this game: 1. When to remain flexible, and when to take concrete action? The answer is “it depends ... ” – there’s no ‘one-size-fits-all’ answer. (9 ... Qc7?, 9 ... Nf6!, 9 ... Nge7!, 20 e5?!, 20 Re3!) 2. “Which piece should I exchange? Which one should I keep?” If you can find the right answers you’ll probably discover the correct plan. (17 Ng4!, 22 Bb5!) 3. “How can I improve the position of my pieces?” This is another question which, posed at the right moment, can give us clues to finding the best move. (38 Nb3!) 4. As the book San Luis 2005 remarks, knowing the classics is always useful – as we can see in the ‘Karpovian’ moves 22 Bb5! and 24 c3!. Another lesson from the classics: play on both sides of the board is something we can learn from Alekhine’s games. 5. Never underestimate the opponent’s defensive resources, even in difficult situations. (35 Rc1?!, 35 c4!) Italics refer to variations, as opposed to moves actually played. How did you do?

Although it allows Black to continue his pawn offensive with 12 ... a5, White can reply with 13 Kb1; whereas the black king, whether he stays in the centre or runs to the kingside, will not be safe anywhere, as the white pawns are also menacing. 12 Na4 (0 points) halts the advance ... a6-a5a4, which can sometimes justify putting a knight out of play. In this case, the knight is vulnerable to (among other things) an eventual ... Qc7-c6; for example, after 12 ... Rb8, which would force Kb1, followed by Nc1, in order to be able to play b2-b3. If White dislodges the f6-knight with g4-g5, in many variations the best answer will be ... Nh5, which has some similarities to White’s Na4 move – the main difference being that the black knight can jump to f4 in many lines, which changes things significantly. 46\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King 12 ... Bxd5 13 exd5 – Your Move – Choose between 13 ... a5, 13 ... Nb6, and 13 ... 0-0.\n\n13 ... Nb6 2 points. This is the way to show that White’s 12 Nd5 has a downside. Otherwise White has just gained control of the light squares and, in particular, thanks to 13 exd5, the c6square, which could be very important. 13 ... 0-0? (deduct 2 points) isn’t justified in view of the obvious answer 14 Qxb4. The counter-attack 13 ... a5? (deduct 1 point) 14 g5 Nh5 isn’t satisfactory either – why not?\n\nQxe5+. Returning the piece by 17 ... Bf6 18 gxf6 Nxf6 19 Rg1 isn’t encouraging either. 14 Na5 The alternative, 14 Qxb4, isn’t advantageous either, according to current theory. Black should then capture on d5, but which way? – Your Move – (after 14 Qxb4) Answer: Black should play 14 ... Nfxd5 (1 point), when 15 Bxb6 is forced (because all queen retreats lose to 15 ... Nxe3, followed by 16 ... Bg5) and practice has shown that Black can hold the position after 15 ... Nxb6. 14 ... Nbxd5? (deduct 1 point) isn’t the same, since after 15 Qa4+ White can keep his pair of bishops with advantage.\n\n– Your Move – (as White; after 14 ... Nh5) Answer: It is possible to play simply 15 Kb1 (1 point) and White is slightly better after, for instance, 15 ... Rb8 16 Bh3 etc. However, 15 Bb5! (2 points) is more accurate; after 15 ... 0-0 16 Kb1 a4 17 Nc1, Black’s pawns are very weak and his pieces are not active enough to compensate for loss of material. We might wonder why Black can’t play 15 ... a4 (instead of 15 ... 0-0). – Your Move – (as White; after 15 ... a4) Answer: Because White has the move 16 Nc5! (2 points) available, and the black king is in a bad way after 16 ... dxc5 17 d6, since 17 ... Bf8? fails to 18 Qd5, threatening 19\n\n– Your Move –\n\n14 ... Nbxd5 1 point. Consistent, if not forced. This was the idea, not fearing the entrance of the knight at c6. 15 Nc6 White also tried 15 Nc4 in later games. 15 ... Qc7 16 Nxb4 The alternative is 16 Nxe7 – what would happen then? Give a short variation. – Your Move – (after 16 Nxe7) Answer: Black gets decent play after 16 ... Nxe3! (2 points) 17 Qxe3 Kxe7. With the\n\n47\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King disappearance of the e3-bishop, the black king is safer, even if it stays in the centre. Any move other than 16 ... Nxe3! loses 2 points, since material losses are then unavoidable: if 16 ... Kxe7? then 17 g5 wins; 16 ... Qxe7? also loses, due to 17 g5 Nxe3 18 gxf6 Nxf1 19 Qd5! Qd8 20 Qc6+, followed by 21 Rxd6. 16 ... Nxb4 17 Qxb4 0-0\n\n– Your Move –\n\n18 ... Rfc8 1 point. First Black takes aim at c2, bringing a fresh piece into the attack. This is something that could have been avoided by playing 18 Qb6!. Any other move, such as passively retreating the f6-knight, or playing a rook to b8, ‘forcing’ 19 Qc4, loses 1 point.\n\n– Your Move – (as White)\n\n18 g5?! A logical move; the kings are situated on opposite wings, so the main objective is to speed up the attack, trying to be the first to break through to the opponent’s king. This is almost always the best strategy in such positions, but tactical factors are also important, and after this move (which loses 2 points) the race will go in favour of Black, who already has two open files against the white king. After evaluating the strength of the two competing attacks (which is obviously not an easy matter – after all, if you chose the erroneous 18 g5 you were following in the footsteps of a 2700-strength Grandmaster!), it becomes clear that 18 Qb6! (4 points) was to be preferred, trying to exchange queens or else disrupt the coordination of the black forces. Then 18 ... Qc8 19 g5 is fine; and after 19 ... Nd7 20 Qa5, Inarkiev suggested 20 ... Rb8! with a complicated struggle.\n\n– Your Move – (as White) Choose between 19 Qa4, 19 Qc4, and 19 Bd3.\n\n19 Qa4?! White continues playing in the most ambitious way, consistent with 18 g5, but it’s too risky. This move loses 1 point. Once again it was better to try to simplify with 19 Qc4! (3 points), and after 19 ... Qxc4 20 Bxc4 Rxc4 21 gxf6 Bxf6 (better than 21 ... gxf6 22 Rhg1+ Kh8 23 Bh6 Rg8 24 Rxg8+ Kxg8 25 Rg1+ etc, when only White can try to win) 22 Rxd6 Kf8 or 22 ... Rh4, the ending is about equal. The developing move 19 Bd3 was unsatisfactory – why? – Your Move – (after 19 Bd3) Answer: Because 19 ... Rab8! (2 points) forces 20 Qc3, and after 20 ... Qxc3 21 bxc3 Nd5 22 Bxh7+ Kxh7 23 Rxd5 Rxc3, White’s structure is dreadful and his pieces are uncoordinated.\n\n48\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King White might claim that, instead of 20 Qc3, the counter-attack 20 Qh4 looks stronger. Show why this isn’t true.\n\n– Your Move –\n\n– Your Move – (after 20 Qh4) Answer: Because Black strikes first with 20 ... e4!! (5 points), cutting off White’s queen from the defence, with an irresistible attack after 21 Bxe4 Rxb2! 22 Kxb2 Qc3+. There is no defence either after 21 fxe4 Rxb2! (threatening ... Qxc2+ or ... Rxc2+) 22 Kxb2 Qc3+ and 23 ... d5, while 22 Kd2 Nd7! 23 e5 g6 leaves the black king safe and the white king at the mercy of all Black’s pieces – again there’s no defence. The immediate 20 ... Rxb2! (2 points) is also strong; at this point we can agree that this is “a very typical idea in this variation” (Karjakin). The rook is taboo, since 21 Kxb2? loses to 21 ... Qc3+ 22 Kb1 (or 22 Kc1 d5 etc) 22 ... Rb8+ 23 Kc1 d5!, while 21 Qc4 (which 20 ... e4!! prevented) is less useful than before, because 21 ... Qb7 forces 22 Qxc8+ Qxc8 23 gxf6 Bxf6 24 Kxb2 e4+ 25 Kc1 exd3 26 Rxd3 and, after a creating an escape hole for his king (with 26 ... h5, for instance) before activating his queen, Black is clearly better. The exposure of the white king (not to mention the weak white pawns) means that the black queen is much stronger than White’s two rooks.\n\n19 ... Rab8 Black makes another zwischenzug, judging that the f6-knight doesn’t need to retreat yet – is this correct? The answer is given below. – Your Move – (as White) Choose between 20 gxf6, 20 Bd3, 20 Qc4, and 20 Bc4.\n\n20 Bd3? In the first place, let’s answer the question concerning the evaluation of 19 ... Rab8 – is this move sound or not? Yes it is, and it truly deserves the two exclamation marks awarded by the winner in his annotations, since “Black is exploiting the fact that White doesn’t have time to take the knight.” You receive 5 points if you chose this move. Returning to the actual position, the winner considered that 20 Bd3 (deduct 1 point) was a “decisive mistake”. You surely immediately discarded 20 gxf6? (deduct 2 points), because this allows Black to execute his main threat, 20 ... Rb4!. 20 Qc4? was no good either (deduct 1 point) because, after 20 ... Qb7, White doesn’t get two rooks for the queen this time, and if 21 Qb3, Black wins with 21 ... Qxf3. The only chance to resist was with 20 Bc4! (3 points), after which Black has the initiative and stands better, but there’s no immediate win. Black could, for example, continue 20 ... 49\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King Qxc4?! 21 Qxc4 Rxc4 22 gxf6 Bxf6 23 Rxd6 e4 24 c3 exf3 25 Rf1 Rh4, but his advantage is minimal since the material is too reduced. It would be better to keep the queens on. Karjakin thinks that Black is slightly better after 20 ... Ng4 or 20 ... Nd7, but probably the most promising move is 20 ... a5!, planning ... Rb4.\n\n– Your Move – (after 22 h4) Answer: The most forceful way is with the now familiar blow 22 ... Rxb2! (2 points), and Black wins after 23 Kxb2 Qc3+ 24 Kc1 d5 etc.\n\n– Your Move –\n\n20 ... Nd7 1 point. There are no more intermediate moves; the knight must finally retreat, but it heads towards the queenside to reinforce the attack. 21 Qe4\n\n– Your Move – Choose between 21 ... g6 and 21 ... Nf8.\n\n21 ... g6 2 points. Of course there’s no need to deploy the knight passively on f8; White is in no position to exploit Black’s kingside weaknesses. The retreat 21 ... Nf8? therefore loses 2 points. 22 Bxa6 This opens more lines, but it was difficult to find a good move, and “hardly better was 22 Rde1 Nc5” (Karjakin). We said that White can’t exploit the weaknesses that have appeared around the black king. He could try to do so with 22 h4 – how would you refute this?\n\n– Your Move –\n\n22 ... Rb4! 2 points. “The logical continuation of the attack!” wrote the winner; Black gains more activity and overloads the white queen. 22 ... Bxg5? is obviously wrong: after 23 Bxg5 Nc5 24 Qc4 Nxa6, White succeeds in exchanging queens and his king is safe. 23 Qd3 If 23 c4, Black replies with the simple 23 ... Rcb8, when 24 b3? loses to 24 ... Qa5. White would have to play 24 Qc2, but Black then has 24 ... Rxb2 with advantage. The winner indicates the alternative line 23 ... Qc6 24 Bxc8 Rxc4+ 25 Kb1 Rxe4 26 Bxd7 Qxd7 27 fxe4 Qa4 with a great advantage – the e4-pawn falls and Black gains a powerful central pawn mass. – Your Move –\n\n23 ... Rcb8 1 point. This was the point of his previous move: to double rooks with tempo. 24 b3\n\n50\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King\n\n– Your Move –\n\n24 ... Nc5! 3 points. “When you have a good position it’s easy to play well” (Karjakin); Black gains control of the dark squares. Now 25 Qe2 loses to 25 ... Rxb3!, so White must capture on c5. 25 Bxc5 Qxc5 Threatening 26 ... Rd4, followed by 27 ... Qa3+, winning. 26 Qd5 – Your Move –\n\n26 ... Qa7! 2 points. A retreat, but once again with tempo, and with X-ray pressure on the a2pawn; the g5-pawn won’t go away. 27 Bc4\n\n– Your Move –\n\n27 ... Bxg5+ 1 point. Recovering the pawn and defending the f7-square. Nevertheless, 27 ... Rc8! (3 points) “was another very strong option”, not fearing 28 Qxf7+ Kh8, as there’s no good defence against an eventual ... Rbxc4, combined with ... Bxg5+. The winner pointed out the line 28 a3 Qxa3+ 29 Kd2 Bxg5+ 30 Ke1 Rbxc4, but the computer’s suggestion of 30 ... Rcxc4! is even better, as after 31 bxc4 Qc3+ 32 Kf1 Qxc2 (threatening 33 ... Rb2) 33 Qd3 Qa2, White is helpless. 28 Kb2 – Your Move –\n\n28 ... Ra4 1 point. Consistent with 26 ... Qa7; the attack down the a-file is extremely strong. 29 a3 How would you reply to 29 Ra1 - ? – Your Move – (after 29 Ra1) Answer: The position of the rook on the same diagonal as the king is a “tactical weakness”; Black can play 29 ... e4! (2 points) and after 30 Rhf1 e3, Black has a strong passed pawn which increases the pressure on the white king and indeed the whole white position. Also strong is 29 ... Ra5! (2 points), relieving the pressure on the f7-pawn in order to free the black queen from its defence. After 30 Qxd6 Be7 (or 30 ... e4) 31 Qd3 Ba3+ 32 Kb1 Ra4, White is unable to coordinate his forces; if instead 30 Qe4 then 30 ... Qc5! (even better than 30 ... Ra3) threatens 31 ... d5 or first 31 ... Qa3+, followed by ... d6-d5 and ... e5-e4, bringing the bishop into the attack via new diagonals. 29 ... Ra5 30 Qe4 30 Qxd6 loses to 30 ... Be7.\n\n51\n\nTEST YOUR CHESS: Part One - Attacking the King 2 points. “Now it’s time to play it” (Karjakin). 31 ... Bc5 (1 point) also wins but isn’t as strong. 32 Ra1 – Your Move –\n\n– Your Move –\n\n30 ... Be3! 3 points. Joining the attack from outside the pawn formation is a neat and strong idea. There were several other attractive moves here; 30 ... Kg7! (2 points) was also possible, aiming to play ... f7-f5. Somewhat more complicated was 30 ... Rxa3! (2 points) 31 Ra1! Ra8 32 Qxa8+! Qxa8 33 Rxa3 Qxf3 34 Rf1, if only from the practical point of view. Although “White has counterplay”, as Karjakin pointed out, B"
