        "text": "Our Events\n\nParaguayan Socials\n\nThe Paraguayan Social was born as a collaborative idea between the PSA board and the Paraguayan students at k-state, with the sole purpose of promoting a friendly environment for students and faculty to learn, share, exchange cultural similarities, differences and, ideas, while being able to practice Spanish, have a bite of Paraguayan food (when available), learn about different topics from Paraguay and have fun! There's no need to be proficient in Spanish; the point is for all to meet and chat, away from the pressure of a classroom, just like you would with friends.\n\nLa Hamburgueseada\n\nThereâ€™s no better way to receive the new school year than to get together, play games and enjoy food. This event was organized as a welcome to new and returning students to K-State and present the new board of the Paraguayan Student Association.\n\nSale una empanada\n\nEvents in Partnership with other Organizations\n\nMovies on the Grass: Landfill Harmonic Screening\n\nICC Food Festival\n\nICC International Week\n\nVernon Larson Lecture: Peace Corps Spotlight on Paraguay"
