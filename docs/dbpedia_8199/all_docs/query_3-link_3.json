        "text": "Originally published by Roseline in October 2022. Updated by Vanessa R in September 2023 and Updated by Ruth in May 2024.\n\nParaguay is a melting pot of cultures and races, with amazing individuals who have made a difference through their extraordinary achievements. The famous Paraguayans include artists, leaders, musicians, politicians, and athletes. However, this article details some of the top 20 most famous people from Paraguay. They include the following;\n\n1. Roque Santa Cruz\n\nRoque Luis Santa Cruz Cantero is a Paraguayan football striker who currently plays for Club Libertad. Santa Cruz is a naturalized Spanish citizen who married Giselle Tavarelli in 2003, the sister of his former national team and Olimpia teammate Ricardo Tavarelli. Roque Santa Cruz is a devoted Roman Catholic.\n\nSanta Cruz scored his 26th international goal on June 7, 2013, in a 2014 World Cup qualification match against Chile, becoming Paraguay’s all-time leading goalscorer. He, however, holds the record for most goals scored and has earned over 100 caps for the Paraguay national team, making him one of the best players in the country’s history.\n\n2. Alfredo Stroessner\n\nAlfredo Stroessner Matiauda was Paraguay’s long-serving president. Alfredo, who was born into the upper ranks of his country’s social class, was very proud of his elite status. He joined in a prestigious military academy at a young age and graduated with an active commission. He was promoted multiple times after serving honorably in several fights. Stroessner seized the presidency after effectively negotiating various shifting political alliances. He had practically unrivaled power for the next couple of decades after imposing martial law.\n\n3. Horacio Cartes\n\nHoracio Manuel Cartes Jara is a controversial Paraguayan businessman and politician who served as the country’s president between 2013 and 2018. He belongs to the Colorado Party.\n\nCartes’ Grupo Carte’s conglomerate owns over two dozen enterprises, including tobacco, soft beverages, livestock production, and banking. From 2001 to 2012, he was the president of the Club Libertad football club, and he was the president of the Paraguayan Football Association’s national team department during the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying. He has been recognized as “seriously corrupt” by the United States due to his involvement in international crime and terrorist organizations.\n\n4.Silvana López Moreira\n\nSilvana López Moreira Bó has served as Paraguay’s First Lady since 15 August 2018, following her marriage to President Mario Abdo Bentez. The role of First Lady in Paraguay was reestablished with López Moreira after a vacancy caused by the former President, Horacio Cartes, who ordered its closure due to being divorced. She was born on January 31, 1974, in a wealthy family, to Néstor López Moreira and Rossana Bó.\n\nDuring her husband’s inauguration, López Moreira was praised for her fashion sense, wearing a garment made of and (a traditional handmade fabric of Paraguay), embroidered by weavers from Itauguá, a place famed for its manufacturing of the fabric. According to the Spanish magazine Hola!, this was reported in Paraguayan publications.\n\n5. Larissa Riquelme\n\nLarissa Mabel Riquelme Frutos, born 22 February 1985, is a Paraguayan model and actress. She is one of Paraguay’s highest-paid models. Riquelme is a well-known model and actress in Paraguay, and gained international popularity during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nShe was named the “World Cup’s Girlfriend” by Marca, Spain’s largest sports newspaper, after being one of the most searched individuals on the internet. She was also considered “the most renowned World Cup fan.”\n\n6.Ana Lucrecia Taglioretti\n\nAna Lucrecia Taglioretti was a Paraguayan violin prodigy. Taglioretti, who was born blind, began studying music at the age of five, beginning with the piano, subsequently singing, and finally focusing on the violin.
