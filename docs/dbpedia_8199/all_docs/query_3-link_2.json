        "text": "history of Paraguay, a survey of important events and people in the history of Paraguay from the time of European settlement. A landlocked country in south-central South America, Paraguay has a more-homogeneous population than most other countries in South America; most Paraguayans are of European and Guaraní ancestry. Paraguay’s recent history has been characterized by turbulence and authoritarian rule. It was involved in two of the three major wars on the continent, the War of the Triple Alliance (1864/65–70) and the Chaco War (1932–35). Moreover, a civil war in 1947 and the long dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner (1954–89) left a deep legacy of fear and self-censorship among Paraguayans, who began to overcome those impediments only in the early 21st century. Since 1989 the democratization process has been rocky, and Paraguay has experienced bouts of instability in its military, the assassination of a vice president in 1999, and the indictment of former presidents Juan Carlos Wasmosy (1993–98) and Luis González Macchi (1999–2003) on corruption charges. In 2008 Paraguay’s Colorado Party, one of the longest continuously ruling political parties in the world, lost power for the first time since 1947, though it returned to power in 2013.\n\nEarly history of Paraguay\n\nThe Guaraní occupied the region between the Paraguay and Paraná rivers long before the arrival of Europeans (about 2000–1000 bce). They were a Tupian-speaking people, and in most respects their customs resembled those of the other Indigenous people in the tropical forests. The women cultivated corn (maize), cassava (manioc), and sweet potatoes, and the men hunted and fished. They were warlike seminomadic people who lived in large thatched dwellings grouped in villages; each village was surrounded by a defensive palisade. In the 15th century raiders from the Gran Chaco region made frequent attacks upon Guaraní tribes. Crossing the Paraguay River, the Guaraní retaliated and subdued their enemies, carrying the conflict into the margins of the Inca empire. They were, therefore, the natural allies of early European explorers who were seeking short routes to the mineral wealth of Peru. Alejo García, making his way from the Brazilian coast in 1524, and Sebastian Cabot, sailing up the Paraná in 1526, were the earliest of those explorers to reach the area.\n\nColonial period in Paraguay\n\nThe first colonial settlements were established by Domingo Martínez de Irala in the period 1536–56. The first Spanish colonists, unsuccessful in their search for gold, settled peacefully among the Guaraní in the region of Asunción, the present capital of Paraguay. Those first settlers established their notorious harems of Guaraní women, and their ethnically mixed descendants gradually grew into the rural population of modern Paraguay, which still considers itself to be Guaraní in custom and habit. With Asunción as his principal base, Irala laid the foundations of Paraguay and made it the center of Spanish power in southeastern South America. Irala’s colonization policy involved the delimitation of the boundary with Brazil through a line of forts against Portuguese expansion, the foundation of villages, the settlement of the Guaraní to provide food, labor, and soldiers, and extensive Guaraní-Spanish intermarriage. Rapidly, a national and fairly homogeneous amalgam of Indigenous and Spanish cultures came into being.\n\nFor more than 150 years from early in the 17th century, Jesuit communal missions in the Paraná and Uruguay basins of southeastern Paraguay governed the lives of 150,000 Indigenous people in 30 reducciones (settlements). Those were centers of religious conversion, agricultural and pastoral production, and manufacturing and trade as well as strategic outposts against Portuguese expansion from southern Brazil. Isolated from the heart of Paraguay, which centered on Asunción, the missions became an autonomous military, political, and economic “state within a state,” increasingly exciting the envy of the Spanish landowners in the Asunción area. In the period 1721–35 the latter waged a struggle to overthrow the Jesuit monopoly of Indigenous trade and labor. Unaided, the settlements also had to defend themselves against enslaverss from São Paulo and, in 1754–57, a combined Spanish-Portuguese attack that was designed to enforce a territorial partition of the mission settlements. Defiance of such powerful groups paved the way for the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767. The settlements were abandoned; the Indigenous people were absorbed by either the landed estates or the jungle; the settlements fell into ruin; and economic activity ceased.\n\nIn 1776 the new Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was created, with its capital in Buenos Aires. That effectively made Asunción and all of Paraguay dependent on Buenos Aires and thus ended the region’s colonial dominance.\n\nStruggle for Paraguayan independence\n\nAs the power of Buenos Aires grew, the leaders of Paraguay began to resent the decline in their province’s significance, and, although they had early challenged Spanish authority, they refused to accept the declaration of Argentine independence in 1810 as applying to Paraguay. Nor could an Argentine army under Gen. Manuel Belgrano enforce Paraguayan acceptance, as Paraguayan militia repulsed Belgrano’s forces in 1811. Later, however, when the Spanish governor sought assistance from the Portuguese in defending the colony from further attacks from Buenos Aires, he underestimated the nationalistic spirit of the Paraguayans. Under the leadership of the militia captains Pedro Juan Cabellero and Fulgencio Yegros, they promptly deposed the governor and declared their independence on May 14, 1811.\n\nElman R. Service Gilbert James Butland John Hoyt Williams\n\nEstablishment of the Paraguayan republic\n\nThe Francia regime\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nA governing junta was soon established, led by Yegros but in reality dominated by a civilian lawyer, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia. Francia proposed the idea of a confederation of equals to Buenos Aires. The city was hoping for eventual domination but settled for a vague military alliance, which was signed in October 1811. That constituted de facto recognition of Paraguayan independence, and, when Buenos Aires attempted to use the alliance to acquire Paraguayan troops for its own interprovincial quarrels, the accord became void. Buenos Aires’s response was to blockade Paraguay. In the face of regional fragmentation, Buenos Aires sent Nicolás de Herrera to Asunción to frighten, bluff, or bribe Paraguay into a union of unequals. Francia responded by convening a congress, which on October 12, 1813, formally declared Paraguay an independent republic and rejected further treaties with Buenos Aires. A consulate of two men, Yegros and Francia, was established to rule the republic for a year.\n\nAt the end of that year, a new congress met and proclaimed Francia supreme dictator of the republic for a period of five years. In 1816 a third congress made him perpetual dictator, and his will was the law in Paraguay for an additional 24 years. El Supremo, as he was known, prohibited any political activity, stripped the church of its holdings and power, confiscated the wealth of the small Spanish elite, abolished the municipal government of Asunción, and generally isolated Paraguay from its rather hostile neighbors. In 1820 El Supremo found out about a plot to depose him and restore the native elite to power. Hundreds of arrests were made, and in the following year at least 68 men of the traditional Paraguayan aristocracy (including Fulgencio Yegros) were executed. Their wealth in land and enslaved people became part of the national patrimony, and well before Francia’s death (1840) the state came to own a vast proportion of the country. With the borders sealed, Paraguay became of necessity almost self-sufficient; only a small carefully regulated commerce was permitted with Argentina and Brazil. Uninvited foreigners were often held for years under loose arrest in the interior.\n\nThe start of modernization\n\nWhen Francia died, he left behind a quietly prosperous country that had adjusted well to what amounted to state socialism, but he also left a country of rustics with no political experience and a strong tradition of dictatorial rule. In 1841 a second consulate emerged from the chaos in the figures of a civilian, Carlos Antonio López, and a soldier, Mariano Roque Alonso. It was soon clear that López was the true ruler of Paraguay, and in 1844 a congress named him president. The same congress promulgated a constitution, notable for the great powers accorded the president and the absence of the word liberty from its text. López devoted much of his two decades in power to opening the country slowly to the wider world and to modernization. Doing so provoked international crises, and it was not until after the fall of the Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas in 1852 that Argentina recognized Paraguayan sovereignty and eased its stranglehold on the rivers leading to the sea.\n\nParaguay’s conflicts with its neighbors\n\nWhile López was attempting to modernize Paraguay, he also had to attend to border crises with Brazil and Argentina. Those crises convinced him that Paraguayan modernization should proceed along military avenues. Thus, hundreds of foreign engineers, medical workers, scientists, machinists, and advisers were put to work on military projects. López was threatened by a major Brazilian naval expedition on the Paraná River in 1855. In 1858 a large flotilla of the U.S. Navy appeared to force a solution to a complex diplomatic issue, but British war vessels captured and held for a time the flagship of the small Paraguayan navy. In most of those contretemps, López was forced to give in, and the consequent humiliation lent greater urgency to his desire to strengthen Paraguay’s defenses. By the time of his death, in September 1862, he had created a major regional military machine. López, a cautious man, warned his eldest son, Francisco Solano López, who was to succeed him, not to use the new military might capriciously but to settle disputes through diplomacy and negotiation.\n\nWar of the Triple Alliance\n\nFrancisco Solano López in 1862 was the inexperienced spoiled son of an iron-willed dictator. He overestimated the military strength of his country and thought that Paraguay should have a larger voice in the affairs of the region. Thus, when Uruguay, wracked by civil war, was threatened with intervention by Brazil, López took an increasingly bellicose position. When Brazil ignored his warnings and ultimatums and invaded Uruguay in August 1864 to support a pro-Brazilian faction in the civil war, López decided to use the strength of his military machine. In November he ordered the capture of a Brazilian war steamer and sent units of his army and navy north to invade the Mato Grosso Plateau, simultaneously preparing a larger army corps to strike south to destroy the Brazilian army in Uruguay. When Argentina denied his request for transit of a Paraguayan army, he declared war on Argentina as well, in March 1865. In May, as Paraguayan troops were approaching, a puppet Uruguayan government signed the Treaty of the Triple Alliance with Brazil and Argentina, committing all three to the war against Paraguay.\n\nThe Paraguayan force heading southward was destroyed at Uruguaiana, in Brazil, and a strike into northeastern Argentina resulted in heavy Paraguayan casualties and the virtual destruction of López’s fleet in 1865. Much of the rest of the war was fought in southwestern Paraguay, near and around Humaitá. In May 1866 López threw the elite of his army into suicidal attacks against allied forces at Tuyutí, losing almost 20,000 of his best men. Other lost battles in 1866–68, as well as widespread epidemics of Asiatic cholera, devastated the population of the country. In 1869 and 1870 the tragedy was completed as López, pursued by large allied forces, retreated through the interior of his country with a shattered army and thousands of civilian refugees, dragging famine, disease, and death in his wake. Perhaps by that point unhinged, he ordered the executions of hundreds of people, including his own two brothers, two brothers-in-law, and scores of his officers. Finally, on March 1, 1870, his last camp was attacked at Cerro Corá by Brazilian cavalry, and López died in combat. His country by then lay in ruins, with more than half of its former population dead. A Brazilian occupation army remained, further draining the country, until 1876. The Paraguayan War, or War of the Triple Alliance, was one of the bloodiest in Latin American history.\n\nReconstruction\n\nUnder a liberal constitution promulgated in 1870, Paraguay began a painful reconstruction. Only the mutual jealousies of Brazil and Argentina prevented the country from losing much of its territory. As a result, Brazil gained no lands that it had not actually occupied before the war, and Argentina’s claims to most of the Chaco were reduced considerably when, in arbitration, U.S. Pres. Rutherford B. Hayes decided one key boundary issue in 1878 in favor of Paraguay. When the army of occupation was removed in 1876, it left a crowd of Paraguayan politicians noted for their corruption and ambition. In 1887 Paraguay’s two major political parties, the Liberal Party and the National Republican Association (Asociación Nacional Republicana; ANR), generally known as the Colorado Party, were born. The Colorados were in power from 1887 until a liberal revolt unseated them in 1904, and the Liberal Party, in its turn, dominated the presidency for the next 30 years.\n\nThe Chaco War\n\nParaguay’s reconstruction was complicated by a dispute with Bolivia concerning boundaries in the Chaco. The dispute was exacerbated when, in the 1880s, Bolivia lost its seacoast in the War of the Pacific with Chile and, seeing the Chaco as a possible outlet to the sea via the Paraná River, began to penetrate it with soldiers and colonists. By the 1920s armed clashes had begun to take place as Paraguay moved into the region in greater force. As Paraguay was frantically trying to arm itself, a Bolivian force stormed a Paraguayan fort on June 15, 1932, and the war began. Paraguayan Pres. Eusebio Ayala gave a military carte blanche to Gen. José Félix Estigarribia, who gradually pushed the Bolivians back until they were almost entirely ejected from the Chaco. Through foreign mediation, a cease-fire was attained on June 12, 1935, and a peace treaty ending the Chaco War was signed three years later, awarding Paraguay three-fourths of the Chaco.\n\nIn February 1936 Ayala and Estigarribia were imprisoned following a military coup known as the Febrerista revolt, conducted by radical officers. The inept new government soon fell, however, and Estigarribia was elected president in 1939.\n\nOn September 7, 1940, before he could actually implement a new constitution that gave him great authoritarian powers, Estigarribia was killed in an air crash. He was replaced by Gen. Higinio Morínigo, a harsh opportunist, who immediately persecuted the Liberals and rewarded the Colorados. A revolt of Liberals and other groups in 1947 caused a civil war that again devastated the country. Morínigo was deposed by the Colorados themselves in 1948. In the next six years Paraguay had six weak presidents, and then, in 1954, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, supported by both the Colorados and the army, seized power.\n\nThe Stroessner regime\n\nThe authoritarian Stroessner, with aid from the United States and later Brazil, managed to stabilize one of the world’s least-stable currencies, attract foreign investment, and embark on large public works projects. Paraguayan isolation was broken down. However, harsh rule was not relaxed after 1960. Though elections on all levels were permitted, the Colorado Party never lost, and Stroessner was duly reelected every five years with a huge plurality. The church alone continued to object to the repressive aspects of the regime, such as the inhumane treatment of the Indigenous minority and censorship. Relations with the United States deteriorated throughout the 1970s, and U.S. aid was much reduced. Partly because of that, the Stroessner government aligned itself closely with the authoritarian regime in Brazil, which offered aid and political support. The two countries cooperated in the building of the immense Itaipú hydroelectric plant on their shared border. As a result of that project, the national economy briefly improved, but it took a downturn in the early 1980s, causing some protests against the Stroessner regime.\n\nThe government showed little tolerance for opposition to its policies, and most of the main opposition leaders were kept forcibly in exile. Such repression focused international attention on Paraguay for human rights violations, further hampering the country’s foreign relations and intensifying economic stagnation. The aging Stroessner, who had been elected in 1983 for a seventh term, also had to deal with dissension within his own Colorado Party that pitted the traditionalist, or “moderate,” wing of the party against the “militant” wing. The former sought to open the political and economic system somewhat, whereas the latter favored continuation of the policies of the Stroessner regime and wanted Gustavo Stroessner to succeed his father when he stepped down from office. Factional discord rocked the Colorado Party, resulting in a partial purge of the traditionalists in 1988, and it appeared briefly that the militants were firmly in control. The traditionalists, however, were simply lining up their forces for the inevitable conflict. On February 3, 1989, Stroessner was overthrown in a coup led by his erstwhile top military commander, Gen. Andrés Rodríguez Pedotti, who announced that democracy had come to Paraguay.\n\nDemocratic freedoms\n\nElections were held on May 1, 1989, and Rodríguez was elected president (by a 74 percent plurality). The opposition parties had not had much time to organize for the electoral contest, and control of Congress remained with the Colorado Party. The party also remained in control of the judiciary, and Rodríguez’s cabinet included a number of military officers. Moreover, there was some concern over the fact that Rodríguez had never changed his active-duty military status. Nonetheless, a new constitution went into effect on June 20, 1992, and the president adopted certain democratic measures. He declared freedom of the press, legalized all political parties, repealed a number of repressive laws, ratified the human rights treaties of the United Nations and Organization of American States, and freed the country’s remaining political prisoners.\n\nDespite the establishment of democratic liberties, the armed forces remained a key power in Paraguay. Army Chief Gen. Lino Oviedo soon emerged as a major figure. He engineered the selection of Juan Carlos Wasmosy as the candidate of the Colorado Party in the 1993 presidential elections; Wasmosy won the election and became Paraguay’s first civilian president since 1954. But Oviedo and Wasmosy had a subsequent falling out, leading to a rebellion in April 1996, when only strong diplomatic pressure was able to avert a military coup. Oviedo retired from active service and reemerged as a Colorado Party front-runner in the 1998 presidential race, but Wasmosy retaliated by arresting Oviedo on charges arising from his 1996 coup attempt. Oviedo’s vice presidential running mate, Raúl Cubas Grau, replaced Oviedo as the party candidate and won the presidency for the Colorado Party with a convincing majority.\n\nThree days after assuming office, in August 1998, President Cubas released Oviedo from jail and refused to return Oviedo to confinement even after the Supreme Court ruled Cubas’s actions unconstitutional. A political impasse was broken following the assassination of Vice Pres. Luís María Argaña, on March 23, 1999. Fearing military intervention, thousands of student demonstrators protested outside the National Congress building in Asunción, calling for the arrest of Oviedo, who was widely suspected of being involved in the assassination. Later that week, Oviedo supporters fired on the demonstrators, killing eight and wounding many. But that provocation failed to disperse the crowds. President Cubas resigned and was granted asylum in Brazil; meanwhile, Oviedo fled to Argentina.\n\nAt the end of March, Luis González Macchi, former head of the Senate, was sworn in as president to head a new “government of national unity,” comprising members of all three major political parties. Under strong external pressure from the United States and the International Monetary Fund, the new government announced its commitment to reform civil service, to privatize industry, and to mandate greater civilian control over Paraguay’s armed forces. But Colorado Party supporters of the assassinated vice president and former members of the Stroessner regime occupied key positions in the new government. They remained wedded to a corporatist style of politics that was opposed to fundamental reform.\n\nParaguay in the 21st century\n\nContinued rule by the Colorado Party\n\nAfter a decade of stagnation, the Paraguayan economy revived, spurred by rapid growth in soybean production. Indeed, Paraguay was one of the world’s largest exporters of soybeans at the beginning of the 21st century. However, despite faster economic growth, unemployment and crime rates remained high as the government failed to address the urgent need for land reform and industrialization. There was growing resentment at Paraguay’s subordinate role within the region, including calls to leave Mercosur, a South American regional economic organization. Also of concern were the terms of the hydropower Itaipú Treaty with Brazil (1973), which many Paraguayans saw as inequitable. Gonzalez’s term in office was scarred by corruption charges, and on April 27, 2003, Colorado Party candidate Nicanor Duarte Frutos won the presidential election, promising to fight corruption in his party and in his country. During his presidential term Duarte removed six judges from the Supreme Court who were suspected of corruption, introduced tax reforms, and pursued efficient macroeconomic policies. In June 2004 Oviedo returned from exile and was imprisoned for his 1996 convictions; he was paroled in 2007. In the historic 2008 presidential election, former bishop Fernando Lugo of the center-left coalition Patriotic Alliance for Change (Alianza Patriótica para el Cambio; APC) defeated Blanca Ovelar of the Colorado Party, ending that party’s 62 years of continuous rule.\n\nJohn Hoyt Williams R. Andrew Nickson\n\nThe Lugo interregnum\n\nIn 2009 it was discovered that Fernando Lugo had fathered a son while he was still a bishop. Other paternity claims were filed against him shortly afterward. Lugo was urged to step down, but he said that he would fulfill his five-year term. In April 2009 Lugo and Bolivian Pres. Evo Morales signed an accord settling the border dispute over the Chaco region that had caused the Chaco War in the 1930s. They blamed foreign intervention for fueling the war. In 2010, largely in response to his advocacy of Venezuela’s ascent into Mercosur, Lugo lost the support of Vice Pres. Federico Franco of the center-right Liberal Party, who had been a key player in the broad coalition that brought Lugo to power.\n\nLugo’s attempts to introduce land redistribution were blocked by ranchers and large landowners as well as by the Colorado Party. After 17 people were killed when peasant farmers clashed with police who were evicting them from land in eastern Paraguay on June 15, 2012, Lugo came under criticism that culminated in his impeachment by the Chamber of Deputies on June 21. The next day the Senate quickly convicted Lugo of incompetence (39–4), removed him from office, and replaced him with Franco until an election could be held. Initially Lugo acceded to his dismissal, but within days he sought its reversal, calling the action a “parliamentary coup.” A number of Paraguay’s neighbors also questioned the legality of Lugo’s removal, including Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, all of which recalled their ambassadors from Paraguay. Moreover, both UNASUR (a South American intergovernmental organization) and Mercosur suspended Paraguay. As time passed, however, few Paraguayans came to Lugo’s defense.\n\nR. Andrew Nickson\n\nThe Horacio Cartes presidency\n\nIn April 2013 the Colorado Party regained the presidency when businessman and political neophyte Horacio Cartes, one of the wealthiest people in the country, defeated the Liberal Party’s Efraín Alegre by capturing some 46 percent of the vote to about 37 percent for Alegre. By late 2015 Cartes had reneged on his initial promise to clamp down on endemic corruption in the public administration by appointing individuals to senior posts on the basis of merit alone. Instead, he gradually came to an accommodation with traditional leadership of the Colorado Party, choosing to tolerate the patronage system in exchange for its support in Congress.\n\nThe next year—while Latin America’s longest-running civil war, between the Colombian government and Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (“Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia”; FARC) guerrillas was apparently winding to a close—a rebel insurgency in Paraguay was heating up. In late August 2016, eight Paraguayan soldiers were killed in an attack in the town of Arroyito, in northern Paraguay. The roadside explosion and execution of the survivors was thought to have been carried out by the Paraguayan People’s Army (EPP), which was formally organized in 2008 but had been active for some two decades. The tiny Marxist group (thought to comprise only several dozen members) may have killed as many as 60 people since beginning its rebellion, which was carried out primarily with stolen weapons and funded through ransom kidnapping.\n\nDespite broad fluctuations, Paraguay’s GDP expanded by an average of about 5 percent from 2008 to 2017, benefiting from the country’s export of beef and soybeans as well as from Cartes’s successful courting of foreign investment. Looking to capitalize upon this continued prosperity, Cartes sought to have the constitution altered to allow him to run for an another term as president. Determined to prevent the ascendance of another Stroessner-like strongman, the country’s 1992 constitution limited Paraguayan presidents to one term. After a Senate vote to amend the constitution failed in August 2016, members of the Colorado Party began holding “alternative” sessions that were attended by only some members of the opposition. In one of these sessions, on March 31, 2018, 25 senators (two more than a majority of the normally 45-seat body) voted to amend the constitution to allow Cartes to run again for the presidency. The opposition, however, declared that the vote by the “alternative” Senate was illegal, arguing that approval by a constituent assembly was required to amend the constitution to change presidential term limits. Seemingly as outraged by the senators’ political end run as they were by the amendment itself, protesters invaded the Congress building on March 31 and set fire to it. By mid-April, Cartes had demurred and announced that he no longer intended to seek reelection. Moreover, before the month was over, the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of Congress) had rejected the amendment.\n\nThe presidency of Mario Abdo Benítez\n\nWith Cartes sidelined, the Colorado Party chose Mario Abdo Benítez, a 46-year-old former senator, as its candidate in the April 2018 presidential election. Abdo Benítez, whose father had been Stroessner’s private secretary, shared a pro-business socially conservative outlook with his main competitor, Alegre, who ran as the candidate of the Liberal Party and the GANAR (Gran Alianza Nacional Renovada, “Great Renewed National Alliance”) coalition. Some preelection opinion polling found Abdo Benítez to have a 20 percent lead over Alegre, but the actual contest proved much closer, as Abdo Benítez captured the presidency by taking a little more than 46 percent of the vote to about 43 percent for Alegre. The remainder was divided among eight other candidates.\n\nArguably the biggest challenge that Abdo Benítez faced as president was leading Paraguay’s response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, which began sweeping the world in early 2020. Because Paraguay was quick to close its borders and impose other measures aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the potentially deadly disease COVID-19, the country fared better than many of its neighbors in the early stages of the pandemic. However, when Paraguay’s health care system struggled to respond to a surge of the contagion that began in March 2021, many people blamed Abdo Benítez, especially for the limited amount of vaccines that were available in the country. Protesters took to the streets, and in the Chamber of Deputies an unsuccessful attempt was made to impeach the president (it was rejected by a 42 to 36 vote). By October 2022, with the virus under control, Paraguay had removed most COVID-19-related health protocols, but resentment of Abdo Benítez’s handling of the public health crisis remained.\n\nAbdo Benítez and the Colorado Party were also the targets of corruption accusations. Former president Cartes, who remained the head of the party, was accused of money laundering and tobacco smuggling, and the current vice president, Hugo Veláquez, was tied to drug trafficking. In January 2023 both men were sanctioned by the United States for “rampant corruption” as well as for their alleged involvement with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which the U.S. government considers a terrorist organization.\n\nAs the 2023 election approached, a rift developed in the Colorado Party that resulted in the faction led by Abdo Benítez supporting one candidate for the party’s presidential nomination and the faction led by Cartes backing another. In the end, Cartes’s handpicked candidate, former finance minister Santiago Peña, secured the nomination. In a field that included 12 other candidates, Peña’s principal challenger was Efraín Alegre, making his third run for president, this time with the backing of the broad Concertación coalition, comprising some two dozen political parties. Among the other contenders was far-right candidate Paraguayo (“Payo”) Cubas.\n\nIn addition to the widespread disgust with the country’s seemingly endemic political corruption, economic concerns such as unemployment and inflation were central issues in the campaign, as was the matter of Paraguay’s relationship with Taiwan. Peña supported maintaining Paraguay’s longtime economic ties with Taiwan, whereas Alegre advocated abandoning Taiwan and pivoting to China, which offered a huge potential market for Paraguayan beef and soybeans. Opinion polling indicated that the race between Peña and Alegre would be tight, but the results were anything but close, as Peña coasted to a commanding victory, capturing nearly 43 percent of the vote, compared with only about 27 percent for Alegre. The election’s other big surprise was the unexpectedly strong showing by Cubas, who garnered nearly 23 percent of the vote and seemingly played the role of spoiler for Alegre by siphoning off a large chunk of antiestablishment voter. In the national legislative elections, the Colorado Party captured majorities in both the upper and lower chambers. It also was victorious in 15 of 17 gubernatorial contests.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
