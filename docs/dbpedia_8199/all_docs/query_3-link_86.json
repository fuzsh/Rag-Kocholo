        "text": "Over centuries of colonisation and battles over the rights of native Guaran√≠ people in Paraguay, their language not only survived but became a sign of identity. And as such, it is also a vital part of the current election campaign.\n\n\"Yaiko poraveta\" (\"We will be better\"), assures pro-government candidate Santiago Pe√±a.\n\n\"O√∫ jina\" (\"Change is coming\"), replies opponent Efra√≠n Alegre.\n\nThe slogans of the election campaign in Paraguay are spelled out in Guaran√≠, which is one of the two official languages in the country since 1992.\n\nWith a population of 7.5 million, Paraguay is home to just about 117,000 Indigenous peoples. But the Guaran√≠ language is spoken by almost 90 per cent of the population and is taught in all schools.\n\nPeople in Paraguay are descendants of colonisers and native Guaran√≠ indigenous people.\n\n\"That mixture became more refined, but it turned us Paraguayans into people deeply attached to their identity, \" says historian Jorge Rubiani. \"And in that identity the Guaran√≠ language played a very important role.\"\n\nFor writer, translator and teacher Mar√≠a Gloria Pereira, dedicated to book publishing, Guaran√≠ is a language still very present, very alive.\n\n\"The language is the only thing that totally belongs to us, that does not come from the other side, that is ours,\" she emphasizes.\n\nParaguayans are set to go to the polls on Sunday 30 April. Sunday's elections will elect a president for the next five years. And although many rallies have been held in Guaran√≠, there is no Indigenous representation in Congress and their situation, such as their land rights and poverty, is virtually absent from the debate."
