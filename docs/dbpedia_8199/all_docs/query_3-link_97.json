        "text": "In November 2023, Paraguay will host a meeting to address higher education challenges and promote digital learning in Latin America and the Caribbean. This event, bringing together Higher Education Networks and the Council of Rectors, spotlights the region’s education system struggles, specifically emphasizing higher education in Paraguay as the host country.\n\nX Meeting of Higher Education Networks and Councils of Rectors\n\nUniversity Networks and Rector’s Councils share the goal of accelerating technology integration in higher education. A digital divide exists within and between countries, manifesting as disparities between rural and urban areas regarding education and technology access. Socioeconomic differences also play a role, with higher-income families having greater access to further education and technology. Additionally, countries in the region have varying economic strengths and education systems.\n\nDigital and Educational Divide in Paraguay\n\nExamining the digital divide within Paraguay, systemic educational issues start in secondary school. Notably, 21% of children aged 12-17 in rural areas are out of school, compared to 11% in urban areas. Similarly, 31% of children from the poorest quintile in the same age group are out of school, while only 4% of children from the wealthiest quintile face this challenge. This data shows how socioeconomic status influences access to education. Specifically, children born into families within the poorest quintile, or in other words, born into poverty, are at a disadvantage. This applies to students at all levels of education but is especially apparent in higher education in Paraguay, such as secondary and tertiary levels.\n\nParaguay’s Higher Education System\n\nIn addition to these systemic barriers, Paraguay’s examination system restricts access to higher education, with only a small percentage of students making it into one of two colleges. As a result, holders of university degrees comprise less than 1% of the total population due to the structure of Paraguay’s university system. Students from poverty are not set up to succeed at these examinations, primarily due to previously discussed access issues.\n\nThere are two significant institutions of higher education in Paraguay, both located in Asunción—one Catholic and the other public. Private support for higher education is nearly nonexistent, except for contributions from the Catholic Church, making state funding essential but often inadequate. Consequently, public, tuition-free universities often suffer from limited funding and underpaid professors. As the public university does not have the funding to provide sufficient resources for students and staff, those with higher socioeconomic status may be able to provide for themselves, while students coming from poverty will need to rely on inadequate public resources and services.\n\nTechnology’s Role in Tertiary Education\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced significant changes in education, introducing online university education and technology integration into schools. The heightened reliance on technology showed that distance learning can make education accessible, offering potential solutions to bridge the digital divide and tackle inequalities in Paraguay’s tertiary education system. Rapid adoption of infrastructure for distance learning underscores the feasibility of prioritizing technology in schools.\n\nTechnology integration might need to begin earlier in the education pipeline to address systemic access issues in Paraguay’s education system, given that inequalities emerge in secondary school. A possible solution could involve government support to provide students, especially those in rural areas and lower socioeconomic backgrounds, including students living in poverty, with access to technology, thereby addressing the digital divide. Given the funding challenges in Paraguay, particularly at the university level, the government should establish dedicated national budgets and expenditures for education support and technology solutions.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the upcoming X Meeting of Higher Education Networks and Councils of Rectors in Paraguay promises to address the pressing challenges facing higher education and advancing digital learning across Latin America and the Caribbean. As described, the collaboration between University Networks and Rector’s Councils reflects a shared commitment to accelerating technology integration in higher education. The existence of a digital divide within countries, coupled with socioeconomic disparities, highlights the need for comprehensive solutions.\n\nIn Paraguay, where systemic issues begin in secondary school, addressing the digital and educational divide is of significant importance. Advocating for early technology integration in the education system, especially in underserved areas, is essential. Government support for providing technology access to students in rural and low-income backgrounds is crucial. Additionally, addressing funding challenges in Paraguay’s higher education system is imperative to ensure equal opportunities for all.\n\nAs leaders convene in Paraguay in November 2023, a collective effort will be underway to build a more equitable and technologically enabled higher education landscape in the region, acknowledging that this endeavor is central to the future of international societies."
