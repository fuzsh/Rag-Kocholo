        "text": "THE LAST OF THE RED HOT LOVERS, directed by Gene Saks, got 7 mixed reviews (Archer Winsten, Post; Allan Mottus, Women's Wear; Gene Shalit, NBC‐TV; Leonard Harris, CBS‐TV; Jeffrey Lyons, WPIX‐TV; Judith Grist, New York; Paul D. Zimmerman, Newsweek) and 11 negative reviews (Roger Greenspun, Times; Kathleen Carroll, News; William Wolf, Cue; Stanley Kauffmann, New Republic; John Simon, New Leader; Jay Cocks, Time; Arthur Knight, Saturday Review; Richard Schickel, Life; Rex Reed, News; Frances Taylor, Newhouse Newspapers; Bernard Drew, Gannett Newspapers).\n\nRoger Greenspun: “In the dismal history of Neil Simon screenplays and adaptations for the screen, ‘The Last of the Red Hot Lovers’ may represent the lowest ebb. Barney Cashman (Alan Arkin) is the lover. He has a wife, a house, a Buick, a successful seafood restaurant and, at 45, a desperate timid fear that life will never offer him any of its illicit goodies. So three times on his mother's charity day at Mount Sinai Hospital, he occupies her midtown apartment and makes assignations. Put them all together, and they make a convenience for a three‐act play. They make something of an embarrassment for a non‐three‐act movie.” At Radio City Music\n\nPOPE JOAN, directed by Michael Anderson, got I mixed review (Winsten) and 15 negative reviews (Wanda Hale, News; Howard Kissel, Women's Wear; Greenspun, Shalit, Harris, Lyons, Wolf, Simon, Cocks, Zimmerman, Knight, Schickel, Reed, Taylor, Drew).\n\nRoger Greenspun: “Considering that it fails absolutely and on every level, ‘Pope Joan’ really has a lot going for it. The filmmakers have cast their heroine as a contemporary small‐time evangelist who hallucinates herSelf as Pope Joan. This requires a modern explanation for each medieval event, and although the explanations are wholly meaningless, they do keep the film flashing in and out of the Middle Ages. Thus Joan will never know, for example, whether she is being raped in 9th‐century France or 20th‐century Kansas. But no matter what the times, she is not an altogether unwilling victim.” At Co‐ limbia I. ‘Pope Joan’ can suppress Liv Ullman's grave appeal — but I think she is being used to provide some Ingmar Bergman eroticism to balance the film's intermittent tone of Hollywood piety.” Columbia I.\n\nSLAUGHTER, directed by Jack Starrett, got 1 mixed review (Donald J. Mayerson, Cue) and 11 negative (Greenspun, Carroll, Winsten, Mottus, Harris, Lyons, Crist, Simon, Knight, Taylor, Drew).\n\nRoger Greenspun: “Except as another instance in the continued misuse of Stella Stevens, a talented and beautiful actress, there is almost nothing of interest in ‘Slaughter.’ It is a sex‐and‐violence melodrama—with heavy ambitions toward violence about a black ex‐Green Beret captain who begins by seeking revenge for his father's gangland murder in Cleveland and ends by more or less demolishing half of Central America for the F.B.I., or the C.I.A., or the I.R.S.—or whatever Government agency is supposed to be making use of him. Jim Brown plays Slaughter as if he hated doing it, which is to his credit.” At the Penthouse, 59th St. Twin I, RKO\n\nMELINDA, directed by Hugh A. Robertson, got 1 favorable review (Winsten), 2 mixed (Howard Thompson, Times; Zimmerman) and negative (Carroll, Crist, Wolf, Simon, Drew).\n\nHoward Thompson: “I liked ‘Melinda, a blistering suspense melodrama framed within a whodunit format, even though a beautiful doll named Vonetta McGee, in the title role, drops out of the picture early, slashed to ribbons. Furthermore, the film ambles for a full 30 minutes without a clue to its aim or content and the language is aggressively monotonously ‘with it'—filthy. The rest is strictly O.K. With a good cast headed by Calvin Lockhart as the fiery hero and the expressive Rosalind Cash, eagleeyed direction by Hugh A. Robertson and a nimbly turned script by Lonne Elder 3d, ‘Melinda’ is an engrossing tingler.” At the Trans‐Lux East, West and 85th St.\n\nSNOOPY, COME HOME, directed by Bill Melendez, got 5 favorable reviews (Donald J. Mayerson, Cue; Thompson, Winsten, Shalit, Crist), 1 mixed (Kevin Saviola, Women's Wear) and 2 negative (Hale, Drew).\n\nHoward Thompson: “This sprightly, clever and hilarious treat—all that a comic strip should be on the screen—is even better than ‘A Boy Named Charlie Brown,’ which began the series. And wise parents who have been praying for something right for the youngsters—neither tame nor ickypoo—should light out immediately for the Guild Theater.”\n\nBOXCAR BERTHA, directed by Martin Scorsese, got 3 favorable reviews (Thompson, Lyons, Mayerson), 3 mixed (Andrew Sarris, Village Voice; Winsten, Taylor) and 2 negative (Reed, Drew).\n\nHoward Thompson: “Here is an interesting surprise. Set in the South and Southwest of the Depression years, ‘Boxcar Bertha’.is the drama of two derelict criminals and sweethearts who finally meet a horrible doom. While there is a striking similarity to ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ in general content, background, fine color photography and even the use of hillbilly music, the new, more modest film stands curiously on its own. The main reason is the character of the hero, a kind of stumblebum union organizer, whose battered altruism sharply reflects the labor despair of the era, even as he detours into crime and wars on the railroad bosses. David Carradine is excellent in this role. Matching him, as the childlike boxcar itinerant, is Barbara Hershey. The whole thing has been beautifully directed by Martin Scorsese, who really comes into his own here.” At neighborhood theaters.\n\nSTIGMA, directed by David E. Durston, got 2 favorable reviews (Thompson, Reed), 2 mixed (Winsten, Kissel) and 1 negative (Meyerson).\n\nHoward Thompson: “'Stigma,’ a screen warning about venereal disease, turns out to be not a luridly flapping sermon but a crackling good suspense melodrama that forcefully nails the real villain—an undetected outbreak on a small island. This expertly constructed film moves so fast, says so much about human nature in general and packs its warning into such gripping entertainment that the effect is a jolt. ‘Stigma’ is not a pretty picture. But it packs a vivid crunching wallop that may do good where it should.” the Forum."
