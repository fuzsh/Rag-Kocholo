        "text": "A full on rabies infested satanic hippie sabbath, injected with paranoia, drug fueled cannibalistic madness, and an escalating sense of absolute mayhem covered in layers of disturbingly thick grime. Imagine what hell a satanic hippie after eating a rabies injected meat pie would be like, hacking off a guys leg (after brutally stabbing his LSD soaked body 10 times) and chasing after you with an axe in one hand and hacked off leg in the other.\n\nI Drink Your Blood lands in the middle ground between Night of the Living Dead and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, joining the latter as one of two movies that (upon first viewing) I was completely in the dark on whatever journey our director chose to send…\n\nListen, all I’ll say is that the people who mocked Michael Scott’s Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer Memorial Celebrity Rabies Awareness Pro-Am Fun Run Race for the Cure clearly had never seen this movie.\n\nYou think antagonistic Manson-esque Satanic hippies are bad? Well, how about antagonistic Manson-esque Satanic hippies WITH RABIES! Low budget grindhouse exploitation gorefest extravaganzas really don’t get more outrageous than this, featuring shit as egregious as people lighting themselves on fire, a pregnant woman stabbing her own stomach on purpose, and animals getting legit murdered onscreen (apparently it was just that one chicken, but idk, the amount of other seemingly freshly dead rabbits & goats & rats is super sus). It definitely does nothing to contradict the myth…\n\nAny movie that begins with Fire, Ominous Wahs, and A Naked Hippie With A Sword telling other Naked Hippies that he is the Firstborn Son Of Satan and giving them his blood to drink from a chalice while there is another Naked Hippie Laying Down As A Human Altar with a human skull atop their genitals is probably going to be worth seeing for at least its moral/educational value, and also for the insanely spray-painted Satanic Hippie Death Cult Bus which has what I certainly hope is a good-natured portrait of Satan because otherwise The Great Infernal Majesties might get displeased? This is like an old-school Public Service Movie alerting folks that if the Sons And Daughters Of Satan come…\n\nHooptober X: Now With 20% More Horror!\n\n“Let it be known, sons and daughters, that Satan was an acid-head. Drink from his cup. Pledge yourselves. And together, we'll aaaalll freak out!”\n\nYou can hate his methods all you want people, but that boy understands that the only way to dispose of filthy hippies properly is with extreme prejudice.\n\nQuite possibly the greatest exploitation film of all time.\n\nThis film embodies what exploitation is. It’s a grainy, feverish, sweaty nightmare of absurd proportions. It’s aggressively sweaty, you feel the heat and see the stress in every person. The film is grotesquely sleazy with gratuitous gore and nympho nudity throughout. It’s perfect.\n\nIt’s freakishly weird plot is incredible. What starts out as…\n\nA group of Satanist hippies rape a local girl and then take up residence in an abandoned motel. When the grandfather of the girl confronts the group they drug him with LSD and he barely escapes with his life. Sickened by the whole situation, his young grandson kills a rabid dog and injects it's rabies infested blood into a dozen meat pies that are then sold to the rotten group inadvertently causing an outbreak of rabies zombies.\n\nAs soon as I saw that infamous Grindhouse Releasing splash screen, and heard the timeless jingle I knew I was in for either something really bad or something really good. Fortunately this was a good one and it all starts with the premise…\n\nI Drink Your Blood thoroughly revels in its sheer trashiness; to the point where the poor production values, bad writing and low quality special effects actually become it's main asset! This is a film of two halves, with many genre elements sprinkled in between. The film starts off as a sort of hedonistic devil worshipping exploitation flick and then morphs into a trash version of Night of the Living Dead midway through. The plot is entirely freewheeling and it's never clear where things are going to end up. It could be said that the film is lacking in purpose - or you could argue that it keeps the audience on its toes! There's plenty of fake gore and this is…\n\nThis is a wild one. It pits a violent cult of hippie dregs against a dying small American town and turns both sides into their most monstrous forms through a rabies outbreak. The film preys on the fears stoked by the Manson killings of the sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll generation but blows its social references from the era so comically out of proportion that you clearly aren’t meant to take it all that seriously. When I first heard about this film, it seemed to mostly be recognized for its rabid flesh-eating violence. It’s certainly still shocking today, but it’s the sense of humor that really sticks out to me. I particularly love how the film counters some of…"
