        "text": "NIGHT OF THE BASTARD *** USA 2022 Dir: Erik Boccio. 82 mins\n\nSometimes you go what did I just watch? Whether it was something on a sports broadcast like a goal or a catch that defies even the replay, that feeling can creep in when watching a film that you sit and go what am I watching and why is this happening?\n\nThat’s what happened to yours truly viewing Erik Boccio’s Night Of The Bastard (2022). In spite of its lurid title, contrary to some this is not an election night thriller for those that follow such things in these questionable times. In fact, the picture comes across as a ‘Video Nasty” when that title meant something. Reminiscent for me of David E Durston’s notorious I Drink Your Blood (1971), tossing on Wes Craven’s The Hills Have Eyes (1977) and elements from many homicidal cult genres. Quite the bastard child this is from those influences.\n\nFrom the first frame, you realize that this is going to be a piece of human brutality when you have a prologue of a young couple Andy (Luke B. Carlson) and a pregnant Lily (Avery Joy Davis) who oddly looks like Liv Tyler and the recently real-life deceased Jane Birkin. The couple is driving to a friend’s place for a celebration yet when they go into the home, the atmosphere is filled with apprehension as one knows this is not going to turn out too well. It really doesn’t as a murderous rampage starts by what turns out to be a cult with shades of Charles Manson.\n\nCut (no pun intended) to later in the evening when the cult is one full display with various victims strapped to chairs or poles outside. The cult is about the birth of a deity or demon and what follows is not for the squeamish. Not on par with A Serbian Film (2010), Martyrs (2008) or Nekromantik (1987) you get the removal of Lily’s baby via a brutal caesarian all witnessed by her husband Andy who is strapped to a chair.\n\nShifting a few years into the future a gravely injured young woman Kiera (Mya Hudson) who has interacted with the same cult along with her camping friends stumbles across the secluded desert home of reclusive hermit Reed (London May). Reed is an odd fellow in a film with all odd fellows in that he rejects company, lives off the grid, and adores his pet turtle, Marlon. With a malicious Satanic cult in hot pursuit, Reed must defend himself, his homestead (including turtle) and his uninvited guests from wave after wave of violent attacks.\n\nErik Boccio’s gritty grindhouse delivers visceral action of the low-budget style from shotgun blasts, blow to the head, brutal fights and the sealing of wounds with a staple gun and glue. This is all done with practical effects in basically a ranch set with some exteriors in which you can see what looks like headlights from a major highway in the distance.\n\nNight Of The Bastard (2022) has some strong performances that you would have to have to match the action on the screen. London May does the grizzled old, grump that just wants to be left alone with his turtles very well. He reluctantly begins to defend his property and help Kiera because he has no choice. Hannah Pierce is enjoyably nutty as Claire especially as the film enters its even more demented phase when revelations are made near a campfire.\n\nInterestingly one of the people cited in the end credits is the Director of the recent Brooklyn 45 (2023) Ted Geoghegan. Christian Ackerman is one of the Producers who has many credits in the genre, who compiled three books of essays on Classic Horror called My Favorite Horror Movie and worked with Joe Bob Briggs.\n\nNight Of The Bastard (2022) is a slimy grim, look on ‘70s action thriller with members of the Satanic cult look like in my opinion members of the Manson cult. You get to figure out who the bastard is that the title refers to. The gore level is high some of the plot revelations may leave you shaking your head as they occur fast. The screams on the screen will take you back to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) days, which fits this film’s style. This film will get you talking due to its no holds barred approach which works well and is not gratuitous to the story. A new ‘Nasty’ in the age of the slow burn.\n\nReview by Terry Sherwood\n\nNIGHT OF THE BASTARD is available to order on Limited Edition Blu-ray from Graveface Distribution:\n\nhttps://graveface.com/products/night-of-the-bastard-blu-ray-with-slip"
