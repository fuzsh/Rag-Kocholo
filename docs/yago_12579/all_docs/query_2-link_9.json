        "text": "What Is Kombucha?\n\nKombucha is a fizzy, fermented drink typically made with either green or blackÂ tea. Although it is sometimes referred to as kombucha mushroom tea, it is not made with fungi. The âmushroomâ is something called a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast, or SCOBY. When added to sweet tea and fermented, it creates healthful bacteria and B vitamins.Â For this reason, it has been labeled as a functional beverage, which is any nonalcoholic drink with ingredients added to create health benefits.\n\nAlthough relatively new to the United States, kombucha has been around for more than 2,000 years. It was first brewed in China and then spread to Japan and Russia. It became popular in Europe in the early 20th century. Sales in the United States are on the rise because of its reputation as a health and energy drink.\n\nThere are many claims that kombucha helps relieve or prevent a variety of health issues â from obesity and cardiovascular disease toÂ cancer and diabetes. Scientists continue to search for evidence to back up these claims and prove why some elements of the drink may be good for you.\n\nKombucha Ingredients\n\nThe basic ingredients in kombucha are yeast,Â sugar, and tea. The mix is set aside for a week or more. During that time, bacteria and acids form in the drink, as well as a small amount ofÂ alcohol. (Alcohol levels are typically below 0.5%.) This process is known as fermentation, and itâs similar to how cabbage is preserved as sauerkraut or kimchi, or how milk is turned into yogurt.\n\nKombucha SCOBY\n\nKombucha requires bacteria and yeast to begin the chemical process of fermentation, which gives it flavor and nutrition. The mutually beneficial â or symbiotic â relationship is formed when yeast breaks down the sugar added to the tea, which, in turn, feeds the bacteria that creates acid in the form of vinegar. When the SCOBY is added to sweet tea, it forms a film or spongy, jelly-like substance on top. This is why it is often referred to as a mushroom, although it is not a fungus. You might also hear it called the kombucha mother.\n\nHow to make kombucha\n\nYou need a SCOBY to start your first batch of homemade kombucha. You can save the SCOBY and use it for future batches of kombucha.Â\n\nBasic kombucha recipe:\n\nÂ¼ cup loose green or black tea in mesh bags or 4-8 tea bags\n\n1 gallon of filtered water\n\n1 cup cane sugar\n\n1-2 cups kombucha starter liquid (often comes with your SCOBY or can be purchased)\n\n1 SCOBY\n\nAdd black or green tea to boiling water. Stir in sugar. Remove tea leaves or tea bags after approximately 10 minutes. Allow tea to cool to room temperature before pouring it into a large glass or stainless steel container and adding the SCOBY. You may also add a little vinegar and other flavorings, such as fruit puree, spices, or herbs. Cover the jar opening with cheese cloth or a coffee filter and secure with a rubber band to prevent contamination.Â\n\nAllow to ferment at room temperature for 7-10 days. Keep at least 1-2 cups to use as starter liquid for your next batch, and then refrigerate the rest to stop fermentation. If fermentation continues beyond 10 days, your kombucha could turn to vinegar.\n\nNote: To avoid contamination from mold or harmful bacteria that could cause illness, always wash your hands thoroughly and sterilize any container you use to brew or store kombucha.\n\nDoes kombucha have alcohol?\n\nBecause kombucha is fermented, it does contain a low level of alcohol. Alcohol levels are typically below 0.5%.\n\nDoes kombucha have caffeine?Â\n\nWhen kombucha is made with green, black, or other caffeinated tea, it will contain caffeine. But the caffeine levels is very low -- less than 15 milligrams per cup. Â\n\nIs Kombucha Good for You?\n\nFor centuries, kombucha has been drunk for its health benefits. The fermented tea contains vitamins, trace minerals, and antioxidants -- compounds that can protect your cells from damage. It doesnât contain fat or cholesterol and is low in sodium. ItÂ also contains probiotics, which are good bacteria that can improve gut health. That said, there is little scientific research to back up the many health claims manufacturers and avid kombucha fans make.Â\n\nKombucha calories\n\nAn 8 ounce serving of unflavored kombucha has about 30 calories, 2-3 grams of sugar, and a small amount of caffeine. Adding flavorings or fruit to kombucha may boost the nutritional value, calories, and sugar content.Â\n\nKombucha Health Benefits\n\nDrinking kombucha may provide a variety of health benefits, from aiding in digestion to ridding your body of toxins and boosting energy levels. Itâs also said to help yourÂ immune system, help youÂ lose weight, ward offÂ high blood pressure andÂ heart disease, and prevent cancer. But thereâs not a lot of evidence to support these claims.\n\nKombucha and digestion\n\nFermented products in general are good for the microbiome and gut health. Fermentation makesÂ probiotics, which help with constipation,Â diarrhea, andÂ irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). But there's not enough research to show how these probiotics work. Experts say it's better to get your probiotics from a plant-based diet until we know more.Â\n\nKombucha and your immune system\n\nSince kombucha is made from either black or green tea, you get the benefit of teaâs natural antioxidant properties. Antioxidants help protect cells against damage. The process of fermenting the tea may increase these immune boosters.Â Gut health has been linked with the immune system, so probiotics that improve your gut health may also help strengthen your immune system.Â\n\nFor this reason, the CDC recommends drinking only 4 ounces of kombucha daily. Overconsumption can lead to side effects, including headache, nausea, and upset stomach. Â\n\nIs kombucha safe?\n\nWhen properly prepared and drank in moderation, kombucha is generally considered safe.Â\n\nIs kombucha safe during pregnancy?\n\nIf youâre pregnant, experts advise against drinking homemade or store-bought kombucha. There are two primary reasons: alcohol and caffeine. Because kombucha may contain even a low level of alcohol, itâs considered a risk to pregnant women. Likewise, the caffeine levels in kombucha may not be ideal for moms-to-be. There is also the possibility of bacterial contamination in kombucha, especially if made at home.\n\nIs kombucha safe for kids?\n\nKombucha is not recommended for young children. Older children may enjoy kombucha, but because it contains caffeine and small amounts of alcohol, experts recommend limiting your childâs daily kombucha consumption.\n\nCan you drink kombucha every day?\n\nIf you are pregnant or have a weakened immune system due to illness or treatment for an illness, you should avoid drinking kombucha. Otherwise, in moderation, you can drink kombucha daily.Â\n\nWhere to Buy Kombucha\n\nToday, commercially produced kombucha drinks can be purchased in most grocery and convenience stores and ordered online. If you want to make kombucha at home, kombucha kits, including the starter liquid and SCOBY, may be purchased online or specialty health food stores.\n\nHow long is kombucha good for after opening?\n\nStore-bought kombucha may last in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week after opening. After a week, your kombucha may lose its fizz and nutritional value. Kombucha gone bad will smell and taste vinegary and may look cloudy or slimy âÂ and should be thrown away."
