Or did someone else kill Lisa?",

        "text": "As can be expected, Durston was ahead of many of his peers, though unfortunately none of the areas in which he shows competence are able to redeem his debut's sluggish pacing and thoroughly uninspired hallucinatory sequences, among other issues. Some very decent performances, photography, and thematic implications but very little of actual substance (no pun intended) in sight. Could have been Giallo Americana, but unfortunately it lost me long before that good shit kicked in.\n\nThis movie can't seem to make up it's mind what it wants to be, whether a grimy sexploitation flick or an LSD scare film, and there's just enough incompetence behind the camera to turn it all into an eccentric but entertaining stew of half baked ideas. The basic premise seems to be that LSD can lead to enlightenment or psychotic rage, but the hero's epiphany that he'd rather fuck a statue come to life than his cruel, taunting girlfriend isn't that enlightening. The murder mystery piece isn't all that mysterious either and, like everything else in this movie, just comes off as weird. Beware Japanese pop singer gals who traffic in mind expanding drugs apparently, because that way lies madness. Then again, who needs drugs when you can just watch crazy shit like this?\n\n\"You're nothing but a big beautiful bowl of mush, baby. And without me, you're just one step away from the parade of pimps!\"\n\nWeird, erotic little movie about how LSD sugar cubes will turn you into a serial murderer. The pacing was terrible (the murder doesn't happen until there's 20 minutes left) and some of the acting was atrocious (especially from a super young Harvey J. Goldenberg as Stan, which is weird since he's one of the few actors from this thing to go on to do anything else). Also, kinda lame that your wild drug trip hallucination is a low-effort rehash of Pygmalion and Galatea.\n\nI would like to go to that loft party, though. Find yourself a dealer who will accept payment in smooches.\n\nDirected by David Durston, who went on to expand on the idea’s at play here greatly in the homicidal hippie classic I Drink Your Blood, The Love Statue is notorious for being arguably the first film to be about LSD. To be honest, the drug doesn’t play very heavily into the film, and being from 1965, it feels like its stuck in-between the Beatnik-era flicks that proceeded it (especially Roger Corman’s A Bucket of Blood) and the more overtly exploitive drug films that were right around the corner (like Corman’s The Trip; these guys must have been on the same wavelength). For a sexploitation flick, it just doesn’t titillate very much and as an exploitation flick, it just doesn’t go far enough.\n\nFull Review: infini-tropolis.com/reviews/love_statue.html"
