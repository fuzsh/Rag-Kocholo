        "text": "Saturday, November 12\n\nThe 33rd Annual Olympia Film Festival presents\n\nALL FREAKIN’ NIGHT\n\n11:00pm doors / MIDNIGHT showtime\n\nHosted by Ian and Tori Bracken\n\n$20 general / $15 members\n\nFREE AFN T-SHIRT TO THE FIRST 50 PEOPLE IN LINE!\n\nHAXAN\n\nLive Musical Accompaniment by Birch Graft Ensemble\n\nGrave robbing, torture, possessed nuns, and a satanic Sabbath: Benjamin Christensen’s bizarre examination of witchcraft in the Middle Ages is a demonic witches’ brew of the scary, gross, and darkly humorous. Featuring live musical accompaniment by The Birch Graft Ensemble. Prepare yourself for a terrifying visceral experience of sight and sound.\n\nDirector: Benjamin Christensen / 1922 / Sweden / 76 min\n\nThe Birch Graft Ensemble:\n\nioe key\n\nGabriel Will\n\nrachel carns\n\nbrYan leFey\n\nI DRINK YOUR BLOOD\n\nWhat happens when a bunch of hippies stumble onto a batch of delicious, but tainted meat pies? For starters, these hippies aren’t exactly into peace and love. They’re into Satan. And when they arrive in a small town do some devil worshiping at a cemetery, they get on the wrong side of the locals, who don’t take kindly to their spree of crimes, torture and rape. The solution, according to a fed up little boy, is to serve up meat pies tainted with rabid dog blood. Zombies, chainsaws, pitchfork impaling, lots of rats, and gallons of gore add to the explosive craziness that overtakes the screen in this insanely bloody and violent classic that was originally banned, but has luckily been unearthed for your enjoyment.\n\nDirector: David E. Durston / 1970 / US / 90 min\n\nCAT IN THE BRAIN\n\nHorror movie master Lucio Fulci’s Cat in the Brain, is a mind-bending journey into the cracked psyche of a horror movie master. In this meta film which questions the nature of creative insight, Fulci plays a version of himself tormented by visions of his own conception. At night he’s plagued with nightmares as the terrifying creatures of his own creation inhabit his sleep. Are these murderous tendencies real or imagined? Is he really losing his grip? Seamlessly weaving in and out of reality and fantasy, Cat in the Brain is so hyper-surrealistic and supremely gory that it will feel like a cat is chewing on your brain, literally.\n\nDirector: Lucio Fulci / 1990 / Italy / 94 min\n\nTHE SINFUL DWARF\n\nThe Sinful Dwarf is one of the sickest and most disturbing films in grindhouse history, a masterpiece of depravity featuring horny newlyweds, drugged sex slaves, bizarre musical numbers and a cackling pint-sized pervert, played to perfection by the great Torben Bille. In a quaint, Danish town we meet Olaf, an evil dwarf who lures beautiful women back to his home only to lock them up in the attic and enslave them for sex. When a naive married couple decides to rent a room in the same boarding house they quickly begin to suspect the worst. Prepare yourself for a deranged landmark in cinematic horror that must be seen to be believed.\n\nDirector: Vidal Raski / 1973 / Denmark / 95 min\n\nDR. BUTCHER M.D.\n\nDr. Obrero has a lofty goal: to prolong human life. Too bad he’s completely inept, and completely evil. That’s why he’s better known as Dr. Butcher M.D. (Medical Deviate). When partially eaten bodies begin showing up around New York City hospitals suspicion falls on the malevolent doctor. Fleeing to a jungle island Dr. Butcher begins to conduct his bloody experiments on unsuspecting natives. His failures result in painful death. His successes create hulking zombies who stalk the jungle with an insatiable appetite to kill. Part cannibal movie, part zombie movie, and bursting with demented, gory goodness, Dr. Butcher MD is a rarely screened piece of Italian horror cinema that’s totally over top in the very best way.\n\nDirector: Marino Griolami / 1980 / Italy / 84 min"
