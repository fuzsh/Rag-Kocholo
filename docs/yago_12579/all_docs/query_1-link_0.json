        "text": "Men become animals and eat their victims! ... You will sit and watch this shocking ugliness splashing across the screen! ... Can you take it? ...\n\nSo goes the trailer for “I Drink Your Blood.” Widely released in 1971, the film has endured for four decades as a sanguinary cult classic. A staple of drive-ins and grindhouses nationwide, it is the picture for which its writer and director, David E. Durston, is best known.\n\nMr. Durston died on May 6 at 88. The death, at his home in West Hollywood, Calif., was of complications of pneumonia, his companion, John DiBello, said.\n\n“I Drink Your Blood” stars the Indian actor and dancer Bhaskar Roy Chowdhury as Horace Bones, the Mansonlike leader of a satanic hippie cult. Its plot is roughly this: Hippies descend on small town and do mean things to townsfolk. Boy tries to stop them by lacing meat pies with blood of rabid dog. Plan backfires: Hippies eat pies and become rabid zombies. Many townspeople also eaten.\n\nIn the course of the film, nearly every human appendage that can be severed is, on camera. Threatened with an X rating for violence, Mr. Durston made cuts to obtain an R.\n\n“The cuts were basically scenes of chopping off a head  things like that,” Mr. DiBello said amiably on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Durston hoped to call his film “Blood Phobia”; the final title, foisted on the picture by a distributor, humiliated him, Mr. DiBello said. But perhaps the title was the secret of the film’s staying power  all the more so as it let “I Drink Your Blood” be routinely double-billed with “I Eat Your Skin,” which had been specially retitled for the occasion. (Written and directed by Del Tenney, “I Eat Your Skin” had been made in 1964 as “Zombies,” a k a “Voodoo Blood Bath.”)\n\nFew mainstream newspapers reviewed “I Drink Your Blood.” The New York Times did, however, heap praise on one of Mr. Durston’s later films, “Stigma” (1972), a cautionary drama about venereal disease. The film starred a young Philip Michael Thomas, better known afterward for playing Detective Ricardo Tubbs on the television series “Miami Vice.”\n\nReviewing “Stigma” in The Times, Howard Thompson called it “not a luridly flapping sermon but a crackling good suspense melodrama.”\n\nDavid Edward Durston was born in Pennsylvania on Sept. 10, 1921. He began his career as an actor in regional theaters; while serving in World War II he appeared in “Winged Victory,” the Moss Hart drama produced by the Army Air Forces, which played on Broadway from 1943 to 1944.\n\nIn the 1950s, Mr. Durston was an associate producer of the television show “Your Hit Parade.” He also wrote scripts for the early science-fiction anthology “Tales of Tomorrow” and other shows.\n\nMr. Durston’s other films as a writer and director include “Felicia” (1964), “The Love Statue” (1965) and “The Blue Sextet” (1971); he also directed several gay pornographic pictures. In later years he was a freelance director and script doctor.\n\nA brief early marriage of Mr. Durston’s ended in divorce. Mr. DiBello, an actor and producer known professionally as Jack Damon, is his only immediate survivor.\n\nA few years ago, the distributor Grindhouse Releasing issued Mr. Durston’s uncut version of “I Drink Your Blood” on DVD. The uncensored film is like the original, only more so."
