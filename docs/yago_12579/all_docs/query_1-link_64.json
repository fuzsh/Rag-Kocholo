        "text": "Lynn Lowry achieved cult status early in her career, thanks to her work in the likes of George A. Romero’s The Crazies, David Cronenberg’s Shivers, and Paul Schrader’s Cat People. At the age of 75 and with over 100 acting credits under her belt, she’s still going stronger than ever.\n\nI recently caught up with the prolific horror icon at the Shawna Shea Film Festival in Worcester, Massachusetts. She was in attendance to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of her work in independent cinema, so we took the opportunity to discuss her career at length.\n\nBorn in Illinois and raised in George, Lynn moved to New York City in the late 1960s to pursue acting. Her first film role was The Battle of Love’s Return, a 1971 comedy directed by future Troma founder Lloyd Kaufman. Their meeting was pure happenstance, but Kaufman immediately saw something in the young actress.\n\n“I was auditioning for a film that John Avildsen was doing called Joe, and Lloyd was working on the film [as a production assistant],” Lowry explains. “He came in while I was waiting to audition. He saw me and ran right over to me and said, ‘We just lost our dream girl in my movie, and you would be perfect for it! We’re not paying anything, but we’d love to have you.’ That was the first time I got to work with him.”\n\nLowry had no idea they’d both still be working steadily five decades later, but she recognized his potential. “I certainly thought he was very intelligent. He went to Yale. He wrote the film, directed the film, edited the film, starred in the film, produced the film. I thought that he would continue to do things. I had no idea what route he would take.”\n\nHer next gig was her first in a long line of horror films: 1971’s I Drink Your Blood. While working as a waitress, she came across a casting call for a film called Phobia. “I went to the audition after I got out of work, and [writer-director] David E. Durston was packing everything up. I walked in and said, ‘Excuse me, is this where you’re auditioning Phobia?’ David was a very flamboyant man, and he turned around and looked at me and said, ‘Oh my God, I cast the whole film, but I must have you in it!'”\n\nShe dismissed it, having heard similar empty promises before, but two days later he called. “He said, ‘I’m making you a mute in the movie so I don’t have to write anymore dialogue. You’ll be a mute hippie in this group.’ That’s the reason that I’m uncredited, because my character was never in the script. My name was never on the cast list, so the people that did the credits didn’t even know I was in the movie.”\n\n1973 saw Lynn Lowry collaborate with Romero on The Crazies. “It was pretty amazing working with George, although honestly I hadn’t seen Night of the Living Dead, so I didn’t know how much he had done. We were in Pittsburgh, and it was really kind of drab and dirty. It was not the most glamorous of films to do.”\n\nShe describes working with Romero as a joy, with the only point of contention being her first on-screen death. “He was very supportive. We’d all go over to his hotel room after the shoot and have wine. I got along with him great, except on my death scene. I wanted to have a big death scene, and he didn’t want that. But I did what he wanted, and it turned out to be very good.”\n\nLynn made a cameo appearance in Breck Eisner’s 2010 remake, which was not as joyous. “It was a very stressful, very difficult experience. I got to this little motel in Iowa at about 7:00 at night, and my call was 5:00 the next morning. I had nothing to prepare, no lines. I got a call from the assistant director, and he said, ‘We’re all excited about having you! Are you all set with the hymn?'”\n\nIt was news to her that her character would be singing. “I’m thinking to myself, ‘$20 million budget, and no one told me I had to sing a hymn!’ So they have to get me the hymn, and I have to spend all night trying to learn it. They had a cassette but no cassette player, so they had to find someone who had one.”\n\nIt gets worse. “When I got to the set, they said I had to go see the stuntman. I got over there, and the stuntman says, ‘Okay, here’s your bike.’ I’m like, ‘What?'” Thankfully, she knew how to ride a bike, although it had been decades.\n\n“So now I’ve got to re-learn how to ride the bike, know the song, and then they were pushing me up an alley into the street, and I’m supposed to hit the pools of light from the sun on certain words from the song and go around Timothy Olyphant as close as I can. It was like 20 degrees out, so I had thermals on, but the director didn’t like it. He put me in a sleeveless cotton dress with pigtails and sneakers with little short socks. I was freezing.”\n\nHer work in the original The Crazies helped her get on Cronenberg’s radar for his first major production, Shivers. Producer (and future Ghostbusters director) Ivan Reitman traveled to New York to discuss the role with her before filming took place in Montreal.\n\n“I had never been to Canada before, so that was a lot of fun. The movie itself is the first of its kind with that sort of body horror. I got along great with David.” Cronenberg asked Lowry if she wanted him to slap her around to make her cry for a particularly emotional scene, to which the actress responded, “No, David. I can act.”\n\nShe felt she lacked on-screen chemistry with the leading man, Paul Hampton. “As it turned out, when I saw the film many, many years later, I found his indifference in the movie to really work for that character. For me as an actress, I wanted him to be attracted to me, but I thought, ‘Oh, yeah. That definitely was the right choice.'”\n\nLowry was able to channel her frustrations in the memorable pool scene. She smiles, “It was great fun to get to do that and give that parasite to him. I thought, ‘Yes! I get to shove that down his mouth!'”\n\nLynn Lowry and co-star Barbara Steele were given brandy to help keep them warm in the water, but working with extras proved to be more difficult to bear than the cold. “The scariest part was when all of the extras jumped in and were swimming toward us. They surrounded us and got on top of us. They’re wonderful people who want to be part of the film, but they have no technique, so they’re doing it for real.”\n\nLowry nearly made a cameo in the Soska Sisters’ 2019 remake of another early Cronenberg film, Rabid. “I was supposed to be the doctor’s wife, and they were going to make a mold of my head to be up on the wall. I guess it was too expensive, so they just put my picture on the bedside table. But I’m sure I am going to work with them at some point, because we mutually adore each other, so I’m excited about that possibility.”\n\n1976’s Fighting Mad found Lowry working opposite Peter Fonda on a Roger Corman production directed by future Oscar winner Jonathan Demme. “That was pretty awesome! It was all done in Arkansas. Peter was great. He was very professional. I don’t think he had quite come into his own yet as an actor.”\n\n“Scott Glenn and John Doucette were there too. We had a great time.” She continues, “Working with Jonathan was great. You can actually see in that film the beginning of his family dimension that you see in some of his later work. He was a very nice man.”\n\nLynn Lowry moved to Los Angeles around 1980 in an effort to get more work, leading to her appearance in the 1982 remake of Cat People. She cites her mauling scene as “one of the most challenging things that I ever had to do physically.” She had to fall down stairs front first, and the stunt coordinator was nowhere to be found.\n\n“The first time I went down the stairs, they forgot to take the nails out of the carpet, so my hands got cut and they had to take me for a tetanus shot. They just could not seem to get the shot, so I had to keep falling down.” Unfortunately, that was only the beginning of the problems that plagued the scene.\n\n“It was all because [Schrader] wanted me to, at the bottom of the stairs, roll over and have my bra pop open, because he always had to get every woman’s tits in the movie. They couldn’t get the bra to pop, so I kept having to do it. It was kind of insensitive.”\n\nShe adds, “They also couldn’t get the shot where the cat grabs my leg and pulls me under the bed. They had a mechanical cat claw, and it just didn’t work. I had to keep falling on my knee as if it was pulling me. Finally a crew member put a cat mitt on and grabbed my leg, but my whole knee was swollen, and I was covered in rug burns and bruises.”\n\nOn her third day filming the sequence, Lowry had to stand up for herself. “I finally said, ‘No, I won’t do it again. First of all, you need to pay me for the stunt work. Secondly, I want the stunt coordinator over here, and I want to be padded.’ I showed them my bruises, and I could hardly walk. I said, ‘If the padding doesn’t work, I want more money!’ I don’t think Paul was very happy with me at that point. The padding did not work, so I had to do it again.”\n\nFinding work in the crowded Los Angeles market proved to be difficult, resulting in sporadic on-screen appearances between the 1980s and the 2000s. “I think it was 1994 when I went on an audition for Roseanne, and there were like 200 women there for like a five-line part. There was every type of woman there, and I thought, ‘Oh, my god. I can’t do this anymore.’ So I stopped pursuing film work and I focused on my theater work.”\n\nLowry performed on stage in both New York and LA, in addition to singing with a jazz trio for a decade. It wasn’t until DVDs became ubiquitous that she was made aware of the cult following that her earlier work had garnered.\n\n“In 2003, I was contacted by Blue Underground for The Crazies and also Bob Murawski [of Grindhouse Releasing] for I Drink Your Blood. These movies started coming out on DVD, and I started realizing that I had a fanbase. I started doing conventions, and then I started being offered roles, and that’s how it all started up again.”\n\nLynn Lowry made up for lost time with a strong comeback, including a part in David Gregory’s segment from the 2011 anthology The Theatre Bizarre. “I had a great role. I got to cut someone’s head off. It was a very colorful short film, and I thought the actors were wonderful. I was really glad I wasn’t in that whole food scene, because it was disgusting. David did a great job. I love working with him.”\n\nIn 2016, Lowry was directed by fellow scream queen Debbie Rochon in Model Hunger, in which she was given the opportunity to play the antagonist. She cites it as one of her favorite roles. “I loved that. Villains are so much fun to play.”\n\nShe drew inspiration from her time in the theater to give her character a Southern twist. “I asked Debbie if we could make her Southern, because I could just feel that in her dialogue. I really made her like a schizophrenic Southern belle character, like Blanche DuBois,” referencing the lead character in Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\n“She had a certain kind of Southern charm and sexuality, and she was funny, plus all the pain and frustration and bitterness and anger underneath. When all that came together, it made this really psychotic character. It was very freeing to do.”\n\nOne of her latest projects is Guns of Eden, releasing next month, from Slime City director Gregory Lamberson. “That’s a completely different kind of role than I’ve ever done. She’s really a heroine in the film. She’s a real down-to-earth, no-bullshit farm woman. She confronts the bad guys. I got to hold a gun. It was fun!”\n\nWith a wide breadth of work under her belt, I was curious to hear some of Lowry’s favorite roles that are not as widely seen or discussed. The first that comes to her mind is 2009’s Basement Jack, which “had a pretty good budget but didn’t get much play. I don’t think hardly anyone has seen it.”\n\nShe describes it, “It’s about a serial killer that lives in people’s basements, but it’s very artistically done. I play his mother, who is the reason he’s a serial killer. All my scenes are in flashbacks in the ’50s, so they put me in period makeup and wardrobe. I think that movie is really good, and I’m shocked that it didn’t do better.”\n\nShe also praises 2013’s Torture Chamber. “There’s so many beautiful moments in the film. I get pulled apart on the rack, which I’ve never had that kind of death before. We were in a mine shaft, like 30 feet underground, and I was in a sleeveless gown, barefoot, tied to this rack with smoke blowing. But that was a fun one.”\n\nThere’s plenty more Lynn Lowry to look forward to, and she teased some of her upcoming work. “I just did a werewolf film called Wolf Hollow, where I play an over-the-hill movie star that’s stuck with this low-budget film crew that are making a film. We’re out in this region where there are werewolves. I’m looking forward to that.” Due out in 2023, the film features fellow genre favorites Felissa Rose and Hannah Fierman.\n\n“I have a film coming out called Fang. My character has Parkinson’s, and I’m so nasty. A mean, mean person. I’m driving my son mad, to the point where he feels he’s literally becoming a rat. It’s very dark, with some humor. Richard Burgin, who wrote and directed it, is a highly functional autistic person, so it was a very interesting project.” It will have its premiere later this month in Chicago.\n\n“I’m doing a film called The Omicron Killer, and I’m playing the captain of a police force. That’s a different role for me.” Currently in production, the film features Bai Ling and Rose. Lowry receives a co-executive producer credit.\n\nLynn Lowry has conceived stories for a few projects, but she also has an interest in directing. “I’m more of an idea person, as far as writing goes. I think it would be great fun to direct something, especially if I have a cinematographer who could actually direct it while I work with the actors. I don’t really know how to put it together so you can edit it, but that would be fun.”\n\nShe’s worked in a number of genres, but horror movies have followed her throughout her career. Thankfully, Lowry is a fan of the genre. “I like horror films that are more creepy and psychological, like The Ring, Let the Right One In, The Grudge, Audition, stuff like that. I like seeing the special effects on the slasher movies, but they don’t scare me, because I know how it’s all done.”\n\nShe touts The Omen as her all-time favorite horror film. “I think that’s a perfect film; the build, the actors. I just get chills thinking about how it becomes clear what’s happening. It’s a really great film.”\n\nOver 50 years into her career, Lynn Lowry shows no signs of slowing down. “I’m very grateful to have had this five-decade career and that I have so many wonderful fans that have watched my work and are still watching my work. I’m on Facebook and Twitter, so if anybody ever wants to shoot me a line I’ll do my best to get back. I’m always looking for great roles to play!”\n\nBemoaning how Hollywood treats its franchises these days is quite the cliche. So much so that it’s become a favorite pastime for movie geeks all over the world. It’s even more “basic” to spill ink about the nostalgia treadmill that no studio exec can resist jumping on with a glee usually reserved for kids in candy stores. Specifically, they seem to have an aversion towards moving forward and sowing new ideas on grounds fans deem oh-so sacred. And yet, here we are on the precipice of yet another vaunted horror franchise reaching into the past to chart its creative future.\n\nNeve Campbell’s recent comments about Scream’s seventh installment compared it to Halloween’s 2018 recipe. The irony is David Gordon Green’s film owes a debt to Halloween H2O. To say nothing of Scream 4, which already riffed on the idea of an older Sidney Prescott facing off with not only another deranged teenager in a Ghostface mask but also her survivor’s guilt and complicated feelings about her hometown. Notice a theme?\n\nHorror is overflowing with original ideas and stories; this isn’t about the genre. But there’s something to say about the fact legacy films can’t quit examining, well, their legacies. A longing for the “good old” days and fears of upsetting even moderately vocal fanbases created a cul-de-sac for franchise horror with no way out in sight.\n\nBefore going any further, this isn’t some new creatively bankrupt phenomenon. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Halloween famously tried that whole evolution thing in the 1980s. While connoisseurs appreciate those deviations now, those wild swings didn’t generate the necessary box office or fan response at the time. The Halloween franchise felt the sting so hard that they ensured everyone knew the fourth installment featured Michael Myers. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers was comfort food for those who found Halloween III: Season of the Witch a little hard to digest. But only to a point. While Halloween 4 looked like a series going back to basics for most of its runtime, it did something very different in its final minutes that telegraphed a unique direction going forward. And yet, that moment gets explained away and rendered moot by the time Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers arrives one year later.\n\nThe creative urge for something new constantly clashes with the business need for something that prints money. The dollars and cents worshipers at the top of the industry often believe that taking the most minor creative risks makes the most sense because it leads to more dollars.\n\nThat’s why Nancy and her dad couldn’t escape Elm St. Or why Michael rarely stopped chasing his relatives. Or even the improbability that the Brody’s couldn’t escape Great White Sharks even while vacationing in the Bahamas. As the calendar turned and fandoms grew more significant, the demand for that type of thing only got louder. To quote one of the great fictional philosophers of our imaginary time, Philip J. Fry, “Clever things make people feel stupid and unexpected things make them feel scared!” Futurama’s insight is a bit harsh, but there’s still some truth buried in the satire.\n\nIn some cases, shifting to tried and true formulas is somewhat understandable. While they’re tacit admissions that sometimes the best idea is the first one, they’re also, at times, necessary business decisions. John Carpenter never envisioned Halloween as more than one movie. The same goes for Wes Craven and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Dollars to donuts, that’s probably the same story for most films that morph into the two words familiar to most people reading this website: intellectual property. That distinction comes with responsibilities to shareholders and CEOs and, no pun intended, the lifeblood of some companies. Ghostface is no longer just a person in a Spirit Halloween robe and a cheap dime store mask; Scream’s chief killer is a brand.\n\nWhat was once taboo is now a t-shirt at almost any department store. There are Ghostface Funko Pops, ceramic mugs, backpacks, and even a hockey jersey for the little ones. Let’s keep it real: Scream and other franchises of its ilk have more in common today with McDonald’s or Burger King than the original horror flicks studios produce. That’s not an inherently bad thing, but it is a thing; viewing these properties through that prism makes the math add up. That’s why Jamie Lee Curtis found herself at the center of not one, but two Halloween “reboots” twenty years apart from one another. The movies about the psycho wearing the William Shatner mask established their formula in ’78, so no matter what, they always revert to something from that time period. Even the proposed Halloween TV series is a “creative reset” returning to… ’78.\n\nStaying trapped in the familiar is on the con side of the ledger when horror becomes more significant than just a simple movie. Easily discernible why? Sure. But can it also mean preaching to the same choir from one installment to the next? Also yeah.\n\nFede Alvarez embraced yesteryear with Alien: Romulus, but he believes he did so without alienating (pun very much intended) a new audience. “You never want an audience to go see a movie and furrow their brow thinking, ‘Who is this person?’ Why is half the cinema so excited about this man and I don’t know who he is?” said Alvarez in a recent interview. “It becomes an excess I’m not interested in.”\n\nHow one feels about the excesses of which he showed great interest in Romulus aside, his overall point rings true. Rooting franchises in their glory days means not making them relevant for today. Everyone involved becomes so focused on paying homage to the past or dealing with older characters that they don’t justify the present or chart a future. That’s precisely where Scream finds itself right now. There’s a lot to how the seventh entry arrived at this point. So much so that there isn’t enough ink to cover it all here. What matters now is the beloved series moving away from a story that attracted old fans and created new ones in favor of playing the hits. Given the circumstances, the creative team behind the next Scream didn’t simply break glass in case of emergency so much as they shattered it by throwing a 100 mph fastball in the form of the Sidney Prescott solution.\n\nFor several reasons, some that look incredibly cynical, Scream can’t escape the vicious cycle even though it charted new waters.\n\nWe had a new core cast. The Grim Reaper finally collected on Dewey Riley’s long-term debt. Sidney was out of the picture, and who knows how many more attempts on her life Gale Weathers could weather. Scream and Scream VI reflected on their legacy without bathing in it. The movies looked fresh through the eyes of new characters rather than being slavish to Generation X and Millennials. Scream 4’s original ending almost pulled off this same high-wire act in 2011 until it didn’t. Some people behind the scenes got cold feet in the 9th inning for whatever reason. Writer Kevin Williamson’s bold move went bye-bye in favor of the status quo. Almost 15 years later, the Scream franchise still suffers from chili digits. Sadly, it’s not the only one.\n\nFor a genre built on punk rock sensibilities, there’s far too much conformity and timidness at the top of the food chain. Cul-de-sacs keep us in comfortable places by design, but horror isn’t about comfort. It never was. The second these prominent properties remember that is the reason Target happily sells t-shirts to children with masked killers etched on the front, we might finally get off this road to nowhere."
