        "text": "Synopsis: A group of Satanic hippies wreak havoc on a small town. A young boy tries to get even after they victimize his sister and grandfather…with deadly results.\n\nAny time you see that “Grindhouse Releasing” splash screen and that all too familiar music starts, you know you’re in for a good time. This one is no exception. Things kick up right away on the outskirts of a dying town, with a dark fire lit scene, naked bodies and sacrificial animals. That’s right, we are watching a Satanic ritual (or at least a film version of it). A young girl is watching from the periphery and gets spotted. She is then tortured/raped by the group and sent on her way back to town. In a fury, her grandfather attempts to exact revenge on the group that has taken up residence in the abandoned hotel in town. Only to be dosed with LSD and brutalized himself. The younger brother takes things to the extreme to get even by lacing the Satanic groups’ food with rabies. Things quickly go south with Satanists foaming at the mouth, infecting the remaining residents.\n\nThis movie is batshit insane, but that’s what I’ve grown to love about 70’s exploitation cinema. Filled with demented scenarios, copious amounts of sketchy gore and tons of nudity. Originally billed as a double feature with I Eat Your Skin. These types of flicks are a time capsule of the nuttiness that was the horror genre prior to the slashers of the late 70’s/early 80’s. In this day and age, things like this just can’t be made anymore. Durston got himself an “X” rating for this one. Actually the first ever by the MPAA for violence alone.\n\nI’m usually pretty thorough with my exploitation stuff but this one just happened to slip through. Luckily Tubi is here to save the day. Films of this era tend to be my favorite just due to the fact that you know what you’re going to get, just not how it’s going to be thrown at you. They’re usually just 90 minutes of comedic gore filled goofiness and I’m all for that.\n\nJoin me again tomorrow and we’ll continue this crazy little journey down the horror rabbit hole."
