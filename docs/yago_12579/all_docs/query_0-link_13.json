        "text": "American director and screenwriter\n\nDavid E. Durston (September 10, 1921 â€“ May 6, 2010) was an American screenwriter and film director best known for directing the Charles Manson-inspired, horror movie I Drink Your Blood, released in 1971.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nDurston wrote and directed for the famous television series Playhouse 90 (1956-1960). He appeared in the DuMont Television Network series Chez Paree Revue in 1950.\n\nIn 1965, he directed The Love Statue, his first feature movie, which dealt with LSD use. His second feature was the 1971 exploitation horror movie I Drink Your Blood, about a cult of Manson Family-esque Satan-worshipping hippies who, after becoming infected with rabies, turn into zombies.\n\nDurston followed this with the dramas Blue Sextet (1971) and Stigma (1972), then shifted his career to hardcore gay porn with Boy 'Napped! (1975) and Manhole (1978), the latter of which was not released due to one of its cast members being cast in Escape from Alcatraz, as the association between him and gay pornography would hurt both his career and the Clint Eastwood film he'd appeared in later.\n\nIn later years, Durston attempted to develop a modernized remake of I Drink Your Blood, but the project was cancelled after his death.\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nDurston died on May 6, 2010, of complications from pneumonia.[1]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nAs film director:\n\nThe Love Statue (1965)\n\nI Drink Your Blood (1971)\n\nBlue Sextet (1971)\n\nStigma (1972)\n\nBoy 'Napped! (1975, as Spencer Logan)\n\nManhole (1978)\n\nAs screenwriter:\n\nThe Love Statue (1965)\n\nI Drink Your Blood (1971)\n\nBlue Sextet (1971)\n\nStigma (1972)\n\nBoy 'Napped! (1975, as Spencer Logan)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
