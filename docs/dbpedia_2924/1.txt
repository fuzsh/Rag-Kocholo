This is one among many of the avex group's labels.

Historically, releases should have an AV*D catalog number template, but this is shared with other labels. A "Korean artist" AV*K catalog number template was introduced in 2011 which further dilutes the relationship between the catalog number template and a label. Please check this list of catalog numbers for possible labels to use rather than "avex trax".

Note that "avex trax" is often erroneously used in place of AVEX INC. (manufacturer), AVEX ENTERTAINMENT INC. (holding company), and avex group.
