Trivia[]

The company name "Avex" is derived from "Audio Visual Expert".

Most prominent examples are SMILE-UP artists such as Kis-My-Ft2 and Snow Man, LDH artists such as EXILE, EXILE TRIBE, E-girls and Happiness, K-Pop artists such as BoA, TVXQ, BIGBANG, EXO, BLACKPINK and IKON, and international artists such as Bruno Mars, Hardwell and YELLOW CLAW.
