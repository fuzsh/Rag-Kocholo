        "text": "Were there different label colors for the VERVE record company during the 60s and 70s?\n\nI happen to have the 'Freak Out' album by the Mothers of Invention;it has the same catalogue number as the original 1966 release but it's not a haavy vinyl,plus I got quite cheap.Also, the label is not as blue as the original issue from the 60's but more of a grey/blue? Is that like a 70s reissue?\n\nAny help would be mostly welcome!\n\nThank you! I can tell that I don't have the original,since the inside of my gatefold album doesn't have the 'hot spot map';but still the site doesn't have the dates of the reissues..\n\nWhite labels were also contemporary promos.\n\nBlue with silver print were usually on the Mothers, except for Lumpy Gravy which is often found on the jazz related black with silver print. Also record club issues have been known to show up with black labels as well as Canadian copies.\n\nAccording to the site linked above, my FO lp is a stereo promo. Here is the pic from that site that looks exactly like the labels on my copy:\n\n<also pictured is the label from my lp of WOIIFTM, which is the \"Hollywood\" Verve label...same site source.\n\nThis site is most helpful as well, but has conflicting info in regards to the other site linked above. My white label may simply be a reissue from 1972-1975 instead of a promo copy according to lukpacs site...\n\nhttp://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/freakout.html#whitelabel\n\nAny mono Frank Zappa/Mothers Of Invention LP is rare.\n\nYou are very fortunate. While the mono We're Only In It For the Money and excerpts from the mono Freak Out! and Lumpy Gravy have been released on CD, none of the mono Absolutely Free has.\n\nThat Freak Out! pressing shown was from after 1977, and came from PRC Recording Corp. in Richmond, IN; the phototypesetting News Gothic Bold font used for label copy was the key to identifying. As for the \"Hollywood\" blue Verve copy of We're Only In It for the Money, that was a pressing from H.V. Waddell in Burbank, CA.\n\nI've got a bunch of MGM/associated test pressings (not Zappa) from the late '60s and early '70s and they almost all came from Waddell.\n\nIt looks like I have the exact same pressing as yours, incl. the black labels! The words \"Side 2\" are longhand written, and \"Side 1\", uppercase block letters. Deadwax of side 2 also features some quasi-microscopic initials, maybe ending with a \"j\".\n\nThe sonics of this pressing appear normal to me (though I have nothing else to compare it to). The only thing I could find slightly suspicious about this second-hand copy I have is that the resolution of the cover art is not fantastic, especially the front cover.\n\nAll I have ever had to compare it to was MP3s of vinyl rips, so I don't really know either. Fortunately, that changes in a few weeks.\n\nIf it is a fake, it isn't a bad one, unlike my copy of Introducing The Beatles.\n\nThat copy with the black label, I think it may be legit. Many copies of MGM LP's from the early 1970's had that 2.75\" circular ring, plus the Varityper Univers Bold for label copy (and uncoated paper stock). Just can't pin where it was pressed, though.\n\nThe mono Freak Out is on disc 1 of MOFO, isn't it?"
