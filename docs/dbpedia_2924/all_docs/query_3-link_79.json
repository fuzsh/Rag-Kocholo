        "text": "DESCRIPTION:\n\n2x12\" LP 8 Tracks 8 Artists Of Vocal Tech/ Minimal Techno & Prog House / Trance.\n\nDamian Lazarus presents the sixth volume of his Crosstown Rebels SPIRITS compilation series, boasting an impressive lineup of Lauren Lane, Cristina Lazic, AJ Christou, TMPLE and more.\n\nSince its debut in 2017, Damian Lazarus’ annual ‘SPIRITS’ series on Crosstown Rebels has been a beacon for breakthrough artists, setting the label’s agenda for the year ahead. The sixth instalment in February is another meticulously curated lineup with ‘SPIRITS VI’ featuring a blend of new and recognisable talents, including Lauren Lane, Cristina Lazic, Iñigo Vontier, AJ Christou and many more.\n\nLondon-based talent Cameron Jack kicks off what looks set to be a breakout year with ‘The Vision’, a bubbly and tropical cut with cosmic synths and loose, jumbled rhythms. Chris Bowl then brings his emotional style to the deep, rolling beats and fresh melodies of ‘Silent Plain’, while NY-born, LA-based house tastemaker Lauren Lane layers in smoky pads and tender whispers to her sublime deep house cut, ‘Fair Game.’ Next, German talent and Degree Records head Marc Lenz brings darker vibes to his track ‘People Are People’, while Rebellion artist Cristina Lazic and previous Lazarus collaborator Leia Contois combine for the alluring vocal soul and gritty minimal drums of ‘So Deep’.\n\nMexican Iñigo Vontier is a pioneer in his homeland after crafting a global reputation, and his twisted synths, shiny\n\ntextures and steely drums on ‘That Trippy Sound’ prove why as they work you into a trance. Next is influential Manchester-based DJ/producer AJ Christou, who has released on the likes of Hot Creations and Cuttin’ Headz. His track ‘Back & Forth’ brings an infectious groove with plenty of flair and catchy drum funk, before TMPLE shuts things down with the deft, airy grooves and floating bass of ‘The Girl In The Room’, complete with its tender male vocals.\n\nAt the forefront of electronic innovation, Crosstown Rebels stands as a pivotal platform and record label, reflecting the genre’s diversity and housing an impressive roster that includes renowned artists and household names like Art Department, Maceo Plex, and Jamie Jones. With sub-labels Rebellion and Secret Teachings in tow, the imprint consistently and continuously expands its musical canvas, creating an immersive landscape for leading and emerging talents to thrive.\n\nThe elegant ‘Mundo’ channels the machine soul of early Detroit techno, before ‘Mangabeira Manifesto’ featuring Dudu Bongo layers up wonky drums and bass with curling, soft acid sounds and a playful vocal line. ‘Triple Frontier’ picks up the pace and heads out on a high-speed cosmic house journey, all before ‘Overture’, another far-sighted astral trip with starry melodies and rich, rubbery bass, closes the package in fine style.\n\nAn expressive and adventurous yet coherent long player with a range of moods, feelings and grooves taking you to all corners of the house world, ‘Vista’ showcases Dabo’s most in-depth project to date and an album which provides the perfect platform for him to display his rich sonic universe.\n\nWarning!

The term Various Artists is used in the record industry when numerous singers and musicians collaborate on a song or collection of songs. Most often on Last.fm, compilation album tracks appear under the name of Various Artists erroneously because the individual artist is not listed in the album's ID3 information. Compilation albums, for example. Sometimes, single releases may be credited to Various Artists when their profits are going to charity and, usually in high-profile cases, are sometimes known by a group name. Examples include Band Aid with their releases of Do They Know It's Christmas? and USA for Africa with We Are The World. Various Artists is also an actual performance name for Torsten Pröfrock, who runs the German DIN label. Torsten performs also as Dynamo, Erosion, Resilent, Traktor besides some others. He's a good friend of Robert Henke and since the Fall of 2004, he is a member of Monolake. Various Artists was also a short-lived Bristol punk band formed by brothers Jonjo and Robin Key (originally from Birmingham). Other members were also simultaneously in Art Objects who went on to become The Blue Aeroplanes, the latter the Key brothers also co-wrote some songs and were involved in. When Various Artists imploded, the Key brothers went on to form Either / Or. Various Artists also appear on tracks from musical theater soundtracks, due to the nature of having many cast members on one song, as well as an ensemble in some cases. Read more on Last.fm.
