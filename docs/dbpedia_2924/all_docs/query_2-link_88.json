        "text": "Avex Group Logo PNG\n\nThe Avex Group logo is not just a means of self-identification for the Japanese holding. This is a symbol of continuous development because it seems mobile, flexible, and plastic due to the combination of different forms. This design shows that the company is ready for creative experiments because it works with musicians.\n\nAvex Group: Brand overview\n\nThe Japanese holding company Avex Group signs contracts with musical groups and solo performers. Its main task is to facilitate the creation and distribution of content. Primarily focused on J-pop songs, the company has recently expanded into other entertainment business areas, including video games and anime.\n\nMeaning and History\n\nAvex Group has a rich history that dates back to 1988. At that time, the newly created company was engaged in selling imported music records. And two years later, she herself began recording, opening HI-BPM Studio for this purpose. Then she got her label Avex Trax. The company began to cooperate with various artists, releasing albums and singles for them in the future.\n\nOver the years, the organization has changed the location of the main office in Tokyo several times. At the same time, she continued to expand: she founded a new recording studio, created a dance club, and opened an artist management division. One of the most important rebrandings was carried out in 1998 when the company was renamed from Avex D. D. (old name) to Avex Inc. This happened in honor of her tenth anniversary. In 2004, a new structure appeared as part of the conglomerate – Avex Group Holdings Inc.\n\nThe lowercase letter “a” is the main symbol of the Avex Group. The designers of the logo made it look not static but moving. They managed to achieve this thanks to the play of dark and light shades: it seems that the protruding parts are additionally illuminated, and the background goes into shadow. This visual effect occurs due to the gradient. Dynamics are very important for the Japanese holding because it is constantly developing – if not itself, then the artists.\n\nWhat is Avex Group?\n\nAvex Group Holdings, Incorporated is the collective name for the major subsidiaries owned by the entertainment conglomerate Avex Inc. The parent company was founded in 1988 and is based in Tokyo. She works in show business, helping international celebrities and talented newcomers from Japan build a musical career.\n\n1999 – 2017\n\n2017 – today\n\nAccording to the information on the official website of the Japanese holding, its modern logo was introduced in 2017. It contains a stylized letter “a,” which looks like a twisted three-dimensional chute. The geometric figure also resembles a broken Möbius strip. Its protruding part (the one closest to the viewer) is painted in light gray with a white gradient, while the distant parts, on the contrary, are shown in dark gray.\n\nDesigners used color transitions to give the letter volume and show its dynamism and plasticity. The main graphic symbol is placed in an oval turned diagonally. The base is unevenly blue: on the left, it is darker, and on the right, it is slightly lighter. But the gradient, in this case, is almost invisible.\n\nAnother integral element of the logo is the inscription “avex.” The designers have made all letters lowercase and thin, so this style is now an important part of branding. The structure of the glyphs is interesting: none of them have serifs, but the “v” and “x” have additional intermediate strokes. These are short horizontal lines located where they usually do not exist. The wordmark is directly below the blue oval.\n\nFont and Colors\n\nThe font used by the designers of the Avex Group logo has no analogs. It is similar to The Northern Block’s heavily modified Stolzl Display Thin but has a noticeably different shape for the lowercase “a” glyph. In addition, the company’s wordmark contains non-standard “v” and “x,” which have additional horizontal strokes at the intersection of the main (diagonal) lines.\n\nThe palette of the emblem is represented by a wide range of different shades of gray – from light to dark. Blue also has a gradient, but not as pronounced. But the verbal sign in terms of color is monotonous: it is just black.\n\nAvex Group color codes"
