        "text": "Dear Ms. Costner,\n\nThank you for posting your request on History Hub!\n\nThe information you provided indicates that he did not serve as part of a ship’s crew. If he was assigned to a ship, it should have been listed with his other assignments. Instead he served in three different construction battalions. Construction battalions are also known as Seabees, and did most of their work on land. While the seabees would have been transported to the islands where they worked by various ships, while being transported they were passengers rather than crew. World War II passenger lists for Naval, Merchant Marine, and Army transports were disposed of as temporary records.\n\nIf you have not already done so, you may request a copy of his Official Military Personnel File (OMPF). OMPFs and medical records of enlisted men of the U.S. Navy who were separated from the service after 1885 and prior to 1958 are located at NARA's National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), (Military Personnel Records), 1 Archives Drive, St. Louis, MO 63138-1002. To request these records, please mail a completed GSA Standard Form 180 to NPRC. Veterans and their next of kin also may use eVetRecs to request records. See eVetRecs Help for instructions. When submitting your request, state that you want the file for genealogical purposes and that you want the entire file. For more information see Official Military Personnel Files (OMPF), Archival Records Requests.\n\nAlso, we searched the National Archives Catalog and located 29 record series relating to construction battalions during the 1940s. Please review them and contact the National Archives at College Park - Textual Reference (RDT2) at Archives2reference@nara.gov about the ones that interest you.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and pursuant to guidance received from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), NARA has adjusted its normal operations to balance the need of completing its mission-critical work while also adhering to the recommended social distancing for the safety of NARA staff. As a result of this re-prioritization of activities, you may experience a delay in receiving an initial acknowledgement as well as a substantive response to your reference request from RDT2. Also, the National Personnel Records Center is servicing only urgent requests related to homeless veterans, medical emergencies, and funerals which may be faxed to 314-801-0764. We thank you for your patience and look forward to resuming normal operations when the public health emergency has ended.\n\nSee the Naval History and Heritage Command’s web page on Seabees and the website of the United States Navy Seabee Museum for information about the missions and history of the Seabees. Histories for specific Construction Battalions can be found at Seabee Unit Historical Information.\n\nWe hope this information is helpful. Best of luck with your family research!"
