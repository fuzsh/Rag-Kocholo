A normal record is active, i.e. it is in use. Active is set to 'false' when a record is created as a duplicate or in error. A record does not need to be linked to be inactivated.\n\nThe link element is used to assert that two or more Patient resources are both about the same actual patient. See below for further discussion\n\nThere should be only one preferred language (Language.preference = true) per mode of expression.\n\nThe Contact for a Patient has an element organization, this is for use with guardians or business related contacts where just the organization is relevant.\n\n8.1.5 Patient ids and Patient resource ids\n\nA Patient record's Resource Id can never change. For this reason, the identifiers with which humans are concerned (often called MRN - Medical Record Number, or UR - Unit Record) should not be used for the resource's id, since MRN's may change, i.e. as a result of having duplicate records of the same patient. Instead they should be represented in the Patient.identifier list where they can be managed. This is also useful for the case of institutions that have acquired multiple numbers because of mergers of patient record systems over time.\n\nWhere there is a need to implement an automated MRN Identifier created for a patient record, this could be achieved by providing an identifier in the patient with an appropriate assigner, MRN Type and/or system but with no value assigned. Internal business rules can then detect this and replace/populate this identifier with 1 or more identifiers (as required).\n\n8.1.6 Merging records Trial Use\n\nThere are two common approaches for resolving duplicate patient records: merging and linking. Linking duplicate patients is described in the Linking Patients section, or merging duplicate patients as described in the $merge operation page.\n\n8.1.7 Linking Patients\n\nThe link element is used to assert that patient resources refer to the same patient. This element is used to support the following scenarios where multiple patient records exist:\n\n8.1.7.1 Duplicate Patient records\n\nManaging Patient registration is a well-known difficult problem. Around 2% of registrations are in error, mostly duplicate records. Sometimes the duplicate record is caught fairly quickly and retired before much data is accumulated. In other cases, substantial amounts of data may accumulate.\n\nThere are two common approaches for resolving duplicate patient records: merging and linking. Merging duplicate patients is described in the $merge operation page.\n\nLinking duplicate records can be accomplished by using a link of type 'replaced-by' where the record containing such a link is marked as a duplicate and the link points forward to a record that should be used instead. Note that the record pointed to may in its turn have been identified as created in error and forward to yet another Patient resource. Records that replace another record may use a link type of 'replaces' pointing to the old record.\n\n8.1.7.2 Patient record in a Patient index\n\nA Patient record may be present in a system that acts as a Patient Index: it maintains a (summary of) patient data and a list of one or more servers that are known to hold a more comprehensive and/or authoritative record of the same patient. The link type 'refer' is used to denote such a link. Note that linked records may contain contradictory information. The record referred to does not point back to the referring record.\n\n8.1.7.3 Distributed Patient record\n\nIn a distributed architecture, multiple systems keep separate patient records concerning the same patient. These records are not considered duplicates, but contain a distributed, potentially overlapping view of the patient's data. Each such record may have its own focus or maintaining organization and there need not be a sense of one record being more complete or more authoritative than another. In such cases, links of type 'see also' can be used to point to other patient records. It is not a requirement that such links are bilateral.\n\n8.1.8 Patient vs. Person vs. Patient.Link vs. Linkage\n\nThe Person resource on the surface appears to be very similar to the Patient resource, and the usage for it is very similar to using the Patient.Link capability.\n\nThe intention of the Person resource is to be able to link instances of resources together that are believed to be the same individual. This includes across resource types, such as RelatedPerson, Practitioner, Patient and even other Person resources.\n\nThe primary use case for the Person resource is to be able to support person registries that do not necessarily have a healthcare context, and are able to identify and quantify confidence levels that this is the same person.\n\nThis could include consumer portals where the maintainer of the person information is the actual person themselves.\n\nA system could use the Person entry to cross check changes to information applied to one part of a record to values in another system; e.g., when moving, a consumer updates his contact numbers and address in his person record, and then a Patient Administration system is able to see that this data is changed and prompt the organization to follow up with the patient that was linked to the person record if they want their details updated, or if they no longer need services and they should be cancelled, as they've moved from the area.\n\nThe Linkage resource and the Patient.link property conceptually perform similar functions in FHIR, both provide an assertion of linkages between multiple resource instances that are referring to the same underlying individual.\n\nWhen a Patient resource is linked/merged then it needs to have an internal indication that there is another patient resource that should be considered when referencing other records, which is achieved using the patient.link property.\n\nNot detecting/checking for a potential linkage could mean that related clinical records are not discovered, potentially impacting patient safety. (which is why using the Linkage resource is not appropriate, as its use in this manner would force the use of either another query to potentially locate other patient resources to consider, or use _revinclude)\n\n8.1.9 Patient.contact vs. RelatedPerson\n\nThe contact element on the Patient resource should be used for storing the details of people to contact. This information always travels with the Patient resource, and cannot be used as the target of a reference. Where related people need to be referenced by other resources (e.g. CarePlan.participant, Encounter.participant, DocumentReference.author, Appointment.participant), the RelatedPerson resource must be used.\n\nIt is not expected that these records will be used for recording the primary care provider; this information should be stored in the Patient.generalPractitioner field.\n\n8.1.10 Patient Gender and Sex\n\nMany systems and organizations only provide for a single attribute that aspires to represent all aspects of a patient's gender and sex with a single value. However, there are many considerations around sex and gender documentation and interoperability. Listed below are various social and biological attributes that are relevant in the healthcare setting, as well as information on how each can be communicated. Each of these attributes may be useful to address different use cases, and it is up to the implementer to identify which attribute or combination of attributes are most appropriate.\n\nAdministrative Gender - in order to interoperate with systems that use a single generic property, the basic Patient.gender property represents an administrative gender: the gender that the patient is considered to have for administration and record keeping purposes. This property is often used as an input to patient matching algorithms. Systems should not infer any specific clinical meaning from Patient.gender without pre-coordination with exchange partners.\n\nGender Identity - a gender the patient has indicated they consider themselves to be. The gender identity can influence how the patient prefers to be addressed by care providers and other individuals. The standard genderIdentity extension may be used to communicate this property. When determining how to address the patient, the pronouns extension may also be applicable.\n\nSex Parameter for Clinical Use (SPCU) - a parameter that provides guidance on how a recipient should apply settings or reference ranges that are derived from observable information such as an organ inventory, recent hormone lab tests, genetic testing, menstrual status, obstetric history, etc.. This property is intended for use in clinical decision making, and indicates that treatment or diagnostic tests should consider best practices associated with the relevant reference population. The standard sexParameterForClinicalUse extension may be used to communicate this property.\n\nClinical Observations about sex characteristics - a testable observation about a biological property of the patient. This could include karyotypic sex, genetic sex, chromosomal sex, gonadal sex, ductal sex, hormone levels, or various other phenotypic attributes. Clinical observations about sex characteristics should be represented using Observation, qualified with the appropriate clinical codes from LOINC, SNOMED, or other relevant clinical terminologies. These observations may serve as supporting information for the Sex Parameters for Clinical Use categorization.\n\nRecorded Sex or Gender (RSG) - recorded sex or gender information includes the various sex and gender concepts that are often used in existing systems but are known NOT to represent a gender identity, sex parameter for clinical use, or attributes related to sexuality, such as sexual orientation, sexual activity, or sexual attraction. Examples of recorded sex or gender concepts include administrative gender, administrative sex, legal sex, and sex assigned at birth. When exchanging these concepts, refer to the guidance in the Gender Harmony Implementation Guide.\n\nLegal Sex - a sex value documented on a legal document, such as a passport, driver's license, birth certificate, or other document. Regional and national entities often categorize citizens using a single legal sex value. The legal sex of a patient can vary from region to region and country to country. A single patient may have multiple legal sex values at the same time in different jurisdictions, or even on different legal documents within a single jurisdiction. In cases where the Patient.gender administrative property is not sufficient to communicate legal sex, refer to the guidance in the Gender Harmony Implementation Guide .\n\nSex assigned at Birth - the sex assigned at birth is a sex or gender value assigned to a patient at birth. This value is often documented on the birth registration. Some jurisdictions allow variations such as not yet determined, unknown, or undifferentiated, while others do not. Some jurisdictions also allow birth registration information to be updated. The sex assigned at birth may often be a poor approximation of the patient's current sex for clinical use, especially for adult patients. See sexParameterForClinicalUse as a way to communicate a patient's current sex for clinical use. Refer to the guidance in the Gender Harmony Implementation Guide for options to exchange this concept.\n\nFor veterinary use, the animal extension also includes the genderStatus which indicates sterility information.\n\n8.1.11 Mother and newborn relationships\n\nThere are several ways to represent the relationship between a mother and a child. This variability is due to the timing when it is recorded and the purpose for which it is recorded:\n\nTo express the family relationship and legal responsibility thereof for administrative purposes: use the Patient/RelatedPerson structure.\n\nThis structure is consistent over time.\n\nTo relate the encounters of a mother and her baby in a maternity encounter, for administrative and billing purposes: use the encounter.partof property\n\nTo collect information about the patient's relatives that might be relevant to the patient's medical condition: use the FamilyMemberHistory resource\n\nDuring a maternity encounter, the Patient and Encounter resources for the mother will be present. After the child is born, new Patient, Encounter and RelatedPerson (for the mother) records will be created. The Child's encounter should reference the Mother's encounter using the partOf property.\n\nThe Patient/RelatedPerson structure should also be created for ongoing usage, as shown in this example:\n\n<Patient> <id value=\"child\"/> <!-- The details of the child --> </Patient> <RelatedPerson> <id value=\"rp-mom\"/> <patient> <reference value=\"Patient/child\"/> </patient> </RelatedPerson> <Patient> <id value=\"pat-mom\"/> <!-- The details of the mom --> <link> <other value=\"rp-mom\"/> <type value=\"see-also\"/> </link> </Patient> <Encounter> <id value=\"mom-enc\"/> <status value=\"in-progress\"/> <class value=\"inpatient\"/> <patient> <reference value=\"Patient/mom\"/> </patient> </Encounter> <Encounter> <id value=\"child-enc\"/> <status value=\"in-progress\"/> <class value=\"inpatient\"/> <patient> <reference value=\"Patient/child\"/> </patient> <partOf> <reference value=\"Encounter/mom-enc\"/> </partOf> </Encounter>\n\n8.1.12 Patient Matching using an MPI\n\nA Master Patient Index (MPI ) is a service used to manage patient identification in a context where multiple patient databases exist. Healthcare applications and middleware use the MPI to match patients between the databases, and as new patient details are encountered. MPIs are highly specialized applications, often tailored extensively to the institution's particular mix of patients. MPIs can also be run on a regional and national basis.\n\nTo ask an MPI to match a patient, clients call the patient $match operation, which processes a parameters resource containing a complete or fragment of a patient resource, along with some other control parameters.\n\nThis provided patient resource does not need to pass full validation (mandatory fields, or invariants) as the resource will not be stored, it does however need to be a parsable instance.\n\nThe MPI can then use the properties of the resource as MPI inputs, and process them using an internal MPI algorithm of some kind to determine the most appropriate matches in the patient set. It does not have to use all the properties provided, and may ignore others provided quietly.\n\nA specific profile (with the required fields/invariants) can be used to define what parameters the MPI algorithm requires.\n\nPOST [base]/Patient/$match [some headers including content-type xml or json] [parameters body with patient resource inside]\n\nThe response from an MPI $match operation is a set of patient records, ordered from most likely to least likely. If there are not patient matches, the MPI SHALL return an empty search set with no error, but may include an operation outcome with further advice. All patient records should have a score from 0 to 1, where 1 is the most certain match, along with an extension \"match-grade\" that indicates the MPI's position on the match quality:\n\n<entry> <resource> <Patient> <!-- patient details --> </Patient> </resource> <search> <extension url=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/match-grade\"> <valueCode value=\"probable\"/> </extension> <score value=\"0.80\"/> </search> </entry>\n\nThe match-grade extension has one of the following codes:\n\ncertain This record meets the matching criteria to be automatically considered as a full match. probable This record is a close match, but not a certain match. Additional review (e.g. by a human) may be required before using this as a match. possible This record may be a matching one. Additional review (e.g. by a human) SHOULD be performed before using this as a match. certainly-not This record is known not to be a match. Note that usually non-matching records are not returned, but in some cases records previously or likely considered as a match may specifically be negated by the matching engine.\n\nThe purpose of using an MPI search versus a regular search is that the MPI search is really intended to target and find a specific single patient for recording information about reducing errors through incorrectly selecting the wrong patient. Often MPIs won't return data if there is insufficient search parameter data, such as a partial surname.\n\nThis compares to a regular search which can be used for finding lists of patients, such as to locate a group of patients that share a property in common, such as live in a specific location, or fit within an age range for performing population analysis.\n\nA formal definition for the MPI $match operation is published.\n\n8.1.13 Veterinary Care\n\nVeterinary care is very much within the scope of FHIR, and the Patient resource can be used to communicate information about animal patients. To support this, there is a standard patient-animal extension which can be used for recording details about species, breed, and gender status. This extension is not intended to cover all relevant properties for veterinary care, and the use of additional domain-relevant extensions is expected for areas such as laboratory, zoological and livestock care.\n\nThe veterinary client (\"owner\") is represented using the RelatedPerson resource.\n\n8.1.14 Search Parameters\n\nSearch parameters for this resource. See also the full list of search parameters for this resource, and check the Extensions registry for search parameters on extensions related to this resource. The common parameters also apply. See Searching for more information about searching in REST, messaging, and services."
