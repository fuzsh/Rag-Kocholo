        "text": "m.o.v.e (formerly known as move) was a Japanese pop group on the avex trax label from 1997 to 2013.\n\nMembers\n\nyuri: Vocalist\n\nmotsu: Rapper, Lyricist, Vocalist\n\nFormer Members\n\nt-kimura: Producer, Composer (1997-2009)\n\nASAKI: Guitart\n\nCharlie K: Keyboards\n\nInformation\n\nLongtime friends motsu and t-kimura had always wanted to work with each other. But, because of conflicting record contracts, did not get the opportunity to do so until 1997. yuri was spotted on a televised audition of the program ASAYAN, and was chosen by t-kimura who believed that her voice would suit his type of music very well. They made their debut as a group in October of that year with the single \"ROCK IT DOWN.\"\n\nThe name \"move\" was chosen with the idea that the group would not stick to one form of music, and would always be in pursuit of new styles. Staying true to this intention, m.o.v.e's songs cover and mix styles like Eurobeat, rock, techno, trance, J-Pop, Latin, and more recently electronica. The wide variation of styles has led to a divided fanbase in terms of favored sound, although there are fans who like the numerous sounds m.o.v.e has taken on.\n\nIn 2005, m.o.v.e was selected as the first Asian participant in the contest, in which people would remix an English version of \"FREAKY PLANET\". In addition to this, m.o.v.e began to release songs over the American iTunes store, usually English version of certain songs and remixes featured on previous albums. It is also during this time period that the formatting was changed from move to m.o.v.e, due to issues with registering trademarkes for the former formatting in the States. As an acronym, the name has no known meaning and is still pronounced as the English word \"move.\"\n\nMost English-speaking fans know them best for providing several themes for the anime series Initial D.\n\nIn 2009, t-kimura announced that he was stepping down from being a member of the group. However, he continued being their main producer.\n\nm.o.v.e disbanded after their last live, entitled \"Champagne FIGHT\", at Akasaka BLITZ on March 16, 2013. People who wished to see the final live had to enter a lottery by buying the album Best moves. ~and move goes on~' and entering a special code online. Over 1,500 people attended the live and the group performed twenty-seven various songs.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\n[1998.06.24] electrock\n\n[2000.01.19] worlds of the mind\n\n[2001.02.15] Operation Overload 7\n\n[2002.02.27] SYNERGY\n\n[2004.01.28] Deep Calm\n\n[2005.01.26] BOULDER\n\n[2006.01.25] GRID\n\n[2009.01.21] Humanizer\n\n[2010.03.03] Dream Again\n\n[2011.05.25] oveRtaKerS SPIRIT\n\n[2012.03.07] XII\n\nMini-Albums\n\n[2003.09.10] DECADANCE\n\nBest Albums\n\n[2002.12.04] move super tune -BEST SELECTIONS-\n\n[2004.03.24] REWIND ~singles collection~\n\n[2007.10.03] m.o.v.e 10th Anniversary MEGA BEST\n\n[2012.02.08] m.o.v.e B-SIDE BEST\n\n[2012.02.22] anim.o.v.e BEST\n\n[2013.02.27] Best moves. ~and move goes on~\n\nRemix Albums\n\n[2000.03.23] remixers play move\n\n[2000.11.29] SUPER EUROBEAT presents EURO movement\n\n[2001.05.30] HYPER TECHNO MIX REVOLUTION I\n\n[2001.07.25] HYPER TECHNO MIX REVOLUTION II\n\n[2001.10.11] HYPER TECHNO MIX REVOLUTION III\n\n[2002.08.28] Tropican Trops\n\n[2004.05.26] FAST FORWARD ~FUTURE BREAKBEATNIX~\n\nOther Albums\n\n[2008.03.19] m.o.v.e 10 YEARS ANNIVERSARY MEGALOPOLIS TOUR 2008 LIVE CD at SHIBUYA CLUB QUATTRO (Live Album)\n\n[2009.08.19] anim.o.v.e 01 (Anime Cover Album)\n\n[2010.08.25] anim.o.v.e 02 (Anime Cover Album)\n\n[2011.09.07] anim.o.v.e 03 (Anime Cover Album)\n\nSingles\n\n[1997.10.01] ROCK IT DOWN\n\n[1998.01.07] around the world\n\n[1998.03.18] over drive\n\n[1998.05.13] Rage your dream\n\n[1998.11.11] BREAK IN2 THE NITE\n\n[1999.06.30] platinum\n\n[1999.10.27] Blazin' Beat\n\n[2000.01.19] words of the mind -brandnew journey-\n\n[2000.07.19] sweet vibration\n\n[2001.01.11] Gamble Rumble\n\n[2001.06.13] SUPER SONIC DANCE\n\n[2001.08.08] FLY ME SO HIGH\n\n[2001.12.19] come together\n\n[2002.02.06] Romancing Train\n\n[2002.06.26] FUTURE BREEZE\n\n[2002.11.20] ¡WAKE YOUR LOVE!\n\n[2003.06.25] BURNING DANCE\n\n[2003.09.03] Painless PAIN\n\n[2004.01.07] Blast My Desire\n\n[2004.05.26] DOGFIGHT\n\n[2004.08.04] GHETTO BLASTER\n\n[2005.01.13] How To See You Again / Noizy Tribe\n\n[2005.09.28] FREAKY PLANET\n\n[2005.10.26] DISCO TIME\n\n[2005.11.23] Raimei -out of kontrol- (雷鳴 -out of kontrol-)\n\n[2005.12.14] ANGEL EYES\n\n[2007.06.20] SYSTEMATIC FANTASY / Good Day Good Time\n\n[2007.08.22] SPEED MASTER (m.o.v.e feat. 8-BALL)\n\n[2008.07.02] DIVE INTO STREAM\n\n[2010.01.13] Fate Seeker\n\n[2011.03.09] oveRtaKerS (m.o.v.e feat.
