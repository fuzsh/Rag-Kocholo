        "text": "California Highway Patrol (CHP) Fees (VC §§9250.8, 9250.13, 9552–9554)\n\nInformation Request Fees (VC §1811)\n\nMoped Fees (VC §5036)\n\nMiscellaneous Registration and Service Fees\n\nOff-Highway Vehicles (OHV) Fees (VC §§38225-38225.5, 38230, 38246, 38250, 38255, 38260, 38265)\n\nThese fees are due every two years to fund the California Department of Parks and Recreation Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation Division, OHV Trust Fund, and DMV administrative costs.\n\nPenalties\n\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) does not offer a grace period for paying your annual vehicle registration fees. Be sure to pay your renewal fees on or before the expiration date shown on your current registration card, or DMV will charge penalties. Even though your license plates display only the month and year, your registration expires on a specific day. Be sure to check the registration card for the actual expiration date.\n\nIf you do not receive a billing notice approximately 60 days before your vehicle’s registration expires, please call us at 1-800-777-0133 to find out what your fees are.\n\nThe longer you delay payment, the greater the penalty amount will be. Penalty fees are assessed in addition to any other fees due.\n\nPenalties for Vehicles Registered in California\n\nPenalties are determined by adding a percentage of the vehicle license fee, plus a registration late fee, plus a California Highway Patrol (CHP) late fee.\n\n* A Planned Nonoperation (PNO) may be filed up to 90 days after the registration expiration date if the vehicle was not operated in any manner, but applicable late penalties are due.\n\nPenalties for New Vehicles or Vehicles Never Registered in California\n\nHere are the penalties for new vehicles or vehicles that have never been registered in California.\n\nPermanent Trailer Identification (PTI) Fees\n\nPermit Fees\n\nRegistration Fees (VC §9250.1)\n\n* Includes the Alternative Fuel/Technology Fee ($3)\n\nRoad Improvement Fee (RIF) (VC §9250.6)\n\nThe RIF is assessed on all model year 2020 and later zero emission vehicles (ZEV). RIF fees affect vehicle registration renewals unless exempted.\n\nRIF is not assessed on the initial registration of a newly purchased ZEV from a licensed vehicle dealer.\n\nTransportation Improvement Fee (TIF)\n\nTIF fees are used to repair roads, bridges, etc. and provide road maintenance. TIF fees affect original vehicle registration (VR), transfers, and renewals.\n\nVehicle License Fee (VLF) – 0.65% of purchase price/value of vehicle\n\nFor most vehicles, you will need to pay a vehicle license fee instead of the fee being included in your property tax. You can deduct this fee from your income tax. Vehicle license fees are based on the purchase price or value of your vehicle and the fees go to fund cities/counties.\n\nVehicle license fees decrease for your vehicle’s first 11 renewal years, or until the vehicle is transferred (whichever happens first).\n\nThe following groups do not have to pay a vehicle license fee:\n\nDisabled veterans with a 100% service-related disability rating.\n\nNon-resident military personnel stationed in California (and their non-resident spouses).\n\nCalifornia Native American tribes and tribal members.\n\nFederally-recognized Native American tribes.\n\nSpecialized transportation vehicles.\n\nHistorical vehicles/horseless carriage.\n\nThe VLF for historical vehicles or horseless carriages is $2. (VC §5004)\n\nVessel Fees (VC §§9851, 9852.7, 9853, 9853.5, 9855, 9860–9863, HNC §675)\n\n*Includes fees for original vessel, renewal, alternative fuel/technology, and Quagga Mussels, if applicable.\n\nThe following are exempt from the Quagga Mussel fee:\n\nVessels used only in marine waters.\n\nAnnual exempt youth group (type license [TL] V6).\n\nAnnual exempt government (TL V7).\n\nCF numbers issued to dealers (TL V3).\n\nCF numbers issued to manufacturers (TL V4).\n\nThe Quagga Fee is collected separately from registration fees. Quagga stickers can be purchased online.\n\nSpecial License Plate Fees\n\nYou can purchase special interest license plates to use on your California registered vehicles. You might have to pay a yearly renewal fee on special interest plates, which you can pay when you renew your registration.\n\nSpecial license plate fees help fund environmental and special programs.\n\nDisabled Person/Veteran (DP/DV) Placard Fees\n\nDP Parking Placards\n\nPermanent DP Parking Placards: Free\n\nTemporary: $6\n\nTemporary placards are issued to permanent placard owners for free.\n\nDV Parking Placards\n\nDV parking placards: Free\n\nReplacement: $20\n\nWindow decals for vehicles with a wheelchair lift or carrier are free."
