        "text": "Available for download and streaming for the first time is Ayumi Hamasaki’s trance remixes by prominent DJs including Moogwai, Ferry Corsten, Armin van Buuren, and Above & Beyond.\n\nShout out to all trance fans out there. The classic Cyber TRANCE series featuring Japanese popular artists Ayumi Hamasaki is back. In September, Cyber TRANCE released the complete edition of ayu trance. And two months after followed up with ‘ayu trance 2’ which is also the complete edition of the tracks from the 2002 release. It even included additional versions, which are available for the very first time.\n\nThe thirty tracks on ayu trance 2, the complete edition, included extended remixes, which were produced by Ferry Corsten as an original Ayumi Hamasaki song. The song ‘Connected’ hit the club charts in countries across Europe when it was released in 2002 and was featured in countless DJ sets and DJ-Mix compilations.\n\nSince ‘Cyber TRANCE presents ayu trance 2’ was originally released on CD as a non-stop mix, the various tracks have never been made available individually for download or streaming.\n\nFollowing the reissue of the first ‘Cyber TRANCE presents ayu trance -COMPLETE EDITION-’ album, the official Twitter account of Japanese dance music brand Cyber TRANCE posted a photo taken way back in 2001. At the time when British trance group Above & Beyond were performing at an ‘ayu trance’ release party at renowned Tokyo mega-club Velfarre, Avex-owned disco club. The photo captures the moment the three young artists were joined on stage by Hamasaki herself, making a surprise guest appearance. This rare memento of a special moment in Japanese and British trance music history reignited the excitement of fans around the world.\n\nAyumi Hamasaki is signed to label Avex in 1998 and debuted her first single Poker Face with the same label. On the twentieth anniversary of her music career in 2019, she released Loveppears. Her national tour in 2020 was halted in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and saw thirty-six concert dates cancelled.\n\nToday, Hamasaki is one of Japan and Avex’s legendary artists.\n\n‘Cyber TRANCE presents ayu trance 2 -COMPLETE EDITION-’\n\nDownload and streaming links here.\n\n‘Cyber TRANCE presents ayu trance -COMPLETE EDITION-’\n\nDownload and streaming links here.\n\nDisc 1\n\nDepend on you (Svenson & Gielen remix)\n\nDepend on you (Svenson & Gielen Club mix)\n\nDepend on you (Svenson & Gielen Club mix Instrumental)\n\nDepend on you (Svenson & Gielen Dub mix)\n\nM (Above & Beyond remix)\n\nM (Above & Beyond Vocal mix)\n\nM (Above & Beyond Vocal Dub)\n\nM (Above & Beyond Typhoon Dub mix)\n\nTrauma (JamX & De Leon’s DuMonde remix)\n\nTrauma (JamX & De Leon’s DuMonde Vocal mix)\n\nTrauma (JamX & De Leon’s DuMonde Dub mix)\n\nUNITE!
