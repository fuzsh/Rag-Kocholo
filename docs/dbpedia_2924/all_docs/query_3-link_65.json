        "text": "A new V6 engine range was introduced: the VQ series. Designed for optimal power, torque and fuel consumption, the thrilling VQ ranked as one of Ward’s 10 Best Engines for the next 14 years – an unrivalled achievement. This was the predecessor of the INFINITI Twin Turbo V6.\n\nThis full-size luxury sport utility vehicle was first known as the QX56 when it launched in 2004. It was rebranded as the INFINITI QX80 in 2013. Today’s version is our most luxurious SUV ever, with seating for up to 8 people, striking looks and elegant design details.\n\nOur advanced compact SUV, began life as the INFINITI EX in 2007. It became the QX50 in 2013 and has continued to evolve every year since. Take a look at the latest QX50, which offers a travel experience to remember.\n\nINFINITI Q50 had its debut at the 2013 North American International Auto Show. This head-turning sport sedan has since gone from strength to strength. The Latest INFINITI Q50 boasts track-bred features such as aluminum alloys and other premium touches.\n\nIn 1991, INFINITI released the G Coupe, a compact executive car and predecessor to today’s Q60. The concept version was unveiled at the 2015 North American International Auto Show and the production model was unveiled in 2016. Today’s INFINITI Q60 is still every inch the ultimate driver’s car.\n\nIn 2021, INFINITI introduced the QX55, a coupé SUV version of the QX50 with a modern, sloped roof design. The latest INFINITI QX55 boasts performance-inspired styling and a bold, powerful stance that makes a statement wherever you go.\n\nThe INFINITI QX60 was first introduced to the market in 2012. Before that, it was known as the INFINITI JX. In 2022 we caused quite a stir by introducing a completely re-designed QX60. It’s our most versatile SUV ever, with three rows of seats, stand-out looks and a sumptuous cabin."
