See here.\n\nNo trial is available for the Professional plan and the Cloud Option.\n\nYou can use rekordbox ver. 5 on the same computer even after installing ver. 6.\n\nHowever, you can't run ver. 5 and ver. 6 at the same time.\n\nThe following restrictions also apply.\n\nTo use selected functions in ver. 5, you'll need the relevant license.\n\nPlease note: If you already have a ver. 5 license (purchased or bundled), you can continue to use ver. 5. As of April 2020, it will no longer be possible to purchase a new ver. 5 license key.\n\nTo use selected functions in ver. 6, you'll need to take out the relevant subscription plan. When you run rekordbox ver. 6 for the first time and convert your library from the old version, all information such as cues, beatgrid, and playlists will be copied over. After this, the libraries of ver. 5 and ver. 6 do not sync. So, from then on, imported tracks and information such as cue points in one version won't be reflected in the other version.\n\nWhen you connect a Hardware Unlock device, you can use it to control PERFORMANCE mode without subscribing to a paid plan.\n\nThe following devices are Hardware Unlock devices for rekordbox ver. 6:\n\nPERFORMANCE mode control, Recording, Sharing mix, MIDI LEARN, MERGE FX*1, SAMPLE SCRATCH\n\nCDJ-3000\n\nPLX-CRSS12\n\nDJM-V10/V10-LF\n\nDJM-A9\n\nDJM-750MK2/450/250MK2\n\nDJM-S11/S7\n\neuphonia\n\nDDJ-1000/800/400/200\n\nDDJ-FLX10/FLX6-GT/FLX6/FLX4\n\nDDJ-REV5/REV7\n\nDDJ-RZX/RZ/RX/RR/RB/WeGO4\n\nDDJ-XP1/XP2\n\nOPUS-QUAD\n\nOMNIS-DUO\n\nXDJ-XZ/RX3/RX2/RX/RR\n\nINTERFACE 2\n\nRB-DMX1\n\nDVS\n\nPLX-CRSS12\n\nDJM-V10/V10-LF\n\nDJM-A9\n\nDJM-750MK2/450/250MK2\n\nDJM-S11/S7\n\neuphonia\n\nDDJ-RZX/RZ\n\nDDJ-XP1/XP2\n\nINTERFACE 2\n\nMIX POINT LINK\n\nDDJ-FLX10\n\nVideo\n\nDDJ-RZX\n\nSampler Sequence Saving\n\nDDJ-RZX/RZ/RX/RR\n\nDJM EFFECTS(PING PONG, HELIX, VINYL BRAKE)\n\nXDJ-RX3\n\nDJM EFFECTS(STRETCH)\n\nDDJ-FLX10\n\n*1 The external mixer mode is not supported.\n\n(List correct as of Mar. 2024)\n\nWe've renewed the rekordbox subscription structure and the ver. 5 plans won't work with ver. 6.\n\nCheck the features and prices for each plan and choose a plan for ver. 6.\n\nIf you no longer need your ver. 5 subscription plan, cancel it.

This excludes inquiries about license activation.\n\nNote: The version of rekordbox\n\nThe version of rekordbox is described using three numbers shown as below. The numbers that make up a version are referred to as follows:\n\nExample: ver. 6.5.3\n\n6: major version\n\n5: minor version\n\n3: patch level\n\nIn principle, we do not update the previous versions of rekordbox.\n\nUse the new version if you're using rekordbox with a new OS or new hardware.\n\nYou can continue to use the previous version after the update, but over time customer support will be limited for previous versions.\n\nYou can continue your subscription with previous versions, but you may not be able to continue due to plan updates.\n\nNote: The version of rekordbox\n\nThe version of rekordbox is described using three numbers shown as below. The numbers that make up a version are referred to as follows:\n\nExample: ver. 6.5.3\n\n6: major version\n\n5: minor version\n\n3: patch level\n\nWith this setting, rekordbox users' analyzed track data is stored on the server and reused when the same track is being re-analyzed.\n\nIf analyzed track data already exists on the server, users can expect tracks to be analyzed even quicker than before because the server data is downloaded when a track is analyzed.\n\nTo use this setting, go to [Preferences] ＞ [Analysis] ＞ [Track Analysis] and turn [Automatically retrieve analysis information from the Internet (Beta)] ON.\n\n*This feature can be used for free on the Beta version, but it is being considered to become a paid plan feature in the future (timing TBD). Personally identifiable information is not collected with this feature.\n\nFrom version 6.5.2, the range of keys to highlighted can be set in [Preferences] > [View] > [Traffic Light].\n\nSelect [Related key 2] to set the same setting as the key range of version 6.5.1 or earlier. The initial value is [Related key 3].\n\nPerform settings in [Preferences] > [View] > [Traffic Light].\n\nThe range of keys can be selected from Same key and Related key 1 - 3.\n\nFor example, if the KEY of the loaded track is 2A(Alphanumeric), tracks with the following keys in the library are highlighted.\n\nSame key: 2A\n\nRelated key 1: 2A/2B\n\nRelated key 2: 2A/2B/1A/3A\n\nRelated key 3: 2A/2B/1A/3A/1B/3B\n\nIn rekordbox ver. 6, you can choose the new style of waveform [3Band]. However, tracks analyzed by the older version of rekordbox don't have the 3Band data, so the [?] icon appears.\n\nTracks with the [?] icon can't show the 3Band waveform even if you select [3Band] in [Preferences] > [Display] > [Waveform] > [Colors].\n\nIf you export one of these tracks, you won't be able to view the 3Band waveform in [WAVEFORM COLOR] on the CDJ-3000, even if you select [3Band].\n\nTo fix the problem, right-click the track and select [Add New Analysis Data] from the context menu.\n\nIf you've changed the location where you saved a track, the message [File is Missing] is displayed, and you may not be able to play or export the track. (The status column is marked with [!].)\n\nIn this case, you can [Auto Relocate] or [Relocate] the track.\n\n[Auto Relocate] searches and relocates files in the folder specified by you in the [Preferences] > [Advanced] > [Database] > [Auto Relocate Search Folders].\n\n[Relocate] enables you to manually specify the location of the file and relocate it.\n\nFollow the instructions in either of the following two ways:\n\nFrom the application menu\n\nSelect [Display All Missing Files] from the [File] menu.\n\nIn the [Missing File Manager] window, click the [Auto Relocate] or [Relocate] button.\n\nFrom the context menu\n\nAfter selecting the track with [!], right-click to show the context menu and select [Auto Relocate] or [Relocate].\n\nrekordbox ver. 6 doesn't have Plus Packs (additional features).\n\nAdditional features provided by ver. 5 Plus Packs are included in ver. 6 paid subscription plans.\n\nCore plan\n\nDVS function\n\nCreative plan\n\nDVS function, Video function, RMX EFFECTS, and Lyric function\n\nSee details of the features included in each plan here.\n\nYou can switch between accounts on My Page in rekordbox.\n\nClick [MY PAGE] and select [Switch Account] from the pull-down menu of email addresses in the top right corner of the screen.\n\nOn a Mac, the install folder for ver. 6 has been renamed from [rekordbox 5] to [rekordbox 6].\n\nUse Finder to select [Applications], click the [rekordbox 6] folder, then double-click rekordbox.app to start ver. 6.\n\nMake sure the icon for ver. 6 is the one on the Dock if you want to start it from there.\n\nThere are 2 types of My Page.\n\nMy Page on the website: rekordbox.com\n\nMy Page in the application: rekordbox ver. 6 (or later)\n\nMy Page on the website:\n\nAfter logging into the website, click your name in the top right corner to open My Page.
