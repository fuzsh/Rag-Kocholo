        "meta_description": "Hi! I’m a signed songwriter / producer / mixer / engineer with international major-label credits, including a track featured on a UK/Europe No.1 single.\r\n\r\nI’ve written, produced and mixed across a wide range of genres, but specialize in commercial pop / Top 40. I've also recently recorded and mixed the audio for a mental health charity promo video starring Hollywood actor Michael Sheen (see showreel, track 6).\r\n\r\nI’ve worked as a writer / producer / mixer with some of the biggest names in the industry including Electric (Little Mix etc.), Future Cut (Little Mix / Lily Allen / Shakira etc.), Rob Davis (Kylie, Cathy Dennis etc.), Tiesto, Bloodshy (Britney etc.), Boys Noize (Skrillex etc.) Cutfather (Little Mix, Kylie, Boyzone, Olly Murs etc.), Jonas Jeberg (Demi Levato, Selena Gomez etc.), Fridolin (P. Diddy etc.), Troy ‘Radio’ Johnson (Chris Bown etc.), Matt Rowe (Spice Girls ‘Wannabe’ etc.), JLS and countless others.\r\n\r\nMy mixes focus on vibe and energy above all else. I’ll let the music speak for itself - check out my audio examples. If you like what you hear drop me a line to discuss how we can bring the best out of your track!\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you and bringing your songs to life!\r\n\r\n[A selection of my 5* reviews from clients below]:\r\n\r\n*****\r\nStace did a great job with the mix and master and at a great price. I've used others who charged three times as much and their mix wasn't any better than mine. I'm grateful to have found Stace.\r\n\r\n*****\r\nAll I can say is WOW! You made my song sound so nice and took it to the next level. All your suggestions are on point!\r\n\r\n*****\r\nStace is the man! He exceeded my expectations and he's very professional. The quality of his mix is awesome. I will definitely work on more projects with him if the future. Keep up the good work!\r\n\r\n*****\r\n6 stars/5 stars! Stace exceeded my expectations for this single song project. I wanted something really particular with a specific type of reverb and he did exactly what I wanted, and more. The song came out really beautiful. He has great control over dynamics, Eq, and understood all my requests. I will definitely work with him again in the future.\r\n\r\n*****\r\nStace delivered an outstanding mix of my Track. Not only is he very professional and delivers on time as he promises; he is patient and pleasant to work with. He will go that extra mile for you. Stace is definitely worth more than the 5 stars. I will definitely use him again. Thanks Stace for a job well done.",
