        "text": "Credits Include Jason Derulo, Sexxy Red, Ludmilla, Lay Banks & More\n\nToday, Avex USA announces the signing of Los Angeles based Nigerian record producer, Zone, to its publishing division. Zone's production has been featured on an array of tracks from some of the biggest artists in the world right now, including Jason Derulo, Sexxy Red, Ludmilla, Lay Bankz, and more.\n\nZone's (n√©e Tyson Kong) wide range of expertise includes producing across hip-hop, dancehall, R&B, and pop, leading him to become one of the most in-demand producers in the industry. Zone's most exciting work is still on the horizon, with several upcoming productions soon to be released with Quavo, Lil Baby, DJ Snake, Sean Paul, Aluna, NLE Choppa, and Lil Wayne.\n\n\"I'm excited to build and develop my art of production with AVEX\", Zone remarked on the signing. \"With their dedicated support and my creative abilities, we'll craft the ideal formula for success\", he added.\n\nThe rising 23-year-old producer found his passion for music at a young age, growing up on African hymns and rhythms he learned at his local church. His time spent at the Boys and Girl Club in his hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts, led to him meeting Brian Soko, the Grammy-award winning producer of Beyonce's \"Drunk In Love.\" Recognizing talent in the young artist, Soko inspired him to pursue a career down his path to a career in music production. Heavily inspired by 21 Savage and Metro Boomin's Savage Mode, Zone took his talents to an internship at the Los Angeles studio In The Mix, where he learned how to engineer at a professional level.\n\nBrennen Bryant, Avex USA's Director of A&R, Publishing, expressed \"The first time I heard Zone's beats I immediately recognized his incredible talent, and knew that we had to work together. I'm very excited to be a part of his journey and witness his growth as a young producer into the hitmaker I know he can be.\"\n\nAVEX USAPublishing represents writers including J. Que(Joji / \"Die For You\"), Will Jay (Royal & the Serpent / \"overwhelmed\"), Xansei(XG / \"SHOOTING STAR\") and, through its joint venture with Brandon Silverstein Publishing, Justin Bieber's close collaborator and Grammy-nominated producer HARV, hitmaker Jasper Harris, Jamaica's global star Shenseea, The Kid LAROI's collaborator Cxdy from \"Internet Money,\" Bella Poarch's \"Build A Bitch\" co-writer David Arkwright, Curtis Waters' \"Stunnin\" producer Declan Hoy, and KOSA (the songwriter & producer behind massive hits with RVSSIAN, Lil Baby, Future, Bad Bunny, Travis Scott and more)."
