        "text": "Not too many people know about BeForU, and those who do, most likely recognize the group from their contributions to the rhythm and dance game, Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), Guitar Freaks, and/or Drummania. I was introduced to them through DDR and enjoyed them ever since 2007.\n\nI was really, really shocked that BeForU changed labels and signed on to Avex Trax in 2007. Or rather, they were signed onto a sub-label of Avex Trax, Gambit Records.\n\nIf you are a BeForU fan, you should realize that the only original member left in this, I’ll just say 3rd wave, is Riyu Kosaka, dating back to 2003. An interesting thing is that she wrote the lyrics for half the album! (Though, I don’t really mention about lyrics unless I have a translation available).\n\nThis album was released on October 8, 2008.\n\nOh and by the way, BeForU disbanded in 2009 apparently.\n\nAnyway, let’s get on with the review.\n\n1) Kimi to Sora to Zutto [PERFORMED LIVE HERE]\n\nThe album starts off with an energetic track. This is one of the fastest tracks in the album. It does have an electric sound to it due to all of the electric guitars and synthesizers used. Each of the members gets few lines, but a good chunk of the song has harmony (as in more than one person is singing at a time). All of the members have strong voices here and they sound very harmonious singing as a group. I dunno, when they sing “Zutto, Zutto!” I kinda feel empowered and it’s like I’m blasting off into the air. Kimi to Sora to Zutto sounds like it could be a theme of some sort, and if you dance along to it, I’m sure you’ll burn a lot of calories. Honestly, I wish this song could be part of the DDR series, but since this album is on an Avex Trax sub-label, I doubt it’s possible.\n\n2) Ijiwaru na Ai\n\nIt starts off with some bells and electric guitar which made me think it would be a rock song. Soon it breaks out into a slower pop track in which the electric guitar is pretty much thrown into the background. It makes me think of 1990’s early 2000’s J-Pop. In my opinion, the girls’ voices kind of clash in a smooth type of tension, if that makes sense. The kick, which is obvious if you listen to the song, can get annoying. You do get a break from it, but then the kick comes back, annoying as ever. The melody sounds bubbly and even the verse’s melody is memorable to me. Then the bridge has a melody that isn’t so memorable. It happens. Overall, this song is decent, but not as amazing as the previous track.\n\n3) Originality\n\nIt is pop from the get go. It has a bouncy feeling to it. I hear a lot more drums in it, which is nice because the kick in the previous song made me a bit angry. There is also a catchy bass line, which helps add to the bounce to it and the bass line is also heard very easily. Besides that, to me, there is nothing original to this song. [In fact, it reminds me of a song I heard in a video game but I’ll spare you from my rant about it]. It just seems like over-the-top bubblegum pop. I personally find it annoying, even before the girls sing.\n\nCommon in BeForU albums, there are always songs that only one member sings. Tracks 4 – 7 are sung by individual members. So we get to hear all of them, with their strongest and weakest traits.\n\n4) Sa.yo.na.ra. (sung by Hiromi Nishiuchi)\n\nHiromi Nishiuchi has a strong voice, and she sings in a confidence which is very good. It is a pop-dance type of song. Her vocals in this song are decent, but nothing to really write home about. As peppy as Nishiuchi sounds in this song, the title makes it seem like a bittersweet kind of peppiness. This is only my interpretation without a lyric translation but it’s as if Nishiuchi is hiding tears behind a smile. Or perhaps is thinking about good times as she says “goodbye”. The last line, “ima made arigatou” can be translated to “Until now—Thank you”. I really do enjoy this song BUT, it doesn’t get stuck in my head like other songs that I like. It reminds me of a 1970’s American B movie, for some strange reason. It’s a fitting song for her.\n\n5) Yakou Chou (sung by Megumi Fukushita)\n\nAhh. Where to start? I do like the sound of the song. There is an acoustic guitar prevalent. It has an R&B sound to it (and that damn kick is back). The arrangement includes guitar, bass, drums, and some maracas (I may be wrong), so it seems really stripped down as it has no synths unlike the other songs. As for Fukushita-san’s vocals… ehh… In the verses she sounds comfortable and has a sweet voice but when she gets to the chorus, that all changes. She sounds as if she is struggling to reach the notes (in a good or bad way… your choice). Although depending on the message the lyrics are trying to convey, her vocals may intensify the feelings behind the meaning. From a listening only sound-point, if I were to be extremely critical, I would not have given this song to Fukushita. Actually, this song sounds a bit out of place on this album. Surprisingly, this is a song that tends to get stuck in my head.\n\n6) Itte kureta I love You (sung by Ayano Tachibana)\n\nIf the previous song sounds out of place, this one definitely does too. The acoustic guitar makes a consecutive return in this track. The musical style of this song is like a folk-pop song. Cheery and by the title, I assume it is some kind of love song (especially with Tachibana-san singing in English the phrases “I love you” and “I need you”). She has a really soothing voice and this style of music fits her voice well. This song’s arrangement doesn’t get stuck in my head (as it seems like the generic folksy jpop song). But I will say that the chorus melody is nice and simple sounding, which isn’t a bad thing. I don’t listen to it often so that’s most likey why I don’t remember the melody for anything but the beginning of the chorus. Nice but not memorable. That’s the point I want to make.\n\n7) Perfect Warriors (Sung by Riyu Kosaka) [LINK TO SONG , I had to. It’s just too good to not to let you guys listen to it!]\n\nNow we’re back to fast pace, electronic based dance-pop, sung by the lovely Riyu Kosaka. She has the strongest vocals, which may sound obvious since she’s sung for the group for the longest (she’s had time to find her voice). This too, sounds like it should be in DDR/the other games they’ve provided music for, but I’m not keeping my hopes up. It has an intense sounding arrangement, as you can hear strong , in-your-face electric guitars, strings and drums. It invokes a similar feeling that Kimi to Sora to Zutto created in the beginning of the album. Riyu Kosaka’s vocals sound aggressive, but to me, it makes the song sound so much better.\n\nNow we return to the members of BeForU singing as a group.\n\n8) Shangri-La (Denki Mode cover) [PV LINK. I personally dislike it]\n\nI’ve listened to Denki Mode’s original song (which this song is the cover of). In my honest opinion, this cover by BeForU is WEAK. Then again, I dislike the original version. (The only version of this song I like is the one covered by Saori @ Destiny but that’s a different story). I like the arrangement of the song, with its 8-bit sounds—a throwback to the past! — But it does seem like an older song instead of something remade (the original song is from 1997, only a 9 year difference between then and this version). I kind of wish that the song was a faster pace so it would end sooner. And I do wish that it sung by one person. Unfortunately, as the title track for the album it sucks, and I think it could the album could have done better off without it or if the song hadn’t be preceded by a Riyu Kosaka individual song. Sorry (but not really).\n\n9) Determination\n\nWe’re back to a faster tempo song with a pop-dance feel. All of the members sound comfortable with the melodies that they are given and they do sound united in this song as well. To me it sounds like an opening theme to an anime [something like a magical girl anime]. I do like this song a lot and it kind of pumps me up. The verses aren’t really memorable, but the chorus is what truly shines both in arrangement and in melody. There’s not much to say besides the verses and the chorus don’t really seem connected at all and the arrangement only changes slightly.\n\n10) Ikiru Imi\n\nThis is the last song on the album. And it is a ballad. I’m glad that Determination wasn’t too fast, but it’s not like it lead into this song too easily. The main instrument heard in Ikiru Imi is piano. As the song goes on, percussion instruments are added, then strings which are always lovely in my book. All the members sound comfortable singing, although there is tension in the song [that’s bound to happen in ballads and is very welcomed in my opinion]. The group ends singing in harmony and the Piano leads out. This song has a relatively simple arrangement and kind of sounds cliché, but it makes me feel fulfilled, warm and is a beautiful way to end the album.\n\nNow for the Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\n\n-Very good sound when the girls sing together\n\n-Production and composition very good.\n\nCons:\n\n– Fukushita’s song could have sounded better if written in a more comfortable range for her.\n\n-The cover of “Shangri-La” is the weakest song on the album [in my opinion, of course]\n\nTotal score for the album is 14.\n\nSCORE:\n\nVocals: 3.5/5\n\nComposition: 4/5\n\nArrangement: 3/5\n\nConstruction: 3/5\n\nTOTAL: 14/20 (Could use lots of work outside of production values)\n\nOverall:\n\nFor the most part, all the members sound comfortable while singing. There are times where the members’ voices kind of clash, but in a good way. You get a variety of music on this album, from slightly electronic, to ballads to folksy songs but for some, the more energetic songs may sound repetitive. There are times where it feels like you’re jumping from one musical style to another and for me, it’s not horrific, but I think the tracks could have had more of a transition between them. Believe me, it is a decent album and I expected a lot more from a previously amazing group of singers. I think those who are more of a fan of girl groups would probably like this album, but there are better ones out there, I’m sure of it."
