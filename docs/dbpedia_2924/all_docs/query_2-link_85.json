        "text": "Name\n\nAvex is an acronym of the English words Audio Visual Expert. Since its foundation, its corporate name was Avex D.D., Incorporated, and ten years later it was changed to Avex, Incorporated.\n\nThe current name, Avex Group Holdings, Incorporated, was adopted in 2004 as part of reconstruction process after Tom Yoda's resignation. Avex Group Holdings, Incorporated was used for the main subsidiaries, while the old name (Avex, Incorporated) was for entertainment components of the Group.\n\nIn 2005, Avex, Incorporated became Avex Entertainment, Incorporated, and stayed on as part of the Group.\n\n1988-1999: The early years\n\nAvex was registered June 1, 1973 as Avex DD Incorporated (エイベックス・ディー・ディー株式会社, Eibekkusu Di Di Kabushiki Gaisha), although it did not become established until 1988. They began as a CD wholesaler based in Machida, Tokyo. In September 1990, they opened a recording studio and created Avex Trax as a music label. In the same year, they created \"Musique Folio Inc.\", a music publishing company, which became \"Prime Direction Inc.\"\n\nIn 1993, they transferred to Aoyama, Tokyo and created a U.S. branch, called \"AV Experience America Inc.\" The year also marked the first of Avex's yearly events. It was held in Tokyo Dome under the name \"avex rave '93\" and attracted 50,000 attendees. This marked the foundation of the Cutting Edge label.\n\nIn 1994, they formed two UK subsidiaries, \"Rhythm Republic Limited\" and \"Avex U.K. Limited,\" to particularly distribute the parent label's music releases in what would later become the Chinese special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. Later that year, they opened a disco, claimed on their website to be \"the world's largest scale disco\", named Velfarre.\n\nIn 1997, they opened a series of concert halls called \"Zepp\" with Sony Music Entertainment Japan. That same year, following Hong Kong's handover to the People's Republic of China, \"Rhythm Republic Limited\" and \"Avex U.K. Limited\" were merged to form a new company, \"Avex Asia Limited,\" which was re-branded as \"Avex Hong Kong Limited\" in September 2008 before being absorbed into \"Avex Taiwan Incorporated\" in January 2014.\n\nIn early 1999, they signed an agreement with Walt Disney Records and Hollywood Records to handle the companies' Japanese CD releases. Later that year \"Avex Mode\", an animation company, was established. In December, the company was listed on the 1st section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 7860.\n\n2000-2009: Times of unity and divisiveness\n\nIn 2001, Avex opened the \"avex artists academy\" music school.\n\nIn 2002, they released the \"CCCD\", a type of copy-protected CD, and opened their building in Aoyama, paid for by Sumitomo Life and worth 205 billion yen.}.\n\nIn 2003, they opened a classical music business (named Avex Classics).\n\nIn 2004, they began selling Japanese music CDs in South Korea and Avex President Max Matsuura \"spotted\" former idol Ami Suzuki performing live at the annual festival of their school, Nihon University. He subsequently signed her to the Avex label.\n\nIn 2005, Avex acquired distribution rights for Aozora Records' catalogue including all future Hitomi Yaida releases.\n\nIn early 2008, Avex partnered with Victor JVC to officially create the label D-topia Entertainment as a business partnership between the labels and its founder, Terukado Onishi, with the sales promotion handled by Victor while the area promotion handled by Avex. As part of the Avex Group's 20th anniversary celebration, a big project occurred with avex trax's \"produced by avex trax\" artists; the band Girl Next Door, formed and debuted in September 2008.\n\nAvex Group launched its own IPTV service, BeeTV, May 2009 in partnership with NTT DoCoMo.\n\n2004: Internal Feud : Max Matsuura v. Tom Yoda\n\nIn August 2004, a feud between Max Matsuura and co-founder Tom Yoda almost ruined the group. It started because of Yoda's ambition to expand Avex into other entertainment-related ventures, especially producing movies. In addition, he accused Ryuhei Chiba, the company's executive director and president of Avex Inc. (now Avex Planning and Development), of pursuing personal profit from a few big artists.\n\nJuly 30: In a board meeting, Yoda introduced a resolution calling on Chiba to resign because of an alleged conflict of interest. A source says the disagreement arose because Chiba had signed an artist managed by a member of his family. The board backed Yoda's resolution in a 6-1 vote. However, Matsuura — described by insiders as a close ally of Chiba — introduced a second resolution demanding that Yoda step down due to \"a difference of opinion in management principles.\" Matsuura's motion was defeated 5-2. He and Chiba resigned the next day.\n\nAugust 2: Matsuura and Chiba announced their resignations in a meeting with employees of Avex. Chiba denied any fault, while Matsuura complained that Avex had lost its love of music and said he wanted to start over. They had the support of many staff who also said they would quit. More significantly, the label's top star, Ayumi Hamasaki, said would leave. As a result, Avex's stocks in the TSE fell by 16 percent that day.\n\nAugust 3: Due to pressure by employees and artists and to save the company from bankruptcy, Yoda resigned and was replaced by Toshio Kobayashi.\n\n2010-Present\n\nAGHD is listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Börse München of Germany under the ticker symbol AX8.\n\nMore K-pop artists from other agencies continued to sign with Avex such as YG Entertainment's 2NE1 (2010), S-plus Entertainment's SS501 member Kim Hyung Jun (2011), Pledis Entertainment's After School (2011), NH Media's U-KISS (2011) and Yejeon Media's Shu-I (2011).\n\nOn July 21, 2011, it was announced that Avex had paired with Korean management label YG Entertainment to form YGEX Entertainment.\n\nIn 2012, the group began offering limited releases for sale, DRM-free for the first time within Japan on Amazon MP3. Max Matsuura and Toshio Kobayashi, the company's top two individual shareholders, launched their own investment companies to anchor their shares in 2012.\n\nAs a show of modernization, Avex Group moved to Izumi Garden Tower in Roppongi in October 2014. The company was designated to the 36th floor – the former address of DWANGO.\n\nSubsidiaries\n\nIn April 2010 - the Avex Group corporation was re-structured to establish Avex Music Publishing Inc. as a consolidated subsidiary, in a corporate spin-off of music publishing division of Avex Group Holdings Inc. Thus the Avex Group became a pure holding company, with a corporate structure as follows:\n\nJapan\n\nAvex Entertainment Inc.
