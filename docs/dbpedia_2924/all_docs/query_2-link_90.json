        "text": "I work for AVEX, the largest music label and management company in Japan, the second biggest market for music in the world. In my position, we talk to all of the A&R executives and developing talented, young, international artists is a huge focus for us at the moment.\n\nWith leading producer's Tetsuya Komuro's assistance, Avex became Japan's leading dance record company during the 1990s, and continues producing and recording some of Japan's most famous pop singers such as Japan's highest selling solo musician, Ayumi Hamasaki. The company also provides theme music soundtracks to many anime and a few video games through its subsidiary Avex Mode.\n\nAvex Group is mainly known in Japan because of its flagship music imprint, Avex Trax, which was founded in 1990. It is one of the top three record labels in Japan since the Komuro period, and is currently the biggest (14.7% of all recorded music sales as of first half 2013), ahead of Sony Music Entertainment Japan (13.0%), Universal Music Japan (9.9%), King Records (7.4%) and J Storm (5.9%)."
