        "text": "Create records\n\nCreate a record\n\nOnce you have created a reference entity, you can add records. Letâ€™s say that you just have created the Brand reference entity, you have defined its records attributes and now it is time to add new records. For example: Fermob, Kartell, Muuto, Fatboyâ€¦\n\nTo add a new brand to the Brand reference entity:\n\nGo to your Brand entity (you will automatically land on the records grid)\n\nThen click Add new, choose a label for the record (the PIM will automatically take its label to generate your record's code, but you can change it if needed).\n\nCreate several records\n\nVIA THE UI\n\nIf you have several records to add to your reference entity, you can stay in the creation pop-in to quickly add as many records as needed:\n\nInput the first record label\n\nTick Create another record\n\nPress Enter\n\nAdd the label for each record\n\nOnce you've done, press Esc or Echap\n\nVIA THE RECORD IMPORT PROFILE\n\nIt is also possible to create and edit a list of records in an excel or csv file, and then import it in the PIM. To do so, you have to create a new import profile in the Imports menu, and select the Reference entity record import in CSV or Reference entity record import in XLSX job. As for your product imports, you can import record images as well, using an archive.\n\nVIA THE API\n\nCheck out our dedicated documentation to learn how to create several records via the API ðŸ˜‰.\n\nDisplay records\n\nTo see the records of the reference entity, click on the Records tab in the left menu. You will see the records grid, where all the records of the entity are listed.\n\nThe records grid\n\nThe records grid is quite different than the products' one. Thereafter are the specific features of this grid:\n\nThe line with the attributes names is frozen: it allows you to scroll down the page, while continuing to see the name of the attributes\n\nThe first 4 columns with image, label, code and completeness are also frozen. We added an horizontal scroll in order to see the content of all the columns\n\nWe also added a tooltip to preview the content of a text attribute directly in the grid when you hover over the text\n\nFinally, the grid comes with an infinite scroll that allows you to display up to 500 results. If you reach this limit, the grid will show the following message \"You just scrolled through the first 500 results out of 1450 records. To see more, try with more specific search criteria.\"\n\nOf course, you can still edit or delete a record thanks to the buttons at the end of each line.\n\nSearch for a record\n\nFull text search\n\nOur goal is to facilitate your work and to increase your productivity. To make this possible, we made a very powerful search in the grid of records. Indeed, we implemented a full text search which allows you to search on code, label and text attribute types.\n\nFor example, if you search for the word Â« famous Â», all the records containing the word Â« famous Â» in their code, label or text attribute types will be displayed.\n\nAnd we can go further. If you search for \"famous\" and \"bags\", then only the record containing both \"famous\" and \"bags\" words will be displayed.\n\nFilter on completeness\n\nYou can also filter on completeness in order to see the records that are complete/incomplete, or choose to see all the records, no matter their completeness.\n\nWe added the possibility to filter on single/multiple options or reference entity single/multiple links attributes types in the records grid. This filter allows an exact search on an reference entity option value or on a reference entity link.\n\nFor instance:\n\nIf a \"Brand\" reference entity has a \"Designers\" attribute linked to a \"Designer\" reference entity, you can search for all brands with the designer \"Ron Arad\".\n\nIf a \"Brand\" reference entity has a \"Country\" attribute with a list of options, you can search for brands with the country \"Italy\".\n\nThe operator is an in list operator. If you are looking for the brand with the designer \"Philippe Starck\" OR \"Ron Arad\", the brands with the designer \"Philippe Starck\" OR the designer \"Ron Arad\" will be displayed.\n\nYou can combine filters. For instance, you can search on all brands with the country \"Italy\" AND the designer \"Ron Arad\".\n\nA record or an option can be removed from a filter using the cross.\n\nTo empty a filter, you can click on the eraser.\n\nEdit a record\n\nOf course, you can edit a record in order to change values or add new ones. Nothing simpler: just go on a record and add/change the values you want.\n\nAs for a product, you can define if you want a different content according to channels, and the same applies on locales. You can find a locale and channel switcher on each record, meaning that if you need to translate values for example, you can do it simply switching from a locale to another.\n\nIn the Attribute tab, if you define a \"text area\" attribute for your records, you can tick the parameter rich text editor. This will give you access to a set of options to improve the format of your text. For example, you can change the font, the size, etc. You can also add a link, a video, an image. In fact, the Rich text editor offers a large bunch of possibilities!\n\nDisplay the products linked to a record\n\nYou can see the first products linked to a record in a new Products tab directly from a reference entity record.\n\nTo display the 1st products linked to a Kartell record:\n\nGo to the Kartell record\n\nThen click on the Products tab\n\nTo open a product, just click on it and the product form will open in a new tab.\n\nIn this Products tab, the 20 first products linked to a record (for the selected product attribute) are displayed as well as the total number of products linked (\"xx results\").\n\nIf more than 20 products are linked to the record, a message is displayed after the last products:\n\nIf you want to display all the products linked to a record, you just have to click on the View all products button, it will open the product grid with a filter on the product attribute linked and the Kartell value. Then, from the product grid, you can search and launch enrichment actions on these products.\n\nFollow the records completeness\n\nLike for products, we calculate completeness on records.\n\nIn the records, several indicators show you the status of your completeness and which attributes are missing.\n\nYellow bullet points in front of each missing required attribute, showing that you have to complete this attribute to improve the completeness.\n\nThe completeness percentage in the header of the record informs you of the completeness level.\n\nThe completeness is automatically calculated as soon as we enrich a required attribute. It means that the bullet point will disappear as soon as the required attribute is filled, and same for the completeness percentage evolution.\n\nLink a record to another record\n\nIt is also possible to link a record to another one, and it is very simple.\n\nFor example, you can link a Designer (let's say \"Philippe Starck\") to the record \"Kartell\", or to several records brands belonging to the \"Brands\" entity.\n\nPlease refer to this article to discover how to do so.\n\nOnce you have chosen which entity is linked, you can see a new selector with all the records of the linked entity.\n\nWe added the completeness of a record in the selector.\n\nDelete records\n\nDelete a record\n\nYou can delete a record or all the records of an entity.\n\nTo delete a record, 2 choices:\n\nEither directly in the records grid, by clicking on the trash can button on each record line.\n\nEither in the details of the record, by clicking on the ... button at the top right corner of the header then delete.\n\nDelete a selection of records\n\nIt is possible to delete your own selection of records."
