The Chuck Jones Center for Creativity and the Art Institute of California–Orange County celebrated Chuck Jones’s 104th birthday with a gala inauguration of a new exhibit, “Birth of a Notion” on his birthday, September 21st. The exhibit chronicles Jones’s passionate belief in the power of the human form as it relates to the production of the animated film.

Many thanks to the Art Institute of California–Orange County for hosting the exhibit and presenting the reception. It was a perfect celebration of the creative genius of Chuck Jones!
