His voice was originated by Frank Welker.\n\nThroughout the years, Hanna-Barbera, Cartoon Network, and Warner Bros. Animation, as well as book and video game publishers, have conceived several incarnations, which don't always fit together because new writers have come on board and disregarded what has come before or there has been a complete reboot, but the general concept has been the same, except for DC Comics and Max's radically altered Scooby Apocalypse and Velma, respectively.\n\nCharacter description\n\nFred is a teenager with blonde hair and a broad physique. His uniform consists of a white sweater over a blue shirt, blue pants, and brown shoes. His most famous attribute is his orange ascot. Alternatively in A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, he instead wears black sneakers and has a white sweater with orange stripes on his sleeves. In What's New, Scooby-Doo?, he traded his ascot for a white sweater with blue stripes.\n\nThroughout the years, Fred's role as the leader of Mystery Inc. has largely been the same. He usually takes the lead in solving mysteries and mostly accompanies Daphne with him; sometimes with Velma also, and other times without her. He is seen constructing various Rube Goldberg-type traps for villains, which Scooby-Doo and/or Shaggy often set off by mistake and allow the villain to be captured the other way. Although a nice guy, Fred can get pretty bossy at times, forcing Shaggy and Scooby to take part in getting the villain despite their fears and/or better judgment. Fred was originally level-headed and confident in his earlier appearances, though this has been shaken up in other incarnations of his character.\n\nAs a child in A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, Fred is the polar opposite of his older self, being less intelligent, more hyperactive and superstitious. He frequently gets picked on by bully Red Herring, and is always the one to accuse him on many accounts of a mystery. He is a subscriber to the National Exaggerator magazine, believing in \"real\" monsters and making up some wild conspiracies.\n\nFred's interests include traps, solving mysteries, martial arts,[2] wrestling,[3] and weightlifting;[4] a recurring joke in What's New, Scooby-Doo? is that he would boast about bench pressing 220.\n\nAppearances\n\nTV series\n\nMovies\n\nSpecials\n\nShorts\n\nComics\n\nBooks\n\nVideo games\n\nStage performances\n\nBiography\n\nThose Original Mysteries\n\nThe N̶e̶w̶ Decades Old Scooby-Doo M̶o̶v̶i̶e̶s̶ 40 Minute Episodes\n\nBack to Basics\n\nDynomic Duo\n\nThe Scrappy years\n\nScrappy Saves the Show\n\nDaphne, Freddy, and Velma MIA\n\nFreddy's Break from Mystery Writing\n\nThe Coolest Pup Around\n\nTHIS TIME THE MONSTERS ARE REAL\n\nCartoon Network Spoofs\n\nHarvey Birdman Represents\n\nFred Gets Real\n\nFred Goes (Pop)Punk\n\nWhat's New in the Movies\n\nGonna Sing This Song ALL DAY LONG\n\nFred Gets Real (again)\n\nReturn of the Ascot (DTVs since Abracadabra-Doo)\n\nCrystal Cove Chronicles\n\nFred Ain't Nobody's Puppet\n\nFred in the Lego World\n\nFred Griffin\n\nScooby-Doo and Guess Who? the Creators Wanted to See Thirty Years Ago?\n\nSCOOB! on the Big Screen\n\nScoobyless Riverdale\n\nFred is portrayed as a shallow, spoiled jerk with misogynist tendencies, claiming he can't remember Velma's name because he blatantly thinks that she's unattractive.\n\nFred Sells Out\n\nThe gang gets help from State Farm agent Lucy Rodas after the Mystery Machine gets knocked into a ditch by the Creeper.\n\nRob reads some text from Timmy, the Internet, finding a show to replace Rob's eternal nemesis Gumball that would be something akin to Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, with a Great Dane and his \"kooky friends\" who solve mysteries in a van, but then the kids would have to switch to another channel to watch that.[5]\n\nLooneyverse\n\nIn the Duck Dodgers episode \"Surf the Stars,\" During the surfing montage where Duck Dodgers and the Crusher run by in various outfits, Mystery Inc. briefly runs by the screen.\n\nIn the Warner Bros. ServerVerse in Space Jam: A New Legacy, the gang (based on their SCOOB! designs), arrives at the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad in the Mystery Machine, then watch from outside the van. Mystery Inc., like all the other IPs, has no particular preference and just reacts to whatever is happening.\n\nTitans Go!\n\nFred and his friends are forced by Control Freak to compete against the Teen Titans in a game of Family Feud.[6]\n\nMystery Inc. are guests at Warner Bros.' 100th anniversary party at their Burbank studio, where the Teen Titans are acting as security.[7]\n\nFred in the Funny Books\n\nMarvel's Laff-a-Lympics\n\nFred Simps Out and Still Survives the Apocalypse\n\nFred Takes a Step Back in Scholastic's Daphne and Velma\n\nFred in the Cyber Realm of Video Games\n\nFred is a playable character in Scooby-Doo! Mystery of the Fun Park Phantom, Scooby-Doo! First Frights, and Scooby-Doo! and the Spooky Swamp.\n\nDevelopment\n\nFred's template was the title character of the radio show Jack Armstrong, All-American Boy,[8] with a bit of Dobie Gillis from the 1960s sitcom The Many Lives of Dobie Gillis.[9][10]\n\nFred went through three different names before Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! aired. He began as Geoff, then Harvey, then Ronnie in storyboards, until Fred Silverman, then head of CBS' children's programming, recommended his own name.\n\nWhen developing Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!, co-creator Jon Colton Barry patterned Fred on Gene Wilder's character Frederick Frankenstein from the 1974 film Young Frankenstein.\n\nGallery\n\nMain article: Fred Jones/Gallery\n\nToys and merchandise\n\nMain article: Fred Jones/Toys\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nDespite popular belief that Fred has no catchphrase, it is suggested in most appearances that his catchphrases are something similar to \"Another mystery solved\", \"Let's split up\" and \"Looks like we have a(nother) mystery on our hands\". Despite this, he does not have a catchphrase when suprised like with the other Mystery Inc. members (e.g. \"Zoinks!\", \"Jinkies!\", and \"Jeepers!\").\n\nFred shamefully admits not having it at one point in Scooby-Doo! and the Samurai Sword, when the rest of the gang say their unique phrases.\n\nMore recently, Fred would occasionally say \"Hold the phone!\" when he finds an important discovery.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nWARNING: The following section contains content that may be seen as mature or offensive to some readers. Reader discretion is advised.\n\nMain article: List of pop culture references to Scooby-Doo\n\nIn the Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures episode \"Don't Touch That Dial,\" there is a parody show called Ring-A-Ding, Where Are You!, in which there isn't a strict doppelganger of Fred, but one of the characters is dressed in white and blue like Fred.\n\nIn the Red Razors arc of Judge Dredd: The Megazine, a group of Sov-Block mercenary enforcers called themselves the Spooky Doo Gang, due to owning a dog called Spooky who resembled a green Scooby-Doo. Fred's doppelganger is also called Freddy.\n\nIn the Garfield and Friends episode \"The Automated, Animated Adventure,\" Jon takes his idea for a cartoon based on Garfield to the Sprocket Animation Company, where Mr. Sprocket has his own ideas that are just to redo what others have already done such as suggesting that Garfield should expose phony ghosts with three kids every week, with Mr. Sprocket's computer displaying how it would look, with Garfield and the kids outside a spooky mansion, with Garfield in the shaky arms of a Shaggy doppelganger beside a Fred doppelganger, and one black girl with character traits of both Daphne and Velma.\n\nIn Disney's Doug episode \"Doug's Bloody Buddy,\" the teaser depicts a fantasy in which Doug and his friends are like Mystery Inc. searching for the Bluffington Vampire; Chalky is the counterpart to Fred.\n\nIn the Animaniacs segment \"Back in Style,\" the Warner siblings are loaned to a Hanna-Barbera-type studio that lets the Warner siblings \"play themselves\" in its cartoon Uhuru, Where Are You? In this parody, Ted acts as a stand-in for Fred, and is also voiced by Frank Welker.\n\nIn the Arthur segment \"The Rat Who Came to Dinner,\" Fred is anthropomorphized as an animal with the rest of the gang in Mr. Ratburn's favorite old show Spooky-Poo.\n\nIn the Spaced episode \"Beginnings,\" Daisy wanders into Tim's bedroom after hearing a noise and is spooked by his alien mask. Tim finds her and she keeps on saying she heard a noise, so Tim says she was playing Scooby-Doo. She says she used to play as Daphne when she was little, as did Tim play as Freddie when he was younger, but now Tim and Daisy look more like Shaggy and Velma.\n\nIn the Timon and Pumbaa episode \"Werehog of London,\" a fortune teller warns Timon and Pumbaa that no one is safe from the curse of the werehog, not even \"those meddling teens and their pesky dog.\" Then the camera reveals an orange and blue van resembling the Mystery Machine that has been abandoned after it was knocked into a lampost.\n\nIn the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode \"Beauty and the Beasts,\" Willow packs her forensic tools in a King-Seeley lunch box that shows off the side with the gang riding the Mystery Machine.\n\nOn the first page of Archie's Weird Mysteries #6, Archie is dressed up like Fred as he becomes a parody of Fred for the comic's story (sans outfit). He makes out with Veronica who has taken on the role of Daphne.\n\nIn the film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the title characters hitchhike in a green van owned by a bunch of odd adults vaguely resembling Mystery Incorporated. The Fred doppelganger, referred to in the credits as \"The Guy,\" is made fun of by Shaggy by wearing a neckerchief. He then gets high from a \"doobie snack.\" But this is all just a dream of Jay's.\n\nIn the film Freddy vs. Jason, Gibb, Kia, and Lori play a verbal game of \"Marry, Fuck, Kill,\" with the former proposing Fred, Scooby, and Shaggy. Kia and Lori rightly refuse to answer her question.\n\nIn the Veronica Mars episode \"You Think You Know Somebody,\" Wallace calls Veronica Velma when she talks about how easy it was to find out about someone's details online, but Veronica prefers to think of herself as Daphne. Veronica then asks Wallace if he is supposed to be Fred, but he dismisses this as his \"white boy\" of choice, as he prefers Shaggy because of his \"flavor,\" which Veronica finds ironic after she finds he is still subscribed to Mad magazine.\n\nIn the Gilmore Girls episode \"Knit, People, Knit,\" Rory attends a 2002-themed party, where a poster of the Scooby-Doo film has been put up on a door, with Shaggy and Fred visible.\n\nIn the Johnny Test episode \"Johnny Dukey Doo,\" Gil joins Johnny and the gang in investigating a haunted mansion, with his ghost gear, which consists of a white shirt and orange neckerchief.\n\nIn the Torchwood book Trace Memory, Owen thought of himself as Fred, but Toshi thought he was more like Shaggy.\n\nIn The Big Bang Theory episode \"The Guitarist Amplification,\" at the Comic Center of Pasadena, Scooby-Doo #146 (with Fred on the cover) is on a shelf between Leonard and Raj, and later still when Leonard and Penny talk Sheldon into coming back home after the couple promises to stop fighting.\n\nIn Cracked's parody called \"Scooby Don't,\" the Mystery Squad is told off by the police after they tie up an innocent homeless old man at an abandoned carnival. Fred is called Free.\n\nIn the New Teen Titans short \"Turn Back the Clock,\" Mad Mod turns back time altering the appearances of the Teen Titans with each passing decade, with the 70s making them look like Mystery Inc.; Robin is Fred.\n\nChad is a parody of Fred in the independent horror film Saturday Morning Massacre (later retitled Saturday Morning Mystery). Gwen is in a relationship with Gwen, which is a reference to the perceived hidden romance between Fred and Daphne from the original series.\n\nIn the Suburgatory episode \"The Witch of East Chatswin,\" on a Halloween night, Tessa and Lisa dress as Daphne and Velma, respectively, while Malik and Ryan both go as Fred, which causes an argument between the two, with Malik feeling offended that Ryan expects him to go as Shaggy, unless he was expected to go as Scooby. Despite the trouble, Malik does change his costume to Shaggy.\n\nIn the Ben 10: Omniverse episode \"Mystery, Incorporeal,\" Kevin says, \"Looks like we've got a mystery on our hands,\" which is a near-verbatim of Fred's reaction to starting a new mystery.\n\nThe series is parodied in the Austin & Ally episode \"Mysteries & Meddling Kids,\" when while at a disco party, Dez and his friends dress up as his favorite characters from a 70s cartoon called Groovy Goat and the Mystery Bunch, with Austin filling in the Fred role as Chaz.\n\nIndependent game developer Alexander Mahan has been developing his online game Yandere Simulator for the public since 2014, which has only become available to play in demo mode. In the story, a group of kids called the Photography Club eventually resembled Mystery Incorporated through several tweaks, with Fureddo Jonzu, the Japanese name for Fred Jones, having the same short blond hair and ascot.\n\nIn the Regular Show episode \"The Dream Warrior,\" Rigby and Mordecai introduce Pops to a cartoon called Funkie Wunky and the Groovy Gang which features a Fred type called Chad. After the cartoon, Pops has a dream of what he had just watched with himself in the role of Chad.\n\nIn AOK's parody called \"Scooby-Doo, Who Are You?,\" Fred discovers that not everybody wears a mask, when he accidentally tears off a bad guy's face, a cop's face, and then Shaggy's face. Velma grows rapidly suspicious of Fred's actions, and believes he is wearing a mask, only to tear off his actual face. Daphne is devastated over what Velma did to Fred's \"beautiful face,\" and tears off her face in retaliation.\n\nIn the RWBY Chibi episode \"The Mystery Bunch,\" Sun and Neptune of Team SSSN/The Junior Detectives discover Team JNPR/The Mystery Bunch (imitating Mystery Inc.) muscling in on their territory. The Mystery Bunch joyfully talk about how finding a mystery soon that they will inevitably find by accident, when a Grimm monster appears and chases them through several doors, as the Junior Detectives just watch. The Grimm is caught and discovered to be Old Man Shopkeep, who mumbles in annoyance, \"And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids.\" Sun and Neptune are confused by what has happened, so eat their Zwei Snacks to get to their level. Lie Ren wears a orange ascot like Fred.\n\nIn \"Wanderers v Pedagogues,\" an episode of the BBC Two quiz show Only Connect, host Victoria Coren Mitchell begins by saying, \"Good evening.
