Have an account? .\n\nAn adult animated show centered on the Scooby Doo character Velma Dinkley is now streaming on HBO Max.\n\nVelma is voiced by Mindy Kaling, who also created the show and serves as an executive producer.\n\nHere's the cast of the 10-episode first season of \"Velma.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Office\" alum Mindy Kaling voices the titular sleuth.\n\nIn this reimagining, Velma is South Asian and the show tells the origin story of the brains behind the Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.\n\n\"Growing up, I've always identified with Velma,\" Kaling, who serves as an executive producer, said at a \"Velma\" panel at New York Comic Con in October 2022.\n\n\"She was so cute, but not like traditionally hot — super smart, super thick glasses, questionable haircut,\" the actress said. \"I just love the series and I feel so honored to do the voice.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConstance Wu voices Daphne, who's a mean girl on the show.\n\nAccording to the official \"Velma\" social media accounts, this show's version of Daphne will be \"known for much more than being hot. Though, fear not, that's still a large part of it.\"\n\n\"She's not demure, she has mysteries that she has to figure out about her own life that we find out about,\" Kaling said of Daphne at NYCC. \"And I think there's a quality that Constance brings to the character too, Constance projects strength and her vocal acting also projects strength.\"\n\n\"All of the characters really delve into their family life and things that we didn't really get to see in the original series,\" she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" star Glenn Howerton plays Fred, the eventual leader of the Mystery Inc. gang.\n\nAt NYCC, Kaling said that none of the characters of the original \"Scooby Doo\" were defined by their whiteness, except for Fred.\n\n\"We knew we wanted an incredible comedy actor, who also had this humanity,\" Kaling added of Howerton, who previously worked with her on the series '\"The Mindy Project.\"\n\n\"Velma\" won't include Scooby, but Norville — aka Shaggy — is part of the show, voiced by Emmy nominee Sam Richardson.\n\n\"Minus the whiteness, I was very much a Fred,\" Richardson said at NYCC of the character he most associated with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVelma's dad, Aman, is voiced by Russell Peters.\n\nPeters is a stand-up comedian who has also voiced characters on \"BoJack Horseman,\" \"Family Guy,\" and \"Bob's Burgers.\"\n\nSarayu Blue voices Velma's mom named Diya, who disappears.\n\nBlue most recently starred as a parent on Netflix's hit teen show \"Never Have I Ever,\" which Kaling cocreated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" star Melissa Fumero plays Sophie, Aman's girlfriend.\n\nFumero most recently starred on the workplace comedy series called \"Blockbuster,\" based on the now-defunct rental service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Glee\" star Jane Lynch plays Donna, one of Daphne's police-officer moms.\n\nLynch \"steals every scene,\" according to the official \"Velma\" Twitter account.\n\nThe actress was recently seen on Hulu's \"Only Murders in the Building.\" But she's also done voice work for shows like \"Big Hero 6: The Series,\" \"American Dad!\" and \"Ridley Jones.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActress and comedian Wanda Sykes voices Linda, Daphne's second mom.\n\nYou may recognize Sykes for her roles in \"A Bad Moms Christmas,\" \"Black-ish,\" and \"The Good Fight.\"\n\nShe also voiced Queen of Fables on a few episodes of the HBO Max animated series \"Harley Quinn.\"\n\nFrank Welker, the original voice actor for Fred, plays Fred's dad named William Jones on \"Velma.\"\n\nWelker has also done voice work for the \"Transformers\" franchise and other \"Scooby-Doo\" shows and movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmmy winner Cherry Jones stars as Fred's mom, Victoria.\n\nJones' extensive list of credits includes roles on \"Succession,\" \"Transparent,\" \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" and \"24.\"\n\nEmmy-nominated \"Nailed It!\" host Nicole Byer stars as Blythe Rogers, Norville's mom.\n\nByer has recently done voice work for the show \"Tuca & Bertie\" and \"The Bob's Burgers Movie.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic plays a presumably wacky character named Dandruff Tuba.\n\n\"Harry Potter\" star Daniel Radcliffe played Yankovic in a biopic that was released on The Roku Channel on November 4, 2022.\n\nMing-Na Wen voices a mystery character named Carrol.\n\nThe \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" actress is perhaps best known for voicing the Disney character Mulan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortune Feimster voices a popular girl at school named Olive.\n\nThe stand-up comedian previously starred as Colette Kimball-Kinney on Kaling's show \"The Mindy Project.\"\n\n\"Insecure\" star Yvonne Orji plays a cool girl named Gigi.\n\nAside from her role as Molly Carter on \"Insecure,\" Orji has also appeared in movies like \"Night School\" and \"The Blackening.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Pretty Little Liars\" star Shay Mitchell voices Brenda, a queen bee at school.\n\nAside from acting, Mitchell is also the designer and creator of the travel brand Béis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nTV Celebrities\n\nAdvertisement"
