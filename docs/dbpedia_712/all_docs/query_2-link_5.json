        "text": "Frederick \"Fred\" Jones, also known as Freddie, is a fictional character from Scooby-Doo. He is the official leader of Mystery Incorporated.\n\nHe has been voiced by Frank Welker ever since the character's first appearance in 1969. Freddie Prinze Jr. roles the portrayal of Fred in the two Raja Gosnell movies. Zac Efron plays the voice of Fred in CGI animated film Scoob!.Glenn Howerton played Fred in Velma.\n\nIn Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, Fred is the one whose idea it is to solve mysteries and he is the one who says they should split up to look for clues. Fred always looks with Daphne Blake. Fred also gives Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers Scooby Snacks to get them to do things that they think are dangerous.\n\nAfter Scrappy-Doo became a character, Scrappy liked to build traps for monsters but Shaggy and Scooby fell into them. So after Scrappy stopped being a character, Fred usually became the one who wanted to trap the monsters.\n\nAfter a crossover episode with Johnny Bravo, Fred started dating Daphne Blake.[1]\n\nIn the live action movie Scooby-Doo, Fred takes the credit for whatever Velma does and doesn’t bother to help Daphne when she’s in danger. But later he and Daphne fall in love.\n\nIn Velma, Fred is rich, makes insulting comments towards women and people from other races, is not smart enough to use a fork and thinks he’s better than everyone else."
