He is shown to have blond hair, and wearing a white shirt, blue jeans, and his signature orange ascot. He also drives the Mystery Machine.\n\nVery inventive, he is the one that rigs up the Rube Goldberg traps to catch villains, despite Shaggy and Scooby usually setting them off. He is also the strongest person in the group. It is speculated by fans that he and Daphne both have crushes on each other, but this is not expicitly shown until Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated. He is also shown to have an interest in various sports throughout the series."
