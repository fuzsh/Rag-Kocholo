        "text": "After two live-action theatrical films, countless DVD releases (and even a Supernatural crossover), Scooby-Doo and his mystery-solving crew are headed back to the big screen. Warner Bros. is officially moving forward with a new animated Scooby-Doo movie, adding a few famous voices to the groovy gang and pairing them with other well-known Hanna-Barbera properties.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Jane the Virgin star Gina Rodriguez will play the new Velma, while MacGruber fave Will Forte adds a few cracks to his voice as Shaggy. Fellow Saturday Night Live alum Tracy Morgan will play Captain Caveman—the film sees “the Mystery Inc. gang join forces with other heroes of the Hanna-Barbera universe to save the world from Dick Dastardly and his evil plans”—while Frank Welker reprises his role as Scooby himself. Welker is better known for voicing Fred Jones in most Scooby incarnations, but has also voiced the title character since 2002.\n\nVeteran animation director Tony Cervone will helm the untitled film, while Chris Columbus, Charles Roven and Allison Abbate produce. Warner Bros. is angling for a May 2020 release, leaving additional casting developments forthcoming.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nHow Trumpworld Is Coping With the Kamala Harris Boom\n\nIn just days, the vice president has raked in more than $100 million, scored countless endorsements, started a social media phenomenon, and secured enough delegates for the nomination. “She has been totally dominating,” marveled one GOP strategist.\n\nTelevision\n\nJ.D.
