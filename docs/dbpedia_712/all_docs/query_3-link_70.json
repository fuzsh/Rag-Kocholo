        "text": "01 of 20\n\nThe Angry Birds Movie (2016)\n\nWhile it may be damning with faint praise to give credit to The Angry Birds Movie for not being a total disaster...it really could've been much worse. Based on the wildly popular app of the same name, the film follows Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis), a talking bird who comes to suspect that his island's new pig inhabitants have malicious intent. Your mileage may vary depending on your tolerance for punny/juvenile humor, but as EW's review notes, the film \"delivers a mildly diverting mix of winky meta-jokes and moral lessons, cannily aimed at both the next generation of tiny consumers and their more sophisticated parents.\" —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch The Angry Birds Movie: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly\n\nCast: Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Kate McKinnon, Sean Penn, Tony Hale, Keegan-Michael Key, Bill Hader, Peter Dinklage\n\n02 of 20\n\nApollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood (2022)\n\nRichard Linklater returned to rotoscope animation following Waking Life (2001) and A Scanner Darkly (2006), with this nostalgic trip back to the summer of '69. Young Stanley is an imaginative young boy whose investment in the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon causes him to fantasize about being onboard the history-making spaceship. Jack Black voices the adult version of Stanley, looking back on his childhood memories with fondness. Fans of Linklater's Oscar-nominated film Boyhood (2014) will find the director working in familiar territory here, exploring the coming-of-age process with a wistful eye. The dreamlike film earned widespread acclaim from critics, praising its dreamlike atmosphere and vivid animation. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Apollo 10½: A Space Age Childhood: Netflix\n\nDirector: Richard Linklater\n\nCast: Jack Black, Milo Coy, Glen Powell, Zachary Levi\n\n03 of 20\n\nCaptain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (2017)\n\nThe wildly popular Captain Underpants book series has kept kids entertained since 1997, but it wasn't until 20 years later that the tighty-whities-clad hero made it to the big screen. The First Epic Movie centers on George and Harold, fourth-grader best friends who create the Captain Underpants comic book and hypnotize their strict principal into becoming the superhero — who doesn't actually have superpowers. Kid-friendly without being too mind-numbing to their parents, Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie has \"charm to spare,\" praises EW's critic, noting it works \"mostly because it never tries to be more or less than what it is.\" It also spawned a series on Netflix, The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants, which ran from 2018 to 2020. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: David Soren\n\nCast: Kevin Hart, Ed Helms, Nick Kroll, Thomas Middleditch, Jordan Peele, Kristen Schaal\n\n04 of 20\n\nGuillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)\n\nCodirectors Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson transport the classic story of Pinocchio to World War II-era Italy in this meticulously crafted stop-motion animated film. Following the death of his young son, carpenter Geppetto cuts down a tree and carves a wooden boy, who is subsequently brought to life and dubbed Pinocchio. As the boy ventures to the outside world, he is met with dark forces that attempt to use and corrupt him, all against the backdrop of Benito Mussolini's reign as leader of Fascist Italy. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is a darker take on the tale compared to the well-known Disney adaptation (which also received a far-inferior live-action remake in 2022). From the fraught setting to the detailed creature designs, del Toro and Gustafson create a distinct world while providing valuable life lessons to viewers of all ages. The film became the first Netflix production to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio: Netflix\n\nDirectors: Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson\n\nCast: Ewan McGregor, David Bradley, Gregory Mann, Burn Gorman, Ron Perlman, John Turturro, Finn Wolfhard, Cate Blanchett, Tim Blake Nelson, Christoph Waltz, Tilda Swinton\n\n05 of 20\n\nI Lost My Body (2019)\n\nA severed hand goes on a perilous journey to reunite with its owner in this French animated drama. When we're not following the hand's quest, we get to know its owner, Naoufel, who accidentally caused his parents' death and now lives with his uncle in Paris. Working as a pizza delivery driver, Naoufel is also hopelessly infatuated with Gabrielle, a librarian. We ultimately come to learn the series of events that led Naoufel's hand to be severed. I Lost My Body was a huge critical success when it was released in 2019, winning a prize at the Cannes Film Festival and earning an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature. Its eccentric story combined with its striking 2-D animation make for an unforgettable experience. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch I Lost My Body: Netflix\n\nDirector: Jérémy Clapin\n\nCast: Hakim Faris, Victoire du Bois, Patrick d'Assumçao\n\n06 of 20\n\nKlaus (2019)\n\nRegardless of whether or not 'tis the season, Klaus is a Santa Claus origin story that's enjoyable any time of the year. Starring J.K. Simmons as the film's eponymous hero, Klaus tells the tale of a widowed Norwegian lumberman who is recruited by the town's new postman Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) to make toys for him to deliver in an effort to prove his father, the postmaster general, wrong. But, when Klaus' toys begin to cheer up the children of Smeerensburg — a town whose inhabitants are perpetually engaged in a feud between two familial clans — Jesper and Klaus must step out of their comfort zones to help save the town from itself. Klaus isn't just another feel-good film; it's also a film that looks great. Employing unique technology to transform 2-D animation into what looks like 3-D, the film is well-deserving of its Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature (the first of Netflix's original animated features to receive that distinction). —Ilana Gordon\n\nWhere to watch Klaus: Netflix\n\nDirector: Sergio Pablos\n\nCast: Jason Schwartzman, J.K. Simmons, Rashida Jones, Will Sasso, Neda Margrethe Labba, Sergio Pablos, Norm Macdonald, Joan Cusack\n\n07 of 20\n\nThe LEGO Movie (2014)\n\nA movie based on LEGO bricks could've been a soulless cash grab, but this vibrant animated film is instead an imaginative adventure comedy about finding one's purpose. Set in the LEGO universe, Emmet (Chris Pratt) is an eager construction worker whose simple life is disrupted upon discovering a \"Piece of Resistance,\" an item that would help prevent an evil businessman from gluing their world together. \"It may be a helter-skelter kiddie adventure built out of plastic toy components,\" writes EW's critic, \"but it’s fast and original, it’s conceptually audacious, it’s visually astonishing, and it’s 10 times more clever and smart and funny than it needed to be.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The LEGO Movie: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Phil Lord and Christopher Miller\n\nCast: Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Nick Offerman, Morgan Freeman\n\n08 of 20\n\nThe LEGO Batman Movie (2017)\n\nIs this animated comedy the ultimate Batman movie? That's up for debate, but the writers behind The LEGO Batman Movie were clearly well-versed in the lore of the Caped Crusader, delighting casual and superfans alike. Set in the LEGO multiverse, the film follows gravelly voiced Batman (Will Arnett) as he goes on a mission to steal a projector that would allow him to exile his famous foes — most notably the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) to the Phantom Zone. But, as it turns out, this is exactly what the Joker wanted, leading to an all-out war. With a delightful sense of humor and brilliantly realized world-building, The LEGO Batman Movie \"avoids the trap of being just another cynical, watered-down retread,\" writes EW's critic. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The LEGO Batman Movie: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Chris McKay\n\nCast: Will Arnett, Zach Galifianakis, Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, Ralph Fiennes\n\n09 of 20\n\nLeo (2023)\n\nProduced by Adam Sandler's company Happy Madison, this playful comedy centers on a 74-year-old tuatara named Leo (voiced by Sandler). Serving as a class pet over several decades, Leo panics upon learning his lifespan may be coming to an end. Multiple students bring him home during the school year, with Leo imparting his decades of wisdom upon them to help with each of their individual needs. Perfectly attuned to today's anxiety-riddled youth, Leo is a well-observed charmer about how everyone is going through something. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Leo: Netflix\n\nDirectors: Robert Marianetti, Robert Smigel, David Wachtenheim\n\nCast: Adam Sandler, Bill Burr, Cecily Strong, Jason Alexander\n\n10 of 20\n\nThe Mitchells vs. the Machines (2021)\n\nEvery family has problems, but the Mitchell family has big problems — robot apocalypse-type problems. In this animated comedy, a dysfunctional family's already messy road trip is thrown into further chaos when robots attempt to take over the world. As the only people left to fight them off, it's up to the Mitchells (voiced by Abbi Jacobson, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, and director Mike Rianda) to take out the machines and save humanity. But, to do that, they'll have to ensure their family's connection to each other is stronger than their connection to their phones and iPads. In an ironic twist, The Mitchells vs. the Machines — whose message warns of the dangers of relying too much on technology — employs both hand-drawn and CGI animation to create its visuals. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Mitchells vs. the Machines: Netflix\n\nDirector: Mike Rianda\n\nCast: Abbi Jacobson, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Mike Rianda, Eric André, Olivia Colman\n\n11 of 20\n\nNimona (2023)\n\nBlending medieval folklore and futuristic fantasy, this high-spirited, Oscar-nominated adaptation of the 2015 graphic novel is more timely now than ever. Chloë Grace Moretz gives voice to Nimona, a mischievous shapeshifter who comes to the aid of Ballister Boldheart (Riz Ahmed), a knight who has since been ostracized by the kingdom due to his background as a commoner. Naturally, Nimona has her own history with being outcast, and the pair unravel a conspiracy that resulted in the queen's death. Featuring a powerful queer allegory, both Nimona and Ballister try to overcome prejudice from their community while forging a bond due to their circumstances. As EW's critic writes, \"The story admiringly delves into how such monsters are in fact created by a society that refuses to accept their differences.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Nimona: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Nick Bruno and Troy Quane\n\nCast: Chloë Grace Moretz, Riz Ahmed, Eugene Lee Yang, Frances Conroy, Lorraine Toussaint, Beck Bennett, RuPaul, Indya Moore, Julio Torres, Sarah Sherman\n\n12 of 20\n\nOrion and the Dark (2024)\n\nBased on the 2014 children's book of the same name by Emma Yarlett, Orion and the Dark is an inventive exploration of what it means to face your fears. Adapted by surrealist extraordinaire Charlie Kaufman, the film follows 11-year-old Orion (Jacob Tremblay), who suffers from debilitating fears. One night, the power goes out, and the personification of the dark (Paul Walter Hauser) arrives to take him on a journey that will help quell his anxieties. Along the way, he meets other personified nighttime beings such as Sleep and Unexpected Noises, coming to understand their functions. As the film goes on, however (and as adult viewers have come to expect from Kaufman), it becomes clear that there are many layers to this story. Beneath the colorful animation and lively voice performances, Orion and the Dark offers a thought-provoking message for all ages. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Orion and the Dark: Netflix\n\nDirector: Sean Charmatz\n\nCast: Jacob Tremblay, Paul Walter Hauser, Colin Hanks, Angela Bassett, Ike Barinholtz, Natasia Demetriou, Golda Rosheuvel, Nat Faxon, Aparna Nancherla, Carla Gugino\n\n13 of 20\n\nOver the Moon (2020)\n\nNetflix's original animated feature, Over the Moon is one of the platform's most stunning visual works of art. Directed by Oscar-winner Glen Keane (the Disney animator behind The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast), this vibrant film tells the story of Fei Fei (Cathy Ang), a young Chinese girl mourning the death of her mother. A passionate scientist, Fei Fei finds solace in a story her parents told her about Chang'e (Phillipa Soo) — a goddess who lives on the moon — and decides to build a rocket ship so she can visit her. A vibrant exploration of Chinese culture, grief, and believing in the face of adversity, the film features gorgeous animated sequences, memorable songs, and the voices of John Cho, Ken Jeong, and Sandra Oh. An ambitious feature lovingly crafted by a pedigreed production team, Over the Moon is a family film that will haunt you long after the credits have rolled. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Over the Moon: Netflix\n\nDirector: Glen Keane\n\nCast: Cathy Ang, Phillipa Soo, Ken Jeong, John Cho, Ruthie Ann Miles, Margaret Cho, Sandra Oh\n\n14 of 20\n\nRango (2011)\n\nThere's a new sheriff in town, and his name is Rango. Gore Verbinski's first — and, thus far, only — venture into animation has more in common with the spaghetti Westerns of yesteryear than your average animated film. Johnny Depp voices the title character, a chameleon who comes upon a desert town and is soon appointed to law enforcement. As the town suffers through a brutal drought, Rango is tasked with investigating what happened to their water supply, stumbling into trouble along the way. Rango evokes familiar imagery for Western fans, with homages to classics such as A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). The climax of the film takes direct inspiration from 1952's High Noon. While adults may appreciate the film's sly humor more than kids, EW's critic writes, \"there's no denying the intrigue in its combination of the good, the bad, and the ugly.\" (Yes. Rango tips a cowboy hat to that 1966 classic, too.) —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Rango: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gore Verbinski\n\nCast: Johnny Depp, Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin, Ned Beatty, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Harry Dean Stanton, Ray Winstone, Timothy Olyphant\n\n15 of 20\n\nThe Sea Beast (2022)\n\nA brave orphan girl named Maisie stows away aboard a ship of sea monster hunters in The Sea Beast, helmed by Big Hero 6's co-director Chris Williams. The sailors are renowned for their hunting abilities, though their status is threatened by their society's admiral, who wishes to replace them. They go out on one last hunt to track down a powerful sea beast called the Red Bluster, but, as Maisie soon discovers, the creatures may not have the kind of malicious intent for which they've come to be known. With dazzling colors, fast-paced thrills, and classical storytelling, it's easy to see why The Sea Beast became Netflix's most watched animated original film as of October 2022, according to the streamer. The film also earned a Best Animated Feature nomination at the Oscars, following a wave of critical praise. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Sea Beast: Netflix\n\nDirector: Chris Williams\n\nCast: Karl Urban, Zaris-Angel Hator, Jared Harris, Marianne Jean-Baptiste\n\n16 of 20\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023)\n\nFollowing up on the massive success of the Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) was a huge responsibility, but this dazzling sequel was well worth the five-year wait. Across the Spider-Verse finds Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) adjusting to the struggles of life as Spider-Man, while Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) deals with the unique situation of her father hunting down her alter ego, Spider-Woman, not knowing she's her. Both heroes soon join a team looking to defeat a particularly slippery villain known as the Spot (Jason Schwartzman), who is quickly traveling through the multiverse on a path of destruction. Featuring even more eye-popping visuals than its predecessor, Across the Spider-Verse is an animation geek's dream, As EW's critic describes, \"Gwen's homeworld is painted almost entirely with the neon pinks and greens of the Spider-Gwen comics she hails from, while Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya) ripples with the loud fonts and cut-up collages of 1970s anarchist zines.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K.

Movie (2023)\n\nIf it weren't for a little event called Barbenheimer, the smashing success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie would have been the box office story of 2023. Grossing a whopping $1.36 billion worldwide, this animated adaptation of the iconic Nintendo video game empire provides an origin story for Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day), a pair of brothers with a plumbing business who find their lives turned upside down after a pipe transports them to a colorful fantasy land. There, they attempt to ward off the villainous Bowser (Jack Black) as he vies for the love of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), who, at least in this adaptation, is far from a damsel in distress. As EW's critic sums it up, \"It's all quite fun, with a good sense of humor and a consistent computer-animated aesthetic — plus, at 90 minutes including credits, it's short, sweet, and over before anything can get annoying.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch The Super Mario Bros.

Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake voice Princess Poppy and Branch, respectively, a pair of trolls who fight to save their community from the predatory Bergens. Along the way, we get a bevy of pop-flavored musical performances of such classics as \"I'm Coming Out,\" \"True Colors,\" and \"September.\" Timberlake also co-penned and performed the original song \"Can't Stop the Feeling,\" which won a Grammy and earned an Oscar nomination. At a time when films based on previously established brands were commonplace, Trolls exceeded expectations with its sweet and earnest storytelling. While not for the cynically minded, the film resonated with families upon its release in 2016, spawning TV specials, animated series, and two feature film sequels, 2020's Trolls World Tour and 2023's Trolls Band Together. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Trolls: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Mike Mitchell\n\nCast: Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Zooey Deschanel, Russell Brand, James Corden, Gwen Stefani\n\n19 of 20\n\nVivo (2021)\n\nViva la Vivo! Lin-Manuel Miranda partnered with Netflix for this computer-animated original that starts in Havana and ends in Miami, with stops in Key West and the Everglades along the way. Underscored by Latin beats, propelled by a fast-moving story, and even featuring some rapping, Vivo is a buoyant celebration of Caribbean culture. Miranda stars as Vivo, a kinkajou living in Havana as one half of a street-performing act. When his partner Andrés (voiced by Juan de Marcos González) passes away, Vivo resolves to deliver a song Andrés wrote for his long lost love Marta (Gloria Estefan), who is about to perform her retirement show in Miami. Aided by Andrés' great-niece Gabi (Ynairaly Simo), Vivo hits all the wrong notes in his quest to keep love alive, but his journey is a delight to watch. Musically, Vivo combines mambo, hip-hop, and EDM, and, while it's not Miranda's best-known work, earworms like \"My Own Drum\" are sure to lodge themselves deep into your subconscious. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Vivo: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Kirk DeMicco\n\nCast: Lin-Manuel Miranda, Zoe Saldaña, Juan de Marcos, Brian Tyree Henry, Michael Rooker, Nicole Byer, Ynairaly Simo, Gloria Estefan\n\n20 of 20\n\nA Whisker Away (2020)\n\nWho among us hasn't pretended to be something we're not, to attract the attention of a crush? In the 2020 Japanese anime film A Whisker Away, a middle-school girl named Miyo struggles with unrequited love as she yearns for her classmate, Kento, who continues to reject her romantic advances. Upon receiving a magical mask capable of turning her into a cat, Miyo is able to spend time with Kento without fear of rejection — but it's a risky proposition, as one day, the transformation could become permanent. The film's Japanese title, which literally translates to Wanting to Cry, I Pretend to be a Cat, tells you all you need to know about the simplicity and heart of the narrative. Packed with sumptuous visuals and a universally relatable core, this winsome coming-of-age story is intended for teens and young adults, but is also a must-see for anime enthusiasts, magical realism fans, and those looking to have their faith in love renewed. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch A Whisker Away: Netflix\n\nDirectors: Junichi Sato and Tomotaka Shibayama\n\nCast: Mirai Shida, Natsuki Hanae, Hiroaki Ogi"
