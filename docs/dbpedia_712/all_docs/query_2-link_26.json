I know itâ€™s taken me a while to review these films, but Iâ€™m glad to have seen them at last. Continue reading â†’\n\nQuick DVD Review â€“ â€˜Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chaseâ€™\n\nHello everyone! ðŸ™‚\n\nWelcome to â€˜Bradleyâ€™s Basementâ€™ blog and Iâ€™m Tim Bradley!\n\nUsually, Iâ€™d purchase a â€˜Tom and Jerryâ€™ film when spending a weekend attending a convention somewhere. When I was in Plymouth earlier this month, I purchased the â€˜Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chaseâ€™ DVD. This is a nice change to check out a â€˜Scooby-Dooâ€™ film instead of a â€˜Tom and Jerryâ€™ film. Continue reading â†’\n\nMovie Review â€“ â€˜Space Jam: A New Legacyâ€™\n\nSPOILERS ALERT!!!\n\nHello everyone! ðŸ™‚\n\nWelcome to â€˜Bradleyâ€™s Basementâ€™ blog and Iâ€™m Tim Bradley!\n\nIâ€™ve had my second cinema experience this year! Last weekend, I saw the movie â€˜Space Jam: A New Legacyâ€™, the sequel to the 1996 film â€˜Space Jamâ€™ which I saw recently on Google Play. I had a great time watching this â€˜Space Jamâ€™ sequel, as it contains a lot of fun and a lot of Warner Bros. references Continue reading â†’\n\nMovie Review â€“ â€˜Scoob!â€™\n\nHello everyone! ðŸ™‚\n\nWelcome to â€˜Bradleyâ€™s Basementâ€™ and Iâ€™m Tim Bradley!\n\nIâ€™ve seen another film on our home computer! Iâ€™ve recently seen â€˜Scoob!â€™ This is the latest â€˜Scooby-Dooâ€™ movie that was meant to be released at cinemas but itâ€™s been released via video on demand due to the coronavirus pandemic â€“ please keep safe. I thought Iâ€™d skip this one, but Iâ€™ve now seen it. Continue reading â†’\n\nQuick DVD Review â€“ â€˜Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Boldâ€™\n\nHello everyone! ðŸ™‚\n\nWelcome to â€˜Bradleyâ€™s Basementâ€™ blog and Iâ€™m Tim Bradley!\n\nLast week, I posted a review on the â€˜Scooby-Doo Meets Batmanâ€™ DVD to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Scooby-Doo. In a way, Iâ€™m glad I did that since I reviewed the two cartoon films from the DVD release. But as theyâ€™re also included in the â€˜Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Boldâ€™ DVD, should I have bothered? For all I know, I might give the â€˜Scooby-Doo Meets Batmanâ€™ DVD away.
