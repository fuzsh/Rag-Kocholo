        "text": "Hello MetroFamily readers! I am very excited to bring you this new blog, dedicated to helping families find the best things to do around the OKC metro (and beyond!), plus cool places to go with your family and lots of fun (and free!) events going on around town.\n\nFor my work at MetroFamily (I have been the magazine's Assistant Editor for almost three years, and currently dish up all our website content and social media posts), I am constantly exposed to the dozens of great events that take place in the metro each week. It is both exciting and overwhelming—so many places to go and things to do! I hope this blog will help you pick and choose some great opportunities for fun for your family.\n\nAs a Norman-ite, this week's post is all about a gem of a museum right in my backyard. The Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art is one of the finest University-based art museums in the nation and they do a fantastic job offering programming for families that is as educational as it is fun.\n\nCurrently, the museum is featuring a particularly family-friendly exhibit—especially if your family happens to consist of anyone who loves princesses, Mickey Mouse or just about anything Disney. Sound like anyone you might know? If so, read on!\n\nA Century of Magic: The Animation of Walt Disney Studios runs through September. 2, 2012 and features more than 80 animation cels used in the original production of many of Disney's most popular animated films. The exhibit not only kid-friendly in theme—it is also kid-friendly in design. The animation cels are all hung at \"kid eye level\" so you are not constantly having to remove kids from their strollers or pick them up to appreciate the displays. My kids (ages 3 and 6) had a great time moving through the exhibit identifying the movies that they recognized—and there were plenty of our favorites represented (Snow White, Aladdin, Lion King, Little Mermaid, Lady & the Tramp and more). An added bonus was that it brought out some Disney films that we had not watched (including Hercules, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and others) that we were able to add to our family movie night queue.\n\nWant to go check out this exhibit? Here's what you need to know:\n\nWhere to go:\n\nFred Jones Jr. Muem of Art on the University of Oklahoma campus\n\n555 Elm Avenue, Norman\n\n(405) 325-3272, www.ou.edu/fjjma\n\nAdmission is $5 for adults, $3 for childen ages 6-17, and free for kids under 6.\n\nWhen to go:\n\nOpen Tuesday-Thursday (10am-5pm); Friday (10am-9pm); Saturday (10am-5pm); Sunday (1-5pm)\n\nHow to save:\n\nAdmission is free for everyone each Tuesday.\n\nSave $1 on admission with our Kids Pass coupon.\n\nThis Weekend:\n\nTwo special events taking place this weekend involving the Fred Jones—\n\nSaturday, May 19, 10:30am-12:30pm.—FREE Screening of Beauty & The Beast in the museum's auditorium.
