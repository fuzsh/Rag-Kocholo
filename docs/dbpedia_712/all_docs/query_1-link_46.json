        "text": "Authors: Jeff Kurtti\n\nPublication Date: 2000\n\nPublisher: Disney Editions\n\nPages: 130 pages\n\nHello everyone, and welcome back for another book review! Back when I was doing my Disney canon reviews, some of you will remember me working through the big, fancy Hyperion art books alongside them, and since then I’ve also looked at a few other books devoted to some of Disney’s pre-renaissance films. Now, it’s time to cast our eyes over some of the more recent art books to come out of Disney, beginning in the early 2000s – since then, almost every Disney film has had one to accompany it, but I must admit that I don’t own them all. I have nine in my collection, so of course those are the only ones I’ll be discussing, but I’ll still point out the existence of any others for collectors.\n\nFollowing Fantasia 2000, Dinosaur continued the line with its own companion book, written by Jeff Kurtti. Although not as physically luxurious as the nineties volumes preceding it, this is still a striking book – large and square, it features an angry carnotaur glaring out at you from the cover and is attractively designed within, with lots of high-quality images and handy info boxes all printed on thick, sturdy paper. Kurtti’s books are always well-written, engrossing and thorough and this one is no exception – the story of the production is beautifully presented. (I know some might consider this a waste given how unpopular this film is, but I’m in the minority of Disney fans who actually has a fondness for Dinosaur).\n\nThe book opens with a foreword from Peter Schneider, then the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, after which the rest is divided into five sections. “Part One, The Birth of a Notion: The ‘Prehistoric’ Dinosaur” details the long gestation period the film underwent, beginning – of all places – on the set of RoboCop in 1987. According to this, the film was originally planned to be a stop-motion, silent epic involving special effects maven Phil Tippett, but budgetary and technological restrictions sent it into “development hell” by 1990.\n\n“Part Two, Countdown to Extinction: Finding a Film” tells us of the improvements in technology that allowed them to finally begin making the film, around 1995, while also providing a few notes on some earlier, dinosaur-themed films from Disney. Then, in “Part Three, Cretaceous Creation: The Making of the Movie,” we get an account of how the key people got involved with the project and how the story came to be. The section also discusses the many real-world location shoots the team went on to get the background shots for this complicated film, from America and Australia to Venezuela, Jordan and Western Samoa. Finally, Kurtti explains how the live-action and animated elements were woven together.\n\n“Part Four, Prehistoric Parable: The Story and Characters” talks about the alterations made to palaeontological accuracy for the sake of the character designs, and also discusses Disney’s earliest foray into computer-animated characters (the studio had mainly used the tech for special effects in hand-drawn films up to that point, with a few exceptions). It also breaks down the individual characters’ personalities and the casting behind them (much of which was down to Thomas Schumacher).\n\nFinally, “Part Five, Creative Consequences: What Hath Dinosaur Wrought?” covers the finishing touches (such as the lighting and special effects) and the conclusion of the nearly five-year production, ending on an optimistic note about Disney’s future with computer animation. We then get the usual page of acknowledgments, along with a pull-out poster featuring the moment Aladar faces off with a carnotaur in the climax, and the film credits.\n\nNow, I know this film is nobody’s favourite, but I really would recommend giving this book a chance if you’re a Disney fan. If for no other reason, it’s a genuinely well-made companion book with a decent mixture of information and artwork, and who knows – perhaps you’ll find the story of the film’s creation more interesting than the film itself! If you’re one of the few people out there who doesn’t hate Dinosaur, then you should definitely check it out – Kurtti’s work deserves a place in any collection.\n\nThank you so much for reading – I hope you’ll be back soon for further book reviews. The Emperor’s New Groove didn’t get a making-of book devoted to it, no doubt due to its notoriously turbulent production, but from then on, every film except the equally-troubled Home on the Range has had some sort of companion piece (even if some of them weren’t strictly “art” books). The next book review will therefore be on Atlantis: The Lost Empire, but we won’t be getting to that for a few weeks yet – next time, we’ll be diving into the gorgeous world of Finding Nemo, so keep your eyes peeled! Until next time, take care and staaay animated!"
