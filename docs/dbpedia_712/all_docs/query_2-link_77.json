        "text": "BIG SHOUT TO KE HUY QUAN for WINNING a GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR IN A MOTION PICTURE. As the founder of MyFutprint Entertainment, LLC - I started SATURDAY AM brand to highlight and showcase diversity in manga. As a kid, I (like so many kids) was SO jealous of Ke Huy Quan - he was the funny, cool action hero kid that got to pal around with Indiana Jones. It was like being Robin to Batman! And as a young BLACK kid, I remember Mr. Quan being Asian meant that I may get to do that too since most movies then didn't highlight kids of color in leading roles. ALL KIDS want to be the HERO. ALL KIDS want to be the LOVE INTEREST. ALL KIDS want to live their DREAMS. His disappearance in films was notable. I often wondered what happened to him. But I already knew. As POC rarely get those opportunities to have range. If you were Asian in the 80's you were nerdy smart or you were a martial artist, you were submissive or you were a sidekick. And if you were black -- you were sexless, smart, a nerd -- non-threatening -- never the lead unless you were a comedian and if not those -- you were the bad guy (i.e. never the mastermind mind you, just the muscle). And it was similar for most other ethnicities. To see his comeback is SO SOO SOOOOO EMOTIONAL for many of us from the 80's because we not only know what it's like to have our dreams deferred but of what it's like to nearly give up hope that your dreams will ever happen before you die. Mr. Quan is a few years older than me -- and I KNOW how mortality and loss drives me even more now. By the way, his being cast in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Goonies -- had a major time bomb embedded within. Y'see when you have diverse characters -- they have an effect on the hearts of young people who are able relate to people of all backgrounds. They grow up to have more diverse friends, actively stand up to racism, and they become allies in creating a more perfect union (i.e. hiring, helping change toxic norms...etc). The directors of his award winning film -- cast him when he had barely worked for nearly 30 years--BECAUSE they remember how great he was decades before. If you've not seen his EXCELLENT ACCEPTANCE SPEECH from the Golden Globes 2023 then I highly recommend you watch it. Also, watch his EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE, ALL AT ONCE (for which he won best actor) and look forward to the upcoming live action adaptation of the excellent Gene Luen Yang graphic novel, AMERICAN BORN CHINESE. And who knows??? Maybe one day, we'll be LUCKY enough to have him in a role in an adaptation of one of our diverse manga titles. NEVER GIVE UP HOPE FOLKS! And DIVERSITY MATTERS -- IT ALWAYS MATTERS!"
