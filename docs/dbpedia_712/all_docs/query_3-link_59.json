        "text": "Do you like mysteries? Do you like it when high school kids solve those mysteries with a canine companion? Well, I have good news and bad news. The good news is there’s a new Scooby-Doo movie being made and it will be titled Scoob. The bad news is they’re casting people in their 30s to play “those meddling kids.” However, they’re only doing the voices for the characters so… it doesn’t really matter how old they are…\n\nDeadline is reporting that Zac Efron will provide the voice for the Scooby Gang’s leader, Fred Jones. Daphne will be played by Amanda Seyfried. Efron was recently in The Greatest Showman while Seyfried’s last big film was Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.\n\nIt had already been announced that Will Forte is voicing Shaggy with Gina Rodriguez bringing Velma’s voice to the big screen. Voice acting legend Frank Welker will voice the title Character.\n\nRELATED: Voice Cast for Scooby-Doo Animated Film\n\nIn this new take on Scooby, he and his pals will take on the evil Dick Dastardly with the help from past Hannah-Barbera characters such as Captain Caveman, who will be voiced by Tracey Morgan. The movie is set to be directed by Tony Cervone who has directed animated shows like Duck Dodgers, Tom and Jerry Tales, and Back at the Barnyard. He has also directed two Scooby-Doo animated movies: Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo and Scooby-Doo! and Kiss: Rock and Roll Mystery.\n\nI am not sure how well this movie will do, but I really wish we had been able to see James Gunn’s original take on the live action movie. I think it would be more popular to aim this at adults instead of kids. not in a Deadpool way, but more like The Simpsons Movie.\n\nWhat do you think about the casting?
