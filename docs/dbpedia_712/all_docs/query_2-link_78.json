        "text": "In recent years Scooby-Doo has starred in many crossover movies, and this is often called “The Guest Era.” This is another DC crossover in his (as of writing) most recent movie.\n\nThis film was (While incomplete) leaked onto Internet Archives months before its release. Everybody at the time was saying it was from around 2013 based on the logo, and I knew from looking at it that was false. Not to mention I did skim to Velma, and I knew that was not Mindy Cohn’s voice. Another rumor is that saved it from being written off as a tax write off, but I also hear that is false.\n\nRobert Kral does the music. He also did Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, Superman Doomsday (they reuse some music from it), and several other DC movies I have reviewed. Unfortunately it has the same director as Return to Zombie Island, but hopefully she redeems herself here.\n\nThe Justice League is mysteriously gone, phantoms have taken over The Hall of Justice, and Metropolis is overrun with supervillains, thus Mystery Inc is on the case.\n\nA few red herrings are introduced, and I like that the valet loves The Mystery Machine due to it being a normal van.\n\nI love little details on how superheroes affect the normal guy, and for him it means he thinks normal vehicles are special.\n\nMayor Fleming is trying to bring to keep The Hall of Justice from being bulldozed. She is there to move us from point A to point B, but I did spend a while wondering if she was a twist villain.\n\nHere we get Lex Luthor, Rex Ruthor, and Mercy Graves. It is hard to tell if former president Luthor is actually smart or dumb for most of the movie. Rex Ruthor (I love how they somehow keep it ambiguous until the credits if that is his name or if it is Rex Luthor) is just his friend or so it seems. Mercy is overworked and apparently is no longer grateful for what Lex did for her. By keeping all the key details about these three a mystery until the end the movie is really about figuring them out. Are they comedic villains or just pretending to be. Is this Scooby-Doo stuck inside of Justice League or Justice League trapped in Scooby-Doo? I am glad they limited themselves to one Trump Joke. Contrary to what the memes say Trump and Lex are very different. I think this version of Lex is an attack on the DCEU version, but I am not sure. He has many references to his Gene Hackman version.\n\nKrypto saves them from the phantom, and issues a lockdown when every civilian is out of the building except for Lex Luthor and Rex Ruthor, as Lex got lost (a running gag). It is a good scene except Velma says Krypto looks like a stray. That white fur is way too clean for him to be a stray. Krypto is Superman’s dog and trying to get him back.\n\nIt took me a second watch to realize why I was enjoying the Fred and Daphne plot. When they were nine at a Summer camp Daphne and Jimmy Olsen were voted “best redhead couple,” and Jimmy has been saying Daphne is his girlfriend ever since. This does not exactly make Fred happy, so he tries to prove his manliness to Daphne. It took me a while to realize why this was my favorite plot of the movie. They are not fighting; they are playing. They keep laughing and smiling at each other as they exaggerate their issues showing they are play fighting. It is something I do not recall Scooby-Doo ever doing. The rest of the movie is wacky comedy, and they stick out by doing more grounded comedy amidst all the wackiness. It ends with Jimmy breaking up with Daphne, and then Fred and Daphne reverse roles.\n\nThey see a recording of Superman disappearing, and between that and the following Grundy chase I was able to figure out the mystery at around the 2/3rd mark. Superman seems to just vanish after being hit by a light, and the villains are called “Phantoms.” The Justice League is in the Phantom Zone, and the phantoms are them. Mercy is carrying around The Phantom Zone Projector. Lex is faking stupidity and the ultimate mastermind. I think this would be harder to solve for people that are not Smallville nerds.\n\nThe best part is when they need to make Lex mad. They do this by discussing the plot of the worst Scooby-Doo movie ever. Lex calls it “…The most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard, and I saw Superman the Musical.”\n\nAfter that they trap mercy revealing everything only for Lex to snatch the Phantom Zone projector, release his army of demolition robots, and reveal that Rex Ruthor is a dog version of Metallo (cyborg powered by Kryptonite). Lex claims he planned this whole thing. I do not believe him.\n\nHere comes our final battle. It is the only time I can think of when Daphne’s fighting prowess are important (no, they were not important at all in Samurai Sword. They easily could have been edited out). I presume this is in continuity with the comic book where she filled in for Batgirl and then became Batgal. I remember in my mini review not being impressed with the climax, but I think that is due to how much better the climax of the Batman crossover movie was.\n\nThere are lots of good gags in it, and a role for all 6 main heroes and even two red herrings. It is a solid, but unimpressive ending where Lex is defeated and Rex Ruthor is banished to The Phantom Zone. In the closing action The Justice League is back and Grundy is living the dream of befriending Scooby-Doo.\n\nVery solid movie. Other than Daphne and Fred nothing really sticks out compared to other Scooby-Doo movies (but that take that to Return to Zombie Island was great), but it is funny and a decent mystery. I enjoyed seeing these DC characters trapped in a Scooby-Doo film. Four Tree Stars.\n\nIn one scene Shaggy fires all eleven of Ollie’s trick arrows.\n\nWhat is that supposed to do?\n\nYou do not kill Ollie. How are you supposed to shoot that from an arrow non-lethally?\n\nDid Disney’s Dinosaur really rip-off The Land Before Time?\n\nAs a Scooby-Doo fan I kept hearing about this thing from older videos but never outside of the internet or from new videos and comments. It is a 1999 parody of some horror film that was made for the Scooby-Doo marathon and aired during the commercials in bits and pieces. Apparently it was groundbreaking when it came out, but today it cannot stick out amidst all the made for the internet parodies. Only using the then official actors (Innes, Welker, Ward, and Bergman so the cast of Cyber Chase) makes it stick out.\n\nThis is one of those parodies where the characters are put in a darker setting and out of their element. I much prefer things like Scooby-Doo and Batman the Brave and the Bold where instead they dominate the darker characters. Most parodies like that I enjoy is more about the reactions everyone else has to them. I see a lot of why I do not care for The Scooby-Doo Project is personal taste. That is not even considering that I describe most horror movies as “boring.”\n\nIt begins with The Mystery Machine found abandoned in the woods with nothing but a duffel bag with 24 hours of Scooby-Doo episodes that will be shown in a marathon. It is then revealed to be found footage, as when they looked for a ghost Velma was making a video reference for it. The rest of the gang is normally annoyed at her for it, and all of them (except Daphne) at times hold the camera.\n\nI presume this was the first time many viewers learned Shaggy’s first name is actually “Norville.” I learned that from my brother’s go-gurt packs. They ask live-action people about the ghost, and they are very different and do not match the one that will appear later.\n\nFred somehow cons everybody into camping by the cemetery, and their are some camping jokes. My favorite (and only one I really like) is Velma loses her glasses. Fred takes over the camera work, and he is so mad at having to look for her glasses that he misses the camera was pointing right at them. The one I really have problems with is them complaining about the camera. Cameras can double as flashlights, and it is clearly making light.\n\nAfter this they see the ghost and then each segment develops a formula, they deal with issues from being in the woods and complain about it while slowly getting hungrier and more tired and scared. Again this is very basic parody material in this age of the internet, and I find it underwhelming.\n\nOne confusing gag is that the ghost left stale Scooby-Snax. Why is Shaggy complaining about them being stale. He is normally fine with eating them stale.\n\nMost of the meta jokes are dull to me, but the one I like is about the time. Fred says they normally are done in only 22 minutes (a typical runtime for an episode), but this is taking days, as the viewer is likely seeing it in bits and pieces over a period of days. Velma is upset the ghoul is not respecting their curfew.\n\nWith their map being useless they get lost and Shaggy and Scooby eat the map. This leads to a gag Cartoon Network removed from their airings on their youtube channel, Scrappy’s appearance. This is both a bad gag and a relief. I do not like the Scrappy joke. It is the same thing they have been doing with his limited use in decades, and it feels off, as he is the only one acting truly like his show counterpart. They leave him to die when he goes to heroically save them. Seriously, he sought out and found his missing teammates, and they left him to die at the hands of the monster. Finding them proves that he is the actual best detective.\n\nAfter that they find and go into an abandoned house. When trying to work the radio it plays a chase song. “We always get chased when there’s music.” That was only in season 2, which was only 7 episodes. The ghost then shows up and chases them. In one ending ghost kills them. In other ending it cuts to them capturing and unmasking random guy. Then the real ghost kills them. The police then reveal they are still missing, and they are looking for them.\n\nAfter all this hype I am find this really forgettable (and I have seen this twice in the last few days). I think the Behind the Scenes features are more interesting, and it really is not funny.\n\nThe animation is sometimes from the show, but I think that distracts from their reactions when so many shots are back shots to hide they could not afford to make their mouths move. The Ghost’s design is not interesting (The demon farmer in What’s New Scooby-Doo however shows this ghost farmer look can work). The plot is unfocused, and I think most of the gags are easy to predict.\n\nNext time I am looking into a production theory on Disney’s Beauty and the Beast.\n\nIt has nothing to do with the picture above. I just like it.\n\nThe first movie I have ever reviewed gets a sequel, and this by far the most recent release date I have ever reviewed a movie, as it is just over two months old. I have hardly reviewed anything from this decade. I did not expect a good movie, but I hoped for one. Instead I am remembering the good old days when Arabian Nights was the worst movie I have reviewed, as this movie sadly stinks. The plot is unfocused, the characterizations are downright awful, the humor is mixed, the moral is bad, the story is incomplete and full of retcons. Thankfully the action is pretty good along with the animation.\n\nDespite hating this movie I really like the opening. The art is good and atmospheric for mystery and terror with good images from the first film. Thankfully I see Frank Welker, Matthew Lillard, and Grey DeLisle are back but Mindy Cohn is not Velma anymore. She has been replaced by Kate Micucci, and her voice sounds off. Part of it is the main cast has been the same since 2002 except for Casey Kasem and Lillard alternating for Shaggy until kasem got too old, and I got so used to the old voice. Micucci sounds too young and cheerful too often. The creators are trying for an eccentric Velma, but everyone else does that better.\n\nThe plot starts with with Fred regretting selling the Mystery Machine. Huh? Wikipedia, TV tropes, save me. This is a sequel to Curse of the 13th Ghost too where they sold it. I just lost all suspension of disbelief. This Fred, the version obsessed with his van (like in What’s new Scooby-Doo) sold it?\n\nWhile nonsensical in a nice touch he has a dream about catching various villains from the original series in The Mystery Machine giving some good action. He wakes up in a the malt shop. Meanwhile, Velma is mad nobody in the group reads her blog (relatable) and wants to solve “unsolved capers.” This will be a big problem later.\n\nIn a weird stupid subplot Shaggy and Scooby make the other three promise to not solve any mysteries unless they tell them too for a long vacation.\n\nThis is incredibly Stupid and forced. I presume the creators did not watch the original show where Shaggy and Scooby were also heavily interested in solving mysteries, after all they always stayed with their practically suicidal friends.\n\nSucky Sheriff Bronson Stone tells them to just to be kids and not solve mysteries. They were adults in the first movie! Why make this retcon in a sequel where they were adults. Part of the early movies is they were about holding on to the childlike state of wonder and curiosity despite the cynicism coming from adult life. Now it is impossible to think of the two movies as happening in the same universe.\n\nDiscount Svengooglie wait.. she is a real horror movie host. Elvira appoints a random audience member for a vacation with three friends and a pet. Shaggy wins. The gang does not check this obvious set up due to the promise. I thought the moral would be that sometimes you have to break a poise to do your greater duty, but they are actually presented in the right for doing this even well after Shaggy and Scooby tell them to solve the mystery due to the zombie attacks. The promise subplot is just a stupid subplot to pad the runtime and nothing else. In the meantime they go to Louisiana not knowing it is Louisiana thinking it is Hawaii with oddly fake looking trees. How did Velma fail geography? The mosquitoes alone should reveal it as Louisiana. Fred keeps seeing the Mystery Machine and does not check due to the stupid promise.\n\nTwo greeters tell them “Get Out” like the first movie’s warning. We never see these two and the captain again until it is revealed they are the villains. Weak, weak, weak, twist. I have seen several Scooby-Doo movies and every other one used their longer run time to establish multiple suspects and actually show some character for them. Sometimes a helper was that unimportant but not the main villain.\n\nTo get some sense of plot going a cat creature claws a plastic palm tree nearly killing them. It is way more cat like than the last movie giving some needed differentiation. There is then a surprisingly good scene showing mysterious and fake parts of the island which is clearly Moonscar Island to everyone.\n\nThe hotel manager, Alan, has placed cameras everywhere, there are plastic palm trees, a few other small things, and the guest book has missing pieces. Wait. why would there have even been a guest book from the last visit when it was not a hotel? Then again this is a world with a haunted bone. Then Shaggy and Scooby say not to investigate in spite of their own love of mystery solving and danger to their lives. They even saw the cat creature and do not care.\n\nIn a recap of the first movie they say Daphne worked at tv show for a Summer, not years. Stop with the retcons. Velma mentions the villains, a very minor character, but not her crush from the first movie. Even worse they now call the “cat creatures” “cat people.” Ironically these cat creatures/people are more creature like and less people like.\n\nShaggy and Scooby are chased by zombies who look like living swamps instead of people. They beg the others to solve it, but they refuse and then we get to the part that really made my head hurt. Velma says “As a woman of Science I know there is no such thing as ‘zombies.'”\n\nScience is what you can observe.You have seen real zombies. By definition as woman of science you then believe in zombies. In fact since the creators confirmed this is in canon with he first four movies you have been rescued by zombies, attacked by cat creatures, used voodoo to battle the cat creatures, helped rescue real aliens, been attacked by a sentient computer virus and unknowingly helped an evil version of Nathaniel Hawthorne raise a witch who made hordes of things turn into monsters including that awesome turkey. This is an unintentional parody about how contradictory and and dumb militant skepticism is.\n\nContrary to what many remember Velma was not skeptical of supernatural in the original series. From episode 3-\n\nVelma (scared): There is a very logical explanation for all this.\n\nShaggy: Quick, tell me.\n\nVelma (scared): The place is haunted.\n\nShaggy: thanks a lot.\n\nOr from “Scooby-Doo meets Batman”\n\nDaphne: Velma, we people know those aren’t real skeletons?\n\nVelma: Right.\n\nDaphne (starts running): But just in case they are.\n\nVelma (running too): Right.\n\nFred: Don’t be silly. Would you just listen…\n\nThe girls grab Fred and cary him away.\n\nFred was the most skeptical in Where are You and Zombie Island. This is typically his role. Velma constantly for the rest of the movie insists that it was never supernatural and just imagination playing tricks. Then explain Witch’s ghosts and Alien invaders. Admittedly even my beloved Mystery Incorporated made this mistake (or did it?)\n\nThe stupid promise is finally ignored, as they wait for the zombies (way more than three or four despite it being four people in costumes) as they take apparently hours to walk around 100 feet. Nothing to compare to that amazing scene in the original film where the camera does a slow 180 degree turn of all the zombies after the lightning bolt strikes the water.\n\nAt least the trap is cool resulting in the actors being unmasked, as Alan is a film director. This some hidden footage movie he was making. The gang agrees to just make the movie with him. They probably want to se if he is breaking any labor laws. A cat creature puts the mansion on fire but the sprinklers put it out. Still some mystery at the halfway mark.\n\nWhile making the film it is revealed Velma nicknamed Moonscar Island “Zombie Island” despite not believing in them. There is some commentary about Hollywood only wanting franchises. It would be fumier if this as that or at least somewhat original.\n\nSkeptic Velma is still annoying. Fred and Daphne are aware she is in denial, but I think it is just set up for another movie that I have no interest in seeing after this, as each movie has to be able to stand alone. Velma trying to solve unsolved mystery arc goes absolutely nowhere, yet she insists they do not change details about the supernatural existing for the movie.\n\nMystery Inc is introduced to a prop Mystery Machine that is a monster truck. I like the new look and scenes. Fred’s stunt double is useless as a character or suspect. He cannot be the villains due to constantly being attacked by all of them, and I only brought him up to explain there possibly being two Freds in some screenshots. t also confused my family who came late and all left early. My six year old cousin only lasted a few minutes.\n\nThere are just too many scenes of them making a movie that are almost all pointless but at least it is way more entertaining than the first half of the movie.\n\n54 of 79 minutes in and real plot finally starts. Cats attack. This is not scary in a cartoon. Neither is seeing our heroes kick and punch cats making them seem heroic. Fred and the stunt double are literally hitting the little guys with shovels. At least Alan is filming and not attacking them.\n\nWe get a very good scene where Alan destroys the ferry so they have to stay to finish the movie. Fred rescues the new Mystery Machine giving a very good chase scene. There is sense of danger, and Alan is more interested in filming than his own safety. It is the best scene. Unfortunately they make it pointless by just leaving the van monster truck for another chase on foot for a few unfunny gags that just make the villains look weak. If you want to cash in on Zombie Island then keep the tone somewhat.\n\nThe first film had an amazing climax. Here we get the cliche of heroes dress like monsters scaring them into confessing and surrendering. It sucks. To make it worse they then say the legend included that cats guard Moonscar’s treasure (no mention of that in either movie before), and find it for a horrible joke. Alan wants out of movie business despite caring for it more than his own life. It is just out of character for more jokes about cash grabs from a cash grab. Then more stupidity as Velma declares the cat creatures from the first one are the same people from this one and the zombies were “swamp gas.” Then motivational music plays, as I just want it to end. Discount Sheriff Mayor Jones shows up angry at them for solving mysteries and saving lives. It was picking up steam only for a terrible ending.\n\nIn a twist it is revealed that the black cat creature is most likely real. I should like the ambiguity on the Cat creature but it comes of as a stupid last second twist to sound smart. Not to mention that thing still has to kill at least one person every year by the rules of the last movie.\n\nThe Sheriff especially sucks and all the side characters suck except Alan who is carrying the movie on his back. The plot is awful, and the main characters are done terribly (Except Fred who is done fine at least with an insignificant arc).\n\nOn the bright side the animation is surprisingly funny, some of the jokes work, and some action scenes are good. It is at least better than The Fox and the Hound 2.\n\nI need to review something with good humor and something for Thanksgiving in just a few days."
