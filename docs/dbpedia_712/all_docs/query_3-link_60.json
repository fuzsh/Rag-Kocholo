        "text": "\"I THINK COOLSVILLE SUCKS!\" ― Fred Jones\n\nThe Leader of Mystery Inc. from Scooby-Doo (more specifically, the grown -up movie version).\n\nThe absolute legend, one of the strongest wrestlers, some think of him as a god who walks the Earth and blesses the ring with the legendary '''Coolsville Triple'''.\n\nThe Mystery Man[edit | edit source]\n\n\"Let's split up, gang...\" ― Fred's catchphrase as a teen\n\nAn avid Mystery Buster from the less-than-glamorous city-county-state of Coolsville, Jones was interested in mysteries from a young age. After he and three (plus one pet) friends solved a local mystery in their town, he decided to formally start a mystery-solving group; he bought and touched up old van already aptly named \"The Mystery Machine\", and decided to go around the country solving mysteries for their high-school summer break. Thus, Mystery Incorporated was born.\n\nHe eventually lent the van to Shaggy when he, a \"horrific demon\" and Daphne went on a journalistic adventure, though he became so disgusted he never took it back. Once their school days were over, Mystery Inc. disbanded, though they occasionally met up (and then accidentally stumbled into mysteries). At first trying to be a mystery novelist, he didn't luck out too much, and sometimes had to live in his van during his slump. He eventually became a producer and cameraman for Daphne's TV show.\n\nIn The Final Rumble[edit | edit source]\n\nTFR/Season 0 (original)[edit | edit source]\n\nFred has heard that weird entities and paranormal apparitions have begun to appear on the ring of the famous The Final Rumble, and has decided to infiltrate as a fighter to determine the source of these sightings and put a stop to them, however, Fred might have gotten a bit too into it...\n\nFred's debut as a wrestler is less than ideal, carrying on his past as a happy-go-lucky gang leader that he had left behind in his younger years, an attitude which he in his current self considers, frankly, that IT SUCKED. He would go on to have a lengthy rivalry against Leon S. Kennedy, to the point the two were starting to get sick of one another.\n\nAfter an epic 40 minutes bout, a strangely sober Leon and an amicably calm Fred end their rivalry and form an eternal friendship, and everything changed from then on, allowing Fred to be his true self.\n\nLeon asks Fred to borrow his van to go see Ada in New York, for a \"Virus\" to infect the Tag Team champions and win the title easy. Fred objects at first, but Leon promises to teach him some cool tricks in his Motorcycle (Which he claims he can't use himself because Claire is on \"those days\" and won't let him), and Fred finally accepts.\n\nTFR/Season 1[edit | edit source]\n\nDespite his dislike for his alcoholism and obsession with Ada, Fred established himself straight away as a key ally to Leon and Team NWF at large, proving himself to be an unstoppable force except to those truly worthy of being champions.\n\nFred appears to be missing his Mystery Machine (apparently now on display at some museum in Burgerland aka America), and instead rides in with Leon in The Misery Machine, which looks like its been burnt the fuck out, and carries a plate saying BOGZBGON.\n\nEpisode 1\n\nWith tensions rising, Team FMS and Team NWF would have their first fight for supremacy, and Fred established himself right away as an ultimate being when it comes to suplexing people; everyone was astounded with his power, and so Wesker devised to have him counted-out as the only way to win.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nDutch tries to set up some kind of his schemes claiming that it was \"for the good of Team NWF\" and \"to have some god damn faith\" but Fred shuts it down before he can get them in more trouble.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nTeaming up with Fred, both try to take the tag division to prove Team NWF has what it takes, and after initially defeating Sminem's team of elite investigators (yet not so much fighters), a deep, dark phantasy defeats them.\n\nEpisode 4\n\nThe Paranormal Patrol once again tries to take on opponents from the opposite team, Vergil now teaming up with a big guy. But once again, they are defeated as well.\n\nEpisode 7\n\nA strange ally of Team FMS shows himself and challenges Fred to a contest of suplexes, something he undoubtedly beats him at.\n\nEpisode 8\n\nWhen the Bogs were at their strongest, Therapist called forth for Leon and Chris to unite against this threat, and successfully manages to unite them with a common goal. Leon would also call his best friend Fred to help them as his power would be needed, and Fred reluctantly accepted under such a dangerous situation. Eventually, the Bogs fell, ending the FMS vs NWF struggle.\n\nTFR/Season 2[edit | edit source]\n\nFred maintains his status as a force to be reckoned with, both as a wrestler and an investigator, as he stays behind to solve any in-ring mystery that may arise in TFR.\n\nEpisode 1\n\nOnce again demonstrates his ring superiority, only going down in the Elimination Chamber through a special move combo by both Goro and Wesker.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nWas tied up by Vorgil & Donte who stole his van in order for them to talk to Leon at the hospital about how they were made.\n\nEpisode 5\n\nAfter Vorgin and Donte are called to a match, they finally untie him. So Fred goes to visit Leon.\n\nEpisode 6\n\nFred is FUCKING PISSED when Vorgil & Donte return and decides to prepare to confront that demon Todd guy himself.\n\nEpisode 7\n\nFred attempts to fight Todd, but his bodyguards block the way. Much as he tries, he's no match for the both of them.\n\nEpisode 8[edit | edit source]\n\nHe doesn't give up, and tries again to defeat Todd's subordinates to no avail. When the two vassals are about to finish him once and for all, he was saved by a sudden appearance of Goro Majima to his rescue, fending off The Order of Todd and making them retreat.\n\nEpisode 9[edit | edit source]\n\nNext week on a meeting room, Commander Erwin has called both Fred and Majima, plus 2 more to announce that they will form part of the Anti-Todd Corps, and announces his plan. Fred thinks the plan SUCKS and Majima calls him a con-man. However, Pegasus appears to praise the plan and remind them that not only will Todd form the Howard Reality if he isn't defeated, but Pegasus himself will send them to the Shadow Realm.\n\nContinuing his speech, Erwin announces that Pegasus has hired the famous group of \"Mystery Men\" to join his forces, not as frontline fighters but as investigators and spies, forming the \"Intelligence Team\" of this operation, they are going to discover the secrets of the Demon King, his demon powers, and his \"servants\". And with that, the meeting ends. Go forth, valiant team of heroes! DEDICATE YOUR HEARTS!\n\nEpisode 10[edit | edit source]\n\nCommander Erwin calls for a general roster meeting after obtaining the Investigation Team's totally legit report that they obviously didn't just copy the info that Vergil announced live on TV and was 100% original research. It appears Todd's army don't just make Todd's ranks, but also grant him his power with his \"Mind-Link\" technique. Erwin develops a plan based on a two-part attack to be executed next week: The team will be divided in two groups; One will defend the Locker―a key tactical position that Todd's forces will no doubt retaliate―and the other will proceed to the frontlines against The Order members. This way, The Demon's strength will be reduced by taking down his minions. And when he's at the lowest they can bring him, a special team shall knock him down. Before that, the team will need to train to be ready for the fight, fighting each other with honor, and with all their might, for the demon will be ruthless and without compassion. The meeting concludes. DEDICATE YOUR HE-\n\nThe meeting is suddenly interrupted by a seething Nero looking for Dante.\n\nFred trains with Majima in preparation.\n\nEpisode 11\n\nThe Demon King Wars begins...\n\nEpisode 12\n\nFred is up against The Janny in the Attack on Todd, and delivers a powerful terminating suplex to him in his head that breaks his connection with Todd, accomplishing his mission.\n\nCommander Erwin had decided to make up for his lack as a leader by pulling one final gamble and potentially sacrificing himself. For the greater good, he liberated and distracted Todd's caged beast, Doomguy, drawing his ire in the process and paying with his life. But in turn, this allowed the Demon King to be defeated by two demonic brothers.\n\nOnce the Demon King is no more and his Demon King Wars were over, the group silently separated.\n\nTFR/Season 3[edit | edit source]\n\nWith Leon out of his coma and recovering steadily, Fred can now wrestle in the ring leisurely again and aim for the titles.\n\nEpisode 0\n\nBefore the Team FMS vs Team NWF rematch, strange alterations to reality started happening, until everything went dark. Upon inspecting everything, they discovered... that they were themselves 20 years younger, and were in the past age of wrestling.\n\nEpisode 1\n\nThe time travelling rival teams now finally have their match, with Team FMS proving that it was the strongest all along.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nListens to Richtofen's dimensional babble conference and tells him that he SUCKS.\n\nEpisode 4[edit | edit source]\n\nAfter the terrible events that befell Majima, he demanded a match against Fred, probably some way to take off his mind from the pain, so Fred put him into physical pain instead by delivering 36 deadly suplexes to him. Apparently, it worked perfectly as Majima wanted.\n\nBattler fought the abomination and won, gaining the The Stone and using it to return everything to how it should be. However, upon returning, Fred noticed that Battler was gone and the stone was on the floor. When trying to pick it up, Richtofen steals it and reveals that the stone must've malfunctioned, and sent 10 people somewhere else, then used the stone himself to leave the universe. Richtofen then teleports himself away, reaffirming Fred's belief that he SUCKED.\n\nEpisode 5\n\nSeeking answers, Fred tried to talk to the other Richtofen guy under the common ground that they both think the original SUCKED, but didn't get anything useful.\n\nEpisode 6\n\nBests 3 jobbers and becomes the next in line for Pardo's King of Jobbers belt.\n\nEpisode 8\n\nGot a preview of what was coming for him.\n\nEpisode 9\n\nWhen Leon returned, he INSISTED on going to celebrate drinking, much to Fred's worry. But he already had his plate full, as Pardo called out all his \"crimes\" against Coolsville when they called him the \"Coolsville Mutilator\" of the indie circuit... if it even really happened. Not even Fred's suplexes could pierce Pardo's thick skin, and Pardo made truth on his word.\n\nTFR/Season 4[edit | edit source]\n\nSeeing Leon has taken too much to drinking with his experience on the island, Fred tries to save his friend while managing his career.\n\nEpisode 1\n\nLeon takes Fred's Misery Machine and disappears, with Fred hoping from ringside that he shows up. He arrives just before his title match against Manny Pardo, stinking of alcohol and barely able to stand. Somehow Pardo can't read Leon's moves, and Leon wins the King of Jobbers title.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nHe accompanies Leon to celebrate being the new champion, but Leon overdoes it and 14 bottles later falls into a alcohol-induced sleep.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nTired of all this, Fred challenges Leon for a title match to have some sense beat into him, but Leon only agrees if he can beat that Therapist guy. Fred tries assaulting him in an abandoned BCW building, but it didn't work.\n\nEpisode 5\n\nLeon and Fred once again visit a fancy restaurant just to drink apple juice, with Leon lamenting that the belt hasn't caused Ada to call him yet and thinking of painting the chinese flag on it. Fred tries to talk Leon into dropping the strap to someone else, but Leon just says he's not feeling too well for it. Fred thinks that Therapist may be right, when Leon tells him that some \"Alcohol Cole\" guy called and Leon got him a match with Fred in 5 minutes.\n\nEpisode 7\n\nLeon can't take it anymore after losing the title and being forced to quit apple juice, he tells Fred that he SUCKS and steals his Misery Machine.\n\nEpisode 8\n\nFred faces Chris for a title shot and manages to defeat the hulking muscle gorilla and survive his deadly boulder smashes.\n\nEpisode 9\n\nFred invites Therapist to dinner before their match as apology for never believing him, and Fred asks him a favor, to get his car keys regardless of the result of their match. Therapist accepts to have a duel between men, and asks Fred to show him his worth.\n\nEpisode 11\n\nPassing every bar in a 200 mile radius, yet still being seen by every bartender, Fred finally finds Leon on a noon sunlit field laying against a rock. Beligently shouting at Fred to leave him alone since he no longer has the title, Fred only came searching for what once was his friend, and asks for one more match, because he thinks the current him SUCKS. After a heartfelt hug, Leon agrees.\n\nTFR/Season 5[edit | edit source]\n\nHaving reaffirmed his bonds of friendship with Leon, they are back again as a team.\n\nEpisode 1\n\nFred and Leon team up again to try and become the #1 Tag Team contenders once again. Against a team of terrorists and cunning and planning men, they are outmatched.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nTries to learn about dungeon traps.\n\nEpisode 5\n\nOnce again defeated by The Plan.\n\nEpisode 7\n\nIs unluckily the first one in the royal rumble\n\nEpisode 11\n\nWhen the Death Game is broadcast, Fred is one of the wrestlers in Hideo's office demanding answers from him.\n\nEpisode 12\n\nFred was one of the wrestlers sent in the rescue team to the Universe 2K20. But... it was too late.\n\nTFR/Season 6[edit | edit source]\n\nAfter everything that happened, Central decided to form a group that would increase the unity in the locker room, and appointed him as one of it's masters, creating the Order of the Locker Room.\n\nEpisode 1[edit | edit source]\n\nHe is one of the Masters of the Locker Room as it's second lord, serving to keep peace after the tragedy of the death game.\n\nEveryone gathered for a special announcement in the Locker Room as per Grandmaster Central's instruction. He reminds everyone to guard the peace during the royal rumble match, but also leaves Aniki to do a special announcement.\n\nIt's the first time in a while he had to do an announcement, because this was the first time in a while he had the strength to. He had it hard finding the strength to keep going after losing Ricardo, but then he found that even being gone, their friends still give strength to them, to move on, move forward, and carry their will and soul.\n\nAnd for that, they are gonna give their all, so to up the competition, the winner will be appointed as 5th Master of the Locker Room.\n\nRando wins the rumble and is appointed Master of the Locker Room\n\nEpisode 2\n\nAfter hearing Chris came back and that he KO'd Leon, he rushed to the locker room but he was already gone.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nPicks a fight with Chris Redfield for hurting Leon and Ada Wong over events they thought they worked out long ago.\n\nEpisode 4[edit | edit source]\n\nCentral calls an emergency conference after backstage rioters detonate a bomb and set chaos to the arena, while incapacitating several wrestlers. Dante sets to attack the rioters, Fred goes for Leon, Rando stays silent, and Aniki goes to regroup the lost people while also trying to find Van.\n\nIn the infirmary, Fred instructs Leon to head out, and on his way Fred is attacked by Sweet Tooth, but defeats him.\n\nAniki and Fred regroup with a few wrestlers and ask them to search for lost people, then regroup in 30 minutes.\n\n30 minutes later, Aniki and Fred have grouped the vast majority of members the locker room and look for an exit while the earth shakes, when G-Man presents his \"associate\". Delta presents the group with a safe place from the rumbling and the rioters. Fred instantly understands how important Delta's words are even if he doesn't fully understand the situation, and ushers with all his authority for everyone to follow him wherever he goes.\n\nEpisode 5\n\n12 years in the future, Fred sports a more mature look. As a master of the order of the locker room, he still wrestles for The Final Resistance along with Fred.\n\nHe's seen fighting in a casual match.\n\nEpisode 9\n\nDuring the raid on the factory, he is approached by Chris Redfield who confuses him with Ethan Winters and kidnaps him.\n\nEpisode 10\n\nFred was kidnapped by Chris thinking he was Ethan, and so Leon and Rance decide to go to save him.\n\nEpisode 11\n\nRance manages to beat Boomer and keep his title, but Leon fails to Chris' pure strikes and gets his jaw broken, and they are unable to rescue Fred.\n\nEpisode 14\n\nFights Bevi in the Coolsville Arena.\n\nEpisode 15\n\nLeon and TheRapist finally manage to save \"Fred\" but... it seems Chris has convinced him that he's actually Ethan Winters, and is unable to change his mind. Probably because he isn't actually Fred.\n\nEpisode 16\n\nAfter Bevi rescued Fred and forced him to fight to keep up the facade, he brought him to The Basement, where he revealed that him and his group are neither part of The Final Resistance, BANS Army, or The Three Kings, but a secret group with underhand goals that has been deceiving them, the Men With a Plan, the followers of the Oracle of LEON!. And he offers him a spot as a member.\n\nEpisode 17\n\nHowever, a very powerful individual breaches the basedment and destroys the men with a plan, so Fred simply leaves.\n\nAt the end of Suou Tatsuya's struggle, he meets up with everyone, which leaves Leon very confused about seeing two Freds. His wish for the world reborn is traps.\n\nTFR/Season 0[edit | edit source]\n\nA youth with a knack for solving mysteries and a passion for traps. At the end of high school and his group of detective buddies, Fred decides to put his suplex techniques he learned during their travels to use and joins a wrestling company.\n\nAfter a series of matches against Leon S. Kennedy, their small rivalry concludes in an epic 60 minute bout, the both saw each other in a different light, and Leon offers him to become partners, and more than that offers him to enlist his help for something else, and the two go out drinking. Then, he shows up at Fred's van at 6AM to tell him that he put a GPS on Ada Wong and they are going after her together. What an offer.\n\nEpisode 1\n\nLeon and Fred have recently joined TFR, when Leon decides to go on a trip together to see Ada, and Leon is so excited he waits 7 hours in the parking lot waiting for Fred.\n\nOnce Fred goes to the parking lot, he finds Leon there who had been waiting for the whole 7 hours of the show. This draws the attention of a Feeble Man security guard who wants them in for interrogation, but Fred stands in his way. Seems the match took more of him than he expected because he was too gassed for this fight. While the guard calls reinforcements, Leon gets in the driver's seat and they race out.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nAfter rushing out from the arena, Fred tells Leon to slow down since they already lost them, but Leon refuses, and when Fred tries to wrestle the wheel out of him, they end up crashing. Before Leon can even mutter half a coherent sentence to the cop checking on them, he told him to close his mouth and follow him.\n\nThe police officer takes them to Southtown Correctional Facility for drunk driving. While there, multiple explosions go off, opening the cell, and they are greeted by Osama bin Laden, who has purposefully come to the prison to recruit more members for the Avatars of Allah for the Jihad, and as such can get out whenever he can with the key he holds. Fred thanks him for doing the heavy lifting and kindly rejects the offer, and then forcefully takes the key. Osama didn't seem to want to do any harm to them however...\n\nEpisode 3[edit | edit source]\n\nAfter Fred's victory and Leon's... nothing... the two make their way to the source of the explosion to find the yard and make the easiest prison escape in history, when Warden Osborne shows up to block the way. After seeing them allying with that terrorist, he's gonna show them the consequence of their mistake by making it look like an \"accident\" on the prison record. Fred tells Leon to take care of him while he tries to open up the door. Leon worries about his suit...\n\nTurns out, Fred didn't have enough INT to open the door, so he had to go read a book and made some methamphetamine too, but it still won't open. But Osborne is not tired at all and ready for round 2.\n\nLeon is barely hanging on, meanwhile Fred had to train STR by building weapons. Leon complains that it sounds awfully complex for opening a door, but Fred affirms it's just how it works. Despite Leon having such a Hard Time, Osborne gets up to put an end to his time.\n\nLeon can't put down Osborne, but Fred finds some dynamite and blows open the door. Before Leon can go through, Osborne bonks him right in the head out cold with his baton, and prepares to hit Fred... but Osama takes the blow and restrains him: It was because through his dynamite usage he saw the beauty in his explosion, in it's grace he saw his best subordinate, that he chose to forgive him for his recklessness. Osama jumps away while holding Osborne, and both are engulfed in an explosion. Fred drags Leon out while lamenting his fate.\n\nEpisode 4\n\nAfter Leon wakes up, initially confusing him for Ada, Fred explains how he got hit and Osama saved them (and he was a good friend). Now they gotta make their way to a nearby place where the GPS points to.\n\nFred and Leon arrive to The Sonozaki Residence and remember there was a mafia with that name, which makes Leon barge in thinking Ada was kidnapped. They are greeted by Kasai Tatsuyoshi, who is ignorant to any of Leon's babble. When Leon mentions Ada's name, Kasai remembers her, but mentions she is not related to them at all. Leon ignores all of this and keeps thinking they kidnapped her, so without options, Kasai has to intervene.\n\nWhen Fred tries to stop Leon, he throws his suit at him and reveals his Ada tattoo just as Kasai reveals his Akane one. Leon, drunk as always, does a shitty strategy that somehow works against the Shotgun Dragon, but makes for a shitty match.\n\nEpisode 5[edit | edit source]\n\nLucky for Leon, Kasai had seen his noble(?) intentions before the match and didn't use the full power of the Shotgun Dragon. Being another simp man who has the beauty of a woman tattooed on his back, he is willing to give him a hand. Fred tells Leon that the GPS signal is actually pointing to a man inside the house, and Kasai offers them to talk to Steven Sonozaki, the Patriarch of the Sonozaki Family and the most feared and respected man in Coolsville, who overpowers even Kasai in strength.\n\nThe three enter the residence, and through Steven's intense humbleness, he allows them to speak to him. Before Leon can say anything really stupid that gets their fingernails removed, Fred covers his mouth and tells Steven that he is being tracked, mentioning that the device previously was being used on an acquaintance named Ada Wong. Steven had previously met her for a \"private meeting\", but the chinese can't really compare to Japanese women. On where she went, Steven does not know, but through driving tanks into people's houses he has gained many friends, most important being The Cagist, the biggest info broker on Coolsville who resides where no man has ever set foot: NXT. Steven gives them these directions as thanks for the information he was given. Fred goes on his way, remembering to take his hand off and let Leon breathe at some point.\n\nA desolate place no one dares visit, and a good place to have a drink at 3AM: NXT. The duo finally arrives at its entrance, but before they can go in, a shady man appears and wonders what they're doing around here, and yet Fred throws it right back at him, since no one should be at NXT, he could only be related to the ones who took Ada. The draconic man tries to solve the situation peacefully since he's merely visiting a friend, but with such shady appearance unlike their good friend Osama, Fred puts fists together in preparation. The visitor explains he comes for info and only mistook them for Evolution guys, but Fred won't fall for any traps, and so they will let their fists do the talking.\n\nDespite a grueling fight where Leon acted drunk out of his ass and Fred pinned Kiryu, somehow, he still managed to win and pinned them both in such an incredible way that left them confused long after it was over. Having taught them a thing or two, the man he came to see showed himself up; celebrating another amazing display, The Cagist is naturally already informed of Kiryu's intention. Unlike other dirtsheets around that say things like \"P-P-Plans change\", Cagist's information is as flawless as his booking. He invites all three of them to talk, but especially wants A+ player Kiryu to be his main event. Wanting to relax, Kiryu walks into the Karaoke backstage before negotiation time...\n\nEpisode 6\n\nThe Cagist asks Leon and Fred what do they want, although in fact, he already knows they are after Ada Wong, a world famous spy, or rather where she's headed next. Leon begs Cagist he will do anything to get the information immediately, but obviously you can't talk to the King of Kings like that, since The Game is not one to be bossed around, and they don't want to find out why he's called the the Cerebral Assassin. Their part of the deal is, obviously, having to fight at NXT, even if they aren't a draw the card has to be filled after all. However, under NXT's roof means fighting under NXT rules: They'll have to fight at The Coliseum's Cage. Leon thinks he might not have drank enough and is too sober to notice, and Fred as well only sees a normal cage; so Cagist has to explain to them the magnificence of her wife's creation as the most hellish structure ever put around a wrestling ring, the terror experienced after being locked inside it for all of October while also wearing another \"cage\" is one that to this day permeates the structure. Also all matches are 2/3 KOs, but it's normal of midcarders to care more about that detail than a masterpiece of structural design...\n\nFred's match is against some kid whose grandfather signed up for the show, Fred scored a KO but the still-green trainee forgot the stipulations and pinned him, so naturally Fred pinned him in turn, and won by his single KO point.\n\nEpisode 7\n\nHaving won their matches, The Cagist now needs to consult his sources for the info. When suddenly a strange man which Leon confuses as Ada's captor shows up, who then introduces himself as freelancer cameraman from Tokyo Tomitake Jirou, on a quest fo photograph the legendary 「desolate arena with nay a soul on its crowd」, and was surprised to see someone, although Fred indeed thinks it SUCKS. While waiting, Tomitake gets the idea to teach them something cool (even more than Leon's suit and \"How to impress Asian girls 101\"), and introduces them to \"Flashes\", something that appears sometimes when they witness unique moment that they want to capture and focus on (Like Fred does any time he sees a \"trap\"). Tomitake then takes several Tomitake Flash!es of them and leaves so they can talk to The Cagist.\n\nThe Cagist returns with a final favor leaves the explaining to Steph: Hunter has been a bad boy and the cage will be locked extra tight until NXT draws at least a single dime.\n\nFred calls her a cunt, buy Leon for some reason takes a Flash and closes his eyes for a while before tearing the image. When Leon returns to himself, he hears he has to beat up some asshole, before learning Cagist requested them to fight each other, and Fred wasn't very happy with Leon's comment and decides to scramble his brain right with some suplexes.\n\nAfter the match, Tomitake is frantically taking photos of the match's conclusion from the crowd, and having succeeded in the miracle of giving NXT a dime, Cagist offers his truth, if they can handle it. Leon thinks Ada may be in danger so he asks for it quickly, with Fred sighting at him still not getting it, and Cagist tells him that as a spy she must do things she doesn't want to (although spreading viruses might not be one of them), like being close to influential members of society; Leon remembers about how Steven and her must be friends, but Cagist tells him that sometimes they have to get physical, which causes Leon to be furious thinking that they were hitting her, but The Cagist tells him it's closer to her relation with John Clemens (which he also takes as him beating her). Finally the Cagist spells it out to him that she had to suck and fuck old men for valuable info, and after learning the harsh truth, Leon hits the table and leaves, with Fred going after him.\n\nEpisode 8\n\nAfter the hurtful revelation, it's all over for Leon. Fred consoles him by telling him that it's only her job after all and he should be angry with the ones that force her instead. In fact, she's not the one who changed, but Leon. Even after becoming motivated, he still needs a drink, so Fred has an idea, and despite feeling bad about it, suggests a place he knows to help Leon.\n\nThey arrive at the Eden of Coolsville, and are greeted by the manager Vergil, who quickly recognizes Fred as a VIP and calls the owner, Chuck, greeting Fred after he been seen there in a while. After missing this place, Fred requests his favorite trap, and since Leon still thinks it's a bar, Fred orders for him the \"#1\" on Fred's account. Charles guides Leon to his room (impressed that a bar offers private drinking rooms) saying it rocks, but to Fred it quite literally... SUCKS.\n\nEpisode 9\n\nAfter a truck crashes on the building, Fred rushes down only to find Leon unconscious with Chris Redfield next to him, attacking him as retribution for Leon.\n\nIn the middle of the match just as Fred is going hard at Chris, Majima Goro gets off from the truck and invades the match, making it a free-for-all. Fred then realized Chris didn't really want to fight (but kept going because it was a good match), and after Majima stuns Chris, Fred takes the chance to pin and defeat him.\n\nAfter hearing reports about the president from the escaped club-goers, Ooishi Kuraudo and Suou Katsuya from the CPD arrive at the scene and stop everyone. Ooishi tells Katsuya to gather testimonies while he investigates the bodies, and the rest of the force to capture the shimano guy; although Majima is annoyed he had to do whatever it takes for the boss, he gives himself in and pays a visit to his bro.\n\nFred compliments Chris' punching technique after realizing he wasn't the one who hurt Leon and apologizes for the quick judgement, then rushes Leon to the hospital.\n\nEpisode 10.2\n\nAfter a \"short\" drunken nap, Leon waltzes right to the bar's private suite, but what he finds is not an old man having a good time with Cum Bucket, but his lifeless corpse after being shot through the window. Leon rushes to the first floor to try and catch the hitman, and through the main door the only thing he can see in the darkness is Fred?; he asks what he's doing outside but he remains silent, so instead he explains what happened, but Fred? (now shirtless) asks him to go back inside to drink more, which confuses Leon (shirtless as well) before he becomes very dazed by the strange situation, and Fred? asks him to remember the good old times...\n\nEpisode 11\n\nLeon wakes up in an hospital bed, and a now less worried Fred draws near, alleviated but confused about his mention of a Cookie, and calls the Nurse. The nurse remarks that him being as fine as he is from such an accident must be a miracle, although 70% of his body liquid being alcohol is anything but. On that note she reminds Fred to take his Percocet, and wonders if he knows anything about a disappearance of their stash. Once she leaves, Fred suggests to leave and keep going, but knowing Ada didn't come to visit and with his suit ruined, Leon just wants to go home...and their road trip is over...\n\nEpisode 13\n\nReady to rescue Ada, Leon and Fred arrive at a dungeon (presumably under Hazz Tower), but other than a china-like smell, the place is empty, other than the Mercenary of Darkness, Mr. Death himself guarding a cell. Leon tries to show his moves to Ada, but the Umbrella Badass is simply too powerful. Luckily, his contract expires just in time for Leon to be okay, but while he was distracted, Ada escaped leaving behind only a note that Fred found.\n\nThank yoo for heruping me, Reon! By distracting that man guarding me, I managed to get away! He was quite a HUNK of a man, though... What a waste! I must reave to Coorsvirre Hirrs now, though! It's the onry way I can protect my homerand! Otherwise, that man... He's about to starutto war with them! If he redeems the nucrear carudo, it wirr be over! Be seeing you, Reon.\n\nWithout delay, the two leave to save china and it's great karaoke culture from Hazz.\n\nEpisode 14[edit | edit source]\n\nWith Hazz's evil intentions in clear display (especially thanks to reading), Leon and Fred waste no time contacting friends of Kiryu Kazuma and heading to Coolsville Hills, arriving at its top in an helicopter piloted by The Cagist, Date Kaname and Suou Katsuya. After Kiryu defeats Rob Van Dam, Cesaro, and Stevie Richards, Hazz shoots Stevie and Kiryu, and explains how he had requested his own hit, to hide his past as a vicious wrestler who consumed his opponents lives in a desperate attempt to make his name bigger, as well as many more sins, and went as far as to give his first ring name, Spazz Maticus, to his own son and nurture him into a maniac bastard worthy of his own past to further deceive both him and the world. And to go even further, he artificially aged himself so no connection could be made, as well as to have an easier time becoming president and becoming strong & smart enough to carry such a complex plan.\n\nBefore Hazz can end Kiryu, Leon and Fred drop from the helicopter and Kiryu is taken into it. Leon confronts him about the horrible things he did to Ada and plans to do to her homeland, but Hazz says nuking china is but a small part of his plan to make the USA the undisputed most powerful nation in the world. However, Hazz recognized Ada as the only thing of worth to come out of such a terrible place, as she reminded him of his dear sister, and he is the origin of all their misfortunes since their trip began by being madly in love with her and keeping her locked up so that KaibaCorp could make a clone of her, but was delayed since their first prototype was absolutely terrible. Leon will stop at nothing until he inflicts Ada's suffering on him tenfold, and Fred will make him pay for the van that Leon crashed... oh and the people that died too.\n\nHazz's presidential guard of 4 S.W.A.T. Members challenges them, but, they are mowed down by the paranormal patrol, and at last Hazz fights them directly with the S.W.A.T. Captain. Despite all this power, his plan, his gun, and his complex old age, Hazz couldn't stop Leon and Fred from ending his reign and saving China, not only because they had yellow fever, apple juice and a dilapidated van, but comrades by their side; Kiryu Kazuma... Suou Katsuya... Date Kaname... Shoji Shingo... Majima Goro and his brother... Warden Osborne... Officer Joe... Osama bin Laden... Kasai Tatsuyoshi... Van Darkholme... The Cagist... Hanyuu... Extra... Vergil... Dante... HUNK... Zagreus... Ryback, Chris Masters, Sheamus... Narihisago Akihito... Zoomer... Tomitake Jirou... Hassan and Kojima... Chuck... and Gregory Edgeworth... all irreplaceable people whose bonds have carried them to defeat him.\n\nThe shock from his defeat and seeing all that he lacked gets to him and Hazz's old body can't take it anymore, as he curses the people of this city and its country. But as he stands at the verge of death, Hazz laughs, for his plan is still not over: his second term is already over, but his faked death, on the other hand, would continue to live by pushing a successor right into the presidency. Leon and Fred recall his crazed son hating his father and vice verse, and fail to understand why Hazz continues to laugh as he collapses and keeps repeating \"My Son\"...\n\nAs they walk back to the van, once their grand adventure is over and their destiny to just go home, Leon is still quite sad that they didn't even get to see Ada, despite Fred's attempts to cheer him by mentioning that their journey changed the country and saved another. Remarking that he never changes, Fred offers Leon to go drinking later, to Leon's surprise (but never specified what kind), and Leon rushes to the van...\n\nLeon, despite what I might say sometimes, you're pretty amazing...\n\nIf it was for Ada, you'd do anything. You'd save the world for her sake.\n\nMaybe... You would even challenge God himself...\n\nTheir trip home begins...\n\nEpisode Extra\n\nFred Jones, Kasuga Ichiban, Phoenix Wright, Chris Redfield, and Leon S. Kennedy (who passed out from drinking)... all of them gathered in the Survive Bar for one single reason. As the rumors grew and got terrifyingly big, they received a call. At last enters Kiryu Kazuma brandishing a note, something that might be even bigger than Hazz's plans:\n\nTo: The Dragon and others\n\nThis is a challenge to all of you. To the biggest wrestlers around Coolsville. If you're willing to defend the current rotten state of this business, then you shall face us. However, I'm afraid it would be pointless todo so, considering our immense strength. Our new promotion has some of the most talented people to ever step foot in a wrestling ring. We will eagerly await your decision.\n\n- The Amon Clan\n\nThese old rivals of The Dragon have returned to take revenge to new heights by creating Amon Elite Wrestling. Though Coolsville might SUCK, they cannot allow them to take over the city, and its up to them to defend TFR's legacy from such a pissant fed. There's only a single place where this war will start and end: Coolsville Hills.\n\nFred Jones's challenger is the security master of Amon; Amon S.W.A.T., and AEW scores their first victory.\n\nIn the end, the war is lost and AEW is rejected from establishing itself on Coolsville\n\nTFR/Season 7[edit | edit source]\n\nBack once again at TFR, the duo is back to say that Coolsville sucks!\n\nEpisode 1\n\nOr it would be, had it not been that Leon enters The Vents while escaping from Chris Redfield and disappeared, leaving Fred partnerless.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nDutch explains how Leon just up and disappeared when he got inside the vent to Fred, and he manages to convince the Mystery Masters to help investigate where Leon might have gone, so Saihara Shuichi enters the vents.\n\nEpisode 3[edit | edit source]\n\nWith no options left, he has no way to participate in the upcoming team match. But to honor Leon's deal, Dutch helps Fred by getting him a partner, but in exchange he has to teach Arthur a lesson. Indeed, Dutch got him a partner... but not one he was particularly happy to see again.\n\nEpisode 4\n\nFred and Shaggy are challenged by Kirei's team as well, and defeated.\n\nLeon encounters \"Fred\" while on the vents... but it turns out to be a fake.\n\nEpisode 5\n\nFred supports Shaggy in his match against Armstrong.\n\nThen, when Arthur is drafted to BCW, Dutch goes nuclear asking Fred that they have to save him.\n\nEpisode 8\n\nDespite Fred warming up to Shaggy again a bit, it's time to see which one of the two deserves more to go to the tournament to represent Mystery Incorporated.\n\nThus, Fred shows him why he was the leader in the first place.\n\nEpisode 9\n\nVergil is happy to see Fred so they can settle the way that triple-threat went, where despite Fred winning, Vergil wasn't pinned. Fred claims that he fled to BCW because he had no room to become #1 in Coolsville with him around, and even claims that power SUCKS, but Vergil defeats him and demoralizes the TFR team by beating their locker room leader.\n\nTFR/Off-Season 7[edit | edit source]\n\nBegins perking up even harder and becomes \"Perc Jones\".\n\nTFR/Off-Season 8[edit | edit source]\n\nHis descent into madness when taking percocet goes further; he has become one with the moonsaults.\n\nEpisode 9\n\nParticipates in the TFR World Cup as a contender in the \"Hall of Fame Talent\" Tournament.\n\nEpisode 15: April Fools\n\nWins the rumble while absolutely perked up and becomes #1 contender for the /v/ World Championship and instantly receives a title match, but loses.\n\nEpisode 24\n\nAgain overdoses on perc and wins a rumble from 15th place, taking the title shot for himself. As soon as the champ is finished, he runs in without anyone being able to stop him and forces a match and won't even allow a DQ to end it, but Kasuga retains.\n\nEpisode 26\n\nDespite Boomer & Kaidou's attempts to shut him down and keep him out of the match, Perc still proved himself the most dangerous being on the ring and destroyed them for the King of Jobbers contendership.\n\nEpisode 27\n\nToo beaned up for even a real american like Carlos to stop him from getting the title.\n\nEpisode 28\n\nPegasus robbed him of his perc's unpredictability effects with his millennium eye.\n\nEpisode 33\n\nParticipates in the TFR Championship Return Tournament.\n\nBut didn't take enough percs.\n\nEpisode 36: Rokkenjimania IV[edit | edit source]\n\nIn a different world, Fred Jones is a respected and addiction-free wrestler. Due to never meeting an accursed creature related to their dog, he never left his friends and didn't suffer being caught saying Coolsville sucks, which changed him forever.\n\nOne day, while walking backstage, he finds an unknown man named Leon Kennedy prying open his locker. Initially enraged, when Suou Tatsuya arrives, Fred says he has better stuff to do than beat up 'amateurs' and leaves. Later, he finds himself drinking in a local bar when that same stranger appears, and Fred proceeds to leave.\n\nDays later, that same man was crawling into a vent, so Fred, annoyed by his weird acts, pulled him off, only for that man to push Fred aside and get back in. Without being able to react, the chair used he used to reach the vent hit Fred's face. *clank* It was raised up and flew down on Fred again. *clank* And again. *clank* And again. *clank* *clank* *clank* *clank* *clank* *clank* Until eventually people came to drag him away and take to the police.\n\nThe next day, Leon head to the hospital to see Fred, and apologizes, hoping he can one day be forgiven. Fred reasons they could wrestle it out sometime, so he could give him some payback, and maybe they could put on a good match. And then, they'll have to settle it up, if Leon wants to win an apology, it's a deal. But Leon asks one more thing... the reason he didn't press charges... is because a man he truly respected him asked him not to. Chris Redfield. Before he left the room, Fred asked Leon to tell the doctor to bring him some... painkillers.\n\nThe Extinct Light[edit | edit source]\n\nSince substance checks have become too harsh, he moves to Amakusa Elite Wrestling where he can perc to the extreme.\n\nTFR/Off-Season 9: AEW Dark[edit | edit source]\n\nGets put in gay babby jail after being told to stop wrestling like in the fed, but by this point he's too high on percs to do anything else.\n\nEpisode 6\n\nIn an unfortunate turn of events, Jones abused the generosity of one of the most affable backstage personalities in AEW, Zag, by taking the title away from him in a new year's charity match, wrestling completely in the fed's style.\n\nTFR/Season 8[edit | edit source]\n\nThe destruction he leaves in the wake of his matches is not even human at this point... he has become a being of pure percs, and can't be controlled anymore.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nSuplexes a mech to death to retain his championship.\n\nEpisode 5\n\nFinally loses the Hardcoe Ass Motherfucker after an exhausing ladder match.\n\nEpisode 6\n\nTo make wrestling better, first one needs to change the world around them.
