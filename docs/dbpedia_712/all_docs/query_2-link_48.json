He would like to change some, like over-eating, but never bothered to try. The owl convinces him that if you want to, if you know how, and if you’re willing to work at it, habits can be changed.\n\nOur collection comprises over 40,000 moving image works, acquired and catalogued between the 1940s and early 2000s. As a result, some items may reflect outdated, offensive and possibly harmful views and opinions. ACMI is working to identify and redress such usages.\n\nLearn more about our collection and our collection policy here.
