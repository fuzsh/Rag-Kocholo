        "text": "So you know what that means: Horror TV episodes Tuesday! I know this is a little odd, TV episodes on a Tuesday instead of Friday as I’ve been doing for the past few years? Well this year October 1st started on a Friday and it just doesn’t seem right for Horrorfest to start with a review of a TV episode.\n\nSo instead we will be reviewing TV episodes on Tuesdays, TV Tuesdays.\n\nAnd our next TV episode comes from:\n\nMy niece and I were hanging out and I let her choose whatever she wanted to watch and of course we ended up watching a few scary movies: Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, Sinister, etc.\n\nBut we ended up spending the last of the night on the the Disney channel and watching this hilarious Scooby-Doo themed episode of Austin & Ally. Now I have never been a big Austin & Ally fan but my nieces have always loved it. They made Ally a little too neurotic for my taste, but the concept is good.\n\nIf you are a ‘70s Scooby-Doo fan then you will love this episode as it is a spoof of the classic cartoon.\n\nSo in case you haven’t seen the show, it takes place in Florida. Ally is the daughter of the music store owner, store located in the mall, and a budding songwriter. She loves writing poems and songs, but is too shy to share them with anyone. Austin is popular and outgoing, he dreams of being a singer, but cannot write lyrics.\n\nAustin finds Ally’s songbook and ends up using one of the songs to perform, adding music and his own twist to it. At first Ally is angry, but he gives her complete credit and she decides to team up with him and collaborate. Austin’s friend Dez joins the group by directing and being in charge of the music videos. Ally’s friend Trish rounds out the group by being the manager.\n\nThis episode takes place in season 4 of the series. By this time the two have both become established singers and Austin & Ally are currently dating.\n\nThe episode starts off with Ally having just finished her newest song. She puts it away in her special book and then she and Trish get ready for the ‘70’s themed dance they are going to go to at the school.\n\nThey all end up dressing up as The Groovy Goat and the Mystery Bunch (a parody of Scooby-Doo and the Mystery Gang).\n\nThey go to the dance and have fun grooving to the ‘70s music, but when they return to their table they discover that Ally’s notebook is missing!\n\nJinkies! It’s up to the gang to try and solve this mystery and discover who might be the thief.\n\nThe gang start searching the library for the book and run into the librarian. The librarian reveals that she did spot Ally’s journal, a blonde in a jumpsuit had it.\n\nWhen they return to the dance they spot three people wearing that same particular costume: Kimmy, Chuck, and Miles.\n\nNow what I found was weird was the fact that the school library was open during a dance and that there was a librarian hanging around that late at night. That didn’t seem to make any sense at all.\n\nAll I could think was maybe she isn’t the librarian?! Maybe she’s wearing an old lady mask á la Scooby-Doo?\n\nTrish questions them, but it isn’t clear which is the culprit. Chuck is spotted singing Ally’s new song, Kimmy is still angry Ally won prom Queen and she didn’t, and Miles hasn’t done anything but a Trish just feels he is suspicious. To me this feels like I’m A Pup Named Scooby-Doo when Fred would always think it was Red Harry.\n\nMeanwhile, Ally has received a message that if she wants to see her book again to go to the photo booth, and she does alone, something you should never do. Why didn’t she just ask a friend to help her? Instead she makes a very dumb decision, and goes alone getting captured.\n\nAustin stays in the library with the librarian Mrs. Kravitz who just happens to have pancakes, a favorite of Austin’s, and feeds him.\n\nDez and Trish on the other hand are better friends as they go looking for Ally and discover her in the photo booth. They free her and she reveals the person who locked her in was Mrs. Kravitz, the librarian. The LIBRARIAN?!!\n\nThe gang rush after to confront her but Mrs. Kravitz is too fast for them. They chase after her but notice her face looks weird.\n\nYep, I guessed it in the beginning. Mrs. Kravitz was no librarian. It was Brooke, the girl who is obsessed with Austin and believes them to be soulmates. She was trying to get rid of Ally to have Austin to herself.\n\nIn the end the group has Ally’s book, dance the night away, and treat Chuck, Miles, and Kimmy to ice-cream to make up for suspecting them.\n\nBut as they are getting ice-cream Ally starts acting really strange. She’s not at all like herself and super clingy.\n\nThey pinch Ally’s face and discover that she is really Brooke in a mask who they chase away when the real Ally shows up. Of course all have to give her a good pinch to discover if she is real or fake.\n\nIt’s a cute episode and fun for Scooby-Doo fans.\n\nFor more Disney, go to You’re Kids. I’m a Vampire!: Mom’s Got a Date With a Vampire (2000)\n\nFor more Scooby-Doo, go to Zombie Pirates and Werecats: Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (1998)\n\nFor more mysteries, go to Stolen Lover Leads to Murder: Death on the Nile (2004)\n\nSo every year I review an animated film, and here we are with Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\n\nI am such a huge Scooby-Doo fan and I remember being so excited when this came out, it was also interesting to see that it was going to have real monsters! I mean in the older films like Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf or The Ghoul School, 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, etc. had monsters, but this was a world where monsters didn’t “exist” and now there was going to be some! My six year old self was super, super excited to watch this on TV and I was not disappointed.\n\nLast year I reviewed Stephen King’s Sleepwalkers, a truly horrible film about werecat people. It doesn’t surprise me that an animated Scooby-Doo film has better Werecat people. Yes, this low budget animated film is the far superior one.\n\nPlus no dead cats!\n\nSo this film picks up after years have passed and the gang has ended their crime solving days to do other pursuits.\n\nFred is a cameraman for Daphne’s show, which investigates paranormal things and uncovers the truth. I think it is cute that Fred loved Daphne enough to move from being the frontman of the group to taking the behind the scenes role. They are adorable and I don’t like that people keep trying to put Daphne and Velma together, it is Fred and Daphne all the way.\n\nVelma had opened her own mystery book shop, which makes sense. Although you think with all the technology she figures out and the mysteries she solved she would go into movie making, technology creating, or even mystery writing. But maybe she likes running a shop instead. After all, having a bookstore does sound like fun.\n\nShaggy and Scooby work as airport security, especially customs as they like to take food away from the customers. I can see it.\n\nIt is Daphne’s birthday and she is wishing for a real mystery to solve instead of it always being a man in a mask. Fred wants to make her feel better and brings the mystery machine back from the grave and gets the gang back together for a cross country ghost trip. He’s so sweet!\n\nBut no “real” monsters or ghosts are found.\n\nThey are in New Orleans, bemoaning the fact that there are no real monsters when they are overheard and approached by a Lena Dupree. She is a cook on Moonscar Island and shares that there are mysterious occurrences on the island and it is believed to be haunted by the ghost of the pirate Morgan Moonscar. The gang decide to go along with them and meet Jacques the ferryman who reminds me a lot of the Captain in The Creature from the Black Lagoon. Once on the island they meet Simone Lenoir, the owner of the chili pepper plantation, where the gang all stay.\n\nThere are some weird things going on at the plantation, like a chill in the air, which they replay to later see a ghost caught on camera. Then Shaggy sees a confederate ghost in his room. Velma thinks everything it fake while Shaggy is scared and Daphne hopes it is real. Velma also discovers that the plantation is created from pieces of the pirate ship, which is puzzling to her. Typically people would use woods from ships to create houses and homes, as any ready wood would be used. But this is odd as why would pirates agree to it? They would need their ship to continue their adventures? And who were the people who built it? How were they able to take that wood from the pirates.\n\nBut even with all the strange and unusual things happening, I would be down to go to Moonscar Island, or should I say Meowsca Island as it is full of cats. Cats are everywhere and Simone and Lena’s favorite creatures. If I lived here this is how it would be, it would be like 101 Dalmatians but 101 cats. It would be like Aoshima Island.\n\nThe only problem with all the cats is that even though Scooby has never had any serious doglike behavior before and has never chased cats in any previous episodes or films that I can remember, in this he cannot stop barking and chasing the cats. It gets so bad that he and Shaggy are banished to the mystery machine.\n\nLater Shaggy and Scooby are chased by Zombies, all kinds of Zombies as in from all different time periods. As a kid when I first watched this I remember us commenting on the ghosts/zombies and how they are supposed to be from the past, then why are there modern people too? One guy is in a big Hawaiian shirt and camera, looking very much like a ‘90s tourist. When did he get turned and how come Lena and Simone didn’t mention anything about those confederate and modern zombies?\n\nSo Daphne is thrilled that these could be real, while Fred and Velma are still not convinced. Fred thinks Lena is so sweet and charming, and starts thinking that Beau-the very handsome broody gardener that made both girls give a second look at him-is the one behind it. Velma starts thinking it is him as well as she finds his behavior suspicious.\n\nThey have this scene when Velma is questioning him and you think he is going to hurt her, but it turns out that he saves her. Even so, Velma is still uncertain about him.\n\nMeanwhile that evening, Daphne and Fred capture a zombie and think that it is fake, but when they try to remove the head, they discover that it can’t come off. Now a lot of people will probably think it was rude of Fred to try after Daphne failed, but I have never been anywhere where something is locked or unable to be opened and other people, even though they see it is locked, they always has to give it a try. When the two realize that it is real, they also scream in terror, run, and of course drop the camera in quicksand hiding all proof of real zombies.\n\nOne thing Scooby-Doo always gets right in their films are the soundtrack. This one is great as usual as their terror time song is catchy and fun.\n\nScooby and Shaggy are running and they fall into a cave. There they find these little dolls made out of wax that look just like Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Beau. They do the most relatable thing anyone would do in their situation and play with them, but what they don’t realize is that the dolls are actually voodoo dolls. So everything they do, such as having one friend smack another in the face (again super relatable), cause their buds to actually do that. They end up stopping when they hear bats and run scared from the cave. As they are running around, the rest of the gang plus Beau head off to keep investigating.\n\nThey go into the house and and find a secret passageway to the cave. Lena comes running and tells them that Simone was dragged away by zombies, all want to help but Velma who keeps staring at the ground. They go follow Lena and come upon the voodoo dolls and a perfectly fine Simone, all of which Velma knew as she noticed there weren’t any dragged marks on the ground but footsteps.\n\nSimone and Lena reveal that they are Sleepwalkers, no just kidding- but they are similar in that they are werecats. They came to the island with a group of others to worship their cat god and lead peaceful lives, but were attacked by pirates. Lena and Simone were the only ones to survive and they made an exchange to the moon goddess to rid change themselves and destroy the pirates, but didn’t realize that they will now always be werecats. They need to drain the life force of people every harvest moon to survive. They also turned Jacques the ferryman to help bring tourists on and use them to survive.\n\nThey made the voodoo dolls of them but not of Shaggy and Scooby as they believe Jacques could handle them. As they control the figurines and their real life counterparts, they are interrupted by a terrified Shaggy and Scooby running amuck and causing them problems.\n\nAfter a classic Scooby Doo run around, they end up getting captured. The three werecats prepare to destroy the gang + Beau, but just as it looks as if all hope is lost, it turns out that they did too much messing around and the ritual time has passsed. The three werecats turn into dust and blow away in the wind.\n\nIn the end all is well on island and the gang wonder how will they tell the police what happened? Who would believe them?\n\nBut in a surprising twist, Beau reveals he is an undercover police officer, sent to the island to investigate the disappearances. He is at a loss of how to convince the rest of the police force of what happened, but Daphne sort of saves the day by asking him to be on her show. I mean it still sounds crazy, but the Mystery gang are established people so I guess it will all work out?\n\nThey all leave the island which is now free form evil and at rest, or at least until the sequel in 2019.\n\nSo I loved this film. It was so much fun and I remember that having “real” monsters was such a big deal. It still is just as good and I rewatched it with my niece who also loved it.\n\nNo Facebook cover for this film as I couldn’t find an image large enough that I liked.\n\nFor more Scooby-Doo, go to Goofy Ghosts and a Treasure Hunt: Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers (1987)\n\nFor more animated films, go to In the Spa House of the Spirits: Spirited Away (2001)\n\nFor more zombies, go to Holy Crap, Leonard’s a Zombie: Epidemiology, Community (2010)\n\nFor more ghosts, go to No Haunt Me Then!…I Know That Ghosts Have Wandered On The Earth. Be With Me Always…Drive Me Mad, Only Do Not Leave Me in This Dark Alone…I Cannot Live Without My Life! I Cannot Die Without My Soul.: Wuthering Heights (1939)\n\nHow do you kill a fangirl? Well there are quite a few ways: Let’s see…1) Kill off their favorite characters/have them leave the series\n\n2) Have the wrong people end up together.\n\n3) Stop writing/take show off the air, especially if it ends without a finale\n\n4)When the character changes, does things they never would do\n\n5) When they start repeating the same things over and over\n\n6) Season Finale/Last book that just ends, without tying everything up\n\nI could go on, but that’s not what this post is really about. Instead it is one of my fandom posts, about the fandoms I am in.\n\nSo here we go!\n\nMighty Morphin’ Power Rangers\n\nPOWER RANGERS!!!! HECK YEAH!\n\nGrowing up the Power Rangers were awesome! Regular kids chosen to fight aliens and protect the earth, transforming into the Power Rangers and riding in robots called Zords.\n\nMy friends and I used to act out the adventures in the TV show, along with creating our own. My favorite was Kimberly, the pink ranger.\n\nAnd I loved Tommy the Green Ranger/Gold Ranger. He first starts off as bad, recruited to destroy the Rangers, but then redeems himself. He ends up losing his powers, and the Green Ranger is gone, coming back as the extremely awesome Gold Ranger. Not only was Tommy the best fighter, with the coolest weapons (eventually becoming the leader) but he was also super hot. I had such a crush on him.\n\nThey made a movie, The Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: The Movie, were they had to fight a creature so terrible, Ivan Ooze, he takes down Zordon. I just loved that movie so much as a kid. I used to watch it over and over again.\n\nI had the whole film memorized and we used to act it out all the time. In fact I remember getting in trouble once with a parent for dismantling the brooms so that one of us could have the noise sticks that Dulcea uses.\n\nI watched Power Rangers up until Power Rangers: Mystic Force. When Kimberly and Jason left and they brought in Cat, it went down hill for me. The other seasons were alright, but the only one that was any good being Dino Thunder because they brought Tommy back.\n\nI heard they are doing a movie reuniting most of the original cast and I hope they do!\n\nThe Partridge Family\n\nSo if you just read these fandom posts, you probably think I am some immortal being a teen in the ’70s as well as the ’90s; from all these ’70s shows I used to watch. Nope, I’m not a time traveler or vampire, I loved TV LAND, yep I used to watch it back when they showed old TV shows.\n\nThis show stared Shirley Jones as Shirley Partridge, widowed mother of five. When her kids want to try a record deal, she goes along and before you know it, they are a hit. They get a manager, a bus, and go touring all over the country.\n\nThis show also starred David Cassidy, Jones’ stepson, as the eldest child and heartthrob.\n\nI used to watch it every day and knew all the songs by The Partridge Family by heart. In fact this show had such a huge impact on me, that when I saw David Cassidy was going to be in a new musical series, Ruby & The Rockits. It was horrible writing, but I suffered through for my childhood nostalgia.\n\nThe Rocky Series\n\nAw Rocky. How I love you, and all your films. Well, except Creed as I have yet to see it. I started watching these films one 4th of July weekend when AMC had a marathon. I watched one, then another and another and another.\n\nAnd I loved them. Sylvester Stallone did a great job with this series.\n\nRocky (1976)\n\nSo let my start by wishing this film a very happy anniversary as it will be turning 40 on November 21st.\n\nSo the film Rocky was Slyvester Stallone’s first film. He was struggling as an actor, homeless, only having $106, and had even sold his dog. When the company was interested he wouldn’t give the script up until they agreed to have him as the star. They declined, but when they couldn’t get the script, they finally agreed.\n\nIt was shot in 28 days and had an extremely little budget. Stars had to share rooms, they filmed the street scenes guerilla style and with no permits or extras. Most of the wardrobe was furnished by the actors, and ones purchased were wrong. The lack of money for extras, caused them to rewrite some scenes and make due.\n\nBut not only was it nominated for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Screenplay, Best Sound, & Best Original Song; and won Best Picture, Best Director, & Best Film Editing: but it was the highest grossing film of the year. Not bad Stallone, not bad.\n\nSo Rocky is the story of Robert “Rocky” Balboa, a man who dreams of becoming a boxer star, going the distance, but has yet to get his chance. He works as an enforcer for a loan shark, but is too nice a guy to actually “enforce”. Everything changes when boxing star Apollo Creed decides that he wants to box an ordinary joe, giving a nobody the chance to be a somebody, and choosing Rocky. While Rocky works out for the chance of a lifetime, he dates his best friend’s sister, Adrian, becoming one of the sweetest couples in film history.\n\nThis story is not only amazing uplifting, as everyone can connect to a man trying to achieve his dreams, it has some truly poetic and realistic scenes. Besides the ice-skating with Adrian, and running up the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum (so great it gets parodied again and again), but the fact that Stallone choose to have Rocky loose the fight; showing his achievements in trying to be the true victory is truly poignant and fantastic.\n\nThis also had the incredible song, Gonna Fly Now written by Bill Conti as it’s theme. How can you not be inspired when listening to that?\n\nRocky II\n\nAfter the first film, Apollo is angry at the way that Rocky held his own against him in the match. Apollo demands a rematch, as he wants to peove that he is the true champ, Rocky just a fluke. Meanwhile, since the fight Rocky has been boosted in popularity. He doesn’t want to fight Apollo again, but due to his goading and Rocky’s lack of money, he agrees. Can he truly go the distance? Can he be a contender?\n\nRocky III\n\nThis is the first of the film series to have a Survivor song in it, this one of course having the amazing Eye of the Tiger.\n\nSo it has been three years since Rocky II. Since then Rocky has had successful fights and an increase in wealth for him and his family. As they are unveiling a statue of him, he gets called out by Clubber Lang, played by Mr. T. When Rocky questions Mickey, he discovers that Clubber Lang’s accusations were correct. His fights were handpicked to protect him. Rocky doesn’t want to fight Lang, but when he pushes Mickey and causes him to have a heart attack, dying, Rocky knows he has no other chance then to avenge Mickey’s death. He asks Apollo Creed to train him, and the two team up to get that “eye of the tiger” back.\n\nRocky IV\n\nIvan Drago (Dolph Lungren) is a 6’5 Russian Boxer brought to America to promote the U.S.S.R.’s superiority. They throw out a challenge that he can beat anyone, and Apollo agrees to an exhibition match. Apollo arrives with a huge show stopping number done by James Brown. Drago doesn’t take this match as “just an exhibition” and kills Creed. With his best friend dead, Rocky decides he must avenge his death, traveling to Russia to fight Drago there.\n\nRocky V\n\nAfter the fight with Drago, Rocky decides to retire from boxing. He had some permanent damage from the fight, and to add to the bad news he lost all his money due to a bad accountant. Rocky turns to training boxers, taking in a young guy off the street, Tommy Gunn. He helps him, and as Gunn starts moving up the ranks he catches the eye of another manager and leaves Rocky behind. Rocky is upset at the betryal, but Adraian tells him that Gunn is not worth it, as he doesn’t have any real heart. Gunn decides the only way to prove his true mettle is to take down Rocky. He tries to get him to fight, but Rocky won’t. When Gunn takes a sock at Paulie, Rocky changes his mind and starts training to cut him down.\n\nRocky Balboa (Rocky VI)\n\nThe sixth film takes place 20 years after the fifth film. One of the reasons Stallone decided to make this film, was that many people were dissatisfied with the ending of Rocky V, as it didn’t have a true wrap up to the series. In this Rocky is a widower, with an Italian resturant. He is in deep grief over the death of Adrian and has a struggling relationship with his son who wishes to be not known as Rocky’s son or have any connection to boxing. He reunites with grown up “Little Marie” from Rocky (1976). Meanwhile ESPN has done a Deadliest Warrior type show in which they analyze boxers from past, running the stats, victories, and teaming them up with present boxers. When Rocky wins against Mason “The Line” Dixon, Dixon gets enraged and Rocky decides to take up boxing again. This prompts the fight of fights as the two head off.\n\nA lot of people didn’t like this film, but I thought it was a cute shout out to the fans. I loved the way they decided to conclude it. If Rocky had lost the fight, it would have been horrible as no one wants to see an older man get beat up. And if Rocky had won, it would have been unbelievable. Having a tie was not only a call back to the first film’s idea that victory was in trying to achieve your dreams, but also a way to appease all.\n\nAs I wrote before I have yet to watch Creed, but I will hit on that when I watch it.\n\nScooby-Doo\n\nI LOVED SCOOBY-DOO\n\nI used to watch Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?, 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, The New Scooby-Doo Movies (in which Scooby-Doo meets the Harlarm Globetrotters, Cher, Sonny Bono, Batman, Robin, Josie & the Pussycats, etc.), The New Scooby-Doo, & What’s New Scooby-Doo.\n\nMy favorite of course was Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?. I used to watch the show all the time and had four birthday parties be Scooby-Doo themed. I had a huge collection of Scooby-Doo toys, from my own mystery machine and multiple Scooby-Doos; to a clock, clothes, books, and almost anything else you can think of.\n\nI also was a fan of the Scooby-Doo films. I loved Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School, Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf, Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers, Scooby-Doo! in Arabian Nights, Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders, Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase, etc.\n\nI saw the two Scooby-Doo theatrical films and thought they were okay. The first had an alright storyline, but I didn’t like the thought of “real monsters” and felt they didn’t capture the heart of the show. Besides Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred Jones and Sarah Michelle Geller as Daphne, I was sorely disappointed.\n\nSo let’s talk about the characters:\n\nFred Jones\n\nFred Jones was the leader of the teen group. He was always eager to get involved in a mystery and was a keen observer. His take charge attitude always made him be the one to figure out a plan to catch the cause of the crime, although Scooby or Shaggy’s antics would usually mess them up. He was the “straight man of the group” the one who complimented the crazy antics of Scooby and Shaggy, along with being the rock of the group.\n\nDaphne Blake\n\nDaphne Blake is often thought of as the beautiful socialite who was only interested in looks and getting kidnapped. That is not true! While Daphne tends to be the one that got captured, if anyone gets kidnapped, it didn’t happen in every episode. She was also ntelligent, proving her worth in solving the crimes, alongside Fred and Velma.\n\n*Fun Fact*-The Mystery Machine was actually Daphne’s 16th Birthday present. Why Fred is the one driving, I don’t know.\n\nVelma Dinkley\n\nVelma is the brain of the group, being the researcher and the one to find the final clue that ties everything together. Unlike Daphne, she is a more comedic character; having puns and great sarcastic wit. She also was always losing her glasses, struggling to see; they usually found by whatever creature they are hunting or her searching for them causing that creature to trip over her.\n\nNorville “Shaggy” Rogers\n\nNow contrary to popular belief, Shaggy is not a drug addict. The creators of the show were trying to hit every group when they made the show; Fred the jock, Daphne the princess, Velma the brain, etc. As Shaggy can’t be the criminal, because they are solving crimes, they wanted him to be the type of new culture coming out that “surfer-“hey man”-hippieish-type-dude”. Shaggy is a sweet guy that is interested in food and music. He is a scaredy-cat, never wanting to get involved with monsters or criminals, but always there in the final stretch. He and Scooby played the comedic roles, always accidentally getting involved with something, accidentally bringing new evidence to light, or accidentally catching the criminals.\n\nScooby-Doo\n\nScooby-Doo was adopted by Shaggy and is “his” dog, but in reality Scooby doesn’t even consider himself a dog as he is so advanced. Scooby can talk, think, and loves to eat. He often steals somebody’s meal, typically Shaggy. Scooby is a total coward, but in the end will come through for his friends, as long as he is given a Scooby snack. He assists Shaggy with the comedy, helping them accidentally foil any plans made by the criminals. He and Shaggy are the only characters to appear in every TV show & film.\n\nFor more on Scooby-Doo, go to A Monster Race: Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf (1988)\n\nFor the previous post, go to Portrait of a Fangirl\n\nAnd Stay tuned for part 19"
