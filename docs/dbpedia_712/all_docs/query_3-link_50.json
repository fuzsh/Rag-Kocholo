        "text": "Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo will have to solve what may be their greatest mystery yet in Scooby-Doo! and Krypto, Too!, which will be available in the US to purchase Digitally at retailers everywhere, and on DVD only at Walmart, starting September 26.\n\nThis all-new feature once again brings together the Scooby gang and DC, and we have an exclusive clip from this epic team-up to share with you today.\n\nIn that, we find Shaggy and Scooby-Doo exploring the Justice League's Hall of Justice alongside Krypto before they plead with Superman's loyal dog to help them make a \"Superhero Sandwich.\" That comes courtesy of the superpowered pup's heat vision...well, we'll let you see what happens next!\n\nCrossovers are always a blast for comic book fans and Scooby-Doo's world has proven well-suited to them (the Mystery Inc. gang previously crossed paths with a number of WWE Superstars and Supernatural's Sam and Dean Winchester). With that in mind, we're honestly surprised this return to the DC Universe has taken so long, but all signs point to it being worth the wait.\n\nWe just hope Scobby-Doo is getting his own superhero costume! We'll soon find out, but in the meantime, you can check out this hilarious new clip from Scooby-Doo! and Krypto, Too! below.\n\nIn Scooby-Doo! and Krypto, Too!, the world's greatest heroes, DC's Justice League, have mysteriously vanished and a terrifying phantom has taken up residence in The Hall of Justice. Now it's up to the world's greatest super sleuths, Scooby and the gang, to solve the mystery and save our heroes...with a little help from their new pal Krypto the Superdog.\n\nReturning as the voices of the Scooby gang are Frank Welker as Scooby-Doo and Fred Jones, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy Rogers, Kate Micucci as Velma Dinkley, and Grey Delisle as Daphne Blake as well as Wonder Woman.\n\nAlso featured in the voice cast are P.J. Byrne as J.B., Victoria Grace as Mercy, Charles Halford as Lex Luthor, Nolan North as the Joker and Superman, Tara Strong as Helen, Lois Lane and Harley Quinn, Fred Tatasciore as Solomon Grundy and Perry White, James Arnold Taylor as Jimmy Olsen and Rex Ruthor and Niccole Thurman as Mayor Fleming.\n\nCecilia Aranovich Hamilton directs Scooby-Doo! and Krypto, Too! from a script by T.K. O’Brian. The movie's producers include Rick Morales and Jim Krieg (The Death and Return of Superman). Sam Register serves as Executive Producer.\n\nThe movie's special features will include three bonus Scooby-Doo episodes:\n\n- The Scooby of a Thousand Faces!\n\n- What a Night, for a Dark Knight!\n\n- One Minute Mysteries!” Guest Starring The Flash\n\nAlong with that DVD release, Scooby-Doo! and Krypto, Too! will be available on September 26 to purchase Digitally from Amazon Prime Video, AppleTV, Google Play, Vudu and more. You can watch the trailer for the movie below."
