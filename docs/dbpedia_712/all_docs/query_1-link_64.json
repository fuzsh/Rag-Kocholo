        "text": "The early 20th century saw the birth of a new artistic medium: cartoon animation. A revolutionary unification of art and technology, cartoon animation was seen as the medium through which artists could bring their paintings and graphic designs to life. In this article, the second of an ARTUNER series surveying the history of cartoons, we will explore how cartoon animation, as an artistic movement and technological marvel, developed during the early 20th century.\n\nThe photographic tools developed in the last decades of the 19th century revolutionised the photographic visual experience and set the stage for early cartoon animation. One example of this was the invention of the frame by frame filmstrip, which emerged out of the photographic experimentation of Ottomar Anschütz, Eadward Muybridge, and Étienne-Jules Marey. Marey’s development of chronophotography was especially impactful. Though intended solely for analytic scientific research, the geometric tessellation of his photographs inspired Marcel Duchamp to create his cubo-futuristic piece Nude Descending a Staircase and invoked the cinematic illusions of popular spectacles such as Fantasmagoria.\n\nCreated by French cartoonist Émile Cohl, Fantasmagoria was first shown during the summer of 1908, in Paris. It lasted for less than two minutes. In the film, the artist’s hand appears and speedily draws a clown swinging from a bar. Drawn to life, the clown lets go of the bar, which drops down to form a box. The film continues along this vein. One of the first animated films, it was preceded only by J. Stuart Blackton’s stop-motion cartoon Humorous Phases of Funny Faces in 1906. Though the cinematography is choppy, these films illustrated how cartoon characters are imbued with a type of magical naturalism that, when brought to life, posses a type of tragic comicality. Indeed, animation was a world of life without humans. Unbounded from the laws that restrict human existence, objects came to life of their own accord. Animals spoke or re-created the social, materialistic community that humans thought was reserved for them alone.\n\nAfter Fantasmagoria, Cohl worked with Éclair studios on the animation of a comic strip called The Newlyweds. For these ‘drawings that move’ the studio coined the term ‘animated cartoons.’ A competitive and international market, the phenomenon of animation was, during its early years, continually reinvented and transformed. In 1913, Raoul Barré invented a peg system, which allowed drawings to be easily registered. He also developed the slash system with Bill Nolan wherein the foreground character was cut out, obliterating the need to constantly redraw repeated elements of the background. In 1914 John Randolph Bray patented the use of printed background scenes and the application of grey shades. In 1915, Earl Hurd introduced the notion of cell system, which became the dominant mode of cartoon production by the mid-1920s. As much an art form as it was profitable market and form of entertainment, animation became one of the most popular mediums of cinematic expression.\n\nOne of the most fastidious artists of early animation was Winsor McCay. An artist and illustrator for the Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, McCay based his first film off of one of his most popular comic strips Little Nemo.\n\nProduced in 1911, the film shows characters Flip and Impie moving fluidly through various bodily distortions. As each drawing, prior to being photographed, was checked on a mutoscope-like device for smoothness, McCay’s early animation tends to be much more seamless and realistic than other early, animated films. The graceful movements of his characters can be seen not only in Little Nemo, but also in Gertie, The Centaurs, and How a Mosquito Operates, to name a few. One of his later films, The Sinking of Lusitania, was a cartoon that imitated the rhythm of newsreels; 25,000 drawings depicting the final hours of an ocean steamer sunk by a German submarine. At 25 minutes in length, it was the longest animation thus far.\n\nIn 1915, the Out of the Inkwell series began. Created by the Fleischers, who invented the rotoscope, the program was about a clown called Ko-Ko, who always began the show by exiting from an inkwell. Ko-Ko knew that he was made of ink—the plot of his show often involving his struggle for corporeal existence. Typically, the show started with the animator’s hand drawing Ko-Ko from a few inkblots and Max Fleischer would be seen at work in his studio. Conscious that the medium was part of the entertainment, the episodes often combined social satire with reflections on the relationship between animator, studio, and figures. With its title evoking the image of pen-and-ink drawings, this series of animated cartoons conjured a picture of individualistic creativity signifying an unproblematic trajectory from newsprint to moving picture.\n\nIn 1928, Paul Terry made a film called Dinnertime which was synchronised to music. It was obvious to many that animation had a particular affinity to sound and music. Music and film both move through time, but in cartooning, with its frame-by-frame fully controllable structure, the links between sound and image could be drawn so tightly that a symbiosis, a perfect rhythmic synchronisation, could occur. This marriage between music and cartoons was not exclusive to cartoon animation, nor was Paul Terry the first to utilise such a technique. As the year 1913 saw the birth of cartoon animation from McCay and others, so too did it see the commencement of abstract animations from artists such as Léopold Survage. To be sure, pieces like his Colored Rhythms inaugurated a whole new genus of animations whose alternate conventionality incited some artists to discard their oil paint and canvases in order to create films.\n\nIn 1921, German painter Walter Ruttman fused film with avant-garde art to devise something he called abstract ‘absolute’ animations. Meanwhile Dadaists George Grosz and Otto Dix, fascinated by the paradoxically abstract and naturalistic nature of cartoons—their strong outlines, geometrically humanistic forms, and inherent flatness—exchanged their painterly expressions for cartoons on canvas and paper. In 1917-19, Grosz drew a cartoon of Oscar Panizza’s funeral. In the drawing, a skeleton is emerging from a coffin into chaos of architecture world and half-animal, half-human creatures.\n\nSimilarly, Otto Dix’s painting The Matchseller includes a dialogue inside a comic strip bubble that recalls William Randolph Heart’s early, pre-1918, comic strips. In these pieces one sees a discussion forming between artists concerning how one should represent the modern world and how, through that representation, to destroy its apparent coherence. This trifold interplay between cartoons, animation, and ‘modern’ art created a multidisciplinary platform upon which were founded such memorable partnerships as that of Salvador Dali and Walt Disney."
