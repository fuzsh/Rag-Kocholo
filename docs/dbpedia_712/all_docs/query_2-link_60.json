        "text": "The Scooby Gang is back!\n\nScooby fans have a brand new original animated movie to look forward to this September. “Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo Meets Courage The Cowardly Dog.” This canine comedy takes the Scooby Gang to a strange place called Nowhere, Kansas where they will have to put their investigative skills to work when they discover a strange object right in the hometown of another favorite pup, Courage the Cowardly Dog.\n\nBefore they know it, they are face to face with a monster-sized cicada and her winged warriors. Thankfully Scooby has the help of Fred, Velma, Daphne, and Shaggy to uncover the mystery. Not only are there creepy-crawlies, but the house is filled with some scary staff members, horrifying hallways, and, of course, giant sandwiches to fuel our favorite sleuths.\n\nThe film was directed by Cecilia Aranovich, written by Mike Ryan, and the voice talents will certainly sound familiar. It features the familiar voice talents of Frank Welker as Scooby-Doo/Fred Jones, Grey Griffin as Daphne Blake, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy Rogers, and Kate Micucci as Velma Dinkley. The film also features Jeff Bergman as Eustice Bagge, Marty Grabstein as Courage the Cowardly Dog, and Thea White as Muriel Bagge.\n\nStill hungy for more? This digital download includes bonus episodes called “Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! Decoy for a Dognapper,” The “Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour, The Gruesome Game of the Gator Ghoul,” and The “Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour, Chiller Diller Movie Thriller.”\n\nWarner Bros. Animation is known for its projects such as “Animaniacs,” “Green Eggs and Ham,” “Aquaman: King of Atlantis,” “Batman: Caped Crusader,” “Harley Quinn,” the new “Jellystone” series, and so many more. This new animated film will be available on Digital and DVD Sept. 14, 2021, for $14.99 (US) and $19.99 (Canada). It will be available to download on Amazon Video, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and others.\n\nWritten by Colleen Bement\n\nLynn Makes\n\nHi, I’m Lynn, and I Make.\n\nProps, Cosplay, Scale Models, Home Projects, and just about anything else that involves me Making.\n\nEvan Conroy\n\nLayne Primal\n\nRon Peterson"
