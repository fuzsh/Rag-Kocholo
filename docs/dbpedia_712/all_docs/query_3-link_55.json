        "text": "Since the release of Scooby-Doo, Freddie has appeared in a bunch of TV shows and movies. You'll probably remember seeing him in the sequel, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, as well as Freddie, Boston Legal, 24 and Delgo. More recently, he's appeared in Star Wars Rebels and Punky Brewster. Oh, and yes, he and Sarah Michelle Gellar are still happily married!\n\nFun fact: Freddie has voiced several characters in video games like Mass Effect 3 and Dragon Age: Inquisition.\n\nShortly after the movie, Sarah starred in Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, The Grudge franchise, Ringer, All My Children and The Crazy Ones. She also voiced characters in American Dad!, The Simpsons and Star Wars Rebels.\n\nFun fact: Sarah co-founded a cooking and lifestyle company called Foodstirs and released a cookbook, Stirring Up Fun With Food — that was co-authored with her friend, Gia Russo.\n\nNo one has played a better Shaggy than Matthew (we stan!!!) — so it was great to see him not only reprise his role in Scooby-Doo 2, but continue to voice the character in countless other movies, TV shows and video games. He's also delved into other roles, appearing in Without A Paddle, The Descendants, Trouble With The Curve, Twin Peaks and Good Girls.\n\nFun fact: Matthew is a HUGE Dungeons & Dragons fan. He even set up a gaming company alongside some friends called Beadle & Grimm’s Pandemonium Warehouse, which specialises in D&D accessories, special editions and more.\n\nOh my god, I just need a moment to say how much I adore Linda Cardellini. She's fantastic in everything that she does, but also looks like the sort of person you could befriend in an instant.\n\nMoving past that, Linda has a hefty — and I mean hefty — resume. She's probably best known for her work in ER, Bloodline, Mad Men and Dead To Me (which both earned her Emmy nominations), as well as her film performances in Daddy's Home, Green Book, Return and the Avengers movies. Plus, she also voiced characters in Regular Show and Gravity Falls.\n\nFun fact: When auditioning for the role of Velma in Scooby-Doo, Linda showed up in costume. In an interview with Rolling Stone, she said: \"I studied the cartoons. I pulled my hair back — I made like a faux bob. I borrowed someone's glasses. I went to Ross and I bought a skirt and a turtleneck.\" It's no wonder she got the part because that sounds iconic.\n\nShortly after appearing in Scooby-Doo, Rowan Atkinson starred in Johnny English, as well as its sequels. He also had parts in Love Actually and Keeping Mum — and reprised the much-loved character of Mr Bean in Mr Bean's Holiday.\n\nFun fact: On the subject of Mr Bean, Rowan appeared as the character in a sketch that was part of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London.\n\nBack then, the part of Mary Jane was part of Isla's transition to Hollywood from Australia. Since then, she's made a name for herself through roles in Wedding Crashers, Confessions Of A Shopaholic, The Great Gatsby, Arrested Development, Bachelorette and Now You See Me. She also voiced characters in Horton Hears A Who!, Rango and Rise Of The Guardians. Oh, and she's married to fellow actor, Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\nFun fact: Isla is the author of Marge In Charge, a series of successful children's books that were inspired by the stories she tells her kids at bedtime."
