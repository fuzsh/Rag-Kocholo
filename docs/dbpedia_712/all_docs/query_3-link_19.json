        "text": "Happy Happy Joy Joy Let's talk about a time before everyone had a smartphone permanently attached to their palm – the golden age of Saturday morning cartoons on a CRT TV. And who could forget the reigning kings of chaotic humor: Ren & Stimpy? Those guys were like a fever dream fueled by sugar cereal and Nickelodeon's questionable programming choices. for some reason, that show resonated with my 9-year-old self in a way nothing else did.Maybe it was the animation style – the way those characters contorted like melted cheese in a microwave. Maybe it was the humor – a bizarre blend of slapstick, gross-out gags, and moments that genuinely made you think (okay, maybe not that last one). Whatever it was, Ren & Stimpy mesmerized me like no other show at the time. I used to draw their characters for hours, recording the show on VCR and then stopping the video to sketch the scene. I loved it so much that a few years later o bought the entire series on DVD’s which has weird al in the commentary section which made it even better. My love for the show was recognized by my friends and they got me an original cel which I love and have till this day. But Ren & Stimpy's influence goes beyond a dusty cel. That childhood passion for animation has stayed with me. Who knows, maybe it's why I find myself spending hours these days hunched over a digital canvas, creating my own wacky characters (minus the melted cheese, hopefully). Looking back, Ren & Stimpy wasn't just a cartoon; it was a spark that ignited a lifelong love for animation.\n\nImage: Paramount Earlier in the week, we got our first look at Transformers One, and it probably didn’t look like what you were imagining. The animated movie, which is meant to serve as an origin story for Optimus Prime (Chris Hemsworth) and Megatron (Brian Tyree Henry)—here respectively known as Orion Pax and D-16—is sillier than expected, and predates the Autobot/Decepticon war that serves as the franchise’s foundation. If you’re on the fence after that trailer, director Josh Cooley’s here to assuage your concerns, and also give some more insight into how the movie will serve its characters. The Real Ghostbusters Toys With Fantastic Fright Features are Back! Talking to IGN, Cooley explained that the trailer’s comedy focus was in part to help audiences “fall in love with [Orion and D-16] as brothers and friends” before things hit the fan. “They’re from the same generation and have a very tight relationship,” he continued, “[and] something happens on their planet that they both have two different reactions to. By the end of this film, there’s some serious stakes.” In D-16’s case, those stakes involve treating him like he’s not automatically booked to be a villain. Cooley described the future Megatron as someone who should be “very real and fully rounded. D-16 takes [things] to a place, just a lot of anger, but you understand why.” With Henry’s insight, the team ensured that audiences would relate to D-16 and get where he was coming from before an undescribed event changes his outlook on Cybertron in ways that lead to a “natural split” with Orion. Cooley hopes that before the credits roll, fans and newcomers will view D-16 and Orion’s conflict as a very real and tragic split between old friends. As for Orion, he’s described by Cooley as someone who’s driven, but doesn’t always put the drive to its best use. He’ll have to discover how to earn the name Optimus Prime, and what being Optimus Prime really even means. “Like anybody else, there is a level of maturity that we don’t have unless we’ve gone through something. […] We’re really taking these characters to heart and treating them with the respect that they deserve and knowing where they’re going to end up. It’s just seeing how they get there.” Transformers One comes to theaters on September 20. Want more io9 news?

Polygon: \"Jim Henson’s kids explain why Dark Crystal and Labyrinth would never get made today. And how The Jim Henson Company is still doing puppets in a CG-standard world\" (Susana Polo) (Feb 20, 2024) (excerpt): \"Lisa Henson, producer and CEO of The Jim Henson Company and daughter of Jim Henson, says there’s one reason she encounters the company may never replicate the cult success of Labyrinth or The Dark Crystal. “Technique-wise, these movies would be very hard to get mae [today, because there’s so much pressure to do things with CG.” The making of The Dark Crystal in 1981 was an inflection point for Hollywood special effects, as a group of prop makers, puppeteers, artists, and designers came together to build the world of Thra and all its characters and creatures. Later organized under the name “Jim Henson’s Creature Shop,” the group moved on to the production of Labyrinth, and from there to working on a swath of Henson and third-party productions, on the forefront of a revolution in physical special effects. “In the height of the animatronics era, and visual effects known as animatronics, which was the late ’80s and ’90s almost all those techniques were pioneered in The Dark Crystal. I remember actually being in a meeting,” Lisa recalled, “where they were trying to figure out what titles to put in the credits for people that did that kind of work for The Dark Crystal, and they found a union category of animatronics and they were like, Oh, all right, well, we’ll just call it animatronics. I was actually in that room laughs. Prior to that, animatronics was what happened at Disney World.” “That was what was fun about being in London in those days,” said Brian. “I was so young, I was in my early 20s when I got to London, I think I was 20 when I did Return to Oz, and it was so fun because we were in an industry where teams of people could move from one movie to the next doing these incredible creature effects. And each one was a little bit different. The reason why we kept making [odd fantasy films] is because that’s where everybody was — in London. You want to make a fantasy, you go to London to make it. Nowhere else in the world are you going to find the people who could do it.” In the years since the 1980s, animatronics and physical creature effects have given way to computer-generated imagery as Hollywood’s first option. With the pressure to use CG, says Lisa, comes temptation. Both Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal had fully realized fantasy worlds, but the limitations of their technology encouraged a smaller focus. “You can do anything in CG. Now every movie has a third act that is so jam-packed with action, and the world coming to an end, and cataclysmic occurrences every five minutes. We just couldn’t do that in the ’80s. So those films have a little more intimacy to them.” (keep reading) Polygon: https://lnkd.in/gYe2yA7n #filmindustry #puppets #jimhenson\n\n𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗜 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗦𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗕𝘆 𝗡𝗼𝘄: Entry 6 𝗝𝗨𝗠𝗔𝗡𝗝𝗜 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱: 1995 by Sony 𝗗𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿: Joe Johnston 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴: Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Bonnie Hunt 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵: Netflix 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Two sets of kids are lured into playing a magical board game.

The longtime icon and mascot of the Walt Disney Company, Mickey is an anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large shoes, and white gloves. What made Mickey Mouse so popular? How 'Steamboat Willie' Debuted Mickey Mouse's 'Everyman ... “When asked why Mickey was so popular, Walt once said, 'when people laugh at Mickey Mouse it's because he's so human; and that is the secret of his popularity,'” she added. “He struggles with life as we all do, but uses his innate sense of optimism to overcome all obstacles and has a wonderful time while doing so. https://lnkd.in/dHcQDKSp. As I mentioned before when I read \"Gardner's Art Through the Ages\" I saw she mentioned one of the most powerful \"Visoul power\" is using animals like humans that reason when we went to the museums we saw lots of \"animals painting\" like animals mixed with human or behavior like a human. Let's see when we give power to a company like \"Walt Disney\" which is directly related to the age we said the personality of our children create. it is true lots of nice definitions we found in the Walt Disney story ,but besides there is more side effect we didn't see for a long time. And what should we do next? Is the world of stories powerful enough that we reconsider Walt Disney effection on our society?"
