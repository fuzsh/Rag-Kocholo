        "text": "Director Key\n\nRC - Robert Clampett / AD - Arthur Davis / FF - Friz Freleng\n\nCJ - Chuck Jones / NM - Norm McCabe / RM - Robert McKimson\n\nFT - Frank Tashlin\n\nAdditional years following the directors' credits indicate when black and white cartoons were colorized. The 1968 process involved tracing every other frame or so, coloring them in by hand, and then reshooting them over colorized copies of the backgrounds, essentially creating a very stilted, ugly final film. The 1990s process involved a computer adding color to the original animation. A number of the black and white cartoons are in the public domain, but for some reason public domain video releases have also used the 1968 versions, even though those are still copyrighted by Warner Bros. For video releases that are listed, titles without an asterisk include the original black and white version, while titles with an asterisk include the 1990s version. The 1968 versions, meanwhile, have never been officially released on home video (see below for public domain explanation).\n\nThe notation BR following the directors' credits indicates a color cartoon that was reissued in the studio's \"Blue Ribbon\" series. From 1943 to 1956, the process involved removing the individual shorts' title and credits sequence, replacing them with a uniform title card at the end of the standard Warner Bros. bullseye opening. Only very recently has Warner Bros. started restoring these cartoons with their original title sequences. For video releases that are listed, titles with two asterisks include the original print of the cartoon with its original title sequence.\n\nVideo titles in red are out of print. Titles in black or presented as entire ordering links are still in print. Links will go to the releases' respective product pages on Amazon. Since most out-of-print titles are offered either new or used by Amazon's individual sellers, order links are provided for most (just click on the video's release information). We also recommend eBay for your out-of-print needs. When you shop online for older videos, do take caution and know exactly what you are buying, as many sellers usually aren't sure what they're selling!\n\nShorts with the phrase PUBLIC DOMAIN in their synopses are (obviously enough) shorts that are in the public domain and can be found on many ultra-budget video releases produced by unheard-of fly-by-night companies. Since it would be futile to track down and list every single public domain video release, we have listed a very scant number of key releases to help point you in the right direction. A few public domain video releases use film prints that may be unintentionally missing scenes. We will do our best to note such edited versions. And again do note that for black and white cartoons that are in the public domain, some video releases have instead used the 1968 colorized versions.\n\nAll releases listed here are in the NTSC color format, the North American standard. All titles are VHS unless noted.\n\nJump to the guide\n\nor select a specific short...."
