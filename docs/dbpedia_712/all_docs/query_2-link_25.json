        "text": "Back when I was a duckling, I had fond memories of watching only one animated Scooby-Doo movie, Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island from 1998. It was surprisingly scary and more fun than a whole box full of Scooby Snacks! Many years later, Mother Duck and I decided it would be entertaining to seek out even more Scooby-Doo movies and see how they stack up against Zombie Island, which I have since learned is basically the king of Scooby movies. While reading this ranking, please keep in mind 2 important things. 1: As an adult, I am definitely not the target demographic of these movies. And 2: These are not all the animated Scooby-Doo movies, just the ones we were most easily able to watch.\n\n14: Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School (1988) – This one is quite different from the others on this list, in that it only stars Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy, and it doesn’t involve the usual mystery that the Scooby-Doo franchise is known for. Our starring trio has been hired as gym teachers at Miss Grimwood’s Finishing School for Girls. It turns out, there are only five students. And what’s even stranger is that they are all monsters inspired by the classic Universal Monster movies, with the daughters of: Dracula, whoever the heck Frankenteen is, the Wolfman, the Mummy, and a random phantom, I guess. While I was initially worried about the inclusion of Scrappy, he was actually a cute addition to the team, with an upbeat attitude and the only one with any degree of intelligence.\n\nThis movie just really drags out, and it would have benefited from being closer to 70 minutes like other Scooby-Doo movies and not 90. The story is uninteresting, the movie is full of awful puns (I would have loved a pun counter in the upper corner), and many of the girls had annoying voices. Winnie the werewolf was the absolute worst, while Elsa Frankenteen and the vampire Sibella were just mildly annoying. Tanis the mummy was the least aggravating of the bunch, and I strangely didn’t mind Phantasma, either, whose insane giggles kind of made her more endearing than irritating. While many animated Scooby-Doo movies can be watched by nostalgic adults who grew up with the series, I think this movie is mainly going to be enjoyed by kids only. Since I heard that Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers (1987) and Scooby-Doo! and the Reluctant Werewolf (1988) are of a similar caliber, Mother Duck and I decided to skip those, for the sake of our own sanity.\n\n13: Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire (2003) – For me, one of the biggest draws of spooky movies AND mysteries is the surrounding atmosphere. This one takes place in the Australian Outback, which is exactly where you’d expect a vampire movie to take place (sarcasm!). Taking a common horror trope and placing it in a unique setting isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but this movie suffers in several areas. First off, I really wasn’t a fan of the whole rock concert theme, and the design for the monster, which is called the Yowie Yahoo (how can I be afraid of something with “Yahoo” in the name?), looks absolutely absurd, with big ol’ bugged out eyes. I read that this is the first Scooby-Doo movie to aim for a lighter tone, and for me, that just didn’t work, especially when there wasn’t anything else to really catch my interest.\n\n12: Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico (2003) – This one was…strange. The opening credits were the laziest out of the whole bunch, with a black background and green eyes swooping in repeatedly. And the first portion of the movie was super slow-paced, including an early scene where the gang were literally shown reading emails out loud. The plot revolves around Scooby and the gang visiting Fred’s pen pal in Mexico, Alejo, and their subsequent adventure to solve the mystery behind El Chupacabra. Which is basically portrayed as Bigfoot, which is as inaccurate as claiming that Dia de los Muertos is the Mexican version of Halloween. (Please do your research next time, Warner Bros.) The middle of the movie is adequate, but in addition to the slow pacing of the early scenes, I also found the later portions of the movie to be really weird, including a whole bunch of filler where the gang are chased around either by these robots or these tourists who have apparently been convinced that they were vandals, which made very little sense. I feel like they didn’t have enough decent ideas to really make a full-length movie and just added as much padding as they could.\n\n11: Aloha, Scooby-Doo! (2005) – Scooby and the gang go to Hawaii, where a local surfing contest is being interrupted by the Wiki-Tiki spirit and its army, who have also kidnapped the girlfriend of pro surfer, Manu. The setting was pretty fun in this particular movie, but it was very obvious from the start who was behind everything, and the explanation for the Wiki-Tiki’s army of minions seemed a bit far-fetched, even by Scooby-Doo standards. Since I don’t have much else to say about this one, I at least want to end this super brief review by mentioning a rather terrible pun I came up with when Scooby and Shaggy were trying to distract the Wiki-Tiki while dressed as luau dancers. Due to a certain article of clothing Scooby was wearing, I decided to call him…Scooby Booby Doo. I’m sorry, I’ll leave now. Actually, I won’t. We have a lot of reviews left to get to.\n\n10: Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase (2001) – This particular Scooby movie revolves around a video game that’s in development and a fancy-pants laser that can somehow transport real objects into the cyber world. Unfortunately, it can also do the same in reverse, allowing a strange virus to beam into the real world! In the process of investigating a mystery that was stretching my suspension of disbelief rather thin (it’s only a kid’s movie, it’s only a kid’s movie), the gang end up transported into the game, where they must face off against the virus and its goons in various challenges, whether it be in outer space, the Roman coliseum, or prehistoric times. I wasn’t a big fan of the design for the virus, which I felt was more dorky than threatening, and the variety of locations present in the game-world merely led to silly antics that might entertain kids, but not my jaded adult self. My favorite part of the movie was the final location of the game, which really plays on the nostalgia of long-time fans. I won’t spoil it, but I would have preferred an entire movie centered around that instead of what we got…a movie that felt like an episode that they had dragged out for 75 minutes.\n\n9: Scooby-Doo! and the Goblin King (2008) – This movie was a weird one, but it would be a great option for Halloween. At the Coolsville Halloween carnival, Scooby and Shaggy expose a rather rude magician “The Amazing Krudsky” as a fraud (never diss Scooby and Shaggy or they’ll ruin you). As a result, the guy seeks vengeance by gaining real magical powers! Like I said, this isn’t your average Scooby movie, as it doesn’t have a mystery, and the rest of the gang are barely present, with Scooby and Shaggy being the main heroes. Nevertheless, this movie was pretty entertaining, the humor was decent, the creativity was pretty good, and we even have a cool chase scene where our cowardly heroes are pursued by the headless horseman!\n\n8: Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders (2000) – Scooby and the gang end up in a small town, which is being plagued by UFO sightings. The humor in this one was a bit better than others we had seen, and the alien theme ended up being more interesting than I expected. There’s also a cheesy love story between Shaggy and a photographer, along with some minor romance between their respective doggies. I strangely don’t have much to say about this one; it’s just average, not the best movie on the list, but not bad, either.\n\n7: Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster (2004) – As you’d expect, this movie takes place in Scotland, where Scooby and the gang travel to visit Daphne’s cousin, Shannon, at Blake Castle, the home of Daphne’s Scottish ancestors. The setting and humor were decent, including a scene where the perpetually hungry Scooby and Shaggy find a meal they won’t touch in the form of haggis. Unfortunately, Mother Duck and I were unable to fully finish this one because we watched it on Youtube, and several chunks from the ending were missing. Nevertheless, we still enjoyed watching the gang’s search for the Loch Ness Monster. Although there’s nothing terribly special about this movie, it’s still a perfectly fun watch, even if there are plenty of better Scooby movies.\n\n6: Scooby-Doo! Music of the Vampire (2012) – In this movie, the gang visit a vampire festival, where the supposed vampire Lord Valdronya wakes up from his casket after 1000 years asleep. As expected from the title, this movie is a musical, and while the songs are…okay, it’s not really my thing. Nevertheless, as is the case with a lot of Scooby movies from this era, the humor is pretty decent, and I especially liked Fred and Daphne’s portrayals in this one (considering these two are often pretty bland characters in many other Scooby movies). The scene where Shaggy thinks he was bitten by a vampire, and Scooby refuses to leave his side is rather sweet, as well. Plus, the monster in this one looked fairly decent, and the mystery was explained pretty well, which isn’t always the case.\n\n5: Big Top Scooby-Doo! (2012) – Scooby and the gang head to Atlantic City and end up sidetracked by the Brancusi Circus, which is being terrorized by a werewolf. The gang end up disguising themselves as circus performers in order to investigate the mystery. And circus-related shenanigans ensure. I didn’t think I’d like this one because of the circus theme (because, y’know…clowns), but this was a surprisingly funny entry into the Scooby-Doo franchise. There’s even a clown who communicates entirely by honking a horn, which is surprisingly amusing, despite, y’know…clowns. Nevertheless, I have three complaints. One, the mystery wasn’t great in this one. The reveal was worse than that of the Aloha movie, and certain details still didn’t make sense even once everything was explained. Two, I feel like the circus setting could have inspired a better monster than a generic werewolf. And three, the characters were portrayed a bit strangely in this one. Velma seemed extra grumpy, Fred was treated like he’s an idiot, and there was some dumb conflict between Scooby and Shaggy where Shaggy is uncharacteristically a jerk. As a bonus complaint, I also find it odd that Shaggy doesn’t believe Australia exists when he literally went there in the 2003 movie, Legend of the Vampire. Still an entertaining one, despite all my complaining.\n\n4: Scooby-Doo! and the Witch’s Ghost (1999) – Scooby and the gang are invited to Oakhaven, Massachusetts by horror writer Ben Ravencroft, who is not pleased when he finds out that the townspeople have created a tourist attraction there, with one of the main draws being the ghost of his ancestor, Sarah Ravencroft, who was accused of witchcraft and executed roughly 400 years prior. The setting is good, there’s a decent plot twist, and the humor is adequate. I think the worst thing for me was the movie’s ending, which seemed like it was going to be a more dangerous and climactic affair, but quickly devolved into silly antics that dragged on for too long.\n\n3: Scooby-Doo! Camp Scare (2010) – Mother Duck and I really enjoyed this one, in which Scooby and the gang visit Camp Little Moose, where Fred used to go for summer camp as a kid. This movie has three monsters, all of which are actually rather scary and have a good design. I enjoyed the summer camp setting (which included a flooded town, which was cool), the humor wasn’t bad, and there was a decent plot twist, as well. Definitely give this one a watch! (As this was one of the earlier movies we watched, I neglected to take as many notes as I did with later movies, so I don’t remember anything else…)\n\n2: Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur (2011) – This one opens with poor Shaggy becoming so terrified that he can’t stop screaming. After visiting the doctor, it’s decided that he can’t participate in any scary mystery-solving anymore. As a result, he is hypnotized into being braver, leading to a few scenes where I finally learn the backstory behind all those jokes on the internet about Shaggy being some sort of super-warrior. I really believed people had just made this up because the idea of cowardly Shaggy beating people up was funny. But no, it came from this movie, and that’s a large reason why this particular film is ranked so high in my list. Because Shaggy single handedly beating the snot out of a biker gang is just too amazing! Plus, this movie had some genuinely funny jokes, especially for a kids’ movie. Oh yeah, and there’s also a giant phantom dinosaur, which is pretty cool, too, I guess."
