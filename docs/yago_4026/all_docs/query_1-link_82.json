        "text": "The erratic behaviour of the male lead – who had brought his children and his wife, the artist Janet Templeton, with him – wasn’t helping matters. Sheen was drinking heavily during the shoot. The film’s legendary opening sequence in a Saigon hotel room depicts his character, army assassin Capt Benjamin Willard – alone, dangerous and emotional – smashing his fist through a mirror and smearing his face with blood. Sheen didn’t have to act so much: it was his 36th birthday, and he was very drunk.\n\n'I hated him when he got drunk, because he’d get violent,’ recalls Estevez, who had a combative relationship with his father. 'Some of it he may remember, some of it he may not. But, yeah, it was horrible. And because I was the oldest, it was always directed at me. But I think the Philippines was the last physical fight we had. The older I got, I started lifting weights and getting stronger, so\n\n'My father and mother, neither of them cared if Larry Fishburne [Sheen’s teenage co-star] and I jumped in a jitney and went to Manila for the weekend. President Marcos was in power, martial law was in effect, and you were shot on sight if you were seen on the street after 1am. What were they thinking?’ He says he recently asked his parents that very question. Their reply was, 'We had four of you. If we had to lose one, we would. We were just trying to survive.’\n\nThe Way is about an uptight father, Tom (played by Sheen), trying to reconnect with his restless son, Daniel (Estevez, who also wrote and directed the film). The younger man, a loner and inveterate backpacker (in his father’s eyes a slacker), dies in a storm while trying to walk the Camino de Santiago, the pilgrimage across the Pyrenees in northern Spain.\n\nTom, a dentist who had waved off Daniel with pointed misgivings about what his son was doing with his life, travels from America to collect the body. Once in Spain he decides to honour Daniel’s memory by completing the 500-mile trek himself, Daniel’s ashes in his backpack. Along the way, he is joined by three ad-hoc travelling companions, all also looking for meaning or fulfilment in their lives: a troubled Canadian woman, an overweight Dutch stoner and a frustrated Irish writer (played by James Nesbitt). And he is forced to look deeply at his own character, his outlook and his lack of faith – all fuelled by visions of his dead son.\n\nSheen, who is still married to Templeton, has been sober for 20 years and is now a devout Catholic, having had his faith restored by a series of meaningful conversations in Paris in 1981 with Terrence Malick, the director of Sheen’s breakthrough film, Badlands (1973). For Sheen, making The Way has been particularly gratifying. 'The whole journey is about showing our brokenness,’ he says. 'It’s about opening up and being human. And that’s what spirituality really is. It’s humanity.’\n\nFor Estevez, the film has been a personal experience that extends beyond working with his father. His paternal grandfather came from Galicia, the Spanish region in which the pilgrimage ends. His own son, Taylor, 26, drove the length of the Camino in 2003 with his grandfather, Sheen – on the way, Taylor met the woman who would become his wife; he now lives in the city of Burgos, located on the route.\n\nSheen had originally suggested that they make a low-budget documentary about the Camino. 'I said to him that that wasn’t really interesting to me,’ Estevez says. 'I thought we could make it a bigger experience. So I said, let’s scale this thing up.’\n\nBack home in California, Estevez began writing a script, exploring the universal themes of loss, community and faith, and started to see parallels with another great film odyssey. He cribbed some characterisation from a neighbour, a Dutch friend who was 'wonderful but out of his mind. That’s our Cowardly Lion. Because essentially this is a retelling of The Wizard of Oz – Martin is Dorothy, trying to get “home”. The Canadian woman he meets has a broken heart, so she’s the Tin Man. And we meet Jimmy’s character in the hayfield, without a brain, because he’s got writer’s block. Which is something I knew about.’\n\nDid he consider any other actor for the lead role? 'Dad wanted me to. He said, “You ought to go to Michael Douglas. You’re not going to get this movie made with me.” But I said, “I’m only making this movie with you.” Then he said, “Mel Gibson should play this part.” I said, “You are playing this role. Stop.” That’s the level of his generosity.’\n\nWhen I asked James Nesbitt for his recollections of the shoot, he suggested that it must have been difficult for Estevez to work with his father, because Sheen would stop and talk to everybody he met on the Camino. Estevez laughs heartily at this. 'It was a nightmare,’ he says. 'My dad never met anybody he didn’t like. He was playing a very conservative guy. Very cut off, not necessarily the friendliest guy. So [the role] was against his better instincts. I had to keep reminding him, “Hey, man, you’re not happy to see this Dutchman, you don’t want this woman to tag along, and Jimmy’s a pain in the ass. You don’t want these people ruining your Camino.” But Martin loves to clown, he loves to tell stories, and he loves to give an autograph to anybody who asks. Meanwhile, we had a movie to make. So it was a distraction. But how do you change who somebody is? I just had to bring him back on track when we were rolling.’\n\nSheen and Estevez have come a long way, personally and professionally, from those family breakdowns in the jungle. Today, they have returned to Santiago de Compostela, where I interview them, separately, in a monastery converted into a hotel. This is the glorious town whose 900-year-old cathedral is the Camino’s – and the film’s – end-point, and they are primarily here to drum up local interest (The Way is being released in Spain before anywhere else in the world).\n\nThere is no shortage of interest in Sheen, who has produced some of his best work in his later years. Now regarded as one of the world’s greatest character actors, he is revered for unshowy performances in films such as Martin Scorsese’s The Departed, and for portraying perhaps America’s most-loved president, Josiah Bartlet, in the tele­vision drama The West Wing.\n\nEstevez, too, seems to be enjoying a late-career renaissance. After years of being associated with the Brat Pack films of the mid-1980s – he became a generational icon for his roles in The Breakfast Club and St Elmo’s Fire – he has emerged as a successful writer and director, not least with Bobby, his 2006 semi-biographical account of the last day of the assassinated presidential hopeful Robert Kennedy.\n\nSheen had a small part in Bobby. Initially Estevez wanted his father to play a more pivotal role – the manager of the hotel in which Kennedy was shot. But at the time Sheen was in the thick of filming The West Wing, so a larger part represented too much commitment. 'I didn’t want to risk it,’ Sheen says. 'So he gave me the smallest part he could that still had some contribution [to the story]. And I was very grateful. It was great fun.’\n\nEstevez had directed his father once before, in 1996’s The War at Home, about a Vietnam veteran (played by Estevez) struggling to cope with life back in America. Sheen plays his unsympathetic father. How does Sheen think his son’s ability as a filmmaker has changed over the years? 'He’s always been very impressive,’ he says. 'I came on the set early one day during The War at Home, and he was shooting a scene with Kathy Bates [Sheen’s on-screen wife]…’ Sheen’s voice drops to a grave whisper. 'And I just watched him talking to her, and how she responded to him. I thought, this is one of the great actresses, and look at the way she’s listening to him, and the way he’s instructing her. And she did the scene and it was magnificent.’\n\nSheen admits he was unaware that among the madness of the Apocalypse Now set his teenage son was forging ideas of his own about a career in film. When they returned to Los Angeles, Estevez co-wrote and starred in a high-school play about Vietnam veterans called Echoes of an Era. 'I had no idea that he was interested. I was so interested in myself,’ Sheen says, laughing. 'I didn’t really focus on what [my kids’] needs were, or what their aspirations were. And when he invited us to come see this play, I was astonished. He had this very emotional scene, and the hairs stood up on the back of my neck. And I began to realise: my God, he’s one of us. He had that same deep and personal thing. I thought, ah, he’s cursed.’\n\nBut Sheen says he had faith in Estevez’s ability to plot a steady path through the highs and lows. He remembered thinking, 'He’s fine, he’ll find himself and he’ll lead an honest life. Which is what all of us have to do, but artists particularly. It’s so difficult being in the public eye as you’re working out what you’re going to do and how you’re going do it and why. It’s an effort to unite the will of the spirit with the work of the flesh.’\n\nThis seems an opportune time to mention the elephant in the room. Charlie Sheen, Estevez’s younger brother, has been working his flesh overtime of late. He may have been the highest-paid actor in American TV – he reportedly received as much as $2 million per episode of the sitcom Two and a Half Men – but he is more associated with drug addiction, dalliances with prostitutes, violent marital breakdown and health problems. Last month, Sheen’s increasingly aberrant behaviour – including a clutch of ranting, unhinged interviews in the media – led to the latest season of Two and a Half Men being abruptly cancelled midway through shooting. Sheen was subsequently fired.\n\nEstevez, who kept his father’s original name (as did his other siblings, Ramon and Renée, who are also actors), professes himself to be at a loss as to why his brother has struggled with demons so much more than he has. Charlie is three years his junior and enjoyed great success early in his career, notably in Platoon, released in 1986, when he was 21, and, the following year, in Wall Street. All four children were 'raised under the same roof’ in Malibu on the California coast. 'We all had the same set of rules,’ Estevez says. 'So it really gives credence to this theory that it is genetic, and that sometimes it skips either a generation or siblings. My mother doesn’t drink. My other brother hasn’t had a drink in over 10 years, my dad hasn’t had a drink in 20. And I make wine.’\n\nI ask Martin Sheen if he believes that faith could help Charlie through his problems. 'Faith can help all of us,’ he replies briskly. 'Addiction is the dark side. It’s a reflection of despair. And it’s fed by all the other negativity.’\n\nDoes Charlie listen to his father? 'Every now and then,’ Sheen says. 'Depends on whether it’s a moment of clarity for him. I can’t determine that for him. You know, Charlie’s 45 years old. He’s not a kid. Emotionally he still is. Because when you’re addicted, you don’t grow emotionally. So when you get clean and sober you’re starting at the moment you started using drugs or alcohol. You’re emotionally crippled.\n\n'But I know what hell he’s living in. I’ve had psychotic episodes in public. One of them was on camera – the opening scene of Apocalypse Now. So I know what Charlie is going through. And when you do something like that, that is out of control, that’s the most difficult thing. You have to have courage.’ As he says this, Sheen, usually so vibrant and engaging, seems to slump inwards.\n\nBeautifully and elegantly shot, The Way is a straightforward and moving tale of the bond between father and son, a reconciliation between the generations. In this case, it doesn’t occur on the mortal plane – the bereaved father, closed off emotionally, experiences a gentle conversion to his late son’s free-spirited approach to life. But given the firmly Roman Catholic context, the film wears its religiosity relatively lightly. Sheen is happy to view Estevez’s film as more\n\n'pro-life’ than pro-Catholic. 'Tom is not a practising Catholic, but I think by the end of the film he’s become a believer,’ Sheen says. 'His faith becomes personal. And that’s the most important thing about anyone’s faith: it has to be personal. If it’s impersonal, why bother? It’s useless.’\n\nSheen brushes away any suggestion that he might have tried to convert his son during the shoot. 'No. If you’re going to proselytise, you have to do it with your actions, with your life. I adore Emilio. And God’s presence is very powerful in him. He may think of it otherwise, but I see God’s presence in his humanity and his joy.’\n\nFor his part, Estevez had a more prosaic desire to work with his father. 'I remember when I was a boy my father made choices as an actor that were not necessarily career choices. He made choices to feed the family. And I was old enough to know that. I had seen him on Broadway, I had seen him playing Hamlet. Even at a young age, I thought, this guy’s amazing. But he would do movies that I felt – and what the hell did I know? – were not up to the kind of movies that I wanted to see him in. So I think I’d always wanted to make a movie designed for him that would allow him to give the performance I knew he was capable of.’\n\nMaking The Way has enabled Estevez to forge a path as a writer and filmmaker on his own terms: small crew, low budget, complete control. But what has it done for his relationship with his father? Estevez, normally so quick and eager with an answer, thinks about this before replying. 'I think it afforded my dad an opportunity to play someone who was, on the one side, not close to who he is, but who is, on the other, very, very close and personal to who he is. And for me, there’s a certain gratification in that he nails the role. It is filled with such quiet dignity. And that’s really who my dad is.’"
