        "text": "The War at Home is an intensely moving drama from director and star Emilio Estevez (The Breakfast Club). Assembling a knockout cast of Kathy Bates (Misery), Martin Sheen (Apocalypse Now) and Kimberly Williams (Father of the Bride), it follows a Vietnam War hero (Estevez) whose haunting experiences leave him unable to adjust to the quiet realities of small town life. At odds with his domineering father (Sheen), his desperately cheerful mother (Bates) and free-spirited younger sister (Williams)—tensions at home soon escalate, finally reaching the breaking point one fateful Thanksgiving Day. A heartrending story of one family’s struggle to overcome the past, The War at Home is an unforgettable work of art.\n\nPress & Exhibitors\n\nBelow please find additional information and promotional materials for this film.
