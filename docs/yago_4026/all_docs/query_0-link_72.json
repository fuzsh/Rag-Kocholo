        "text": "Martin Sheen and his wife, Janet Sheen, share four children: Emilio Estevez, Ramon Estevez, Charlie Sheen and Ren√©e Estevez.\n\nHis sons and daughter followed in their footsteps as actors, though Martin says he wasn't part of the decision.\n\n\"I was so self-involved and trying to be a provider that I wasn't aware of their inclination to being actors,\" the Wall Street actor told Closer Weekly in June 2022. \"I was doing a show one time, and Emilio showed up. I thought he was there to visit me, but he'd gotten a part in the same show.\"\n\nHowever, he revealed that he was able to influence his eldest son on one aspect: his name. Martin was born Ram√≥n Antonio Gerardo Est√©vez to a Spanish father and Irish mother but changed his name professionally. When it came to Emilio, Martin encouraged him to keep the family's last name.\n\nAs for fatherhood, The West Wing alum told AP that having \"an honest relationship with a child ... is the greatest gift,\" and adult children also need reassurance.\n\n\"You have to be there for them,\" he said. \"You have to support them and make sure they know that they are still loved and cherished and you‚Äôre still in their lives and you‚Äôre there for them.‚Äù\n\nHere's everything to know about Martin Sheen's children.\n\nEmilio Estevez, 61\n\nMartin and Janet welcomed their first child, Emilio Estevez, on May 12, 1962, in Staten Island, New York. Emilio was raised and attended school in New York City until his family moved to California when Martin was cast in the 1970 film Catch-22.\n\nAs a young teen, he traveled with his father to the Philippines while he filmed the Vietnam War film Apocalypse Now. Once he returned to Los Angeles, Emilio co-wrote and starred in a play called Echoes. Martin reflected on his son's theatrical pursuit during a 2011 interview with The Telegraph, telling the outlet he \"had no idea he was interested\" in acting.\n\n\"I didn't really focus on what [my kids'] needs were, or what their aspirations were. And when he invited us to come see this play, I was astonished,\" Martin said. \"He had this very emotional scene, and the hairs stood up on the back of my neck. And I began to realize: my God, he's one of us. He had that same deep and personal thing. I thought, ah, he's cursed.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, Emilio was part of what was dubbed the Brat Pack in Hollywood ‚Äî a group of young actors who regularly appeared together in coming-of-age movies ‚Äî which also included Molly Ringwald, Rob Lowe and Demi Moore.\n\nEmilio starred in The Outsiders, The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo's Fire before being cast in The Mighty Ducks and its subsequent films in the '90s.\n\nMartin and Emilio have collaborated on several projects during their respective careers, including their 2012 novel Along the Way: The Journey of a Father and Son and the 2010 drama film The Way ‚Äî which also starred Ren√©e.\n\nEmilio talked to PEOPLE Now in April 2019 about what it was like to work with his father, calling it an \"amazing\" experience but not one without its downsides. \"It's also complicated because you know where all the buttons are because you helped build the machine,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, their collaboration was worth it in the father-son department, with Emilio adding, \"But at the end of the day, he said it's the film that he's most proud of and that's a lot coming from him.\"\n\nInitially, their dual memoir Along the Way: The Journey of a Father and Son was meant to be a companion piece to The Way, the Los Angeles Times reported. Plans changed when they \"sat down and started telling the stories and it became a whole other thing.\" Emilio revealed that Martin \"opened up a Pandora's box and I was inspired and terrified concurrently by how much he had said.\"\n\nIn 1992, Estevez married Paula Abdul, but the couple got divorced two years later. He also shares two children from a past relationship with former model Carey Salley: Taylor Levi Est√©vez and Paloma Estevez.\n\nRamon Estevez, 60\n\nOn Aug. 7, 1963, Martin and Janet welcomed their second son Ramon Estevez ‚Äî his father's namesake ‚Äî in N.Y.C.\n\nFrom a young age, Ramon was interested in entertaining and was drawn to acting, singing and dancing, especially idolizing Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. He even performed with Danny Daniel's Dance America Company as a teenager.\n\n\"That was a great experience to be involved in it at that age,\" he told Los Angeles Times in 1991. \"There was so much technique involved. I was too young to realize how difficult it was because it was so much fun.\"\n\nHe began acting in the early 1980s and was often billed as Ramon Sheen for his roles, including 1985's That Was Then... This Is Now and 1987's Turnaround. The rising actor also shared the screen with his dad and younger brother Charlie in the 1990s historical prison film Cadence, which Martin also directed.\n\nIn 2002, Martin and Ramon founded the independent production company Estevez Sheen Productions. Today, Ramon and Charlie run the establishment. Ramon also collaborated with his brother on Anger Management as a co-producer of the sitcom that ran for two seasons from 2012 to 2014 on FX.\n\nWhile little is known about his private life, Ramon has three children from a previous relationship.\n\nCharlie Sheen, 58\n\nCharlie Sheen was born Carlos Estevez on Sept. 3, 1965, in N.Y.C.\n\nThe youngest of Martin and Janet's sons, Charlie stepped into acting as a child, appearing in his father's 1974 made-for-television movie The Execution of Private Slovik. While he attended Santa Monica High School, much like his eldest brother Emilio, he began to express further interest in acting.\n\nIn 1983, Sheen landed a role in the action thriller Grizzly II: The Predator, though the movie wasn't released until 2020. He also appeared in iconic '80s movies, including Red Dawn and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Charlie starred alongside his family, like 1987's Wall Street with his dad and 1989's Young Guns and 1990's Men at Work with his eldest brother Emilio.\n\nBeyond his film career, Charlie starred in several television shows throughout his decades-long acting career. In 2000, he replaced Michael J. Fox's character Mike Flaherty on Spin City for the show's final two seasons.\n\nFor eight years between 2003 and 2011, Charlie starred as the character Charlie Harper on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, a role that earned him two Golden Globe award nominations and one win. Ultimately, his contract was terminated by the studio, and he was replaced by Ashton Kutcher's character, Walden Schmidt.\n\nThe news came on the heels of Charlie making disparaging comments about Two and a Half Men co-creator Chuck Lorre, which he has since said he regrets how he handled the matter. Martin reflected on that period of his son's life during a May 2015 interview with Radio Times, saying he felt \"powerless.\"\n\n\"Except to pray for him and lift him up,‚Äù the dad of four added, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nIn 2017, Charlie revealed on the Today show that he was living with HIV after being diagnosed with the condition four years prior and came forward after he was extorted for \"millions.\"\n\nCharlie's father and eldest brother both spoke out in support of him after he announced his diagnosis. Martin told the Naples Daily News that it was \"the most difficult thing he'd ever done\" but he had his family's encouragement.\n\nThroughout his career, Charlie has been open about his struggles with addiction. He reflected on sobriety on several occasions in recent years, including an interview with Jay Leno in 2019. Earlier that year, ahead of the Super Bowl, Charlie told PEOPLE he had been sober for 14 months and he could \"really focus on my health, my family and work will come next.\"\n\nMartin has spoken out about his son's sobriety, telling PEOPLE (The TV Show!) in 2021 that he's \"always adored\" his son, adding, \"His recovery and his life is a miracle and he's an extraordinary man.\"\n\nCharlie was married three times. He wed actress Donna Peele in 1995, and they divorced the following year. The actor later tied the knot with Denise Richards in 2002 before their split in 2006. The couple welcomed two children: son Sami Sheen and daughter Lola Rose Sheen.\n\nThe Platoon star was also married to Brooke Mueller from 2008 to 2011, and they share twins, Max and Bob Sheen. He is also father to Cassandra Jade Estevez from a previous relationship with Paula Profit.\n\nRen√©e Estevez, 56\n\nMartin and Janet welcomed their youngest child and first daughter, Ren√©e Estevez, in N.Y.C. on April 2, 1967. Much like her parents and three eldest siblings, she pursued a career in entertainment, appearing in several roles in the mid-to-late '80s, including on CBS Schoolbreak Special and MacGyver. She also held minor roles in films like Shattered Spirits and Heathers.\n\nRen√©e has worked on several projects alongside her family. She starred in the 1996 film The War At Home, directed by her brother Emilio and featured their father as part of the cast. She was also a regular guest star on The West Wing, portraying the character Nancy, an assistant of President Josiah Bartlet, played by her father."
