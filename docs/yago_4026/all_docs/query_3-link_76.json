If you'd like to sign up for a membership to support the site and join the conversation, you can explore your options here.\n\nExisting members can sign in here. If you're a former member, you can renew your membership.\n\nNote: If you are a member and tried to log in, it didn't work, and now you're stuck in a neverending login loop of death, try disabling any ad blockers or extensions that you have installed on your browser...sometimes they can interfere with the Memberful links. Still having trouble? Email me!\n\n×\n\nChange your display name\n\nThis is the name that'll be displayed next to comments you make on kottke.org; your email will not be displayed publicly. I'd encourage you to use your real name (or at least your first name and last initial) but you can also pick something that you go by when you participate in communities online. Choose something durable and reasonably unique (not \"Me\" or \"anon\"). Please don't change this often. No impersonation..\n\nNote: I'm letting folks change their display names because the membership service that kottke.org uses collects full names and I thought some people might not want their names displayed publicly here. If it gets abused, I might disable this feature."
