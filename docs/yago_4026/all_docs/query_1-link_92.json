From iconic ’80s classics, like The Breakfast Club, to thought-provoking dramas, Estevez has showcased his talent across various genres. The son of Martin Sheen and brother of Charlie Sheen, Estevez is often seen as Hollywood royalty. He admits that even though he’s done some great films, note everything is golden. Hey says, “I’ve done some forgettable shit too…. There’s no avoiding it.” We might have to agree to disagree as we look back at our favorite Emilio Estevez Movies and TV Shows.\n\nDid you know?

Emilio Estevez co-stars with his brother, Charlie Sheen, portraying Jim Mitchell, one of the brothers. Estevez was also the director and producer of the film. While the movie did well with audiences, it wasn’t a favorite among the critics. Says Estevez, “I was at the premiere of Rated X at Sundance, and I stood in the back of the theater after introducing the film. I held the door open for people who were walking out. They didn’t recognize me until they got right next to me. They were certainly less embarrassed than I was for holding the door open for them to leave.”\n\n12.
