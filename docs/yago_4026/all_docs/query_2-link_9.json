        "text": "Dave:\n\nWhat happened to our stash?\n\nVicky:\n\n*Our stash*? Since when do we have a stash?\n\nDave:\n\nYou know...\n\nVicky:\n\nNo. I thought we decided to be more responsible, and you were gonna get rid of the pot.\n\nDave:\n\nI am getting rid of it. Little by little.\n\nVicky:\n\nWhat was that?\n\nDave:\n\nOh, that must be Mike playing with his BB gun.\n\nVicky:\n\nHis what?\n\nDave:\n\nAh, you know, he's been begging me for one, so I finally got it for him.\n\nVicky:\n\nDave! Why didn't you ask me first?\n\n[in his personal space]\n\nDave:\n\nSame reason I never asked her for a three-way. She would've just said no.\n\nDave:\n\nWhen I was a kid, all I wanted to do was sneak into \"R\" rated movies. In my mind, \"R\" stood for \"really good.\" Nowadays, there's warnings and ratings on everything; video games, music, booze, cigarettes. You think these warnings would keep kids away from all these things. When, actually, it's sending up a flare saying, \"Hey, look. Good stuff over here.\"\n\n[disclaimer appears on screen:\n\n\"Due to the mature subject matter, the following episode may not be suitable for all family members.\"]\n\nDave:\n\n[glances down at disclaimer] See? Makes you wanna watch even more, doesn't it?\n\nDave:\n\nYou know, when I was young, I would say anything to a girl to get her to... well, to get her to. I would tell fat girls they were hot. I would tell ugly girls they were pretty. I would tell stupid girls they were... Well, I really didn't have to tell them much. They were pretty much good to go.\n\nDave:\n\n[beginning of the show, fourth wall] You know, don't you sometimes wish that having kids was like eating out at a restaurant, that if you didn't like the food, or for that matter kids, you could send it back? \"Uh yea excuse me, I never ordered this daughter so spicy, and where's the dressing she's suppose to come with, and oh, yea, I didn't order this kid flaming, and I don't even *remember* ordering this kid at all.\"\n\nDave:\n\nAll right! All right! All right! All right! That is it! Okay? Okay? Apparently, you kids have forgotten that we are the parents! Okay? So, to remind you of this, we are instituting a zero-tolerence policy, effective immediately! If anybody misses their curfew, or doesn't do their homework, or talks back, or just looks at us wrong, they're gettin' a spanking!\n\n[all the kids laugh]\n\nHillary:\n\nOh my God!\n\nMike:\n\nAre you serious?\n\nDave:\n\nYou think this is some kinda joke? Do you? Just try me and see what happens! [silence] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Now, who wants to mess with me first? [silence] Yeah, that's right! That's what I thought! Remember, I'm the stallion! All right? You're nothing but ponies!\n\nHillary Gold:\n\n[to Taye] Wait, you're breaking up with me?\n\nTaye:\n\nMmm-hmm.\n\nHillary Gold:\n\nWhy? I mean, is this because I'm grounded? Because I can just sneak out.\n\nTaye:\n\nIt's not that. You can't go around thugging on people. You're a hater.\n\nHillary Gold:\n\nNo, it wasn't like that at all.\n\nTaye:\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't go out with someone who solves their problems with violence. [Cut scene] Plus, she's way too clingy. If I was actually hitting it, it'd be one thing, but life's too short.\n\nVicky Gold:\n\n[about Mike] You know, between his sleeping and his moods, and that note, you know, we're just very concerned, Doctor. And I'm not one of those parents that, you know, overreacts, but he turned down chocolate-chip pancakes.\n\nDr. Joel Lieber:\n\nWell, I don't consider therapy overreacting, I just think it's good parenting. [cut scene] Plus, all I need is one more manic depressive or schizophrenic and I can afford to re-landscape.\n\nMike Gold:\n\nAll right, look, I have to tell you guys the truth. I'm not really depressed, okay? That note you found was a song I tried to write, and I was just trying to get you to buy me stuff.\n\nVicky Gold:\n\nWe know that, you idiot!\n\nDave Gold:\n\nYeah, what's the matter with you, huh? How can you do something like that?\n\nVicky Gold:\n\nYou scared us!\n\nDave Gold:\n\nHow are we supposed to know when there's something's really wrong with you, you moron!\n\nDylan:\n\n[on a date] So were you born in New York?\n\nKenny:\n\nI DON'T WANNA HAVE SEX WITH YOU!\n\nDylan:\n\n[stunned] What?\n\nKenny:\n\nI'm a virgin - slow down, will ya?\n\nDylan:\n\nI don't...\n\nKenny:\n\nI've never been with another guy in a house all alone before, okay?\n\nDylan:\n\nKenny, just relax.\n\nKenny:\n\nHey, I'm bad at being gay. I think I'm allowed to be a LITTLE upset.\n\nDylan:\n\nI've never been in this situation either, okay? This is all new to me, too.\n\nKenny:\n\nReally?\n\nDylan:\n\n[still alarmed] Trust me. *All* of it is new to me.\n\nKenny:\n\n[sits down] So... you don't want to start having crazy sex right this second?\n\nDylan:\n\nUm, no. Not really.\n\nKenny:\n\n[grins] Is this a great date or what?\n\nDylan:\n\n[later] So, what do you feel like doin'?\n\nKenny:\n\nHow about a movie? I rented Funny Girl and All About Eve.\n\nDylan:\n\nHmm. Those sound kind of... gay.\n\nKenny:\n\nYeah, they do, don't they.\n\nDylan:\n\nI like Lord of the Rings.\n\nKenny:\n\nI love Lord of the Rings!\n\nDylan:\n\nThey have the best battle sequences ever filmed.\n\nKenny:\n\nOh my God, that's exactly what Larry says!\n\nDylan:\n\nI think Viggo Mortensen was born to play the part of Aragorn.\n\nKenny:\n\nLarry says that too!\n\nDylan:\n\nOh yeah? Well, does Larry say that you have the most soulful eyes he's ever seen? [Kenny is speechless, and then giggles and swoons against the couch]\n\nDave Gold:\n\nIt turns out Hillary's doctor is someone I went to high school with.\n\nVicky Gold:\n\nYou're kidding. You know Dr. Vogel?\n\nDave Gold:\n\nOh, yeah, I know all about him. Let's just say he turned his hobby into his career.\n\nVicky Gold:\n\nWhat do you mean, he was President of the Pap Smear Club?\n\nDave Gold:\n\nIn a matter of speaking, yes. I mean, in high school, all this guy talked about was getting into girls' pants. At least back then he had to work at it. Now all he has to do is say next!\n\nVicky Gold:\n\nI've been going to Dr. Vogel for, like, three years now, and he's been nothing but professional...\n\nDave Gold:\n\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He's, uh... he's seen you, too?\n\nVicky Gold:\n\nNot only has he seen me, I paid him to look at it.\n\nDave Gold:\n\nCome on! Come on. I've been very mature about this. I discussed it calmly and rationally. I didn't even scream or yell! Come on!\n\nVicky Gold:\n\nYeah. You mean like you're doing now?\n\nDave Gold:\n\nThat's 'cause you're making me!\n\nVicky Gold:\n\nHey, just because you handled it maturely doesn't mean you get what you want.\n\nDave Gold:\n\nBut that's not fair!\n\nVicky Gold:\n\nI'm sorry if it bothers you, but I think Vogel is an excellent doctor, and I'm very comfortable with him.\n\nDave Gold:\n\nWell, I'm not.\n\nVicky Gold:\n\nThen I suggest you don't let him examine your vagina.\n\nDave:\n\n[Giving Kenny advice about the new girl that he is dating, who is fat.] I'm just saying that you should always be careful.\n\nKenny:\n\nYou mean I should always practice safe sex?\n\nDave:\n\n[Pauses] Yeah. That's what I'm saying.\n\nDave:\n\n[Speaking to the audience.] Actually, I meant that he shouldn't ever let her be on top.\n\nDave:\n\nSo did you break up with Heidi?\n\nMike:\n\nNo, dad. I didn't break up with Heidi.\n\nDave:\n\nWhat?! You didn't listen to me?\n\nMike:\n\nDad, no offence but I pretty much don't listen to anything you say ever.\n\nDave:\n\nWhat?\n\nMike:\n\nWell, you know, I listen for key words like \"Dinner's ready\" or \"allowance\" or \"FIRE!\" but the rest is just background noise."
