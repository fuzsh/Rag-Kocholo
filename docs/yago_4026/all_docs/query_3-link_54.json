        "text": "Where was St. Elmo's Fire filmed?\n\n1985\n\nCity Locations\n\nWashington D.C.; Los Angeles, CA (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nSchools/Colleges, Clubs/Bars, Hospitals/Medical, Buildings/Offices, Film Studio\n\nLocation Styles\n\nBuilding Dated/Retro, Dutch Colonial, Georgian/Southern, Colonial, Craftsman\n\nAbout St. Elmo's Fire\n\nFor a taste of the yuppie spirit that bridged the generation gap between The Breakfast Club teens and The Big Chill's baby boomers, keep an eye out for 1985's St. Elmo's Fire. Emilio Estevez, Andrew McCarthy, Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Andie MacDowell, and Mare Winningham are all part of the dynamic ensemble cast in this film by the renowned Joel Schumacher. These superb actors bring diverse and complex characters to life, adding extra dimensions to the film's portrayal of adulthood and its obstacles.\n\nThe events of St. Elmo's Fire occur as a group of Georgetown University grads navigate life after graduation. The ups and downs, dreams and fears of entering adulthood are mirrored in their path. Friendship, love, and coming-of-age are universally relatable concepts, and the film does a masterful job of capturing these ideas by examining the characters' changing relationships, professional lives, and personal lives.\n\nDespite its well-known actors and relatable plot, St. Elmo's Fire sparked controversy. Unfortunately, Rob Lowe, famous for his endearing onscreen persona, won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor for his performance in this picture.\n\nSt. Elmo's Fire captures the atmosphere of the time while offering spectators a thought-provoking investigation of youth, adulthood, and life. Critical reception for the film was hostile, though. Rotten Tomatoes gives the picture a 5.2/10 average and a 42% approval rating. Metacritic, meanwhile, contains 15 reviews from critics and gives it a weighted average score of 35 out of 100.\n\nSt. Elmo's Fire Locations\n\nSt. Elmo's Fire was mainly set and filmed in the university-centric district of Georgetown in northwest Washington, DC. The movie's genuine atmosphere was enhanced by the captivating background of this dynamic and historically significant region. The Tombs, a famous haunt located at 1226 36th Street NW, inspired the fictional St. Elmo's Bar, created by a Hollywood studio. Curiously, the mansion featured in another classic set in Georgetown, The Exorcist, is just across the street.\n\nJust a few blocks east at 1218 Wisconsin Avenue at M Street was the Third Edition, a pub featured in the film, though it has since closed. The university sequences were not recorded at Georgetown University because of institutional restrictions. The University of Maryland, College Park, located around ten miles northeast of Washington, DC, was used by the filmmakers instead.\n\nSome sequences were shot at the historic bank building at 650 South Spring Street in downtown Los Angeles, while others were shot at a house on Prosser Dam Road in central California. Many additional films have featured this famous location, such as Spider-Man 2, The Mask, and Seven.\n\nLastly, Wendy & Jules' Shop, a key location in the film, is situated at 3216 O Street NW, Washington, DC. A trip to these locations would be a delightful journey for any St. Elmo's Fire fan, taking you through a captivating blend of urban landscapes, historic buildings, and charming neighborhoods.\n\nNewly graduated from Georgetown University, Alec (Judd Nelson), Leslie (Ally Sheedy), Kevin (Andrew McCarthy), Jules (Demi Moore), and Kirby (Emilio Estevez) anxiously await updates on their friends: Wendy (Mare Winningham), known for her kind-hearted nature and dedication to aiding others, and Billy (Rob Lowe), an ex-fraternity boy grappling with his new roles as a husband and father, are the subjects of their concern. A memorable scene from the film that fans often reflect on is when the entire group departs from college.\n\nInterestingly, although the film is set at Georgetown University, most scenes were not filmed at that institution due to restrictions imposed by the university authorities. Instead, the filmmakers used the University of Maryland, College Park, as the setting for their alma mater. Located about ten miles northeast of DC, this large and historic campus, founded in 1856, served as an ideal stand-in for Georgetown.\n\nIf fans wish to visit this location, it's essential to note that it's a functioning university campus, so it's advisable to contact the administration before planning your visit. You can take the Green Line Metro towards Greenbelt to get there from Washington, DC, and get off at the College Park-U of Md station. From there, the campus is just a short walk or bus ride away. It's just a 30-minute drive down Queens Chapel Road.\n\nDiscover Baltimore Filming Locations\n\nThere is a memorable moment in which Kirby meets a medical student named Dale at the hospital. This encounter reignites an infatuation that had been dormant since their college years.\n\nThe locations for the hospital sequences were shot at Riverdale's Leland Memorial Hospital. This general hospital opened in 1947 and served the town for many years before closing. Even though it's no longer open, the building's facade is still there, creating a one-of-a-kind ambiance that movie buffs will appreciate.\n\nKeep in mind that you can only see the building from the outside, given that the location is permanently closed. Nonetheless, stepping at this spot provides viewers with an actual link to the film and the opportunity to imagine the unforgettable encounter between Kirby and Dale.\n\nGetting to the former Leland Memorial Hospital location requires a bit of planning. If you're in Washington, DC, you can take the MARC Train from Union Station towards Perryville, getting off at the Riverdale stop. From there, it's a short walk or a bus ride to the former hospital site.\n\nLocate Baltimore Video Shoot Locations\n\nThe pivotal scene unfolds at the group's favorite college gathering spot, St. Elmo's Bar. The mood is tense as the friends learn that Billy has lost his job, a position that Alec had helped him secure. This scene encapsulates the challenges and realities of post-college life, with an iconic setting serving as the backdrop.\n\nWhile the interior scenes of St. Elmo's Bar were filmed in a Hollywood studio, the design was inspired by a real-life location: The Tombs, located at 1226 36th Street NW in Washington. This famous Georgetown watering hole on the edge of Georgetown University's campus has a deep-rooted history dating back to the mid-1800s when it was built in a Federal-style townhouse.\n\nThe Tombs is more than just a restaurant; it's a local institution. It's a neighborhood eatery by day, but by night it transforms into a bustling hub for Georgetown students.\n\nIf you wish to visit The Tombs, it's easy to reach the site. From Washington, DC, you can take the DC Circulator Bus from Union Station toward Georgetown and get off at the Wisconsin Ave NW & M St NW stop. From there, it's a short 10-minute walk to The Tombs.

Billy spots his wife (Jenny Wright) in the crowd with another man. In a fit of anger and jealousy, he confronts and attacks the man, leading to Billy being ejected from the bar. Despite this tumultuous event, Billy later reconciles with his wife, highlighting the ups and downs of their relationship.\n\nWhile the setting appears to be a quintessential college town bar, the interior scenes were actually filmed on the Courthouse Square backlot in Hollywood. This set comprises various facades that create an archetypal American town square, complete with a courthouse at its heart.\n\nThe Courthouse Square backlot has a rich cinematic history, having been constructed for the 1948 film An Act of Murder. Since then, it has appeared in numerous films, including the Back to the Future trilogy and the Gremlins series. Despite being damaged by fire multiple times, in 1957, 1990, and 2008, the set has been faithfully reconstructed after each incident.\n\nSt. Elmo's Fire fans can visit the Courthouse Square backlot as part of the Universal Studios tour. To get there, you can take the Metro Red Line subway from downtown Los Angeles to the Universal City station and then take the free Universal Studios shuttle up the hill to the theme park.\n\nSearch West Hollywood Film Shoot Locations\n\nIn an attempt to impress Dale, Kirby takes a job working for Mr. Kim (Mario Machado), a wealthy Korean businessman. He uses his house to host a party without Mr. Kim's permission. At the party, Wendy arrives with Howie (Jon Cutler), an awkward young man her parents wish her to marry. The tension escalates when Alec announces his engagement to Leslie, much to her surprise and dismay.\n\nThe scene encapsulates the drama, romance, and confusion of post-college life, set against the backdrop of Georgetown, a student-friendly area in northwest Washington, DC. Much of the movie was filmed in this historic neighborhood, which is home to Georgetown University, the oldest Catholic institution of higher education in the United States. Founded in 1789 by Bishop John Carroll, it became the nation's first federally chartered university.\n\nOnce there, you can explore the campus, stroll through the historic neighborhood, and indulge in myriad activities. Whether you're interested in museums, arts, sports, or live performances, Georgetown offers endless experiences.\n\nIf you're in downtown Washington, DC, and want to visit Georgetown, you have a couple of options.
