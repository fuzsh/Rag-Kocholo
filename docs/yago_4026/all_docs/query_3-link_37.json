        "text": "A little more than 10 years ago, Emilio Estevez started hanging out in an oddly familiar location: the library.\n\nThat’s right — one of the stars of the 1985 John Hughes movie “The Breakfast Club,” set in a high school library, started spending his days at the downtown branch of the Los Angeles Public Library system. Just . . . people-watching. Every now and again, someone noticed.\n\n“There were a few instances where I was found out,” Estevez, 56, tells The Post with a laugh. It wasn’t about nostalgia, though, but research for his new movie “The Public,” centered on the public library as one of the last safe, free spaces in an increasingly commodified world.\n\nHis interest was piqued by a 2007 Los Angeles Times column written by a Salt Lake City librarian named Chip Ward, about the large homeless population that congregates there during the day, and how librarians deal with this unforeseen, unwritten part of their job.\n\nEstevez started talking to homeless people he met while skulking around. “At libraries, that was where they felt safe,” he says. “Once they’d parked their suspicions about what I was doing, and knew I wasn’t going to be exploitative, that I wanted to hear their story, it was a lot easier to navigate. A lot of these conversations were painful and heartbreaking. But some were absolutely hilarious.”\n\nEstevez had been writing and directing for years — his last film, 2010’s “The Way,” starred his father, Martin Sheen. One of his first, the 1990 bomb “Men at Work,” co-starred Estevez and his brother, Charlie Sheen.\n\nFor this drama, Estevez’s jumping-off point was the idea of a city library in the middle of a brutal cold snap, whose homeless patrons refuse to leave, knowing the shelters are overflowing.\n\n“The movie is way more relevant now than had I made it 10 years ago,” Estevez says. “Especially on the heels of this polar vortex that descended on the country [in late January].”\n\nAs he spent weeks doing research, he became a bona fide library nerd. “The president of the New York Public Library, Tony Marx, said last year that the public library is the place that is quietly saving democracy,” Estevez says. “Consider this: More people visited the public library system last year than sporting events and Broadway shows combined. So the number and the need is enormous. And access to all of that information is free. It’s one of the only places that doesn’t require a transaction.”\n\nIn the film, a librarian refers to the Connecticut Four, a group of librarians who sued to protest an FBI search demanding information on patrons and their internet searches — and won.\n\n“I got a real first-hand experience of what the daily life of a librarian looks like,” Estevez says. “And what I came away with was, this is a sacred space that exists between desk reference librarians and patrons.” While acknowledging the discomfort the presence of homeless people can bring, “The Public” humanizes the group, led by actor Michael Kenneth Williams as the man who instigates the protest.\n\nStill, there was a throwback element that couldn’t be entirely ignored in a film that takes place over the course of a single day in a library. Did Estevez immediately make the connection between “The Public” and “The Breakfast Club” when he started writing?\n\n“Initially, no, and then I was like, ‘Oh, yeah, I guess I’m gonna have to address that,’ ” he says. “I thought, OK, I’ll throw a couple of things in there. The jacket I wear in it is not dissimilar to the blue letterman’s jacket from ‘Breakfast Club.’ And there’s a moment where a librarian is reading a story to children — it’s the Ally Sheedy book, ‘She Was Nice to Mice.’ That’s a little Easter egg I planted.”\n\nThat said, Estevez doesn’t see himself signing on for any kind of ’80s reboot or homage. “I tend to think about what’s next, not what’s been done,” he says. “For the last two years, I’ve done nothing but eat, drink and dream this film.”"
