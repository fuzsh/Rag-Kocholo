        "text": "After you've chatted with your family and friends, eaten appetizers, eaten the main course and eaten dessert, what do you do next? Watch a movie of course! Why bother dragging the crew to the local multiplex (which gets surprisingly crowded on holidays) when you can rent these Thanksgiving-themed films and enjoy them as you digest? Since Thanksgiving is really more of a long weekend than one day, check out a few of these films and watch them over several days.\n\nFor families\n\nA Charlie Brown Thanksgiving (Not Rated)\n\nJellybeans, toast, popcorn, ice cream sundaes. I don't know what the problem is; sounds like the perfect Thanksgiving spread to me. I appreciate your lack of culinary talent, young Mr. Brown!\n\nMiracle on 34th Street (Not Rated)\n\nSure, it's a staple in the Christmas film lineup, but the \"Miracle\" begins at the famous Macy's Parade which we all know happens on a certain fourth Thursday of November. Yes, Virginia, this is a T-Day film!\n\nDutch (PG-13)\n\nOne of Ed O'Neill finest performances. Funny, stupid and touching.\n\nDutch (O'Neill) volunteers to drive his girlfriend's 12-year-old son (Ethan Embry) home from boarding school for Thanksgiving and the snotty spoiled brat clashes with the blue-collar construction worker.\n\nHome for the Holidays (PG-13)\n\nA perfect dinner with the crazy family film.\n\nClaudia (Holly Hunter) loses her job, makes out with her soon to be ex-boss and finds out that her daughter (Claire Danes) plans to spend Thanksgiving with her boyfriend. So she decides to face spending the holiday with her crazy Mom (Anne Bancroft), Dad (Charles Durning) and brother (Robert Downey Jr.).\n\nAnnie Hall (PG)\n\nNot really a T-Day film in the strictest sense, but check out the Thanksgiving scene at Annie's parents house.\n\nFor Adults\n\nPlanes, Trains and Automobiles (R)\n\nThis is my favorite Thanksgiving Travel Story from Hell. Steve Martin and the horribly missed John Candy are buddies on this journey through Murphy's Law, making stops at frustration, anger and loneliness. By the end of the road both learn what the spirit of the holiday truly means. Awww!\n\nThe Ice Storm (R)\n\nThe picture of class - on the surface. An electric shock of lies underneath. What a gorgeous movie, and it all surrounds Thanksgiving weekend, as Tobey Maguire comes home from school to deal with a philandering father (Kevin Kline), ice cold mother (Joan Allen), sexually adventurous sister (Christina Ricci) and just plain odd next door neighbor (Elijah Wood).\n\nThe Myth of Fingerprints (R)\n\nFor some reason I've always been drawn to this movie. The starkness of it. It's Julianne Moore's performance as Mia, that gets me most. Not a great movie, but haunting.\n\nA young man (Noah Wyle) returns home for Thanksgiving after three years to deal with his dysfunctional family, The darkly comic story examines how each adult sibling has problems expressing feelings and explores their relationships with their emotionally crippled father (Roy Scheider).\n\nThe Daytrippers (R)\n\nHilarious road trip film. Eliza (Hope Davis) thinks her marriage to Louis (Stanley Tucci) is going great, until she finds a mysterious love note to her husband. Concerned, Eliza, her parents (Anne Meara and Pat McNamara), her sister Jo (Parker Posey) and Jo's boyfriend, Carl, (Liev Schreiber) all pile into a station wagon, to go to the city to confront Louis with the letter.\n\nBest moments come from Posey and Schreiber - especially as pretentious Carl bores the group to death with details on his unpublished novel.\n\nScent of a Woman (R)\n\nHOO-HAH!!\n\nFrank (A* I Finally Got My Oscar\" Pacino) is a retired Lt Col in the U.S. army, plus he's blind and just an ornery coot. Earnest Charlie (Chris \"What Happened to Me?\" O'Donnell) agrees to look after Frank over Thanksgiving to help pay for a trip home for Christmas. Frank's niece says this will be easy money, but she didn't reckon on Frank spending his Thanksgiving doing the tango in New York.\n\nThe House of Yes (R)\n\nA little too kooky for my usual T-Day, but it's certainly themed for the holidays. Plus the bizarre Jackie Kennedy thing could almost be seen as an anniversary homage. Almost.\n\nJackie-O (Parker Posey) is anxiously awaiting the Thanksgiving visit of her beloved brother (Josh Hamilton). However, she is most put out when he brings home a girl - his new fiancée. It's soon clear her Jackie Kennedy obsession is nothing compared to her obsession with her brother - and she isn't the only member of the family with problems.his Thanksgiving doing the tango in New York.\n\nThe War at Home (R)\n\nNot necessarily a cheery one, but the world is in turmoil, why not explore it with the family on T-Day?\n\nDirected, produced and starring Emilio Estevez, \"The War at Home\" is based on the play \"Homefront\" by James Duff. For Vietnam veteran Jeremy Collier (Estevez), Thanksgiving 1972 is the most difficult time. He's been back in his Texas hometown for a full year, but can't seem to forget what happened to him in the war. Worse yet, his relatives (Martin Sheen, Kathy Bates, Kimberly Williams) don't have a clue how to deal with him.\n\nNobody's Fool (R)\n\nPaul Newman stars as Donald \"Sully\" Sullivan, a 60-year-old part-time laborer who lost touch with the wife and children he abandoned years ago. He flirts with Toby (Melanie Griffith), the wife of Carl (Bruce Willis), a local contractor who employs employs (and who Sully's currently suing for worker's compensation). Things begin to change for Sully when his long-lost son, Peter (Dylan Walsh), arrives in town for Thanksgiving with his family. A college professor recently let go from his job, Peter remains in town with one of his sons after a spat with his wife, and for the first time he and his father get to know one another."
