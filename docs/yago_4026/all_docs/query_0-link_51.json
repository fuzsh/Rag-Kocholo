Estevez reprises his role as youth hockey coach Gordon Bombay for the Disney+ streaming service's “The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,\" debuting March 26. Set in contemporary Minnesota, the Ducks are now a successful, win-at-all costs team. AdEstevez, part of an acting family that includes father Martin Sheen (\"The West Wing\") and brother Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"), said he had largely stepped away from acting to make independent films, including 1996's “The War at Home.”\n\nNEW YORK Actor-writer-director Andrew McCarthy, a 57-year-old father of three, keeps getting asked about his Brat Pack years in the 1980s. Grand Central Publishing announced Tuesday that McCarthy's Brat: An '80s Story will come out next spring. Grand Central is calling the book a revealing look at coming of age in a maelstrom, reckoning with conflicted ambition, innocence, addiction and masculinity. McCarthy is calling it a long-delayed reckoning. The term Brat Pack was popularized by an unflattering New York magazine story that ran in 1985 and portrayed the young actors as shallow and self-absorbed. McCarthy has long disputed he was part of any such group, telling People magazine in 1999 that he hadn't seen any of his famous co-stars since making St.\n\nFILE - In this Jan. 29, 2010 file photo, director Joel Schumacher attends the premiere of \"Twelve\" during the 2010 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.

(AP Photo/Peter Kramer, File)NEW YORK Joel Schumacher, the flamboyant journeyman director who dressed New York department store windows before shepherding the Brat Pack to the big screen in St. Elmo's Fire and steering the Batman franchise into its most baroque territory in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, has died. A representative for Schumacher said the filmmaker died Monday in New York after a year-long battle with cancer."
