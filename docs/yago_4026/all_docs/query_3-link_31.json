Rated X is one example, wherein the two real life brothers play two porn baron brothers from the 1960s.\n\nIf the question is 'have they ever showed up in a cameo role in each others films'; again, yes, more so than the previous. It almost seemed like a game to show up in each others films in the 1980's; Young Guns, Loaded Weapon, Wisdom, Never on Tuesday, Men at Work... the list goes on."
