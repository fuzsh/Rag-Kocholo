What are my picks for the 10 worst shows of 2005? I thought you'd never ask! 1. 2005 MTV Video Music Awards: A three-hour pile of overproduced horse poop. Note to viewers: Next time the VMA host feels the need to repeatedly tell you that \"anything can happen,\" trust me: Nothing will.2. The War at Home: Turns out War is hell and horribly written.3. The West Wing (debate episode): Just like a real presidential debate, only duller.4. Saturday Night Live: The women still rock, but the rest of the show feels about as desperate as one of Horatio Sanz's midskit giggle fits.5. Queer as Folk ser\n\nPRISON BREAKS\n\nPrison Break is once again getting furloughed by Fox. In a November-sweeps press release issued Thursday, Fox referred to the show's Nov. 28 episode as its \"fall finale,\" but gave no indication as to when it would be back. Adding to the mystery: A network rep would only say that Prison's remaining nine episodes would air&nbsp;at a \"later date.\" As previously reported, 24 assumes Prison's Monday-9 pm time slot in early January. (Damn you, 24! Oh, wait — I like 24. Damn you, um, er, um, War at Home!)\n\nWATCH ALONE, THEN!\n\nThe happy-go-lucky Parents Television Council has released its annual list of worst prime-time shows for family viewing. Fox had six out of the top (bottom?) 10, with The War at Home, Family Guy, American Dad, those horn dogs on The O.C., Arrested Development and&nbsp;That '70s Show. Rounding out my new Must-See TV list are CSI (too grisly), Desperate Housewives (too slutty), Cold Case (too graphic) and Two and a Half Men\n\nSHORT CUTS\n\nFox has picked up The War at Home and Bones for a full season.... Angelina Jolie received the Global Humanitarian Award from the United Nations Association of the U.S.A. Tuesday night for her work as a goodwill ambassador for the U.N.'s refugee agency.... Due to split coverage of the baseball play-offs on Fox and FX tonight, Over There will be preempted. The season's final two episodes will now air on Oct. 19 and Oct. 26.\n\nWho dares interrupt my Sunday...\n\nWho dares interrupt my Sunday night of First Amendment-protected comedy? Actually, I'm just trying to start with a bang — this show lived up to its irreverent promise (I had to look up \"irreverent\"). Let's start with Michael Rapaport, who has succeeded in the career of being Michael Rapaport. Seriously, he's always the same guy. But that guy is right for this series. I think I counted six blatantly racial, stereotypical or uncomfortable comments in five minutes. So the alcoholic thing, the questionably gay son, the teenage girl's new black boyfriend, the implants and even Rapaport's excitement over Lindsay Lohan have opened a few doors in the realm of \"borderline offensive prime-time comedy.\" Oh yeah, and the sparky teenaged Kaylee Defer actually looks like Lindsay Lohan. Nice. Problems don't really get solved,&nbsp;nor do they&nbsp;click, and we're once again reminded that having kids is rough. But I like the family's legitimacy — almost like"
