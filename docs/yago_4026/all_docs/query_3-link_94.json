        "text": "The Brat Pack — the group of young stars that dominated the ’80s box office — is getting the doc treatment from one of its own memebers.\n\nActor Andrew McCarthy wrote and directed the feature doc Brats, which is production of ABC News Studios, Neon and Network Entertainment, will debut on Hulu later this year.\n\nThe synopsis of the film reads: “The documentary explores the cultural phenomenon of films such as St. Elmo’s Fire and The Breakfast Club that tapped into teenage angst and connected with young audiences in a way that had never been done before. The films earned a cult-like following but the ‘Brat Pack’ label would impact the young actors’ careers in unexpected ways for decades to come.”\n\nThe doc will feature McCarthy — whose Brat Pack credits include Pretty in Pink and Less Than Zero and — interviewing stars like Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez, Jon Cryer, Lea Thompson, and Timothy Hutton, among others. Filmmakers will also be featured in the doc, as well as David Blum, who first coined the term Brat Pack in a 1985 New York Magazine cover story.\n\n“The Brat Pack has cast a long shadow over my life and career,” said McCarthy, who also wrote the New York Times bestselling memoir Brat: An ‘80s Story. “After all these years, I was curious to see how it had affected my fellow Brat Pack members. What I found was surprising — and liberating.”\n\nDerik Murray and Adrian Buitenhuis produced Brats, with Brian Liebman and McCarthy executive producing. Neon’s Dan O’Meara and Tom Quinn and Network Entertainment’s Brian Gersh, Paul Gertz and Kent Wingerak are executive producers, along with ABC News Studios’ Victoria Thompson and David Sloan."
