        "text": "English monarchs up to 1707\n\nThis article is about English monarchs until 1707. For British monarchs since the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, see List of British monarchs.\n\n\"England Monarchs\" redirects here. Not to be confused with England Monarchs (American football).\n\nThis list of kings and reigning queens of the Kingdom of England begins with Alfred the Great, who initially ruled Wessex, one of the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which later made up modern England. Alfred styled himself king of the Anglo-Saxons from about 886, and while he was not the first king to claim to rule all of the English, his rule represents the start of the first unbroken line of kings to rule the whole of England, the House of Wessex.[1]\n\nArguments are made for a few different kings thought to have controlled enough Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to be deemed the first king of England. For example, Offa of Mercia and Egbert of Wessex are sometimes described as kings of England by popular writers, but it is no longer the majority view of historians that their wide dominions are part of a process leading to a unified England. Historian Simon Keynes states, for example, that \"Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.\"[2] This refers to a period in the late 8th century when Offa achieved a dominance over many of the kingdoms of southern England, but this did not survive his death in 796.[4] Likewise, in 829 Egbert of Wessex conquered Mercia, but he soon lost control of it.\n\nIt was not until the late 9th century that one kingdom, Wessex, had become the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Its king, Alfred the Great, was overlord of western Mercia and used the title King of the Angles and Saxons, but he never ruled eastern and northern England, which was then known as the Danelaw, having earlier been conquered by the Danes from southern Scandinavia. His son Edward the Elder conquered the eastern Danelaw, but Edward's son Æthelstan became the first king to rule the whole of England when he conquered Northumbria in 927, and he is regarded by some modern historians as the first true king of England.[4] The title \"King of the English\" or Rex Anglorum in Latin, was first used to describe Æthelstan in one of his charters in 928. The standard title for monarchs from Æthelstan until John was \"King of the English\". In 1016 Cnut the Great, a Dane, was the first to call himself \"King of England\". In the Norman period \"King of the English\" remained standard, with occasional use of \"King of England\" or Rex Anglie. From John's reign onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of \"King\" or \"Queen of England\".\n\nThe Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England under the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284, and in 1301 King Edward I invested his eldest son, the future King Edward II, as Prince of Wales. Since that time, the eldest sons of all English monarchs, except for King Edward III,[a] have borne this title.\n\nAfter the death of Queen Elizabeth I without issue in 1603, her cousin King James VI of Scotland inherited the English crown as James I of England, joining the crowns of England and Scotland in personal union. By royal proclamation, James styled himself \"King of Great Britain\", but no such kingdom was actually created until 1707, when England and Scotland united during the reign of Queen Anne to form the new Kingdom of Great Britain, with a single British parliament sitting at Westminster. This marked the end of the Kingdom of England as a sovereign state.\n\nHouse of Wessex (886–1013)\n\n[edit]\n\nFor earlier monarchs of Wessex, see List of monarchs of Wessex.\n\nMain article: House of Wessex\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Claim Alfred[5]\n\nAlfred the Great\n\n(King of Wessex from 871)\n\nc. 886\n\n–\n\n26 October 899\n\n(13 years) 849 Son of Æthelwulf of Wessex\n\nand Osburh Ealhswith of Gainsborough\n\n868\n\n5 children 26 October 899\n\nAged about 50 Son of Æthelwulf of WessexTreaty of Wedmore Edward the Elder[6]\n\n26 October 899\n\n–\n\n17 July 924\n\n(24 years, 266 days) c. 874 Son of Alfred\n\nand Ealhswith (1) Ecgwynn\n\nc. 893\n\n2 children(2) Ælfflæd\n\nc. 900\n\n8 children(3) Eadgifu of Kent\n\nc. 919\n\n4 children 17 July 924\n\nAged about 50 Son of Alfred\n\nDisputed claimant\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is some evidence that Ælfweard of Wessex may have been king in 924, between his father Edward the Elder and his half brother Æthelstan, although he was not crowned. A 12th-century list of kings gives him a reign length of four weeks, though one manuscript of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says he died only 16 days after his father.[7] However, the fact that he ruled is not accepted by all historians. Also, it is unclear whether—if Ælfweard was declared king—it was over the whole kingdom or of Wessex only. One interpretation of the ambiguous evidence is that when Edward died, Ælfweard was declared king in Wessex and Æthelstan in Mercia.[4]\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Claim Ælfweard[8]\n\nc. 17 July 924\n\n–\n\n2 August 924[9]\n\n(16 days) c. 901[10] Son of Edward the Elder\n\nand Ælfflæd[10] Unmarried?\n\nNo children 2 August 924[4]\n\nAged about 23[α] Son of Edward the Elder\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Claim Æthelstan[12]\n\n924\n\nKing of the Anglo-Saxons (924–927)\n\n–\n\nKing of the English (927–939)\n\n27 October 939\n\n(14–15 years) 894 Son of Edward the Elder\n\nand Ecgwynn Unmarried 27 October 939\n\nAged about 45 Son of Edward the Elder Edmund I[13]\n\nEdmund the Magnificent\n\n27 October 939\n\n–\n\n26 May 946\n\n(6 years, 212 days) c. 921 Son of Edward the Elder\n\nand Eadgifu of Kent (1) Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury\n\n2 sons(2) Æthelflæd of Damerham\n\n944\n\nNo children 26 May 946\n\nPucklechurch\n\nKilled in a brawl aged about 25 Son of Edward the Elder Eadred[14]\n\n26 May 946\n\n–\n\n23 November 955\n\n(9 years, 182 days) c. 923 Son of Edward the Elder\n\nand Eadgifu of Kent Unmarried 23 November 955\n\nFrome\n\nAged about 32 Son of Edward the Elder Eadwig[15]\n\nEadwig All-Fair\n\n23 November 955\n\n–\n\n1 October 959\n\n(3 years, 313 days) c. 940 Son of Edmund I\n\nand Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury Ælfgifu\n\nNo verified children 1 October 959\n\nAged about 19 Son of Edmund I Edgar the Peaceful[16]\n\n1 October 959\n\n–\n\n8 July 975\n\n(15 years, 281 days) c. 943\n\nWessex Son of Edmund I\n\nand Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury (1) Æthelflæd\n\nc. 960\n\n1 son(2) Ælfthryth\n\nc. 964\n\n2 sons 8 July 975\n\nWinchester\n\nAged 31 Son of Edmund I Edward the Martyr[17]\n\n8 July 975\n\n–\n\n18 March 978\n\n(2 years, 254 days) c. 962 Son of Edgar the Peaceful\n\nand Æthelflæd Unmarried 18 March 978\n\nCorfe Castle\n\nMurdered aged about 16 Son of Edgar the Peaceful (1st reign)[b]\n\nÆthelred the Unready[18][19]\n\n18 March 978\n\n–\n\n1013\n\n(34–35 years) c. 966 Son of Edgar the Peaceful\n\nand Ælfthryth (1) Ælfgifu of York\n\n991\n\n9 children(2) Emma of Normandy\n\n1002\n\n3 children 23 April 1016\n\nLondon\n\nAged about 48 Son of Edgar the Peaceful\n\nHouse of Denmark (1013–1014)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: House of Knýtlinga\n\nEngland came under the control of Sweyn Forkbeard, a Danish king, after an invasion in 1013, during which Æthelred abandoned the throne and went into exile in Normandy.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Claim Sweyn[20]\n\nSweyn Forkbeard\n\n25 December 1013\n\n–\n\n3 February 1014\n\n(41 days) 17 April 963\n\nDenmark Son of Harald Bluetooth\n\nand either Tove or Gunhild (1) Gunhild of Wenden\n\nc. 990\n\n7 children(2) Sigrid the Haughty\n\nc. 1000\n\n1 daughter 3 February 1014\n\nGainsborough\n\nAged 50 Right of conquest\n\n(great-grandson of a king of Northumbria)\n\nHouse of Wessex (restored, first time) (1014–1016)\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the death of Sweyn Forkbeard, Æthelred the Unready returned from exile and was again proclaimed king.

Harald and William both invaded separately in 1066. Godwinson successfully repelled the invasion by Hardrada, but ultimately lost the throne of England in the Norman conquest of England.\n\nAfter the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, William the Conqueror made permanent the recent removal of the capital from Winchester to London. Following the death of Harold Godwinson at Hastings, the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemot elected as king Edgar Ætheling, the son of Edward the Exile and grandson of Edmund Ironside. The young monarch was unable to resist the invaders and was never crowned. William was crowned King William I of England on Christmas Day 1066, in Westminster Abbey, and is today known as William the Conqueror, William the Bastard or William I.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Claim William I[32]\n\nWilliam the Conqueror[e]\n\n25 December 1066\n\n–\n\n9 September 1087\n\n(20 years, 259 days) c. 1028\n\nFalaise Castle Son of Robert the Magnificent\n\nand Herleva Matilda of Flanders\n\nNormandy\n\n1053\n\n9 children 9 September 1087\n\nRouen\n\nAged about 59[β] Supposedly named heir in 1052 by Edward the Confessor First cousin once removed of Edward the ConfessorRight of conquest William II[33]\n\nWilliam Rufus\n\n26 September 1087[i]\n\n–\n\n2 August 1100\n\n(12 years, 311 days) c. 1056\n\nNormandy Son of William the Conqueror\n\nand Matilda of Flanders Unmarried 2 August 1100\n\nNew Forest\n\nShot with an arrow aged 44 Son of William I Granted the Kingdom of England over elder brother Robert Curthose (who remained the Duke of Normandy) Henry I[34]\n\nHenry Beauclerc\n\n5 August 1100[ii]\n\n–\n\n1 December 1135\n\n(35 years, 119 days) September 1068\n\nSelby Son of William the Conqueror\n\nand Matilda of Flanders (1) Matilda of Scotland\n\nWestminster Abbey\n\n11 November 1100\n\n2 children(2) Adeliza of Louvain\n\nWindsor Castle\n\n29 January 1121\n\nNo children 1 December 1135\n\nSaint-Denis-en-Lyons\n\nAged 67[γ] Son of William I Seizure of the Crown (from Robert Curthose)\n\nHouse of Blois (1135–1154)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: House of Blois\n\nHenry I left no legitimate male heirs, his son William Adelin having died in the White Ship disaster of 1120. This ended the direct Norman line of kings in England. Henry named his eldest daughter, Matilda (Countess of Anjou by her second marriage to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, as well as widow of her first husband, Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor), as his heir. Before naming Matilda as heir, he had been in negotiations to name his nephew Stephen of Blois as his heir. When Henry died, Stephen travelled to England, and in a coup d'etat had himself crowned instead of Matilda. The period which followed is known as The Anarchy, as parties supporting each side fought in open warfare both in Britain and on the continent for the better part of two decades.\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Claim Stephen[36]\n\nStephen of Blois\n\n22 December 1135[iii]\n\n–\n\n25 October 1154\n\n(18 years, 308 days) c. 1096\n\nBlois Son of Stephen II of Blois\n\nand Adela of Normandy Matilda of Boulogne\n\nWestminster\n\n1125\n\n6 children 25 October 1154\n\nDover Castle\n\nAged about 58 Grandson of William I Appointment / usurpation\n\nDisputed claimants\n\n[edit]\n\nMatilda was declared heir presumptive by her father, Henry I, after the death of her brother on the White Ship, and acknowledged as such by the barons. Upon Henry I's death, the throne was seized by Matilda's cousin, Stephen of Blois. During the ensuing Anarchy, Matilda controlled England for a few months in 1141. She was the first woman to do so, but was never crowned and is rarely listed as a monarch of England.[f]\n\nName Portrait Birth Marriage(s) Death Claim Matilda[36][37]\n\nEmpress Matilda\n\n7 April 1141\n\n–\n\n1 November 1141\n\n(209 days) 7 February 1102\n\nSutton Courtenay Manor House Daughter of Henry I\n\nand Edith of Scotland (1) Henry V of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nMainz\n\n6 January 1114\n\nNo children(2) Geoffrey V of Anjou\n\nLe Mans Cathedral\n\n22 May 1128\n\n3 sons 10 September 1167\n\nRouen\n\nAged 65 Daughter of Henry ISeizure of the Crown\n\nCount Eustace IV of Boulogne (c. 1130 – 17 August 1153) was appointed co-king of England by his father, King Stephen, on 6 April 1152, in order to guarantee his succession to the throne (as was the custom in France, but not in England). The Pope and the Church would not agree to this, and Eustace was not crowned. Eustace died the next year aged 23, during his father's lifetime, and so never became king in his own right.[38]\n\nHouse of Plantagenet (1154–1485)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: House of Plantagenet\n\nThe House of Plantagenet takes its name from Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, husband of Empress Matilda and father of Henry II. The name Plantagenet itself was unknown as a family name per se until Richard of York adopted it as his family name in the 15th century. It has since been retroactively applied to English monarchs from Henry II onward. It is common among modern historians to refer to Henry II and his sons as the \"Angevins\" due to their vast continental empire, and most of the Angevin kings before John spent more time in their continental possessions than in England.\n\nAngevin kings of England\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Angevin Empire and Angevin kings of England\n\nKing Stephen came to an agreement with Matilda in November 1153 with the signing of the Treaty of Wallingford, in which Stephen recognised Henry, son of Matilda and her second husband Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, as the designated heir. The royal house descended from Matilda and Geoffrey is widely known by two names, the House of Anjou (after Geoffrey's title as Count of Anjou) or the House of Plantagenet, after his sobriquet. Some historians prefer to group the subsequent kings into two groups, before and after the loss of the bulk of their French possessions, although they are not different royal houses.\n\nThe Angevins (from the French term meaning \"from Anjou\") ruled over the Angevin Empire during the 12th and 13th centuries, an area stretching from the Pyrenees to Ireland. They did not regard England as their primary home until most of their continental domains were lost by King John. The direct, eldest male line from Henry II includes monarchs commonly grouped together as the House of Plantagenet, which was the name given to the dynasty after the loss of most of their continental possessions, while cadet branches of this line became known as the House of Lancaster and the House of York during the War of the Roses.\n\nThe Angevins formulated England's royal coat of arms, which usually showed other kingdoms held or claimed by them or their successors, although without representation of Ireland for quite some time. Dieu et mon droit was first used as a battle cry by Richard I in 1198 at the Battle of Gisors, when he defeated the forces of Philip II of France.[39][40] It has generally been used as the motto of English monarchs since being adopted by Edward III.[39]\n\nName Portrait Arms Birth Marriage(s) Death Claim Henry II[41]\n\nHenry Curtmantle\n\n19 December 1154[iv]\n\n–\n\n6 July 1189\n\n(34 years, 200 days) 5 March 1133\n\nLe Mans Son of Geoffrey V of Anjou\n\nand Matilda Eleanor of Aquitaine\n\nBordeaux Cathedral\n\n18 May 1152\n\n8 children 6 July 1189\n\nChinon\n\nAged 56[δ] Grandson of Henry ITreaty of Wallingford Great-great-great-grandson of Edmund Ironside Henry II named his son, Henry the Young King (1155–1183), as co-ruler with him but this was a Norman custom of designating an heir, and the younger Henry did not outlive his father and rule in his own right, so he is not counted as a monarch on lists of kings.

The then-Prince Louis landed on the Isle of Thanet, off the north Kent coast, on 21 May 1216, and marched more or less unopposed to London, where the streets were lined with cheering crowds. At a grand ceremony in St. Paul's Cathedral, on 2 June 1216, in the presence of numerous English clergy and nobles, the Mayor of London and Alexander II of Scotland, Prince Louis was proclaimed King Louis of England (though not crowned). In less than a month, \"King Louis\" controlled more than half of the country and enjoyed the support of two-thirds of the barons. However, he suffered military defeat at the hands of the English fleet. By signing the Treaty of Lambeth in September 1217, Louis gained 10,000 marks and agreed he had never been the legitimate king of England.[44] \"King Louis\" remains one of the least known kings to have ruled over a substantial part of England.[45]\n\nName Portrait Arms Birth Marriage(s) Death Claim Louis[46]\n\nLouis the Lion\n\n2 June 1216\n\n–\n\n20 September 1217\n\n(1 year, 111 days) 5 September 1187\n\nParis Son of Philip II of France\n\nand Isabella of Hainault Blanche of Castile\n\nPort-Mort\n\n23 May 1200\n\n13 children 8 November 1226\n\nMontpensier\n\nAged 39 Right of conquest Offered by the Barons\n\nMain line of Plantagenets\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is from the time of Henry III, after the loss of most of the family's continental possessions, that the Plantagenet kings became more English in nature.

Those descended from English monarchs only through an illegitimate child would normally have no claim on the throne, but the situation was complicated when Gaunt and Swynford eventually married in 1396 (25 years after John Beaufort's birth). In view of the marriage, the church retroactively declared the Beauforts legitimate via a papal bull the same year.[61] Parliament did the same in an Act in 1397.[62] A subsequent proclamation by John of Gaunt's legitimate son, King Henry IV, also recognised the Beauforts' legitimacy, but declared them ineligible ever to inherit the throne.[63] Nevertheless, the Beauforts remained closely allied with Gaunt's other descendants, the Royal House of Lancaster.\n\nJohn Beaufort's granddaughter Lady Margaret Beaufort was married to Edmund Tudor. Tudor was the son of Welsh courtier Owain Tudur (anglicised to Owen Tudor) and Catherine of Valois, the widow of the Lancastrian King Henry V. Edmund Tudor and his siblings were either illegitimate, or the product of a secret marriage, and owed their fortunes to the goodwill of their legitimate half-brother King Henry VI. When the House of Lancaster fell from power, the Tudors followed.\n\nBy the late 15th century, the Tudors were the last hope for the Lancaster supporters. Edmund Tudor's son became king as Henry VII after defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, winning the Wars of the Roses. King Henry VII married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, thereby uniting the Lancastrian and York lineages.

All official documents, including Acts of Parliament, were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. An Act of Parliament gave him the title of king and stated that he \"shall aid her Highness ... in the happy administration of her Grace's realms and dominions\"[70] (although elsewhere the Act stated that Mary was to be \"sole queen\").

The acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland (previously separate sovereign states, with separate legislatures but with the same monarch) into the Kingdom of Great Britain.[88]\n\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland had shared a monarch for more than a hundred years, since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones from his first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nTimeline\n\n[edit]\n\nTitles\n\n[edit]\n\nThe standard title for all monarchs from Æthelstan until the time of King John was Rex Anglorum (\"King of the English\"). In addition, many of the pre-Norman kings assumed extra titles, as follows:\n\nÆthelstan: Rex totius Britanniae (\"King of All Britain\")\n\nEdmund the Magnificent: Rex Britanniæ (\"King of Britain\") and Rex Anglorum cæterarumque gentium gobernator et rector (\"King of the English and of other peoples governor and director\")\n\nEadred: Regis qui regimina regnorum Angulsaxna, Norþhymbra, Paganorum, Brettonumque (\"Reigning over the governments of the kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons, Northumbrians, Pagans, and British\")\n\nEadwig the Fair: Rex nutu Dei Angulsæxna et Northanhumbrorum imperator paganorum gubernator Breotonumque propugnator (\"King by the will of God, Emperor of the Anglo-Saxons and Northumbrians, governor of the pagans, commander of the British\")\n\nEdgar the Peaceful: Totius Albionis finitimorumque regum basileus (\"King of all Albion and its neighbouring realms\")\n\nCnut the Great: Rex Anglorum totiusque Brittannice orbis gubernator et rector (\"King of the English and of all the British sphere governor and ruler\") and Brytannie totius Anglorum monarchus (\"Monarch of all the English of Britain\")\n\nIn the Norman period Rex Anglorum remained standard, with occasional use of Rex Angliae (\"King of England\"). The Empress Matilda styled herself Domina Anglorum (\"Lady of the English\").\n\nFrom the time of King John onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of Rex or Regina Angliae.\n\nIn 1604 James I, who had inherited the English throne the previous year, adopted the title (now usually rendered in English rather than Latin) King of Great Britain. The English and Scottish parliaments, however, did not recognise this title until the Acts of Union of 1707 under Queen Anne (who was Queen of Great Britain rather than king).[l]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n[edit]\n\nCoronations\n\n[edit]\n\nBurials\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nCitations\n\n[edit]\n\nWorks cited\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]"
