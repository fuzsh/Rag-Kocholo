It's main article is also featured, and this is perhaps the only proper picture we will get of this historical figure.\n\nArticles this image appears in\n\nElizabeth I of England, Wealthy historical figures 2008\n\nCreator\n\nHatfield House\n\nSupport as nominator Dengero (talk)\n\nSupport Looks good to me. Juliancolton (Talk)\n\nOppose looks like scan and jpeg artifacting in there. de Bivort\n\nComment Is the left side cut off? the words appear to go off the page. Calliopejen1 (talk)\n\nYes. This scan shows the first word, \"Non,\" which is right up against the frame (the frame itself has been cropped). Chick Bowen\n\nComment. Looks like it was scanned out of a book since you can see the halftoning. Kaldari (talk)\n\nOppose her headdress is cut off and artefacts --Hadseys ChatContribs\n\nOppose several problems, but the halftoning can't be fixed. Worthy subject, something better should be available. DurovaCharge!\n\nNot promoted MER-C"
