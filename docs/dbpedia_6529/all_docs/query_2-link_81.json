        "text": "People love lists, and are perhaps even more fascinated by rankings – lists organised according to some measure of value or merit. Who were the most important women in history? The best writers or most influential artists? Our least illustrious political leaders? Who's bigger: Hitler or Napoleon? Picasso or Michelangelo? Charles Dickens or Jane Austen? John, Paul, George or Ringo?\n\nWe work in the fields of data and computer science and do not answer these questions as historians might, through a principled assessment of a person's achievements. Instead, we aggregate millions of opinions. We rank historical figures just as Google ranks web pages, by integrating a diverse set of measurements of reputation into a single consensus value.\n\nSignificance is related to fame but measures something different. According to our system, forgotten US President Chester A Arthur (who we rank at 499) is more historically significant than pop star Justin Bieber (ranked 8,633), even though Arthur may have a less devoted following and certainly has lower contemporary name recognition. We believe our computational, data-centric analysis provides new ways to understand and interpret the past.\n\nHistorically significant figures leave statistical evidence of their presence behind, if one knows where to look for it. We use several data sources to fuel our ranking algorithms. Most important is Wikipedia, the web-based, collaborative, multi-lingual encyclopedia. Wikipedia is enormous, featuring well over 3m articles in its English edition alone. But we use it in a manner quite different from the typical reader, by analysing the Wiki pages of more than 800,000 people to measure quantities that should correspond to historical significance. We would expect that more significant people should have longer Wikipedia pages than those less notable because they have greater accomplishments to report. The Wiki pages of people of higher significance should attract greater readership than those of lower significance. The elite should have pages linked to by other highly significant figures, meaning they should have a high PageRank, the measure of importance used by Google to identify important web pages. We combine these other variables into a single number using a statistical method called factor analysis. But we need one final correction: to fairly compare contemporary figures such as Britney Spears against, say, Aristotle, we must adjust for the fact that today's stars will fade from living memory over the next several generations. By analysing traces left in millions of scanned books, we hope to measure just how fast this decay occurs, and correct for it.\n\nWe have naturally received strong reactions from readers of our book Who's Bigger? complaining about our computational methodology. Certain historians have complained that Wiki cannot be trusted as a source for anything. This is pretty silly. People find Wikipedia articles to be generally accurate and informative, or else they wouldn't read them. Where do you head to read up on a new topic you are interested in? We think it is clear that anyone (or anything, like our algorithms) that has read all of Wikipedia would be in an excellent position to discourse about the most important people in recorded history.\n\nMore cogent is the complaint that our results are culturally biased because we analyse only the English edition of Wikipedia. How can we fairly assess the significance of Chinese poets against US presidents? We agree that any ranking of historical significance is indeed culturally dependent and so, yes, our rankings have an Anglocentric bias. But the depth of Wikipedia is so great that there are hundreds of articles about Chinese poets in the English edition.\n\nOthers highlight a few contemporary figures that they deem us to have overrated, such as Britney Spears (689) or Barack Obama (111), and use this anecdotal evidence to sneer. But we also conduct validation procedures, and compare our rankings to public opinion polls, Hall of Fame voting records, sports statistics, and even the prices of paintings and autographs.\n\nAnecdotal evidence is not as compelling as it might seem. British readers have complained that our algorithms don't rank British figures high enough just as strongly as Spanish readers think we are unfair to their compatriots. But our book is designed in part to generate debate.\n\nOur overall top 30\n\n1 Jesus\n\n2 Napoleon\n\n3 Muhammad\n\n4 William Shakespeare\n\n5 Abraham Lincoln\n\n6 George Washington\n\n7 Adolf Hitler\n\n8 Aristotle\n\n9 Alexander the Great\n\n10 Thomas Jefferson\n\n11 Henry VIII\n\n12 Charles Darwin\n\n13 Elizabeth I\n\n14 Karl Marx\n\n15 Julius Caesar\n\n16 Queen Victoria\n\n17 Martin Luther\n\n18 Joseph Stalin\n\n19 Albert Einstein\n\n20 Christopher Columbus\n\n21 Isaac Newton\n\n22 Charlemagne\n\n23 Theodore Roosevelt\n\n24 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\n25 Plato\n\n26 Louis XIV\n\n27 Ludwig van Beethoven\n\n28 Ulysses S Grant\n\n29 Leonardo da Vinci\n\n30 Augustus\n\nTop pre-20th-century artists\n\nArt has been a uniquely human activity for more than 40,000 years. But the names of artists went unrecorded for most of this period. The identities of several prominent Greek artists, most notably Phidias, survive through contemporary written accounts and Roman copies of their work. But the notion of artists with distinct identities then faded, not to be revived until the late middle ages. The great painters of the Renaissance dominate our rankings of the most significant pre-20th century artists.\n\n1 Leonardo da Vinci (overall ranking 29)\n\n2 Michelangelo (86)\n\n3 Raphael (140)\n\n4 Rembrandt (189)\n\n5 Titian (319)\n\n6 Francisco Goya (366)\n\n7 El Greco (465)\n\n8 Albrecht Dürer (503)\n\n9 Hans Holbein the Younger (555)\n\n10 Johannes Vermeer (567)\n\n11 Jacques-Louis David (607)\n\n12 Giotto (610)\n\n13 Diego Velázquez (693)\n\n14 Gustave Courbet (965)\n\n15 Hieronymus Bosch (983)\n\nTop modern-era artists\n\nThe Impressionist painters and their successors are at the top of our table of the most significant modern artists. Later movements such as surrealism (Salvador Dalí, 1,021) and abstract expressionism (Jackson Pollock, 1,013) are represented, but by relatively few artists.\n\n1 Vincent van Gogh (73)\n\n2 Pablo Picasso (171)\n\n3 Claude Monet (178)\n\n4 Henri Matisse (376)\n\n5 Paul Cézanne (389)\n\n6 Edgar Degas (422)\n\n7 Andy Warhol (485)\n\n8 Paul Gauguin (540)\n\n9 Pierre-Auguste Renoir (549)\n\n10 Auguste Rodin (574)\n\n11 Wassily Kandinsky (618)\n\n12 Edouard Manet (640)\n\n13 Camille Pissarro (815)\n\n14 Diego Rivera (915)\n\n15 Edvard Munch (944)\n\n16 James McNeill Whistler (1,002)\n\n17 Jackson Pollock (1,013)\n\n18 Salvador Dalí (1,021)\n\n19 Piet Mondrian (1,051)\n\n20 Georgia O'Keeffe (1,178)\n\nTop 50 literary figures\n\nRanking the world's greatest literary figures is a parlour game – just like the ranking of presidents or prime ministers. It exposes the biases inherent in everyone's world-view. But our ranking, it turns out, agrees with others: our top 50 contains 39 members of Daniel Burt's The Literary 100, including his 11 highest-ranked figures. With our Anglocentric source bias, we feature a larger number of British and US writers (but Jane Austen and Emily Dickinson are the only women to make it into the top 50).\n\n1 William Shakespeare (4)\n\n2 Charles Dickens (33)\n\n3 Mark Twain (53)\n\n4 Edgar Allan Poe (54)\n\n5 Voltaire (64)\n\n6 Oscar Wilde (77)\n\n7 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (88)\n\n8 Dante Alighieri (96)\n\n9 Lewis Carroll (118)\n\n10 Henry David Thoreau (131)\n\n11 Jane Austen (139)\n\n12 Samuel Johnson (141)\n\n13 Homer (152)\n\n14 Lord Byron (158)\n\n15 Walt Whitman (160)\n\n16 John Milton (165)\n\n17 Geoffrey Chaucer (173)\n\n18 Virgil (177)\n\n19 William Wordsworth (182)\n\n20 Stephen King (191)\n\n21 Emily Dickinson (194)\n\n22 Leo Tolstoy (196)\n\n23 Victor Hugo (208)\n\n24 George Bernard Shaw (213)\n\n25 Nathaniel Hawthorne (227)\n\n26 Fyodor Dostoyevsky (244)\n\n27 Miguel de Cervantes (246)\n\n28 Ernest Hemingway (248)\n\n29 HG Wells (249)\n\n30 Herman Melville (251)\n\n31 Rudyard Kipling (259)\n\n32 Sophocles (274)\n\n33 Samuel Taylor Coleridge (280)\n\n34 John Keats (305)\n\n35 Robert Burns (317)\n\n36 Petrarch (326)\n\n37 Percy Bysshe Shelley (329)\n\n38 George Orwell (342)\n\n39 Christopher Marlowe (374)\n\n40 Thomas Hardy (378)\n\n41 Aeschylus (386)\n\n42 Jonathan Swift (391)\n\n43 Rabindranath Tagore (397)\n\n44 Henrik Ibsen (403)\n\n45 James Joyce (406)\n\n46 Henry James (408)\n\n47 Aristophanes (418)\n\n48 Alexander Pushkin (420)\n\n49 Ben Jonson (421)\n\n50 TS Eliot (436)\n\nWe generally score popular writers such as Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll and Mark Twain higher than we think the literary establishment would. We expect them to be surprised by our rank for horror novelist Stephen King. No other contemporary writer came close to a spot in our Literary 50. But we consider King to be the Dickens [33] of our time, characterised by immense popularity, mind-boggling productivity, and even the serial novel genre."
