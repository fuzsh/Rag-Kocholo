        "text": "Elizabeth I's belongings Recorded inventories, (1574)\n\nCostume and gold and silver plate belonging to Elizabeth I were recorded in several inventories, and other documents including rolls of New Year's Day gifts. Arthur Jefferies Collins published the Jewels and Plate of Queen Elizabeth I: The Inventory of 1574 from manuscripts in 1955. The published inventory describes jewels and silver-plate belonging to Elizabeth with detailed references to other source material. Two inventories of Elizabeth's costume and some of her jewellery were published by Janet Arnold in Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlocke'd (Maney, 1988).\n\nIntroduction\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1574 the office of the Jewel House was located in a two-storey building on the south side of the White Tower. This contained the records of the jewels and packing materials for sending jewels to court.[1] The 1574 inventory was made John Astley, Master and Treasurer of the Jewel House. The Master had an annual salary of £50 and was able to exact payments from goldsmiths appointed to work for the Jewel House, and those who transported plate from the House to diplomats. The post was lucrative, but some of the perquisites of the role were exaggerated or overstated by Sir Gilbert Talbot, who was made Master in 1660 and in 1680 wrote a treatise entitled Of the Jewel house.[2] In the inventory the items were listed in categories; below an outline of the main categories is given with some examples of the 1,605 entries.\n\nThe sources used by Collins were British Library Harley MS 1560 and Stowe MS 555 (see external links for digitised manuscripts). The manuscripts represent the \"Quenis Majesties juelles plate and other stuff\" in 1574 and additions by gift or purchase over the next 20 years which were kept in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. Collins also collated information from other books and manuscripts to cross-reference information about the objects listed. Gifts of plate to the queen passed from the Privy Chamber to the Jewel House. Some pieces were melted down and others were given as diplomatic gifts. When the queen travelled, the towns she visited often gave her gifts of silver-gilt cups.\n\nJanet Arnold published an annotated wardrobe inventory now in the British Library, (Stowe MS 557),[3] consulting also a duplicate copy at the National Archives, and another inventory held by the Folger Shakespeare Library, MS V. b.72. The inventory includes some of the queen's jewels.[4]\n\nOutline of the 1574 inventory of plate\n\n[edit]\n\nGold plate\n\n[edit]\n\nJuelles of Golde\n\nno. 1 The imperial crown of England.\n\nno. 2 The sceptre of gold with a dove.\n\nno. 3 The globe or round ball (orb) with a cross.\n\nno. 4 The queen's crown (intended for a queen consort).\n\nno. 5 The queen's sceptre with a dove intended for a queen consort).

This cup, probably made in Germany, was admired in the Tower of London by Lupold von Wedel in November 1584. It was a gift at the baptism of Prince Henry in August 1594.[38]\n\nJewels of Elizabeth I and the inventories\n\n[edit]\n\nPortraits of Elizabeth depict jewels, and may indicate how they were worn. Her ruff in a portrait c.1595 is decorated with 25 red arrows of rubies feathered with pearls, and tall jewelled spikes top her hair echoing obelisks embroidered on her dress. Some of the jewellery shown in portraits reflects the pieces described in the inventories, a theme explored by the costume historian Janet Arnold,[39] and the jewellery historian Diana Scarisbrick.[40]\n\nOn 21 May 1559 Elizabeth selected a group of jewels from the Tower of London for a celebration with French ambassadors for the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis. These included two diamond-set brooches depicting David And Goliath, one with Goliath's armour composed of diamonds (a diamond-set example held by the Green Vault, Dresden is later),[41] a jewel depicting several figures with the motto In Petra Christi sancta fient foedera, with chains set with gems and other jewels.[42] It is not clear whether Elizabeth intended these items as gifts or wore them herself, but they were not included among the gifts listed by the Venetian ambassador.[43][44]\n\nElizabeth took an interest in the making of jewels in London, in 1587 asking John Spilman, her household goldsmith, to employ English and foreign (\"stranger\") diamond cutters, ruby cutters, agate cutters, clockmakers, goldsmiths, and wire workers.[45] James VI and Anna of Denmark's agents in London bought a sapphire engraved with Elizabeth's portrait in 1599.[46] A lady in waiting, and keeper of her jewellery, Blanche Parry, made an inventory in 1587, now held by the British Library, listing 628 pieces, which passed into the custody of Mary Radcliffe.[47]\n\nJewels as gifts\n\n[edit]\n\nElizabeth received gifts of jewels from courtiers at New Year, and from diplomats.[48] Lady Mary Sidney gave Elizabeth a pelican jewel as a New Year's Day gift in 1573,[49] possibly as a reproach for Elizabeth's perceived ingratitude for nursing her in 1562 when she had smallpox and Sybil Penn died. Elizabeth soon gave the pelican brooch to Sidney's sister, the Countess of Huntingdon.[50] Lady Stafford gave Elizabeth another gold pelican jewel in 1580, and two other pelican jewels appear in the inventories.[51]\n\nIn January 1585 Catherine Howard, Countess of Nottingham gave her \"a jewel of gold being a dolphin fully garnished with sparks of ruby with a personage upon his back having a lute in his hand\", a representation of the classical myth of Arion.[52] Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick gave her a jewel in the form of bay leaves with roses, a spider and a bee, in 1572. The Spanish ambassador, Antonio de Guarás, noted that in 1577 he gave Mary a jewel that was recognised to refer to Mary, Queen of Scots. It depicted Elizabeth enthroned with a queen in chains, and France and Spain submerged by Neptune.[53]\n\nElizabeth was given jewels during country house entertainments staged during her progresses.[54][55] At the Ryecote Entertainment,[56] the gifts represented the military activities of the sons of Sir Henry Norris.[57] At the Harefield Entertainment in August 1602 Elizabeth was presented with a diamond feather (or heart) and an anchor.[58] The two jewels were said to be worth £600 and £1000.[59] When Christopher Hatton was unable to join her on a progress, he gave her a jewel featuring a bagpipe, which she wore on her ruff.[60] This was an allusion to shepherds and sheep, Elizabeth's nickname for Hatton was \"her mutton\", as she herself explained to Sir Robert Cecil.[61]\n\nJewels in the Stowe inventory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe inventory has three sections of jewels, the first group has 77 items kept by Elizabeth's lady in waiting Mary Radcliffe, the second section lists 19 jewels kept by the Countess of Suffolk and transferred to Thomas Gorges, Master of the Wardrobe, to make the inventory, and the third section lists 32 jewels kept by Mary Radcliffe passed to Gorges. After the inventory was taken by the auditor Francis Gofton, Gorges returned the jewels to Radcliffe on 28 May 1603.[62] The entries have annotations in various hands which help to track the transfer of pieces to Anne of Denmark or their sale after the Union of the Crowns.[63] Some entries are given below, abridged and with modernised spelling:\n\nStowe inventory, first section\n\n[edit]\n\n[3] Item, small aglets of gold, 46 pairs. Delivered 30 January 1604 to \"Mr Robert Jessi\".[64] This may be the Scottish goldsmith Robert Jousie who was connected with King James' wardrobe.\n\n[13] A jewel of gold like an Angel, the body mother of pearl, the wings garnished with sparks of diamonds and rubies, and two antiques like horses under it garnished with like sparks of rubies and diamonds. Delivered 30 January 1604.[65]\n\nStowe inventory, second section\n\n[edit]\n\n[4] A jewel of gold like a circle of Pansies, Daisies, and other flowers, garnished with sparks of diamonds and rubies, with a butterfly of mother of pearl and a crab holding the same.[66]\n\n[6] A jewel of gold like a Pelican garnished with diamonds of sundry sorts.[67]\n\nStowe inventory, third section\n\n[edit]\n\n[11] A jewel of gold having two hands, one holding a sword, the other a trowel, both garnished with sparks of diamonds, and between the hands a garnishment of opal. This had been a New Year's Day gift in 1587.[68] The device is a well-known emblem for peace and appears in Geoffrey Whitney's Choice of Emblems (London, 1586).[69]\n\n[27] A jewel of gold like a Daisy and small flowers about it garnished with sparks of diamonds and rubies with her Majesty's picture graven on a garnet, and a sprig of three branches garnished with sparks of rubies, a pearl at the top, and a small pendant of sparks of diamonds. A New Year's day gift in 1593.[70]\n\nMissing jewels in the Folger inventory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Folger inventory (MS V.b.72) lists 22 jewels known to have been lost from Elizabeth's wardrobe. These include:[71]\n\n[1] A button of gold with five pearls lost from her Majesty's kirtle at a play at Richmond at Christmas 1595\n\n[10] Item, a diamond from a jewel like a heart fully garnished with diamonds, lost by her Majesty 14 February 1596\n\nElizabeth I and French jewellery\n\n[edit]\n\nElizabeth I, like Mary, Queen of Scots, bought jewellery in Paris. The diplomat Nicholas Throckmorton sent her a list of questions about prospective purchases in 1562, which give useful information about jewels worn in the 1560s and contemporary attitudes to purchasing and material literacy. Throckmorton discussed the borders and \"billements\" worn with hoods, noting that the length of a French style billement was different to those worn in England. There could be girdles and necklace chains in matching sets with the billements and borders. Some items were destined as gifts, and Throckmorton contrasted the cost of making, the \"fashioning\", with the weight of precious metal. Simple forms made by casting were much cheaper.[72] His questions for Elizabeth were:\n\nHow many borders, upper and nether, shall be bought?\n\nWhat number shall be engraved and \"sicelled\" which is the most costly fashion, and how many cast in the mold and wrought slightly which will be better cheap?\n\nWhether all the borders shall be enamelled, or some not?\n\nTo know the length of the said borders, because the fashion is different here to there in the length of the \"billements\"\n\nWhether to every border there shall be a chain for the neck, and a girdle with a pendant and a vase, or at least to know how many chains and girdles with vases shall be provided.\n\nHow many chains shall be provided for men, to be given in reward, and of what value, which ought rather to be of more show than fashion, because the fashion, if it be costly will eat up the weight?\n\nHow many pomanders (as you term them) called here pommes of gold shall be provided, and whether there shall be any sweet paste put in them?\n\nWhether any bracelets shall be provided, and how many pairs?\n\nHow many carcanets shall be provided?\n\nThese jewels and gold chains may have been intended as diplomatic gifts at the \"interview\", the planned meeting between Mary, Queen of Scots, and Elizabeth in England which never took place. The Earl of Pembroke became involved in buying the jewels and chains in Paris and there was some difficulty in obtaining credit from the Italian financier Cavalcanti.[73] One French piece listed in the queen's inventory was \"a chain of Paris work being white and tawny \"bugle\" slightly garnished with gold\".[74]\n\nJohn Dymocke and Eric XIV of Sweden\n\n[edit]\n\nWilliam Cecil had previously written to Throckmorton in May 1561, before Mary had returned to Scotland from France, asking him to find a goldsmith in Paris to bring or send items for Elizabeth and her ladies to \"be gay in this Court towards the progress\".[75] Cecil wrote about a jewellery purchase connected to a visit by Elizabeth's suitor, Eric XIV of Sweden. Anything unsold in England would be custom free.[76] John Dymocke, who had been a soldier and a royal usher, had a licence to import jewels. He discussed patterns drawn on parchment with Kat Ashley and Elizabeth. Elizabeth was interested in a jewel with a large ruby and pearl pendant, and Dymocke claimed she jokingly said the King of Sweden would buy it for her. Dymock went to Sweden with a portrait painter. He gave Eric XIV a pair of perfumed gloves, and discussed jewels and Elizabeth's marriage plans, although he was not an accredited diplomat. There was a scandal and Kat Ashley and the chamberer Dorothy Bradbelt were banished from court for a time.[77]\n\nElizabeth's jewels after her death\n\n[edit]\n\nElizabeth had a quantity of old jewels from the Tower of London appraised for sale in October 1600 by the goldsmiths Hugh Kayle, John Spilman, and Leonard Bushe. The consignment included a number of unmounted precious stones and counterfeit imitations including \"Dutch agates\", gold rings and buttons set with stones and cameos, pearls, gold chains, beads, billements for headdresses, seven clocks, and scrap \"broken\" gold and silver. Some of the pearls had been sewn on a gown of Elizabeth, or perhaps a gown of Mary I of England.[78]\n\nThe goldsmiths William Herrick and John Spilman reset a number of Elizabeth's gems on a gold circlet or coronet which Anne of Denmark wore to her English coronation on 25 July 1603.[79] On 12 January 1604 Herrick and Spilman were asked to assess and make an inventory of jewels that had belonged to Queen Elizabeth. King James had already given many pieces to the queen, Princess Elizabeth, and Arbella Stuart and others. Some of the remaining jewels had been transferred from the keeping of Mary Radcliffe to the Countess of Suffolk.[80] Several pieces were sold or exchanged with the goldsmith and financier Peter Vanlore. A list of jewels in the possession of Anne of Denmark in 1606 was published by Diana Scarisbrick, and includes several items formerly in Elizabeth's collection.[81]\n\nIn December 1607, King James retrieved some of Elizabeth's jewels from the Jewel House and sent them to William Herrick and John Spilman to be refurbished. He gave his wife Anne of Denmark a cup made of unicorn's horn with a gold cover (believed to guard against poison) set with diamonds and pearls, a gold jug or ewer, a salt with a branch set with sapphires and serpent's tongues (really fossilized shark teeth, also a safeguard against poisoning), and a crystal chess board with topaz and crystal pieces.[82] Later in the reign of James other lists of jewels were made, including those annexed to the crown in 1606, and those sent to Spain in 1623 at the time of the Spanish Match. These were printed in Thomas Rymer's Foedera.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nCollins, Arthur Jefferies (1955). Jewels and Plate of Queen Elizabeth I: The Inventory of 1574.
