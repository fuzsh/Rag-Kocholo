        "text": "Born the second daughter to King Henry VIII, Elizabeth gained the throne of a religiously divided England in 1558. Ruling with intelligence, the \"Virgin Queen\" Elizabeth piloted a steady course for England throughout the late 1500s, an era that came to be known after her death as \"The Golden Age\".\n\nUnlike her predecessors, Elizabeth saw the opportunities that exploration and expansion into the New World provided and secretly aided in several such ventures including Sir Walter Raleighâ€™s Roanoke voyages."
