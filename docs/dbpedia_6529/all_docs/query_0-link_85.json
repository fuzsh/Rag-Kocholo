The drama covers approximately the last 24 years of her nearly 45-year reign. Part 1 focuses on the final years of her relationship with the Earl of Leicester, played by Jeremy Irons. Part 2 focuses on her subsequent relationship with the Earl of Essex, played by Hugh Dancy.\n\nThe series originally was broadcast in the United Kingdom in two two-hour segments on Channel 4. It later aired on HBO in the United States, CBC and TMN in Canada, ATV in Hong Kong, ABC in Australia, and TVNZ Television One in New Zealand.\n\nThe series went on to win Emmy, Peabody, and Golden Globe Awards.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nPart 1\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1579, Elizabeth I refuses to marry. Her chief advisor, Lord Burghley, and her spymaster, Francis Walsingham, plan to have her wed the Duke of Anjou in order to cement an English-French alliance against Spain while her favourite, the Earl of Leicester, opposes the plan due to his own long-standing affections for her. Upon arriving in England, the Duke meets and courts Elizabeth, gaining her favour. She angrily banishes Leicester from court when she learns he is married and decides not to marry the Duke due to negative popular opinion towards the match.\n\nSeven years later, Elizabeth welcomes Leicester back. Walsingham gathers evidence to prove that Elizabeth's Catholic cousin Mary, Queen of Scots is plotting to have her killed. Elizabeth is reluctant to have Mary executed because of the war it might ignite between England and Spain. During a secret meeting at her prison, Mary gives Elizabeth her word that she does not want her dead. Elizabeth hesitantly gives Leicester command of the English campaign to assist the Dutch against Spain, which fails, giving Spain control of Holland. Once it is proven that Mary has in fact been conspiring against Elizabeth's life, Mary is judged guilty of treason and executed.\n\nAfter negotiations between England and Spain fail, a fleet of Spanish ships are sent for England. Elizabeth gives Leicester command of the land forces and rides with him and his stepson the Earl of Essex to Tilbury, where they expect the Spanish to attempt a landing and where Elizabeth delivers a speech to the troops. The Spanish Armada is ultimately defeated, but Leicester falls gravely ill just as they learn of the English victory. Later, on his deathbed, Leicester bids Essex to take care of Elizabeth.\n\nPart 2\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 1589, Elizabeth has made a favourite of Essex and falls in love with him. She is openly outraged when he takes part in an English military expedition to Lisbon against her wishes, but she forgives him in spite of his failure to take the city from the Spanish. She grants him 10 percent of a tax on sweet wines and a seat on the Privy Council, of which Lord Burghley's son Robert Cecil was also recently made a member. Essex and Cecil develop a rivalry, as illustrated by the affair of Elizabeth's physician Dr. Lopez, who is hanged based on evidence brought forth by Essex of his participation in a Spanish plot against Elizabeth, evidence proven questionable after the fact by Cecil.\n\nEssex's political ambitions begin to clash with his devotion and loyalty to Elizabeth. As Elizabeth finds her young lover's behavior becoming increasingly worrisome, she draws closer to Cecil, who is named Secretary of State following the death of Walsingham. Essex is publicly hailed upon his return to England after taking Cadiz from the Spanish, but his relationship with Elizabeth begins to deteriorate. She and Cecil suspect Essex of secretly communicating with James VI of Scotland, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, a potential successor to the English throne. After Burghley's death, Elizabeth sends Essex to Ireland to put down a rebellion but he instead makes a truce and returns to England alone. Elizabeth puts Essex under house arrest.\n\nEssex and his followers fail to start a rebellion in London and are captured. At his trial, Essex accuses Cecil of collaborating with Spain but has no evidence to prove this, and he is found guilty of treason and beheaded. Some time later, Elizabeth becomes listless, going for three weeks without eating before making her way to her bed and requesting a priest, saying she is minded to die.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nEight actors receive billing in the opening credits of one or both parts of Elizabeth I:\n\nHelen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth I\n\nJeremy Irons as Earl of Leicester\n\nHugh Dancy as Earl of Essex\n\nToby Jones as Robert Cecil\n\nPatrick Malahide as Sir Francis Walsingham\n\nIan McDiarmid as Lord Burghley\n\nBarbara Flynn as Mary, Queen of Scots\n\nEwen Bremner as King James VI\n\nThe full cast of characters of each part is listed in the closing credits of each part. Apart from those receiving star billing, those in Part 1 include:\n\nJérémie Covillault as Duke of Anjou\n\nSimon Woods as Gifford\n\nDiana Kent as Lady Essex\n\nToby Salaman as Dr Lopez\n\nGeoffrey Streatfeild as Sir Anthony Babington\n\nDavid Delve as Sir Francis Drake\n\nMartin Marquez as Don Bernardino de Mendoza\n\nRimantas Bagdzevicius as Howard of Effingham\n\nApart from those receiving star billing and Salaman as Dr Lopez, those in Part 2 include:\n\nWill Keen as Francis Bacon\n\nEddie Redmayne as Southampton\n\nBen Pullen as Sir Walter Raleigh\n\nCharlotte Asprey as Frances Walsingham\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to director Tom Hooper, Mirren \"came onboard before the script was written because the feeling was that it was only worth doing if she would play it.\"[2] Hooper and Mirren had previously worked together on the police procedural drama Prime Suspect 6 (2003). The project on Elizabeth I was originally going to be two hours and focus on her relationship with the Earl of Essex, but Mirren \"felt that there should be more politics\" according to writer Nigel Williams.[1] The series was filmed in Vilnius, Lithuania, where the massive sets were constructed inside a sports arena[1] that was abandoned in the 1970s.[3] The Whitehall Palace set was constructed to scale from original plans.[1]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Elizabeth I received an average score of 81% based on 21 reviews.[4]\n\nDavid Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Mirren's performance \"is powerful enough to shatter your television screen, not to mention any notion you might have had that if you've seen one Elizabeth—Bette Davis, Glenda Jackson or Cate Blanchett, for example—you've seen them all.\" He added that Irons, who he felt \"has sometimes settled into craggy self-parody in lesser films [...] invests Leicester with as much depth and complexity as he can, and he is every bit Mirren's equal onscreen.\"[5]\n\nBrian Lowry of Variety felt that the second part was better than the first, praised Mirren's performance and wrote that \"[director] Tom Hooper, who previously directed Mirren in Prime Suspect 6, indulges [writer Nigel] Williams' penchant for long, theatrical monologues, which require a little getting used to in the slow early going. Gradually, however, as with the best British costume drama, the narrative becomes absorbing.\"[6]\n\nAlessandra Stanley of The New York Times wrote that Mirren is \"one of the few actresses working today who can actually convincingly play a historical figure in her 40s\" and that Elizabeth I was more historically accurate than Elizabeth (1998), though she felt that \"[the miniseries'] interpretation, like so many others, wallows in the painful self-pity of a powerful, aging woman who craves true love\". While the miniseries is visually \"no match for the 1998 movie\" to Stanley, she concludes that Elizabeth I offers \"a richly drawn portrait of a powerful woman who is both ruthless and sentimental, formidable and mercurial, vain and likable.\"[7]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Nominee(s) Result Ref.\n\n2006\n\nBritish Academy Television Craft Awards Best Costume Design Mike O'Neill Nominated [8] Best Make-Up and Hair Design Fae Hammond Nominated Best Original Television Music Rob Lane Won Best Production Design Eve Stewart Nominated Broadcast Awards Best Drama Series or Serial Nominated Broadcasting Press Guild Awards Best Actress Helen Mirren Nominated [9] Golden Nymph Awards Outstanding Actress – Mini Series Won [10] Online Film & Television Association Awards Best Miniseries Nominated [11] Best Actress in a Motion Picture or Miniseries Helen Mirren Nominated Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture or Miniseries Hugh Dancy Nominated Jeremy Irons Won Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture or Miniseries Barbara Flynn Nominated Best Direction of a Motion Picture or Miniseries Nominated Best Writing of a Motion Picture or Miniseries Won Best Ensemble in a Motion Picture or Miniseries Nominated Peabody Awards Company Pictures and Channel 4\n\nin association with HBO Films Won [12] Primetime Emmy Awards Outstanding Miniseries George Faber, Suzan Harrison,\n\nCharles Pattinson, Barney Reisz,\n\nand Nigel Williams Won [13] Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie Helen Mirren Won Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie Hugh Dancy Nominated Jeremy Irons Won Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special Tom Hooper Won Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special Nigel Williams Nominated Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or Movie Leon McCarthy, Eve Stewart, and Sarah Whittle Won Outstanding Casting for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special Doreen Jones Won Outstanding Costumes for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special Samantha Horn and Mike O'Neill (for \"Part 2\") Won Outstanding Hairstyling for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special Fae Hammond and Su Westwood (for \"Part 2\") Won Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries or a Movie Beverley Mills (for \"Part 1\") Won Melanie Oliver (for \"Part 2\") Nominated Outstanding Single-Camera Sound Mixing for a Miniseries or a Movie Ken Campbell and Paul Hamblin (for \"Part 1\") Nominated Royal Television Society Awards Drama Serial Nominated [14] Satellite Awards Best Miniseries Nominated [15] Best Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television Hugh Dancy Nominated Best Actress in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television Helen Mirren Nominated Television Critics Association Awards Outstanding Achievement in Movies, Miniseries and Specials Nominated [16] Women's Image Network Awards Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie Helen Mirren Won\n\n2007\n\nAmerican Cinema Editors Awards Best Edited Miniseries or Motion Picture for Non-Commercial Television Beverley Mills (for \"Part 1\") Nominated [17] American Film Institute Awards Top 10 Television Programs Won [18] Costume Designers Guild Awards Outstanding Made for Television Movie or Miniseries Mike O'Neill Won [19] Critics' Choice Awards Best Picture Made for Television Won [20] Golden Globe Awards Best Miniseries or Television Film Won [21] Best Actress in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television Helen Mirren Won Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television Jeremy Irons Won Producers Guild of America Awards David L.
