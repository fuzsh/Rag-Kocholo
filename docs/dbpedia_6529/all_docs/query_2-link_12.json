        "text": "Born in 1533 to Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, she was Queen of England from 1558 to her death in 1603. She inherited the throne after the death of her half-sister, Queen \"Bloody\" Mary Tudor. Her reign is often called the Elizabethan or \"Golden Age\" because it was a time period of great advancement and achievement in England. She has been called an outstanding politician, orator, tactician, and musician. Elizabeth's reign was marked by her effective use of Parliament and the Privy Council, a small advisory body of the important state officials, and by the development of legal institutions in English counties. During her reign, Elizabeth unified a Protestant England against the Catholic Spanish and defeated the Spanish armada in 1588. She was responsible for English exploration of the New World and the flourishing of the economy, making England a world power. Her reign was also noted for the English Renaissance, an outpouring of poetry and drama. Elizabeth's court also became a center for poets, musicians, writers, and scholars.\n\nAnnotated Bibliography\n\nCollins, Gail. \"Just Look How Well She Governs.\" The New York Times Magazine. 18 April 1999, 97.\n\nThis article is written to give a realistic view of Queen Elizabeth I.
