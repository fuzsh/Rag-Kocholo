        "text": "Compilation of Queen Elizabeth I in fictional Media\n\nElizabeth I of England has inspired artistic and cultural works for over four centuries. The following lists cover various media, enduring works of high art, and recent representations in popular culture, film and fiction. The entries represent portrayals that a reader has a reasonable chance of encountering rather than a complete catalogue.\n\nArt, entertainment, and media\n\n[edit]\n\nThere have been numerous notable portrayals of Queen Elizabeth in a variety of art forms, and she is the most filmed British monarch.[1][2] George MacDonald Fraser wrote \"no historic figure has been represented more honestly in the cinema, or better served by her players\".[3]\n\nAnime\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the anime Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, which is set in an alternate time line, Elizabeth (who remained single throughout her life even in this alternate history), bears an illegitimate son. The potential fathers—Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester; Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex; and Carl, Duke of Britannia—gain influence and power with this knowledge. After Elizabeth's death in 1603, the Golden Age of the Tudor dynasty begins when her son, who would become Henry IX, ascends to the throne.\n\nThe Phantom Blood arc of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure tells the story of the fictional knights Tarkus and Bruford, who served Mary, Queen of Scots. In the story, Elizabeth tricks them into accepting execution in return for Mary's safety.\n\nArt\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Portraiture of Elizabeth I glorified her during her reign and masked her age in their later portraits. Elizabeth was often painted in rich and stylised gowns. Elizabeth is sometimes shown holding a sieve, a symbol of virginity.[4]\n\nThe installation artwork The Dinner Party features a place setting for Elizabeth.[5]\n\nComics\n\n[edit]\n\nThere have been numerous depictions of Elizabeth I in satirical drawings.
