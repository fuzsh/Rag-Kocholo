        "text": "3 Lewis and his intellectual surroundings\n\nAlthough Lewis Caerleon was a physician, no medical treatise is known to have been written by him. His writings are only devoted to astronomy and seem to serve a particular purpose: eclipse computations. This particular interest in eclipses may be due to his medical practice which probably implied medical astrology. Universal judgements on the basis of eclipses were used in annual prognostications and in both medical astrology and astrometeorology.Footnote 30 According to the extant sources, his writings were concentrated within a short period of time between 1481 and 1485. Several extant manuscripts copied and commissioned by Lewis allow us to reconstruct the chronology of his astronomical compositions. We will highlight three stages.\n\n3.1 Lewis’s astronomical production: the early stage 1481–1482\n\nThe first evidence of his scientific activity may be found in his notebook (CUL) where he gathered several of his sources but also kept a record of some of his compositions. This corresponds to the early stages of his Opus eclipsium, including drafts and early versions of his writings. Although Pearl Kibre and other scholars understandably assumed that this manuscript contained the first version of Lewis’s eclipse and parallax tables, one of the authors of this article (Laure Miolo) recently showed that those tables, and probably the canons appended to them, were authored by a Merton College fellow named John Curteys (d. 1448/1449).Footnote 31 Those tables based on the Oxford meridian certainly laid the foundations for Lewis’s work on eclipses, since he expanded them and based his own tables on them. He employed for the first time his revision of John Curteys’ tables in the computation of the solar eclipse of 28 May 1481 based on the Oxford meridian. This eclipse was computed with four different sets of tables: the Toledan Tables and John of Lignères’s Tables of 1322 in the first instance,Footnote 32 and then, from the true conjunction (found with the Alfonsine Tables), John Curteys’s tables called nove tabule.Footnote 33 A last set of tables is used by Lewis who named them nove tabule expanse, corresponding to the revision he made from the nove tabule.Footnote 34 It should be noted that John Curteys’s tables based on the Oxford meridian are derived from the parameters of Richard of Wallingford’s Albion,Footnote 35 as is the revision by Lewis, who expanded his tables ‘to the individual minutes, rejecting all fractions up to the minute, both in time and in motion’.Footnote 36 Those expanded tables are not found in the notebook, but may well coincide with the tables ‘expanded to the individual minutes’ dated to 1482 and found in manuscripts that Lewis commissioned and supervised after his release in 1485.Footnote 37 In any case, even if the nove tabule expanse used for the computation of the solar eclipse of 1481 correspond to an earlier state based on the Oxford meridian, the 1482 tables clearly derive from it.\n\nThe same computation retains two other methods to calculate the solar eclipse, an arithmetical and a geometrical procedure. The latter one is entitled Demonstratio geometrica and is based on mean values and on the geometrical model explained in the first part of Richard of Wallingford’s Albion.Footnote 38 This seems to be a first attempt to apply a method that Lewis fully theorised later in a canon entitled, De modo calculandi eclipses geometrice sine tabulis.Footnote 39 The computation of the 1481 solar eclipse clearly displays the genesis of Lewis’s astronomical works, and how he carefully applied the tables he derived and method he developed for this calculation.\n\nAmongst the earliest astronomical composition of the physician there are two tables, one devoted to the difference between the mean velocities of the two luminaries in hours of time at mean syzygy, and the other displaying the difference of velocities at true syzygies. They are accompanied by short canons.Footnote 40 That both tables are the starting point of a larger and expanded work becomes clear with BLa, which retains a whole set of tables of syzygies entitled, ‘Tabula revolutionis coniunctionum et oppositionum solis et lune cum motibus’ (BLa, pp. 72–117) with their canons (BLa, pp. 117–118). This more extensive set was probably developed in 1482, given the use of an exemplum operationis (an example of calculation) based on the first conjunction of this very same year.Footnote 41\n\nLewis’s notebook displays some of the early stages of his astronomical compositions that we may date to around 1481 based on the eclipse computation. It should be underlined that those different attempts, especially the eclipse and parallax tables, are all based on the Oxford latitude. This may be due to his main source, John Curteys, whose tables are based on this same latitude, but it is also likely that at that time, Lewis was himself in Oxford where he had access to Merton College manuscripts as we shall see shortly. If we summarize the information provided by CUL, except several notes and computational examples, Lewis surely authored: (1) a set of eclipse tables that are not extant, called nove tabule expanse, perhaps a first version of the 1482 tables; (2) an attempt at a ‘geometrical’ method of eclipse computation; (3) a table of mean and true syzygies; (4) the computation of the solar eclipse of 28 May 1481.\n\n3.2 The development of an astronomical programme 1482–1483\n\nThree other manuscripts help to provide a better picture of Lewis’s compositions. They were all commissioned and supervised by him as can be seen from the autograph notes corrigitur or relegitur written in a pale ink in the lower margins of the volumes. All of them belong to a publication process carefully planned by Lewis after 1485, since they all display works dated to that year, including the computation of the solar eclipse of March 1485, and refer to his imprisonment by Richard III. That they all proceed from the same publishing endeavour seems clear, since only Lewis’s works are contained in those manuscripts copied by professional scribes.\n\nTwo of them are what might be called twin manuscripts. Cambridge, St John’s College MS B 19 (hereafter CSJ) and BL, Royal MS 12 G I (BLr) are indeed both copied on sixteen folios of parchment, have the same dimensions and contain the same texts and tables ordered in exactly the same way.Footnote 42 The only difference is that they were both copied by two different scribes. No other evidence allows us to say for whom these volumes were intended, although CSJ displays a clear chain mark on the upper cover indicating that the manuscript entered in an institution. However, the volume does not correspond to the records related to Clare College or Merton College, and may well coincide with the donations to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge mentioned by Lewis in his notebook. Despite the lack of evidence regarding the provenance of both codices, it seems that the physician’s purpose was to provide two different people or institutions with his eclipse writings. Indeed, the contents of both manuscripts are only related to eclipses, which contrasts with the third volume BLa, which contains a larger and more diverse number of works produced by Lewis. BLa is a large manuscript consisting of 128 pages of parchment, copied by the same scribe as BLr and may be considered Lewis’s Opera omnia. The large chain mark on the contemporary blind-tooled upper cover confirms that the manuscript belonged to an institution, which seems to be Clare College.Footnote 43 As BLa is Lewis Caerleon’s Opera omnia, it retains similar works as in CSJ and BLr in addition to other writings which are not displayed in the twin manuscripts.\n\nMost of the eclipse work was produced by the royal physician in 1482. A mention predating the elaboration of the eclipse and parallax tables may be found in his notebook in front of parallax tables said to be excerpted from John Somer’s book. In some way, this short note describes a part of Lewis Caerleon’s programme:\n\nWith God’s favour, I propose to build other new parallax tables based on the meridian of the University of Cambridge and new eclipse tables with all tables for the same purpose.Footnote 44\n\nAs was the case with John Curteys’s eclipse tables, the revised and expanded tables made by Lewis in 1482 are based on the parameters of the Albion, more particularly from Book I, chapters 18, 19 and 21 containing the diameter values needed for computing a part of these tables.Footnote 45 As stated in the short note, the new parallax tables elaborated by Lewis are indeed based on the latitude of Cambridge as stated in their headings.Footnote 46 This information is also repeated in both eclipse canons found in the twin manuscripts.Footnote 47 Although the parallax tables are designed for Cambridge, the heading of the solar eclipse tables provide valuable evidence about the context of composition. They were composed in London, when Lewis was physician of Margaret Beaufort.Footnote 48 Those tables provide entries for lunar/solar eclipses digits, the difference of digits between the apogee and perigee, the minuta casus and dimidium more. The eclipse tables of 1482 are accompanied with two sets of canons elaborated at different times. The twin manuscripts are the only witnesses displaying both canons and a mention at the end of one of the texts provides a better understanding of the context. It reads: ‘Seek at the end of the next quire for the other canons that I composed before I was incarcerated by King Richard’.Footnote 49 A first version of the canons was, therefore, composed in 1482, whereas another text was composed after 1485.Footnote 50\n\nAmongst the eclipse works dated to around 1482 and contained in the three manuscripts there are canons to parallax tables, the method to compute an eclipse geometrically without tables and the table of concordance between the radii values excerpted from Richard of Wallingford’s Albion and al-Battānī’s De scientia astrorum already displayed in the notebook. This work was pursued with new interpolation tables made by Lewis in 1483.Footnote 51 Those sets of eclipse and parallax tables were finally used to compute the eclipse of 16 March 1485. Along with the detailed computation, the twin manuscripts also include the comparison between the computation and the observation made by Lewis, although it is absent from BLa.\n\nCSJ and BLr were conceived by Lewis as an opus eclipsium, an instrument for predicting eclipses. He certainly selected the material to be included in both manuscripts. The purpose of BLa is slightly different, since its likely aim was to assume the status of opera omnia. In that context, BLa retains more eclipse material, such as an introduction to the complete eclipse work as well as a unique set of eclipse tables based on al-Battānī’s values composed in 1482 (BLa, pp. 61–64). The introduction explains why Lewis has chosen to keep only the tables based on the values provided by the Albion instead of the sets of tables deriving from al-Battānī’s De scientia astrorum. He tested the accuracy of both sets of tables in predicting the solar eclipse of 17 May 1482, and ultimately endorsed the Albion’s values.Footnote 52 As was the case with the eclipse of 28 May 1481, Lewis tested his own tables for the 1482 eclipse. Hence, the presence of this set in the twin manuscripts.Footnote 53\n\nIn this eclipse work, the equation of time was necessary to calculate eclipses. It is mentioned in the solar eclipse canons written by Lewis in 1482 and 1485 as part of the requirements for the calculation:\n\n[Canons of 1482] Canones eclipsium solis secundum easdem tabulas. Pro quo primitus ista sunt requirenda et memorie commendanda, scilicet tempus vere coniunctionis luminarium, diebus equatis, verus locus luminarium, argumentum verum lune, superation lune in una hora [...]Footnote 54\n\n[Canons of 1485] Circa calculationem eclipsis solis ista sunt primitus requirenda et memorie commendanda, scilicet, tempus vere coniunctionius luminarium, diebus equatis gradus ascendentis pro eodem tempore verus locus luminarium, argumentum verum lune superatio lune in una hora [...]Footnote 55\n\nThe equation of time is also used in his own eclipse computations. For the solar eclipse of 28 May 1481, Lewis computed the correction according to the equation of time on the basis of two different sets of tables, the Toledan Tables and John of Lignères Tables of 1322:\n\nTempus vere coniunctionis diebus non equatis post meridiem prescriptis 3 hore, 51 minuta, 45 secunda, 31 tertia\n\nEquatio dierum secundum magistrum Johannem de Lineriis, 19 minuta, 18 secunda, 16 tertia, 30 quarta\n\nEquatio dierum secundum Azarchelem 20 minuta, 21 secunda, 32 tertia.Footnote 56\n\nSimilarly, a correction by the equation of time is given in his calculation of the solar eclipse of 16 March 1485: 9 min and 36 s.Footnote 57 To correct the time of true syzygy by the equation of time was, therefore, an important step in eclipse prediction. This may explain why in 1485 Lewis decided to construct his own table.\n\n3.3 The Opera omnia and its contents\n\nIf Lewis Caerleon’s main focus was on eclipse prediction, he gathered a large amount of information and materials in order to derive new eclipse and parallax tables. BLa is the only surviving example of these works, although some early drafts can be identified in the notebook. The manuscript is divided into different sections covering spherical astronomy, prediction of eclipses, arithmetic/trigonometry, and the equation of time.\n\nThe trigonometric section begins with a table of sines and chords ascribed to Simon Bredon (d. 1372) and revised by Lewis Caerleon, followed by canons composed by the royal physician.Footnote 58 The revision offered by Lewis consists in expanding the table to every minute of arc, which is said to be more precise than al-Battānī’s table. BLa is the only witness to this table, although Bale saw a manuscript in Clare College which contained a similar table along with related texts.Footnote 59 The manuscript is described by Bale as follows:\n\nSimon Bredon, Wichecombensis, astrorum magister, scripsit:\n\n[1] Commentum super aliquas demonstrationes Almagesti: Assensiones equalium portionum zodiaci.\n\n[2] Tabulas cordarum: Arcus, sinus rectus, sinus versus.\n\n[3] Calculationes cordarum: Ad alleviationem laboris calculanti.\n\nClaruit A. D. 1386.\n\nEx aula Clarensi Cantabrigie.Footnote 60\n\nThe first item corresponds to Simon Bredon’s Commentum super Almagesti, Book I, and the incipit given is from Book I, Chapter 12.Footnote 61 This was followed by the table of chords and a short text which may correspond to a canon describing the method of computing chords. However, none of the other witnesses to Simon’s commentary agree with this manuscript which may have been lost or dispersed at some point. However, the presence of this volume in Clare College may point to Lewis Caerleon’s main source for his adaptation of Simon’s table.\n\nThe section devoted to the sines and chords is followed by shadow tables and their canons. The canons mainly refer to John of Lignères’s spherical astronomy canons Cuiuslibet arcus,Footnote 62 and include a short text explaining how to make an instrument using the back of the astrolabe’s alidade to measure angles.Footnote 63 This section also shows a justification of his shadow tables, which were used to calculate the maximum declination of the Sun and to make astronomical observations. This portion on arcs and sines ends with a table of square roots showing an example of an altitude calculation based on Lewis’s shadow table. Interestingly, the explicit gives a precise date for the preparation of this section. It was indeed completed in London on 30 April 1482.Footnote 64 As in the other parts of the manuscript, Lewis includes all the material needed to calculate other pieces. In particular, the tables attributed to Simon Bredon were used by Lewis to prepare his shadow tables. This explicit also clearly shows that the author has thought of the thematic divisions as independent opera, which he put together as a whole opera omnia.\n\nThe Opus eclipsium follows directly as a separate section, introduced by a one-page statement which has only survived in BLa. This introductory text provides the year of elaboration, 1482, and the method used by Lewis to produce the eclipse tables. In particular, it highlights how he tested his two sets of tables in the context of the eclipse computation of 17 May 1482.Footnote 65 Interestingly, Lewis not only provides both sets of eclipse tables, parallax tables and their canons, but also includes all the material used in the preparation of this work. Thus, after the introduction, two pages are devoted to the compilation of eclipse tables based on al-Battānī's values.Footnote 66 Diameters and radii and related material taken from the Arabic astronomer’s work are carefully listed, followed by tabular calculations based on them.Footnote 67 The tables are said to have been made in 1482.Footnote 68 A similar compilation of radii and diameters and calculation materials is found right after, but this time based on Richard of Wallingford’s Albion.Footnote 69 In contrast to the al-Battānī section, a short text introduces the method used by Lewis to calculate the tables and justifies his final decision to retain Richard of Wallingford's values rather than those of al-Battānī.Footnote 70 According to this explanation, Lewis did not have a direct access to the Arabic astronomer’s treatise, but rather to the Albion and a compilation taken from the book of a fellow of Merton College, Walter Hertt (d. 1484).Footnote 71 Instead of following the pages dedicated to the table calculations, the two sets of eclipse tables conclude the Opus eclipsium. Rather, the material that immediately follows is devoted to other steps of the calculation of eclipses. The table of proportion for proceeding to the interpolation between two eclipse tables is, therefore, necessary to compute the time between the beginning and the middle of an eclipse, the number of digits of the eclipse and the minutes of immersion. It is this type of table, derived from Almagest VI, 8, that Lewis developed.Footnote 72 Following his usual method, a canon first explains the procedure for calculating the table, giving the details of the geometric model, including two diagrams.Footnote 73 Then, the table of proportions extended by Lewis to the single degree is copied just after a table allowing the calculation of the argument with which to enter the table, the lunar anomaly.Footnote 74\n\nLewis devotes a considerable part of the manuscript to the computation of the parallax tables.Footnote 75 The different stages of the elaboration of the tables are thoroughly recorded by the author, notably some components related to the primum mobile necessary to derive those tables. This subdivision of the manuscript is introduced by a brief canon explaining the principles and prerequisite values of the parallax table, which in turn acts as an introduction to the tables of right and oblique ascension that Lewis composed.Footnote 76 This also leads Lewis to record and compare a list of different values for the obliquity of the ecliptic excerpted from the Almagest, al-Battānī, Jābir ibn Aflaḥ, Simon Bredon and John Hobroke.Footnote 77 Interestingly the tables are all based on the Cambridge latitude whereas some values, such as the solar parallax in altitude, are based on London.Footnote 78 Similarly, the exemplum calculationis just before the closing of the parallax section takes the latitude 52;20° of Cambridge.Footnote 79\n\nThe chapter on eclipses contained in BLa ends with a copy of both sets of eclipse tables made in 1482 (respectively, based on al-Battānī and Richard of Wallingford) followed by the eclipse canons composed in 1485 and the computation of the solar eclipse of 16 March 1485 called Exemplum calculandi eclipsis Solis per novas tabulas que contingit anno Domini imperfecto 1485 post meridiem 16 diei Martii.Footnote 80 This last piece clearly shows that Lewis was keen to test the tables he had compiled as well as his method of calculating eclipses. It is probably a way of demonstrating the accuracy and thus the legitimacy of his own work.\n\nThe last part of the manuscript displays a long set of tables devoted to the difference between the mean velocities of the two luminaries probably made, according to their canons, in 1482.Footnote 81 The equation of time material is situated just after this canon and is followed by a different range of materials, such as a table of multiplication and division for sexagesimal numbers and canons developing Lewis’s geometrical method to compute the quantity (the magnitude of the eclipse, that is the part of the disk which is obscured) and duration of an eclipse.Footnote 82 The volume ends with canons for calculating parallax.Footnote 83\n\n6 Lewis’s calculation of the equation of time\n\nThe newly computed table by Lewis for the equation of time is uniquely contained in BLa on page 121, according to the modern pagination, and is reproduced in Fig. 1. It bears the title “Tabula equationis dierum in motu et in tempore per me Lodowycum Caerlyon noviter facta anno domino 1485 in turre Londoniarum.” As is common for most tables for the equation of time, the values are tabulated individually for each of the thirty integer degrees of a sign, for all twelve signs of the zodiac.Footnote 140 The table is presented as a standalone, without right ascension that is sometimes displayed jointly with the equation of time, and starts with the first degree of Aries. A later, different hand consecutively added one of the twelve numbers 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, …, 8 on top of the zodiacal signs starting from Aries (9) to Pisces (8).Footnote 141 In the margin, probably added by the same later hand, there is a note “signa argumenti \\(\\odot\\) et debes addendum unum gradum continue ad \\(\\odot\\,\\) argumentum in cum intras cum argumento \\(\\odot\\,\\) pro equa.” Exceptional for Lewis’s table is that the individual values for the equation of time are given in both, time-degrees and hours of time. Clearly the latter values in hours of time, given to minutes and seconds, are derived from the former values in time-degrees, given to degrees and minutes, simply by multiplication by four.Footnote 142 Therefore, the seconds of the values given in hours of time are multiples of four. In the three columns for Virgo, Capricorn, and Aquarius; however, the values for the equation of time in time-degrees have an additional sub-column for seconds. In each of these three sub-columns there is exactly one non-zero value, which indeed is given to seconds of time-degrees with an absolute value around 30 s. Apparently, in these three cases, Lewis has computed with an increased precision to seconds to reduce the error from rounding. Therefore, the three corresponding values for the minutes given in hours of time are not multiples of four but multiples of two.Footnote 143 In the remaining 357 cases, all values for hours of time are multiples of four and are correctly computed from the values given in time degrees.Footnote 144 Like for every table of the equation of time there are four maxima that may serve to classify the particular table. Lewis’s equation of time has a maximum of 5;11° (20;44 min) at Taurus 23°–30°, a minimum of 2;55° (11;40 min) at Cancer 30°–Leo 3°, a second maximum of 8;12° (32;48 min) at Scorpio 7°–9°, and a second minimum of 0;0° (0;0 min) at Aquarius 21°–23°. As already indicated by its title, this table is indeed unprecedented and newly computed by Lewis. From our first visual inspection of the table, especially with regard to the three cases with increased precision, we might infer that Lewis was a very accurate and precise calculator.Footnote 145\n\nThis assumption, of Lewis being an accurate calculator, is immediately verified when we perform a non-linear multiparameter fit of his table for the equation of time using the modern formula (1). From our preceding discussion of the table, we already inferred that the conversion factor is given by \\(D=15^\\circ /{\\text{h}}\\). For the non-linear fit, we used all 360 values of the equation of time given in hours of time, thus, without assuming any underlying interpolation grid.Footnote 146 The result is summarized in Table 1.\n\nThe confidence intervals for the parameters fit perfectly well with historically attested values. The interval for the solar eccentricity \\(e\\) leaves no doubt that Lewis used the table for the equation of the Sun from the Parisian Alfonsine Tables, as we would expect. The solar apogee with a longitude of around 91° indeed corresponds to a time around 1485 for which Lewis explicitly states he computed the table.Footnote 147 From the interval for the obliquity we further conclude that Lewis appears to have used a common table of right ascension that is based on an obliquity of \\(\\varepsilon =23;35^\\circ\\), attributed to al-Battānī, and that circulated widely with the Parisian Alfonsine Tables as well as with the Toledan Tables.Footnote 148 This is quite surprising, because Lewis took some pains to derive a novel table of right ascension that is based on an updated obliquity of \\(\\varepsilon {\\prime}=23;\\mathrm{28,17}^\\circ\\) that he and Simon Bredon attested for their own time. This new table of right ascension and its derivation is also included in the same manuscript with Lewis’s new table for the equation of time.Footnote 149 Why he would not use his novel table of right ascension for his novel table of the equation of time must remain unanswered. Perhaps Lewis derived the new table of right ascension only after he recomputed the equation of time or he simply had no access to his own table of right ascension during his imprisonment in the Tower of London, where he stated he computed his table of the equation of time.\n\nWhen we employ historically attested and plausible values for the parameters, i.e. the obliquity \\(\\varepsilon =23;35^\\circ\\), the solar eccentricity \\(e=2;\\mathrm{16,4}\\), the longitude of the solar apogee \\({\\lambda }_{{\\text{aux}}}=91^\\circ\\), and keep the best-fit value for the epoch constant \\(c=4;\\mathrm{4,47}^\\circ\\), for which there is no historical equivalent, we find perfect agreement between Lewis’s table and the modern formula: the curve of the residuals that results from subtracting Lewis’s values from the modern computation is plotted in Fig. 2. The standard deviation that corresponds to this fit amounts to 1;52,47 s. Given the fact that we used modern mathematics and a functional derivation compared to Lewis’s possible use of other sub-tables and sexagesimal arithmetic, the agreement is very good.\n\nSo how did Lewis compute his table? Luckily, the exact details, including every step of his computation, are also included in BLa. On pages 119–120, right before the final table of the equation of time, there is a large table with intermediate results by which Lewis computed the table of the equation of time. Moreover, he also compiled a text, copied on page 118, that explains the nature of the problem and the necessary calculational steps. In the following we will analyze in detail Lewis’s computational procedure in order to show that it is entirely different from modern understanding and skillfully shaped towards the use of tables for the solar equation and right ascension.\n\nThe intermediate table composed by Lewis in order to compute the equation of time has the title “Compositio tabule equationis dierum per me Lodowycum anno Christi 1485 supponendo augem solis in primo gradu Cancri perfecto cuius compositionis canones proponuntur in proximo folio ad signum tale \\(\\odot\\). Aux vera Solis in Cancri 1 gradu.” The table has 8 columns and 362 rows. There is one row for each integer degree of the full circle, where two rows appear twice for reasons that will become clear immediately. The columns and their content are summarized in Table 2.\n\nAlthough the column for the equation of time in time-degrees has a sub-column for seconds, only two out of 362 values are given to seconds.Footnote 150 In total the intermediate table contains 5786 numbers. We have reproduced a section from the beginning of the table in Fig. 3.\n\nLewis’s algorithm for computing the table for the equation of time comprises eight calculational steps. In addition to these eight steps it is necessary to find the “beginning of the addition” (Principium additionis) as it serves as the radix value or zero-point for the composition of the table. In conjunction with the intermediate table, the algorithm is explained in the canon of which we offer an edition and translation in the appendix. The algorithm for deriving the table for the equation of time can be summarized as follows, where the numbers in the numeration below correspond to the columns in the intermediate table and the symbol • corresponds to finding the point of the beginning of the addition:\n\n1.\n\nWrite down the mean longitudes of the Sun in integer degrees, in consecutive steps of 1°, for a full circle of 360°. Lewis starts with the value of Aquarius 18° with the aim to quickly find the “beginning of the addition”, which according to al-Battānī is around this mean solar longitude.\n\n2.\n\nFor each value of mean longitude of the Sun, determine the mean solar anomaly by subtracting the solar apogee. Lewis explicitly sets the solar apogee to be in Cancer 1° (91°). By deliberately choosing an integer value for the solar apogee, and thus rounding the proper value for 1485, Lewis can limit himself to obtain the solar anomaly in integer degrees. He thereby cleverly liberates himself from performing linear interpolation in the table of the equation of the Sun that follows in the next step.\n\n3.\n\nWith the solar anomaly, enter a table of the equation of the Sun and determine the true longitude of the Sun by subtracting (anomaly < 180°) or adding (anomaly > 180°) the solar equation from or to the integer mean longitude of the Sun. In Lewis’s case the resulting true position of the Sun is now given to seconds, according to the precision of the solar equation he used.\n\n4.\n\nDetermine the right ascension of the true solar longitude by linear interpolation in a table for right ascension. Lewis gives the result of the interpolation to seconds.\n\nFrom the values of right ascension of the true Sun in column 4, consider the difference between consecutive rows in the intermediate table and find the difference in right ascension that is the closest to the assumed progress in mean solar motion. Lewis worked with an increase of mean solar motion of 1° and, therefore, seeks the difference between right ascensions closest to 1°. In Lewis’s case, this value is found when the mean Sun progresses from Aquarius 20° to Aquarius 21°. The corresponding difference between right ascensions of the true Sun then amounts to 0;59,46°. At this point the progress of the mean Sun is approximately identical to the increase of right ascension of the true Sun. Therefore, the mean solar day will be equal in length with the apparent solar day, and therefore, the equation of time is identically zero. If this point is chosen as the radix for the equation of time, the latter will always be additive. In the margin of his table with intermediate results, therefore, Lewis marks this point, when the mean Sun is in Aquarius 20°, as the “beginning of the addition.” He thereby defines that at this point the difference between the increase in right ascension of the true Sun and the mean Sun is zero, and writes the value 0;0,0 in the fifth column of his table, as can be seen in Fig. 3. Note that this is a definition and also the reason why there are no values given in the fifth column for the first two rows. These two degrees, therefore, will reappear at the end of the intermediate table.\n\n5.\n\nStarting from the radix obtained in the previous step, determine the difference between the mean longitude under consideration and the mean longitude of the radix. Add this difference to the right ascension of the true Sun at the radix. Subtract from this value the right ascension of the true Sun under consideration. The resulting value is written into the fifth column. Let us give an explicit example: when the mean Sun is at Aquarius 21° the right ascension of the true Sun is \\(55;\\mathrm{4,33}^\\circ\\). For the point under consideration the mean Sun has advanced by 1° from the mean Sun at the radix. We, therefore, add 1° to the right ascension of the true Sun at the radix and obtain \\(54;\\mathrm{4,47}^\\circ +1^\\circ =55;\\mathrm{4,47}^\\circ\\). From this value we subtract the right ascension of the true Sun under consideration to obtain \\(55;\\mathrm{4,47}^\\circ -55;\\mathrm{4,33}^\\circ =0;\\mathrm{0,14}^\\circ\\). This value is exactly given in Lewis’s intermediate table (see Fig. 3). Note that this step literally corresponds to the geometrical meaning of the equation of time. At this stage, after performing the step for the entire circle, we have already obtained an equation of time, though for unequally spaced, fractional values of longitude of the true Sun: for the position of the true Sun given in the third column the equation of time is given in the fifth column.\n\n6.\n\nConsecutively write the integer degree of the true Sun that lies in the interval spanned by the value of the true Sun under consideration and the following row into the sixth column. Note that, due to the nature of the solar equation, there will be a few intervals that contain no or two integer degrees. The sixth column will, therefore, be shifted compared to the previous five columns.\n\n7.\n\nFor the integer degree of the true Sun in the sixth column, interpolate between the two corresponding true positions of the Sun in the third column and the corresponding values for the equation of time in the fifth column. Write the corresponding equation of time in time-degree in the seventh column.\n\n8.\n\nMultiply the equation of time given in time-degrees from the seventh column by four and write the result in minutes and seconds of the hour in the eighth column.\n\nConceptually, Lewis’s algorithm on how to derive a table for the equation of time is entirely different from the modern equation in formula (1). While the modern equation includes the solar equation \\(q\\left(\\lambda \\right)\\) as function of true anomaly, Lewis is working with a regular table for the equation of the Sun \\(\\overline{q }\\left(\\overline{\\lambda }\\right)\\) that is given for mean anomaly and which is readily found in sets of astronomical tables. Furthermore, Lewis does not add right ascension, as proposed by the modern formula (1), but determines the right ascensions of the true Sun. Finally, the epoch constant which assures positivity of the equation of time, is not an additive constant in Lewis’s case but rather corresponds to a specific point on the sphere from which he starts his derivation—strictly speaking it is an artifact of the modern functional approach. Nevertheless, from a modern mathematical point of view, both approaches are identical, and therefore, the modern formula can still reliably capture the underlying parameters in a non-linear least squares fit. Lewis, yet, did not work with any parameters but with other tables. He captured the geometrical solution to the astronomical problem in such a way that he could use already existing tables for sub-problems. He did not recompute the solar equation, or right ascension, but used the tables that he had in his toolbox of astronomical tables. If we want to understand the mathematical practices of historical actors and groups and the transmission of these practices, we have to focus on their computational scenarios and the corresponding tabular practices. A modern mathematical formula might still be useful to identify parameter-estimates, but may not tell us anything about the details of mathematical practice and their transmissionFootnote 151.\n\nTo further elucidate the latter statement, we have implemented Lewis’s algorithm in a computer algebra system.Footnote 152 Our implementation is based on looking up values in other sub-tables and computation in sexagesimal arithmetic. Note, that Lewis is basically presenting his entire algorithm in his computational table, but there are a few subtle facts, related to intermediate rounding and precision that are not readily inferred from his table and can only be revealed upon proper recomputation and basic statistics. In turns out that Lewis employed standard rounding for sexagesimal numbers and computed to seconds, subsequently rounded to minutes for his equation of time in degrees.Footnote 153 Furthermore, for the recomputation we need to provide specific tables for the solar equation and right ascension. Thanks to the modern parameter-estimate, we know that the table of the solar equation employed by Lewis originates from the Parisian Alfonsine Tables and the table for right ascensions is based on al-Battānī’s value for the obliquity. Nevertheless, we need to specify certain readings for these tables, preferably from the intellectual surroundings of Lewis or from manuscripts he owned or had access to.\n\nFrom the organization and layout of the computational intermediate table we can easily reconstruct the solar equation used by Lewis by simply subtracting or adding the mean motion from the true position of the Sun. Since the computational table covers the whole circle of 360°, we can reconstruct the entire solar equation used by Lewis twice, independently of each other. The result of this double-reconstruction is very stable: between the two tables of the solar equation reconstructed from addition and subtraction, respectively, there are only three differences for the 180 values in total:\n\n1.\n\nIn the table that results from addition, the solar equation for 22° longitude wrongly reads 0;46,56° instead of the correct value 0;46,55°. Most likely this is a copying error of mistaking 6 for 5.\n\n2.\n\nIn the table that results from subtraction, the solar equation for 126° longitude wrongly reads 1;47,45° instead of the more common value 1;47,46°. Most likely this is a copying error of mistaking 5 for 6.\n\n3.\n\nIn the table that results from addition, the solar equation for 143° longitude wrongly reads 1;19,20° instead of the correct value 1;20,40°. Most likely this is a scribal error.\n\nWe explicate these details here, to highlight that Lewis most likely did not make a single computational error in adding or subtracting the solar equation from the mean Sun.Footnote 154 The three differences in the table are rather copying and scribal errors. Nevertheless, we do not intend to use the reconstructed table for our recomputation, but will only work with variant readings of the Alfonsine solar equation found in other, extant manuscripts in order to test dependencies on variant readings of tables—a circumstance to which modern recomputation is entirely blind.\n\nWhat we will use instead, as a guiding principle, is the layout in which Lewis presents his solar equation in his intermediate table. From the second column for the argument, we readily infer that the table for the solar equation that he is using is organized in signs of 30° consecutively numbered from 0, 1, …, 11 with individual degrees from 0, 1, 2, …, 29. This layout is the same as employed by John of Lignères and found in his Tables of 1322 and his Tabule Magne.Footnote 155 The same layout of the table is found in the manuscript Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College MS 110/179, p. 16, containing the Tabule Magne, which was owned by Roger Marchal (d. 1477), who, like Lewis, was also a fifteenth century Cambridge physician.Footnote 156 Therefore, we have included the solar equation table from the manuscript formerly owned by Marchal in our analysis, because both men might have acquired manuscript copies of the same sources during their education or professional career.Footnote 157\n\nConcerning the table of right ascension based on al-Battānī’s value for the obliquity, used by Lewis for his computation, we can only infer that he used a table of normed right ascension. This is immediately clear from any of the entries from his fourth column, which are all off by about 90° from the true Sun (cf. Figure 3).\n\nWith respect to these boundary conditions, we have compiled a selection of variant readings for the tables of the Alfonsine solar equation and for al-Battānī’s normed right ascension that circulated in Lewis’s intellectual surroundings and which we used in our implementation of his algorithm. The result is summarized in Table 3.\n\nA few comments are in order. Across the variant readings of the Alfonsine solar equation that we used in Lewis’s algorithm the fitting results are almost stable and the number of values exactly reproduced in comparison to Lewis’s table for the equation of time is almost constant (rows in Table 3). The six individual variant tables for the Alfonsine solar equation, though, without reproducing them here, contain between 5 and 16 scribal errors when compared among themselves. Since the solar equation is used twice to cover the full circle of 360°, on which the equation of time is build, twice the number of these scribal errors, i.e., between 10 and 32, enter the algorithm. These scribal variants are not visible in the final result, because they are of the order of seconds. The equation of time, however, originates from a difference in right ascension of the true Sun that is obtained from a table of right ascension given in degrees and minutes only. Therefore, scribal variants of the Alfonsine solar equation are almost invisible in the final result for the equation of time. The final result of the algorithm predominantly depends on variant readings of al-Battānī’s table of right ascension.\n\nThe six variant readings of al-Battānī’s table of right ascension that we used differ up to 10% in their 360 values in total but the consequences for the table of the equation of time are drastic (columns in Table 3). Clearly, when using the tables of right ascension in H (fol. 163r) and E2 (fol. 33r) we can almost reproduce all the values of Lewis’s table exactly. While the remaining four variant readings of the table of right ascension reproduce almost none of Lewis’s results. Since all the six tables of right ascension we used are unmistakably identified as al-Battānī’s table this phenomenon needs further clarification. The explanation is simply that there are two stable variant readings of al-Battānī’s table of right ascension that were transmitted and disseminated independently of each other. These two variants differ by a line-slip that results in a shift of an entire block of 12 values from Aquarius 16°–27° and, coherently by symmetry, from Leo 16°–27°.Footnote 158 Right ascension, however, has a symmetry to the equinoxes and solstices and, therefore, the block-shift, when comparing both variants, should appear four times and not only twice. We thus conclude that the variant witnessed in A (fols. 74v–75r), E1 (fols. 142v–143v), E2 (fol. 118v), and E2 (fols. 148v–149r) mostly likely originates from an early scribal error that later underwent an attempted fix by symmetry, yet only half of the symmetry relations, i.e., ignoring the anti-symmetry around the solstices, were employed. We denote this variant as variant B. The variant witnessed in H (fol. 163r) and E2 (fol. 33r), which we denote as variant A, is the proper one and also found in most manuscript witnesses of the Toledan Tables.Footnote 159 Nevertheless, both variants A and B appear to be transmitted stably and are found in several manuscripts across Europe. We illustrate this block-shift in Aquarius in Table 4, where we transcribe an excerpt from two representative witnesses for variants A and B.\n\nTo conclude our discussion on the dependence of the table of the equation of time on the two variants A and B of al-Battānī’s table for right ascension, we note that the radix of Lewis’s algorithm, i.e., the beginning of the addition on which the whole table rests, occurs when the true Sun is between Aquarius 21°–22° (Aquarius 20° of mean solar longitude in Fig. 3). This radix is right in the middle of the shifted block of variant B of al-Battānī’s table for right ascension and thus off by about 1 min (see Table 4). Because all subsequent values are compared to this radix, the entire resulting table for the equation of time is shifted by 1 min in time-degrees, or 4 s in hours of time, and almost none of the final values are exactly reproduced compared to Lewis.\n\nThe best fit result is achieved when we use the Alfonsine solar equation found in E2, fol. 115r, and al-Battānī’s table for normed right ascension from H, fol. 163r. It appears very likely that Lewis had direct access to these two manuscripts. H was formerly owned by Simon Bredon and contains a table of contents in his hand. As we argued above, from statistical analysis we may not discriminate between different readings of the Alfonsine solar equation. Nevertheless, the layout of the table for the solar equation in E2, fol. 115r is almost identical to the structure found in Lewis’s intermediate table. The signs are numbered from 0, 1, …, 11 and, thus, contain 30° each. However, the degrees per sign are consecutively numbered from 1, …, 30 and not from 0, 1, …, 29 as is the case for the intermediate table. In addition, we argue that Lewis very likely had direct access to the manuscript E2. We, therefore, conclude that Lewis likely consulted these two manuscripts when he derived his table of the equation of time. However, another hypothesis is that he could have copied and owned a set of tables that derive from these two manuscripts and, thus, originate from the intellectual surrounding of Simon Bredon. The residuals for the best fit result, where we subtracted our historical recomputation from Lewis’s final table in minutes and seconds of time is given in Fig. 4. Out of 360 values in total we reproduced 334 exactly. Three values are off by − 2 s. These values were computed with higher precision by Lewis and he performed the final linear interpolation to seconds. We did not treat these three cases separately, but could simply have increased precision in our algorithm for the last linear interpolation. Eventually, 23 values are off by ± 4 s, which represents the minimal possible deviation. Most likely these deviations result from slightly different linear interpolations by Lewis or from another few random scribal errors in the table of right ascension used by Lewis. In summary our historical implementation reproduced about 94% values exactly.\n\nAppendix A. Lewis Caerleon’s canons for the equation of time\n\nThe following text is based on the only witness, BLa, displaying the Lewis Caerleon’s canons for the equation of time.

Sed hoc ad presens sufficiat.\n\nTranslation\n\nNew work\n\nFor the common table of the equation of time that Azarchel composed, is now in error due to the time elapsed and the long displacement of the solar apogee. Therefore, I decided to compose a new table.\n\nAbout that it must be noted that the equation of time is the difference between the mean days or equal days and the apparent days or unequal days. Indeed, the average, or mean or equal day always and precisely contains 24 equal hours, as all the astronomers assume in their computations. And that [mean] day supposes that both the solar motion and the right ascension are always equal, but that is not true.\n\nThe apparent or unequal day is truly the time of complete revolution which the Sun in motion travelled through. This day, of course, is different and unequal for two reasons, because of the inequality of the solar motion [solar equation], and because of the inequality of the ascension of the true motion [right ascension].\n\nIn truth, the difference originating from both causes of the inequality of the Sun, between the mean day and the apparent day is called the equation of time, although it may be small in one day and then increases up to eight degrees and more.\n\nAnd as Ptolemy says, the maximum difference from both causes of inequality is eight degrees and a third of degree.Footnote 166 For as he says, the greatest difference from the inequality of the solar motion [solar anomaly] is simply three degrees and two thirds of one degree, and the greatest difference from the inequality of the ascension [variation at the time of meridian-crossing] is said of four degrees and two thirds.\n\nHowever, we, the moderns, find the maximum difference simply from the inequality of the solar motion resulting in four degrees and one third, which is clear if the true solar motion from the beginning of Aries until the beginning of Libra is subtracted from the mean motion of the Sun for the same time.\n\nAnd we find the maximum difference from the inequality of the right ascension simply resulting in five degrees, as it appears if the right ascensions, that are from 16 Aquarius to 16 Taurus, are subtracted. For 85 degrees will then certainly remain in these signs, it is the beginning and the end of the subtraction of the right ascensions. From this follows that the entire possible difference from the two causes of inequality can also be nine degrees and one third.\n\nHowever, it is not necessary, nor is it true, that all the smallest apparent days are so much exceeded by so many mean days, that is to say, by the addition of the maximum differences of both causes. For the maximum difference from the other cause is not in the same place as the maximum difference from the other one [other cause], nor do the subtractions or additions of one cause and the other begin from the same point.\n\nOn the contrary, the other cause starts to decrease before the other reaches its maximum augmentation due to the motion of the apogee. In addition, therefore, it is not always found that the maximum equation of time or the difference from both causes is simultaneously one and the same and equal because of the variation of the solar apogee, as it appears in the tables. For Azarchel, in his time, found the maximum difference from both causes at the same time 7 degrees and 54 min, Albategni, however, 7 degrees and 57 min and myself, in my time, assuming that the solar apogee was in the first degree of Cancer, I found the maximum difference from both causes at the same time: 8 degrees, 12 min and 30 s, operating as close as possible to Ptolemy’s position.\n\nThis table of a different kind was composed as it appears in Ptolemy, Albategni and Bredon, in his 2nd book on the Almagest, who transmits there the same complete doctrine.\n\nI truly present a gentle method with which one can very precisely make a table of the equation of time, as I have made myself in such manner as it could be perpetual, yet operating with it for 100 or 200 years, the error will be insensible.\n\nFor this, note that the average or mean days implies that both the solar motion and the right ascensions are always equals, which is not true, but the apparent day supposes on the contrary that it is true.\n\nThus, you will find precisely the difference between the mean day and the apparent day arising from both causes at the same time. Assume the Sun to be in its mean motion at 18 degrees Aquarius, because from the beginning of that degree point according to its true motion, the apparent day begins to be smaller than the mean day due to the inequality of ascension, as it appears in the table of right ascensions.\n\nAnd from this degree, write one after the other, degree per degree the mean motion of the Sun until a complete revolution. Assume also that the solar apogee is in some determined complete degree, then subtract it from the mean motion and the result will be the argument of the Sun, [solar anomaly] that you also write in front of the mean motion until the complete revolution.\n\nThen, with the argument of the Sun [solar anomaly] now found, enter in the table of the equation of the Sun and compute the solar motion up to the complete revolution, and also write the true solar motion in the third position in front of the mean motion up to the complete revolution.\n\nThen, subtract the true solar motion first found from the true solar motion secondly found and equated, there will remain the arc of the true solar motion passing through one degree of the mean motion of this arc of true motion. Seek the right ascension of the sign and degree of the true solar motion, that if there is one precise degree there will be an equal amount of apparent and mean days, and therefore, the beginning of the addition will be there, and therefore, the numbers will be placed in front of that degree of Aquarius of the true motion.\n\nIf this ascension was greater than a degree, the ascension of the true solar motion corresponding to the crossing of the subsequent degree of the mean motion must be sought. Do not cease and you will arrive to the ascension of the arc of the true motion that contains precisely one degree, thus in the same time, as the beginning of the addition will start there.\n\nTherefore, having found that degree, the true solar motion corresponding to the crossing of those two degrees in conjunction of this degree, that is, the subsequent degree and that true motion in ascension from the two degrees is sought. The subtracted difference is placed in front of the subsequent degree.\n\nThen, from the true solar motion corresponding to the crossing of three degrees altogether, that means, with the two preceding degrees, and the third subsequent one, its ascension is subtracted from the three degrees of the mean motion. The difference is placed against the third subsequent degree, and with this method, proceed further until the completion of the whole circle.\n\nOnce completed, as you know the exact equation of time corresponding to each complete degrees of the true motion, take the table of proportion (table of interpolation), that means, the general manner which you add or subtract according to the necessity of the position, and write the product in the table in front of the perfect [integer] degree of the true solar motion. For one always enters in the table of the equation of time with the degree of the true solar motion, and thus the complete composition of the aforementioned table is clear.\n\nTherefore, if the radix of the motions were at the beginning of the addition in the table, that is, the true mean days begin to be greater than the apparent days, that is, in the aforesaid degree of Aquarius, so the difference found must be added continuously, so that the apparent days are given from the mean days.\n\nNevertheless, if the radices are placed at the beginning of the subtraction, then any difference found is in the table of mean days.\n\nAnd note that this table covers every region and every horizon, if the day begins at midday or at midnight. But, if the day were to begin at sunrise or sunset, or from whatever hour, then a proper table of the equation of time is needed for each horizon, and this happens because of the variation of the inequality of the oblique ascension in all the different horizons. In addition, for this reason, all astronomers begin the day at midday for the right ascension is equal in every latitude and horizon.\n\nHowever, if you want to have a more substantial treatise on this matter, see Ptolemy, Albategni, Gebir and Bredon. But, Bredon at the end of his second book on the Almagest covers the opinions of all of them, and there he placed my method, here presented in virtue, although not so clearly, and here, he transmits a complete and perfect doctrine of the equation of time. But this is enough for now.\n\nAppendix B. Simon Bredon, Commentum super Almagesti, Book III. 22–24\n\nManuscripts used for the edition (sigla):\n\nD1 Oxford, Bodleian Library, Digby 168, fols. 37v-39r\n\nD2 Oxford, Bodleian Library, Digby 178, fols. 83v-86r7\n\nEdition principles\n\nThe edition of Simon Bredon’s commentary of Book III. 22–24 of the Almagest is based on the two only extant manuscripts, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Digby 168 (D1) and Oxford, Bodleian Library, Digby 178 (D2). The following text is mainly based on D2 (Lewis Caerleon’s copy) which contains a few variants compared to Simon Bredon’s autograph copy, D1. D2 is indeed likely to belong to the same tradition as D1, from which it was most likely copied directly, or from a direct copy of D1.\n\nFor the edition, we generally follow D2, except in a few cases where the latter omits a word or preposition otherwise included in D1. Therefore, we include variants found in D1 in the critical apparatus, and in some cases, D2 variants are also listed in notes.\n\nWe have incorporated in only one case, at the end of III.23, an entire passage from D1, originally written by Simon Bredon and then deleted by him, which Lewis Caerleon did not include in his copy, D2. We have included it in the main text as it presents an interesting attempt by Simon Bredon to compose a perpetual table for the equation of time, an idea which he eventually abandoned in order to finally provide the rule for making a ‘non-perpetual' table for the equation of time in III.24.\n\nFolio numbers in the main text correspond to D2. We specify the change in folio numbers in D1 within the apparatus.\n\nWe report marginalia, interlinear glosses, deletions, and corrections systematically. Additionally, D2 includes a couple of marginal glosses written by Lewis Caerleon to comment on Simon Bredon’s text. Some words are also superscripted by Lewis to correct an omission in D2, as specified in the apparatus. D1 was Simon Bredon's working copy, with many passages added and then crossed out for deletion, while entire paragraphs were included in the margin with the help of signes-de-renvoi. The passages copied in the margins by Simon Bredon in D1 are systematically included in D2. Therefore, we specify in the apparatus whenever those passages are situated in the margin in D1. Similarly, we have decided to mention in the apparatus every passage crossed out by Simon Bredon.\n\nA certain number of spelling variants may be found in the two copies. We have decided to mention most of them in the apparatus. Punctuation is ours. However, the reader should be aware that we normalised some spellings and standardised some others.\n\nThe spelling variants we normalised are the following:\n\nin D1 Ptolemy is spelled Tholomeus, we retained Ptholomeus as in D2.\n\n‘-ci’ in ‘-ti’ for tercium/tertium and distancia/distantia\n\nWe include a ‘y’ when more common in modern spelling for Egyptorum instead of Egiptorum.\n\nWe retained the absence of diphthong in both manuscripts, e.g. equatio and not aequatio.\n\nWe kept the spelling found in both manuscripts of coniunctio instead of conjunctio.\n\nThe numerical readings in the manuscript were closely followed, and Arabic numerals were used when provided. Discrepancies occurred when a witness included an Arabic numeral while the other provided a complete word, e.g.,: ‘duorum’ and ‘2orum’. In that case, the reading in D1 was chosen, and the D2 variants were added to the apparatus.\n\nAbbreviations in the apparatus\n\n[fol. 83v]Footnote 167\n\n22. Locum quo incipit inequalitas dierum ex inequalitate ascensionum in circulo obliquo resultans, nec non et maximam differentiam inter dies differentes et medios in orizonte dato collectam scrutari. Unde in transitu medietatis orbis signorum per Arietem erunt dies medii diebus differentibus longiores per aliquid et in transitu alterius medietatis per Libram erunt ergo dies medii breviores differentibus per tantundem.\n\nAccidit autem variatio loci qui queretur secundum quod climata variantur.Footnote 168 Est tamen in omni climate inter punctum inceptionis in circulo directo in prima quarta zodiaci et tropicum estivalem vel in puncto sibi opposito post tropicum yemalem, habentis ergo tabulis ascensionum pro orizonte dato inquiratur, ante tropicum estivalem, ubi invenitur in tabulis dies medius equalis diei differenti et erit ibidem, vel in puncto sibi opposito,Footnote 169 indifferenter inceptio,Footnote 170 inequalitatisFootnote 171 dierum ex proposita causa in orizonte dato resultans. Et in puncto inceptioni opposito erit finis Capitis ergo in dictis tabulis ascensionibus medietatis zodiaci inter puncta sicutFootnote 172 habita intercepta,Footnote 173 quantum ille ascensiones differentFootnote 174 a medietate circuli 0 a 180 gradibus,Footnote 175 tantum different dies medii illius medietatis a differentibus diebus eiusdem, quod si indirecta medietate fueritFootnote 176 signum Arietis, erunt per dictam differentiam dies medii diebus differentibus longiores et in medietate alia econversoFootnote 177 eo quod [fol. 84r] in medietate zodiaci in qua est signum Arietis subtrahuntur differentie ascensionum in circulo obliquoFootnote 178 ab ascensionibus in circulo directo,Footnote 179 et in alia medietate adduntur, ut patet in 20a coniunctioneFootnote 180 secundi huius. Et ex hoc sequitur quod dies differentes medietatis zodiaci in qua est signum Libre exceduntur coniunctim dies differentes alterius medietatis per duplum differentie antedicte eo quod quantum dies differentes addunt super dies mediocres ex parte Libre tam ex parte Arietis minuuntur ab iisdem. Et est notandum quod hecFootnote 181 differentia sic inventa in orizonte dato excedit differentiam maximi diei illius orizontis supra diemFootnote 182 equinoctialem que quidem differentiam, scilicetFootnote 183 maximi diei ad equinoctialem est excessus quo ascensio medietatis zodiaci a Cancro in Capricornum excedit .180. gradus.Footnote 184\n\n23. Cuiuscumque diei differentis ad diem mediumFootnote 185 differentiam ex alterutra dictarum causarum vel ex ambabus simul causatam inquirere, necnon et locum quo inceptio additionis seu diminutionis ex ambabus simul causis contigerit assignare.\n\nUt si differentiam inter quemcumque diem differentem et medium ex inequalitate motus Solis causatam habere volueris invenias per 18am huius veros motus Solis tam pro primo oppositi illius diei quam pro ultimoFootnote 186 de quo queris. Deinde subtracto minore de maiore capiatur differentia que a die medioFootnote 187 subtrahenda est si sit minor vel subtrahendus est arcus diei medii ab ea si sit maior et reliquetur differentiam quam inquiris. Quod si differentiam ex inequalitate ascensionis causatam habere volueris, invento per 18am huius medio motu Solis et veroFootnote 188 pro principio et pro fine diei de quo queris et minori de maiore subtracto. Arcus residui inveniatur ascensio in spera recta per ultimam primi huiusFootnote 189 si in linea meridionali dies inceperisFootnote 190 vel inquiritur illius arcus ascensio in spera obliqua per 19am secundi huius. Si ab oriente inceperis dies tuos, qua subtracta ab arcu diei mediocris si sit minor vel arcu diei medii subtracto ab ea si sit maior, resultabit differentiam de qua queris. Et est notandum quod in equationibus dierum, melius est operari cum diebus incipientibus a linea meridionali quam ab orizonte, cuius causam ponit Ptholomeus, eo quod diversitates que accidunt in diebus incipientibus ab orizonte, scilicet orizonta diversa, diversimode variantur. Sed diversitates que accidunt in diebus incoatis a linea meridionali in orizontibus singulis manent eedem. Si autem differentiam ex causis ambabus simul pervenientem habere volueris utriusque cause differentiam respectu diei de qua queris per doctrinam protractam inquire, et per tres coniunctiones premissas considera an utraque causam differentiam suam addat supra diem mediocrem vel utraque differentiam suam minuat aut addat [fol. 84v] altera reliqua minuente. Si autem ambe cause addant simul vel minuant. Differentie ambe diei de quo queris simul addantur et si una causa addat, et alia minuat, subtrahatur minor differentia de maiori, et resultabit differentia ex ambabus causis causata. Si vero quantum una differentia addit tam precise alia minuit, tunc ibi equalis erit dies differens diei mediocri.Footnote 191\n\nSi igitur in die sequenti addat utraque causa, vel altera plus addat quam reliqua minuat. Tunc ibi erit initium additionis. Si vero in die sequenti utraque causa minuat seu altera plus minuat quam reliqua addat. Tunc erit ibi principium diminutionis. Est tamen notandum quod licet iste sit unus modus inveniendi differentiam ex ambabus causis resultantem et modus etiam inveniendi principium additionis vel diminutionis. Non tamen est modus in toto precisus tum propter hoc quod ex isto modo operandi sequitur quod cuicumque differentie resultanti ex inequali motu Solis in ecentrico, correspondeat ascensio sibi equalis quod non est verum. Tum etiam propter hoc quodFootnote 192 arcus zodiaciFootnote 193 correspondens medio motui Solis pro principio dieiFootnote 194 cuiuslibet in qua Sol necFootnote 195 est in auge nec in eius opposito alibi incipitFootnote 196 quam incipiat arcus zodiaci qui motui Solis vere pro eiusdem diei principio correspondet. Et per coniunctionis primo arcui correspondet alia ascensio quam secundo cum iste modus operandi precedit, ac si ascensiones illorum arcuum essent eedem.Footnote 197 Ut igitur precise inveniatur differentiam ex ambabus causis simul resultans capiatur verus locus Solis per 18am huius tam pro principio diei de quo queris, quam pro fine eiusdem. Et arcus inter illa duo loca intercepti inveniatur ascensio que quidem ascensio est quantitas diei differentis, illa igitur si sit minor die medio subtrahatur ab eo, et si sit maior, subtrahatur ab ea dies medius et habebitur differentia quam inquiris. Si veroFootnote 198 fuerit equalis diei medio, tunc si dies differens qui proximo sequitur fuerit maior die medio ibi erit principium additionis et si fuerit minor ibi erit principium diminutionis, patet igitur tota coniunctio.\n\nEt est notandum quod non oportet nec est verum omnes dies differentes maiores excedere tot dies medios per aggregatum ex maximis differentis causarum ambarum, vel omnes dies differentes minores per tantum excedi a tot diebus mediis, quia non in eodem loco quo est maxima differentia ex altera causa, est maxima differentia ex reliqua nec ab eodem puncto incipiunt additiones vel diminutiones unius cause et alterius. Immo altera causa incipit minuere antequam reliqua ad maximam sue augmentationis deveneritFootnote 199 et ideo ponit PtholomeusFootnote 200 quod ubi est maxima additioFootnote 201[fol. 85r] similiter vel maxima diminutio in diebus a meridie incoatis ibi differentia ex inequalitate motus Solis causata est 3 gradus et due tertie unius gradus et differentia ex inequalitate ascensionum proveniens que ibidem est maxima. Est ut ipse dicit 4 gradus et due tertie fere quia est 4 gradus et 44 minuta secundum tabulas suas. Aggregatum igitur ex illis duobus differentiis est 8 gradus et tertia pars unius gradus, per quod omnesFootnote 202 maximi dies differentes secundum enim superant tot dies mediocres cui quidem aggregato, dimidium hore et pars eius 18a correspondet, propter hoc quod in una hora gradus 15 oriuntur hec autem quantitas temporisFootnote 203 cum dimissa fuerit in Sole et in stellis aliis non eveniet, ut dicit PtholomeusFootnote 204 propter eius dimissionem quantitas sensibilis in inquisitione eorum in aliquo eorum que videntur. In Luna autem, propter velocitatem sui cursus, erit diversitas manifesta sensibilis eo quod quandoque in tanto tempore pretransit fere tertiam partem gradus. Est autemFootnote 205 unum aliud diligenter notandumFootnote 206 quod omnes dies differentes maiores simul sumpti non semper per equalem excessumFootnote 207 excedent tot dies medios nec semper in eodem puncto erit initium additionis sive initium diminutionis, neque semper eidem loco Solis sive in eccentrico sumaturFootnote 208 sive in zodiaco correspondet in diversis annis dies differentes equales. Sed per diuturnum processum temporis accidet variatio in singulis predictorum, cum eum per motum octave spere varietur distantia inter punctum equinoctii et longitudinem quamcumque eccentrici at differentiam diei differentis ad medium ex inequalitate motus Solis causata respectum habet ad distantiam Solis a longitudine media et in variatione eam consequitur, differentia vero ex inequalitate ascensionum proveniens habet respectum ad Solis distantiam a puncto equinoctii. Ideo oportet ut ex variatione distantie inter longitudinem mediam et punctum equinoctii, contingat variatio in predictis. Et ideo tabula AlbategniFootnote 209 facta pro equatione dierum non potest esse perpetua, immo per lapsum temporis erit falsa.Footnote 210\n\n< [D1, fols. 38r–v] Docebo tamen tabulam unam componere, que una cum tabula ascensionum in circulo directo, pro diebus equandis deserviet in eternam.Footnote 211 Extendatur enim linea numeri usque ad 360 gradus per singulas unitates et erit primus gradus linee numeri gradus in mediate subsequens gradum illum in quo est longitudo media illa scilicet a qua recedit Sol ab opposito augis et accedit ad augem. Et ideo ut prompte sciatur quantum distinctum ille primus gradus linee numeri ab augis opposito, ponantur < numerus > illiusFootnote 212 in capite tabule supra unitatem in linea numeri, vel in directo unitatis ex parte sinistra, ut verbi gratia. Arcus maxime equationis Solis secundum Tholomeum est 2 gradus 23 minuta ut patent in 12 huius ideo illo subtracto a 90 gradibus, remanent 87 gradus 37 minuta, que est distantia longitudinis medie ab opposito augis Solis. Et quia in illa distantia Solis non variatur in subsequentis equatio Solis ab sinus equatione in distantia gradus in linea numeri ex parte sinistra vel supra capud eius subtrantur 88 gradus denotantes quod primus gradus linee numeri est 89 gradus ab opposito augis Solis.\n\nDeinde in tabula equationis Solis inquiratur equatio Solis in eius distantia ab opposito augis per 89 gradus. Et si illa equatio sit equalis equationi maxime sed contiget propter permutationem distantie a longitudine media. Ponatur unus gradus in directo unitatis in proxima linea ex parte dextra, quia tantus est motus Solis veris in pertransitione 89 gradus ab opposito augis sumpti, et in eius directo, in linea tertia, ponatur cifra denotans quia nulla est differentia ter medium motum Solis et verum in pertransitione illius gradus.Footnote 213\n\nPostea consimiliter inquiratur equatio Solis in distantia 90 graduum ab opposito augis, et illa subtracta ab equatione maxima, si sit minor ea. Ponatur residuum in tertia linea in directo binarii, illo quia residuo a duobus gradibus subtracto, quod inde remanserit ponatur in subsequente linea in directo binarii, quia ille est motus Solis verus in pertransitione eius a principio 89 gradus usque ad finem gradus 90, ab opposito augis sumptorum.\n\nConsimiliter procedendum est ulterius conversique devitatum fuerit ad augem, quod continget in directo 92 in linea numeri, ibi igitur quia nulla est equatio. Ponatur maxima equatio in tertia linea in directo 92, in linea numeri ibi igitur quia nulla est equatio ponatur maxima equatio in tertia linea in directo 92, illa que subtracta a 92 gradibus, ponatur residuum in subsequente linea in directo eorumdem 92 graduum qui est quantitas veri motus Solis a principio 89 gradus ab opposito augis usque ad augem, et illa maxima equatio posita in tertia linea est differentia per quam medius Solis motus in pertransitione predicta superat motum verum.\n\nDeinde sumptis equationibus ab auge Solis usque ad eius oppositum, singule ad equationem maximam sunt addende. Et ponendum est aggregatum in directo graduum prout continget, qui illud erit differentia inter motum Solis verum et medium in pertransitione eius a predicta longitudine media ad locum illum. Subtracta que illa differentia a tot gradibus in quot graduum directo ponetur. Ponatur residuum in subsequente linea in directo graduum predictorum.\n\nDeinde in processu ab opposito augis ad illam longitudinem mediam a qua fuit inceptio. Operandum est per subtractionem equationum ab equatione maximam scilicet operabatur in processu ab illa longitudine media ad augem. Et sic compositio dicte tabule †contineatur† ut igitur per dictam tabulam operemus, sic Sol gratia exempli in fine alicuius graduum linee numeri predictorum, etFootnote 214 numerus in subsequente linea in directo illius gradus inventus. Additur ad numerum per quem 89us gradusFootnote 215 ab opposito augis distat a puncto equinoctii proximo precedentis illum 89um gradum,Footnote 216 scilicet a primo puncto Arietis vel Libre, et tam totius aggregati quam predicte distantie queratur ascensio in circulo directo subtracta igitur minori ascensione de maior remanebit quantitas temporisFootnote 217 direum differentium in pertransitione Solis a principio 89 gradus ab oppositione augis usque ad locum pro quo operati fuerimus transactorum, per cuius relationem ad tempus dierum mediocrumFootnote 218 in pertransitioneFootnote 219 habebitur differentia inter dies mediocres et dies differentes pertransitionis predicte. >\n\n24. Dies mediocres in dies differentes convertire et econtra.\n\nTam propter principiumFootnote 220 propositi temporis quam propter finem eiusdemFootnote 221 inveniatur uterque motus Solis scilicet verus et medius, et subtracto medio motu Solis pro principio illius temporis a motu eius medio pro fine eiusdem, servetur residuum. Item subtracto vero motu Solis pro principio predicti temporis a vero motu eius pro fine ipsius residui queratur ascensio in circulo directo.\n\nSi a meridiano dies inceperisFootnote 222 vel in [fol. 85v] circulo obliquo si dies ab orizonte incoaverisFootnote 223 et si dicta ascensio minor fuerit motu medio preservato, subtrahatur ab eo deinde resoluta differentia in partes horarum sumendo semper pro uno gradu 4 minuta hore que sunt 15a pars illius patet quod per partes horarumFootnote 224 correspondentes dicte differentie terminabuntur autem finem propositi temporis tot dies differentes quot fuerant in proposito tempore mediocres, et ideo ubi dies differentes suntFootnote 225 per certam differentiam diebus mediis breviores. Addenda est illa differentia ad numerum dierum mediorum denotans quod illi numero dierum mediocrum correspondent tot dies differentes et differentia tanta ulterius. Si vero ascensio predicta maior fuerit motu medio preservato, subtrahatur medius motus ab ea et tempus remanenti differentie correspondens subtrahendum est a numero dierum mediorum propositi temporis, denotans quod diebus mediocribus temporis propositi non correspondent tot dies differentes. Sed numerus per differentiam antedictam.\n\nIste igitur est modus convertendi dies mediocres in dies differentes, quod si volueris econtra convertere, operaberis econverso.\n\nEt est notandum quod per istum modum precisissime fieri patet tabula equationis dierum que licet non poterit esse perpetua, operando tamen cum ea per 100 annos insensibilis erit error.\n\nInquiratur igitur in linea numeri tabule equationis Solis, gradus correspondens 18 gradui Aquarii, eo quod a principio illius gradus incipit: dies differens esse minor die mediocri ex causa inequalitatisFootnote 226 ascensionis, ut probari potest per eamFootnote 227 que dixi in 21 huius, quo graduFootnote 228 invento per equationes principium et finis illius inveniatur arcus veri motus Solis in pertransitione illius gradus, deinde illius arcus veri motus queratur ascensio in circulo directo que si sit unus gradus precise erit, ibidemFootnote 229 quantitas diei differentis equalis quantitati diei mediocris, et ideoFootnote 230 erit ibidem inceptio additionis, et ideo ponatur ibi cifra in directo 18 gradus Aquarii denotans quod nulla differentia erit ibi.Footnote 231 Si vero illa ascensio fuerit maior uno gradu, inquiratur ascensio veri motus Solis correspondentis pertransitioni gradus subsequentis, nec cesses quousque deveneris ad ascensionem que precise continet unum gradum, ut ibidem additionis principium habeatur. Illo igitur gradu invento, inquiratur verus motus Solis correspondens pertransitioni duorumFootnote 232 graduum coniunctioni illius scilicet et gradus subsequentis, et illius veri motus ascensione a duobusFootnote 233 gradibus subtracta. Ponatur differentia in directo gradus subsequentis.\n\nDeinde invento vero motu Solis correspondente pretransitioni trium graduum simul iunctorumFootnote 234 scilicet secundorumFootnote 235 predictorum et tertii subsequentis. Subtrahatur eius ascensio a tribus gradibus et ponatur differentia econtra gradum tertium subsequentem et per istum modum procedas ulterius [fol. 86r] usque ad totius circuli complementum, et sicut patet compositio tabule antedicte. Si igitur radicesFootnote 236 motuum posite fuerit super principium additionis in tabula scilicet ubi dies medii inceperunt esse mariores diebus differentibusFootnote 237 tunc differentiam quelibet ibi inventa. Addenda est continue, ut dies differentes ex diebus mediis habeantur.\n\nSi tamen ponerentur radices super principium diminutionis, tunc esset differentia quelibetFootnote 238 inventa in tabula minuenda.Footnote 239 Et est hic unum diligenter, notandum quod si radices alique, que nec sunt super principium additionis,Footnote 240 nec super principium diminutionis in tabula posite fuerint sine equationem dierum, ut puta per solam additionem ad loca instrumentaliter ad inventa vel per subtractionem ab eisdem secundum correspondentiam temporis mediocris inter instans considerationis instrumentalis et radicis principium intercepti, prout docet PtholomeusFootnote 241 in 18a huius et prout etiam patet per radices positas in directo annorum quorumlibet collectorum. Tunc cum indiguerimus equatione dierum nec poterimus eos equare per hanc tabulam neque per regulam prius tactam, tabula enim non sufficet eo quod illa docet semper addere cum tamen dies differentes aliquando addunt super dies medios et aliquando minuunt ab eisdem. Nec operari poterimus per regulam supradictam, illa enim requirit, ut habeatur noticia initii diei super quem ponuntur radices, ita videlicet ut ponantur radices super verum initium illius diei sive ab orizonte sive a meridie incoeturFootnote 242 vel ut ponantur super instans cuius distantia a vero initio illius diei nullatenus ignoretur. Si igitur per dictam regulam equanti sunt dies pro motibus inquirendis, oportet quod secundum modum predictum radices illorum motuum sunt equate. Et si per dictam tabulam voluerimus operari tunc radices motuumFootnote 243 de quibus agemus, non erunt super veram meridiem diei super quem ponentur. Sed videndum est in dicta tabula equationis dierum quanta equatio temporis correspondeat illi diei super quem ponentur radices, et ulterius videndum est quantus est motus illius planete cuius habenda est radix illi tempori correspondens. Deinde addito tanto motu loco illius planete in meridie dicti diei, resultabit radix motus eiusdem planete cum qua quidem radice operabimus, si pro motu habendo illius planete dies predictam tabulam fuit equandi.\n\nNon igitur in isto opere erunt radices super veram meridiem illius diei super quem ponentur, sed super meridiem mediam. Meridiem scilicet per tantum sequentem meridiem veram per quantum omnes dies medii intercepti inter diem illum et diem a quo sit initium additionis in tabula simul sumpti excedunt omnes dies differentes eiusdem temporis simul sumptos. Unde inventa radice aliqua per hunc modum que scilicet intitulata est super meridiem dicto modo mediam alicuius diei, et non super meridiem eius, veram per solam additionem ad illam radicem vel per solam subtractionem ab ea secundum correspondentiam temporis iuxta doctrinam 18e huius haberi possunt radices ad quoscumque annos collectos, menses et dies, nec non et ad sectas cognitas qualescumque [fol. 86v] ita quod per quamlibet huius radicum inveniri potest locus planete cuius sunt radices ad quodcumque tempus quod equandi fuerit per tabulam antedictam.Footnote 244 Consimiliter coniunctiones et oppositiones radicales computande sunt secundum notam distantiam a meridie media diei super quem ponentur et non secundum distantiam a vera eius meridie. Si pro coniunctionibus vel oppositionibus habendis equandi sunt dies per tabulam hanc pretactam.Footnote 245 Sic igitur sufficient patet modus equandi dies tam per tabulam quam per regulam supradictam. Hic inferit PtholomeusFootnote 246 ea que sequuntur dicens fuit autem locus in quo fuit Solis secundum computationem nostram in principio annorum Nabugodonosor in primo die mensis tantum qui est ex mensibus EgyptorumFootnote 247 in media die per motum eius medium, sicut iam ostendimus ante, scilicet, capitulo 2° et 8° huiusFootnote 248 in 45to minuto prime partis Piscis et per motum suum diversum in tertia parte et octavo minuto Piscis fere.\n\nCum addideris super annos Gerdagird et menses et dies eius 955 annos et tres menses erunt qui provenerint anni Alexandri per quos intrabis in canone ZeumFootnote 249 Alexandrini. Et cum addideris annis Gerdagird et mensibus eius et diebus 1379 annos et tres menses erunt qui provenerunt anni Nabugodonosor qui sicut per quos intrabis in hunc librum.Footnote 250\n\nAppendix C.
