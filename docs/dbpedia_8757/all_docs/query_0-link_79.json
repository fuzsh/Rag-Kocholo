        "text": ":\n\nIII.3\n\n474.3: “wallet…staff:” insignia of pilgrim. (Jaun/Yawn was starting a pilgrimage to Jerusalem at 468.23-469.28.)\n\n474.3: “citron:” a Mediterranean tree\n\n474.4: “stick-pass-on:” the “staff” (.3) as baton in a relay race\n\n474.4-5: “His dream monologue was over, of cause, but his drama parapolylogic had yet to be:” III.3 will in fact be a chapter of many (contending) voices.\n\n474.5: “of cause,…affect:” of course…in fact\n\n474.6: “my dear:” the first of a series of addresses to the reader, after the convention of “Dear reader”\n\n474.7: “his locks of lucan tinge:” Shaun/Jaun/Yawn is, often, the light-haired one.\n\n474.7: “rippling:” because viewed through rippling surface of the body of water into which Yawn sank at the end of the last chapter. See next entry.\n\n474.7: “unfilleted:” the hair is unbound by a loosened fillet – a ribbon or headband. (Untied and underwater, it would naturally be “ripely rippling” (.7).)\n\n474.8: ”lashbetasselled lids:” eyelashes with eyelids\n\n474.9: “ouze of his sidewiseopen mouth:” as in, the mouth of England’s River Ouse: its name derives from Danish os, mouth.\n\n474.9: “sidewiseopen:” expression: side of the mouth\n\n474.9-10: “evenso languishing as the princeliest treble treacle or lichee chewchow purse could buy:” that is, he had sweet-smelling breath and spoke sweet-sounding words. Treacle and lychee nuts are both sweet-tasting; so, coincidentally or not, is (.9) ouzo. See entry for .12, entry for 477.30.\n\n474.11: “semiswoon:” what would be called a hypnagogic state, also called “twilight sleep,” commonly experienced on falling asleep or waking; also, induced by opium. See 475.9-10, 476.20-2 and notes.\n\n474.12: “honeyful swoothead:” honey, sweetheart. Also, even his sweat smells sweet, like honey. (According to some reports, this was literally true of H.G. Wells.)\n\n474.14: “bluntblank pin:” Mont Blanc pen\n\n474.15: “love:” more romantic gush: “love” in the (English) idiomatic sense of a lovable person\n\n474.16-7: “the buzzer brings the light brigade, keeping the home fires burning:” 1. ringing for a servant to tend to the fire. 2. “Keep the Home Fires Burning” was a popular WW I song, supporting British (and later, American) soldiers in the conflict, as “The Charge of the Light Brigade” had celebrated British participation in the Crimean War. (Perhaps pertinent that Joyce, who sat out WW I in Switzerland, considered the Crimean War, and Tennyson’s cheerleading on its behalf, to have been criminally stupid.) Its most popular recording was by John McCormack. Irish men, exempted from conscription, were the recipients of a widespread campaign urging them to sign up anyway. McCormack’s recording, mainly directed at America’s entry in 1917, would also have been pertinent to Ireland. Compare note to .17-8.\n\n474.16: \"buzzer:\" a telegraphic instument used in WW I\n\n474.17: “churring call:” a “churr” (also “chirr”) is the sound made by some birds.\n\n474.17-8: “came at him, from the westborders of the eastmidlands:” Compare the opening lines of “Keep the Home Fires Burning: “They were summoned from the hillside, / They were called in from the glen.”\n\n474.19: “crowner:” Ulster, because of its loyalty to the crown\n\n474.19: “cardinal parts:” the four cardinal points of the compass. Also, your annotator suggests that, among (many) other things, III.3 enacts a conclave of cardinals, burying the former pope and selecting his successor. See 475.24-5, 475.30, 497.7-8, 497.10, 499.14-5, and 504.19, with notes.\n\n474.21: “first quaint skreek of the gloaming:” incipient dawn: first light. (A likely time for (see note to .17) bird calls.) “Quaint:” faint. Daylight will be arriving in III.4, and IV will be in the full light of dawn.\n\n474.22-4: “up the mountainy molehill, traversing climes of old times gone by:” either/both 1. layers of sedimentary deposits, recording different geologic eras (and their respective “climes”) as one climbs from one level to another, 2. or the same essential thing, only in layers of turf. (See 475.24 and note.) Also, their climbing follows the paths of previous climbers.\n\n475.1: “sweat of night:” night sweat\n\n475.1-2: “Feefee! phopho!! foorchtha!!! aggala!!!! jeeshee!!!!! paloola!!!!!! ooridiminy!!!!!!!:” as McHugh notes, words for fear: a night-sweat nightmare has included “Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum” man-eating giant\n\n475.3-4: “crossroads puzzlers:” suicides and other nondesirables were buried at crossroads.\n\n475.3-4: “crossroads…nonplussing:” a plus sign is a (+) cross sign. The four inquisitors occupy the four extremities of his “length by breadth” (.4).\n\n475.4-5: “length by breadth nonplussing his thickness, ells upon ells of him, making so many square yards:” that is, right now Yawn being measured in two dimensions, not three: “nonplussing” means something like “not including.” This will have changed by 476.32, when he is in “his cubical crib,” perhaps because in the interim they have begun to examine him in, so to speak, depth: see, e.g., .24 and note.\n\n475.7-17: “There…belt:” glimmering, wavering reflections in water mix with descriptions of sunken Yawn. See .19-20 and note.\n\n475.9: “one foule stretch:” one fell swoop. As McHugh notes, foule is French for crowd – Yawn will turn out to contain multitudes.\n\n475.9-10: “the flowers of narcosis fourfettering his footlights:” poppies at his feet, numbing them and making them useless for walking. See 476.20-2 and note.\n\n475.11: “epicures waltzing with gardenfillers:” based on Google Books occurrences, garden-fillers are plants or flowers which can be reliably expected to fill in all of any space where their seeds are sown. Here, paired with “epicures” - other, pickier growths, requiring more careful cultivation: see next entry.\n\n475.11-2: “puritan shoots:” parting shots; also “shoots” of plants\n\n475.12: “Phopho!:” perhaps Venus as Phosphor, harbinger of the dawn\n\n475.12-6: “Phopho!!...Aggala!!!!...Paloola!!!!!!...Ooridiminy!!!!!!!:” as Yawn’s anatomy: head, guts, circulatory system, and nervous system, respectively. The head is a “rainbowl” (107.12), the entrails are centered at the “bellyvoid,” the blood flows through “veins,” and the nerves are (“electrolatiginous”) electric. There is a certain amount of interchange between the systems. Note that the four words, with the same number of exclamation marks intact, are a selection from the seven words of .1-2. Four is this chapter’s number.\n\n475.12-7: “Phopho!!...belt:” as McHugh notes, the fixtures listed here are celestial. (E. L. Epstein observes that the “electrolatiginous twisted entrails belt” (.16-7) is the Milky Way.) As proposed in the note below to .19-20, I think that, looking down into the stream, they are seeing a (distorted) reflection of the night sky above their heads. That is why it is a “starchamber quiry” (.18-9).\n\n475.13: “seamless rainbowpeel:” Jesus wore a seamless garment, here perhaps combined with Joseph’s coat of many colors.\n\n475.14: “neverstop navel:” compare “Oxen of the Sun:” a “successive anastomosis of navelcords.”\n\n475.15: “creamtocustard cometshair:” Latin coma, hair; comets are so named because their tails flair out like windborne hair. Again (see 475.7), his hair is unbound and whitish-to-yellowish.\n\n475.18: “claymen:” includes French clé, key, pronounced “clay;” compare 478.21. (Digression: probably figures as well in the title of “Clay,” in Dubliners.)\n\n475.19: “quiry:” “quire:” OED: “A set of four sheets of parchment or paper folded in two so as to form eight leaves.” (Occurs in this sense in “Ithaca.”) One of many variations on the four-ness (or, with their legs, eight-ness) of the inquisitors\n\n475.19-20: “For he was ever their quarrel, the way they would see themselves:” because they are looking down into the water and the water surface, seeing reflections of themselves and the night sky above them, mixing with the sight of the submerged Yawn. To repeat my comment on 426.22-24: this, I think, owes a lot to a passage in chapter four of Wordsworth’s The Prelude, especially these lines, in which the poet compares his introspectively autobiographical self to someone looking down from the side of a boat, who\n\n…often is perplexed, and cannot part\n\nThe shadow from the substance, rocks and sky,\n\nMountains and clouds, reflected in the depth\n\nOf the clear flood, from things which there abide\n\nIn their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam\n\nOf his own image, by a sunbeam now,\n\nAnd wavering motions sent he knows not whence…\n\n475.20-1: “everybug his bodiment atop of annywom her notion:” “Bog” is Gaelic for penis, here paired with the “wom”b of “wom”an. Perhaps adumbrates an incubus, embodying her dreaming notion of sex\n\n475.22-3: “Mallinger parish…the son’s rest:” Mullingar Parish is to the west of Dublin/Chapelizod – that is, in the direction of the setting sun. The “knoll Asnoch” (476.5), Uisneach, ten miles southwest of the town of Mullingar, is traditionally the center of Ireland. Venerable sun/son pun is probably in play as well: Shaun/Yawn is HCE’s son, at rest.\n\n475.24: “deep timefield:” deep time: phrase coined in the 18th century for geologic time, measured in millions/billions of years\n\n475.27-8: “his Recordership, Dr. Shunadure Tarpey:” a Recorder, like Sir Frederick Falconer in Ulysses, is or was, in the words of Gifford and Seidman’s Ulysses Annotated, “the chief judicial officer of Dublin.” Luke Tarpey is from Dublin. As “Shunadure,” he is also one of the senescent “senators four” (474.21).\n\n475.28: “caperchasing after honourable sleep:” as McHugh notes, goats (Latin caprae) and sheep – separating the sheep from the goats. Also, perhaps, counting sheep, to get to sleep; Google Books comes up with about a dozen instances of the phrase “honourable sleep”/”honorable sleep” in Joyce’s time, meaning something like “the sleep of the just.”\n\n475.34: “by four lengths:” language of horse race. For instance, one horse leads another by four lengths - except that in this case the ass, always the last to show up, is lagging behind by that distance. Yet another (there will be many others) four\n\n475.35: “like the kapr in the kabisses:” as McHugh notes, a goat among the cabbages. Proverbially, not a good thing: the goat will definitely eat them. A popular puzzle of the time adds a wolf to the mix and requires a rower to get all three across a stream safely: left to themselves, the wolf would automatically eat the goat, the goat the cabbages.\n\n475.36-476.1: “the bugle dianablowing.” Diana’s horn: as a huntress, Diana is sometimes represented with a hunting horn. The phrase can also refer to the moon in crescent.\n\n476.1-2: “the mockingbird whose word is misfortune:” mockingbirds imitate birdsongs of other birds – here of the cuckoo, signaling cuckoldry: “Cuckoo! Cuckoo! O word of fear to husband’s ear!” (Partially quoted in “Scylla and Charbydis”)\n\n476.2: “down the wind:” these sounds (see previous note) are heard downwind.\n\n476.3-4: “The proto was traipsing…Mathew Walker:” “traipsing” as a languid kind of walking, hence Matthew as “Walker.” As prefix, “proto” means first or forward, and, in order and authority, Matthew usually leads the four. “Proto” may also echo Protestant – Matthew is from Ulster. (In FW as elsewhere, the name can be spelled with either one or two t’s, although usually the latter.)\n\n476.3-4: “Mathew Walker, godson’s goddestfar:” this and some of the rest of the paragraph (and other passages to follow) pretty clearly invites comparisons with the magi worshipping the baby Jesus, the newborn God’s son. Christiani’s translation of “goddestfar” include Godfather - not that far from describing the theological role taken by the magi in relation to Jesus. (All in all, the Shaun/Yawn sequence of III.3 may be the most overdetermined of FW; any reader trying to fix Yawn within one single frame of reference will be up against it. By what mathematical legerdemain, for instance, do the four gospellers become the three magi?)\n\n476.5: “perch:” unit of measurement, but also, in context, probably fish\n\n476.6: “Asnoch:” as McHugh notes at 474.20, Uisneach is supposed to be the geographical center of Ireland.\n\n476.6-7: “how and ever:” echoes Irish expression “howsomever” (compare 624.35), meaning, approximately, however\n\n476.7: “he proxtended:” because, at the moment, “deputising” (.4), he’s acting on behalf of, as “prox”y for, all four\n\n476.10: “they set:” as a verb, “set” can be either present or past tense, and here it serves as pivot to a rare present-tense sequence: “they…nod, bend, bow, and curtsey” (.10-11); at .14 (“they made”) things will be back to past tense.\n\n476.12-3: “travelling court on its findings circuiting:” travelling courts were “circuit” courts. Also, “court” as in “court cards” (appears in “Lotus Eaters”) – king, queen, jack. For Tarot cards, there are four: king, queen, knight, page. Compare “odd trick of the pack” at .17.\n\n476.11-2: “their broadawake prober’s hats:” as McHugh notes, a “wideawake hat” has an exceptionally broad brim. So did the “Boer’s hat,” which at one time could have signalled hostility toward England during the Boer War. In “Circe,” when Stephen is accused of being a “proBoer” by a drunken English soldier, it is probably because of his broad-brimmed hat.\n\n476.14: “stenoggers:” elided “graph” is probably imitative: stenographers write either in shorthand or with contracted versions of the original words.\n\n476.14-5: “psychomorers:” sycamores – always or almost always go with FW’s four old men\n\n476.17: “the odd trick of the pack, trump:” the joker. In euchre, it counts as the highest trump.\n\n476.20-2: “amengst the poppies and, I can tell you something more than that, drear writer, profoundly as you may bedeave to it, he was oscasleep asleep:” Matthew as Mesmer has put him to sleep – hence the bed of poppies. Starting at 496.2, Oscar (“oscasleep”) Wilde will emerge as one the main presences buried within Yawn.\n\n476.23: “unctuous:” as in Extreme Unction, applied to the dying. (At first, the four wonder whether Yawn is dead.)\n\n476.24-5: “coaching his preferred constellations in faith and doctrine:” “constellations:” also congregations. (A constellation is a selective congregation of stars; see next entry.) The pope is the supreme authority on matters of faith and doctrine; see .30 and note.\n\n476.25-6: \"old Matt Gregory, 'tis he had the starmenagerie:\" accorcing to a Joyce letter, based on a song with the words \"Old Tom Gregory, Has a big menagerie.\"\n\n476.25-8: “Matt…Hossaleen:” three of the four gospellers here seem matched with their usual symbols: Matthew, as angel, in his “starmenagerie,” Mark as (“Lyons”) lion, Luke as (“Metcalfe”) calf, of an ox. But (“mack…Jonny”) Johnny MacDougal? There ought to be an eagle in there somewhere, but your annotator can’t find it. Instead, as “Jonny na Hossaleen” (see McHugh), John is apparently fused with the ass that often accompanies him. Again, these are the “usual” symbols. In other versions, Matthew can be the lion, Luke a manservant, etc. The apostle John is the non-Synoptic one of the four, and John/Johnny typically lags behind the other three.\n\n476.25-6: “starmenagerie:” because of all the animals it includes, the Zodiac (along with other constellations) could fairly be called a star-menagerie. The perspective is of water reflecting the night sky, with its constellations.\n\n476.30: “fuming censor:” another address to the reader, like “drear writer” (.21), dear dreary reader/writer: as readers we both accept and reject (censor) what we encounter on the written page; in the latter case, we may, like some readers of Joyce, be indignant – fuming – at what we choose or pretend not to recognize, not to mention all the stuff we really just don’t get. Also, as “censer,” another allusion to church services and practice – Confirmation at .24-5, Last Rites at .23. (Here, I would also suggest adding the burial of one pope and installation of another.) Also, allusion to Keats’ “fume of poppies” in “Ode to Autumn” (compare .20) – the thurifer’s censer is burning opium along with, or in place of, incense. Also, opiate of the masses\n\n476.31-5: “cooched…curchycurchy:” coochy-coochy, curchy-curchy: adult imitation baby-talk, to go with the “tops or kites or hoops or marbles,” children’s games to play with the “wee bairn” (477.3) the four old men are dotingly “gawking on.” This approach will soon change.\n\n476.32: “question time:” in the House of Commons\n\n476.33: “the map of the souls’ groupography rose in relief:” a relief map (compare 595.3-4 and note) is three-dimensional, either using shadings to indicate relative heights and depths, or with the surface augmented and dented in an approximation of the ground’s contour. “Groupography” incorporates “geography” and “group” – the latter because the translucent water also reflects the four, looking down, and seeing themselves and Jaun at the same time activates adjustment to a stereoscopic perspective. Thus (see 475.4-5 and note), Shaun has now gone from square to cube, from two-dimensional to three-dimensional.\n\n476.34: “quarterings:” four divisions on a heraldic field\n\n476.34: “tops:” spinning tops\n\n476.36: “softnoising:” e.g., “Hush!”\n\n477.1-2: “And it is what they began to say to him tetrahedrally then, the masters, what way was he:” heavily Irished English, approaching parody. Brendan O Hehir revises as: “And what they began to say to him was…how was he.”\n\n477.1: “tetrahedrally:” a “tetramorph” is a representation of the four evangelists as figures in four quarters of a picture in one frame: compare the four as “quartermasters” (.13). The Book of Kells includes a highly stylized example. A tetrahedron is pyramid-shaped.\n\n477.4: \"Yerra:\" 399.9 has established this as a Munster word.\n\n477.4: “my leader:” given that Matthew has just stretched out his hand to exert hypnotic influence over Yawn (and the others), I think it pertinent that the German equivalent would be “mein führer.”\n\n477.10: “outathat:” “out of that:” Irish expression for wish that someone would move or leave – here, as the four separate to spread out a net between them\n\n477.14-7: “kid…Chirpy…hospices…chap:” as for 476.25-8, some but not all the items here seem to match the Evangelical symbols. “Chirpy” would be John the eagle; “chap,” as man, Mark. With some stretching, “kid” might pass as the goat equivalent of the Luke who at 476.26 was apparently the (usually ox) “-calf-.” But “hospices?” Your annotator cannot make it into a lion or cub or anything like.\n\n477.18: “in the back of their mind’s ear:” instead of “mind’s eye:” recognizing and incorporating echoes and overtones, however faint. A faculty useful when reading FW in general, and nowhere moreso than in this chapter, with its overplus of what I am calling “responses” (see .32 and note) to the garbled or misheard words of others\n\n477.20: “fine…nansen nets:” nainsook is finespun cotton, or clothes made from the material; in “Nausicaa” Gerty has “nainsook knickers.” “Fine” or not, probably not the right stuff for fishing nets\n\n477.20: “nets:” crisscrossing light-lines from sky reflected on surface, as in a David Hockney swimming pool; compare “meshing” (.23). From Joyce’s poem “Alone:” The moon’s greygolden meshes make / All night a veil.”\n\n477.21: “thurrible mystagogue:” On FW’s last page ALP will cry out, “Save me from those therrble prongs!” – probably, I suggest, because thuribles are or were standard features of a funeral mass. III.3 is a wake as well as a birth. Not clear to me why Mark would be the “mystagogue:” John is usually considered to be the most mystical of the four.\n\n477.22: “his crucifer’s cauda:” the crucifer (here, Johnny) carries the cross in a church procession – usually leading, but sometimes the last in line. Along with the three magi with their gifts (see McHugh), Johnny with the cross rounds out the pack of four. His “cauda” (again, see McHugh) is his donkey, with the cross on its back.\n\n477.23: “backslibris:” another address to the reader, inflected by “ex libris”\n\n477.23: “slipping beauty:” another address to the reader, who is nodding off\n\n477.23-6: “meshing that way, when he rose to it, with the planckton at play about him, the quivers of scaly silver and their clutches of chromes of the highly lucid spanishing gold:” compare “Proteus:” ”Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly…Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.”\n\n477.24: “meshing:” again, as in .20: seen through the crisscrossing light reflections on the surface. Same for “mazing” (.27)\n\n477.24: “when he rose to it:” as in “rose to the bait:” Yaun will wind up (525.19-32) as a fish (or eel) being hooked.\n\n477.25-6: “planckton at play about him, the quivers of scaly silver and their clutches of chromes of the highly lucid spanishing gold:” reflection of starlight on water surface. (Oxford editors* change “quivers” to “quavers,” which would emphasize the waviness of the overall effect.) Also, “Spanish gold,” from conquistador days, was synonymous with gold at its finest, and – always, among other things - the four are (see McHugh) treasure-seeking divers, hoping to salvage silver and gold from a submerged Spanish galleon. “Clutches” as in clutch bag. Silver is “scaly” because reflected off the silvery scales of fish. “Spanishing” echoes vanishing: everything in this sequence is a matter of Now you see (or hear) it, now you don’t – again, of quivering/quavering/wavering/wavy sensations.\n\n*Incidental note: According to the Oxford editors’ tally of “Selected Variants,” III.3 has, of all FW’s chapters, both the highest number and the highest percentage of what might be called either textual errors or, simply, passages in dispute. Certainly, in my own run-through, it has occasioned, by far, more suggested textual changes, as signaled by standard phrases such “Oxford editors suggest” or “Oxford editors insert,” than any of the others, for instance more than twice as many as for of II.3, a chapter almost as long. It is also the least cohesive chapter of FW. III.3 begins as a recognizable extension of its predecessor, III.2, and moves on to a frantic cacophony of sometimes barely distinguishable voices, from out of which, like Alexander hacking apart the Gordian knot, HCE emerges with FW’s longest and most emphatic monologue. These are three different things, loosely conjoined. According to Jean-Michel Rabaté (“The Fourfold Root of Yawn’s Unreason: Chapter III.3,” Luca Crispi and Sam Slote, Editors, How Joyce Wrote Finnegans Wake: A Chapter-by-Chapter Genetic Guide (Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 2008), 384-409), this disjunctiveness may have to do with the circumstances of its composition. Whether it also accords with the author’s overall plan for the book, whether it constitutes the pivotal point, corresponding to Act IV in one of Shakespeare’s plays, where things break down for good, chaos reigns for a spell, and a new order begins to build, is probably an unanswerable question, but be it noted that up until 532.6, when HCE’s monologue takes over, one of its major subjects is how hard it is to get matters settled once and for all, how difficult-to-impossible it can be to understand anything or, especially, anybody. On this subject, please see my note to .32, below. In a number of ways, things not adding up is a large part of what III.3 is about.\n\n477.28: “thripthongue:” Hamlet: “speak it trippingly on the tongue.”\n\n477.28: “his blurbeous lips:” being underwater, he is burbling.\n\n477.29: “moor:” as McHugh notes, the song to follow (.33) is by Thomas Moore. In fact, it is from the collection commonly called “Moore’s Melodies,” as echoed in “melding mellifond” (.30).\n\n477.30: “melding mellifond indo his mouth:” expression: “Butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth” – used of a sweet-talker. “Melding mellifond” twice includes Latin mel, honey.\n\n477.31: “Y?:” first, the beginning of “Yawn.” Second, as McHugh notes, pronounced as hard Y, “Why?” – why are you here, asking me these questions? Third, pronounced as soft Y, a call for Issy/Iseult. Yawn is, among other things, Tristan, calling out for his Iseult, a.k.a. “Ysold” (113.19); his quest, beginning here, will reach a crescendo on page 500. (As McHugh notes, Swift’s Stella is another prominent object of desire.)\n\n477.32: “Before You!:” “Y” comes before “U” in “you.” Perhaps also a reversal of the polite “after you:” T.S. Eliot remarked that he’d never succeeded in getting through a door after Joyce.\n\nThis is probably the first example of a major feature of III.3: language being misheard and misinterpreted in exchanges of dialogue. (Compare, for instance, the “Throwaway” story of Ulysses.) For the rest of the exchanges between Yawn and his interrogators, I will be noting some but by no means all of these miscommunications, designating them as underlined “response”s – that is, instances where Yawn has answered according to his misunderstanding of a word or phrase in a question addressed to him or spoken in his presence. (Influence or not, to my knowledge the closest approximation outside of Joyce is Love’s Labour’s Lost.) Although such misprisions are a recurring feature of FW as a whole, for instance in the trial scenes of I.3 and I.4, III.3 definitely has the highest concentration for the most extended stretch – essentially, from 447.31 to 532.5.\n\n477.33: “Ecko!:” Ecce Homo: portrait of Jesus by Elijah Garcia Martinez. Joyce wrote an essay on it. Pilate’s words, referring to the scourged Christ. A frequent subject in religious art. Compare 480.14-5. Also,identified by Ian MacArthur and Viviana-Mirela Braslasu (Genetic Joyce Studies 2022) as a bakelite \"Ekco\" radio model of the 1930's. The sense that the listeners are tuning in (\"Now, to come nearer zone\" (478.6) would seem to confirm.\n\n477.34: “lions’ odor?:” perhaps law and order. American spelling of “odor”/”odour” is notable.\n\n477.35: “Friends!:” that is, Relax! We are friends, not enemies\n\n477.35: “yu:” McHugh notes that this is an “Ulster pronunciation of “you.” (Also, “yur” for “your.”) Throughout III.3, it seems to be a signature for Matthew, whose questions are typically the harshest and most percussive. (Compare the opening of “Counterparts:” [Mr Alleyne’s] furious voice called out in a piercing north of Ireland accent” - as it happens, Alleyne’s relatively small share of the story’s dialogue contains over half its “you”s and “your”s – and the “sharp Ulster voice” that offends Stephen in Portrait, chapter five.) With one exception (623.9), all FW’s “yu”s and “yur”s occur in the dialogue passages of III.3. (In some cases, the same speaker will use “yu”/”yur” and “you”/”your.”)\n\nIdentifying the speakers by their accents is tricky – sometimes fairly easy, often not. Matthew is usually bossy. Luke, from the region of the Blarney Stone, can be exceptionally talkative in a sloothery way. (John Kelleher, deeply informed on these matters, once told me that Corkonians from Munster had a reputation for being “cute.”) Coming from the west, John is provincial and the most stage-Irish of the four. For me, Luke, from Dublin, is the most difficult to pin down. Presumably, as the urban opposite to John’s Connacht, he should be the cosmopolitan one, and perhaps that would help account for his accent’s being the least identifiably regional. In any case, a native speaker, not your annotator, would obviously be the best guide on these matters. The truly excellent FW reading recorded by Barry McGovern, with Marcella Riordan as ALP, available through Amazon and Audible Books (this is an unsolicited endorsement), succeeds in making the four oldsters distinguishable by their accents.\n\n477.36: “orangery:” Yawn is the speaker, answering Matthew’s request to identify his “historical grouns,” grounds. Compare the “fragments of orangepeel, the last remains of an outdoor meal” (110.29-30) found in an “orangeflavoured mudmound” (111.34) – the site of FW’s many excavations, including this one. It is, among of course other things, the remnants of a picnic, which included oranges. In FW’s last pages, ALP recalls/reenacts a picnic trip to Howth, favorite picnic locations for John Stanislaus Joyce and family - as well, of course, for the Blooms.\n\n478.1: “orangery:” origin, the historical grounds called for – but also one of the few responses where the speaker is, apparently, heard correctly. (McHugh has the speaker here as Mark; your annotator inclines toward Matthew, an Orangeman from Ulster.)\n\n478.3: “Throsends:” taking “letters” (.2) in the epistolary sense, he recalls the thousands (probably an exaggeration) of letters exchanged between himself and “Y.” Also, Oxford editors change to “Thorsends.” I can find no sign of Thor or thunder in the vicinity, but two lines later, while magnifying the thousands into “Millions,” Yawn will (apparently) be referring to the same letters as “godsends” (.5), and at 269.17 we were informed that “Every letter is a godsend,” the gods in question including Zeus, Thor’s thundering counterpart.\n\n478.5: “For godsends:” Godsends, of course, and also For God’s sake! - but also compare “godsons’” (476.3-4).\n\n478.6: “zone:” a radio station’s broadcasting area; as such the term was in use among amateur radio operators.\n\n478.7: “this maggers:” in some versions, the letter begins with a variant of either “Majesty” or “Dear Majesty.” Oxford editors italicize “maggers.”\n\n478.8-16: “I am told…hopenhaven:” compare Richard Chevinix Trench, On the Study of Words, p. 29: “Thus I have read of a tribe in New Holland, which has no word to signify God, but has a word to designate a process by which an unborn child is destroyed in the bosom of the mother.” Reflects a period of linguistic study when a given group’s range of vocabulary was held to be a map of its priorities. The Eskimos, supposedly with fourteen different words for “snow,” was the standard example. For both Trench and the FW inquisitor, the main significance is moral. In the case of the latter, the tribe in question has plenty of words for “monarch” but nothing corresponding to “majesty.” This absence is taken as a sign of historic and moral underdevelopment. Compare .10-11 and note, and see 123.1-2 and note: “Majesty,” in the Latin of the Roman Empire, could convey godliness as well as authority.\n\n478.9-10: “six hundred and six…malherbal Magis…wand:” language of black magic. “606” is an alternate version of “666.”\n\n478.9: “ragwords:” compare ALP on the subject of her letter: “Rags!” (619.19) – as in, rag paper.\n\n478.10: “wald man rimes alpman:” wild man goes with (“alp-“) mountain man. Mountain dwellers, highlanders for instance, are proverbially untamable.\n\n478.10: “rimes…resin:” expression: without rhyme or reason\n\n478.10-11: “there is resin in all roots for monarch:” a justification of – reason for - hereditary monarchy\n\n478.10-1: “resin in all roots:” resin comes from trees. It is also the main ingredient of (“torpentine” (.13)) turpentine.\n\n478.13: “nor no rheda rhoda or torpentine path:” in addition to (McHugh) Rome’s Rhaetian Road, probably also royal road, contrasted with (Latin torquēre, to twist) twisted or twisty path. Again (compare .8-16 and note) this is an anthropologist’s tut-tutting about the backward aborigines under study: unlike Rome, famous for its roads, you guys don’t even have decent ruts.\n\n478.19: “How? C’est mal prononsable, tartagliano, perfrances. Vous n’avez d’o dans votre boche provenciale, mousoo:” response: misled by “Frankly” (.13) and perhaps also mishearing “messio” (.13) as “Monsieur” or “Messieurs,” Yawn has taken the speaker’s Latin (.13-4) as the words of someone trying, stutteringly, to speak French, and doing it badly, presumably because the speaker’s provincial idiom has left him with an unacceptably pronounced French “o.” (The questioner’s last word, “intelligow,” ended with an “o” sound.) Still, he replies in French that is at least equally fractured (.19-22). For the second sentence, Oxford editors have “Vous n’avez d’O dong votre bousch provenciale, monsoo” – making the French even worse.\n\nAs becomes clear at .26, Yawn during this sequence is, or is channeling, Saint Patrick, who grew up on the western fringes of the Roman Empire as it was collapsing, and whose peregrinations, voluntary and otherwise, made him familiar with Latin, French, Gaelic, and early English, although not necessarily fluent in any: the exchange here indicates maladroitness in two languages at once. Patrick’s autobiographical Confessio is written in what is generally taken to be amateurish Latin, and his comparison of the shamrock to the Trinity was of, of course, non-verbal. On his FW showing, he was better off keeping things that way.\n\n478.19: “tartagliano:” response to interrogator’s “tartallaght” (.12)\n\n478.21: “Moy jay trouvay la clee dang les champs:” more sub-par French (here, the Irish equivalent of Franglais), this time, again, as Saint Patrick, who (versions vary) spent time in France before going to Ireland and finding the shamrock Trinity in the (“champs”) field. See next entry. N.B.: Oxford editors change “champs” to “chants.” This makes sense in its own terms – they have been discussing problems of understanding arising from translation and pronunciation, for instance speaking words as opposed to chanting them, and chanting, being musical, has a (“clee”) key – but given the context, an overtone of “champs” would seem to remain in play. After all, Patrick really did find the key to his faith in the field.\n\n478.22: “poddy:” Paddy, an affectionate name for Saint Patrick, a (usually) not-affectionate term for an Irishman\n\n478.24: “jambs…messiah:” responses to “champs”/”chants” (see note to .21) and “mousoo” (.21, .20)\n\n478.25: “cloover…trefling:” Patrick’s shamrock (see .21 and note) is clover, and a trefoil. Again, he found it in the field and adopted it as the symbol of his faith, which was clever of him.\n\n478.25: “A true’s to:” a truce to – i.e., enough of that. Occurs in “Oxen of the Sun”\n\n478.26: “Trinathan partnick dieudonnay:” not exactly, as I’m using the term, a response, but definitely cued by talk of the shamrock’s Trinity. As McHugh notes, the three main components are Swift, Patrick, and Tristan, three Irishmen mashed together and redistributed, trinitarily.\n\n478.27: “Typette, my tactile O!:” with “tactile O” read as (McHugh) “dactylo,” this reads as a double (“tactile”) dactyl.\n\n478.30: “sohohold!:” a stammered “so old.” Oxford editors replace with “sohohohold.”\n\n478.32: “What are yu shevering about,…like a houn:” for “houn,” McHugh has “hound;” Helmut Bonheim has German Huhn, chicken. Your annotator sides with the latter – to wit, Biddy, the “original hen,” the “iceclad shiverer” who first found the letter (110.22-4). See 479.33 and note.\n\n478.32: “doraphobian:” McHugh translates as someone with “dread of touching;” Brendan O Hehir as someone with “fear of gifts.” Again, I side more with the latter. As magi, the questioners are bringers of gifts.\n\n478.32-3: “Or do yu want yur primafairy schoolmam?:” sarcastic: does the big baby want his mama? “Primafairy:” pinafore, a garment worn by children. “Schoolmam:” schoolmarm. Again, the “yu” is a Matthew word.\n\n478.36: “I know that place better than anyone:” the cue here is “padredges” (.34), which Johnny mishears as “partridges,” a game bird like “greyleg,” “duck,” and “plover” (.35-6), therefore for hunting. Coming from the west, Johnny is the outdoorsy one of the four. Foclut (“fogloot” (.34)) is in Connacht.\n\n479.1: “the fourth day:” depending on whether you count from Sunday, Monday, or Good Friday, either Wednesday, Thursday, or Monday\n\n479.3: “they:” the hunting dogs\n\n479.4-5: “Tortoiseshell for a guineagould:” again, compare “Oxen of the Sun” term for extreme odds: “Guinea to a goosegog.” Probably pertinent that, as Stephen recalls in “Nestor,” shells have sometimes been used for money. Also, “Guinea Gold” was a popular brand of cigarette; compare 179.34, 325.26.\n\n479.5: “Burb! Burb! Burb!:” the sound of the hunting dogs. Compare the harriers of “Circe:” “Bulbul! Burblblburblbl!” See next entry.\n\n479.6: “Tucurlugh:” “cur” echoes the hunting dogs; “Lugh” is the Gaelic god of light.\n\n479.9: “zoedone of the zephyros:” ozone, blown in by the zephyrs, winds. Compare Simon Dedalus in Portrait, chapter one: “We got a good breath of ozone round the Head today.”\n\n479.10: “thass withumpronouceable tail:” Oxford editors have “withunpronounceable.” A long shot, here. The expression “Irish is tied to a donkey’s tail” was used to justify not teaching Gaelic to children, the point being that it would be a ticket to rural poverty; the link may be that for native English speakers, Gaelic is indeed (for instance, “Dun Laughaire”) often unpronounceable.\n\n479.12: “the Anchor on the Mountain:” probably the name of a pub. Popular pub names in the British Isles include “Anchor and Crown,” “Anchor and Horseshoes,” etc.\n\n479.13: “Pat:” response to “padredges” (478.34)\n\n479.14: “Dood and I dood:” response to “Polldoody” (.6). “I dood” for “I did:” in America of the time, would signify a bumpkin.\n\n479.14-5: “Whydoyoucallme?:” whatchamaycallit. Response to “Whateveryournameis?” (.13)\n\n479.15: “flingamejig:” thingamajig. Goes, obviously, with (see previous entry) whatchamaycallit.\n\n479.15: “twolves:” either two or twelve wolves\n\n479.16: “Turcafiera:” probably a response to “Tucurlugh” (.6). If so, an instance (there are others) of one of the questioners answering one of the other questioners as if the latter were Yawn – a case of either real or surmised ventriloquy. Compare 480.25: “You took the words out of my mouth.”\n\n479.18: “bleather:” breather, blather\n\n479.19: “turnstone:” turnpike milestone\n\n479.20: “you invocate austers for the trailing of vixens:” you advocate oysters for fox-hunting. Probably nonsense on its own terms, this is a misprision - a response - of Yawn’s excited talk about “austers” (.6) while reminiscing about hunting (478.35-479.6). Although Yawn’s memory was, at least initially, of hunting game birds, his rambling on about coursing dogs “straining at the leash” and barking “Burb! Burb! Burb!” (.4-5) apparently changed the venue, at least in Mark’s hearing, to a fox hunt. Again, compare the fox hunt in “Circe:” “(…the beagle’s call, giving tongue) Bulbul! Burblburlblbl!”\n\n479.21-2: “send a cormorant around this blue lagoon:” cormorants are impressive fishers. They hover, buckle (with thanks to G. M. Hopkins), dive, and after about thirty seconds, resurface, invariably with a fish in their beak.\n\n479.22: “You told my larned friend rather previously, a moment since, about this mound or barrow:” at 477.36. The learned friend was Matthew.\n\n479.25-6: “burialbattell, the boat:” At Gokstad and Oseberg, Viking boats had been discovered buried in barrows.\n\n479.26: “millions:” recalls 478.5.\n\n479.29-33: “that fourmaster barquentine, Webster says, our ship that ne’re returned. The Frenchman, I say, was an orangeboat. He is a boat. You see him. The both how you see is they. Draken af Danemork! Sacked it or ate it? What! Hennu! Spake ab laut!:” the interview becomes an elementary language lesson, beginning with (McHugh) Webster’s Dictionary definition of an unusual word, “barquentine.” Oxford editors replace “What!” with “What?” Mark is commenting on Yawn’s “This same prehistoric barrow ‘tis, the orangery” (477.36) – probably, I suggest, sarcastically mimicking his words as well.\n\n479.32: “Draken af Danemork!:” spelling here may be implying, not unreasonably, that Queen Elizabeth’s favorite pirate, Sir Francis Drake, was the English equivalent of the Viking marauders. Drake’s place in Irish history is not a happy one; he is remembered mainly for his 1575 massacre of the Irish, soldiers and civilians, on Rathlin Island. (Still, there is, or was, a monument to him in County Cork.) See See 480.1, “Her raven flag was out,” and McHugh annotation.\n\n479.33: “Hennu!:” again, Yawn addressed as a hen – recalling Biddy, the original letter-unearther.\n\n479.33: “Spake ab laut:” Speak up loud! Perhaps also “ablative” of the language lesson; also, as McHugh notes, German Ablaut, “vowel gradation”\n\n479.34: “Couch, cortege, ringbarrow, dungcairn:” see McHugh. In succession, four stages of dying: sickbed, then funeral, then burial, then earth-to-earth (or dung)\n\n479.34-480.5: “Couch…Folchu!:” Mark has loosened Yawn’s collar and ordered him to speak up. This declamatory response, with its seven exclamation marks, shows that he’s doing as told.\n\n479.34: “Beseek ye the runes:” whether or not it panned out, looking for – seeking out - runes in a Viking barrow would make sense. Also, overtone of ruins: looking through the ruins is a lot of what FW is about.\n\n479.35-6: “Allmaun away when you hear the ganghorn:” that is, All ashore that’s going ashore. Probable overtone of “Anchors aweigh”\n\n479.36: “Nautsen. Ess Ess unearthed. O ess.:” see McHugh. Whether or not Nansen ever sent out an S.O.S., there were times when it certainly would have made sense. Also, the Viking boat’s (.32) dragon (serpentine) figurehead, hissing – perhaps Ireland’s exiled snakes, returning. Nansen was Norwegian, a descendent of Vikings.\n\n480.1: “two lay payees:” French: tous les payees, all the countries\n\n480.1: “Her raven flag was out:” in some versions of the story, one of Tristan’s two Iseults, jealous of the other, falsely tells him that the ship coming to save him has a black sail, signaling the death of the other Iseult. He gives up and dies.\n\n480.1-2: “I trow pon good, jordan’s scaper, good’s barnet, and trustyman:” McHugh has the elements here, but just to sum up: this is a compressed, Anglo-Saxonily translated version of the Apostle’s Creed: “I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit…” “Good’s barnet,” God bairn, is Jesus; “trustyman” (along with overtone of “Tristan”) is presumably the Holy Spirit, as, something like a trustee, the one of the three still around on earth, still delegating heavenly assets.\n\n480.4: “Wolf of the sea:” compare 202.24: “a dynast of Leinster, a wolf of the sea,” and 325.21, “marelupe.” At least at 202.24, refers to Dermot MacMurrough, but it would have been a fair epithet for the other marauding mariners recalled so far, including the Vikings and Drake.\n\n480.4-5: “Folchu! Folchu!:” another response to (“fogloot” (474.34)) Foclut, and see next entry.\n\n480.6: “folklore’s:” response to “Folchu!”\n\n480.7: “parent ship:” a ship which protects or serves as home base for other ships; today might be called “mother ship”\n\n480.9: “bonofide for keeltappers:” bonafides were/are seriously dedicated drinkers; heeltaps are the least drinkable residue from the bottom of the bottle. As at 381-2, based on the first page of Joyce’s first FW draft, these guys are ready to drink up anything left.\n\n480.10: “levantine ponenter:” McHugh annotates this as eastern and western winds respectively – that is, coming from the east and west. The former would have helped (“from Daneland sailed” (.10)) a Danish marauder sailing to Ireland; the latter would have helped him to sail back.\n\n480.12: “korsets:” cursed. Also, response to “crusade” (.7).\n\n480.12: “Magnus Spadebeard:” to some degree, derived from the previous exchange. Glasheen cites the disputed “Magis” and “Magis” of 478.9 and 478.17, and notes that “Magonus” was the name given to St. Patrick when he was studying for the priesthood in France. (Whether Patrick’s beard counts as a “spade beard” is debatable.) Again, a re-sorting of the Patrick and France strands. Yawn seems to be conflating his memory of Patrick’s arrival with the Viking invasions. Also, Magnus is of course a Roman surname. (The Romans, however, never occupied Ireland.)\n\n480.12: “welsher perfyddye:” a take-off on “perfidious Albion”\n\n480.13: “A destroyer in our port:” perhaps echoes Irish term for English, “Strangers in our house.” Again, fits the Vikings more than it does Patrick, unless Yawn is currently channeling some pre-Patrick Druid\n\n480.13: “baling scoop:” after all, a sensible possession on any ocean vessel\n\n480.14-5: “Ecce Hagios Chrisman!:” again (see 477.33 and note), reference to “Ecce Homo.” Continues the sequence of “crusade,” “korsets crosser” (.7, .12), then “Oh, Jeyses” and Futtfishy” (.16)\n\n480.16: “Oh, Jeyses, fluid! Says the poisoned well!:” not sure, but this seems to be something along the order of “Pot calling the kettle black,” sarcastically rendered – a poisoned well complaining about poison. In any event, Johnny, the speaker, is not having any of Yawn’s professed piety.\n\n480.16: “Jeyses…Futtfishy:” cued by “Ecce Homo Chrisman” (Jesus). Early Christians represented Jesus as a fish. Oxford editors insert an apostrophe after “Jeyses.”\n\n480.18-9: “Dunlin and turnstone augur us where:” as McHugh notes, dunlin and turnstone are birds, as is the cormorant of .21-2. Augury is divination by observation of the flights of birds.\n\n480.25: “pancercrucer:” probable allusion to Thomas Hardy’s poem “Panthera,” in which Panthera, the real father of Jesus, is present at the crucifixion. (A tradition derived from Origen’s Contra Celsum.) The theme returns in III.4, when one of the sons has a nightmare of his father as (“phanthares” (565.19)) phantom panther.\n\n480.26: “dragon vicefather:” Viking, with dragon prow\n\n480.26: “Hillcloud encompass us!:” may a fog conceal us from our pursuers! (Irish and other mythologies include stories of heroes being saved by such interventions.) Also, compare “cloud-crowned,” “cloud-topped,” for what Yeats calls a “vapour-turbaned steep.”\n\n480.27: “you lived as milky at their lyceum:” answer to Yawn’s most recent words, about how a native laid “bare his breastpaps to give suck” (.13-4). Associative connection is probably via Romulus and Remus story; see .34-5 and note.\n\n480.30: “dob dob:” response to “Dyb! Dyb!” (.28). Given context, the practice of bear-baiting – bears being torn apart by dogs – is probably pertinent; in the next line we learn that the “whole totem pack” is “after” him. The hunter has become the hunted.\n\n480.30: “like old Booth’s:” compare “Eumaeus:” “lie like old boots.”\n\n480.31: “cubs:” compare “pups” of .19.\n\n480.31: “the whole totem pack:” not forgetting that the four inquisitors are also a pack of cards, with four suits. Four “vuk”s will follow immediately.\n\n480.32: “Robinson’s shield:” the Robinson coat of arms features three bucks, here the prey of the barking hounds (or wolves). The family is from Ulster.\n\n480.33: “Scents and gouspils:” because of the hunt, the exclamation “Saints and gospels!” is turned into the scents (of the prey) and (see McHugh) French for foxes.\n\n480.33: “animal jangs:” perhaps from “jangle,” originally meaning jabber – endlessly silly talk. In this case, “jangs” is a noun, and the point is that there’s been too much silly talk having to do with animals. Reference is to Yawn’s “vuk vuk and vuk vuk” (.31-2).\n\n480.34: “fingall:” Fine Gael: since 1933, a major Irish political party\n\n480.34: “Here howl me wiseacre’s hat:” “Here, hold my hat:” a fairly common vernacular expression, signaling that the speaker is about to do something – often, get into a fight. Here, shows exasperation\n\n480.34: “wiseacre’s hat:” wideawake hat, a hat with a wide brim and low crown\n\n480.34-5: “till I die of the milkman’s lupus:” that is, for a very long time. Conjecture: an example of how anything can have to with animals if you want it to – although, as usual, there may be a method behind the mixedness: the sequence has been full of talk of animals in general and of wolves in particular, and Romulus and Remus were suckled on the milk of the she-wolf Luperca. In the earlier “you lived as milky at their lyceum, couard, while you learned, volp, volp, to howl yourself wolfwise” (.24-6) “lyceum” would promote a folk-etymological reading of “λνκέίος,” which derives from a Greek epithet for Apollo, as “λνκος,” Greek for wolf – hence, for instance “lycanthropy.” Yawn’s intense fear at this point – why he is called a “couard” (.27) - may have to do with the remembered perils of his birth and infancy: Romulus’ cruel uncle had meant to kill him and his brother. Also, “couard”/coward/cow by proximity to “milky” (.27)\n\n481.1: “holystone!:” holystone was used on ships to, for instance, scour the decks. Also, probably, heliotrope: a weak echo, but in II.1 the heliotrope, a.k.a. bloodstone, is emphatically established as a helio/holy stone. Also, see .4.\n\n481.2: “Courser, Recourser:” response to “fingall harriers” (480.34), before then the “coursing” hounds of the Connacht fox hunt (479.4)\n\n481.4: “cataleptic:” compare Stephen’s “Proteus” “catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.” Here the first line (.1) may qualify as catalectic trochaic pentameter: “Hail him / heathen, / heal him / holy /stone - !” I confess myself unequal to scanning for (McHugh) “trochaic dimeter brachycatalectic,” but given the emerging subject (the father) it may be pertinent that mithyphallic/ithyphallic chants accompanied the parading of images of erections. See next entry.\n\n481.4: “Totem:” a totem is ithyphallic.\n\n481.6: “Be fair, Chris!:” a pretty bloody impertinent way of addressing Jesus, particularly coming from a magus or gospeler. See .9 and note.\n\n481.6: “ere bawds plied:” before prostitutes sold themselves\n\n481.7: “Ona nonday I sleep:” response to “Mundi” (.6). Oxford editors have “On a” for “Ona.” It is this annotator’s belief that FW’s default date is Monday, March 21, 1938, extending to the morning of March 22, that the book’s sleeper is upstairs, in bed, throughout Monday (including (“nonday” = noonday = midday) the daylight hours), and that he awakes on the next morning, as recorded in Book IV. Also, III.3 takes place at “nonday” – night - and “sleep” is present tense: he’s still sleeping, or trying to.\n\n481.8-9: “May…Fia! Fia!:” tradition that the name “Mafia” originated when a Sicilian mother, fearing for her daughter (“fia”), called out “Ma fia!” The story originated during the Sicilian Vespers. (See 21.18-9 and note.)\n\n481.8: “fearfilled:” aside from (McHugh) fulfilled, filled with fear\n\n481.9: “Befurcht christ!:” response to “Be fair, Chris!” (.6). (Also, probably an admonition: you should fear Christ, and not be so flippant about it: see first note to .6.) The “Sinflowed” (Noah’s flood, wiping out a sinful world) just cited (.9) is one good example of why.\n\n481.10-19: “I have…Bap!:” resumes (mainly Latin) language lesson. See .16-9 and note.\n\n481.10: “tristich:” triptych. (Also, McHugh cites definition, “three lines of verse,” which describes .1-3.) Probably for father, son, and holy ghost\n\n481.11: “fui fui:” response to “Fia! Fia!” (.9). Also, compare “Fuitfiat” (As it was, let it be) of 613.14. Apart from the American expression “Phooey!,” “fui,” repeated, the internet informs me, is Portuguese for “I have been.”\n\n481.12-5: “comming noun from the asphalt to the concrete, from the human historic brute, Finnsen Faynean, occeanyclived, to this same vulganized hillsir from yours, Mr “Tupling Toun of Morning de Heights:” A “hillsir” is a common noun, as opposed to the capitalized name “Finnsen Faynean.” Oxford editors replace “vulganized” with “vulcanized.” (Following through, the next line includes “lavast [or “lavas:” see first entry for .15] flow;” a “vulcanized hillsir” is presumably, among other things, an active volcano; the conceit seems to be that the city’s “asphalt” and “concrete,” temporarily fluid but now hardened into roads and civic structures, originated in a volcano’s flow of lava.) “Finnegan’s Wake” is an American song, originating in New York, with its asphalt and concrete, home of (“Morning de Heights”) Morningside Heights. Spelling of “occeanyclived” brings in Ossian, whose (supposed) writings heroicised Finn. As usual, the testimony is mined with qualifications - “brute,” for instance, or “Fenian” as “Faynean:” see second .13 note.\n\n481.13: “Finnsen Faynean:” another permutation of “Fia! Fia!” and “fui fui.”\n\n481.13: “Faynean:”“[Dolce] far niente:” It is sweet to do nothing. Occurs in “Lestrygonians”\n\n481.14: “hillsir:” half-sir; a squireen, an Irishman with pretensions to gentility. Definitely a step down\n\n481.14: Tupling Toun:” again, Tim Finnegan, who tippled and tumbled. The song goes, “Tim had a kind of a tippling way.”\n\n481.14: “from yours:” British military expression “of ours” signifies a fellow member of one’s regiment. Here, the opposite, twice\n\n481.15: “with his lavast flow and his rambling undergroands:” again, Oxford editors replace “lavast” with “lavas.” Given that the subject will soon emerge as “the farther…Ouer Tad” (.19-20), this reminds me of Joyce’s father, as described in John Wyse Jackson’s and Peter Costello’s John Stanislaus Joyce: a volcanic temper, a great, sometimes rambling, flow of talk, punctuated with groans and imprecations.\n\n481.15: “rambling undergroands:” New York subway trains make rumbling noises audible to above-ground pedestrians; London subways, being much deeper underground, do not. This one arrives “Ad Horam” (.16), on time.\n\n481.16: \"reoccur...as old Romeo Rogers:\" as identified in Genetic Joyce Studies by Daniel Ferrer, \"Old Rogers\" is a French children's-game version of the Finnegan story, acting out the \"enterrement d'un vieillard.\" Eventually, the old man rises up and chases the children away for waking him up.\n\n481.16-19: “Ad Horam, Romeo Rogers…ob…urb…differenciabus…locative:” tags from the Latin lesson. (McHugh cites “Romeo Rogers” as an allusion to Romulus and Remus, extending the ongoing raised-by-wolves thread: see 480.27, .34-5 and notes.) Oxford editors have a significantly different sequence for .17, changed from “county, and your sure ob, or by, with or from an urb” to “county by, with or from an urb, an your sure ob you know.” Still, I think, the same story: an unnecessarily confusing Latin lesson. See next entry. (“Ob urbe” would mean “from the city,” but ob can mean different things in different combinations.)\n\n481.18: “differenciabus:” O Hehir has Latin differentiabus: for “to, for, or with, by, differences, diversities, species.” As flawed Latin for “differently” (.11) – the proper word would be aliter – part of the Latin lesson from hell.\n\n481.19: “locative:” a Latin case. Not English, but the last four lines have included “Ad,” “in,” “ob,” “by,” “with,” “from,” “in,” and “in” again – all would go with locatives.\n\n481.19: “Gun, the farther…Bap! Bap!:” sound of “Gun”fire. Also, Michael Gunn, proprietor of Dublin’s Gaiety Theatre, is an FW father figure. Compare next.\n\n481.20-482.2: “- Ouer Tad…sanction!:” Yawn’s interrogator had just ordered him to come down from the abstract to the concrete, from the totem-like demigod Yawn remembered at .1-6 to a more (“vulganized”/”vulcanized”(.9)) vulgarized version of the father, for instance the Tim of “Finnegan’s Wake.” Yawn complies with down-to-earth language (almost none of his questioner’s Latin) and scandalous rumors.\n\n481.20: “Tad:” Dad, the (“farther”) father just mentioned. A response to “farther” and “Bap! Bap!” (.19), “Bappy,” as at 277.18, a version of “Pappy”\n\n481.20: “orbits:” obits – obituaries. Response to fragments (“ob,” “urb”) of “Urbi et Orbi” sounded at .17\n\n481.21: “humeplace:” given obituaries (see previous entry), a “humeplace” would be where he was inhumed, buried. The seven possible locations (.21-2) are not, as with Homer (see McHugh), birthplaces, but instead deathplaces; the obituary writers have listed seven different locations. (HCE is frequently itemized as, or broken up into, sevens, and there are seven places listed here.)\n\n481.21-2: “Smithwick, Rhonnda, Kaledon, Salem (Mass):” as Mink notes, this revises four Greek locations into Smethwick (in England), Rhonnda (in Wales), Caledonia (Scotland), and Salem, Mass (in America). Part of his (see note to 481.20-482.2) program of coming down, from the ancient classics to vulgar present-day reality\n\n481.22: “Duthless:” Joyce’s lists often include at least one questionable entry. Mink and McHugh both list this as Athens, but the connection remains obscure.\n\n481.23-4: “every at man like myself:” every man for himself. Also, given that this begins with a version of the Lord’s Prayer (“Ouer Tad, Hellig Babbau” etc. (.20)), perhaps “atman,” which occurs at 596.24 and is there glossed by McHugh as Blavatsky’s word for “the spiritual self recognized as God.” (In view of the preceding, it pleases your annotator to add that the Oxford editors recommend changing “at man” to “atman.”)\n\n481.24: “Abrahamsk and Brookbear:” response to “brauchbarred in apabhramsa” (.18). Roughly, Yawn has been asked which of two possible types his father’s spirit would assume on returning to life. His answer: “he might in a sense be both” (.23) – but see .26 and note.\n\n481.25: “bapka:” response to “Bap! Bap!” of .19\n\n481.26: “Mushame!:” see .24 and note. Despite waffling, he’s afraid that the side of his father to show up would probably be the shameful (Shemian) one – the one (.26-31) with bastard offspring all over town.\n\n481.27: “stepstones:” stepping stones\n\n481.27-8: “stumbledown:” tumbledown\n\n481.29-30: “off the dosshouse back of a racerider in his truetoflesh colours:” see .26 and note. A typical example of one of the bastards: impoverished (dosshouse), all too true-to-life, too flesh-and-blood, in the resemblance to his begetter. Also, he is in the horse-racing and betting line, and - given his address - not with much success.\n\n481.30-1: “a racerider in his truetoflesh colours, either handicapped on her flat or barely repeating himself:” a couple having sex. See next three entries.\n\n481.30: “truetoflesh colours:” that is, naked. “Barely” (.31) confirms.\n\n481.30-1: “handicapped on her flat:” compare prostitute in “Circe,” on her funds: “Hardearned on the flat of my back.”\n\n481.31: “repeating himself:” compare “Ithaca:” “the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement.”\n\n481.31: “tiptip tim oldy:” tiptop Timothy. Perhaps because of the inquisition under way, Yawn seems to have acquired a touch of his father’s stutter. Old Timothy is old tippling Tim Finnegan, from .14.\n\n481.32: “I go in fear of:” compare “fearfilled” (.8).\n\n481.32: “Tommy Terracotta:” the right material for a former divinity who, it turns out, has feet of clay\n\n481.32-3: “he could be all your and my das:” the uncertainty of fatherhood, a recurring Joyce theme, is (see .26 and note) especially pertinent in this case.\n\n481.33-4: “the brodar…Ranelagh:” again, the lists referring to the father figure usually number seven.\n\n481.35: “fué fué:” Yet another response to “Fia! Fia!” of .9\n\n481.35: “Petries:” given context (see next entry), pastry\n\n481.35: “violet ice:” a 1900 recipe for “violet ice” includes vanilla ice cream and extract of violet.\n\n481.35: “I am yam:” as elsewhere in FW, Popeye (“I yam what I yam”) doubles with Jehovah (“I am that I am”)\n\n482.1: “Dodgfather, Dodgson and Coo:” Father, Son, and Co, Company. (Also, as McHugh notes, “Coo” is the sound of the Holy Ghost as the dove of the Annunciation.)\n\n482.3: “Breeze softly:” breathe (your words) softly; soft breeze. Response to “spiriduous” (.2), Spiritus, the divine breath of the Holy Spirit.\n\n482.3: “Breeze softly. Aures are aureas:” see McHugh, and compare 158.7: “a long one in midias reeds.” (Midas’s ass’s ears were long.)\n\n482.3: “Aures are aureas:” Given context (Speak softly), perhaps “Walls have ears.”\n\n482.4: “Me das has oreils:” the (“Me das”) thread, which as McHugh notes incorporates both Midas’s ass’s ears and his golden touch, began with “my das” (481.33). Compare next entry.\n\n482.4: “Piercey, piercey, piercey piercey!:” Answer to question (.3) What’s his name? It’s “Persse O’Reilly,” the hostile HCE double of I.2; compare second note to .5. Yawn has had the name suggested to him by the “Aures”-to-“oreils” word-association, combining the two best-known stories about King Midas, his (Latin aurum) touch of gold and his (Latin auris) ass’s ears. Also, after consummating with Nora, Joyce reported, “Elle est piercée,” here signaling a primal-scene memory carried forward with “Vulva! Vulva! Vulva! Vulva” (482.7)!\n\n482.5: “White eyeluscious and muddyhorsebroth!:” Oxford editors have “and no hears! Muddyhorsebroth!” It is not clear to me whether “and no hears!” is to follow “eyeluscious” or replace it. If the former, (“hears”) ears, prompted by (“oreils. Piercey” (.4)), Midas’s ears plus Persse O’Reilly, with his pierced ears, are paired with eyes.\n\n482.5: “muddyhorsebroth:” or – see previous – “Muddyhorsebroth.” There is such a thing as horsebroth, and it is muddy in consistency and color.\n\n482.6: “chiseller:” chiseler: Dublin slang for child. Suggests the speaker may be Luke of Dublin, the most urban of the four, addressing John, the most rustic of the four, to whom the others often condescend\n\n482.6: “Haltstille, Lucas and Dublinn!:” Hold still, Luke and Luke’s (Leinster) Dublin! “Haltstille:” with (McHugh) German Haltestelle, bus stop, an answer to the question just asked, “where do you get off, chiseller?” Answer: at either one of what Mink identifies as the termini of the “steam tram” that “ran from Dub[lin] to L[ucan] via C[hapelizod].”\n\n482.9-15: “- Macdougal…weight!:” speaker? McHugh names John, and the sequence certainly includes a number of John cues. On the other hand, the (rather hectoring) address appears to be to John, not from him, and the speaker is claiming that he has just heard and recognized John’s voice, presumably in the previous interjection (.6-7), ordering Luke to be quiet. Again, the interrogators sometimes wind up talking to one another, either through Yawn or just in separate spats. I suggest that the speaker here is Luke.\n\n482.9-10: “his onagrass that is, chuam and coughan!:” the donkey (on the grass), chewing (the grass) and coughing. (Do donkeys cough? The internet says yes, when sick, and at 555.12-3 the donkey – “cuddy,” “donk” – is arguably the one with the “dying boosy cough.”) FW’s donkey always goes with John. Like all the other place-names sounded in this sequence, Tuam (“chuam) and Cavan (“coughan”) come from John’s Connacht.\n\n482.10-1: “stavrotides:” as “stone crosses,” stones approximating the shape of a cross, these are found in Brittany. As “stone crosses,” or “Celtic crosses” – high stone memorial crosses, frequently combined with a circle centered at the intersection, they would predominate in the Celtic fringe, e.g. Johnny’s Connacht. Brittany was also considered a Celtic stronghold.\n\n482.11: “weslarias round your yokohahat:” fashionable lady’s hats of the time could be decorated with wisteria blossoms. “Wis” is probably changed to “wes” because Johnny comes from the west.\n\n482.12: “O’mulanchonry plucher:” melancholy creature – the donkey. (McHugh notes that “plucher” is Anglo-Irish for a wheezy cough; see .9-10 and note.)\n\n482.13: “curst of Ireland:” drink is often said to be the curse of Ireland.\n\n482.13: “Glwlwd of the Mghtwg Grwpp:” as McHugh notes, “Glewlwyd of the mighty grasp.” Probably a joky bit of imitative form: the vowels have been squeezed out by that mighty grasp. In any case, certainly requires extra effort to pronounce\n\n482.13: “Grwpp:” grippe. The passage suggests that Connacht gets the worst of Ireland’s wet weather, which is on John’s (“worst curst of Ireland” (.12-3)) wet and curst west coast. Parnell is supposed to have died as a result of having gotten soaked in Galway (in Connacht); in “The Dead,” Galway’s Michael Furey died similarly.\n\n482.15: “pull your weight:” that is, contribute your fair share of effort to the cause; Johnny is typically the laggard, the last in line. The weight being pulled is also his recalcitrant donkey.\n\n482.16-21: “Hooshin…unelgible:” hearkens back to 110.22-111.4, FW’s original excavation. There, Biddy the hen scrapes up the letter and, alternately or also, the Ardagh Chalice (also remnants of the picnic); Kevin takes over and takes credit. (Spelled “Keven” (.18); Oxford editors correct to “Kevin.”) Here, he hooshes/hushes/shoos away the (“hin” (.16)) hen (alternatively gander, guinea fowl, or French poule) that has just found (“dogumen number one”) document number one, one name for the letter.\n\n482.16: “regional’s:” “regional channels” were local radio stations.\n\n482.19: “Posthorn:” post horn: symbol of mail service; “Keven”/Kevin is a type of Shaun, the post.\n\n482.19-20: “Guiney gagag:” another overtone of “Guinea to a goosegog” from “Oxen of the Sun.” Compare 182.12-3, 452,32, 479.4-5. Also, again (see McHugh for “gagag”), a Guinea hen\n\n482.21: “an illegible downfumbed by an unelgible:” the letter is an illegible document being thumbed dumbly by the dumbfounded uneducable who has, dumbly, found it: hopelessly uncomprehending the hopelessly incomprehensible\n\n482.25-6: “crying stinking fish:” to add to McHugh’s note: the man who would not be doing this would be the fish merchant, trying to attract, not repel, customers.\n\n482.26: “stroke oar:” see McHugh. Like Matthew, the stroke oar gives the orders.\n\n482.27: “your too farfar a cock of the north there:” Oxford editors have “farfast” for “farfar.” Brewer: “He’s too far north for me. Too canny, too cunning to be taken in; very hard in making a bargain.” Said of people of Yorkshire, of Scotland, and, here, of Ulster. Also, Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon and leader of the Gordon Highlanders, was called the “cock of the north.”\n\n482.28: “due south:” nautical heading. South-north equal-opposite counterpoint of .27-30 may have to do with the “stroke oar” (.26) fact that to row in one direction is to face in the other.\n\n482.29-30: “I’m-free-Down-in-Easia:” free and easy\n\n482.33-483.1: “point…counterpoint:” to me, the following two sentences (“What…altereffects” 482.34-483.1) sound like counterpoint, with its coinciding “altereffects.”\n\n483.1: “altereffects:” aftereffects. (Probably obvious)\n\n483.3: “posterwise:” response to “Posthorn” (482.19)\n\n483.4: “the hand of Sameas:” delayed response or not, Yawn first brought up the subject of Shem at 481.26.\n\n483.4: “Shan – Shim – Schung:” response to “yokohat” oriental strain of 482.11. See note to 483.15-485.7.\n\n483.5: “counterfeit Kevin:” the writing of Shaun/Kevin’s document, it has just been insinuated, is the same as “the hand of Sameas,” Shem, FW’s resident forger/counterfeiter. Alternatively, the suspicion is that Yawn is Shem, counterfeiting Shaun/Yawn/Kevin.\n\n483.7: “reverye:” compare Bloom’s “backward [that is, reverse] eye” in “Calypso.” “Revery” is alternative, usually American, spelling of “reverie.”\n\n483.7: “between me and thee:” i.e. entre nous: scandal (.6) being exchanged between two gossipers\n\n483.7-8: “He would preach to the two turkies and dipdip all the dindians:” Turks, as in Muslim heathens ready for conversion. Also, probable overtone of “darkies,” along with (American) (“dindians”) Indians, also up for conversion, including (“dipdip”/”tauftauf” (3.10)) baptism, which in some versions involves dipping the candidate’s forehead into the font. Problem: as McHugh notes, “dindians” = French dinde, turkey, which traditionally gets eaten during American Thanksgivings, originally celebrated with American Indians, who like the American “darkies” would end up with reason to regret their part in the American enterprise. Joyce enjoyed observing Thanksgiving with his American friends. (Note another holiday, “easter” (.10), coming up.)\n\n483.9: “give gold tidings:” as preacher, he gave them the Gospels, the “good news.”\n\n483.9-10: “tidings…neappearance:” can’t explain the logic, but “neap-” is probably in there because of “tidings”\n\n483.9-10: “bonze age of anteproresurrectionism:” those following false beliefs (taught by bonzes, pagan priests) before the revelation of Christ’s resurrection\n\n483.10-11: “to entrust their easter neappearance to Borsaiolini’s house of hatcraft:” Easter is traditionally a time for displays of fashion – especially of hats (Easter bonnets for women; for Joyce here (see McHugh) a Borsalino). For a spell, the preacher’s preaching seems to have turned into an advertising pitch for a hat shop – probably the “firm” of .11.\n\n483.12: “reasonable hesitancy:” reasonable doubt, as in a trial\n\n483.13: “fourpriest:” a mass officiated by four priests is a special occasion, usually for the funeral of some notable.\n\n483.13: “redmass:” A Red Mass is held annually for members of the legal profession. Fits trial context\n\n483.14: “post:” past. Compare “reverye” of .6.\n\n483.14: “pard!:” old term for panther. (Appears in this sense in Ulysses.) Perhaps relevant that, in bestiaries, the panther symbolizes Jesus\n\n483.15ff: “Fierappel…:” accused of being indistinguishable from his scapegrace brother, Yawn launches into a long self-defense during which among other things he will claim to have taken holy orders. At 487.21 an exasperated Luke will object that “Hood maketh not frere,” that it takes more than a habit to make a monk. Overall, this is certainly one of the most garbled stretches in FW. The word “chink” at 485.16, pejorative for Chinese, is a clue as to why: in “Circe,” lines 957-64, Bloom, under legal assault, launches into a semi-coherent chopsticks-and-chop-suey stage-Chinese monologue (“Li li pool lil chile,” etc.), and throughout FW similar patches signal panicky defensiveness and real or pretended Mongolism. The rhythm is staccato; the syntax is paratactic; the logic, when discernible, is free-associative.\n\n483.15: “Fierappel putting years on me!:” You’re always making me out to be older than I am! Probably a response to the suggestion (.9) that he was around in the Bronze Age. Oxford editors have, instead: “Fierappel! Putting years on me!” “Fierappel”/Fireapeel, as McHugh notes the leopard of the Reynard cycle, is a response “Leap, pard” (.14)!\n\n483.15-6: “This bolt in had be my worder:” would seem to make most sense if the bolt is a (barbed) arrow and “worder” echoes “warder,” in (OED) sense of truncheon or staff of authority. Also, a long shot here: The “redmass” of .13 evokes the (“Redspot” (582.31)) red spot of Jupiter the planet, which in both cases combines with Jupiter the god, here in his characteristic pose of wielding a “bolt” of lightning. Compare 14.19, where the “wordwright from the excelsissimost empyrean” is “bolt, in sum,” the lightning bolt that according to Vico first gave mankind its conception and fear of divinity. Compare 485.25.\n\n483.16-7: “blarneying Marcantonio:” Mercutio, talkative character in Romeo and Juliet. Perhaps, by association, elided with Antonio, the merchant of Venice. “Blarneying:” Blarney Stone, in Munster, home of Mark, the previous speaker, who is now being addressed. Compare first note to .22.\n\n483.17-8: “What cans such wretch to say to I or how have My to doom with him?:” What can such a wretch have to say to me, and what can I have to do with him? Second question is probably from the refrain of Blake’s “To Tirzah,” “Then what have I to do with thee?” based on the resurrected Jesus’s words to his mother. (Stephen alludes to them in Portrait, chapter five.) Also, reverses the sentiment, and perhaps echoes the words, of the popular Anglican hymn beginning “Amazing grace, how sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like me.” In general, versions of “wretch” and “wretched” have been words for Shem.\n\n483.19-20: “hairytop on heeltipper:” recalls father of Book I, whose cap-a-pie (from Hamlet’s father, head-to-foot) appearance is reflected in his antagonist, the cad with the pipe. Again, Shaun and Shem often embody top half and bottom half, head to toe, respectively, of FW’s central male figure. Also, a pint, from the frothy head to the bottom dregs: see next entry.\n\n483.19: “heeltipper:” heeltaps: lees – relating to the fact that Jacob (see McHugh) came second\n\n483.19-20:” unwachsibles:” compare 201.15: “worshipful socks.” Also, unmentionables – underwear. Oxford editors change to “umwachsibles.”\n\n483.20: “ikeson:” icon\n\n483.21: leperd:” response to “Leap, pard!” (.14)\n\n483.21: “ens:” reality. Term introduced by Aquinas. Compare 157.23.\n\n483.21: “fifteen primes:” the fifteenth prime number is 47. “Prime” also means spring.\n\n482.22: “Ya all:” common pronunciation of Youghal, a town in the Munster of Mark, who is being addressed\n\n483.22: “trilustriously:” among other things, trustingly\n\n483.24-5: “did I altermobile him to a flare insiding hogsfat:” the main frame of reference is culinary, but this also seems to have him either burning his brother at the stake (rendered down to fat) or boiling him in oil (also fat). One way of solving the Shem problem. “Alter:” auto, as in auto da fe. (Oxford editors insert “?” after “hogsfat.”)\n\n483.25-6: “Been ike hins kindergardien?:” as McHugh notes, a version of “Am I my brother’s keeper?,” this is a guilty reaction to the interrogator’s questioning whether he acknowledges his saintly brother – e.g. “Now, have you reasonable hesitancy in your mind about him” (.13).\n\n483.25: “kindergardien:” before (“real school” (.22-3)) German Realschule, they were in kindergarten together.\n\n483.26-7: “I am sure offed habitand:” I am sure of inhabiting. Also, embedded “habit” begins Yawn’s claim to be a monk. Compare .31-2: “when I received the habit.” See next entry.\n\n483.27: “meis enfins:” like a man of the cloth, he addresses the others as (McHugh) “my children.”\n\n483.27-8: “the first mover…caused:” First Mover and First Cause are similar or identical terms for God as the beginning of everything.\n\n483.29-30: “ayr, plage and watford:” elements (McHugh) are components of the world, “under[ed] heaven” (.28). (Oxford editors have “underedheaven.”)\n\n483.32: “received the habit:” accepted the order’s garb when received into its community\n\n483.32ff: “I received…” until about 484.10, this simultaneously, erratically, covers a postulant entering a religious order and a young man submitting to anal intercourse. He is “falling” down and “crouched low.” “Embracing a palegrim,” he has “circumcised [his] hairs,” like the Bloom of “Circe” who, in fantasy, was a “nice-looking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be violated” by various males. He has of course undressed, exposing his “culpads,” buttocks, to someone who from “patristic motives” was “entering humble down, dead thrue mean scatological past, making so smell partaking myself.” The two form a beast-with-two-backs “octopuds,” “tumbluponing” together. He is “owning [his] mansuetude,” meekness, “before him,” his “sexth best friend,” who is “delated to back” him. The experience resembles “toppling Humphrey hugging Nephew, old beggelaut.” As elsewhere, the frantic fragmentation signals something he doesn’t want to remember or confess to. Compare note to .35.\n\n483.33-4: “circumcised my hair:” the subject of the predicate “circumcised” is probably (.27-8) “that father,” as cleric, not parent. (Probably: the syntax is about as bollixed as anywhere in FW.) Being tonsured by a superior in the order is a major ritual in the process of becoming ordained. Oxford editors have “circumcissed.”\n\n483.34: “Oh laud:” aside from “Oh Lord,” an allusion to Archbishop Laud, in Anglicanism responsible for the kind of high-church practices under review\n\n483.34: “and removed my clothes from patristic motives:” sounds like protesting too much. Of course he removed his clothes: he had to, in order to put on the habit of a monk. What other motives might there have been? In any event (see next entry), he seems to feel that there is something to feel guilty about.\n\n483.35: “meas minimas culpads:” the standard term is “mea maxima culpa.” “Mea minima culpa” is rare, not part of Catholic ritual, and sometimes used sarcastically. Here, Yawn may be apologizing for the, if anything, small sin of undressing, before donning his new habit (.32). “Culpads” recalls Mulligan in “Scylla and Charybdis,” facetiously advising Stephen to get himself a “breechpad” as protection against buggery. (Cul: French for arse)\n\n484.2: “tumbluponing:” tumbling on or upon: happening upon someone or something, by accident\n\n484.2: “yous octopuds:” as McHugh says, four people with two legs, the four evangelicals being addressed. Also, see note to 483.32ff.\n\n484.4: “prostratingwards:” the initiation ceremony includes prostration.\n\n484.5: “my thrain tropps offering meye eyesalt:” salt tears, falling like rain drops from my eyes (for his sins, apparently in relation to (“eyesalt”) Iseult. Oxford editors have “thraintropps.”\n\n484.5-6: “what I (the person whomin I now am) did not do:” “We have left undone those things which we ought to have done.” Still, having joined the order, he is not that same person anymore.\n\n484.7: “sexth:” next, sex\n\n484.9: “ersed:” as “erst,” archaic English for “formerly”\n\n484.9: “ersed irredent:” an Erse (Irish) irredentist would be someone demanding that Ireland be given back by the British.\n\n484.11-3: “you snub around enclosing your moving motion touching the other catachumens continuing say providing append of signature:” the addressee has been called a beggar (.9). (Given context, it’s probably pertinent that “touch” is Irish slang for having sex.) Here the gist is that, despite his pretended support in the past, he is sneaking and sniffing around “touching” (begging loans from) young men, perhaps offering to sign I.O.U.’s, and forming a party against Yawn on the grounds that Yawn is a stuck-up double-dealer, just pretending to be a real islander. In fact, he will be happy to celebrate Yawn’s deathday. The language has momentarily lapsed (or climbed) into legalese – moving a motion (in “Aeolus,” Lenehan uses the phrase, mock-officiously), “touching” in the sense of related to, etc.\n\n484.14: “dirthdags:” deathday (occurs in “Hades”): the anniversary of someone’s death, perhaps also as the day the body was consigned to the soil, or dirt. Oxford editors have “dirthdies,” adding dying to the mix. Becoming a monk, he both leaves his former life and begins his new life with a new birthday. Also, dearth: monks take a vow of poverty.\n\n484.15: “a mockbelief insulant, ending none meer hyber irish:” a list of contradictions here. Making believe and mocking belief, insolent islander, no more and (McHugh) henceforth, hyper Irish and an Irish hybrid.\n\n484.15-6: “chunk your dimned chink:” “I like your cheek” (here, “damned cheek”) was a common sarcastic rebuke to those aspiring beyond their station.\n\n484.16: “chink:” pejorative term for the Chinese. See next entry.\n\n484.16: “avtokinatown:” Chinatown\n\n484.17-8: “vespian:” thespian: a sarcastic comment on his attacker as “blabber” (.8). Vespasian: i.e. urinal. Either way, an insult\n\n484.18-9: “I’ve my pockets full of you laycreated cardonals:” That is, I own you; I’ve got you all in my pocket. Compare 282.20-3, where Kev, a version of Shaun/Yawn, makes cardinals of his four fingers, fingers which have just been picking pockets. See next entry.\n\n484.19: “laycreated cardonals:” McHugh identifies as “lay cardinals.” A lay cardinal is a layman, someone who has never been a priest, bishop, or any other member of the church hierarchy, given the title of cardinal by the pope. “Honorary cardinal” would seem to be a fair approximation, and cited examples – a Medici, a ten-year old, a political favorite – sound awfully dodgy, something like the equivalent of a knighted beer baron. The best known lay cardinal was the controversial, worldly Cardinal Mazarin. With one anomalous exception, lay cardinals have never been allowed a vote in Vatican Conclave. On the internet, one word that sometimes precedes the expression is “only.” Yawn’s attitude is one of lordly contempt.\n\n484.19: “cardonals:” 1. ordinal numbers, like Shaun’s fingers; 2. cardinal numbers; 3. cardinals. 4. ordinal – an Anglican missal\n\n484.20: “Improperial!:” the Good Friday Improperia (McHugh) are read as the reproachful words of Jesus, as God, to his betrayers. There follows a catalogue of the ungrateful acts of Yawn’s followers.\n\n484.20: “Hekkites:” HCE. (Also, as (McHugh) Hittites, enemies of the Israelites\n\n484.21-2: “I teachet you…the W.X.Y.Z. and P.Q.R.S.:” Saint Patrick brought the alphabet, here the Latin alphabet of the (S.P.Q.R – “P.Q.R.S.”) Romans, to Ireland. The Roman Empire itself never invaded Ireland, and had withdrawn from Britain at or about Patrick’s 432 A.D. arrival.\n\n484.23: “legatine:” papal legates have power over all local church leaders.\n\n484.23-4: “episcoping me altogether:” in rejecting the pope, the Anglican (Episcopal) Church became a church of bishops. (Bishops wear copes.)\n\n484.25: “you have remembered my lapsus langways:” “Circe:” Stephen to Lynch:” “You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty?” Saint Patrick had a never-revealed sin in his past.\n\n484.27-8: “Mind of poison is. That time thing think! Honorific remembrance to spit humble makes:” a literal, word-for-dictionary-word, tone-deaf translation of, in this case, Japanese\n\n484.29: “Aye vouchu to rumanescu:” I venture to remind you.\n\n484.30: “Theophrastius:” Theophrastus followed Aristotle as leader of the Peripatetics (“peregrines” of .29).\n\n484.31: “upper circle:” aside from highest of the cosmic spheres, the theatre seats next above the dress circle\n\n484.32: “Prestopher Palumbus and Porvus Parrio:” combines Noah’s raven and dove with Christopher Columbus, the (translated) Christ-bearing Dove: Old Testament and New Testament paired. With P/K split (see McHugh), “Porvus Parrio” is, approximately, Latin for “Carrion Crow,” in “Circe” Stephen’s term for Catholic priests.\n\n484.33-6: “Ho look at my jailbrand Exquovis and sequencias High marked on me fakesimilar in the foreign by Pappagallus and Pumpusmugnus: ahem! Anglicey: Eggs squawfish lean yoe nun feed marecurious:” certainly confusing, but he seems to be saying that as a prisoner he was branded with an inscription (in a foreign language, Latin: see McHugh) proclaiming that, in effect, he was indelibly depraved, that you wouldn’t be able to make this sow’s ear into a silk purse. (He is of course trying to make the opposite point – at 485.2-3 the inscription, he says, is not only a coat of arms but a king’s coat of arms - and failing as usual.) At times, the branding of prisoners with an initial or initials for the name of their crime has been commonplace. Oxford editors insert a comma after “Ho.”\n\n484.34: “High:” I\n\n484.36: “ahem! Anglicey: Eggs squawfish lean yoe nun feed marecurious:” another botched, literal-minded translation. Oxford editors replace “ahem!” with “aham!” – ham and eggs.\n\n485.2: “morning coat:” article of fashion among gentlemen of the time\n\n485.2: “tripenniferry:” again – see McHugh – a claim to noble, even royal, credentials, but the echo of “three-for-a-penny” undermines it.\n\n485.3. “Sauer:” given .9 below, Tom Sawyer\n\n485.4: “echo stay so!:” I (ego) say so! Again! Repeated in the next line: “Egoname.”\n\n485.4: “eat or not eat body:” issue of the Real Presence in the Eucharist, along with a high church / low church debate over whether the service should include the Eucharist at all\n\n485.5-6: “And, Mind, praisegad, is the first praisonal Egoname Yod heard boissboissy in Moy Bog’s domesday:” again, a claim to noble lineage, along the line of: My ancestors came over with William the Conqueror! My family name is the first listed in William’s Domesday Book! (And, of course, as King Edward VII, his name would lead any tabulation of precedence.) But, inconveniently, the historical fact is that names in the book were those not of the conquerors but the conquered. “Moy Bog” – my bog – shifts the scene to the twice-conquered Irish, and “Egoname” – agnomen: see 30.3 – tells us that his name, whatever it is, is unrelated to his original ancestry.\n\n485.8: “Suck it yourself, sugarstick!:” clearly, a rude response to Yawn’s “Suck at!” (.7), which in turn, besides being (McHugh) St. Patrick’s birth name, was a typically mangled attempt at instructing his inquisitors, in German (“in alleman”), to (Bonheim) Suchet, search for, the (“first praisonal Egoname”) first surname in (“Moy Bog’s domesday”) this book of mine, Work in Progress/Finnegans Wake. (Depending on how you read it, the first such name was either “Eve” (3.1) or “Sir Tristram” (3.4), both of whom will show up during the continuing excavations.) The speaker – Luke - is out of patience with Yawn’s semi-coherent ramblings, and answers that he can just go and suck someone’s “sugarstick” – dick - perhaps, acrobatically, his own. Yawn’s testimony has supplied more than sufficient material (see 483.34, .35, and notes) for suspicions of rampant homosexuality, among other transgressions.\n\n485.9: “sore toe:” in Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer, a “sore toe” is an object of fascination.\n\n485.9-10: “taste your gaspy, hot and sour:” according to Google Books, the name “Hot and Sour Soup” did not make its way into English-language publications until the 1970’s. (Still, the dish itself had been around long before then, and there are a number of oriental allusions in the vicinity.) Less agreeably, part of a debased communion. Compare Bloom at his lowest, reduced to a drudge and ordered by Bella/Bello Cohen to “Drink me piping hot” from one of her “pisspots.”\n\n485.9-10: “gaspy:” “gasper:” Edwardian slang for a high-tar cigarette. In Tom Sawyer, a character takes “two gasps” from a cigar. Also, response to “Gaspey” of .3. In context\n\n485.10: “sour:” in the original transition publication, followed by “Bo ba bi bo bum!” Neither McHugh nor the Oxford editors include it as a variant; the James Joyce Digital Archive does. (As elsewhere, your annotator is noncommittal on genetic issues.) In any case, compare 251.18: “A bimbamb bum!” In A Wake Newslitter, Luigi Schenoni glosses this as “an Italian count out in children’s games.” Games or not, the context here is definitely childish, not to say bratty - specifically, the children (see .3 and .9 and notes) Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.\n\n485.10: “Ichthyan:” response to “Itch dean” (.4). Also as “Ichtian,” a sarcastic comment on his pretensions to Godhood, by way of Jesus as Ichthos. Also, see second entry for .13.\n\n485.10: “Gags be plebsed!:” a sarcastically distorted response to Yawn’s “praisegad” (.5) – God be praised!. Also, equal-oppositely, God as pleb, plebian\n\n485.11: “between his voyous and her consinnantes:” a courtship exchange between a man and a woman. He: “Voyez-vous?” She consents, and sins. Note: reverses usual FW – in fact, Joycean – convention that consonants are male and vowels female, perhaps as commentary on Yawn’s garbled account of his origins.\n\n485.11-2: “Thugg, Dirke and Hacker with Rose Lankester and Blanche Yorke!:” more mockery of Yawn’s mixed-up claims to blue-blood ancestry. Were your forebears Anglo-Saxons or Normans, run-of-the-mill Tom, Dick, and Harry or the noble dynasts of the War of the Roses, a bunch of common cutthroats (see next entry) or their high-toned - though to be sure equally murderous - betters? The combination of two females and three armed men recalls Book I’s scandal in the park – always a sin of the father, who will be mentioned at .17 as “old fellow,” Irish term for father, and as (“Hell’s Confucium and the Elements!”) HCE at .35.\n\n485.11: “Dirke:” dirk: a ruffian’s (“Thugg”’s) weapon, along with another’s “hacker,” a sword or axe\n\n485.13: “Oy soy:” as McHugh notes, a stage-English accent for “I say.” May be a sarcastic response to Yawn’s royal pretensions (.2-3). See next entry.\n\n485.13: “are you sprakin sea Djoytsch?:” as (McHugh) are you speaking German?, another sarcastic response, this one to Yawn’s German “Itch dean” (.2-3). (Again, see McHugh.) Up until 1914, fluency in German signified culture – or, when affected, pretentiousness. After then, it would have been a source of embarrassment that King Edward VII’s motto of “Ich dien” (.3) testified to the royal family’s Germanic origins, enough that in 1917 its name was changed to (“Windsewer” (420.24)) Windsor. (Joyce makes sardonic use of this fact in “Cyclops,” which includes foreshadowings of the Great War, fought for king and country.) Here, an item in the accusations or suspicions leveled at Yawn\n\n485.13: “Bleseyblasey:” as McHugh notes, yet another response, here to “boissboissy” (.6). Given context, probably also (sarcastic) blasé.\n\n485.17: “thruppenny croucher:” response to “tripenniferry cresta” (.2), this time with the latent “three-penny” foregrounded. (As in The Threepenny Opera (as McHugh Notes, Polly Peachum, from that play and its successor, The Beggar’s Opera, appears at .20), the word connotes poverty, shabbiness.) A “croucher” is an abject forelock-tugger, someone forever kowtowing to authority figures – like a “twicer” (.24), a cringing low-life. Luke is countering Yawn’s “upper circle” pretensions (484.31) with a catalogue of his disreputable ancestors.\n\n485.17: “old fellow:” again, a common Irish term for father\n\n485.20: “Fat prize the bonafide peachumpidgeonlover:” What price the [noun]: indicates that something has been obtained at too high a price. (“Fat” rubs it in.) In both The Beggar’s Opera and The Threepenny Opera, Macheath’s marriage to Polly Peachum earns him a sentence to be hanged. (Can’t see how it fits, but a pigeon-lover is, usually, a fan of pigeon-racing. The “hohallo!” of .22 sounds a falconer’s call to his falcon – see “Circe,” Hamlet. ) Perhaps also a reference to the Peaches – Daddy Browning scandal of 64.22-65.23.\n\n485.20-2: “eh, eh, eh,…I’ve Ivy…hohallo:” again (see .17 and note), the forebear being recalled here is the father, HCE, with his stutter, here making a phone call. (His signature is a capital E.) Perhaps a disreputable figure, certainly a clownish one; compare, in “Hades,” Bloom’s idea of a recording left by a deceased relative for family to remember him by: “Hellohellohello.”\n\n485.23: “his boost friend:” response to 474.7-8: “my sexth best friend.” In American slang, a “booster” is a congenital optimist or promoter of some cause – here, a friend who sees only his best points.\n\n485.23-4: “be shanghaied to him?:” be hanged to him – common expression of dismissal\n\n485.24: “swaaber:” a swabber (or swab, or swabby): a lowly sailor, one who swabs the deck. Goes with “shanghaied” (.23-4) – to be captured on shore and forced into shipboard labor, probably of the most menial kind\n\n485.24: “twicer:” crook\n\n485.24-5: “twicer, trifoaled in Wanstable!:” foaled (born) in a stable – a play on Wellington’s sardonic remark (apocryphal: see 10.17-18 and note) that having been born in Ireland didn’t make him Irish any more than having been born in a stable would have made him a horse; compare “Willingdone, bornstable ghentleman” (10.17-8). Other notes add a touch of blasphemy: Jesus, the (“tri…Wan”) three-in-one God emblematized in Saint Patrick’s (“trifoaled”) trefoil/shamrock, was born in a barn, among farm animals; accordingly the two-three-one count probably refers to the Trinity.\n\n485.25: “Loud’s curse:” compare 259.3 and 259.7, where “Loud” is the Lord, expressing himself loudly. According to Vico, humanity’s conception of God began with the sound of thunder.\n\n485.26: “lubberintly:” labyrinthily – the labyrinth of the (“innereer’d” (.27)) inner ear. Also, by contrast with “swaaber,” a (land)-lubber. In general, “lubberly” behavior is clumsy, third-rate.\n\n485.26: “nightmale:” nightmare, night mail (train), night males. For the third, compare 461.24-8, where Issy’s erotic nighttime extends from “the night’s foreign males” to sunup.\n\n485.27: “drums and bones and hums in drones:” along with the labyrinth, the equipment and workings of the inner ear. As elsewhere in FW (see, e.g., 23.25-7 and note), the ear, with its “drums,” makes sounds as well as receiving them. (Categorically, all sensations in Joyce are interactive, projections as well as receptions.)\n\n485.28: “Tsing tsing!:” Given “hung,” “twicer,” and the general tone, perhaps Sing Sing – familiar name for Ossining Prison, which practiced executions - before the 1891 introduction of the electric chair, by hanging\n\n485.29: “Me no angly mo, me speakee Yellman’s lingas:” I’ll stop (trying to) speak English and speak Chinese (of the yellow man) instead.\n\n485.29: “Yellman’s:” yelling man: response to Luke’s complaint about loud noises (.25-8)\n\n485.30: “Me no pigey ludiments:” he won’t speak pidgin anymore. (But then, in the next line, “Me pigey…”) Combines with overtone of “Me no spikka,” conventional tag for foreigners saying they don’t speak, usually (“angly” (.29)) English. “Ludiments” for rudiments is more stage-Chinese.\n\n485.31: “fella:” response to “old fellow” (.17)\n\n485.31: “savvy:” slang for understand\n\n485.33: “Lukie Walkie:” as Adaline Glasheen notes, all four of the inquisitors are called Walker at some point. The four old men are walkers: on their introduction, arriving on foot, they “hopped it up the mountainy molehill” (474.22).\n\n485.33-4: \"cowbelly maam belgame:\" Digger Dialects: \"belly belong me he think\" is Papuan pidgin English for \"I am of opinion that...but can give no solid reasons.\"\n\n485.34: “boohoomeo:” boo-hoo – the sound of infantile crying; will be remembered as “sob story” (486.1).\n\n485.35: “moohootch:” response to “cowbelly” (.33) and “boohoomeo” (.34)\n\n485.36-486.1: “ponnippers!:” Nip(s): slang for Japanese; nippers: slang for children\n\n486.6-7: “toone…vowelglide:” “toone,” pronounced as “two-one,” is probably the example here of a vowel-glide.\n\n486.7: “hattrick:” response to “cawthrick” (.2)\n\n486.8: “dragoman:” Yawn as interpreter and intermediary between questioners and the lower depths\n\n486.9: “Mere man’s mime: God has jest:” Oxford editors have “Mere man is mime: God is jest.” In Pope’s “Essay on Man,” man is “the glory, jest, and riddle of the world.”\n\n486.11: “chink:” slang for Chinese. See next entry.\n\n486.12: “jape:” Jap: slang for Japanese. Perhaps also, paralleling “chink,” gap.\n\n486.12-3: “little fellow in my eye:” etymologically, “pupil” derives from pupilla, the pupil of the eye; a pupula is a little boy. (Probable connection – see two previous entries – with Orientals-as-diminutive.) The subject is seeing his own miniature reflection in a hypnotist’s eye – as in Donne's “The Good-Morrow.”\n\n486.14: “poor armer in slingslang:” arm in sling. Perhaps also an overtone of Port Arthur, Manchuria, site of both a massacre in the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, and of the Japanese defeat of the Russian fleet in 1904.\n\n486.14: “slingslang:” singsong\n\n486.14-33: “Now…fading:” incorporates elements of Masonic initiation: “temple,” T-square, placing of compass point to breast and asking, “Do you feel anything?”\n\n486.14: “Tuttu:” Italian tutti: everything\n\n486.15: “burial jade:” jade ornaments excavated from tombs. Jade in particular because of oriental context\n\n486.15: “to your temple:” hand to temple was a common stage mentalist’s gesture.\n\n486.17-9: “- I see a blackfrinch pliestrycook…who is carrying on his brainpan…a cathedral of lovejelly for his…Tiens, how he is like somebodies!:” (Ellipses in original.) Upright prompts image of vertical line crossed on top by horizontal line at 90˚ angle: a man with a platter on his head. “Blackfrinch” sounds like backfrisch, slang for a teenage girl. (I don’t see how that fits in here; it may possibly be anticipating the Issy apparition of the next response.) “Cathedral,” like “Templar,” is probably cued by “temple” (.15). In any case, it goes with The French cast of this passage, which as McHugh says can reflect Tristan’s French influence. Standard tokens of Frenchiness follow: cuisine (pastrycook”), love-making (“lovejelly”) – the man with the platter on his head is carrying sweets to his sweetheart. “Brainpan” and “somebodies” may signal the French equivalent of Franglais.\n\n486.17: “pliestrycook:” French plié can mean either twisted or two-fold. Here, the latter seems likelier: the vision is of a plural “somebodies”(.19).\n\n486.21: “I horizont the same, this serpe with ramshead:” that is, he is moving the T shape from vertical to horizontal, thus giving it the outline of a sideways line with horns projecting perpendicularly, upward and downward, from one end. Note: Oxford editors have “same” being followed by a figure resembling facing the opposite direction.\n\n486.23-5: “ - I feel a fine lady…floating on a stillstream of isisglass…with gold hair to the bed…and white arms to the twinklers…O la la!” (Again, ellipses in original.) shape (or – see previous – other way around) translates into vision of lady (Iseult) lying horizontal on her bed, her head over the edge, with her long hair falling downward and her arms reaching upward. Labials of “lip a little…liplove” provide sound effects for conjuration of “stillstream.” (Also, speaking of streams, at 327.14, Issy’s truckle bed is a “trickle bed.” If ALP is a river, her daughter is a rivulet.) Isinglass is semitransparent and was sometimes used for windows, hence stream-like; as a jelly made from fish, it is probably prompted here by “lovejelly” (18). “Twinklers” are stars, perhaps (like the ones Molly Bloom sees/imagines in “Penelope”), decorations in the ceiling wallpaper. “O la la!” continues the cartoon-French thread. First words echo “To see a fine lady upon a white horse.” The two upstretching arms are Issy’s II (sometimes i i) signature.\n\n486.27: “I invert the initial of your tripartite:” the initial of Patrick’s Tripartite Life is \"T;\" inverted, it becomes the shape of a T, upside down: see next entry. Note again (see note to .21): Oxford editors have and upside-down T following “initial.”\n\n486.28: “on your breast:” in placing the inverted T-shape to Yawn’s breast, the interrogator enacts a physician applying a stethoscope, listening for the patient’s heartbeat. (Early stethoscopes, in use into the 20th century, terminated in a large flat disc, positioned perpendicular to the tube.)\n\n486.30: “I ahear of a hopper behind the door slappin his feet in a pool of bran:” Mental image, from : a cartoon rabbit (“hopper”), its big feet stuck out right and left, its long ears sticking straight up. I suggest that the wet “slappin” sound he hears is of the love-making of Tristram and Iseult, who were brought together in the last two sequences, listened to from behind their door. (The liquid sounds of .22 seem to be still around. In \"Cice,\" the sounds approximate \"liplapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.\") “Slappin” includes lapin, French for rabbit, and rabbits are and were proverbial for incessant sex. In retrospect, stage one was the man’s arrival, stage two was his getting horizontal, stage three penetration; “love jelly” signified sexual secretions, both his and hers, whose mingling produces “slappin” sound. “Pool of bran” is a delayed response to “brainpan” (.18); maybe - long shot - the pastrycook could also, as a regular baker, turn out baked (bran) bread. Pronounced metrics (four anapests, probable line break, two dactyls, ending, I think, in a cretic) surely convey the sound of the heart’s beating; iambs are proverbially the normal rhythm for the heart (lub-dub), but, given the circumstances, Yawn’s heart would be racing. At this point, the three Q & A’s have followed the custom in some churches of crossing forehead, lips, and breastbone in sequence while promising to obey God with thoughts, words, and heart. Also, there seems to be a certain admixture of Freemasonry (see .14-33 and note): in Masonic initiation ceremonies a compass point is pressed against the candidate’s naked left breast and he is asked, “Do you feel anything?;” the geometric square (though not T square) is a central Masonic symbol; Knights Templars are a branch of Freemasonry sworn to Christianity.\n\n486.34: “irmages:” “ir” prefix means “irregular”\n\n​\n\n487.1: “iberborealic:” hyperbolic. Also, Irish ("
