The endothelium that lines the inner wall of the blood vessels plays a critical role in the pathobiology of these illnesses. Particularly after ischemia or injury, the growth of new blood vessels, driven by endothelial expansion, is essential to maintain oxygen supply to the ischemic or injured tissue. Recent studies additionally suggest that the endothelium acts as a paracrine source for signals that determine tissue regeneration versus fibrosis after injury. Excessive vascularization, however, might also be unwanted, as in the case of cancer, neovascular eye diseases including diabetic retinopathy, atheroma growth, or the expansion of vasa vasorum, which leads to adverse vessel wall remodeling.\n\nNeovascularization is a tightly regulated and essential process that results in the formation of new blood vessels. Specific types of neovascularization include angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries from existing capillaries, and arteriogenesis, the formation of new arteries from preexisting collaterals or de novo. Although endothelial cells (ECs) certainly are essential for both processes, the formation of functionally active vessels requires a complex molecular cross-talk of ECs with perivascular cells such as pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages. Simple in vitro models are best suited to examine specific aspects of particular processes involved in angiogenesis such as the biochemical interactions that regulate EC proliferation, motility, and apoptosis or lumen formation. However, in vivo models are required to understand the complex cellular interactions that enable the generation of functionally active and hierarchical blood vessel networks capable of providing an appropriate blood supply and paracrine stimuli to organs. In addition, the development of therapeutic strategies to either promote or inhibit vessel growth depends on reproducible measures and end points in experimental models that are relevant for the treatment of human diseases. Accordingly, the selection of an appropriate experimental model is critical to study specific aspects of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that are of physiological or pathological relevance. This scientific statement summarizes in vitro assays and in vivo models suitable for gaining insights into the basic mechanisms of vessel growth and provides an overview of models that are particularly useful for clinical translation.\n\n1. In Vitro Assays\n\nConsiderable progress has been made over the past 20 years in the development of in vitro strategies to investigate the complex processes of vascular morphogenesis and maturation events in 3-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrixes1,2 ( ). Most studies have used primary human ECs, in particular human umbilical vein ECs,3-5 because they are easily available. Other studies have used the aortic ring assay from rat or mouse to study these processes.6 Two major extracellular matrix environments that work well in these assays are 3D type I collagen and fibrin matrixes. Both types of matrixes are highly effective in inducing EC tube formation and sprouting and allow EC-pericyte interactions in models of vessel maturation, which occur in a 3D matrix environment.4,7\n\nTable 1.\n\nProCon3D collagen or fibrin EC lumen formation and sprouting assaysVery reproducibleEC only conditions without mural cellsAllows the study of EC tube formation and sprouting in physiologically relevant 3D matrix environmentsThus far, isolated rodent ECs have not worked well in these assay modelsCan be reproducibly performed under serum-free conditions with defined recombinant growth factorsVariable growth conditions for ECs may affect results with these modelsCan be performed with various human ECs (eg, HUVECs) that can be genetically manipulatedEC tubes that are formed can be subjected to flow forcesEC-pericyte coculture assays in 3D collagen or fibrin matrixesAllows the study of EC tubulogenesis and sprouting and the contribution of mural cells to these eventsCan be difficult to establish; functionality depends on appropriate conditionsAllows the study of ECM remodeling, including basement membrane matrix assembly around developing EC tubesPotential variability concerning the sources of pericytes used for the assay systemsCan be performed under serum-free defined conditions and functionally define ECs vs pericytesEC spheroid assayVery reproducibleNo mural cell contributionAngiogenic sprouting can be investigatedAortic ring assayVery reproducibleVariability requires sufficiently high numbersAllows the study of the angiogenic effects of genes in genetic models ex vivoCellular contributions (eg, ECs, various mural cells, macrophages) may varyMatrigel assayVery reproducibleIs not a specific angiogenesis assay (other cells can also form cordlike networks)Can provide insight into EC survival and signaling activityNo tubulogenesis\n\nMany studies have also been performed by seeding ECs 2-dimensionally on the surface of Matrigel, a laminin-rich matrix,8 which enables ECs to rearrange into cordlike, lumenless structures.9 However, there is actually little evidence that this assay system provides a suitable in vitro representation of the process of vascular morphogenesis. In fact, many cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and tumor cells, form similar cordlike structures on Matrigel surfaces, suggesting that this alignment assay may reflect a competitive cell-cell versus cell-matrix adhesion assay.9 Laminin-rich matrixes have been shown to inhibit tubulogenesis through integrin-laminin interactions.10 Together, 3D collagen and fibrin models have been demonstrated to be superior for investigations of vascular tubulogenesis, sprouting, and EC-pericyte tube coassembly and maturation events, including vascular basement membrane matrix formation.\n\n1.1. EC Tubulogenesis Models\n\nA fundamental property of ECs is their ability to form tubes with lumen structures in 3D matrixes (ie, a property of arterial, capillary, venous, and lymphatic ECs).1 Any cell type that is reported to be an EC (including cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells or other stem/progenitor cells that have differentiated toward the EC lineage) should be able to form tubes in a 3D matrix environment in vitro. We propose that without such functional characterization, a cell type should not be classified as an EC even if it expresses EC markers.\n\nSeveral model systems have been established over many years to elucidate fundamental mechanisms underlying how ECs assemble into tube structures with defined lumens in 3D collagen or fibrin matrixes.3,4 In the most basic setup, ECs are seeded into a 3D matrix and align over time to form lumenized tubes. Tube formation has been demonstrated by cross sections of cultures and with the use of techniques such as thin sectioning of plastic embedded gels, confocal microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Importantly, one consequence of EC tubulogenesis is the creation of physical tunnel spaces in the extracellular matrix, called vascular guidance tunnels, that are generated through highly localized MT1-matrix metalloproteinase–dependent matrix degradation.11,12 These tunnel spaces represent matrix conduits for EC motility, tube remodeling, and recruitment of mural cells to the abluminal surface of developing vessels to enable processes such as vessel remodeling and vascular basement membrane matrix assembly.13\n\nIn vitro models have been used as a primary discovery tool to identify critical regulators of the EC lumen and tube formation pathway, which were later confirmed with in vivo models. They have also have been extensively used to confirm in vivo findings that have been obtained through mouse knockout or zebrafish morpholino experiments. One point that should be emphasized is that in vitro morphogenesis models with isolated ECs have used human ECs; thus, if differences arise with an in vivo model system, it is always possible that this discordance may reflect a species difference in the molecular requirements for vascular morphogenic events.\n\nTo date, it has been very difficult to successfully use isolated primary mouse or rat ECs in tube morphogenic assays in 3D collagen or fibrin matrixes. The reason for this discrepancy between human and rodent ECs is unclear. However, primary human ECs work extremely well in vascular tube morphogenesis and sprouting assays in 3D matrixes.\n\nAs a general rule, in vitro vascular morphogenesis assays should be performed under highly defined conditions. Ideally, the assay systems should be performed in serum-free defined media in 3D matrixes so that the additives are known, and this has been accomplished with the use of a number of in vitro models using human ECs and the aortic ring assay. In this manner, the actual growth factor, lipid, hormone, and so on, requirements for the various steps and events during vascular morphogenesis can be accurately assessed.\n\n1.2. Sprouting Models\n\nIn contrast to 3D alignment assays, the process of sprouting angiogenesis can be studied in vitro by allowing ECs to form sprouting and lumen-forming capillary-like structures by seeding them from focal starting points into a collagen or fibrin matrix. A common strategy to focally seed ECs into a matrix is to coat beads with ECs and then embed these EC-coated beads into a 3D matrix.14 Alternatively, ECs can be allowed to form 3D spheroidal aggregates that can similarly be delivered as focal starting points into a 3D matrix.5 Spheroidal aggregates of human ECs have also been transplanted in a 3D matrix into immunocompromised mice to generate a 3D capillary network that anastomoses with the mouse vasculature and is perfused by mouse blood.15,16 Sprouting angiogenesis can be demonstrated and qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed effectively in vitro and in vivo in these assays.\n\nSprouting angiogenesis has also been studied by allowing ECs seeded as monolayers on top of a matrix to invade into the matrix, which allows them to form lumenized structures.17,18 Such 2-dimensional/3D hybrid assays have been established as 3D sprouting angiogenesis assays. They can be considered an appropriate representation of 3D sprouting angiogenesis. However, the proteolytic balance between matrix-degrading and matrix-invading forces needs to be carefully controlled.\n\nThe aortic ring assay system is another widely used 3D sprouting angiogenesis assay.6 This assay has some advantages in that animal tissues from normal versus genetically modified vessels can be directly assessed in an ex vivo assay. In turn, the multicellular nature of this assay can complicate the interpretation of results. The aortic ring assay has also been modified to study the sprouting of lymphatic ECs from explanted thoracic duct segments.19\n\nA murine allantois assay system that is useful for investigating early vasculogenic tube assembly has also been described, although no exogenous extracellular matrix is used in this approach.20\n\n1.3. Microfluidic Flow Models\n\nA recent advance has been the development of microfluidic models of vascular morphogenesis whereby flow forces can be applied during the morphogenic event. To date, this has been performed primarily with sprouting models in which flow is applied to 1 monolayer surface and then the tube networks connect with 2 sides of the microfluidic device (containing flow channels).21 Directional flow ensues through the tubes that connect the flow channels. Other variations of such models have been to create tube channels artificially in 3D matrixes to enable user-defined geometries of the vascular network and then seed the channels with ECs for the creation of tube networks in the absence of EC-driven tubulogenesis and vascular guidance tunnel formation.22,23 Of note, these systems have so far not been tested by many laboratories, and the robustness and practicability at a larger scale remain to be established.\n\n1.4. EC-Pericyte Tube Maturation Models\n\nSeveral EC-pericyte coculture models in 3D matrixes have been established during the past 10 years. Such assays have highlighted the functional importance of both ECs and pericytes during capillary tube assembly in vitro.7,12,13,24 A major function of ECs is to establish networks of tubes that reside within vascular guidance tunnels and that induce the recruitment of pericytes into tunnel spaces along the abluminal tube surface.7 Both ECs and pericytes are highly motile during these events, and once pericytes reach the abluminal surface, they migrate along these surfaces in a polarized manner. Pericyte recruitment increases the length and decreases the diameter of EC tubes, which correlates with the deposition of vascular basement membrane matrix. Both cell types contribute basement membrane components, and both ECs and pericytes are necessary to generate basement membrane matrixes under defined serum-free conditions in 3D matrixes (demonstrated with transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy). Such systems enable a detailed analysis of EC tube maturation events and can assess the role of the key growth factors and signaling pathways that are necessary for these processes.\n\n1.5. Summary\n\nOverall, in vitro models of vascular morphogenesis and maturation have contributed greatly to our understanding of these events, and sprouting angiogenesis can be well studied by the established highly reproducible assays. The use of 3D coculture assays additionally allows investigators to gain insights into vessel maturation processes and to study EC-pericyte interactions. The development of 3D coculture models that include flow would allow the study of microcirculatory networks and vessel maintenance at least for some days. Clearly, these models should be used in conjunction with in vivo approaches and hybrid strategies in which ECs are manipulated in vitro and then introduced in vivo to interface with a host vasculature. This is essential because even the best in vitro model will not fully recapitulate the complex process of vessel growth under physiological or pathophysiological conditions. Furthermore, in vitro models cannot assess the impact of circulating humoral and cellular factors that interact with the endothelium and that could have major impact, particularly under disease conditions such as diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or heart failure, which systemically affect tissue homeostasis.\n\n2. Developmental Angiogenesis and Arteriogenesis\n\nIn all vertebrate species, blood vessels form during embryogenesis in successive steps called vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, which are then followed by remodeling and maturation of the initial vascular plexus into adult vasculature.25 The term vasculogenesis describes the de novo specification of endothelial precursor cells or angioblasts from the mesoderm. These newly formed cells coalesce into lumenized tubes that form the primary vascular plexus, which consists of a meshwork of homogeneously sized capillaries and the central axial vessels (ie, the dorsal aorta [DA] and cardinal veins). With the onset of heartbeat, this early vascular circuit expands and remodels, undergoing proliferation, sprouting, and pruning of preexisting vessels. This process of vascular remodeling transforms simple circulatory loops into a complex hierarchical network of branched endothelial tubes of varying diameter, length, and identity and depends on both genetically hard-wired events and hemodynamic forces (reviewed elsewhere26).\n\nA large number of signaling pathways regulate vascular development (reviewed by Potente et al27). Because a properly formed cardiovascular system is essential for sustaining embryonic development, mutations in these pathways frequently cause phenotypes that result in embryonic lethality. Global deletion in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Delta/Notch, integrin, transforming growth factor-ß, ephrin/Eph, and angiopoietin/Tie signaling pathways (among others) impairs vascular development, causing lethality in the mouse embryo between embryonic day (E) 8.0 and E12.5 attributable to failure to establish a functional circulatory network. These studies have been instrumental in our understanding of pathways required for vasculogenesis, endothelial tube assembly and lumen formation, angiogenesis, and arteriovenous differentiation. In the following sections, we present currently available models in mice and other species. Because vascular phenotypes are often complex and we still have an incomplete understanding of the normal sequence of vascular remodeling events, delineating the primary defect caused by a specific gene manipulation may require the combinatorial use of >1 model system.\n\n2.1. The Mouse Embryonic Hindbrain and Postnatal Retina as Model Systems to Study Developmental Angiogenesis\n\nThe developing mouse constitutes a model of choice to analyze vascular development and consequences of genetic manipulations on this process. Angioblasts in the mouse embryo first emerge from the mesoderm as VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 2+ cells around E7.0 and assemble into a simple circulatory loop consisting of a heart, DA, yolk sac plexus, and sinus venosus by E8.0.\n\nSeveral methodological improvements have allowed better understanding of early embryonic vascular development in the mouse. These include an expanded array of vascular markers and improved imaging techniques such as confocal imaging, optical projection tomography, and ultramicroscopy to visualize vascular networks in intact embryos with far greater degrees of resolution and 3D context compared with histological sections.28,29 In addition, the culture of allantois, an extraembryonic appendage rich in blood vessels that develops from E6 onward in the mouse, can be used for live imaging of vascular network formation in explanted wild-type and mutant tissue and allows additional manipulations such as phenotypic rescue experiments (reviewed by Arora and Papaioannou30).\n\nThe most crucial technical innovation in recent years has been the generation of temporally inducible, endothelium-specific Cre alleles that can switch conditional null (floxed) target genes off during any required developmental time window, thus circumventing the early embryonic lethality seen with global knockout mice that impairs cardiovascular development (eg, Benedito et al31; ). Likewise, refined inducible overexpression systems can be used to switch genes on at any defined time point during embryonic and postnatal development in the mouse (eg, Wang et al47; ). Combined with novel in vivo models of central nervous system angiogenesis, discussed below, these methods have considerably refined our capacity to decipher molecular mechanisms governing vascular development and to understand the activities of pathways required for vascular development, which are not limited to early embryonic development but extend to organogenesis, maintenance of adult vascular homeostasis, and pathological angiogenesis.\n\nTable 2.\n\nMouse LineDescription of Mouse LineReferenceEC-specific constitutive Cre-deleter mouse lines Tie1-CreThe Tie1 gene promoter drives Cre expression in these transgenic mice in most embryonic ECs from E8-9 onward but not in all ECs in adult vasculature.

GFP is expressed in the ECs in embryos but is downregulated in the adult vasculature.46\n\nThe vertebrate central nervous system is made up of brain, spinal cord, and retina. All 3 organs are vascularized during embryonic and early postnatal development to provide oxygen and nutrients to both neuronal progenitors and the metabolically highly active and terminally differentiated neurons that relay information. Both brain and spinal cord acquire a vascular network before birth, although the complexity of this network increases after birth for some time. In contrast, the retina is initially supplied by the extraretinal choroidal vasculature and hyaloid arteries. Although the choroidal vasculature persists into adulthood, the hyaloid arteries are replaced during postnatal development with an intraretinal vascular system that is known as the retinal vasculature. Brain, spinal cord, and retinal vasculature all form through angiogenesis (reviewed by Ruhrberg and Bautch48). Because of the stereotypic nature of vessel sprouting in all 3 organs, they are extremely well suited to identify even subtle changes caused by the perturbation of environmental or genetic factors that regulate angiogenesis. This section summarizes the advantages and limitations of the mouse embryo hindbrain and postnatal retina as model systems to study physiological angiogenesis and introduces the perinatal retina as an additional model to identify factors that modulate pathological neovascularization. Importantly, all 3 experimental models have been described with much detail in recent publications and are therefore easily applied and suited to standardization of angiogenesis research between different investigators.37,49,50\n\n2.1.1. Brief Description of Hindbrain Vascularization\n\nThe mouse hindbrain is vascularized before birth.48 The vascularization of the mouse embryonic hindbrain begins about E9.5, when vessels sprout into the hindbrain from a perineural vascular plexus. These first hindbrain vessels grow perpendicular to the hindbrain surface toward the ventricular zone (radial vessels) but then change direction to sprout parallel to the ventricular hindbrain surface and anastomose with each other (subventricular vascular plexus; ). As the hindbrain tissue thickens as a result of the addition of neurons and the formation of glia, sprouting and fusion move to deeper brain layers.\n\n2.1.1.1. Advantages of the Hindbrain Model to Study Sprouting Angiogenesis\n\nPermits the spatiotemporal analysis of organ vascularization in normal mice and in mouse strains with genetic mutations that compromise viability or result in postmidgestation embryonic lethality; when combined with inducible Cre-LoxP technology, can be extended to the analysis of mouse strains with premidgestation lethality.\n\nRobust method for whole-mount labeling of ECs and interacting cell types that can be combined with high-resolution imaging for reliable quantification of angiogenic sprouting, network density, and vessel caliber ECs.\n\nEnables the analysis of blood vessel growth within a natural but relatively simple multicellular microenvironment where ECs interact with non-ECs to refine the 3D organ architecture (fewer cell types compared with retinal angiogenesis, ie, neural progenitors, differentiating neurons, and microglia precursors but not glia, complex neural networks, or inflammatory cells).\n\n2.1.2. Retinal Vascularization\n\nThe mouse retina is vascularized only after birth.38,51 The formation of the retinal vasculature begins on the day of birth, when vessels emerge from the optic nerve head, sprout perpendicularly over the surface of the retina on a network of astrocytes, and begin to anastomose ( ). While sprouting continues, in particular at the vascular front, vessels in the rear begin to remodel and form arteries and veins ( ). Pericytes are recruited at the vascular front, and smooth muscle cell maturation begins around arteries and veins. Therefore, multiple aspects of vascular development can be examined in a single 2-dimensional preparation. The formation of the primary vascular plexus is complete by about postnatal day 9, and the resulting vasculature remodels and matures for at least another 10 days. At postnatal day 9, vessels also begin to sprout from the primary retinal vessel plexus at nearly right angles into the inner retina to form first a deep vascular plexus followed by formation of an intermediate vascular plexus. This process is driven primarily by hypoxia/VEGF and is dependent on Notch signaling.\n\n2.1.2.1. Advantages of the Retina Model to Study Sprouting Angiogenesis\n\nPermits the spatiotemporal analysis of organ vascularization in normal mice and in mouse strains with genetic mutations that are viable or live through the postnatal period until weaning; when combined with inducible Cre-LoxP technology, can be extended to the analysis of mouse strains with embryonic or early postnatal lethality.\n\nRobust method for whole-mount labeling of ECs and interacting cell types that can be combined with high-resolution imaging; enables reliable quantification of vascular migration and angiogenic sprouting; less suitable to quantify network density and vessel caliber because of temporal overlap in sprouting and vascular remodeling.\n\nAllows monitoring of angiogenesis alongside vascular remodeling in the same preparation, including visualization of vessel pruning and arteriovenous differentiation (advantage over hindbrain model).\n\nPermits the analysis of blood vessel growth within a natural multicellular microenvironment in which ECs interact with non-ECs to refine the 3D organ architecture; however, tissue interactions can be complex, with several types of neurons and glia, resident microglia, and recruited immune cells contributing to the process of vascularization.\n\nModel to study vascular pathology: oxygen-induced retinopathy.\n\n2.1.3. Considerations When Choosing the Hindbrain Versus Retina to Study Physiological Angiogenesis\n\n2.1.3.1. Developmental Stage\n\nThe mouse hindbrain can be used at earlier developmental stages than other angiogenesis models. For example, the mouse retina is suitable to analyze angiogenesis in the first 2 weeks after birth, whereas the neural tube is one of the earliest organs to develop and is vascularized earlier than kidneys, heart, or lung. As a result of its vascularization early in development, the hindbrain model is suitable for studying mouse mutants that survive the period of vasculogenesis but are lethal after E12.5 unless an inducible Cre-LoxP system is used.\n\n2.1.3.2. Experimental Manipulation\n\nAn advantage of the retina is accessibility to experimental manipulation, for example, by local (intravitreal) or systemic (intraperitoneal) injection of growth factors or function-blocking reagents to examine their impact on retinal vascularization. Although vessel networks rapidly degenerate in organotypic culture, a retinal explant method suitable for short-term live imaging or ex vivo pharmacological manipulation has been described.52\n\n2.1.3.3. Immunolabeling\n\nThe increasing thickness of the mouse hindbrain from E13.5 on inhibits the penetration of antibodies into the deeper tissue parts, and changes in organ shape prevent flat mounting for whole-mount imaging. Therefore, the hindbrain vasculature at later developmental or postnatal stages is best visualized in immunolabeled tissue sections. In contrast, even the adult retinal vasculature of the mouse is easily labeled in wholemount preparations.\n\n2.1.3.4. Physiology Versus Pathology\n\nBecause of its postnatal development, the development of the retinal vasculature is more easily affected by environmental influences than the hindbrain vasculature, which develops in utero. In particular, the influence of oxygen tension on vascular development is readily studied in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, which is discussed below.\n\n2.1.4. Brief Description of Pathological Retinal Vascularization\n\nPathological retinal neovascularization has been studied extensively in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy in which neonatal mice are sequentially exposed to hyperoxia and then normal air. In these circumstances, hyperoxia first causes loss of central retinal capillaries because sufficient oxygen is released from retinal arteries to downregulate factors such as VEGF that are essential to maintain immature retinal capillaries. The ensuing return to normoxia then leads to oxygen deficiency in the vaso-obliterated area, which in turn results in hypoxia-induced VEGF upregulation and therefore the induction of abnormal neovascularization. Because of the ability to study both normal and abnormal vascular development in similar developmental time frames, the retina allows a comparison of hard-wired genetic and environmental influences on physiological and pathological angiogenesis. A detailed description of the method for inducing and analyzing oxygen-induced retinopathy has been published recently.49\n\n2.2. Avian Models of Developmental Angiogenesis\n\nAvian embryos, in particular chick (Gallus gallus domesticus) and quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) embryos, are classic models for in vivo studies of various developmental processes, including angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. A hallmark advantage of avian embryos is their development inside the eggshell, which can be used as a natural culture dish by creating a window that allows visual inspection of embryo development over extended periods of time on a microscope stage. Furthermore, the large size of the embryos allows the exchange of cells and tissue fragments between different embryos. The behavior of the grafted cells in the host can be followed by various labeling techniques, the most well-known technique being the tracing of quail cells grafted into chick hosts with a quail nucleolar marker or with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes only quail cells.53 Of particular interest for the study of vascular development is the monoclonal antibody QH1, which recognizes ECs from the quail but not the chick.54 In this way, the capacity of different embryonic donor tissues to generate ECs can be determined, and their destiny in the chick host can be fate mapped. For example, grafting experiments have shown that tissues developing in contact with the endoderm (visceral organs such as lung, liver, and intestine) have the capacity to generate their own ECs, whereas tissues developing in contact with the ectoderm (brain, dermis) cannot generate their own ECs and rely on vascularization from external sources through angiogenic sprouting.54 Grafting experiments can also be used to show how the environment into which the grafted ECs are placed alters their differentiation. For example, it has been shown that brain ECs, which would normally form a blood-brain barrier, develop fenestrations when grafted into the liver and conversely that liver ECs develop tight junctions when grafted into the brain. Furthermore, heterotopic grafts of arterial ECs can generate venous ECs and vice versa, together demonstrating that ECs can profoundly alter their phenotypes and have considerable plasticity to adapt to novel tissue environments in response to external stimuli.\n\nThe most popular avian angiogenesis model is the chorioallantois membrane (CAM).55 The CAM is a richly vascularized extraembryonic appendage that provides nutrients and oxygen to the chick embryo during the second half of the incubation period and is situated right beneath the eggshell. Its easy accessibility allows application of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic growth factors and monitoring of vessel growth in response to such factors in real time; therefore, the CAM has often been used to test the angiogenic activity of diverse molecules in vivo. For example, the angiogenic activity of fibroblast growth factor-2 in vivo was first demonstrated with the CAM assay. The chicken genome has been sequenced, and growth factor receptors such as fibroblast growth factor, VEGF, and angiopoietin receptors are highly conserved between birds, rodents, and human, enabling the testing of vascular response to mammalian growth factors in the CAM model. However, validating the relevance of the CAM response for intraembryonic angiogenesis by knockdown of the relevant receptor(s) in birds is technically challenging.\n\n2.2.1. Advantages of the Avian Model to Study Angiogenesis\n\nThe embryos are large in size and develop as a flat disk on top of the egg yolk, and they can be grown in ovo or in vitro for extended periods of time. Therefore, avian embryos are readily accessible for experimental manipulationsand visual inspection.\n\nThe avian embryo is ideally suited for grafting experiments because a piece of tissue from a quail can be placed into a chicken embryo, either into the corresponding location (homotopic grafting) or into a different location (heterotopic grafting). Additionally, tissues can be exchanged between embryos of different ages (heterochronic grafting).\n\nAn important recent advance has been the generation of transgenic quail expressing fluorescent markers in ECs.56 Time-lapse imaging of vascular development or grafting of tissues derived from such transgenic quail allows monitoring of EC migration and behavior in real time and provides a powerful means to understand vascular development in complex tissue environments.\n\nThe avian model is suitable for studies of flow-dependent vascular remodeling.\n\n2.3. Aquatic Animal Models to Study Vascular Development\n\nThe aquatic animal models Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Xenopus (African clawed frog) represent powerful models for in vivo studies of developmental and pathological angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Hallmark advantages of these models are the (semi)transparency of the embryos and larvae, their external and rapid development, and the availability of transgenic lines reporting the vasculature by fluorescent protein expression. The last advantage enables easy, noninvasive visualization of the vasculature and allows direct observation of angiogenic processes in live embryos in a dynamic manner. Together with the easy breeding and amenability of the models to genetic and pharmacological interference with gene/protein function, these characteristics have led to the extensive use of these models to study candidate (lymph)angiogenesis genes. In addition, their small size and abundance facilitate high-throughput mutagenesis or drug screens. The high extent of gene and pathway conservation with higher vertebrates provides relevance of findings from these small vertebrate models for the human situation. This is exemplified, for instance, by the various discoveries and characterizations in mutant zebrafish models of genes involved in human congenital vascular diseases.57\n\n2.3.1. Zebrafish Embryos as Genetic Models for Vascular Research\n\nZebrafish are tropical freshwater fish, ≈3 to 4 cm long in the adult stage but only a few millimeters long in the embryonic and early larval (hatched) stages. Up to ≈3 weeks of age, embryos and larvae are transparent; early pigmentation can be inhibited chemically by adding a melanogenesis inhibitor to the water58 to preserve full transparency and to improve detection of signal in whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses. Within 24 to 36 hours, all major organs have been laid out, the major axial trunk vessels have been formed, and the heart is beating.59\n\nA particular advantage of the zebrafish model for vascular studies is its small size; up to 4 to 5 days after fertilization, most cells remain within the passive diffusion distance of oxygen (≈100 μm). Hence, unlike mammalian embryos, zebrafish embryos can survive for several days even when vascular development is disrupted or when the vessels are dysfunctional. This allows studies of genes that, on knockout in mice, result in early embryonic lethality; it also allows the study of angiogenic processes and their flow dependency in mutants that have no blood flow.60\n\nTechniques for both forward and reverse genetics can be applied in zebrafish such as chemical mutagenesis, Tol2 transposase–based transgenesis, morpholino oligonucleotide–mediated knockdown, and the recent knockout and knock-in technologies based on zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator- like effector nucleases, or Cas9/Crispr for targeted gene modification.61,62 The zebrafish genome contains orthologs for most human genes, although because of zebrafish genome duplication paralog pairs are present for a subset of the zebrafish genes. Often, the paralogs each cover part of the functions of their human ortholog. This can complicate genetic studies if both paralogs have to be manipulated to observe phenotypic effects. It can also be highly useful because differential functions of the paralogs can then be studied independently in zebrafish.63\n\n2.3.1.1. Visualization of the Vasculature and Transgenic Fluorescent Reporter Lines\n\nA hallmark anatomic analysis of vascular development in zebrafish embryos and larvae was based on extensive confocal microangiography.64 Studies of vascular development in zebrafish embryos further rely heavily on expression analysis, mostly via in situ hybridization on whole-mount zebrafish embryos (see ZFIN, the Zebrafish Model Organism Database, at www.zfin.org for protocols). Microangiography and in situ stainings are quite labor intensive and time consuming. In addition, microangiography is an invasive technique and visualizes only perfused vessels. Vascular research in zebrafish has therefore benefited enormously from the generation of transgenic reporter lines with fluorescent protein expression specifically in vascular ECs. These lines allow developmental and morphological documentation of vessel formation at subcellular resolution, uniquely suited for dynamic live imaging of actively forming vessels by time-lapse confocal microscopy. In the past decade, the availability of reporter lines distinguishing between endothelial subtypes (arterial, venous, lymphatic) and endothelial subcellular structures (eg, cytoplasmic versus nuclear or membrane-restricted) has further expanded the zebrafish model toolbox significantly.59,65-68 The existence of these reporters also allows intercrosses and the analysis of EC types by flow cytometry or fluorescence-activated cell sorting for further characterization of isolated cells.\n\n2.3.1.2. Angioblast Migration, Vasculogenesis, and Arteriovenous Specification\n\nSpecified angioblasts in the trunk that originate in the posterior lateral plate mesoderm migrate from 14 hours after fertilization onward in 2 waves between somites and endoderm toward the midline immediately ventral to the hypochord. They coalesce there to form a primordial vascular cord as a precursor of the DA and posterior cardinal vein (PCV; and ). Angioblasts likely already become specified to the arterial or venous cell fate at the lateral plate mesoderm. The DA and PCV primordia in the primitive vascular cord segregate between 21 and 23 hours after fertilization. Vascular lumen formation occurs concomitantly with segregation59 ( and ). Expression analysis by in situ hybridization for arterial markers such as Notch1b, Dll4, Tbx20 (hrT), gridlock, and ephrinB2 and venous markers such as DAB2, EphB4, and VEGFR3 is typically used to document arteriovenous EC specification at the level of the DA and PCV. In contrast, vasculogenesis in the trunk can be documented by imaging of DA/ PCV formation and segregation via fluorescent microscopy of whole-mount reporter-line embryos or of their transverse sections.57,71\n\n2.3.1.3. Sprouting Angiogenesis, Branching, and Tip/Stalk Cell Phenotypes\n\nOn establishment of the major axial vessels in the trunk, the vascular tree expands by sprouting angiogenesis. From 23 hours after fertilization, bilateral sprouts branch off the DA and, led by a migratory tip cell extending long filopodia scanning the environment for guidance cues, grow dorsally along the intersomitic boundaries (reviewed elsewhere70). Follower proliferative stalk cells elongate the sprout and eventually form the vascular lumen ( and ). Tip and stalk cells can compete for the tip cell position on alteration of the relative expression levels of tip or stalk cell genes. Furthermore, the genetic “tip” or “stalk” instructions can be counteracted or even overruled by the metabolic status of the cell.72 Derived from the DA and as the first sprouts to emerge, these vessel branches are called arterial or primary intersomitic vessels (ISVs).\n\nSecondary sprouts develop from a second wave of intersomitic sprouts that, in contrast to the primary arterial ISVs, emanate from the PCV between 30 and 50 hours after fertilization. About half of these sprouts will give rise to the trunk lymphatic vasculature. The others connect to primary arterial ISVs, which lose their original connection with the DA and thereby become venous ISVs, in this way establishing the circulation in the trunk.64\n\nAngiogenic sprouting also occurs in the hindbrain when central artery sprouts emerge from the primordial hindbrain channels and grow toward the midline in an arch-shaped fashion to connect to the basilar artery.73\n\n2.3.1.4. Anastomosis and Lumen Formation\n\nDuring dorsal outgrowth, the ISVs emerging from the DA undergo cell divisions, ultimately comprising 4 to 6 cells that overlap along the ventrodorsal axis of the vessel. Cellular rearrangements will then form a lumen in a process involving cell hollowing (intracellular vacuolar fusion followed by intercellular lumen fusion) or cord hollowing (by exocytosis of vacuoles into the intercellular space common to multiple ECs).66\n\nOn reaching the roof of the neural tube, tip cells of the ISVs connect and anastomose with the tip cell of their neighboring ISVs to form the paired dorsal longitudinal anastomosing vessels.\n\nThis process is initiated by filopodial connections, evolving into the formation of cell junctions and lumenization via junctional remodeling and cell rearrangement.66\n\n2.3.1.5. Functional Testing\n\nFunctional testing at the level of the vessel can be done via microangiography with the use of fluorochrome-tagged dextran to evaluate the perfusion and integrity (absence of leakage) of lumenized vessels.64 Angiography also visualizes vessel morphology of patent vessels and their 3D localization in the embryo.64 Perfusion can also be tested on the basis of circulating DsRed+ blood cells in Tg(kdrl:GFP;gata1:DsRed) embryos.74 EC proliferation and apoptosis can be assessed by counting of nuclei using specific transgenic reporter lines with nuclear expression of the respective fluorescent protein in ECs65; by using standard assays such as DAPI, TOPRO, or BrDU staining; or, for apoptosis, by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining. Transgenic lines expressing Lifeact–enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion proteins marking F-actin based structures have been used to visualize filopodia, anastomosis, cellular contacts/junctions, and lumenization (see above).\n\n2.3.2. Xenopus Tadpoles as Genetic Models for Vascular Research\n\nA complementary aquatic animal model is the Xenopus tadpole, a favored amphibian model organism in developmental biology for decades.75 Similar to zebrafish, Xenopus embryos develop fast and ex utero, are semitransparent, and are amenable to forward and reverse genetics and chemicogenetics.75,76 The longer generation time (1–2 years) and pseudotetraploid genome make the generation of transgenic lines of X laevis challenging. This is much less the case for X tropicalis, which has a shorter generation time (4–6 months) and a diploid genome.\n\n2.3.2.1. Visualization of the Vasculature and Transgenic Fluorescent Reporter Lines\n\nPrevious reports on vascular development in Xenopus embryos were dependent mainly on in situ hybridization, dye injections into blastomers or directly into the vasculature, or corrosion casting.76,77 However, none of these methods allows a detailed, noninvasive, long term visualization of the developing vasculature. Whole-mount in situ hybridization also is technically challenging in tadpoles beyond stage 42 (4 days after fertilization). Fluorescent vascular reporters are available, although only a few to date, so far all in X laevis (for references, see the work by Ny et al78).\n\n2.3.2.2. Vasculogenesis in Xenopus Tadpoles\n\nFormation of the large axial vessels begins when a portion of endothelial progenitor cells in the lateral plate mesoderm ventral to the somites migrate to the midline to form the DA and endothelial progenitor cells that remain in place form the 2 paired PCVs.79 This mechanism resembles a situation closer to higher vertebrates (DA and PCV each develop from a pair of vessels that then fuse to form a single DA and single PCV) compared with zebrafish (DA and PCV develop from a common precursor vessel; see above).\n\n2.3.2.3. Angiogenesis in the Trunk and Fin\n\nAfter the formation of the primitive vascular system by vasculogenesis, new blood vessels arise via sprouting. Formation of the ISVs occurs from stage 35 onward, with the first intersomitic veins and arteries starting to sprout off from the PCV and DA, respectively.77 Thus, unlike zebrafish embryos, which display only 1 vessel, that of initially arterial character at each intersomitic junction, Xenopus embryos present 1 pair of artery and vein at each intersomitic junction ( ), similar to mammals. ISVs reaching the dorsal side of the trunk then form the dorsal longitudinal anastomosing vessel, which drains into the PCV near the head. Further vascular expansion is achieved by the sprouting of a capillary network, starting from the rostral-most vessels, ultimately covering the complete tail by stage 4677 ( ).\n\nBlood vessel sprouting from the axial arteries and veins into the fin can be visualized easily with the use of transgenic reporters. It starts around stage 46 (6 days after fertilization) and occurs in a random pattern. Loop formation by turning back of the sprouts toward the axial vessels and further branching of the sprouts establishes the vascular network of the fin.78 The blood vessel sprouting is followed by a similar lymphatic sprouting of the dorsal and caudal axial lymph vessels into the fin.78\n\n3. Adult Angiogenesis Models\n\nThe process of angiogenesis in the postnatal period is in most cases associated with tissue or organ growth, which requires an increasing supply of oxygen and nutrients. With rare exceptions, such postnatal expansion of tissues is caused by reproductive demands or pathologies such as neoplastic processes. Alternatively, new blood vessels are required for tissue and organ repair processes resulting from injury or vascular occlusion. Tadpoles allow for the study of developmental lymphangiogenesis in a more complex vertebrate animal model.78\n\n3.1. Placental Angiogenesis\n\nEven though angiogenesis in the healthy adult is generally a downregulated process, physiological angiogenesis occurs in the female reproductive system, most notably during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy-associated placental development.80 Fetoplacental vascularization is critical for an exchange of oxygen and nutrients between maternal and embryonic tissues and therefore determines fetal growth and well-being. Impaired angiogenesis in the placenta inevitably leads to fetal growth retardation or preeclampsia. In rodents, the most vascularized part of the placenta is a labyrinth. Angiogenesis in this labyrinth is known to be driven by key proangiogenic factors, including VEGF-A and placental growth factor.81 Both vascular density and the thickness of the labyrinth in mammals depend on successful angiogenesis; therefore, any abnormalities in these parameters might indicate the presence of angiogenic defects in knockout or transgenic models. Importantly, placental defects might occur in situations of maternal and embryonic angiogenic deficiencies. Therefore, when evaluating the phenotype of a new knockout or transgenic model in mammals, one might consider an analysis of placental vascularization. Initial characterization can be performed by a macroscopic inspection of the entire placenta in which vascularization is rather obvious at ×4 to ×10 magnification.82,83 This can be followed by tissue sectioning through the center of the placenta and measurements of the labyrinth thickness.84 Vascular density and area can be assessed in tissue section with CD31 or CD34 staining. The frequency and severity of placental defects might provide the very first evidence of a potential angiogenic activity of a studied gene product. Despite the major importance of angiogenesis in the female reproductive system, the measurement of angiogenesis during the menstrual cycle is rarely or never used as a method of measuring angiogenesis because of the difficulties in synchronizing the experiments, leading to a high variability.\n\n3.2. Wound Angiogenesis Assay\n\nOne of the most visual and physiologically relevant assays to measure angiogenesis is the cutaneous wound assay. Tissue repair is associated with increased cell proliferation, intense matrix deposition, and timely clearance of cell debris, and naturally, tissue repair depends heavily on blood supply. It is important to remember that vessel density as a function of time follows a bell-shaped curve in this model. During intense wound healing, new blood vessels are formed, thereby increasing vascular density several-fold compared with intact skin before wounding. When the repair process is complete, vascular density returns to its normal levels. In the punch wound model using 10-week-old C57/Black6 mice, the peak of neovascularization occurs between days 4 and 8 after wounding ( ). Vessel density generally returns to initial levels ≈3 weeks later. Therefore, before and at the peak of vascularization, this model reports on the angiogenic response; however, after this peak, this model might be an indicator of vascular stability and remodeling. Wound healing is highly dependent on vascularization, and most, if not all, known angiogenic inhibitors will delay this process, whereas proangiogenic factors generally accelerate it. Importantly, wound angiogenesis is driven by endogenously produced proangiogenic factors, which makes this model physiologically relevant. In particular, inhibition of VEGF or its receptors substantially slows wound healing. However, the amount and specificity of angiogenic growth factors cannot be controlled in this model.\n\nSeveral specifics of this model should be considered when measuring angiogenesis:\n\nIt is advisable to evaluate vessel density by staining ECs at various time points after wound healing to detect differences at the early and late stages of tissue repair.\n\nTissues sections of wounds need to be cut through the center of the wound. For evaluation of the vasculature, it is important to consider an entire area of the wound and surrounding skin (≈10 mm from the wound border). Vessel density, blood vessel diameter, and the state of vessel maturation vary substantially, depending on the distance from the center of the wound.\n\nThe process of vascularization and the timing of wound healing depend on the age of the experimental animals. Typically, both angiogenesis and wound healing slow down in older mice.\n\nAngiogenesis in wounds not only is influenced by vascular cells but also is highly dependent on the blood coagulation system, inflammatory cells, keratinocyte/fibroblast migration and proliferation, and matrix deposition. At early time points, the wound is a site of activation of platelets and the coagulation cascade to enable thrombus formation and, later on, fibrinolysis. Successful and timely blood clotting and timely fibrinolysis are prerequisites for a well-balanced angiogenic response. Delayed angiogenesis in this model and therefore slow wound closure might be caused by hemostatic rather than vascular defects. Therefore, the results of wound healing assays need to be interpreted with care.\n\nInflammatory responses are another important issue to consider in the evaluation of angiogenesis in wounds. The results of this assay might differ if animals are kept in pathogen-free conditions compared with regular housing. In addition, defects of the immune system may affect the angiogenic response. Monocytes and macrophages are important sources of proangiogenic growth factors, and any abnormalities in their recruitment and activation may eventually slow the angiogenic response.\n\nOverall, wound healing is a relatively robust model to assay angiogenesis dependent on endogenously produced growth factors. It is important to remember that angiogenesis in wounds is strongly influenced by tissue injury–induced responses such as hemostasis and inflammation. This assay is also useful for the analysis of angiogenesis in species other than mice, including rats, pigs, dogs, and primates.\n\n3.3. Matrigel Plug Assay and Angioreactors\n\nThe Matrigel plug assay is in principle an easy, doable angiogenesis assay. This assay involves subcutaneous injection of Matrigel with or without growth factor supplementation and analysis of the ingrowing capillaries after 7 to 14 days.85\n\n3.3.1. Advantages of the Matrigel Plug Assay:\n\nThe Matrigel plug assay is relatively easy to perform, and it is possible to control both the amount and type of proangiogenic growth factors. Alternatively, one can use a combination of proangiogenic factors.\n\nThe readout is based on the measurement of vascularization and hemoglobin contents in excised plugs. Thus, one can assay multiple samples in 1 experiment, making this method suitable for analyzing a variety of stimuli and conditions.\n\nMatrigel plugs can be fixed and sectioned to obtain additional information about their cellular content.\n\nThis assay can be conducted with exogenous cells mixed in the Matrigel before its implantation. Examples include various populations of macrophages and ECs. Human ECs premixed in Matrigel will also form blood vessels if implanted in mice in the presence of a sufficient amount of the growth factor(s).\n\nAdenoviruses carrying genetic constructs of interest can be incorporated into Matrigel, leading to effective transduction of invading cells.\n\n3.3.2. Limitations and Caveats\n\nThe assay has a number of inherent limitations that make it rather unreliable and not robust. Notably, when no growth factor is implanted and the assay is pursued under clean (ie, sterile conditions), there is essentially very little ingrowth of capillaries. In turn, when growth factors are included in the gel, then the response is heavily dependent on the presence of heparin. Without heparin, growth factors rapidly diffuse from the plug. With heparin, one needs to deal with the side effects of heparin such as increased bleeding. Specifically, the following aspects need to be considered when the Matrigel plug assay is used:\n\nConsistency of this method might be problematic. Often, 2 plugs excised from the same mouse yield different amounts of capillaries and hemoglobin, and measuring hemoglobin is not very reliable. This issue, however, may be overcome by increasing the number of experimental animals per group.\n\nSimilar to wound angiogenesis, this method is highly influenced by hemostatic abnormalities. Deficiencies in platelet function or blood coagulation defects leading to excessive bleeding often affect blood content in excised plugs. Therefore, using hemoglobin measurement as the sole end point is not appropriate. Extra-“bloody” plugs might be a manifestation of bleeding problems in animals. Likewise, treating experimental animals with anticoagulants might affect the results of this assay.\n\nThe vasculature generated by ingrowing capillaries in Matrigel plugs consists primarily of “naked” and leaky endothelial tubes with only a limited number of more mature, smooth muscle cell–covered blood vessels, which are typically present at the periphery of Matrigel plugs. The cotransplantation of cells may lead to more mature vessels.16\n\nThe assay is highly dependent on an inflammatory response to the Matrigel. Mice with abnormal inflammatory/immune responses may show impaired angiogenesis as a result of this feature.\n\nIn addition, to monitor vessel ingrowth, disks or other types of angioreactors have been implanted.86,87 Angioreactors are silicone cylinders that are closed at one end and filled with a relatively small volume (eg, 20 μL) of matrix premixed with or without angiogenic-modulating factors before they are subcutaneously implanted in the dorsal flank of mice.86 At 7 to 10 days after implantation, there are enough cells to determine an effective dose response to angiogenic modulating factors. In contrast to Matrigel plugs, which often are not homogeneously distributed in the subcutaneous space, disks or angioreactors have a defined volume and may be better standardized; however, reliability may also be a major problem with these types of assays.\n\n3.4. Tumor Angiogenesis\n\nThe critical impact of vascular growth on tumor expansion and metastatic tumor progression has made angiogenesis an important process in tumor biology. The assessment of vessel density is an inherent requirement in the evaluation of tumors. Furthermore, the identification and clinical application of antiangiogenic therapies have required histological, physiological, and metabolic readouts of the vasculature within a tumor.\n\nVessel density, defined as the number of vessels per area, has been the most frequently used parameter to evaluate the tumor vasculature. Essential questions in assessments of vessel growth and vessel density include the following: Which method should be used to visualize and quantitate tumor vessels? Which method should be used to obtain an accurate representation of average and local vascularity in a tumor? Finally, it is important to note that vessel density is an important angioarchitectural parameter suitable to describe the vasculature in a given tissue. However, vessel density is a static parameter that should not be confused with active angiogenesis, the assessment of which requires the analysis of endothelial turnover, for example, by counting the number of proliferating ECs.\n\n3.4.1. Visualization of Blood Vessels in Tumors\n\nAntibodies to detect platelet EC adhesion molecule (PECAM)/ CD31 are the best choice for the identification of tumor-associated vessels because CD31 antibodies are commercially available and relatively easy to use. However, preparation of the sample should be standardized because the antibodies are sensitive to overfixation. Other frequently used antibodies include MECA32, CD105, VEGFR2, and CD34, although some of these do not comprehensively detect vessels in all tumor types.88,89 However, one should keep in mind that antibodies on sections do not distinguish between occluded and functional (lumenized) vessels.\n\nIn addition, intravascular perfusion, particularly with Lycopersicum esculentum lectin, frequently preconjugated with fluorophores, has provided investigators a means to visualize vessels and offers information on the functional status of perfused vessels, in addition to providing excellent labeling.90 However, the perfusion technique can be affected by vascular clotting if not performed correctly.\n\n3.4.2. Morphometric Assessment\n\nParameters to be considered during morphometric evaluation are what, how and where to count.\n\n3.4.2.1. What to Count\n\nA simple procedure is to evaluate vascular profiles per area (for comparative purposes, profiles per 1 mm2 is the most appropriate parameter). Other quantification parameters used are the number of vascular branches and vessel diameter. Both should be used in addition to but should not substitute for quantification of vessel density. The quantification of pericytes and other mural cells (smooth muscle cells, astrocytes, and podocytes) in association with vessels has also been included as important maturation criteria.\n\n3.4.2.2. How to Count\n\nIn the past, quantification was done by recording the number of times that a vessel crossed a preorganized grid. Today, a number of computer-based programs are readily available (many of these such as the Angiotool, National Institutes of Health, can be downloaded for free). These programs have facilitated the process significantly and improved reproducibility (but not necessarily accuracy). Furthermore, standardization can be achieved, and larger areas can be evaluated. However, these methods rely heavily on the quality of the staining.\n\n3.4.2.3. Where to Count\n\nThe selection of sampling and the location of the area(s) are critical to accurately assess vascular density. As shows, some tumors might show what appears to be “hotspots” of vessel growth, whereas others are clearly less dense. As a result of this inherent heterogeneity, selection of one of these areas versus another can yield directly opposite results. Furthermore, areas of contact between tumor and normal tissue are frequently more vascular than areas in the center of the tumor. Thus, sampling a small area is unlikely to provide representative vessel density, and because of these caveats, a broad assessment of the entire tumor mass is a must. This clearly affects the evaluation of human tumor biopsies. Thus, other modalities of vascular assessment (not invasive and relying on broader and repeated evaluation) have also been used. These include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and ultrasound.91,92 These types of clinical imaging are most applicable to patients, and although they do not offer the degree of sensitivity of optical imaging, they are minimally invasive and safer than repeated biopsies. Therefore, they constitute a valid approach to determine responses to therapy.\n\n3.4.3. Vessel Cooption\n\nWhether a tumor actually recruits its own vasculature by inducing angiogenesis or coopts the existing vascular supply has been subject to controversy.93 Probably both events coexist; however, from a therapeutic perspective, there are important differences. Angiogenesis involves EC proliferation and migration and 3D vascular morphogenesis, and angiogenic vessels are known to be leaky, poorly covered by pericytes, and more susceptible to antiangiogenic therapies. Coopted vessels, on the other hand, may be stable, have a well-formed basement membrane, and are well coated by mural cells, making them likely more difficult to target. How can we determine whether the vessels are in fact de novo branches of preexisting vascular beds? The best approach is to use cell cycle markers (Ki67 and phosphor-histone H3 antibodies are good choices) and to determine proliferation kinetics (bromodeoxyuridine or similar labels).\n\n3.4.4. Metabolic and Physiological Considerations\n\nUltimately, the role of blood vessels is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to either normal or pathological tissues. Thus, the level of oxygenation and the metabolic status of tissues have been considered important parameters in the evaluation of an adequate/sufficient or inadequate/insuffi-cient vasculature. The use of “hypoxy-probes,” either alone or in combination with hypoxia-inducible factor readouts (transcript or protein), has been a useful approach to indirectly determine the oxygenation status of tissues.94 More recently, evaluation of glycolysis and glyconeogenesis has also revealed information on the efficacy of the vascular supply. In fact, this information in combination with vessel density is powerful in assessing general changes in metabolic patterns, in addition to vessel status.\n\n3.5. Genetic Tools to Study Angiogenesis\n\nGenetic tools provide important insights into the mechanisms of angiogenesis but can also be used to deliver therapeutic molecules. Because VEGF has been one of the most studied growth factors in this respect, this section illustrates the general methodologies that can be used to overexpress or inhibit gene expression in the context of angiogenesis with VEGF used as an example. The methodologies described below are equally applicable to other angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors. Of note, various other tools for delivering or inhibiting angiogenic factors (eg, biomaterials, antibodies, VEGF traps) have been developed and are reviewed elsewhere.95\n\nGenetic VEGF manipulations can be grossly divided into 2 categories. The first is based on delivery of VEGFencoding DNA or a modified RNA to induce VEGF gain of function or to interfere with VEGF transcription or translation for VEGF loss-of-function studies. Delivery modes make use of a direct application of the respective nucleic acids, for example, by plasmids,96 engraftment of ex vivo transduced cells, or, primarily, virus-mediated delivery.97 The second category includes different transgenic models of VEGF gain of function and loss of function. Whereas the first category might be considered a more relevant approach to eventual implementation of VEGF-based therapies, models of the second category, by virtue of their much greater flexibility, are better suited to elucidate VEGF-related pathogenic mechanisms ( ).\n\nTable 3.\n\nPurposeTransduced/\n\nDelivered\n\nNARouteFeaturesExamples of\n\nUsePlasmid-mediated deliveryIntended CA and PA therapiesVEGF-encoding plasmidsIM, IMC, TRECAdvantage: Safety, ease\n\nDisadvantage: transiencyClinical trials for CAD and PADModified RNA deliveryImprove heart functionVEGF modified RNAIMCAdvantage: Sustained effectMouse MI modelAdenovirusRobust VEGF secretionDifferent VEGF isoformsIV, IM, IMC, TRECInflammation, hepatotropismClinical trials for CAD and PADAAVSustained VEGF secretion/VEGF inhibitionVEGF/shRNAIM, IMC, IC, IONonimmunogenic or inflammatory, sustained, postmitotic cell tropism, ease of combinatorial delivery; inducible vectorsVEGF production in preclinical models of myocardial, ocular, and brain angiogenesis, limb ischemia, neurogenesisLentivirusSustained VEGF secretion/VEGF inhibitionVEGF/shRNAIM, IMC, IC, IOEfficient, stable transduction; transduce both dividing and postmitotic cells, inducible constructsVEGF production in preclinical models of myocardial, peripheral, ocular, and cerebral angiogenesis; VEGF silencing in tumorsVEGF ectopic/overexpression, conditionalEctopic/overexpression of VEGF in selected organs or cell typesDifferent VEGF isoformsTransgenesisOrgan/cell-type specificity dictated by the choice of driving. promoter; temporal controls by tamoxifen inducibilityConditional VEGF induction in many different organs and by specific cell types thereinVEGF ectopic/overexpression, conditional and reversibleEctopic/overexpression of VEGF in selected organs or cell types in a reversible mannerDifferent VEGF isoformsTransgenesisVEGF on and off switching regulated by doxycyclineDistinguishing phenotypes requiring continuous VEGF from “hit-and-run” actionsTransgenic modifications of endogenous VEGFReplacing endogenous VEGF gene (or its regulatory sequences) with a modified versionA construct targeting the VEGF locusGene replacementEnables precise mutations in both coding and noncoding regions affecting any facet of VEGF biologyTransgenic reporter for endogenous VEGF expression; VEGF hypomorphic alleles; VEGF with altered splicing pattern; hypoxia nonresponsive VEGF (an ALS model)Conditional VEGF LOFPrecluding endogenous VEGF productionVEGF deletion using the Cre/lox systemOption of delivering Cre via viral infectionEnables VEGF deletion in organ/cell type of choice using floxed VEGF and a tissue-specific Cre recombinaseVEGF deletion in almost every adult organ; uncovers the whole spectrum of nonvascular VEGF functionsConditional and reversible VEGF LOFReversible inhibition of endogenous VEGF signalingConditional induction of a transgene encoding a VEGF trapInducer added in drinking waterOn and off switching of a doxycycline-regulated VEGF decoy receptorProduce hypoperfused myocardium for modeling ischemic heart disease; study reversibility of phenotypes caused by VEGF blockade or insufficient perfusion\n\n3.5.1. Virus-Mediated Delivery of VEGF-Encoding DNA or RNA and VEGF Interfering RNA\n\nAdenoviral vectors, adeno-associated virus–based vectors, and retrovirus, including lentivirus-based vectors, have been used to package VEGF cDNA, and different delivery modes are used to secure optimal transduction of the target organ. Several considerations apply to viral vector selection, including transduction efficacy, a preferential organ tropism, transduction of mitotic versus postmitotic cells, transient versus long-term expression, and adverse effects such as immunogenicity and oncogenic potential. For example, adenoviral vectors have a marked liver tropism, whereas adeno-associated virus vectors with different tropisms can be selected, including those displaying a specific tropism for skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, which render them particularly suitable for cardiovascular applications. Furthermore, adenoassociated virus vectors have the advantage (or disadvantage) of expressing the therapeutic gene in these cells for indefinite periods.98 Lentivirus vectors can infect postmitotic cells, whereas vectors based on other retroviruses infect only dividing cells and thus allow a choice of vector suitable for intended VEGF transduction of particular cell subpopulations.97\n\nViral vectors used to transduce VEGF in larger animals, including pig models of myocardial infarction and rabbit models of peripheral vascular disease, can be delivered in a variety of ways. Direct intramyocardial or muscular injection is generally favored over systemic intravenous or intra-arterial injection. Percutaneous selective pressure-regulated retroinfusion revealed favorable results compared with surgical and percutaneous intramyocardial injection techniques.99 Another methodology of VEGF gene transfer into muscle involves retrovirus-mediated transduction of myoblasts, selection of clones expressing desirable VEGF levels, and injection of those clones into the muscle tissue. This procedure circumvents the heterogeneity of VEGF production after viral transduction in vivo and prevents excessive VEGF production and resultant edema. For VEGF gene transfer to the brain, both adeno-associated virus vectors and lentivirus vectors are being used in conjunction with a stereotactic injection into defined cerebral regions. Replacing DNA vectors, the use of VEGF-encoding synthetic modified RNA was recently introduced. Direct comparison of myocardially injected modified RNA with DNA vectors in an experimental MI model revealed increased efficacy of the former.100\n\nFor the purpose of VEGF loss of function, extensive use is being made of viral vectors expressing short hairpin RNA sequences complementary to VEGF mRNA and inhibiting endogenous VEGF production by either targeting its mRNA for destruction or interfering with its translation. The same criteria for selecting vectors and delivery modes discussed above also apply for short hairpin RNA application.\n\n3.5.2. Transgenic Mouse Models of VEGF Manipulation\n\nBecause the VEGF dose is exquisitely controlled during embryonic development, with even a small deviation from its normal level of expression during critical developmental stages resulting in early embryonic lethality, transgenic manipulations designed for VEGF overexpression or underexpression ought to be conditional. The most commonly used approaches for conditional VEGF induction are the systems based on either doxycycline-regulated expression of VEGF or tamoxifen-activatable Cre expression.101 The former is a bitransgenic system composed of a doxycycline-regulated VEGF responder transgene that is activated in trans by a doxycycline-regulated driver transgene in the form of a transactivator protein driven by a tissue-specific promoter. This allows one to induce and, in turn, to deinduce VEGF in the tissue of choice by adding or removing doxycycline to the drinking water (“tet-on” and “tet-off” versions of the system, respectively). A large panel of doxycycline-regulated driver mice is available and allows VEGF induction specifically in almost any organ of choice and on a predetermined time schedule. Using a doxycycline-releasing mini-pump implanted in a pregnant mouse also allows extending VEGF induction to defined developmental time windows with the intention of modeling VEGF-related congenital defects. A significant drawback of the system is the limited ability to control the level of induced VEGF, which may become excessive and result in the formation of an abnormal and leaky vasculature, underscoring the need to uncouple the angiogenic and permeability-promoting activities of VEGF.\n\nExercising a VEGF on/off manipulation provides an opportunity to distinguish nonvascular from vascular VEGF functions. In these experimental protocols, VEGF is switched off after it has acted to generate a durable vascular network. Phenotypes persisting after VEGF withdrawal can therefore be attributed to effects of the newly acquired vasculature rather than VEGF per se. For conditional VEGF knockouts, a floxed VEGF allele is usually used in conjunction with a tissue specific Cre recombinase to restrict VEGF deletion to the desired tissue or cell type. The use of a tamoxifen-regulated Cre provides temporal control over VEGF nullification. Another approach for VEGF loss of function is based on the doxycycline-regulated model described above in which the responder transgene encodes a soluble VEGF receptor chimeric protein acting as a VEGF trap. A clear advantage of this system is the option of conditional resumption of normal VEGF signaling (using the on/off mode), an impossible option with Cre-mediated VEGF deletion. Variable durations of the VEGF blockade in this system allow escalation in the severity of the ensuing phenotypes, notably the levels of vascular and perfusion deficits that can then be used to model different manifestations of ischemic heart disease.\n\n3.6. Hind-Limb and Coronary Models\n\nArteriogenesis, the process of the formation of arterial conduits, is a promising therapeutic approach to the treatment of a number of ischemic vascular diseases. The term arteriogenesis refers to development of larger vessels, that is, arterial blood conduits such as arterioles and arteries. Collateral formation represents a specific case of arteriogenesis. By definition, collateral vessels provide artery-to-artery connections and are thought to play a protective role by providing alternative routes to blood flow.102\n\n3.6.1. Brief Description of Arteriogenesis\n\nArteriogenesis takes place during embryonic development, but it can also occur in adult tissues. In the latter case, arteriogenesis typically occurs at sites of occlusion (atherosclerosis) or physical disruption (eg, ligation, trauma) of preexisting arterial conduits. It can also occur in growing organs (eg, myocardial hypertrophy) or tumors. Molecular signals and processes responsible for arteriogenesis are poorly understood and are subject to considerable controversy. The 2 most commonly considered mechanisms are the expansion of preexisting collaterals and de novo arteriogenesis.103 Clearly, both scenarios can produce new arteries, but their contribution varies, depending on the experimental model tested.\n\nIt is widely thought that a larger number of preexisting collaterals serves as a predictor of better flow recovery after ligation of a major arterial trunk. Indeed, mouse strains with higher numbers of collaterals show better blood flow recovery after common femoral artery ligation than mouse species with fewer collaterals.104 Similarly, among larger animals, a higher number of visible preexisting collaterals predicts better recovery. This is an important consideration because studies in humans have demonstrated a wide variability in the extent of preexisting, recruitable collaterals and suggested a protective clinical role of preexisting collaterals.105 However, more recent studies demonstrated that not all preexisting collaterals are equal and that, under certain circumstances, a larger number of collaterals does not improve or might even worsen the outcome of an acute arterial occlusion (eg, see the work by Skuli et al106).\n\n3.6.2. Hind-Limb Ischemia Models: General Considerations\n\nHind-limb ischemia models are typically performed in smaller species (mice, rats), although studies have also been conducted in larger animals (rabbits, pigs). There are 2 distinct versions of hind-limb ischemia models: a less severe collateral remodeling model that results in proximal arterial flow restriction but no rest ischemia in the distal limb and a more severe model that leads to severe rest ischemia that may result in a certain amount of tissue loss.107,108 Blood flow recovery in both of these models is thought to be dependent primarily on arteriogenesis, with most new arteries forming above the site of ligation, although arteriogenesis also takes place below the knee. Some flow recovery is undoubtedly attributable to angiogenesis in the ischemic part of the limb. Unfortunately, the exact contributions of neovascularization in these 3 sites to the total flow recovery have never been accurately defined.\n\nAs alluded to above, the extent of arteriogenesis in this model is heavily dependent on the mouse or rat strain and the species being used.104 Whereas C57Bl6 mice recover almost fully without any therapeutic interference, other mouse strains (eg, Balb/C) and rabbits do not.104,109 However, genetic components responsible for these differences have not been identified. Other key parameters affecting blood flow recovery include the age of the animals (reduced in older animals)110 and the presence of atherosclerosis or diabetes mellitus.111 It is important to keep in mind when hind-limb ischemia models are being used that, although they are excellent for studying the mechanisms of neovascularization, they have significant limitations as a readout for potential therapeutic agents because results obtained through experimental testing in young, healthy animals does not readily translate into efficacy in older patients with systemic vascular diseases.\n\n3.6.2.1. Hind-Limb Ischemia Models: Readouts\n\nThe key readouts of the model include blood flow recovery in the ischemic foot, the extent of arteriogenesis above and below the knee, and the extent of angiogenesis in the calf. Additional readouts may include vasodilator reserve, the extent of mononuclear cell infiltration of ischemic and nonischemic tissues, and changes in gene expression of key molecules involved in arteriogenic and angiogenic responses.\n\nThe most critical functional readout of the assay is the extent and time course of blood flow recovery in the ischemic foot. This is usually accomplished with the use of a deeply penetrating laser Doppler positioned on the skin to determine a ratio of blood flow in the ischemic foot and normal foot.107 Occasionally, a Doppler probe positioned directly over the blood vessel of interest is used. The method, although seemingly simple, is subject to many factors that can affect the readout, including the temperature of the animal and the extremities, depth of anesthesia, choice of anesthetic, and quantification of the Doppler images. It is important to assess blood flow not only at a given time point but also over a period of time. Typical time points include flow determination immediately after ischemia induction and then at 3, 7, and 14 days. In some cases, it may be necessary to extend the experiment for 3 or 4 weeks, in which case additional flow measurements should be made.\n\nIn addition to flow assessment, the extent of arteriogenesis should be directly quantified. Micro–computed tomographic (CT) imaging has emerged as a gold standard, given its high resolution and the quantifiable nature of the images ( ). However, the technique is not straightforward and requires accurate filling of the distal arterial bed with a contrast agent without this agent entering capillaries and the venous circulation. Underfilling is also a common problem and may substantially affect quantification.112 In general, all animals should be processed on the same day to minimize variability. Other imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and high-resolution x-ray angiography, can be used, but they lack the resolution of a micro-CT image.\n\nHistological assessment of arteriogenesis also is sometimes used by staining with smooth muscle cell markers such as α-smooth muscle actin followed by quantification of vessel diameter (grouped by size, eg, <50, 50–100, >100 μm). The key challenge is a large variability in arteriolar density between different muscle groups or even different sections within the same muscle group. In all cases, a sufficient number of sections should be counted, and the assessment should be carried out by investigators blinded to the genetic or treatment group to which the animal under study belongs.\n\n3.6.3. Ameroid Constrictor and Reduction Stent Models\n\nAmeroid occluders are used to induce gradual occlusion of a coronary artery, creating a collateral-dependent myocardial territory. Although ameroid occluders have been used in both dogs and pigs, pigs are the preferred model, given the relatively small abundance of coronary collateral circulation. If done correctly, with the occlusion developing over 5 to 7 days, there is only a minimal area of left ventricular (LV) wall necrosis (myocardial infarction). Coronary angiography demonstrates peri-ameroid collaterals that are sufficient to maintain baseline myocardial perfusion under normal but not stress (exercise or pacing) conditions. Functional studies demonstrate normal global and regional LV function at rest and regional myocardial dysfunction under stress conditions.\n\nThe principal mechanism of adaptation to the ameroid occlusion in pigs is de novo arteriogenesis. Although pigs demonstrate de novo arteriogenesis, there are a small number of preformed collaterals; the principal development here is the formation of peri-ameroid collaterals, although large epicardial collaterals from normal to ischemic territory have also been observed. Angiogenesis is also observed in the ameroid territory; its contribution to overall flow restoration in this model is considered minimal, but there are no extensive quantitative studies documenting this.\n\nThe ameroid model is typically carried out in young (≈6weeks old) Yorkshire pigs, with animals nearly doubling in size during the experimental period (from ≈40 to 80 lb). This growth clearly complicates data interpretation because any collateral growth is superimposed on the normal coronary artery growth process that also occurs during this period. Alternatively, minipigs and microswine have been used for these studies. These animals are substantially smaller than Yorkshire pigs, but they still tend to be used when fairly young, at 2 to 3 months of age. Very little ameroid work has been done in atherosclerotic pigs. Consequently, as with rodent hind-limb ischemia models, the data are more suitable for mechanistic than therapeutic studies.\n\nAlternatively, percutaneous implantation of a reduction stent graft has been used to decrease blood supply over the long term.113 Therefore, stents are implanted into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) but are not fully expanded, resulting in an initial stenosis of 75% of the luminal diameter that progressively develops into a (sub)total occlusion of the LAD and hibernating myocardium at day 28.\n\n3.6.3.1. Ameroid Constrictor and Reduction Stent Models: Readouts\n\nA number of techniques are used to assess both the anatomical extent of blood flow recovery and its functional impact. Blood flow improvement in the ischemic zone is typically assessed with microspheres (radioactive or colored), although MR imaging has also been used. Functional improvement is assessed with 2-dimensional echocardiography to obtain indexes of regional and global LV function.\n\n3.6.4. Acute Coronary Occlusion Models\n\nThere are several models in both small114-117 and large animals118-121 in which a major coronary artery or multiple branches are occluded for the specific purpose of inducing significant myocardial ischemia and infarction for the subsequent analysis of neovasculogenesis and arteriogenesis in response to experimental therapies ( ). These models can entail permanent occlusion or a prolonged occlusion followed by reperfusion.122 The result is an area of myocardial necrosis and, in some models, an ischemic border zone around the infarct territory. Regional or even global myocardial contractile function is usually impaired. Adverse ventricular remodeling also occurs over a period of time, leading, in the case of extensive myocardial damage, to the development of heart failure.\n\nTable 4.\n\nModelSpeciesTechniqueOutcomeAcute coronary ligationSheepDistal LAD and second diagonalLV infarct expansion by 4 h followed by LV thinning over 2 mo and development of CHFAcute coronary ligationSheepSecond and third marginal of Cx20% PW MI\n\nChronic mitral regurgitationAcute coronary ligationSheepSecond and third marginal of Cx and PDA40% PW MI\n\nSevere mitral regurgitation <1 hAcute coronary ligationRatProximal LADAW MI and CHF in 3–6 wkAcute coronary ligationMouseProximal LADAW MI and CHF in 2 wkIschemia/reperfusionDogLigation of LAD distal to first diagonal for 90 min, 4 h of reperfusionLV function at 48 h\n\nHistology at 48 hIschemia/reperfusionBaboonLigation of LAD distal to first diagonal for 120 min, 60 min of reperfusion to 1 wkLV function, ischemic-zone wall thickness, regional myocardial blood flow, arrhythmias, infarctionIschemia/reperfusionRabbitLigation of LAD distal to first diagonal for 90 min, 120 min of reperfusionHypokinesis at 10 min after reperfusion\n\nLV dysfunction and infarct evaluation/histology at 4 wkIschemia/reperfusionMouse/ratSnare proximal LAD occlusion for 30 min, 30 min of reperfusionImmediate LV dysfunction and histological changesRepetitive ischemiaDogOcclude LCx for 2 min at 30–60 min intervalsStimulation of collateralizationRepetitive ischemiaRatOcclude proximal-mid LAD for 40 s at 20-min intervals; repeated for 10 dStimulation of collateralizationAmeroidDogProximal LADCHF within 60 dAmeroidPigProximal CxChronic ischemia in 3 wkEmbolizationDogDog Intracoronary sequential latex microsphere injection until EF 35%Global ischemia, no localized MI; 30%–50% mortalityEmbolizationSheepSequential intracoronary 90-μm microsphere injection until EF of 35%4 and 26 wk after CHF establishment: LV end-systolic elastance, preload recruitable stroke workReduction stentPigPercutaneous implantation of a reduction stent in the LAD (75% stenosis)(Sub)total occlusion of the LAD and hibernating myocardium at day 28, functional analysis at day 49\n\nThe small animal coronary occlusion model typically uses either mice or rats. In both models, the LAD is ligated to create an extremely reproducible and survivable 35% LV infarct. The advantage of mice is the availability of a wide range of transgenic animals, along with the development of LV remodeling and heart failure within 2 to 4 weeks. Mice, however, pose a relative technical challenge compared with rats in terms of intubation and LAD ligation. Rats remodel and develop heart failure in 4 to 6 weeks. This model can be used in both an acute and chronic approach. An intervention, whether it directly involves the myocardium or systemic administration of an agent, can be initiated immediately after infarction123 or several weeks postoperatively124 to model a more chronic process. The major limitation of this model is that open access to the myocardium is needed for intervention, which does not directly translate to the majority of clinical scenarios.\n\nThe small animal reperfusion model is similar to the permanent ligation model except that the LAD is occluded temporarily, typically for 30 to 90 minutes, followed by a comparable reperfusion period.125,126 When cats or rabbits are used rather than mice or rats, the ischemia and reperfusion periods tend to be somewhat longer. Additionally, the LAD is occluded just distal to the first diagonal.127,128 The intervention can be performed at any time point but commonly occurs just before and after reperfusion.\n\nThe large animal acute coronary occlusion model can be accomplished via embolization,129,130 microspheres,131 balloon,132 and ligation.118-120 Canine, ovine, and porcine models are described extensively in the literature. With the embolization or microsphere approach, 4 to 14 injections are typically required until the reduced goal ejection fraction is achieved. Global LV ischemia occurs without a localized area of infarction. The mortality is high at 30% to 50%, but the advantage of this model is its utility in creating chronic LV dysfunction for up to 6 months. The coronary ligation approach possesses the ability to model both myocardial and valvular pathology. In sheep, it is possible to induce an acute LV infarct followed by LV thinning, aneurysm formation, and heart failure over an 8-week period by ligating the distal LAD and second diagonal. Chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation can be modeled over 8 weeks in the sheep by ligating the second and third circumflex oblique arteries. Acute severe mitral regurgitation can be induced in 1 hour by ligation of the second and third circumflex oblique arteries combined with the posterior descending artery. Overall, the ovine coronary occlusion approach can model a variety of cardiac pathologies. Potential interventions at various time points include systemic and localized cell-based therapy, cytokine-based therapy, and mechanical devices.\n\nFor large animal reperfusion, the common models are canine and porcine. In the canine model,122 the LAD is occluded for 60 to 90 minutes just distal to the first diagonal, and reperfusion is allowed for ≥4 hours. Function and histology have been assessed up to 48 hours after the procedure. The model is frequently used to assess biochemical and antioxidant therapies.133 An alternative to this approach is the repetitive ischemia canine model in which the left circumflex is briefly occluded for 2 minutes at 30- to 60-minute intervals.134 This model has been used to evaluate collateral growth and recently been scaled down to a small animal model.135 In the porcine model,136 the LAD is balloon occluded just distal to the second diagonal. Ischemia and reperfusion times are similar to those in the canine model and evaluate similar therapeutic approaches.\n\nOverall, these permanent occlusion and ischemia-reperfusion models are usually used to establish a framework in which molecular, cellular, genetic, and tissue engineering experimental therapies are evaluated for their efficacy in both restoring perfusion in the border zone and improving regional and global LV function. Myocardial regeneration is also often examined in this context.\n\n3.6.4.1. Acute Coronary Occlusion Models: Readouts\n\nThere are a multitude of methodologies for data collection in these models, including but not limited to microsphere assessment of blood flow, determination of oxygen tension, echocardiography, MR imaging, angiography, and invasive pressure-volume hemodynamic assessment. Additionally, standard histology, immunohistochemistry, and genetic analyses are frequently performed to assess gross and biomolecular changes.\n\nMicrosphere assessment is accomplished by injection of radiolabeled microspheres, frequently directly into the left atrium, followed by assessment of the myocardium by the use of gamma counters to measure tracer decay, correlating to regional perfusion.137 Extending from this, regional oxygen tension can be assessed by intramyocardial injection of a phosphorescent probe that is quenched by oxygen. Briefly, the phosphorescent decay is optically measured and correlated to oxygen tension.138 Echocardiography is readily available in both small and large animal models for geometric analysis of LV dimensions, along with functional evaluation of ejection fraction and fractional shortening. Cardiac MR imaging can play a significant role in demonstrating 3D ventricular geometry, intraventricular flow, global function, regional strain, and even biochemical changes.119,139 Angiography can be implemented in large animal models with Rentrop scoring used to evaluate vascular collateralization.119 Invasive LV hemodynamic measurements are acquired with the use of a pressure-volume catheter. The catheter is preferably introduced into the LV in a closed chest, frequently via the right carotid artery. This approach is widely used in both small and large animal models.\n\n3.7. Carotid Remodeling\n\nCarotid artery remodeling is a complex physiological process governed by hemodynamic alterations and multicellular responses. The integral need for remodeling has been well defined by Mulvany and Glagov (whose principles are now commonly called the Glagov law). Their collective works state that a blood vessel undergoes compensatory morphological changes via either inward or outward remodeling to maintain a physiological state of blood flow. Vessel remodeling is typically associated with pathophysiological conditions such as atherosclerosis; however, it is also important for arteriogenesis and vessel maturation. The demand on the vessel wall to grow, thereby regulating a homeostatic environment, is controlled primarily by a balance between EC, vascular smooth muscle cell, inflammatory cell, and progenitor cell signaling. In response to stimuli such as changes in blood flow, EC damage, or inflammation, vessel wall thickness either increases (outward) or decreases (inward with narrow lumen) in size ( ). Both situations involve dynamic extracellular matrix remodeling and vascular smooth muscle cell and progenitor cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis.\n\nThe degree and type of remodeling that occurs are highly complex and largely governed by genetic factors and the extent of vascular perturbation. Several animal models have been designed to better study carotid remodeling processes. Each model presents advantages and disadvantages in terms of large vessel remodeling. summarizes the advantages, limitations, and challenges of current animal models.\n\nTable 5.\n\nModelAnimalInsightAdvantagesDisadvantagesReference*Aortic bandingMouseCarotid remodeling results from changes in pulsatile pressure and turbulent blood flow\n\nHypertensive modelProvides a correlative and mathematical analysis of the effects of pulsatile pressure\n\nThere is less neointimal formationData obtained in mice cannot be easily extrapolated to humans because of differences in cardiac output and function140Adventitial FeCl3 and CaCl2Rat, mouseExternal application to the vessel wall\n\nInduces remodeling with significant inflammationTechnically easy\n\nRemodeling is mediated by inflammationThrombus formation occurs and influences vessel remodeling\n\nSevere injury model141Arteriovenous fistulaRat, mouse, rabbitEC-mediated response to high shear stressLarge adaptive outward remodelingStenosis development and reduced long-term vessel patency142Balloon angioplastyRat, pig, rabbitEC denudation induces significantly enhanced VSMC proliferation and dynamic ECM remodelingVSMC signaling response and neointimal hyperplasia are consistent\n\nRat models are well developed and characterizedNot technically reproducible\n\nBalloon injury in mouse carotids is difficult143Complete carotid ligationMousePrimarily VSMC-mediated remodeling\n\nExtent of remodeling is determined by length of blood flow cessationHighly reproducible\n\nTechnically easy to perform\n\nPhenotype primarily governed by blood flow cessation and not surgical manipulationThrombus formation can occur and influence vessel remodeling beyond blood flow cessation144Partial carotid ligationRat, mouse, rabbitPrimarily VSMC-mediated remodeling\n\nExtent of remodeling is determined by both percent reduction and length of blood flow cessationHighly reproducible\n\nPreferable to complete ligation to study physiological remodeling in response to low blood flow\n\nInward and outward remodeling is genetically determined\n\nLess likelihood of thrombus and vessel occlusionRats and rabbits form less neointimal hyperplasia and remodeling relative to mice\n\nAnatomic variation among mouse strains can affect blood flow reduction after ligation144, 145Photochemical exposureRat, mouseInternal application causes endothelium injury\n\nInduces remodeling with significant inflammationRemodeling is specifically mediated by inflammation\n\nMore subtle injury compared with "
