        "text": "Abstract\n\nMucosal barriers provide the first line of defense between internal body surfaces and microbial threats from the outside world.1 In the colon, the barrier consists of two layers of mucus and a single layer of tightly interconnected epithelial cells supported by connective tissue and immune cells.2 Microbes colonize the loose, outer layer of colonic mucus, but are essentially excluded from the tight, epithelial-associated layer by host defenses.3 The amount and composition of the mucus is calibrated based on microbial signals and loss of even a single component of this mixture can destabilize microbial biogeography and increase the risk of disease.4–7 However, the specific components of mucus, their molecular microbial targets, and how they work to contain the gut microbiota are still largely unknown. Here we show that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), the prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern molecule (DAMP), acts as an agent of host mucosal defense in the colon. HMGB1 in colonic mucus targets an evolutionarily conserved amino acid sequence found in bacterial adhesins, including the well-characterized Enterobacteriaceae adhesin FimH. HMGB1 aggregates bacteria and blocks adhesin-carbohydrate interactions, inhibiting invasion through colonic mucus and adhesion to host cells. Exposure to HMGB1 also suppresses bacterial expression of FimH. In ulcerative colitis, HMGB1 mucosal defense is compromised, leading to tissue-adherent bacteria expressing FimH. Our results demonstrate a new, physiologic role for extracellular HMGB1 that refines its functions as a DAMP to include direct, virulence limiting effects on bacteria. The amino acid sequence targeted by HMGB1 appears to be broadly utilized by bacterial adhesins, critical for virulence, and differentially expressed by bacteria in commensal versus pathogenic states. These characteristics suggest that this amino acid sequence is a novel microbial virulence determinant and could be used to develop new approaches to diagnosis and treatment of bacterial disease that precisely identify and target virulent microbes.\n\nMain\n\nThe acellular mucosal barrier lies over the colon and normally limits physical and biochemical contact between microbes and the host epithelium.8 When this first barrier fails, microbes adhere to intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) leading to high levels of toxins and pro-inflammatory microbial components at the IEC surface, invasion into IEC, and translocation across the cellular barrier into deeper tissues.9–11 Intestinal epithelial cells are responsible for production and transport of acellular barrier components into the gut lumen and form the cellular portion of the barrier.12 We previously demonstrated that mice conditionally deficient in IEC HMGB1 (ΔIEC) are highly susceptible to chemical and immune-mediated colitis.13 However, we also observed high levels of HMGB1 in IEC of healthy humans and mice along with evidence of cytokine abnormalities in mice lacking IEC HMGB1, even when unchallenged.13 These factors led us to investigate physiologic functions of HMGB1 at the colonic mucosal barrier.\n\nHMGB1 is released into colonic mucus in response to the gut microbiota\n\nHMGB1 was highly concentrated at the luminal surface of the mouse colon in the tight, epithelial-associated mucus layer (Fig. 1a, Extended data Fig. 1). In littermate ΔIEC mice, HMGB1 was absent from IEC bodies and profoundly decreased in mucus, suggesting that IEC are the primary source of HMGB1 in colonic mucus (Fig. 1b, c). HMGB1 protein was likewise detectable in IEC from C57BL/6 germ-free (GF) mice and the levels appeared only mildly decreased compared to specific pathogen free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 1d, e). However, the presence of HMGB1 in the gut lumen was dependent on microbiota as HMGB1 staining was absent from the colon surface and HMGB1 protein was undetectable in stool from GF mice (Fig. 1d, f). HMGB1 was assayed in stool because GF mice produce very little colonic mucus.5, 14 Taken together, these data show that HMGB1 is released from IEC into the colonic mucus in response to the gut microbiota.\n\nHMGB1 prevents bacterial invasion into the inner mucus layer of the colon\n\nThe presence of HMGB1 in the gut lumen suggested that it could affect the gut microbiota, so we examined the influence of HMGB1 on the composition and behavior of the gut bacterial community. The normal colon boasts a diverse, abundant microbial community that is physically separated from the epithelial surface by the inner mucus barrier.8 In mice lacking mucosal HMGB1, this physical separation was essentially lost leading to close proximity of the microbial community to host tissue along with an increase in bacterial DNA associated with host tissue (Fig. 2a, b, c). The change in microbial biogeography was not due to a decrease in mucus production in ΔIEC mice (Extended data Fig. 2a, b, c). HMGB1 labeled microbes in the gut lumen, leading us to assess whether HMGB1 has direct effects on the microbiota (Extended data Fig 3a). The mucosal-associated microbial community did differ between WT and ΔIEC mice (Extended data Fig. 3b, c). Most notably, the taxonomic distinction normally present between stool and mucosal-associated bacteria was diminished in ΔIEC mice, reinforcing that HMGB1 is responsible for excluding microbiota from the inner mucus layer (Extended data Fig. 3d). However, taxonomic differences in mucosal-associated bacteria between the mouse genotypes were primarily appreciated at the strain level, suggesting that HMGB1 does not exert strong selection pressure on gut bacteria (Extended data Fig. 3e).\n\nWe considered that loss of HMGB1 might allow normally commensal microbes to penetrate colonic mucus. Mucus is thought to primarily act as a physical anti-microbial barrier in the colon.8 The most abundant protein in intestinal mucus, Mucin 2 (Muc2), is a large, heavily glycosylated protein that oligomerizes to form a dense meshwork that blocks bacterial movement.15 Additionally, oligosaccharides attached to Muc2 are the same oligosaccharides that bacterial adhesins bind to on the surface of host cells, so they serve as decoy adhesion sites and arrest movement through mucus.16, 17 Microbial invasion into mucus was limited when HMGB1 was present in mucus (Fig. 2d, e). E. coli was chosen for these studies because it is a well-characterized gut commensal organism that has been associated with colitis in animal models and in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.18 Exposure to HMGB1 also caused E. coli and complex microbiota to aggregate, similar to what has been reported for secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in small intestinal mucus (Fig. 2f, g, h).19 Aggregation by sIgA traps bacteria that enter small intestinal mucus and blocks their access to adhesion targets on host epithelial cells.20 Our findings suggest that HMGB1 is performing a similar function in colonic mucus. Microbes coming into contact with HMGB1 are aggregated and prevented from migrating through the mucus and interacting with the epithelial surface of the colon.\n\nHMGB1 binds and inactivates the bacterial adhesin FimH through an evolutionarily conserved amino acid sequence\n\nThe observation that HMGB1 binds directly to gut microbes in vivo and in vitro led us to hypothesize that HMGB1 targets one or more proteins expressed on the surface of bacteria. In our previous work, we identified an amino acid sequence shared between the mammalian proteins Beclin-1 and Autophagy protein 5 (Atg5) that was targeted by cytosolic HMGB1 during microbial stress.13 Querying the PROSITE database using a motif derived from this sequence yielded a large number of hits in known or predicted bacterial adhesins, including FimH, a component of type 1 fimbrial (T1F) adhesion and perhaps the best characterized bacterial adhesin (Fig. 3a).21, 22 FimH is a phase-inducible virulence factor that is carried by Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli, and has been implicated in infectious diarrheal diseases, urinary tract infections, extraintestinal infections, colorectal cancers, and inflammatory bowel diseases.22–27 Expression of FimH is low in E. coli when they are in a commensal state, but it is highly expressed by pathogenic E. coli strains or when commensal strains become virulent.28, 29 We first verified HMGB1 interaction with the conserved amino acid motif target of HMGB1 (ToH1) in FimH expressed by E. coli. Recombinant human HMGB1 (rHMGB1) bound to E. coli expressing WT FimH, but the numbers of bacteria positive for HMGB1 and the amount of HMGB1 bound to each individual bacterium were significantly lower when cells lacked FimH (ΔFimH) or expressed FimH mutated in ToH1 (ΔFimHMUT) (Fig. 3b, c and Extended data Fig. 4a, b, c, d). We next employed a label transfer assay to interrogate direct protein-protein interaction between HMGB1 and the IEC binding lectin domain of FimH (FimHLD). Label transferred to WT rFimHLD, but not rFimHLD mutated in ToH1, demonstrating that HMGB1 binds to FimH through ToH1 (Fig. 3d). Inclusion of mannose, the ligand bound by FimH for T1F adhesion, did not alter the efficiency of label transfer from rHMGB1 to WT rFimH. This and published structural data showing that ToH1 is distinct from the mannose binding site in FimH indicate that HMGB1 does not compete with mannose for binding to FimH.30 Auto transfer of label from rHMGB1 to itself was also observed in the WT rFimHLD reactions, supporting that HMGB1 forms an oligomer, most likely a dimer, when it interacts with FimH. This is consistent with the ability of HMGB1 to bind to FimH on more than one bacterial cell and cause aggregation, with literature reporting that HMGB1 dimerizes, and with concentrations of the two proteins that allow for maximal label transfer.31 We then examined whether HMGB1 could limit E. coli adhesion to host cells. rHMGB1 inhibited E. coli adhesion to IEC at a level that was equivalent to mannose and inhibited red blood cell (RBC) agglutination in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3e and Extended data Fig. 5). rHMGB1 also inhibited binding between rFimHLD and mannose showing that reduction in adhesion occurs due to the direct interaction between HMGB1 and FimH (Fig. 3f). Mutation of ToH1 in FimH severely impaired RBC agglutination by E. coli, implying that this sequence is necessary for the adhesin function of this protein (Fig. 3g).\n\nHMGB1 regulates expression of type 1 fimbrial adherence machinery in E. coli\n\nIn mice lacking IEC HMGB1, FimH protein levels were higher in colonic mucus and in tissue than WT littermates (Fig. 3h, i, j, k and Extended data Fig. 6a, b, c). This is consistent with our data demonstrating overall increased numbers of bacteria at the epithelial surface in ΔIEC mice. However, the increase in FimH could be due to increased numbers of bacteria expressing the same amount of FimH, increased FimH expression on each bacterium without a change in the number of bacteria, or both. We did not appreciate differences in relative abundance of E. coli or Enterobacteriaceae between the mouse genotypes by 16s rRNA gene sequencing and in vitro assays did not identify an effect of HMGB1 on E. coli colony forming units (Extended data Fig. 6d). Therefore, we considered that HMGB1 could regulate bacterial expression of FimH. Exposure to rHMGB1 decreased FimH expression by commensal E. coli in a dose-dependent manner. (Fig. 3l). In order to determine whether HMGB1 causes E. coli to turn off FimH expression or prevents bacteria from turning it on, we took advantage of a FimE knockout (ΔFimE) strain of E. coli.32 The genes required for type 1 fimbriae are arranged in a single operon that is regulated by a DNA switch region.33 The switch between fimbrial producing (FimON) and non-producing (FimOFF) states is regulated by two recombinases, FimB and FimE.33 When FimE is knocked out, bacteria can switch to FimON, but switching to FimOFF is impaired, providing a relative “counter” for the switch to FimON.33 Media conditioned by WT primary intestinal epithelial cells repressed FimON in comparison to media conditioned by cells derived from ΔIEC mice (Fig. 3m, n). Furthermore, addition of HMGB1 to the ΔIEC conditioned media repressed FimON similarly to WT media. Thus, these combined results indicate that HMGB1 in the environment binds to its evolutionarily conserved target sequence (ToH1) in FimH, inhibits FimH binding to its target ligand mannose, impairs T1F adhesion to host cells, and suppresses expression of this adhesion mechanism.\n\nHMGB1 mucosal defense is compromised in human ulcerative colitis\n\nWe previously reported intracellular HMGB1 deficiency in IEC from patients with IBD.13 Our discovery of HMGB1 mucosal defense released from IEC led us to suspect that this defense could also be compromised in IBD patients. There are two major subtypes of IBD, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.34 Ulcerative colitis affects only the colon and is thought to result from tissue damage initiated at the luminal surface of the epithelium.35 Surface-associated HMGB1 was generally easily appreciable in resected colon tissue from non-IBD patients, whereas tissue from UC patients commonly had very low levels of HMGB1 with a patchy appearance (Fig. 4a, b and Extended data Table 1). Surface associated HMGB1 was lowest in patients with severe inflammation and was absent in areas devoid of IEC (Fig. 4c). We assayed FimH in serial tissue sections from the same patients and found higher numbers of FimH positive bacteria in tissue from UC patients (Fig. 4d, e) However, FimH was not related to inflammation severity (Fig. 4f). When we plotted both surface HMGB1 and FimH from the same patient, UC patients clustered together with low HMGB1 and high FimH, while non-IBD patients clustered together with higher HMGB1 and low FimH (Fig. 4g). Mathematically modeling the relationship between HMGB1 and FimH demonstrated that the number of FimH positive bacteria in tissue was dependent on HMGB1 with levels of FimH increasing as HMGB1 decreased (Fig. 4h). Thus, UC is characterized by failure of HMGB1 defense with a concomitant increase in tissue-associated bacteria expressing the HMGB1 target protein FimH.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHigh mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an abundant, ubiquitously expressed protein that has intra- and extracellular functions in many different cell types.36 In the gut, HMGB1 is highly expressed in IEC and released into the lamina propria and gut lumen during intestinal infection or when the epithelium is damaged.37, 38 HMGB1 in the lamina propria is thought to act as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule (DAMP) and amplify innate immune responses to microbial signals.39 However, no functional role for HMGB1 in the gut lumen has been identified and HMGB1 in the feces is ascribed to passive release from damaged or dying cells.40–42 Here we report that HMGB1 is an active component of front-line mucosal barrier defense in the colon with direct and indirect effects to limit virulence of the gut microbiota. Our finding agrees with a previous proteomic survey that detected HMGB1 in mucus isolated by lightly scraping the mouse colon.43 It also complements a growing body of literature demonstrating that HMGB1 contributes to both inflammation and antibacterial defense during infection.44–46\n\nThe cross-kingdom protein-protein interaction between mammalian HMGB1 and bacterial FimH directly limits bacterial virulence by inactivating adhesion through FimH. Expression of T1F genes is also suppressed by HMGB1, suggesting that bacteria like E. coli regulate phase or virulence in response to HMGB1. It is possible that the presence of HMGB1 indicates to the bacteria that T1F adhesion will not be effective, or that there is another, as yet unknown effect of HMGB1 on bacterial fitness. Previous reports of HMGB1 effects on E. coli viability have been conflicting with one group reporting that HMGB1 kills E. coli and another that it does not.47, 48 We did not detect killing when E. coli were exposed to HMGB1. Instead, in our study, HMGB1 appeared to incapacitate virulence.\n\nThe relationship between low levels of HMGB1 and high levels of FimH positive bacteria was noted in both a murine model and in resected colonic tissue from ulcerative colitis patients in our study. Ulcerative colitis has long been linked to adherent microbes, but no single pathogen has been consistently identified across studies.49, 50 Our data could provide an explanation for this that is also consistent with the more recent data suggesting that normally commensal bacteria behave like pathogens (i.e. pathobionts) in ulcerative colitis.51 We propose that HMGB1, a critical component of host defense, fails in UC patients, allowing bacteria to switch on adhesion mechanisms normally suppressed by HMGB1 and adhere to host tissues. We do not mean to argue that UC is caused by E. coli. Rather, we propose that our data provide an explanation for why E. coli and potentially other bacteria adhere to intestinal tissue in UC.\n\nThe molecular target of HMGB1 in mucosal host defense is a small, evolutionarily conserved amino acid sequence found in adhesins from many different types of bacteria. Much like the ligands that activate pattern recognition receptors, ToH1 appears to be broadly utilized, critical for virulence, and difficult to modify without losing function.52 We employed E. coli FimH as the exemplar ToH1 positive protein in our mechanistic studies since FimH and T1F adhesion are extremely well characterized and have been implicated in intestinal diseases, including IBD.27, 29, 53, 54 The ToH1 sequence is identical and present in FimH from all E. coli genomes examined, including E. coli that cause infectious diarrheas, strains associated with chronic urinary tract infection, extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, and IBD-associated adherent and invasive E. coli. The discovery of ToH1 in FimH has important therapeutic implications since many studies have demonstrated that T1F adhesion is a preferred system for E. coli and preventing T1F adhesion has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for diseases caused by this organism.23, 27, 55–58 Bacterial adhesion mechanisms are considered high value targets for nearly all bacterial diseases since blocking adhesion prevents tissue damage, inflammation, and immune activation in disease models and patients.59, 60 ToH1 is not restricted to FimH and our experimental data indicate that HMGB1 broadly limits bacterial adhesion, suggesting that our finding may have applications across many different types of bacteria.\n\nOverall, this study demonstrates that HMGB1 actively enforces commensalism in gut bacteria and when it fails, microbes activate virulence and adhere to host tissues. HMGB1 precisely targets bacteria expressing adhesins containing a specific amino acid sequence that is necessary for adhesion to host cells. Therefore, only microbes that have activated virulence are subject to this defense, leaving non-virulent microbes untouched. Our discovery that HMGB1 targets E. coli FimH through ToH1 means that failure of this defense is likely relevant for multiple diseases where E. coli adheres to the gut epithelium, including infectious diarrheas, colorectal cancer, and IBD. We expect that the same principles of HMGB1 defense will also apply to other bacterial adhesins containing ToH1. However, some bacteria may have additional virulence elements that allow them to evade or degrade HMGB1. Ultimately, our findings represent an important advance toward a functional, rather than taxonomic, understanding of microbial virulence and disease mechanisms. They also provide a novel molecular target for diagnosis and treatment of bacterial disease that has the potential to identify and target only virulence expressing microbes, without regard to their antibiotic susceptibility.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nAMCO, BA, MB, XZ, YT, CMC, BM, HS, CF, ZD, and VL planned and performed experiments.

Messer, messerj3{at}ccf.org\n\nMethods\n\nMice\n\nAll animal protocols were approved by the University of Chicago or the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. All mice used in this study were on a C57BL/6 genetic background. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice were purchased from Jackson Labs. Germ-free (GF) mice were maintained under gnotobiotic conditions at the university of Chicago or Cleveland Clinic prior to euthanasia. Hmgb1fl/fl (WT) and Hmgb1fl/fl, Vil-CRE (ΔIEC) mice were originally created by Eugene Chang’s lab at the University of Chicago as previously described13. Mice were maintained under SPF conditions, apart from the GF mice. All animal experiments were performed at least two and in most instances three independent times using both age and sex-matched mice. When possible, littermate controls were used. Mice were between 6 and 12 weeks of age and both sexes were used for all experiments. Mice were housed under a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed standard laboratory chow.\n\nBacteria\n\nCulture\n\nAll E. coli strains were cultured under fimbriae inducing conditions. Strains were passaged twice under static conditions in nutrient broth at 37°C or passaged once on a nutrient agar plate incubated overnight at 37°C unless otherwise indicated. Media consisted of 0.5% Bacto Peptone, 0.3% Beef Extract, 0.5% NaCl and 1.5% agar (if needed), pH 6.8. See extended data table 2 for strain information.\n\nBW25113 mutant construction\n\nFull-length FimH was PCR amplified from BW25113 and cloned into the pGex6-1 vector using restriction digest cloning and the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. Mutation of the ToH1 sequence in FimH was done using two rounds of PCR. Mutation at desired region was introduced in the first round of PCR. Two fragments were generated using primer pairs 1) FimH-For and FimH-Mut1 and 2) FimH-Rev and FimH-Mut2. These two fragments were gel purified, combined, and were used as template for second round of PCR. FimH-For and FimH-Rev were used in the second round of PCR. The products were gel purified, digested by BamHI and XhoI, and cloned into BamHI and XhoI digested pGex6-1 vector. Wild type and mutant plasmids were verified by ability of transformed cells to grow on selection antibiotics and Sanger sequencing. E. coli knocked out for FimH (ΔFimH) were transformed with either plasmids containing wild type FimH (ΔFimHWT) or FimH mutated in ToH1 ((ΔFimHMut). See extended data table 3 for oligonucleotide information.\n\nSWW33 mutant construction\n\nApproximately 1kb homologous recombination arms flanking the sequence to be mutated/deleted (FimH), were PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of WT SWW33. These two arms were then fused together directly or fused to the mutated sequence through PCR. Using TAKARA infusion kit, the PCR-generated fragment was ligated to a suicide plasmid containing kanamycin resistance cassette, R6K origin, RP4 mob, and sacB gene.\n\nThis suicide plasmid was transformed into E. coli S17-1λpir through electroporation, and then transformed into E. coli SWW33 through conjugation. The successful transconjugants were obtained through plating the conjugation mixture on LB agar plates supplemented with kanamycin and ampicillin. The SWW33 strain that was transformed has an ampicillin resistant plasmid prior to conjugation. The purified transconjugants were then plated on LSW61 agar plates supplemented with 10% sucrose to select for the successful knock-in mutants, which were then purified and verified through PCR, Sanger sequencing, and their ability to grow in the presence of ampicillin but not kanamycin. The composition of the LSW agar plates (per liter) was 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 mL glycerol, 0.4 g NaCl, and 20 g agar. See extended data table 3 for oligonucleotide information.\n\nImmunostaining\n\nMurine colon tissue was obtained from 8 to12-week-old mice. Human colon samples were residual tissue from colonic resections performed for clinical care of disease (obtained under an existing IRB). Samples with no history of inflammatory bowel disease were used as controls.\n\nAll samples were fixed in methyl-Carnoy’s fixative (60% methanol, 30% chloroform,10% glacial acetic acid) for 3 hours at 4°C prior to transfer to 70% ethanol. Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized to water and slides underwent antigen retrieval in 10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20 pH 6.0 using a steamer for 20 minutes and were allowed to cool for 1 hour. They were blocked in serum-free protein block (Agilent, Dako, X0909) and stained with either 10 mg/mL Dylight 594 conjugated Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin I (UEA I), 0.17 mg/mL anti-HMGB1 (Abcam), 0.874 mg/mL anti-FimH polyclonal antibody (custom antibody produced by Genscript) or 0.96 mg/mL anti-Muc2 (Novus). 1mg/mL Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG was used as a secondary if needed. Tyramide SuperBoost (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to amplify signals from anti-FimH polyclonal antibody (custom antibody produced by Genscript). Slides were counterstained using 10 mg/mL bisBenzimide H 33258 dissolved in TBS for 20 minutes in the dark at room temperature then cover slipped. For peptide inhibition staining, 0.85 mg/mL of human HMGB1 peptide (Abcam), or 9 ug/mL of full-length FimH protein (antigen for custom antibody production, Genscript) was used.\n\nAll immunofluorescent sections were analyzed using either a widefield fluorescent microscope (Keyence BZ-800) or an inverted confocal microscope (40x/1.25 oil objective on a Leica TCS-SP8-AOBS inverted confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany)).\n\nEnzyme-linked immunoassay for HMGB1\n\nSamples used for measuring HMGB1 protein levels in the stool and colonic mucus were homogenized in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) containing complete protease inhibitor (Roche) and 100 mM PMSF. After centrifugation at top speed for 15 minutes, supernatants were collected and assayed for protein concentrations via BCA (Thermo Scientific). Samples were analyzed using an HMGB1 detection kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Chondrex).\n\nImmunoblot analysis\n\nBacterial and mucus samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer containing 10% b-mercaptoethanol. All samples were separated using NuPage Bis-Tris gels with MOPS or MES running buffers. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with FimH (Sokurenko Lab), GAPDH (Cell Signaling), 0.17 mg/mL anti-HMGB1 (Abcam), 0.6 mg/mL mouse anti-FimH (Sokurenko (mouse samples) or custom antibody produced by Genscript (bacterial samples), 0.1 mg/mL anti-GroEL (Enzo), or 680-labeled streptavidin overnight in 5% w/v non-fat dry milk Omniblock in 0.1% PBST or LI-COR Intercept PBS blocking buffer at 4°C62. After incubation and washing, 0.08 mg/mL of HRP conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, 0.2 ug/mL 680RD Streptavidin (LI-COR), or 0.2 ug/mL 800RD (LI-COR) anti-mouse secondary antibody was added to the blot and incubated for one hour. After washing, chemiluminescence signal was captured either by film or by using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP and fluorescent signal was detected using an LI-COR Odyssey CLX machine and LI-COR Acquisition software.\n\nFluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) to detect bacteria\n\nParaffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized to water. Permeabilization solution (5 mg/mL lysozyme, 0.05 M EDTA, 0.1 M Tris pH 7.4, PBS) was applied to tissue and incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes followed by a PBS wash. Slides were incubated in a hybridization solution (0.9 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris pH 7.4, 0.005 M EDTA, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 35% deionized formamide, 0.1% w/v BSA, water; pre-warmed to 46°C) for 1 hour in a hybridization oven at 46°C. A universal bacterial probe (EUB338 modified with a 5’ ATTO 647N dye) was denatured in the hybridization solution heated to 95°C for 2 minutes. The slides returned to the hybridization oven covered with 0.1 M probe in hybridization solution for 2.5 hours at 46°C. Slides were washed three times in stringency wash buffer 1 (2x SSC (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM Sodium Citrate, pH 7.0 pre-warmed to 46°C)). A secondary wash was performed three times in stringency wash buffer 2 (0.1x SSC (15 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Sodium Citrate, pH 7.0)) at room temperature and rinsed in PBS. Tissues were counterstained with 10 mg/mL bisBenzimide H 33258 dissolved in TBS for 20 minutes in the dark at room temperature and coverslipped. The distance between the bacteria and the epithelia was performed using ImageJ analysis software. See extended data table 3 for oligonucleotide information.\n\nBacterial flow cytometry\n\nHMGB1 binding to E. coli\n\nBacterial preparations of 3.2 x 108 (O.D. 0.4) E. coli were made from an overnight agar culture and incubated with 3 mM HMGB1 recombinant protein containing a HIS tag (Abclonal) or an hFc tag (Sino Biological) and reconstituted in 1mM DTT, 1mM EDTA, PBS buffer for two hours at 37°C. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA and blocked with 1% BSA in PBST for 1 hour. An unconjugated Anti-HIS antibody (Genscript) was added (5.0 mg/mL) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, cells were washed in PBS and secondary antibody (0.25 mg/test PE-Cy7) added for 1 hour at room temperature. Samples incubated with hFc tagged HMGB1 were incubated with PE anti-human IgG Fc recombinant antibody (0.25 mg/test) for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, cells were stained with 1 mM SYTO9. Bacterial suspensions were analyzed using an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Invitrogen) with FlowJo software (Tree Star).\n\nHMGB1 binding to ToH1\n\nBacterial preparations of 3.2 x 108 (O.D. 0.4) E. coli were made from an overnight agar culture and incubated with 3 mM HMGB1(R&D systems) diluted with protein block buffer (Dako) for 2 hours. Bacteria were centrifuged and washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% PFA for 10 minutes and washed with PBS for three more times. Samples were incubated with anti-FimH (Sokurenko) or rabbit anti-HMGB1 (Abcam) incubated overnight at 4°C62. Samples were washed and Invitrogen Alexa a10040, 1:1500 was added. Samples were analyzed using an Image Stream MarkII from Amnis (Luminex).\n\nIntestinal epithelial cell adhesion assay\n\nCaco2BBe1 cells were seeded onto 0.4 um inserts of a 6.5mm Transwell (Corning) at 250,000 cells per well and allowed to form a polarized monolayer. 72 hours prior to the adhesion assay, 100 ug/mL kifunensine (Cayman Chemicals) was supplemented to 1xDMEM + 10% FBS. Bacterial preparations grown from an overnight nutrient agar culture (1.6 x 108 (O.D. 0.2) E. coli per well) were suspended in serum-free 1xDMEM and incubated with 3 mM HMGB1 (R&D), 100 mM mannose (Sigma-Aldrich), or buffer vehicle (1mM DTT, 1mM EDTA, PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. The apical media from confluent Caco2BBe1 cells were removed and cells washed three times with serum-free 1xDMEM. Treatments were added to wells and cells incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were washed three times by adding serum-free 1xDMEM and letting the plate shake for 1 minute at 100 RPM between washes. Cells were dislodged with the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature then scraped and collected. Serial dilutions were performed and plated on LB agar plates incubated overnight at 37°C and counted the following day. Serial dilutions of the input E. coli were also plated and used to normalize the recovered E. coli.\n\nqRT-PCR\n\nRNA isolation was performed on colonic mucosal scrapings or bacterial lysates using TRIzol (Life Technologies) following the standard extraction procedure. Gene expression was determined using SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-rad) and a Roche LightCycler 480 System. See extended data table 3 for oligonucleotide information.\n\nqPCR\n\nDNA isolation was performed on mucosal scrapings or bacterial lysates using DNeasy Powerlyzer Microbial kit per the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR system. See extended data table 3 for oligonucleotide information.\n\nRed blood cell agglutination\n\nRed blood cell agglutination assays were performed as previously described63. Briefly, serial dilutions of E. coli were incubated with a 3% solution of washed erythrocytes in a round bottom 96 well plate. The wells were mixed by shaking the plate. The plate was incubated at room temperature and imaged 1 hour following shaking. The lowest bacterial number to achieve agglutination was used for the RaMGB1 inhibition assay. For the inhibition assay, E. coli were incubated with serial dilutions of HMGB1 recombinant protein (R&D systems) reconstituted in 1mM DTT, 1mM EDTA, PBS buffer and a 3% solution of washed erythrocytes. The wells were mixed by shaking the plate. The plate was incubated at room temperature and imaged 1 hour following shaking.\n\nBacterial aggregation Assays\n\nE. coli Aggregation\n\nBacteria expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were grown statically under antibiotic selection for two overnight passages before experimental treatment. The final overnight culture was adjusted to an O.D. of 0.4 and 100 mL was centrifuged into a pellet at 5000 RPM for 5 minutes. The supernatants were discarded, and cells were resuspended in TBS with 10 mM CaCl2. Bacteria were treated with either 3 mM recombinant HMGB1 (R&D systems) or buffer in a 50 mL reaction at 37°C for 2 hours. Cells were carefully dispensed onto glass coverslips, covered with a 0.15% agarose pad, and imaged using fluorescent microscope. The remaining bacterial samples were analyzed using an LSRFortessa (BD) with FlowJo software (Tree Star) following fixation with 4% PFA.\n\nColonic community microbiota aggregation\n\nColons from SPF C57BL/6J mice were excised and fileted open. An inoculating loop was used to scrape the contents into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube containing 1 mL PBS. After centrifugation at 400 G for 5 minutes, the supernatant was strained using a 70 mm cell strainer. The flow through was washed twice with PBS and once with TBS containing 10 mM CaCl2 at 10,000 x G for 2 minutes. After the third wash the sample was resuspended in 500 mL TBS/CaCl2. The sample was split into 100 uL aliquots and centrifuged at 10,000 x G for 2 minutes. rHMGB1 (R&D systems) was fluorescently labeled with AlexaFluor 647 labeling kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Bacteria were resuspended in either 3 mM of labeled rHMGB1 or buffer containing 1 mM SYTO 9 and incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Cells were carefully dispensed onto glass coverslips, covered with a 0.15% agarose pad, and imaged under fluorescence.\n\nRecombinant FimH lectin domain production\n\nRecombinant FimH lectin domain protein was produced in HM125 E. coli using plasmids provided by the Ernst Laboratory and following described procedures64. Purification of the K12 FimH lectin domain was performed as previously described65.\n\nFimH binding to mannose\n\nFimHLD (40 ug/mL) was incubated with serial dilutions of HMGB1 recombinant protein (R&D systems) for 1 hour at room temperature. A mannose coated 96-well plate was washed with 200 uL of 10 mM Tris + 0.05% tween pH 8.0, then the samples were applied to the plate. The plate was sealed and incubated overnight at 4°C. The plate was washed with PBST (0.1%) 4x and blocked with 1% BSA in PBST (0.1%) for 1 hour at room temperature. Then the plate was washed with PBST (0.1%) 4x and the primary anti-HIS antibody was diluted in 0.1% BSA in PBST at a concentration of 5 ug/mL and added to the plate. This was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plate was then washed with PBST (0.1%) 4x and the secondary anti-mouse HRP antibody was added to the plate at 0.16 ug/mL diluted in 0.1% BSA in PBST. The plate was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The plate was washed with PBST (0.1%) 4x and TMB solution was added to the wells. The reaction was quenched with 0.5M sulfuric acid and read at 450 nm on a spectrophotometer.\n\nE. coli killing by HMGB1\n\nBacterial preparations of 6.4 x 108 (O.D. 0.8) E. coli were made from twice passaged nutrient broth cultures and incubated with 3 uM HMGB1 recombinant protein (R&D systems) reconstituted in 1mM DTT, 1mM EDTA, PBS buffer for 2 hours at 37°C. Following incubation, cells were serially diluted, plated onto LB agar plates and colonies were counted the following day after incubation at 37°C.\n\nFimH expression in E. coli exposed to HMGB1\n\nBacterial preparations of 3.2 x 108 (O.D. 0.4) E. coli were made from an overnight agar culture and incubated with 3 μM HMGB1 recombinant protein (R&D systems) reconstituted in 1mM DTT, 1mM EDTA, PBS buffer for 2 hours at 37°C. RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nFim switch PCR assay\n\nAfter shaking at 255 rpm for two overnight passages in broth, E. coli preparations of 6.4 x 108 cells/mL (O.D. 0.8) were made. The bacteria were treated with 1/100 dilution of conditioned organoid media with (WT) or without (ΔIEC) HMGB1 for 18 hours at 37°C statically. Pilot assays with media derived from small and large intestine derived organoids showed similar results, so additional assays were performed with small intestinal derived organoids since the media contained fewer additives. The conditioned organoid media collected from small intestinal organoids before passaging comprised of Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1x L-Glutamine (Life Technologies), 10 mM HEPES buffer (Life Technologies), 1x penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies), 1x N2 supplement (Life Technologies), 1x B-27 Supplement Minus Vitamin A (Life Technologies), 50 ng/mL murine Epidermal Growth Factor (Peprotech), 100 ng/mL Noggin (Peprotech), 1 μM Jagged 1 (Anaspec), 10 nM Y-27632 (Cayman Chemical Company), and 100 ng/mL R-spondin 1 (Peprotech). This was concentrated using a 3 kDa MWCO filter insert with PBS as the diluent. Bacterial DNA was extracted using DNeasy PowerLyzer Microbial Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR amplification was performed as previously described66. Phase-ON and Phase-OFF fmS PCR product band intensities were standardized against the fsZ amplification product using ImageJ software. See extended data table 3 for oligonucleotide information.\n\nQuantification of FimH positive bacteria in IF images\n\nImage-Pro Plus 7.0 was used for image operations and measurements. Images were spatially calibrated to units of micrometers and processed as gray values. Background subtraction commensurate with secondary antibody negative controls were applied across the dataset. Semi-automatic counting was performed by manually setting the intensity range overlapped with images. Objects and measurements were collected across five image fields per sample. Measurements of each object were taken to sort and describe post hoc. Two independent people manually applied the intensity ranges with little deviation and similar results. The five image counts were averaged to represent each sample in units of objects per field.\n\nQuantification of surface associated HMGB1 in IF images\n\nLeica Application Suite (version 3.7.5 or higher) was used for measuring fluorescence intensity in images gathered on a Leica TCS-SP8-AOBS inverted confocal microscope. Regions of interest were drawn around representative surface epithelium and maximized area. Mean fluorescent values (RFU/um^2) were gathered in each image. In background subtraction from the secondary antibody, only negative controls were applied across the dataset. An average of five image values were used to represent each sample. Two independent people identified representative regions of interest (surface epithelium) to collect fluorescent values with similar results.\n\nMurine mucus isolation\n\nMucus isolation was performed as previously described67.\n\nMurine mucosal scrape\n\nColons from mice were excised, fileted open and the contents were washed off. One mL of PBS was added to the colonic tissue in a 1.5. mL centrifuge tube and vortexed vigorously for 2 minutes. The tissue was removed and the mucus containing mixture was centrifuged at top speed for 5 minutes. The semi-transparent mucus layer on top of the dark pellet was removed and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. 20 mL was saved for BCA. The remainder was centrifuged again and the mucus containing pellet was solubilized in Laemmli buffer for immunoblotting at sample buffer for ELISA.\n\nMucus invasion assay\n\nBacteria expressing GFP were grown statically overnight in broth for two passages and made into preparations of 8 x 108 cells/mL (O.D. 1.0). These E. coli preparations were used to fill the middle channel of a chemotaxis µ-Slide (Ibidi). Mucus isolated from WT and DIEC mice were added to opposing reservoirs of the same chamber and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Five representative images of fluorescent bacteria invading mucus samples were captured along the leading mucosal edge, proximal to the middle channel of the chamber. These assays were performed at least three times with different bacterial preparations. Any and all image processing settings to reduce background signal were applied across the whole dataset. Measuring the percent relative fluorescence in mucus was performed by using the ImageJ analysis software. After spatially calibrating the image set units to known micrometers, a region of interest was applied beginning at the leading mucosal edge, spanning its full length, and approximately 300 mm deep in each image; approximately totaling 170,000 um2; or the maximum area common to all images. Integrated density values were collected and divided by the area of the region of interest (ROI) to account for possible variances upon re-drawing ROIs. Those mean fluorescence values were averaged between the five images and used to represent each sample within the chamber slide.\n\nGiven that bacteria had an equal probability of traveling in either well’s direction, the mean fluorescence of each well was compared to the other as a proportion of the total fluorescence of the reaction chamber. Two independent people identified regions of interest to collect fluorescent values with similar results.\n\nSulfo-SBED label transfer\n\nThe label transfer reaction was performed at previously described68. Briefly, rHMGB1 (R&D Biosystems) was treated as the “bait protein” and was reconstituted to 0.2 mg/mL in sterile PBS. Sulfo-SBED was calculated to be added at a 3-molar excess over the purified HMGB1. Sulfo-SBED was dissolved in DMSO to 10 mg/ml and added to the rHMGB1. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for one hour protected from light. Then labeled protein was added to a desalting column (Thermo Fisher #89849) equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl; pH 7.3 to remove the excess crosslinker and leave the labeled purified HMGB1 in the proper reaction buffer. Sulfo-SBED labeled HMGB1 and unlabeled FimHLD were allowed to incubate together for 2 hours at room temperature protected from light to ensure interaction. The molar ratio used of FimH:HMGB1 was 2.2 mM FimH: 4 mM HMGB1 and was performed in a 50 ml reaction. To crosslink the samples, reactions were moved to a clear 96-well polypropylene low binding plate placed 5 cm from the UV light source (Stratalinker) and exposed to 538 nm wavelengths for 8 minutes on ice. Crosslinked reactions were moved into fresh tubes with the addition of a DTT sample buffer to a final DTT concentration of 100 mM to complete disulfide bond reduction and transfer the biotin label. Samples were heated to 70° C for 10 minutes and analyzed by immunoblot.\n\nMicrobiome studies\n\nMicrobiome sampling\n\nLittermate mice of both sexes and genotypes were separated into group housing by genotype at weaning. Soiled bedding from mice of both genotypes was collected, mixed, and distributed across all of the cages at the time of separation. At 20 weeks of age, fresh stool samples were collected and the mice were sacrificed for collection of mucosal scrapings. Samples were submitted to the Environmental Sample Preparation and Sequencing Facility at Argonne National Laboratory for analysis of 16S rRNA.\n\nBioinformatics\n\nIndividual fastq files without non-biological nucleotides were processed using Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm (DADA) pipeline69. The output of the dada2 pipeline (feature table of amplicon sequence variants (an ASV table)) was processed for alpha and beta diversity analysis using phyloseq70, and microbiomeSeq (http://www.github.com/umerijaz/microbiomeSeq) packages in R. Alpha diversity estimates were measured within group categories using estimate richness function of the phyloseq package. Multidimensional scaling (MDS, i.e., PCoA) was performed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix between groups and visualized using the ggplot2 package71. As appropriate, we adjusted for multiple comparisons using the BH FDR method while performing multiple testing on taxa abundance across groups72. An analysis of variance across the groups for α-diversity was performed. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was performed on all principal coordinates obtained during PCoA. Linear regression (parametric) and Wilcoxon (non-parametric) were performed on ASV abundances vs metadata variable levels (e.g., diet components) using R base functions.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Dr. Beat Ernst and Laboratory for the kind gift of plasmids for recombinant production of the FimH lectin domain, Dr. Harry Mobley and Laboratory for the kind gift of T1F phase-locked E. coli, Dr. Evgeni Sokurenko and Laboratory for the kind gift of antibodies that recognize FimH, Dr. George Georgiou for the kind gift of HM125 E. coli, Dr. Michael Wannemuehler for the kind gift of SWW33 E. coli, and Dr. William Schwan for technical assistance.
