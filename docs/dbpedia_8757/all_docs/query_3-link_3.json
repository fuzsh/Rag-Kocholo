It is a subclinical condition until complicated by fracture(s). These fractures place an enormous medical and personal burden on individuals who suffer from them and take a significant economic toll. Any new fracture in an adult aged 50 years or older signifies imminent elevated risk for subsequent fractures, particularly in the year following the initial fracture. What a patient perceives as an unfortunate accident may be seen as a sentinel event indicative of bone fragility and increased future fracture risk even when the result of considerable trauma. Clinical or subclinical vertebral fractures, the most common type of osteoporotic fractures, are associated with a 5-fold increased risk for additional vertebral fractures and a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for fractures at other sites. Untreated osteoporosis can lead to a vicious cycle of recurrent fracture(s), often resulting in disability and premature death. In appropriate patients, treatment with effective antifracture medication prevents fractures and improves outcomes. Primary care providers and medical specialists are critical gatekeepers who can identify fractures and initiate proven osteoporosis interventions. Osteoporosis detection, diagnosis, and treatment should be routine practice in all adult healthcare settings. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF) – formerly the National Osteoporosis Foundation – first published the Clinician’s Guide in 1999 to provide accurate information on osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Since that time, significant improvements have been made in diagnostic technologies and treatments for osteoporosis. Despite these advances, a disturbing gap persists in patient care. At-risk patients are often not screened to establish fracture probability and not educated about fracture prevention. Most concerning, the majority of highest risk women and men who have a fracture(s) are not diagnosed and do not receive effective, FDA-approved therapies. Even those prescribed appropriate therapy are unlikely to take the medication as prescribed. The Clinician’s Guide offers concise recommendations regarding prevention, risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years and older. It includes indications for bone densitometry as well as fracture risk thresholds for pharmacologic intervention. Current medications build bone and/or decrease bone breakdown and dramatically reduce incident fractures. All antifracture therapeutics treat but do not cure the disease. Skeletal deterioration resumes sooner or later when a medication is discontinued—sooner for nonbisphosphonates and later for bisphosphonates. Even if normal BMD is achieved, osteoporosis and elevated risk for fracture are still present. The diagnosis of osteoporosis persists even if subsequent DXA T-scores are above − 2.5. Ongoing monitoring and strategic interventions will be necessary if fractures are to be avoided. In addition to pharmacotherapy, adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol intake, weight-bearing and resistance-training exercise, and fall prevention are included in the fracture prevention armamentarium. Where possible, recommendations in this guide are based on evidence from RCTs; however, relevant published data and guidance from expert clinical experience provides the basis for recommendations in those areas where RCT evidence is currently deficient or not applicable to the many osteoporosis patients not considered for RCT participation due to age and morbidity.\n\nKeywords: Fractures, FRAX®, Osteoporosis, Primary care management of osteoporosis, Vertebral imaging, Fracture risk stratification, Bisphosphonate holiday, Novel antifracture therapies (romosozumab, denosumab, abaloparatide)\n\nSynopsis of major recommendations to the clinician\n\nThese recommendations apply to postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years and older.\n\nUniversal recommendations\n\nCounsel individual patients on their risk for osteoporosis, fractures, and potential consequences of fractures (functional deterioration, loss of independence, increased mortality).\n\nRecommend a diet with adequate total calcium intake (1000 mg/day for men aged 50–70 years; 1200 mg/day for women ≥ 51 years and men ≥ 71 years), incorporating calcium supplements if intake is insufficient.\n\nMonitor serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.\n\nMaintain serum vitamin D sufficiency (≥ 30 ng/mL but below ≤ 50 ng/mL) [1–3]. Prescribe supplemental vitamin D (800–1000 units/day) as needed for individuals aged 50 years and older to achieve a sufficient vitamin D level. Higher doses may be necessary in some adults, especially those with malabsorption. (Note: in healthy individuals a serum 25(OH) vitamin D level ≥ 20 ng/mL may be sufficient, but in the setting of known or suspected metabolic bone disease ≥ 30 ng/mL is appropriate.)\n\nIdentify and address modifiable risk factors associated with falls, such as sedating medications, polypharmacy, hypotension, gait or vision disorders, and out-of-date prescription glasses.\n\nProvide guidance for smoking cessation, and avoidance of excessive alcohol intake; refer for care as appropriate.\n\nCounsel or refer patients for instruction on balance training, muscle-strengthening exercise, and safe movement strategies to prevent fracture(s) in activities of daily life.\n\nIn community-dwelling patients, refer for at-home fall hazard evaluation and remediation.\n\nIn post-fracture patients who are experiencing pain, prescribe over-the-counter analgesia, heat/ice home care, limited bed rest, physical therapy, and alternative non-pharmacologic therapies when appropriate. In cases of intractable or chronic pain, refer to a pain specialist or physiatrist.\n\nCoordinate post-fracture patient care via fracture liaison service (FLS) and multidisciplinary programs in which patients with recent fractures are referred for osteoporosis evaluation and treatment, rehabilitation, and transition management.\n\nDiagnostic assessment recommendations\n\nInvestigate any broken bone in adulthood as suspicious for osteoporosis, regardless of cause [4, 5].\n\nMeasure height annually, preferably with a wall-mounted stadiometer (without shoes).\n\nRecord history of falls.\n\nPerform BMD testing in the following:\n\n–Women aged ≥ 65 years and men aged ≥ 70 years.\n\n–Postmenopausal women and men aged 50–69 years, based on risk profile.\n\n–Postmenopausal women and men aged ≥ 50 years with history of adult-age fracture.\n\n–DXA facilities that employ accepted quality assurance measures.\n\n–The same facility and on the same densitometry device for each test whenever possible.\n\nMaintain diagnosis of osteoporosis in patient diagnosed by fracture in adulthood or T-score (− 2.5 or below), even if subsequent DXA T-score is above − 2.5.\n\nTo detect subclinical vertebral fractures, perform vertebral fracture imaging (X-ray or DXA vertebral fracture assessment) in the following:\n\n–Women aged 65 years and older if T-score is less than or equal to − 1.0 at the femoral neck [6].\n\n–Women aged 70 years or older and men aged 80 years or older if T-score is less than or equal to − 1.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck.\n\n–Men aged 70–79 years if T-score is less than or equal to − 1.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck.\n\n–Postmenopausal women and men aged ≥ 50 years with the following specific risk factors:\n\n○Fracture(s) during adulthood (any cause).\n\n○Historical height loss of ≥ 1.5 in. (defined as the difference between the current height and peak height) [7].\n\n○Prospective height loss of ≥ 0.8 in. (defined as the difference between the current height and last documented height measurement) [7].\n\n○Recent or ongoing long-term glucocorticoid treatment.\n\n○Diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism [8].\n\nRule out secondary causes of bone loss, osteoporosis, and/or fractures.\n\nIn appropriate untreated postmenopausal women, selectively measure bone turnover markers to help gauge rapidity of bone loss.\n\nPrior to elective orthopedic procedures, evaluate skeletal health and measure BMD as indicated by risk profile (e.g., inflammatory arthritis, osteoarthritis, chronic kidney disease, or adverse events from surgery or other risk factors) [9–11].\n\nPharmacologic treatment recommendations\n\nNo uniform recommendation applies to all patients. Management plans must be individualized.\n\nCurrent FDA-approved pharmacologic options for osteoporosis are as follows:\n\n–Bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid)\n\n–Estrogen-related therapy (ET/HT, raloxifene conjugated estrogens/ bazedoxifene)\n\n–Parathyroid hormone analogs (teriparatide, abaloparatide)\n\n–RANK-ligand inhibitor (denosumab)\n\n–Sclerostin inhibitor (romosozumab)\n\n–Calcitonin salmon\n\nConsider initiating pharmacologic treatment in postmenopausal women and men ≥ 50 years of age who have the following:\n\n–Primary fracture prevention:\n\n○T-score ≤ − 2.5 at the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, 33% radius (some uncertainty with existing data) by DXA.\n\n○Low bone mass (osteopenia: T-score between − 1.0 and − 2.5) at the femoral neck or total hip by DXA with a 10-year hip fracture risk ≥ 3% or a 10-year major osteoporosis-related fracture risk ≥ 20% (i.e., clinical vertebral, hip, forearm, or proximal humerus) based on the US-adapted FRAX® model.\n\n–Secondary fracture prevention:\n\n○Fracture of the hip or vertebra regardless of BMD [4, 5].\n\n○Fracture of proximal humerus, pelvis, or distal forearm in persons with low bone mass (osteopenia: T-score between − 1.0 and − 2.5). The decision to treat should be individualized in persons with a fracture of the proximal humerus, pelvis, or distal forearm who do not have osteopenia or low BMD [12, 13].\n\nInitiate antiresorptive therapy following discontinuation of denosumab, teriparatide, abaloparatide, or romosozumab.\n\nMonitoring patients and treatment response\n\nPerform BMD testing 1 to 2 years after initiating or changing medical therapy for osteoporosis and at appropriate intervals thereafter according to clinical circumstances.\n\n–More frequent BMD testing may be warranted in higher-risk individuals (multiple fractures, older age, very low BMD).\n\n–Less frequent BMD testing may be warranted as follow-up for patients with initial T-scores in the normal or slightly below normal range (osteopenia) and for patients who have remained fracture free on treatment.\n\nIn patients receiving osteoporosis pharmacologic treatment:\n\n–Routinely reassess risk for fracture, patient satisfaction and adherence with therapy, and need for continued or modified treatment. The appropriate interval between initiation and reassessment differs with agent prescribed.\n\n–Serially measure changes in BMD at lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck; if lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable or according to clinical judgment, consider monitoring at 33% distal radius.\n\n–Reassess patient and BMD status for consideration of a drug holiday after 5 years of oral and 3 years of intravenous bisphosphonate in patients who are no longer at high risk of fracture (T-score ≥ − 2.5, no new fractures) [14].\n\n–At each healthcare encounter, ask open-ended questions about treatment to elicit patient feedback on possible side effects and concerns. Communicate risk-benefit trade-offs and confirm understanding: both the risk of adverse events with treatment (usually very low) and risk of fractures and their negative consequences without treatment (usually much higher).\n\nOsteoporosis: impact and overview\n\nOsteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone density, deterioration of bone tissue, disrupted bone microarchitecture, compromised bone strength, and fracture. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic classification, osteoporosis is defined by BMD at the hip or lumbar spine that is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below the mean BMD of a young adult reference population (T-score).\n\nOsteoporosis is a risk factor for fracture, just as hypertension is for stroke and hypercholesterolemia is for heart disease. While risk is highest in individuals with extremely low BMD, the majority of fractures occur in patients with T-scores better than − 2.5. Non-BMD factors contribute to fracture risk, such as falls, frailty, and poor bone quality.\n\nScope of the problem\n\nOsteoporosis affects an enormous number of people, both men and women, of all races. Among Caucasian adults in the USA aged 50 years and older, about 50% of women and 20% of men will experience an osteoporotic fracture in their remaining lifetime [15]. Rates of fracture differ by ethnic/racial population and skeletal site.\n\nFor fracture at any site in women, after adjusting for BMD, weight, and other covariates, non-Hispanic white and Hispanic-American women have the highest risk for fracture, followed by Native Americans, African Americans, and Asian Americans [16, 17]. For hip fracture in men, the age-adjusted incidence was highest for non-Hispanic white men, similar among Hispanic-American and black men, and lowest in Asian men.\n\nIn a 2014 cross-sectional analysis of data from five large independent cohorts (in the USA and Asia), prevalence of self-reported non-traumatic fracture in men was non-Hispanic white American 17.1%; Afro-Caribbean, 5.5%; African American, 15.1%; Hispanic-American, 13.7%; Asian American, 10.5%; Hong Kong Chinese, 5.6%, and Korean, 5.1% [18] .\n\nMany factors are thought to contribute to these divergent fracture rates including BMD, cortical thickness, access to healthcare, comorbidities (such as diabetes), and skeletal geometry (e.g., hip axis length) [20]. Fracture rates do not track uniformly with the risk of osteoporosis among different racial/ethnic groups. For example, while fewer African Americans have osteoporosis, those diagnosed with osteoporosis experience fracture rates comparable to Non-Hispanic Whites and experience worse overall post-fracture outcomes [19]. Native Americans have BMD similar to Non-Hispanic Whites but higher rates of hip fracture, possibly reflecting challenges with screening, nutrition, lifestyle, and follow-up (Fig. ).\n\nBased on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III), BHOF previously estimated that more than 10.2 million Americans have osteoporosis and an additional 43.4 million have low bone density [21]. Prevalence of fractures continues to increase as the population ages. It is currently projected that 12.3 million Americans have osteoporosis [22]. At present the 2 million new cases of osteoporotic fracture per year exceeds the annual number of new cases of myocardial infarction, breast cancer, and prostate cancer combined [23–25]. Annual fracture incidence is expected to increase 68%, to 3.2 million by 2040 [26].\n\nOsteoporosis remains a disease that is underdiagnosed and undertreated despite effective antifracture interventions and the potentially lethal consequences of fractures [27]. Hip fractures significantly increase risk of death in the year following fracture and are highly predictive of additional fractures. Nonetheless, as many as 80–95% of patients in some practice settings are discharged following hip fracture repair with no antifracture treatment or management plan [28–30].\n\nCrisis in osteoporosis patient care\n\nThe benefits of timely diagnosis and treatment have been well documented. Treatment reduces fracture incidence, forestalling injury, disability, and excess mortality. This effect is seen in Medicare claims analyses demonstrating a significant drop in age-adjusted risk for hip fracture in the ten years between 2002 and 2012. This decade-long decline coincided with the advent of bone density testing and application of effective osteoporosis therapies.\n\nHowever, after declining for decades, incidence rates plateaued between 2013 and 2015 (Fig. ) [31]. Although more data are needed to draw causal conclusions, it is likely that multiple factors have contributed. In the USA, patient access to osteoporosis care has declined. There are fewer office-based DXA facilities performing smaller numbers of DXA studies. Fewer women and men are diagnosed with osteoporosis and/or treated to prevent fractures. Not surprisingly, we have seen an uptick in fractures.\n\nThe osteoporosis treatment gap (difference between number meeting treatment indications and number receiving treatment) is recognized globally as a crisis in patient care [21, 32, 33]. Since many factors contribute to this crisis, multifactorial approaches should be considered to reverse the trend, including cultivating trust in at-risk patients; generating more data on comparative effectiveness and safety of current osteoporosis drugs; engaging physicians, governmental, and public health organizations; improving insurance coverage for key fracture prevention services, including FLS programs; and adopting quality measures to incentivize clinicians, hospitals, and health systems to routinely screen and treat high-risk patients.\n\nMedical impact\n\nFractures and their complications are the clinical sequelae of osteoporosis. The most common fractures are those of the vertebrae (lumbar spine), proximal femur (hip), and distal forearm (wrist). Most fractures in older adults are due at least in part to low bone mass, even when they result from considerable trauma. All fractures are associated with some degree of low BMD and increased risk of subsequent fracture in older adults [5]. In fact, a large cohort study found high-trauma and low-trauma fractures to be comparably predictive of low BMD and elevated future fracture risk [4].\n\nA recent fracture at any major skeletal site in an adult ≥ 50 years of age should be considered a sentinel event that indicates urgent need for further assessment and treatment. Fractures of fingers, toes, face, and skull are not considered osteoporotic fractures since they are typically traumatic and unrelated to bone fragility.\n\nFractures may be followed by full recovery or by chronic pain, disability, and premature death. Hip, vertebral, and distal radius fractures lead to a substantial reduction in quality of life, with the greatest hardship among hip fracture patients [34]. Low-energy fractures of the pelvis and/or humerus are common in people with osteoporosis and contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. Psychosocial symptoms, most notably depression and loss of self-esteem, are common consequences of fracture, as patients grapple with pain, physical limitations, and loss of independence.\n\nHip fractures\n\nHip fractures are associated with 8.4–36% excess mortality at 1 year, with higher mortality in men than in women [26, 35]. Hip fracture can have devastating impacts on a patient’s life. Approximately 20% of hip fracture patients require long-term nursing home care, and 60% do NOT fully regain pre-fracture independence [27]. In addition, hip fractures are associated with a 2.5-fold increased incidence of secondary fractures [36].\n\nVertebral fractures\n\nAlthough the majority of vertebral fractures are subclinical, they can cause pain, disability, deformity, and premature death [37]. Pain and postural changes associated with multiple vertebral compression fractures (kyphosis) can limit mobility and independent function, resulting in significantly diminished quality of life [38]. Multiple thoracic fractures can cause restrictive lung disease. Lumbar fractures can alter abdominal anatomy, leading to constipation, abdominal pain, early satiety, and weight loss. Vertebral fractures, whether clinically apparent or silent, are associated with a 5-fold increased risk for additional vertebral fractures and a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for fractures at other sites.\n\nWrist fractures\n\nWrist fractures are five times more common in women than men. They tend to occur earlier in life than other fractures (i.e., between 50 and 60 years of age). When wrist fractures are recognized as evidence of bone fragility and appropriate osteoporosis treatment is prescribed, future fractures could be avoided. While less disabling than hip or vertebral fractures, wrist fractures can be equally detrimental to quality of life, causing pain and limiting activities necessary for independent living.\n\nWrist fractures are strongly predictive of future fractures, as demonstrated in longitudinal studies of women in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) and men in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOs) [39–41]. Among recipients of Medicare, increased risk of other fractures following a wrist fracture (regardless of BMD) is comparable to risk following hip or spine fracture in the year after the index event [12]. Low BMD at spine, hip, or forearm is a risk factor for wrist fractures in women and men; however, BMD alone is an imperfect predictor of fracture. In women with forearm fractures, advanced imaging with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) has identified poor bone quality in fracturing women and girls compared with their nonfracturing peers at similar BMDs: lower total and trabecular bone density, decreased trabecular number and thickness, and lower cortical density and thickness. These differences in bone quality remained after adjusting for age and BMD at the hip and 33% radius [42].\n\nUnfortunately, rates of evaluation and treatment for osteoporosis after wrist fractures are low in women and even lower in men [43]. Seventy-nine percent of adult male wrist fracture patients in one prospective, randomized study did not receive a bone density test following fracture repair [44]. This is significant because patients who received BMD measurement were more likely to be prescribed effective antifracture therapy.\n\nAs the population ages, it is critical for clinicians to intervene after a sentinel fracture. Appropriate, timely intervention offers the best opportunity to prevent the cycle of recurrent fractures, disability, and premature death in these patients [45].\n\nEconomic toll\n\nThe personal and economic costs of fractures are enormous. Fractures result in more than 432,000 hospital admissions, almost 2.5 million medical office visits, and about 180,000 nursing home admissions in the US [26]. Annual fracture-related costs are expected to increase from $57 billion to over $95 billion by 2040 [26]. This heavy toll could be significantly reduced with routine use of effective treatments and screenings, including VFA in women aged 65 and older with osteopenia (T-score ≤ − 1.0) [23, 27].\n\nBasic pathophysiology\n\nThe human skeleton is comprised of living tissue. Critical to locomotion, skeletal bone houses much of the hematopoietic system and is the major repository for calcium and phosphorus—minerals essential to multiple physiologic systems. Constant serum calcium and adequate cellular calcium and phosphorus are maintained by a complex system of regulatory hormones that act directly on bone and indirectly on other tissues, such as the intestine and kidney. These demands can challenge skeletal equilibrium. When inadequate mineral is present in serum, it is withdrawn from skeletal stores. Over time, continued removal of bone tissue degrades skeletal microarchitecture thereby elevating risk for fractures that occur spontaneously or from minimal trauma.\n\nSkeletal lifecycle\n\nDuring childhood and adolescence, bones undergo a process called modeling, during which new bone is formed at one site and old bone is removed from another site within the same bone. This process enables individual bones to develop in size, shape, and position. Childhood and adolescence are critical periods of skeletal accrual. This is particularly important for girls, who acquire 40–50% of their total bone mass during early teen years.\n\nDuring rapid skeletal growth in childhood and adolescence, it takes several months to mineralize the protein scaffolding for new bone, called osteoid. This lag between formation and mineralization produces periods of relatively low bone density and increased propensity to fracture, particularly between ages 10 and 14 years [46]. In the early 20s, fracture rates level off with attainment of peak bone mass. Mineral density stabilizes in most adults by their early 40s, when it begins a gradual decline, which accelerates at menopause in women (~ 2%/year for the 10 years following menopause) [47]. Age-related bone loss thins trabecular bone and increases cortical porosity, creating the preconditions for future fragility and fractures.\n\nGenetic factors appear to account for 60-80% of total adult bone mass [48]. Substantial contributions are made by multiple modifiable factors that include nutrition, physical activity, smoking, chronic illness, and bone-damaging medications. Suboptimal bone acquisition is associated with fracture earlier in adulthood. Conversely, high peak adult bone mass, all other things being equal, protects against osteoporosis later in life.\n\nBone remodeling\n\nThe skeleton responds dynamically to hormonal, mechanical, and pharmacologic stimuli through the resorption and formation processes of bone remodeling, or turnover. After epiphyseal closure, the skeleton repairs damage through bone remodeling, which occurs on bone surfaces throughout the skeleton. The majority of bone surface area resides in trabecular bone, the resilient bony latticework predominantly found inside vertebrae. Remodeling is initiated by bone-resorbing cells, osteoclasts, that breakdown and remove damaged bone in a process called resorption. Excavated bone is replaced with new bone produced by osteoblasts.\n\nThe mechanisms that regulate bone formation involve complex interactions but are mediated, in part, by cells called osteocytes. Osteocytes play a role in both bone modeling and remodeling. For example, at sites of specific mechanical strain, osteocytes produce less sclerostin, a cytokine and powerful inhibitor of bone formation. The result is stimulation of new bone formation. In several RCTs, a fully human neutralizing sclerostin antibody drug called romosozumab has blocked sclerostin, thereby markedly increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption [49].\n\nOsteocytes make RANK-ligand (RANKL) a cytokine required for osteoclast formation. The fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL, denosumab, is a potent antiresorptive drug that directly inhibits osteoclast formation, causes apoptosis of mature osteoclasts, and leads to decreased bone resorption and higher BMD. In addition to these agents, the anabolic PTH analogs (teriparatide and abaloparatide) affect remodeling- and modeling-based bone formation, leading to a net increase in BMD (see US FDA-Approved Drugs for Osteoporosis).\n\nPathogenesis of osteoporosis\n\nIn healthy young adults, the bone turnover cycle is balanced such that resorption is matched by formation. Bone remodeling accelerates in settings of chronic disease, aging, and a variety of mechanical, hormonal, and biochemical exposures such as glucocorticoids. Over time, this process leads to greater and greater deficits in mineralized bone.\n\nAccelerated bone turnover affects cortical and trabecular bone somewhat differently. Bone resorption takes place on the surface of the bone. Because of its higher ratio of surface area to mass, trabecular bone is depleted more rapidly than cortical bone. With each remodeling cycle, there is a net loss of bone tissue. When bone remodeling rates increase—for example, in the setting of estrogen deficiency at menopause—bone loss is seen first at skeletal sites rich in trabecular bone, such as the spine, while sites that have a mix of cortical and trabecular bone, such as the hip, develop clinically apparent loss of bone later (Fig. ).\n\nDiagnostic considerations\n\nBHOF recommends a multimodal, comprehensive approach to diagnosis of osteoporosis: detailed assessment of individual fracture risk, personal and family history, physical examination, and in patients with suggestive presentations (such as height loss, back pain, and/or fractures), focused studies to rule out secondary causes of bone fragility and vertebral imaging to detect prevalent fractures.\n\nThis is a process of screening and evaluation. Fracture risk increases exponentially with age and BMD declines with age. Screening of all older persons on this basis is appropriate. In persons with fractures or conditions associated with elevated fracture risk, more detailed evaluation is needed to monitor and manage their skeletal health. Referral to a metabolic bone specialist may be appropriate [51].\n\nFracture risk assessment\n\nAll postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years and older should be evaluated for osteoporosis risk in order to determine need for BMD testing and/or vertebral imaging. In general, the more risk factors, the more likely a patient will break a bone.\n\nOsteoporotic fractures are preventable. Even after a fracture, osteoporosis is treatable. However, because there are no warning signs, many people with osteoporosis are not diagnosed until a fracture occurs. Factors that have been associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture are listed in Table . Primary among these is history of broken bones in adulthood, with highest risk in first 1–2 years after the initial fracture [52, 53]. Patients must be evaluated soon after a fracture and receive appropriate treatments to optimize risk reduction.\n\nTable 1\n\nLifestyle factorsAlcohol abuseExcessive thinnessExcess vitamin AFrequent fallingHigh salt intakeImmobilizationInadequate physical activityLow calcium intakeSmoking (active or passive)Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiencyGenetic diseasesCystic fibrosisEhlers-DanlosGaucher’s diseaseHemochromatosisHypophosphatasiaHypophosphatemiaMarfan syndromeMenkes steely hair syndromeOsteogenesis imperfectaParental history of hip fracturePorphyriaHomocystinuriaHypogonadal statesAnorexia nervosaAndrogen insensitivityFemale athlete triadHyperprolactinemiaHypogonadismPanhypopituitarismPremature menopause (< 40 years)Turner’s and Klinefelter’s syndromesEndocrine disordersObesityCushing’s syndromeDiabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2)HyperparathyroidismThyrotoxicosisGastrointestinal disordersCeliac diseaseBariatric surgeryGastric bypassGastrointestinal surgeryInflammatory bowel disease including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitisMalabsorption syndromesPancreatic diseasePrimary biliary cirrhosisHematologic disordersHemophiliaLeukemia and lymphomasMonoclonal gammopathiesMultiple myelomaSickle cell diseaseSystemic mastocytosisThalassemiaRheumatologic and autoimmune diseasesAnkylosing spondylitisOther rheumatic and autoimmune diseasesRheumatoid arthritisSystemic lupusNeurological and musculoskeletal risk factorsEpilepsyMuscular dystrophyMultiple sclerosisParkinson’s diseaseSpinal cord injuryStrokeMiscellaneous conditions and diseasesHIV/AIDSAmyloidosisChronic metabolic acidosisChronic obstructive lung diseaseCongestive heart failureDepressionRenal disease (CKD III, CKD IV, CKD V/ESRD)HypercalciuriaIdiopathic scoliosisPost-transplant bone diseaseSarcoidosisWeight lossHyponatremiaMedicationsAluminum-containing antacidsAndrogen deprivation therapyAnticoagulants (unfractionated heparin)Anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproate)Aromatase inhibitorsBarbituratesCancer chemotherapeutic drugsCyclosporine A and tacrolimusGlucocorticoids (≥ 5.0 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for ≥ 3 months)GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonists and antagonistsMedroxyprogesterone acetateMethotrexateParenteral nutritionProton pump inhibitorsSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitorsTamoxifen (premenopausal use for breast cancer treatment)Thiazolidinediones (such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone)Thyroid replacement hormone (in excess)\n\nMost fractures in older adults are associated with a fall. Falls occur in approximately one third of adults aged 65 years and older and this risk increases with age. Fall risk assessment is, therefore, a key component of primary and secondary fracture prevention. Factors associated with falls are shown in Table . The most important of these are history of falling, muscle weakness, gait and balance disturbances, sedating or hypnotic medications, visual impairment, and any condition associated with dizziness, such as dehydration and orthostatic hypotension [55, 56]. Importantly, multiple studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of physical therapy and exercise regimens targeted to fall risk reduction.\n\nTable 2\n\nMedical risk factors•Advanced age•Arthritis•Female gender•Poor vision•Urinary urgency or incontinence•Previous fall•Orthostatic hypotension•Impaired transfer and mobility•Medications that cause dizziness or sedation (narcotic analgesics, anticonvulsants, psychotropics)•Malnutrition/parenteral nutrition (vitamin D deficiency, insufficient protein)Neurological and musculoskeletal risk factors•Poor balance•Weak muscles/sarcopenia•Gait disturbances•Kyphosis (abnormal spinal curvature)•Reduced proprioception•Diseases and/or therapies that cause sedation, dizziness, weakness, or lack of coordination•Alzheimer’s/other dementia, delirium, Parkinson disease, and strokeEnvironmental risk factors•Low-level lighting•Obstacles in the walking path•Loose throw rugs•Stairs•Lack of assistive devices in bathrooms•Slippery outdoor conditionsPsychological risk factors•Anxiety and agitation•Depression•Diminished cognitive acuity•Fear of falling\n\nEvaluation of patients with fractures\n\nIn patients aged 50 years or older, consider hip, vertebral, and/or forearm fractures to be highly suggestive of osteoporosis or other metabolic bone disease, unless excluded by clinical evaluation and imaging. Risk for fracture at all sites rises substantially in the period immediately following an initial fracture. Therefore, any fracture in adulthood should be viewed as a red flag signaling urgent need for focused attention [57].\n\nSecondary skeletal etiologies should be investigated in all patients who present with fractures, low bone mass, or osteoporosis (Table ). Chronic kidney disease, hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia, and other diseases can cause skeletal fragility, multiple vertebral fractures, and very low bone density. For some metabolic bone diseases, osteoporosis therapies are not appropriate and may be harmful (e.g., osteomalacia or aplastic bone disease). Relevant blood and urine studies (Table ) to rule out secondary etiologies should be obtained prior to initiating antifracture therapy. Patients found to have secondary, treatable causes of bone fragility may require no additional therapy once the underlying condition is addressed (Table ).\n\nTable 3\n\nDiagnostic studies for secondary causes of osteoporosisBlood or serum1 Complete blood count (CBC)2 Albumin3 Chemistry levels (albumin-adjusted calcium, renal function, phosphorus, and magnesium)4 Liver function tests5 25(OH) vitamin D6 Parathyroid hormone (PTH)7 Total testosterone and gonadotropin (men aged 50–69 years)Consider in select patients•Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum immunofixation, serum free kappa and lambda light chains•Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) +/− free T4•Tissue transglutaminase antibodies (and IgA levels)•Iron and ferritin levels•Homocysteine (to evaluate for homocystinuria)•Prolactin level•Tryptase•Biochemical markers of bone turnoverUrine1 24-h urinary calcium and creatinineConsider in select patients•Protein electrophoresis (UPEP) and kappa and lambda light chains•Salivary cortisol and/or Urinary free cortisol level •Urinary histamine\n\nOsteoporosis affects a significant number of men, yet largely goes undetected and untreated. Some of the laboratory testing to assess secondary etiologies in men differs from that in women. Screening BMD and vertebral imaging recommendations are outlined in Tables and . For additional guidance, readers should refer to Osteoporosis in Men: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline, which provides a detailed approach to evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis in men [58].\n\nTable 6\n\nConsider BMD testing in the following individualsWomen ≥ 65 years of age and men ≥ 70 years of age, regardless of clinical risk factorsYounger postmenopausal women, women in the menopausal transition, and men aged 50 to 69 years with clinical risk factors for fractureAdults who have a fracture at age 50 years and olderAdults with a condition (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, organ transplant) or taking a medication (e.g., glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy) associated with low bone mass or bone loss\n\nTable 7\n\nConsider vertebral imaging tests for the following individuals***•All women aged ≥ 65 years and all men aged ≥ 80 years if T-score at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck is ≤ − 1.0 [6].•Men aged 70 to 79 years if T-score at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck is ≤ − 1.5•Postmenopausal women and men age ≥ 50 years with specific risk factors:°Fracture during adulthood (age ≥ 50 years)°Historical height loss of 1.5 in. or more*°Prospective height loss of 0.8 in. or more**°Recent or ongoing long-term glucocorticoid treatment°Medical conditions associated with bone loss such as hyperparathyroidism\n\nBone mineral density (BMD) measurement and classification\n\nDXA measurement of hip and lumbar spine is the preferred method for establishing and/or confirming a diagnosis of osteoporosis, predicting future fracture risk, and monitoring patients. Areal BMD by DXA is expressed in absolute terms of grams of mineral per square centimeter scanned (g/cm2) and as a relationship to two BMD norms: an age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched reference population (Z-score), or a young-adult reference population (T-score). The International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) recommends using a Caucasian (non-race adjusted) young female normative database for women AND men of ALL ethnic groups. Recommendations may vary with use of sex- and race-adjusted young normal controls for T-scores and these are used by some co-authors of this guide [59].\n\nThe difference between a patient’s BMD and the mean BMD of the reference population, divided by the standard deviation of the reference population, is used to calculate Z-scores and T-scores. An individual’s BMD is reported as the standard deviations above or below the mean BMD, as outlined in Table . The BMD diagnosis of normal bone mass, low bone mass (osteopenia), and osteoporosis are based on this World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic classification [60].\n\nTable 4\n\nWHO definition of osteoporosis based on BMDClassificationBMDT-scoreNormalWithin 1.0 SD of the mean level for a young-adult reference populationT-score at − 1.0 and aboveLow bone mass (osteopenia)Between 1.0 and 2.5 SD below that of the mean level for a young-adult reference populationT-score between − 1.0 and − 2.5Osteoporosis2.5 SD or more below that of the mean level for a young-adult reference populationT-score at or below − 2.5\n\nBMD has been shown to correlate well with bone strength. The recent FNIH Bone Quality Study found that improvements in DXA-based BMD predicted reductions in fracture risk. In a meta-regression analysis of 38 placebo-controlled trials of 19 osteoporosis medications, with ~ 111,000 study participants, the FNIH study group found that increased BMD at the total hip and lumbar spine predicted fracture risk reduction at both of these sites [61]. Larger increases in BMD were associated with greater reductions in risk. For example, a 2% increase in total hip BMD could be expected to reduce vertebral fracture risk by 28% and hip fracture risk by 16%, while a 6% increase in hip BMD would result in a 66% reduction in vertebral fracture risk and a 40% reduction in risk factors for hip fractures (Table ).\n\nTable 5\n\n% increase in BMD% reduction in vertebral fracture% reduction in hip fractureAt total hip2%28%16%4%51%29%6%66%40%At femoral neck2%28%15%4%55%32%6%72%46%At lumbar spine2%28%22%4%62%38%6%79%51%\n\nDXA scans are associated with exposure to trivial amounts of radiation. These highly sensitive measurements of lumbar spine, hip, and/or forearm must be performed by trained technologists on well-calibrated instruments. For meaningful interpretation, serial scans should be performed on the same densitometry device at the same facility.\n\nIn postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years and older, WHO diagnostic T-score criteria (normal, low bone mass, and osteoporosis) are applied to BMD measurement by central DXA at the lumbar spine and femoral neck [62]. BMD measured by DXA at the 33% radius is used for diagnosing osteoporosis when hip or lumbar spine cannot be measured; scans are unusable or cannot be interpreted, in clinical conditions associated with low forearm BMD, or as dictated by clinical judgment [59, 62].\n\nIt is important to note that DXA of the lumbar spine can be difficult to accurately interpret. This is in large part due to degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, very common in older adults, that are typically characterized by localized bone proliferation. In this setting, DXA findings can overestimate spinal BMD and underestimate fracture risk. Patients with degenerative spinal changes may benefit from trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD) measured with quantitative computed tomography (QCT), which is less affected by these changes, although this technology is not widely available [63, 64].\n\nThese diagnostic classifications should not be applied to everyone. Premenopausal women, men less than 50 years of age, and children cannot be diagnosed on the basis of densitometric criteria alone. In populations between 20 and 50 years of age, the ISCD recommends that ethnicity- or race-adjusted Z-scores be used instead. Z-scores of − 2.0 or lower are classified as low BMD for chronological age and those above − 2.0 classified as within the expected range for age [59]. In children, height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) (BMC/BMDhaz) has been demonstrated to most effectively offset the effect of short or tall stature on BMC/BMD Z-scores. A calculator for pediatric Z-score adjustment is available at https://zscore.research.chop.edu.\n\nWho should be tested?\n\nThe decision to perform initial bone density measurement should be based on an individual’s fracture risk profile and skeletal health assessment. Measuring bone density is not indicated unless test results will influence treatment and management decisions. The BHOF recommends screening densitometry in women aged ≥ 65 years and men aged ≥ 70 years, younger postmenopausal women aged 50–64 years, and men aged 50-69 years with risk factors for osteoporosis. The BHOF also recommends BMD testing for women and men with fracture(s). These recommendations are in concert with those of the ISCD and Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines for osteoporosis in men [58, 59]. BHOF recommendations for BMD testing are listed in Table . Routine bone density measurement is not recommended for children or adolescents and is not routinely indicated in healthy young men or premenopausal women unless there is a significant fracture history or specific risk factors for bone loss (such as glucocorticoid use).\n\nRecommended screening densitometry in men\n\nBHOF (formerly NOF) and other societies recommend BMD testing in men to inform clinical decisions regarding treatment (Table ). This includes men aged 70 years and older regardless of risk factors, men aged 50–69 years with clinical risk factors for fracture, and men who have broken a bone at age 50 years or older. In addition, men with conditions or on treatments associated with bone loss or low bone mass should be considered appropriate candidates for BMD screening (in its 2018 report, the US Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF] confirmed the utility of BMD by DXA in predicting fracture in both women and men, but they found insufficient evidence at that time to recommend routine testing in men) [22, 65].\n\nVertebral fracture assessment\n\nVertebral fracture in an adult aged 50 years or older is diagnostic of osteoporosis, even in the absence of a bone density diagnosis. The presence of a single vertebral fracture signifies a 5-fold increased risk for additional vertebral fractures and a 2- to 3- fold increased risk for hip or other fractures [66].\n\nUnfortunately, most vertebral fractures are subclinical and/or completely asymptomatic. As a result, they may go undiagnosed for many years. At the same time, a high proportion of women with asymptomatic vertebral fractures have BMD levels that would not warrant treatment based on BMD alone [67]. The finding of a previously unrecognized vertebral fracture may change a patient’s diagnostic classification, alter fracture risk calculations, and determine treatment decisions [68]. Proactive investigation is required to detect these fractures so that further bone damage can be prevented.\n\nTraditionally, conventional lateral thoracic/lumbar spine X-ray has been considered the gold standard for identification of vertebral fractures and minor vertebral deformities. However, DXA-assisted vertebral fracture assessment (DXA-VFA) is emerging as an alternative to radiography for its convenience, low cost, and minimal radiation exposure. Recently performed MRI or CT imaging studies done for other purposes can and should also be evaluated for presence of vertebral fractures or evidence of vertebral deformity.\n\nBecause subclinical vertebral fractures are so prevalent in older individuals, vertebral fracture assessment is recommended for the high-risk individuals listed in Table [7, 8, 69]. As demonstrated in a recent study, incorporation of DXA-VFA into routine DXA screening for postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis (T-score ≤ − 1, aged ≥ 65 years) has demonstrated cost-effectiveness for predicting increased risk of osteoporotic fractures [6].\n\nBaseline DXA-VFA imaging provides a benchmark for future comparison when DXA-BMD is reassessed or when suggestive symptoms present: such as prospective height loss, new back pain, or postural changes [7]. Follow-up vertebral imaging may also be appropriate for patients being considered for a bisphosphonate holiday (temporary suspension of pharmacotherapy), since discontinuing antifracture therapy would not be advisable in patients who have recent vertebral fractures [70].\n\nUsing US-adapted Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®)\n\nThe Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®) was developed to calculate 10-year probabilities of hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture (defined as clinical vertebral, hip, forearm or proximal humerus fracture). The FRAX® algorithm takes into account the validated clinical risk factors for fractures shown in Table . FRAX® is validated for women and men aged 40–90 years. FRAX® was tested in treatment-naïve patients not on osteoporosis medications. It may, however, be useful for assessing risk in previously treated individuals who have discontinued bisphosphonate therapy for 2 years or non-bisphosphonate therapy for 1 year [65, 71].\n\nTable 8\n\nClinical risk factors included in FRAX® ToolAgeAlcohol intake (3 or more drinks/day)BMD at femoral neck (g/cm2)BMI (low body mass index, kg/m2)Female sexOral glucocorticoid intake ≥ 5 mg/day of prednisone for > 3 months (ever)Parental history of hip fracturePrior osteoporotic fracture (including clinical and subclinical vertebral fractures)Rheumatoid arthritisSmoking (current)Secondary causes of osteoporosis: type 1 diabetes, osteogenesis imperfecta in adults, untreated long-standing hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism or premature menopause (< 40 years), chronic malnutrition or malabsorption, and chronic liver disease\n\nA country-specific FRAX® score can be calculated with BMD, without BMD, with BMD and body mass index (BMI), or with BMI alone. Studies have demonstrated modest agreement between assessments of FRAX®-with-BMD and FRAX®-with-BMI (correlation coefficient ~ 0.5) [72]. While FRAX®-with-BMI may overestimate probability in older frail adults, it may underestimate fracture risk in younger patients compared to FRAX-with-BMD [73, 74].\n\nFRAX® can be calculated with either femoral neck BMD or total hip BMD (in g/cm2), but, when available, femoral neck BMD is preferred. The use of BMD from non-hip sites is not recommended. Caution should be taken when using FRAX® without BMD to estimate fracture risk. (Although FRAX® allows input of T-score, we do not recommend this since the reference database for T-score calculation with clinical DXA systems may not be the same as that used in the FRAX® algorithm.)\n\nTherapeutic intervention recommendations in FRAX® incorporate data on risk-benefit analyses, cost-effectiveness of treatments, and competition for resources in the USA [75, 76].These recommendations exist for guidance purposes only and are not absolute rules. Developers of FRAX® determined that for many secondary causes of osteoporosis, fracture risk is mediated primarily through impact on BMD [77]. For this reason, when low femoral neck BMD is entered into FRAX®, the secondary causes of osteoporosis button is automatically inactivated.\n\nFRAX® scores should not deter clinicians or patients from considering intervention strategies when clinically assessed risk indicates utility. Conversely, these recommendations do not mandate treatment, particularly in patients with bone mass that is low but above the osteoporosis range. For patients with scores above FRAX® treatment thresholds, who do not have prevalent fracture of the hip or spine or secondary risk factors for accelerated bone loss, it is currently unclear if pharmacologic treatment significantly improves fracture risk with a reasonable number needed to treat. Management decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis [78, 79].\n\nFRAX and US ethnicity data\n\nThe US adaptation of FRAX requires selecting 1 of 4 ethnicities for each patient (Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, Asian). Among these populations, data indicates differences in fracture risk even at the same BMD. Although many limitations to this methodology have been described, it provides fracture risk stratification that can direct treatment to high-risk individuals most likely to benefit and avoid treatment of those at low risk [80]. Other countries, including some with considerable ethnic diversity, have used an alternative approach, with a single version of FRAX regardless of ethnicity.\n\nFRAX® with trabecular bone score\n\nTrabecular bone score (TBS) is an assessment of how evenly or unevenly mineral is structurally distributed in trabecular bone. A TBS is generated from lumbar spine BMD images using software installed on a DXA machine. No additional scan time or radiation exposure is required. The TBS gray-scale texture model captures local differences in mineral concentrations, providing an index of bone microarchitecture that predicts fracture risk independent of BMD and FRAX® scores. TBS is correlated with BMD at spine and hip as well as with FRAX® risk projections for hip and major osteoporotic fracture [81, 82]. Adding TBS to FRAX®, which is possible on late-model densitometry devices, increases the ability of FRAX® to predict fractures (TBS-adjusted FRAX®) [83].\n\nTBS is most applicable to patients who have low bone mass, rather than those with osteoporosis according to BMD criteria, for whom treatment is already indicated [84, 85]. TBS is FDA approved and provides additional utility in fracture risk assessment among people with secondary causes of bone loss and fractures, such as type 2 diabetes [83, 86, 87].\n\nPotential limitations of FRAX®\n\nThe FRAX® tool is not a perfect predictor of fracture and its use requires clinical judgment. Because data validating the relative weight of all known risk factors are not yet available, they are not included in the FRAX® algorithm. These variables include risks associated with falls, non-DXA bone density measurements, rapidity of bone loss, specific secondary causes of osteoporosis (e.g., type 2 diabetes), and multiple fractures experienced in a short period of time. Other risks that are important in older adults not included in FRAX include frailty, multiple comorbid conditions, multiple medications associated with falls/fractures, and life expectancy.\n\nThe FRAX® tool is most useful in patients with low femoral neck BMD. The FRAX® algorithm has not been validated for use with lumbar spine BMD. Utilizing FRAX® in patients with low BMD at the lumbar spine, but relatively normal BMD at the femoral neck, underestimates fracture risk (Fig. ).\n\nThe yes/no scoring employed by FRAX® computes average risk associated with individual clinical variables. As a result, dose–response effects of risk factors included in FRAX® are lost. For such variables, presumably higher doses increase risk more than lower doses. (Adjustments to FRAX to better account for dose effect of glucocorticoid dose have been proposed [88].)\n\nThe FRAX® algorithm is available at http://www.bonehealthandosteoporosis.org as well as at http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX. It is available on newer DXA systems or with software upgrades that provide the FRAX® scores as well as the TBS-adjusted FRAX® on the bone density report.\n\nAlternative bone densitometry technologies\n\nTechnologies other than DXA can be used to assess BMD, bone structure, bone strength, and fracture risk.These include quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to measure volumetric (v) BMD of the spine and proximal femur and derive areal BMD values that can be used for diagnostic classification with the WHO criteria and for input for FRAX. Opportunistic QCT uses QCT images performed for non-skeletal indications to detect fractures and measure BMD with synchronous or asynchronous calibration [89]. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measures non-BMD parameters of bone strength that are correlated with fracture risk. Imaging technologies used in research settings and sometimes in clinical practice include: pulse echo ultrasound (PEUS), and finite element analysis (FEA) with biomechanical computed tomography (BCT) [90, 91]. Other bone imaging tools largely used in research include peripheral QCT (pQCT), high-resolution pQCT (HR-pQCT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nBiochemical markers of bone turnover\n\nWhile not currently FDA approved for diagnosis of osteoporosis, measurements of biochemical bone turnover markers (BTMs) can play a role in assessing fracture risk in appropriate individuals: for example, to gauge rate of bone loss in women following treatment for breast cancer.\n\nProducts of the remodeling process can be measured as indicators of turnover activity. Biochemical markers of bone remodeling include resorption markers serum C-telopeptide (CTX) and urinary N-telopeptide (NTX) and formation markers serum amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), and osteocalcin (OC).\n\nBTMs may [92]:\n\nPredict rapidity of bone loss in untreated postmenopausal women.\n\nPredict extent of fracture risk reduction when repeated after 3–6 months of treatment with FDA-approved therapies.\n\nPredict magnitude of BMD increases with FDA-approved therapies.\n\nCharacterize patient compliance and persistence with osteoporosis therapy using a serum CTX for an antiresorptive medication and P1NP for an anabolic therapy (least significant change [LSC] is approximately a 40% reduction in CTX).\n\nPotentially be used during a bisphosphonate holiday to suggest when medication should be restarted, although more data are needed to support this recommendation.\n\nThe FNIH Bone Quality Project conducted a large analysis of antiresorptive therapies to evaluate the utility of BTM changes as a surrogate for fracture risk reduction in drug development. In a recent pooled meta-regression analysis of antiresorptive therapies, changes in CTX or NTX did not predict antifracture efficacy. Changes in the bone formation markers BALP and P1NP, however, were strongly predictive of risk reduction for vertebral fractures, but these changes did not reach significance for non-vertebral or hip fractures [93].\n\nUniversal bone health recommendations\n\nSeveral interventions to preserve bone strength can be recommended to the general population. These include adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, cessation of tobacco use, identification and treatment of excessive alcohol intake, regular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercise, and remediation of conditions associated with falls, such as visual impairment and use of sedating medications.\n\nAdequate intake of calcium\n\nSufficient calcium intakes are necessary for acquisition of peak bone mass and maintenance of bone health across the lifespan. The skeleton contains 99% of the body’s calcium stores; when the exogenous supply is inadequate, bone tissue is resorbed from the skeleton to maintain constant serum calcium levels.\n\nBHOF supports the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) calcium intake recommendations: 1000 mg/day for men aged 19–70 years and women aged 19–50 years; 1200 mg/day for women 51 years and older and men 71 years and older (Tables and ) [95]. There is no evidence that calcium intakes in excess of recommended amounts confer additional bone benefit. However, there is evidence that intake of supplemental calcium above 1200 to 1500 mg/day can increase risk for developing kidney stones in at-risk individuals [96].\n\nTable 9\n\nStep 1: Estimate calcium intake from calcium-rich foods*Product# of servings/dayEstimated calcium/serving, in mgCalcium in mg\n\nMilk (8 oz)\n\nAlmond/soy milk (8 oz)\n\n__________\n\n× 300\n\n× 450\n\n= __________Yogurt (6 oz)__________× 300= __________Cheese (1 oz or 1 cubic in.)__________× 200= __________Fortified foods or juices__________× 80 to 1000**= __________Tofu, firm (8 oz)__________× 250= __________Subtotal= __________Step 2: Add 250 mg for non-dairy sources to subtotal+ 250Total calcium, in mg= __________\n\nTable 10\n\nLife stage groupCalcium\n\nIOM/NOF (mg/day)Calcium\n\nSafe upper limit (mg/day)Vitamin D\n\nIOM/NOF (units/day)Vitamin D\n\nSafe upper limit (units/day)51–70-year-old women12002500600/800–1000400051–70-year-old men10002000600/800–1000400071+-year-old men and women12002000800/800–10004000\n\nA balanced diet rich in low-fat dairy products, select dark greens, fish with bone, fruits, vegetables, and fortified foods (like the nondairy supplemented beverages including orange juice, or soy and almond milk) provides calcium as well as numerous nutrients needed for good health. Table illustrates a simple method for estimating the calcium in a patient’s diet. Most people do not get enough. Average daily dietary calcium intake for adults age ≥ 50 years is 600 to 700 mg/day. Increasing dietary calcium is the first-line approach, but calcium supplements should be used when an adequate dietary intake cannot be achieved [97, 98].\n\nCalcium intake recommendations refer to milligrams of elemental calcium in the supplement. Content varies: calcium carbonate contains 40% elemental calcium by weight, whereas calcium citrate contains 21%. Patients should be advised to read the Supplement Facts panel for elemental calcium content when choosing a supplement.\n\nSupplemental calcium is most widely available as calcium carbonate and calcium citrate. Calcium carbonate requires stomach acid for absorption and so is best taken with food, while calcium citrate is absorbed equally well on an empty stomach. Calcium of all types is best absorbed in doses of ~ 500 mg or less. Splitting doses may be needed to ensure optimal absorption [99].\n\nCalcium citrate is useful for people with achlorhydria, inflammatory bowel disease, absorption disorders, and those on proton pump inhibitors that reduce gastric acid. Individuals who experience gastrointestinal side effects taking calcium carbonate may benefit from taking multiple small doses, taking calcium carbonate with meals and/or switching to calcium citrate. Other varieties of calcium commonly in supplements or fortified foods include gluconate, lactate, and phosphate. Calcium citrate malate is a well-absorbed form of calcium found in some fortified juices. Elemental calcium in fortified foods varies.\n\nSome studies have reported increased risk of cardiovascular disease linked to calcium supplements with or without vitamin D, but conflicting data are reported [100–103]. A large systematic review and meta-analysis including RCTs and cohort studies found no evidence that calcium with or without vitamin D increased cardiovascular disease [104]. The large VITamin D and OmegA-3 Trial (VITAL), sponsored by the NIH, tested supplemental vitamin D (2000 units/day) on cardiovascular outcomes and found no adverse effects [105].\n\nAdequate intake of vitamin D\n\nVitamin D facilitates calcium absorption that is necessary for mineralization of bone. The BHOF recommends a daily intake of 800 to 1000 units of vitamin D for adults aged 50 years and older. The Institute of Medicine Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D are 600 units daily until age 70 years and 800 units/day for adults age 71 years and older. The IOM recommendations for vitamin D are based on intakes sufficient to maintain a serum 25(OH)D of 20 ng/mL in ≥ 97.5% of population [94]. A slightly higher serum 25(OH)D level (approximately 30 ng/mL) is associated with optimal calcium absorption and so is preferred by the BHOF [106–110]. The upper limits for vitamin D intake according to the IOM is 4000 units/day for adults, above which there is a potential for adverse effects. The current normal range for 25(OH)D levels is 20 to 50 ng/mL. Some studies suggest that excessive intake of vitamin D may have adverse impacts on bone through increased risk for falls and fractures [110, 111].\n\nChief dietary sources of vitamin D include fortified milk (400 units per quart) and breakfast cereals (generally 40–300 units per serving), saltwater fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel, tuna), and cod liver oil. Some, but not all non-dairy milk substitutes, such as rice or soy milk, are supplemented with vitamin D and calcium and so it is important to read the labels. Some calcium supplements and most multivitamin tablets contain vitamin D. Supplementation with either vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) or vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is effective, but cholecalciferol, which is the form produced in humans, is preferable. Vitamin D2 is derived from plant sources and may be preferred by individuals on a strict vegan/vegetarian diet.\n\nMany conditions prevalent in older patients contribute to vitamin D deficiency, such as chronic renal insufficiency and limited sun exposure due to disability. Of note, a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is seen in patients with advanced osteoarthritis presenting for total hip replacement as well as in hip fracture patients with osteoporosis (including those on antifracture medications) [9, 112]. Vitamin D deficiency should be corrected to optimize surgical and/or pharmacologic outcomes.\n\nSupplemental vitamin D should be administered in amounts capable of raising serum 25(OH)D levels to approximately 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and maintaining it at this level. Adults who are vitamin D deficient are typically treated with 50,000 units of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 once a week (or the equivalent daily dose of 7000 units vitamin D2 or vitamin D3) for 5–8 weeks to achieve a 25(OH)D blood level of approximately 30 ng/mL. This regimen should be followed by maintenance therapy of 1000 to 2000 units/day or whatever dose is needed to maintain the target serum level [113, 114]. Adults with ongoing malabsorption may require higher replacement doses of vitamin D to reach and sustain sufficiency.\n\nSupplemental vitamin D and BMD\n\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses have found insufficient or conflicting evidence to support the use of supplemental vitamin D alone (without calcium) to promote musculoskeletal health in adults living in the community [115–119]. The large VITAL study in generally healthy women and men (≥ 55/≥ 50 years respectively) not selected for low bone mass or vitamin D insufficiency, reported no effect of high-dose, supplemental vitamin D (cholecalciferol 2000 units/day) versus placebo on BMD or bone structural measures over 2 years [120, 121]. Effects did not vary by sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, or baseline 25(OH)D levels. The baseline 25(OH)D level (mean) was 27 ng/mL, suggesting that VITAL participants may already be at serum vitamin D levels sufficient to support normal bone health. These findings do not apply to persons with extremely low vitamin D levels or osteoporosis or younger adults. Ongoing studies in VITAL are examining effects of supplemental vitamin D on incident fractures among 25,871 women and men nationwide [121, 122].\n\nSupplemental vitamin D and fall risk\n\nA possible role for supplemental vitamin D in fall prevention has been a subject of study and inconclusive data. Results from the VITAL study, the largest placebo-controlled RCT of supplemental vitamin D on health outcomes, did not support the use of supplemental vitamin D (2000 units/day vs placebo groups) to prevent falls in generally healthy population not selected for high falls risk or vitamin D insufficiency [123]. These findings are consistent with recent meta-analyses and other randomized controlled studies in populations around the world that have not found supplemental vitamin D to be effective in reducing fall risk [118, 124–126].\n\nVitamin D absorption and synthesis\n\nGastrointestinal absorption of vitamin D differs between individuals and can be significantly decreased in patients with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, bariatric surgery, and other disorders. Variability in skin activation and synthesis of vitamin D results from differences in pigmentation, season (weak UV light in the winter and fall), time spent outdoors, and use of sunscreens. For example, African Americans have lower 25(OH)D levels than non-Hispanic white Americans due to decreased skin activation (and possibly differences in vitamin D binding proteins). People who live in northern latitudes typically experience a decrease in serum vitamin D in winter that rebounds in spring and summer.\n\nCessation of tobacco use and avoidance of excessive alcohol intake\n\nThe use of tobacco products is detrimental to the skeleton as well as to overall health [127–130]. BHOF strongly recommends smoking cessation to support primary and secondary prevention of osteoporosis.\n\nModerate alcohol intake has no known negative effect on bone and may even be associated with slightly higher bone density and lower risk of fracture in postmenopausal women. However, alcohol intake of more than two drinks a day for women or three drinks a day for men may be detrimental to bone health. It has been associated with reduced calcium absorption and increased risk for falls. Clinicians should identify patients at risk for chronic heavy drinking and/or binge drinking who require further evaluation and treatment [131].\n\nRegular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening physical activity\n\nThe BHOF strongly endorses physical activity at all ages, both for fracture prevention and overall fitness. In childhood and adolescence, consistent weight-bearing and high-impact activities contribute to acquisition of optimal peak bone mass [132]. Weight-bearing exercises (in which bones and muscles work against gravity with feet and legs bearing body weight) include walking, jogging, tai chi, stair climbing, dancing, and tennis. Muscle-strengthening exercises include weight training and resistive exercises, such as yoga, Pilates, and boot camp calisthenics. To avoid injury, patients should be evaluated before initiating a new exercise program, particularly one involving compressive or contractile stressors (such as running or weightlifting).\n\nA multicomponent program is recommended for people with osteoporosis: one that includes progressive resistance training, balance training, back extensor strengthening, core stabilizers, cardiovascular conditioning, and impact or ground-reaction forces to stimulate bone. In people with osteoporosis, improved fall outcomes have been documented following high-intensity exercise programs that combine resistance, balance, and weight-bearing activities [133–136]. In research settings, structured exercise programs have resulted in modest increases in bone density [137–139]. Muscle growth has been reported even in frail elderly individuals with established sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) who participate in short-burst high-intensity exercise. For safety, any such program of physical activity must be developed and supervised by certified fitness personnel experienced with skeletal fragility in geriatric patients. (See “Protecting fragile bones in daily life and recreation” section.)\n\nMotivating patients to stick with a program of physical activity\n\nSticking with any lifestyle change can be difficult. However, persistence is easier when that change is linked to something of value to an individual. In this case, what probably matters most is preserving independence by avoiding an injury that results in nursing home admission. Visual aids that show graphical comparisons of risk, can help patients see the connection between bone health recommendations and quality of life.\n\nConsultation with a trained physical therapist and/or participation in group exercise led by certified fitness personnel help ensure patient safety, motivate daily participation, and promote social engagement. As long as principles of safe movement are followed, walking and daily activities such as housework and gardening are practical ways to contribute to maintenance of fitness and bone mass.\n\nFall prevention strategies\n\nAmong adults aged 65 or older, falls are the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal injuries including the majority of all fractures and over 90% of hip fractures [142–144]. According to CDC statistics, in 2018, more than 32,000 adults aged ≥ 65 years were killed by unintentional fall injuries [145].\n\nMajor risk factors for falls are shown above in Table . Many of these are modifiable: muscle strength and balance can be improved through targeted exercise; visual impairment can be addressed; severe vitamin D deficiency can be corrected; fall hazards in the home and work environment can be remediated; and medications that induce dizziness and disorientation can be replaced or reduced.\n\nMultiple studies have demonstrated the efficacy of therapeutic physical activity in reducing falls. A recent meta-analysis of RCTs investigating moderate-intensity multicomponent physical activity (aerobic, balance, and strength training) 3 times a week for 1 year or more reported significant fall reductions: 22% lower risk for falls and 26% lower risk for injurious falls. Risk of fractures was reduced by 16%, although the significance of this finding is weakened by the small number of fractures in the study (p = .05) [146]. For individuals who have already experienced a fall, regular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening physical activity may reduce the risk of future falls and fractures [124, 147–149].\n\nA 12-month, single-blinded RCT among 345 high-risk older adults aged ≥ 70 years who had fallen in the year prior compared usual care (geriatrician provided fall prevention instruction) or a home-based exercise program focused on strength and balance training. At 1 year, fall incidence was 74% lower in the home-based exercise group than in the group that received usual care. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported [150].\n\nRegarding fracture outcomes among persons with osteoporosis, there are few exercise/physical activity studies with fractures as a primary endpoint. However, a recent meta-analysis examining physical activity and fall outcomes in older adults in the general population provides evidence that physical activity may prevent fractures in older adults [135]. Another meta-analysis of 10 studies (n = 4047) reported that physical activity may reduce the number of older community-dwelling adults experiencing ≥ 1 fall-related fracture (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95), but the evidence is judged to be of low certainty [151].\n\nIn the WHI, among 77,206 postmenopausal women across the USA followed for a mean of 14 years, there was an association between higher levels of physical activity and lower total fracture risk and lower risk for hip fracture. It is important to note that even low-intensity activities such as walking or gardening reduced risk for hip fracture when compared to sedentary activities [152].\n\nThere are a limited number of studies with men and few RCT exercise studies with fracture outcomes comparing those who exercise to those who did not exercise.\n\nUS FDA-approved drugs for osteoporosis\n\nCurrent FDA-approved pharmacologic therapeutics for prevention and/or treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis include bisphosphonates (alendronate, alendronate plus D, ibandronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid), estrogens (estrogen and/or hormone therapy), estrogen agonist/antagonist (raloxifene), tissue-selective estrogen complex (conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene), parathyroid hormone (PTH [1–34], teriparatide), analog of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP [1–34], abaloparatide), RANKL inhibitor (denosumab), fully human monoclonal antibody to sclerostin (romosozumab), and calcitonin. Please see product-specific prescribing information for details of their use (Table ).\n\nTable 11\n\nDrug nameBrand nameForm/dosingApproval for\n\nAntifracture benefits of FDA-approved drugs for osteoporosis have been studied primarily in postmenopausal women. We have more limited fracture data on efficacy in patients with secondary causes of osteoporosis (e.g., diabetes, glucocorticoids) and men diagnosed with osteoporosis by fracture or T-score.\n\nPotential benefits and risks of therapy should be assessed in the context of a drug’s fracture efficacy, onset of effect, duration parameters, magnitude of effect, and site of optimal fracture prevention (spine vs hip). In general, a therapy that has been shown to reduce risk of both vertebral and non-vertebral fractures (alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, denosumab, teriparatide, abaloparatide, or romosozumab) should be considered over one that has not (raloxifene, calcitonin, ibandronate). In most of these pivotal studies, participants were on appropriate amounts of calcium and vitamin D.\n\nThe BHOF does not advocate the use of drugs that are not approved by the FDA for prevention and/or treatment of osteoporosis.\n\nBisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid)\n\nBisphosphonates are a class of potent antiresorptive agents. Composed of two phosphate groups, bisphosphonates have also been called diphosphonates. All bisphosphonates can affect renal function and are contraindicated in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 30–35 mL/min. Bisphosphonates may cause or exacerbate hypocalcemia, and therefore, hypocalcemia must be corrected before treatment.\n\nAlendronate, brand name: Fosamax®, Fosamax Plus D, Binosto™ (liquid preparation) and generic alendronate\n\nAlendronate sodium is approved by the FDA for prevention (5 mg daily and 35 mg weekly tablets) and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (10 mg daily tablet, 70 mg weekly tablet [most commonly used dose], 70 mg weekly tablet with 2800 units or 5600 units of vitamin D3, and 70 mg effervescent tablet). Alendronate is approved as treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis and for treatment of osteoporosis in men and women taking glucocorticoids [154].\n\nDrug efficacy\n\nAlendronate reduces incidence of spine and hip fractures by about 50% over 3 years in patients with prior vertebral fracture and in patients who have hip T-scores diagnostic of osteoporosis (≤ − 2.5) [155, 156]. It reduces incidence of vertebral fractures by 48% over 3 years in patients without prior vertebral fracture.\n\nAdministration\n\nOral alendronate (generic and Fosamax®) tablets must be taken at least 30 min before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day with plain water only. Tablets must be swallowed whole with a full glass of plain water (6 to 8 oz). Effervescent alendronate (Binosto) must be dissolved in 4 oz of room temperature water and taken on an empty stomach first thing in the morning. Patients should remain upright and eat/drink nothing for 30 min following ingestion.\n\nSide effects and drug safety\n\nSide effects are similar for all oral bisphosphonate medications and include gastrointestinal problems such as difficulty swallowing, esophageal inflammation, stomach pain, and rare cases of atypical femur fractures (AFF) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). (See boxed discussion below.) Ocular inflammation (anterior uveitis and episcleritis) has been documented. All bisphosphonates can affect renal function and are contraindicated in patients with estimated GFR below 30–35 mL/min.\n\nIbandronate, brand name: Boniva® and generic ibandronate\n\nOral and intravenous ibandronate sodium are approved by the FDA for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (150 mg monthly tablet and 3 mg every 3 months by intravenous injection). Oral ibandronate is also approved for prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and is available as a generic in the USA.\n\nDrug efficacy\n\nIbandronate reduces incidence of vertebral fractures by about 33–50% over 3 years but does not reduce risk of non-vertebral fracture (hip/nonhip) [157].\n\nAdministration\n\nOral ibandronate must be taken on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning, with 8 oz of plain water (no other liquid). Tablets must be swallowed whole with a full glass of plain water (6 to 8 oz). After taking ibandronate, patients must remain upright and wait at least 60 min before eating, drinking, or taking any other medication. Intravenous ibandronate, 3 mg/3 mL prefilled syringe, is administered over 15 to 30 s once every 3 months. Serum creatinine should be checked before each injection.\n\nSide effects and drug safety\n\nSide effects are similar for all oral bisphosphonate medications and include gastrointestinal problems such as difficulty swallowing, esophageal inflammation, and stomach pain and rare cases of AFF and ONJ. (See boxed discussion below.) Ocular inflammation has been documented. Like other bisphosphonates, ibandronate may cause or exacerbate hypocalcemia, and therefore, hypocalcemia must be corrected before treatment. All bisphosphonates can affect renal function and are contraindicated in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 30–35 mL/min.\n\nRisedronate, brand name: Actonel®, Atelvia™, and generic risedronate\n\nRisedronate sodium is approved by the FDA for prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (5 mg daily tablet; 35 mg weekly tablet; 35 mg weekly delayed-release tablet; 75 mg tablets taken on two consecutive days every month; and 150 mg tablet taken monthly). Actonel® is approved to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis and to prevent and treat osteoporosis in men and women who are either initiating or taking glucocorticoids [158, 159].\n\nDrug efficacy\n\nCompared with placebo, risedronate reduced incidence of vertebral fractures by 39%, hip fractures by 27%, and non-vertebral fractures by 22% in a meta-analysis conducted by Barrionuevo et al. in 2019 [160]. Significant risk reduction occurred within 1 year of treatment in patients with a prior vertebral fracture.\n\nAdministration\n\nOral risedronate (generic and Actonel®) must be taken on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning, with 8 oz of plain water (no other liquid). Tablets must be swallowed whole with a full glass of plain water (6 to 8 oz). After taking risedronate, patients must remain upright and wait at least 30 min before eating, drinking, or taking any other medication.\n\nOral delayed-release risedronate (Atelvia®) is taken not on an empty stomach, but directly after breakfast with ≥ 4 oz of plain water (no other liquid). Patients should remain upright (sitting or standing) for at least 30 min.\n\nSide effects and drug safety\n\nSide effects are similar for all oral bisphosphonate medications and include gastrointestinal problems such as difficulty swallowing, esophageal inflammation, and stomach pain and rare cases of AFF and ONJ. (See boxed discussion below.) Ocular inflammation (anterior uveitis and episcleritis) has been documented. All bisphosphonates can affect renal function and are contraindicated in patients with estimated GFR below 30–35 mL/min. Because risedronate can cause or exacerbate hypocalcemia, hypocalcemia must be corrected before treatment. All bisphosphonates can affect renal function and are contraindicated in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 30–35 mL/min.\n\nZoledronic acid, brand name: Reclast®\n\nZoledronic acid is approved by the FDA for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (5 mg once yearly for treatment and once every 2 years for prevention). It is approved to improve bone mass in men with osteoporosis and for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in men and women expected to be on glucocorticoid therapy for at least 12 months. (Efficacy of less-frequent dosing is currently being investigated.) Zoledronic acid is indicated for prevention of new clinical fractures in patients (both women and men) who have recently had a low-trauma hip fracture. A recent placebo-controlled study in women aged ≥ 65 years with low hip BMD found that zoledronic acid administered every 18 months for 6 years reduced vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. In this study, the number needed to treat to prevent 1 incident fracture was 15 [161].\n\nDrug efficacy\n\nZoledronic acid reduces incidence of vertebral fractures by 62–70% (with significant reduction at 1 year), hip fractures by 41%, and non-vertebral fractures by 21–25% over 3 years in patients with osteoporosis defined by prevalent vertebral fractures and/or osteoporosis by BMD of the hip [160].\n\nAdministration of zoledronic acid compared with placebo in postmenopausal women with low bone mass every 18 months reduces vertebral fractures by 55%, non-vertebral fractures by 34% and forearm and wrist fractures by 44% at 6 years [161].\n\nAdministration\n\nZoledronic acid (generic and Reclast®), 5 mg in 100 mL, is given once yearly by intravenous infusion administered over at least 15 min. Some physicians infuse this over 30 min. Flu-like symptoms (arthralgia, headache, myalgia, fever) have occurred in 32% of patients after the first dose, 7% after the second dose, and 3% after the third dose. To reduce likelihood of acute-phase reactions, patients should be well hydrated, drink 2 glasses of water before the infusion and pre-treat with acetaminophen (unless contraindicated).\n\nSide effects and drug safety\n\nWe recommend a 25(OH) vitamin D level should be obtained and any vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency corrected before treatment. Zoledronic acid may cause or exacerbate hypocalcemia, and therefore, hypocalcemia must be corrected before treatment. Zoledronic acid is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min or in patients with evidence of acute renal impairment. Creatinine clearance should be measured prior to each dose [162]. Ocular inflammation (anterior uveitis and episcleritis) has been documented [163]. (See boxed discussion below.)\n\nEstrogen-related therapies (ET/HT, raloxifene, conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene)\n\nA variety of medications that act on estrogen receptors in bone are prescribed to prevent the bone loss associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n\nET/HT\n\nET brand names: e.g., Climara®, Estrace®, Estraderm®, Estratab®, Ogen®, Premarin®, Vivelle®; HT brand names: e.g., Activella®, Femhrt®, Premphase®, Prempro®. Estrogen/hormone therapy is approved by the FDA for prevention of osteoporosis and relief of vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy associated with menopause. Women with an intact uterus require HT (combined estrogen and progestin) to protect uterine lining. Women who have had a hysterectomy are treated with ET (estrogen alone).\n\nDrug efficacy\n\nThe Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) found that 5 years of oral HT (Prempro®) reduced incidence of clinical vertebral fractures and hip fractures by 34% and other osteoporotic fractures by 23% [164]. Meta-analysis sponsored by the Endocrine Society found that HT reduced fractures of the spine by 35%, hip by 28%, and non-vertebral skeleton by 22% [160].\n\nDrug administration\n\nET/HT is available in a wide variety of oral and transdermal preparations that contain estrogen only, progestin only, and combination estrogen-progestin. ET/HT dosages include cyclic, sequential, and continuous regimens. When treatment is discontinued, bone loss can be rapid. Follow-on antifracture agents should be considered to maintain BMD.\n\nSide effects and drug safety\n\nPotential risks for women include biliary issues, breast cancer (with combined estrogen–progestin), endometrial hyperplasia/cancer (with inadequately opposed estrogen). Initial WHI data found elevated risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis during 5 years of treatment with conjugated equine estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Prempro®) [165, 166]. Subsequent analyses of WHI substudy data showed no increase in cardiovascular disease in women starting treatment within 10 years of menopause [167].\n\nThe North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) recommend tailoring ET/HT formulation, dose, and route of administration to individual postmenopausal women. Risk-benefit profiles differ by patient age, time since menopause, and other factors [168, 169].\n\nThe Endocrine Society guidelines recommend ET/HT to prevent fractures in some high-fracture-risk postmenopausal women < 60 years of age or < 10 years past menopause who are experiencing vasomotor and/or climacteric symptoms and cannot take bisphosphonates or denosumab [170].\n\nWhen ET/HT use is considered solely for fracture prevention, the FDA recommends that approved non-estrogen treatments first be carefully considered.\n\nRaloxifene, brand name: Evista® and generic raloxifene\n\nRaloxifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist (selective estrogen receptor modulator/SERM) approved by the FDA for both prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene is indicated for the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [171–174]. Raloxifene does not reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.\n\nThe Endocrine Society guidelines recommend raloxifene or combination conjugated equine estrogen/bazedoxifene to prevent vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women who have low risk of deep vein thrombosis for whom bisphosphonates or denosumab are not appropriate or for women with a history of or high risk for breast cancer [166].\n\nDrug efficacy\n\nRaloxifene reduces incidence of vertebral fractures by about 30–40% in patients with a prior vertebral fracture and by about 55% in patients without a prior vertebral fracture. Raloxifene does not reduce risk of non-vertebral fractures.\n\nDrug administration\n\nRaloxifene is available as a 60-mg tablet, which may be taken with or without food (60 mg).\n\nSide effects and drug safety\n\nRaloxifene increases risk for deep vein thrombosis to a degree similar to that observed with estrogen. It can increase hot flashes and cause leg cramps.\n\nConjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene, brand name: Duavee®\n\nConjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene is FDA approved as an oral tablet for women who suffer from moderate-to-severe hot flashes associated with menopause and to prevent osteoporosis after menopause.\n\nConjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene combines conjugated estrogen with bazedoxifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist. Bazedoxifene reduces risk for endometrial hyperplasia eliminating need for progestins in women who have not undergone hysterectomy.\n\nDrug efficacy\n\nIn pivotal trials, this combination drug significantly increased mean lumbar spine BMD (treatment difference 1.51%) at 12 months compared to placebo in women who had been postmenopausal between 1 and 5 years. Treatment with conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene also increased total hip BMD. The treatment difference in total hip BMD at 12 months was 1.21% [175–178].\n\nDrug administration\n\nAvailable as a tablet containing conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene 0.45 mg/20 mg, to be taken once daily without regard to meals.\n\nConjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene is intended only for postmenopausal women who have not had hysterectomy. Like other products containing estrogen, its use should be consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. When being considered solely for the prevention of osteoporosis, such use should be limited to women who are at significant risk of fracture and only after carefully considering alternatives that do not contain estrogen. When treatment is discontinued, bone loss can be rapid. An antifracture agent should be considered to maintain BMD.\n\nSide effects and drug safety\n\nSide effects of conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene include muscle spasms, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain, oropharyngeal pain, dizziness, and neck pain. Because this product contains estrogen, it is approved with the same Boxed Warning and other Warnings and Precautions that have been approved with estrogen products.\n\nParathyroid hormone analogs (teriparatide, abaloparatide)\n\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates calcium homeostasis. Constant high exposure to PTH causes bone resorption, while intermittent administration of exogenous recombinant PTH stimulates bone formation. Two anabolic agents derived from synthetic analogs of PTH are currently FDA approved: teriparatide and abaloparatide.\n\nTeriparatide, brand name: Forteo® and the bioequivalent Bonsity™\n\nTeriparatide is a synthetic fragment of human PTH that is approved by the FDA for treatment of osteoporosis in men and women at high risk for fracture (which is defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or failure/intolerance to other available osteoporosis therapy). It is approved to treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women at high risk for fracture [179]. The FDA has approved an expanded indication for teriparatide for treatment of osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy (≥ 5 mg/day of prednisone). Forteo® is currently available as 20 μg daily subcutaneous injection. Biosimilar preparations are now available as the patented expired in 2019.\n\nDrug efficacy\n\nTeriparatide reduces risk of vertebral fractures by 65–77%, and non-vertebral fractures by 35–53% in patients with osteoporosis, after an average of 18 months of therapy [180]. The VERO trial that compared teriparatide and risedronate in postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis reported ~ 56% fewer new vertebral fractures in the teriparatide group after 24 months [181]. It is important to follow teriparatide treatment with an antiresorptive agent, usually a bisphosphonate or denosumab, to maintain or further increase BMD.\n\nDrug administration\n\nTeriparatide is administered by 20 μg daily subcutaneous injection. When treatment is discontinued, bone loss can be rapid and alternative agents should be considered to maintain BMD. Treatment duration was previously restricted to 24 months, but this was recently changed to open the possibility of longer treatment in high-risk patients.\n\nSide effects and drug safety\n\nSide effects of teriparatide include transient orthostatic hypotension, leg cramps, and nausea. Teriparatide transiently increases serum calcium which may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. It should be used with caution in patients with active or recent kidney stones, hypercalcemia and hypercalcemic disorders, and/or cutaneous calcification.\n\nUntil recently, teriparatide treatment was restricted to 2 years in response to elevated osteosarcoma seen in rodent studies. Increased osteosarcoma was not observed in humans during 15 years of post-marketing studies. As a result, the revised teriparatide label now states that use for more than 2 years during a patient's lifetime can be considered if a patient remains at or has returned to having a high risk for fracture.\n\nIts use should be avoided in settings of increased risk for osteosarcoma: Paget’s disease of the bone, prior radiation therapy involving the skeleton, open epiphyses (children and young adults), history of bone metastases or malignancies, unexplained elevated alkaline phosphatase, and hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma [182].\n\nAbaloparatide, brand name: Tymlos®\n\nAbaloparatide is a synthetic peptide analog of human PTH-related protein approved by the FDA for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or failure/intolerance to other available osteoporosis therapy.\n\nDrug efficacy\n\nAbaloparatide reduces risk of new vertebral fractures by about 86% and non-vertebral fractures by about 43% in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, after an average of 18 months of therapy [183]. In an extension study (ACTIVE-Extend) after 18 months of abaloparatide or placebo, the addition of 6 months of oral alendronate for a total of up to 24 months of therapy resulted in a relative risk reduction of radiographic spine fractures by 87%, non-vertebral fractures by 52%, and major osteoporotic fractures by 58% [184].\n\nDrug administration\n\nAbaloparatide is administered by 80 μg daily subcutaneous injection in the periumbilical area of the abdomen. When treatment is discontinued, bone loss can be rapid. An antiresorptive agent should be considered to maintain BMD. Abaloparatide treatment duration is recommended not to exceed 24 months.\n\nSide effects drug safety\n\nSide effects of abaloparatide include leg cramps, nausea, and dizziness. Avoid use in patients with increased risk of osteosarcoma (e.g., Paget’s disease of bone, bone metastases, prior skeletal radiation). Patients with hypercalcemia, or a history of an unexplained elevated alkaline phosphatase or skeletal malignancy should not receive abaloparatide therapy. Abaloparatide may increase urinary calcium. It should be used with caution in patients with active or recent kidney stones because of the potential to exacerbate this condition. It is common practice to follow abaloparatide treatment with an antiresorptive agent, usually a bisphosphonate or denosumab, to maintain or further increase BMD.\n\nRANKL inhibitor (denosumab)\n\nThe cytokine RANK-ligand (RANKL) produced by osteocytes is required for osteoclast formation. Suppressing RANKL blocks osteoclast formation, leading to less bone resorption and higher bone density.\n\nDenosumab, brand name Prolia®\n\nDenosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL approved by the FDA for treatment of men and women at high risk for fracture (which is defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture and/or multiple risk factors for fracture). It is approved for treatment of patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy, to treat postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, to treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women at high risk for fracture, to increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer, and to increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.\n\nDrug efficacy\n\nDenosumab is one of the most potent antiresorptive drugs available to treat osteoporosis because it directly inhibits osteoclast formation and causes apoptosis of mature osteoclasts. Denosumab reduces incidence of vertebral fractures by about 68% at 1 year, hip fractures by about 40% and non-vertebral fractures by about 20% at 3 years, with continued fracture reduction in studies extended to 5 years [160, 185, 186]. Longer-term use is associated with a significant 48% reduction in the risk of all upper limb fractures and a 43%, 43%, and 58% reduction in risk of forearm, wrist, and humerus fractures at 7 years [187, 188].\n\nDrug administration\n\nDenosumab is administered as 60 mg subcutaneous injection by a health professional every 6 months.\n\nSide effects and drug safety\n\nDenosumab may cause or exacerbate hypocalcemia, and therefore, hypocalcemia must be corrected before treatment. Denosumab has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, dermatitis, rash, and urticaria. Studies have reported higher incidence of serious infection in women taking denosumab; however, no clear clinical pattern has emerged to s"
