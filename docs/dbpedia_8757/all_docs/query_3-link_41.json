        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nAs per WHO, antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens were divided into three categories i.e., critical, high, and medium depending on the urgent need for new drugs to cure them and ESKAPE pathogens fall into the critical and high category (Mancuso et al., 2021). Antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species) are of serious concern as these opportunistic bacteria can survive in diverse environments, and spread rapidly (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2022). Infections caused by these pathogens account for more than 700,000 death globally each year causing serious public health concerns (Mancuso et al., 2021; Østergaard et al., 2022). WHO has asked the researchers to emphasize more on the top pathogens such as P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii for their antibacterial drug development programs. Given our current understanding of antimicrobial resistance development, it is agreed that to combat the rising resistance to traditional antibiotics, next-generation antibacterial drugs with unique structures, mode of action and high host biocompatibility are urgently needed. AMPs are considered promising next-generation antimicrobial candidates for treating emerging multidrug-resistant pathogens as they satisfy most of the criteria set.\n\nAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) also known as host defense peptides (HDPs), are naturally occurring evolutionary conserved, short peptides (<50 amino acids) consisting of a high proportion of hydrophobic (e.g. phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, tryptophan) and cationic amino acids (e.g. arginine and lysine) with a broad range of activities such as antimicrobial activity, immunomodulation, wound healing, cell-cell communication, homeostasis, etc. (Pasupuleti et al., 2012; Haney et al., 2017; Li et al., 2022). Both bacteria and AMPs existed together for billion years but still, there is a very low level of probability of bacteria developing resistance against AMPs (Gayathri et al., 2021). The major factor for high evolution success is their ability to kill the pathogens by themselves and act in synergy with other AMPs or antibiotics, or immune system components (Lazzaro et al., 2020; Magana et al., 2020). In nature, AMPs can be synthesized in the host as innate immunity components or generated under in vivo conditions by proteolysis of host proteins containing cryptic antimicrobial epitopes (Pane et al., 2018; Pizzo et al., 2018; de Oliveira Costa and Franco, 2020). A strategy based upon the in silico screening of proteins for segments with characteristic biophysical parameters required for intended activity, followed by biological assays and toxicity, may prove a way for robust and high throughput discovery of lead candidates for developing biotherapeutics (Pane et al., 2018; Pizzo et al., 2018; Jhong et al., 2019; Burdukiewicz et al., 2020). Using this idea, Horam et al. (2019) explored the antibacterial activity of a peptide (YRA-15) derived from the human protein glutathione s-transferase (Horam et al., 2019; Raj et al., 2021). This peptide was reported to have antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus and K. pneumoniae, but had cytotoxic activity (∼50%) towards eukaryotic cells. The increased cytotoxicity activity is correlated to higher hydrophobicity which is in agreement with the results shown by others (Wang et al., 2021). Hence in this present investigation, we designed and synthesized various YRA-15 peptide analogues, such that the hydrophobicity is slightly reduced and to compensate for the loss, cationic nature is increased. All the designed peptides were subjected to extensive in silico analysis in terms of cationicity, hydrophobicity, hydrophobic moment, aggregation, etc. using various artificial intelligence-based online software programs. After analysis, two hit potential peptides were identified, which were then evaluated in biologically relevant conditions for antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity, mode of action and in vivo activity. The synthesized peptides YRA-1513 and YRA-15–23 showed antimicrobial activity both in the austere buffer and in vivo conditions. This study has enabled us to optimize an approach, where peptides can be designed and developed using a minimum amount of resources.\n\n2. Methodology\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nAll the peptides YRA 15–13 (YRAGLLRIARIRRRL), YRA 15–23 (YRALLLRIARIRRRL) and LL37 (LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES) used in this work were synthesized by Fmoc solid-phase synthesis protocol and obtained from Genscript, USA. Peptide purity (>95%) was tested and confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry before diluting them in H2O (5 mM stock). All the peptides have an amidated C- terminus. This stock solution was stored at –20 °C, until use. The microbes used in the present study were K. pneumoniae ATCC 27,736, A. baumannii ATCC 1605, P. aeruginosa ATCC 25,668, and S. aureus ATCC 29,213 were obtained from ATCC, USA.\n\n2.2. In silico designing software\n\nThe peptides biophysical characteristics like hydrophobicity (%) were calculated by Peptide 2.0 (https://www.peptide2.com/N_peptide_hydrophobicity_hydrophilicity.php), whereas PEP-FOLD3 server was used to model secondary structures of peptides (https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/PEP-FOLD3/). To see the distribution pattern of the amino acids as hydrophobic and hydrophilic planes, HeliQuest was used (https://heliquest.ipmc.cnrs.fr/cgi-bin/ComputParams.py).\n\n2.3. Bacterial culture and preparation for the experiment\n\nBriefly, a loop of bacteria grown on blood agar plates was transferred to 10 mL of 3% w/v tryptic soy broth (TSB) and cultured for 12–18 h. Then 200 µL of overnight culture was added to fresh 10 mL of 3% w/v tryptic soy broth (TSB), and test bacteria were cultured to the mid-logarithmic phase. Bacteria were centrifuged at 10,000 RPM for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was diluted in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 to get 1–2 × 109 CFU/mL of the bacterial suspension.\n\n2.4. Radial diffusion assay\n\nThe radial diffusion assay (RDA) was conducted basically as previously described (Horam et al., 2019). After preparing the bacterial suspension of 1–2 × 109 CFU/mL, bacteria were added to 15 mL of underlay agarose gel (0.03% (w/v) TSB, 1% (w/v) low electroendosmosis (EEO) type agarose and 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20) such that the final concentration of the bacteria reaches 4 × 106 CFU/mL and poured into a 140 mm petri plate. After the underlay gel got solidified, holes of 4 mm in diameter were punched, and 6 µL peptide solutions with various concentrations (25, 50, and 100 µM) were then added. To allow peptides to diffuse into the gel, Petri plates were incubated in the upright position for 3 h then, 15 mL of overlay gel (0.03% (w/v) TSB and 1% (w/v) low electroendosmosis (EEO) type agarose) was poured. Further incubation was done for 16–24 h at 37 °C. The zone of inhibition around each well, which was measured in mm, served as a visual representation of the peptide's antimicrobial activity.\n\n2.5. Minimum inhibitory concentration\n\nBy using the broth microdilution method as per CLSI (previously known as NCLS) guidelines, peptides were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activity, as described elsewhere (Pasupuleti et al., 2009; Horam et al., 2019). Briefly, Bacteria were grown overnight in 3% TSB to mid-logarithmic phase, centrifuged, and washed two times in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and re-suspended in 2 X of cation-adjusted MHB broth (Becton Dickinson, USA) to get 1 × 105 CFU/mL. In a 96-well microtiter plate (polypropylene, Costar Corp., Cat. No. 3790), serially diluted peptide concentration (160 µM to 0.31 µM) was added to each corresponding well followed by the addition of 50 µL of 2 X of cation-adjusted MHB broth containing 1 × 105 CFU/mL bacteria and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. MIC values were determined by visual inspection of plates and that value was considered where growth inhibition observed was greater than 90%. MIC determination and the assay were performed in triplicate. A negative control where no peptide was added is included in each assay, whereas LL37 peptide was used as a positive control.\n\n2.6. Viable count assay\n\nTo examine the impact of salt or plasma on peptides, VCA was also carried out as described elsewhere (Pasupuleti et al., 2008), in the presence of 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0 with 0.15 M NaCl or 20% heat-inactivated human citrate plasma. Bacteria of interest were grown in 10 mL of TSB and incubated at 37 °C until the mid-logarithmic phase. After washing with 10 mM Tris buffer, the bacteria pellet was re-suspended in 10 mM Tris buffer containing 10 mM glucose to get 1 × 109 CFU/mL bacterial suspension. The culture was further diluted to 1000 X in 10 mM Tris buffer containing 10 mM glucose with or without salt or plasma and incubated with peptides at the indicated concentration for 2 h at 37 °C. Following the peptide treatment, the samples were serially diluted and plated on Todd Hewitt (TH) medium and incubated for 16–18 h at 37 °C.\n\n2.7. Hemolysis assay\n\nFor the hemolysis assay, blood was collected from a human volunteer in a vacutainer containing anticoagulant EDTA (10.8 mg) and centrifuged at 2800 RPM for 10 min as stated previously elsewhere (Stromstedt et al., 2009; Setty et al., 2017). The buffy coat and plasma were removed, and RBCs were then rinsed three times with 1X PBS, pH 7.4, and re-suspended in the same buffer to get 5% RBCs suspension. They were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C over the roller shaker in the presence of peptides (50 and 100 µM), followed by centrifugation at 2800 RPM for 10 min. The percentage of hemolysized RBS after treatment was estimated by measuring the amount of hemoglobin present in the supernatant, by transferring 100 µL of supernatant to a 96-well plate. The absorbance at 540 nm was measured with a Tecan Infinite M Nano+ spectrometer and expressed as% of Triton X-100 induced hemolysis. Two percent Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was taken as the positive control. The use of human blood was approved by the CSIR-CDRI human ethical Committee (CDRI/IEC/2014/A1).\n\nHemolysis (%) was calculated according to the following equation:\n\nHemolysis (%) = [(treated sample-blank)/(triton X100-blank)] x 100\n\n2.8. Protease sensitivity assay\n\nTo investigate the stability of peptides against the protease of both bacterial as well as the human origin, this assay was performed. Protease stability studies were done as described elsewhere (Malmsten et al., 2011). Briefly, test peptides (1 µg) were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with V8 protease (0.1 μg 25,000 units/mg), Proteinase K, and Human neutrophil elastase (0.4 μg, 29 units/mg), in a total volume of 30 μl. The reaction was stopped after the incubation period by heating the sample in 4X Lammelie buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. The degradation of the peptide was then examined on 16.5% precast SDS-PAGE Tris-Tricine gels following Coomassie Blue R-250 staining, followed by destaining. The gel was then analyzed using the ImageJ software (https://imagej.net/ij/index.html).\n\n2.9. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay\n\nMTT assay was performed to check the growth-promoting or inhibiting effects of peptides using BV-2 and THP-1 cells (Raj et al., 2021). Separately BV-2 and THP-1, 3000 cells/well in 96 well plates were grown in presence of 10% FBS till the confluence stage, followed by peptide addition to 50 and 100 µM concentration. After overnight incubation at 5% CO2 and 37 °C, 20 µL of filter-sterilized MTT (5 mg/mL in 1X PBS) was added to each well of 96 well plate. The plates were then incubated for an 1 h. After aspirating the MTT-containing media, blue formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 µl of DMSO. Then plates were swirled gently for 10 min at room temperature to completely dissolve blue formazan followed by measuring the absorbance at 550 nm. The mean values obtained from triplicate measurements are represented here.\n\n2.10. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay\n\nIn MTT assay, there is possibility of getting false positive results, if the peptides supress the growth of the cells. Thus, to complement the MTT results, an LDH assay was performed, with minor modification (Raj et al., 2021), after the treatment of BV-2 and THP-1 cells with the desired peptide concentration (50 and 100 µM) for 24 h, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 1500 RPM and mixed with LDH-based Roche cytotoxicity kit reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions. The LDH release from 1% Triton X-100 is considered the positive control (100% LDH release). The results represented here are the mean from three independent experiments.\n\n2.11. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy\n\nTo find out the secondary structure of peptides in the presence of biological membranes, circular dichroism spectra of peptides were obtained on a Jasco J-1500 Spectropolarimeter. All measurements were carried out in triplicate in a quartz cuvette (1 mm path length) at 37 °C with water, buffer and peptide. Liposomes at a concentration of 0.1 mM were monitored in the wavelength range of 190–250 nm. The background noise, where no peptide signal is present was subtracted, to account for instrumental differences between measurements.\n\n2.12. Scanning electron microscopy\n\nMost AMP's mode of action is through membrane damage or rupturing. Scanning electron microscopy was done to see the effects of the peptides on the membrane of P. aeruginosa ATCC 25,668, A. baumannii ATCC 1605, K. pneumoniae ATCC 27,736, and S. aureus ATCC 29,213. Bacteria were grown, washed and treated with the peptides at 100 µM concentration. After treatment with peptides, bacteria were rinsed three times with 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4 before being fixed with 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer at 4 °C for an overnight period. Following fixing, bacteria were washed two times with 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4 to remove the fixative and were dehydrated using a graded ethanol series (50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%) for 15 min at a time, and then dried using a critical point dryer After sputter coating with gold, the cells were examined under a scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 250, Netherlands) at 20 kV using the secondary electron detector.\n\n2.13. Flow cytometry\n\nFlow cytometry analysis was done to confirm the SEM results. P. aeruginosa ATCC 25,668, A. baumannii ATCC 1605, K. pneumoniae ATCC 27,736, and S. aureus ATCC 29,213 were grown to midlogarithmic phase in 3% TSB medium, centrifuged, and washed with 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and resuspended in the same buffer to obtain 1 × 109 CFU/mL of the bacterial suspension. The bacterial suspension was incubated with the peptide (100 µM) at 37 °C for 1 h. The bacteria were stained with 200 µl of propidium iodide (10 µM) for 15 min at room temperature in dark under shaking conditions, followed by repeated washing with the same buffer. The pellet was suspended in 500 µL of 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4. For the data acquisition, the FACS caliber flow cytometer was used with a gate setting for the intact bacterial cell population and data processing was done in the logarithmic mode.\n\n2.14. Liposome preparation and leakage assay\n\nLarge unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared in accordance with the methodology described elsewhere with minor modifications using the freeze-thaw method (Dutta et al., 2020). Anionic lipids (3:1) or zwitterionic PC were dissolved in 1 mL of chloroform and then dried under vacuum for 8 h. Subsequently, 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8 was added together with calcein (1.6 mg/mL) in a 5 mL glass vessel and left on a shaker overnight at 150 RPM. After five freeze-thaw cycles with liquid nitrogen and heating to 60 °C in the water bath, lipid suspensions were extruded 15–20 times through 100 µm polycarbonate membranes mounted in a Lipofast mini extruder (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) at 25 °C (Ha et al., 2021). Liposome untrapped calcein was removed through Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) column by passing sample three times at 25 °C with 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8 as eluent. Liposomes were treated with peptides and calcein release was measured by monitoring the emitted fluorescence at 520 nm (excitation at 470 nm). At the end of the experiment, 0.1% Triton X-100 was used as an absolute leakage scale. Measurements were performed in triplicate at 25 °C by using a Tecan Infinite M Nano+ spectrometer.\n\n2.15. Animal experiments (burn wound model)\n\nThe peptides antibacterial ability in complex environments was evaluated in the whole burn wound model as described elsewhere (Wasef et al., 2020; Hernandez et al., 2021). Balb/c mice (15–25 g) used for this study were obtained at the National Laboratory Animal Center of the CSIR-CDRI institute after due approval from the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC/2021/41). Animals were allowed to adapt to the laboratory environment for one week before experiments. The animals were housed in individually ventilated (IV) cages (n = 5/cage) in the animal house, and maintained under standard conditions (temperature 23 ± 3 °C, relative humidity 60–70%, 12 h of a day-light cycle) with full access to food and water throughout the experiment. After the acclimatization period, a circle (5 cm diameter) was marked by using the marker on the dorsum side of the mice. The marked area was clean shaved by using hair removal cream (Veet) and animals were left for 24 h for the recovery. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (90 mg/Kg) plus xylazine (4.5 mg/ Kg) and burn wound (4 mm diameter) was created by placing the soldering rod (set at 310 C) on the previously shaved skin surface of mice for 10 s.. Then 50 µl of 1 × 109 CFU/mL of P. aeruginosa ATCC 25,668 suspension was poured over the wound and was allowed to dry, followed by an IP injection of 1 mL of 0.9% saline using a 1 cc syringe with a 25-gage needle, to compensate the fluid loss. Then the animal was transferred to a new cage and on day zero, 100 µl peptide formulation (Hypromellose-500 mg + Peptide-2 X MIC + PEG 400–2.5 mL + Milli Q-5 mL) was applied to the burnt area twice (1st dose, 2 h post-surgery and 2nd dose, 6 h after 1st peptide dose), after that single dose peptide formulation was applied once a day up to 12 days. Colistin was taken as the positive control (2.5 mg/Kg). Wound size and bacterial count were performed to check for infection progression.\n\n2.16. Statistics\n\nStatistical significance was done using the SigmaStat; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL Version 14 software. The mean and standard deviation of the triplicate biological repeat experiments are reported here. The significance was considered at P<0.05 and the ANOVA or student t-Test was used as indicated in the figure legends.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Synthetic peptide design, characterization, and antibacterial activity\n\nIn this present study, we synthesized two potential hit peptide analogues YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 based on the YRA-15 peptide template, which was previously demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against S. aureus (Horam et al., 2019) but with cytotoxicity above the accepted limit of 20% against eukaryotic cells (Table Sup 1 & Fig. S1). In determining the antimicrobial activity of peptides charge and hydrophobicity play a crucial role (Clark et al., 2021). To reduce the cytotoxicity, but to keep the antimicrobial activity intact, various analogues of peptides were designed by replacing methionine at the 4th and 13th position in YRA-15 with less hydrophobic (glycine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine) amino acids. The rationale for focusing on methionine amino acid was two-fold, analysis of the AMP databases showed us that it is the least represented polar aliphatic amino acid in the naturally occurring AMPs (Wang et al., 2015). Second, our in silico protease cleavage site analysis showed that human neutrophil elastase cleaves YRA-15 after methionine (data not shown). Even though, there is a possibility of replacing the charged amino acids arginine with lysine or histidine. We refrained from making any further modifications, as studies with antimicrobial peptides like magainin, MP196, and LL-37 demonstrated that the replacement of arginine with lysine reduces the antimicrobial activity (Jiang et al., 2011; Rice and Wereszczynski, 2017; Clark et al., 2021). Noteworthy, phylogenetic analysis revealed that charged amino acids are conserved all along the evolution in the YRA sequence (Fig. S2). To add on, our previous experience has taught us that is it important to balance hydrophobic-hydrophilic amino acids while designing pharmaceutical-relevant antimicrobial peptides.\n\nVarious peptide analogues designed based on this input were then subjected to in-depth in silico analysis using various software that predicts their charge, hydrophobicity, aggregation propensity, hydrophobic moment, activity and cytotoxicity etc. (Fields et al., 2020). Based on the in silico results, peptides that showed a net charge above +5 and hydrophobicity in the range of 45 – 60% were selected. Among them, two most likely hit candidates were shortlisted for the biological evaluation. A depicts α-helical wheel projections and three-dimensional structures of the peptide analogues and the results tell us that our peptide analogues can form an alpha-helix. The peptide sequence, net charge and hydrophobicity are summarized in .\n\nTable 1\n\nPeptideExpected Mol.

The results indicate that the peptides had significant antimicrobial activity against all the tested bacterial strains as compared to the control peptide LL37. To countercheck the results, another experiment i.e. minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) was performed and the results are summarized in . Both peptide analogues had inhibitory activities in the range of 2.5–80 μM against bacteria, which indicated that they have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity same as control peptide LL37.\n\nTable 2\n\nPeptide codeSequence of peptidesNet charge (at pH 7)Hydrophobicity (%)MIC values in µM (µg/mL)Gram (-)Gram (+)P. aeruginosa ATCC 25,668P. aeruginosa ATCC 27,853A. baumannii ATCC 1605K. pneumoniae ATCC 27,736S. aureus ATCC 29,213YRA15–13YRAGLLRIARIRRRL646.675 (9.41)2.5 (4.70)40 (75.28)160 (301.12)80 (150.56)YRA15–23YRALLLRIARIRRRL653.332.5 (4.85)1.25 (2.42)10 (19.38)80 (155.06)10 (19.38)LL37LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES637.841.25 (5.62)1.25 (5.61)10 (44.93)80 (359.46)10 (44.93)\n\n3.2. Salt, plasma sensitivity and time-killing kinetics assay\n\nThe physiological environment like plasma and salt can influence the peptide activity. Peptide ability to show the intended activity under such conditions is advantageous when it comes to systemic administrations. Therefore, to assess the activity in the presence of salt and plasma, peptides were tested in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl and 20% human citrate plasma. As shown in , we observed that the antimicrobial activity of peptides in the case of Tris buffer, pH 7.4 and 0.15 M NaCl was around 3 µM against all the tested bacteria. Interestingly, the antimicrobial activity of both peptides was similar under all conditions including reference peptide LL37. However as expected the peptides, YRA15–13 showed activity at 1 or 2-fold higher concentration than in the salt except in the case of P. aeruginosa. It can be argued that antimicrobial activity observed in the plasma could be due to complement factor-mediated rather than the peptide alone. To study the influence of complement factors on peptides in the killing of the bacteria, we carried out VCA in the presence and absence of heat-inactivated citrate plasma ( ). The study demonstrates that YRA15–13 can directly inhibit the bacteria and act in synergy with host complement factors to kill the pathogen rapidly. On contrary YRA15–23 works independently of the complement system and rapidly kills almost all the bacteria within 1 h at 30 and 60 µM concentrations both in the presence and absence of heat-inactivated citrate plasma. Based on this observation we concluded that YRA15–23 retains stable antibacterial activity in the plasma environment.\n\n3.3. Cytotoxicity, hemolytic, and protease stability assay\n\nAny molecule on the journey to becoming a drug needs to demonstrate its non-cytotoxic nature and specificity toward the intended target. The multifunction potential of AMPs always creates a cloud of doubt, that it might have cytotoxic or cell growth inhibiting/promoting activities (Pasupuleti et al., 2012). To shed light on these aspects peptides cytotoxicity was tested against BV-2 (murine-derived microglial cell) and THP-1 (human-derived monocyte) cell lines by MTT and LDH release assays at 50 µM and 100 µM (i.e. at 20 and 40X MIC value) concentrations and compared to that of control LL37. Negligible cytotoxicity was observed for YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 peptide analogues against BV-2 and THP-1 ( A & B).\n\nTo rule out the role of plasma binding or proteolytic degradation of peptides in the absence of cytotoxicity results, peptides were made to interact with human erythrocytes in the presence of buffer compared to the reference peptide LL37, both had lower hemolytic activities at 50 µM and 100 µM except for YRA15–23 which showed slight hemolytic activities, but within the accepted limit, at 100 µM. It is well reported in the literature that most peptides lose their cytotoxicity in the whole blood (Malmsten et al., 2011). Further, the non-cleavage of the peptide by the plasma proteases was confirmed by subjecting the peptides to bacteria and host proteases and analyzing them using Tris-Tricine gel. The coomassie brilliant blue g stained gel were subjected to band intensity analysis suing the ImageJ software. The results confirm that the peptides are highly stable and can withstand the attack of proteases. However, LL37 was cleaved by all proteases ( D & Fig. S3). The results were as expected as our design strategy at the initial stage aimed at considering cleavage sites of host proteases and avoiding them. However, we observed that peptides could resist the non-sequence specific, broad-range protease of bacterial origin also. Probably the propensity of AMPs to aggregate might affect the accessibility of cleavage sites to the bacterial proteases (Clark et al., 2021). This aspect needs to be investigated in subsequent studies.\n\n3.4. Mode of action studies\n\nAs most AMPs primary mode of action is through membrane permeabilization, we primarily focused on examining the ultrastructure changes induced on the bacteria after peptide treatment using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacteria treated with peptides YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 at 100 µM concentration for 30 min, showed disrupted cytoplasm membrane, and bacterial cell lysis ( ). On the contrary, untreated bacterial cells were found with intact cell walls and well-defined membranes. The membrane integrity damaging effects by the peptides were further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (FACS) using DNA-binding membrane impermeant fluorescent dye Propidium iodide (PI). As shown in Fig. S4, flow cytometry analysis revealed that the bacteria had access to the membrane impermeant marker PI, which is not feasible if membranes were intact. This, confirms the fact that both YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 peptides kill bacteria through membrane disruption.\n\n3.5. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra analyses and calcein leakage assay\n\nSEM and FACS data together clearly suggest that peptides act by membrane destabilization method. Further, the specificity of membrane lytic properties of peptides was confirmed by Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) leakage assay consisting of PC (neutrally charged phosphatidylcholine) or PG (Negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol) and water-soluble fluorescent probe calcein. It is well reported in the literature that by using the large unilamellar vesicles we can investigate whether any receptor-mediated interaction is involved in the antibacterial activity or not (Dutta et al., 2020; Carey et al., 2022). When LUV come in contact with peptides, the liposomal membrane gets destabilized followed by the release of calcein dye, which results in fluorescence. For prokaryotic mimicking liposomes (PE/PG) ( A), we observed that more than 80% of calcein was released at 1 µM peptide concentrations, and these results were equivalent to those of the reference peptide LL37. The results demonstrated that tested peptides destabilized membranes, causing calcein leakage and were also highly selective for prokaryotic mimicking liposomes. Moreover, as YRA15–23 weakly interacts with eukaryotic mimicking liposomes (PC) ( B) Thus, it is highly suitable as a therapeutic agent.\n\nNext, we investigated the secondary structure of peptides by CD as the α-helix forming ability of peptides has a direct impact on its antimicrobial activity and exhibited a potent bacterial membrane-damaging mechanism (Gou et al., 2021). As shown in C, 6D, 6E, and 6F, both YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 peptides show a random coil structure in Milli Q and Tris buffer, and a partial α-helical structure in PE/PG, and PC liposomes, whereas LL37 exhibited two large negative peaks in all conditions at approximately 200 nm and at 226 nm, which indicated its existence as α-helix form (Engelberg and Landau, 2020).\n\n3.6. Efficacy of YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 in vivo\n\nOur initial ex vivo investigations focused on testing the efficacy of peptides to kill P. aeruginosa on biocompatible materials e.g., contact lenses showed that YRA15–23 can reduce the bacteria more than 2-log ( A). Our years of drug discovery experience have taught us that, even though a peptide show appreciable or better than golden standard activity under in vitro conditions it is not always possible to replicate the same under in vivo conditions. Therefore, we tried to explore the potency of YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 in the P. aeruginosa-infected burn wound model. As demonstrated in B, compared to the negative bacterial control, the bacterial counts of P. aeruginosa in the wound significantly decreased within 48 h after treatment with YRA15–13 and YRA15–23. But there was no significant difference between the YRA15–13 and YRA15–23, and colistin formulation treatment. These antibacterial effects of YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 in the mouse wound infection model are consistent with their in vitro antibacterial activities against P. aeruginosa. C showed at the 2X MIC concentration of YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 is as effective as colistin in treating wound infection caused by P. aeruginosa. Based on the obtained results, we summarized that YRA15–23 can efficiently inhibit the bacteria in the wounds.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nAmong ESKAPE pathogens, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are of major concern as they are opportunistic bacterium that causes significant morbidity and death in susceptible hosts. Most antibiotics used to treat P. aeruginosa infections fail to clear the infections or prevent high morbidity and mortality due to its inherent ability to resist antimicrobial agents (Serra et al., 2015; Esposito et al., 2016; Spernovasilis et al., 2021). Hence, to combat the rising resistance of pathogens to traditional antibiotics, new antibacterial drugs need to be developed.\n\nIn this present investigation, we designed and synthesized YRA-15 peptide analogues. Peptide YRA-15 with hydrophobicity (60%), hydrophobic moment (0.375), and charge (+5) was previously reported by us for its antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus, and K. pneumoniae and was stable towards bacterial and host proteases (Horam et al., 2019). One major drawback shown by the peptide is higher cytotoxicity towards eukaryotic cells. Hydrophobicity is one of the biophysical parameters which is extensively linked to cytotoxicity. Not only that it can also influence the self-association of peptides which prevents the peptide from passing through the prokaryotic cell membranes, whereas increased peptide self-association does not affect peptide access to eukaryotic membranes (Vermeer et al., 2012; Clark et al., 2021). Probably there might be an optimum hydrophobicity window in which high antimicrobial activity can be obtained with reduced cytotoxicity. Any changes beyond this window, significantly reduced antibacterial effectiveness while increasing hemolytic activity (Pasupuleti et al., 2012).\n\nHere we aimed to decrease the cytotoxicity of the peptide by decreasing hydrophobicity and increasing net positive charge. Peptide length was kept constant as there was a positive association between hemolytic activity and peptide length i.e., with an increase in peptide length hemolytic activity increases (Clark et al., 2021). To enhance the antibacterial activity, we chose double substitutions replacement strategy where methionine at the 4th and 13th position in the original peptide sequence (YRAMLLRIARIRMRL) was replaced with a combination of aliphatic uncharged amino acids (glycine, isoleucine and leucine) aromatic uncharged amino acid (phenylalanine) and positively charged amino acid (arginine).\n\nOnce the different variants are made, they were subjected to the determination of biophysical parameters such as hydrophobicity, hydrophobic moment and net positive charge, charge clustering, hydrophobicity patches, etc. using artificial intelligence based in silico analysis tools (Jhong et al., 2019; Burdukiewicz et al., 2020). Sequences consisting of more than 2 hydrophobicity patches and charge clustering were avoided as they are likely to show issues downstream (Zapadka et al., 2017; Sankar et al., 2018; Duque et al., 2023).\n\nBased upon the results, we picked two top-scoring contenders for biological evaluation i.e., YRA15–13 and YRA15–23, both with a + 6 net positive charge, thus increasing cationicity while hydrophobicity was optimum. We increased the net positive charge as it has been already shown by other researchers that increasing the charge up to +6 improves antibacterial activity and may compensate for the decrease in the hydrophobicity (Pasupuleti et al., 2009; Yin et al., 2012). Previous research has demonstrated that utilizing cationic residues to increase the cationicity of AMPs can boost their antibacterial efficacy, as cationicity mediates the initial electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged bacterial cell surface (Jiang et al., 2011). Even though the shortlisted peptides showed activity against all the tested bacteria, YRA15–23 showed a better antimicrobial activity probably due to 3 hydrophobic amino acids (LLL) at the N-terminus. This hydrophobicity patch might have aided the peptide in deeper penetration into the membrane. Our analysis is in perfect agreement with the data reported earlier that the presence of 3 hydrophobic amino acids in a stretch significantly increases the activity (Schmidtchen et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2021). Further, arginine residues can make hydrogen bonds with the water and negatively charged phospholipid heads of membranes simultaneously. This interaction favours the peptides in submerging themselves into the lipid bilayer and subsequent membrane disruption. The antibacterial spectrum of analogues was strong against P. aeruginosa ATCC 25,668, but not significantly high against K. pneumoniae ATCC 27,736, and A. baumannii ATCC 1605 which indicated that peptide activity varies from bacteria to bacteria. It is reported in the literature that bacterial membrane potential ranges, depending on genus, from – 20 to − 150 mV. Probably, this difference in the membrane potential might have accounted for the difference in the activity spectrum. Understanding the membrane potentials of pathogens might shed further light or lead to the development of peptides with high activity against a broad range of pathogens. It needs to be investigated, how the different bacterial species consisting of the different membrane potentials interact with the peptides with the same charge. Whether there is any relationship between the overall net charge or charge distribution on the peptide and the antibacterial activity spectrum. We believe that these point needs to be investigated in future research.\n\nThe extreme toxicity of AMPs such as the bee venom peptide melittin, polymyxin B to mammalian cells has limited their practical application as a new class of potential antibacterial agents (Soman et al., 2009). YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 demonstrated minimal hemolytic ( C) and cytotoxicity activity against the BV-2 and THP-1 cell lines ( A, B). Our previous research has shown us that peptides containing 70–80% of hydrophobic residues were shown to be highly toxic to eukaryotic cells (Setty et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2019; Mello et al., 2020). The most rational explanation for the low cytotoxicity of YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 peptides is, lower hydrophobicity and distributed net charge along the length of the peptide (Rice and Wereszczynski, 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Duque et al., 2023). Based upon the available literature, we propose that positively charged amino acids might have promoted the initial binding of the peptide to the bacterial surface and the absence of competition for binding sites between the charged amino acids and membranes might hold up them in the proximity. Thereby, hydrophobic residues might disrupt the bacterial membranes. On the contrary, peptides are repelled from the eukaryotic membrane surface as they are neutrally-charged (Rice and Wereszczynski, 2017; Lyu et al., 2019). Considering all the parameters, we conclude that the lack of toxicity of the YRA15 peptide analogues is due to lower hydrophobicity.\n\nOur in vitro liposome leakage data is in perfect agreement with the free energy simulations studies of arginine-rich peptides i.e., peptides remain disordered in solution, but when inserted into the membranes, they form amphipathic helix structure (Rice and Wereszczynski, 2017). The fluorescence generated from calcein released from liposomes revealed that peptides destroyed the bacterial cells by breaking the membrane and fluorescence is directly proportional to the peptide's capacity to rupture the membrane ( A, B). YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 were disrupting bacterial mimics in the same way as LL37 ( A). Complied data from SEM, flow cytometry and liposomes clearly shows that both YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 peptides kill bacteria by disrupting their membranes.\n\nIn deep burn injury, microbial infection is the primary clinical manifestation that leads to poor healing, disability or mortality. Deep burn injury is one of the severe injuries that start with the loss of structure and function of the skin, and a subsequent increase in microbial infections, invasion, and sepsis. Due to the absence of vascular skin, current treatment regimens such as systemic antibiotics, skin substitutes, early debridement, and fluid resuscitation are not effective. Hence researchers are focusing on the development of next-generation hydrogels enriched with synthetic antimicrobial peptides that inhibit the microbes in the burn wound environment as well as promote healing (Shariati et al., 2020; Kopecki, 2021, 2021). Usually, burnt wound patients who survive the early phase of skin damage are subjected to protracted hospitalization due to P. aeruginosa infections (Magana et al., 2020). Usually, the mean pH of the normal skin is slightly acidic i.e. 5.5. This acidic conditions prevent the multiplication of the pathogenic and saprophytic bacteria. However, the pH value of the burned skin is alkaline (i.e. 7.5–9.5) for the first 4-days post burn and then slowly returns back to acidic conditions. During this window period pathogenic bacteria multiply on the skin. We first investigated peptides efficacy effectively in the slightly alkaline conditions. Our results show that the peptide YRA-15–13 showed no significant difference in the antimicrobial activity in the different tested alkaline conditions. On contrary, YRA-15–23 showed a statistical significant difference in antimicrobial activity at very low concentration (0.6 μM) at higher alkaline pH. However, at higher concentration (3 μM) we did not find any statistical significant difference in antimicrobial activity (Fig. S5). Next, we evaluated the in vivo activity of the peptide by applying a formulation consisting of the peptide on the bacterial infected (P.aeruginosa ATCC 25,668) burn wound. Both YRA15–13 and YRA15–23 dramatically reduced bacterial numbers in the wound region ( B), indicating that peptides have antibacterial action under physiological settings and might be employed as potential antimicrobial agents against P. aeruginosa skin infections. Our wound size measurement data is agreement with the previous observations of various researcher.\n\nHost defense peptides in addition to the antimicrobial activity, show other activities like chemotaxis, wound healing, immunomodulatory ete functions also. Based upon the obtained wound healing data we speculate that the YRA 15–13 may show immunomodulatory or accelerated wound healing process. One of the limitations of this study is, we did not investigate the immunomodulatory or the molecular mechanism of wound healing by the YRA15–13 and YRA15–23."
