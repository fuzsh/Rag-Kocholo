        "text": "Sikkim is the smallest state of India with rich culture, heritage, and natural biodiversity. Beautiful landscape, rivers, lakes, forests, mountains and cold desert, there is everything here one can dream of a place. Eleven areas in Sikkim as ecotourism zones have been identified and distinguished by The Directorate of Ecotourism under the Forest, Environment and Wildlife Management Department which is developed under JICA assisted Sikkim Biodiversity Conservation and Forest Management Project (SBFP). The objective of this paper has explored the status and prospectus of Ecotourism Development in Sikkim. For the study secondary data has been used in the form of published research articles and Sikkim government \" tourism and ecotourism Policies etc. It can be concluded that Sikkim has a great potential for ecotourism development while following sustainable practices. It was found that that the locals participate in ecotourism activities only for enjoying economic benefits either in the form of increased job opportunities, income or improved infrastructure and tourists had favorable attitude towards ecotourism experience but there is a need to retain a balance between conservation of natural and cultural resources and provide economic development with regular growth.\n\nAbstract The present study examines the impact of tourism industry on regional economic and health status in Sikkim state.

It is an oldest Pass from Sikkim to Tibet, now TAR-China (Tibet Autonomous Region-China). The continuation of cross-border trade from Nathula Pass on 6th July, 2006 gave the way to more benefits to India through trade along with the promotion of the tourism in theregion. After reopening of India-China cross-border trade on 6th, July 2006 through Nathu La pass, it not only shows a benefit in trade but there is a growth of tourism in this region. With the increasing inflow of tourists to NathuLa, the economic benefit is open the region and its people. In this context, the present study examines the impact of reopening of cross-border trade through Nathu La pass on the promotion of tourism in the region. The rising trend of exports shows the positive impact of Nathula trade to India. The data, obtained through secondary sources shows that the exports of Indian goods to China is more than imports. The export of Indian goods to China has increased from 8.87 Lakhs in 2006 to 4.02 Crores in 2010. The import for the year 2010 is Nil against 4.02 crores of exports. With the rising trend in the volume of export, it is clear that the cross-border trade through Nathula Pass is beneficial to India. The impact of reopening of Nathu La pass for trade between India and China is not only results in economic benefits from trade but also results in the promotion of tourism in the region and its impact on tourism.The study revealed that there is a growth in the tourism after the reopening of Nathu La pass for international trade and expected to grow further more in the future, providing the income and employment to the local people but along with maintaining the sustainability in the region. The sustainability of tourism, in this highly natured sensitive zone, is equally important and most. The further research is required to analyse the tourism and its sustainability in the region.

Tourism is one of the important services providing industry in Sikkim state. Its rapid growth contributed in the socio-economic development of the region. The increase of tourists’ influx resulted in the economic benefit to the regional economy by providing income and employment to the local community people. The growth of real GSDP percapita is used as a measure of economic growth. The statistical test shows that there is a positive correlation between Percapita GSDP and tourists’ influx. There is enormous increase in tourists’ inflows to Sikkim in last decade, which shows it growth in tourism. The Percapita GSDP is increasing significantly over a period of time along with the expansion of the tourism sector. It has increased from Rs. 17428 (1999-00) to Rs. 29506 (2008-09). Trade, tourism, hotels, transportation, and agriculture have been found as key drivers to GSDP. The estimated average annual growth of real GSDP percapita is 6.3 percent. This study shows that the tourists’ inflows have its positive impact on the regional economy. It shows the growth of tourism and its contribution to the economy.\n\nAbstract Ecotourism has emerged as one of the development tool, which aims to protect the natural environment and cultural diversity by attracting the ecotourism and generating revenue for the local people without harming nature. Growing share of world tourism arrivals that in return assures increased length of stay, visitor’s expenditure and the income retained within the region is under noticed in the region. Tourism being one of the most essential aspects of sustainable development of both Himalayan countries India and Bhutan, the cooperation among the two nations can have a prominent impact on the development of both the countries through more friendly and cooperative policies. The region should ensure that the visitors experience a safe environment and unique hospitality, with awareness on the part of resident populations for the opportunities that tourism presents and on the part of visitors, an appreciation of the special characteristics of the region. The region’s highly distinctive environment and culture need to be conserved for the maximum benefit to retain the regions unique identity. It is noted that both countries have their own tourism policies and action plans. The formulation of policies that addresses the place and people in the adjoining transboundary region of Bhutan and India could have an outreaching impact and the promotion of tourism in the transboundary region to foster the tourism business. Regional tourism is not much flourished in this region. International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development has been instrumental in facilitating regional cooperation through its transboundary conservation initiatives. ICIMOD’s Regional Cooperation Framework developed through consultative processes harmonizes national policies and legislation towards effective management of Khangchendzonga landscape and has been a key to achieving environmental and economic sustainability among the countries sharing this complex. Promoting nature tourism on this framework can have a maximum benefit to the livelihoods of the people and the environment. The article share the overview of the existing regional tourism status concerning two regions: Sikkim in India and Bhutan and points towards the need for further regional cooperation in bringing effective regional tourism. This paper also aims to look forth the tourism potential in the region and promote nature based ecotourism through transboundary cooperation in Indo-Bhutan region.
