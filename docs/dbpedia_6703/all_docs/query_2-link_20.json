        "text": "The occurrence of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases over the past few years is a matter of concern and is likely to increase in the near future. This is due to a number of factors and driving forces that have a potential to create a new era of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases. These factors are complicated and the complex nature of the human animal interface is constantly influenced by the effects of climate change, anthropogenic and natural factors. Change in ecosystem, microbial adaptation, climate and weather change, Lack of adequate food safety, international travel and commerce, animal migration, increased human-animal interface, human demographic and behavioral factors, technology and industry, bush meat hunting, and keeping pets are among the most common factors that contribute for the occurrence of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases. Microbial evolution is the intrinsic factor that leads to the emergence of new pathogens, while social and environme...\n\nZoonotic diseases represent one of the leading causes of illness and death from infectious disease. Worldwide, zoonotic diseases have a negative impact on commerce, travel, and economies. In most developing countries, zoonotic diseases are among those diseases of major public health significance and contribute significantly to an already overly burdened public health system. In industrialized nations, zoonotic diseases are of particular concern for at-risk groups such as the elderly, children, childbearing women, and immunocompromised individuals. The World Health Organization has defined zoonoses as, \" diseases and infections naturally transmitted between nonhuman vertebrate animals and humans \" , and emerging zoonotic disease as a \"zoonosis that is newly recognized or newly evolved or that has occurred previously but shows an increase in incidence or expansion in geographical, host or vector range\". However link between humans and animals with respect to diseases could be framed in many but slightly different ways. Strikingly, 75% of emerging infectious diseases have been identified as zoonotic in origin. Moreover if we could link the emergence of some diseases to animals, for e.g. AIDS then the number would be much higher. These agents have included some that maintain an ongoing reservoir life cycle in animals or arthropods, without the permanent establishment of a new life cycle in humans, as well as some \" species jumpers \" that derive from an ancient reservoir life cycle in animals but have subsequently established a new life cycle in humans that no longer involves an animal reservoir. Zoonotic diseases require rather different prevention and control strategies than diseases of etiologic agents employing only human-to-human transmission. Determinants discussed above have to be understood and dealt in proper perspective when it comes to the problem of zoonotic diseases. Different section of workers should collaborate their efforts against dreaded diseases, which are affecting mankind and animals and are continuously posing challenges. Multidisciplinary teams of ecologists, mammalogists, ornithologists, and entomologists, as well as physicians, epidemiologists, public health workers and veterinarians should join hands for intensive and sure success\n\nThere are huge numbers of wild animals distributed throughout the world and the diversity of wildlife species is immense. Each landscape and habitat has a kaleidoscope of niches supporting an enormous variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species, and each species or taxon supports an even more impressive array of macro- and micro-parasites. Infectious pathogens that originate in wild animals have become increasingly important throughout the world in recent decades, as they have had substantial impacts on human health, agricultural production, wildlife-based economies and wildlife conservation. The emergence of these pathogens as significant health issues is associated with a range of causal factors, most of them linked to the sharp and exponential rise of global human activity. Among these causal factors are the burgeoning human population, the increased frequency and speed of local and international travel, the increase in human-assisted movement of animals and animal products, c...\n\nMany new, emerging and re-emerging diseases of humans are caused by pathogens that originate from animals or products of animal origin. A wide variety of both domestic and wild animal species act as reservoirs for these pathogens, which may be viruses, bacteria or parasites. Given the extensive distribution of the animal species affected, the effective surveillance, prevention and control of zoonotic diseases pose a significant challenge. There are direct and indirect implications for public health of emerging zoonoses. Direct implications are defined as the consequences for human health in terms of morbidity and mortality. Indirect implications are defined as the effect of the influence of emerging zoonotic disease on health professionals and the general public. The tremendous indirect impact of emerging zoonotic diseases on public health policy and structures and on public perception of health risks is acknowledged. A biphasic approach for handling emerging zoonoses is proposed, i.e. a short- to intermediate-term response to an outbreak or emergency and a long-term comprehensive study of the ecology of the zoonotic pathogen. Resource-rich countries should invest in the establishment and strengthening of surveillance systems in resource-limited countries considering the international significance of emerging zoonoses. Based on the new international health regulations, emphasis should be placed on building the appropriate preparedness and response capacity in countries and on promoting intersectoral collaboration and coordination.\n\nAnimals are continuously exposed to pathogens but rarely get infected, because pathogens must overcome barriers to establish successful infections. Ongoing planetary changes affect factors relevant for such infections, such as pathogen pressure and pathogen exposure. The replacement of wildlife with domestic animals shrinks the original host reservoirs, whereas expanding agricultural frontiers lead to increased contact between natural and altered ecosystems, increasing pathogen exposure and reducing the area where the original hosts can live. Climate change alters species’ distributions and phenology, pathogens included, resulting in exposure to pathogens that have colonized or recolonized new areas. Globalization leads to unwilling movement of and exposure to pathogens. Because people and domestic animals are overdominant planetwide, there is increased selective pressure for pathogens to infect them. Nature conservation measures can slow down but not fully prevent spillovers. Addit..."
