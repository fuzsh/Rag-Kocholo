GeoArabia, Vol. 6, No. 3, 2001 Gulf PetroLink, Bahrain <strong>Late</strong> <strong>Permian</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>Holocene</strong> <strong>Pale<strong>of</strong>acies</strong> <strong>Evolution</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Arabian</strong> Plate and its Hydrocarbon Occurrences Martin A. Ziegler Consultant ABSTRACT A series <strong>of</strong> 19 pale<strong>of</strong>acies maps have been generated for given time intervals between <strong>the</strong> <strong>Late</strong> <strong>Permian</strong> and <strong>Holocene</strong> <strong>to</strong> reconstruct <strong>the</strong> depositional his<strong>to</strong>ry <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Arabian</strong> Plate. The succession <strong>of</strong> changing lithological sequences is controlled by <strong>the</strong> interplay <strong>of</strong> eustacy and sediment supply with regional and local tec<strong>to</strong>nic influences. The Mesozoic pale<strong>of</strong>acies his<strong>to</strong>ry <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> Plate is, in its central and eastern portion east <strong>of</strong> Riyadh, strongly influenced by an older N-trending, horst and graben system that reflects <strong>the</strong> grain <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> Precambrian Amar Collision and successively younger structural deformations. The late Paleozoic Hercynian orogenic event caused block faulting and relative uplift and resulted in a marked paleorelief. This jointed structural pattern dominated <strong>the</strong> entire Mesozoic and, <strong>to</strong> some extent, <strong>the</strong> Cenozoic facies distribution. The relationship between producing fields and <strong>the</strong> pale<strong>of</strong>acies maps illustrates <strong>the</strong> various petroleum systems <strong>of</strong> particular times and regions. INTRODUCTION The lithostratigraphic units <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Arabian</strong> Plate have been described in outcrop and subsurface from <strong>the</strong> Mediterranean <strong>to</strong> <strong>the</strong> Gulf <strong>of</strong> Oman and from <strong>the</strong> Red Sea <strong>to</strong> <strong>the</strong> Zagros Mountains. Serious variations in nomenclature exist regionally and between <strong>the</strong> surface and subsurface. Various authors, for example, Beydoun (1988), Alsharhan and Nairn (1997), and Christian (1997) have published regional lithostratigraphic reviews in attempts <strong>to</strong> comprehend this vast amount <strong>of</strong> stratigraphic information. Most recently, Sharland et al. (2001) published <strong>the</strong> first chronostratigraphic interpretation <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> rock units <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Arabian</strong> Plate. Most <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> previous lithostratigraphic studies have presented pale<strong>of</strong>acies, interpreted environments, and associated petroleum systems, in separate discussions. This study reconstructs pale<strong>of</strong>acies for time intervals from <strong>the</strong> <strong>Late</strong> <strong>Permian</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Holocene</strong>, each reconstruction being shown with its associated oil and gas fields. The study helps <strong>to</strong> illustrate <strong>the</strong> close relationship between lith<strong>of</strong>acies, depositional environments, and petroleum reservoirs. It also highlights active structural elements and <strong>the</strong> influence <strong>of</strong> relative sea-level changes interpreted from <strong>the</strong> pale<strong>of</strong>acies variations. This review <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Arabian</strong> Plate benefited from its association with <strong>the</strong> International Geological Correlation Program (IGCP) Project 369, ‘Comparative <strong>Evolution</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> Peri-Tethyan Rift Basins’, which in turn is affiliated <strong>to</strong> <strong>the</strong> Peri-Tethys Program. The Project’s aim was <strong>to</strong> integrate geological and geophysical data in a study <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> evolution <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> rift and wrench basins located along <strong>the</strong> nor<strong>the</strong>rn and sou<strong>the</strong>rn Tethyan margins and adjacent platforms. Paleoenvironmental maps <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> Peri-Tethyan domain from <strong>the</strong> Urals <strong>to</strong> <strong>the</strong> Atlantic Ocean and from <strong>the</strong> Baltic Shield <strong>to</strong> Equa<strong>to</strong>rial Africa were produced. The Muséum National d’His<strong>to</strong>ire Naturelle, Paris published <strong>the</strong> results as Memoir No. 6 (Ziegler et al, 2001). The results are accessible on <strong>the</strong> Internet (http://www-sst.unil/igcp_369/ default369.htm) and are also available as a CD-ROM (Stampfli et al., 2001). For ease <strong>of</strong> reference between this paper and <strong>the</strong> sequence stratigraphic study by Sharland et al. (2001) that describes <strong>the</strong> sedimentary architecture using Genetic Stratigraphic and Depositional Sequences, I have placed in square brackets equivalent dated surfaces referred <strong>to</strong> in <strong>the</strong>ir publication. These are interpreted Genetic Stratigraphic Sequences (GSS) bounded by Maximum Flooding Surfaces (MFS) identified by Period [Jurassic J10 dated at 185 Ma] and <strong>Arabian</strong> Plate (AP) Tec<strong>to</strong>nostratigraphic Megasequences [base <strong>of</strong> AP7 dated at 182 Ma]. 445
