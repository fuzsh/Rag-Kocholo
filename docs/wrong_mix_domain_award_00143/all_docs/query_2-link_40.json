        "text": "(1845–1923). Recipient of the first Nobel prize for physics in 1901, German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen is the discoverer of X rays (see X rays). His achievement heralded the age of modern physics and transformed medical practice.\n\nWilhelm Conrad Roentgen was born on March 27, 1845, in Lennep, Prussia. Educated in The Netherlands and Switzerland, Roentgen obtained his doctoral degree in physics at the University of Zürich in 1869. He conducted research and taught at the universities of Strasbourg, Giessen, Würzburg, and Munich.\n\nIn 1895 Roentgen began experiments at the University of Würzburg with an electric current flow in a partially evacuated glass tube (known as a cathode-ray tube). He noticed that, whenever the tube was in operation, a piece of barium platinocyanide in line with it gave off light. Roentgen theorized that the interaction of electrons striking the tube’s glass wall formed an unknown radiation that caused the fluorescence. He called the mysterious phenomenon X radiation, or X rays. Further experiments revealed that X radiation produces an image on photographic plates and penetrates many materials such as paper, wood, certain metals, and living tissue. For the first time physicians had a nonsurgical tool to see inside the body. The medical and scientific uses of X rays spread quickly throughout Europe and the United States.\n\nAfter receiving the Nobel prize for his work, Roentgen continued to conduct research in several fields including elasticity, fluids, and crystals. Roentgen died on February 10, 1923, in Munich, Germany."
