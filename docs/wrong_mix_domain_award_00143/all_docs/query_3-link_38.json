Today, a CRT is described as a vacuum tube that contains one or more electron guns and a phosphorescent screen, and is used to display images. It modulates, accelerates, and deflects electron beams onto a screen tocreate the images. The images may represent electrical waveforms (in an oscilloscope), pictures (a television screen, computer monitor), radar targets, or other phenomena. We now know that cathode rays are streams of electrons observed in discharge tubes. If an evacuated glass tube (upper image) is equipped with two electrodes and a voltage is applied, glass behind the positive electrode is observed to glow (lower image), due to electrons emitted from the negative cathode. The above “official” account presupposes that one knows what an electron is and what are its physical properties (mass and charge). The discovery of the electron opened up a whole new chapter in the understanding of matter. This led to the realization that light and matter could not be fully understood using the classicallaws of physics, and that a totally different way of understanding nature was needed. Thus emerged, beginning in the last years of the 19th century, a completely new description of light and matter. This new description became known as quantum mechanics, and resulted in the quantum theory of atoms, molecules and the chemical bond. This is the historical journey on which we shall embark in this Lecture. Cathode rays were discovered by Julius Plücker (1801-1868) and Johann Wilhelm Hittorf(1824-1914). Their experimental apparatus depended on two earlier inventions: 1) Volta’s battery; and, 2) a sealed glass tube in which a partial vacuum was maintained. The latter was invented by a German physicist and glassblower, Heinrich Geissler, in 1857. Hittorf observed that some unknown rays were emitted from the cathode (negative electrode) which could cast shadows on the glowing wall of the tube, indicating the rays were traveling in straight lines. In 1890, Arthur Schuster demonstrated cathode rays could be deflected by electric fields, and William Crookes showed they could be deflected by magnetic fields. It was these experiments on cathode rays inside the cathode ray tube that drew the attention of Röntgen. After repeating the above experiments, he began to study the radiation emitted outside the cathode ray tube, using fluorescent chemical sensors, e.g., barium platinocyanide, to detect radiation. His discovery of x-rays on November 8, 1895 was communicated to the Physico-Medical Society of Würzburg later in November, 1895. A translation of his paper appeared two months later on January 23, 1896 in the English journal, Nature. (You can dial up this article on Gallica and read it for yourself).

Speaker: Roy Millard The SWWE Regional Network were very pleased to welcome back to Bristol Roy Millard, of APM’s Assurance Interest Group on 9 July 2024, to talk about project reviews and hopefully answer all your questions. Roy outlined his extensive career and his experience in setting up the APM’s Assurance Specific Interest Group, as they were known then. Using Mentimeter, he asked a number of questions of the audience about their experience of project reviews and what they wanted to know. Roy discussed what a project review was and examined a number of definitions, including APM’s Bok: “Project reviews take place throughout the project life cycle to check the likely or actual achievement of the objectives specified in the project management plan” Why do we do project reviews? Different stakeholders will have different views about this, but usually it is about providing confidence that the project will deliver the expected outputs and benefits, that it is under control. There are many types of project reviews, including peer reviews, internal audit, National Audit Office, IPA, etc. Roy discussed the principles behind the Three Lines of Defence Model:, First line looks at management controls, policies, procedures, Second line at compliance, such as Gate reviews, QA, to check that controls are being followed, and third Line is independent external reviews for the organisations Board, such as Internal Audit or NAO audit. Factors which affect project reviews include the scope, level of independence, customer of the review, team composition and time. Project Audits are a special type of project review. They are generally more independent, formal with clear processes and audit trails, with a greater emphasis on compliance. Project reviews are generally more flexible and informal, but should be evidence based and have some level of independence. Roy looked at 2 examples of where reviews went wrong, London Underground Sub-Surface Upgrade signalling contract, and London’s Garden Bridge. The former had poor 3 lines of defence, no internal audit and weak procurement skills, the latter was a Boris Johnson vanity project with no proper governance due to Johnson’s pressure and interference. Roy discussed the principles of assurance reviews from APM’s Guide to Integrated Assurance (Free to Members), which include: independence, accountability, risk based, and impact, etc Human factors are important in project reviews. The skills and knowledge of the review team, building trust with the project team to avoid defensiveness, body language, and team dynamics, which can only be assessed face to face, active listening, flexibility and objectively.
