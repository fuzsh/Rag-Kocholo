Our university has strong roots in Würzburg and the region of Main Franconia, and our research and teaching activities have led to achievements of global significance.\n\nWe are committed to continuing excellence in research and teaching across all branches of science. Established for the first time in 1402, the University of Würzburg now offers more than 100 subjects in the humanities, social and natural sciences, life sciences, medicine and selected areas of engineering. We prepare our students for careers in a wide range of fields and we aim to closely coordinate our teaching with our current research activities. Our students work with renowned scientists from all over the world and, with the completion of their Bachelor’s, Master’s or doctoral degrees, make their own contributions to science.\n\nThe university is committed to strengthening interdisciplinary cooperation and investigating emerging disciplines at the interface between different branches of science. Working towards sustainable development across all subjects, JMU has initiated ongoing quality improvement processes. JMU’s main objective is to gain insights into all scientific disciplines and to share these insights with students, research professionals, and the general public."
