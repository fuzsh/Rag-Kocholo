        "text": "We at thyssenkrupp would also be pretty upset without these great thought leaders –especially when it comes to physics and chemistry. Every day, our engineers use the achievements of numerous Nobel Prize winners as the basis for the development and production of our innovations.\n\nQuality control: No giant excavator can last long without Ruska and Röntgen\n\nPerhaps you’ve already seen pictures of gigantic chain excavators used in large mining areas to transport hundreds of tons of excavated earth. Or have you visited a construction site with all kinds of excavators? In order for the operators to be able to use the wear-intensive work of the construction machines for as long as possible, the robustness and high fracture strength of every component are crucial. Every piece must meet the highest quality requirements. As one of the world’s largest manufacturers of undercarriage components for chain-driven earthmoving machines, our forging specialists in Northern Italy manufacture these components. In order to guarantee that our products will withstand all operational challenges for many years to come, our specialists research the fracture-mechanics of the undercarriage systems and test in ultra-modern laboratories whether the material used has the necessary quality.\n\nThe fact that we have these possibilities is also cause of two Nobel Prize winners: In 1986, the German electrical engineer Ernst Ruska received the award for a great technology that he invented more than five decades ago. He developed the electron microscope – a powerful analytical tool with which we can detect even the tiniest impurities thanks to magnification of up to 500,000 times. 85 years earlier, the Nobel Foundation honored Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen: With his discovery of X-rays, he not only revolutionized the diagnosis of bone fractures but also allowed us to precisely analyze the chemical composition of our metal alloys today. Thank you Ernst, thank you Conrad!\n\nHoloLinc: From Gábor’s Holography Theory to the digital lift service of tomorrow\n\nThe hearts of many Nobel thinkers also beat in our digital innovations. This is best illustrated by HoloLinc, one of our latest developments. The technology makes it possible to visualize stair lifts before one’s eyes with the help of Microsoft’s Augmented Reality glasses HoloLens – even before they are produced. And when it comes to elevator maintenance, our service technicians can use HoloLens to visualize the characteristics of an elevator even before their service appointment, and thus complete their work up to four times faster.\n\nIt’s because of Dennis Gabór’s historical achievement that we are able to see an object made of light in our surroundings. In 1947, the engineer discovered the principle of holography. In 1971, the English citizen with a Hungarian-German past received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.\n\nCarbon2Chem: Turning CO2 into something valuable – thanks to Ostwald’s catalysis findings\n\nSustainability and climate protection are important to us. So it’s good that the chemical elements in the industrial exhaust gases of our steelworks, such as nitrogen or hydrogen, can be processed into synthesis gases using the right process. They form the basis for chemicals such as ammonia, methanol, polymers or higher alcohols. CO2 is also a component of our metallurgical gases.\n\nTransforming both CO2 and the other substances into something valuable is precisely what our Carbon2Chem project is all about. At our Duisburg pilot plant, we produce sustainable methanol from metallurgical gases – a green world premiere. And there are hardly any other theorems in chemistry that is as important for Carbon2Chem as the following two:"
