        "text": "X-rays (or much more rarely, and usually historically, x-radiation or Roentgen rays) represent a form of ionizing electromagnetic radiation. They are produced by an x-ray tube, using a high voltage to accelerate the electrons produced by its cathode. The produced electrons interact with the anode, thus producing x-rays. The x-rays produced include Bremsstrahlung and the characteristic radiation for the anode element.\n\nX-rays can interact with matter by the following:\n\nphotoelectric effect\n\nCompton effect\n\nRayleigh or classical scattering\n\nionization\n\npair production (not possible in the diagnostic radiology range)\n\nTerminology\n\nThe term x-ray as well as referring to a form of electromagnetic radiation per se, is also used to refer to the image generated, for example a chest x-ray. Although many radiologists will insist that radiograph is the correct term for this, especially in a more formal setting . X-ray is also used as a transitive verb, e.g. we x-rayed the man's chest 4.\n\nHistory and etymology"
