        "text": "Creativity\n\nWhat is creativity and how can creative activity best be encouraged?\n\nWhich is more important to the creative process: the individual or the environment?\n\nThe Centennial Exhibition examines these questions by presenting selected Laureates and milieus from the 100-year history of the Nobel Prize. The Exhibition does not provide specific answers, but gives visitors the chance to think about these questions for themselves.\n\nIndividuals and Milieus\n\nCourage to think on entirely new lines, daring to question established theories, innovative combinations of insights from the different fields â these are some of the characteristics of creativity.\n\nThese characteristics may be illustrated by physicist Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen’s research, the work of Peace Prize Laureate Martin Luther King, and the literary works of Selma LagerlÃ¶f â all presented at the Exhibition.\n\nIn creative environments there are often informal meeting places for spontaneous, unplanned discussions. These were the Paris cafÃ©s of the 1920s, where Nobel Laureates such as Hemingway and Beckett worked, and today the cafeterias in CERN or in Cambridge, with all its colleges.\n\nThere are presentations of more than thirty Laureates and their creative work, as well as a number of milieus that inspired creativity, in the film room and artifact theater. The Exhibition also gives an account of the Nobel Prizes of the 20th Century. Well-known Nobel Prizes are discussed against a background of historic events. Nobel Prizes that were controversial at the time are also discussed, such as the Peace Prize awarded to German journalist Carl von Ossietzky in 1935."
