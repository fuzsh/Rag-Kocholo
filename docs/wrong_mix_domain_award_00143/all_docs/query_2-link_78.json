        "text": "Image courtesy: Johnson & Johnson Archives\n\nThe accidental discovery of the X-ray won German scientist Wilhelm Roentgen the world’s first Nobel Prize in physics. The X-ray machine was built within weeks of Roentgen’s announcement. It allowed doctors and scientists to see inside the body for the first time, without putting patients under the knife. Roentgen’s invention was particularly helpful in times of war to help surgeons locate bullets and broken bones."
