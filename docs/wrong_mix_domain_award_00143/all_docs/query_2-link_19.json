        "text": "German physicist Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen, working with a cathode ray tube in his laboratory, in 1895, discovers \"a new kind of ray that can travel great distances, penetrate solid matter, activate fluorescent screens, and expose photographic plates.\" He receives the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his work in discovering the X-ray.\n\nWorking independently, during the 1940s, Swiss-born physicist Felix Block at Stanford University and American physicist Edward Purcell at Harvard University find that atomic nuclei placed in a magnetic field absorb energy in the range of the spectrum. The nuclei re-emit this energy when they are transferred to their original state. Block and Purcell share the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.\n\nWhen applied to human subjects, the term (NMR) technology becomes known as \"magnetic resonance imaging.\"\n\nDuring the 1970s, American chemist Paul Lauterbur and British physicist Peter Mansfield made pioneering contributions which led to the application of magnetic resonance in medical imaging. They share the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\nThe term \"nuclear magnetic resonance\" (NMR) was dropped because it was feared that people would associate it with atomic radiation. The technique was renamed \"magnetic resonance imaging.\""
