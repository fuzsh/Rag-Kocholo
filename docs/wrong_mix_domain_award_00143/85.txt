Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen was a full professor of physics at the University of Giessen from 1879 to 1888. Later he taught as a professor at the universities in Würzburg and Munich. He was the first to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for the discovery of x-rays at the Physics Institute of the University of Würzburg on November 8, 1895. Although he himself named them 'x-rays', in German, his discovery is named Röntgenstrahlen after him.

During his time in Giessen, Röntgen brought about the relocation of the Institute of Physics from Frankfurter Strasse to the new main university building. He published about twenty scientific papers during this time, including works on the ‘x-ray tone’, in which he showed that gases absorb heat rays, and works on the detection of the magnetic field produced by a displacement current (‘x-ray current’).

Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen felt especially connected to the city of Giessen. At his own request, he was buried in the old cemetery in Giessen, where his gravestone can still be found today.

In memory of Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, full professor at the University of Giessen from 1879 to 1888, Justus Liebig University of Giessen has been awarding the Röntgen Prize since 1960.

This internationally renowned prize is made possible by the commitment and support of two donor companies:

Pfeiffer Vacuum GmbH, Asslar und Ludwig Schunk Foundation e.V., Giessen, which provide the prize money of 15,000 Euros.

The deadline for proposals and applications, which should be addressed to the chairman of the expert committee, is April 30 of each year. Please send proposals here:
