FHI Director Prof. Dr Beatriz Roldán Cuenya received the Röntgen Medal 2022 in recognition of her research on catalysis, especially electrocatalysis, and the associated possibilities for the use of new sustainable energy sources of the future. The prize was awarded on 10 September by Remscheid's Lord Mayor Burkhard Mast-Weisz in the Klosterkirche in Remscheid-Lennep.

The Röntgen plaque is awarded annually in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the award of the first Nobel Prize to Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen. The Röntgen plaque is traditionally presented by the Lord Mayor of Remscheid to personalities who have rendered outstanding services to the progress and dissemination of Röntgen's discoveries. The plaque has become a prestigious scientific award in professional circles. The Society of Friends and Sponsors of the German Röntgen Museum Remscheid-Lennep e.V. selects suitable scientists from all over the world and proposes them to the Lord Mayor for honour.
