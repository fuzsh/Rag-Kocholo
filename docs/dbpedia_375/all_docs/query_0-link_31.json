        "text": "Yao Su Rong (姚蘇蓉)\n\nYao Su Rong (“姚蘇蓉“) is a Taiwanese singer and actress born on this day, 5 December, in 1946. Today she’s still best-known for her 1969 hit recording of “今天不回家” (“Today I Won’t Come Home”), the title track of a film of the same name. Her career was cut short at its peak by Kuomintang (KMT) authorities who revoked her license to entertain. Soon after she left to enjoy success in Hong Kong, and then Singapore (where she lives today).\n\nUnder the Japanese occupation of Taiwan (1895-1945), enka or, more broadly, ryūkōka was introduced to Tawain and with it, strains of western music like mambo, jazz, and country — albeit filtered through a Japanese sensibility. Many Taiwanese singers found pursued careers as enka singers in Japan. After the defeat of Japan in 1945, Taiwan became part of the Republic of China (ROC) — then engaged in a civil war with the Communist Party of China. After the defeat of the ROC, the KMT retreated to the island in 1949 and established a brutal, US-backed dictatorship. Under KMT rule, native Taiwanese culture was suppressed and Mandarin was promoted as the official language.\n\nIt took time for Mandarin-language pop to find favor with a mainstream Taiwanese. Along with artists like 謝雷 (Xie Lei) and his band, Lucky Trio, Yao began making inroads with music which drew upon enka, shidaiqu, and newer western sounds like beat and soul. Yao’s first records were released by Large World Records, a local Taiwanese label that primarily catered to American and Australian soldiers serving at military bases in Taiwan. Before Yao recorded for the label, they primarily released music by American and British artists like The Beatles, Skeeter Davis, The Supremes, and The Seeds (amongst others).\n\nIn 1967, Yao moved to Haishan Records. Like Large World, their early releases had been Taiwanese pressings of western releases, in the case of Haishan, releases by the likes of Dusty Springfield, Eddy Arnold, and Hank Williams (among others). By the second half of the 1960s, Haishan had begun releasing music by Hong Konger’s like 華怡保 (Ruby Wah) and 仙杜拉 (Sandra Lang), as well as Taiwanese acts like 于旋 (Yu Xuan) and The Phenix Sisters.\n\nYao’s first record at Haishan was composed by 李潔心 (Li Jie Xin), arranged by 林家慶 (Lin Jia Qing), but her collaborators over the next few years would be many — a fact which no doubt accounts for the stylistic variety of her large body of work. Some songs have cinematic, quasi-western strings and brass, others lean towards organ-driven rhythm & blues. All of it has the same sort of melodic, psychedelic funkiness that characterizes so much East Asian pop from that era — regardless of whether from Singapore, Korea, Japan, or elsewhere.\n\nYao sang in a clear, passionate voice that — along with her penchant for her misty-eyed performances — earned her the nickname, “the Queen of Tears.” One of her hits was a Mandarin-language cover of the Japanese song, “負心的人” (“Cruel-Hearted Lover”). Not everyone was a fan, however, and the nation’s long-misruling dictator, Chiang Kai-shek, did not approve of weeping popstars or the danger of sentimental ballads inflaming the passion of his subjects. More than 80 of Yao’s songs were thus banned.\n\nIn 1968, she released the first of two albums backed by Li Sheng Yang‘s band, The Telstar Combo. In 1969, she released the first of several collaborations with the aforementioned Taiwanese singer, 謝雷 (Xie Lei). On 18 August 1969, Yao performed for an audience in Kaohsiung. They cried out for requests, in particular, “今天不回家.” Yao initially apologized and refused, as the song was amongst those banned by the authorities. Eventually, however, she gave in. Authorities at the performance were not amused. Yao refused to provide a playlist or issue an apology and so her license to perform was revoked. Afterward, she moved to Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1970, Yao began recording for a Hong Kong label, 樂風. There, and that year, she released her first of several collaborations with various others, including 陳寶玲 (Chen Bao Ling), 與 蒋光超 (Jiang Guang Chao), 藍夢 (Lan Meng), 趙曉君 (Lily Chao), 青山 (Qing Shan), 奚秀蘭 (Stella Chee), 魏平澳 (Wei Ping Ao), 楊燕 (Yang Yan), and 張帝 (Zhang Di). Sorting out her discography is rather difficult due to its size, the multitude of re-releases, and my extremely remedial grasp of Chinese. I have, nevertheless, attempted to compile a fairly inclusive discography here of studio albums (although some are no doubt compilations and at least one, although attributed to Yao, features a handful of tracks sung by multiple artists).\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\n\n1966 – Oh Summer Wine 夢裡情侶 / 阿哥哥( 第二集 ) (Large World)\n\n1966 – A Go Go 阿哥哥 ‎(Large World)\n\nYao Su Yong’s Highlight / A Go Go (Haishan Records)\n\n1967 – 負心的人 (Haishan Records)\n\n1968 – 偷心的人 / Yao Su Yong’s & The Telstar Combo (Haishan Records)\n\n1968 – 臨別的一笑 + 關達拉美娜 (Haishan Records)\n\n1968 – 聽我細訴 ‎(Haishan Records)\n\n1969 – 今天不回家 / Yao Su Yong’s & The Telstar Combo (Haishan Records)\n\n1969 – 跟你一起走 ‎(孔雀唱片)\n\n1969 – [with 謝雷 (Xie Lei)] 安平回想曲 ‎(Haishan Records)\n\n1969 – 紫丁香 ‎(Haishan Records)\n\n1970 – 歌曲精選 (樂風)\n\n1970 – [with 謝雷 (Xie Lei)] 恨你入骨 (樂風)\n\n1970 – [with 與 蒋光超 (Jiang Guang Chao)] 鳳還巢 (樂風)\n\n1970 – [with 與 蒋光超 (Jiang Guang Chao)] 小翠 / 雲翠仙 (Haishan Records)\n\n1970 – 姚蘇蓉之歌 / 瘋靡港台星馬登台精選歌集 (Cartoon Record)\n\n1970 – 電影明星”姚蘇蓉”歌曲精選 / Movie-Star “Yao Su Yong” Sings (樂風)\n\n1970 – 夢的世界 (樂風)\n\n1970 – 金唱片歌集 (樂風)\n\n1970 – 夢的祈禱 (Haishan Records)\n\n1970 – 像霧又像花 (樂風)\n\n1970 – 家在台北 (Haishan Records)\n\n1970 – 七部最新電影插曲精選 (樂風)\n\n1970 – [with 謝雷 (Xie Lei)] 不要拋棄我!

Most of her work after that was released on Singaporean labels (including a collaboration with the great Singaporean band, The Stylers, who often backed the great Lisa Wong (麗莎) and Lena Lim (林竹君)).\n\nHis Excellency Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, ushering in a period of democratic reform which culminated in the 1987 end of the White Terror — the then- longest period of martial law in world history (since surpassed by Syria). Today, Taiwan is easily among the most progressive and nations in Asia. Although Yao’s last album seems to have been released in 1978, she was still regularly performing live as late as 1980 — albeit never in Taiwan. In 1996, 今天不回家 was remade by Taiwanese director, Sylvia Chang. Yao’s recording of the title song was again featured. In 1998, the organizers of the Golden Horse Film Festival invited Yao to return to the island to perform. Yao declined. In 2007, the Jay Chou (周杰倫) film, 不能說的·秘密 (Secret), used another vintage Yao song, “情人的眼泪” (Lovers’ Tears). Apparently, Yao only became aware of this when informed by a relative in Chengdu whom she was visiting at the time of the film’s release.\n\nWherever you are, 姚蘇蓉, here’s wishing you a happy birthday!\n\nEric Brightwell is an adventurer, essayist, rambler, explorer, cartographer, and guerrilla gardener who is always seeking paid writing, speaking, traveling, and art opportunities.

I think I really got into them when I was fourteen. Around that time I developed a love for pretty much any rock band with lots of keyboards (see also ? & the Mysterians and The Zombies). It was also when I was fourteen that I developed a crush on an older woman (well, a fifteen-year-old Doors fan). We shared a set of headphones from her Walkman and listened to the debut on the playground. When we visited Paris, she invited me to go to Père Lachaise to see Jim Morrison‘s grave but I turned her down. Probably out of shyness. Ten years later, I was living and Los Angeles. I used to routinely spend my work breaks with a motley assortment of stoners. The Doors were the only thing all of us could enjoy getting high too. For the record, I was also alright with the cholos’ preferences for Santana and Zapp & Roger but the Texas Jews wanted to listen to Phish and the like and that stuff is a musically-induced panic attack just waiting to happen.\n\nOf course, I also have a thing for maps and because today is Day of the Doors in Los Angeles, I had the notion yesterday of making a Doors map of Los Angeles. It took a bit longer than I thought. Any additions or corrections are appreciated. Just leave a comment! I rushed a bit at the end because I need to head down to Morrison Hotel.\n\nThe Doors released eight studio albums during their eight-year existence. The roots of the Doors was a frat rock band called Rick & the Ravens, which had been around since 1961 and released three singles on Aura Records in 1965. The original line-up included Rick Manczarek (guitar), Jim Manczarek (organ and harmonica), Patrick Stonier (saxophone), Roland Biscaluz (bass), and Vince Thomas (drums). The Manczareks’ brother Ray Manczarek joined the line-up in 1962, provided a bit of piano and vocals — and dropping the “c” from the family name.\n\nIn July 1965, Ray and Jim Morrison ran into one another on Venice Beach. Morrison sang one of his compositions, “Moonlight Drive.” Manzarek was impressed and at a live performance with his band coaxed Morrison onstage at the Turkey Joint West (now Ye Olde King’s Head) for a cover of the garage rock staple, “Louie, Louie.”\n\nRick & the Ravens’ line-up underwent several changes. By September 1965, it included Jim, Ray, and Rick Manczarek; Morrison; Patricia Hansen (of Patty and the Esquires, bass), and John Densmore (drums). Densmore previously played in a band called the Psychedelic Rangers with Robby Krieger. After meeting Ray at a Transcendental Meditation lecture, he’d joined Rick & the Ravens in August 1965. On 2, this line-up of Rick & the Ravens entered World Pacific Studios and recorded demos of “Moonlight Drive“, “My Eyes Have Seen You“, “Hello, I Love You“, “Go Insane,” “End of the Night,” and “Summer’s Almost Gone.”\n\nDisappointed in the lack of interest as well as the songs themselves, Rick and Jim quit the band. Morrison suggested changing their name to The Doors — taken from The Doors of Perception by English-Angeleno writer Aldous Huxley — who had himself taken the name from a line of William Blake‘s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. In October, they were joined by Robby Krieger. In December, Patty left and Ray added Fender Rhodes Piano Bass to his duties. From February to May 1966, the Doors had a residency (with “Rhonda Lane Exotic Dancer“) at the London Fog. It was there that Jim met his “cosmic mate,” Pamela Courson, an art student at Los Angeles City College.\n\nIn May, the Doors took up residency at the Whiskey-A-Go-Go. On the advice of Love‘s Arthur Lee, Elektra Records president Jac Holzman caught a performance on 10 August 1966. After catching a second performance with producer Paul A. Rothchild, the Doors were signed them to Elektra on 18 August. The Doors were fired from the Whiskey-A-Go-Go on 21 August after performing the Oedipal “The End.”\n\nFrom 24 to 31 August 1966, the Doors recorded at Sunset Sound Recording Studios. They released their debut single, “Break On Through (To the Other Side)” b/w “End of the Night.” Although a radio staple now, it then only reached number 126 on the Billboard charts (although it placed higher in France, New Zealand, and the UK). The second single, also released in January of 1967, was the Robby Krieger composition “Light My Fire” b/w “The Crystal Ship.” It reached the top spot in the US (and France). Both were included on the self-titled debut, which was released on 4 January 1967 — the day that was proclaimed Day of the Doors fifty years later.\n\nFrom May to August 1967, the band returned to Sunset Sound Recording Studios to record their second album, Strange Days. It followed, for the most part, the template established by the debut of an album’s worth of fairly short compositions followed by a longer, epic, this time “When the Music’s Over.” The title track was one of the first rock songs to incorporate the Moog synthesizer. The debut single, “People Are Strange” b/w “Unhappy Girl” was written by Morrison during a bout of depression following a walk in Laurel Canyon and only reached No. 12. The follow-up, another Krieger composition was “Love Me Two Times” b/w “Moonlight Drive,” which peaked at No. 25.\n\nThe Doors recorded most of their third album, Waiting for the Sun, in from January-May 1968 (“We Could Be So Good Together” had been recorded from May to August 1967). There were apparently tensions around the recording. The album’s epic, the 17-minute “Celebration of the Lizard King,” was rejected by producer Paul Rothchild. Morrison’s increasingly heavy drinking took a toll on his creativity whilst, at the same time, the band had by then exhausted their early repertoire of original songs. The first single, “Unknown Soldier” b/w “We Could Be So Good Together,” peaked at number 39. Nevertheless, its follow-up, “Hello, I Love You” b/w “Love Street” was their second US number one and the album was their only one to top the charts.\n\nThe Doors performed at the Hollywood Bowl on 5 July 1968. Footage was included in the Doors’ film, A Feast of Friends, released in 1970.\n\nLater in 1968, the band re-entered the studio to work on The Soft Parade, on which the music revealed the band moving further away from their acid rock beginnings into jazz-inflected sunshine pop. The first single, released in December 1968, was Krieger’s “Touch Me” b/w “Wild Child.” It reached number three on the US charts. The Soft Parade was released 18 July 1969. It was followed by three more Krieger compositions, “Wishful, Sinful” b/w “Who Scared You,” “Tell All the People” b/w “Easy Ride,” and “Runnin’ Blue” b/w “Do It.” Morrison was less involved in the songwriting process than on previous albums, dealing as he was with legal issues, personal problems, as well as his poetry. That year he published two works of the latter, The Lords / Notes on Vision and The New Creatures. Morrison also acted in a 52-minute experimental film, HWY: An American Pastoral, filmed in the Mojave Desert and Los Angeles. It was also in 1969 that Morrison bought a fashion boutique, Themis, for his girlfriend Pamela Courson.\n\nThe Doors recorded most of Morrison Hotel from November 1969-January 1970 (“Indian Summer” had been recorded in August 1966). The orchestral arrangments and studio soloists of The Soft Parade were, for the most part, eschewed in favor of a stripped-down blues rock sound. Morrison, for his part, attempted to distance himself from his earlier Lizard King image, putting on weight, growing a beard, and retiring his leathers. He also contributed more to the songwriting process, writing or co-writing all of the songs. “You Make Me Real” b/w “Roadhouse Blues” peaked at number 50 on the US charts, although “Roadhouse Blues” would over time become an FM radio staple.\n\nA live album, Absolutely Live, and a Christmas cash-in compilation, 13, were followed by the final studio album with Morrison, L.A. Woman. The band recorded the album at The Doors’ Workshop from December 1970-January 1971. It was recorded without Rothchild after he fell out with the group after asserting that one or more of the new songs sounded like “cocktail music.” It was subsequently co-produced by the band and longtime sound engineer Bruce Botnick. The first single, “Love Her Madly” b/w “(You Need Meat) Don’t Go No Further” (the B-side was the first to feature Manzarek on vocals). “Riders on the Storm” b/w “Changeling” was released in June 1971.\n\nOn 3 July 1971, Morrison died in Paris at the age of 27. No autopsy was performed but the cause of death was listed as heart failure. His body was discovered by his girlfriend, Pamela Courson. Morrison was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n\nThe other Doors had begun work on a new album, which would be released as Other Voices, that June. They had hoped that Morrison would return from Paris to finish the album with them. After his unexpected death, the surviving members finished it as a trio. “Tightrope Ride” b/w “Variety is the Spice of Life” reached 71. Its follow-up, “Ships With Sails” b/w “In the Eye of the Sun” did not chart. The album, for its part, reached 31.\n\nThe surviving members of the Doors convened once again in the spring of 1972 to record Full Circle. Botnick departed from the Doors’ circle and was replaced by Henry Lewy. Full Circle was released on 15 August 1972 and peaked at number 68. Three singles were released: “The Mosquito” b/w “It Slipped My Mind,” “Get Up and Dance” b/w “Treetrunk,” and “The Piano Bird” b/w “Good Rockin’.” Not long after, Ray Manzarek let Densmore and Krieger know that he wasn’t interested in continuing the Doors and the band called it a day.\n\nJim Morrison’s partner, Pamela Courson, died of a heroin overdose on 25 April 1974 at the age of 27. She was living at the time in a Hancock Park apartment building with two roommates. Her cremated remains were interred at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana.\n\nIn 1978, five years since their break-up and seven years since Morrison’s death, the surviving Doors re-convened to record music for An American Prayer. The spoken word vocals had been recorded by Jim Morrison in March 1969 and December 1970. The album was released on 17 November 1978. Prior to leaving for Paris, Morrison had reached out to Lalo Schifrin with the possibility of collaborating on the music. Rothchild denounced the album as “a rape of Jim Morrison.” It sold over a million copies. A year later, “The End” was prominently featured in Francis Ford Coppola‘s film, Apocalypse Now, introducing the Doors to the post-punk generation.\n\nRay Manzarek died in Rosenheim, Germany on 20 May 2013. He was 74 years old. John Densmore and Robby Kreiger are both alive and well and living in Los Angeles.

For the latter, I’ve most often used Google‘s My Maps program for several reasons. It’s relatively easy, looks relatively good, has pretty good functionality (e.g. links to websites and decent customization) and because Alphabet Inc. (Google’s parent company) is the fourth-largest company in the world — which leads me to believe, whether rightly or wrongly, that using their maps will positively affect my web traffic allowing more readers to hopefully enjoy my work. In the future, however, I may experiment with OpenStreetMap and GIS, both of which I learned of through MaptimeLA.\n\nGoogle’s My Maps isn’t perfect, by any means. Their base maps include businesses I have no interest in (e.g. smog checks, locations of Jersey Mike’s Subs, &c), neighborhood names created by developers, and other features the digital cartographer isn’t allowed to remove. If a user clicks the transit option, the user sees only train lines, not bus routes — plus the price and availability of for-profit e-scooter and rid- hail options. There are rarely if ever street view options for walk streets, stair streets, trails, parks, or public stairways — or anywhere else the Google van can’t drive — because there’s no profit motive in mapping those amenities. Google is a for-profit company, though — part of a massive multinational corporation — and thus its primary purpose is not to enable users to make maps that enrich users’ lives but rather to make money through data-mining and advertising in order to enrich the board and shareholders of its corporate overlords. If one would prefer a non-profit, user-generated alternative, I recommend Mapillary (which I’ve contributed to with 360 cameras and my smartphone).\n\nAnother flaw, as I see it, with Google’s My Maps is that there’s no nice way to see them all on in one place. The user must log into My Maps, choose viewing and sorting options, and then scroll and wait for them to upload. When one has made as many maps as I have, trying to find a particular map is tedious and time-consuming — and so, I decided to put them all in one place — here, on my website.\n\nI also am asked, sometimes, to make prints of my “map” available for sale. These requests almost never elucidate which of my more than 300 maps that I’ve made so far the requester is referring to. Almost all of the painted and drawn ones are available on all sorts of merchandise. Many are available as art prints — including some adapted from the digital versions (minus the smog checks and locations of Jersey Mike’s Subs). Check the link at the end of this piece and if you can’t find a map that you’re looking for, let me know in the comments and I’ll get back to you. And if you have any mapping requests, also let me know in the comments.\n\nAFGHAN LOS ANGELES\n\nA map of institutions operated by, catering to, or otherwise relevant to Angelenos of Afghan ethnicity or ancestry. The South Asian country of Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic society and Afghan ethnicities include Arab, Aymāq, Baloch, Brahui, Gujjar, Hazara, Nuristani, Pamiri, Pashai, Pashtun, Tajik, Turkmen, Uzbek, and others. However, the term “Afghan” is often used synonymously with Pashtuns of the region. This map originally appeared in “No Enclave — Exploring Afghan Los Angeles.”\n\nAFRICAN RESTAURANTS OF LOS ANGELES\n\nLos Angeles is or has been, home to a number of African Restaurants and markets. They’ve represented a number of Africa’s more than 3,000 ethnic groups and 55 or so countries. Represented cuisines include those of Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, and Tunisia. The map appeared on a piece, African Restaurants of Los Angeles.\n\nANAHEIM\n\nAnaheim is the most populous city in Orange County — which is surprising to me after having visited it because it feels far less developed than its truly urban (but smaller) neighbor, the city of Santa Ana. In fact, to me, it feels less urban than Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, or Orange and more like a Garden Grove or Irvine — which is the only city with more area than Anaheim in the county. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — Exploring Anaheim.\n\nANGELES FOREST (REGION)\n\nA map of Los Angeles County‘s Angeles Forst region — the borders of which do not correspond with the entire Angeles National Forest — a forest located in the San Gabriel Mountains and Sierra Pelona Mountains which stretches across Los Angeles County from Santa Barbara County to San Bernardino County. The Angeles Forest region is, along with the Channel Islands, one of Los Angeles’s least-populated — both are home to fewer than 5,000 human residents. The map was made for California Fool’s Gold — An Angeles Forest Primer.\n\nANTELOPE VALLEY\n\nThere are several valleys in the western United States known as “Antelope Valley” — even though not one of them is home to any antelopes which are an animal native to Africa and Eurasia. In Los Angeles County, Antelope Valley refers to a region situated between the Tehachapi and the San Gabriel Mountains — the latter of which separates the valley from the Los Angeles Basin. Although mostly sparsely populated, the Antelope Valley contains within it the fifth and sixth most populous cities in Los Angeles County: Lancaster and Palmdale. This map appeared in California Fool’s Gold — An Antelope Valley Primer.\n\nARGENTINE LOS ANGELES\n\nAlthough not amongst Los Angeles’s largest Latino populations, only New York City is home to a larger Argentine-American community. Their presence is evinced by numerous Argentine restaurants, tango academies, as well as several high-profiled actors and athletes. This map appeared in No Enclave — Exploring Argentine Los Angeles.\n\nASIA\n\nCovering an area of 44,579,000 square kilometers and home to 4.4 billion people, Asia is both the Earth’s largest and most populous continent. It is, not surprisingly, highly diverse and this map is a map in progress of both widely recognized countries and almost completely unrecognized ones.\n\nASIAN BARS OF LOS ANGELES\n\nAsia has produced many types of alcohol, including sake, soju, cheongju, choujiu, gouqi jiu, goryangju, huangjiu, kumis, makgeolli, meijiu, shōchū, and umsehu. It has also produced many types of drinking establishments such as booking clubs, hostess bars, izakayas, and themed pijiu wus. Asia and the South Pacific inspired the region’s kitschy tiki bars and Orientalist fantasy bars. Asian American entrepreneurs, too, have opened lounges, nightclubs, and taverns that cater primarily to Asian Americans. This map appeared in Swinging Doors –Asian Bars of Los Angeles.\n\nASIAN GARDENS OF LOS ANGELES\n\nThere are, no doubt, numerous formalized gardening styles that have developed in a continent as old, large, populous, and diverse as Asia. Within Los Angeles, there are numerous examples, mostly from the East Asian traditions of China, Japan, and Korea. This map appeared in Southland Parks — A Directory of Asian Gardens in Los Angeles.\n\nASIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nYou’d never know it from Hollywood films, media websites, or even most local writers, but Metro Los Angeles is the world’s great pan-Asian Metropolis. Asians comprise the most populous and fastest-growing racial minority in Los Angeles. Asian enclaves include Cambodia Town, Chinatown, Filipinotown, Koreatown, Little Bangladesh, Little Osaka, Little Saigon, Little Tokyo, and Thai Town. Los Angeles is home to the largest communities of Cambodian, Filipino, Korean, Taiwanese, Thai, and Vietnamese populations outside of their respective home countries. It is home to the nation’s largest communities of Indonesians, Japanese, and others.\n\nASIAN MALLS OF LOS ANGELES\n\nWith so many Asians in Los Angeles, there are naturally loads of shopping centers, strip malls, and shopping malls which cater primarily to Asian Americans. Far from soulless collections of the usual commercial suspects surrounded by vast seas of parking lot, they are often home to some of the best restaurants, multiplexes screening films you’re unlikely to see anywhere else, and chains unfamiliar to most. This map appears in Mini-Mallism — Los Angeles’s Asian Malls.\n\nASIAN STATUARY IN LOS ANGELES\n\nIn May 2016, I blogged every day about some aspect of Asian American culture for that year’s Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. I tried to cover all of the statues designed or sculpted by Asian or Asian American sculptors — or those honoring Asian and Asian American figures. I imagine I missed quite a few so consider it a work in progress. This map appears in Pan-Asian Metropolis — Asian Statuary in Los Angeles.\n\nASIAN SUPERMARKETS OF LOS ANGELES\n\nLos Angeles boasts Bangladeshi, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Hong Konger, Indian, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Sri Lankan, Taiwanese, Thai, and Vietnamese markets (both mini and super). Found within them are all sorts of products you won’t find at mainstream markets: banana ketchup, banchan, Buddha’s hand, bitter melon, burdock, calamondin, chayote, chili oil, corchorus, culantro, curry paste, fish mint, daikon,durian, fifty pound bags of rice, furikake,gai lan, Golden Mountain sauce, holy basil, kaffir lime, kanpyō, konjac, lemon basil, longan, lychee, makgeolli, mung bean, Okinawan sweet potato, pandan leaves, perilla, pineapple guava, piper lolot, purple mangosteen, grass jelly, luffa, 800 ml bottles of Maggi, Mang Tomas, nattō, plum wine, rambutan, rice paddy herb, sea vegetables, shiso, Sichuan pepper, soju, sprouted peanuts, any brand of sriracha other than Huy Fong, stinky tofu,taro, Thai basil, tofu skin, tsukemono, ube, vegetarian “fish” sauce, Vietnamese balm, Vietnamese coriander, water dropwort, water spinach, winged bean, yādom (ยาดม), and true yams… to name a few. This map appears in Pan-Asian Metropolis — Los Angeles’s Asian Supermarkets.\n\nASIAN-AMERICAN MURALS IN LOS ANGELES\n\nLos Angeles is widely recognized for its mural culture. As part of my 2016 effort to blog every day about a different aspect of Asian Angeleno culture for that year’s Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, I wrote this piece, Pan-Asian Metropolis — Asian-American Murals in Los Angeles. It should be obvious that it’s nowhere near exhaustive, as I notice murals and street art made by Asian American artists all of the time. This map, of some of the best-known murals, appears in Pan-Asian Metropolis — Asian-American Murals in Los Angeles.\n\nASIAN-AMERICAN PUBLIC ART ON THE RAILS\n\nAnother very specific map made in 2016 for Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, in which I attempted to map all of the Asian American-made art featured in local train stations and platforms. The map appears in Nobody Drives in LA — Asian-American Public Art on Public Transit.\n\nASIAN-AMERICAN PUBLIC SCULPTURE, MONUMENTS, AND MEMORIALS IN LOS ANGELES\n\nThe last of 2016’s Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month-related posts is of public sculpture, monuments, and memorials in Los Angeles created by Asian American artists and/or depicting Asian or Asian American culture and history. It appears in Pan-Asian Metropolis — Public Sculpture, Monuments, and Memorials in Los Angeles.\n\nAUSTRALIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAustralia is both a continent and a country. It has been inhabited by humans for an estimated 65,000 years. Dutch explorers named it New Holland in 1606. Today, immigrants account for 29% of its population. This map (with necessary updates and additions) will hopefully appear in a future edition of No Enclave.\n\nBARCELONA\n\nBarcelona is the capital and largest city of Catalonia. I visited in 2019. This map appears in Where Fools Fear to Tread — A Snapshot of Barcelona.\n\nTHE BEACH CITIES\n\nThe Beach Cities are a sub-region of the South Bay comprising the suburban, oceanfront cities of Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, and Redondo Beach. The Beach Cities are served by a mass transit agency called Beach Cities Transit. All three also have their own piers.\n\nBEYOND THE MULTIPLEX: LOS ANGELES’S ART, DOLLER, DRIVE-IN, FOREIGN, OUTDOOR, REVIVAL, SECOND RUN, SMUT, AND OTHER CINEMAS\n\nThe lengthy, descriptive title of this map hopefully makes clear its subject. It appeared in several pieces:\n\nCalifornia Fool’s Gold’s Guide to Los Angeles’s Revival Cinemas\n\nFor Ozoners Only — On this day, in 1933, the first drive-in theater opened\n\nLos Angeles’s Secret, Foreign Language Movie Theater Scene\n\nBLACK LOS ANGELES\n\nA map of Black majority communities in Los Angeles County as of the 2010 census. Also included is Little Ethiopia, which whilst not black majority community, is notable for being Los Angeles’s only African enclave.\n\nBOLIVIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nBolivia is a landlocked country that stretches from the Amazon to the Andes. The first settlers were likely the Aymara, who arrived some 2,500 years ago. Today, the Aymara are outnumbered by the Quechua, another Native American people. Los Angeles’s Bolivian American community is fairly large — outnumbered only by the communities in New York City and Washington, DC. That said, there are relatively few Bolivian businesses or institutions in the region. The map appears in No Enclave — Exploring Bolivian Los Angeles.\n\nBRAZILIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nThis map appeared in No Enclave — Exploring Brazilian Los Angeles. An estimated 10,000 or so Brazilians live in Los Angeles. Approximately one third live in Palms or Culver City where, for decades, locals have referred to the area around Venice Boulevard as Little Brazil or Pequeno Brasil. This map appeared in No Enclave — Exploring Brazilian Los Angeles.\n\nBRONZEVILLE\n\nFrom roughly 1942-1946, during the incarceration of Japanese Americans in concentration camps, the vacated Little Tokyo neighborhood became a thriving black community known as Bronzeville. I attempted to map the historic locations of black businesses from the era and helped lead a walk an account of which appeared, along with this map, in Urban Rambles – Exploring Bronzeville with Maya and Michael.\n\nBUNYA PINES IN THE SOUTHLAND\n\nBunya Pines (Araucaria bidwillii), are not actually pines. Araucaria do have characteristics in common with pines, though, including the fact that they’re evergreens and coniferous. They were briefly popular landscape choice although the massive cones make them better suited to cemeteries than to parks or residential communities. The map appeared in a piece about the most famous bunya in Los Angeles titled Those Useless Trees – El Pino Famoso.\n\nBURMESE LOS ANGELES\n\nMetro Los Angeles is home to an estimated 5,000 or so Burmese Americans. Their presence of evinced, in large part, by the numerous Burmese restaurants which have opened (and in an unfortunate number of cases, closed) in the region. This map appears in No Enclave — Exploring Burmese Los Angeles.\n\nBUSAN – 부산시\n\nIn 2017, I visited Busan (부산시), South Korea‘s second-largest city. I was only there for a few days but it, more than Seoul, reminded me of Koreatown. In 1957, Busan adopted a division system with the creation of six “gu.” Today, Busan is divided into fifteen gu and one “gun.” I attempted to map them and a few of the places I visited. The map appears in Where Fools Fear To Tread — A Snapshot of Korea (Seoul and Busan).\n\nTHE CALIFORNIA CHANNEL ISLANDS\n\nThere are eight main islands in the Channel Islands archipelago. Their total human population is about 4,000 people, most of whom live on Santa Catalina Island. They are also home to at least 145 endemic species including the Channel Island Fox, which is believed to have rafted to the northern islands as many as 16,000 years ago. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — A Channel Islands Primer.\n\nCALIFORNIA FOOL’S GOLD\n\nI began exploring and writing about my adventures in Southern California in 2007. I named my series California Fool’s Gold in homage to Huell Hower‘s much-missed television series, California’s Gold. This map, which highlights in red the communities I’ve explored, appears on the California Fool’s Gold page.\n\nCANADIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nIn the vast diversity of Los Angeles, Canadians are mostly overlooked. There are, however, more Angelenos of Canadian origin than there are residents of 44,000, there are still more Canadians living in Los Angeles than there are in any town on Prince Edward Island, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, or Yukon. This map appeared in No Enclave — Exploring Canadian Los Angeles.\n\nCENTRAL LOS ANGELES\n\nA map of Central Los Angeles and the regions within it: Downtown, Hollywood, Mideast, and Midtown Los Angeles (and the neighborhoods within them).\n\nTHE CHANNEL ISLANDS (LOS ANGELES COUNTY)\n\nThe Channel Islands are an eight-island archipelago along the Santa Barbara Channel. Five of the islands are part of Channel Islands National Park and the waters surrounding these islands make up Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. Two of the islands, San Clemente and Santa Catalina, are part of Los Angeles County and form the county region known as The Channel Islands. This map appears in “California Fool’s Gold — A Channel Islands Primer.”\n\nCHILEAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAs of 2010, there were 10,471 Chileans living in the Los Angeles area, making it the third-largest community of Chilean Americans after those of Miami and New York City. That same year, 126,810 Chilean Americans were counted by the census, with the largest number (24,006) living in California. This map appears in “No Enclave — Chilean Los Angeles.”\n\nCITIES ADJACENT TO LOS ANGELES\n\nThere are 88 incorporated cities in Los Angeles County. Los Angeles dominates them all, of course, in terms of area and population. 31 cities share a border with the city of Los Angeles.\n\nCOLOMBIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nColombians are the largest group of South Americans living in the US. They are not especially prevalent in California, however, the Colombian American population of which is smaller than that of New York, Florida, and New Jersey. The local presence of Colombians is mostly evinced by the region’s Colombian restaurants as well as a few vendors of shapewear known as “fajas.” This map appears in No Enclave — Colombian Los Angeles.\n\nCOSTA RICAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAs of 2010, there were 11,371 Costa Ricans living in the Los Angeles area, making it the third-largest community of Costa Rican-Americans after those of Miami and New York City. There are, however, very few overt examples of their presence in Metro Los Angeles. This map will appear, in the future, in an edition of No Enclave.\n\nCUBAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAs of 2010, the Los Angeles area had a population of 49,702 Cuban Americans, making the Los Angeles Cuban-American community the fourth largest in the country, behind those of Tampa, New York City, and Miami. Traditionally the community was centered in Echo Park and Silver Lake but today is quite diffuse. This map will appear, in the future, in an edition of No Enclave.\n\nDETROIT\n\nDetroit is the largest and most populous city in Michigan, the largest American city on the United States–Canada border, and the second-largest urban area in theMidwest after the Chicago metropolitan area. I visited in 2019. This map appears in Where Fools Fear to Tread — A Day in Detroit.\n\nDOMINICAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAs of 2015, there were approximately 1.87 million people of Dominican descent in the US, making them the fifth-largest Hispanic group in the country. This map will appear, in the future, in an edition of No Enclave.\n\nTHE DOORS’ LOS ANGELES\n\nThe Doors were a rock band formed in Venice in 1965. The band took its name from the title of Aldous Huxley‘s The Doors of Perception, itself a reference to a poem by William Blake. After signing with Elektra Records, the Doors released their eponymous debut on 4 January 1967. 50 years later, on that date, Los Angeles City Council proclaimed that date the Day of the Doors. This map appeared in Happy Day of the Doors, Los Angeles.\n\nDOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES\n\nA uniquely difficult region to map, as the neighborhoods within — especially the “districts,” tend to be rather amorphous. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — A Downtown Primer.\n\nDOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES PEOPLE MOVER\n\nConstruction of the “Downtown Los Angeles Auxiliary Transit and Satellite Parking System” began in Downtown Los Angeles but was never completed. Today, the unfinished remnants are known as the Calvin S. Hamilton Pedway. If completed in its day, it would’ve likely been seen as a transit and mobility failure. If completed today, however, it would no doubt be a massive attraction in its own right. This map appears in Nobody Drives in LA — Exploring Downtown’s Calvin S. Hamilton Pedway.\n\nEAST HOLLYWOOD\n\nThe East Hollywood community was annexed by Los Angeles in 1910, just a couple of weeks after the annexation of the town of Hollywood. Today it’s usually considered to be a sub-region of Hollywood and, as such, one comprised of several neighborhoods.\n\nTHE EASTSIDE\n\nThe Eastside doesn’t have an official definition and has meant different things to different Angelenos. To many, it refers to the communities east of Main Street (or the 110 Freeway) — especially those of South Los Angeles. To most, however, it refers to the communities east of the Los Angeles River. Since the 1970s, however, it has often been regarded as distinct from those eastside communities of Northeast Los Angeles. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — An Eastside Primer.\n\nECUADORIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAs of 2010, there were 23,118 Ecuadorians living in the Los Angeles area, making Los Angeles home to the third-largest community of Ecuadorian-Americans after those of Miami and New York City. This map will appear, in the future, in an edition of No Enclave.\n\nELYSIAN HEIGHTS\n\nElysian Heights is a neighborhood in Los Angeles’s Mideast region. Although its existence predates that of Echo Park, it is generally regarded as part of it. This map, currently in progress, will appear in a future California Fool’s Gold piece.\n\nELYSIAN PARK\n\nA map of Elysian Park that also depicts both the park as well as the former communities of Bishop, La Loma, and Palo Verde — and the planned (but never built) community of Elysian Hills Heights. It appeared in Southland Parks — Elysian Park.\n\nENGLISH LOS ANGELES\n\nI don’t remember where but I believe that I once read or heard that Santa Monica is the number one destination for English “expats” (the English, for whatever reason, are always “expats” and never immigrants). Although diminished, Santa Monica is sometimes referred to as “Little Britain.” This map appears in No Enclave — English Los Angeles.\n\nERITREAN LOS ANGELES\n\nIn 2015, there were 39,063 Eritrea-born Americans and 18,917 US-born Americans of Eritrean ancestry. California is the state with the largest number of Eritreans and growing communities exist in the Temescal neighborhood of Oakland, Inglewood, and elsewhere. This map appears in No Enclave — Eritrean Los Angeles.\n\nETHNIC ENCLAVES OF LOS ANGELES (AND ORANGE)\n\nMetro Los Angeles is, by many measures, the most diverse metropolitan area on Earth. This is a map of historic, emerging, recognized and unrecognized ethnic enclaves in Los Angeles. Of course, there are also many more ethnicities that don’t tend to settle in enclaves.\n\nGLASGOW\n\nGlasgow (Scots: Glesga; Scottish Gaelic: Glaschu) is the largest city in Scotland. Inhabitants of the city are referred to as “Glaswegians” and “Weegies”. Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement on the River Clyde to become the largest seaport in Britain, a major center of the Scottish Enlightenment, a hub of transatlantic trade with North America and the West Indies, and a major producer of top indie bands. This map appears in Where Angels Fear to Tread — A Snapshot of Glasgow.\n\nTHE HARBOR AREA\n\nThe Harbor Area (also known as the Harbor District or simply “the Harbor”) refers to the communities located on or near the San Pedro Bay. It is the site of both the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, which together forms the fifth-busiest port facility in the world and the busiest outside of East Asia. It is also home to the county’s second-most-populous city, Long Beach. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — A Harbor Primer.\n\nTHE HISTORIC CORE\n\n“Historic Core” was coined around 1990 to refer to the neighborhood of Downtown sometimes referred to as “Old Downtown.” It’s not the oldest part of Downtown, however, but was the area that thrived in the early decades of the 20th Century. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — Exploring the Historic Core.\n\nLOS ANGELES PUB CHAINS\n\nAfter visiting the UK, where I experienced my first chain pub, I became curious as to whether or not the US ever had anything similar. When I learned that places like TGIFriday’s, Applebee’s, Chili’s &c were themselves pretty much pub chains — and one’s with histories as “fern bars” for singles, I became even more interested in these places to which I’d never until then paid much attention. This map appeared in “Swinging Doors — The Chain Pubs of Los Angeles.”\n\nLOS ANGELES RIVER\n\nThe Los Angeles River flows 82 kilometers east across the San Fernando Valley and then south into the San Pedro Bay. Encouraged by the ease of my ride along the San Gabriel River, I attempted to ride its length in a day. However, whereas that river path passes unbroken through or along 25 cities and unincorporated communities, the Los Angeles River trail currently exists in twelve disconnected fragments between its source and halfway point… which is as far as I got in a day. This map appeared in “There It Is, Revitalize It — The Los Angeles River.”\n\nLOS ANGELES SQUARES\n\nn most cities, a square refers to a planned public space that usually hosts various public events, in other words a city square, market square, public square, town square, urban square, piazza, plaza, or town green. In Los Angeles, it means a beige sign over an intersection surrendered to the automobile. Since 2000, Los Angeles City Council has designated numerous intersections as “squares.” This map appeared in “Greater Streets — Los Angeles Squares, or When is a Square Not a Square?”\n\nLOS ANGELES TRAIN PUB CRAWL\n\nAfter a series of half-assed train pub crawls appeared in various listicle factories I decided to create a more serious, researched, and all-inclusive map of every izakaya, pub, piano bar, brewery, tasting rooms, leather bar, pijiu wu, gastropub, hotel bar, gasthaus, and taverns within easy walking distance of a train station. This map appeared in “Swinging Doors — Los Angeles Train Pub Crawl.”\n\nLOS ANGELES WETLANDS\n\nAs a region dominated by hilly chaparral scrubland, Los Angeles experiences heavy seasonal rains during most winters. Historically, gravity and water conspired to form countless seasonal streams, rivers, marshes, lagoons, ponds, and other wetlands. Today, most waterways have been channelized in concrete or redirected into subterranean channels. Most of the wetlands have been drain and replaced with development. This map appeared in “There It Is, Revitalize It — The Southland’s Wetlands.”\n\nLOS ANGELES WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH\n\nAs of 2014, there were an estimated 5,129,169 women living in Los Angeles County — more than the entire population of 34 states and dependencies of the US. With a female density of roughly 2,697 women per square mile, Metro Los Angeles is more crowded with women than any other urban area in the country too. Here are a few places important to local women’s history. This map appeared in “Women’s History Month: 25 Women in Los Angeles History.”\n\nLOS ANGELES’S ASIAN-AMERICAN SKYSCRAPERS\n\nIn 2016, for Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, I wrote a piece about the skyscrapers of Los Angeles designed by Asian-American skyscrapers. This map appeared in “High Rising — Los Angeles’s Asian-American Skyscrapers.”\n\nLOS ANGELES’S BUDDHIST TEMPLES, HINDU TEMPLES, SIKH GURDWARAS, ASIAN-AMERICAN CHURCHES, &c.\n\nAll of the world’s religions with the most followers (i.e. Bahá’í, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism) originated in Asia — although I don’t think most folks characterize those born in the Middle East as “Asian regions.” In addition to Los Angeles’s Buddhist, Confucius, Hindu, Sikh, and Taoist temples, however, there are also Japanese Baptist Churches, Korean Presbyterian congregations, and places of worship for Chinese and Vietnamese Catholics. This map appeared in “Pan-Asian Metropolis — Los Angeles’s Asian Temples.”\n\nLOS ANGELES’S EASTSIDE AND WESTSIDE\n\nAthough there are twenty regions in Los Angeles, the main “rivalry” — if that’s not too strong a word, seems to be between the Eastside and Westside. Interestingly, most Westsiders have never seemingly been to the Eastside and, as they move east, make it abundantly clear that they don’t even know where or what it is. That’s why I made this map.\n\nLOS ANGELES’S EMERGING AND UNOFFICIAL ENCLAVES\n\nI reckon most Angelenos know of Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Saigon, Little Tokyo, and Thai Town. Perhaps, if they’re observant or at all clued in about their home, they also know of Cambodia Town, Filipinotown, Little Armenia, Little Bangladesh, Little Ethiopia, Little India, or Little Seoul. If they know their Los Angeles history, they know that there used to be a Frenchtown, Greek Town, Little Italy, and Sonoratown. How many folks, though, know about Little Arabia, Little Belize, Little Brazil, Little Britain, Little Mongolia, Little Odessa, Little Taipei, Oaxacatown, or Tehrangeles — none of which have been granted official recognition by the city? This map appears in “No Enclave — Emerging and Unofficial Ethnic Enclaves of Los Angeles.”\n\nLOS ANGELES’S FRONTIER NEIGHBORHOODS\n\nThis is a map of Los Angeles neighborhoods located at the edge of city… frontier neighborhoods if you will.\n\nLOS ANGELES’S HIDDEN WATERWAYS\n\nLos Angeles is criss-crossed with rivers and streams. Historically, some were fed year round by springs whilst appeared with the arrival of the rainy season and dried up not long after its departure. Today, most are channelized into concrete washes or entombed underground in tunnels. The vast majority of this work was done by the folks at L.A. Creek Freak. I superimposed their map of waterways on my own map of Los Angeles neighborhoods and added a few minor details (mainly stream names in a few cases).\n\nLOS ANGELES’S SOLITARY SUBURBAN LANDSCAPES\n\nIn the pre-NIMBY age, a tall building would occasionally rise up from the suburban floor like and loom over the single story landscape like Orthanc — the tower of Isengard. Then NIMBYs decided that neighborhood character didn’t just mean using economic segregation and car-centricity to keep out the poors and urbanists — but also preserving a two-story height limit so that no single-family houses will suffer the indignity of having a cooling shadow cast upon them. This map appears in “Highrising — Solitary Skyscrapers of Suburbia.”\n\nMACARTHUR PARK\n\nEven at its most sullied and neglected, MacArthur Park is one of Los Angeles’s greatest urban parks. It’s also one of the oldest, having begun as Westlake Park in 1886. This map of the park and nearby amenities appears in “Southland Parks — Visiting MacArthur Park.”\n\nMAJOR CITIES OF THE INDIAN OCEAN\n\nWe humans tend to divide ourselves up, culturally speaking, into countries and continents — but for coastal peoples, it seems to me, there are shared ties to the oceans. The Indian Ocean is the third-largest of the world’s oceans, sharing borders with Africa, Asia, and Australia.\n\nMAJOR CITIES OF THE PACIFIC\n\nThree of the world’s four most populous nations have borders on the Pacific Ocean. As someone living in a city on the Pacific, I often feel like my city has closer ties places on the other side of the ocean (e.g. Manila, Honolulu, Seoul, Sydney, Taipei, and Tokyo) than it does those on the other side of the country (e.g. Atlantic City, Fort Lauderdale, Long Island, and the Jersey Shore).\n\nMAJOR HUMAN SETTLEMENTS OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN\n\nNot to make light of the worsening climate crisis, but as someone who can barely tolerate warm weather, I may at some point in my life have to move to the Arctic. Thus, I began researching cities (and smaller settlements) on the Arctic Coast, where the weather might still be cool enough for a few more years.\n\nMALAYSIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, there were then 26,179 Americans of Malaysian background. California is home to the largest population. There are few overt indications of Malaysians presence in Los Angeles, however, outside of a handful of businesses located primarily in the San Gabriel Valley. This map appears “No Enclave — Exploring Malaysian Los Angeles.”\n\nMAPPED BY PENDERSLEIGH & SONS CARTOGRAPHY\n\nAt some point it dawned on my that I should map the places that I’ve mapped… and explored. This map appears on the California Fool’s Gold homepage.\n\nMAYA CIVILIZATION\n\nI’ve been fascinated with the Maya at least since I was about seven years old and read Mystery of the Maya. Using iron-on crayons, I even made robe with decorated with drawings of Maya pyramids. In 2017, I finally visited the Riviera Maya and made this map, included in “Where Fools Fear to Tread — A Snapshot of Mexico (Tulum, Teotihuacan & Mexico City).”\n\nMETRO RAPID BUS AND RAIL\n\nIf only bus-only lanes were possible for Metro’s Rapid Buses… then they’d be rapid in more than just name. What’s good enough for other city’s mass transit riders, however, is more than the mass transit riders of Los Angeles can reasonably expect and so we’re left to dream of a network of rapid bus transit lines that would transform this city. This map appeared in “Nobody Drives in LA — Get on the Rapid Bus.”\n\nMID-CITY WITH MACHIKO\n\n2017 was the tenth year of me writing about exploring Los Angeles. For that anniversary, I asked friends and readers to suggest walks and I thus undertook explorations with Machiko, Maya, Mayra, and Michael. I’d previously undertaken one with a neighbor named Marvin. The fact that all of my partners were Asian Americans whose given names started with “m” was a strange coincidence. At the time, Machiko lived in Mid-City (more “m”s) and this map appeared in “Urban Rambles — Exploring Mid-City with Machiko.”\n\nMIDEAST LOS ANGELES (THE MIDEAST SIDE)\n\nMideast Los Angeles — or MELA if you’re into that whole brevity thing — is a region of Los Angeles located between Midtown, the Eastside, and Northeast Los Angeles (NELA). It contains within it the neighborhoods of Angeleno Heights, Echo Park, Elysian Heights, Franklin Hills, Frogtown, Los Feliz, Pico-Union, Silver Lake, Victor Heights, and Westlake — as well as two of the city’s best-known parks, Elysian and Griffith. This map appears in “California Fool’s Gold — A Mideast Side Primer.”\n\nMIDTOWN LOS ANGELES\n\nMidtown Los Angeles is a region of Los Angeles. It contains within it well-known sub-regions such as Mid-City, Mid-City West, Mid-Wilshire, Wilshire Center as well as many micro-neighborhoods, the names of which are unrecognizable to most Angelenos living outside of them. This map appears in “California Fool’s Gold — A Midtown Primer.”\n\nMISSOURI\n\nI spent most of my formative years in the state of Missouri — the birthplace of ragtime, Mark Twain, Kansas City Jazz, cashew chicken, St. Louis Blues. This map appears in “Happy Missouri Day! – Yup, It’s aready been a yurr since the last’n.”\n\nMORETON BAY FIGS IN LOS ANGELES\n\nThe Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla), like many of the Southland’s urban trees, is an Australian immigrant (see also eucalyptus, carrotwood, bottlebrush, river red gum, bunya pine, and Australian willow). But, unlike those other Antipodean imports, several Moreton Bay figs have risen to the ranks of celebrity. Such is the case of the Aoyama Tree in Little Tokyo. This map appears in “Those Useless Trees — The Aoyama Tree.”\n\nNEPALI SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (नेपाली लस एन्जलस)\n\nAs of 2010, there were only 6,231 Nepali Americans living in California. However, Nepalis then comprised the fastest growing population of South Asians, due in large part to the Nepalese Civil War. There is a small but notable Nepali presence in Los Angeles. This map was included in “No Enclave — Exploring Nepali Los Angeles.”\n\nNEWPORT BEACH\n\nNewport Beach is a coastal city in South Orange County. Newport Harbor once supported maritime industries but today is used primarily for recreation. I explored it for California Fool’s Gold in 2019. This map appears in “California Fools Gold — Exploring Newport Beach.”\n\nNICARAGUAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAs of 2010, there were 348,202 Americans of Nicaraguan descent in the US. Most live in either Florida or California. In the latter, most live in either the San Francisco Bay or Metro Los Angeles. This map will appear in a future edition of No Enclave.\n\nNIGERIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nHome to nearly 200 million residents, Nigeria is the most-populous country in Africa. Nigerian Americans also comprise the largest percentage of African American immigrants. The largest number of Nigerian Americans live in Texas, followed by Maryland, New York, and California. This map appears in “No Enclave — Exploring Nigerian Los Angeles.”\n\nNORTH ASIA\n\nNorth Asia is is a massive sub-region of Asia. Approximately 13,100,000 square kilometers, it is home to only 33 million or so residents — just .74% of Asia’s population. For such a large region — roughly 1.5 times the size of Brazil — it’s one of the least discussed regions in the planet. For that and for other reasons, it fascinates me. This map appears in “Unrecognized Nations: North Asia.”\n\nNORTH ORANGE COUNTY\n\nOrange County is, when divided into regions, most often split simply into North and South Orange County. Whereas South Orange County is largely comprised of mostly-white, recently-built, red-tile roofed, master-planned gated communities; North Orange County is largely characterized by post-World War II suburbs that are home to a diverse population of Latinos, Vietnamese, Koreans, Arabs, and others. This map appears in “California Fool’s Gold — A North Orange County Primer.”\n\nNORTH ORANGE COUNTY AND THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY\n\nNorth Orange County and the San Gabriel Valley are neighboring regions supposedly separated by a political border but with much in common demographically, geographically, and culturally. I would imagine that the average resident of La Habra has more in common with the average resident of La Habra Heights than they do someone in Laguna Beach (or than the resident of La Habra Heights has with the typical resident of Malibu). I made this map in the style of 18th century Chinese cartographer, Mo Yi-tong, to challenge views of the regions through this recontextualization.\n\nNORTHEAST LOS ANGELES\n\nNortheast Los Angeles is a region of Los Angeles that is contains within it the first three communities to be annexed by Los Angeles: Garvanza, Highland Park, and Sycamore Grove. In 1922, the communities of Hermon, York Valley, and part of Annandale agreed to join the Greater Highland Park Association. Other communities in the region include Cypress Park, Eagle Rock, Glassell Park, Montecito Heights, and Monterey Hills. This map appears in “California Fool’s Gold — A Northeast Los Angeles Primer.”\n\nNORTHWEST LOS ANGELES\n\nPerhaps no regional identity has moved as far from its original location as has that of Northwest Los Angeles. When Northwest Los Angeles Improvement Association began meeting, around 1894, the northwest corner of Los Angeles was still located at the corner of Fountain Avenue and Hoover Street. The Improvement Association on the edge of Downtown, though, near the intersection of Montreal and Sand — a corner long ago obliterated by the construction of the interchange of the 110 and 101 freeways. Since the 1940s, it the moniker has more often been applied to the region in the northwestern-most corner of Los Angeles County, including the third largest city in the county, Santa Clarita, and small hamlets like Three Points, Pine Store, and Gorman. This map appears in “California Fool’s Gold — A Northwest Los Angeles County Primer.”\n\nOLD SCHOOL NEW ORLEANS HIP-HOP\n\nI’m a big fan of old school New Orleans hip-hop. That’s why I wrote about Big Boy, Cash Money, Mobo, No Limit, Parkway Pumpin’, Take Fo’, Tombstone, Untouchable, bounce music, sissy rappers, and more. I may go back and add this map to some of those pieces.\n\nOLDEST SURVIVING RESTAURANTS IN LOS ANGELES\n\nFrom the 1880s to the 1980s, these are the oldest restaurants in Metro Los Angeles that are still in operation (and a few that aren’t). This map appeared in “Los Angeles’s Oldest Surviving Restaurants.”\n\nORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITIES\n\nThere are 3,007 counties and 135 county equivalents (i.e. parishes, organized boroughs, census areas, independent cities, and the District of Columbia). Home to over three million people, Orange County is the sixth-most populous such region in the US. From 1850-1889, what’s now Orange County was part of Los Angeles County. Today it remains part of the Metro Los Angeles urban area.\n\nORANGE COUNTY’S LOST CHINATOWNS\n\nSince the 1590s, Chinatowns (唐人街) have sprung up around the world. Some, like those in Orange County, have long-since vanished. This map appeared in “Pan-Asian Metropolis — Orange County’s Lost Chinatowns.”\n\nPAKISTANI LOS ANGELES\n\nLos Angeles is home to a large population of Pakistani-Americans, second in size only to the New York-New Jersey area, but the population is fairly diffuse and there is no Little Pakistan, official or unofficial. This map appeared in “No Enclave — Exploring Pakistani Los Angeles.”\n\nPALMS, LOS ANGELES\n\nPalms is a neighborhood that founded as an agricultural and vacation community in 1886. Today it’s mostly comprised of apartment buildings, crisscrossed with commercial corridors, and the most densely populated community on the Westside. This map appeared in “California Fool’s Gold — Exploring Palms.”\n\nPANAMANIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 165,456 Americans of Panamanian descent. With a population of 17,768, California follows Florida and New York in population numbers. With a population of 6,353, Metro Los Angeles has the fourth-most populous Panamanian American population. This map will appear in a future edition of No Enclave.\n\nPASADENA\n\nPasadena is the ninth-most populous city in Los Angeles County and the 40th-most populous largest city in California. Incorporated in 1886, it’s one of the oldest cities in Los Angeles County. Home to Caltech, Pasadena City College, Fuller Theological Seminary, ArtCenter College of Design, Laemmle’s Playhouse 7, the Pasadena Playhouse, the Norton Simon Museum, and the USC Pacific Asia Museum — among other attractions — it’s a center of culture and learning in the region. This map, showing Pasadena’s neighborhoods, appeared in “California Fool’s Gold — Exploring Pasadena, The Crown City of Roses.”\n\nPEQUENO SEUL\n\nPequeño Seúl (작은 서울) is the name of Mexico City‘s Korean enclave. The first Korean migrants settled in Yucatán. Today, Mexico City is the preferred destination and an estimated 6,000 live in or near Pequeño Seúl. This map appeared in “Where Fools Fear to Tread — A Snapshot of Mexico (Tulum, Teotihuacan & Mexico City).”\n\nPERUVIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAs of 2018, there were 628,603 Americans of Peruvian descent. California has the second-largest population, after Florida. Metro Los Angeles is home to roughly 48,380. This map will appear in a future edition of No Enclave.\n\nTHE POMONA VALLEY (LOS ANGELES COUNTY)\n\nThe Pomona Valley is a valley located between the San Gabriel and San Bernardino valleys, formed by the Santa Ana River and its tributaries. The valley spans Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties and thus includes communities in both counties. As a region of Los Angeles County, however, the San Bernardino County communities of Chino, Chino Hills, Montclair, Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga, and Upland are not included in that usage. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — A Pomona Valley Primer.\n\nPUEBLO OF LOS ANGELES (1781 BOUNDARIES WITH CONTEMPORARY NEIGHBORHOODS)\n\nFrom 1781 until 1869, Los Angeles was a perfect square. Last year and this, pedestrian advocacy group Los Angeles Walks has been leading walks to and from each of the four corners. At the time of writing, one walk (from the northeast corner to the northwest) remains. After I complete it, I’ll probably include his map in an edition of Nobody Drives in LA.\n\nPUERTO RICAN LOS ANGELES\n\nPuerto Ricans are not particularly numerous in California, where they encompass roughly half a percent of the state’s total Latino population. 29.5% of the state’s population live in Metro Los Angeles and this map will likely be included in a future edition of No Enclave.\n\nREGIONS OF LOS ANGELES\n\nUnlike most large cities, there are no official regional designations in Los Angeles. Paris has its arrondissements, New York City its boroughs, Busan and Seoul have gu (구), Taipei has qū (區), St. Louis and New Orleans both have wards, Mexico City has municipios, and on. I’ve nevertheless attempted here to map the colloquially recognized regions of the county. This map appeared in “Los Angeles Linguistics Part 2: Regional Differences.”\n\nRIVERSIDE\n\nRiverside is a city in, and the county seat of, Riverside County. It is the most populous city in the Inland Empire — the birthplace of the California citrus industry. It’s home to the University of California, Riverside, the Fox Performing Arts Center, Riverside Metropolitan Museum, the California Museum of Photography, and other attractions which make it one of the most desirable communities in the Inland Empire.\n\nSALVADORAN LOS ANGELES\n\nMetro Los Angeles is home to the largest population of Salvadorans outside of El Salvador, the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central America. Salvadorans comprise the second-largest Latino population in Metro Los Angeles as well as the second-largest foreign-born population. This map appeared in “No Enclave — Exploring Salvadoran Los Angeles.”\n\nSAMOAN LOS ANGELES\n\nSamoan-Americans are the second largest group of Pacific Islanders in the US, after Hawaiians. The largest population on the US mainland live in Los Angeles, home as of 2010 to roughly 54,000. Evidence of their presence is reflected in the existence of their churches, restaurants, and organizations. This map appeared in “No Enclave — Exploring Samoan Los Angeles.”\n\nSAN DIEGO NEIGHBORHOODS\n\nSan Diego is the second-most populous city in California, the eighth-most populous in the US, the fifteenth-most populous in North America, and (as of 2018), the 135th-most populous in the world. The ancestors of the indigenous Kumeyaay are widely believed to have first settled the area some 12,000 years ago. I’ve thus far explored little of it, though, and so made this neighborhood map in order to inform myself and to incentivize exploration. This map appeared in “California Fool’s Gold — A San Diego Neighborhoods Primer.”\n\nTHE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY\n\nThe San Fernando Valley — although one of several valleys in Los Angeles County (e.g. Antelope, Conejo, Crescenta, Hungry, Leona, Peace, Pomona, San Gabriel, and Santa Clarita) is nearly always referred to simply as the Valley. I would argue that it’s a much more urban, vibrant, diverse, cultured, and interesting place than most non-Valley-residing Angelenos are aware. This map appeared in “California Fool’s Gold — A San Fernando Valley Primer.”\n\nTHE SAN GABRIEL RIVER\n\nThe San Gabriel River flows 93 kilometers from a confluence in the San Gabriel Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. Along its banks, there’s a well-maintained bicycle path which I rode down one day. This map appeared in “There It Is, Revitalize It — The San Gabriel River.”\n\nTHE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY\n\nThe San Gabriel Valley is a fascinating yet largely overlooked suburban valley of Los Angeles County. It’s a cluster of largely Latino (mostly Mexican) and Pan-Asian communities (mostly Chinese, Hong Konger, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Korean, and Japanese). This map appeared in “California Fool’s Gold — A San Gabriel Valley Primer.”\n\nSAN PEDRO\n\nSan Pedro is a Harbor District neighborhood located on the San Pedro Bay. It’s one of my favorite neighborhoods in Los Angeles as it’s walkable, working-class, home to numerous attractions, and quite unlike the stereotypical Southern California coastal community. This map appeared in “California Fool’s Gold — Exploring San Pedro.”\n\nSANDBERG\n\nSandberg is the name of a small community that arose in the Sierra Pelona Mountains around Norwegian immigrant Harald Sandberg‘s Sandberg’s Summit Hotel. The hotel was used for various purposes after Sandberg’s death until it burnt to the ground. Today there’s almost nothing left of Sandberg except some ruins and a faded plaque. This map appeared in “California Fool’s Gold — Exploring Sandberg.”\n\nSANTA CLARITA\n\nSanta Clarita is now the third-most-populous city in Los Angeles County. It was only incorporated as a city in 1987, through the union of four unincorporated communities: Canyon Country, Newhall, Saugus, and Valencia. As such, it lacks the centrality of a traditional city and is often characterized instead as a “boomburb.”\n\nSANTA CRUZ ISLAND (LIMUW)\n\nWith an area of 249.952 km2, Santa Cruz Island is the largest island in California. The Chumash lived there for more than 10,000 years and knew it as Limuw (“place of the sea”). I visited the island during a heatwave in 2018 with the good folks of Maptime LA. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold – Exploring Santa Cruz Island.\n\nSANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS (LOS ANGELES COUNTY)\n\nThe Santa Monica Mountains are a coastal mountain range paralleling the Pacific Ocean. The name also applies to the westernmost region of Los Angeles County, a region that includes the communities of Agoura Hills, Cornell, Hidden Hills, Malibu, Monte Nido, Saratoga Hills, and Topanga. This map appeared in “California Fool’s Gold — A Santa Monica Mountains Primer.”\n\nSEOUL – 서울\n\nIn 2017, I visited Seoul (서울), officially the Seoul Special Metropolitan City — the capital of and largest city in South Korea. The Seoul Capital Area is home to roughly half of South Korea’s population. This map appears in Where Fools Fear To Tread — A Snapshot of Korea (Seoul and Busan).\n\nSILVER LAKE STAIRS\n\nI was commissioned to make a map of Silver Lake’s stairs by the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council. They only wanted public stairways and stair streets but I also included walk streets for the online version. I’ll probably expand this map, eventually, to include other neighborhoods.\n\nSINGAPOREAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAt just 719.1 km2, the Republic of Singapore is slightly smaller in area than Los Angeles’s San Gabriel Valley. Metro Los Angeles is home to an estimated 5,000 Angelenos of Singaporean background or ancestry. This map appeared in “No Enclave — Exploring Singaporean Los Angeles.”\n\nTHE SOUTH BAY\n\nThe South Bay refers to the southern end of the Santa Monica Bay and the communities located on and near it. Definitions of what constitutes the South Bay vary although nearly all include the Beach Cities and the communities of Palos Verdes peninsula. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — A South Bay Primer.\n\nSOUTH LOS ANGELES (SITES AND ATTRACTIONS)\n\nI need to clean up this map of South Los Angeles (Sites and Attractions)… perhaps update it, too.\n\nSOUTH LOS ANGELES’S EASTSIDE\n\nNo region of Los Angeles is likely defined with as much disagreement as the Eastside. To some, it refers to all (or just some) of the communities east of the Los Angeles River. To others, it includes parts of Midtown, East Hollywood, and Mideast Los Angeles. To those in South Los Angeles, it usually refers to the communities east of the 110 (and before its construction, Main Street). This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — A South Los Angeles Eastside Primer.\n\nSOUTH LOS ANGELES’S WESTSIDE\n\nDefinitions vary but before the construction of Harbor Freeway, many folks in South Los Angeles used to describe the communities west of Main Street and east of the South Bay as being the Westside. There’s an unspoken implication, I believe, that in doing so they are referring to the Westside of South Los Angeles and don’t regard, say, West Athens are belonging to the same region as, say, Westwood. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — A South Los Angeles Westside Primer.\n\nSOUTH ORANGE COUNTY\n\nSouth Orange County is generally regarded as being divided from North Orange County by California State Route 55 and Newport Avenue. In contrast to North Orange County, it is less densely-populated and dominated by master-planned communities. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — A South Orange County Primer.\n\nSOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES\n\nSoutheast Los Angeles is a region of Los Angeles County located between North Orange County, the San Gabriel Valley, and the Eastside of South Los Angeles. It is often referred to as the “Gateway Cities,” although that is a generic term used in several other counties and which, in Los Angeles, also includes parts of the Harbor and South Los Angeles. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — A Southeast Los Angeles Primer.\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA\n\nSouthern California is a geographic and cultural region that is roughly the same size as Bangladesh, Nepal, Tajikistan, and Greece. It is home to roughly 22,423,000 people. Its climates include alpine, chaparral, and desert.\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NIGHT MARKETS\n\nNight Markets are popular in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and in Southeast Asian cities with large populations of ethnic Chinese like Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. With Los Angeles being the world’s great Pan-Asian Metropolis, it’s no wonder that they’ve taken hold here. This map appears in Pan-Asian Metropolis — Southern California Night Markets.\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RAIL AND FERRY\n\nA map of passenger rail networks and ferry service routes for Southern California. Just for fun, I also included novelty trolleys, live steamers, model railroads, and restaurants located inside of old train cars. This map appears in Nobody Drives in LA — Los Angeles Train Map.\n\nSOUTHLAND THEATER\n\nMetro Los Angeles is home to a large number of theaters and theater companies. On any night, one can experience any number of live theater performances from big-budget musicals to no-budget experimental theater; original works, repertory classics, stand-up comedy, drag revues, performance art, puppetry, noh, opera, kabuki, magic shows, &c.\n\nSRI LANKAN LOS ANGELES\n\nThere were 45,159 Sri Lankans living in the US in 2010 and it was only in the 1990s that substantial numbers began arriving, mostly fleeing the Sri Lankan Civil War and mostly settling in and around New York City, central New Jersey, and the Los Angeles metropolitan areas. This map appears in “No Enclave — Exploring Sri Lankan Los Angeles.”\n\nTAIWAN (台灣)\n\nIn 2010, I visited Taiwan for the first time. I had little idea of what to expect beforehand. Once there, however, it felt as if I had discovered a soulmate of sorts. This map appears in Where Fools Fear to Tread — A Snapshot of Taiwan (Taipei & the East Coast).\n\nTOP 100 LOS ANGELES ATTRACTIONS (EXCLUDING CENTRAL LOS ANGELES AND THE WESTSIDE)\n\nMost local listiclers, advertorial hacks, and other uninspired chroniclers of Los Angeles culture would have readers believe that there’s nothing worth visiting in Los Angeles that isn’t in Central Los Angeles or the Westside. I made this map as a corrective. It appears in Top 100 Los Angeles Attractions (not in Central Los Angeles or the Westside).\n\nUNINCORPORATED LOS ANGELES COUNTY\n\nThere are 88 incorporated cities in Los Angeles County. There are also numerous unincorporated communities. Some, like Three Points, are incredibly obscure and home to a handful of residents. Others, like East Los Angeles, are home to more than 100,000 residents.\n\nUYGHUR LOS ANGELES\n\nUyghurs are an Asian people who mostly live in the Chinese province of Xinjiang, which most view as their homeland. There are significant diasporic populations in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, and Russia. The US also has a small population, most of whom live in either the Washington, DC or Los Angeles metropolitan areas. This map appears in No Enclave — Exploring Uyghur Los Angeles.\n\nVALLEY BOULEVARD\n\nValley Boulevard is the San Gabriel Valley’s main thoroughfare, its backbone; what Wilshire is to Midtown, Crenshaw is to South Los Angeles’s Westside, or Ventura Boulevard is to the San Fernando Valley. In 2016, I began walking the length of the street in segments with a dog named Dooley. By 2017, we had walked roughly half of its 45-kilometer length. Sadly, Dooley died before we began exploring the eastern half. This map appears in Greater Streets — Exploring Valley Boulevard.\n\nVEGETARIAN ASIAN RESTAURANTS\n\nAsia is home to some of the most vegetarian-friendly countries in the world, including India, Taiwan, and Israel. Metro Los Angeles, meanwhile, is the capital of pan-Asianism. Naturally, there are many — and have bee many more — vegetarian Asian restaurants of various sorts. This map appears in Pan-Asian Metropolis — Vegetarian Asian Restaurants in Los Angeles.\n\nVEGETARIAN LOS ANGELES\n\nAmericans eat more meat, per capita, than any other people in the world. On the other hand, California is home to more vegetarian and vegan restaurants than any other state. Southern California has a particularly strong tradition of vegetarian and veganism that stretches back at least to the 1870s. This map appears in the piece, Vegetarian and Vegan Los Angeles.\n\nTHE VERDUGOS\n\nThe Verdugos is a region of Los Angeles County that includes most of the areas in and around the Verdugo Mountains and Crescenta Valley. An exception is the city of Burbank, which although partly located in the Verdugo Mountains, is almost universally recognized as being associated with the San Fernando Valley. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — A Verdugos Primer.\n\nVIETNAMESE LOS ANGELES\n\nMetro Los Angeles is home to the largest Vietnamese community outside of Los Angeles. North Orange County, home to roughly two-thirds of that community, is home of the nation’s oldest and largest Little Saigon. This map appears in No Enclave — Exploring Vietnamese Los Angeles.\n\nWEHO PICKUP\n\nThe WeHo PickUp is West Hollywood‘s free and fun nighttime shuttle. Although it’s primarily used to convey clubgoers to various venues, there are also quite a few architectural, artistic, and attractions of other sorts along the route. This map appears in Nobody Drives in LA — Exploring Along the WeHo PickUp Line.\n\nTHE WESTSIDE\n\nThe Westside is a region of Los Angeles County. Definitions of what constitutes the Westside vary although a poll of Angelenos found that most consider its eastern border to be formed by La Cienega Boulevard. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — A Westside Primer.\n\nWESTWOOD\n\nWestwood is a neighborhood in Los Angeles’s Westside region. It’s best known for being the home of the University of California, Los Angeles — although there are many other attractions worth visiting. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — Exploring Westwood.\n\nWILSHIRE VISTA\n\nWilshire Vista is a neighborhood in the Midtown region of Los Angeles. This map appears in California Fool’s Gold — Exploring Wilshire Vista.\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nMaps of Ancient African Cities, Brightwell’s Los Angeles, Elysian Park’s Kite Hill, International Language Schools, Livable Los Angeles, Lizard City, Los Angeles Pocket Parks, Los Angeles Railway, Oldest Bars in Los Angeles, Swinging Doors Bar Map – Early Houses.\n\nEric Brightwell is an adventurer, essayist, rambler, explorer, cartographer, and guerrilla gardener who is always seeking paid writing, speaking, traveling, and art opportunities.

Salvadorans comprised about 8% of Latino Angelenos. Guatemaltecos comprised about 5% of the Latino Angeleno population. Los Angeles is, additionally, home to the largest populations of Mexicans, Salvadorans, and Guatemaltecos outside of their respective homelands.\n\nI’d wager that many Angelenos subconsciously think of Latino as being synonymous with people with roots in Mexico or Central America. There are, however, 33 countries and dependencies in Latin America, and representatives of all are likely living within Metro Los Angeles. One such people, Cuban Angelenos, were estimated to number approximately 39,793 in 2017. The 2010 census counted 49,702 Cubans living in the greater Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area. Both figures mean that Los Angeles home to the fourth-largest Cuban American population after Miami, New York City, and Tampa.\n\nCuban Americans are the third most numerous Latino people in the US and California is home to the second-largest state-wide population after that of Florida (home to roughly 70% of the nation’s population). Today most Cubans have some combination of African, European, and/or indigenous ancestry. Asian ancestry is also fairly common — especially Chinese — but also Filipino, Japanese, and Vietnamese.\n\nCuba was settled by humans at least as early as the 4th millennium BCE. The oldest known archeological site in Cuba dates from approximately 3100 BCE. The Guanajatabey are believed to be the island’s indigenous humans. The Ciboney and Taíno — both Arawak peoples — arrived from the Caribbean islands to the south and initially settled in Cuba’s eastern end.\n\nThe Spanish arrived in 1492 and conquered the island. Indigenous Cubans were enslaved and forced to work on sugar and tobacco plantations. After the indigenous population was mostly decimated and absorbed through intermarriage, attention was turned to Africa and ultimately, over a million Africans were abducted and forced into slavery on the island until 1867. In the 19th century, more than 100,000 Chinese were recruited to work on the plantations under harsh conditions.\n\nA series of rebellions in the 19th century failed to dislodge the Spanish. Ultimately, it was their defeat in the Spanish–American War which led to Spain’s withdrawal from the island. In 1898, the USS Maine (ACR-1) sank in Havana Harbor following a mysterious explosion that killed 260 American seamen. Whether or not it was a false flag operation, which many still believe, it provided the pretext for the US to attack Spain. As a result, the US expanded its empire extensively establishing military occupations in the Philippines and Cuba. In 1902, Cuba formally gained independence.\n\nCUBAN MUSIC IN LOS ANGELES\n\nThe music of Cuba includes many genres, several of which are quite popular in Los Angeles and, to a degree, throughout the country. It seems to me that Cuban music is — of all Latin American music — more likely to be appreciated by non-Latinos than the music of other Latin American cultures. When I first moved to Los Angeles, I occasionally took my lunch breaks at fast-casual Mexican chains like Baja Fresh and Green Burrito. Inevitably, the speakers would play Cuban, and never the Mexican or Tejano music that would seem, on the surface, to be more appropriate. When I find myself in such restaurants now, I make a point of cocking my ear toward the kitchen, where more often than not I can hear the cooks listening to either banda or cumbia.\n\nOne Cuban genre, bolero (filin), originated in eastern Cuba in the late 19th century, where it emerged out of the trova tradition. In the 1910s, bolero’s popularity spread to Puerto Rico and Mexico, where it was picked up by composers like Agustín Lara and María Grever. In the 1930s and ’40s, bolero spread throughout Latin America and Southern California, where one can still hear it being performed live at some Mexican restaurants.\n\nMambo was pioneered by the charanga Arcaño y sus Maravillas in the late 1930s and later popularized in the big band style by Pérez Prado. In the late-1940s, following the earlier beguine, tango, rumba, and samba crazes; mambo became the latest Latino music-and-dance craze to hit the US, thanks in large part to Pérez Prado, Tito Puente, and Tito Rodríguez. In the mid-1950s, Americans and others fell for the chachachá,— a slower style of mambo. In the 1970s, Cuban music was influential in the development of salsa.\n\nOther Cuban music genres include Afro, Afro-Cuban jazz, bakosó, canción, charanga, conga, contradanza (habanera), criolla, cubatón, danzón, descarga, guajira, guaracha,Mozambique, nueva trova, pachanga, pilón, pregón, punto guajiro, rumba (guaguancó, columbia, yambú, batá-rumba, guarapachangueo), son (montuno), songo, timba, and trova.\n\nIn 1997, the musical group Buena Vista Social Club released their debut album, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder, a collection of pre-revolutionary style Cuban music. It was an enormous international success. Its success was compounded when Wim Wenders released a documentary, also titled Buena Vista Social Club. The success of both sparked a craze for more traditional Cuban music although, not surprisingly, not so much popular contemporary Cuban enjoyed by young Cubans like reggaeton, hip-hop, pop, or rock.\n\nRepressive, American-backed military dictator Fulgencio Batista was overthrown during the Cuban Revolution, led by Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz, Raúl Modesto Castro Ruz, and Ernesto “Che” Guevara. Fidel quickly proved as uninterested in democracy as his predecessor and ruled the island as a repressive one-party state until his death in 2016. Some democratic reforms have been introduced in recent years and the UK-based Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) now ranks Cuba 142 out of 167 countries — just above Afghanistan. The US, for the record, has moved in the other direction in recent years, sliding down to 25, just below Estonia.\n\nCUBANS AMERICANS AND ANGELENOS\n\nThe first Cuban Americans lived in La Florida, the Spanish land province established in 1513 and governed by the Captaincy General of Cuba after its establishment in 1607. St. Augustine was established by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés in 1565 and was colonized by hundreds of Spanish-Cuban soldiers and their families.\n\nIn the 19th century, significant numbers of Cubans migrated to New Orleans, New York City, Key West, and Tampa. A mass exodus followed the conclusion of the Cuban Revolution, in 1959 and continued into 1962. Another mass exodus took place from 1965 until 1973. The former lead to the Cubanization of Westchester, the latter of Hialeah — both in the Miami metropolitan area. That Cubans favored Florida was natural, not only because the two are separated by a mere 169 kilometers.\n\nLos Angeles, on the other hand, is about 3,600 kilometers west by northwest. Still, between 1961 and ’66, some 14,000 some Cubans exiled settled there, most aided in doing so with government assistance. Many were former members of Cuba’s bourgeoisie and naturally, many opened businesses. One such entrepreneur, Sotero Machin opened a jewelry store in Echo Park called Alamar, and a travel agency, Cubamar. Other Cuban-owned businesses included Guiro Records, Havana Travel, La Economica, Mena’s Toys, and two newspapers: 20 de Mayo — a newspaper that published from 1969 until 2008 — and La Voz Libre — launched in 1981. Cubans formed organizations like Abdala, Alpha 66, and the Cuban Assistance League. In 1980, some 135,000 Cubans arrived in the US, with some settling in Los Angeles. Having departed Cuba from the Port of Mariel, they were nicknamed Marielitos. Among them were freed criminals and many established Cuban Americans viewed them with, at the very least, a degree of mistrust.\n\nCUBAN RESTAURANTS IN LOS ANGELES\n\nMany Cubans opened restaurants. Among the first were Gigi’s Café Cubano, which\n\nopened in Filipinotown in 1968; El Colmao, which opened in Pico Heights in 1969; and El Rincon Criollo, established in Culver City — also in 1969. The Madrid, which opened around 1971 in Echo Park, was a de facto community center. La Cubana Café, in Glendale‘s Mariposa neighborhood, was founded in 1973. Silver Lake‘s Café Tropical opened in 1975. The famed Cuban Bakery chain, Porto’s Bakery & Café, also began in Silver Lake, in 1976. Ramón Calderón opened what’s likely the oldest Cuban Restaurant in Orange County, Felix Continental Cafe, in 1979 (in the city of Orange). Orlando Garcia opened the first location of the local Cuban chain, Versailles, in Palms in 1981. Nightclub and restaurant El Floridita opened in Central Hollywood in 1987. El Cochinito opened in Silver Lake in 1988. In 2015, Caroline Lafaurie opened the world’s first vegan Cuban restaurant, Equelecuá Cuban Vegan Café in Inglewood. It has since relocated to Pasadena‘s Playhouse District. Evanice Holz has since joined them on the cruelty-free quest, offering vegan Cuban food at Señoreata, at Row DTLA‘s Smorgasburg.\n\nCuban cuisine developed from a blend of indigenous Cuban cooking traditions with those imported — along with ingredients — from Africa, Spain, China, France, Italy, Haiti, and broader Caribbean traiditions. Typical dishes and items include Moros y Cristianos, mixtos, arroz con leche, arroz con maiz, arroz con pollo, batido, bistec de palomilla, boliche, buñuelo, butifarra, camarones, chivirico, churros, croqueta, cucurucho, dulce de leche, empanada, flan de calabaza, flan de coco, flan de guayaba, flan de huevo, frijoles negros, frita, fufú de plátano, guayaba, majarete, medianoche, Mermelada, Mojo Criollo, Morcilla, Natilla, Papa rellena, Papitas fritas, Pasteles, Picadillo, platano maduro frito, pudín de pan, pulpeta, ropa vieja, sopa de pollo, tamale, tortilla de patatas, tasajo, tostada, tostones, tres leches cake, turrones, vaca frita,yuca con mojo, and yuca frita. Cuban drinks include Cafe Cubano, Carajillo, Cortadito, Cuba Libre, Daiquiri, El Presidente, Guarapo, Hatuey beer, Ironbeer Malta, Jupina, Materva, Mojito, and Piña Colada.\n\nOther local Cuban restaurants, caterers, and food trucks (or, in some cases, restaurants with Cuban items) include Ay Papa Que Rico, Baracoa Cuban Cafe, Buenavista Bakery & Cafe, Café Con Leche Catering LA, Cafe Cuba & Cakes, Café Tropical, Crispy Cuban, Don Francisco’s Coffee Casa Cubana, El Cochinito Restaurant, El Criollo, Florida Restaurant, Habana Vieja, Havana Herbs, Havana Mania, Isla Cuban-Latín Kitchen & Rum Bar, La Bamba Island Cuisine, La Taverna Cubana, Mambo’s Café, Mercedes Bar & Grille, Tropicana Bakery & Cuban Cafe.\n\nNow-closed Cuban restaurants and no-longer-operational restaurants and food trucks include Cuba De Oro Restaurant, El Rincon Cubano, La Caridad Restaurant, Mayra’s Authentic Cuban and Caribbean, ¡No Jodas!, Tony Cubano’s Café, and Xiomara on Melrose.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\n“The Best Cuban Restaurants in Los Angeles” (by Cynthia Dea)\n\n“Gigi’s Café Cubano | Eat the World Los Angeles” (by Jared Cohee)\n\n“Seven Essential Cuban Restaurants in Los Angeles” (by\n\nOther Cuban emigres, like sculptor Sergio López-Mesa, continued to work in the arts.\n\nHe designed the bust of poet José Julián Martí Pérez found in USC‘s Doheny Memorial Library — home of the Boeckmann Center for Iberian and Latin American Studies. López-Mesa also designed the bust found in Echo Park’s José Martí Plaza and Monument, that installed in the park in 1976 by a Cuban American arts and culture group called Patronato José Martí.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, Cubans originally favored the Mideast Los Angeles neighborhoods of Echo Park, Silver Lake, Elysian Heights, and Filipinotown. In 1961, a Los Angeles Times reporter covered the plot of 38 Cuban American members of the Echo Park Lions Club to overthrow Castro. The following year, a Cuban club was established at Echo Park’s St. Athansius Episcopal Church, offering English classes to its members.\n\nAlthough some referred to the stretch of Cuban businesses along Sunset Boulevard as “Little Havana,” the enclave was never formally recognized and after its brief heyday, most of the area’s Cuban Americans left the area in favor of neighboring suburbs like Glendale in the Verdugos; Burbank in the San Fernando Valley; Inglewood and Torrance in the South Bay; Long Beach in the Harbor District; Culver City on the Westside; and Huntington Park, South Gate, and Downey in Southeast Los Angeles. The annual Presencia Cubana (aka Echo Park Cuban Festival), launched in 1993, moved downtown, to El Pueblo, where it became the Cuban American Music Festival.\n\nCuban festivals and organizations are rare in Los Angeles today. In the past, there was a Cuban festival in Long Beach — the L.A. Cuban Festival. There’s still, as far as I know, an annual one in San Dimas — Mi Son Cubano Festival/Southern California Cuban Festival. The only active Cuban Angeleno organizations of which I’m aware are two Facebook groups: Cuban Heritage L.A. and Cubans In L.A.\n\nCUBAN ANGELENOS\n\nThere are several prominent Cuban Americans who at least at one time or another were also Angelenos, including:\n\nActors (Cameron Diaz, Cesar Romero, Daisy Fuentes, Desi Arnaz, Elizabeth Peña, Eva Mendes, Rosario Dawson)\n\nArtists (Sergio López-Mesa)\n\nAthletes (Kendrys Morales, Raúl Ibáñez, Yasiel Puig, and Yasmani Grandal)\n\nBloggers (Amy T.

Are you generally happy with the direction Los Angeles is going? Do you like the thrill of living paycheck-to-paycheck, juggling part-time work with side gig hustles, and watching rent climb faster than your wages? Are you content with the growing number of unhoused Angelenos and the criminalization of poverty? Are you pleased by the prioritization of gridlock-producing, people (and city) killing private automobiles over effective, efficient, sustainable active and modern mass transit? Does it gladden you that, after decades of improvements in air quality, you find yourself coughing and getting ill more often than you used to?\n\nIf your answer is “yes,” to all of the above — then you should vote for the incumbents because by all indications they will continue the direction in which we’re moving. That’s what the Los Angeles Times editorial board endorsed. I’m honestly baffled by their logic. Perhaps they’re consoled by the current government’s penchant for progressive speech so much that they don’t notice that we’re not just maintaining the status quo but actively sliding backwards. If not, you should, in the words of an angry Joe Biden, “go vote for someone else.”\n\nChances are you don’t vote in local elections. You should. You have MUCH more power to effect change at a local level than you do at a national one. Our president, after all, is not elected by you but rather by 538 electors — none of whom you know. I don’t blame you. It’s often difficult to get to a polling place on election day whilst the polls are still open and the local media would forever prefer to focus their attention on slebs (they’re slebs), sports (some teams won, some teams lost), traffic (it’s bad), and weather (it’s probably sunny and hotter than it was last year).\n\nThis year is different. It’s the first year that city elections will take place on the same day as the general elections. Most Angelenos are registered Democrats and many vote for incumbents because they are nearly always themselves Democrats and they vote straight party. However, those running against them this time are nearly all Democrats and in nearly every case, grass roots p"
