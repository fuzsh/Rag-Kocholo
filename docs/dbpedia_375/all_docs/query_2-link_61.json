        "text": "Sea Galley has been a staple restaurant in the Yakima Valley for several years. Once a chain, the Sea Galley on South First in Union Gap was the final location and, after a couple of weeks, there will be no more.\n\nSea Galley's official Facebook page announced October 1st will be the final day for Sea Galley to be open for crab legs, sea food platters, prime rib and the biggest and best mozzarella sticks in town.\n\nNot to mention their drinks in the cocktail lounge.\n\nMany people in Yakima have a lot of fond memories about Sea Galley starting with the classic song from their commercials.\n\nOn a personal note, I have fond memories hosting an oyster shooting contest in the cocktail lounge back in 2002. I'm glad all I had to do was announce because the contestants were making a terrible mess. It was fun to do, though. I know I had fun.\n\nLater in life Sea Galley became a favorite place for my kids because, as they stated, it looked like the inside of a pirate ship. I mean, any ship would do, but they had a fondness for pirates after watching Pirates of the Caribbean so it was fun for them and, again, those gigantic mozzarella sticks are insanely amazing. That would always be a must-get every time we visited.\n\nI'll be sad to see them go. Make sure you show your support before they're gone for good.\n\n\"[carbongallery id=\"\"6502391023abb67cc307371f\"\"]\n\n\"\n\n'90s Toys That Spark Instant Childhood Memories\n\nThis '90s nostalgia is sure to make you feel like a kid again.\n\nLOOK: Do you know these iconic quotes from '70s TV shows\n\nStacker looked through the vast array of groundbreaking 1970s television and identified 25 of its most iconic (and most memorable) quotes.\n\nLOOK: Popular fashion trends from the year you were born\n\nLeg warmers, pillbox hats, and overalls are a few of the most memorable fashion trends over the last 100 years.
