Craig\n\n55\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis book had its genesis in the summer of 2016. One of the rising senior English majors at Virginia Wesleyan, Justin FitzGerald, had submitted a proposal that spring to write his senior thesis that fall on American Psycho, and I was rereading the novel in preparation for serving as the second reader for Justin’s project. Rereading American Psycho reminded me of just how often that novel invokes Donald Trump as a signifier of the excesses of the 1980s, and as Patrick Bateman’s idol. Excited, I wrote to Justin and suggested that his thesis might address Trump’s role in the novel in terms of the 2016 presidential campaign. Sensibly, Justin stuck with his own plans for his thesis, though he did kindly add a few words on Trump, both in the thesis itself and in his presentation at our department’s senior conference that December. So, the first person I must thank is Justin FitzGerald. Gavin Pate, my colleague in the Virginia Wesleyan English Department, was the primary advisor for Justin’s thesis, and much of the initial conception of this project was hashed out in conversation with Gavin. Leslie Caughell, Kellie Holzer, and Kathy Merlock Jackson, fellow members of the Virginia Wesleyan faculty, provided valuable help at key stages of the project. I owe particular thanks to Stephen Leist, interlibrary loan coordinator at Virginia Wesleyan, for his work assembling sources. Earlier versions of several of the essays in this collection were presented at the 2018 Northeast Modern Language Association convention in Pittsburgh, so this project owes a debt to NeMLA for providing a venue for that scholarship. Thanks also to Richard Schumaker and Chris McComb for their work spearheading Trump scholarship at NeMLA. I am deeply grateful to the contributors to this volume, for the quality of their work and for their gracious responses to my editorial requests. I could not have asked for a better group to work with. ix\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nJudith Lakamper at Lexington Books has been a wonderful editor to work with, and I am indebted to her for her guidance of this project from my initial inquiry through publication. Along with Judith, assistant editor Shelby Russell offered tremendous help as the project came to fruition. Finally, as always, my greatest thanks and appreciation go to my wife, Dawn Richardson, for her endless patience and understanding when it came to the time and attention this project required.\n\nIntroduction Reading Trump Stephen Hock\n\nIn his essay “The Year in Trump Novel Pitches: An Agent’s Lament,” Erik Hane (2018) notes a curious phenomenon of his experience as a literary agent in 2017, namely, “an overwhelming number of aspiring novelists started writing about Trump.” What his essay does not mention, however, is that novelists, screenwriters, cartoonists, and other writers (and not just aspiring ones) had been writing about Donald Trump for years before he became the forty-fifth president of the United States, often in terms that uncannily prefigure the discourse that has since grown to surround his presidency. This unexplored history is, in one sense, unsurprising. After all, Trump was a public figure long before he became president of the United States, one who became familiar to American audiences through his appearances in a wide variety of media over a period of several decades, so it is only natural that depictions of or references to Trump turn up in any number of cultural artifacts that predate his presidency.1 In this respect, as in so many others, Trump differs radically from many of his predecessors as president. Barack Obama, for instance, does not feature as an object of hero worship for the protagonist of any novel published twenty-five years before he was elected president, as Trump does for Patrick Bateman in Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho (1991). Moreover, Trump himself has obviously long recognized the power of texts of various stripes to cultivate his persona in the body politic, and has sold an image of himself in a multitude of branded productions that have identified him as their author or producer, ranging from books such as Trump: The Art of the Deal (1987) to his reality TV Apprentice franchise (2004–2015). Many of these productions devote themselves to establishing not only the personal brand of Donald Trump but also the brand of the Trump family, a practice that the other members of his family have likewise taken up. As Arwa Mahdawi (2018) observes in a piece for The Guardian 1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\non Donald Trump Jr.’s proposal to write a book of his own, “The man hails from a famously literary family. His father has ‘written’ almost 20 books. His sister, Ivanka, has published two. Ivana, Donald Jr’s mother, released a memoir in 2017. Even Eric has been published; he wrote the foreword to Newt Gingrich’s book Understanding Trump, which came out last year. Donald Jr, it would seem, is the Branwell Brontë of the Trump clan.” Donald Trump père has even tried his hand at Broadway, claiming a producer’s credit for putting up half the money to stage a production of the (admittedly Trump-content-free) play Paris Is Out! in 1970, entering into discussions to turn The Apprentice into a Broadway musical in 2005, and exploring the idea of “producing a revue, using songs from the Irving Berlin catalog, with ‘The Trump Follies’ as the working title” in 2007 (Paulson 2016). At each stage, self-aggrandizement, blurring if not demolishing the line between fact and fiction, has been a hallmark of Trump the impresario, culminating in a presidential administration that has come to resemble a reality TV series. As Amy Chozick (2018) writes for the New York Times, “Flip comparisons of Mr. Trump’s White House and his years on ‘The Apprentice’ abound, but behind the ‘You’re fired!’ jokes is a serious case study in mass viewing habits and a president who has made up for his lack of experience in governing with an uncanny grasp of must-see TV.” This experience with self-promotion that turns his life into a fiction and a spectacle has, obviously, served Trump well in his political career.2 As Trump’s political career has grown, so, too, has academic attention to Trump from scholars of language, literature, and culture, and apropos of Chozick’s description of Trump’s presidency as “a serious case study” of political persuasion through the logic and rhetoric of television, the nascent body of academic work on Trump has often focused on studying Trump’s rhetoric.3 Such studies of Trump’s fashioning of his rhetorical appeals constitute the first major branch of Trump cultural studies scholarship that has emerged to date. The second branch of cultural analysis of Trump focuses on reading—or, frequently, rereading—texts “in the age of Trump.” The earliest published example of this mode of scholarship that I have been able to identify is Michael Dowdy’s (2016) “Ascendance and Abjection: Reading Latina/o Poetry in the Summer of Trump.” Published in an issue of the American Poetry Review dated September/October 2016, the essay’s very title conjures a moment when it might have been possible to imagine that the country was experiencing a mere “summer of Trump.” In the essay itself, however, Dowdy offers a pointed reflection on the longer history that term obscures: “‘The Summer of Trump’ was meant to denote a season that passes. In the U.S., however, it has been an endless summer, from early-nineteenth century dreams of Latino autonomy in what is now Texas to the undocumented\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\n‘Dreamers’ seeking the right to pursue college educations free of the fear of deportation” (7). With this, Dowdy gives an early statement of what will become one of the key refrains of academic studies of Trump, namely, the degree to which Trump must be understood within larger cultural, historical, and political contexts. As Yogita Goyal (2017) will later put it, “It is . . . crucial to not treat Trump as an exception rather than the culmination and continuation of previous policies by democrats and republicans alike. . . . The reminder to think not just about Trump the man but Trumpism as a product of history remains valuable” (471). In reminding us of that longer history that Trumpism is a product of, Dowdy’s essay likewise anticipates how quickly analysis will turn from “the summer of Trump” to broader framing that evokes “the age of Trump.” Indeed, Dowdy’s readers in the fall of 2016 had already experienced not one but two “summers of Trump,” as his essay reminds them by opening with a reading of Trump’s expulsion of journalist Jorge Ramos from a press conference in August 2015 (7).4 Following Dowdy, a number of critics have taken up reading texts “in the age of Trump,” likewise following Goyal’s “reminder to think not just about Trump the man but Trumpism as a product of history,” drawing out elements of earlier texts that come to new light “in the age of Trump.” Notably, Joseph Valente’s (2018) “Reading Joyce in the Age of Trump” bears a title that marks the recognition that Trump’s era has lengthened from a “summer” to an “age.” This branch of Trump scholarship likewise shows every sign of continuing to flourish through many more “summers of Trump.”5 Another early scholarly work that touches on Trump, James I. Deutsch’s (2017) “Folklore, Politics, and Fake News in the Reception of Rogue One,” serves as a hinge text that connects this second branch of Trump scholarship with the third. Deutsch begins with “one of the more bizarre but intriguing rumors related to the United States presidency in 2016,” namely, “that the makers of the film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) had rewritten and reshot scenes to make it seem explicitly opposed to the policies and personality of President-elect Donald J. Trump” (109). Deutsch proceeds to offer what, for my purposes, constitutes a meta-analysis: not a reading of a text in light of Trump but rather a reading of a popular reading of a text in light of Trump. In tracing the spread of the rumor that Rogue One had been rewritten in response to Trump, Deutsch implicitly points to the expectation that the culture will address Trump: in a time when our politics is cultural, we take it for granted that the products of our culture will likewise be political. Hence, the third (and, for purposes of the present study, final, though there are surely more to come) branch of Trump scholarship in literary and cultural studies, namely, scholarship that focuses on texts that address themselves to Trump, whether more or less directly. Victoria McCollum’s forthcoming (as\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nof this writing) anthology Make America Hate Again: Trump-Era Horror and the Politics of Fear might serve as a foundational example of this mode of scholarship, moving from rereading earlier texts anew in light of “the age of Trump” to reading texts that are themselves products of—and, implicitly or explicitly, written in response to—“the era of Trump.” The present anthology focuses on a particular subset of these texts: not just texts that take up issues pertinent to “the age of Trump,” but rather texts that directly depict or refer to Trump, texts in which Trump, specifically, figures as a signifier. This category of texts includes both those earlier works, like American Psycho, that took up Trump the public figure before his successful presidential campaign and the “Trump novels” that have begun to appear in the wake of Trump’s election, the proliferation of which Hane laments. The contention of the present volume, however, is that such works of what I am terming “Trump fiction” can open up new avenues for understanding not just (or even necessarily primarily) Trump himself, but rather those larger cultural, historical, and political structures ordering life in the United States, of which Trump stands as an effect, in which he is a willing participant, and for which he functions in these texts as a figure.6 In describing these texts as “Trump fiction,” I do not mean to refer narrowly to fiction as a genre that would exclude, for instance, poetry. Rather, I use the term “fiction” more broadly, drawing on the roots of the term in the Latin fingĕre, meaning “to fashion or form” (Oxford English Dictionary Online [1989] n.d.). Fiction, in this broader sense, comprises a range of textual fashionings and formations, whether prose narrative, poetry, visual art, or other modes. My aim in referring to these collectively as “Trump fiction” is to draw attention to the “fictional” as a category whose distinctiveness from the “nonfictional” the discourse surrounding Trump continues to erode. For example, after an investigation into available tax records from 1985 to 1994 by New York Times reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig (2019) showed that “year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer,” Tony Schwartz, Trump’s ghostwriter on the ostensibly nonfiction book The Art of the Deal, tweeted, “Given the Times report on Trump’s staggering losses, I’d be fine if Random House simply took the book out of print. Or recategorized it as fiction” (2019). Schwartz’s tweet reminds us that Trump’s presentation of himself has always relied on fictions. This phenomenon has in turn been recognized as a key element of the present “post-truth” climate that, as several of the contributors to this volume note, poses challenges to both writers and readers of fiction (broadly defined). As such, Trump fiction prompts the work of thinking through the questions that Trump and the larger structures for which he serves as a figure pose for the very work of fashioning and forming texts of all stripes.7\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\n“IF THE DONALD EVER BECOMES PRESIDENT” As noted above, a number of works of Trump fiction, like Ellis’s American Psycho, predate Trump’s successful presidential campaign. These texts offer a range of models of Trump fiction, both for their own time (what in retrospect can be read as the cultural prehistory of President Trump) and for our own “age of Trump.” Robert Crumb’s 1989 five-page comic book story “Point the Finger,” for instance, originally published in the third issue of Hup, directly targets Trump, but, in its focus on Trump the personality, falls into an ahistorical Trumpian logic of misogyny. In doing so, this text demonstrates the dangers of forgetting Goyal’s “reminder to think not just about Trump the man but Trumpism as a product of history.” The narration in the first panel of Crumb’s story seems to set the stage for a broader consideration of Trump’s role in American life, intoning, “now it’s time to shake our fist at the injustices of the system” (“‘Point the Finger’: R. Crumb Takes on Donald Trump” [1989] 2016).8 Discussion of “the system” quickly drops out of the story, however, as Crumb himself appears in the second panel, speaking directly to the reader, to introduce the “crass and venal character [who] is so arrogant he seeks out the spotlight and publicly boasts of his disgusting exploits” that the story will “point the finger” at. Questions of “the system” are immediately reframed in terms of personal “character” and morality, and the absence of any discussion of Trump’s place within the larger American culture persists throughout the story. Trump is dragged into the story in its fourth panel by Tracy and Marny, a pair of women allied with Crumb in his efforts to take down Trump, but Crumb can barely begin to “point the finger” at Trump before Trump fires back, literally pointing his own finger at Crumb and dismissing Crumb as “poisoned by jealousy for anyone who’s successful and attractive to women” in the third panel of the story’s second page. Over the remainder of the story’s second page and into its third, Trump charms the two women, offering to fly them to “a humongous banquet” at Mar-a-Lago that he describes with such decadence that Crumb sputters, “You’re—you’re Trimalchio from Petronius’s ‘Satyricon’!!” As Trump leaves with his arms around Tracy and Marny, Crumb is left to stew not just in his own personal impotence but rather an impotence reframed as unchanging fact. “It’s just like th’ fuckin’ Roman Empire! Nothing’s changed in 2,000 years,” he mutters, effacing any historical specificity to Trump’s position, as well as any possibility of agency that could effect change. A glimmer of the larger social context in which Trump operates appears in the final panel of the story’s third page, where a defeated, slumping Crumb is surrounded by a pair of policemen, guns drawn and pointed at him, shouting, “Freeze!!” and “You gonna come along quietly?!?” The appearance of the police here, allied with Trump and prepared to punish his enemies, resonates\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nwith the advertisement headed “Bring Back the Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!” that Trump took out the same year this story was published, as part of his involvement in the case of the Central Park Five (Laughland 2016).9 That hint of context is quickly obliterated, however, as the story’s fourth and fifth pages metafictionally reset the narrative with a “new ending,” granting Crumb a revenge that sees Tracy and Marny giving Trump a swirly at Crumb’s command, a humiliated Trump crying his way out of the story, and the two women indulging Crumb’s sexual fantasies, even as Crumb confides, “th’ first ending was more realistic.” Realistic, maybe, but not meaningfully so: Trump’s wealth and power come across as products of his sheer personal magnetism. Crumb does mention on the story’s final page that his “irreverent” comics work gets “ice[d] . . . out of th’ market place,” but there is no attempt to situate Trump’s position within that market, and the story devolves into a sexual competition between two men, in which the women appear to have no agency of their own. This is not a terribly surprising result for a Crumb comic,10 but more disturbing is the degree to which the story’s narrative logic fits with Trump’s own self-fashioning. This, then, is one of the dangers in crafting Trump fiction: the possibility that, in focusing on Trump, the text will fall into the trap of playing by Trump’s rules, a mug’s game if ever there was one. As Hane (2018) argues in his lament over the onslaught of Trump novel pitches, “It is one of fascism’s goals to monopolize our attention. It would like to shrink our imagination; it would like for us to peer wide-eyed at its harsh restrictions and be able to think of nothing else.”11 In fact, surveying the works of Trump fiction that appeared before Trump’s presidency suggests that it is not the works where Trump occupies a central role that resonate the most productively with our present “age of Trump,” but rather those where Trump’s position in the text is more marginal or even tangential, allowing room to avoid a blinding focus on Trump the individual and instead do the contextualizing and historicizing work that Goyal calls for. For works that predate Trump’s presidency, that context is amplified by the irony of historical perspective, namely, the fact that the texts’ references to Trump are resignified by our knowledge of Trump’s presidency. Trump’s presence in such texts functions as a kind of Barthesian punctum, “that accident which pricks me” (Barthes 1981, 27). Such might be the case with, for instance, Ari Bach’s Valhalla (2014), a young adult dystopian novel set in the early twenty-third century that includes a scene in which one character, a would-be theocrat, makes a passing reference to Trump in a discourse on the history of the Inquisition: “‘Its CEO, Thomas De Torquemada, was a true genius of the era. Centuries before Trump’—he genuflected—‘Thomas established systems that made use of any means to seek out people who didn’t believe or didn’t comply’” (276). Bach is, to be sure, painting in broad historical strokes (though not as broad as Crumb’s), but this text offers an intriguing gesture of\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nplacing Trump within a lineage of repressive ideologies, one that resonates within Valhalla’s LGBTQ+ context, and, apropos of the punctum, pricks us with our knowledge of the path Trump’s career has taken since the novel’s publication. As Bach (n.d., ca. 2016) wrote in a blog post in response to a reader who brought up this passage, I’m actually sort of sad that Trump is now known for his political debacle. That line was written in 2005 when Trump was best known for going bankrupt over and over again but still somehow being incredibly rich. So the joke is that the religiously corporate future of 2230 sees him as a holy figure. But I have no clue how that joke will read after this, now that he’ll be known for egregious racism and general political debacle. I guess we’ll find out.\n\nTrump’s presence in the text, “this wound, this prick,” as Barthes notes of the punctum, “also bruises me, is poignant to me” (1981, 26, 27).12 This quality of the punctum can pertain even to works of Trump fiction that foreground Trump, even works of Trump fiction authorized by Trump himself. Jeffrey Robinson’s novel Trump Tower (2012) follows the lives of various residents and members of the staff of Trump Tower, and Trump is mentioned throughout the novel, though his role in the narrative is mostly limited to emailing a few directives to his staff. Todd Van Luling (2016) notes that Trump Tower was originally announced as a novel by Trump himself, though by the time the novel was actually published, Robinson was listed as the sole author. Van Luling suggests that the novel may have grown out of Trump’s (as yet) unrealized plans for a television series set in Trump Tower: Trump has worked on a “Trump Tower” project since at least the late 1990s, when he tried to make it a television show. “We hired a writer out of Los Angeles and developed a pilot with Showtime,” Bob Frederick of the Canadian production company MVP Entertainment explained to HuffPost. “And Donald was happy with it because it was more of a ‘Dallas,’ ‘Dynasty,’ ‘Upstairs, Downstairs,’ kind of concept. And although he had no creative say in the series, we did write him a check for his rights.”\n\nIndeed, the novel reads like a novelization of the first season of a nighttime soap opera in the Trump style, filled as it is with sexual hijinks, misogyny, scenes of high-end luxury, and reams of celebrity cameos. A little over halfway through the novel, one such celebrity caps off a joking exchange about lying about golf handicaps with a quip about Trump: “Yeah, well . . . if The Donald ever becomes president, he’ll claim to play to fifteen. It’s what we do” (Robinson 2012, 238). The uncanny prick of the punctum is only enhanced by the fact that the celebrity who makes this joke is Bill Clinton.13\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\n“YOU DIDN’T MENTION TRUMP BY NAME ONCE, BUT THAT’S WHAT THE CLASS WAS ABOUT” The more productive works of Trump fiction open fissures, like these punctum moments, through which the texts can speak to the larger contexts of Trumpism. This is true not only of the Trump fiction that predates Trump’s presidency but also of the Trump fiction that has appeared since his election. By way of a counterexample, consider Gary Shteyngart’s Lake Success (2018). Gareth Watkins (2019) suggests that “Trump is evoked enough in Gary Shteyngart’s Lake Success that he ought to feel integral to the book, and yet nothing of substance is ever said about him,” largely because the novel is narrated by a character, Barry Cohen, who obstinately refuses the work of contextualizing and historicizing.14 The portrait the novel sketches of Barry’s vapid self-absorption may hold more value when it comes to examining the United States “in the age of Trump” than Watkins acknowledges, but his point that the novel’s references to Trump are out of proportion to its insights is well taken: it would be better to lance the text with a punctum that could open up a more engaged treatment of Trump and Trumpism. That said, the novel does offer one moment that gestures toward its position as a Trump fiction manqué. After sitting in on a lecture that his old girlfriend Layla Hayes, a college professor, gives to her class on the Holocaust, Barry can think only of sex, and, in an attempt at seduction, gives Layla what he thinks is a compliment, “‘Look, I thought you were amazing as a teacher,’ he said, once they were lying in bed. ‘You didn’t mention Trump by name once, but that’s what the class was about’” (Shteyngart 2018, 238). This formula surely offers a better model than Lake Success’s mode of mentioning Trump by name repeatedly, but, as Watkins has it, saying nothing. Even more productive, though, would be a model of Trump fiction that mentions Trump in order to say something more: not texts that don’t mention Trump but are about him, but rather texts that mention him as an avenue to address the contexts of Trumpism. Such texts might open up possibilities for agency and action more meaningful than Barry’s performance of a midlife crisis against the backdrop of the 2016 presidential election. The poems collected in Resistance, Rebellion, Life: 50 Poems Now, edited by Amit Majmudar (2017), for instance, collectively frame their resistance to Trump within a number of political contexts, even as the majority of the poems do not mention Trump by name. So, a poem like Eduardo C. Corral’s (2017) “Border Patrol Agent,” which ends, “Sometimes only body parts remain. / They’re buried / in baby caskets” (lines 48–50), insists on bluntly showing the consequences of the xenophobic strain of American politics that Trump has tapped into. Corral’s poem then resonates with the treatment of the Syrian refugee crisis in A. E. Stallings’s (2017) “Aegean Blues” from her\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nlarger “Refugee Fugue,” which asks, “Why would a kid lie in the sand, and not take off his shoes? / Why would he lie there face down, the color of a bruise?” (lines 16–17).15 The notes on contributors at the end of Resistance, Rebellion, Life frame Stallings’s poem in the context of activism: “She has been active volunteering in Athens with the refugee crisis in Greece since November 2015” (Majmudar 2017, 104). The title of another poem in the collection, Cody Walker’s (2017a) “Sitting on a Sofa in a 1925 Bungalow in Ann Arbor, Michigan,” suggests a less obviously engaged posture, but turns that fact back on its speaker, as its final line reads, “I have wasted my life” (line 13). Walker’s poem also appears in his chapbook The Trumpiad (2017b),16 which appears to want to redress that waste, as, in lieu of an epigraph or dedication, it begins with a notice that “all proceeds from this book will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union.” A model of poetry as activism likewise underlies the anthology Resist Much/Obey Little: Inaugural Poems to the Resistance (Boughn et al. 2017), whose cover announces, “50% of proceeds donated to Planned Parenthood.” This collection is similar to Resistance, Rebellion, Life, only much larger, running over 700 pages in length. Its poems, too, situate Trump and Trumpism within a range of discourses and contexts, even as most of them do not mention Trump by name. One that does is Luis J. Rodriguez’s “Same Morning in America” (2017), which, as its title suggests, presents Trump as only the latest in a lineage that includes Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. Ultimately, however, the “Same” of the poem’s title yields, in its final lines, to a call to action that includes lines such as “Let’s trump Trump with class knowledge,” “Let’s trump Trump with unity,” and “Let’s trump Trump with organization” (lines 65, 70, 71), the anaphora emphasizing not only the continuity of Trump with the history of the United States but also the ongoingness of the work of resistance. Donald Trump would surely reject the picture that is painted by these and the many other resistant works of Trump fiction that have already appeared. Nonetheless, new works of Trump fiction appear on a regular basis, and will just as surely continue to appear as “the age of Trump” continues to unspool. As such, the present volume can only begin to address the emerging cultural response to Trump and Trumpism. The essays collected here likewise demonstrate a commitment to taking Trump as only the starting point of investigations into the cultural contexts out of which Trumpism grows, and into which it feeds. The essays in this collection are organized into two parts. Part I, “The Cultural Prehistory of President Trump,” examines treatments of Trump in literature, film, and television from the years before his successful presidential campaign. Rereading those texts in “the age of Trump” offers the\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nuncanny recognition that Trump has long figured in the discourses of racialized violence, paranoid conspiracy theories, and xenophobic nationalism that have since become central to discussions of his presidency, and shows how these texts both critique and reify Trump’s self-presentation as an avatar of masculine power, neoliberalism, gentrification, and white privilege. The first four essays in part I focus on the most prominent work of Trump fiction published before Trump’s turn to a political career, Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho. David Markus’s essay begins by going back to Trump’s emergence in the public eye in the early 1980s and reading closely the way Trump Tower was marketed to prospective residents, in order to develop a theorization of Trumpspace as a construction common to Trump’s work in real estate and to his political career. Drawing on the work of Giorgio Agamben, Markus demonstrates how Trumpspace reflects and drives “the fantasies governing the supposedly ‘normal’ lives of the professional-managerial class under late capitalism,” including American Psycho’s protagonist, Patrick Bateman. Caitlin R. Duffy investigates Trump as a father figure not only to American Psycho’s Patrick Bateman but, more broadly, to two generations of supporters, both the yuppies of the 1980s and the alt-right of the 2010s. Duffy’s reading of Trump’s “daddy power” examines two key features of that power, “the activation of privatized violence and surface-level masks,” that recur throughout American Psycho and Trump’s political career. These elements of Trump’s power, Duffy argues, are crucial to understanding Trump’s appeal not only to upper-class men like Bateman but also to the white working-class men and women who have joined “the cult of Trump.” In line with Duffy’s argument that “the activation of privatized violence and surface-level masks” is key to Trump’s power, Clinton J. Craig offers a close reading of scenes of Patrick Bateman’s violence in American Psycho, informed by both Lacanian psychoanalysis and the reader-response theory of Norman Holland, to show how that violence is wrapped up in a “fixation on surface, the outward appearance of things which can be most easily recognized through branding.” As Craig demonstrates, this dynamic governing Bateman’s violence informs fantasies of not just the self but also the nation, as in the case of the Trumpian “United States of Make America Great Again.” William Magrino wraps up the collection’s consideration of American Psycho with a reflection on the swirl of commodity fetishism and celebrity culture at work in Ellis’s treatment of Trump. Drawing out the ways in which the rise of Trump to the presidency casts a new light on the existing critical discussion of Ellis, Magrino demonstrates how American Psycho’s “positioning the ubiquitous image of Trump alongside reports of violence emphasizes Bateman’s fetishistic impulses” and highlights the degree to which that violence is an inherent part of the consumer culture in which Bateman lives.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nMoving to other works of Trump fiction, my essay reads Amy Waldman’s The Submission (2011) as a novel whose portrait of American politics and culture following the September 11 attacks revolves around a series of discourses (Islamophobia, anti-immigrant xenophobia, politics as media spectacle, and a white working-class resentment of liberal elites that is often figured in gendered terms) that will come to shape discussion of Trump’s political career. I read Trump’s presence in The Submission, in a roman-à-clef-style cameo based on the real-world Trump’s offer to buy the site of the so-called Ground Zero Mosque, to link the novel’s concern with memorialization to Trump’s infamous weighing-in on the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Further exploring texts that function both as 9/11 fiction and as Trump fiction, Joseph M. Conte builds on the references to Trump in Thomas Pynchon’s Bleeding Edge (2013) to show how that novel anticipates Trump’s America. Pynchon’s characteristic paranoid mode, in Conte’s reading, serves as an apt foundation for a reflection on the means by which “paranoid conspiracy has been injected into mainstream culture—as the poison of controlled demolition, a forged birth certificate, crisis actors, and the Deep State—with the syringe now wielded by a president who acts as Conspirator-in-Chief.” At the same time, however, Conte argues that Pynchon offers a vision of paranoia as a more productive search for truth that remains particularly apt in our era of “fake news.” William G. Welty likewise examines Bleeding Edge, to show how its references to Trump, when considered in light of Pynchon’s treatment of Richard Nixon in Gravity’s Rainbow (1973), can “shift how we think about the post45 period: not only post-1945, but also post-Trump, president #45.” Ultimately, by demonstrating “that we can’t do literary history without attending to the ways fiction theorizes and portrays the activity of reading,” Welty’s essay leads to a reconsideration of postmodernism not as purely ironic and apolitical but rather in terms of its political engagement. Turning from the literary to examine depictions of Trump in film and television, Ashleigh Hardin examines a range of Trump’s film and TV cameos, spanning the years from 1990 through 2004, to trace their depictions of Trump from beneficent to villainous. Hardin argues that, “in the relative incoherency of his star persona and in the anti-narrativizing tendency of the cameo as vehicle, the outline of Trump’s candidacy and presidency becomes legible.” Ultimately, Hardin argues, examination of Trump’s cameos, including those that were cut from the films in which they were supposed to appear, suggests the degree to which Trump’s rise to power was fueled by a complicit popular culture. Peter Kragh Jensen focuses on Trump’s 1994 cameo appearance in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, in which he appears as a potential buyer for the\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nBanks family home. Drawing on Nell Irvin Painter’s analysis of the role Trump’s whiteness played in his presidential campaign, Jensen argues that Trump’s Fresh Prince cameo exemplifies the ways in which “Trump’s star persona has been constructed in a manner that casts him as a member of a benign, pseudo-royal white elite, both with respect to his appearances with black actors and in terms of an aesthetic tradition that presupposes the global centrality of the European/American white male.” Jensen then turns to the opening sequence of The Celebrity Apprentice to demonstrate how it reinforces that persona, framing Trump as the dominant figure of the entire urban landscape of New York City. Susan Gilmore concludes part I of this collection with an examination of Sesame Street’s parody of Trump, Ronald/Donald Grump, who has appeared three times in the show’s history. Gilmore analyzes Sesame Street’s parodic depiction of Grump in the context of the program’s pedagogical mission, particularly in comparison to the “celebratory” approach taken by Joanne Mattern’s biography of Trump for Scholastic’s Rookie Biographies Series. Each time Grump appears on Sesame Street, he challenges the values that the program aims to nurture in its young viewers, ultimately leading to lessons in how to “contend with seemingly unmitigable executive power.” The essays in part II of this collection, “Trumpocalypse Now,” examine works that have appeared during Trump’s presidency, to detail the emerging cultural response to the full-blown Trump phenomenon. The texts that these essays examine offer reflections on a range of crises, including the devolution of American politics, Trump’s marginalization of the LGBTQ+ community, and the threat of war. At the same time, these essays collectively demonstrate the need for new modes of fiction that can more fully engage the contemporary post-truth moment. This part begins with Tim Lanzendörfer’s reading of Howard Jacobson’s Pussy (2017) as a text that, in offering an imprecise allegory of Trump and the cast of characters surrounding his political rise, “reflects, too, on the allegorical mode itself.” Lanzendörfer argues that Pussy’s position in the literary marketplace as a literary hot take responding to Trump’s presidency is fundamental to its allegorical quality, rendering it “an accidental allegory: an allegory whose full force stems from what we may suggest is the fundamentally rushed working through that it provides.” Related to the questions of allegory that Lanzendörfer addresses, questions of the efficacy of satire as a response to Trumpism emerge in Bruce Krajewski’s reading of Mark Doten’s Trump Sky Alpha (2019), for instance, in the novel’s treatment of internet humor and in Doten’s precise mimicry of Trump’s presentation of himself on social media. Krajewski argues that\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nTrump Sky Alpha suggests “a way satire can offer more than an all-or-nothing prospect, either a form of performance able to shame politicians into conformity or a delusional and futile, if entertaining, exercise in significant political reform” insofar as it “expands the audience that should be fed up, that wants its hate to energize change before Trump’s hate achieves its goals.” Steven Rosendale and Laura Gray-Rosendale argue that, by contrast, the first season of the satirical television program Our Cartoon President (2018) “does the president’s work for him.” Our Cartoon President seems to mount a harsh critique of Trump, characteristic of Juvenalian satire. However, the satire slides into over-the-top caricatures, and even winds up humanizing Trump and his family in a way that yields a gentler Horatian satire. As such, Our Cartoon President “may perform a task that the real Trump seems to be unable to accomplish—to lessen by some increment the outrage of those opposed to him.” Meredith James examines a more productive treatment of Trump on television, reading the first season of Pose (2018) in terms of its juxtaposition of 1980s-vintage Trump with New York City drag ball culture. James argues that Pose marginalizes Trump’s world as the dangerous other against which the series’ LGBTQ+ protagonists attempt to carve out lives that affirm domestic and middle-class values. In doing so, Pose “succeeds in uplifting the communities which Trump is currently vilifying,” as well as in “calling Trump World out as the inauthentic pose that it is.” Shannon Finck examines Olivia Laing’s adoption of the voice and techniques of Kathy Acker in her novel Crudo (2018) as a means of conveying the atmosphere of distraction that arises from social media, particularly the tweets of Donald Trump. Against Trump’s mode of engaging with the world through Twitter, Laing’s novel, in Finck’s reading, affirms a politics grounded in an Ackerian “deliberate engagement with a diverse range of texts” that “must now be reworked and reworked again to include new and fleeting forms of minutiae—the texts, tweets, and Instagrams through which we attend to the world’s bedlam and its beauty.” Finally, Jaclyn Partyka reads Salman Rushdie’s The Golden House (2017), in its treatment of not one but two fictionalized avatars of Trump, as an attempt to grapple with different modes of realism in the contemporary posttruth moment. Partyka argues that Rushdie’s novel calls its readers to “take into account how discussions of genre and fictionality have become much more significant within a post-truth moment,” to ultimately conclude that “when many of our knowledge institutions seem less reliable as representatives of truth and facts, recognizing fiction for what it is—a way to shape a world—may be one of the best balms for our insecure times,” an especially apt note on which to end this collection’s study of Trump fiction.\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nNOTES 1. That said, it should be remembered that, well before Trump’s ultimately successful 2016 presidential campaign, he teased the possibility of running for president on multiple occasions, beginning as early as 1987, and formally explored running for the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in the 2000 campaign. 2. As Benjamin ([1936] 1969) observed: Radio and film not only affect the function of the professional actor but likewise the function of those who also exhibit themselves before this mechanical equipment, those who govern. Though their tasks may be different, the change affects equally the actor and the ruler. The trend is toward establishing controllable and transferable skills under certain social conditions. This results in a new selection, a selection before the equipment from which the star and the dictator emerge victorious. (247n12) 3. See, for instance, Ivie (2017), Bostdorff (2017), and Johnson (2017). 4. Dowdy’s essay itself first appeared immediately following that first “summer of Trump”: it was originally delivered as a talk at Eastern Illinois University on October 14, 2015 (Dowdy 2016, 12n). 5. For other early examples of this branch of Trump scholarship, see Reza and Nessa (2016), Ward (2018), Martinez (2018), Rose (2018), and Ventura (2018). 6. Previously published examples of this strain of Trump scholarship include Weinhold and Bodkin (2017), Goyal (2017), Wally (2018), and Burlingame (2019). 7. For an example of scholarship on a Trump fiction working primarily in a nonverbal and nonnarrative mode that makes a similar point about “fiction,” see Tony Perucci’s (2018) discussion of Alison Jackson’s staged photographs of a Trump lookalike. “By staging simulation’s deterrence machine,” Perucci argues, “the photos show Trump’s presidency to function as a simulation on the order of Baudrillard’s examples of Disneyland or Watergate. As with those instances, the ‘scandal’ of Trump’s corruption and deception supports the collective delusion that capitalism can produce otherwise” (195), even as Trump’s “‘post-truth’ campaign succeeded by blurring the boundary between the ‘seeming real’ and the ‘in fact a fiction’ because it addressed what Clinton could not: neoliberalism cannot trump the very rage it has produced” (197). 8. The five pages of “Point the Finger” can be read on a variety of websites as of this writing, including the Imgur post cited here. 9. For discussion of Trump’s involvement in the Central Park Five case, see Caitlin Duffy’s chapter in the present volume. 10. As Edward Shannon (2012) notes of Crumb’s work, “Crumb’s experience of gender allows him to assume a privileged position, making clearly misogynist statements” (641), while his work demonstrates that “Crumb rebels against totalitarian power while envying the ability to wield it” (642). Shannon ultimately reads Crumb’s larger body of work more as more politically engaged, concluding, “Crumb’s confessions urge the reader to consider the artist as a survivor not just of his personal demons but of a culture crippled by its own materialism, racism, bigotry, and neuroses” (647), a statement that could likewise apply to “Point the Finger.”\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\n11.

The article features a photograph of Trump, then thirty-four, standing behind a model of Trump Tower (figure 1.1). Architecture has always relied on mythmaking, and this image follows a hallowed convention of depicting the male “genius” architect or doer alongside his creation. It is the same convention highlighted by Paul B. Preciado (2014, 14–16), who takes the similarities between a photograph of Hugh Hefner with an architectural model of the first Playboy Club and images of Le Corbusier in his studio as a jumping-off point for an analysis of the role of Playboy and modern architecture in the production of new forms of masculinity in mid-century America. Preciado argues that, as a case study in heteronormative culture under capitalism, “Playboy is for the contemporary critical thinker what the steam engine and the textile factory were for Karl Marx in the nineteenth century” (2014, 10). Although the scope of the investigation that follows can hardly do justice to the comparison, I would venture that Trumpspace—by which I mean to suggest the vision of dwelling and being-in-the-world promoted by Trump as both a real estate developer and politician—is no less elucidating an object of study for our present neoliberal age than Playboy is for the mid-twentieth century. Architect and writer Michael Sorkin (2016) has written that Trump is Hefner’s “virtual twin” in terms of his relationship to architecture, “leisureoriented consumption,” and women. And it is true that, as the 1970s expired, the form of dwelling that Trump refers to as “super-luxury” (“History: Trump Tower, New York,” n.d.)—one of his many coinages—was in some ways an extension of Hefner’s monumental project. This can be gleaned from a brief side-by-side examination of the marketing language for the 21\n\n22\n\nDavid Markus\n\nFigure 1.1 Trump with Model of Trump Tower Site, 1980.

In both advertisements the residence in question is described, in the first few lines, as catering to the “elegant” and “sophisticated” lifestyles of its would-be inhabitants. Both ads ask their readers to envision themselves arriving home in the evening and\n\nA Truly “Free” Psychopathology\n\n23\n\nenjoying the sparkling views of the city from their exclusive perches. “It is just after dark,” the marketing copy for Playboy’s penthouse apartment reads, “Coming down the hallway, we . . . see the terrace and the winking towers of the city beyond.” The Trump Tower advertisement echoes: “You turn the key and wait a moment before clicking on the light. A quiet moment to take in the view. . . . Thousands of tiny lights are snaking their way through Central Park.” Both ads also describe an array of amenities, while emphasizing the cutting-edge technology behind the various domestic conveniences at their prospective owner’s disposal (“Playboy’s Penthouse Apartment” [1956] 1996, 54–67; “Yap of Luxury” [1982] 2017, 43). Both promise would-be clients the rarefied opportunity—in the famous words of Rem Koolhaas, describing the program of “Manhattanism”—“to live inside fantasy” (1994, 10). Indeed, the most memorable passage from the Trump Tower advertisement is quite explicit in this regard: “Your diamond in the sky. It seems a fantasy. And you are home” (“Yap of Luxury” [1982] 2017, 43). The parallels, however, only extend so far. First of all, the Playboy penthouse was, in Preciado’s terms, a “male electronic boudoir” (2014, 83), which explicitly deployed its numerous apparatuses (a turning cabinet bar, a reclining couch, a bed with headboard-mounted light dimmers) in the service of its owner’s seduction routine. By contrast, the long list of apparatuses on offer at Trump Tower—“Maid service, valet, laundering and dry cleaning, stenographers, interpreters, multilingual secretaries, Telex and other communications equipment, hairdressers, masseuses, limousines, conference rooms”—is geared not toward the production of sexual pleasure, but rather toward the demands of professional life in an increasingly globalizing world (“Yap of Luxury” [1982] 2017, 43). Whereas the Playboy penthouse—for all its outrageously misogynistic underpinnings—was essentially forwardlooking in its conception, a space whose high-tech appliances and futuristic Saarinen-designed furniture were geared toward reshaping the “sexually inexperienced middle-class American male” and producing a “postdomestic” alternative to the single-family suburban home (Preciado 2014, 87, 84), the vision of dwelling offered by Trump Tower is one tinged with nostalgia for a bygone era. The building’s elite aura is derived from its geographic proximity to the former Gilded Age family residences clustered around Fifth Avenue near Central Park. “It’s been fifty years at least since people could actually live at this address,” the Trump Tower advertisement informs us, “They were Astors. And the Whitneys lived just around the corner. And the Vanderbilts across the Street” (“Yap of Luxury” [1982] 2017, 43). Finally, for the Playboy penthouse owner—“a man” who “dreams of his own domain, a place that is exclusively his” (“Playboy’s Penthouse Apartment” [1956] 1996, 56)—exclusivity was linked to privacy and personal space. For the resident of Trump Tower, by contrast, exclusivity means being surrounded\n\n24\n\nDavid Markus\n\nby subordinates and having one’s private life perforated by managerial considerations: “You approach the residential entrance—an entrance totally inaccessible to the public—and your staff awaits your arrival. Your concierge gives you your messages. . . . Your elevator man sees you home” (“Yap of Luxury” [1982] 2017, 43). Obviously, many of these differences are owing to the singular nature of the Playboy enterprise, which emerged from a specific sociohistorical configuration within the postwar United States. There’s nothing surprising about the lack of reference to specially designed seduction apparatuses in the marketing copy for Trump Tower. What is perhaps noteworthy, however, is the way in which the Trump advertisement breathlessly reiterates Playboy’s language of seduction in unveiling for us a dream home that seems designed for those with little time to dream of anything beyond their next business appointment: “If you can think of any amenity, any extravagance or nicety of life, any service that we haven’t mentioned, then it probably hasn’t been invented yet” (“Yap of Luxury” [1982] 2017, 43). Stenographers? Telex? Multilingual secretaries? As a high-tech bachelor pad disguised as an office, the Playboy penthouse already aimed at a new intimacy between work and leisure. Yet it emphatically privileged sexual conquest as the sine qua non of male sovereignty. Trump Tower, which, one assumes, was not designed exclusively with male consumers in mind, reflects the outright dissolution of boundaries between the private and professional spheres, and the ascent, in the neoliberal era, of a new constellation of desire and self-affirmation, one inextricable from the possibility of attaining stratospheric, Vanderbiltian, levels of wealth. With the right address and job title comes access to not only the latest array of cutting-edge business and consumer technology but an empowering sense of exclusivity, entitlement, and autonomy. As we will see, this can very easily open onto forms of living “inside fantasy” in contrast to which the mid-century Playboy lifestyle seems charmingly innocent. Trumpspace, as it figures in the remarks that follow, exemplifies two salient aspects of neoliberal culture: its constrictive hyperprofessionalism, on the one hand, and its obscene fantasies of unrestrained excess on the other. It is, I propose, a privileged arena within which to observe how these two seemingly contradictory tendencies overlap and become indistinguishable. Among the numerous commentators to have considered the significance of Trumpbranded real estate in the wake of the 2016 election is artist and writer Liam Gillick (2016), who discusses the architectural vernacular of Trump Tower within the context of mid-1970s and early 1980s postmodernism, among other aesthetic regimes. In this essay, I follow Gillick in returning to some of Fredric Jameson’s (1991) seminal insights into postmodernism, arguing for their newfound relevance in the era of Trump’s presidency. Prompted by an allusion in Gillick’s text to J. G. Ballard’s High-Rise ([1975] 2012),\n\nA Truly “Free” Psychopathology\n\n25\n\nI then turn to a brief analysis of how the exclusive dwelling space figures, in Ballard’s novel, as a prototype for Trumpspace. I conclude with a discussion of Trump’s shadowy presence within Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho (1991). As a paradigmatic figure within the period Ellis describes, a period that saw the rise, in New York City and elsewhere, of what Samuel Stein (2019) calls “the real estate state,” Trump was instrumental, I suggest, in affirming the relationship between the exclusive dwelling space and a pathological conception of individual freedom that continues to haunt the American psyche. ALWAYS ON “A Building on Fifth Avenue” is how Gillick (2016) refers to Trump Tower, highlighting not only the surprising mundaneness of this structure freighted with so much symbolic weight but also the manner in which it “takes its place politely within the existing power structure” despite its supposed “bad taste.” Gillick likens the building to the Bonaventura Hotel analyzed by Fredric Jameson (1991) in his classic account of postmodernism, observing how all pretenses to the utopian-modernist project of transforming the city around it have been abandoned. Rather, like the aviator shades of disgraced alt-right icon Milo Yiannopoulos, the “phenomenon of reflection” as utilized by Trump Tower “repels the city outside,” as Jameson says of the Bonaventura, instituting a scopic regime designed to “achieve a certain aggressivity toward and power over the Other” (quoted in Gillick 2016). In its very surface reflectivity, the building, no less than Milo’s Top Gun-era aviators, reflects an “aesthetic regime” and “a particular value system” that, as Gillick notes, are “more than thirty years old,” and that were ushered in by the last president who came to power under promises to “Make America Great Again.”1 The minimalistic incorporation of glass, granite, brass, and stainless steel, all of it polished to produce distortive mirror-like effects, summons “the values of car production and kitchen design,” both of which Gillick associates with “individual desire.” Stepping into the funhouse lobby through one of the “excessive” number of entrances that make up the “postmodernist doubl​e-rev​olvin​ g-doo​rs-ar​ound-​centr​al-do​uble-​doors​ arrangement,” one glimpses a “confusion” of glossy signifiers, a complex interlacing of commerce and consumption, business, tourism, and luxury living, all of it bound together somehow by the ubiquitous master signifier of the letter T, which appears gilded on glass windows or stamped into plates of brass (Gillick 2016). If the Bonaventura’s lobby anonymously enacts what Jameson (1991, 43) describes as a spatial “vengeance” on the confused and bewildered guests passing through it, the vengeance enacted by the lobby of Trump Tower is of a more personalized\n\n26\n\nDavid Markus\n\norigin. Everywhere we look, we are made to know who owns this space. In this sense, the environment figures as a microcosm of the post-2016 world around us: a world in which Trump’s name seems all but inescapable. Developing ideas he first published around the start of Reagan’s second term as president, Jameson (1991) characterized “postmodern hyperspace” by its production of an “alarming disjunction point between the body and its built environment,” a disjunction ultimately analogous to “the incapacity of our minds, at least at present, to map the great global multinational and decentered communicational network in which we find ourselves caught as individual subjects” (44). What “hyperspace” presents us with, he wrote, is the “imperative to grow new organs, to expand our sensorium and our body to some new, yet unimaginable, perhaps ultimately impossible, dimensions” (39). Thirty years onward there can be little doubt that built environments have become only more complex and confounding as material technologies have advanced, new virtualities have been spawned, and urban “smart space” has begun to crisscross the globe. If our sensoriums have expanded in the meantime, it is only to the extent that we have become increasingly reliant upon the technological prostheses we carry around with us in our pockets today. Within this context, Trump’s buildings inhabit a privileged position. In a video that accompanies the online version of his article “Fool’s Gold: The Architecture of Trump,” Ian Volner (2016) describes the Trump Organization’s architectural portfolio and program as “completely lacking in order . . . a kind of horrifying asymptote or lacuna in the middle of capital . . . a kind of a black hole,” before going on to observe how this aberration seems analogous to Trump’s political operations. Volner not only affirms the hyperspatiality of Trumpspace, at least at the level of its radically disjunctive totality, but also posits it as no less than a bend in the space-time continuum itself. But what of the organs and sensorium of the man responsible for engendering this vacuum-like singularity within both the architectural sphere and the spatiotemporality of contemporary politics? Among the many things Trump appears to embody is the fantasy of a sensorial system or apparatus voracious and hypertrophied enough to extend its mutant proboscides into every unseemly crevasse of our increasingly systematized, but mindbogglingly chaotic, contemporary global reality. This fantasy is as potent for the rural white conservatives who praise the president’s multinational business know-how (while somehow forgiving his membership among the distrusted global elite) as it is for certain paranoiac corners of the left, which became convinced after the election that for all of his ineptitude, Trump (or at least his Steve Bannon-led team of advisers) was, as certain of his supporters have suggested, playing an elaborate game of geopolitical 3-D chess. Such viewpoints may be largely confabulatory; but there can be none so tragic in its delusions as that of a Democratic Party that failed to recognize\n\nA Truly “Free” Psychopathology\n\n27\n\nthe extent to which Trump’s sensorium is, by virtue of whatever horrifying mutation, far more attuned than that of his professional political-class opponents to the perpetually shifting, multi-surfaced, hyper-networked spaces of our current reality. Trump, in his unceasing self-promotion and convulsive, self-styled managerialism, exposes something like the perverse core of the neoliberal subject. He both embodies and explodes the post-Fordist understanding of professionalism as, in the words of Paolo Virno, “a subjective property, a form of know-how inseparable from the individual person” (2007, 44). Difficult as it has been for liberal technocrats to accept, Trump is president not despite but because he is the kind of person who sends out tweets at 3 a.m. His days are filled with unceasing, obsessional media consumption and self-promotion. Like the lights that adorn the front of Trump Tower, which Gillick (2016) suggests were “learned from Las Vegas” and give the impression that “time has been taken for a ride,” the building’s owner and sometime resident is always on. Numberless commentators have pointed to the ways in which Trump has ushered in an unprecedented realignment of established social, political, institutional, and mediatic orders. However, one could just as easily assert that Trump’s presidency is no more—nor less—than the consummation of an “aesthetic regime” and “system of values” that has been around for at least three decades. In this sense, Jameson’s analysis of the “alarming disjunction” he felt back in the 1980s can be understood—as his own text seems to encourage—more as a prophecy of things to come than a diagnosis of his contemporary moment. At the same time, the disorientation so many now feel within the social and political architecture of Trump’s America appears less a symptom of historical rupture than of postmodernism’s belated vengeance. ZONES OF INDISTINCTION At the conclusion of his text on Trump Tower, Gillick (2016) points us to a passage from J. G. Ballard’s High-Rise in which the luxury tower at the center of the novel is described as “a model of all that technology had done to make possible the expression of a truly ‘free’ psychopathology” (Ballard [1975] 2012, 47). Let us briefly consider the significance of Ballard’s work for our present concerns. It is a fitting coincidence that the film version of High-Rise was released in theaters the same year Trump was elected president: the novel on which it is based is an extended inquiry into the relationship between psychopathology and the built environment. Published in 1975, at the edge of the neoliberal era, the book explores the perverse underside of the professional social order with startling foresight. Gillick is coy about the connections between his detailed analysis of Trump Tower and Ballard’s\n\n28\n\nDavid Markus\n\nnarrative. But what seems relevant to our investigation is the way in which the insomniatic mayhem of the characters in High-Rise is tied to the near total identification with professional status that the building enables. Each of the “virtually homogeneous . . . well-to-do professional people” that comprise the book’s cast of characters inhabits an apartment whose floor, size, and decor is a direct expression of their social rank (17). Surrounded by luxurious amenities, isolated from the rest of urban life, and left entirely to their own devices, what emerges is a Social Darwinian dystopia in which the well-heeled gradually give themselves over to the frantic exploration of “any deviant or wayward impulses” (47). Within the context of Ballard’s life and work, one important reference point for understanding this paradigm, which emerges repeatedly in the author’s books, is the terrifying exhilaration and paradoxical sense of freedom experienced by the protagonist of Empire of the Sun ([1984] 2005). The young boy at the center of that autobiographical novel lives out a portion of his youth, as Ballard himself did, inside the walls of a World War II-era internment camp in Japanese-occupied Shanghai—that is, within a space in which “the normal order,” to quote Giorgio Agamben (1998, 174), “is de facto suspended.” Agamben, of course, has dedicated a significant portion of his work to articulating the relationship between the concentration camp and the biopolitical structures of contemporary existence—those instituted under twenty-first-century American Empire among them. His work is therefore well suited to an analysis of Ballard’s fiction in the context of our present concerns. Agamben argues that the camp should be regarded “not as a historical fact and an anomaly belonging to the past . . . but in some way as the hidden matrix and nomos of the political space in which we are still living” (1998, 166). The relevance of such assertions to contemporary American politics was made strikingly apparent under the George W. Bush administration, with the latter’s post-9/11 institution of a “state of exception” as justification for flouting civil liberties, along with international law and conventions, en route to the full-scale destruction of Iraq.2 During the Obama years, Agamben’s philosophy was invoked in response to the extrajudicial assassination of suspected terrorists, some of them American citizens.3 And under Trump, Agamben has again become a common reference point for commentators, particularly amid the horrific accounts that have emerged from the immigration camps along the US-Mexico border, and with the president’s declaration of a national emergency in a transparent ploy to ensure the construction of his much-hyped security wall. As the global immigration crisis worsens and right-wing movements proliferate across Europe, the suspension of “the normal order” of western democracy threatens to become increasingly normalized. But, as Ballard helps us to see, the infiltration of the camp paradigm into the nomos of contemporary existence is by no means exclusive to the\n\nA Truly “Free” Psychopathology\n\n29\n\nproperly political realm of quasi-authoritarian governance. Rather, there would appear to be a troublingly intimate relationship between the logic of the exception and the fantasies governing the supposedly “normal” lives of the professional-managerial class under late capitalism. Given the connection in Ballard’s work between the conditions of the camp and the conditions to which the hyper-professionalized community in HighRise descends, it is noteworthy that Agamben concludes his decades-long Homo Sacer project (or at least did so chronologically speaking) with a study that implicates, within our modern matrix, “the paradigm of the office,” or what he also calls “duty” or “operativity” (2013, xii). Agamben’s chief focus in this more recent work (titled Opus Dei: An Archeology of Duty) is on the collapse of boundaries between “what a human does and what a human is” (2013, xii). He makes no direct mention of the camp, and he even leads us to wonder if “operativity” has not effectively displaced “the camp” as his new paradigm for modernity. One does, however, find traces of material addressed in previous works, notably in the references to Hannah Arendt’s remarks on Adolf Eichmann—the consummate functionary—and the links between Kantian ethical duty and “the execution of the Final Solution” (122–23). In describing “office or duty” as a collapse between “being and praxis,” Agamben also alludes to what he terms the “zone of indistinction” (xii). This is the same label he elsewhere reserves for the camp qua “space of exception,” or the space in which the rules of law governing human behavior give way, as they do in Ballard’s nightmarish imagination, to a condition in which “everything is possible” (Agamben 1998, 169–70). If Agamben nevertheless remains reticent about the links between operativity and the camp as a space in which the inhumane exception becomes the rule, High-Rise would appear to fill in the blanks rather starkly. As much as the space of pure operativity represents the total victory, over social life, of the existing capitalist order, it also suggests the collapse of order itself—or rather, the emergence of an order in which absolute domination is the only operative principle. In short, when human beings no longer distinguish between themselves and their business titles, between their self-worth and their earning power, between their place in the world and the floor number of their luxury condo, the conditions are in place for a holocaust. Returning to our initial object of analysis, we can observe how the collapse of the personal and the professional, the private and the public, the night and the day, which defines the psychogeography of Trump’s “Building on Fifth Avenue,” subtly reflects a more troubling “zone of indistinction.” As HighRise appears to anticipate, the perverse allure of the neoliberal project—signaled, at the political level, by the fixation on deregulation and regulatory reform, on the passage of laws suspending laws—at least partially lies in the fantasy of achieving a state of ultimate lawlessness, which must always\n\n30\n\nDavid Markus\n\nfind its space of (paradoxical, because inherently restricted) localization.4 “Secure within the shell of the high-rise,” Ballard writes of the professional climbers that inhabit his novel, “like passengers on board an automatically piloted airliner, they were free to behave in any way they wished, explore the darkest corners they could find” ([1975] 2012, 47). We have yet to discover the videotapes of Trump’s alleged sexual deviances, but for a contemporary permutation of the space Ballard envisions, one need look no further than the private island of billionaire financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, whose private jet—dubbed “Lolita Express” by the tabloids—played host to both Trump and former president Bill Clinton, each a fine case study in Agamben’s conception of “office.” Spaces of luxurious exception seem to work wonders on otherwise docile brains. Through a perverse internalization of the German proverb, “the house shows the owner,” exclusivity reinforces the sense that one is, often quite literally, above the “normal order” (“German Proverb” 2017, 81). To make a “diamond in the sky” one’s home is to find oneself elevated to the ultimate state of exception: the status of the star. And “when you’re a star,” as Trump has reminded us, “you can do anything” (Jacobs, Siddiqui, and Bixby 2016). I FEEL FREE The notion of a “truly ‘free’ psychopathology,” which is conjured by the infamous words quoted above, hangs about another remark that emerged in the heat of Trump’s quest for the White House—that is, for a still more prestigious address than that of his Fifth Avenue penthouse. “I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters,” he told a group of supporters in Iowa before going on to clinch the Republican nomination and the presidency (East 2016). In the context of the preceding discussion, one is reminded of a scene from American Psycho, Bret Easton Ellis’s early 1990s exercise in “the poetics of deregulation” (Godden 2011). Toward the end of the novel, which is set in the waning years of the Reagan era, Patrick Bateman finds himself on Fifth Avenue, “look[ing] up, admiringly, at Trump Tower, tall, proudly gleaming in the late afternoon sunlight.” A moment later he has to “fight the impulse” to “blow . . . away” two black teenagers he observes standing in front of the building (Ellis 1991, 385). It is ironic that Ellis, the onetime literary “brat pack” star, has received perhaps the worst critical drubbing of his career for his commentary on the Trump era. His provocatively titled work of nonfiction, White, has been derided as a lazy, reactionary screed that has more to say about the privilege and narcissism of its author than about our contemporary moment.5 Ellis has downplayed the repeated references to Trump in American Psycho\n\nA Truly “Free” Psychopathology\n\n31\n\n(Grow 2016), but the novel offers a prescient vision of the position occupied by the future president within the structure of late-capitalist American fantasy. Set to the soundtrack of Belinda Carlisle’s “I Feel Free” (Ellis 1991, 52)—along with, more famously, the corporate rock of Huey Lewis and the News (352–60)6—the narrative unfolds within a New York in which seemingly “everything is possible.” And yet Bateman, who pursues any and all forms of deviance with impunity, is a figure defined as much by his crushing sense of insecurity as by his smug entitlement. The detailed inventories of designer attire and the menu items of upscale restaurants that occur with suffocating regularity in the book are not merely the self-satisfied descriptions of someone with the means to partake of luxury culture’s finer things. They reflect a pervasive anxiety about what it means to be somebody, to make a name for oneself, in the purely transactional world Bateman inhabits. The central male characters in Ellis’s novel, for all their elitism, mostly appear as interchangeable—slightly better or less well-dressed—iterations of one another. They are expensive non-entities, nobodies, who are perpetually confusing the names of their colleagues, and being mistaken for one another by those same colleagues. If there is one exception it is Paul Owen, manager of the coveted Fisher account, whose ability, in Mary Harron’s film adaptation of the novel (2000), to score a Friday night reservation at Dorsia is a marker of true freedom.7 But even toward Owen the attitude is less one of reverence than astonishment and contempt. Within this world of flimsy selfsame semblances, of interchangeable Madisons and Turnballs and Ebersols and Halberstams, Trump signifies the ultimate: he is the real McCoy, the unimpeachable authority on all things luxury, the man elevated to ubiquitous brand, the totally sovereign figure. Bateman will end up hacking Paul Owen’s face in half with an ax for having a slightly better tan and professional profile than he does. But he won’t dare to contradict Trump’s glowing assessment, in a magazine interview, of the pizza at “Pastels”—even though Bateman admits he personally finds the crust a bit too “brittle” (Ellis 1991, 46). But then, as Lauren Berlant notes in a short text published in the wake of the 2016 election, it’s not so much Trump’s “taste” that his followers share with the man, as his “intensity of appetite and his commitment to a shameless life” (2017). In our era this shamelessness is bound up with white America’s desire, in the wake of the Obama years, to feel comfortable in its skin again, or, in other words, to indulge its casually supremacist inclinations. For Trump’s part, it involves the embrace of his own orange-headed cartoonishness, which is perhaps the true and final testament to the man’s lust for grandiosity. As Berlant reminds us, “Cartoon characters never die” (2017). In the late 1980s, fragile whites may have been less threatened by “politically correct” discourse, but Trump’s public shows of racism and weaponization of uppermiddle-class fear—expressed most blatantly in his response to the Central\n\n32\n\nDavid Markus\n\nPark Five case8—were no less a part of his identity and appeal.9 At the same time, the Trumpian “glitter” and “glare” that Edgar Allan Poe long ago associated with the American “aristocracy of dollars,” and that now seems almost as cartoonish as the man’s hair, was à la mode (Poe [1840] 2015, 158, 157, 155). Still, the core of what the “Big Man,” as Berlant calls him, was selling, was the same—namely, “Big Man-style sovereign sovereignty.” Except that here we should understand “sovereignty” not in the properly political sense intended by Berlant but in a discursive, mediatic, and fantasmatic dimension that is, itself, not without political consequences.10 To put it another way, among the band of feuding finance bros that inhabit Ellis’s book, Trump is—for Bateman, at least—the Big Poppa. Like the father of the primal horde in Freud’s Totem and Taboo, who hoards all the women to himself, he represents the exception to the rule of limited enjoyment. He is what Jacques Lacan calls the “au moins un” or “homoinzun”— that figure outside the law who fantasmatically assures those subjected to it that there is such an outside, that “au moins un” (at least one) has access to total satisfaction or jouissance. Although he never appears in person in Ellis’s book, at the level of signification his name stands for something more tangible than the mostly interchangeable cast of male characters. To quote Kenneth Reinhard’s (2005, 53) treatment of Lacan’s concept, Trump is the “signifier that is not subject to [the signifier’s] laws,” he is, “an ‘exception,’ the singular signifier that remains rigid, intransigent, and around which all other signifiers revolve.” At the level of material belongings, what Trump embodies, in his own phrasing from Trump: The Art of the Deal, is “the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular” that advanced consumer culture has to offer (Trump 1987, 40). He is the star, the nonpareil, the one. And yet, the very existence of Trump’s 1987 bestselling guide to success should remind us that he also represents something else within the realm of the popular imagination: a figure who ostensibly wants to aid others in attaining the same exceptional status that he has. In other words, in keeping with Lacan’s conception of the myth of the primal father, he is not a figure who simply hoards his enjoyment so much as one who institutes the notion that total enjoyment is possible. This logic can be mapped onto Trump’s political persona. It is not that his seeming magnanimity renders him any less hierarchical a figure. Mark Fisher writes that “one of the successes of the current global elite has been their avoidance of identification with the figure of the hoarding Father, even though the ‘reality’ they impose on the young is substantially harsher than the conditions they protested against in the 60s” (2009, 14). But this statement, which was made in the late aughts, can hardly be applied to the numerous “Big Man-style sovereign” leaders that have emerged since. It is far more the case that the inability of a less traditionally paternal order of “third-way”\n\nA Truly “Free” Psychopathology\n\n33\n\ntechnocrats to prove their beneficence has conditioned the atavistic emergence of a new breed of strongmen who, if nothing else, are living testaments to the stunning potential for wealth and power accumulation under the prevailing political economic system. Yet it would also be foolish to assert that “The Great God Trump,” as Mike Davis (2017) has called him, is not in crucial ways a God who giveth. This is as true for the high-earners who stand to benefit the most from the president’s trillion-and-a-half-dollar tax giveaway as it is for poorer Americans. Among Trump’s unwavering base of supporters, it would appear that many experience the outlandish grandiosity of his personhood and presidency as itself a kind of generosity. His excesses can be thought of in terms of what Georges Bataille (1985, 126) called “sumptuary processes,” forms of spectacular expenditure along the lines of the potlatch. Foremost among these must certainly be the proudly wasteful monument to racism that the president has endeavored to build along the 1,954-mile US border with Mexico. Trump, it seems, has never ceased to be a real estate guy. The vision he is offering, of an entire country transformed into a gated community, is little more than a mass-marketed right-wing populist version of exclusive dwelling—the product upon which he built his fame and fortune. This brings us back to Bateman standing in front of Trump Tower with a murderous look in his eyes. As perhaps the most notorious developer during a period in which the largest city in the United States was handed over to financiers and transformed into the gleaming capital of capital that it is today, Trump is a paradigmatic figure. Trump Tower is his signature achievement of the 1980s. By the time Bateman arrives in front of the building, in the final pages of Ellis’s novel, he has left a trail of wreckage across Manhattan. Thomas Heise has argued that Bateman is “a psychotic subject who embodies neoliberal theory and performs it through his repeated acts of disembowelment” (2011, 135). Standing before a shining emblem of the city’s sterile future, sneering at the blacks and the homeless, he might just as fittingly be described as “the Angel of Death . . . that gluttonous ravager of humans—capital” (Stein 2019, 1). The quote, from a 1911 editorial by Abraham Cahan, is the one that Samuel Stein places at the start of Capital City: Gentrification and the Real Estate State, a book that analyzes how capital under neoliberalism ravages the urban landscape, “rushing in and out of spaces with abandon in search of profit and growth” (2). Even more than the collapse of boundaries between “what a human does and what a human is” it is, perhaps, finally, the total identification of oneself with capital, conceived in its most ruthless, alienating, and exploitative dimension that constitutes a “truly ‘free’ psychopathology.” The genius of Trump has been not just to embody the fantasy that such a total identification is possible, by, among other things, making himself over as a brand, but to sell this fantasy as something you can own and occupy—literally “live inside of.”\n\n34\n\nDavid Markus\n\nWhile Bateman does not live in Trump Tower, he does live among the stars (Tom Cruise owns the penthouse in his building), and he has clearly bought into the fantasy that Trumpspace exemplifies. No less essential than clothes and food to the inventory of luxury things that he unceasingly details in American Psycho are the attributes of his apartment: its flooring, and carpet, and furniture, and art, and high-end consumer electronics. In the most extensive description we’re offered of the space, a five-page-long paragraph that begins the book’s second chapter (Ellis 1991, 24–29), Bateman transitions seamlessly between his description of luxury objects and his description of himself as he goes about his morning routine. He is keenly aware, of course, that not everything he possesses is “the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.” While his appropriately named “Duntech Sovereign 2001 speakers in Brazilian rosewood” (25) may well be the best that money can buy, his “Wurlitzer 1015 jukebox” is “not as good as the hard-to-find Wurlitzer 850” (24). Likewise, he still can’t get a reservation at Dorsia. But he has “vowed” to get one before his thirtieth birthday, just like he’s vowed to get himself “invited to the Trump Christmas party aboard their yacht” (225, 177). In the meantime, his apartment suffices to reinforce a sense of his place in the world. It is, after all, an elegant and sophisticated space, tailored to the needs of the young professional accustomed to carrying out “murders and executions” on Wall Street by day, and who knows what else after work (206). And should someone at the office mistake him for Halberstam or McDonald—no matter. Patrick Bateman, after all, is only “an idea . . . some kind of abstraction . . . something illusory. . . . fabricated, an aberration” (376–77). At the end of the evening, he’ll “say good night to a doorman [he doesn’t] recognize (he could be anybody) and then dissolve into [his] living room high above the city” (24). It seems a fantasy. And you are home. NOTES 1. The reference is to Ronald Reagan. Matt Taibbi (2015) calls the slogan “a backbone” of Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign. 2. See Giorgio Agamben (2005).
