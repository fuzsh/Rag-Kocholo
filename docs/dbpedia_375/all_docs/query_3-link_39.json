My ﬁrst books were devoted to studying how men and women in past generations attempted to control their fertility. This study is in some ways a new departure. It is true that in looking at early modern discussions of reproduction I frequently came across instructions on how individuals—concerned by some sexual inﬁrmity—could seek to enﬂame their lusts and assure their fecundity. I was surprised by the number of references to aphrodisiacs made in medical books and herbal texts, but tended to skip over many of the reports, preoccupied as I was by my search for evidence of contraceptive practices. Some of these readings nevertheless lodged themselves in the far reaches of my brain and eventually I began to wonder if they did not warrant more systematic examination. We risk being left with a distorted view of the past if we have only accounts of how partners tried to limit their fertility and none of how they sought to increase it, and only histories of women’s bodies but none of men’s. Such musings led me to go back more carefully over a number of the sources I originally perused decades ago. In this roundabout way the research was launched that resulted in this study. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the many friends and colleagues who assisted me in this undertaking. I ﬁrst have to thank Brian Dippie for subjecting the manuscript—like so many earlier ones—to a careful and insightful reading. I only wish I had the space to respond to his many challenging ripostes. Special thanks goes to Michael Finn for putting me up in Toronto and generously sharing with me his research notes on the French decadents. Countless students and colleagues provided me with encouragement and assistance, but I particularly value the intellectual support\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\noffered by Robert Nye, Lesley Hall, Chandak Sengoopta, Barbara Marshall, Hera Cook, Ralph Dose, and Christian Graugaard. Over the years Roger Davidson, Jennifer Evans, Simon Szreter, Bruno Wanrooij, and Pat Thane kindly passed on references. Stephanie Olsen and Heather Stanley were cheerful and industrious research assistants. I received useful feedback from friendly audiences when portions of the study were delivered as part of the Horning Lecture Series at Oregon State University and at the European Social Science History Conference held at Humboldt University, Berlin. I am very appreciative of the generous support of the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, which enabled me to make the numerous overseas trips that this project required. My repeated stays in London were brightened by the hospitality and kindness of Susannah and Richard Tafﬂer and Aimée and Michael Birnbaum. Thanks to Bill Benzie, I have for many years been perfectly situated in London in Upper Woburn Place, halfway between the British Library and the Wellcome Institute. Christine Delphy saw to it that in Paris I was even more centrally located on the rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau. For their unﬂagging service I owe a debt of gratitude to the staffs of the University of Victoria Library, the Woodward Medical Library at the University of British Columbia, the Cambridge University Library, the British Library, the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, the Bibliothèque Nationale, and the Kinsey Institute. At the University of Victoria Andrew Rippen has been a supportive dean, Eric Sager and Tom Saunders understanding history department chairs, and Karen McIvor an ever helpful departmental secretary. No one writes more engaging letters than Doug Mitchell; he and Tim McGovern made the production process a pleasure. I am as ever indebted to Brian and Donna Dippie, whose boundless generosity makes my continual shuttling between Victoria and Vancouver possible. Although now in residency in Montreal, Jesse still keeps me from taking myself or my projects too seriously. Arlene remains my main critic and supporter.\n\ni n t rod uc t ion\n\nWho today hasn’t heard of Viagra? The little blue pill has garnered billions for the Pﬁzer corporation and made male impotence—now reconﬁgured as erectile dysfunction—a topic of public discussion. What most participants in the current debate ignore is that impotence has a history. Have men always suffered from impotence or the fear of it? Strictly speaking they have not, given that the Oxford English Dictionary states that the word “impotence” to denote an absence of sexual power only came into common usage in the seventeenth century. Nevertheless in preceding centuries men lamented their loss of “courage,” lack of desire, and debilitated loins. And more important than the changes in vocabulary were the changes over time in the ways in which male sexual incapacity was culturally conceptualized and the social meanings it was given. The purported causes of impotence (the term we will resort to for simplicity’s sake) varied and so did its impact. In Mesopotamian texts from the seventh century BCE, historians have found references to men consuming roots and plants to restore their potency. They also recited protective spells to counter sorcerers’ attacks on their virility. Get excited! Get excited! Get an erection! Get excited like a stag! Get an erection lik[e a wild bull]! Let a lio[n] get an erection along with you! 1\n\nCenturies later the inquisitors of sixteenth-century Venice reported that by tying three knots in a rope while repeating a spell, a jilted lover could sexually incapacitate the man who had abandoned her. In nineteenth-century England quacks claimed that the main cause of impotence was masturbation. “As in man, so in woman, this pernicious habit takes away the inclination for\n\nxii Introduction\n\nthose pleasures with which the multiplication of the species is connected, sometimes it destroys the actual power of effectual communion.” 2 Today urologists and pharmaceutical corporations blame erectile dysfunctions on poor blood circulation. In some senses the history of male incapacity appears to have come full circle. Historians tell us that until the twentieth century the public commonly assumed that sex, marriage, and procreation were inextricably linked and so impotence was long discussed in the context of a man’s ability to marry and have children—not in the context of merely being able to have sex. In early modern Europe when patriarchal power depended upon a man producing heirs, the public openly discussed the problems posed by impotence. Doctors, wise women, and priests prescribed a variety of herbal and magical remedies. Family fortunes and dynastic stability demanded successful coition. Charles II’s lack of success in siring an heir led to the Hapsburgs’ loss of Spain. On the one hand rumors about Louis XVI’s initial failure to consummate his marriage fed the public unrest that ultimately resulted in the French Revolution; on the other hand the ﬂedgling American republic was strengthened by George Washington’s inability to found a dynasty. Impotence could be both a metaphor for, and an actual cause of, failures of the body politic. In the nineteenth century the concern for family privacy and male sensitivities led the respectable to avoid such topics. These decades of discretion were anomalous. In the early twentieth century psychoanalysts attributed rising rates of impotence to Oedipal desires, endocrinologists blamed an insufﬁciency of “male” hormones, and novelists targeted henpecked males’ fear of cocksure feminists. By the 1990s guaranteed medical cures were heralded and impotence was once again front-page news. But the sellers of Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis did not suggest that their purpose was to overcome problems of infertility. In a small-family culture male potency was no longer proven by siring children, but by being an accomplished sexual partner. A disease, according to Michael Solomon, “is a social construct and, as such, is dependent on a complex codiﬁcation of patterns, images, and forms that are produced within the conventions of an interpretive community. To become diseased is less a process of being ill than one of putting our ills—or having our ills put for us—into categories, fables, ﬁctions, and myths that offer explanations for suffering, strategies for coping, and hopes for cure.” 3 Although in this study impotence is regarded as a problem rather than as a disease, a similar perspective has been adopted. The goal is to locate impotence in the context of changing social expectations and cultural givens. In providing a constructionist history of impotence,\n\nIntroduction\n\nxiii\n\nwe trace Western discourses and theories to understand the cultural forces that structured representations of masculine sexual inadequacy. The result is something akin to what Foucault would term a genealogy of a speciﬁc modern issue. Beginning with the premise that language always mediates the material world, we have paid special attention to the sexual vocabulary of each age. The ways in which the body was described obviously affected the ways in which the body was actually experienced. In other words impotence in an age that believed in witchcraft was quite different from impotence in an age that believed in science. Such comparisons help reveal why different cultures took their particular approaches in conceptualizing and dealing with such a problem. What at ﬁrst glance might seem a bizarre view of the body’s workings can—when placed in its cultural context—reveal itself as a rational and understandable reﬂection of the society’s values. The notion of impotence can accordingly serve as a heuristic device in rethinking the history of Western sexuality, particularly in posing the question of how this category related to the masculine ideal. To write a history of impotence entails a survey of changing models of masculinity.4 Though every era has employed discourses to represent and control sexuality, certain ages clearly manifested a heightened anxiety about the issue of male sexual dysfunction. But what did one mean by the term “impotence”? When reproduction was highly prized it was often confused or equated with sterility or barrenness. Even in modern times it has had a variety of meanings—failure to achieve an erection, failure to penetrate, and either failure to ejaculate or ejaculating prematurely. Such failures might be chronic or intermittent; they could have physical or psychological causes. They could arrive with old age. Why such a concern for the erection? It was obviously essential when the purpose of sex was propagation, but modern sex surveys revealed that much if not most of the male’s sexual pleasure came from means other than penetration. Nevertheless it was taken as a given in Western culture that sex was synonymous with intercourse, a man penetrating his partner. The implication of such a belief is that a man feared impotence, not so much because it might deprive him of pleasure, but because it would prevent him from providing proof that he could perform as a male should. Potency was long linked to maturity. The close association of sexual virility with youth is a relatively recent phenomenon. Whom were men’s erections for? Where does the issue of women’s pleasure ﬁgure in the discussion? It is important not to conﬂate cultural representations with practices. If one is to believe today’s pharmaceutical advertisements, men’s desire to overcome sexual dysfunctions is driven by their\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nconcern for their partners. Asking whether or not this is true today or ever was in the past highlights the fact that sexual practices can have a range of meanings. For many men intercourse became reiﬁed and was made synonymous with “sex” because it represented social dominance. We have been talking about men, but this study focuses on notions of manhood in Western cultures. Yet even within these narrow conﬁnes it is impossible to ignore the ways in which discussions of sexual dysfunctions by whites played a role in their construction of ideas about race and ethnicity. Such discussions created the racial “other” partly by attributing to nonwhite men either an animal-like, primitive potency or an exhausted lack of virility. Historians have begun to track the role played by such beliefs in the process of racialization.5 What societies make of male sexual problems is naturally of great interest to the historian of gender. The way in which impotence was treated and discussed always affected both men and women. No better example could be given than the writers of Playboy and Penthouse heralding the arrival of Viagra as somehow freeing men from feminist oppression. Despite such assertions, the history of impotence is perhaps even more about power relations among men. Who traditionally decided what was normal and healthy masculinity? Men. Who set the standards? Men. Who communicated them? Men. Though there has never been a universal, biologically determined standard of male potency, when discussing impotence men in every culture made clear what they felt most threatened male potency, what they recognized as the signs of the loss of masculinity, and how “remasculinization” could be attempted. Gender identity, in short, was something that they believed could be both threatened and protected. Here, the traditional medical historian might protest that a history of impotence shows that no matter what earlier quacks might claim, men unable to attain an erection had no hope of cure until the emergence of modern biochemistry. Yet the story is obviously more complicated than that. The cultural historian—while not denying the improvements in treatment—would argue that the history of impotence demonstrates how every age has culturally framed the discussion of male incapacity.6 Fiascoes in the bedroom have been attributed at one time or another to witchcraft, masturbation, homosexual desires, shell shock, sexual excesses, feminism, and the unconscious. The arrival of new explanations did not necessarily displace older ones. Even in a scientiﬁc age some would still attribute failures to irrational forces. As made clear in songs, plays, novels, and movies, Western culture has simultaneously regarded impotence as life’s greatest tragedy and life’s greatest joke.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nThe debates over Viagra have brought home to the public that the pursuit of normative sexuality has both its beneﬁts and its costs. A history of impotence not only allows us to locate these discussions in their cultural context; it provides a compelling way in which to understand male power and the conﬁgurations of male desire. What precipitated ideas of masculine vulnerability? How was male anxiety assuaged? What sorts of women were regarded as posing a threat to virility? In seeking to answer these questions we are led to see how cultures constructed their particular notions of sexuality’s pleasures and dangers, its private and public functions. Every age turned male sexual dysfunctions to its own purposes; every culture created, combated, and in some fashion cured the forms of impotence it found most alarming. What do we learn in investigating the history of impotence? Most importantly we discover that male sexuality does have a history. Countless studies have tracked the ways in which women’s sexuality was “constructed” or repressed or policed. We have, for example, histories of hysteria, pregnancy, orgasms, and breasts. In contrast, next to nothing has been said about how normative standards of male performance were established. “It is noteworthy,” a legal scholar recently observed, “that an expanding and exciting feminist literature which discusses images of the female body as leaky, volatile, and permeable has provoked far less comment on the implicitly or explicitly contrasted construction of the male body as bounded, stable, and non-permeable.” 7 But was the male body assumed to be stable? Most histories of sexuality seem to take that position. In his pathbreaking study Making Sex: The Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud (1990) Thomas Laqueur all but ignored men. “It is probably not possible to write a history of man’s body and its pleasures,” he asserts, “because the historical record was created in a cultural tradition where no such history was necessary.” 8 Yet the study of impotence reveals that a vast and changing cast of characters were interested in men’s sexual capacities. Their private problems were implicated in the discussion of a range of important public issues including marriage, divorce, reproduction, illness, and aging. Such discussions naturally reﬂected societies’ changing views of men’s bodies and appropriate masculine behavior, but they were also entangled in preoccupations with sex, race, gender, age, and class. Though some recent studies give the impression that until the twentieth century impotence was almost unknown, an investigation of what earlier cultures regarded as the causes and cures of male dysfunctions reveals that male potency was rarely taken as a given; each culture sought in its own fashion to nurture and protect it. Only by understanding the responses made to impotence in the past can we fully\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nappreciate (and perhaps anticipate) the ways in which it will be dealt with in the future. We begin in chapter 1 by surveying Greek and Roman discussions of sexuality. This was a world in which penetration proved manhood; it mattered little whether the penetrated was a woman or a boy. Given the importance of potency to reputation, doctors provided recipes for restoratives yet at the same time ribald writers produced comic accounts of men who failed the crucial test. Unlike the Romans, Christians could neither laud potency nor regard impotency as a joke. Yet, if the gloomy Augustinian view of the purposes of marriage placed a new stress on celibacy and “inner masculinity,” Christians could not ignore the problem posed “when desire refused service.” Chapter 2 follows the long line of celibate church doctors who made themselves experts on erection, penetration, and emission. When the power of the church declined, as in Restoration England, wits once again made impotence a laughing matter. Chapter 3 demonstrates how jokes about sexual humiliations played a vital part in a common male culture of the seventeenth century. Male sexual dysfunctions appeared distinctly different when viewed through an eighteenth-century prism. Chapter 4 shows how quacks and philosophes—in attempting to cure, counter, and explain away male sexual problems—embraced the new notion of men and women inhabiting separate sexual spheres. The nineteenth-century culture that craved privacy found discussions of such disasters distasteful, but given the middle-class ﬁxation on the notion of the active male and the passive female, I argue in chapter 5, the issue of impotence could not be ignored. The writers of middle-class marriage manuals popularized the notion of a “spermatic economy” in which excesses led to a loss of manly vigor and bankruptcy resulted ultimately in impotence. Physicians, chapter 6 demonstrates, showed a new concern for youthful indiscretions, highlighting the dangers of masturbation, spermatorrhoea, prostitution, and venereal disease. Quacks employed the new cheap press both to create anxieties and to sell their nostrums to cure “lost manhood.” As the Victorian model of masculinity that valorized restraint was displaced by a more relaxed ideal, the early twentieth century witnessed a shift from moral to psychological explanations of impotence. Chapter 7 contrasts the writers of marriage manuals who increased pressures on males to perform with Freudians who attributed impotence to Oedipal guilt, and the resulting incapacitating male view of women as either Madonnas or whores. Chapter 8 argues that the rise of endocrinology in the 1920s ﬁnally legitimized the scientiﬁc study of the male reproductive system and dramatically revealed a twentieth-century hostility to aging. New operations and patent medicines indicated how far\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\na culture would go in egging men on in the desperate pursuit of a particular sign of manliness. Following World War II, marriage counselors and sex therapists declared impotence to be a problem from which not one but two people suffered, and both would have to be treated. Chapter 9 shows that it was hardly a coincidence that in the 1970s reports of a “new impotence” followed the emergence of second-wave feminism and the discovery of the multiorgasmic female. We conclude in chapter 10 by analyzing the furor created by Viagra. Its backers claimed that pharmaceuticals had trumped surgery, psychoanalysis, sex therapy, and feminism. The corporations did make billions, but did the new impotence pills “revolutionize” sexuality? The medicalization of sexuality has displaced, but not entirely banished older beliefs in the noxious inﬂuence of sin, guilt, bad habits, and even evil spells. A layer of biomedical reasoning has in effect been added to the earlier stock of arguments used to explain sexual dissatisfactions. The gist of this study is that every age has turned impotence to its own purposes, each advancing a model of masculinity that informed men if they were sexual successes, and if not, why not. Nothing is more revealing of a culture’s social and ideological preoccupations than the enormous pains it takes in goading men on in the often painful pursuit of the “normal” and the “natural.”\n\n[1]\n\nthe i m pe ne t r a b l e pe ne t r ator Manhood in Greece and Rome\n\nOvid’s Amores and Petronius’s Satyrica provide the two most famous literary accounts of the ancients’ view of impotence. In Amores 3.7 the Latin poet amusingly describes his inexplicable inability to perform with a woman he has long lusted after. Yes, she was beautiful and well turned out, The girl that I’d so often dreamed about, Yet I lay with her limp as if I loved not, A shameful burden on the bed that moved not. Though both of us were sure of our intent, Yet could I not cast anchor where I meant.\n\nFollowing this disastrous encounter the narrator is enraged to ﬁnd his refractory member suddenly full of vigor. But notwithstanding, like one dead it lay, Drooping more than a rose picked yesterday. Now, when he should not be, he’s bolt upright, And craves his task and seeks to have his ﬁght. Lie down in shame and see you stir no more! You’ve caught me with your promises before. You’ve tricked me, got me captured weaponless, And I’ve endured great shame and sore distress.1\n\nComing across such a familiar scenario it is tempting to assume that men in ancient Greece and Rome regarded impotence in exactly the same way as do men in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Indeed it would be easy to produce\n\n2\n\nchapter one\n\na history of impotence by simply totting up every reference to what today we might interpret as concerns for erection. The obvious danger of such an approach is that one begins with the assumption that there actually exists such a thing as “impotence” that can be tracked over time. Even in our scientiﬁc world different people mean different things in employing the term. Accordingly there is all the more reason to be sensitive to the fact that earlier cultures constructed, explained, and gave special signiﬁcance in quite different ways from ours to what could in general terms be described as male sexual failures. To make the story even more complicated, it also has to be admitted that we cannot know if such failures actually existed; relying on written sources produced by the literate elite, all we really we know is how such events (or nonevents) were culturally represented. Some sense of the importance of cultural framing is given by a reading of Petronius’s Satyrica. His hero Encolpius tries to bed Circe, but at the crucial moment he too goes limp. Three times I whip the dreadful weapon out, And three times softer than a Brussels sprout I quail, in those dire straits my manhood blunted, No longer up to what just now I wanted.2\n\nAgain, this sounds very familiar to the modern ear. The cultural resonance of impotence is only made clear when Petronius goes on to deal with the possible causes, cures, and import of the problem. Encolpius is humiliated not simply because he is unready for sex, but because he appears less able than a cinaedus, a passive homosexual whose status is lower than his. Encolpius’s lack of erection is thus shameful inasmuch as it signals a loss of both masculine and social status. And why does he suffer such a fate? Is it because of his boyfriend whom Circe says he should drop? Is it due to an unhealthy regimen that he seeks to ameliorate by continence, diet, and a restriction on wine? Might he be bewitched? An elderly crone helps him counter the evil eye. In chapter 138 when he is ﬁnally cured, it is by a sadistic old priestess who buggers him with a leather dildo smeared with oil, pepper, and nettle seeds.3 In providing a comic account of impotence, Petronius is not attempting to document all the ways in which his contemporaries viewed the problem. Nevertheless a reading of his masterpiece reminds us that to appreciate earlier societies’ understandings of the workings of the body we have to make a conscious effort to avoid assuming that they shared our views and values. Certain acts employed by the Greeks and Romans no doubt either curbed or encouraged potency, but what mattered was not so much the act as the\n\nManhood in Greece and Rome\n\n3\n\nsocial construction of meanings given to it and the individual responses to such meanings. How are we to understand the ancients’ discussion of impotence? The construction of both the problem and the cure directly related to their notions of sex and gender. To place the issue of impotence in its social setting we begin this chapter with an analysis of the roles assigned to men and women in the ancient world, then turn to Greek and Roman attitudes toward intercourse and procreation; we will examine the many ways in which they sought to control desire, and review how their notions of manhood accommodated biology and behavior. To be a man in the ancient world a vigorous character was essential. The Romans were positively ﬁxated with an ideal of the self-controlled, aggressive, virile male. They had an extravagant concern for winning recognition through public achievement. According to what has been called the Mediterranean notion of manliness, men had to appear strong and active. A man manifested proper male behavior by expressions of his righteous anger, powerful desires, and personal autonomy. Even humor was seasoned with a strong element of sexual aggression, as opponents in law and politics were commonly abused as soft or effeminate. Hence the poet Catullus threatened to rape or bugger his critics.4 Of course, given that almost all the sources available to us were written by men, the portrayal of the aggressive, virile, emotionally cool male was obviously an ideal or cliché rather than a reality. The ancients admitted as much in stressing the importance of performance. One might be born male, but to prove one’s manhood one needed to walk and talk in a certain way. Rhetorical skills, for example, played a key role in establishing gender identity. Gender was in effect learnt. “Masculinity in the ancient world was an achieved state,” one scholar has noted, “radically underdetermined by anatomical sex.” 5 There were few hard rules.6 Though gender norms existed, deviations were accepted. Male reputation and honor were not predetermined; men learned how to manipulate community expectations and the norms of masculinity to their own advantage. Notions of assertive male behavior were projected onto the genitals. Thus Plato personiﬁed the penis as “disobedient and self-willed, like a creature that is deaf to reason, and it attempts to dominate all because of its frenzied lusts.” Indeed the assertion that masculinity was for the ancients not simply determined by anatomy sounds counterintuitive, given their acceptance of public male nudity, the attention paid to male genitalia, and the displays of the phallus. Greek nurses molded the baby’s body, even using swaddling to shape the scrotum and stretching to elongate the foreskin. To judge by illustrations and statuary, the ideal penis was small, thin, and had a pointed\n\n4\n\nchapter one\n\nforeskin. The Greeks believed a dainty penis was not only more attractive but more serviceable in reproduction, since its semen, not having to travel as far, would suffer less heat loss. They represented Satyrs with huge penises as sign of their ugliness. The Romans, however, preferred big penises, or at least that was the case of the emperors when choosing their favorites.7 In the ancient world the erect penis was a symbol of maturity and power. The Romans celebrated a boy’s ﬁrst ejaculation. Representations of the penis were found everywhere. Artiﬁcial penises were used on the comic stage of Athens until the fourth century BC. A phallic stele of Hermes stood at the doorway of every Greek house and during ritual processions the men carried an enormous phallus through the community. In Roman gardens, instead of a scarecrow, a representation of the god Priapus, complete with erect penis, threatened intruders with rape.8 The ancients moreover employed an elaborate vocabulary to describe the male genitals. “People will laugh aloud at you,” warned an early Greek epigram, “if you venture to sail unequipped, a rower who has lost his oar.” In common parlance the erect penis was described as one’s equipment, tool, spear, ram, goad, or drill. In its ﬂaccid state it might be called a snake or rope. A woman accordingly cursed her younger rival “may you ﬁnd a snake in your bed.” The Romans believed the sparrow to be lecherous, so in Latin “sparrow” was a synonym for penis. In Catullus 2 and 3 the narrator talks about his girlfriend’s sparrow being dead, that is, himself as impotent. In literature the phallus was frequently personiﬁed, especially the impotent prick as in Ovid’s Amores 3.7.9 The ﬂaccid penis represented failure since for the virile in the ancient world sex could only mean penetration. A man had either to penetrate or be penetrated. Martial (Epigram 3.73) for example accused Gallus of not being able to stand and thereby implied that he was a fellator. The real man was an “impenetrable penetrator.” The special resonance this concept held can only be fully appreciated when it is recalled that this was a resolutely inegalitarian society in which elite men always had at their disposal submissive and sexually available male and female slaves. Sexual relationships were embedded in social relationships. Respectable men necessarily took the accusation of being sexually passive as the gravest insult, implying as it did that one was no better than a slave. Male character assassination fed on such innuendos that one was “soft.” In the musings of philosophers such as Seneca as well as in popular lampoons, grafﬁti, and satires appeared the same expressions of distaste for effeminacy.10 The genitals represented the man. Potency represented power, hence the number of literary references to the penis as a weapon. Loss of potency\n\nManhood in Greece and Rome\n\n5\n\nmeant loss of manhood and defeat. Catullus in one poem refers to a groom whose “short sword hung like a strip of limp beet / between his legs, never / cocked navelwards.” In Petronius’s Satyrica the narrator lamented, “I was a ready soldier, but I had no weapons.” The poet Martial wielded the inability to have an erection as amongst the most wounding of charges to hurl at his opponents. He derided one victim (Epigram 11.46): “You no longer rise, Mevius, except in your sleep, and your penis begins to piss onto the middle of your feet; your shriveled cock is stirred by your weary ﬁngers and, thus solicited, does not lift its useless head.” In stating that cunts and asses could no longer serve Mevius, Martial implied that mouths were his last resort. And indeed Martial made just such a charge (Epigram 11.25) against Linus. “That over-active cock, well known to girls not a few, has ceased to stand for Linus. Tongue, look out!” Finally Martial asserted (Epigram 11.61) that Nanneius was so weak that even his tongue was impotent.11 Penetration was central to the ancient world’s notion of healthy male sexuality, but whom might the man penetrate? Historians are largely now in agreement that the concept of sexuality is a discourse—a way of organizing and controlling desires—that only came into being in modern times. Consequently we have to be wary of ahistorically reading back into the ancient world our notion of “sexuality,” in particular the idea that every individual would have a sense of self as being either heterosexual or homosexual. To guard against such presentist thinking, historians of ancient Greece have recently spoken of an age of presexuality, an era in which there was no such thing as “sexual identity.” It has been similarly suggested that Greek homosexuality should be more precisely called pseudohomosexuality or male-tomale intercourse, since few in the ancient world had the concept of a desire for only one sex.12 In the Mediterranean world a man who penetrated and dominated either men or women proved his manhood. The man who sought to please or was the passive partner of either man or woman was considered effeminate. Failure to be aroused by either girls or boys concerned the ancients. Martial scoffed (Epigram 12.86) at the man who despite having thirty boys and thirty girls could not get his cock to rise. Strato had a laugh at himself in ending a poem with a pun on the name of Hector’s son and the word for failing to make erect (12.11): “Yesterday I had Philostratus for the night, but was incapable, though he (how shall I say it?) made every possible offer. No longer, my friends, count me friend, but throw me off a tower as I have become too much of an Astyanax.” And later (12.216) he complained: “Now you’re upright, damn you, and stiff, when nothing is here. But when there was something yesterday, you heaved no breath at all.” 13\n\n6\n\nchapter one\n\nThe Greeks sustained a somewhat ambiguous pederastic model of chaste courtship in which the honor of both male partners could be retained. This culture accepted what we might describe as homosexuality though such relations were at times a source of anxiety. In Rome who penetrated whom was crucial. Anal rape was feared. There were no discussions of the boy’s pleasure, indeed the assumption was made that the passive male could not be pleasured. Those who brandished accusations of effeminacy tended to liken passive men to slaves and women. Yet the worst thing a man could be accused of —even worse than servicing another man by fellatio—was, as noted in Martial (Epigram 2.28), that of servicing a woman by cunnilingus.14 The ancients’ concerns for potency can only be fully understood when viewed in the context of a culture that lauded male dominance and feared the mythical, sexually voracious female. This culture supported a speciﬁc sort of sexuality that assumed inequitable, often violent, relationships in which women and slaves were necessarily subordinate. Men in the ancient world were supposed to be sexually aggressive. They were believed to swell with both anger and desire, doctors viewing the two passions in men as related. Women were objectiﬁed, and their use by men—like the taking of food— was often presented by writers as little more than a hygienic necessity.15 The position women enjoyed in the Greek family is still very much a subject of debate. Those who opt for the darker view of the Attic character stress the themes of male dominance and violence that permeated the ancient myths. The countless references to patriarchy and misogyny in much of Greek literature are difﬁcult to ignore. Zeus had, according to Hesiod punished man for Prometheus’s theft of ﬁre by creating woman and endowing her with crafty speech, thievish habits, and a licentious mind. Semonides, in what has been considered the earliest work in European literature devoted to women (c. 640 BC), portrayed the female as rivaling in vice the sow, vixen, bitch, ass, ferret, mare, and monkey. Male mortals were, for their part, candidly outspoken defenders of a sexual double-standard. “We have,” asserted an Athenian orator, “courtisans for pleasure, concubines to look after the day-to-day needs of the body, wives that we may breed legitimate children and have a trusty warden of what we have in the house.” The public tolerance and, in the Greek case, the lauding of male homosexuality undercut the importance of heterosexual intercourse. Poets praised the buttocks of both beautiful boys and women, but the vagina was not lauded like the boy’s anus.16 Depending on whether one looks at the portrayal of women in the law, theater, or medicine one comes away with distinctly different views of their status.17 Perhaps the best that can be said is that for a variety of reasons men\n\nManhood in Greece and Rome\n\n7\n\nand women often lived quite separate lives. Males dominated the public world of the political forum, the gymnasium, and the symposium. Women oversaw the domestic sphere. The difference in the age of spouses presupposed different outlooks on life. In the Greek cities men married at close to thirty (when their own fathers, if still alive, were preparing to make way for the next generation) whereas brides were often in their early teens. The Romans assumed that family order was best assured if an age gap of about ten years separated the bride and groom. Aristotle regarded late marriage as healthy because, “to abstain from early marriage conduces to self-control; for women who have sexual intercourse too soon are apt to be wanton, and a man’s body also is stunted if he exercises the reproductive faculty before the semen is full grown.” He believed semen and the menses started and stopped at the same ages, but men only became fertile at twenty-one. He contradicted himself later, acknowledging men could be still be potent in old age. An older husband presumably could more easily control a young wife, but Aristotle voiced the fear that she might prove sexually demanding. To dissuade men from entering into marriages in which there would be too great an age disparity, Plutarch claimed the Athenian law allowed the wife a legal right to demand her husband be physically capable of fulﬁlling his conjugal duties at least three times a month.18 Given the sexual double standard, the ancients regarded heterosexual intercourse somewhat ambiguously. Discussions of the use of pleasure inevitably raised the specter of dangerous over indulgence. There was no particular sexual practice or activity—not masturbation nor sodomy nor same-sex intercourse—that especially aroused their concerns; rather it was the idea of excess that preoccupied them. At ﬁrst glance they seemed to view the problems posed by sex like those of thirst and hunger. That does not mean, as has often been claimed, that unlike Christians, the pagans accepted the “naturalness” of sexuality. What counted for them was gender, not sexuality. That is to say, almost anything an elite male did was, by deﬁnition, acceptable. Elite behavior was regarded as being conﬁrmed by rather than being a result of biology. The early medical texts accordingly said much about diet, regime, and self-control. In these accounts orgasm was analyzed not because of the pleasure it gave but out of concerns for control, utility, and hygiene. As long as a man was dominant, the ancients were not so much interested in whom he had sex with or how, but with the dynamics of desire. Those who believe that the ancients had no notion of forbidden acts are mistaken. They might not have sought the complete renunciation of desire as would the Christians, but they felt the need to demonstrate mastery of their desires.19\n\n8\n\nchapter one\n\nWomen were told that to be healthy they needed sex—even if they did not ﬁnd it pleasurable. In men lust was taken as a given. For Plato desire emerged in the seed itself. In Greek medical thinking heat was necessary for life; cold brought death. Only men were hot enough to produce semen. For Diogenes the Cynic air was the life principle and male semen the “foam” of the blood; the mother simply reared in the womb the offspring produced by the father. Similarly the Hippocratic text “On Generation” held that semen was transported from brain to loins, thus a cut above the ear could render one sterile. Since it looked like spinal ﬂuid the seed was thought to come from the head and the essence of life from the knee. Given the Hippocratic idea that sperm came from the marrow of the spine, hunchbacks with their exaggerated backbones were thought especially lecherous.20 For Aristotle semen was a residue concocted from the blood; further concoction occurred in coition, which explained the child’s resemblance to the parent. He argued that the presence of pneuma (air) in the semen turned it white and also expanded the penis. Holding one’s breath supposedly helped to release sperm. Though Aristotle located semen in the scrotum, he saw no need for the testicles except as weights to keep the vesicles extended. While Herophilus investigated the vas deferens, the seminal vesicles, and prostate gland, he too retained the notion that blood turned into semen. Rufus of Ephesus was the ﬁrst to assert that semen was formed in the testicles.21 The Hippocratic authors argued that women, like men, produced seed or semen though of a weaker nature. Aristotle argued in a circular fashion that because women lacked heat they could not produce semen and their failure to produce semen proved they lacked heat. Moreover since they could not emit semen it followed that, unlike men who had to reach orgasm if conception were to take place, women’s pleasure was not required. “A sign that the female does not emit the kind of seed that the male emits, and that generation is not due to the mixing of both as some hold, is that often the female conceives without experiencing the pleasure that occurs in intercourse.” Indeed Aristotle held that a woman’s colder physiology was most inﬂuenced by the moon: “the menstrual discharge in the natural course tends to take place when the moon is waning . . . that time of the month is cooler and more ﬂuid.” Women—being weak, cold, and passive—could be likened to eunuchs or young boys. The female was incomplete at the biological level and accordingly could not resist the male who would make her complete.22 Discussions of reproduction were colored by this general assumption of female inferiority. In Aeschylus’s Eumenides woman was presented as little more than a nest for the growing conceptus: “She who is called the\n\nManhood in Greece and Rome\n\n9\n\nmother is not her offspring’s Parent, but nurse to the newly sown embryo. The male—who mounts—begets. The female, a stranger, guards a stranger’s child if no god bring it harm.” Anaxagoras claimed that males provided the seed and females only the “ground” in which embryos were reared. Aristotle noted, “Anaxagoras and some other philosophers hold that sex is already determined in the sperm. They say that while the father provides the seed, the mother only provides a place for the fetus to develop; that male offspring come from the right testis and female from the left; and that furthermore, male offspring develop in the right side of the womb, females in the left.” Similarly Plato argued, “for the woman in her conception and generation is but the imitation of the earth and not the earth of the woman.” Aristotle likened the male element operating on inactive female matter to a carpenter working on wood or to rennet changing milk into cheese.23 If the seed succeeded in impressing form on matter a male was produced; if it failed a female resulted. The Romans relied heavily on Greek medicine for their understanding of reproduction—indeed the leading physicians of the empire were Greek— but the Romans tended to take a more pessimistic view of health. They were clearly preoccupied with corporal fragility and exhibited an intense interest in diet and regimen. For Galen sexual intercourse was necessary for health. “It is evident,” he concluded, “that a chaste person does not indulge in sexual intercourse for pleasure, but with the intention to relieve this urge, as if this were not associated with pleasure.” Galen, like the Hippocratic writers, believed women produced seed and their hysteria resulted from a surplus. Men suffered even more from retaining semen. Masturbation might have been recommended as a therapy. The ancients said little about the topic, but the act certainly posed no ethical problem. Galen repeated the famous story of Diogenes the Cynic bringing himself off, not for pleasure but to avoid bodily disturbances.24 The medical sources contained many references to cures for barrenness, which could be taken as evidence of a widespread fear of sterility. The barren wife certainly risked being divorced. But what if the man failed to complete the sexual act? As Plutarch made clear, sterility and impotence were often confused. “Diocles holds that sterility in men ariseth from some of these causes,—either that they cannot at all ejaculate any sperm, or if they do, it is less than nature doth require, or else there is no generative faculty in the sperm, or the genital members are ﬂagging; or from the obliquity of the yard.” 25 The fact that the ancient texts contain extended discussions of how such situations might have arisen and how they could be remedied is the most striking indication of the anxieties provoked by fears of impotence.\n\n10\n\nchapter one\n\nThe ancients recognize a wide range of causes of male failures. The Greeks believed that a male child would be made impotent if placed on tomb. Firmicus Maternus cited the inﬂuence of the planets as a cause. Others attributed men’s failures to the work of the gods. In the Odyssey (10.299–301) Hermes warns Odysseus of Circe’s magical power to render him impotent. The Odyssey also made reference to Melampus, the ﬁrst mortal to understand the language of animals. Phylacus offered to free him and to give him his cattle if Melampus would cure his son, Iphiclus, of impotence. Melampus discovered the antidote to Iphiclus’s impotence from two vultures. Dionysus purportedly punished the Athenians with impotence for dishonoring his cult. But the vengeful might also appeal to the gods. An enemy could make a man impotent by inscribing on obsidian the ﬁgure of a castrated man and have the victim touch it. For a similar purpose some resorted to casting spells on wax efﬁgies.26 A man could always attribute his failure to such witchcraft. More commonly the woman would be blamed for the sort of inexplicable inability to perform that in modern times would be called his psychic impotence. Martial (Epigram 1.146) castigated a partner for simply shattering the aura of romance. Hedyle, when you say, “I’m rushed. Do it if you’re going to,” My weakened equipment droops right away and stops. So tell me to hold on; I’ll go faster if I’m held back. Hedyle, if you are in a hurry, tell me not to hurry.27\n\nHorace portrayed the man who defensively attributed his failures to the woman who was too ugly or too fat but had the temerity of accusing her exhausted victim of being a “sluggardly bull.” The historian Herodotus more sympathetically described the plight of Amasis, king of Egypt, who was only impotent with Ladice. Ovid and Strato in poems noted above commented on the frustrations of the man who mysteriously found himself unable to perform with his beloved. Martial (Epigram 3.70) presented a man who now desired the same woman whom he had spurned when she was his wife. “Is it that when secure you lack appetite?” The Stoics attributed sterility to temperament, noting that one could be barren with one partner but fruitful with another.28 Commentators also listed a number of organic causes of sexual dysfunctions. Hippocrates (On Airs) referred to the Scythians’ impotence being due to their horse riding. Aristotle wrote that men who put on ﬂesh “emit less seed and have less desire for sexual indulgence.” “Fat people too, both men\n\nManhood in Greece and Rome\n\n11\n\nand women, appear to be less fertile than those that are not fat, because the residue when concocted in well-nourished bodies becomes fat; for fat too is a healthy residue caused by good feeding.” 29 To be potent a man had to be healthy. It was commonly believed that wine was an aphrodisiac, though in excess it led to sleep. According to Aristotle, “the man must not be drunk, nor should he drink white wine, but strong unmixed wine, eat very strong food, not take a hot bath, be strong, in good health, abstain from unhealthful foods.” Commentators warned that cooling foods could abate lust. Plutarch asserted that wine was cool and countered the need for heat. The ancients claimed that a variety of cooling vegetables could serve both as contraceptives and as anaphrodisiacs. Pliny the Elder noted that Homer called the willow “fruit losing” because it lost its seeds quickly; for that reason, continued Pliny, “it is well known that willow seed taken as a drug produces barrenness in a woman.” Bryony mixed with ox urine caused impotence. Soranus described the cooling effects of wine, rue, wallﬂower seed, myrtle, myrrh, and white pepper. Dioscorides listed nine plants endowed with contraceptive properties and the water lily that caused impotence. Aelian claimed that usually lustful male animals could be rendered coy by the use of a certain herb.30 Ovid (Amores 3.7) referred to chilling anaphrodisiacs such as hemlock that prevented erections. She round my neck her ivory arms did throw, Her arms far whiter than the Scythian snow, And eagerly she kissed me with her tongue, And under mine her wanton thigh she ﬂung. Yes, and she soothed me up, and called me sire. And used all speech that might provoke and stir. Yet like as if cold hemlock I had drunk, It humbled me, hung down the head, and sunk.31\n\nIn literature there were many references to men’s fears of women tampering with their food. Doctors believed the man had to be inﬂamed in order to be potent. It followed that narcotics that calmed and soothed his spirits could in effect unman him. Wives who sought to keep the affection of their husbands, women attempting to bind a lover to them, and enemies seeking to lull an opponent into complacency would, it was reported, use spells and narcotics to lessen a man’s anger and thus his potency. Plutarch warned women against using love potions and magic on their spouses. He claimed Antony failed as general since he was always thinking of Cleopatra, as if bewitched by a spell or certain drugs.32\n\n12\n\nchapter one\n\nCommentators attributed most common forms of impotence to the bodily failures associated with either old age or youth. The elderly, and those on dry and cool diets were thought to bear sex least well. The ancients took it as a given that old men would become impotent. According to Aristotle emitting seed helped the young but hurt the old. He asserted that the age of procreation for men ended at seventy and for women at ﬁfty. The semen of the elderly was less concocted. The Greek poet Antiphanes drew the moral that one had to enjoy life when young. “Thenceforward is the heavy winter of old age; you shall not make love, not even for a thousand drachmas, such is the impotence that awaits you.” 33 The Greeks and Romans cruelly joked about the incapacities of the elderly. Juvenal (Satire 10.204–209) coolly captured the sexual frustrations that often accompanied aging. For intercourse is already long distant in memory; Or should you try, your tool lies small and vessel-swollen. And although it be stroked all through the night, It will lie unresponsive. So can this old age of debilitated loins hope for anything? And isn’t desire without ability, Which actually impairs passion, truly suspect? 34\n\nSatiric writers’ references to the limp members of old duped, ugly, impotent men are, according to one historian, “of course in the grand tradition of comic scurrility and appear often.” Aristophanes’ lost play Amphiareus concerned an old man with a young wife seeking vigor either through lentils or erotic incantations. Lucilius ridiculed weak old men. Martial (Epigram 11.81) compared the geriatric to the eunuch: “Lack of strength makes the one, length of years the other useless for the job; so each labours in fruitless desire.” 35 The sixth-century writer Maximianus Etruscus (Maximian) in Elegies of Old Age produced the most extended tragic/comic account of old age in which the hero ﬁnds himself unable to perform with a Greek beauty. I wish’t, I ask’t, and gain’d the Beautious She; But, oh! What Witchcraft did Enervate me! Lifeless I on that mass of Beauty lay, Nor the due debts of Sacred Love could pay. All vigorous warmth my languid Limbs forsook, And left me cold, like an old sapless Oak. My chief, yet basest Nerve, did then prove lank, And, like a Coward, from the Battle shrank;\n\nManhood in Greece and Rome\n\n13\n\nShrivell’d, and dry, like a dead wither’d ﬂow’r. Depriv’d, and void of all vivisick pow’r. No fertile Moisture, no proliﬁck Juice, Could the enfeebled Instrument produce; No unctious Substance, no kind Balm emit; Balm, nourishing as Milk, as Honey sweet. At last cry’d out the Disappointed Fair, Thy dull unactive weight I cannot bear; Thy heavy Limbs press me with joyless pain, And all thy faint Endeavours are in vain. . . . such was my ﬁrst sad Night, That I could neither give nor take Delight. But a base conscious shame possest each sence, Nor left me pow’r to make the least defence, Dash’d with the Guilt of my own Impotence. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . For what, alas, can those Defects supply, Which weaken’d Nature do’s to Age deny? But then I blush’t, and stupify’d became, Much more debilitated by my Shame.36\n\nSuch wistful portrayals countered the philosophers’ argument that man was not to fear old age, but welcome it for freeing him from ﬂeshly preoccupations.37 Doctors in turn warned young men that they could become old before their time if they over indulged. As lassitude followed emission of semen, sexual excesses were believed to result in impotence. The general concern of medical writers was that a balance be retained and excesses avoided. For example, the Hippocratic writings asserted that the wasting disease of tabes was due to unrestrained lust: “This consumption originates in the spinal marrow. It chieﬂy attacks newlywed husbands and lechers. . . . If you ask such a patient, he will tell you that he has a sensation like ants crawling from the head down his spine, and copious seminal discharge with urination and defectation. There is also infertility; and in his dreams, whether sleeping with his mate or without her, he is plagued by love’s mockery.” According to Galen semen was the ﬁnest blood, which in being injected with the breath or pneuma essential to life, became white and frothy. Excesses led to loss of vital spirit. Epicurus said all coitus was dangerous. Rufus came close to agreeing and pointed out that the accompanying loss of heat suffered by men—but not women—resulted in indigestion, memory loss, spitting of\n\n14\n\nchapter one\n\nblood, and fading of sight and hearing. Soranus agreed that excessive coition was dangerous. Caelius Aurelianus, who translated and abridged Soranus, claimed that venery contributed to pleurisy, apoplexy, madness, paralysis, nephritis, and hemorrhaging. He went on to assert, in attacking Asclepiades’ argument that coitus could cure epilepsy, that coition was itself “minor epilepsy.” “For it causes a motion of the parts like that in epilepsy; various parts are subjected to spasms, and at the same time there occur panting, sweating, rolling of the eyes and ﬂushing of the face. And the completion of coitus brings with it a feeling of malaise along with pallor, weakness, or dejection.” Coition, he concluded, exacerbated mania, “for it not only deprives the body of strength but also agitates the soul.” 38 There are no references to same-sex acts endangering Greek males, yet a long line of thinkers portrayed sex with women as dangerous. According to the Hippocratic corpus women were dried out by too little sex; men were dried out by too much. Women relied on intercourse with men for their health. Men could thus be exhausted, but women were inexhaustible, having no self-control. Some seasons posed special dangers. “In general the sexual appetites of animals are keenest in spring-time”; asserted Aristotle, “the time of pairing, however, is not the same for all, but is adapted so as to ensure the rearing of the young at a convenient season.” In the heat of summer men were soon exhausted; women’s appetites remained unsatiated. According to Hesiod women were then “at their most wanton, while men are completely enfeebled.” The woman could render a man impotent and he would soon ﬁnd himself in “raw old age.” She “withers him up and brings old age on youth too soon.” 39 Even the god Priapus complained: The sexed-up neighborhood womenfolk, Hornier than sparrows in Spring, Endlessly wear me out.40\n\nMen had to protect themselves from demanding women whom Aristotle likened to mares in heat. “Coition,” warned Democritus, “is a slight attack of apolexy. For man gushes forth from man and is separated by being torn apart with a kind of blow.” Semen, according to the pessimistic Pythagorians, was a “clot of brain containing hot vapor within it” and consequently every sexual pleasure was harmful. Plato, Aristotle, and the Hippocratic corpus similarly stressed the need for sexual moderation. In On the Nature of Things Lucretius portrayed sex as a trap for men: “Add that they waste their strength, they strain, they die; add that the will of a woman rules their life.” 41 In such texts, men were endangered by intercourse; women, however,\n\nManhood in Greece and Rome\n\n15\n\nwere prescribed it. Hippocratic medicine thus validated male domination in its assertion that women’s health depended on the sexual services of their partners. Ancient men’s fear of women—capped by the nightmarish belief that in losing bodily heat and vigor one could for all intents and purposes become a woman—explains the seriousness with which they regarded displays of virility. There was accordingly no shortage of advice for the man concerned about his ﬂagging sexual abilities. The sheer volume of material devoted to the discussions of how impotence could be cured dramatically demonstrates how preoccupying the Greeks and Romans found the issue. The ancients produced sex manuals providing suggestions of positions and techniques. These texts, resolutely phallic and heterosexual, though no doubt penned by men, were usually attributed to prostitutes, thus sustaining the myth that aside from the odd impotent emperor, real men did not need instructions. In fact from the scraps that survive (and Ovid’s parodies) these cookbook-like manuals appear to have listed positions and stressed the active male, passive female scenario.42 The extensive literature on sex—produced by men for men—explained what to do in case of declining sexual abilities. Some suggested the use of arousing books and pictures. Theodorus Priscianus (2.11) advised “reading tales of love” This fourth-century medical man went on to suggest: “Let the patient be surrounded by beautiful girls or boys; also give him books to read, which stimulate lust and in which love-stories are insinuatingly treated.” References to stimulating or erotic images were mentioned by Ovid. The pornographic wall paintings of Pompeii appear to have decorated both brothels and private homes.43 Martial (Epigram 3.75) noted a range of possible cures, including purchasing the services of youths. Dancing girls were hired to arouse old men. In his biography of Tiberius, Suetonius described the court’s turning to voyeurism and pedophilia to stumulate desire. Fellatio offered impotent old men a last resort. Yet putting such advice into practice did not always work. Ovid scoffed: “and my girl didn’t even disdain to incite you / softly with the motion of her hand. / But . . . she saw no skill could make you rise.” 44 To judge by the literature, men’s most common response to fears of impotency was to consume an inciting herb or beverage. We know that aphrodisiacs were commonly used. There are records of court cases in which women, accused of poisoning their lovers, claimed to have only given them love potions. According to Suetonius, Caligula’s wife gave him such a concoction. Plutarch called on men to avoid the use of aphrodisiacs. In his writings on\n\n16\n\nchapter one\n\nthe life of Lucullus he reported, “but Cornelius Nepos says that Lucullus lost his mind not from old age, nor yet from disease, but that he was disabled by drugs administered to him by one of his freedmen, Callisthenes, in order to win more of his love, in the belief that they had such a power, but they drove him from his senses and overwhelmed his reason.” 45 The many recipes for inﬂaming lust were usually meant for men. Pliny, for example, did not see arousal of the female as posing a problem, though assuring that she conceived might be. Anything that looked like a penis or that warmed the body as did arousal was thought to work. According to the Hippocratic texts legumes, cereals, and nuts, contained air and heat, and so raised the passions. Oils, liquids, and foods were similarly ingested. In particular, as male anger and sexuality were linked, so it was thought that irritants raised a man’s ardor. Accordingly the Greeks used nettles, peppers, and erection-producing drugs like cantharides (crushed blister beetles). Theophrastus listed many such cures in his Historia plantarum. Dioscorides, in the De materia medica added to the earlier herbal information of Theophrastus, discussed love-making, and listed a number of aphrodisiacs, prescribing them according to theories of similarity or contrariety. Paulus Aegineta recommended mollusks, pot herbs, rocket, turnip, pulses, peas and beans, and for the impotent narcissus root, seed of nettle, anise, pepper, satyricon and saffron, chick peas, pine nuts, honey, and wine.46 The most extensive catalog of stimulants was provided by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History. The leek, he asserts, “is an aphrodisiac” (20.47). The turpentine tree or terebinth “is a gentle aperient and an aphrodisiac (24.28)” Garlic “is believed to act as an aphrodisiac, when pounded with fresh coriander and taken in neat wine” (20.57). The water of boiled wild asparagus serves the same purpose (20.110). “The Cyprian reed, called donax . . . taken in wine is an aphrodisiac” (24.87). The leaves of clematis “eaten with vinegar . . . act as an aphrodisiac” (24.140). “Sexual desire is excited by the upper part of the xiphium root given in wine as a draught; also by the plant called cremnos agrios and by ormenos agrios crushed with pearl barley” (26.94). “Democritus thinks that as a food radishes are aphrodisiac; for this reason, perhaps, some have maintained that they are injurious to the voice” (20.28). “Orpheus said that there is in staphylinus a love-philtre, perhaps because it is a proved fact that when eaten it is an aphrodisiac; for which reason some have declared that by it conception is aided” (20.32). Pliny cites Hesiod and Alcaeus on the use of golden thistle (22.87). “They have written that when it is in blossom the song of the cricket is shrillest, women are the most amorous and men most backward in sexual unions, as though\n\nManhood in Greece and Rome\n\n17\n\nit were through Nature’s providence that this stimulant is at its best when badly needed.” That is, in the heat of summer. He says of chervil, “Its special merit is that it gives strength to a body exhausted by sexual indulgence, and revives sexual virility when ﬂagging through old age” (22.80). Dioscorides had asserted that rocket “eaten raw in great quantitie doth provoke Venery” (2 : 170),47 Pliny recommends it as well: “It is believed that desire for mating is also stimulated by articles of diet, for instance rocket in the case of a man and onions in the case of cattle” (10.182). Elsewhere he writes of rocket, “Its properties are quite different from those of lettuce, and it acts as an aphrodisiac” (19.154). Many such herbal cures were attributed to their visual and magical associations, following the so-called doctrine of the signatures. Vegetables and plants that were penis-shaped were esteemed. Orchid-like plants with two testicle-like tubers were similarly thought useful for genital problems and as aphrodisiacs.48 In addition bulbs like onions and garlic produced gas that was thought to be needed for erection. Accordingly Martial advised: “If envious age relax the nuptial knot / Thy food be scallions, and thy feast shallot.” Dioscorides recommends a number of bulbs. Orchis, in goat’s milk “to provoke venery” (19.154); Saturion, a type of orchid, “use it, if he will lie with a woman. For they say that this also doth stirr up courage in ye conjunction” (3.143); Saturion Eruthronion “ is storied that the root being taken into ye hand doth provoke to Venerie, but much more, being drank with wine” (3.144); Orminon Emeron (Salvia Horminum) is also “thought being drank with wine to provoke conjunction” (3.145); and Gladiolus communis: “They say also that the upper root being drank with wine doth provoke venery, but that ye undermost doth make them lustless” (4.20). Pliny agrees. “But very high on the list of wonders is the plant orchis. . . . The root has two tubers, like testicles, so that the larger, or, as some put it, the thinner, taken in water, excites desire” (26.94). “Megarian bulbs [a type of onion?] are a strong aphrodisiac” (20.105). Asphodel, another bulbous plant, was used against poisons. “It is also been held that it is an aphrodisiac if, with wine and honey, it is used as an ointment or taken as a medicine” (22.71). Cynosorchis has, notes Pliny, two roots. “If men eat the larger of these roots, male children are said to be conceived, but female if the smaller is eaten by women. In Thessaly men take in goat’s milk the softer roots as an aphrodisiac, but the harder as an antaphrodisiac. The one part neutralizes the other” (27.65). Pliny claims that Sea-holly does more than counteract poisons. “Marvellous is the characteristic reported of it, that its root grows into the likeness of the organs of one sex or the other; it is rarely so found, but should the male form come into the possession of men, they become\n\n18\n\nchapter one\n\nlovable in the eyes of women” (22.20). “Satyrion is a sexual stimulant.” One has “a double root shaped like human testicles, which swells and subsides in alternate years . . . [which] taken in the milk of a farm-yard sheep, causes erections; taken in water, however, it makes them subside” (26.96). The ancients assumed that what worked for animals might work for humans. According to Aristotle humans ﬁrst learned how to use herbs by watching animals; the herbals in turn advised the same treatments for men and beasts. Pliny asserts “yet another kind of satyrion they call erythraicon. . . . They tell us that sexual desire is aroused if the root is merely held in the hand, a stronger passion, however, if it is taken in a dry wine, that rams also and he-goats are given it in drink when they are too sluggish, and that it is given to stallions from Sarmatia when they are too fatigued in copulation because of prolonged labour; this condition is called prosedamum” (26.97–98). Buprestis was poisonous, at least for oxen, but Pliny suggests that those driven by lust might seek it out since taken in drink it “is the most potent aphrodisiac known” (22.78). Some proceeded to seek cures through the use of animal parts associated with potency. Snakes (since they were popularly believed to rejuvenate themselves), and the genitalia of roosters and goats were consumed. On the forehead of a newborn foal was found a growth called the hippomanes, which, reported Aristotle, was a powerful aphrodisiac.49 The penis was often likened to the lizard, which leads Pliny to note the powers of a large one known as the skink (28.120): “Its muzzle and feet, taken in white wine, are aphrodisiac, especially with the addition of satyrion and rocket seed. . . . One-drachma lozenge of the compound should be taken in drink.” Pliny then proceeds to provide a survey of other popular beliefs in how one might tap into the potency of the animal world. Aphrodisiacs are: an application of wildboar’s gall, pig’s marrow swallowed, or an application of ass’s suet mixed with a gander’s grease; also the ﬂuid that Virgil too describes as coming from a mare after copulation, the testicles of a horse, dried so that they may be powdered into drink, the right testis of an ass taken in wine, or a portion of it worn as an amulet on a bracelet; or the foam of an ass after copulation, collected in a red cloth and enclosed, as Osthanes tells us, in silver. Salpe prescribes an ass’s genital organ to be plunged seven times into hot oil, and the relevant parts to be rubbed therewith, Dalion the ash from it to be taken in drink, or the urine of a bull after copulation to be drunk, or the mud itself made by it applied to the pubic parts. (Natual History 28.261–62)\n\nManhood in Greece and Rome\n\n19\n\nAs Pliny noted not all cures were taken orally. The Greeks attempted to increase potency with various salves, plasters, and creams. A number of magical recipes listed lotions to rub on the penis “for an erection,” “to play with a woman,” and in order “to have fun with a woman.” The Egyptian magical papyri also listed incantations, potions, and salves including one of carrot juice for premature ejaculation. In his Medical Collection, Oribasius drew on Rufus in recommending suppositories to treat paralysis of the virile member (8 : 39). One recipe for those whose humors had thickened and member had cooled was made of mustard, which led to Oribasius warning the patient of the danger of burning the anus.50 Many of the various herbal or animal concoctions were presumed to work by a sort of sympathetic magic. Impotence was, of course, often believed to be caused by witchcraft. Ovid spoke of the nefarious effects of black magic carried out by efﬁgies, poisoned drinks, and incantations. What, am I poisoned by some witch’s charms? Do spells and drugs do me, poor soul, such harms? Did she my image in red wax procure, And with her needles’ points my liver skewer? Charms transform wheat to weeds, and make it die, Charms make the running streams and fountains dry. Through charms oaks acorns shed, from vines grapes fall, And fruits from trees when there’s no wind at all. Why might not then my sinews be enchanted, And I grow faint as with some spirit haunted? 51\n\nIn response, urine could be used medicinally (28.64), suggested Pliny, especially “that of eunuchs to counteract the sorcery that prevents fertility.” He also recommends Southernwood a powerful, warming plant, useful to ﬁght off chills. “They say that a spray of it, laid under the pillow, acts an aphrodisiac, and that the plant is a most effective countercheck of all magic potions given to produce sexual impotence” (20.162). To protect himself against impotence a man might wear a stone talisman or amulet. It was claimed that the “right molar of a small crocodile worn as amulet guarantees erection in men.” In Rome males wore as protection against the evil eye a replica of the penis, called the fascinum from the word to “bewitch.” And ﬁnally one could make an appeal to the gods. “While you’re alive I’m hopeful rustic guard / Come. Bless me, stiff Priapus: make me hard.” 52 Did the aphrodisiacs, lotions, and talismans work? This is an ahistorical question inasmuch as when we moderns talk of medicines “working” we\n\n1.

Carvings such as ﬁgure 3, found at entrances or gateways, were employed to protect dwellings from evil inﬂuences.\n\nManhood in Greece and Rome\n\n21\n\nmean in a scientiﬁcally provable way, whereas the Greeks and Romans regarded many herbal potions having magical qualities. Having said that, it has to be acknowledged that the ancients knew quite well that restoratives did not always have the desired effect. Martial (Epigram 3.75) laughed at one man’s futile expenditures in medicines. Scallions, lustful rockets nought prevail, And heightening meats in operation fail; Thy wealth begins the pure cheeks to deﬁle, So venery provoked lives but a while; Who can admire enough, the wonder’s such That thy not standing stands thee in so much?\n\nWhen commenting on cures of which he was dubious Pliny often signaled his skepticism by the phrase “they say” or by attributing his account to another chronicler.53 For example, he reported, “Again, those carrying on their persons the pith of tithymallus branches are said to become thereby more excited sexually. The remarks on this subject made by Theophrastus, generally a weighty authority, are fabulous. He says that the lust to have intercourse seventy times in succession has been given by the touch of a certain plant whose name and kind he has not mentioned” (26.99). Obviously many of the methods could not “work” in the sense of having a direct, desired physiological effect, but many no doubt played a positive psychological role. Men refused to see themselves as passive beings and sought to have some control over their fates. Whatever the effectiveness of the various therapies, their use demonstrates the serious intent with which the ancients sought to control biology. In the ancient world the attention paid to potency stemmed from the enormous importance of every free man marrying and having children. For the Greeks and Romans a male heir was essential. In Greece only a man could be the owner or kyrios of his lands, children and spouse. In the Roman Empire bachelors were penalized and large families rewarded. Martial asserted that if one was a real man one would have heirs, and joked about Almo who was impotent yet complained his wife produced no children (Epigram 9.66, 10.91). What if a man could not sire children? One might presume that the impotent man would been disbarred from both marriage and fatherhood, but in the ancient world, social status trumped biology. What counted in being a man was, as one scholar has noted, “the male’s gender role—his legal capacity both to marry a wife and to adopt. Anyone who had a penis, even if not in full working order, or who used to have one, was classiﬁed as a man, and therefore, once recognized as legally adult, had the legal capacity\n\n22\n\nchapter one\n\nof a man.” 54 In Rome a male was someone with a penis; only they had heirs. Girls were automatically of age at twelve; boys only when inspected and shown capable of procreation, but if impotent, at fourteen. Marriage conﬁrmed status and status was dictated by elite males. Women over ﬁfty could not marry. Slaves, forbidden to marry, were permitted unions but no inheritance rights and their owner could break up their families. For free Romans premarital sex was unimportant and not an impediment to marriage, though consanguinity and class barriers were. But for the purposes of this study what is essential to understand is that in Rome, a marriage did not have to be consummated—it was a simple contract. In the ﬁrst and second centuries sexual potency was “not a legal prerequisite for lawful marriage” as it would be for Christians. Ulpian stated that the castratus could not leave a will, that is, he could not marry and name heirs. There was no problem if a man only suffered from temporary impotence. Even the physical deﬁciencies of the spado (a natural eunuch who could not reproduce) were not a bar to marriage, though insanity was. Consent was always the key issue. The ancients’ concern was not with the sex act per se, which usually posed no ethical issue, but with whatever might possibly jeopardize the social hierarchy and family property.55 The same deference shown the concerns of elite males explained the workings of divorce. A Roman man could repudiate his spouse with no cause given. Only with Constantine were causes needed; only with Justinian was male impotence noted. Since the purpose of marriage was to have children—indeed under the Julian Laws childlessness was penalized in inheritances—what point was there in the impotent marrying? Some men would, of course, insist that the barren marriage was the wife’s responsibility. Seneca the Elder noted such arguments. The married man lacking children could become the butt of humor because they, as Juvenal notes (9.85), are “proofs of your manhood.” But such failures could be overcome by partner swapping. Plutarch noted that in Greece impotence led to wife lending or husband doubling (Lycurgus. 15.4–7). Spouses were shared to beget children, for example, an “elderly man with a young wife” might choose a noble young man for her. On an informal level complacent husbands allowed others to do their work for them. Juvenal has a character protest: “had I not been a loyal and devoted client, your wife would still be a virgin?” (9.71–72).56 Adoption provided another solution. Even if one were a spado, one could adopt. So too could the unmarried. Indeed the Augustan legislation that required one to be a “father” to ﬁll certain posts sometimes necessitated such a strategy. The Augustan marriage laws gave some ﬂexibility, a man could be paterfamilias even without natural children. In Rome since males alone\n\nManhood in Greece and Rome\n\n23\n\ncould be effective heirs, a man with only daughters might adopt a young man for this purpose. The new heir in turn would be obliged to marry one of the daughters. Adoption was common in the ancient world, but those adopted were usually adults; the purpose was not to provide for the poor, but rather to obtain a suitable claimant to protect the family’s property. As one’s own children were often a disappointment, adoption was, asserted the overrational Democritus, the most reasonable way in which to assure oneself of worthy inheritors. Seneca expressed the view that conceiving a child was the least part of fatherhood: “The generation of me was the least part of the beneﬁt: for, to live is common with the brutes; but, to live well is the main business.” In the Greek comedies it was suggested that barren, wealthy wives passed off foundlings as their own. On children depended the conservation of the household, the maintenance of the estate, the carrying on of the family name, the forging of family alliances, the provision for the elderly in old age, and the performing of funeral rites after their passing.57 By not relying solely on biological fatherhood to sustain the family, the Greeks and Romans skirted what could have been the most disruptive effects of male sexual dysfunctions. How are we to understand the ancients’ discussion of impotence? It obviously reveals contradictions in their notions of masculinity. On the one hand it asserted that to be considered a real man one had to be potent; on the other hand it acknowledged that sexual failures were not an uncommon occurrence. To have sex demonstrated one’s vigor; to have it too often threatened exhaustion. Elite males whose powers ﬂagged turned to a range of therapies in attempts both to restore their virility and to shore up their position in society.58 The construction of both the problem and the cure directly related to Greek and Roman notions of sex and gender. As we have seen they did not identify themselves according to their “sexuality,” a concept that did not yet exist. The desires of ancient men, though they often sound similar to ours, are not what we usually associate with manliness. A man could be alarmed that neither women nor boys stirred his passions. If a lack of an erection shamed him, the feeling would not be sparked by his sense of having failed to pleasure a female partner. To have such a sense of guilt was to be effeminate. Normative male desire, the ancients believed, was fueled by aggression and anger; female desire by passivity. Penetration was likened to a beating, representing the domination of one partner and the submission of the other. Men were explicitly taught to use sex not for intimacy but control. They used herbs, potions, and magic to inﬂame their passions. And even if these failed, they could, because of the powers they enjoyed as free males, marry and become, through adoption, fathers. In the Greco-Roman world masculinity\n\n24\n\nchapter one\n\nwas not a biological given, but a status that could be either constructed and defended or attacked and lost. The discussions of impotence reminds us that in the ancient Mediterranean societies all the many ways in which sexual failures were treated—be it by poets or by physicians—reﬂected not the weaknesses, but the power and prerogatives of the male elite.\n\n[2]\n\nw he n “ de s i r e r efuse s servic e ” Impotence in the Christian West\n\nWhen deciding whether a marriage should be annulled on the grounds of the husband’s impotence, ﬁfteenth-century English church courts sometimes employed “honest women” to examine the man. One woman was reported as giving the following account to the courts of York and Canterbury. The same witness exposed her naked breasts, and with her hands warmed at the said ﬁre, she held and rubbed the penis and testicles of the said John. And she embraced and frequently kissed the same John, and stirred him up in so far as she could to show his virility and potency, admonishing him that for shame he should then and there prove himself a man. And she says, examined and diligently questioned, that the whole time aforesaid, the said penis was scarcely three inches long, . . . remaining without any increase or decrease.1\n\nThat men who were otherwise virile might fail such a test is hardly surprising. “Under the stressful circumstances of such an inspection, men who were being examined might well have failed to show arousal—particularly after being cursed for failure by the examiners—regardless of their sexual capacities in less frightening situations.” 2 What is surprising is that churchmen should have been involved in such confrontations. Christians had to know whether or not a marriage had been sexually consummated. But, pondered celibate church doctors, what was consummation? Was it simple penetration? Or did it require emission? Might it even necessitate the wife’s orgasm? Michel Foucault tartly observed that the pagans were too reserved to leave such a full and intrusive discussion of conjugal rights, methods, and duties.3 Why then did the church ultimately so immerse itself in the messy\n\n26\n\nchapter two\n\ndiscussion of impotence? Why did churchmen, at ﬁrst embarrassed by the issue of male potency, eventually come police it? Some historians have suggested that a cultural shift occurred in the late Roman world, when sexuality became a topic of discussion in poetry and advice literature, as well as a privileged source of pleasure. Whereas once the intimate lives of the members of the social elite were dictated almost solely by the demands of clan, property, and honor, they were increasingly displaced by concerns for privacy and sexual preferences.4 The rise of Christianity represented another aspect of this turning inward, shifting attention from the public to the private. The difference was that the early Christians mirrored the Stoics’ distrust of ﬂeshly appetites; indeed many regarded sex as inherently sinful. Unlike the Romans they could neither laud potency nor regard impotency as a joke. In the ﬁrst instance the early Christians were understandably hostile to the discussion of impotence, focused solely as it was on bodily desires. Yet in seeking to set themselves off from pagans, they were part of an evolution rather than a revolution in mores. Christians did not so much create a new morality as act as its conduit. Already the Stoics had put in place a “puritanical” creed and the metaphysics of the Neoplatonists and mystery cults had popularized an otherworldliness. The passions were suspect; sexuality was regarded as necessarily pitted against reason. Many of the attacks on the old style of life launched by the Stoics were simply continued by Christians converts. John Chrysostom was preceded in his opposition to public baths and nudity by pagan moralists. Seneca had condemned adultery because of the trouble and disorder it caused; Jerome attacked it as immoral and dangerous. Musonius Rufus’s critique of pursuit of sexual pleasure was followed by those of Jerome, Origen, and Clement.5 Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and Lactantius vividly portrayed the dangers of lust. Oribasius noted the dangers caused by sexual excesses. Most condemned the spells and aphrodisiacs employed to stimulate the passions and lauded the “feminine” virtues of restraint. Though most Christian virtues had been anticipated by the ancients, Christians were not simply philosophers. They also formed a social movement: they practiced and preached. Especially striking was the vigor with which they listed and attacked a vast range of vices. They carried over the Jewish abhorrence of sexual perversions and prided themselves on “avoiding porneia,” which, as cataloged in the ﬁrst-century Syrian Christian teachings called Didache or Teachings of the Twelve Apostles, included abortion, infanticide, magic, and same-sex acts. The Book of Barnabas, in drawing on Hellenic natural history, likened the adulterer to the hyena, which changed sex each\n\nImpotence in the Christian West 27\n\nyear; the fellator to the weasel, which conceived through the mouth; and the corrupter of children to the hare, which “increases unduly its discharge each year, and thus has as many holes as it is years old.” 6 Adultery was particularly associated with the philtres or love potions that the ancients employed to increase lust. For the Greeks and Romans desire was not often discussed as a problem, though performance was. In Christian Europe desire increasingly was viewed as a danger—something to be restrained. Church fathers declared themselves shocked by the attempts made by some to actually inﬂame male arousal. They opposed wine for causing sexual excitement. John Chrysostom condemned couples’ recourse to libations, incantations, and love-potions. Clement of Alexandria attacked pictorial pagan lewdness intended to raise desires. Christians particularly abhorred the means employed by the Greeks and Romans to spur on procreation. Clement of Alexandria denigrated women’s use of charms. Caesarius attacked the Gallo-Romans for their employing an “impious drug” to cure barrenness. “Therefore,” he wrote, “those to whom God is unwilling to grant children should not try to have them by means of herbs or magic signs or evil charms.” 7 The more extreme Christian thinkers ultimately objected to almost every manifestation of sexuality from abortion, contraception, divorce, and adultery to the wearing of wigs and the use of make-up. The purported intent of condemning such acts was to end debauchery. Similar concerns had been voiced by some pagans, but a new shift in emphasis was evident. What had been primarily proprietary concerns were made ethical issues. The ancients sought to police sexuality for the conservative purpose of subjecting every individual to a family patriarch; the Church sought to police sexuality for the radical purpose of freeing Christians from the entangling world of secular ambitions and family squabbles. The asceticism of many of the early Christians was due to their apocalyptic expectations. Their contempt for intercourse was not so much due to a hostility to sex per se, as it has been argued, but to the perceived need to prepare for the next world.8 Key to the Christians’ morality was a reappraisal of masculinity. Sexual difference had been crucial to the Romans. To be a man was to be dominant; lesser men were regarded as feminized. If notions of masculinity remained central to the intellectual life of the Christian era, certain anxieties resulted as they were incorporated into the new belief system. Some behaviors previously regarded as unmanly were now regarded benignly. Demonstrations of sexual prowess had been central to the Roman concept of masculinity. For Christians it was not unmanly to be celibate. With a shift in power from political to clerical ofﬁce, new notions of sexual and marital renunciation\n\n28\n\nchapter two\n\ncohered with the Christian ideals. Christianity was better equipped to defend a fresh form of masculinity focused on the image of the “Soldier of Christ.” The virginity of women was exalted by zealots like Jerome who praised those who had not “soiled” their garments. And by the ﬁfth century it was not just female virginity that Christians treasured. Church fathers argued that renunciation of sex was a sign of superior manliness. Such preachers, though they attacked the sexual exploitation of women, were intent on shoring up male authority and excluding women from the public realm. A man had to demonstrate self-control if he was to control others. Reminding their ﬂocks that Roman athletes wore clamps to prevent erection and ejaculation, priests called on men to likewise become athletes for Christ.9 A concern for a victory over the powers of the ﬂesh preceded Christianity and should not be confused with it; the pagans’ goal was hygiene, not holiness. The Greeks were not interested in the who or how of sex but with the ability to demonstrate a mastery of one’s own desire. Christians made sexuality the symbol of the difference between themselves and pagans; it was the key indicator of individual morality. The married and the celibate, the rich and the poor all were subject to a new moral common denominator: the importance of controlling sexual urges. An enormous ethical burden was now borne by acts heretofore considered hardly more signiﬁcant than eating or drinking. Though pagans had not been unthinking hedonists, the idea of viewing mundane sexual practices as the privileged indicators of one’s spiritual condition had previously been unthinkable. The Christians made a nuance the basis for a fundamental cultural cleavage.10 They advanced the modern view of sex as the essence of one’s being. The eunuch was the most striking symbol of the campaign to subdue the male body. Pre-Christian groups throughout Asia Minor and Egypt had performed cultic castration. Pythagorus’s assertion that sex was injurious to men due to the accompanying loss of energy was a common belief among Greeks. Stoics similarly expressed a desire for sexual self-control. Christians—like Jews—opposed mutilation but they lauded celibacy. Jesus noted that some eunuchs were born, others made by men, and ﬁnally “there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake” (Matt. 19:12). Eastern Christians were sharply ambivalent in their views on eunuchs. In the Byzantine Empire castration was condemned but eunuchs were imported. The sort of abstinence eunuchs owed to their mutilation, Christians sought to obtain through faith. Origen envied men who by nature were cool and could easily control their passions.11 Though he argued that eunuchs simply provided a metaphor for such self-control he was\n\nImpotence in the Christian West\n\n29\n\nsuspected of having castrated himself. Other early Christians certainly did. One could go no further in repudiating concerns for potency. In this distaste for sex Christians distanced themselves from their Jewish roots. Judaism was, of course, not without its defenders of sexual renunciation. Maimonides, for example, reﬂected a platonist-like pessimism as regards sex. Some rabbis stressed the production of spiritual rather than corporeal children. In main, however, Judaism plumped for the importance of sex and reproduction. Sex was not regarded as due to the fall.12 Jews regarded impotence as a curse. In the book of Genesis, God was portrayed as imposing it on Abimelech for taking Abraham’s wife Sarah. He informed Abimelech that “therefore suffered I thee not to touch her” (20:6). After Abimelech released Sarah, “God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare” (20:17). Jews viewed virginity negatively and took the notion of the marital debt as a given. Most rabbis called for the separation of the barren. The purpose of marriage was procreation and therefore a man had the right to divorce his wife if she proved infertile. Divorce and polygamy (allowed until medieval times) were used to assist in the duty to “be fruitful and multiply.” Some scholars stated that at minimum two sons were needed. Procreation was monotonously reported in the long genealogical passages of the Old Testament. Celibacy was frowned on and masturbation condemned. Some rabbis thought that self-abuse—like wet dreams—was a result of men not marrying. The Talmud even has a passage in which rabbis’ members are compared.13 Unlike the Jews, Christians lauded continence, celibacy, and life-long virginity. Unlike the ancients who were proud of the body, the Christians found themselves embarrassed by it. Tertullian asserted that part of one’s soul was lost in orgasm. Desire was a sin in itself. The devil tried to ensnare the celibate; erections or nocturnal emissions were signs of evil thoughts. Clement of Alexandria likened semen to epileptic froth, though he did not think intercourse was inherently sinful if the intent was to have children. He used Hippocratic and Aristotlian notions to explain conception while also asserting that angels assisted in the process. Lactantius similarly drew on Aristotle in his natural theology when attacking those who sought to turn sex into an “empty and sterile pleasure.” According to Lactantius procreation was the only reasons the genitals existed.14 For St. Augustine the “disease of lust” was a result of the fall. Did Adam have erections? Augustine argued that in Eden the body must have obeyed the rational will. Sex, like urination, would have taken place rationally. After man disobeyed God, his body disobeyed him and he found himself in\n\n30\n\nchapter two\n\nbondage to sexual desires. For Augustine the genitals were the “shameful parts” that had to be covered “because they excite themselves just as they like, in opposition to the mind which is their master, as if they were their own masters.” 15 The ﬁrst erection was the result of eating the forbidden fruit. The penis was often in a rebellious state, hence Adam was ashamed. Sex was not in itself bad but, according to Augustine, the “autonomy of the penis” was. The libido was uncontrolled. “At times the urge intrudes uninvited; at other times, it deserts the panting lover, and, although desire blazes in the mind, the body is frigid. In this strange way, desire refuses service, not only to the will to procreate, but also to the desire for wantonness; and though for the most part, it solidly opposes the mind’s command, at other times it is divided against itself, and, having aroused the mind, it fails to arouse the body.” Augustine guiltily described himself as “seduced” by his own sexual feelings. In Greco-Roman culture the erect phallus had been a sign of power. For Augustine the erection was both the sign of man’s fallen state and the means of transmitting original sin.16 Christian apologists undercut the Jewish stress on the innate value of procreation, presenting it instead as a result of humanity’s sinful condition. Adam and Eve should have been able to have children without sin but they did not. St. Augustine’s importance lay in his crystallizing the doctrine of the “marriage debt”—that sex in marriage could only be justiﬁed if it produced offspring, ﬁdelity, and continence. He did not mention mutual love. Love was viewed by Christians, as it had been by pagans, as a subversive and destructive passion and therefore dangerous in marriage. The church was more interested in assuring charitas conjugalis—amity, charity, and ﬁdelity. Augustine contrasted a respectable marriage “contracted for the sake of issue, and the compact of a lustful love.” 17 Sex continued to symbolize the fall from grace and the coming of disorder. Impotency, frigidity, and erections were, asserted Augustine, all uncontrolled; all demonstrated man’s enslavement to lust. Marriage was good, but celibacy was better. Thus, far from being worried about impotence, early churchmen feared excessive marital intercourse; it was considered beyond the need to reproduce, overly passionate, or took place in an unnatural fashion. The Decretists argued that sex for procreation was blameless and that the married had a right to intercourse. Others asserted intercourse always involved sin and certainly was not a positive act. The Christian suspicion of sex cast a long shadow over marriage. It was regarded"
