She is the daughter of David Berkoff, who participated in the 1988 and 1992 Olympics, winning two gold medals.\n\nIvan Roe, from Manhattan, is the second Montana athlete who will be in Paris, as he qualified for both the 10 meter air rifle and 50 meter smallbore in the shooting category.\n\nREAD MORE: The Best 15 Montana High Schools For Sports\n\nWho Are The Best Olympians From Montana?\n\nMontana might not have sent the most athletes to the Olympics over the years, but a few that we have sent have been some of the best to ever represent both Montana and America.\n\nSome of the athletes you may be familiar with—we even had one go on to become the governor of Montana—there are also perhaps some unfamiliar names that we feel should be celebrated."
