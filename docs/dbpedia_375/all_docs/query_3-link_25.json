        "text": "This paper presents some results from a community-based project among local South Saami in the Norwegian and Swedish part of Saepmie. I was co-coordinating a two-year community-sponsored project in the community (Røyrvik) in which a local South Saami midwife documented stories from elder Saami about childbirth in earlier times, both from their own memories and from stories they knew. Her work became an article in a book, and the project helped us to understand much more about childbirth and general living conditions for Saami one to three generations ago in this area. As a PhD candidate, I have complemented her work with a theoretical framework (Indigenous Research Methods, colonial perspective), a historical analysis, and a contemporary context. Apart from presenting an example of stories she was given and how they can give us new knowledge. But I will focus on the meanings, processes, theories and practices of engaged Indigenous community research. I will describe our different ...\n\nEthics in research related to Indigenous peoples has, over recent decades, been increasingly discussed in a global context. Decolonizing theories and methods have gained legitimacy and prestige, and Indigenous scholarship has challenged mainstream research by adding novel perspectives and critical standpoints that encourage researchers of all origins to reflect upon their own positions within the colonial academic and social structures in which they work. This development has taken different directions and occurred at different speeds depending on local, regional and national settings. In a Swedish Sami research context, we are now in a time when it is clear that things are moving and discussions on research ethics are taking place on a more regular basis. This publication is one example of that. In Sweden, it is the first one in English that addresses ethics in Sami and indigenous research and this will, hopefully, facilitate collaborations, comparisons and discussions on an international scale. The book is based on some of the contributions to the international workshop Ethics in Indigenous Research, Past Experiences – Future Challenges that was held in Umeå in March 2014. The workshop gathered together around fifty scholars from different parts of Sápmi and abroad, and aimed to move forward Indigenous research ethics in Sweden by highlighting and addressing research ethics related to the Sami and Indigenous research field. It is hoped that this book will serve as an inspiration, a critique, and an illustration of where discussions are heading in a Nordic, and more specifically, Swedish context. It is intended to function as a foundation for future ethical discussions at different levels, in national and international settings both within and outside academia.\n\nThis book chapter discusses education for social art practice by examining four postgraduate level courses that address social art practice located in institutions in Scotland, Ireland and England. It traces the development of education for social art practice through the 1960s and 70s when innovative courses slipped into the mainstream of higher education, for example, and new ideas about community and socially focused programmes began to provide alternatives to the dominance of fine art education. Programmes including contextual art, community arts and critical fine art practice evolved and formed the genesis of the postgraduate studies that are highlighted in the chapter. Published annually, the Relate North books have as an underlying philosophical standpoint, a focus on Northern and Arctic issues in the field of arts, design and visual culture. The series aims to advance understanding and seek to improve arts, design and visual culture education particularly amongst people living in Northern and Arctic areas. An additional aim is to introduce original ways of rethinking the status of contemporary arts, design, craft and new practices in art education. In addition to the Northern and Arctic context, the Relate North series also seeks to reach a wider audience for example, those with a research focus on art, design, sustainability and remote circumstances. Although principally concerned with research and knowledge exchange in art and design education, the contributors investigate issues and topics that may be of more general interest, for example, the socio-cultural and political dimensions of living in rural places and urban settings in remote and peripheral area in other parts of the world.\n\nThis article is about elderly Sami women who are front figures in the ethno-political mobilisation movement, acting from artistic platforms or in traditional political arenas. The Sami culture has been described as male-dominated and Sami women as dually oppressed, belonging to a minority people while also being women, but there are many Sami women, especially the elderly, who in recent decades have emerged as prominent figures in the fight for the survival of Sami culture. How do these prominent figures describe their own position and status? What strategies do they use, as elderly Sami women, to enter the Sami and non-Sami public spheres? How do they tell their story, what is it that motivates them, what obstacles have they faced and what has helped them? This chapter conducts an intersectional analysis on an individual level of the strategic approaches of three women. I have looked at the way these strategies emerge in the women’s life stories.
