        "text": "Erik “Pågen” Ohlsson took part in three Olympic Games (1908, 1912, 1920). He had to wait for his third Games to win his two medals, a silver and bronze in team rifle events. Three times, in 1927-29, he became World Champion with the Swedish team in the free rifle, prone.\n\nIn the days when female competitors had to undergo gender verification, only one woman was ever exempted from that. At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, HRH Princess Anne, who competed in equestrian, was not required to undergo testing."
