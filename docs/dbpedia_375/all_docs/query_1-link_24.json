        "text": "Chronicling over a century of Olympic history, this auction boasts over 200 lots commemorating the resolve and spirit of the enduring Olympic tradition. The sale is highlighted by winner's medals, relay torches, and official badges. Major lots include a super rare winner's medal from the Athens 1896 Olympics—the first modern Olympiad—as well as golds from recent Games like London 2012 and Sydney 2000. Top torches include Lake Placid 1980 and Calgary 1988. Also featured is the noteworthy collection of Tug Wilson, an American track and field athlete who competed in the 1920 Olympics and went on to serve as president of the United States Olympic Committee from 1953 to 1965."
