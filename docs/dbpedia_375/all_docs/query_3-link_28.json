Cannon and Grace, the Amcricene who were executed for complicity In the rebellion, were tried at a court-merttal held under the direction of the Government. The men, It was charged, were re- eponelble for placing dynamite mines which were Intended to blow up Government eteamere laden with troopc, which entered the river at Greytown. One of the mines planted by Can¬ non and Grace exploded fifteen yard! from the steamer Diamante. When Cannon and Groce were captured they had with them dyna¬ mite machinee and other acceeso- rlee for b4owlng up vesseie.

IS.—.Vnnounce- ment that this Government is tired of the high-handed actions of the small Ceniral American republics, practic¬ ally, was contained In a dispatch sent late to-day to.tho Blucflelds Stcamsbip L’oinpsny, which sought the protection of the State Department from Inter¬ ference by the insurgents now operat¬ ing against President Zelaya. An hour later a peremptory note, couched In diplomatic language, but nonetheless direct, was delivered to Senor Felipe Rodrigues, charge d’aftalres of the Nlo. araguan legation, demanding a full and complete explanation of the exe¬ cution of the 1^0 Amerloans, Leonard Grace and L^roy Cannon, who were executed by an order of Zela>*a when they were found In the Insurgent army. • • • Taft Thoroughly Aroused. The State Department practically has recognised the belligerency of the Nica¬ raguan revolutionists and hxis made peremptory demands upon President Zetaya for explanation of the execution of the two Americans condemned as In¬ surgents. The Federal grand Jury at Indian¬ apolis returned Indictments against Wli- Ham H. Marker and Noah B. Marker, former cashier and assistant cashier of the First National Bank of Tipton, Ind.. charged with misapplication of the funds of the bank. Negotiations looking to the consolida¬ tion of the large copper companies In Che United States are still In progress and It was auted yesterday that the merger would not be Anally comiileted for several weeks.

Rlohac^d Watson Gilder, author and editor of the Century Magazine, died last night of heart disease In Now York. Pending a satisfactory explanation of the occurrence. President Taft has refused to recognlzo Isidore Hazera, the new Nicaraguan Minister. Mr. Taft is thoroughly arou‘«ed by the ac¬ tions of the Zelayan Government and apparently la determined to make the lives of United States citizens much safer and considerably more respected In Central America than they have been hitherto. • • ♦ Attitude Clearly Shown. The attitude of the Oovemihent was clearly shown late to-day, when the State Deportment sent a dispatch to the Blueflelds Steamship Company, the headqusrtera of which Is In New Or¬ leans. The company's regular steamer was about to act jmil for Blueflelds, Nicaragua, with a miscellaneous cargo, counted In which were a number of rifles nnd other munitions of war. The corporation was warned by i^nta of the Nicaraguan Insurrectionary forces thal the vessel w*ould be liable i& seiz¬ ure and the steamship people prompt¬ ly called on the Htute Department to declare the protection this Government would give In such a case. • • • Recognizes Rebel Forces. The State Department promptly re¬ plied. The sn.sw'er was the result of a conference between the Prei«ldeni and the Secretary of State and carried full weight. It gave the steamship, no en¬ couragement and practically recognised the revolutionary forces operating against the Zelayan Administration, a proQsedlng for which there probably Is no parallel In the records of this Gov¬ ernment. • • • Text of Knox’s Disx>atch. The execution of the Americans Is held here to be Indefensible. In the ab¬ sence of complete details, this Govern¬ ment is reserN’ing Judgment, but if the men were captured in the ranks of the enemy with arms In their hands they were entitled to military trial, under international Isw’, It Is Inconoelvsble to officials here thru either of the men was acting us a spy, for their nationality would preclude ihelr succeeding at such work. • • • Many Vessels Handy. VTille no orders have barn Issued for the dispatch of war vessels other than the Des .Molnos and the Vicksburg to observe conditions on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, there are plenty of vessels In Caribbean waters that can be sent to the scene on th« shortest notice, while there are other vessels w'ithtn coll on the Pacific coast. It Is evident that the temper of the adirdnls- trotlon hms been thoroughly aroused and If occasion warrants the State De¬ partment may advise some drastic ac¬ tion. \" • • • Minister Ooolidge Withdraws. DRASTIC ACTION BY DIRECTORS For some years the sltiuktlon In Nic¬ aragua has be.#*» an>'thlng but satlafac- tory to the UnKed States. Last year .MInfIster Coolldge resigned from hU I»iace and returned from the Nicanig- uan capital. It W’os given out then that .Mr. Cooltdge relumed merely be¬ cause of his health, but It eventually leaked out through diplomatic channels that he pracllcalb' was forced to withdraw In order to save his dignity and preserve the standing of thU Gov- tmnicnt. Since then there lias been no diplomatic connection belw'een the twro Governments, except through the Nicaraguan legation here. • * • Decline To Make Comment.

Both vessel and cargo are a complete loss Captain Wyman and crew of seven men left the vessel last night, and after a ter¬ rible battle with wind and wave until daylight this morning, they were thrown upon Baldbend Island beach. NEW BELGIAN MINISTER CALLS AT WHITE HOUSE Attaches of the legation declined to¬ night to make any comment on the situation. The new Minister, Srnor Mazera, naturally refused to discuss ft, owing to the fact that his creden¬ tials hod been waived aside at the While House, because of the develop¬ ments of the last few hours. There ‘was an air of genuine anxiety about the legation, howrever, and from ap¬ pearances the diplomats regarded tne situation as grave. • • • To Rsi>ort Developments.

Nicaragua has been one of the Cen¬ tral American HepubUcs that have given this Government more trouble In the last few years than any other, save, perhaps. Venezuela, under the sway of President Castro The atti¬ tude of the United SUtes. as shown by its apparent recognition of the Nica¬ raguan Insurgents, indicates to dlplo-* mats here thal this Government would welcome the overthrow of the present administration there. It is well known that President Ze- layn's altllude towanU Americans and Americsn Interests for some time has been any'thing but satisfactory. The Stale Department to-day main¬ tained a quiet and reserve that w-as de¬ scribed by one diplomat as \"ominous.' • • • Forceful Moral Suasiotu It was learned, however, that both president Taft and Secretary Knox practically have determined on the ex¬ ertion of some forceful moral suasion If nothing more, with a view of bring-* Ing the Central American States to a realisation of their renponsiblliUea. Aside from the acknowledgment that a demand had been made on the Nica¬ raguan legation for a detailed and com- prvhenalvc report of the killing of the Indianapolis. Ind., Nov 1$.—The Fed¬ eral grand jury of this district to-day returned Indictments against eight men charged w ith emtK'Zzlement or complic¬ ity In embezzlement of ihs funds of national banks. William H.

Elbert W. Shirk, a promi¬ nent capitalist of Chicago and North¬ ern Indiana, president of the Tipton bank, who W’oa arrested in Chicago soon after the arrest of the Marker brothers, and tvho was charged w'Uh a misapplication of cash of the bank, was not Indicted because of insufflclent evl. deuce. Max P. Emmerich, a bookkeeper of the Capital National Bank, of Indian¬ apolis. was indicted on the charge of having embezzled $40,000 and Paul C. Gall and Harry C. Prlnzler, depositors In the bonk, are charged with oom- bliclty with Emmerich In making false entries. Indictments on charges ofVmbezzllng amounts ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 were returned against Howard Phll- Mps. assistant cashier of the Terre Haute National Bank, of Terre Haute; Frank H. Nicolais, assistant cashier of the First National Bank, of Auburn; K N. Detzer. teller of thf First National Bank, of Fort Wayne. JUDGE BURTON FOR THE SUPREME BENCH Boston, Mass., Nov. 18.—An order of excommunication against Mrs. Augus U E. Stetson, of New York, for years regarded as one of the most prominent and powerful members of the Christian Science denomination, was Issued to¬ day by the board of directors of the mother church of this city, the supreme governing authority of the organization. In their order the directors staled that a conference of three days bad convinced them of the truth of the charges against Mm. Stetson, namely, tha: she had w-orked against the inter esis of the church and of members of the church w'ho were not her followers, and that she had persisted In teachlnga and practices which are contrary to Christian Science. • • • Moat Drastic In Church’s History. To-day's action was regarded In church circles here as the most drastic In the history of Uie denomination. Mrs. Stetson wan formerly First Header of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, of New York, and until her suspension to-day. was the pastor emeritus of that church at a salary of $5,000 a year. In answer to a summons by the board of directors. Mrs. Stetson on Monday appeaj'ed before the board In the direc¬ tors' rooms at the moUier church .on Falmouth street. The session was se- creu po one being present except Mrs Stetsqn, her counsel, witnesses and the directors themselves. The conferences continued duiir^ three days, or for a total of more iwcniy-elght hours. They were concluded yesterday and Mrs. Stetson returned to New York last night. • • • The Dlrectora’ Statement. The board of directors of the mother church made known their ruling to¬ day In the following statement: \"A complaint against .Mrs. Augusta E. Stetson, of New York City, was llled with the board of directors or the First Chufcj of Christ. Scientist, dn BoiUon on November 6. 1808. She was imme¬ diately furnished wdth a copy of It and a copy of the following orders: '’After considering the evidence and Mrs. Stetson’s statements made to the directors. It was the unanimous con¬ clusion that the charges against her had been proved and were true. Mra Stetson's name was then dropped from the role of membership of said church. ‘•'Hie offenses proved against Mrs, tStetson were of two kinds: \"First, working against the Interests of the members of this church who are not her followers and against the teach¬ ings of this church. \"Second, persisting In teachings and practices which are contrary to Chris¬ tian Science.’* • • • Followera Are Loyal.

It was stated to your corrospondent to-night that on account of his admir¬ ation for the high qualities of Judge Lurton, President Taft has never had In him mind any other man than Judge Lurton for the position.

Nov 18,—The Alsop claim against Chile for ' more than million dollars, w*hfch has been t^nd ing for thirty-flve years, has assumed a critical s;age. Mr. Dawson, the Ameri¬ can Minister to Chile, Is now on his way to Washington, and It Is not Im probable that if the Chilean Government does not consent to a final settlement of the claim within the next few days, or agree to a protocol for reference to The Hague, the American Legation In Santiago will be closed and the archives placed In the hands of the American Consul for safe koeping. Intimation to this effect has been given to Minister Cruse, representing ihe Chilean Oov ernment In Washington. This action on the part of the Slate Department Is not to be taken as a formal severance of diplomatic rela¬ tions, and It Is not probable that Chile will withdraw her Minister from M'oshlngton. No ultimatum has been given Chile, but this Oovornment’i pur- poser Jn withdrawing diplomatic repre¬ sentatives from that country Is In the way bf a forceful protest against the Intvrminablr delays which have char¬ acterised the policy of the Chilean Gov. emmem. What further action may be Uken by the Government at Washington will depend upon the course pursued bv the Cnileans. but It Is not thought probable that Chile will willingly continue to be exhibited before ihtf world as a coun¬ try wb kb mak*‘J ever}' possible ofton to avoid ibe payment or admittedly Just Jebt*. U develops that only a week or ten days ago Minister Dawson entered Into an agreement with the Chilean foreign offices as to the form of a protocol which was to be the basis for a refer¬ ence of the Alsop claim to The Hague tribunal. The Chilean CJovcmmeni. how- ever, refused to comply with the con¬ ditions agreed upon and In effect re¬ pudiated Us own foreign omce.

He says any good man will suit him, Mr Taggart and Gov. Marshall are on the best of terms, and all talk of them bcHng at outs has been olrculatod by the opposition paxty. Gov. Marshall's attitude about the roorganlxation of the copimlttce is that It ought to reorganise Itself. He doesn't want the brewers to reorganixe It, and neither does he want the preachers to do so. He wants every Democrat In the State to have a voice In the reorganixa- tlun. If one la to be made. ^ Changes In State Committee. There will bo several changes In the State committee from present indica¬ tions. but Some of the old menibers will be re-elected w*lthout opposition, among them Dr. T. B. Scales In the- First. Dr. Scales has Just been elected Mayor of Boonvllle. In the Second John Vollmer, Knox county. wlU succeed Allen Pad¬ gett, of Washington. In the Third there Is no opposition to the re-election of Mark Sturen, of Scottsburg. No com¬ mitteeman con be elected from the Third who Is opposed to George Voigt, of Jeffersonville, for Congress, and the feeling among politicians here Is that CongrOasman Cox made a mistake In voting against free hides and that Voigt w'lll beat him for the nomination. In the Fourth district George Pleasants, of Vevay, can be re-elected If ho wants the place, but the Governor has Just appointed him a trustee of the Madison Insane Asylum, and this may Interfere with his re-election. In the Sixth John Gsbom will probably be re-elected. • • • Kem Mentioned. In tl^e Beventh John W. Kem is men tionsd in place of Bernard Korbly, w*ho does not seem to care fur the place. Both Kem and Kortdy are Taggart men, and are attorneys for the former na¬ tional chairman. In the Eighth Lew Elllngham, of Decatur, the Incumbent, and W, H. Elchhorn, of Bluffton. may have a contest. Michael Foley, of the Ninth district, has moved from Craw- fordsvllle to lndianap>olls. and R. C. Huston will probably succeed him. In the Tenth Joseph G. Ibash, of Ham¬ mond. will prolwibly succeed J, Klrl^ Risk, of Lafayette. Mr. Risk unfor¬ tunately opp>i>eed the election of Ms^'or George Durgan. and supported his part ner. afbo Is a Republican. This puls him out of the running, as Mayor Dur- gan was re-elecird Mayor of Lafaj'ette for the fourth lime, notwithstanding the opp}osltlon of Mr. Risk. The remaining members of the committee from the oth¬ er three districts will probably be re¬ elected. • • • The Cbalrmanahip, Beside Peter l^'bley, (Charles Qreat- house, of Indianapolis, and John Voll¬ mer. of Knox county, are mentioned hi connection with the State chairmanship. Vollmer led the fight which carried the election recenllj' In hla county In favor of the wets and ho is said to be a good organizer. While Gov. Marsnall Is not Interfering ho Is known to be very friendly to Peter Foley, of Terre Haute, for State chairman In succession of Mr. Jackson. In no event will the committee be un¬ friendly to Taggart, for Taggart does not wont any office, and the p>arty can not very well do without him. One thing Is certain, the new committee win insist that the brewers and liquor men generally be on the square with the Democratic puirly In the next campaign. The Democrats have the reputation of being the w*hlsky piart in Indiana when the reverse Is the case, the Republlcant getting most of the contributions from the liquor men. • • • Republican Reorganisation. The Republican State cerural commit¬ tee Is algo to be reorganised and It Is said that Harry New will be chairman. The commltteo stands a good chance of lining up In favor of Fairbanks Instead of Beveridge. The Immense patronage Which St'nator Beveridge has at his dis¬ posal sooms to be doing him more harm than gocKb In the meantime, Fair¬ banks Is over In the Far West pre¬ tending not to care, but his friends are active, and former Gov. Diirt>ln Is said to be setting up the pins for him. • • • Man May Be Commisaloner. Frank B. Psyne, of JeffersonvlUe, lo- day sUinds tho best chance of being ap¬ pointed a member of the Indiana Rsll- isoad Commission at a salary of $4,000 a year. When Oov.

Of horrors which they encountered In the ghastly gallery none of the ex¬ plorers would speak, but they wore blanched faces and their hands trem¬ bled when they emerged.
