        "text": "The AAU Is Founded\n\nJanuary 21st, 1888\n\nThe AAU was founded on January 21, 1888, with the goal of creating common standards in amateur sport. Since then, most national championships in the United States have taken place under AAU leadership. From its founding as a publicly supported organization, the AAU has represented US sports within the various international sports federations. It has grown over the years to become one of the leading and most influential associations.\n\nFirst AAU Event Held\n\nApril 6th, 1888\n\nThe AAU conducts its first championships for boxing, fencing and wrestling on April 6 at New York’s Metropolitan Opera House.\n\nFirst Five AAU Associations Created\n\nJanuary 1st, 1890\n\nA.G. Mills, a member of the AAU Board of Governors, introduces a plan which calls for the AAU to reorganize into a union of Associations (now called Districts) rather than an association of clubs. What will later be known as the “Mills Plan” passes unanimously, creating the first five AAU Districts – Atlantic, Central, Metropolitan, New England and Pacific Coast.\n\nAAU National Men's Basketball Championships Held for First Time\n\nJanuary 1st, 1897\n\nThe AAU conducts the first National Men’s Basketball Championship. The winner is the 23rd Street YMCA from New York City.\n\nWomen's Swimming Recognized as Sport\n\nJanuary 1st, 1915\n\nAAU President George J. Turner concludes his national convention address in Baltimore by announcing that women's swimming will be recognized by the organization.\n\nFirst AAU Women's Basketball Tournament Held\n\nApril 1st, 1926\n\nSix teams compete in the inaugural AAU Women’s Basketball tournament held in the Los Angeles Athletics Club crowning the Pasadena Athletic & Country Club Flying Rings as champions.\n\nGolfer Bobby Jones, Jr. Received the First AAU James E. Sullivan Award\n\nMarch 5th, 1930\n\nThe AAU honors golfer Robert Tyre “Bobby” Jones, Jr., as the first recipient of the James E. Sullivan Memorial Award given in recognition of the founder and President of the AAU. Other finalists for the award are Barney Berling (athletics), Clarence De Mar (athletics), Tommy Hitchcock (polo), Helen Madison (swimming), Helen Wills Moody (tennis), Harlon Rothert (all-around), Ray Rudy (swimming), George Simpson (athletics) and Stella Walsh (athletics).\n\nAAU President Withdraws Amendment to Boycott 1935 Olympic Games\n\nJanuary 1st, 1935\n\nFollowing five hours of debate, AAU President Jeremiah T. Mahoney withdraws his proposed amendment to boycott the Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany. Instead, a resolution was passed stating the certification of the U.S. athletes for overseas competition will not be construed to imply endorsement of the Nazi government.\n\nBeginning of AAU Physical Fitness Program\n\nJune 4th, 1942\n\nThe AAU authorizes a program that encourages and monitors physical fitness among America’s school-aged children with the assistance of Dr. Robert Grueninger.\n\nFirst Woman to Receive AAU James E. Sullivan Award\n\nJanuary 1st, 1944\n\nAnn Curtis, an 18-year old swimmer from San Francisco, becomes the first woman to receive the AAU James E. Sullivan Memorial Award. Curtis, who turned down movie offers to continue training for the Olympic Games in London, captured AAU titles in eight events during the year.\n\nJunior Olympics Program Formed\n\nDecember 5th, 1948\n\nA Junior Olympics program designed to develop young athletes in the U.S. is introduced at the AAU Annual Convention on December 5 in New York City and receives approval.
