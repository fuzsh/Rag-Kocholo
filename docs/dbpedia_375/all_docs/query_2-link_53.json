        "text": "As we just learned, in 1905, Hans started his first business with a much older business partner named Alfred James Davis, who was Hans Wilsdorf's brother-in-law. Their company was named Wilsdorf & Davis and they specialized in selling watches and watch parts. The photo below is the placard sign that was placed on the outside of the front door of Wilsdorf & Davis headquarters in London, England.\n\nThe image below appears courtesy of Rolex and shows a young Hans Wilsdorf in 1906 pictured third from the left, behind the tree, holding a cup of tea. I am not 100% certain, but I believe it is very likely that is his sister Ana Wilsdorf next to him, along with her husband, Alfred James Davis, who was Hans Wilsdorf's brother in law and partner in Wilsdorf & Davis!\n\nIn 1908, Hans Wilsdorf registered the name of Rolex as a trademark for Wilsdorf & Davis Ltd., and the image below, which appears courtesy of David Boettcher is the official registration from July 2nd of 1908.\n\nIn the next photo below, we see Hans Wilsdorf commuting on a horse-driven bus through London, England in 1908. Hans Wilsdorf said in 1958, on the 50th anniversary of Rolex history:\n\n\"I tried combining the letters of the alphabet in every possible way. This gave some hundred names, but none of them felt quite right. It was one morning when I was sitting on the upper level of a double-decker powered at that time by horses, driving along Cheapside in London, that a good genie whispered in my ear: \"Rolex.\" A few days after this fruitful journey, the Rolex brand was filed, and then officially registered in Switzerland by Wilsdorf & Davis.\"\n\nAl, who goes by \"Alcan\" on RolexForums.com, sent in the next two photos of his 1908 Wilsdorf & Davis pendant watch, that he recently had restored. It was made the same year that Hans Wilsdorf registered the Rolex trademark.\n\nIn the photo below we see the \"W&D\" engraving etched into the back of Alcan's 1908 Wilsdorf & Davis pendant watch. This is a really fascinating story, and you can learn much more about the details of how he restored this beautiful watch.\n\nAs we learned, Hans Wilsdorf was born, Hans Eberhard Wilhelm Wilsdorf on March 22, 1881, in Kulmbach, Bavaria (which is now part of Germany) to Ferdinand and Anna Wilsdorf. Unfortunately, Hans Wilsdorf's parents passed away unexpectedly when he was only 12 years old. Hans and his two siblings went from living a sheltered life with his parents to live with his maternal uncles.\n\nHans attended a boarding school in Coburg and went on to attend business school in Bayreuth before he left Bavaria at the end of the 20th century. Hans Wilsdorf's mother was a descendant of the popular Maisel brewing family–but he was not interested in going into the brewing business. Hans was to inherit a significant amount of money from his parent's estate, but it was stolen when he was a child, so he had to fend for himself.\n\nHans moved to Geneva, Switzerland to work for a pearl dealer. He then went to work for Cuna Korten in La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1900. Cuna Korten was a fancy Swiss company that specialized in exporting Swiss pocket watches. Since Hans spoke English, German and French he was responsible for handling the business correspondence which helped him later in understanding international strategic marketing.\n\nHans was also responsible for winding several hundred watches daily and monitoring their accuracy. Cuna Korten was a large and profitable organization and being exposed to all those watches obviously resulted in Hans developing severe WISitus as well as a very deep appreciation for precision and beauty.\n\nCuna Korten obtained the majority of their merchandise from vendors in France, Germany, and Switzerland. While at Cuna Korten, Hans became obsessed with creating perfect watches. Hans then had to go back to Germany to serve in the Army in 1902. When he got out of the German Army he moved to London, England where he met and fell in love with his wife, Florence Frances May Wilsdorf—Crotty, and went on to become a British Citizen. The image below is from the 1911 Census of England and Wales and if you look closely on line 7, you can see Hans Wilsdorf's information including the fact he was 30 years old in 1911. This was obviously taken prior to him getting married later in the same year, and it appears courtesy of The National Archives in London England.\n\nFlorence Frances May Wilsdorf—Crotty\n\nHans Wilsdorf's first wife\n\nHans Eberhard Wilhelm Wilsdorf got married to Florence Frances May Crotty on Thursday, April 13, 1911 in the Croydon Borough of South London at Saint Paul's Cathedral. Saint Paul's Cathedral sits on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is one of the most iconic and famous sights. Saint Paul's is also very famous as it held Sir Winston Churchill's funeral services, as well as hosting the wedding of Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer.\n\nThe photo below is of Hans Wilsdorf's first wife, who passed away on April 26, 1944 in London. Hans Wilsdorf was completely devastated by the loss of his beloved wife and turned his focus toward Rolex. After May Wilsdorf passed away, Hans Wilsdorf transferred 100% of his shares in Rolex to the Wilsdorf Foundation, which owns and runs Rolex today. The image below appears courtesy of Gisbert L. Brunner.\n\nRolex to this day has a British sensibility as well as a Teutonic and logical German disposition, coupled with the conservative Swiss disposition–this all comes from its founder, Hans Wilsdorf.\n\nFrom a design perspective, Hans' design ethos and aesthetic were far more German than French, Italian or Swiss and I argue this is still true to this day. In other words, Rolex design to this day is more Germanic than anything else. As a matter of fact, Hans was chauffeured in a Mercedes for many years of his life and the CEO of Rolls Royce kept trying to get him to switch but he refused. Hans was German to the core as were his masterpiece Teutonic Rolex watches.\n\nNowhere Man\n\nTime After Time\n\nIt is interesting to note Hans Wildorf was brought up in the Protestant faith. In Bavaria, he lived in an area that was primarily Catholic, and he was constantly teased by boys who were part of the primarily Catholic faith so he was treated as an outsider.\n\nAt age 33, in 1914, a decade after Hans moved to England and began to build Wilsdorf & Davis, World War I broke out and the British citizenry developed a severe hatred of the German's. Since Hans was of German descent, with a German name and accent, he was looked down upon, which is likely one of the reasons he moved Rolex's headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland and moved to Geneva himself.\n\nDespite the fact Hans Wilsdorf had registered the Rolex trademark in 1908, he continued using the Wilsdorf & Davis Ltd. name in England, and it is very likely he formally changed the name to The Rolex Watch Company Ltd. in 1915 in response to the English conflict with the Germans. In other words, the name \"Wilsdorf\" was clearly German, and since England was at war with Germany, German names were frowned upon.\n\nWhen we think of the Rolex brand today, we think of it as one of the most established Swiss brands, which is steeped in Swiss tradition, but for at least the first half of Rolex's existence, it was looked down upon by the Swiss watchmaking establishment. Rolex was considered an alien company or an outsider, which made Hans work that much harder to achieve success and ultimately greatness.\n\nHans Wilsdorf's Great Challenge\n\nTime Will Tell\n\nMankind began trying to keep time for many thousands of years. Ancient civilizations used all kinds of crude methods for trying to keep time, including the measurement of motion of stars in the night sky.\n\nFive thousand years ago, the ancient Sumerians created a calendar that divided the year into 12 months with 30 days each. Other cultures used sun clocks and sundials that told the time by measuring shadows, and later mankind began measuring time by measuring the elapsed time using an hourglass which measured how quickly sand could fall through a skinny tube–from one chamber to another.\n\nIn Europe, the great cathedral's were the first to have clocks that would allow passers-by to tell the time.\n\nThen the development of the pocket-watch in 16th century Tudor, England changed everything. The challenge with the first pocket watches is they were very large and did not keep very accurate time.\n\nIn the 17th century, pocket watches evolved and became more precise, and were slowly adopted by wealthy men who could afford them.\n\nFor the first time, two men could accurately synchronize their actions with a device they carried in their vest. The pocket-watch changed everything.\n\nDespite the fact Hans Wilsdorf was responsible for the popularization of the wristwatch, he was also a huge collector of pocket watches. As a matter of fact, the pocket watch below is from Hans Wilsdorf's personal collection that contains pocket watches going back 400 years.\n\nThe pocket watch below was made in 1665 in Germany by Jeremias Flug of Passau. The watch is fully enameled and the form has silver-set turquoise, and the back enamel depicts the Departure of Ulysses.\n\nThe most fascinating detail on the pocket watch below is the original pocket watches only had one hand which was an hour hand. Second hands did not come along for many years and were really the first complication on a pocket-watch. I think there is a simple elegance to a one-handed watch. To learn more about the Hans Wilsdorf Pocketwatch Collection please click here.\n\nWhen Hans Wilsdorf started his first watch company in London in 1905 with his brother-in-law it was named Wilsdorf and Davis. At the time, pocket-watches were everywhere and wrist-watches and pendant-watches were only worn by ladies. The first wristwatches were simply pocket watches with wire lugs soldered onto the pocket-watch case.\n\nAll pocket watches had the same basic snap-back case construction for hundreds of years and this created a challenge in humid, tropical environments. The challenge was the dust and moisture and perspiration would penetrate the watch case and corrode the watch from the inside.\n\nLet's return to Hans Wilsdorf telling his story:\n\n\"For fourteen years I undertook the financial side and management of our concern. From the very outset, our success was assured by our fundamental policy to trade only in specialty horological products and especially in new lines.\n\nThe first specialty we adopted was the traveling watch, called a portfolio watch, cased in the finest quality leathers; this line I immediately placed in large quantities on the market, the range covering every possible style and design. However, even at that time, my chief concern was the wristlet watch to which I devoted all my youthful energy and optimism which has never been belied.\n\nAt that period, the wristlet watch not at all popular; in fact, it was an object of derision, the idea of wearing a watch on one's wrist being contrary to the conception of masculinity. Then, too, watchmakers all over the world remained skeptical as to its possibilities and believed that this newfangled object was bound to prove a failure.\n\nTheir arguments against the wristlet watch were, inter alia, the following:\n\nFirstly, the mechanism required by this type of watch must of necessity be small and delicate and could therefore never withstand the violent gestures of hand and arm. Secondly, dust and damp would rapidly spoil the mechanism, even if it were well constructed.\n\nThirdly, accuracy and regularity of working could never be attained with so small a movement.\n\nIn spite of all this, I kept my faith in the wristlet watch and was determined to see what could be done in England, that country of sportsmen par excellence. It seemed to me that here my chances of success were the greatest.\n\nThe task I undertook meant the overcoming of enormous difficulties. And yet today, after 40 years of striving, it seems to me that I have surmounted them and I believe that, in doing so, I have contributed to the development of the watchmaking industry in general.\"\n\nThe Wristlet Watch\n\nTurning-Point Of My Career\n\n\"The Swiss watchmaking industry has benefited greatly by the introduction of this new product more so than that of other countries, because it was in a better position to follow the rapid rise and development of this modern fashion.\n\nGenerally speaking, the wristlet watch was bound to bring about a certain revolution in the industry: a naturally caused an increase in sales, not only on account of its novelty, but also because by its very nature it called for more frequent renewal.\n\nMore exposed to damage than the pocket watch, it was not of the type to become a ”family heirloom” handed down from father to son for several generations. Apart from this, being worn on the wrist, it was destined to become, more than any of its predecessors, a modish accessory, and object submitted to the vagaries of fashion, that is to say, calling for change and variety.\n\nAgain, the wristlet watch is the type of article of which each individual likes to have not only one, but several; men and, still more, women wish to have a selection of watches suitable for different occasions, for work or the social round, or to harmonize with their attire.\n\nI had very early realized the manifold possibilities of the wristlet watch and, feeling sure that they would materialize in time, I resolutely went on my way. Rolex was thus able to get several years ahead of other watch manufacturers who persisted in clinging to the pocket watch as their chief product.\n\nIn 1902, during my stay at La Chaux-de-Fonds, I heard that Hermann Aegler of Bienne had started the regular and mechanized manufacture of ebauches (or rough movements) for a small lever escapement movement.\n\nMy interest even then had been roused by this innovation and, as the mechanism had proved very successful from a technical point of view as well as being accessible in price, I had got into touch with the head of the firm in view of launching this article in England and elsewhere.\n\nAfter founding my firm in 1905, I went to Bienne and placed with Hermann Aegler the largest order ever booked for wristlet watches at the time. The order amounted to several hundred thousand Swiss francs.\n\nThis was the first step forward in our climb to success with which, indeed, the factory in Bienne is closely connected. Over a very long period, I traveled to Bienne from London several times a year, bringing my collaborators new and personal ideas, demanding that they be realized.\n\nIn this way, hundreds of models were conceived and launched on Empire markets and in the Far East. The new fashion watches became extremely popular, in Australia and New Zealand especially.\n\nThere was so much to be done, however. In fact, I may say that I had to start from scratch. The first line I placed on the market was a series of silver watches with leather straps for men's and ladies' wear. Their success was immediate and the range had to be widened as soon as the first models came out, so I presented a selection of designs in gold.\n\nNext came the idea of expanding bracelets, which an important jewelry firm invented and launched in about 1906. This too won the approval of our British clientele. From that time on, our little gold watch became increasingly popular throughout the Empire.\n\nAnd this is how both a new fashion and a great commercial success sprang from an apparently foolhardy idea. Soon we were placing orders for tens of thousands of pieces and, to the uninformed, must have appeared extremely audacious young people.\"\n\nWhat's In A Name?\n\n\"By 1908, Wilsdorf & Davis had become one of the leading firms in the British watch trade. It was time to think of giving our watches a name of their own, a trade name which could be inscribed on the dials.\n\nAs a matter of fact, such innovation ran counter to a very old tradition of the English watch trade. Ever since the XVIIIth century, the leading watch importers of the country had always insisted on featuring their own name and no other on the dials or movements and, when I came forward with my new idea, the opposition I encountered seemed insuperable.\n\nHowever, I was well aware that, unless I succeeded in making our watch known under its own name, our prospects would be limited. The name chosen provided in itself an excellent point in our favor.” Rolex”–a short yet significant word, not cumbersome on the dial (thus leaving room enough for the inscription of the English trader's name) and, above all, a word easy to memorize.\n\nIt (Rolex) has a pleasant sound and its pronunciation remains unvaried in whatever European language is spoken.\n\nDespite the qualities of this trade name, it took 20 years of hard work to make the idea acceptable in England. At first, I ventured to inscribe it on one watch in every six; then it appeared on two, and later three, in every six. This half victory was still unsatisfactory and we knew that it would take many more years to obtain the desired results.\n\nTired of waiting, in 1925, I decided to launch the \"Rolex” trademark by means of an intensive advertising campaign. The policy entailed an annual expenditure of more than 12,000 British pounds–not for one year alone, but for several in succession. One of the results thus obtained was that dealers agreed first that four, and later five, out of every six watches should bear the name of \"Rolex.\"\n\nAt last, in 1927, the waterproof “Rolex–Oyster\" was launched and we were then in a position to announce definitively that in the future not one of our watches would ever again leave our work without our name on the dial, inside the case and on the movement.\n\nIn the same year, certain watch dealers were selected in each town (one or more according to the size of the locality), to whom the sales monopoly our watches was granted. In order to help these dealers, we devised special window displays which soon became known throughout the whole of England and gave the buying public great pleasure.\n\nTheir chief feature was an aquarium forming a centerpiece in which, among the water plants and goldfish, was plunged the \"Oyster\"–the watch as watertight as an oyster.\n\nAnother red–letter day the development of our firm was when a small Rolex wristlet watch, 25 MM in diameter, won a class “A” certificate at the famous Kew Observatory. This was on July 15, 1914, a day I shall never forget.\"\n\nA Hard Blow\n\nWhen the first World War broke out in 1914, the wristlet watch had already won the favor of the Anglo-Saxon public. Up to 1915, London was our export center for every market in the world. Indeed, by 1914, our firm had grown to such an extent that we were occupying a large suite of offices and had a payroll of more than 60 employees.\n\nHowever, when in the next year a 33.3% customs duty was suddenly decreed by the British government, we found ourselves faced with the necessity of transferring our export organization to our own offices in Bienne which we had opened three years previously in order to facilitate our very close business relationship with Mr. Aegler.\n\nFrom that time on, our headquarters at Bienne became the central checking and reception offices for all watches destined for export to London and elsewhere.\"\n\nA New Departure\n\n\"It was in 1919 that I finally founded at Geneva, in the offices we still occupy today, our present company, the Rolex Watch Co. Ltd., of which I am sole proprietor.\n\nThis decision was taken in order to enable our Bienne factory to devote itself entirely to the manufacture of watch movements, while we in Geneva could design and launch our watches according to the traditional style of the “City of Watchmaking”.\n\nIn other words, the Rolex movement is made in Bienne, but the Rolex watch is a Genevan creation. In Geneva, too, every detail of the movement is submitted to yet another careful and most minute checking.\n\nThe years immediately following the first Great War, indeed until 1926, proved extremely difficult for the watchmaking industry as a whole, and yet Rolex continued to prosper and to consolidate its position on world markets. This privilege must be attributed to the firm's preponderance in the manufacture of quality precision wristlet watches.\"\n\nThe Snap-Back Case\n\n1914\n\n\"My personal opinion...is that pocket watches will almost completely disappear and that wrist watches will replace them definitively! I am not mistaken in this opinion and you will see that I am right.\" –Hans Wilsdorf, 1914\n\nThe following five images are from James Dowling & Jeff Hess' book The Best Of Time and they help illustrate the evolution of the watch to make it waterproof.\n\nThe following letter handwriting was taken from a letter than Hans Wilsdorf wrote in his own handwriting in 1914, and it is translated into the gold text above.\n\nThis first image below is a snap-back Rebberg Rolex watch from 1914. Essentially it is a pocket watch on a leather strap.\n\nIf you look closely at the image above, you notice the watch has a hinge on the left side of the case. If you flip the watch around onto its face (as seen below) you notice if you open the rear door it exposes the movement. (Note: the snap-back door on the photo below is not in sharp focus, but it is on the left edge of the photo sitting upright, perpendicular to the case). The challenge is, there is no seal or gasket to stop dust, perspiration, water or humidity from entering the case.\n\nSnap-Front Hunting Case\n\nPictured below is another Rolex wristwatch from 1915, this time with a snap front Hunting Case and if you look closely you notice it is simply a pocket-watch with lugs soldered onto the case, along with a leather piece sewn onto the wired lugs–very primitive and fragile by today's standards.\n\nThe reason it had the snap front case-cover was to help protect the glass crystal from getting cracked when a gentleman went hunting.\n\nIt is important to note, prior to World War I, wrist watches for men did not exist. Ladies wore watches on straps around their wrist and on pendants attached to their dresses, but men wore their pocket watches on a chain, and they kept their pocket watches in the vest pocket of their suit.\n\nDuring the early twentieth century, when a man was asked what he thought about wearing a watch on his wrist (known at the time as a wristlet) one man remarked he wouldn't be caught doing such an unrefined thing. He said you would be as likely to catch him in a dress as you would wearing a \"wristlet.\"\n\nWhen you examine these first generation wristwatches, with the skinny strap, you can kind of understand why men would have thought they were feminine at the time.\n\nWhen men went to fight in World War I, having a precise timing tool on their person, to synchronize events, became invaluable. In other words, if one army had precise timekeeping instruments, they could more easily coordinate when to fire, or move. The pocket watch and later the wristwatch would become an indispensable weapon in modern warfare.\n\nSo let's say a platoon of soldiers was scheduled to all begin firing at 3PM, each soldier would regularly ping his pocket watch to see what time it was.\n\nThe challenge was if you were a soldier living and fighting in a trench, and you had to keep your pocket watch in your vest, and it was freezing cold in the trench, in order to time events, you would have to carefully put down your rifle, take-off your gloves, unbutton your trench-coat, unbutton your coat and reach in your pocket, while holding your rifle in the other hand—often times while shivering from exposure and the cold temperature.\n\nSo once the solider got to his pocket watch, he would see the time and very quickly have to rebutton his jacket, overcoat, and put back on his gloves, then pick up his rifle to be prepared to shoot. Often times this process was so traumatizing by the time the soldier got redressed and aimed his rifle, he would have already forgotten what time it was. This process was, to say the least, clumsy, laborious and time-consuming.\n\nRare photo of a British soldier wearing a wristwatch in 1917 During World War I\n\nConversely, with a wristwatch, the same soldier, while aiming with his rifle, could simply rotate his wrist 180 degrees and glance at his wrist, even if he had gloves on. Ironically, in a twist of fate, the modern wristwatch we take for granted today was born of war and began its life as a professional timing tool and war machine.\n\nWilsdorf & Davis Invoice\n\n1918\n\nThis very rare Wilsdorf & Davis invoice from 1918 when Rolex was still headquartered in London, England appears courtesy of The S3C Private Collection. It offers interesting insight into how Hans Wilsdorf positioned the Rolex brand at the time. Keep in mind that World War 1 began on July 28, 1914 and went on for 4 years, 3 months and 2 weeks, and ended on November 11, 1918, thus this invoice was created 5 months before World War 1 ended. The invoice was Wilsdorf & Davis selling watch parts to a store in St. Johns, in Newfoundland. Newfoundland is an island located off Canada's Atlantic Coast, and St. John's is the capital.\n\nThe Hermetically-Sealed Case\n\nThe Photos below show a hermetic Rolex 'Submarine' watch made in 1922. Note it's NOT named 'Submariner', but 'Submarine' as it was based upon the same principle as a Submarine hatch that would spin open and closed like a jar lid. It was called a Hermetic watch as this new style of watch completely protected the entire movement, and notice, when it is sealed the watch winding crown, is hidden inside the watch. This case design was originally patented by Jean Finger in 1921, and Hans Wilsdorf later purchased the rights to the patent.\n\nThere is a great deal of confusion and controversy about the evolution of the \"Waterproof Watch\" and David Boettcher, who is a superb horological historian who wrote a amazing article on this subject named \"The Evolution of the Waterproof Watch\", which I highly recommend reading!!!\n\nThink of a Hermetically sealed watch as being very similar to a jar lid (with a round glass aperture window) screwed on a jar. Once the lid is screwed into place, it forms an impervious barrier. No liquid can get in or out of the jar when the lid is securely screwed into place. (This, of course, is if you do not submerge the watch in deep water. At some point, without a gasket the case would fail and let water in).\n\nThis hermetic watch design was revolutionary at the time as it only consisted of two pieces. Basically, you would spin the threaded cap off the front of the watch like a jar lid. The challenge was, in order to change the time or wind the watch–every day–you had to spin-off the top, every time, and then, spin it back on afterward. Even though it worked, this design was short-lived as it was a bit like having the on-off switch for the windshield wipers in the glove compartment of your car.\n\nNotice the face of the cap has a machined or fluted edge to make it easy to grip. Another challenge, was, that over time, the fluted bezel would wear down, so if you used it for a long time, eventually, you would no longer be able to grip the face to twist it off.\n\nThis machined edge or fluted bezel is the genesis for the fluted bezels on modern Rolex watches, including the Day-Date, Datejust and even on the sports Rolex professional models like the Submariner and GMT Master.\n\nNote the wire lugs are soldered to the case, so the only way to replace the leather strap was to cut off the old strap and sew on the new strap. I think people got lazy with sewing the strap in place, and as you can see in the image below, they simply sewed across the strap horizontally, as you can see at the bottom of the strap.\n\nHermetically sealed watches had a really interesting look since the winding crown was hidden in the case. Also, notice in the photo of the hermetically sealed Rolex above the fluting is not worn down. That's because this watch is steel, which is much harder than gold (like the two watches pictured above this one).\n\nRolex Movement Factory\n\nBienne, Switzerland\n\n1925\n\nLet's get in the Rolex Time Machine and go back to Switzerland in 1925, and take a look around to see what Rolex looked like. 1925 was a very good year for Rolex. Rolex was just putting the finishing touches on the worlds first waterproof watch they were just preparing to bring to market a year later in 1926.\n\nThe photo above and the two photos below were taken at low altitude from an airplane or hot air balloon in the mid 1920s in Bienne, Switzerland and show the original /Rolex movement factory, which was part of the Aegler S.A. company.\n\nIt is amazing when you look at these photos, and you can't help but notice how few structures there were in downtown Bienne, Switzerland. Right-click on these images and open them in another browser window so you can see all the crazy HD resolution! I don't think anybody has ever seen these photos before, and it was actually Jose from Perezcope.com who found and shared them with me, when he was doing research!\n\nThe Real History of The Waterproof Watch\n\nThere is a great deal of confusion and controversy about the evolution of the \"Waterproof Watch\", and how it came to be. Over the past decade I have interviewed David Boettcher several times. David Boettcher is a superb horological historian who wrote an amazing article on this subject named \"The Evolution of the Waterproof Watch\", which I very highly recommend reading!!! David Boettcher wrote in the above linked article (text in blue italics):\n\n\"On 30 October 1925 in La Chaux de Fonds, Switzerland, Paul Perregaux and Georges Perret applied for a Swiss patent for a winding system where the crown could be screwed down on to the case to create a waterproof seal. The patent was granted and published on 17 May 1926. There seems to be very little known about Perregaux and Perret, who are sometimes described as watchmakers and prototype makers.\"\n\nPerregaux & Perret Patent 114948\n\nScrew Down Waterproof Gasket Seal Winding Crown Invention\n\nFiled on October 30, 1925 in La Chaux de Fonds, Switzerland\n\nImage Appears Courtesy of David Boettcher\n\n\"When Hans Wilsdorf found out about this patent he bought all rights in July 1926 and had the patent assigned to him.\"\n\nLa Fédération Horologère Suisse Transfer Record\n\nOriginal Perregaux & Perret Patent Transfer to Hans Wilsdorf\n\nFiled on July 28, 1926 in La Chaux de Fonds, Switzerland\n\nImage Appears Courtesy of David Boettcher\n\n\"Wilsdorf then registered the design as British patent No. 260554 on 1 September 1926, published on 21 April 1927, and in Germany No. 443386, and the United States No. 1,661,232.\"\n\nDavid Boettcher discovered and published the original Rolex Oyster Registration which is seen below that shows Hans Wilsdorf filed the 'OYSTER' name designation on July 29, 1926:\n\nSome people might argue Rolex did not invent the waterproof Oyster watch per se, and certainly there is evidence to support this case (Pun intended :-)\n\nThat being said, Hans Wilsdorf and his Rolex team members didn't simply build the design Perregaux and Perret innovated as it left much to be desired. Instead, Rolex watchmakers significantly modified the design and perfected it for the final mile to make it practical for the marketplace and bring it to its logical conclusion. This resulted in Hans Wilsdorf filing a Patent on October 18, 1926, which was granted on June 16, 1927 by the Swiss Patent Office (Patent Number 120848) for the updated design that incorporated a number of improvements.\n\nIn the final analysis what really matters is Hans Wilsdorf understood the opportunity better than anybody else, and invested heavily in developing the technology to bring it the waterproof wrist watch to the marketplace.\n\nSo let's get back to Hans Wilsdorf sharing more amazing details of his story:\n\nThe Secret Of Success\n\n\"On looking back into the past, I find that, in developing and extending my business, I have always had certain aims in mind, of course from which I never deviated. Perhaps these aims can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.) To create watch designs suitable for both men and women.\n\n2.) To standardize a range of movements of different sizes.\n\n3.) To obtain so high a degree of quality, that our watches, whatever the caliber, should be recognized as “Chronometers” by the Observatories.\n\n4.) To give current models the benefit of the results and improvements obtained with specially constructed high precision specimens.\n\n5.) To maintain this high degree of precision by protecting the movements against the penetration of dust and impurities, the danger to which the wristwatch is particularly exposed.\n\nThis last point presented a problem which could only be resolved by protecting the movement against all outside influences. To my technical assistants, my constant refrain was, from the earliest days: “We must succeed in making a watch case so tight that our movements will be permanently guaranteed against damage caused by dust, perspiration, water, heat, and cold. Only then will the perfect accuracy of the Rolex watch be secured.\"\n\nThis seemingly insoluble problem has been solved. After years of untiring research, and at the cost of innumerable difficulties, the waterproof case was finally created in 1926. This invention was applied exclusively to the Rolex watch, was also the first realization of the permanently waterproof watch—and still is.\n\nThe fact that, like an oyster, it can remain an unlimited time underwater without detriment to its parts, gave me the idea of christening it the “Rolex-Oyster\", the name under which it has become famous throughout the world.\n\nIt was on October 7, 1927, that the \"Rolex-Oyster” underwent the ordeal which was to justify its name. On that day, Mercedes Gleitze, a young London stenographer, swam the Channel in 15 hours 15 minutes, and with her went a faithful companion, the Rolex–Oyster. Imagine the surprise of the reporters present at her landing, when they found that the watch was still running as perfectly as if it had never left dry land.\n\nThe event caused a sensation at the time, for the waterproof watch was still unknown to the general public. On November 27, 1927, I reserved the front page of the “Daily Mail” (at a cost of 1600 British Pounds) for an advertisement proclaiming the success of the first waterproof watch. This was the first step in the triumphant rise to fame of the “Rolex-Oyster\".\n\nThe Perpetual Oyster & The Mermaid\n\nIn a span of 5 years from 1926 to 1931, Rolex and Hans Wilsdorf would create and successfully patent two major horology milestones, which would forever set Rolex apart; the Rolex Oyster waterproof watch-case, and the Rolex Perpetual Movement. In 1925, Rolex would also create and register their famous trademark logo of the Rolex five-point logo crown.\n\nThe Art-Deco era was a time of tremendous growth for Rolex, so much so, there are many art-deco elements which remain today as part of their current design language.\n\nThe Rolex Oyster is perhaps the most revolutionary and profound development in watch history. The following patent application was filed by Hans Wilsdorf on behalf of Rolex in 1926:\n\nHow Does A Rolex Oyster Case Work?\n\nThe next photo perfectly illustrates how the original Rolex Oyster case was designed, constructed and assembled. Notice the fluted bezel, just like with the one on the previously examined hermetic case, screws down onto the inner-case as does the case-back. The actual Oyster case itself was milled from a solid piece of gold, as all Rolex Oyster watch cases are to this day.\n\nThe next photo in this story (after Wilsdorf's continuing storytelling) is the actual first Rolex Oyster made in 1926, which was made out of yellow gold. This art-deco masterpiece wristwatch changed everything!!!\n\nWas it the first professional dive watch in history? In many ways, yes and in many ways no, as we will soon see. More than anything it was a watch you could take swimming without damaging.\n\nLet's get back to Hans Wilsdorf's story told in his own words:\n\nThe Crowning Of A Life's Work\n\n\"The logical outcome of the “Oyster” was the creation of the \"Perpetual\" watch, whose movement is self–winding and guaranteed to run without interruption. This idea had, of course, preoccupied many famous horologists of the past. The creation of the \"Perpetual\" driven from the famous “Rotor\" was definitely perfected by Rolex in 1931.\n\nThe waterproof watch had in itself marked a great step forward toward the realization of this new achievement: an automatic watch can function with the utmost regularity only if the movement is placed in a waterproof case.\n\nThese two inventions gave a renewed impetus to the Swiss watchmaking industry. Stimulated by the success of the \"Rolex-Oyster\" and the \"Rolex-Perpetual\", other manufacturers followed in the construction of waterproof and automatic watches and, as a result, millions of pieces of this type have been exported throughout the world. They are now universally known and form an integral element of modern life.\n\nIt has been my belief that the watch of the future is the “perpetual” watch, in other words, the automatic or self-winding watch. In this field too, Rolex has been a pioneer. Without the waterproof watch, the ”Perpetual\" could never have been discovered.\n\nMoreover, had Rolex not obtained a perfect mechanism as regards precision and regularity, the disrepute into which the idea of the automatic watch had fallen after a long series of unsuccessful attempts in the past would have proved an insuperable obstacle against its ever coming into favor.\n\nThe conclusive experiments to which the \"Perpetual\" movement has been submitted have made it possible for our technical department to bring out the movement in three different sizes and a wide range of models, both for ladies and men's wear, is now on the market.\n\nOn the occasion of our 1945 Jubilee, we had the pleasure of announcing our latest \"Perpetual\" creation, the largest and most robust of our models: the\"Rolex Datejust.\"\n\nOn examining the major characteristics and details of this new creation, it cannot but be admitted that it is a masterpiece of horological science. It is, in fact, a synthesis of all that has been achieved up to the present day.\n\n\"Rolex Datejust\" is the only automatic, absolutely waterproof watch in which the date is shown through the small aperture without needing a special hand.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to an ingenious method of fixing the hairspring, all danger of the coils being damaged by shock and causing mal-adjustment is eliminated. This is a considerable advantage in the most interesting feature for sportsmen. further, this device also allows for much closer timing or adjustment of the movement in the different testing positions.\"\n\nAgainst Wind And Tide\n\nFrom its earliest beginnings until September 21st, 1931, Rolex's had never suffered any set-back or regression. The devaluation of sterling nevertheless spelled catastrophe for the firm. Our prices had always been quoted in English currency and, when they had to be adapted to the new value of sterling, exports decreased by two thirds.\n\nWe, therefore, had to make a gigantic drive in order to find new channels of trade other than the Empire markets on which we had previously concentrated most of our efforts.\n\nWe then decided to set up a house in Paris, the better to study the French market; similarly at Buenos Ayres, for the Argentine. At the same time, we developed the Italian market in conjunction with the technical workshop in Milan.\n\nWe also decided to organize business trips to all South American countries, to the West-Indies, the Far East and especially to China and Japan. In brief, no possibility was ever overlooked and hundreds of thousands of Swiss francs were expended in order to win these new world markets and to reestablish the firm on a sound footing.\n\nThat we succeeded in our efforts was also due to the really unique performance of our chronometers, especially in tests at the Kew Observatory. In effect, up to 1939, Rolex obtained the best timing results recorded by this institution for the whole of the wrist-watchmaking industry and for all sizes, from the smallest ladies watch to our \"Prince\" caliber.\n\nTwice, in 1925 in 1927, the official annual report mentioned the remarkable performance of the two smallest Rolex calibers. One of these obtained the best result ever registered for so minute a movement: 86.5 points and dimension \"especially good.\"\n\nA Pledge For The Future\n\nOn summing up the reasons underlying universal prestige Rolex enjoys today, I find–apart from the chronometric value of our movements–that they must be attributed to three factors: firstly, to the \"Oyster\" known everywhere as the permanently waterproof watch, for the making of which no plastic material whatsoever are used; secondly, to our increasingly popular automatic, \"Perpetual\" and, lastly, to our constant care to bring out new and pleasing models, sober and harmonious design and in true Genevan style. The\n\nAnd our task is not yet finished; we intend to intensify our efforts. But what has been achieved in the past serves to strengthen my faith in the future and my conviction that the fame of Rolex will prove worthy of the position it has one in the world.\" –Hans Wilsdorf 1946\n\nThe Evolution Of The Revolution\n\nSo what makes a Rolex Oyster an Oyster? The winding crown acts like a screw-on cap, or micro jar-lid, and has watertight gaskets in it. The best way to think of it is to imagine a submarine hatch that is threaded and has to be twisted or spun open or closed.\n\n\"Like an Oyster, it can remain an unlimited time underwater without detriment to its parts.\" –Hans Wilsdorf\n\nIn 1926, at age 45, Hans Wilsdorf had successfully designed, manufactured and patented the waterproof Rolex Oyster. The challenge he faced was, how to communicate the value proposition of such a product?\n\nHans came up with the idea of associating the fantasy of mermaids with the waterproof Rolex Oyster as seen in the 1926 Italian Rolex advertisement seen below.\n\n1926 French Rolex Mermaid Oyster Poster\n\nAt the same time, as seen in the Rolex illustration below, Hans Wilsdorf came up with a brilliant idea to have authorized Rolex dealers display the waterproof Rolex Oysters watches, in fish-tanks, in their windows–with real fish swimming around the watch!!! This, of course, gained the fascination of many passer-bys.\n\nIn 1927, Hans Wilsdorf learned about a swimmer named Mercedes Gleitze, who claimed to have been the first woman to swim all the way across the English channel. He also read about how another woman claimed to achieve the same feat soon after, in even less time. The second woman, soon afterward, admitted she lied.\n\nAs a result, people pointed the finger at Mercedes Gleitze and accused her of lying as well. Mercedes was enraged by the accusation, and declared, that she would \"vindicate\" herself, but swimming it a second time.\n\nUpon learning of this upcoming event, Hans Wilsdorf contacted Mercedes Gleitze and offered to hire her as the first Rolex ambassador to endorse the brand, by wearing a Rolex Oyster (strangely, on a necklace) on her vindication swim across the English Channel.\n\nThe photo below was taken on the beach in France, as Mercedes dove into the water to begin her \"vindication\" swim. To learn all the details of the Mercedes Gleitze vindication swim, please click here.\n\nThe challenge with Mercedes Gleitze's \"vindication\" swim was that after 10 hours, she only made it about 4/5 of the way across the channel and had to be pulled-out since she almost froze to death. The vindication swim was not a complete success, but the Rolex Oyster, strapped around her neck, came out of the water in perfect working order.\n\nThe photo below is of Mercedes Gleitze's actual Rolex Oyster which she wore around her neck, during her vindication swim."
