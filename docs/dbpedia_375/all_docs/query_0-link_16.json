There’s our culture guide for the sunny season, and interviews with Bridgerton star Luke Thompson ahead of the new season launch of the smash-hit series; Shoshana Stewart, the inspiring CEO of Turquoise Mountain; and Georgia Scott, founder of GroundTruth, the bag brand making a difference with its use of recycled plastic. The issue also contains The Aesthetic Guide, our annual special, edited by Annabel Jones, and focusing on the latest, most innovative developments in tweakments, as well as our doctor directory. Plus, we take a look at Africa in our travel section, and Simon de Burton reviews the latest releases in the watch world."
