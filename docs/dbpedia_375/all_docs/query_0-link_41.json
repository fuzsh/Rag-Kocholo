We have not, of course, solved any of the problems. We have merely initiated a dialogue about them – a broad interdisciplinary conversation we hope will continue for a very long time. George Rousseau Oxford, England x\n\nNotes on the Contributors Caterina Albano holds a PhD in Renaissance Studies. She has focused her research primarily on the cultural significance of food and its denial in the early-modern period, publishing various articles on the subject. She has also edited the volume by Hannah Woolley, The Gentlewoman’s Companion (2001). She is currently working for the art consultancy Wallace /Kemp Artakt, and has worked on various exhibition projects exploring the links been the art and science, including ‘Spectacular Bodies: the Art and Science of the Human Body from Leonardo to Now’ (Hayward Gallery, 2000–1), ‘Head On: Art with the Brain in Mind’ (Wellcome Trust/Science Museum, 2002), ‘The Genius of Genetics’ (St Thomas Abbey, Brno, 2002). Stephan Besser has studied German Literature and History in Marburg, Amsterdam and Berlin. As a PhD candidate at the Amsterdam School for Cultural Analysis (University of Amsterdam) he is currently preparing a dissertation on the imagery of tropical diseases in German culture at the turn of the twentieth century, provisionally entitled Pathographie der Tropen. Kolonialismus, Medizin und Literatur um 1900. His interest lies in the interdiscursive circulation of medical knowledge in imperial contexts (see most recently ‘Germanin. Pharmazeutische Signaturen des deutschen (Post)Kolonialismus’, in Alexander Honold and Oliver Simons (eds), Kolonialismus als Kultur. Literatur, Medien, Wissenschaft in der deutschen Gründerzeit des Fremden (Tübingen: Francke, 2002) 167–96). He also contributes to a research project on the cultural history of German colonialism at Humboldt University, Berlin. Kirstie Blair is a Research Fellow and Tutor in English at Keble College, Oxford. She has recently completed a PhD on nineteenth-century poetry and the heart, and also works and publishes on Victorian religion, George Eliot and her circle, and twentieth-century poetry. Michael R. Finn is Professor of French at Ryerson University in Toronto. His 1999 study of Marcel Proust (Proust, the Body and Literary Form) attempted to situate the author in the context of fin-de-siècle medicalized nervousness and to analyse how neurasthenia and hysteria act as figures that condition the Proustian notion of style and fictional structure. His current research foci are the interplay between science, medicine and literature and issues of gender, censorship and pornography at the French fin-de-siècle. Recent publications include xi\n\nxii Notes on the Contributors\n\nRachilde–Maurice Barrès: Correspondance inédite 1885–1914 (2002), an edition of love correspondence from the decadent 1880s. He is presently working on two projects – a monograph on the novelist Rachilde and a broader-based study dealing with the fictional representation of the debate over hysteria and neurasthenia, gender and abnormal sexuality in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century French fiction. Pamela K. Gilbert is Associate Professor of English at the University of Florida and editor of the series, Studies in the Long Nineteenth Century. Her work has appeared in several journals, including Nineteenth Century Studies, Nineteenth Century Prose, Women and Performance, English, LIT: Literature/Interpretation/Theory, Essays in Arts and Sciences, Essays in Literature, Victorian Newsletter and others. Her book, Disease, Desire and the Body in Victorian Women’s Popular Novels, was published in 1997. Beyond Sensation, Mary Elizabeth Braddon in Context, a collection co-edited with Marlene Tromp and Aeron Haynie, appeared in 2000. She has also edited the collection Imagined Londons (2002). Visible at a Glance, a book tracing the mapping of the social body and cholera epidemics in London and India in the mid-nineteenth century, is forthcoming. Miranda Gill is a Senior Scholar at Christ Church, University of Oxford, having previously studied at St John’s College and New College, Oxford, and the University of Geneva. She is currently working on her doctoral thesis, a cultural history of eccentricity in nineteenth-century France. In addition to the history of psychiatry, research interests related to her thesis include the relationship between contemporary hermeneutics and the history of enigma in nineteenthcentury French culture; dandyism; monstrosity; and the methodology of cultural history. She has presented various conference papers on these topics. David Boyd Haycock read Modern History at St John’s College, Oxford, and Art History at the University of Sussex. His doctorate on the eighteenth-century antiquary and Newtonian scholar Dr William Stukeley was undertaken at Birkbeck College, University of London, and completed in 1998. Between 1998 and 2002 he was a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford, during which time he also held a Leverhulme Research Fellowship working on the cultural histories of disease with Professor George S. Rousseau. He is the author of William Stukeley: Science, Archaeology and Religion in Eighteenth-Century England (2002) and Paul Nash (2002). Malte Herwig is Junior Research Fellow in German Literature and History of Science at Merton College, University of Oxford. He has stud-\n\nNotes on the Contributors xiii\n\nied at the University of Mainz and The Queen’s College, Oxford, and spent a year as Visiting Research Fellow at Harvard University. He received his DPhil at the University of Oxford with a dissertation on science in Thomas Mann’s work, which will be published by Klostermann in the Monograph Series Thomas-Mann-Studies later this year (Bildungsbürger auf Abwegen. Die Naturwissenschaften im Werk Thomas Manns). He has given conference papers throughout Europe and has published articles in American, British and German learned journals (most recently ‘The Unwitting Muse: Jakob von Uexküll’s Theory of Umwelt and Twentieth-century Literature’, Semiotica 2001). In 1999 he was awarded the Goethe Prize of the English Goethe Society in London and he is currently Gundolf Fellow at the Institute of Germanic Studies in London. He is assistant editor of the new critical edition of Thomas Mann’s early stories. In his current research on the Cultural Roots of Modernism in German Literature and Science he brings together literary historiography with recent approaches in the history of science in order to investigate the parallel development of modern thought in both German science and art between 1890 and 1930. Emese Lafferton is a PhD candidate in History at the Central European University, Budapest, completing her doctoral dissertation on nineteenth-century Hungarian psychiatry, a topic that has hitherto received little attention from modern social sciences. She has received a Wellcome Research Fellowship at the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge, to start in the Summer 2003. During her Wellcome Fellowship she will work on the history of Hungarian psychiatry in a European context, 1850–1918. She has edited and translated books in Hungary, and for many years was the editor and then editor-in-chief of the Budapest-based but internationally circulated social science journal Replika. She is currently working on a book in Hungarian, provisionally titled Hipnózis, hisztéria, és pszichiátria a századfordulós Monarchiában (‘Hypnosis, Hysteria and Psychiatry in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy at the Turn of the Century’) to be published in 2003. She completed her MPhil thesis on a case of hysteria and hypnosis in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy focussing on the doctor–patient negotiation, part of which was published in the History of Psychiatry (2002). George Rousseau received his PhD at Princeton University and has taught at the universities of Harvard, UCLA, Cambridge, Oxford, Leiden, Lausanne, and Aberdeen.

By doing so the frame shapes the picture inside it and gives it another form, or at least – once we begin to think about pictures in relation to frames – changes the meaning of its interior. Framing assumes pictures and – if extended by analogy to areas other than the visual – assumes that those subjects or objects can be understood in pictorial terms through a type of translation. Frames also serve to exhibit and display pictures, and – if the analogy is extended yet again – framing encourages viewers of pictures to ponder what it is that is occurring to the picture at its top and bottom and on its sides; at the rim where the picture meets the frame and inside the core at the perceived dead centre of the picture. The frame thus opens up all sorts of possibilities, even for absent, imaginary frames, for even bare pictures have borders whether or not we can actually see the frame. This point of juncture of the parts occurs on the margins. In our time margins – literal and imagined – have taken on a theoretical life of their own, as in the expressions we have generated about life on the margins and discourse on the borders of this or that perimeter. Frames thus exist to delimit and confine and contextualize: especially to define the object in terms of diverse types of relevant constituent elements. The frame permits understanding, for example, of how the object is situated and evaluated. As Jacques Derrida claimed in ‘The Parergon,’ a famous theoretical essay about borders and margins, ‘no theory or practice can be effective if it does not rest on the frame.’1 The passage is worth citing at length: 1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nNo ‘theory’, no ‘practice’, no ‘theoretical practice’ can be effective here if it does not rest on the frame, the invisible limit of (between) the interiority of meaning (protected by the entire hermeneutic, semiotic, phenomenological, and formalist tradition) and (of) all the extrinsic empiricals which, blind and illiterate, dodge the question . . . Every analytic of aesthetic judgment presupposes that we can rigorously distinguish between the intrinsic and the extrinsic. This ‘resting’ permits us to distinguish between the intrinsic and extrinsic of an object, in the case to hand – illness – the inside and outside of disease. And it further suggests that everything excluded in the process of moving from inside to outside contains the conditions of the possibilities for constructing contexts for disease and sickness. Hence frames contain pictures or images to the extent that they define perimeters and prevent pictures, or subjects, from expanding. Pictures without physical frames open up in ways unknown to those inside frames. Thus frames exist in relation to pictures as boxes serve to confine their contents. Linguists, cognitive psychologists, anthropologists, psychoanalysts and a wide range of other types of other practitioners have resorted to the frame as their essential unit of measure, and it is by now common coinage to refer idiomatically to ‘the way something is framed’ as a shorthand for the kind of context that has been constructed around the object of attention. For example, linguist Deborah Tannen has divided frames into two essential categories: the first a ‘frame of interpretation,’ the other, a ‘schema’, amounting to the basic unit of knowledge structures themselves.2 Tannen explains the difference and what is at stake in the two categories: The interactive notion of frame refers to a definition of what is going on in interaction, without which no utterance (or movement or gesture) could be interpreted. To use Bateson’s classic example, a monkey needs to know whether a bite from another monkey is intended within the frame of play or the frame of fighting. People are continually confronted with the same interpretive task. In order to comprehend any utterance, a listener (and a speaker) must know within which frame it is intended: for example, is this joking? Is it fighting? Something intended as a joke but interpreted as an insult (it could of course be both) can trigger a fight.3 Hence frames are also contexts without which meaning can never be derived. So long as interpretations continue to be made frame interaction\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 3\n\nwill occur: the juncture of meanings happening at the point where the competing interpretations exist or eventually will be contested. But frames are not secure objects. No matter how seemingly durable their material contents – whatever is inside the frame – they are tested at the point where image (the picture) meets the frame’s border. All this suggests violence done to framing, as if the meeting points exert tension and friction on each other. It makes sense therefore to consider the degree of security of any frame, even if some frames are clearly firmer than others. Each case is different: no way exists to generalize from one instance to another. Frames and the act of framing can also be contested on other grounds, not least for their degrees of efficiency. Tests can be made of the degree of security in confining the picture, but also bearing in mind the way the frame holds the picture or changes it. But even the efficiency of frames is less secure than meets the eye. The tests applied to distinguish degrees of efficiency are themselves subject to scrutiny and interrogation. In their discussion of ‘frame shifting’ and ‘juggling frames’, Deborah Tannen and Cynthia Wallat shrewdly demonstrate that the complexity of framing depends upon the number of audiences being reached and the timing of each interaction.4 Their dissection of what happens, for example, in a paediatric examination – a simple medical encounter between mother, child and doctor – demonstrates the types of shifting and juggling that occur. Similar, if more complex, shifting and juggling occur in the medico-linguistic encounters we describe in the chapters of this collection. If anything, our translation of codes between written texts – past and present – and living persons makes the task more fraught. So far we have been speaking of the frame primarily in the singular, as if each picture is permitted one and only one frame. But picture frames are plural; they always exist with the potential of a plurality of frames in mind. Every picture is a candidate for any number of frames, and it is less than clear what we mean when we claim that ‘this frame is the best, or most appropriate, frame for this picture.’ Do we mean best on the grounds of efficiency, security, lack of contestation by viewers, or by the application of other tests not yet devised or described? Framing is also an abstract notion, bounded by a set of metaphors that endow both picture and frame with greater meaning than either could have without the other, just as a disease constellation is enlarged by viewing it in relation to its frame or frames, as this book aims to demonstrate. A disease without a frame has no boundaries or borders. It cannot sustain itself and possesses no interior domain. It rests or leans\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\non nothing, yet it spills out everywhere, knows no limits, is both small and large by virtue of the lack of containment.5 No theory or practice can be effective if it does not lean in some way on the frame to provide its containment. Without the frame it contains neither inside or outside, nor can be seen for the object – the theory or practice – it is. In medicine, such pictures without frames would amount, as it were, to disease classifications without words and things, contexts and cultures. This resting, or leaning, is precisely what permits the possibility of distinguishing the object’s intrinsic from its qualities. Diseases without frames possess neither insides or outsides nor limits or borders beyond which they retain their differences from other disease conditions. The history of medicine can be read – in one sense – as the progressive perfecting of tight-fitting frames: those which fit the empirical facts of observation without violating laws of logic and reason. The suggestion therefore is that pictures, or diseases, without frames would fall apart or collapse; or at least be so loosely defined as to be virtually indistinguishable from other disease constellations. An unframed picture on a wall is bounded by the wall – a frame of sorts – but remains ambiguous in many ways it would not have been with the security of a specially constructed frame, no matter how unstable or unpredictable. If this fitting is the best the frame maker can have made, there probably was a reason.6 Yet if framing is a notion about the way the mind confronts reality – the direction in which this line of reason seems to be moving – it can be approached both in historical and transhistorical modes. The latter transhistorical mode collapses time – all diachronic components evaporate, as it were – and proceeds as if the metaphors of framing are sufficient to carry out all of its work. Language in medicine becomes sufficient in and of itself. The former framing – the historical – proceeds by demonstrating that the metaphors themselves are generated under specific local circumstances and socio-economic conditions that play a part in shaping the metaphors. How large that share was becomes a question of paramount significance for the students of framing. Therefore it makes all the difference whether one approaches these acts of framing in historical or transhistorical terms. Collectively we invoke the former – the historical versions – in part because our diseases were themselves historically constructed, as were the diverse discourses treated below representing these disease constellations and, in turn, shaping them through reverse reciprocity. That is, the perceptions of doctors, patients, participants, observers and commentators, involved in these transactions and cultural negotiations\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 5\n\nwere themselves produced by historically contingent situations. What would it mean, for example, to dislodge a person – a patient – from her era? To disembody language from its historically situated speakers? To dislocate symptoms and their semiological interpretations from the flesh-and-blood bodies that were themselves bounded by diachronic time and space? To wrench texts encoding and representing these medical subjects from the circumstances, no matter how bizarre or eccentric, in which they were generated? To construe medical representations as if they had evolved outside history: beyond the pale of individual lives – happy and sad, healthy and pathological – which constitute biographies? Apart from the vast annals of autobiographical literature and outside the small groups who add up to what social historians call a society, and so forth? In brief, to frame disease as if its métier were transhistorical without any need to provide evidence?\n\nImagining disease We hope the essays collected in this volume will persuade readers of (at least some of) the virtues of an historical approach, standing in opposition in large part to the theoretical gaze cast by such recent synthesizers as Michel Foucault.7 If this is the case, this historical, as distinct from transhistorical, imperative may nevertheless have less utility for the categories implicated in the imagining of illness. Even in analogous forms, as we have developed them above, the two activities – framing and imagining – seem to be divided by a gap between them. The matter addresses the nature of the divide and what sorts of bearing this divide has for the framing of disease within cultural history. The imagining of pictures would seem to be an altogether different activity, existing in counterpoint to framing them. This subject is, of course, vast and cannot be treated here. Still, a few basics begin to focus on the differences: the imagined picture does not yet exist, is not drawn or painted, except within the imagination of particular minds. An undrawn picture has no frame, almost by definition, not even in the mind – the imagined picture is thus at least as unstable and insecure as the painted image. It too resides in the mind in the sense that the mind slowly endows it with form and is nonetheless real than the fully-drawn canvas; but its ontological status would seem to be different. It is the picture one will draw; the picture one can paint. Even in its imaginary state its borders are more vulnerable than the already painted picture while it still lacks frames. The imagination may not visualize it as existing inside concrete frames at all, and this lack is one of the main differences from\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nits representation when a finished canvas. The point of this analogizing for imagining disease is our raison d’être.8 It is not merely that the analogy throws light on the latter, especially on medical conditions that have not, as yet, been born. It has also begun to lead the way to the pathologizing and medicalization of types of human behaviour in history which forms much of the heart of Parts II and III of this book. The point of these distinctions is that the imagining of disease has much in common with imagining pictures, especially undrawn pictures in the mind. Fred Hoyle, the noted contemporary astronomer, may have drawn (unconsciously?) on these processes in his book Diseases from Space (New York: Harper & Row, 1979). Less fabulously, the doctor pronounces a name which will become the label of a disease: AIDS, cancer, dementia, diabetes, gout, insanity, stroke. He has probably learned it in a medical school; the name of a human malady which was once imagined and did not as yet exist, just as Johannes Hofer, a now obscure Alsatian army surgeon of the late seventeenth century, invented the condition of nostalgia (from the Greek root nostos, meaning home, and algia, the disease of longing for).9 Once named and defined the name became the label for a malady: a shorthand for all sorts of relationships and associations, and, in turn, began to conjure pictures in the imagination of both doctor (surgeon or physician) and patient. Hence label and picture existed in sets of historical relationships. But these pictures in the mind also had internalized frames, whether or not doctors – and, eventually through transmission, patients – were aware of them. Pictures were sometimes self-contained, at other times spilling over and overflowing, to the rest of the patient’s body beyond the insides of the head, as in images of disease as battle or warfare. These are idiosyncratic pictures – of turmoil, fire, flames, the apocalypse of life – and partake of images forming part of a coherent pictorial language: the language of imagining illness. They include the patient’s imagining of disease: the psychotic’s pictures, for example, in art brut; the neurotic’s seemingly unintelligible and incoherent verbal discourse which itself needs to be framed – to lean on something else – to be decoded; the cancer patient’s ruminations on a bleak future visualized as barren, leafless seacoast stretching for miles with pounding waves that gradually engulf him, or as a pyre with gigantic flames in which she will be burned to a crisp.10 Names and labels also participate in these acts of imagining. But however different this imagining of disease is from conceptualizing it as malady containing pre-existing frames – such as the tuberculosis that entails a wasting away but that is nevertheless not the more invasive\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 7\n\nravishment of cancer – it nonetheless bears similarities to framing disease.11 Framed diseases and imagined diseases are not entirely opposed, nor do they lie in total counterpoint: they exist on a spectrum of contingency in which the imagination always plays a large role.12 The parallels of the two types of disease-forming overlap at the margins and on the rims of their imaginary worlds, riddled both by core insides and by marginal outsides. Both are obsessed by inclusions and exclusions within their figuration of disease – on the practical level by the ravages malady will bring, or – if fortunate – the havoc illness may not play. So let us imagine: the patient has been diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas, has given it a label. The physician has named the disease. The patient engages in no conscious notions of framing his cancer – that is, rationally conjecturing at what points and in what ways it will impinge on his life – but, instead, begins to imagine it. What pictures will he imagine? What scenes of devastation? What rises before him in the conflagration of his final illness when this smallest of hidden organs burns up the rest of his body? Or is it they – the other organs – which will eventually consume the pancreas?\n\nA context for frames The serious framing of categories generally – in philosophy and science – has by now had a venerable history. In this context one means by categories subjects, or topics, under careful scrutiny, such as life, death, liberty, freedom and – more specifically – subjects or topics within recognizable discourses or academic disciplines. The more self-conscious the subject of study, the more rigorous, it seems, the applications applied in relation to the frame, as in art history, where framing has practically been elevated into a science by now.13 That framing as a self-conscious reflective process should have loomed so large in recent history is unsurprising. As the social sciences, especially anthropology, introduced a new relativism into the exploration of the humanities historically viewed, new forms of self-reflexivity were required. If tropes of the savage and civilized, for example, could frame each other and thereby prevent the other from collapse (that is, the civilized transformed almost by sleight of hand into the savage and viceversa), it soon became apparent that discourse about language also implied the vocabulary of the other: coherent discourse implying its other as incoherent discourse and vice-versa. Hence the language of the psychotic was said to be as coherently organized, albeit according to different norms, as that of so-called healthy persons.14\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nAll rigorous thought is, of course, self-reflective to a degree: weary about itself and fretting about its ontological status and truth claims; framed thought perhaps doubly so in that it construes the categories it studies with rigour and subjugates them (the categories) to different kinds of contextualization and problematization. In our generation frames have been tested through diverse approaches ranging from the epistemological and ontological to the anthropological and broadly cultural – this gamut partly in response to the challenge of postmodern methodologies which have themselves been under unusually tense scrutiny. In medicine, the interaction between patients and doctors in the so-called ‘medical interview’ has been shown to be far more coded, if also confusing and in need of close scrutiny, than was previously thought.15 Hitherto medical writing proved to be the site of ambiguity as literary critics of diverse persuasions analyzed its form and content. But now historical-medical treatises have found competitors in other linguistic interchanges. Theorizing about frames has also become an especially active field in our time as the result of a widespread preoccupation with methodology at large. Sensuous, spontaneous, unreflective approaches seem to have been decreasing since the 1970s. Researchers in all fields are routinely requested to reflect on their methodologies and, then, to justify their approaches to particular topics depending on an array of local and global factors. These must in turn be explained along the lines of established method. By the time we spiral downward to the framing of disease we discover a topic embedded inside no one subject or discipline but simultaneously within medicine, culture, history and representation. A whole series of negotiations must occur before we can even begin to understand how the framing occurred; and most of these are far more culture-bound and socially determined than so-called pure, medical theory – whatever that could be. Hence it is becoming increasingly clear that no single discipline is adequate to explain how diseases – especially diseases in history – attained their current profiles. How cancer, for example, developed its particular sets of cultural codes and pictures to the mind, or depression the widespread embrace it has received today in all western societies (and perhaps eastern too if the studies of depression in China and Japan are accurate16) without comprehending how it evolved in this way. How consumption progressed from the sixteenth century, being later transformed into phthisis and tuberculosis, and then cementing itself to the most bizarre, lingering images and metaphors common in the high Romanticism of the nineteenth century; images swept by\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 9\n\nnotions of social class, heroism, nationalism, romance, destiny. Or, alternatively, why madness has continued to be the least stable of the framed maladies. Whatever these processes of framing amounted to historically – and, as a group of expositors, we would probably concur that our work comes early rather than late in this self-reflective development of framing – they cannot have been entirely, or even preeminently, medical. They have also been – perhaps more prominently – visual, narrative, rhetorical, moral, political, mythic, religious, and allegorical (if loosely construed as the representation within disease of something standing in for something else: illness as the substitute for moral defect). The Jobean framing of disease, where illness is interpreted according to the severity of types Job suffered, would fill a book in itself. And for a major portion of western human history Job-thecomforter was a guide in the early-modern world for patients’ framing of disease: according to his sufferings they could measure their own gradation.17 Jobean morality was merely one of several kinds of framing: another type is found in Defoe. In Robinson Crusoe (1719) Robinson recognizes, by his near encounter with death through fatal illness, that all along he has been a sinner. At the time of malady he is already far removed from society, having by this time been shipwrecked on the deserted island for almost twenty years. In the fictions of Tobias Smollett, a ship surgeon who secured overnight literary success with his first bestselling novel Roderick Random (1747), sickness also plays a major thematic role.18 Literally dozens of doctors who populate these Smollettian pages are satirized, and the actual medicine of the epoch is framed in ways that must have appeared extraordinary to the mid-eighteenth-century reading public. Smollett frames his ideas by appealing to greed as the most interesting of the passions and dissects every aspect of – what he calls – ‘the medical knot’: an intricate set of relationships among practitioners all vying for economic gain with little regard for care or cure. He could be called an early sociologist of medicine. But this merely tags him; surely, it is more accurate to extract from his framings a passionate adherence to the persistence of the economic motive in all medical transactions.19 He remained an experimental novelist throughout his career without ever surrendering the primacy of the medical motif, which renders him a primary candidate for framing in our sense, and he could well have been the subject of one of the below chapters. Even his last work, widely considered to be his masterpiece – The Adventures of Humphry Clinker (1771) – is the comic journey of five characters in search of different kinds of health.\n\n10 Introduction\n\nNineteenth-century literature embroidered these incorporations and embodied medicine as a lynchpin to understanding its main characters through the status of their bodies. Some authors appealed to physiognomy and phrenology, others to craniology and the brain, still others – like Coleridge and de Quincey and the opium prophets – explored mind–body consciousness as revealed in dreams.20 In the words of George Eliot disease both protects and removes her protagonists from society, rendering the author Eliot (and her hero, Dr Lydgate in Middlemarch) a free-floating agent unaccountable to society’s exigencies. Charles Darwin’s chronic illness – forever sick to ensure that he could pamper himself and get on with his work largely by functioning outside society – was the daytime reality of this fictive Otherworld of malady: yet another species of behaviour he had observed in himself. At least in Victorian and Edwardian literature down through D. H. Lawrence, where the sexual body in both its healthy and pathological states still holds the keys to revelation, these frames have figured pre-eminently. If there is a general point that all these fictions reveal it is that sickness guarantees the imagined removal from society – the chance to go it alone. In these post-Romantic versions sickness is imagined as the guarantor of solitude, social apartheid, individualism, the ultimate freedom so many nineteenth-century heroes and heroines craved. Their maladies may be conjured rather than real, yet they serve primary functions in the novel.21 Yet fiction is only one of several contexts for framing disease. There are many others, and we would not wish to imply otherwise. But fiction, and in particular the novel, was in fact the most popular form of literature in the western world after the great European Revolution of 1848. The uses it made of medicine are so diverse that they could be distilled into a taxonomy of frames, in the way we saw Tannen and Wallat construct a classification of linguistic frames. Fiction itself is obviously a type of ‘context’ (something con, or with, the text). Our point is rather that disease has multiple contexts: some more appropriate, some less, for particular conditions and that we need to take stock of how diseases acquired the diverse profiles we take for granted. In some instances – depression, for example – we are utterly baffled about how we arrived at the point we find ourselves in today, a strange, almost Shandean trajectory from the old Renaissance melancholy.22\n\nFraming disease The framing of disease began to preoccupy academic medical historians in the United States during the 1970s. They did not proffer their\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 11\n\nresearch in this way – framing again – but this is what their peregrinations in search of method amounted to.23 Then, in the 1980s when the wave in attention given to the body crested, cultural historians followed suit. Around that time (although the moment itself is difficult to pinpoint), diverse groups began to ask hard questions about the status and profile of medical conditions in relation to the body, even as generalized affliction, pain and suffering outside narrow disease constellations. The mountain of work on these subjects was so large, and impressive, it would impossible to survey. Suffice it to say that disease and malady was elevated to a new threshold – one asking hard ontological questions about the objects themselves. Resistance emerged from hardliners, who claimed that the history of medicine should not range so widely: these were the internalists whose gaze was fixed to the craft or techne of their subject. But even they proved vulnerable to the waves of interdisciplinarity sweeping over all the humanities during this period. Besides, they found themselves outnumbered by those asserting that the time had come to be more reflective about contexts. As interdisciplinary methodologies were triumphing and the new cultural history began to embrace the discourses of the body that included illness, pain, suffering, death, indeed, all the forms of body derangement, these ‘internalists’ lost out. Set the dials to 1985, for example, and it was clear that those academics serious about the study of the body – healthy and pathological – were equally vigilant to the types of contexts they would need to construct. These included the historical, medical, ethical and metaphorical, as in the body of the text, the body politic, and many other types of bodies. Sufficient attention was to legitimate a large conference on the framing of disease held in 1988 at the College of Physicians in Philadelphia under the expert direction of Professors Charles E. Rosenberg and Janet Golden: historians with a wide net and democratic gaze at the recent development of their field who could hardly be considered internalists. The talks at this conference were delivered almost exclusively by medical historians who later collected (some of) their papers and published them four years later in an important book edited by the conference organizers: Charles E. Rosenberg and Janet Golden (eds), Framing Disease: Studies in Cultural History (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1992).24 This landmark volume, published a decade ago and a companion to an earlier collection edited by Edward Clarke, Modern Methods in the History of Medicine,25 construed its task in chronological terms and according to social categories. That is, it divided and classified the various approaches of its members into two basic formations: 1. historical\n\n12 Introduction\n\neras and 2. socio-institutional categories. The divisions made pre-eminent sense, especially in light of the contributors’ background, and advanced the state of the history of medicine, as some reviewers acknowledged.26 In this sense Framing Disease: Studies in Cultural History was to prove in time an important and influential academic book, and any young scholars overlooked it at their peril. But it was actually less interdisciplinary than it seemed, and its authors dealt a sleight of hand to private voices and their literary embodiments. Rosenberg and Golden fixed their attention on the historical period – Renaissance, Enlightenment, Romantic, Victorian – in relation to disease formation. Literature as the great purveyor of knowledge and disseminator of information – high and low, serious and comic – hardly figured at all.27 Susan Sontag had already opened up everyone’s eyes to the metaphoric possibilities of illness in this heyday of AIDS, but the academic community was slow to take up her gauntlet.28 By contrast, the approach adopted in our volume minimizes historical periods and social factors (important as these factors have been in social history) and aims to frame instead with language and narrative categories in mind; especially the strategies of persuasion used by narrators, whether sufferers or healers or gazers, and the range of narrative modes sought by those eager to express their thought about states of health or illness.29 The differences between the Rosenbergian enterprise and the Rousseavian – if one may group the former for the purposes of brevity into a shorthand of the Rosenbergian and the latter into the Rousseauvian without suggesting that either set of contributors was in the least influenced by their organizer – are noteworthy. Where Rosenberg and his team turn to society – its collective voice in social arrangements and public institutions – Rousseau and his fellow contributors gravitate to individual voices; in particular, those of poets, novelists, philosophers, diarists, memoirists, all those who are recording, the mind’s wreckage on the body rather than merely vice-versa. Literature, more than any other domain, contains this massive annals of the private voice. Literature may be unreliable in all sorts of ways, and it may be too vast a territory for historians of medicine to tackle (since no one can learn everything), but as the repository of the solitary expressive voice it has no competitor, especially in the face of pain, malady, suffering, death, and the annihilation of the self.30 These Rousseavian acts of framing also require the active participation of a category such as imagination: hence the imagining, as well as the framing, of disease. The addition is not fanciful or rhetorical or resurrected here because historically it was medical theory that pathologized\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 13\n\nthe imagination and paved the way for the late Enlightenment discourses of ‘diseased imagination’ that nurtured a theory of insanity. Rather, it appears, even in the title of our book, because imagination plays a main role in the cognitive processes and epistemological models generated by the dual acts of framing and imagining. If anything, we ought to have paid more attention to the differences. We should have stated more emphatically than we do when one of us – or some obscure figure of the past – is framing rather than imagining and what the overlaps and reciprocities are. Finally, where Rosenberg and his group mentalize according to disease conditions (the disease label is more often than not their frame), Rousseau’s group tends to internalize the frame in terms of the imaginary: the unseen, the invisible, the unheard, the barely expressed. Moreover, Rosenberg’s frames are generally embedded in public discourse, their cerebral dimensions outstripping any private emotional ones; in contrast, Rousseau’s framed discourses are idiosyncratic, private, and solitary, and they court fear and terror. They assume that the individual voice is as valid as the public, collective one. Everywhere in the Rousseavian endeavour are traces of an arduous process of coping with death by somehow imagining it and giving it a language, even imagining it as death-in-life. Given that mortals have no more highly developed equipment with which to formulate complex thoughts than language broadly construed (for example, the language of music), and have no higher capacity than the linguistic, it is not surprising that words should feature so prominently in the Rousseavian frames. In brief, we think – to the degree we can agree – that the language used to frame historical illness and disease is as significant as the malady itself. By vesting so much in language we do not mean to lend an impression that we are in any way idiosyncratic in our views of people in the past and the suffering they endured. Of course, we acknowledge the history of pain and – institutionally – the history of medicine as a discrete discipline, entitled, as it is, to its own professional needs and codes. As moderns – and postmoderns – living in a world in which the cost of medical provision grows exponentially, we accept that medical realism is a fact of life: the diurnal reality of doctors, hospitals, diagnoses, patients, illness infectious and genetic, and – of course – the huge cost of supporting all this. But by elevating the ante, as it were, of the representational in framing, our approach also assumes that medicine is now too important (and expensive) a component of the human story to be left entirely to medical experts and specialists whose gaze may be narrowly focused: certainly they cannot tell the whole story of suffering.31\n\n14 Introduction\n\nWe need to complement their work with the record of private voices and solitary texts, but always keeping an empirical history of medicine in the foreground of our imagination.32 Until recently the history of medicine has largely focused on disease as seen from the top down (this was certainly true until the last generation), generally without listening to private voices. This state of affairs is changing, we know, and we hope that approaches of the sort found here will accelerate the pace. Furthermore, it has become clear that medicine has played a larger role in shaping cultural history than has been conceded previously. The modes of expression through which the life of the body has been configured remains a large and demanding agenda. This wider cultural understanding of medicine includes discussion of the frames and forms of imagination through which, and inside which, disease is constructed. The strands of argument are diverse, and the processes complex. There is a need to embrace multiple layers of pain, suffering, deprivation, and death, as well as the all too necessary illness diagnoses offered by medical practitioners. This version of framing and imagining disease construes language and discourse as inherent in the process. Language was, of course, crucial in the formation of medical and scientific theory itself over the centuries – how could it not be? But that consideration of language is more literal than the versions treated here in terms of narrative, rhetoric, genre, and especially metaphor, and – for those imagining poems or fictions with deep-layer medical content the way they moved from the other to the other. Tone, voice and literary form must be included in these considerations. The genre into which a speaker – and also a writer – deposits thoughts, as if in a box which itself frames a set of objects, is often a singular clue to intention and desire. But genres, no less than medical theories, also possess contexts and histories; a transhistorical view of them may be as delimiting as synchronic histories without time lines.33 The ‘frame’, then, is inherently interdisciplinary in the sense that it belongs to no single discourse or academic discipline. However, ownership and its implications must not be minimized even in postdisciplinary life. The fact that most scholars who conceptualize disease and frame illness in this linguistically charged way continue to be students of language and literature is not without effect. Literary scholars apprize themselves about the facts of disease in history no less than healthcare professionals read – indeed consume – literature and make the time to read about the lives of its writers. It would be the rare approach within our enterprise (the below essays) that wilfully ignored the facts of – for example – plague, tuberculosis, cholera, influenza, AIDS. Hence it needs\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 15\n\nemphasizing yet again that while we are not prejudiced towards transhistorical approaches or purely theoretical formulations privileging themes and tropes, we have nevertheless given preference in this volume to scholars whose method is primarily empirical and historical.34 This leaves the historical imperative: what type of history? Many scholars today number themselves among the ranks of cultural historians, yet we perceive that some of their interfaces differ from ours. Collectively we emphasize, of course, different threads in the historical enterprise and harbour different senses of the domains of literature and medicine. But most of us would concur in the belief that we must know both areas in depth: not merely each as labels or metaphors for something else (the old issue of realism again and its forms of evidence) but for the role they played within literary and medical history. Beyond this point it is a feature of almost every one of these essays that they continue to reflect the author’s wonder about the appearance of each domain in the heartland of the other. It is probably impossible to affirm when, or how, medicine was discovered in, or recovered for, literature – its traces are so inherent in the human condition that it may have been there from the earliestknown oral literature. It can certainly be clearly detected in the Homeric poems, which start with a dream as the sign of troubled mind in disturbed body; throughout biblical scripture ( Job’s narrative remains the greatest story ever told about the sufferer reproaching his God); in several of the Platonic dialogues. Every subsequent civilization, Medieval or Renaissance, eastern or western, learned – sooner or later – that it could not omit medicine and the body from the categories of its dominant concerns. Why then should it not be inscribed in its imaginative literature? Each description acted as if it were reinventing the world anew: explaining how patient-sufferers conceptualized their experience of violation done to their bodies in the terms of sickness or illness. Patients often aimed to capture – in our conceptualization unwittingly to frame – their experience of suffering in literature. It was more essential to be a sufferer than a trained doctor when describing the kingdom of sickness. In extreme cases writers had themselves not sufferered but nonetheless described and commented on others’ pain. What differences were these?35 We glimpse what is at stake in a long didactic poem of the early eighteenth century by William Thompson (1712–66), one of the lengthiest explicit poetic pronouncements about illness over the whole course of that century. David Shuttleton has discussed this work in his chapter below and I will not repeat his comments here except to draw out their further ramifications for the framing of disease. Historically, the 1740s\n\n16 Introduction\n\nproved to be a crucial watershed for the rapid development of the Romantic strain in poetry as well as the incorporation of health into literature. It is probably no accident that several long poems of this period were then devoted to this subject. In 1744 the long didactic poems of two physicians appeared: John Armstrong’s Art of Preserving Health, versifying wisdom about staying well and growing old, and Mark Akenside’s Pleasures of Imagination, permeated with fantasies about the role played by the body’s anatomical nerves, spirits and fibres in the imaginative act.36 These were followed by Thompson’s Sickness: A Poem (1745) and, a year later, Malcolm Flemyng’s epic Neuropathia, or the pathway of the nerves. Flemyng’s grand epic poem was composed in Latin hexameter verse (never translated into English) over hundreds of lines displaying the post-Newtonian confidence that wondrous physiological fibres pulsate on the inner highways of the bloodstream – a type of busy Enlightenment anatomical Internet.37 These sprawling poems seemed to blend into each other and lurked, as it were, under the 1747 umbrella of Thomas Warton’s Pleasures of Melancholy, as if to suggest that poets are chemically deranged melancholics whose bodily humours are out of kilter through a surfeit of black bile.38 But Sickness’s three-canto structure extending to approximately 2,000 lines is perhaps unique among these poems of the 1740s for its focus on illness as a central theme. It was written – as the author claims – after his recovery from a near-fatal smallpox. Thompson, unlike most of these other poets of the 1740s, was not a trained doctor (although neither was Warton). He had read Classics at Queen’s College Oxford and succeeded to a vicarage in Hampton Poyle, Oxfordshire. Here, in rural semi-seclusion and enjoying the gift of his sinecure, he pursued his primary passion, poetry. A close call with death around the time of Pope’s and Swift’s deaths (respectively 1744 and 1745) brought his intimations on mortality to the foreground and gave him the confidence that illness was a fit subject for high heroic poetry. Otherwise, he had no role models for this incorporation of illness into literature and took his creative chances: as he says, ‘I don’t remember to have seen any poem on the same subject to lead me on the way.’39 Thompson’s other poetic concerns in Sickness also touch on framing. He had read widely in the ancient classical literature and was steeped in canonical poetry in English, especially Spenser, whose diction and syntax he often imitated. The recent deaths of Pope and Swift further prompted him to reflect on the immensity of their influence on him. But his launching into a new province of poetry – the versification of illness – made him to take stock of his own physical and poetic\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 17\n\nresources. For one thing he was profoundly worried that readers would neither understand medical terminology nor be able to stomach his explicit descriptions of illness: ‘it cannot be suppos’d that I should treat upon sickness in a medicinal, but only in a descriptive, moral and religious manner’. Medical realism appeared potentially perilous to him because it had not yet been widely adopted as an appropriate subject for long poems – hence my point about the framing of illness in the poetry of the 1740s. As a result Thompson omitted the gory details, nor did he allegorize or generalize them – a mainstay of his framing: ‘I have just taken such notice of the progress of the Smallpox as may give the reader some small idea of it, without offending his imagination [my emphasis].’40 Thompson’s approach frames both poetry and sickness. First, despite the recognition that health and its opposites are mighty subjects for literature the poet must not indulge a habit to provide too much detail or the reader will pause.41 Secondly, Thompson settles on the metaphor of war or battle rather than (for example) the stage of disease – illness as theatre – for his dominant image. Sickness is frequently compared to the fires of hell that engulf him; force him to fight on as ‘Aetna rages here. . . with her fury and furies.’42 Over time war and theatre have been the two dominant images in the metaphorical representation of sickness: entire books could be written on the spectacle of each. Thirdly, Thompson frames his own illness by claiming – and here he anticipated the school of Romantic poets who celebrated the joys of melancholy as ‘Ah what ails thee knight at arms alone and palely loitering’ – that those who ail have heightened sensibilities. It is something of a quid pro quo: poetic art in return for ill health. Thompson’s long eulogy to Alexander Pope in Book II is not merely appropriate (Pope had just died) but also serves to frame the homology between sickness and writing: With pain embarras’d, all his tedious days, and head-achs acked, the boundless sea of wit Spread o’er the world.43 Pope, a lifelong invalid despite holding to a hectic routine, claimed that his body never enjoyed three days of consecutive health, and he was obsessed by his aches and pains. His poetry contains many references to his ailments, but never as the main theme or centrepiece (his Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot, for example, written to a physician who is himself remarkably literary, includes medical content only to the degree that it has larger moral and artistic significance).44 Finally, Thompson positions\n\n18 Introduction\n\nhis ideas around two main moral frames (frames in our sense) lodged in God and friendship: these are the Jobean beliefs that the deity has created doctors and potions as an act of benevolence to mankind, and, secondly, the (again Jobean) view that friends count for more than anything during illness: ‘Health is disease, life death, without a friend.’45 Having carved out his kingdom of illness, Thompson continues by drawing on the old paradoxical tradition in medicine, which Agnieszka Steczowicz will expound in her chapter, that ‘Health’s the disease of morals: few in health/ Turn o’er the volumes which will make us wise.’46 The months it took Thompson to execute his poem also forced him to reconsider providence’s benignity in sparing him. Hence his tributes to Mercy and Hygeia (the goddess of health). The particular malady, as Shuttleton shows, was smallpox but Thompson devotes only a fraction of his attention to the onset and progress of this disease. He is more concerned to ‘frame’ his experience in other ways: especially by arguing that sickness is a fit subject for poetry; conversely, that it is foolish to waste time on ephemera – trifling themes – when great subjects like health are available. A poem like Thomas Gray’s ‘Ode on the death of a favourite cat’, for example, which would appear just two years later in 1748, makes the case, even if it is structurally and rhetorically far more accomplished than any lines Thompson ever wrote.47 High-mindedness energizes the new framing precisely because the state of health is not something that can be taken for granted: hence the invocation to Urania (muse of astronomy and scientific phenomena), the dramatic descriptions of the onset of a great illness and its first sudden attacks, and the extended allegory of the ‘Palace of Disease’ (I: 252–380) in which all major diseases are enumerated as if in an epic catalogue. I have lingered over these poetic frames of the 1740s in order to make the point about an important moment in the evolution of English poetry at a time when it brushes closely with illness.48 Suffice it to say here that some of Thompson’s anxiety was his – and other poets’ – doubt about the way forward in the immediate aftermath of Pope’s death in 1744. These writers (Armstrong, Akenside, Flemyng, Thompson et al.) felt they had to move away from Pope’s poetic forms and versify in other ways. But the explanation is insufficient in itself: they were also turning to fresh fields as the route to human improvement. They hoped to gain greater entry into their souls – a deeper selfknowledge – through the experience of fleshly suffering. For decades autobiographers and memoirists had recounted their illnesses, so why shouldn’t take poets themselves?49 Thompson, however, is comparatively silent about the poet’s melancholy and the generic solitude of ill-\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 19\n\nness. Briefly he mentions spleen and – of course – the smallpox from which he had recovered, but he omits to acknowledge how the patient suffers alone (one thinks, in contrast, of the later post-Romantic ethic that each of us dies alone). And he appears oblivious, in turn, to the compensatory pleasures of malady: the possibility that such shoring up of the self in times of bodily crisis, and the ensuing spiritual warfare, was somehow salutary. For Thompson, Armstrong, Flemyng and most of their poetic contemporaries of the 1740s melancholy’s web – spleen, vapours, all the low spirits – necessitated solitude as a precondition of the malady. But the huge range of pleasures such solitariness conferred had not yet been imagined. Nor did their poetic contemporaries of the 1740s – Edward Young, William Collins, and Thomas Gray (whose morbidly depressive personality should have alerted him to the pleasures of melancholy rather more than they did50) – explicitly celebrate or extol these pleasures. That would come a generation later, by which time illness of every type had become established as proper subject for literature. But the explicit portion of the foregrounding entails the point here about framing and imagining illness. Those poets cited above happened to be writing in the English language; they could as well have been composing in French or German, and it was in France in the next century – the nineteenth – that the pleasures of melancholy would be elevated almost to the status of a verbal science.51 On both sides of the Channel new concerns for self and ego in a troubled post-1789, and then post-1815, political milieu combined to produce a new psychology. Concurrently, the institutionalization of psychiatry – first in England on a small scale and then on a grander scale in the Paris medical schools under the tutelage of doctors Pinel and Esquirol – changed the pathway of melancholy’s future. In an increasingly secular world, in which religious inspiration was receding, derangement was increasingly ascribed to socio-economic causation. Here too was another type of framing, as we shall see below.\n\nOrganization of the volume The chapters in this volume amount to a series of explorations of the appropriateness of diverse frames. In an ideal world in which we could have first imagined contributions and then commanded them there would have been greater plenitude and diversity, as well as a larger number and different ordering of sections. For example, we can imagine sections on framing disease in non-western cultures and in other historical periods; imagine illness in pictures exclusive of words\n\n20 Introduction\n\nexcept for the words needed to describe these images; conceptualize frames for disease along economic class lines in different societies. But this has not happened and we have been delighted instead to work with what we were fortunate enough to find. Collectively we are all too aware that our approach is eclectic, and can only respond to the criticisms it will inevitably elicit that our contributors, however excellent, are comparatively few and work in narrow periods of cultural history or in the long-distance trajectories of disciplinary histories (i.e., the history of psychiatry, the history of madness and so forth). Our contributors also work in different disciplines and are united by their consuming interest in literary discourse and its representations in texts, genres, and word patterns. Even the historians among us will concede the major role played by literature in the versions of framing given below: a different state of affairs from approaches in which history – especially the history of medicine – assumes the lion’s share. In those framings within the history of medicine (Rosenbergian) literature seems strangely absent; in these (Rousseauvian) it may appear that we are deaf to class distinctions, political and economic structures, the social arrangements of societies, and the integral dependence of sickness on religious belief. We acknowledge these gaps in advance and can only hope that subsequent volumes on framing disease will include them as we continue to refine our eclectic approaches. But none of these caveats should suggest that we have been cavalier about our methodology. Each of us has been vigilant to, and reflective about, the nature of our enterprise. Each of us is immersed one way or another in the fine detail of our topics – Clifford Geertz’s resonating phrase ‘thick-description’ in The Interpretation of Cultures (1973) comes to mind. In another academic identity each of us is a specialist, or expert, in the subject we write about here, whether smallpox in the eighteenth century or the development of Tropenkoller (tropical fever in German colonies at the end of the nineteenth century), and we hope to have penetrated so thoroughly to the heart of our specialism that each of the chapters presented here holds up in its own right. That is, each of the contributions sustains itself to the degree that any other expert without our penchant for framing disease would think it breaks new ground purely by dint of its relation to the narrow internal field – for example, the new research presented here on the reception of Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain (1924) among medical practitioners, or the extensive accumulations of allusion and reference to heart disease in Victorian literary culture.\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 21\n\nThis said, all of our chapters have been conceived also as if they were trial-runs executed for the generation of a discursive frame: each is situated within a defined era or epoch and then contextualized in particular cultures. We are fortunate to be able to cover a broad expanse of chronology, from the early-modern world to the present, since this ensures that our frames are not repetitive within one society, although we are the first to concede that even within small groups sickness is diversely framed. Despite the limited number of case studies presented here, the diversity of figures, national settings, and historical eras ensures a sufficiently broad repertoire from which to develop a feel for transhistorical frames. Our goal is to buttress the belief that we can only understand the insides and outsides, as it were, of disease conditions if our frames are sufficiently developed. Each of our four sections – framing and imagining disease, framing and imagining madness, the patient’s narratives and images, a poetics and metaphorics of disease – possesses a historical context and historiography, and each has already evolved to an advanced degree in the current interdisciplinary debates about the historical body and its healthy and pathological productions. If the first (framing and imagining disease) represents the bread-and-butter of our approach – the selection of a category and its discourse representations in the attempt to explicate its contours at a historical moment – the second dealing with madness is somewhat different. It demonstrates that madness, at least relatively recent versions that have been reframed since the rise of psychiatry in the late eighteenth century, has had a closer affinity with literature than other forms of written cultural artifact. Whether this is because the mad are more prone to write or because their writing has proved their best therapy (at least as valid as art therapy), the fact remains that insanity has relied more intensely on language than other types of medical pathology.52 The patient’s own narratives captured in his own voice (Part III) flourishes today as the study of pathographesis and few literary historians will be surprised that self-analysis has made such strides in our time, to the extent that writing classes all over the world encourage their students therapeutically to write themselves out of anguish and pain. Both chapters in Part III make specific contributions to the debate: one looks at the role of naming in the patient’s cosmology of illness, while the other considers mistaken self-diagnosis and its consequences for recovery in the future. Part IV focuses on the poetics and metaphorics of disease. Like pathographesis, this is an established area for those immersed in the interfaces of medicine and literature. This is a proliferating field,\n\n22 Introduction\n\nunsurprisingly when we recall that even the most basic concepts of medicine – contagion, pollution, communicability, to seize only on the fundamental words in English used for the transmission of illness – are thickly metaphoric. The significance of our fourth section (Part IV), we think, is that it breaks ground by being overtly historical. Whether in Renaissance Italy, as in Agnieszka Steczowicz’s chapter, or Kirstie Blair’s new approach to the clichés about the heart and head in nineteenthcentury England, it is important to note the degree to which each author had to steep herself in the core centre of the philosophical ideas studied. We can well think of other sections – for example, the doctor’s first-person narratives on subjects other than his case histories or medical pronouncements, or patients’ responses to rationed medicine in history – but we hope that the four sections included here are sufficiently representative to indicate the range of methodologies invoked to frame and imagine illness.\n\nApproaches to framing and imagining disease Caterina Albano starts our collection by offering a series of frames for the phenomenon of self-starvation, which she resists labelling anorexia, instead focusing her gaze on the late-seventeenth-century English case study of one Martha Taylor, the modernity of which is compelling. Albano asks how starvation has been a mirror as well as a lamp of the local cultures producing it: a double-bind enabling Albano to contemplate the ways that self-starvation has itself been a metaphor for the processes by which it was enculturated (her word). But is self-starvation an illness and, if so, under what circumstances? How did self-starvers become objects of desire, or the converse, in their local (rather than global) cultures? Idealized Renaissance women were ordinarily rotund in their supine maja nuda poses, especially as framed on Rubensesque canvases by swelling pillows and plush fabrics, indicating no lack of protein nourishment as enhancements to erotic pleasure. How then was the notion of the eroticized female transformed from substantial junoesque corpora fabrica into the Twiggy-thin ribs-and-bones bodies of the present day? Albano’s focus is firmly genderized on women, in line with the practices of early-modern western cultural history. Selfstarving male hermits of the early modern world, for instance, fasted for different reasons from these maidens who had deprived themselves of nourishment for all sorts of reasons other than religious ones.53 But – by the late eighteenth century – male dandies were routinely squeezing themselves into foppish lace-trousers so tightly fitted that they may as\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 23\n\nwell have been girdled corsets. This was a practice ridiculed by the pictorial satirists of the age (Rowlandson, Gillray and company) who eventually accustomed the eyes of Regency men to be prepared by 1825 for one Claude Seurat, perhaps the thinnest man of his epoch who practiced the arts of self-starvation to reduce his corpora fabrica to just five kilos! – a counterpoint to the sebaceous Doctor George Cheyne who had swelled, one hundred years earlier, to 22 stones, about 300 pounds.54 This long record of gendered eating patterns has a central position in Albano’s notion of framing, as she inquires into its cultural history from the late Renaissance to the present day. The gender consequences of her story remain foregrounded: what were the profiles of self-starving males? Have they been idealized – more recently – and then eroticized, in circumstances even remotely resembling Albano’s early-modern women? Albano’s framing surmounts the narrow limits of historical explanation usually offered for this phenomenon and, in parallel, opens up an examination of new pathways for contemporary anorexia: a transition of self-starvation from cultural practice to medical condition. In contrast, David Shuttleton’s treatment seems to resist metaphorization to this degree, appearing instead as the natural revenge on mankind of an English political system running amok in the aftermath of the seventeenth-century Revolution. But the chimera cannot endure: rhetorical and metaphorical smallpox better describes Shuttleton’s subject, a corrective to Raymond C. Anselment’s position that somehow smallpox the malady resisted figuration.55 Of course, smallpox had existed for centuries before the 1660s but was then becoming more visible, if also rhetorically handy, for those wishing to deface others with its mortal blemishes. One political faction after another in Britain (the situation abroad was different) was castigated with the dirty pox-label, proof of a fallen morality. Yet if the historical rise of smallpox (the variola) was framed in this pre-eminently political way, revolution and turmoil were not its only historical contexts. It was also useful to stir the imagination through shock and disfigurement: the disfiguring that occurs when a body has surpassed the point of recognition as in leprosy and – more recently – AIDS. The history of science also contributed to this dramatic new awareness of smallpox. The faculty of imagination – then almost a palpable anatomical organ in the generations after the effects of Cartesian dualism were felt – assumed new prominence in this heyday of competing mechanistic methodologies as the mother’s ability to imprint her foetus was being hotly debated. Shuttleton demonstrates how diverse types of\n\n24 Introduction\n\nsubjective voices – poets, writers, commentators, ephemeral scribblers, bluestockings, male and female – recorded their responses to the new disfigurement as having been conferred through the wreckage of diseased imagination. It is an intriguing story. Histories of smallpox are not usually presented in this rounded way. They are more routinely described in monochrome colours of the appearance and disappearance of a disease condition – as if illness were as colour insensitive as that. The political dimension of Shuttleton’s reframing can be expanded chronologically backwards and forward to enlarge the contexts of accepted political history. We might pose the question: What – in this vein pushing his heuristic methodology – has been the effect of smallpox on political leaders in different epochs? The disfigurement of the youthful Hal, for example, suggests one possibility: he had contracted smallpox in 1514 and so far emerged unscathed. Later on, his tantrums of the 1530s, leading to swollen rage, paranoia, and lust, may have been the result of syphilis, but they too seem not to have disfigured his body. Then he ruled as Henry VIII: the medically disordered leader but not through the routine disfigurement associated with maladies like smallpox. But smallpox was also rhetorical and metaphorical, as the deaths of several seventeenth-century English princes and princesses made evident. Moving forward to the last two centuries, would any western nation have been able to endure a leader thus marked and tarnished in the disfigurement of smallpox? F. D. Roosevelt served as a distinguished American president while suffering from poliomyelitis – could he have done so with smallpox? What has been the cultural genealogy of this particular disfigurement almost in the Foucaldian sense?56 Jane Weiss moves forwards two centuries – from the seventeenth to the nineteenth – across the ocean to America and from smallpox to cholera. It is not surprising that 1832 should figure as the great year in her story about the city on its way to becoming America’s largest: New York. What is new is her framing in terms of communities and their locally coded rhetorics. And her stunning demonstration that all parties were manipulated by a single dominant media – newspapers – is noteworthy and has not yet been analysed in previous discussions of the first crest of cholera in America. Here is medicine in deference to the press: it may cause readers to pause and ponder the degree to which it remains in the grip of that influential media almost two centuries later. Historically New York City was riveted by the invasive illness which ravaged it and punctured its daily rhythms. The infected were quickly brandished immoral by (so far) uninfected groups claiming to be the\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 25\n\nproud possessors of purity. This anti-Jobean mentality swiftly altered as segment upon segment, community after community, succumbed. Who, if any, were the genuinely pure and untainted in this hierarchy of moral dirt crowned by implied sexual excess? None, but it soon became evident that cholera was shattering all social norms and smashing its frames: it stopped at no borders in the march to expose the underlying enmity among social groups. Amidst this welter of abuse how were any medical facts of the epidemic established? Who could be trusted for any information – Weiss shows how today’s fact was savaged as tomorrow’s fiction. Medical reality (that glaring category again) altered daily: nothing, no one, could be relied on. Here then was another reframing caught in the inability of those in the dead heat of the moment to ascertain what was happening. If Weiss’ approach suggests a generalized cultural pattern it is this: disease is almost never framed in terms of conditions of certainty about the knowable; rather, it demonstrates the opposite – an inability to frame it adequately for lack of facts. Pamela Gilbert’s treatment of the same malady occurs two decades later in the 1850s and 15,000 miles away on the Indian subcontinent. Yet it assumes shapes of a different sort in maps and, perhaps unexpectedly, maps of life under the soil; demonstrating that frames for disease conditions are inherently open-ended, yielding to new approaches and refined interpretations and partaking of the plenitude commensurate with the human condition. Gilbert decodes this abundance of Victorian maps – literal, fantastic, utopian – to show how they projected a vision of civilized and savage places. Maps were thus an inherent part of the colonial enterprise: grafting, inculcating, projecting notions of British superiority measured against Bengali barbarism. But maps were not merely visual representations of suprasea-level life: they also charted the unseen, that which was below the earth. And it is in this subterranean domain of the unseen that Gilbert reveals an unknown chapter in the long evolution of cholera: its colonial mapping.57 A leitmotif also plays along in her chapter suggesting that every map of distant parts assumes one closer to home (i.e., the all-important home of the mapmaker). For Gilbert demonstrates how British metropolitan mapping of the entry of the cholera into London contrasts with the colonial mapping of it in the Indian cities. Here then – on maps – were coded representations of the differences between familiar urban and remote colonial spaces. This contrast may seem more pertinent to cholera’s anthropology and geography than to its medical history. But only if we accept the idea that medicine exists on discrete islands – apart,\n\n26 Introduction\n\nas it were, from the mainland of culture. Nineteenth-century cholera eventually came to imply many cultural codes among which was one presided over by the notion of the battleground: those fields where cultural wars would be fought out in different contexts: political, racial, colonial, sexual. Construed as companion chapters, those by Weiss and Gilbert could be viewed as aiming to describe something akin to ‘cultural cholera’: that is, diseases almost removed from their medical components. Malte Herwig tests the limits of some of these boundaries. He pushes further forward in time to the twentieth century and the reception of Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain (1924; English 1927). No previous epic-scale novel, in any language, had been so firmly grounded in medical content: an alpine sanatorium whose patients, doctors, staff, guests and quondam visitors form the main characters of the book. Everyone has some stake or other in the fate of tuberculosis. The conception and execution of the book, especially the imposition of medicine on this stratospheric world high up in the Alps (so high that the characters live in fog), was daring beyond most readers’ expectations. Add to this leap Mann’s degree of satire – particularly in his portrayal of doctors and their incredibly lucrative asylums for the rich – and you can see why his early readers were surprised by what they found, his medical readers often shocked or enraged. Herwig isolates this reading community after 1925 and shows that part of their response was grounded in self-interest rather than any aesthetic merits of one of the books for which Mann was awarded a Nobel Prize. His chapter constitutes important work: in considering the first thoroughly medical novel you want to know what contemporary doctors made of it. Compare The Magic Mountain with Tobias Smollett’s experimental medical novels (especially Roderick Random), Sterne’s Tristram Shandy where medical themes are exploited for the purposes of bawdry and ribaldry, and George Eliot’s Middlemarch which weaves Dr Lydgate’s career into Eliot’s vision of the fabric of a society, and you see the differences with the German work. Hitherto physician-readers of Mann’s book have posed as learned antiquarians or amateur historians of medicine: annotating medical procedures and explicating how this or that medical topic (e.g. pneumothorax) would have appeared in the 1920s or 1930s when the book was first being read. But Herwig shows how the book itself stimulated a medical debate about tuberculosis during the thirty years (1925–55) when there was still no guaranteed cure (streptomycin and other antibiotics were not administered until well after the end of the Second World War). Even more pertinently to the theme of framing\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 27\n\nat hand, he shows in which ways the book framed the malady. Usually cultural forces and institutions frame a malady: pumping life into it as a breathing organism rather than as a medical classification. In Herwig’s estimate The Magic Mountain acts a cultural force framing the illness: the arrows of influence have been, as it were, reversed. Only a philosopher of medicine could rise to this challenge and Herwig comes close to claiming Mann was one. Mann the philosopher of humanism and humanist heritage for western civilization has already been studied in great detail.58 But Mann the philosopher of framing – framing medicine in one of the greatest novels ever written – has only just begun to receive the attention he deserves. No one could reasonably assert that these first five frames are identical. Each scholar dwells on, or teases out, something else inside the frame. Each would compose the frame of another chapter in a slightly different way, emphasizing this or that nuance. This is as it should be: no matter how empirically grounded in the real world of facts and historical events, the framing of disease is no more monolithically uniform than the diagnosis of individual illness. All share a belief, however, that frames require contexts; houses of cultural history that must be adequately built. Without these, frames are bogus: they become edifices of words that lack all substance. Framing acts become more cumbersome than they were found to be in this first section when their interiors – the points where insides meet integuments – are themselves irrational. When you frame madness, to which our second section is devoted, something else happens. This topic we approach eclectically again, but not, we hope, without making the general point, common to all three chapters in this second section, that madness is itself culturally constructed to a very large degree.\n\nFraming and imagining madness This had been, of course, one of Foucault’s fundamental projects which spurred a generation of cultural and medical historians in the aftermath of the first English translation, in 1965, of Madness and Civilization: a History of Insanity in the Age of Reason. Even here, though, the majestic contributions of imaginative literature were largely omitted. Writers who foregrounded madness were either unread or deemed too unreliable in their imagined fictions of despair to figure in – all the more so for second- and third-rank writers. Such foregrounding, however, is what the scholars in our second part accomplish, each focusing on a component of, or moment in, the development of the ‘mad-trade’. Their approaches\n\n28 Introduction\n\nare each so different from one another that the three form salutary companions for the methodology of framing. Miranda Gill turns to a subject – eccentricity – that many have pondered, usually without an awareness of its historical contours. She frames eccentricity on the axis of sanity by gazing back at the continuum of Western European mental health since the mid-eighteenth century. Yet much that would impinge on post-Enlightenment theories of madness had changed since then: Newtonianism had risen and fallen, challenged by scientists more curious about the terraqueous globe than stars and planets, and replaced by the neo-Lamarckian life sciences, especially biological growth and the evolution of forms. Personal mood and mentality seem to have slipped out of the net of their concerns. A theory of insanity, developed in Britain by physicians such as William Battie and the Monro brothers, stirred debate about the sanity continuum, and within two generations (by 1830) a new science of psychiatry found itself being established as a valid field for medical research. Concurrently, a new sub-genre of writing about one’s own madness arose (in England, for example, the popular diaries of invalids in the Regency), which soon mushroomed into a small library of works by doctors and sufferers observing the compromised states of mind of the strange.59 The genuine leaders in theory, however, were French rather than British, especially in their famous medical schools in Paris where doctors such as Pinel, Esquirol, and eventually the illustrious Charcot in the 1830s, installed psychiatry as a major branch of the new medical science.60 In this march to medicalize and pathologize the mind, borders – shared with other medical discourses, other medical specialties, other maladies – remained contested zones. Here in this murky lagoon between healthy and sick minds, functional and dysfunctional, the battle over the definition of lunacy was waged. Where in this continuum did one sphere end and the other start? Where indeed were the exact boundaries? The meeting point – to extend this image of the biogeography of mental states – between picture and frame soon became the contested site for interpretation as all sorts of intermediate states were described in detail. Neurotic, hysteric, anxious, compulsive and depressive types became as intriguing to inquisitive doctors as the polarized healthy and sick patients. Somewhere among these, as Gill shows, was the eccentric, who existed on the tantalizing continuum of ‘a little bit mad/almost mad, not quite mad’. If eccentricity became a national British trait by the time Victoria ascended to the throne, it also developed a life and discourse of its own\n\nGeorge Sebastian Rousseau 29\n\nin nineteenth-century France, the country that led the way in establishing it as a pathological category. Across the Channel, in Britain, the ‘original’ had been its counterpart since the seventeeth century but was rarely medicalized. The English ‘original’ character type was attributed to odd British manners, morals, climate, even bogs and fogs, but not to biophysiological causes; and wh"
