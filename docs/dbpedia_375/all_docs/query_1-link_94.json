        "text": "May 4, 1987\n\n87-89 - Mt. Rainier - Missing Climbers\n\nLocation: Liberty Ridge\n\nTwo climbers on an extended climb on Mt. Rainier were reported to be overdue on Sunday May 31. The area had received new snow and windy conditions at the higher elevations over the weekend. A search was initiated on Monday, June 1, but the ground crew turned back due to snow drifts 3-5 feet high. Army helicopters were unable to fly due to the weather. On Tuesday the helicopters flew but saw no evidence of the climbers. Wednesday the helicopters dropped ground crews on the summit. The searchers returned by Wednesday night end reported that they had seen nothing to indicate the whereabouts of the overdue party. Today, Thursday, the helicopters are flying with infrared equipment aboard. The ground searchers have not gone up today.\n\nMay 8, 1987\n\n87-89B - Mount Rainier - Follow-up: Missing Climbers\n\nThe bodies of climbers J.W. and D.W. were recovered at approximately noon on Saturday, June 5. A private climbing party had spotted a tent flap protruding from the snow, on Thursday, June 4. They hiked to Sherman Hut (which took 1 day) to radio the information to park personnel. Saturday a helicopter was able to fly to the tent location on Liberty Ridge. Two climbers, one MPS and the other, Seattle Mountain Rescue/found the tent with the bodies of the climbers inside. No evidence of trauma was found.\n\nThe bodies were flown from the mountain. At 2:00pm a news conference was held by the Chief Ranger at park headquarters. The search had generated a great deal of media coverage in the Seattle area for the past 7 days. The coroner report shows cause of death due to asphyxiation. The brother of J.W. was present at the news conference. He praised park personnel for their efforts in the search.\n\nMay 26, 1987\n\n87-79 - Mount Rainier - Climbing Accident\n\nLocation: Mount Rainier\n\nA party of seven hikers were at the 9700' level of the mountain on Monday when two of them fell 2-300'. One suffered a broken ankle and possible head injuries; the other had minor injuries. Since the location is not accessible by helicopter, two NPS climbers are en route to the scene of the accident. No further information presently available.\n\nJune 5, 1987\n\n87-89A - Mount Rainier - Follow-up: Missing Climbers\n\nLocation: Tahoma Glacier\n\nNo signs of the climbers have been found. On Thursday, 6/4, the helicopter noticed tracks on Tahoma Glacier. After talking with family members there is the possibility that the climbers used this route as a route off the mountain. They have used it before.\n\nThe search has now been focused on the lower elevations of the mountain (6,000 feet and below), specifically, Tahoma Glacier. Ground searchers will begin again today. A dog team from the Seattle area has been requested. The NPS has contracted a helicopter for search purposes. The family of the missing party has also contracted a helicopter. The Army helicopters are no longer involved in this search. The upper levels of the mountain (6,000 to 8,000) have very low visibility due to rain which fell yesterday. Approximately 35 people are involved in the search, 7 of these are from Seattle/Tacoma Mountain Rescue. The rest are NPS personnel from Rainier National Park.\n\nThe party has been overdue for 7 days.\n\nJune 13, 1987\n\n87-100 - Mt. Rainier - Possible Suicide\n\nLocation: Steven's Canyon\n\nMr. C.P. was reported missing on June 8th. Rangers found him on the 13th - his car had gone off the road and plummeted 4-500' into Steven's Canyon. There were no skid marks. Suicide has not been ruled out as a possibility. C.P. was known to park rangers, and had a history of drug abuse.\n\nJune 29, 1987\n\n87-126 - Mount Rainier - Fatality: Climbing Accident\n\nLocation: Emmons Glacier\n\nK.F. was a member of a climbing party on the mountain. They had begun the last leg of the climb in the early hours of the morning and were crossing a snow bridge when it gave way. K.F. fell 80' into a crevasse and died of injuries. Because of warm weather and snow conditions, the body was not removed until the 28th.\n\nSeptember 14, 1987\n\n87-228 - Mt. Rainier - Fatality - MVA\n\nLocation: 1 mile South of White River Rd, Hwy 410\n\nR.G. was the driver of a vehicle which was pulling a trailer. The trailer began to fishtail and caused both vehicles to fall over the edge of the roadway and over an embankment. R.G. was pronounced dead at the scene. NPS personnel are investigating the accident.\n\nSeptember 27, 1987\n\n87-237 - Mt. Rainier - Apparent Homicide\n\nLocation: HWY 123, 1/4 mile South of Tunnel\n\nAn unidentified body was discovered approximately 30' over highway embankment. Park staff who are investigating the incident estimate victim had been dead for 4-5 days. One .45 caliber shell casing was found along the highway in the vicinity of the body. An autopsy is scheduled to be conducted on 9/27 by the Pierce County medical examiner. A joint NPS/FBI investigation is ongoing.\n\nOctober 19, 1987\n\n87-252 - Mt. Rainier - Fatality: Fall\n\nLocation: Naches Peak\n\nJ.A. was hiking the Pacific Crest Trail with his family. He parted from them on the 17th in order to climb Naches Peak. On his way back down from the ascent, he slipped on loose rock, fell 40', then rolled another 100'. His family advised the park that he was missing on the 17th. A search was initiated and his body was found the next day by Mountain Rescue Council searchers and search dogs.\n\nMarch 8, 1988\n\n88-34 - Mount Rainier - Avalanche Fatality\n\nLocation: Plummer Peak\n\nP.B.L. and S.M. were skiing in the Plummer Peak area on Sunday afternoon when P.B.L. was caught under an avalanche that was later determined to have been 60' wide, 120' long and from 2' to 10' deep. S.M. probed unsuccessfully in the snow for about an hour before skiing out and notifying park rangers. Two rangers and two climbers attempted to return to the site with S.M. late Sunday night, but had to turn back because of darkness and the high avalanche hazard. On Monday, a team composed of 11 Mt. Rainier employees, 10 members of local mountain rescue teams and three dog units began probing the avalanche. One of the dogs alerted at a point near the base of the avalanche, and searchers were subsequently able to find her body with probes.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, a high avalanche hazard was posted all day Sunday after Paradise received 10\" of snow on Saturday, bringing the overall total there to 130\". The avalanche hazard was still considered high on Monday.\n\nApril 12, 1988\n\n88-54 - Mt. Rainier - Search; Possible Suicide\n\nLocation: Longmire\n\nJ.D.K.'s car was found in the concession employee's parking lot at Longmire on Saturday, April 9th. A records check showed that he had been reported as missing on March 25th, and that he had last been seen in Mt. Vernon, Washington, on March 11th. He apparently arrived at Mt. Rainier on March 20th; his car was not noticed before as it was covered with snow and appeared to be an employee vehicle. A note has been found in the car which indicates that J.D.K. apparently came to the park to commit suicide.\n\nMay 16, 1988\n\n88-82 - Mt. Rainier - Search in Progress\n\nThree climbers who have been on the mountain since the 9th, failed to return from a summit climb as scheduled on the 14th. Rangers searched the mountain by airplane on the 15th with no clues. The search was to have been expanded today, but poor weather conditions are preventing the placement of searchers on the mountain.\n\nMay 18, 1988\n\n88-82 - Mt. Rainier - Follow-up: Search in Progress\n\nThe search for 3 overdue climbers is continuing with no new clues to the whereabouts of the three. An Army twin-rotor Chinook helicopter from Ft. Lewis dropped a 4 member search party on the summit on the 17th. The searchers found no signatures in the summit logs, indicating that the climbers had not reached the top. The search continued with the helicopter for 2 hours before weather conditions forced the ship to return to Ft. Lewis.\n\nOther searchers are working along the route planned by the climbers. Two Seattle Mountain Rescue Club members and a park ranger are at the Mystic Lake cabin and will begin searching along the base of the Liberty Ridge route.\n\nLast year, 2 climbers died on the same route when they were caught in a storm.\n\nJuly 5, 1988\n\n88-132 - Mt. Rainier - Rescue - Assistance to Other Agency\n\nLocation: Outside Park at Chinook Pass\n\nC.H., W. and T.H., ages not known, were stopped at a pullout just outside the park. C.H. and W.H. were playing around and fell 75 vertical feet and then rolled another 75 feet on a 40 percent slope. Rangers responded at the request of the Yakama County Sheriff's Office and and initiated CPR to C.H. who had suffered major injuries in the fall. T.H. had sustained only bruises and a possible broken wrist. Both victims were raised to the road and transported to the hospital. During transport T.H. became distraught over the incident and began creating a \"scene\". He was finally let out of the ambulance because the attendents could not handle him and care for C.H. Rangers picked T.H. up and held him until Sheriff's Deputies could respond. C.H. is currently on life support equipment and is not expected to live if it is removed.\n\nJuly 6, 1988\n\n88-131 - Mt. Rainier - \"Rescue\"\n\nLocation: Tahoma Glacier\n\nR.S., 43, was solo climbing when he fell and slid 300 feet before hitting a crevasse and falling an additional 30 vertical feet. Although he sustained broken ribs and possible internal injuries, R.S. used ice screws to climb out of the crevasse and then hiked 15 miles to his car. Because he was solo climbing and felt he had to rescue himself, R.S. refused assistance from at least one party on the mountain. Rangers heard of the incident and met R.S. at his vehicle. He wanted to drive himself home and seek medical help. Rangers convinced him that he should go by ambulance and he agreed. The local ambulance crew thought that the park's Westside Road was too rough for the victim and would respond only if the park was unable to transport R.S. by helicopter. The park was able to get a Ft. Lewis MAST helicopter for the transport.\n\nJuly 7, 1988\n\n88-133 - Mt. Rainier - Fatality\n\nLocation: Unicorn Peak\n\nA.G., 26, of Canton, Michigan, and E.M., age and address unknown, were attempting a climb of Unicorn Peak. During the climb, A.G. pulled out a large rock causing him to fall. He fell and rolled about 1,000 feet, with approximately 300 feet of vertical fall. E.M. climbed down after him, checked A.G. for vital signs, thought he felt a pulse and then left to get help. Rangers responded and found A.G. pulseless. The body had to be lowered down a steep 1,000 foot slope and then carried one and a half miles to the trail head. The body was turned over to the Lewis County Coroner.\n\nJuly 15, 1988\n\n88-143 - Mount Rainier - Mud Flow\n\nLocation: Tahoma Creek\n\nA jokulhlaups (mud flow) occurred about two miles below Round Pass on Tahoma Creek on the afternoon of the 14th. Mud and debris from 18 inches to four feet deep covered the entire Westside roadway for about 150 yards, stranding 21 visitors above the flow. All of them were able to walk out with assistance from park personnel, and there were no reported injuries. A helicopter was used to fly over the area to look for more stranded persons and to observe the general flow pattern. Road crew personnel were able to push their way through the debris, allowing the seven stranded vehicles to exit the area.\n\nJuly 29, 1988\n\n88-158 - Mt. Rainier - Earthquake\n\nOn Thursday, July 28, Mt. Rainier shook from an earthquake and associated aftershock of 4.5 and 3.5, respectively, on the Richter scale. The park has reported no damage other than rocks on the road.\n\nTuesday, March 21, 1989\n\n89-52 - Mount Rainier - Aircraft Accident with Fatality\n\nOn the morning of March 19th, a Cessna 210 piloted by 54-year-old W.S. of Rock Island, Washington, flew into Willis Wall at the 12,500' level of Mount Rainier. Rangers were able to spot the rear stabilizer section of the aircraft, but were not able to reach the accident site because of the extreme danger from falling rocks, ice and snow. W.S. was the only person on board and is presumed to have been killed. According to newspaper reports, W.S. had requested a turn while flying on instruments, and acknowledged the clearance after it had been given by an FAA controller. But flight control officials noted that W.S.'s plane did not turn when it approached the mountain. Radar contact was lost, and a search was begun immediately. The plane was found on Sunday by CAP searchers, and the park was then notified. It is not known when or if it will be possible to recover the victim's body because of the danger. (John Jensen, CR, MORA, via Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO; Associated Press, 3/19).\n\nMonday, May 15, 1989\n\n89-91 - Mount Rainier - Climbing Fatalities\n\nLast week, L.D., 26, S.N., 27, P.D., 26, and R.M., 33, all of the Lake Tahoe area, began an ascent of Mount Rainier. The four men divided into two teams when they got near the top of the peak, and L.D. and S.N. gained the summit on Thursday. On their way down, they found R.M.'s body at the 13,700 foot level, but found no sign of P.D. They continued their descent and alerted park rangers, who dispatched 30 searchers and three helicopters to look for P.D. On Saturday, the crew of an Army Chinook helicopter spotted his body at the 9,400 foot level on Carbon Glacier on the mountain's north side. A crew of six to eight climbers were prevented from retrieving the body because of thunderstorms which made it unsafe to fly in the area, but were to try again yesterday. It is thought that P.D. slipped off Liberty Ridge and fell to his death. (Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO, and Associated Press report).\n\nWednesday, June 21, 1989\n\n89-144 - Mount Rainier - Visitor Fatality\n\nOn the morning of the 19th, a passing motorist spotted a vehicle over an embankment a half mile above Cayuse Pass and about 400' below State Road 410. The driver, 60-year-old L.N., had been killed in the accident. The incident is currently under investigation. It has already been determined that there was an outstanding felony warrant against L.N. and that the incident may have been a suicide. (CompuServe message from RAD/PNRO).\n\nTuesday, August 29, 1989\n\n89-251 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Employee Injury\n\nSeasonal park ranger Nina Burnell, 26, and fellow climber Mark Ross, 28, ascended Mount Rainier to check climbing routes near the summit of the mountain. They reached the top around 8 a.m. on the 27th and were in the process of descending when they stopped to check a snow bridge around 13,500 feet. The bridge route had been abandoned by the guide service three days before because of the bridge's condition, but the guides had left a rope in place in case they needed to use the bridge in the future. Ross belayed Burnell across the bridge and was in the process of crossing himself when the bridge gave way. The pair fell 50 feet, and were partially buried in ice and snow. They were able to dig themselves out, however, and reported the accident via radio. Another group of climbing rangers and the guide service responded and provided assistance. Burnell and Ross were airlifted by military helicopter to local hospitals. Burnell has possible internal injuries, a fractured ankle and numerous cuts and bruises; Ross has possible fractured ribs. Note: Ross and Burnell are friends, and Ross was climbing with Burnell with park permission. Park policy requires that climbing rangers work in pairs and will allow \"known\", non-NPS climbers to work with rangers.

The victims were attempting to fly over the summit, but their plane apparently did not have the power needed to clear the peak. The crash activated the plane's emergency locator beacon, which was picked up by the Seattle air traffic control center. Four rangers were put aboard a Chinook helicopter from Fort Lewis the following morning and ascended to the 14,400' Columbia Crest area of the crater, where the wreckage was located. They discovered that R.M. had been killed on impact, but that R.B. had lived long enough to exit the plane. The cause of his death is unknown at this time. When found, the only upper garment he had on was a T-shirt, although his jacket was lying nearby and he was only 40 yards from the summit steam vents. (William Larson, MORA, via CompuServe message from Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO, noon EST, 1/22/90; supplemental information from United Press report, 1/21/90).\n\nWednesday, May 2, 1990\n\n90-87 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Successful Search\n\nOn April 29th, 55-year-old C.T. of Toronto, Canada, was found alive and in good health after being missing for more than a week on Mount Rainier. C.T. began hiking in clear weather on the 21st, but got caught in a blizzard that afternoon. He lost his compass and gloves, and found that he was walking in a circle when he attempted to get back down. C.T. had a tent, a sleeping bag, and just enough food for his planned overnight stay. He built camps throughout the week as he tried to make his way off the mountain, but confessed to losing hope of ever being found. About five feet of snow fell during the week. Up to 30 members of the Mountain Rescue Council searched for C.T. without luck on the 28th and 29th. Late on the 29th, a park ranger in a helicopter spotted him walking down the mountain and C.T. was subsequently rescued. He was examined at an area hospital and found to be in good condition. (UP report, 4/30/90).\n\nMonday, July 2, 1990\n\n90-163 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Fatality\n\nOn the evening of the 27th, K.V., 19, of Glide, Oregon, and V.P., 23, of Quincy, Washington, both employees of the park concessioner, were walking near Narada Falls when both fell into the river and were carried 100 yards downstream. Although they went through several rapids, K.V. was able to get to shore. She suffered leg fractures in several places, and was unable to pull herself completely out of the water. The two were reported missing by their fellow workers at the concession facility at Paradise around 9 a.m. the following morning. Searchers found their car in the parking area at Narada Falls, and found K.V. shortly thereafter. She was evacuated by litter and airlifted to Tacoma. V.P. was found a short distance away later in the day. He apparently drowned and was caught by two boulders. The exact circumstances are still under investigation. K.V. was the only witness and has been unable to talk at length. (Bill Larson, MORA, via CompuServe message from Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO, 6/29).\n\nTuesday, July 3, 1990\n\n90-169 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Air Crash with Multiple Fatalities\n\nAccording to a UPI story this morning, a small plane carrying six people crashed yesterday on the south slope of Mount Rainier, killing all aboard. Search planes found the wreckage near the 12,000-foot level of the mountain about five hours after the plane had disappeared from air traffic radar. The plane was a Cessna 210 owned by Aerowest Aviation which had been chartered by PRCA Pro Rodeo Cowboys, and the passengers were cowboys flying from Aurora, Oregon, to a rodeo in Ponoca, Alberta. The plane's ELT activated moments after it dropped off radar screens in the vicinity of the peak. Several planes and helicopters from Fort Lewis and Portland joined in the effort to find the downed plane. (UPI, 7/3).\n\nTuesday, August 7, 1990\n\n90-237 - Mount Rainier (Oregon) - MVA with Fatality\n\nAt 6 p.m. on August 5th, P.J., 24, of Tacama, Washington, was hit by a van as she attempted to turn her motorcycle into a pullout. Witnesses said that P.J. appeared to be somewhat inexperienced in handling a motorcycle, and that she had turned in front of the van. Her husband and child were on one of two other bikes in the group. She was airlifted to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead on arrival. (Telephone report from Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO, 8/6).\n\nWednesday, October 31, 1990\n\n90-393 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Search in Progress\n\nJ.K., 38, of Seattle, became separated from his skiing party at the mountain's 8,000-foot level early on the afternoon of Saturday, October 27th. When last seen, the weather conditions on the mountain were very poor. J.K.'s three companions waited for him for two hours; when he failed to return, they got in touch with rangers at Paradise. A team comprised of three rangers and two of J.K.'s friends searched for him without luck from 6:30 to 10:30 p.m. that evening. The search continued for him on Sunday with the aide of a helicopter and volunteer searchers, but high winds eventually forced the cancellation of the aerial operation. Plans were to continue the search on Monday. A snow advisory was in effect at that time, and it was thought that weather conditions would further hamper search efforts. (CompuServe message from Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO, 10/30).\n\nThursday, November 1, 1990\n\n90-393 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Follow-up on Search in Progress\n\nSearch teams continued to look for J.K., 38, of Seattle, on Tuesday, but couldn't get above 7,500 feet because of poor weather. Searchers and dogs were able to cover the area from the Nisqually River to Box Canyon, but found no trace of him. Poor visibility precluded the use of aircraft. The tentative plan for yesterday's operations called for the deployment of four teams of three searchers each. The weather forecast was for \"considerable accumulations\" of snow down to the mountain's 3,000-foot level. (CompuServe report from Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO, 10/31).\n\nTuesday, January 8, 1991\n\n91-4 - Mt. Rainier (Washington) - Climbing Fatality\n\nM.F., 26, of Anchorage, Alaska, and two companions were descending from Camp Muir at the mountain's 10,000-foot level on the morning of January 3rd when M.F. separated from the party to find a better route to the west. M.F. was on skis; his companions were not. They reached Paradise later that day and waited until 4:00 in the afternoon for him to appear. When he failed to arrive, they notified the park. A group of rangers and one of M.F.'s two partners searched for him throughout the night. At approximately 4:00 a.m. they found his tracks and followed them to the edge of a cliff, where they found skid marks, one of his ski poles, and a piece of climbing equipment. Later that morning, a helicopter found M.F.'s body about 1,000 feet below the cliff edge. (Bill Larson, NOCA, via CompuServe message from Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO, 1/7).\n\nTuesday, May 21, 1991\n\n91-166 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Climbing Fatality\n\nAt 4:00 a.m. on May 17th, J.T., 44, of Lakewood, Colorado, and L.S., 37, of Littleton, Colorado, began the last leg of an ascent of Mount Rainier. They left most of their equipment at Camp Muir, which is at 10,000 feet, and took only fanny packs with them. While crossing a snow bridge at 12,500 feet, both men broke through and fell and tumbled 150 feet into a crevasse. L.S. was able to get free, but was unable to extricate J.T. J.T. died of exposure and injuries about four to five hours later. It took L.S. a day and a half to climb out of the crevasse. He used J.T.'s crampons as hand-held aids in conjunction with his own crampons to ascend the crevasse wall, then started back toward Camp Muir. Meanwhile, a search had begun for the climbers. Although initially hampered by weather, a helicopter was finally gotten aloft on the 18th, and rangers on board soon spotted tracks around 9,000 feet. These were followed to around 5,500 feet, but were lost due to fog. Search efforts were halted by darkness, but rangers were posted on the roads in case the climbers made it out to a highway. One ranger left his vehicle to make tracks in the snow to aid the climbers if they came that way. He left a note in the car telling them to start the engine and warm up and that he would return shortly. When he got back to his car around 7:30 p.m., the ranger found L.S. inside. L.S. briefed rangers about the events which had taken place while being transported to a local hospital. As of yesterday afternoon, the park was reviewing the possibility of recovering J.T.'s body. Attempts are under way to find the crevasse. [Bill Larson, MORA, via SEAdog message from Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO, 5/20]\n\nTuesday, June 4, 1991\n\n91-195 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Rescue in Progress\n\nJ.S., 32, and C.P., 28, both of Colorado Springs, Colorado, were climbing the Liberty Ridge route on Mount Rainier on June 2nd when they began suffering from hypothermia and dehydration. Two rangers from Joshua Tree - Debbie Brenchley and Todd Swain - were climbing the mountain at the time while on vacation and came upon J.S. and C.P. around the 12,400-foot level. Brenchley, a former climbing ranger at Rainier, had been given a park radio while on her climb with Swain and was able to call park dispatch and request assistance. She and Swain stabilized J.S. and C.P. and stayed with them overnight. Two rangers and two MRA climbers were transported to the area via helicopter yesterday. The rescue party will assist the injured climbers to the landing zone, where an Army helicopter will airlift them off the mountain. [Bill Larson, MORA, via CompuServe message from Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO, 6/3]\n\nTuesday, July 30, 1991\n\n91-335 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Successful Rescue\n\nOn July 23rd, D.C., 21, of Castle Rock, Washington, slipped and fell down a steep 200-foot embankment on the Wonderland Trail between Panhandle Gap and Indian Bar. The incident was reported to the White River Ranger Station at 9:00 p.m., and rangers Mark Blaisdell and JoAnn Germano hiked all night and arrived at the scene at 4:30 a.m. the following morning. They found that D.C. had suffered a number of serious injuries, including a possible fractured left tibia, separated shoulder and multiple lacerations and bruises. Rangers Mike Mullen, Pam Cox, Sandy Lustig and SCA emergency hire Keith Nicholson hiked most of the way to the scene with technical rescue gear and a litter during the night, then were ferried the remaining distance by helicopter and lowered to the site of the accident. By noon, however, the weather had deteriorated dramatically, and the planned helicopter evacuation was cancelled. Rangers Chris Nash, Paul Giordanella, Joe Dreimiller, Berger Dodge, Peter Paul and Art Smart were then dispatched with additional supplies and equipment for another night's stay. Around noon on July 24th, a second hiker, L.H., 28, of Rochester, New York, fell in the same location while attempting to comply with rangers' instructions to leave the area safely. Initial reports indicated that she was uninjured, but it was later learned that she had probably fractured several ribs. By 9:00 p.m. that evening, both D.C. and L.H. had been evacuated off the slope and stabilized at a camp on the Wonderland Trail. A nine-person Tacoma Mountain Rescue team was dispatched to the camp to assist with the carryouts on the 25th. D.C. was sledded to a point above Summerland, then transferred to a wheeled litter. NPS teams, including a crew made up of rangers Cathy Bruno, Kyle Nelson, Laurie Axelson and SCA emergency hire Jeff Jacobs, carried L.H. out. [Randy Brooks, MORA, via CompuServe message from Diane Wisley, RAD/PNRO, 7/29]\n\nFriday, August 9, 1991\n\n91-384 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - MVA with Two Fatalities\n\nOn the afternoon of August 7th, a motor vehicle accident occurred one mile east of Backbone Ridge overlook. Two of the passengers in the 1972 VW hatchback were killed; the two survivors, both seriously injured, were airlifted to Yakima Memorial Hospital and are listed in critical condition. Two of the passengers one of whom was killed and the other of whom was injured were Norwegian citizens. The consulate in Seattle has been notified, but names are being held pending notification of families. An investigation into the cause of the accident is underway.

Both injured parties are now listed in stable condition and are expected to survive. From the evidence at the scene, it appears that the vehicle went off theroad due to driver inattention. There was a break in the trees on the right side of the road with a view of the valley below. It appears that the driver may have looked to the right and accidentally turned his wheel the way he was looking.

The vehicle operator summoned the park fire brigade and attempted unsuccessfully to contain the blaze with an extinguisher. The brigade was on scene in six minutes, but the vehicle was fully involved by that time. Although the truck was parked near other vehicles and park buildings, the firefighters were able to quickly extinguish the fire and prevent further damage. The operator stated that an electrical fire started under the dashboard on the passenger side when he started the truck, and that the entire cab was in flames within a few minutes. The pickup is a total loss. An investigation is continuing. [Dispatch, MORA, via SEAdog message from Mike Blankenship, RAD/PNRO, 8/19]\n\nWednesday, September 4, 1991\n\n91-447 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Two Climbing Fatalities\n\nOver the past weekend, two separate climbing accidents claimed the lives of climbers on Mount Rainier. On September 1st, two roped teams of two people each were attempting a summit climb when one of the teams fell into a crevasse at the 12,400-foot level about 300 feet above Disappointment Cleaver. One of the two climbers was killed; the second suffered injuries to the upper chest, possibly including broken ribs. The other team was able to extricate the surviving climber, and the trio spent the night on the mountain. A climbing party comprised of Rainier Mountaineering guides and their clients reached the three climbers around 7:30 the next morning and notified rangers of the situation. About 15 minutes later, the guides saw an unauthorized solo climber who was on the mountain about 300 feet below them slip and fall 700 to 800 feet. Two of the guides descended to check on him. They reached the victim at 8:40 and determined that he was dead. A Chinook helicopter was dispatched from Fort Lewis and recovered the injured climber, who was then transferred to a MAST helicopter which took him to Harborview Hospital. The bodies of the victims were removed by rangers and Army and Seattle Mountain Rescue personnel. Next of kin had not been notified at the time of the report, so names have not yet been released. All climbers were earned of the hazardous climbing conditions on the mountain during this period.

A team of rangers and maintenance workers from Carbon River, led by seasonal ranger Dave Halloran, an EMT, responded. A medical doctor and six other hikers also responded. J.T. was diagnosed as having a fractured pelvis, multiple fractures of the femur, an open fracture of the radius/ulna, pneumothorax, hypothermia and a possible ruptured spleen. He was stabilized, warmed, and prepared for a technical evacuation. An Army reserve Chinook helicopter and crew on training maneuvers in the park transported a technical rescue team led by ranger Steve Winslow from Paradise/Longmire to the scene of the accident. A Tacoma Mountain Rescue Council team was flown in from Fort Lewis by MAST helicopter. Based on recommendations by the doctor on scene and an evaluation by the MAST pilot, a medic was lowered by hoist to the site and J.T. was raised by hoist about 200 feet and flown to a local hospital, where he's reported to be in good condition.

His mother entered the water in an attempt to rescue him; at one point, she had the boy by his hair, but was unable to hold on to him. A.T., a visitor from Mount Vernon, Washington, heard cries for help, ran to the river from the picnic area at the Grove of the Patriarch, and dove repeatedly in the river in an attempt to reach A.A., who'd become trapped in a ten-foot-deep pool. At the same time, ranger Tammy Wilson, who was working at the Steven's Canyon entrance booth, radioed for assistance, closed the booth and headed for the river. As rangers arrived with rope, A.T. again dove, finally reached A.A., and pulled him to shore. By that time, he'd been submerged for between seven and 14 minutes. A visiting nurse and two doctors helped rangers administer CPR. A MAST medevac helicopter then flew the boy and his mother to a local hospital. Despite all efforts by hospital doctors, however, A.A. succumbed at 9:30 p.m. that evening.

As Brooks was attempting to catch and remove the hounds, the branch on which the cougar had sought refuge broke, causing it to fall about 30 feet to the ground. The hounds resumed the chase and again treed the cougar about a quarter mile further up the ridge. During the second attempt to either capture or drive away the dogs, one charged Brooks, who shot and killed all three hounds in order to protect both himself and the cougar from harm. The dog's owner, who lives near the park in Packwood, Washington, had previously been cited by a ranger for running dogs off leash. The cougar hunting season is open outside the park, but the dogs' owner did not have a cougar hunting tag at the time. He had released the hounds outside the park, then lost track of them.

The search eventually involved over 70 personnel from three mountain rescue groups, over a dozen NPS employees, several Rainier Mountaineering guides, and two avalanche search dogs. All of the teams were supported by private and military helicopters. On March 10th, park teams led by rangers Steve Winslow, Garry Olsen, and Steve Klump searched Fuhrer's Finger and adjacent glaciers. Rainier Mountaineering owner Lou Whittaker, who was assisting as a spotter on a military helicopter, saw a boot at the base of an avalanche debris area at the 8,400-foot level below Fuhrer's Finger. Shortly thereafter, the ground teams found the bodies of J.V. and G.T. at that location. Indications are that the climbers were descending Fuhrer's Finger when they were swept down the mountain in an avalanche. The coroner will be examining the victims to determine the exact cause of death.

Some time later, the group divided; three of the climbers - W.P., 28, T.D., 27, and P.B., 29 - continued up the mountain, while the fourth climber remained at their base camp at 11,100 feet. On Tuesday, the climber who remained behind heard someone call his name and shout what sounded like \"go for help.\" The climber headed back to Camp Muir and called for help from an emergency radio there that afternoon. Three rangers climbed overnight to Camp Muir, then were picked up by an Army Chinook helicopter and flown higher up the mountain, where they spotted the three climbers at the 12,000 foot level. The rangers were dropped off slightly above the climbers and at the time of the report were making their way toward them. The rescue team planned to guide the climbers down the mountain to the next spot where the helicopter could land and pick them up. According to NPS spokesman Cy Hentges, only one of the climbers was experienced in climbing in snow and ice. The trio had left most of their gear at their base camp and apparently had only one sleeping bag and a bivouac sack with them.

They reported that they had been unable to find their way down the mountain due to bad weather. The three rangers who comprised the initial response team were Rick Kirschner, Garry Olson and Steve Winslow. They climbed to Camp Muir throughout the evening of the 21st, encountering 50 to 60 mph winds and white-out conditions during their ascent, and arrived in camp at 1:30 a.m. on the 22nd. After a few hours' rest, they were transported by helicopter to the 12,800-foot level, then climbed another few hours before reaching the missing climbers. The rangers were assisted by the military and several state mountain rescue units.

Late on the 30th, S.S. became hypothermic, and J.R. decided to leave him on the Columbia Crest rim and go for help. S.S., however, was able to make it to Camp Muir by the following morning; he contacted another climbing party there, who radioed down that S.S. had lost touch with J.R. and didn't know where he was or in which direction he'd gone. Rangers Steve Winslow and Joe Driemiller left Paradise and headed for Camp Muir to meet S.S.. They found him suffering from dehydration and frostbite; after spending a night in the camp with him, the rangers descended to Paradise with S.S., where he was evacuated to a hospital in Puyallup. A Bell 206-B from Aerocopters in Seattle was brought in for an initial search of the mountain and to lift a search team to the peak, and a Chinook from Fort Lewis was en route for high altitude search and team insertion. Further information on the search will follow.

About 90 minutes later, the Yakima detachment of the Washington State Patrol notified the park that they'd received a call from a climbing party with a cellular phone on Ingraham Flats reporting that a climber was immobilized at the top of Disappointment Cleaver. Rangers also learned that the victim, T.C., 39, was a member of a three-person party that had successfully climbed Fuhrers Finger the previous day. As they were descending via Disappointment Cleaver, T.C. started showing signs of poor judgement and breathing difficulties. His party placed him in a sleeping bag in a bivie sack and left him with food and water while they went for help. T.C.'s partners contacted another party on Ingraham Flats, and they had made the call to the state patrol. Due to the late hour and the altitude involved, it was not possible to rescue T.C. by helicopter. The party at Ingraham Flats offered to assist in the rescue with four of their strongest climbers. Ranger Ken Davis and three Rainier Mountaineering guides took rescue gear and oxygen from Camp Muir to the top of the Cleaver, then lowered T.C. to Camp Muir. T.C. was somewhat dehydrated but appeared to be in fair condition. At the time of the report, plans called for the parties to descend to Paradise following a rest at Camp Muir.

The incident occurred around noon; although J.D. began calling for help, it wasn't until about 5:00 p.m. that he was heard by the Camp Schurman climbing ranger. The ranger ascended to the 11,000-foot level of the glacier and found Davidson in a very hypothermic state. The ranger and two independent climbers provided initial assistance to J.D., and the ranger descended about 80 feet into the crevasse and confirmed that M.P. had been killed. The party helped J.D. descend to Camp Schurman. At the time of the report yesterday morning, a helicopter from Bluebird Helicopters was flying a party of four climbers to the camp. J.D. was to be flow down and treated, and the climbers were preparing to ascend to the crevasse and recover M.P.'s body.

The call had come by cellular phone from the party's leader. T.H. had fractured his ankle the day before. Although his boot was removed and his foot was packed with ice, it became obvious by the following day that evacuation would be necessary. A Chinook helicopter was requested from Fort Lewis and arrived on scene just before noon. Three rangers flew to the summit and retrieved T.H. and the rest of his party. All three climbers are very experienced and made no obvious errors. [Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO, 6/26]\n\nThursday, July 23, 1992\n\n92-368 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Rescue\n\nEarly on the morning of July 21st, M.M., G.G. and R.L., all employees of GSI, the park concessioner, left Camp Muir en route to Paradise in total whiteout conditions and soon became disoriented. They eventually came upon some campers on the Muir snowfield and were advised to continue in a southeasterly direction. This route was actually far east of the normal descent route from Muir, and all three hikers ended up sliding down a steep 200-foot-long section of snow into a band of rocks. G.G. sustained possible head and neck injuries and injuries to her extremities; R.L. had a possible dislocated knee and elbow injury; M.M.'s ankle was badly sprained and he suffered various lacerations. Since M.M. was the least injured, he was able to hike out to Paradise and contact rangers. A search was mounted, but it took almost three hours for rangers to locate the injured pair because of the whiteout conditions and the sketchy directions M.M. gave them. Litters and emergency equipment were brought in with the assistance of maintenance employees, and a carryout was begun in mid-afternoon. The 25 employees who assisted in the rescue had the pair back to Paradise in just under three hours. All three individuals were treated and released.

[Mark Forbes, RAD/PNRO, 9/18]\n\nTuesday, June 29, 1993\n\n93-416 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Rescue\n\nOn the evening of June 27th, V.P., 25, and T.S., 20, were scrambling up a steep rock slope near Cougar Rock campground when both fell an undetermined distance. Campers advised rangers that they'd heard a rock slide somewhere above them in the quarry area around 8:30 p.m., and that they'd heard a cry for help about two hours later. Responding rangers ascertained that V.P. had sustained severe head injuries, and that T.S., his nephew, had probably fractured one of his legs. A hasty team, which was comprised of 15 park personnel, two Rainier Mountaineering employees, and an unspecified number of Fire District 23 employees, initiated a technical rescue. Fixed lines were utilized for the descent, as the accident site was several hundred vertical feet above the nearest access. Due to the nature of V.P.'s injury, a MAST helicopter was requested. The pilot employed night vision goggles to land the helicopter at the Kautz Creek heliport and evacuate V.P. At the time of the report, he had undergone three hours of surgery, but there was no word on his condition. T.S. was released from the hospital with contusions to his back and one leg. Alcohol may have been a contributing factor. [R.

The climbers had spent the night at the camp after completing a climb of Liberty Ridge. D.M. was unable to get his boots on in the morning due to the extent of the frostbite. A ground rescue team of four rangers and two Rainier Mountaineering guides was dispatched and reached the party around 10 p.m. that evening. It was determined that the safest method for carrying D.M. out would be to wait until first light before beginning the evacuation. The team started its descent at 6 a.m. Members of the Mountain Rescue Council met the group and provided additional and much-needed assistance. A group of six SCAs provided additional help for the portion of the carry-out from Glacier Basin to White River campground. D.M. was transported by privately-owned vehicle to Enumclaw fairgrounds, where he was picked up by an Airlift Northwest helicopter and taken to a hospital in Seattle.

Responding rangers found that two people had been killed and that four others required advanced life support. All four were medevaced by helicopter. Accident investigators determined that a 25- passenger, privately-owned bus had been heading north on the highway when the driver lost control as it came upon a construction site where a line of traffic was waiting at a stop light. The bus collided with three southbound motorcycles from a Tacoma motorcycle club, then struck three northbound vehicles - a Chevy Blazer, a compact pickup and a passenger sedan - that were waiting at the light. Killed were R.H. and M.H. of Tacoma; seriously injured were J.S. and R.S. of Graham, Washington, and Don and P.B. of Puyallup, Washington. Twenty-three NPS employees responded to the accident along with Washington State Patrol officers, three ambulances, two military MAST helicopters, a commercial air ambulance, and a state vehicle inspection team.

Kenny, however, was able to stop his fall after about 20 feet; he called for help, and members of another climbing party came to his rescue. They then located A.B., who was unconscious and bleeding internally. When A.B. stopped breathing, a registered nurse in the assisting party began CPR, which she continued until rangers arrived on scene. Doctors at Madigan Army Hospital subsequently advised them to terminate rescue efforts when A.B. failed to respond. The body was carried out and turned over to the county medical examiner. An investigation is underway. A.B. was a faculty member at the school of business at Portland State University.

State police officers are investigating the accident. No further details are yet available. [Bill Larson, MORA, 1/21]\n\nWednesday, July 27, 1994\n\n94-423 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Rescue\n\nLate on the afternoon of July 21st, M.H., 24, of Lakewood, Ohio became ill while at Camp Muir with his climbing party of six. M.H. went from normal activity to unconsciousness in less than 10 minutes. Though only at 10,000 feet, M.H. showed classic signs of cerebral edema. A doctor at the scene made the diagnosis, which was concurred with by the park medical advisor. Rangers at Camp Muir, assisted by guides from Rainier Mountaineering and M.H.'s climbing party, loaded him onto a sled while administering high flow oxygen. M.H.'s climbing party, led by a climbing ranger, then began a rapid descent. Meanwhile, ranger Scott Wanek ran two miles from Paradise to Pebble Creek to set up a landing zone for the helicopter. A MAST helicopter landed at the 7,000-foot level near the creek just as light was fading and picked M.H. up. M.H. began convulsing while on board the helicopter, so was flown directly to Harborview Hospital in Seattle. He subsequently regained consciousness and is expected to make a full recovery. This operation was especially difficult, as the incident occurred just before dark and conditions for the helicopter pickup were marginal. The situation was further complicated by the need to sled M.H. down to a point below 7,000 feet, which was the upper elevation the MAST helicopter was able to reach. Because of these conditions, Wanek had to run the two miles - with a vertical gain of about 2,000 feet - to set up the landing zone. The MAST air mission commander called the park the next day to commend Wanek for his efforts; he said the landing zone was the best he had flown into and that he would use it as an example for his troops.

W.O.'s two companions told rangers that they last saw him around 3 a.m. when they were all sitting and drinking by a campfire. They also reported that W.O. was intoxicated and may have been using drugs. Around 6 a.m., they found that he was gone; following unsuccessful efforts to find him, they advised rangers that he was missing. A hasty search of the area surrounding the campground was conducted, campers were interviewed, and checks were made with local law enforcement agencies, but all proved fruitless. The site where W.O. and his friends were camping is the closest one in the campground to the Carbon River, which is currently running at high volume. A helicopter that was working in the park was employed to make a low level aerial search of the river, but no sign of W.O. was found. Both air and ground scent dogs were brought into the search on the morning of the 27th.

The crash, which occurred around 3 p.m., was reported by cellular phone by a visitor who'd witnessed the crash. The four occupants were taken by helicopter to a hospital in Yakima just before dark. The pilot refused treatment; two of the passengers were treated and released, and the third was transferred to a hospital in Seattle. Further details will be provided following investigation by the FAA and NTSB. Statements from the pilot indicate that he was flying up a draw too slowly to gain sufficient altitude to clear the end of the draw. Since it was also too narrow to turn around, he set the Cessna down in the trees.

V.G. and a friend, Scott Houghton, had ascended to the Anvil Rock area above Paradise, then had become separated while skiing downhill. Two rangers searched the area as far as Glacier Vista on Saturday evening, but were unable to find him. Houghton and three rangers resumed the search the following morning, and found V.G. in the vicinity of the Moraine trail that afternoon. Although he suffered a minor hip injury and had broken a ski binding, he was able to walk from the area. Rangers were assisted by eight people from Tacoma Mountain Rescue and two from Rainier Mountaineering. [Bill Larson, MORA, 11/6]\n\nTuesday, November 22, 1994\n\n94-650 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Illegal Commercial Use Convictions\n\nDuring the 1993 climbing season, rangers conducted an investigation into a company that was guiding visitors on summit climbs of Mount Rainier without a commercial use permit. The park was concerned about both legal issues and the safety of visitors being guided up the mountain. The company, Yeti, Inc., is owned and operated by T.B., who was convicted of guiding without a permit in 1990 and has been engaged in an intensive letter writing campaign with the park ever since. The investigation encompassed several incidents in which the company attempted to guide visitors on climbs of the mountain, and culminated in the issuance of violation notices to T.B., several guides in his employment, and the owner of a second, related guide service in Alaska. The last of a series of trials was held this September; three parties were found guilty, and the district court judge issued the following sentences in October:\n\n* T.B. received a year's probation, 48 hours in jail, a $500 fine, and was barred from entering the park during the probationary period. * Do.B., a guide for Yeti, Inc., was fined $250. * S.R., another guide for the company, was also fined $250.\n\nCharges were dismissed against D.B., owner of Alaskan Extreme Adventures, an associate of Yeti. D.B. had spent several days in jail for failing to appear in court on NPS charges. At his arraignment, the U.S. attorney's office dismissed charges against him, as they felt it was not worth the expense of moving D.B. from Alaska to Washington for a trial. [Bill Larson, MORA, 11/15]\n\nThursday, December 15, 1994\n\n94-672 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Suicide\n\nOn the evening of December 11th, the Lewis County sheriff's office asked park staff to be on the lookout for M.T., 38, of Seattle, who might be attempting suicide somewhere in the area. Rangers found his vehicle within the hour, and discovered his body across from the National Park Inn shortly thereafter. M.T. had shot himself. [Bill Larson, MORA, 12/12]\n\nFriday, February 3, 1995\n\n95-43 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Quake Impacts; Road Closure\n\nThe road to Paradise was closed on February 2nd and will remain closed until crews locate and repair water lines which were damaged during the 5.0 earthquake which struck the Puget Sound area on the evening of January 28th. Water service is now out to all facilities at Paradise, a popular winter area. The exact cause of the problem is still under investigation. Efforts to fix the problem have been hampered by a snow accumulation of between 15 and 20 feet throughout the area. No damage estimates are currently available, nor is it certain when Paradise will reopen. [J. Milton, MORA, 2/1]\n\nTuesday, February 28, 1995\n\n95-80 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Rescue\n\nRangers at Paradise received notification that D.O., 44, of Kent, Washington, had fractured his ankle while descending the Ingraham Glacier at the mountain's 13,000-foot level on Sunday, February 26th. A cooperative rescue effort was initiated by rangers, Rainier Mountaineering guides, members of Tacoma Mountain Rescue, and aircraft and crews from the county sheriff's office and the Army. D.O. was stabilized, then airlifted from the site by an Army Chinook helicopter. [Comm Center, MORA, 2/27]\n\nWednesday, April 12, 1995\n\n95-147 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Search and Rescue\n\nWhen M.J., 64, of Seattle failed to return from a snowshoeing trip from Paradise to Camp Muir on April 10th, rangers were advised and initiated a search in conjunction with members of the Washington Mountain Rescue Council. M.J. was found in good condition the following morning. [Bill Larson, MORA, 4/11]\n\nThursday, April 13, 1995\n\n95-147 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Follow-up on Search and Rescue\n\nM.J., 64, of Seattle, who was found by rangers and SAR team members on April 11th, was located after a ranger found his tracks leading to a snow pile at the 7,000-foot level of the mountain early that morning. Voice contact was made with him, and he was evacuated from the area. Investigation revealed that M.J., an experienced climber, had climbed to Anvil Rock at 9,000 feet, then had encountered heavy snowfall and lowering visibility. In near white-out conditions, M.J. located some wands leading down from his position, which he followed until he lost sight of them. Realizing that he'd drifted eastward from the trail, M.J. utilized his snowshoes to dig a small snow cave. He was not prepared for inclement weather, and was suffering from mild hypothermia when found. M.J. also has a history of heart problems. [Lance Gillispie, MORA, 4/11]\n\nThursday, June 8, 1995\n\n95-277 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Search\n\nA search was begun early this week for two climbers - J.H., 24, and C.W., 20 - who were overdue from their attempt to climb Mount Rainier via the Liberty Ridge route. The pair started their climb on Friday, June 2nd, and planned to return on Monday, June 5th. A climbing team comprised of rangers and Mountain Rescue Council volunteers left White River Tuesday afternoon, and other teams were preparing to fly to the mountain top when weather cleared. Shortly after noon yesterday, however, the two men were found descending the mountain via the Emmonds Glacier route. Both were okay. [Linda Whitson, PNRO, 6/7]\n\nMonday, June 19, 1995\n\n95-309 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Search and Rescue\n\nOn the evening of June 6th, the park received a call from the 911 dispatcher for Columbia County, located near St. Helens, Oregon. The dispatcher had received a cell phone call from a person who said he'd fallen while climbing on Eagle Peak in Mount Rainier and was injured. The call was very scratchy, and the operator had a difficult time understanding the caller. A total of five calls were made, but the operator was never able to get the person's cell phone number. A searcher was sent up the Eagle Peak trail to evaluate the situation, and came upon a person who identified himself as the victim's climbing partner. He reported that the victim, C.R., 20, had a fractured leg. An eight-person team found C.R. near the top of the peak but on steep, rotten and crumbly rock. A Mast helicopter was accordingly called in, which picked up two rangers and dropped them at the location. They determined that C.R. had suffered injuries to various parts of his body sustained as a result of a 20-foot fall. He was evacuated by air, then taken by ambulance to a local hospital. [Bill Larson, MORA, 6/15]\n\nMonday, June 26, 1995\n\n95-331 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Bomb Threat; Attempted Abduction; Pursuit\n\nThe concession manager at the Paradise Inn called the park's communications center on the evening of June 24th to report a disturbance in the hotel's lobby. J.R., 34, of Spanaway, Washington, had entered the hotel through the kitchen and had begun acting irrationally, shouting and threatening to blow up the mountain. J.R. was escorted from the inn by the manager. When he reached the parking lot, J.R. attempted to abduct a park visitor and force him into a vehicle. The visitor was able to break free, however, and fled back to the inn. J.R. then broke into a guest's car and attempted to hot-wire it before leaving the area in his own vehicle. Rangers pursued him, but J.R. refused to stop. The chase continued outside the park until local officers stopped J.R. by flattening his vehicle's tires on a highway near Eatonville. J.R. then held two wires, claiming they were attached to a bomb, and commandeered a state patrol vehicle in an attempt to flee the area. Troopers again flattened the vehicle's tires, and were able to subdue and arrest J.R.. Due to earlier threats to blow something up and the fact that wires and blasting caps were recovered at the scene of the arrest, Paradise Inn guests were evacuated to the concession facilities in the visitor center until the inn could be secured. Members of the explosive ordnance disposal team from Fort Lewis searched the inn and the Rainier Mountaineering guide house. No bomb was found, and visitors were permitted to return to their rooms. J.R. is being held in the county jail until charges can be filed against him. The FBI is assisting in the investigation. [Lance Gillispie, MORA, 6/25]\n\nTuesday, July 18, 1995\n\n95-418 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Rescue\n\nOn the morning of July 14th, E.W., 36, was attempting to climb the Liberty Route with his partner, K.D., at the 8,500-foot level of Mount Rainier when he lost his footing and tumbled about 40 to 50 feet down a steep scree slope, fracturing his lower left leg. K.D. hiked out to Carbon River, where he reported the incident at 6 p.m. that evening. Rangers flew to the scene via commercial helicopter, stabilized E.W., and moved him to a landing zone on Carbon Glacier, where he spent the night with the rescue party. E.W. was flown off the glacier early the next morning and taken to a local hospital. [Bill Larson, MORA]\n\nThursday, July 20, 1995\n\n95-434 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Search in Progress\n\nA search is in progress for 39-year-old R.F., who disappeared in the park on July 17th. R.F. was involved in a single vehicle accident in the park that morning. After the investigation was completed and her vehicle was pulled out of a ditch, she continued on her way. Several hours later, the vehicle was found in a picnic area parking lot with the engine running and the driver's door open. Rangers found a broken drinking glass and blood spatters in the nearby restroom. They searched the area, but found no sign of her. Investigation revealed that R.F. had not been taking prescribed medicine, that she was depressed, paranoid, and suicidal, and that she'd tried to take her life at a relative's home that morning. Searchers have so far found no physical evidence, but two visitors reported seeing someone meeting her description at locations near the search site. [Bill Larson, MORA]\n\nMonday, August 14, 1995\n\n95-516 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Employee Fatalities\n\nTwo summer seasonal employees were killed when they fell while reponding to a report of an injured climber on the Emmons Glacier sometime during the night of August 12th. A three-person park rescue team left Camp Schuman to rescue the climber. One member of the group became ill, however, and was forced to return to camp. The remaining two employees were equipped with overnight gear and continued on. The last radio contact with them was around 11:30 p.m., when they reported their position as between 12,800 and 12,900 feet. They also reported that weather conditions were \"cold and windy\" and that the going was very slow due to accumulated ice. When contact was lost with them, a military Chinook helicopter from Ft. Lewis was called in to remove the injured climber and insert park ground search teams in the vicinity of their last reported position. An aerial search led to the discovery of their bodies at the 12,000 foot level on the Winthrop Glacier. Names have not been released pending notification of next of kin. Additional details will be provided as they become available. [Lance Gillespie, MORA]\n\nThursday, August 17, 1995\n\n85-516 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Follow-up on Employee Deaths\n\nThe park has released the names of the two employees who were fatally injured in the climbing accident on Mount Rainier on Saturday. Killed were seasonal climbing ranger Sean Ryan, 23, of South Nyack, New York, and SCA Phillip Otis, 22, of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The two were en route to the 13,400-foot level of the Emmons Glacier to assist a climber with a broken ankle when they fell about 1,200 feet to their deaths. Ryan was in his second season at Mount Rainier, having worked at the park as an SCA in 1994. Otis was in his first season. There will be a service for them for park employees and close friends today; a public service will be held in Seattle early next week for employees from other parks and agencies and the public. Funeral services will be held in New York and Minnesota during the next several days. Parks in the Pacific Northwest have lowered their flags to half staff until tomorrow morning. Further details on where to send notes of condolence will appear as soon as the information becomes available. [Lance Gillispie, MORA; Mark Forbes, PNRO]\n\nWednesday, August 23, 1995\n\n95-516 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Follow-up on Employee Deaths\n\nAdditional information has been received on where to send condolences and contributions in memory of seasonal climbing ranger Sean Ryan and SCA Phillip Otis, who were killed last week while attempting to rescue an injured climber on Mount Rainier. Cards and letters should be sent to the families in care of the park (Mount Rainier NP, Tahoma Woods Star Route, Ashford, WA 98304). Phillip is survived by his father, Todd Otis, his mother, Margaret Wurtele, and his stepfather, C. Angus Wurtele. Memorials should be directed either to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, or to the National Outdoor Leadership School in Lander, Wyoming. Sean is survived by his parents, Judith and William Ryan. The family has asked that memorials be sent to either of the following: Sean H. Ryan Wilderness Preservation Fund, PO Box 881, Nyack, NY 10960-0881, or Sean H. Ryan Nyack Memorial Fund, PO Box 472, Nyack, NY 10960-0472. Donations may also be made to the Mount Rainier Search and Rescue Fund, Mount Rainier National Park, Tahoma Woods Star Route, Ashford, WA 98304. Checks to the latter should be made payable to DOI/National Park Service. Both the families and the park's staff sincerely appreciate the support they've received from everyone in the Service. [John Krambrink, CR, MORA]\n\nWednesday, August 23, 1995\n\n95-542 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Climbing Fatalities\n\nTwo members of a team of three Seattle area climbers were killed on the afternoon of August 20th when they fell 2,400 feet from the mountain's 11,000 level, landing in a crevasse. Responding rangers found the third climber still alive, but suffering from severe head and airway trauma. He was airlifted from the scene and taken to a local hospital. Names of all three victims are being withheld pending notification of relatives. The park reports that recent storms have encased the upper mountain with bare ice, making climbing hazardous, with little margin for error. Climbers are being urged to use extreme caution on all routes. [Bill Larson, MORA]\n\nFriday, September 1, 1995\n\n95-582 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - MVA with Two Fatalities, Four Injured\n\nShortly after noon on August 30th, the driver of a 1988 Ford Taurus carrying five passengers lost control of his vehicle, which rolled over before plunging nearly 200 feet down a steep talus slope. The five passengers were all ejected from the vehicle. Two of them were killed. A male passenger suffered a broken neck and had to be raised 100 feet by technical means before being flown by commercial medivac helicopter to Harborview Hospital in Seattle. A second male passenger had to be raised about 50 feet, and a female passenger crawled to the side of the road. They were both taken by ambulance to a military medivac helicopter waiting outside the park, then flown to the same hospital. One survivor is currently listed in critical but stable condition; the other two are in serious but stable condition. A state investigation team and the SSO law enforcement specialist are assisting the park in its investigation. [Christine Davies, MORA Comm Center]\n\nMonday, December 4, 1995\n\n95-755 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Flooding; Partial Closure\n\nHigh water caused by heavy rains and snow melt led to flooding and partial closure of some areas of the park on November 28th. The Paradise/Longmire area in the southwest corner of the park received over six inches of rain in a 24- hour period and over 15 inches of rain during a six-day period. Rivers crested at three feet above flood stage and damaged roads, trails, bridges and other park facilities. On November 29th, seven campers were evacuated by helicopter from the Carbon River area when the state road leading to the park was destroyed by flooding. Flooding outside the park was even more severe and closed many access roads to Mount Rainier. Two routes on the east side of the park were kept open to provide access to services for neighboring communities. Longmire was reopened on the 30th; on December 1st, the road to Paradise was reopened. Damage assessments are underway. Snow is rapidly covering the damage caused by the floods, however, thereby making damage assessment difficult. [Bill Larson, MORA]\n\nFriday, December 15, 1995\n\n95-775 - Pacific Western Area Parks - Follow-up on Storm Damage\n\nAdditional reports have been received from the Pacific West Field Area regarding the impact of the severe storm which struck the West coast earlier this week:\n\n* Mount Rainier - The National Weather Service issued a high wind warming for the area on Tuesday morning. Damaging winds of from 50 to 80 mph were forecast, so the park implemented emergency operations under incident command. Visitors were evacuated from Paradise and other higher elevations where greater wind speeds were predicted. The road from Nisqually to Longmire and from Longmire to Paradise was closed overnight due to high winds and falling trees and limbs. Danger from wind-thrown trees was significantly increased by the saturation of the ground by over 30 inches of rain that fell on the area during November and early December. Visitors were also evacuated from Sunshine Point campground. The park helped employees, residents, concessioners and contractors to prepare for damaging winds and power outages. Safety zones and shelters were established and supplied in the Longmire warehouse for overnight use. Fortunately, the storm tracked just west of the park. Some fallen trees and other debris had to be cleared, and power outages occurred in several areas. All recovery efforts concluded yesterday and the park was back to normal operations.\n\n[J.R. Tomasovic, GOGA; Jane Sikoryak, REDW; John Krambrink, MORA; George Buckingham, CRLA; Larry Carr, WHIS; Pete Cowan, NOCA; Don Neubacher, PORE]\n\nFriday, January 19, 1996\n\n96-16 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Search and Rescue\n\nWinter campers D.J. and K.H. were caught in a storm during their overnight trip to Camp Muir last weekend. On Sunday, they contacted park rangers by cellular phone to report that they were lost, but were okay for another night. Rangers gave them instructions on how to descend the snowfield and return to Paradise. The pair camped at the 9,000-foot level on Mount Rainier that night, then called the park the following morning. The battery in their phone died in mid-conversation, however, so rangers were uncertain on their condition or situation. The weather on Monday was severe, with strong winds, blowing snow and very limited visibility, thereby precluding any possibility of a search. On Tuesday, a ground team headed toward Camp Muir. A break in the weather later permitted a helicopter search of the upper snowfield, but the effort proved fruitless. The helicopter then descended below the cloud level and found footprints in a remote drainage far east of the Muir snowfield. The helicopter crew eventually found D.J. and K.H. at the mountain's 6,000-foot level. They were hypothermic, exhausted and on their second day without food or water. They had abandoned all their gear at the 9,000-foot level and had spent Monday night huddling in a snow cave that they'd dug with their hands. The helicopter flew them to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment. [Rick Kirschner, MORA]\n\nMonday, February 12, 1996\n\n96-53 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Flooding\n\nRelatively high temperatures and heavy rains - over 11 inches in four days - combined to cause flooding in and around the park on February 7th and 8th. Damage within the park was limited to basement flooding and some water over roads in the Longmire area. Most roads leading to the park were flooded and closed for periods of time, and the south approach to the Kernahan bridge over the Nisqually River was washed out. The bridge is located about two miles west of the park and provides the only access to a community of about 75 families and to numerous vacation cabins (currently vacant). At the county's request, the park combined resources with the local fire department to provide emergency access to the area. The park plowed open the service road behind Longmire which provides access to the isolated area. Fire department personnel are directing emergency traffic through this unimproved section of road for three hours in the morning and three hours in the evening. The park will attempt to maintain the road in conjunction with other priorities. Flood damage is so extensive in counties surrounding the park that it may be some time before the bridge approach is repaired. [Bill Larson, MORA]\n\nThursday, February 29, 1996 - Leap Day\n\n96-84 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Storm Damage\n\nA wind storm with sustained winds of 40 to 45 mph and gusts in excess of 60 mph struck the area from Nisqually to Longmire yesterday. Wind gusts reached 90 mph at Crystal Mountain in the northeast area of the park. The storm was still in progress at the time of the report, and forecasters were calling for a continuation of very windy conditions through today. Many trees in the Longmire area were blown over, and some struck structures, including the admin and Triplex buildings. At least one residential unit was hit; the extent of damage is unknown. The road from the Nisqually entrance to Longmire was closed to the public for the day. Only required employee travel was being permitted. Power lines are down at several locations. [Lance Gillespie, MORA]\n\nTuesday, April 9, 1996\n\n96-134 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Search and Rescue\n\nOn the morning of Saturday, April 6th, J.B., 17, and three companions began descending Mount Rainier after spending at night at the climbing camp at Camp Muir at 10,000 feet. The members of the party separated while in the Muir Snowfield around the 8,700-foot level so they could each descend at their own pace - one by skiing, two by walking, and J.B. by snowboarding. J.B. was last seen heading east toward Paradise Glacier. The weather at the time was poor and visibility was extremely limited. J.B. was reported missing after he failed to return to Paradise. On Saturday afternoon and evening, two teams searched for him, one along his probable route and the other in the area downhill from his last know location. Neither team was successful. Six teams comprised of rangers, mountaineering guides and mountain rescue volunteers resumed the search on Sunday morning. Clear weather also permitted an early morning search by helicopter. At 9 a.m., one of the ground teams spotted J.B. walking up the Stevens Canyon Road east of Lake Louise and directed the helicopter to the location. J.B. was flown to the park helibase at Kautz Creek, where he was determined to be in good health. [Bill Larson, MORA]\n\nFriday, April 12, 1996\n\n95-775/96-84 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Follow-up on Storm Damage\n\nSeveral areas of the park have been closed temporarily to vehicle access due the continuing impacts of the heavy rains and widespread flooding that struck the area in February and last November:\n\no Carbon River/Ipsut Creek Campground Area - A large section (about 1,350 feet) of the road leading from the park's Carbon River (northwest) entrance to the Ipsut Creek campground area was washed out when dikes failed to hold back the Carbon River. The roadbed in the vicinity of Falls Creek washed away to an average depth of ten feet, effectively cutting off all vehicular access to the campground. The road will probably be closed to traffic throughout the 1996 visitor season.\n\no Paul Peak/Mowich Lake Area - Vehicle access to the Paul Peak/Mowich Lake area has been closed due to extensive slide damage to State Route 165 about a mile west of the park boundary. The road will probably remain closed until early July. One lane traffic will be maintained through five other slide areas on SR 165, except when periodic road closures are required due to road work. During these closures, traffic will be allowed through at the beginning of each hour. Construction will occur on weekdays.\n\no State Route 123 - A 600-foot section of the road about five miles south of Cayuse Pass was damaged by extensive slides. Half of the roadway slid about 600 feet down into the Chinook Creek drainage. Cayuse Pass (elevation 4,675 feet) is usually cleared of snow and opened to traffic by mid-April. There's no estimate of when it will be opened to traffic this year.\n\nTravelers are asked to call the park at 360-569-2211 for updated information on roads. [Eric Walkinshaw, MORA]\n\nThursday, June 27, 1996\n\n96-319 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Rescue\n\nAn air and ground search for two missing climbers - M.S. and M.K., both of Weston, Connecticut - was begun on June 20th. The two men had registered for a three-day climb of Liberty Ridge with a descent down Emmons Glacier. The search was conducted with the assistance of the U.S. Army and county sheriff's office. Despite the coordinated effort, no sign of the climbers was found during the initial search of ascent and descent routes. It was later learned that M.S. and M.K. had wandered into the Summerland area of the park's wilderness, well away from their climbing routes and the initial search area. They had lost their way on the glacier descent route in poor weather, had fallen an estimated 1500 linear feet, and had lost or abandoned most of their equipment. A hiker subsequently encountered the two men, provided them with food and water, and helped them reach the trailhead, where they were cared for by rangers and taken to a hospital. They were treated there for frostbite, snowblindness, exhaustion, and dehydration, then released. [John Wilcox, MORA]\n\nThursday, July 25, 1996\n\n96-409 - Mount Rainier (Washington) - Two MVAs with Serious Injuries\n\nA vehicle with four male part visitors ran off the road four miles above Longmire and struck a large tree head on at 1:30 p.m. on July 20th. None of the occupants appears to have been wearing a seatbelt. All were seriously injured and had to be extricated from the car. Medical problems were compounded by the fact that none of the occupants spoke very good English, making assessment of injuries difficult. One of the victims did indicate that he had tuberculosis. Three of the men were flown to a hospital in Seattle; the fourth was taken to Puyallup. While rangers were still involved in evacuating patients from this accident, a second accident occurred about three miles below Paradise. The driver and sole occupant of a car suffered spinal, head and neck injuries when his car went off the road and rolled over. His injuries made the extrication difficult. He was also flown to an area hospital. [Rick Kirschner, MORA]\n\nWednesday, October 23, 1996\n\n96-616 - Mount Rainier NP (Washington) - MVA; Attempted Suicide\n\nThe park received a report of a single-vehicle motor vehicle accident in the vicinity of Chinook Pass around 3 a.m. on October 8th. Responding rangers discovered a white 1975 Toyota pickup lodged on an embankment on the north side of Highway 410 and provided medical assistance to the 21-year-old male driver, who was found lying in the middle of the road. The victim told rangers that Satan had instructed him to drive off the road to kill himself; he rejected further medical treatment and threatened to kill anyone who interfered with his death wish. The rangers took him into protective custody and transported him to the nearest emergency room for treatment and evaluation by a mental health professional. [Uwe Nehring, MORA]\n\nFriday, January 3, 1997\n\n96-707 - Western Areas - Follow-up on Storm Impacts\n\nSeveral additional reports have been received regarding the impacts of the series of storms that have been striking the West Coast. Forecasters are predicting more rain in coming days, and U.S. Geological Service's Tacoma office reports that \"there is potential for serious and widespread flooding in the next several days over all of western Washington.\" This is at least partly because of the potential runoff from melting snow. USGS hydrographers estimate that the water equivalent in the snowpack between 3,000 and 6,000 feet in Washington ranges from about 15 to more than 40 inches.\n\no Mount Rainier NP (Washington) - As of the end of December, a total of 449.5 inches of snow had fallen at Paradise - 244 inches above the average cumulative snowfall by the end of December and 29.5 inches above the amount of snow that had fallen by that time in the world record year of 1971-1972. Of that amount, 158 inches (13 feet, two inches) is still on the ground at Paradise. Although the unusually high snow levels have required some avalanche control work by the Crystal Mountain Ski Resort patrol and have led to reduced visitation, the storms have not had any serious impacts on the park.\n\n[USGS Headquarters, Washington; Colin Campbell, CR, GRTE; Bob Andrew, CR, YOSE; Superintendent, WHIS; CRO, WHIS; Paul Ducasse, SA, PGBSSO; John Dell'Osso, Acting CI, PORE; Jim Hammett, Superintendent, JODA; Randy Brooks, Acting CR, MORA]\n\nTuesday, May 13, 1997\n\n97-191 - Mount Rainier NP (Washington) - Body Found\n\nPark volunteers setting up a compass course for seasonal ranger training on May 10th discovered what are believed to be the remains of S.K., a concession employee who disappeared from her quarters at Longmire last October. An extensive search last fall failed to reveal any clues of her whereabouts, and the subsequent investigation was equally fruitless. The park has received excellent support from an FBI evidence recovery team and from a local search dog team that was also in the area at the time, conducting follow-up searches as a training exercise. Positive identification from dental records is pending. The cause of death has not been determined and all possibilities remain open. Evidence collected will be analyzed by the FBI laboratory.

A search for him was begun on the evening of the 24th and continued on the 25th. Ground teams and air crews searched the Spray Park and Seattle Park areas. The lost hiker was eventually located by helicopter and transported to facilities for medical evaluation. [Uwe Nehring, MORA, 9/26]\n\nMonday, November 17, 1997\n\n97-704 - Mount Rainier NP (WA) - Search in Progress\n\nA major search is underway for C.H., 27, who has been missing in the park since Wednesday, November 12th. He was reported missing when he failed to show up for work that day. His vehicle was later found at the Deer Creek trailhead on the east side of the park. The search was begun early on Thursday morning. By Friday, representatives from almost a dozen state, county, private and volunteer organizations had joined park staff in the search area, which includes dense forest and rugged mountainous terrain at elevations ranging from 3,200 to 7,500 feet. Searchers had little to go on beyond the location of his vehicle at the trailhead and no clues were found. By Sunday, over 100 people, including family, friends and co-workers, were actively looking for C.H.. Efforts were intensified due to a weather forecast that called for rain and snow in the search area by yesterday afternoon. Although C.H. is in good physical condition, it's believed that he is wearing only light clothing and that he is equipped for only a day hike, with no survival gear. Searchers are being hampered by freeze-thaw cycles at upper elevations which have resulted in very hard snow surfaces that leave no trace of footprints. Cold temperatures and low humidities have also made it difficult for search dogs to track. Randy Brooks is incident commander. [Communications Center, MORA, 11/14-11/16]\n\nTuesday, November 18, 1997\n\n97-704 - Mount Rainier NP (WA) - Follow-up on Search\n\nThe search for 27-year-old C.H., missing in the park since last Wednesday, was suspended late on Sunday due to deteriorating weather conditions. Although formal search efforts will be scaled back, the case remains open and park staff will continue to look for clues during routine patrols and park air operations. C.H. was hiking alone and left no itinerary. He has now been out over five nights, with temperatures during that period dropping well below freezing. Snow fell to the 3,000 foot elevation on Sunday afternoon. Indications are that he was lightly clothed and equipped only for a day hike when he headed out; he had no survival gear with him. Over the four days of the search, up to 105 searchers from a dozen organizations searched and researched areas with the greatest potential for finding him, employing a variety of overlapping search strategies and tactics. The overall search area is about 64,000 acres in size and extends from 3,200 feet to 7,500 feet. It includes dense forest, numerous drainages, waterfalls, and rugged mountainous terrain. Of the total of 4,000 search hours logged to date, almost 2,900 hours were recorded by volunteer search and rescue organizations, family, and friends.

J.F., a Seattle resident, had headed out on a ski touring trip in the Highway 140 corridor with the intention of skiing to Crystal Lakes Basin, traversing Crystal Ridge, and meeting his wife and friends at the Crystal Mountain ski area. When he failed to appear, a search was begun by rangers and representatives from the Pierce and Yakima County sheriff's departments, Tacoma Mountain Rescue, Crystal Mountain Ski Patrol, and Mount Rainier Nordic Patrol. The temperature hovered around zero, moderate snow fell, and winds were from 15 to 25 mph; avalanche danger in the area was moderate. J.F. showed up with members of another touring party at Bear Gap Pass the next day. He had gotten off his route due to valley fog and crossed the Cascade Crest into the Morse Creek drainage on the Wenatchee National Forest. He met the ski touring group at a cabin in the Morse Creek area and overnighted with them. J.F. was reunited with his family at Bear Gap Pass. [Uwe Nehring, MORA, 1/12]\n\nTuesday, March 17, 1998\n\n98-101 - Mount Rainier NP (WA) - Concession Employee Homicide\n\nThe park and the FBI announced yesterday that laboratory analysis of evidence associated with the 1996 death of S.K., a park concession employee, indicates that she was the victim of a homicide. S.K., who worked for Mount Rainier Guest Services Incorporated (GSI), disappeared from her quarters at Longmire in early October of that year. An extensive search was conducted but failed to locate either S.K. or any clues as to her whereabouts. Last May, S.K.'s remains were found about a half mile from her quarters. Follow-up searches by rangers, a team of FBI agents, search dogs and Explorer search and rescue scouts led to the recovery of a number of items of evidence. Analysis of those items indicates that S.K. was killed. A joint homicide investigation by rangers and FBI agents is underway. A $20,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of any person involved in S.K.'s death. Contact numbers for those with such information are 360-569-2211 extension 2348 or 2330 (park) or 206-622-0460 (FBI). [CRO, MORA, 3/16]\n\nTuesday, June 16, 1998\n\n98-288 - Mount Rainier NP (WA) - Rescues; Avalanche Fatality\n\nRangers found and rescued G.M., 33, and M.B., 34, from Mount Rainier on June 15th after the two men called for help on their cellular phone. One was hypothermic, the other was reported to be \"cold but mobile.\" It was the second time in less than a week that rangers had to save climbers. A man was killed and seven other climbers were injured in an avalanche last Thursday. Details are not yet available. [The Pocono Record, 6/16]\n\nWednesday, June 17, 1998\n\n98-288 - Mount Rainier NP (WA) - Follow-up on Rescue\n\nOn the evening of June 14th, the park communication center received a 911 relay of a cellular phone call from two climbers in distress at the 13,400-foot elevation of Mount Rainier. The call was forwarded to the park by the Washington State Patrol office in Wenatchee. The climbers had reached the summit via the Liberty Ridge route earlier that day. While attempting to descend via Emmons Glacier, one of the two men fell into a crevasse. He was held by his partner and was able to climb out of the crevasse after two hours' effort, but both were suffering from hypothermia by that time. They bivouacked in an effort to warm up, and made the distress call when one of them continued to lose body heat. Rangers organized a response that evening. A cold front was expected to move through during the night, lowering freezing levels and bringing snow, freezing rain, and high winds. Rescuers were dispatched from Camp Schurman at 4:45 a.m. the next morning. Visibility at the camp was limited to 200 feet and winds blew between 35 and 40 knots. Climbing teams from Tacoma, Seattle and Olympic Mountain Rescue also responded to the call, and a Bell Jet Ranger and an Army Chinook CH-47 were summoned to search for the pair and insert rescue teams. Efforts to do so, however, proved impossible because of strong winds. The ground team continued to climb to the site despite winds of up to 50 mph and below freezing temperatures, and reached the two climbers around 2:30 p.m. Both were in good condition but suffering from exposure. They were given water and food and rewarmed before descending to Camp Schurman. They overnighted their before continuing their descent the following day. [Uwe Nehring, MORA, 6/16]\n\nThursday, June 18, 1998\n\n98-299 - Mount Rainier NP (WA) - Avalanche with Fatality\n\nA cellular phone call from the 11,600-foot level of the mountain early on the morning of Thursday, June 11th, alerted rangers to an avalanche that had swept two rope teams off the nose of Disappointment Cleaver. Off-duty lead climbing ranger Mike Gauthier reached the party in 26 minutes by snowboarding from Mount Rainier's 14,410-foot summit and assumed on-scene leadership. While several medical, military, and contract helicopters attempted to transport rescuers to the scene, climbing rangers Stefan Lofgren and George Beilstein climbed to the site. They arrived at Ingraham Flats above Camp Muir (11,000 feet) at the same time as climbing ranger Joe Puryear and volunteer Dee Patterson arrived from Camp Schurman via helicopter. Ten people on two Rainier Mountaineering guided rope teams had been swept off the route. All but one of the fixed line anchors had ripped out, and the line's outer sheath had been badly frayed by rocks. The remaining inner strands held the climbers, who were strewn over the ice and rock cliffs with a variety of injuries. Four climbers hung from a rope which was coiled around the left arm of one guide, whose arm was trapped and twisted behind him; another guide was strapped to an unstable rock by a rope with two people hanging beneath. Several climbers hung suspended in waterfalls issuing from the melting ice and snow above them. Rangers replaced the frayed ropes and gradually raised the injured parties up and over the lip from which they hung. Several were treated for various injuries and moderate to severe hypothermia. P.N., 29, had died from exposure by the time rescuers were able to reach him. His body was lowered off the cliff. All parties were carried to Ingraham Flats. An Army Chinook helicopter was able to land just as darkness fell and evacuated the injured. Media interest was intense throughout the incident; more national and regional news crews were on scene than any at the park could recall at previous incidents. Interest remained high throughout the next day, when the non-injured parties walked off the Mountain from Camp Muir. The Today Show, Hard Copy, Dateline, Newsweek, and many other national media outlets carried the story. Ranger John Krambrink was IC.
