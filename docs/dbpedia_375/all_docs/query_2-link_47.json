        "text": "Post by cwemyss on\n\nOctober 27, 1899 – Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island\n\nLieutenant Douglas Snyder took note of the stony silence and the uncomfortable rustling from the audience in the semi-dark room. The temperature, this morning unseasonably pleasant for Newport in late autumn, was starting to feel a bit oppressive. Snyder gathered himself and continued with his conclusion.\n\n“In summary, the current Navy cruiser force can best be described as a hodgepodge. In twelve rounds of wargames against a variety of opponents, few of our ships excelled at scouting, few of them were particularly effective at countering torpedo boats, and few of them possessed the power to deter enemy scouts. The Olympia, though admittedly as close to an ideal as we possess, is saddled with slow-firing 8-inch main guns and would be expensive to duplicate.”\n\nMore rustling from the audience and several distinct frowns in the front row. Daring to speak ill of Dewey’s flagship risked losing the audience, Snyder knew. He caught Lieutenant Commander William Little’s eye and received a subtle nod of encouragement.\n\n“In those same tabletop battles, the proposed Global Cruiser was more than adequate. With eight each six-inch-forty and four-inch-forty guns, enough armor to defeat all four and five inch fire, and twenty-two knot speed, it is fast enough, powerful enough, and well-enough protected to serve in all these scenarios and more. It’s company of Marines give it the flexibility for duty anywhere in our expanded republic, and on a 5700-ton hull it is inexpensive enough to afford in numbers.”\n\nHe looked around the room again and thanked the audience for their time. There was a smattering of polite applause before the assembled officers began collecting their possessions. This was not the rousing reception Snyder had wished for in his Naval War College capstone presentation. Snyder had been selected for a War College appointment before the war with Spain, one of the first Engineers selected for the advanced coursework only recently opened to officers in the technical bureaus. He had hoped to move from these studies to a sea appointment as a line officer but it had been a rocky eighteen months, frequently locking horns with his more traditional seagoing classmates and, more unfortunately, his instructors.\n\nSnyder stifled a sigh and began returning his notes to his briefcase, pausing occasionally to shake a polite hand. He looked up to see Lt Commander Little descending from the back of the room with a Captain in tow.\n\n“Douglas,” Little began, “I’d like you to meet Captain Robert Marler, of the Bureau of Construction.”\n\n“Pleased to meet you sir,” Snyder responded, taking the older officer’s hand. “I trust the presentation was of interest.”\n\n“Tremendous interest, in fact. Commander Little wrote me several weeks ago to tell me what you were working on. We’ve reached many of the same conclusions at Bureau. But as you can see, no one in the fleet is clamoring to be a part of it.”\n\n“Yes, sir,” Snyder agreed, hesitant to say more to an officer he didn’t know.\n\n“Frankly,” Marler continued, “Our fleet still doesn’t trust the tabletop exercises, and most of them want more of the armored cruisers and battleships that look so impressive in a neat line. But we’ve been given a whole world to cover, and Congress hasn’t given us enough budget to blanket that world with those. The fleet will have to accept something different.”\n\nSnyder silently breathed a sigh of relief. He had grown tired of having the same arguments and was very glad this wouldn’t be another round. “My rough calculations show that the Global Cruiser would cost about half of the Maine class, sir. They can’t stand against the heavy ships but can hold their own in most situations. And 12-inch guns aren’t necessary for patrolling off Santiago or shelling rebels in the Philippines.”\n\nMarler looked thoughtful for a moment. “Lieutenant, what is your next assignment?”\n\n“I don’t have one right now.” Snyder responded, his guard back up. This had been a major point of frustration, and his term at the NWC ended in a month. “I expect I’ll be returning to the Bureau of Engineering. Why do you ask, sir?”\n\n“Well,” Marler answered. “I have a proposal for you. Come to the Bureau of Construction and oversee the new St Louis class. You’ll find it roughly matches what you’ve proposed, and your knowledge of steam plants will pay dividends. There have been a number of delays and I need someone to keep things moving forward.”\n\nSnyder was taken aback but intrigued. “Sir, I appreciate it, and I’m very interested. But if I’m totally honest I was hoping for a line assignment.”\n\nLt Commander Little smiled slightly, and Marler chuckled before continuing. “Commander Little told me you might say that. I think I have a solution. The St Louis will need an engineering officer when she commissions next year. She’s destined for the Caribbean Squadron and I can promise you a spot onboard.”\n\nSnyder extended his hand again. “Sir, I’ll be happy to join you.”"
