        "text": "One day to go...\n\nOne: Olympic hero. Great and many have been the deeds by thousands of Olympians since the inaugural modern Games in Athens in 1896. But the achievements of Jesse Owens, the black American track and field athlete who won four gold medals under the nose of Hitler at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, surely stand out above all others.\n\nBy employing the Third Reich’s highly efficient propaganda machine, Hitler wanted to use the Olympics to promote Germany to the world at large. The German team, with full government backing, was the best prepared in the history of the Olympics.\n\nBut it was Owens - one of 10 black athletes on the US track and field team - who proved to be the indubitable star of the Games. Detested by the German propaganda machine, which dubbed them the Black Auxiliaries, Owens and his nine black colleagues on the American athletics team won seven gold, three silver and three bronze medals between them - more than any other national team. Owens himself won the 100m, 200m and long-jump titles as well as being a member of the successful 4 x 100m relay team.\n\nTwo days to go...\n\nTwo: The number of times that London has hosted the summer Olympics, as many times as any other city. Only Athens (1896 and 2004), Paris (1900 and 1924), London (1908 and 1948) and Los Angeles (1932 and 1984) have twice acted as the host city, though London will break that record in 2012 when it becomes the first city to stage the summer Games on three separate occasions.\n\nStrangely, London had never bid successfully for the Olympics until winning the 2012 Games. The 1908 Olympics were due to be held in Rome until London stepped in at short notice following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906. A year after the conclusion of the Second World War, a postal vote of IOC members awarded the 1948 Games to London (which had, in any event, originally been earmarked for the 1944 Olympics). The summer Olympics have been held in the United States on four occasions (in 1904, 1932, 1984 and 1996), more times than any other country.\n\nThree days to go...\n\nThree: The number of times that Great Britain has won only one gold medal at a summer Olympic Games, though she has thankfully yet to record a duck. Britain managed a solitary gold in 1904 (when Thomas Kiely won the combined events, a forerunner of the decathlon), in 1952 (when the show-jumping team were victorious) and again in 1996 (when Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent were successful in the rowing coxless pairs).\n\nBritain’s best gold-medal haul by far is the 56 that were harvested at the London Games of 1908, when they finished on top of the medal table for the only time ever. The next highest British gold-medal tallies, in descending order, are 17 (in 1900), 14 (in 1920), 11 (in 2000), 10 (in 1912) and nine (in 1924 and 2004). Britain have won between two and six gold medals at every other summer Olympics.\n\nFour days to go...\n\nFour: The number of gold medals won by Francina “Fanny” Blankers-Koen, a 30-year-old from the Netherlands and a mother of two children, at the 1948 London Olympics.\n\nBlankers-Coen's gold-medal haul was greater than that of the entire British team between them. Her four gold medals, in the 100m, 200m (which she won by 0.7sec, the widest margin in an Olympic 200m final), 80m hurdles and 4 x 100m relay, earned her the nickname “The Flying Housewife”. And with good reason, for she had become the first woman to win four Olympic gold medals and the first one to do so at a single Olympics.\n\nShe remains one of only four people, along with Alvin Kraenzlein (1900), Jesse Owens (1936) and Carl Lewis (1984), to have won four track and field gold medals at one Olympics. Blankers-Coen died in 2004 at the age of 85, but her achievements of 1948 will live forever.\n\nFive days to go...\n\nFive: The number of Olympic gold medals won by Sir Steve Redgrave, the rower widely regarded to be Great Britain‘s greatest ever Olympian. Redgrave won his gold medals at five successive Games between 1984 and 2000 and became only the fourth athlete in any sport to claim gold medals at five different Olympics.\n\nHaving won the coxed fours in 1984 with Martin Cross, Andy Holmes, Richard Budgett and Adrian Ellison, Redgrave won the coxless pairs at the next three Olympics - with Holmes in 1988 and with Matthew Pinsent in both 1992 and 1996. Immediately after winning gold in 1996, Redgrave famously said: “If anyone ever sees me in a boat again, they have my permission to shoot me.”\n\nBut he was in a boat again in Sydney four years later when, amid almost unbearable tension, the British coxless fours, which comprised Redgrave, Pinsent, James Cracknell and Tim Foster, just held off the challenge of the Italians. Redgrave was knighted in 2001 and rarely can a knighthood have been so richly deserved.\n\nSix days to go...\n\nSix: The number of gold medals that Kristin Otto, an East German swimmer, won at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the most that a female Olympian has won at a single Games. The powerful Otto, who was born in Leipzig in 1966, was favoured to win several gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Games before becoming a victim of a boycott that involved most of the Eastern Bloc countries.\n\nAt the 1988 Olympics - the only Games in which she competed - she demonstrated remarkable versatility by winning the 50m and 100m freestyle, the 100m butterfly, the 100m backstroke, the 4 x 100m freestyle relay and the 4 x 100m medley relay. The achievements of Otto, who subsequently worked as a commentator on German television, are inevitably tainted by the revelations of widespread performance-enhancing drugs use by East German athletes, but her haul of six gold medals nevertheless remains a record.\n\nSeven days to go...\n\nSeven: The number of gold medals that Mark Spitz, the American swimmer, won at the 1972 Munich Olympics, three of them in relays and all of them in new world-record times. It is a gold-medal haul that remains the highest by any person at a single Olympics.\n\nSpitz, who was born in California in 1950, brashly predicted that he would win six gold medals at the 1968 Mexico Games, but performed relatively disappointingly, winning two relay golds, a 100m butterfly silver and a 100m freestyle bronze. 1972 proved to be altogether different as he swam to glory in every event in which he participated: the 100m and 200m freestyle, the 100m and 200m butterfly, the 4 x 100m and 4 x 200m freestyle relays and the 4 x 100m medley relay.\n\nStill only 22, Spitz retired after Munich. He made a return to competitive swimming in 1991 with the stated aim of qualifying for the 1992 Olympics, but was unable to match swimmers who were half his age.\n\nEight days to go...\n\nEight: The most medals that have been won by one person at a single Olympics, a record that is shared by Alexander Dityatin, a Soviet gymnast, and Michael Phelps, the American swimmer. Dityatin achieved the feat at the Moscow Games of 1980, when he won three gold medals (in the all-around, rings and team events), four silvers and a bronze. He thereby also holds the distinction of being the only athlete to have claimed a medal in each of the eight gymnastics disciplines at one Olympics.\n\nPhelps matched Dityatin’s record by winning six golds (in the 100m and 200m butterfly, the 200m and 400m individual medley, the 4 x 200m freestyle relay and the 4 x 100m medley relay) and two bronzes in Athens four years ago. The women’s record for winning multiple medals at one Olympics is held by Maria Gorokhovskaya, a Soviet gymnast, who won seven (two golds and five silvers) at the 1952 Games.\n\nNine days to go . . .\n\nNine: The record-equalling number of Olympic gold medals that were won by Carl Lewis, the American track and field athlete.\n\nLewis won four gold medals in 1984 (the 100m, 200m, 4 x 100m relay and long jump, thereby replicating the feat of Jesse Owens in 1936), two in 1988 (the 100m and long jump), two in 1992 (the 4 x 100m relay and long jump) and one in 1996 (the long jump). He finished second in the 1988 100m final, but was subsequently promoted to first when Ben Johnson was infamously disqualified after failing a dope test.\n\nIt was revealed in 2003 that Lewis himself had tested positive for banned stimulants three times before the 1988 Games, but he nevertheless remains the only male athlete to have retained either the Olympic 100m title or the Olympic long jump title. Lewis’s gold-medal haul ties him with Paavo Nurmi, Larissa Latynina and Mark Spitz as the only Olympians to have won nine gold medals.\n\n10 days to go . . .\n\n10: The number of Olympic hockey medals that have been won by Great Britain, a total below only that of the Netherlands, who have claimed 13 medals, and India (11). Nine of Britain’s medals (three gold, two silver and four bronze) have been won in men’s hockey, which made its debut at the 1908 London Games, and one (a bronze) in women’s, which was added to the Olympic programme in 1980.\n\nBritain won the men’s title in 1908, 1920 and 1988, though India have much the much successful record in that discipline, having won the title on eight occasions, including all six times between 1928 and 1956. During that astonishing run of six successive gold medals, India scored 178 goals and conceded only seven. The highest score ever achieved in international hockey came when India beat the United States 24-1 in the 1932 Olympics. The highest score in an Olympic final also came in 1932, when India beat Japan 11-1.\n\n11 days to go . . .\n\n11: The number of Israelis who so tragically lost their lives at the 1972 Games in Munich, after eight Palestinian terrorists burst into the premises of the Israeli team, who were based in the Olympic Village, on the morning of Sept 5.\n\nA weightlifter and a wrestling coach were killed immediately in a fusillade of gunfire before nine Israelis were held hostage.\n\nFollowing lengthy negotiations, the terrorists and their hostages were allowed to go to a local airport, where an abortive rescue attempt resulted in the murder of all the hostages and five of the terrorists.\n\n“The Games must go on,” said Avery Brundage, the IOC president. And go on they did, after being temporarily suspended for a memorial service. The rest of the Israeli team went home immediately, as did some individuals from other nations who were concerned about the security measures.\n\n12 days to go . . .\n\n12: The number of Olympic medals that were won by Paavo Nurmi, the great Finnish middle and long distance runner of the 1920s.\n\nNo other athletics competitor has harvested as many Olympic medals as the ‘Flying Finn‘, who won nine golds and three silvers - in track and cross-country events - between 1920 and 1928. In distances ranging from 1,500m to 10,000m, he claimed three gold medals in 1920, five in 1924 and one in 1928 while additionally gaining one silver in 1920 and two more silvers in 1928.\n\nNurmi was barred from participating at the 1932 Games, where he intended to compete in the 10,000m and the marathon, because he was deemed to be a professional, but he lit the Olympic Flame at the Helsinki Games of 1952. A national hero, Nurmi was given a state funeral when he died at the age of 76 in 1973.\n\n13 days to go . . .\n\n13: The number of Olympic swimming gold medals that have been won by Great Britain, nine of them in men’s swimming (which formed part of the inaugural Olympic programme in 1896) and four in women’s (which was first introduced in 1912).\n\nAfter John Jarvis claimed the 1,000m and 4,000m freestyle titles in 1900, Britain won four swimming gold medals at the London Games of 1908 before the women’s 4x100m freestyle relay team won gold in 1912.\n\nThree more women’s gold medals followed - Lucy Morton in the 200m breaststroke in 1924, Judy Grinham in the 100m backstroke in 1956 and Anita Lonsbrough in the 200m breaststroke in 1960 - before David Wilkie won Britain‘s first men‘s swimming gold for 68 years when he triumphed in the 200m breaststroke in 1976. The last two British swimming gold medals have both come in the men’s 100m breaststroke: Duncan Goodhew in 1980 and Adrian Moorhouse in 1988.\n\n14 days to go . . .\n\n14: The age at which Nadia Comeneci, a Romanian gymnast, not only captured five medals (three gold, one silver and one bronze) at the 1976 Montreal Games, but also became the first person ever to be awarded a perfect score of 10 in an Olympic gymnastics event.\n\nTrained as a gymnast since the age of six, the 4ft 11in Comaneci made Olympic history by being awarded a magical 10 for her performances on the uneven bars and on the balance beam in the team competition (in which Romania won silver). She also gained another five “perfect 10s” at the 1976 Games en route to winning individual gold medals in the all-around, uneven bars and balance beam events before winning four further medals (two gold and two silver) at the Moscow Olympics four years later. Comaneci retired from competition in 1981 and is now a naturalized citizen of the USA.\n\n15 days to go . . .\n\n15: The number of medals that have been won at the summer Olympics by Soviet gymnast Nikolai Andrianov, more than any other male competitor in the history of the modern Games. An unruly child who often played truant from school, Andrianov competed at three Olympics between 1972 and 1980 and won seven gold medals (one in 1972, four in 1976, two in 1980), five silver and three bronze.\n\nSix of his gold medals were in individual events and he also won a team gold in 1980. The next highest tally of Olympic medals that have been won by male competitors is 13, a feat that has been achieved by three different people: Edoardo Mangiarotti, an Italian fencer (between 1936 and 1960), Takashi Ono, a Japanese gymnast (between 1952 and 1964) and Boris Shakhlin, a Soviet gymnast (between 1956 and 1964).\n\n16 days to go . . .\n\n16: The number of countries that have won only one medal in track and field events in the history of the modern Olympics. Burundi, Cameroon, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Luxembourg and Syria have each claimed a sole gold medal while Haiti, Ivory Coast, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Zambia have all secured one silver.\n\nThe nations to have won a bronze - and nothing else - in Olympic track and field competitions are Colombia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Qatar and Venezuela. At the other end of the scale, USA lead the way with 717 athletics medals (307 gold, 228 silver, 182 bronze) and they are followed by the Soviet Union, who have harvested a total of 214 medals, Great Britain (186), Finland (112) and East Germany (110 - though many of those were almost certainly won with the aid of performance enhancing drugs). Of Finland’s 112 athletics medals, only three have been won by women.\n\n17 days to go . . .\n\n17: The age at which Bob Mathias became the decathlon champion at the 1948 London Games, thereby making him the youngest ever male gold medallist in an Olympic athletics event.\n\nMathias, an American, was 17 years and 263 days old when he triumphed, which was some achievement given that he had only taken up the event, at the behest of his high school coach, three months previously. Indeed, so unfamiliar was he with the decathlon, he exited the shot put throwing circle from the front and therefore fouled what would have been his longest throw. Asked immediately after winning gold how he intended to celebrate, the teenager replied: “I’ll start shaving, I guess.“\n\nMathias retained his title in Helsinki four years later by a huge margin, setting a world record in the process, before later acting in four films (one of them with Jayne Mansfield) and being elected to the US Congress, where he served for eight years. He died in 2006 at the age of 75.\n\n18 days to go . . .\n\n18: The record number of Olympic medals that were won by Soviet gymnast Larissa Latynina. Born in Ukraine in 1934, she competed at three Games between 1956 and 1964 and won six medals at each of them. Her overall total, which includes 14 medals in individual events and four in team disciplines, comprises nine gold medals, five silvers and four bronzes.\n\nShe remains only one of four athletes to have won nine Olympic gold medals as well as being the only one (of either sex) to have gained 14 in individual events. She is also one of only three women to have been victorious in the same individual summer Olympics event (in her case, the floor exercises) on three separate occasions. Nikolai Andrianov, another Soviet gymnast, is second on the all-time medal list, having won 15 between 1972 and 1980.\n\n19 days to go . . .\n\n19: The age of Yoshinori Sakai, a Japanese student, when he lit the Olympic Flame at the Tokyo Games of 1964.\n\nSakai, however, was not just any 19-year-old, for he had been born near Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 - the very day the atomic bomb was dropped on the Japanese city.\n\nAnd it was as a symbol of peace and reconciliation with the world community after the events of the Second World War that “Baby Hiroshima”, as he was nicknamed, was chosen to ignite the flame.\n\nThe 1964 Olympics were the first to be held in Asia as well as being the first to include judo and volleyball. Electronic quartz timing was introduced along with photo finish equipment while fibreglass poles were used in the pole vault for the first time.\n\nAll four of Great Britain’s gold medals were won in athletics events: Lynn Davies and Mary Rand in their respective long jump competitions, Ann Packer in the 800m and Ken Matthews in the 20km walk.\n\n20 days to go . . .\n\n20: The number of countries who have only ever won an overall total of one medal at the summer Olympics.\n\nOf those, three have won a gold medal, eight a silver and nine a bronze.\n\nThe three to have claimed a gold as the only Olympic medal in their history are Burundi, Ecuador and United Arab Emirates while the eight to have secured a silver are Ivory Coast, Netherlands Antilles, Paraguay, Senegal, Singapore, Tonga, Vietnam and Virgin Islands.\n\nThe nine to have won a bronze are Bermuda, Djibouti, Eritrea, Guyana, Iraq, Kirghizstan, Kuwait, Macedonia and Niger Republic.\n\nAt the top end of the scale, USA lead the way with a total of 2,200 medals, and they are followed by the Soviet Union, who have gained 1,122 (a figure that includes the Unified Team of 1992), Great Britain (671), unified Germany (608) and France (590).\n\n21 days to go . . .\n\n21: The number of gold medals that have been won at the summer Olympics by Ukraine, which was one of the founding republics of the Soviet Union and became independent again after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.\n\nBordered by no less than seven countries, including Russia to the east and Poland, Slovakia and Hungary to the west, Ukraine is home to more than 46 million people and has Kiev as its capital city.\n\nHaving competed as part of the Unified Team at the 1992 Games, Ukraine won nine gold medals in 1996, three in 2000 and a further nine in Athens four years ago.\n\nIn addition to their 21 golds at the past three Olympics, they have also claimed a total of 17 silvers and 31 bronzes.\n\nAmong their gold medal winners have been Wladimir Klitschko, who won the super-heavyweight boxing title in 1996, and swimmer Yana Klochkova, who was successful in the 200m and 400m individual medley in both 2000 and 2004.\n\n22 days to go . . .\n\n22: The number of Olympic basketball medals that have been won by the United States, appreciably more than any other nation.\n\nThe Soviet Union, with 13, have the next highest medal tally and they are followed by Yugoslavia (eight), Brazil (five), Australia (three) and Lithuania (three).\n\nSince basketball was first introduced to the Olympic programme in 1936, the American men’s team have won 12 gold medals, one silver and two bronze, with their only failure to win a medal coming in 1980, when USA boycotted the Moscow Games.\n\nWomen’s basketball was first included at the Montreal Olympics of 1976, since when USA have won five of the eight tournaments, as well as finishing second and third in the two other Games at which they competed.\n\nGreat Britain have never won a medal in Olympic basketball.\n\n23 days to go . . .\n\n23: The number of gold medals that have been won in men’s Olympic football.\n\nGreat Britain and Hungary, with three each, have won the most gold medals and they are followed by the Soviet Union and Uruguay, who have secured two apiece.\n\nArgentina are among those countries to have claimed the title on one occasion, with their success coming in Athens four years ago when a goal by Carlos Tevez fired them to a 1-0 victory against Paraguay.\n\nIndeed, Argentina went through the whole tournament without conceding a goal.\n\nIn 1984, some professional footballers were officially allowed to take part in the Olympics before, in 1992, all professionals were permitted to participate, provided they were less than 23 years old.\n\nSince 1996, for the Olympic tournament itself, each qualifying country has been allowed to add three professionals to its squad, regardless of their age.\n\n24 days to go . . .\n\n24: The number of countries that participated in the 1900 Olympics in Paris, although many competitors, even event winners, did not actually realize they were taking part in the Games, such was the chaotic nature of the most disorganised Olympics of all.\n\nIn fact, some of them died without ever knowing that they had taken part in the Games, which coincided with Paris’s World Fair. Still, 997 athletes (975 men and 22 women) from 24 nations were deemed to have participated in the Olympics.\n\nTennis was one of fives sports in which athletes from different nations competed on the same side, with the others being football, polo, rowing and tug-of-war.\n\nSeventeen of the 24 countries won a medal of some colour, with France, who won a total of 100 medals, finishing on top of the table.\n\nThe United States claimed 46 medals to finish in second place while Great Britain (38 medals) finished third.\n\n25 days to go . . .\n\n25: The number of medals that have been won by Great Britain in Olympic equestrian events, a total that has been surpassed only by Germany, who have gained 51, the United States (46), Sweden (40) and France (35).\n\nBritain’s haul is made up of six gold medals (two individual and four team), nine silvers and 10 bronzes. The individual golds have both come in the three-day event competition: Richard Meade was triumphant in 1972 before Leslie Law followed suit in 2004, though only after Germany’s Bettina Hoy was relegated from first to ninth place after crossing the start line twice in the show-jumping part of the event.\n\nBritain won the show-jumping team event in 1952 and the three-day event competition in 1956, 1968 and 1972. Britain have also finished second in the three-day event team competition in four of the past six Olympics.\n\n26 days to go . . .\n\n26: The number of Olympic medals (seven gold, 12 silver, seven bronze) that have been won by Kazakhstan, who have participated at the past three Games as an independent nation after competing at the 1992 Olympics as part of the Unified Team.\n\nKazakhstan declared its independence in December 1991 - the last Soviet republic to do so - and is the ninth biggest country in the world with an area of 2.7 million square kilometres, though its population is only a little more than 15 million people. The only woman to win an Olympic medal of any colour for Kazakhstan is Olga Shishigina, who lifted the 100m hurdles title in 2000. Of the other 25 medals, 11 (including four gold) have been won in boxing, six (including one gold) in wrestling, three in shooting, two in weightlifting, one in modern pentathlon (a gold), one in cycling and one in athletics.\n\n27 days to go . . .\n\n27: The number of Olympic hockey gold medals that have been won, 20 in men’s hockey and seven in women’s. Hockey was first introduced to the Olympic movement at the London Games of 1908, when four of the six teams competing represented England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n\nThe first ever Olympic hockey game was won by Scotland, who beat Germany 4-0. Apart from 1912 and 1924, hockey has appeared at every subsequent Games, with a women’s event being added to the programme in 1980. India, who won every Olympic tournament between 1928 and 1956, have won the most gold medals overall (eight, all of them in the men’s competition) and they are followed by Australia (four golds), Great Britain (three), Netherlands (three) and Pakistan (three). Three of Australia’s gold medals and one of the Netherlands’ came in the women’s event.\n\n28 days to go . . .\n\n28: The number of gold medals that Yugoslavia won at the summer Olympics. Having been formed in 1918 by the union of the State of Slovenes, Croats & Serbs and the Kingdom of Serbia, Yugoslavia competed at their first Olympics in Antwerp two years later, though they failed to win a medal of any colour.\n\nThey won two golds at the Paris Games of 1924 to break their duck, but their best gold-medal haul at any Olympics was the seven they secured in Los Angeles in 1984. Following the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991, “new” Yugoslavia was effectively a federation of the two remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro. It officially became Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, whereby the name “Yugoslavia” was officially abolished. Besides 28 Olympic gold medals, Yugoslavia also won 32 silvers and 33 bronzes.\n\n29 days to go . . .\n\n29: The number of countries that were represented at the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, a then record that was surpassed when 44 countries competed in Paris four years later. Among those nations appearing for the first time were Ireland, who were competing separately from Great Britain for the first time, Poland and Romania.\n\nFollowing the events of the Great War, Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Turkey were excluded from the Games by the International Olympic Committee. In total, there were 2,626 athletes, which comprised 2,561 men and 65 women. The opening ceremony was notable for the introduction of the five-ringed Olympic flag and the first Olympic oath. Among those events that appeared for the last time were tug-of-war (which was won by Great Britain), weight-throwing, the 3,000m walk and the 400m breaststroke.\n\n30 days to go . . .\n\n30: The number of Olympic gold medals that have been won by Greece. No less than 10 of those were claimed in 1896, when Athens acted as the host city for the inaugural modern Olympics. Among the Greek winners in 1896 were Spyridon Louis, who was victorious in the marathon, and Ioannis Malokinis, who triumphed in the 100m freestyle swimming event for sailors. Greek athletes also won three of the five shooting competitions and two of the three fencing disciplines.\n\nAfter that, however, Greece won a total of only four gold medals (one each in 1904, 1912, 1960 and 1980) before securing two in 1992: one in the women’s 100m hurdles and one in men’s weightlifting. Since then, Greece have fared even better, harvesting four golds in 1996, another four in 2000 and six in Athens four years ago.\n\n31 days to go . . .\n\n31: Block 31, Connollystrasse was the address of the Israeli team’s headquarters at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Located in the Olympic village, 31 Connollystrasse was a modern, three-storey building in which 28 Israeli athletes, coaches and officials shared five apartments.\n\nAt 4am on 5 September, eight Palestinian terrorists burst into the premises, immediately killing a weightlifter and a wrestling coach in a hail of bullets before holding a further nine athletes hostage.\n\nTen of the Israeli party managed to escape there and then while a further seven were absent at other venues on that fateful night. After lengthy negotiations, the terrorists and the nine hostages were allowed to go to nearby Fürstenfeldbrück Military Airport, where all the hostages and five of the terrorists lost their lives in a wretchedly bungled rescue attempt.\n\n32 days to go . . .\n\n32: The number of Olympic boxing gold medals that have been won by Cuba. It is a total that is second only to USA, who have won 48, and makes up all but half of Cuba's overall tally of 65 Olympic gold medals.\n\nCuba did not win a boxing gold until the 1972 Games, when they secured three, but they have dominated the sport at every Olympics since, with the exceptions of 1984 and 1988, when they did not compete.\n\nThey won a further three golds in 1976, six in 1980, seven in 1992, four in 1996, four in 2000 and five in 2004.\n\nTwo of only three men to have won three Olympic boxing gold medals are Cuban: Teofilo Stevenson won the heavyweight title between 1972 and 1980 before Felix Savon equalled his feat in the same division between 1992 and 2000. Mario Kindelan, another Cuban, has won the past two\n\n33 days to go . . .\n\n33: The number of Olympic gold medals that Germany won at the Berlin Games of 1936, more than any other country.\n\nThe German team, which enjoyed unprecedented government backing, was quite possibly the best prepared in the 40-year history of the modern Olympics up to that stage.\n\nGerman athletes particularly dominated the rowing, in which they won five of the seven available gold medals, equestrianism (all six golds) and gymnastics (six out of nine golds).\n\nThey also won, among others, five athletics gold medals, all of them in field events. Proceedings on the track were, of course, dominated by Jesse Owens, the black American athlete, who won four gold medals under the gaze of Hitler. Owens was successful in the 100m, the 200m, the long jump and the 4 x 100m relay while USA finished with an overall total of 24 gold medals, second only to the host country.\n\n34 days to go . . .\n\n34: The number of Olympic archery gold medals that have been won in men's events.\n\nThe sport made its first appearance at the Paris Games of 1900, when there were six separate categories, and it featured again in 1904, 1908 and 1920 before being dropped from the programme until 1972.\n\nBelgian archers have won 10 gold medals, more than any country, though eight of those were won at the Antwerp Games of 1920, when Belgium were one of only three countries that participated in the archery disciplines. USA have won nine gold medals and they are followed by France, who have won six, and South Korea (three).\n\nGreat Britain have claimed one gold medal, with William Dod winning the York Round in 1908. Since 1972, Britain have won three bronze medals: Simon Terry won one in 1992 while the British team did likewise in both 1988 and 1992.\n\n35 days to go . . .\n\n35: The number of gold medals that have been won by Belgium at the summer Olympics.\n\nBelgium, who have participated in 23 of the 25 summer Olympics, made their debut at the Paris Games of 1900, when they won five gold medals, but much their most successful Olympics was when they hosted the 1920 Games in Antwerp. There, they finished fifth in the final medal table by securing 13 golds (including seven in archery and two in equestrianism) to go with 11 silver and 11 bronze.\n\nSince World War Two, however, they have won a total of only 11 gold medals, with their best haul at one Games being just two - a feat they achieved in 1948, 1952, 1964 and 1996.\n\nThey also won a single gold medal at the Olympics of 1980 and 1984 as well as four years ago, when Justine Henin-Hardenne won the women's singles tennis title.\n\n36 days to go . . .\n\n36: The number of different countries that won a medal at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, with 25 of them claiming at least one gold.\n\nWith USA, West Germany and Japan among the 50 or so nations who opted to boycott the Games, following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979, it was an Olympics that was dominated by the Soviet Union, who harvested no less than 195 medals, and East Germany, who secured 126.\n\nThe next highest was the 41 achieved by Bulgaria. Great Britain secured 21 medals, which was made up of five gold, seven silver and nine bronze.\n\nBritain's golds were won by Allan Wells in the 100m, Steve Ovett in the 800m, Sebastian Coe in the 1,500m, Daley Thompson in the decathlon and Duncan Goodhew in the 100m breaststroke.\n\nGuyana and Lebanon, who won one bronze medal apiece, finished bottom of the medal table\n\n37 days to go . . .\n\n37: The number of countries that were represented at the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles. It was the lowest total since the Antwerp Games of 1920, when 29 countries participated, though not altogether surprising given the effects of the Great Depression and the then relative remoteness of the host city.\n\nColombia and China were the only two nations to make their Olympic debut, with both countries sending a sole representative.\n\nIn total, there were 1,332 athletes, 126 of whom were women, though the overall figure was less than half the number that had participated in Amsterdam four years previously.\n\nThe 1932 Games, however, were the first to last 16 days (between 1900 and 1928, the shortest summer Games spanned 79 days) and the duration of the Olympics has been between 15 and 18 days ever since.\n\n38 days to go . . .\n\n38: The number of different countries that won a medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, with 25 of them claiming at least one gold.\n\nThe Soviet Union, with 98, finished with the most medals overall and they were followed by USA (74), Australia (35), Hungary (26) and Germany (26).\n\nGreat Britain secured 24 medals, which was made up of six gold, seven silver and 11 bronze. The six gold medals were won by: Chris Brasher in the 3000m steeplechase, Judith Grinham in the 100m backstroke swimming, Terence Spinks and Richard McTaggart in boxing (in the flyweight and lightweight divisions, respectively), Gillian Sheen in the individual foil fencing competition and by the three-day event equestrianism team.\n\nFour countries won just one bronze medal: Bahamas, Greece, Switzerland and Uruguay.\n\n39 days to go . . .\n\n39: The number of competitors that entered the women's 400m freestyle swimming event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, though few expected Ireland's Michelle Smith to be among the leading contenders.\n\nShe had competed in four events at the 1988 Games in Seoul, where her best placing was 17th in the 200m backstroke. Her highest finish in Barcelona four years later, when she entered three events, was a lowly 26th in the 400m individual medley.\n\nSmith shocked the world, however, when she won the 400m freestyle gold medal in Atlanta. Incredibly, she also won the 200m individual medley and the 400m individual medley as well as claiming a bronze in the 200m butterfly.\n\nIn 1998, Smith was banned from swimming for four years, a punishment that effectively ended her career, after being found guilty of tampering with a urine sample. Analysis of the sample taken form her found “unequivocal signs of adulteration”.\n\n40 days to go . . .\n\n40: The number of days that elapsed between Abebe Bikila, the Ethiopian marathon runner, having an appendectomy in 1964 and retaining his Olympic title in Tokyo. Bikila, who was born on August 7, 1932 - the very day of the Los Angeles Olympic marathon - won the 1960 title in Rome, in a world best time of 2:15:16.2, as a complete outsider.\n\nMore than that, he ran barefoot for the whole race. Forty days before the 1964 Olympic marathon, he collapsed in pain while on a training run in Ethiopia and was taken to hospital, where he was diagnosed with acute appendicitis.\n\nHaving been operated on immediately, he started jogging in the hospital courtyard at night during his recovery period.\n\nAstonishing, he not only competed in Tokyo (this time running with shoes), but became the first person ever to retain his Olympic marathon title, winning in a new world best time of 2:12:11.2.\n\n41 days to go . . .\n\n41: The number of different countries that won a medal at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, with 26 of them claiming at least one gold.\n\nThe Soviet Union, with 125, finished with the most medals overall and they were followed by USA (94), East Germany (90), West Germany (39) and Romania (27). Great Britain claimed 13 medals, which comprised three gold, five silver and five bronze. The three gold medals were won by David Wilkie in the 200m breaststroke, the men's modern pentathlon team and the pairing of Reginald White and John Osborn in Tornado sailing.\n\nBrendan Foster's bronze in the men's 10,000m was Britain's sole track and field medal. Australia, for their part, did not win a single gold medal in the entire Games, finishing up with a paltry one silver and four bronze. Five countries won just one bronze medal: Austria, Bermuda, Pakistan, Puerto Rico and Thailand.\n\n42 days to go . . .\n\n42: The age of Great Britain's Frederick Humphreys when he became, in 1920, the oldest person to win an Olympic gold medal in tug of war, which formed part of the athletics programme between 1900 and 1920 . Humphreys was 42 years and 204 days old when he claimed a second gold medal to add to the one that he gained in London 1908.\n\nHe also won silver in 1912, thereby making him one of three men to win a record two golds and a silver in the event, with the others being compatriots and team-mates John James Shepherd and Edwin Mills.\n\nNot that team composition was along traditional lines. The winning 1900 team was made up of three Danes and three Swedes, with one of the Danes being a journalist called Edgar Aaybe who was covering the Games for Politiken before being commandeered to the Danish team.\n\nIn 1908, the City of London Police beat Liverpool Police in the final.\n\n43 days to go . . .\n\n43: The number of Olympic shooting medals (12 gold, 15 silver, 16 bronze) that have been won by Great Britain, a total that has been exceeded only by USA, who have claimed 98, the Soviet Union (57) and Sweden (55).\n\nShooting events were included in the inaugural modern Olympics of 1896 and have been present at every Games since, with the exception of 1904 and 1928. Women's shooting was admitted to the programme in 1984, though no British woman has yet won a medal. Six of Britain's gold medals were collected in 1908, when London was the host city, while the most recent was the one gained by Richard Faulds in the double-trap competition in 2000.\n\nIn between, British teams won the small-bore rifle and double-shot running deer gold medals in 1912 and 1924, respectively, while Bob Braithwaite lifted the trap title in 1968 and Malcolm Cooper won the small-bore rifle discipline in both 1984 and 1988.\n\n44 days to go . . .\n\n44: The number of different events that comprised the first modern Olympics, which took place in Athens in 1896. Gold, silver and bronze medals, however, would not be awarded until the 1906 Games in the Greek capital, which were later downgraded to become known as the Intermediate Games.\n\nInstead, in 1896, the winners received an olive branch, a certificate and a silver medal while the runners-up were presented with a laurel sprig and a copper medal. USA won the most events (11) and they were followed by Greece (10), Germany (seven), France (five) and Great Britain (three). Some of the events have rather changed in the past 112 years.\n\nAmong Greece’s winners were Ioannis Malokinis, who triumphed in the 100m swimming event that was open only to sailors, and Nicolaos Andriakopolous, who won the rope-climbing competition.\n\n45 days to go . . .\n\n45: The number of Olympic boxing medals (13 gold, 11 silver, 21 bronze) that have been won by Great Britain, an overall total that has been superseded only by USA, who have won 109, Cuba (56) and the Soviet Union (53).\n\nThe last British gold medallist (and the first since Chris Finnegan won the middleweight division in 1968) was Audley Harrison, who lifted the super-heavyweight title in 2000. Britain won all five boxing gold medals at the 1908 London Olympics, as well as four of the five silvers and all five bronzes.\n\nAmong the gold-medal winners in 1908 was Johnny Douglas, who beat Australia's Reginald “Snowy” Baker on points in the final of the middleweight division. A talented all-round cricketer who played 23 Tests, Douglas led England to victory in the Ashes series of 1911-12.\n\nIn 1930, off the coast of Denmark, he drowned at sea trying to save his father's life after two boats had collided in the fog.\n\n46 days to go . . .\n\n46: The number of countries that were represented at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, a then record that was surpassed when 49 nations participated in Berlin eight years later.\n\nPanama and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) were among those countries who were making their Olympic debut in 1928 while Germany were readmitted to the fold after 16 years of exile from the summer Games.\n\nIn total, there were 2,883 athletes, 277 of whom were women. Indeed, the number of female participants more than doubled from the previous Games, largely on account of the fact that women were finally permitted to compete in athletics and gymnastics events.\n\nBy dint of emerging victorious in the women's 800m final, Lina Radke won the first Olympic track and field gold medal in Germany‘s history.\n\n47 days to go . . .\n\n47: The number of Olympic gymnastics medals that have been won by Switzerland, a total that has been exceeded only by the Soviet Union, who have won 204 medals, Japan (90), USA (86) and Romania (67).\n\nAll of Switzerland's medals (15 gold, 19 silver, 13 bronze) have been won by male gymnasts, with the last gold being claimed by Lin Donghua, who lifted the pommel horse title in 1996.\n\nThat apart, all of Switzerland's gold medals were won between 1896, when Jules Zutter was victorious in the inaugural pommel horse competition, and 1952, when Hans Eugster and Jack Gunthard won the parallel bars and the horizontal bar, respectively.\n\nGreat Britain have only ever won three gymnastics medals: S Walter Tysal secured silver in the individual combined exercises in 1908 while there have also been two bronzes - in the men's team event in 1912 and in the women's team event in 1928.\n\n48 days to go . . .\n\n48: The number of medals that have been won in Olympic taekwondo events since the Korean martial art was introduced, for men and for women, as a medal sport at the 2000 Games, having previously been a demonstration sport in 1988 and 1992.\n\nTranslated literally, \"tae\" means to smash or kick with the foot and \"kwon\" to punch or destroy with the fist or hand, while \"do\" is an art or a way. And it is South Korea who have won the most medals, having garnered a total of eight, five of them gold.\n\nTaipei lie second with five medals while a host of countries, including Greece, Cuba, Iran and Mexico, have each won three.\n\nNo British competitor has won a medal. Olympic competition comprises four weight classes for both men and women.\n\nA point is awarded for each legitimate blow while a point is deducted for each penalty.\n\n49 days to go . . .\n\n49: The number of Olympic cycling medals (10 gold, 20 silver, 19 bronze) that have been won by Great Britain, a total that has been exceeded only by France, who have secured 77, and Italy, who have 54 to their name.\n\nAll but one of Britain's medals have been claimed by men, with the exception being Yvonne McGregor's bronze in the 3,000m individual pursuit in 2000.\n\nChris Boardman's triumph in the 4,000m individual pursuit in 1992 was Britain's first cycling gold since the 2,000m tandem event of 1920, though three more golds have since followed: Jason Queally and Chris Hoy won the 1,000m time trial in 2000 and 2004, respectively, while Bradley Wiggins matched Boardman's feat by lifting the 4,000m individual pursuit title in 2004.\n\nAll of the five other gold medals were gained in 1908, when London acted as the host city.\n\n50 days to go . . .\n\n50: The 50-kilometre walk, which equates to a distance of just over 31 miles, was introduced to the Olympic programme in 1932 and adheres to the same rules as the 20km walk, whereby a competitor must keep at least one foot in contact with the ground at all times.\n\nHe must also straighten the leg as soon as it has made contact with the ground. Three warnings from the judges results in disqualification.\n\nThe 50km walk is an event that has been won by a British athlete on three occasions: Tommy Green (1932), Harry Whitlock (1936) and Don Thompson (1960).\n\nOnly Poland, for whom Robert Korzeniowski has won the past three gold medals, can match Britain's feat while Italy and East Germany have both been successful twice.\n\nThe Olympic record is held by the Soviet Union's Vyacheslav Ivanenko, who finished in a time of 3:38:29 in 1988.\n\n51 days to go . . .\n\n51: The number of Olympic equestrianism medals that have been won by Germany, more than any other nation and a total that also excludes a further 25 medals that were harvested by West Germany between 1968 and 1988.\n\nThe United States are second on the list, having won 46 medals, and they are followed by Sweden (40 medals), France (25) and Great Britain (23).\n\nApart from the 1952 team showjumping competition, all of Britain's six gold medals have been won in three-day event disciplines: Richard Meade and Leslie Law won the individual title in 1972 and 2004, respectively, while the team were successful in 1956, 1968 and 1972.\n\nWith the exceptions of 1904 and 1908, equestrianism has formed part of the Olympic programme at every Games since 1900, though it was necessary to hold the 1956 equestrianism events in Sweden because of Australia's strict quarantine laws at the time.\n\n52 days to go . . .\n\n52: The number of different countries, from a possible 159, that won a medal at the 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, with 31 of those nations winning at least one gold medal.\n\nThe Soviet Union and East Germany, which were both competing for the last time, topped the medal table with 132 and 102 medals, respectively, while the United States finished third with 94.\n\nGreat Britain finished in 12th position with 24 medals (five gold, 10 silver, nine bronze) while Sweden, for their part, won the most medals (11) without winning a single gold. Britain's gold medal winners were Adrian Moorhouse (swimming), Steve Redgrave and Andy Holmes (rowing), Michael McIntyre and Bryn Vaile (sailing), Malcolm Cooper (shooting) and the men's hockey team.\n\nThe seven countries to win a sole bronze medal were Colombia, Djibouti, Greece, Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand.\n\n53 days to go . . .\n\n53: The age at which “Queenie” Newall, of Great Britain, became the oldest female gold medallist, at the 1908 London Olympics. She also remains the oldest female champion in modern Olympic history.\n\nThe Lancashire-born Newall was 53 years and 275 days old when she won the women’s double National Round archery competition, in which the archers shot a total of 144 arrows each over the course of two rounds.\n\nEach round consisted of 48 arrows from 60 yards and 24 arrows from 50 yards. Lottie Dod, who won the Wimbledon women’s singles tennis title on five occasions between 1887 and 1893, finished second and Beatrice Hill-Low third to complete a British clean sweep of the medals - which was not altogether surprising, given that all the competitors were from the host nation. Archery appeared on the Olympic programme only once more, in 1920, before being readmitted in 1972.\n\n54 days to go . . .\n\n54: The number of Olympic athletics medals that have been won by Kenya since they made their debut appearance in 1956.\n\nIt is the highest total among African nations and one that has been surpassed by only 10 other countries. Kenya's haul is made up of 16 gold medals, 23 silver and 15 bronze, with only four of those (three silver and one bronze) having been claimed by female athletes. All 16 gold medals have been won on the track, with the 3,000m steeplechase yielding no less than eight of those.\n\nIndeed, since 1968, when Amoss Biwott won it, the 3,000m steeplechase title has been lifted by Kenya at every Olympics in which they have participated. (They boycotted the Games in both 1976 and 1980).\n\nKenya have also won the 1,500m on three occasions, the 800m twice and the 5,000m, the 10,000m and the 4 x 400m relay once each.\n\n55 days to go . . .\n\n55: The distance, in centimetres, by which Bob Beamon of the United States smashed the long jump world record when he leapt a prodigious 8.90 metres at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.\n\nAfter 19 loping strides, the 22-year-old New Yorker hit the take-off board perfectly and flew through the air as no one had ever before. Even allowing for the high altitude and a maximum permitted wind, it was a quite staggering performance by Beamon, whose previous personal best had been 8.33m.\n\nIndeed, so much so that his history-making leap on Oct 18, 1968 was beyond the capability of the measuring device in use at the pit and a steel tape had to be utilised.\n\nBeamon's world record was not broken until 1991, when Mike Powell, a fellow American, jumped 8.95 metres to win the World Championships in Tokyo.\n\n56 days to go . . .\n\n56: The number of gold medals that Great Britain won when London hosted the 1908 Olympic Games. Not surprisingly, it is Britain's highest gold-medal haul at an Olympics, with the next best tally being the 17 that were won at the Paris Games of 1900.\n\nHaving been asked to stage the 1908 Games at short notice (they were due to be held in Rome, which withdrew its candidacy after the 1906 eruption of Mount Vesuvius), Britain certainly made the most of home advantage, winning every gold medal in the tennis, boxing, rowing and sailing events.\n\nIn addition, the host country claimed five out of six gold medals in cycling, four out of six in swimming, two out of three in archery and two out of three in motor-boating.\n\nAmong other sports, Britain also won the polo, the water polo, the football\n\n57 days to go . . .\n\n57: The age at which Great Britain's Allen Whitty became the oldest gold medallist of the 1924 Paris Olympics.\n\nWhitty was 57 years and 59 days old when he won gold in the 100-metre team running deer double-shot event, which took place on the shooting ranges of Versailles. A team consisted of four shooters, who each fired 10 times two shots, with a maximum of five points per shot being available.\n\nWhitty scored 68 points out of a possible 100, the third highest in the competition, as Britain amassed a team total of 263 out of a maximum 400, beating Norway to the gold medal by a single point.\n\nWhitty, who died in 1949 at the age of 82, fared less well in the individual double-shot discipline in 1924, finishing with a disappointing total of 56 out of 100 and coming 18th out of 31 competitors.\n\n58 days to go . . .\n\n58: The number of Olympic athletics medals (13 gold, 21 silver, 24 bronze) that have been won by France, 46 of them in men's events and 12 in women's.\n\nThree of the men's seven gold medals have come in the marathon (Michel Theato in 1900, Mohamed El Ouafi in 1928, Alain Mimoun in 1956), two in the pole vault (Pierre Quinon in 1984, Jean Galfione in 1996) and one apiece in the 5,000m (Joseph Guillemot in 1920) and the 110m hurdles (Guy Drut in 1976).\n\nOnly three French women have ever won an Olympic athletics gold medal, with two of them being multiple winners: Marie-Jose Perec, who won the 200m in 1996 and the 400m in both 1992 and 1996, and Micheline Ostermeyer, who claimed the shot and discus titles in 1948.\n\nColette Besson won the 400m in 1968 when she pipped Great Britain's Lillian Board by less than a tenth of a second.\n\n59 days to go . . .\n\n59: The number of nations that competed at the 1948 London Games, a then record that was surpassed when 69 countries participated in Helsinki four years later.\n\nAmong those making their Olympic debut in London were a number of Communist countries (though not the Soviet Union), as well as British Guiana, Burma, Ceylon, Colombia, Guatemala, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Korea, Lebanon, Pakistan, Panama, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Syria, Trinidad & Tobago and Venezuela.\n\nGermany and Japan were not invited to participate, following the events of World War Two, although Italy were.\n\nA total of 4,104 athletes (3,714 men and 390 women) took part in the Games while 37 different countries won a medal, of which 23 gained at least one gold. Great Britain, who won 56 golds when previously acting as hosts in 1908, claimed only three gold medals.\n\n60 days to go . . .\n\n60: The total number of summer Olympic medals (15 gold, 23 silver, 22 bronze) that have been won by Argentina, who were represented by one individual at both the 1900 and 1908 Olympics before sending their first team to a Games in 1920.\n\nThey claimed their first medals in 1924 - one gold (courtesy of the polo team), three silvers and two bronzes - and maintained a consistent record during the course of the next three decades, claiming at least one gold medal at each of the next five Games.\n\nThey failed, however, to win gold in 1956 and did not do so again until 2004, when the men's basketball and men's football's teams both won their events to end a 52-year drought.\n\nIn the midst of their appalling run, Argentina failed to gain a single medal at either the 1976 or the 1984 Games, while they boycotted the Moscow Olympics of 1980.\n\n61 days to go . . .\n\n61: The number of medals that have been won in Olympic badminton events since the Barcelona Games of 1992, when it was introduced as a medal sport (though it had been a demonstration sport in Munich 20 years earlier).\n\nAnd it is a sport that has been thoroughly dominated by Asian countries, with China having won 22 of the 61 medals, Indonesia 15 and South Korea 14.\n\nOf the remaining 10 medals, four have been won by Denmark, three by Malaysia, two by Great Britain and one by the Netherlands. Both of Britain's medals have come in the mixed doubles, which was added to the roster in 1996.\n\nJoanne Wright-Goode and Simon Archer won bronze in 2000 before Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson claimed silver four years ago, after losing a gripping final to China's Zhang Jun and Gao Ling by two sets to one.\n\n62 days to go . . .\n\n62: The age, in years, of the oldest competitor to participate at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nFrancois Latil, of Vanuatu, was 62 years and 98 days old when he competed in the men's singles archery event.\n\nThe 64 archers competed in head-to-head elimination matches in the 70m discipline after a ranking round had determined their seeding.\n\nAlas for Latil, who was seeded 61st out of 64, he lost 158-145 to Rod White of the United States in the first round.\n\nWhite, for his part, lost in the next round while Simon Needham, Great Britain's only competitor, also bowed out in the round of 32 after finishing a creditable ninth in the ranking round.\n\nVanuatu, an island nation in the South Pacific, have competed at all five summer Olympics since they made their debut at the 1988 Seoul Games, but they have yet to win a medal.\n\n63 days to go . . .\n\n63: The number of successive victories that the United States men's basketball team had won at the Olympics before they were controversially defeated 51-50 by the Soviet Union in the gold medal match at the Munich Games of 1972.\n\nUntil that point, the US had won every match that they had contested since basketball became an Olympic sport at the 1936 Berlin Games.\n\nAfter 1972, the Americans have failed to win the gold medal on three further occasions: in 1980, when they boycotted the Moscow Games, in 1988, when they won bronze (behind the Soviet Union, the gold medallists, and Yugoslavia), and in 2004, when they again finished in third place (behind winners Argentina and second-placed Italy).\n\nOverall, the US have won the men's basketball gold medal on 12 occasions while the Soviet Union have won twice and Yugoslavia and Argentina once each.\n\n64 days to go . . .\n\n64: The number of years that elapsed between tennis being an Olympic official sport.\n\nAfter being included in the inaugural modern Games in Athens in 1896 (when the Irish-born John Pius Boland won the men's singles title for Great Britain), tennis was included at every Olympics until 1924, after which it was dropped until 1988, a gap of 64 years (although it was a demonstration sport in 1968 and 1984).\n\nOne of the mixed doubles gold medallists at the Paris Games of 1924 was Norris Williams, a Swiss-born American who was also a survivor of the Titanic disaster of 1912, though he had come perilously close to having to have his legs amputated, after spending several hours knee-deep in freezing water in a collapsible lifeboat.\n\nWilliams, who was 21 at the time of the Titanic sinking, died in 1968 at the age of 77.\n\n65 days to go . . .\n\n65: The number of Olympic gold medals that have been won by Cuba, who have competed in 17 summer Olympiads since making their debut at the Paris Games of 1900.\n\nCuba won one fencing gold at those Olympics and a further four - all in fencing, too - at the St Louis Games of 1904, but had to wait a further 68 years before striking gold again (which they did three times) in Munich in 1972.\n\nSince then, they have won at least six golds at every Games except those of 1984 and 1988, when they were voluntarily absent.\n\nTheir best gold-medal haul of 14, seven of which came in boxing events, came at the Barcelona Games of 1992, when they finished fifth in the final medals table.\n\nBoxing, indeed, has been Cuba's most fruitful Olympic sport by a distance, with their overall medal haul of 56 (32 gold, 16 silver, eight bronze) being second only to the USA's total of 109.\n\n66 days to go . . .\n\n66: The number of Olympic canoeing medals that have been won by Hungary, more than any other nation, since canoeing competitions were officially introduced to the Games in Berlin in 1936.\n\nHungary's medal total, 50 (13 gold, 19 silver, 18 bronze) have been won in men's event's and 16 (four gold, seven silver, five bronze) in women's.\n\nGermany, who have gained 62 medals, are second on the list and they are followed by the Soviet Union (53 medals), Romania (34), East Germany (30) and Sweden (30).\n\nGreat Britain have claimed a total of six medals (three silver, three bronze), three of which were won in Athens four years ago: by Campbell Walsh (silver in the men‘s slalom), Ian Wynne (bronze in the men's 500m flatwater) and Helen Reeves (bronze in the women‘s slalom), respectively.\n\n67 days to go . . .\n\n67: The number of countries that were represented at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, two less than had participated in Helsinki four years previously.\n\nAmong those nations making their Olympic debut in 1956 were teams from Cambodia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Kenya, Liberia, Taiwan, Uganda, Malaya and North Borneo (the latter two countries now combined as Malaysia).\n\n68 days to go . . .\n\n68: The number of years that elapsed between Great Britain winning an Olympic gold medal in men's swimming events.\n\nAfter claiming four golds at the 1908 London Games (courtesy of Henry Taylor in the 400m freestyle and the 1500m freestyle, Frederick Holman in the 200m breaststroke and the 4 x 200m freestyle relay team), Britain had to wait until David Wilkie won the 200m breaststroke in 1976 before gold was secured again.\n\nIn the intervening period, British men won eight swimming medals, five of them silver and three bronze. The silvers were gained by John Hatfield (in the 400m freestyle and the 1500m freestyle in 1912), Bobbie McGregor (in the 100m freestyle in 1964), Martyn Woodroffe (in the 200m butterfly in 1968) and Wilkie (in the 200m breaststroke in 1972).\n\nThe bronzes were won by Percy Courtman (in the 400m breaststroke in 1912) and the 4 x 200m freestyle relay team (in both 1912 and 1920).\n\n69 days to go . . .\n\n69: The number of countries that were represented at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, a then record that was surpassed when 83 nations participated at the Rome Games eight years later.\n\nAmong those countries who were making their Olympic debut in 1952 were teams from the Bahamas, Dutch Antilles, Gold Coast (now Ghana), Guatemala, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Nigeria, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nThe Saarland, an independent German region with its own National Olympic Committee, appeared in the Olympics for the one and only time.\n\nFor the first time since 1912, athletes from Russia took part in an Olympic Games, though they were now representing a communist Soviet Union.\n\nHaving participated as part of a united Korea in 1948, South Korea made its Olympic debut as a country in its own right.\n\n70 days to go . . .\n\n70: The number of years that elapsed between Jim Thorpe, an American athlete, having the gold medals he had won in the pentathlon and decathlon events at the 1912 Stockholm Games taken away from him for so-called professionalism, and replica gold medals being presented to his family in 1983.\n\nHaving set world records in both competitions in Stockholm, Thorpe's world was turned upside early in 1913 when it was revealed that he had, in 1909 and 1910, earned some $15 a week playing minor league baseball in North Carolina.\n\nMany college players, in fact, spent their summers playing professionally, but most of them played under aliases, unlike Thorpe. Despite a welter of sympathy from the American public at large, his name was expunged from the record books and he was forced to return his medals and trophies.\n\nVirtually penniless, Thorpe died of a heart attack in his trailer home in California on March 28, 1953.\n\n71 days to go . . .\n\n71: The weight, in kilograms, that Launceston Elliot successfully lifted to win the one-arm lift competition at the inaugural modern Games in Athens in 1896 and thereby become Great Britain's first ever Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nViggo Jensen, a Danish weightlifter, finished in second place after recording a lift of 57 kilograms, but controversially beat the Briton in in the two-arm lift event at the same Games after both competitors had tied on 111.5 kilograms.\n\nJensen was awarded first place as a result of his \"better style\", because Elliot had moved one foot while lifting.\n\nJensen, in fact, was a highly competent all-round athlete.\n\nAs well as finishing fourth in the rope climb (an event in which Elliot came fifth), the Dane also claimed a silver medal in the free pistol event and a bronze medal in the three positions free rifle competition.\n\n72 days to go . . .\n\n72: The age of the oldest ever Olympic medallist. Oscar Swahn, a Swedish shooter, was 72 years and 280 days old when he claimed a silver medal in the double shot running deer team competition at the 1920 Antwerp Games.\n\nSwahn, who won a total of six Olympic medals between 1908 and 1920, also remains the oldest person to have won an Olympic gold medal. He was 64 years and 258 days old when Sweden won the single shot running deer team event at the 1912 Stockholm Games.\n\nSwahn qualified to compete in the Paris Olympics at the age of 76, but illness prevented him from doing so. He died three years later.\n\nIn all of the team competitions that Swahn entered at the Olympics of 1908, 1912 and 1920, he was accompanied by his son Alfred Swahn, who won an overall total of nine Olympic medals - three of each colour - between 1908 and 1924.\n\n73 days to go . . .\n\n73: The number of Olympic records (together with 36 world records and 39 European records) that were set at the Moscow Olympics of 1980.\n\nAnd all that despite the fact that the USA, West Germany and Japan were among more than 50 countries to boycott the Games, following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the previous year.\n\nA plethora of Olympic records were eclipsed in track and field events alone.\n\nAmong those to be broken in men's competitions were the 20km walk, the 50km walk, the high jump (in which East Germany's Gerd Wessig set a world record 2.36m) and the pole vault (which yielded a world record 5.78m for Poland's Wladislaw Kozakiewicz).\n\nIn women's events, Barbel Wockel and Marita Koch, the East German sprinters, established Olympic records in the 200m and 400m, respectively, while there were world records in the 1,500m and the 4 x 100m relay. Sara Simeone, of Italy, created an Olympic record in the high jump by leaping 1.97m\n\n74 days to go . . .\n\n74: The number of different countries that won medals at the Athens Olympics four years ago, 56 of which claimed at least one gold.\n\nUSA, with 102 medals, finished on top of the tree and they were followed by Russia (92 medals), China (63), Australia (49), Germany (49) and Japan (37). Great Britain came tenth in the table with 30 medals, which comprised nine gold, nine silver and 12 bronze.\n\nEritrea, Serbia/Montenegro, United Arab Emirates and Paraguay were among those nations to win their first ever Olympic medal.\n\nTen countries won just one medal: Cameroon, the Dominican Republic, UAE, Hong Kong, India, Paraguay, Eritrea, Mongolia, Syria and Trinidad & Tobago. India's silver medal was only the 15th they have won in Olympic history, with 11 of those (including all eight gold medals) having come in men's hockey.\n\n75 days to go . . .\n\n75: The 75kg middleweight event, in which competitors must not weigh more than 75 kilograms, is one of nine disciplines in men's Olympic weightlifting, with the lightest being the 52kg flyweight division and the heaviest being the over-110kg super-heavyweight.\n\nNo British athlete has ever won a middleweight medal, though Britain have claimed eight medals overall in men's weightlifting, with the only gold being won by Launceston Elliot in the one-hand lift heavyweight event in Athens in 1896.\n\nIt is a sport that has been largely dominated by eastern European countries, with the Soviet Union having won 71 medals (44 gold, 25 silver, two bronze), Bulgaria 36 and Poland 27.\n\nThe USA have won 40 medals, though the last of their 15 golds was won as long ago as 1960, when Charles Vinci retained the bantamweight title he won in 1956.\n\n76 days to go . . .\n\n76: The overall number of medals (17 gold, 21 silver, 38 bronze) that have been won by Brazil at the summer Olympics.\n\nHaving won only three medals (one of each colour at the 1920 Antwerp Games) before the onset of World War Two, Brazil have garnered at least one medal at every Olympics since then, though their fortunes have improved dramatically in recent years.\n\nOf their 76 medals, 37 have been claimed at the past three Olympics, with their haul of 15 in Atlanta in 1996 being their highest overall return at a single Games.\n\nThe most gold medals they have won at one Olympics is five, a feat they achieved in Athens four years ago.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Brazil have never won a football gold medal, though they have claimed seven of the 18 medals awarded in beach volleyball since it was introduced to the Olympics in 1996, including two golds.\n\n77 days to go . . .\n\n77: The number of Olympic cycling medals (37 gold, 20 silver, 20 bronze) that have been won by France, more than any other country.\n\nOf France's total, 67 have been won by men and 10 by women. Italy, with 54, have won the second-highest number and they are followed by Great Britain (49), USA (46), Australia (41) and Germany (40).\n\nBritons have won 10 gold medals, among them Chris Boardman and Bradley Wiggins, who won the 4,000 metres individual pursuit in 1992 (Britain's first cycling gold since 1920) and 2004, respectively.\n\nJason Queally and Chris Hoy, for their part, both triumphed in the 1,000 metres time trial - Queally in 2000 and Hoy four years ago.\n\nBritain have gained only one medal in women's cycling since it was introduced to the Olympics in 1992, with the sole medallist being Yvonne McGregor, who won bronze in the 3,000m individual pursuit in 2000.\n\n78 days to go . . .\n\n78: The 78kg competition, whereby participants must not weigh more than 78 kilograms, is one of seven events in women's Olympic judo, with the lightest category being the 48kg discipline and the heaviest being for those over 78kg.\n\nWomen's judo was introduced as a demonstration sport at Seoul in 1988 before being added to the official Olympic programme at the 1992 Barcelona Games.\n\nNo Briton has won a medal in the 78kg event, but three British competitors have shared four medals between them in other categories. Sharon Rendle claimed bronze in the 52kg in 1992 and Nicola Fairbrother silver in the 57kg in 1992 while Kate Howey won bronze in the 70kg, also in 1992, before gaining a silver in the same event in 2000.\n\nJapan have won the most medals in women's judo, with their haul of 19 comprising seven gold, seven silver and five bronze.\n\n79 days to go . . .\n\n79: The number of medals that have been won in Olympic football, 70 of them in men's football and nine in women's.\n\nHungary, USA, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have won the most medals (five each), with the USA total including three in women's football (which was introduced as an Olympic sport in 1996). The most successful countries in terms of gold medals are Great Britain and Hungary, who have each claimed three each (Britain won the men's tournament in 1900, 1908 and 1912).\n\nThe 1968 final ended with only 18 players on the pitch, after three Bulgarians and a Hungarian were sent off, while the reigning men's champions are Argentina, who beat Paraguay 1-0 in the final four years ago, thanks to a Carlos Tevez goal.\n\nThe only current restriction on men's players is that they must be under 23 years of age, except for three players per squad. There are no such restrictions in the women's tournament.\n\n80 days to go . . .\n\n80: The number of medals (34 gold, 14 silver and 32 bronze) that have been won by New Zealand at the summer Olympics.\n\nHaving won three medals (one in 1908 and two in 1912) as part of a combined Australasian team, New Zealand won five medals (including a gold in both 1928 and 1936) in their own right before World War Two.\n\nSince 1952, they have won at least one gold medal at every Olympics except the boycott-affected Moscow Games of 1980, when a token team of five athletes competed as independents under the banner of the New Zealand Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association.\n\nNew Zealand's biggest haul of medals at one Games is 13 - a feat they achieved in Seoul in 1988 - while their most successful Olympics in terms of gold medals came four years previously, in Los Angeles.\n\nThere, they harvested eight golds, including four in canoeing and two in sailing.\n\n81 days to go . . .\n\n81: The weight limit of the Olympics light-heavyweight boxing division has been 81kgs since 1952, before which it was 80kgs in 1948 and 175lbs between 1920, when it became an Olympic event, and 1936.\n\nOf the 20 gold medals that have been awarded, USA have won seven, Yugoslavia three and South Africa two while Great Britain, Argentina, France, Italy, the Soviet Union, Germany, Kazakhstan and Russia have claimed one each.\n\nBritain's sole gold medallist was Harry Mitchell, at the 1924 Paris Games, while the last British boxer to win a medal of any colour in the 81kg discipline remains Donald Scott, who collected silver in London in 1948.\n\nAmong other gold medal winners have been a young Cassius Clay (later Muhammad Ali), who won in Rome in 1960, and Leon Spinks, the champion at the Montreal Olympics of 1976.\n\n82 days to go . . .\n\n82: The number of Olympic hockey medals that have been won, 61 in men's hockey and 21 in women's.\n\nThe Netherlands have won the most medals (13) and they are followed by India (11), Australia (10), Great Britain (10) and Pakistan (eight).\n\nIndia's record in men's hockey is unsurpassed. They have won eight Olympic golds, including six in succession between 1928 and 1956, though they failed to qualify for Beijing 2008 after losing a play-off to Britain earlier this year.\n\nBritain, for their part, have won the men's title on three occasions - in 1908, 1920 and, latterly, 1988, when two goals from Imran Sherwani and one from Sean Kerly steered Britain to a 3-1 triumph against West Germany in Seoul. After Britain's second goal went in, Barry Davies, who was commentating for the BBC, memorably opined: “Where, oh where, were the Germans? And frankly, who cares?“\n\n83 days to go . . .\n\n83: The number of Olympic wrestling medals (25 gold, 28 silver, 30 bronze) that have been won by Finland.\n\nIt is a figure that has been surpassed only by the Soviet Union, who claimed an astonishing 132 wrestling medals at the nine Games in which they competed, and USA, who have won 120.\n\nOf Finland's overall medal total, 57 have been gained in Greco-Roman events and 26 in freestyle. Finland's Adolf Lindfors, who was 41 years and 199 days old when he won the Greco-Roman heavyweight competition at the 1920 Antwerp Games, remains the oldest wrestling gold medallist in Olympic history.\n\nAmong other Finnish wrestling medallists were cousins Kustaa and Hermanni Pihlajamaki, who each won three freestyle wrestling medals between 1924 and 1936.\n\nWomen's wrestling was included in the Olympics for the first time in 2004, though none of the medallists were Finnish.\n\n84 days to go . . .\n\n84: The number of points that Argentina scored when they beat Italy 84-69 to win the men's basketball final at the Athens Games four years ago.\n\nThe victory gave Argentina their second gold medal in one day after 52 years without a single gold, following the earlier success of the men's football team (who beat Paraguay 1-0 with a Carlos Tevez goal).\n\nBefore that, Argentina had not claimed an Olympic gold since winning the men's double sculls in 1952.\n\nArgentina's victory in the basketball final, which was made possible by a 25-point haul by Luis Alberto Scola, was revenge for an earlier pool match, which Italy had edged 76-75.\n\nHaving also lost to Spain, Argentina rather stumbled into the quarter-finals, in which they beat host nation Greece 69-64. A 89-81 semi-final success against USA saw Argentina into the final and on the way to glorious gold.\n\n85 days to go . . .\n\n85: The number of baby grand pianos that featured in the spectacular opening ceremony at the Los Angeles Games of 1984.\n\nThe three-hour extravaganza of Hollywood-style glitz and glamour was produced by David Wolper, a noted film and television producer who was responsible for award-winning mini-series such as Roots and The Thorn Birds. As well as the grand pianos, there were marching bands, a choir of several hundred singers - all of them volunteers from local churches, schools and universities - dancers, buglers and a rocket-propelled man flying around the stadium.\n\nThe Games were formally opened by President Ronald Reagan while the final runner on the torch relay was Gina Hemphill, a granddaughter of Jesse Owens, the great black athlete who won four gold medals under the nose of Hitler at the 1936 Berlin Games.\n\n86 days to go . . .\n\n86: The number of Olympic gymnastics medals that have been won by the USA, a total surpassed only by the Soviet Union and Japan.\n\nOf USA's overall medal haul (61 of which have been won by men and 25 by women), 28 have been gold, 29 silver and 29 bronze. It is, however, a total that is greatly inflated by events at the St Louis Games of 1904, when 85 per cent of the competitors were from the host country.\n\nOf the 36 gymnastics medals available in St Louis, no less than 30 were won by Americans. Among more recent individual US medallists, Mary Lou Retton captured the imagination when she won the combined exercises competition at the Los Angeles Olympics of 1984 while Shannon Miller did likewise when she lifted the balance beam title at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Paul Hamm won the all-round contest for men in Athens four years ago.\n\n87 days to go . . .\n\n87: The length, in kilometres, of the first Olympic cycling road race, which was included in the inaugural modern Games in Athens in 1896.\n\nThe seven competitors, who comprised five Greeks, a Briton and a German, cycled from Athens to Marathon, where they had to sign their names, and back again on the same road.\n\nThe race was won by Aristidis Konstantinidis, a Greek, who prevailed despite falling three times and having to change his bike twice.\n\nAugust Goedrich, the German, came second and Britain's Edward Battel third.\n\nBritish residents supposedly tried to prevent Battel, a servant at the British Embassy in Athens, from entering the race because, in their eyes, he was not a \"gentleman\" and could not therefore be an amateur.\n\nThe most recent British medallist in the event, which now must be between 210 and 240 kilometres, is Max Sciandri, who claimed bronze at the 1996 Atlanta Games.\n\n88 days to go . . .\n\n88: The number of years that have elapsed since the Olympic flag containing five rings first flew, at the Antwerp Games of 1920, as the official symbol of the Olympic movement.\n\nAccording to the Olympic Charter, the design and proportions of the flag are those of the flag presented by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founding father of the modern Olympics, at the Paris Congress of 1914, which celebrated the 20th anniversary of the founding of the movement.\n\nDe Coubertin would later say that \"the Olympic flag has a white background, with five interlaced rings in the centre: blue, yellow, black, green and red. This design is symbolic. It represents the five continents of the world, united by Olympism, while the six colours are those that appear on all the national flags of the world at the present time.\"\n\n89 days to go . . .\n\n89: The number of gold medals that were won at the Paris Games of 1900, though many participants were unaware they were even competing in the Olympics, such was the chaotic organisation.\n\nFrance topped the medal table with 27 golds and they were followed by USA (19), Great Britain (17) and Switzerland (six). Among the swimming gold medallists were Charles de Vendeville, a Frenchman, who won the underwater swimming, and Frederick Lane, the Australian victor of the 200m obstacle event.\n\nBelgium's Leon de Lunden won the live pigeon shooting competition while Ray Ewry of the USA triumphed in both the standing long jump and the standing triple jump events.\n\nUSA also won gold in the men's and women's singles golf events while among team events, Britain beat France to win the cricket gold medal.\n\n90 days to go . . .\n\n90: The number of Olympic gymnastics medals that have been won by Japan, a total that has been superseded only by the Soviet Union, who have claimed 204.\n\nOf Japan's overall haul, an astonishing 89 have been won by men, with the exception being the bronze that was secured in the women's team event at the Tokyo Games of 1964.\n\nJapan won the men's team event at every Olympics between 1960 and 1976, though they had to wait until four years ago before they did so again.\n\nAmong their victorious team of 1960 was Masao Takemoto, who was 40 years and 344 days old at the time and remains the oldest gymnast to have won an Olympic gold medal.\n\nGreat Britain have won only three gymnastics medals (one silver, two bronze), with the last one being the bronze won in the women's team event of 1928.\n\n91 days to go . . .\n\n91: The 91 kilograms class in Olympic boxing is the super-heavyweight division, which was introduced at the 1984 Los Angeles Games and has been won by some notable competitors.\n\nTyrell Biggs of the USA won the inaugural title before Lennox Lewis, who was representing Canada at the time but would go onto become the heavyweight champion of the world while fighting under the British flag, beat America's Riddick Bowe by way of a second round technical knockout to claim the 1988 gold medal in Seoul.\n\nCuba's Roberto Balado was successful in Barcelona in 1992 before Vladimir Klichko, the Ukrainian - and current world heavyweight champion - won in 1996.\n\nThe past two winners have been Britain's Audley Harrison, whose professional career after his victory in Sydney in 2000 has flattered to deceive, and Russia's Alexander Pvyetkin in Athens four years ago.\n\n92 days to go . . .\n\n92: The number of swimming medals that were won by East Germany in the five summer Olympics (1968-1980 and 1988) at which they competed as a separate entity, as opposed to being part of a combined German team. It is a total that has been surpassed only by USA and Australia, who have won 462 and 156 medals, respectively.\n\nOf East Germany's medals, 18 were won by men and 74 by women, although quite how many of the overall total were gained with the help of performance-enhancing drugs is a moot point.\n\nThe Leipzig-born Kristin Otto won six gold medals in Seoul in 1988, setting the record for the most won by a female athlete at a single Games. She won the 50m and 100m freestyle, the 100m butterfly, the 100m backstroke, the 4 x 100m freestyle relay and the 4 x 100m medley relay.\n\nShe is the only swimmer to win Olympic titles in three different strokes.\n\n93 days to go . . .\n\n93: The number of countries that competed at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, then the highest number ever and 10 more than had taken part in Rome in 1960.\n\nTeams from 14 nations made their Olympic debut in 1964, although South Africa were not invited while Indonesia and North Korea were both banned, having participated in the unsanctioned GANEFO Games (Games of the New Emergent Forces) the year before.\n\n1964 was also the last summer Olympics until 1992 that a combined German team would participate.\n\nAs a reflection of their successful reconstruction after the Second World War, the Japanese selected Yoshinori Sakai, a student born on Aug 6, 1945 - the day the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima - to light the Olympic Flame.\n\nA total of 5,151 athletes (4,473 men, 678 women) took part in the 1964 Tokyo Games.\n\n94 days to go . . .\n\n94: The total number of medals (28 gold, 39 silver, 27 bronze) that have been won by Spain at the summer Olympics.\n\nThe record of Spain, who have attended 20 of the 25 Games, was abysmal until 1992, when Barcelona was the host city. Before that, they had won a total of only four gold medals (one each in 1928, 1980, 1984 and 1988), 12 silvers and nine bronzes, but 1992 proved to be the turning point.\n\nThey won 13 gold medals in Barcelona (four in sailing, two in men's athletics, two in women's judo and one apiece in men's swimming, men's cycling, men's archery, men's football and women's hockey) as well as seven silver and two bronze medals.\n\nSince then, Spain have won another 11 Olympic gold medals (five in 1996 and three each in 2000 and 2004) as well as 20 silvers and 16 bronzes.\n\n95 days to go . . .\n\n95: The number of Olympic judo gold medals that have been won. Judo was introduced as an Olympic sport at the 1964 Tokyo Games and it was therefore appropriate that Japan's Takehide Nakatani, who won the lightweight class, should be the first ever gold medal winner.\n\nJapan, indeed, have much the most successful overall record, having won 31 gold medals (24 by men, seven by women), and they are followed by France (10 gold medals), South Korea (eight) and the Soviet Union (seven). Great Britain have won 16 medals, though none of them have been gold.\n\nAngelo Parisi won a bronze in 1972 while representing Britain before winning a gold and two silvers in 1980 and 1984, by which time he had switched his allegiance to France.\n\nThe most recent British judo medallist is Kate Howey, who claimed silver in the 70kg division in Sydney in 2000.\n\n96 days to go . . .\n\n96: The number of medals that have been won by Australia in men's Olympic swimming events, a total that is second only to that of the USA, who have claimed a haul of 268 medals.\n\nAmong the most successful Australian male swimmers at the Olympics are Kieren Perkins, who won four medals (two gold, two silver) between 1992 and 2000, and Grant Hackett, who won a total of five medals (three gold, two silver) at the 2000 and 2004 Games.\n\nBetween them, Perkins and Hackett have won the past four 1500m freestyle finals.\n\nHowever, not even their achievements can match those of Ian Thorpe, who won a total of nine swimming medals - five gold, three silver and one bronze - during the course of the 2000 and 2004 Olympics. \"The Thorpedo\" won five of his medals in individual events and four in relays.\n\n97 days to go . . .\n\n97: The number of Olympic diving gold medals that have been won, 52 by men and 45 by women.\n\nUSA have much the most successful record of any country, having won 47 diving golds (27 by men and 20 by women), and they are followed by China, who have claimed 20, Sweden (six) and Germany (five).\n\nGreat Britain have won six diving medals, albeit none of them gold, with the most recent being the silver medal gained in the men's platform synchronised event in Athens four years ago.\n\nThe most successful diver in Olympic history is America's Greg Louganis, who won four gold medals (two each in 1984 and 1988), while the youngest diving champion - and the youngest individual champion in any sport at a summer Games - is Marjorie Gestring, an American, who won the springboard title in 1936 at the age of 13 years and 268 days.\n\n98 days to go . . .\n\n98: The number of medals that have been won in Olympic shooting events by the USA, more than any other nation. The Soviet Union are second on the list, having won 57 medals, and they are followed by Sweden (55 medals), Great Britain (43) and China (34).\n\nShooting was included in the first modern Games of 1896, undoubtedly because Baron Pierre de Counbertin, the founding father of the modern movement, was a fine pistol shot in his youth, and it is a sport that has featured at every Games since, with the exception of 1904 and 1928.\n\nThe oldest gold medallist in Olympic history is Oscar Swahn, a Swede, who was aged 64 years and 258 days when he won the running deer team event at Stockholm in 1912.\n\nThe most recent British shooting gold medallist is Richard Faulds, who won the double trap discipline at the 2000 Games in Sydney.\n\n99 days to go . . .\n\n99: The total number of gold medals that were won at the 1904 St Louis Olympics, with the USA winning no less than 80 of them.\n\nOf the other 19 golds, Germany, Canada and Cuba each won four, Austria and Hungary two apiece while Great Britain, Greece and Switzerland all claimed one.\n\nIt is perhaps not surprising that the Games were so utterly dominated by the States, who also won 84 silver medals and 84 bronze. Because of the problems of distance and travel, 85 per cent of the competitors were from the host country.\n\nIndeed, some events, such as cycling, were made up entirely of American participants. Only two of the 24 athletics events were won by non-Americans: Etienne Desmarteau, a Canadian policeman who died of typhoid the following year, in the 56lb weight throwing and Britain's Thomas Kiely in the Combined Events (a forerunner of the decathlon).\n\n100 days to go . . .\n\n100: The men's 100m has been an Olympic event since the very first modern Games in Athens in 1896, when Thomas Burke of the USA won in a time of 12.0. And it is an event that has been dominated by Americans ever since, with the States having won 16 of the 25 finals.\n\nGreat Britain have triumphed in the event on three occasions (Harold Abrahams in 1924, Allan Wells in 1980 and Linford Christie in 1992), Canada twice and South Africa, Germany, the Soviet Union and Trinidad & Tobago once each.\n\nBritons have also won two silver medals (Jack London in 1928 and Christie in 1988) and three bronzes (Harry Edward in 1920, Emmanuel McDonald-Bailey in 1952 and Peter Radford in 1960).\n\nChristie, of course, finished third in the 1988 final, but was awarded the silver medal after drug cheat Ben Johnson was disqualified.\n\n101 days to go . . .\n\n101: The number of points that were scored in the men's basketball final at the Munich Games of 1972, when the Soviet Union controversially beat the USA 51-50.\n\nDoug Collins made two free throws to give the US, who had never lost an Olympic basketball match, a 50-49 lead with three seconds remaining.\n\nThe Soviets in-bounded the ball right away, but two seconds later the head referee noticed a disturbance at the scorer's table and called an administrative timeout.\n\nladimir Kondrashkin, the Soviet coach, claimed that he had called for a timeout after Collins' first shot.\n\nThe Soviets were therefore given a second opportunity, and then a third, after Kondrashkin protested that the clock had been reset incorrectly.\n\nAleksandr Belov sank the winning basket on the buzzer and a subsequent appeal by the Americans, who refused to collect their silver medals, failed by a 3-2 margin.\n\n102 days to go . . .\n\n102: The number of Olympic medals that have been won in modern pentathlon.\n\nHungary and Sweden have won the most medals (21 each) and they are followed by the Soviet Union (17 medals), USA (nine) and Italy (seven).\n\nThe men's team event was discontinued after 1992 while an individual competition for women was added in 2000.\n\nGreat Britain have won a total of five medals: the men's team won gold in 1976 and bronze in 1988 before Stephanie Cook won gold in 2000 and Kate Allenby and Georgina Harland each claimed bronze in 2000 and 2004, respectively.\n\nModern pentathlon, which previously took place over the course of four or five days, is now held on one day only and consists of five events: shooting, fencing, a 200m freestyle swimming race, show jumping and a 3,000m cross-country run.\n\n103 days to go . . .\n\n103: The age at which Hal Haig \"Harry\" Prieste, an American, travelled to the 2000 Sydney Games to return the official Olympic flag that he had stolen 80 years earlier.\n\nAfter winning a bronze diving medal at the 1920 Antwerp Olympics, Prieste, who was responding to a dare by team-mate Duke Kahanamoku, shinned up a 15-foot flagpole in the dark of the night at the end of those Games to steal the flag, the first to fly the famous five-ring Olympic symbol.\n\nHe then kept the flag hidden in a suitcase for the best part of 80 years. Despite being legally blind and severely deaf, Prieste travelled to Sydney, where he handed the folded linen flag to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the then president of the IOC.\n\n\"I thought I ain't going to be around much longer - it's no good in a suitcase,\" said Prieste, who died the following year at the age of 104.\n\n104 days to go . . .\n\n104: The number of Olympic gold medals that have been won in women's gymnastics events.\n\nAlthough a team competition was held at the 1928, 1936 and 1948 Games, it was not until the Helsinki Olympics of 1952 that women's gymnastics was fully integrated into the Games. And it is a sport that has been thoroughly dominated by Eastern European countries ever since, with the Soviet Union having gained a total of 38 gold medals, Romania 22, Czechoslovakia nine, Russia eight and Hungary seven.\n\nThe most successful woman in Olympic gymnastics history is the Soviet Union's Larissa Latynina, who won nine gold medals (as well as five silver and four bronze) between 1956 and 1964.\n\nGreat Britain, who finished third in the 1928 team event, have won a solitary bronze meda\n\n105 days to go . . .\n\n105: The number of countries that Ignati Novikov, the head of the Organizing Committee for the 1980 Moscow Olympics and the then deputy Prime Minister of the Soviet Union, said, in March 1980, \"definitely\" intended to participate in the Games, which were still three months hence.\n\nFollowing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979 and with the Cold War still ongoing, the USA had already decided to boycott the Games. Novikov said that \"105 National Olympic Committees have informed the Organizing Committee that they definitely intend to participate in the Games.\"\n\nIn April 1980, TASS, the Soviet news agency, stated that that \"only seven National Olympic Committees have let us know they will not be able to participate in the Olympic Games.\"\n\n106 days to go . . .\n\n106: The number of Miss World contestants who participated in the recording of Light the Passion, Share the Dream - the official torch relay anthem for the 2008 Olympic Games - in Beijing last November.\n\nThe recording, together with the accompanying promotional video, was first broadcast to a global audience at the final of Miss World 2007, which took place on the southern China tropical island of Sanya on Dec 1 (and which was won by Miss China).\n\nThe Miss World contestants formed groups to take turns for the recording and the video. Miss Nigeria, otherwise known as Munachi Gail Teresa Abii Nwankwo, said: \"It is an honour for me as a contestant of the Miss World Pageant and a citizen of Nigeria to be a part of this memorable, prestigious event of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\"\n\n107 days to go . . .\n\n107: The number of medals (45 gold, 28 silver and 34 bronze) that the USA won at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, more than any other country. It was the last time that the USA would finish on top of the medals table until the boycott-affected Los Angeles Games of 1984.\n\nAmong the American medalists in 1968 were Jim Hines, who won the 100m in a world record 9.9 sec, and Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who finished first and third, respectively, in the 200m before each giving a Black Power salute on the medal rostrum.\n\nGreat Britain won 13 medals, with their five golds being won in the 400m hurdles (by David Hemery), the middleweight boxing division (by Chris Finnegan), the Flying Dutchman sailing discipline, the equestrianism three-day team event and the trap shooting competition (by John Braithwaite).\n\n108 days to go . . .\n\n108: The number of years that elapsed between Athens hosting the first modern Olympics in 1896 and playing host once again in 2004, although the Interim, or Intercalated, Games of 1906 also took place there.\n\nAgainst the will of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founding father of the modern movement, the International Olympic Committee voted in 1901 to stage Olympiads at two-year intervals and so it was that Athens hosted the Interim Games, which were held between the III and IV Olympiads. The medals awarded in 1906 are not officially recognised by the IOC.\n\nAthens was favoured to host the centenary Games of 1996, but surprisingly lost out to Atlanta.\n\n109 days to go . . .\n\n109: The number of Olympic boxing medals that have been won by the USA, more than any other country. Since boxing was first included in the modern Olympics in 1904, American boxers have won 48 gold medals, 23 silver and 38 bronze. Cuba, with a total of 56, have won the second highest number of medals and they are followed by the Soviet Union (53), Great Britain (45), Poland (43) and Italy (41).\n\nAmong the American gold medal winners are Joe Frazier and George Foreman, who won the heavyweight division in 1964 and 1968, respectively, and Cassius Clay (later Muhammad Ali), who won the light-heavyweight title in 1960.\n\nAmong the Britons to have won boxing gold is Johnny Douglas, who claimed the middleweight division in 1908 before captaining England's cricket team to Ashes success against Australia in 1911-12.\n\n110 days to go . . .\n\n110: The men's 110m hurdles has been an Olympic event since the very first modern Games in Athens in 1896, when Thomas Curtis of the USA won the gold medal.\n\nAnd it is an event that has been thoroughly dominated by American athletes ever since. In the 25 summer Olympics that have taken place - and also bearing in mind that the USA boycotted the 1980 Moscow Games - American hurdlers have won 18 gold medals, 18 silver and 16 bronze.\n\nCanada have claimed two of the other seven gold medals while South Africa, France, East Germany, Cuba and China have won one each.\n\nGreat Britain have won four medals: Grantley Goulding finished second behind Curtis in 1896 (when there were only two finalists), Don Finlay followed up a bronze in 1932 with a silver in 1936 and Colin Jackson gained a silver in 1988.\n\n111 days to go . . .\n\n111: The number of Olympic fencing medals that have been won by France, more than any other country.\n\nFencing was included at the first modern Olympics in Athens in 1896, when France's Eugene-Henri Gravelotte won the individual foil to become the first Olympic fencing champion, and has appeared at every Games since.\n\nOf France's medal total, 99 (35 gold, 35 silver, 29 bronze) have been won by men and 12 (four gold, three silver, five bronze) have been claimed by women. Italy lie in second place, having won 107 medals, and they are followed by Hungary (81 medals) and the Soviet Union (54).\n\nGreat Britain have won a total of nine fencing medals - one gold and eight silver. The only Briton to claim gold is Gillian Sheen, who lifted the women's individual foil title at the 1956 Melbourne Games.\n\n112 days to go . . .\n\n112: The number of Olympic athletics medals that have been won by Finland, the fourth highest total of any country. Only the USA (717 medals), the Soviet Union (214) and Great Britain (186) have won more.\n\nOf Finland's overall haul, 109 medals (47 gold, 33 silver, 29 bronze) have been won by men while only three (one gold, two silver) have been won by women. The most celebrated of all the Flying Finns is distance runner Paavo Nurmi, who harvested a total of 12 medals (nine gold and three silver) from 1920 to 1928 at distances ranging from 1,500m to 10,000m.\n\nHis tally of five golds in Paris in 1924 is an athletics record for a single Games. Ville Ritola, Nurmi's team-mate, won a record six medals (four gold and two silver) in 1924, running eight different distances in the space of eight days.\n\n113 days to go . . .\n\n113: The global torch relay, which is also due to visit a total of 21 cities outside China, has had a troubled start, with pro-Tibet protests in London, Paris and San Francisco gaining worldwide headlines.\n\nInappropriately dubbed the \"journey of harmony\", the relay, which has already passed through Beijing, will return to China on May 4 for a three-month tour of the country before returning to the Chinese capital on August 6.\n\nXi Jinping, the Chinese vice-president, said: \"The torch relay will bring together the strength of the whole nation in making every effort to stage a unique and well-run Olympic Games, and promote national development, social progress and people's well-being.\"\n\n114 days to go . . .\n\n114: The aggregate number of gold medals that have been won by Japan at the Summer Olympics. Japan, who have competed at 19 different Games (they did not participate until 1912, were not invited in 1948 and joined the anti-Soviet Union boycott in 1980), have a biggest gold-medal haul at a single Games of 16.\n\nIt is a feat they have managed on two occasions: in 1964, when Tokyo was the host city, and four years ago in Athens, where their overall medal tally of 37 (16 gold, nine silver, 12 bronze) was their highest yet.\n\nJapan won their first Olympic gold medal in Amsterdam in 1928 and have claimed at least one gold medal at every subsequent Games in which they have competed. After winning a solitary gold at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, they have since won three or more golds at every Games (apart from, of course, 1980).\n\n115 days to go . . .\n\n115: The number of International Olympic Committee members who were permitted to vote in a secret electronic ballot in Singapore in July 2005 to decide which city among London, Paris, Madrid, New York and Moscow would win the right to host the 2012 Games.\n\nMoscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and then Madrid, though an alleged voting error by one IOC member possibly cost the Spanish capital the chance to emerge victorious. Amid almost unbearable tension, London beat Paris by 54 votes to 50 in the final ballot and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThere are currently 110 IOC members as well as 26 honorary members, two \"honour\" members (including Henry Kissinger, the former American politician) and one honorary president for life (Juan Antonio Samaranch).\n\n116 days to go . . .\n\n116: The number of gold medals that were won at the Los Angeles Olympics of 1932.\n\nThe United States of America, the host nation, topped the table with 41 gold medals and they were followed by Italy (12 golds), France (10), Sweden (nine), Japan (seven) and Hungary (six).\n\nGreat Britain claimed four gold medals. Thomas Hampson won the 800m and Thomas Green the 50 km walk while there were also victories for the coxless pairs and coxless fours in men's rowing.\n\nThe indubitable track and field star of the Games was Mildred \"Babe\" Didrikson, an American athlete who would become one of the outstanding women go"
