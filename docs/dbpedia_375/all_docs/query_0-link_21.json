        "text": "A management system for accidental water pollution risk in a harbour: The Barcelona case study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrifoll, Manel; JordÃ , Gabriel; Espino, Manuel; Romo, Javier; GarcÃ­a-Sotillo, Marcos\n\n2011-10-01\n\nWater quality degradation in harbour domains can have an important negative impact from an economic, touristic and environmental point of view. In that sense, water quality management is becoming a main concern for harbour managers. In this paper, we present the research behind the initiative started in Spanish harbours to control water quality degradation due to accidental pollution. This management system is already operationally running in the Barcelona harbour (NW Mediterranean Sea). The system is based on a recent published risk assessment, which takes into account not only the different activities in the harbour and their inherent risk of accident but also the physical behaviour of harbour waters. In this methodology, a key element is to get hydrodynamic forecasts. Thus, the system is composed of a hierarchy of nested hydrodynamic models covering from the basin scale to the harbour scale and a module that computes the different parameters needed for risk assessment. Special emphasis is made on describing the steps followed for system implementation because such implementation is far from a mere technical problem. The first step is to identify the main forcing factors for the harbour hydrodynamics from both field data and numerical experiments, which has never been done before for the Barcelona harbour. Wind and shelf currents are suggested as the main forcing factors for the harbour circulation. The second step is to identify the requirements that a numerical model must fulfil in order to properly solve the Barcelona harbour's hydrodynamics. A high resolution (< 50 m) three dimensional model able to prognostically calculate temperature and salinity evolution; full air-sea coupling is needed as well. The third step is to investigate the best operational strategy. We have found that small errors in the initial density profiles are acceptable for surface current forecasts but not for deep circulation. A cold start must be avoided and a 72 h spin-up is\n\n[Confirmed Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika Cases during the Period 2014 to 2016 in Barcelona, Spain].\n\nPubMed\n\nGonzÃ¡lez, Roser; CamprubÃ­, Esteve; FernÃ¡ndez, Lidia; Millet, Joan Pau; Peracho, VÃ­ctor; Gorrindo, Pilar; AvellanÃ©s, Ingrid; Romero, Arancha; CaylÃ , Joan A\n\n2017-03-07\n\nArbovirus infections are a group of diseases whose incidence is increasing and that entail an important problem for public health. The aim of this study was to describe detected cases of arbovirosis in Barcelona, and surveillance and control actions performed in order to reduce the risk of transmission. Descriptive cross-sectional study of confirmed dengue, chikungunya and Zika cases in Barcelona during 2014-2016 (1st trimester). Suspected cases detected in the city were notified to the Epidemiology Department of the Barcelona Public Health Agency, where an epidemiological survey is undertaken and, if appropriate, Urban Pests Surveillance and Control Department is contacted. They perform an entomological inspection and implement control and monitoring actions. We collected sociodemographical, epidemiological, clinical and entomological variables. In 2014, 50 chikungunya and 20 dengue cases were detected; 25 entomological inspections were carried out in residences and 38 in the street. In 2015, 47 chikungunya, 51 dengue and 2 Zika cases were detected; 27 inspections were carried out in residences and 80 in the street. In 2016, 17 chikungunya, 52 dengue and 48 Zika cases were detected; 50 inspections were carried out in residences and 103 in the street. No autochtonous case was detected. We observed an increasing incidence of arbovirosis cases during the 3-year study period. There was a progressive intensification of vector surveillance and control actions (inspections, sample collectionâ¦).\n\nPhysical Activity Promotion in General Practices of Barcelona: A Case Study\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPuig Ribera, Anna; McKenna, Jim; Riddoch, Chris\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis case study aimed to generate explanations for the lack of integration of physical activity (PA) promotion in general practices of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.

Some 49% of them were diagnosed and reported in 2011, mainly in men who have sex with men. Almost half of them, 32 cases, were reported between July and September. This cluster represents the largest since 2004. This article presents the ongoing outbreak of LGV in Barcelona.\n\nCandidemia in neonatal intensive care units: Barcelona, Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodriguez, Dolors; Almirante, Benito; Park, Benjamin J; Cuenca-Estrella, Manuel; Planes, Ana M; Sanchez, Ferran; Gene, Amadeu; Xercavins, Mariona; Fontanals, Dionisia; Rodriguez-Tudela, Juan L; Warnock, David W; Pahissa, Albert\n\n2006-03-01\n\nCandida spp. are increasingly important hospital-acquired pathogens in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and cause considerable mortality in preterm infants. Most studies have been limited to a single institution. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology of candidemia in all Barcelona NICUs. We conducted prospective population-based surveillance for candidemia in Barcelona, Spain, during 2002-2003. This report focuses on the results from 5 participating hospitals with NICUs. We detected 24 cases, resulting in an annual incidence of 32.6 cases per 100,000 live births and 1.1 cases per 100 NICU discharges. Median gestational age was 27.5 weeks (range, 24-40.5), and there were 21 cases among very low birth weight infants. Among the 20 (83%) cases evaluated for the presence of end organ infection, endophthalmitis occurred in 2 cases, and endocarditis, meningitis and peritonitis occurred in 1 case each. Candida parapsilosis was the most frequent species isolated (67%). All isolates were fluconazole-susceptible. Crude mortality was 21%. The preponderance of C. parapsilosis candidemias observed in Barcelona NICUs is similar to reports from the literature. Morbidity and mortality associated with neonatal candidemia remain high.\n\nQuality Assessment for Placement Centres: A Case Study of the University of Barcelona's Faculty of Education\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFreixa Niella, Montse; VilÃ BaÃ±os, Ruth; Rubio Hurtado, M.

The objective of this study is to compare cost differences of temporary sickness absence between Barcelona and Madrid. A study was carried out based on incident cases of temporary sickness absence of more than fifteen days of duration, followed to case closure, in a retrospective cohort of workers in 2006. The study population consisted of workers of companies covered by the general regime of the Social Security System, and managed by an insurance company based in the provinces of Barcelona and Madrid in the year 2006. We compared the incidence, median duration and daily income base between Barcelona and Madrid, adjusting by sex, age and economic sector, using statistical models that take into account recurrent events in the period. 24.527 cases of temporary sickness absence were identified, 62% of which originated in Barcelona. The mean cost was 33% higher in Barcelona with respect to Madrid (2.589 euros vs 1941 euros). The incidence was 22% higher in Barcelona than Madrid (1,22, IC95%: 1,10-1,36) and mean daily income base per episode was 7,80 euros higher (IC95% :7,20-8,40). In the duration the time ratio was: 1,03 ( IC95%: 1,01-1,05). The higher incidence and daily income base of temporary sickness absence in Barcelona with respect to Madrid may explain the higher costs observed in the former.\n\nThe water reclamation and reuse project of El Prat de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nMujeriego, R; Compte, J; Cazurra, T; GullÃ³n, M\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWater reclamation and reuse have become essential components of water resources management in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, by helping to develop additional water resources in the lower Llobregat River, one of its main sources of water supply. By generating a reliable flow of 300,000 m3/day of high quality reclaimed water, the options available for integrated water resources management have widely expanded to allow in-stream river water substitution, restoration of natural wetland areas, agricultural irrigation, and supply to a seawater intrusion barrier. Those management options have been possible thanks to the implementation of an extensive water distribution system that allows distribution of reclaimed water to a point 15 km upstream of the reclamation facility, and to a seawater intrusion barrier within a few kilometres of the plant. The cost of producing reclaimed water using a physico-chemical process (0.05 euro/m3) and the investment required for such a facility (0.21 euro/m3 annual capacity) are very close to those of similar large scale projects in Spain. However, higher degrees of treatment, such as demineralization for agricultural irrigation and for injection into a seawater intrusion barrier, result in considerable increases of both water reclamation cost and investment costs.\n\n[A prospective study of drug-facilitated sexual assault in Barcelona].\n\nPubMed\n\nXifrÃ³-Collsamata, Alexandre; Pujol-Robinat, Amadeo; BarberÃ­a-Marcalain, Eneko; Arroyo-FernÃ¡ndez, Amparo; Bertomeu-Ruiz, Antonia; Montero-NÃºÃ±ez, Francisco; Medallo-MuÃ±iz, Jordi\n\n2015-05-08\n\nTo determine the frequency and characteristics of suspected drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) among the victims of sexual assault in Barcelona. Prospective study of every adult consulting an emergency service because of alleged sexual assault and receiving forensic assessment in the city of Barcelona in 2011. A total of 35 of 114 cases (30.7%) met suspected DFSA criteria. Compared with the other victims, suspected DFSA cases were more likely to experience amnesia, to have been assaulted by night, after a social situation and by a recently acquainted man, to have used alcohol before the assault and to be foreigners. In this group ethanol was detected in blood or urine in 48.4% of analyzed cases; their mean back calculated blood alcohol concentration was 2.29g/l (SD 0.685). Also, at least one central nervous system drug other than ethanol was detected in 60,6%, mainly stimulant drugs of abuse. Suspected DFSA is frequent among victims of alleged sexual assault in Barcelona nowadays. The depressor substance most commonly encountered is alcohol, which contributes to victims' vulnerability.

A case study: Barcelona.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJurado, A.; Mastroianni, N.; Vazquez-SuÃ±e, E.; Carrera, J.; Tubau, I.; Pujades, E.; Postigo, C.; Lopez de Alda, M.; BarcelÃ³, D.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThis study is concerned with drugs of abuse (DAs) and their metabolites in urban groundwater at field scale in relation to (1) the spatial distribution of the groundwater samples, (2) the depth of the groundwater sample, (3) the presence of DAs in recharge sources, and (4) the identification of processes affecting the fate of DAs in groundwater. To this end, urban groundwater samples were collected in the city of Barcelona and a total of 21 drugs were analyzed including cocainics, amphetamine-like compounds, opioids, lysergics and cannabinoids and the prescribed drugs benzodiazepines. Overall, the highest groundwater concentrations and the largest number of detected DAs were found in zones basically recharged by a river that receives large amounts of effluents from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). In contrast, the urbanized areas yielded not only lower concentrations but also a much smaller number of drugs, which suggests a local origin. In fact, cocaine and its metabolite were dominant in more prosperous neighbourhoods, whereas the cheaper (MDMA) was the dominant DA in poorer districts. Concentrations of DAs estimated mainly from the waste water fraction in groundwater samples were consistently higher than the measured ones, suggesting that DAs undergo removal processes in both reducing and oxidizing conditions.\n\nPublic Space in Barcelona (1992-2017) - Evolution and Case Studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSanfeliu Arboix, Ignacio; MartÃ­n, EstefanÃ­a\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe construction of the public space has become in the last decades something so important and fundamental in the architecture of the cities, that requires a specific discipline and a concrete study that evaluates the characteristics and actions on it. Not already from an urbanistic perspective but from its own design and constructive perspective, with its character as a place for everyone and for everything, must gather a series of elements that are unique to this space. Barcelona is one of the densest cities in the world that, since the end of the s. XX until our days, tries to solve the public space with a design of quality and optimum. The shortage of public space, which also hosts more than eight million tourists each year, makes it necessary to propose a type of meticulous intervention in order to accommodate all types of users and activities. From the first Universal Exhibition of 1888 through 1929 to the 1992 Olympics as the most important stimulus for this renewal of urban space, Barcelona has been rethinking and evolving in the modus operandi in terms of its urban space. From our professional experience as architects both in the municipal, private and university spheres, we believe that it is our responsibility to confer the public space, that is to say, the design of the urban infrastructure with the attributes necessary to consolidate it in a space Suitable for all without exception and as a place of expression of citizenship. Through the projects of public space developed in our office we will analyze this change of procedure in the construction of squares, parks and other spaces in the city of Barcelona.\n\nMethodology for the Detection of Residential Vulnerable Areas - the Case of Barcelona\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCornado, Cossima; Garcia-Almirall, Pilar; Vima, Sara; Vila Busqued, Gemma; Uzqueda, Angel\n\n2017-10-01\n\nIn a context of a shifting environmental, economic and social paradigm, European cities face a situation that is at the same time challenge and opportunity: the need for urban rehabilitation of the vulnerable degraded socio residential fabric. Public administrations in big cities and metropolitan areas are confronted with both the undercurrent need of actualization of the built stock and the rise of urban residential vulnerability. The city of Barcelona, as many others, is the result of multiple phenomena with high urban and social consequences. The socio spatial integration of immigrant population, the touristic rise and gentrification processes are current situations simultaneously taking place in the city. In parallel, a framework of economic crisis in which public investments in urban and social matters decrease, provides a temporal juncture that results into an increase of social polarization and socio economic inequality that becomes evident and expressed in the territory. This research focuses in the case of Barcelona, and presents a methodology based on a system of indicators elaborated through the exploitation of statistical data complemented with very specific data supplied by the Barcelona City Council. The accurate knowledge of socio demographic, socioeconomic and residential and urban characteristics is crucial in order to define the very complex urban dynamics that describe in the city neighbourhoods and areas. Residential vulnerability is defined as an assembly of objective conditions that relate to residential space and indicate situations of social discrimination and structural disadvantage of the population, related to a specific time and context. Thus, it is relevant to analyse the concentration of certain indicators of vulnerability in specific places or neighbourhoods, to contrast its effect on the socio-residential situation and its temporal evolution in order to identify tendencies. The present study contributes to the identification of data\n\nAn approach of groundwater management in Barcelona City\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCriollo, Rotman; VÃ¡zquez-SuÃ±Ã©, Enric; Velasco, Violeta; Marazuela, Miguel Angel; Burdons, Silvia; Enrich, Monica; Cardona, Fidel\n\n2017-04-01\n\nUrban groundwater is a valuable resource since its quantity is larger than frequently expected due to additional recharge sources (Lerner, 2002; VÃ¡zquez-SuÃ±Ã© et al., 2003). Its interaction with the complex infrastructures network makes the water authorities a challenge to ensure a proper water management. Necessary datasets to ensure a suitable water management have normally different origins and formats. At the same time, the water management of a city involves different decision makers with different knowledges. In this scenario, it is a necessity to create a common environment where different actors would be able to understand and analyze problems in the same way. It should be also necessary to store, analyze and visualize all the required data in the same formats within its geographical context by using standardized specific tools. To apply these recommendations for the urban groundwater management of the Barcelona City Council, we have implemented a software platform developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. These GIS-based tools will give support to the users for storing, managing, and analyzing geological, hydrogeological and hydrochemical data in 2D and in a 3D context (Velasco et al., 2013). This implementation will improve the groundwater management in Barcelona city optimizing the analysis and decision making processes. References Lerner, D.N., (2002).

DESIGN--Mortality data for 1983-89 and socioeconomic data for each of the 38 neighbourhoods of Barcelona were used. Mortality indicators used were the comparative mortality figure, the ratio of potential years of life lost, and life expectancy at birth. Socioeconomic indicators were the percentage of unemployed, the percentage of illiteracy, monthly telephone usage, the average power and age of cars, and the average rateable value of buildings and of land. The statistical correlation between socioeconomic indicators and mortality indicators was studied by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. SETTING--The 38 neighbourhoods of Barcelona, Spain. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--The comparative mortality figure ranged from 87.41-152.43 and the ratio of potential years of life lost from 74.94-237.31 in both sexes. Both the absolute difference and the ratio of the value for the neighbourhood with lowest mortality and that with highest mortality were larger when premature mortality was examined. Life expectancy at birth ranged from 64.77-75.32 years in men and 75.04-81.51 in women. All correlations between mortality and socioeconomic indicators were high and statistically significant: the higher the unemployment and illiteracy levels and the older the cars, the greater the comparative mortality figure and ratio of potential years of life lost, and the lower the life expectancy (negative correlations). Conversely, the higher the telephone use, the more powerful the cars, and the greater the rateable value, the lower the mortality (negative correlations) and the greater the life expectancy. These correlations were greater in males than in females. The highest correlations were with illiteracy.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a pilot HIV partner notification program. Methods HIV cases diagnosed between January 2012 and June 2013 at two healthcare settings in Barcelona were invited to participate in a prospective survey. We identified process and outcome measures to evaluate this partner notification program, including the number of partners identified per interviewed index case, the proportion of partners tested for HIV as a result of the partner notification, and the proportion of new HIV diagnoses among their sex or needle-sharing partners. Results Of the 125 index cases contacted, 108 (86.4%) agreed to provide information about partners. A total of 199 sexual partners were identified (1.8 partners per interviewed index case). HIV outcome was already known for 58 partners (70.7% were known to be HIV-positive), 141 partners were tested as result of partner notification, and 26 were newly diagnosed with HIV. The case-finding effectiveness of the program was 18.4%. Conclusion This pilot program provides evidence of the effectiveness of a partner notification program implemented in healthcare settings. This active partner notification program was feasible, acceptable to the user, and identified a high proportion of HIV-infected patients previously unaware of their status.

At Barcelona harbour there is a MIROS radar tide gauge belonging to Puertos del Estado (Spanish Harbours).The radar sensor is over the water surface, on a L-shaped structure which elevates it a few meters above the quay shelf. 1-min data are transmitted to the ENAGAS Control Center by cable and then sent each 1 min to Puertos del Estado by e-mail. The information includes wave forescast (mean period, significant wave height, sea level, etc.This sensor also measures agitation and sends wave parameters each 20 min. There is a GPS station Leica Geosystems GRX1200 GG Pro and antenna AX 1202 GG. The Control Tower of the Port of Barcelona is situated in the North dike of the so-called Energy Pier in the Barcelona harbor (Spain). This tower has different kind of antennas for navigation monitoring and a GNSS permanent station. As the tower is founded in reclaimed land, and because its metallic structure, the 50 m building is subjected to diverse movements, including periodic fluctuations due to temperature changes. In this contribution the 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 the necessary monitoring campaigns are described. In the framework of a Spanish Space Project, the instrumentation of sea level measurements has been improved by providing the Barcelona site with a radar tide gauge Datamar 2000C from Geonica S.L. in June 2014 near an acoustic tide gauge from the Barcelona Harbour installed in 2013. Precision levelling has been made several times in the last two years because the tower is founded in reclaimed land and\n\n[Lymphogranuloma venereum: an emerging cause of proctitis in homosexual men in Barcelona].\n\nPubMed\n\nVall-Mayans, M; Caballero, E\n\n2009-02-01\n\nLymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a systemic sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L. Since 2003, outbreaks of LGV have been reported in homosexual men in Europe. The objective of this study is to describe an outbreak of LGV in Barcelona in 2007. Description of a clinical case series of confirmed LGV diagnosed in the STI clinic of Barcelona between September 2007 and January 2008. Seven cases have been confirmed up to January 31, 2008. All were homosexual men, with a mean age of 36, who were sexually promiscuous. Mean time of symptoms of proctitis was 28 days. All the patients were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for an average period of 5 years. This outbreak is similar to other LGV outbreaks that are occurring in Europe. LGV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of proctitis in homosexual men and be treated with 100 mg of doxycycline/12 hours for three weeks. Preventive interventions directed at HIV infected persons are important.\n\nEpidemiology of imported malaria among children and young adults in Barcelona (1990-2008)\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Increasing international travel and migration is producing changes in trends in infectious diseases, especially in children from many European cities. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology and determine the trends of imported malaria in patients under 20 years old in the city of Barcelona, Spain, during an 18-year period. Methods The study included malaria cases that were laboratory confirmed and reported to the malaria register at the Public Health Agency of Barcelona from 1990 to 2008, residing in Barcelona and less than 20 years old. Patients were classified as natives (born in Spain) or immigrants. Differences in the distribution of demographic, clinical characteristics, and incidence per 100,000 person-year evolution were analysed. Natives and immigrants were compared by logistic regression by calculating the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and Chi-square for a linear trend (p < 0.05). Results Of the total 174 cases, 143 (82.1%) were immigrants, 100 (57.5%) were female, 121 (69.5%) Plasmodium falciparum, and 108 (62.1%) were visiting friends and relatives (VFR) as the reason for travel. Among the immigrants, 99 (67.8%) were from Equatorial Guinea. Immigrant cases more frequently travelled to Africa than natives (p = 0.02). The factors associated with imported malaria among immigrant residents was travelling for VFR (OR: 6.2 CI 1.9-20.2) and age 15-19 (OR: 3.7 CI 1-13.3). The incidence increased from 1990 to 1999 (p < 0.001) and decreased from 2000 to 2008 (p = 0.01), although the global linear trend was not statistically significant (p = 0.41). The fatality rate was 0.5%. Conclusions The majority of cases of malaria in population less than 20 years in Barcelona were immigrants, travelling to Africa for VFR and Plasmodium falciparum was most frequently detected. The trend analysis of the entire study period did not show a statistically significant decline.

Our specific research questions are: (1) What are the spatiotemporal changes in urban built-up land and green space in Barcelona and Shanghai? (2) What are the relationships between economic development, exemplified by post-industrialization, globalization, and urban green space? Urban land use and green space change were evaluated using data derived from a variety of sources, including satellite images, landscape matrix indicators, and a land conversion matrix. The relationships between economic development, globalization, and environmental quality were analyzed through partial least squares structural equation modeling based on secondary statistical data. Both Barcelona and Shanghai have undergone rapid urbanization, with urban expansion in Barcelona beginning in the 1960s-1970s and in Shanghai in the last decade. While Barcelona's urban green space and green space per capita began declining between the 1950s and 1990s, they increased slightly over the past two decades. Shanghai, however, has consistently and significantly improved urban green space and green space per capita over the past six decades, especially since the economic reform in 1978. Economic development has a direct and significant influence on urban green space for both cities and post-industrialization had served as the main driving force for urban landscape change in Barcelona and Shanghai. Based on secondary statistical and qualitative data from on-site observations and interviews with local experts, we highlighted the institution's role in NBS planning. Furthermore, aspiration to become a global or globalizing city motivated both cities to use NBS planning as a place-making tool to attract global investment, which is reflected in various governing policies and regulations.

During the period of 2003-2004, a prospective cross-sectional study was carried out in 1,305 children (9% immigrant population) between the ages 3 and 15 in 17 schools in Barcelona. A systematic examination of the feet, (including nails and scalp), was performed to identify lesions compatible with tinea. Cultures of scalp and feet samples were done and analysis of environmental samples was performed for dermatophyte isolation. Dermatophytes were isolated in 2.9% of the samples with a prevalence of 2.5% in feet, 0.23% in scalp, and 0.15% in nails of the feet. The predominant etiologic agents in feet were Trichophyton mentagrophytes in 45.7% of the cases and Trichophyton rubrum in 31.4%. In the nails, T. rubrum and Trichophyton tonsurans were isolated, while T. mentagrophytes (2 cases) and Trichophyton violaceum (1 case) were identified in scalp samples. Forty-five per cent of dermatophytes were isolated from healthy feet, the majority of cases in children 13- 15-years-old (p < 0.05). Microsporum gypseum was the only agent identified in the environmental samples, and was also found in one of the cases of tinea pedis. The results of this study demonstrate a low prevalence of tinea capitis and tinea unguium in school children of Barcelona. On the contrary, high prevalence of dermatophytes in feet was found. It highlights the high prevalence of healthy carriers of dermatophytes in feet.\n\nField Evidence of Social Influence in the Expression of Political Preferences: The Case of Secessionists Flags in Barcelona\n\nPubMed Central\n\nParravano, Antonio; Noguera, JosÃ© A.; Hermida, Paula; Tena-SÃ¡nchez, Jordi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nModels of social influence have explored the dynamics of social contagion, imitation, and diffusion of different types of traits, opinions, and conducts. However, few behavioral data indicating social influence dynamics have been obtained from direct observation in ânaturalâ social contexts. The present research provides that kind of evidence in the case of the public expression of political preferences in the city of Barcelona, where thousands of citizens supporting the secession of Catalonia from Spain have placed a Catalan flag in their balconies and windows. Here we present two different studies. 1) During July 2013 we registered the number of flags in 26% of the electoral districts in the city of Barcelona. We find that there is a large dispersion in the density of flags in districts with similar density of pro-independence voters. However, by comparing the moving average to the global mean we find that the density of flags tends to be fostered in electoral districts where there is a clear majority of pro-independence vote, while it is inhibited in the opposite cases. We also show that the distribution of flags in the observed districts deviates significantly from that of an equivalent random distribution. 2) During 17 days around Cataloniaâs 2013 national holiday we observed the position at balcony resolution of the flags displayed in the facades of a sub-sample of 82 blocks. We compare the âclustering indexâ of flags on the facades observed each day to thousands of equivalent random distributions. Again we provide evidence that successive hangings of flags are not independent events but that a local influence mechanism is favoring their clustering. We also find that except for the national holiday day the density of flags tends to be fostered in facades located in electoral districts where there is a clear majority of pro-independence vote.

The present paper develops the Catalan version of the language subtests of the Barcelona Test (PeÃ±a-Casanova,1986) the original version of which was published in Spanish. To reach the Catalan version of the test it has been necessary to analyse the psycholinguistic variables of every item to then establish linguistically equivalent correlations. There are some subtests for which no modifications have been needed. Nevertheless, and because of some psycholinguistic features of Catalan (Catalan's spelling is not completely free of ambiguity) some subtests have suffered substantial modifications. The following paper presents the justification of every modification based on the features of the Catalan language and also based on the original goals of the test. An appendix contains the final version of the Catalan adaptation for the language subtests of the Barcelona Test. The present paper represents an advance in the assessment of neurological patients with language disfunctions. It will permit an appropiate assessment for the Spanish-Catalan bilingual patients.\n\nEpidemiology of infections by HIV, Syphilis, Gonorrhea and Lymphogranuloma Venereum in Barcelona City: a population-based incidence study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­-Pastor, Marc; GarcÃ­a de Olalla, Patricia; BarberÃ¡, Maria-JesÃºs; Manzardo, Christian; OcaÃ±a, Inma; Knobel, Hernando; GurguÃ­, MercÃ¨; Humet, Victoria; Vall, MartÃ­; Ribera, Esteban; Villar, Judit; MartÃ­n, Gemma; Sambeat, Maria A; Marco, Andres; Vives, Alvaro; Alsina, MercÃ¨; MirÃ³, Josep M; CaylÃ , Joan A\n\n2015-10-05\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the evolution of HIV infection, gonorrhea, syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and their epidemiological characteristics in Barcelona city. Population-based incidence study of all newly occurring diagnoses of HIV infection, syphilis, gonorrhea and LGV detected in Barcelona between January 2007 and December 2011. A descriptive analysis was performed. The annual incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants were calculated by sex, sexual conduct and educational level. To estimate global sex-specific rates we used the Barcelona city census; for the calculation of rates by sexual conduct and educational level we used estimates of the Barcelona Health Interview Survey. Trends were analysed using the chi-squared test for linear trend. HIV. 66.8 % of the HIV cases were men who had sex with men (MSM). The incidence rates in MSM over the study period were from 692.67/100,000 to 909.88/100,000 inh. Syphilis. 74.2 % of the syphilis cases were MSM. The incidence rates in MSM were from 224.9/100,000 to 891.97/100,000 inh. and the MSM with a university education ranged from 196.3/100,000 to 1020.8/100,000. Gonorrhea. 45.5 % of the gonorrhea cases were MSM. The incidence rates in MSM were from 164.24/100,000 to 404.79/100,000 inh. and the MSM with university education ranged from 176.7/100,000 to 530.1/100,000 inh.. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). 95.3 % of the LGV cases are MSM. The incidence rates in MSM were from 24.99/100,000 to 282.99/100,000 inh. and the MSM with university education ranged from 9.3/100,000 to 265/100,000 inh. An increase in cases of STI was observed. These STI mainly affected MSM with a university education. Continuing to monitor changes in the epidemiology of STI, and identifying the most affected groups should permit redesigning preventive programs, with the goal of finding the most efficient way to reach these population groups.\n\nBarcelona conference on epigenetics and cancer 2016 â beyond cancer genomes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDumbovic, Gabrijela; Biayna, Josep; Font, Berta; Buschbeck, Marcus; Forcales, Sonia-V.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT The Barcelona Conference on Epigenetics and Cancer (BCEC) entitled âBeyond Cancer Genomesâ took place October 13th and 14th 2016 in Barcelona. The 2016 BCEC was the fourth edition of a series of annual conferences coordinated by Marcus Buschbeck and subsequently organized by leading research centers in Barcelona together with Bâ¢DEBATE, a joint initiative of BIOCAT and âLa Caixaâ Foundation. Salvador Aznar-Benitah, Eduard Batlle, and RaÃºl MÃ©ndez from the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Barcelona selected the 2016 BCEC panel of speakers. As the title indicates, this year's conference expanded the epigenetic focus to include additional cancer-relevant topics, such as tumor heterogeneity and RNA regulation. Methods to develop therapeutic approaches on the basis of novel insights have been discussed in great detail. The conference has attracted 217 participants from 11 countries.

The case of Barcelona, Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaynou, Laia; Saez, Marc; Lopez-Casasnovas, Guillem\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThere is considerable evidence demonstrating socioeconomic inequalities in mortality, some of which focuses on intraurban inequalities. However, all the studies assume that the spatial variation of inequalities is stable over the time. We challenge this assumption and propose two hypotheses: (i) have spatial variations in socioeconomic inequalities in mortality at an intraurban level changed over time? and (ii) as a result of the economic crisis, has the gap between such disparities widened? In this paper, our objective is to assess the effect of the economic recession on the spatio-temporal variation of socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). We used a spatio-temporal ecological design to analyse mortality inequalities at small area level in Barcelona. Mortality data and socioeconomic indicators correspond to the years 2005 and 2008-2011. We specified spatio-temporal ecological mixed regressions for both men and women using two indicators, neighbourhood and year. We allowed the coefficients of the socioeconomic variables to differ according to the levels and explicitly took into account spatio-temporal adjustment. For men and women both absolute and, above all, relative risks for mortality have increased since 2009. In relative terms, this means that the risk of dying has increased much more in the most economically deprived neighbourhoods than in the more affluent ones. Although the geographical pattern in relative risks for mortality in neighbourhoods in Barcelona remained very stable between 2005 and 2011, socioeconomic inequalities in mortality at an intraurban level have surged since 2009.

DESIGN: Mortality trends study. SETTING: The city of Barcelona (Spain). SUBJECTS: The study included all deaths among residents of the two groups of city wards. Details were obtained from death certificates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age standardised mortality rates, age standardised rates of years of potential life lost, and age specific mortality rates in relation to cause of death, sex, and year were computed as well as the comparative mortality figure and the ratio of standardised rates of years of potential life lost. RESULTS: Rates of premature mortality increased from 5691.2 years of potential life lost per 100,000 inhabitants aged 1 to 70 years in 1983 to 7606.2 in 1994 in the low socioeconomic level wards, and from 3731.2 to 4236.9 in the other wards, showing an increase in inequalities over the 12 years, mostly due to AIDS and drug overdose as causes of death. Conversely, cerebrovascular disease showed a reduction in inequality over the same period. Overall mortality in the 15-44 age group widened the gap between both groups of wards. CONCLUSION: AIDS and drug overdose are emerging as the causes of death that are contributing to a substantial increase in social inequality in terms of premature mortality, an unreported observation in European urban areas.

It is based on 633 individual whooping cough cases and the 2006 population census from the Spanish National Statistics Institute, stratified by age and sex at the census tract level. Cluster identification was attempted using space-time scan statistic assuming a Poisson distribution and restricting temporal extent to 7 days and spatial distance to 500 m. Statistical calculations were performed with Stata 11 and SatScan and mapping was performed with ArcGis 10.0. Only clusters showing statistical significance (P <0.05) were mapped. The most likely cluster identified included five census tracts located in three neighbourhoods in central Barcelona during the week from 17 to 23 August 2011. This cluster included five cases compared with the expected level of 0.0021 (relative risk = 2436, P <0.001). In addition, 11 secondary significant space-time clusters were detected with secondary clusters occurring at different times and localizations. Spatial statistics is felt to be useful by complementing epidemiological surveillance systems through visualizing excess in the number of cases in space and time and thus increase the possibility of identifying outbreaks not reported by the surveillance system.\n\nGeochemical signature and phytoremediation of urban soil: a case in Barcelona city\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRodrÃ­guez-Bocanegra, Javier; Roca, NÃºria; Febrero, Anna; Bort, Jordi\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe cleanup of contaminated places with heavy metals is necessary, but environmental remediation strategies are often expensive and energy consuming. Thus, it is important to develop low-cost and environmentally friendly strategies. Phytoremediation-based technologies could provide a long-lasting solution. The study area is located in Sants, a neighbourhood in Barcelona city (Catalonia, Spain). This place was an industrial area in the last century, which was occupied by a metal smelting industry. Nowadays, the neighbours want to cultivate vegetables in this location, but the history of this area suggests that the soil is polluted by elevated concentrations of heavy metals. The aim of this work was to determine heavy metal concentration in: a) soil, to know the degree of the soil pollution; b) roots and leaves of two plant species, Brassica juncea as an accumulator plant and Solanum lycopersicum as a crop plant, to know the capacity of each species to accumulate metals, and c) drainage water, to evaluate the heavy metal mobility. The main pollutants are Cu, Pb and Zn with topsoil total concentrations about 1355, 2230 and 6239 mgâ¢kg-1, respectively. The established background upper limits in this area in mgâ¢kg-1 were: Cu 145, Pb 91 and Zn 326. The same soil elements for available fractions, extracted with DTPA, were slightly elevated (9.6, 5.8 and 6.7 % of total concentration). The environmental pollution implies great extractability, suggesting the plants in these soils have facility with potentially toxic elements absorption. Instead, the concentrations in subsoil are lower than in topsoil. The concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn in the plants' leaves are greater in B. juncea 170 Â± 52.7, 137 Â± 46.3 and 2365 Â± 860.4 mgâ¢kg-1, than in S. lycopersicum 102.5 Â± 7.1, 22.5 Â± 1.3 and 1002 Â± 85.2 mgâ¢kg-1 respectively. Furthermore, they are also greater in roots than in leaves. All of them are lower than the threshold to be considered like a hyperaccumulator species\n\nThe Experience of Implementing Urban HEART Barcelona: a Tool for Action.\n\nPubMed\n\nNovoa, Ana M; PÃ©rez, GlÃ²ria; Espelt, Albert; Echave, Cynthia; de Olalla, Patricia G; Calvo, M JesÃºs; PasarÃ­n, Maribel; Diez, Ãlia; Borrell, Carme; Calvo, M JesÃºs; Cormenzana, Berta; CortÃ©s, Imma; Diez, Ãlia; Echave, Cynthia; Espelt, Albert; de Olalla, PatrÃ­cia G; GÃ²mez, Josep; Novoa, Ana M; PallarÃ¨s, Montserrat; PÃ©rez, GlÃ²ria; RodrÃ­guez-Sanz, Maica\n\n2017-10-16\n\nUrban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (HEART) is a tool developed by the World Health Organization whose objective is to provide evidence on urban health inequalities so as to help to decide the best interventions aimed to promote urban health equity. The aim of this paper is to describe the experience of implementing Urban HEART in Barcelona city, both the adaptation of Urban HEART to the city of Barcelona, its use as a means of identifying and monitoring health inequalities among city neighbourhoods, and the difficulties and barriers encountered throughout the process. Although ASPB public health technicians participated in the Urban HEART Advisory Group, had large experience in health inequalities analysis and research and showed interest in implementing the tool, it was not until 2015, when the city council was governed by a new left-wing party for which reducing health inequalities was a priority that Urban HEART could be used. A provisional matrix was developed, including both health and health determinant indicators, which allowed to show how some neighbourhoods in the city systematically fare worse for most of the indicators while others systematically fare better. It also allowed to identify 18 neighbourhoods-those which fared worse in most indicators-which were considered a priority for intervention, which entered the Health in the Barcelona Neighbourhoods programme and the Neighbourhoods Plan. This provisional version was reviewed and improved by the Urban HEART Barcelona Working Group. Technicians with experience in public health and/or in indicator and database management were asked to indicate suitability and relevance from a list of potential indicators. The definitive Urban HEART Barcelona version included 15 indicators from the five Urban HEART domains and improved the previous version in several requirements. Several barriers were encountered, such as having to estimate indicators in scarcely populated areas or finding adequate\n\nTrends in socioeconomic inequalities in cancer mortality in Barcelona: 1992-2003.\n\nPubMed\n\nPuigpinÃ³s, Rosa; Borrell, Carme; Antunes, JosÃ© Leopoldo Ferreira; Azlor, Enric; PasarÃ­n, M Isabel; Serral, Gemma; Pons-ViguÃ©s, Mariona; RodrÃ­guez-Sanz, Maica; FernÃ¡ndez, Esteve\n\n2009-01-23\n\nThe objective of this study was to assess trends in cancer mortality by educational level in Barcelona from 1992 to 2003.

Educational level was obtained from the municipal census. Age-standardized rates by educational level were calculated. We also fitted Poisson regression models to estimate the relative index of inequality (RII) and the Slope Index of Inequalities (SII). All were calculated for each sex and period (1992-1994, 1995-1997, 1998-2000, and 2001-2003). Cancer mortality was higher in men and women with lower educational level throughout the study period. Less-schooled men had higher mortality by stomach, mouth and pharynx, oesophagus, larynx and lung cancer. In women, there were educational inequalities for cervix uteri, liver and colon cancer. Inequalities of overall and specific types of cancer mortality remained stable in Barcelona; although a slight reduction was observed for some cancers. This study has identified those cancer types presenting the greatest inequalities between men and women in recent years and shown that in Barcelona there is a stable trend in inequalities in the burden of cancer.\n\n[Community prioritization in Barcelona Salut als Barris program].\n\nPubMed\n\nSÃ¡nchez-Ledesma, Esther; PÃ©rez, Anna; VÃ¡zquez, Noelia; GarcÃ­a-Subirats, Irene; FernÃ¡ndez, Ana; Novoa, Ana M; Daban, Ferran\n\nPrioritizing corresponds to the process of selecting and managing health needs identified after diagnosing the community's health needs and assets. Recently, the health needs assessment has been reinforced with the community perspective, providing multiple benefits: it sensitizes and empowers the community about their health, encourages mutual support among its members and promotes their importance by making them responsible for the process of improving their own reality. The objective of this paper is to describe the prioritization of Barcelona Salut als Barris, a community health strategy led by the Barcelona Public Health Agency to promote equity in health in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods of the city.

This candidacy was devised by activists involved in the Spanish 15M movement to transform citizen outrage into political change. On the one hand, the 15M movement was based on a decentralized structure. On the other hand, political science literature postulates that parties develop oligarchical leadership structures. This tension motivates to examine whether Barcelona en ComÃº preserved a decentralized structure or adopted a conventional centralized organization. In this study we develop a computational methodology to characterize the online network organization of every party in the election campaign on Twitter. Results on the network of retweets reveal that, while traditional parties are organized in a single cluster, for Barcelona en ComÃº two well-defined groups co-exist: a centralized cluster led by the candidate and party accounts, and a decentralized cluster with the movement activists. Furthermore, results on the network of replies also shows a dual structure: a cluster around the candidate receiving the largest attention from other parties, and another with the movement activists exhibiting a higher predisposition to dialogue with other parties.\n\nTraffic-related air pollution and congenital anomalies in Barcelona.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchembari, Anna; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark J; Salvador, Joaquin; de Nazelle, Audrey; Cirach, Marta; Dadvand, Payam; Beelen, Rob; Hoek, Gerard; BasagaÃ±a, Xavier; Vrijheid, Martine\n\n2014-03-01\n\nA recent meta-analysis suggested evidence for an effect of exposure to ambient air pollutants on risk of certain congenital heart defects. However, few studies have investigated the effects of traffic-related air pollutants with sufficient spatial accuracy. We estimated associations between congenital anomalies and exposure to traffic-related air pollution in Barcelona, Spain. Cases with nonchromosomal anomalies (n = 2,247) and controls (n = 2,991) were selected from the Barcelona congenital anomaly register during 1994-2006. Land use regression models from the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE), were applied to residential addresses at birth to estimate spatial exposure to nitrogen oxides and dioxide (NOx, NO2), particulate matter with diameter â¤ 10 Î¼m (PM10), 10-2.5 Î¼m (PMcoarse), â¤ 2.5 Î¼m (PM2.5), and PM2.5 absorbance. Spatial estimates were adjusted for temporal trends using data from routine monitoring stations for weeks 3-8 of each pregnancy. Logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for 18 congenital anomaly groups associated with an interquartile-range (IQR) increase in exposure estimates. In spatial and spatiotemporal exposure models, we estimated statistically significant associations between an IQR increase in NO2 (12.2 Î¼g/m3) and coarctation of the aorta (ORspatiotemporal = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.31) and digestive system defects (ORspatiotemporal = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.23), and between an IQR increase in PMcoarse (3.6 Î¼g/m3) and abdominal wall defects (ORspatiotemporal = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.37, 2.73). Other statistically significant increased and decreased ORs were estimated based on the spatial model only or the spatiotemporal model only, but not both. Our results overall do not indicate an association between traffic-related air pollution and most groups of congenital anomalies. Findings for coarctation of the aorta are consistent with those of the previous meta-analysis.

Methods The study population comprised Barcelona inhabitants aged 20 years or older. Data on cancer deaths were supplied by the system of information on mortality. Educational level was obtained from the municipal census. Age-standardized rates by educational level were calculated. We also fitted Poisson regression models to estimate the relative index of inequality (RII) and the Slope Index of Inequalities (SII). All were calculated for each sex and period (1992â1994, 1995â1997, 1998â2000, and 2001â2003). Results Cancer mortality was higher in men and women with lower educational level throughout the study period. Less-schooled men had higher mortality by stomach, mouth and pharynx, oesophagus, larynx and lung cancer. In women, there were educational inequalities for cervix uteri, liver and colon cancer. Inequalities of overall and specific types of cancer mortality remained stable in Barcelona; although a slight reduction was observed for some cancers. Conclusion This study has identified those cancer types presenting the greatest inequalities between men and women in recent years and shown that in Barcelona there is a stable trend in inequalities in the burden of cancer.

However, the lack of sufficient studies about injury pattern in motorbikes-pedestrian collisions leads to a lack of optimization design of these vehicles. The objective of this research is to study the injury pattern of pedestrians involved in collisions with motorized two-wheeled vehicles. A retrospective descriptive study of pedestrian's deaths after collisions with motorcycles in an urban area, like Barcelona was performed. The cases were collected from the Forensic Pathology Service database of the Institute of Legal Medicine of Catalonia. The selected cases were categorized as pedestrian-motorcycle collision, between January 1st, 2005 and December 31st, 2014. Data were collected from the autopsy, medical, and police report. The collected information was then analyzed using Microsoft Excel statistical functions. Traumatic Brain Injury is the main cause of death in pedestrian hit by motorized two-wheeled vehicles (62.85%). The most frequent injury was the subarachnoid hemorrhage, in 71.4% of cases, followed by cerebral contusions and skull base fractures (65.7%). By contrast, pelvic fractures and tibia fractures only appeared in 28.6%. The study characterizes the injury pattern of pedestrians involved in a collision with motorized two-wheeled vehicles in an urban area, like Barcelona, which has been found to be different from other vehicle-pedestrian collisions, with a higher incidence of brain injuries and minor frequency of lower extremities fractures in pelvis, tibia and fibula.

Although a few studies exist on the effects of species and sources in U.S. cities, European cities-which have a higher proportion of diesel engines and denser urban populations-have not been well characterized. Information on the effects of specific sources could aid in targeting pollution control and in articulating the biological mechanisms of PM. Our study examined the effects of various PM sources on daily mortality for 2003 through 2007 in Barcelona, a densely populated city in the northeast corner of Spain. Source apportionment for PM â¤ 2.5 Î¼m and â¤ 10 Âµm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5 and PM10) using positive matrix factorization identified eight different factors. Case-crossover regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of each factor. Several sources of PM2.5, including vehicle exhaust, fuel oil combustion, secondary nitrate/organics, minerals, secondary sulfate/organics, and road dust, had statistically significant associations (p < 0.05) with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Also, in some cases relative risks for a respective interquartile range increase in concentration were higher for specific sources than for total PM2.5 mass. These results along with those from our multisource models suggest that traffic, sulfate from shipping and long-range transport, and construction dust are important contributors to the adverse health effects linked to PM.\n\nService-Learning in Physical Education Teacher Training.

We examined the microbiological composition and abundance in space and time of bioaerosols collected in the Barcelona subway system during a cold period. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify total bacteria, Aspergillus fumigatus, influenza A and B, and rhinoviruses. Multitag 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to assess bacterial community composition and biodiversity. The results showed low bioaerosol concentrations regarding the targeted microorganisms, although the bacterial bioburden was rather high (10 4 bacteria/m 3 ). Airborne bacterial communities presented a high degree of overlap among the different subway environments sampled (inside trains, platforms, and lobbies) and were dominated by a few widespread taxa, with Methylobacterium being the most abundant genus. Human-related microbiota in sequence dataset and ascribed to potentially pathogenic bacteria were found in low proportion (maximum values below 2% of sequence readings) and evenly detected. Hence, no important biological exposure marker was detected in any of the sampled environments. Overall, we found that commuters are not the main source of bioaerosols in the Barcelona subway system.

J.; Gili, J.; Lopez, R.; Tapia, A.; Perez, B.; Pros, F.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe presentation is directed to the description of the actual situation and relevant information of the geodetic infrastructure of Ibiza and Barcelona sites for sea level determination and contribution to regional sea level rise. Time series are being analysed for mean sea level variations www.puertos.es. .In the framework of a Spanish Space Project, the instrumentation of sea level measurements has been improved by providing the Barcelona site with a radar tide gauge Datamar 2000C from Geonica s.l. near an acoustic tide gauge. Puertos del Estado installed in 2007 a MIROS radar tide gauge and the Barcelona Harbour Authority a GPS referente station in the roof of the new Control Tower situated in the Energy Pier. The radar sensor is over the water surface, on a L-shaped structure which elevates it a few meters above the quay shelf. 1-min data are transmitted to the ENAGAS Control Center by cable and then sent each 1 min to Puertos del Estado by e-mail. There is a GPS station Leica Geosystems GRX1200 GG Pro and antenna 1202. Precision levelling has been made several times in the last two years because the tower is founded in reclaimed land. The measured settlement rate is about 1cm/year that may be could mask the values registered by the tide gauge. A description of the actual infrastructure at Ibiza harbour at Marina de Botafoch, is presented and its applications to sea level monitoring and altimeter calibration in support of the main CGPS at Ibiza harbour. It is described the geometrical precision levelling made in June 2013 between the radar tide gauge and the GPS station. In particular, the CGPS located at Ibiza harbour is essential for its application to the marine campaign Baleares 2013, near Ibiza island. The main objective is to determine the altimeter bias for Jason-2, about 9:09 UTC September 15, 2013, and Saral/AltiKa, about 05:30 UTC September 16, UTC.

Recently, several studies have shown this association to be independent from confounders, mainly those of air pollutants. However, what has not been addressed is the problem of misalignment (i.e. the exposure data locations and health outcomes have different spatial locations). Without any explicit control of such misalignment inference is seriously compromised. Our objective is to assess the long-term effects of traffic noise on mortality in the city of Barcelona (Spain) during 2004-2007. We take into account the control of confounding, for both air pollution and socioeconomic factors at a contextual level and, in particular, we explicitly address the problem of misalignment. We employed a case-control design with individual data. We used deaths resulting from myocardial infarction, hypertension, or Type II diabetes mellitus in Barcelona between 2004 and 2007 as cases for the study, while for controls we used deaths (likewise in Barcelona and over the same period of time) resulting from AIDS or external causes (e.g. accidental falls, accidental poisoning by psychotropic drugs, drugs of abuse, suicide and self-harm, or injuries resulting from motor vehicle accidents). The controls were matched with the cases by sex and age. We used the annual average equivalent A-weighted sound pressure levels for daytime (7-21h), evening-time (21-23h) and night-time (23-7h), and controlled for the following confounders: i) air pollutants (NO2, PM10 and benzene), ii) material deprivation (at a census tract level) and iii) land use and other spatial variables. We explicitly controlled for heterogeneity (uneven distribution of both response and environmental exposures within an area), spatial dependency\n\nStructural characteristics of internally mixed carbonaceous aggregates from Barcelona (Spain) during DAURE winter campaign\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCoz, Esther; Casuccio, Gary S.; Robinson, Allen L.; Moreno, Teresa; Mohr, Claudia; Prevot, Andre S. H.; ArtÃ­Ã±ano, BegoÃ±a.\n\n2010-05-01\n\nParticle structure, understood as the characterization of size, morphology, texture and the spatial distribution of the different compounds at an individual particle level, influences carbonaceous aggregates behavior in the atmosphere and the respiratory system. Additionally, the absorption and scattering of light is modified by the particle structure and also influences water absorption and water vapor nucleation and, hence cloud formation, residence time in the atmosphere and removal processes. Two factors seem determinant in these processes: quantity of scattering material adsorbed onto the light absorbing core during the residence in the atmosphere and subsequent aging, and the spatial distribution of this condensed matter (commonly discussed as internally/externally mixtures). Morning, noon, afternoon, and evening samples were collected for electron microscopy analyses during 3 consecutive days during an atmospheric episode of thermal inversion in February 2009 in an urban background area within the city of Barcelona. The main goal of this study was to quantify the variations in morphology and state of mixture of carbonaceous soot-like aggregate structures observed during different times of the day. The study was part of the winter campaign: \"Determination of the sources of atmospheric Aerosols in Urban and Rural Environments in the western Mediterranean\" (DAURE, February/March 2009). The analysis of the aggregate structure was conducted by digital image analysis of several thousand particles to determine variations on size, shape and texture by means of several different mathematical descriptors such as aspect ratio/elongation, compactness and roughness through fractal dimension analysis, textural energy and entropy. Results indicate that carbon aggregates were mostly within 200-400 nm of geometric size, with slightly smaller sizes during time intervals associated to traffic peaks compared to the daily average.

A case was defined as the first positive blood culture for any Candida spp. in a resident of Barcelona, from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2003. We defined early mortality as occurring between days 3 to 7 after candidemia and late mortality as occurring between days 8 to 30. We detected 345 cases of candidemia, for an average annual incidence of 4.3 cases/100,000 population, 0.53 cases/1,000 hospital discharges, and 0.73 cases/10,000 patient-days. Outpatients comprised 11% of the cases, and 89% had a central venous catheter (CVC) at diagnosis. Overall mortality was 44%. Candida albicans was the most frequent species (51% of cases), followed by Candida parapsilosis (23%), Candida tropicalis (10%), Candida glabrata (8%), Candida krusei (4%), and other species (3%). Twenty-four isolates (7%) had decreased susceptibility to fluconazole (MIC > or = 16 microg/ml). On multivariable analysis, early death was independently associated with hematological malignancy (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 10.4). Treatment with antifungals (OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.2) and removal of CVCs (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.9) were protective factors for early death. Receiving adequate treatment, defined as having CVCs removed and administration of an antifungal medication (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.8), was associated with lower odds of late mortality; intubation (OR, 7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 21.1) was associated with higher odds. The incidence of candidemia and prevalence of fluconazole resistance are similar to other European countries, indicating that routine antifungal susceptibility testing is not warranted. Antifungal medication and catheter removal are critical in preventing mortality.\n\nPerforming Home in Barcelona: A Practice-Based Photo Essay\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPons, Esther Belvis\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDuring the winter of 2016, I carried out an artistic project in Barcelona entitled 'Performing Home' that aimed to explore the affective and social challenges that artists in political asylum or refuge cope with.

The radar tide gauge is a Datamar 3000C device and a Thales Navigation Internet-Enabled GPS Continuous Geodetic Reference Station (iCGRS) with a choke ring antenna. It is intended that the overall system will constitute a CGPS Station of the ESEAS (European Sea Level) and TIGA (GPS Tide Gauge Benchmark Monitoring) networks. Puertos del Estado (Spanish Harbours) installed the tide gauge station at Ibiza harbour in January 2003. The station belongs to the REDMAR network, composed at this moment by 21 stations distributed along the whole Spanish waters, including also the Canary islands. The tide gauge also belongs to the ESEAS (European Sea Level) network. At the Barcelona harbour they have installed a radar tide gauge near a GPS station belonging to Puerto de Barcelona. L'Estartit floating tide gauge was set up in 1990. Data are taken in graphics registers from each two hours the mean value is recorded in an electronic support. L'Estartit tide gauge series provides good quality information about the changes in the sea heights at centimeter level, that is the magnitude of the common tides in the Mediterranean. Two airborne calibration campaigns carrying an Optech Lidar ALTM-3025 (ICC) were made on June 16, 2007 with a Partenavia P-68 and October 12, 2007, with a Cessna Caravan 208B flying along two ICESat target tracks including crossover near l'Estartit. The validation of this new technology LIDAR may be useful to fill coastal areas where satellite radar altimeters are not measuring due to the large footprint and the resulting gaps of about 15-30 km within the coastline. Measurements with a GPS Buoy at l'Estartit harbour were made during the June experience and a GPS reference station was installed in Aiguablava. On October 12, 2007, another LIDAR campaign was\n\nReplacing car trips by increasing bike and public transport in the greater Barcelona metropolitan area: a health impact assessment study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRojas-Rueda, D; de Nazelle, A; TeixidÃ³, O; Nieuwenhuijsen, M J\n\n2012-11-15\n\nEstimate the health risks and benefits of mode shifts from car to cycling and public transport in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain. We conducted a health impact assessment (HIA), creating 8 different scenarios on the replacement of short and long car trips, by public transport or/and bike. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality and change in life expectancy related to two different assessments: A) the exposure of travellers to physical activity, air pollution to particulate matter <2.5 Î¼m (PM2.5), and road traffic fatality; and B) the exposure of general population to PM2.5, modelling by Barcelona Air-Dispersion Model. The secondary outcome was a change in emissions of carbon dioxide. The annual health impact of a shift of 40% of the car trips, starting and ending in Barcelona City, to cycling (n=141,690) would be for the travellers who shift modes 1.15 additional deaths from air pollution, 0.17 additional deaths from road traffic fatality and 67.46 deaths avoided from physical activity resulting in a total of 66.12 deaths avoided. Fewer deaths would be avoided annually if half of the replaced trips were shifted to public transport (43.76 deaths). The annual health impact in the Barcelona City general population (n=1,630,494) of the 40% reduction in car trips would be 10.03 deaths avoided due to the reduction of 0.64% in exposure to PM2.5. The deaths (including travellers and general population) avoided in Barcelona City therefore would be 76.15 annually. Further health benefits would be obtained with a shift of 40% of the car trips from the Greater Barcelona Metropolitan which either start or end in Barcelona City to public transport (40.15 deaths avoided) or public transport and cycling (98.50 deaths avoided).The carbon dioxide reduction for shifting from car to other modes of transport (bike and public transport) in Barcelona metropolitan area was estimated to be 203,251t/COâ emissions per year.

The aim of this study was to describe trends in mortality attributable to the principal causes of death: AIDS, drug overdose, suicide and motor vehicle traffic accidents, among adults aged between 15Â and 34Â years in three European cities (Barcelona, Bologna and Munich), over the period 1986Â to 1995.â¨METHODSâThe population studied consisted of all deaths that occurred between 1986Â and 1995Â among residents of Barcelona, Bologna and Munich aged from 15Â to 34Â years. Information about deaths was obtained from mortality registers. The study variables were sex, age, the underlying cause of death and year of death. Causes of death studied were: drug overdose, AIDS, suicide and motor vehicle traffic accidents. Age standardised mortality rates (direct adjustment) were obtained in all three cities for the age range 15-34. To investigate trends in mortality over the study period Poisson regression models were fitted, obtaining the average relative risk (RR) associated with a one year increment.â¨RESULTSâYoung adult mortality increased among men in Barcelona and Bologna (RR per year: 1.04,Â 95% confidence intervals (95%CI): 1.03,Â 1.06Â in Barcelona and RR:1.03, 95%CI:1.01, 1.06Â in Bologna) and among women in Barcelona (RR:1.02, 95%CI: 1.01,Â 1.04), with a change in the pattern of the main causes of death attributable to the increase in AIDS and drug overdose mortality. In Munich, the pattern did not change as much, suicides being the main cause of death during the 10Â years studied, although they have been decreasing since 1988Â (RR:0.92, 95%CI:0.88, 0.96Â for men and 0.81,Â 95%CI: 0.75-0.87 for women).â¨CONCLUSIONâThe increase in AIDS mortality observed in the three European cities in the mid-80s and mid-90s has yielded to substantial changes in the pattern of the main causes of death at young ages in Barcelona and Bologna.

C.; Serra, C.; RodrÃ­guez-SolÃ , R.; RedaÃ±o, A.; BurgueÃ±o, A.; MartÃ­nez, M. D.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nHeavy rainfall episodes are relatively common in the conurbation of Barcelona and neighbouring cities (NE Spain), usually due to storms generated by convective phenomena in summer and eastern and south-eastern advections in autumn. Prevention of local flood episodes and right design of urban drainage have to take into account the rainfall intensity spread instead of a simple evaluation of daily rainfall amounts. The database comes from 5-min rain amounts recorded by tipping buckets in the Barcelona urban network along the years 1994-2009. From these data, extreme 5-min rain amounts are selected applying the peaks-over-threshold method for thresholds derived from both 95% percentile and the mean excess plot. The return period curves are derived from their statistical distribution for every gauge, describing with detail expected extreme 5-min rain amounts across the urban network. These curves are compared with those derived from annual extreme time series. In this way, areas in Barcelona submitted to different levels of flood risk from the point of view of rainfall intensity are detected. Additionally, global time trends on extreme 5-min rain amounts are quantified for the whole network and found as not statistically significant.\n\nSpecies of Root-knot Nematodes and Fungal Egg Parasites Recovered from Vegetables in AlmerÃ­a and Barcelona, Spain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVerdejo-Lucas, S.; Ornat, C.; Sorribas, F. J.; Stchiegel, A.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nIntensive vegetable production areas were surveyed in the provinces of AlmerÃ­a (35 sites) and Barcelona (22 sites), Spain, to determine the incidence and identity of Meloidogyne spp. and of fungal parasites of nematode eggs. Two species of Meloidogyne were found in AlmerÃ­aâM. javanica (63% of the samples) and M. incognita (31%). Three species were found in Barcelona, including M. incognita (50%), M. javanica (36%), and M. arenaria (14%). Solanaceous crops supported larger (P < 0.05) nematode numbers than cucurbit crops in AlmerÃ­a but not in Barcelona. Fungal parasites were found in 37% and 45% of the sites in AlmerÃ­a and Barcelona, respectively, but percent parasitism was never greater than 5%. Nine fungal species were isolated from single eggs of the nematode. The fungi included Verticillium chlamydosporium, V. catenulatum, Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, Fusarium spp., Acremonium strictum, Gliocladium roseum, Cylindrocarpon spp., Engiodontium album, and Dactylella oviparasitica.
