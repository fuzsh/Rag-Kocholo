MCDONOUGH\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: SIMON BRUTY Deal\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: BILL FRAKES Jacobs\n\nThe Alltime Greatest\n\nIf featherweight world champion Ricardo Juarez (right) and his\n\nteammates live up to their potential, the U.S. could have one of\n\nits best boxing teams ever. It will be hard-pressed, however, to\n\nmatch the 1976 squad, which won five golds and produced three of\n\nthe 12 fighters on SI's alltime U.S. Olympic boxing team\n\n(adjusted for historical changes in weight classes):\n\nLight Flyweight (106 pounds) Paul Gonzales, 1984\n\nFlyweight (112) Leo Randolph, 1976\n\nBantamweight (119) Kennedy McKinney, 1988\n\nFeatherweight (126) Meldrick Taylor, 1984\n\nLightweight (132) Howard Davis, 1976\n\nLight Welterweight (140) Ray Leonard, 1976\n\nWelterweight (148) Mark Breland, 1984\n\nLight Middleweight (156) Roy Jones Jr., 1988\n\nMiddleweight (165) Floyd Patterson, 1952\n\nLight Heavyweight (179) Muhammad Ali, 1960\n\nHeavyweight (201) Joe Frazier, 1964\n\nSuper Heavyweight (unlimited) George Foreman, 1968\n\nLook Who's Not Coming\n\nSome of the world's best athletes won't be in Australia. Injuries\n\nshelved NBA stars Tim Duncan and Grant Hill, and most top pro\n\nbaseball and soccer players will be absent. Here are 10 others\n\nwho probably would have won medals had they competed.\n\nShaquille O'Neal (above), basketball The NBA MVP won gold with\n\nthe 1996 Dream Team but bowed out this year, preferring to chill\n\nfor the summer.\n\nPete Sampras, tennis The winner of more Grand Slam singles titles\n\nthan any other man has never been an Olympian--he withdrew in\n\n1996--and this year he turned down an invitation to Sydney, saying\n\nhe'd be too tired after the U.S. Open.\n\nJeff Hartwig, track and field Plagued by dried-out contact lenses\n\nat the U.S. trials in July, the world's No. 2-ranked pole vaulter\n\ndidn't make the team.\n\nJustin Huish, archery The 1996 champ and Geena Davis inspirer\n\nresigned from the U.S. team in March after his arrest on\n\ndrug-dealing charges. He pleaded not guilty and is awaiting\n\ntrial.\n\nKhalid Khannouchi, track and field The Moroccan-born world-record\n\nholder in the marathon became a U.S. citizen in May but, nursing\n\ninjuries, skipped the U.S. trials.\n\nMichael Simms Jr., boxing The world champ at 179 pounds was\n\nkicked off the U.S. team in April for poor work habits, tardiness\n\nand an obstreperous attitude.\n\nLisa Raymond, tennis The world's No. 1 doubles player was passed\n\nover by U.S. coach Billie Jean King in favor of Serena Williams.\n\nWu Yanyan, swimming The world champ in the 200-meter individual\n\nmedley is the latest Chinese woman banned for steroid use.\n\nNiurka Montalvo, track and field The world long jump champ became\n\na Spanish citizen within the last three years, so she needed a\n\nrelease from her native Cuba to compete. She didn't get it.\n\nEmma Carney, triathlon The 1994 and '97 world champ lost her\n\narbitration case after being left off the Australian squad.\n\nOlder and Older\n\nEvery four years the \"youth of the world\" gather for the Summer\n\nOlympics--so what is the American track and field team doing in\n\nSydney? Led by gray hairs such as hammer thrower Lance Deal, 39,\n\nand middle-distance runner Regina Jacobs, 37, the U.S. squad is\n\nAmerica's oldest ever (average age: 28.5). The growth of prize\n\nmoney and training stipends since 1984 has kept athletes in the\n\nsport and, as the graph shows, made the U.S. team ever more ...\n\nmature.\n\nAverage Age of U.S. Olympic Track & Field Team"
