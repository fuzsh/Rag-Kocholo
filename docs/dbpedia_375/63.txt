The target in this event was 1 metre in diameter with 10 scoring rings, with a black aiming mark of 60 cm in diameter. Shooters shot 40 shots from 300 metres in a prone position for a possible of 400 points. This event was a part of the 3-position free rifle event which was shot concurrently for individuals and teams, and like the other two elements, kneeling and standing, it counted as a separate event with medals being awarded accordingly. It was the only time at the Olympics that this happened.

For the first and only time, the World Championships were held concurrently with the Olympics and the Olympic Champions also became World Champions. It was the fourth staging of the World Championships, having previously been held in Lyon (France) in 1897, Turin (Italy) 1898 and Loosduinen 1899 which, since 1923 has been a district of Den Haag (Netherlands).

The reigning World Champion Jesse Wallingford (Great Britain), did not defend his title in Paris. However, the 1898 champion Léon Moreaux, of France who also won a bronze medal in 1899, was out to regain his title. Other medallists from previous World Championships competing in Paris were Ole Østmo (Norway) (bronze 1897) and Achille Paroche (France) (silver 1898).
