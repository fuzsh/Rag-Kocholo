There are many great New York stories, and ours begins here, at the corner of West 42nd and Broadway. Tucked between the bright lights of Times Square and the calm of Bryant Park. Steps from anything, miles from everything.

Our legacy is our location, but weâ€™re also a sleek and contemporary escape from the pulse of the city.
