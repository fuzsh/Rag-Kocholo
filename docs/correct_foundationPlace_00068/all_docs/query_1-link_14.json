        "text": "More than at any time since its opening in 1986, the Javits Center is fulfilling its mission to support New Yorkers. Operated by the New York Convention Center Operating Corporation (NYCCOC), a public benefit corporation, the Javits Center has played a critical role in New Yorkâ€™s recovery and resurgence, helping to create a safer and stronger future for the Empire State. With an historic expansion project completed and 850,000 square feet of flexible exhibition space along the scenic Hudson River, this iconic facility is continuing to drive the economies of New York State and New York City by hosting blockbuster events of all shapes and sizes. Nowhere in the country will you find a venue with the extensive resources, services and staff of elite professionals dedicated to making every trade show, convention and special event a success. It's no wonder that nearly 40,000 companies have chosen the Javits Center as their preferred venue every year, making it the busiest convention center in the country. And when you consider that the Javits Center sits at the nexus of Manhattan's resurgent West Side neighborhood, it's easy to see why whatever's happening, happens here."
