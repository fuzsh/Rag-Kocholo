        "text": "You probably already know that the National Park Service offers a range of traditional outdoor recreational activities for visitor enjoyment including bicycling, camping, climbing, equestrianism, fishing, hiking, hunting, swimming, snowshoeing, and more. And you maybe knew that you can find outdoor adventures in cultural and natural resource programs and events such as interpretive ranger talks, live music, theater, and craft demonstrations. But did you know that several national parks also maintain exercise and sports facilities and offer opportunities for golf, tennis, and running?\n\nMany emerging recreational activities, such as stand up paddle-boarding, geocaching, sport climbing, pack-rafting, e-bikes, and electric kick scooters, continue to grow in popularity and use in some national parks, but you should always check the park website to see what activities are allowed.\n\nExplore this page to discover recreational opportunities and trip-planning tools and then search for a park that offers your favorite activities.\n\nMore Information\n\nThe National Park Service, through its parks and community assistance programs, is recognized as one of the premier providers of outdoor recreation in the world, offering high quality experiences and world class tourist destinations.\n\nThe Conservation and Outdoor Recreation Division provides the National Park Service and local communities across the country with cost effective, partnership-based support in achieving Americaâ€™s conservation and outdoor recreation goals.\n\nToday, as tourism and destination management grow in scale and complexity, the Tourism Program works with the travel and tourism sector to manage responsible tourism that supports conservation and preservation, provides high-quality visitor experiences, and contributes to community vitality.\n\nOutdoor recreation opportunities allow people to more fully experience our beautiful public lands and waterways. The U.S. Department of the Interior has hundreds of recreation opportunities for you to explore on your public lands in all 50 states and US territories."
