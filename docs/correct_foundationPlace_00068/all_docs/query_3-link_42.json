        "text": "Members will know it is their time to renew when they get mail from the State of New Jersey or their County Board of Social Services. Members should open all letters, follow instructions, and respond right away to help stay covered.\n\nMost people who have a managed care organization (MCO), also known as an HMO or a health plan, will also get a postcard from their plan. This means that their renewal packet is coming that month, and they should look for mail.\n\nSome members will get calls from a Regional Health Hub or a New Jersey state employee to talk about their renewals.\n\nMembers should call NJ FamilyCare at 1-800-701-0710 (TTY: 711) if any of their information changes, like their phone number or mailing address.\n\nMembers should allow at least 30 days before reaching out to NJ FamilyCare to ask questions about their renewal packet submission. If 30 days pass and they want an update, they can call their County Board of Social Services or NJ FamilyCare at 1-800-701-0710 (TTY: 711).\n\nMembers should also look for follow-up mail after submitting their renewal packet. If a member moves or gets a new phone number after submitting their renewal packet, it is important to let NJ FamilyCare know by calling 1-800-701-0710 (TTY: 711). If a member gets a letter, they should follow all instructions and send it back as soon as possible.\n\nNJ FamilyCare is in the process of upgrading our systems so that applications and renewals are easily accessible on all platforms. At this time, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are the best internet browsers to use. Internet Explorer is no longer supported and may not work properly. Laptops and desktop computers are the best devices for completing renewals. Cell phones and tablets may be more challenging because the screens are smaller and will require scrolling and zooming in and out.\n\nNo. Beware of renewal scams. NJ FamilyCare will never charge or ask for money from members to enroll or re-enroll. Do not share banking or credit card information with anyone that calls you, claiming to represent NJ FamilyCare, the Department of Human Services, the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, or your NJ FamilyCare Health Plan. Don’t hesitate to call NJ FamilyCare at 1-800-701-0710 (TTY: 711) to report a scam or verify legitimate information. Flyers in 21 languages about scam and fraud awareness are available at https://njfamilycare.dhs.state.nj.us/use_benefts.aspx.\n\nMembers should take time to make sure the renewal process goes smoothly by responding to requests for information and reporting changes in their household like pregnancy, address, income, and so on. Those members determined to be eligible will continue to receive NJ FamilyCare/Medicaid benefits.\n\nIf a member no longer qualifies for coverage through NJ FamilyCare/Medicaid, they may be referred to GetCoveredNJ, where they can get help paying for healthcare coverage. GetCoveredNJ is the state's official health insurance marketplace where individuals and families can easily shop for and buy affordable healthcare coverage.\n\nA member who has lost coverage but believes they still qualify should call their County Board of Social Services or the NJ FamilyCare health benefits coordinator at 1-800-701-0710 (TTY: 711).\n\nIf a member has Medicare, they may qualify for help with premiums, co-pays, and deductibles through New Jersey’s Medicare Savings Programs. Learn more about program eligibility and benefits by calling 1-609-792-9745 (TTY: 711)."
