Jordan Morris scored his team-leading ninth goal of the season, as Seattle extended its winning streak to five games across all competitions. Stefan Frei recorded his sixth shutout of the season and 111th of his MLS career, one shy of Kevin Hartman for second in league history.\n\nBrian Schmetzerâs side now returns to Seattle for a pair of key Western Conference home matchups, beginning on Wednesday, July 17 against St. Louis CITY SC (7:30 p.m. PT / Apple TV, 93.3 KJR FM, El Rey 1360 AM) before hosting LAFC on Saturday, July 20 on the Emerald Queen Casino Pitch at Lumen Field (7:30 p.m. PT / Apple TV, 93.3 KJR FM, El Rey 1360 AM).\n\nMATCH NOTES\n\nâ¢ At the time of writing, Sounders FC sits in seventh place in the Western Conference with 34 points (9-7-7), just three points outside of fourth position and the chance at home-field advantage in the MLS Cup Playoffs.\n\nâ¢ Seattle is now 4-1-3 all-time against Austin FC in MLS regular-season play, including an unbeaten 3-0-1 record at Q2 Stadium.\n\nâ¢ Sounders FC is riding a five-match winning streak and has lost just twice in its last 17 outings (10-2-5) across all competitions.\n\nâ¢ Jordan Morris scored his team-leading ninth goal of the season (MLS regular-season play) after coming on as a halftime substitute.
