        "text": "The New York Times reports that since New York’s eviction moratorium expired in mid-January, tenants have been forced from their homes in more than 500 cases. Legal Services NYC and the Legal Aid Society have called on the court to slow the speed of eviction cases moving through the system, but housing courts have rejected the request.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James issued an advisory to landlords on April 18 reminding them that they cannot raise rents if they accepted or plan to accept funding from the state’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP), which was recently expanded in the state’s budget. Landlords who accept payments from the program are prohibited from raising rents for a year after they receive the funds. Attorney General James said she is prepared to take action to protect tenants if landlords fail to abide by ERAP’s rules.\n\nThe NY Daily News reports state lawmakers on April 22 urged New York’s Chief Judge Janet DiFiore to avert “an impending eviction and homelessness crisis” by ordering housing courts to slow operations until all low-income tenants have lawyers. According to 32 state lawmakers, Judge DiFiore’s refusal to slow the speed at which judges are processing a backlog of 220,000 eviction lawsuits and counting undermines city law and is actively influencing outcomes. Moreover, this figure does not include more than 30,000 primarily Black and Hispanic NYCHA households also behind on rent.\n\nThe Legal Aid Society announced on April 18 that hundreds of New Yorkers facing eviction may have to represent themselves in court due to a backlog of eviction cases leading to a shortage of legal aid attorneys. After the eviction moratorium was lifted in January, eviction filings have been on the rise across the state.\n\nThree months after New York’s eviction moratorium ended, legal aid groups say they are unable to keep up with the overwhelming demand of tenants in need of legal representation. The Legal Aid Society and the New York Legal Assistance Group said that attorneys will be unable to take new cases in Queens in April, and they are urging the Office of Court Administration to slow the scheduling of housing court cases to make sure those at risk of eviction can access an attorney.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul on April 9 detailed the uses of $2 billion in reserve pandemic recovery funding in the fiscal year (FY) 2023 State Budget. The budget includes $800 million in state funds for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, $250 million for utility assistance, and $125 million for the Landlord Rental Assistance Program.\n\nUpdated on May 23, 2022\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul announced on January 11 that New York will allow its eviction and foreclosure moratorium to expire on January 15, but the state will once again let people apply for eviction protection and rent relief. Dozens of faith leaders called on Governor Hochul to extend New York’s eviction moratorium through June.\n\nLaw 360 reports State Judge Lynn Kotler ordered the New York Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance to reopen the application portal for the state’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP), which stopped considering most new applications in mid-November as funds dwindled. Judge Kotler noted that ERAP applicants receive an automatic eviction stay while their paperwork is being processed. Tenants should “at least… have the benefit of being able to apply for ERA now and obtain their rightful place on a de facto waitlist,” wrote Judge Kotler in the three-page preliminary injunction order.\n\nUpdated on January 31, 2022\n\nThe New York Times reports that inside one Brooklyn homeless shelter, 11 women who tested positive for COVID-19 were crowded into a small room with just a few chairs and several mattresses on the floor. While there are hundreds of vacant beds in isolation units and quarantine rooms in hotels, the women were told none were available.\n\nHousing advocates and tenants are bracing for a “deluge” of eviction cases when New York State’s eviction moratorium expires on January 15. Governor Kathy Hochul has not signaled that she will extend the eviction moratorium.\n\nUpdated on January 30, 2022\n\nThe New York Times reports the Legal Aid Society filed a lawsuit on December 13 to force the state to reopen its emergency rental assistance (ERA) program. New York landlords are prohibited from evicting tenants while an ERA application is pending. The lawsuit argues that New York’s recent decision to stop accepting applications eliminated this key protection for struggling tenants, leaving thousands of renters at risk of eviction.\n\nA lawsuit to overturn New York’s eviction moratorium will forge ahead. U.S. District Judge Gary Brown has already declined two attempts to block the temporary moratorium, most recently for a “lack of standing.” His latest order issued on December 1 denied the state’s request to dismiss the suit.\n\nUpdated on December 20, 2021\n\nSpectrum News reports the Community Housing Improvement Program, an organization that represents 4,000 housing operators in New York, says Governor Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers should allocate at least $2 billion for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program to help the thousands of renters who remain behind on rent. The push for additional assistance comes after a survey found at least 100,000 tenants have significant rental arrears and have not received any assistance.\n\nUpdated on December 13, 2021\n\nNew York state’s eviction moratorium, which expires January 15, 2022, allows landlords to challenge a tenant’s hardship declaration by submitting a sworn statement claiming the tenant has not lost income during the pandemic. Tenant advocates with the Legal Aid Society say judges have begun scheduling eviction hearings, even if landlords have insufficient evidence to support their claim about their tenants’ financial status.\n\nUpdated on November 22, 2021\n\nAs New York’s latest eviction protections near a January end date, City Limits reports New York City tenants’ rights advocates are reigniting their push for “Good Cause” eviction protections. The bill would provide tenants the right to a lease renewal in most cases and prevent landlords from removing a tenant without an order from a judge – even if that tenant’s lease has expired or they never had a lease.\n\nUpdated on November 03, 2021\n\nBloomberg reports New York’s biggest landlord group sued to block a law extending the state’s eviction and foreclosure moratorium. The law, signed by Governor Kathy Hochul on September 2, extends the statewide eviction moratorium through January 15, 2022. The landlords are seeking a preliminary injunction to suspend the moratorium while the case proceeds.\n\nUpdated on October 25, 2021\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul announced on September 14 significant progress in providing emergency rental assistance. The press release states that, according to NLIHC’s database, New York is now ranked first nationally in payments made or obligated, and is among the leaders in direct payments.\n\nThe Rent Stabilization Association asked a federal court to strike down Governor Hochul’s statewide eviction moratorium. The association represents 25,000 landlords in New York City, who are unsatisfied with the carve-out made to allow landlords to challenge tenant filings. The NY Daily News reports that since August 29, there are 225,000 active eviction cases.\n\nUpdated on September 21, 2021\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul on September 2 signed new legislation extending the moratorium on COVID-related evictions until January 15, 2022. The law expands the Emergency Rental Assistance Program and creates the nation’s strongest eviction protections. Learn more about New York’s eviction moratorium here.\n\nUpdated on September 14, 2021\n\nThe United States Supreme Court on August 12 blocked a core part of New York’s statewide eviction moratorium. The part in question prevented eviction cases from proceeding if a tenant submitted a declaration form stating they had experienced economic hardship because of the pandemic. The New York Times breaks down what the Supreme Court’s ruling means for New Yorkers.\n\nThe New York congressional delegation sent a letter to the New York Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA) expressing dire concern over the department’s continued lack of emergency rental assistance (ERA) distribution. The members of Congress urge OTDA to address roadblocks in the program and adopt best practices to ensure ERA is distributed as effectively and efficiently as possible.\n\nUpdated on August 30, 2021\n\nThe New York Times reports New York City resumed the process of moving thousands of people experiencing homelessness from hotel rooms back to congregate shelters July 26. The city’s actions come amid growing concerns that coronavirus cases quadrupled citywide and over objections from advocates for people experiencing homelessness. The city resumed the transfers on the same day Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered city workers to get vaccinated or tested weekly because the “Delta variant is deadly.\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo announced on July 26 a new “streamlined” application process for New York’s rent relief program, which will relax documentation requirements for tenants and landlords. Governor Cuomo’s announcement comes as New York has faced bipartisan criticism for the lack of rental assistance it has distributed.\n\nUpdated on August 3, 2021\n\nThe New York Times reports that the city’s plan to move 8,000 people who have been staying in hotels during the pandemic back to congregate shelters was disrupted on July 13 when a federal judge ruled that officials were not adequately considering the health of those being moved. The ruling comes after the Legal Aid Society filed a motion accusing the city of violating the rights of people with disabilities.\n\nThe city aimed to move approximately 8,000 people to barracks-style congregate shelters by the end of July, where state rules allow beds to be placed just three feet apart. A city spokesman said officials would make “minor adjustments” to the process and resume moving individuals next week.\n\nNLIHC sent a letter to FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell on July 1 urging FEMA to release guidance immediately on FEMA reimbursement for non-congregate shelter and to extend the 100% reimbursement policy through June 2022. The letter states that while some cities have begun to end non-congregate sheltering programs, COVID-19 continues to pose a grave danger to individuals residing in congregate living environments, including people experiencing homelessness and people with disabilities. NLIHC’s letter echoes previous requests by California Governor Gavin Newsom, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, El Centro Mayor Cheryl Viegas-Walker, and Sonoma County Supervisor James Gore, who sent a similar letter to FEMA last month.\n\nUpdated on July 22, 2021\n\nWith New York’s eviction moratorium set to expire at the end of August, housing advocates and legal aid attorneys in the Southern Tier are preparing as many defenses as possible.\n\nUpdated on July 15, 2021\n\nAs New York City moves to end its emergency hotel program, some hotel residents are decrying the city’s decision to force them back into the congregate shelter system. The city has moved approximately 10,000 individuals from shelters and into hotel rooms during the pandemic. Homeless advocates say that evicting the hotel residents too quickly will only increase homelessness. NLIHC’s Diane Yentel tweeted that FEMA is providing 100% reimbursement for eligible non-congregate sheltering costs through September. Additionally, HUD recently allocated $5 billion in emergency housing vouchers for people who are homeless.\n\nJune 22, 2021\n\nWYNC reports that New York City is preparing to move New Yorkers experiencing homelessness who are currently living in hotels back into congregate shelters. A letter from the city says individuals will be moving back into congregate shelters soon but did not provide a specific timeline. NLIHC President and CEO Diane Yentel noted on Twitter that FEMA provides 100% reimbursement for eligible non-congregate sheltering costs through September. Additionally, HUD recently allocated $5 billion in emergency housing vouchers for people who are homeless.\n\nBK Reader reports the New York City Council passed legislation that will significantly increase the ability of New Yorkers experiencing homelessness to find housing through CityFHEPS, the city’s rental voucher program.\n\nJune 14, 2021\n\nDozens of community members, local leaders, and housing and homeless advocates are urging Governor Andrew Cuomo immediately to use $100 million allocated for the conversion of distressed hotels and motels into housing for people experiencing homelessness. The advocates are also urging legislators to pass the Housing Our Neighbors with Dignity Act, which establishes the plan for New York to buy distressed hotels and convert them into permanent and safe housing.\n\nJune 4, 2021\n\nNew York lawmakers are considering legislation that would extend eviction protections through August 31, 2021. In addition to tenant protections, the bill would extend mortgage and tax foreclosure prevention for homeowners and small landlords. Housing advocates have raised concerns that the current moratorium would expire before the state launches its more than $2 billion emergency rental assistance program. Spectrum News reports that tenant advocates rallied in Foley Square on April 26, calling on elected officials to extend the statewide eviction moratorium and speed up the creation of the rental assistance application process.\n\nMay 3, 2021\n\nWith New York’s eviction moratorium set to expire on May 1, local leaders in Rochester are taking steps to protect renters at risk of losing their homes through the Rochester and Monroe County Eviction Prevention Pilot Initiative. About 25% of renters in Rochester were behind on their March rent.\n\nApril 28, 2021\n\nThe New York Times reports that an analysis of court data shows that New York City renters in COVID hot spots are four times more likely to face eviction. The areas hit hardest by the coronavirus, largely Black and Latino neighborhoods, have seen the most eviction cases.\n\nThe Gothamist reports that despite efforts to make rental assistance more accessible to applicants, the second round of New York’s rent relief program has reached fewer people than the first. Nearly eight weeks after the February 1 deadline, New York had distributed just $7 million out of $60 million available for struggling tenants.\n\nMarch 31, 2021\n\nNew York’s eviction moratorium pause ends on Friday, February 26. After February 26, pending eviction cases can move forward again in court and new cases can be filed – unless a tenant submits a hardship declaration form to the court or their landlord. The moratorium is extended until May 1 only for tenants who filled out the hardship declaration. Tenants can use the Eviction Free NY tool (also available in Spanish) to fill out and submit the declaration online.\n\nMarch 01, 2021\n\nA coalition of New York City housing and homeless advocates, joined by the city’s top real estate group, is calling on the city and state to expand and improve three rental assistance programs to help struggling households at risk for eviction.\n\nPUSH Buffalo, a member of the Housing Justice for All coalition, is going door-to-door to educate renters on the tenant hardship declaration that must be filed by February 25 to be protected from eviction.\n\nFebruary 08, 2021\n\nThe New York City Eviction Prevention Roundtable released a report outlining policy recommendations to keep New York tenants housed during and after the immediate crisis of COVID-19 and address the viability of building owners. The recommendations seek to streamline and expand eligibility for existing housing assistance programs and address growing economic needs.\n\nFebruary 01, 2021\n\nThirty-one New York senators asked the state Office of Court Administration to issue additional guidance on the eviction moratorium for local courts to ensure that the moratorium and its protections are applied uniformly across the state. Lawmakers have received multiple reports of judges disregarding the law and regulations.\n\nJanuary 25, 2021\n\nThe New York Legislature on December 28 passed one of the mostcomprehensive eviction moratoriums in the nation. Thelaw places a moratorium on evictions until May 1 for tenants who endured a “COVID-related hardship.”\n\nTheNew York Times discusses the looming eviction crisis that threatens to overwhelm schools, homeless shelters, and food pantries.\n\nMultiple sources say that while the New York State Senate has proposed a blanket eviction moratorium, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie is pushing back against the proposal and advocating for a narrower measure.\n\nJanuary 15, 2021\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that New York City advocates continue to urge city officials to place individuals experiencing homelessness in single-occupancy hotel rooms to prevent the spread of the coronavirus throughout the shelter system.\n\nNew York City marshals have begun executing the first legal residential evictions since the pandemic shuttered courts across the state in March.\n\nDecember 9, 2020\n\nA historic Midtown hotel will be converted into a permanent shelter for families experiencing homelessness next month. The former Renwick Hotel will become an adult family shelter serving 170 families experiencing homelessness without minor children.\n\nJudge Debra James upheld a temporary restraining order preventing New York City from moving men experiencing homelessness who have been residing at the Lucerne to a different hotel. The judge will rule on Monday whether the men can continue to stay at the hotel. “If the court allows the forcible eviction of the men of the Lucerne to another area, what it would be saying is wealthy and well connected people can hire a politically-connected lawyer and forcibly evict people from their home because they don't have money,\" said Michael Hiller, an attorney opposing the city’s relocation plan.\n\nThe New York Times reports on the benefits experienced by the men who have been residing at the Lucerne Hotel, a hotel-turned-shelter, during the pandemic. A Manhattan Supreme Court justice on November 16 will decide whether the men residing at the Lucerne Hotel in the Upper West Side will be allowed to stay or must be moved to a Radisson Hotel in the Financial District.\n\nAn op-ed in the New York Daily News written by two state representatives outlines why the New York Legislature must enact real rent relief. The proposed legislation includes establishing an inclusive rental assistance program and enacting an eviction and foreclosure moratorium for the duration of the pandemic and one year after.\n\nNovember 30, 2020\n\nThe Legal Aid Society released a statement calling on Governor Andrew Cuomo to extend an executive order pausing default judgments, which expires Wednesday, November 4. As many as 14,800 households in New York City are at risk of losing their homes, simply because they followed the court’s instructions to refrain from answering their petitions.\n\nNovember 10, 2020\n\nThe Legal Aid Society and the law firm Jenner & Block filed a lawsuit against New York City on October 22 for failing to provide single occupancy rooms to individuals experiencing homelessness during the pandemic. The lawsuit also charges the city for violating the “Americans with Disabilities Act” by failing to provide reasonable accommodations to all qualifying individuals who request a single room due to their medical condition.\n\nNovember 4, 2020\n\nJudge Debra James issued a temporary restraining order, preventing New York City from forcing more than 200 men experiencing homelessness from the Lucerne Hotel. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the move after Upper West Side NIMBYs threatened to sue the city over its decision to temporarily house people experiencing homelessness at a local hotel during the pandemic.\n\nAdvocates with Legal Services of the Hudson Valley are concerned about a surge of evictions when the federal moratorium expires at the end of the year. Since the eviction moratoriums were enacted, the organization has seen instances where landlords have sent threatening letters, turned off essential services, refused to address hazardous living conditions, and employed other illegal tactics to force tenants out of their homes.\n\nOctober 26, 2020\n\nLegal Services Corporation reports New Yorkers are still being evicted despite the statewide and federal eviction moratoriums.\n\nAdministrative Judge Lawrence Marks, in a memo released on October 9, said evictions – including those for non-payment of rent – may resume in New York on October 12, but with “important caveats.”\n\nOctober 19, 2020\n\nThousands of New York City residents are at risk of losing their homes amid fears of a second wave of COVID-19. There are roughly 14,000 outstanding evictions in New York City, and 1,500 landlords have filed a motion to evict tenants.\n\nA new safety report finds New York City courts pose severe coronavirus risks to the workers and the public.\n\nOctober 14, 2020\n\nThe Legal Aid Society released a statement on September 26 ahead of a vigil in support of New Yorkers residing at the Lucerne Hotel. “As we have said since day one, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s capitulation to a small group of vocal NIMBYists with a racist agenda is unconscionable and inexcusable,” the statement reads. “The troubling message the City sends these New Yorkers by making this regrettable decision is clear: you cannot live here, and the voices of the people who complained are worth more to us than your well-being.”\n\nThe Legal Aid Society condemned an executive order signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo extending protections to a subset of residential tenants who were facing evictions before the pandemic shut down courts. The executive order does not extend the blanket eviction. Rather, it expands eligibility for protection under the state’s Tenant Safe Harbor Act.\n\nThe Legal Aid Society urged Governor Cuomo to extend the residential eviction moratorium, which expired on October 1, to cover all tenants, regardless of circumstance, and extend well beyond the end of the pandemic.\n\nOctober 5, 2020\n\nHousing advocates in New York City report some building owners are trying to illegally evade the federal and state eviction moratoriums. “We’ve seen a big uptick in illegal lockout proceedings as landlords are becoming frustrated with the continued eviction moratorium,” said Emily Eaton, an attorney with Legal Aid.\n\nNew York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie responded to advocates urging him and other state officials to extend the state’s eviction moratorium to “stop worrying about the evictions” without providing any information to support his assertion that there will not be mass evictions when the moratorium expires October 1.\n\n“Between the 200,000 pending housing court cases and the 14,000 households with an active eviction warrant, allowing the moratorium to expire and these cases to proceed would be nothing short of catastrophic,” said Judith Goldiner, the head of the Legal Aid Society’s Civil Reform Unit.\n\nSeptember 29, 2020\n\nThe NYU News editorial board writes that Mayor Bill de Blasio’s decision to evict residents who are homeless from a local hotel after Upper West Side NIMBYs threatened to sue the city endangers public health and demonstrates the city’s hostility toward people experiencing homelessness.\n\nNew York Daily News reports the city’s Department of Homeless Services sent a letter to residents at the Harmonia shelter, a Manhattan homeless shelter for those with special needs, a week after many of them were ordered to leave the facility they have called home for years. The letter did not provide information on the residents’ futures. “We appreciate that the city has finally begun to communicate directly with our clients,” said Josh Goldfein of the Legal Aid Society. “The distressing uncertainty they are currently experiencing will not be resolved until the mayor renounces his rushed shelter shuffle plan and offers a real route to permanent housing.”\n\nDozens of people gathered outside the Lucerne hotel and marched to Carl Shurz Park to protest Mayor Bill de Blasio’s decision to displace the families at the Harmonia shelter to make space for the 300 men temporarily residing at the Upper West Side hotel.\n\nA nurse practitioner with the Center for Urban Community Services writes in an op-ed in City Limits that providing non-congregate shelter for individuals experiencing homelessness in hotels amid the pandemic is a life-saving practice.\n\nSeptember 22, 2020\n\nThe Legal Aid Society announced on September 10 that it is preparing an Article 78 lawsuit against New York City over its plan to force New Yorkers living with disabilities and from the Harmonia homeless shelter in Manhattan to other facilities across the city that lack necessary services to meet their needs. The city’s plan to move residents from the Harmonia shelter, 80% of whom have disabilities, stems from the need to accommodate the men experiencing homelessness who were kicked out of the Lucerne Hotel.\n\n“We are deeply disturbed that the Mayor is caving to political pressure to move homeless New Yorkers out of temporary pandemic shelter in a way that will displace one hundred fifty adult families sheltered at the Harmonia, none of whom deserve to get caught up in this politicized process,” says State Senator Liz Krueger.\n\nPolitico reports that Mayor Bill de Blasio denied he was caving to political pressure, insisting it was the “beginning of a larger effort to come back from those hotels.”\n\n“The community treats us like we are criminals, and the city has given in to their demands to move us out,” says an individual temporarily residing in an Upper West Side hotel during the pandemic. “Being homeless during a pandemic is hard enough – but being unwelcome, and looked down on, makes it even worse.”\n\nAdvocates are concerned about what will happen to the 250 formerly incarcerated people who have been residing in New York City hotels during the pandemic if the city halts the program. The de Blasio administration is seeking reimbursement for the program from FEMA. The city has contracted with several social service nonprofits and the hotels until October 31, but the program faces neighborhood opposition and uncertain funding.\n\nSeptember 15, 2020\n\nCurbed NY reports that NIMBY groups have threatened to sue New York City to transfer the people experiencing homelessness temporarily residing in Upper West Side hotels if Mayor de Blasio’s administration did not provide a timeline to do so within 48 hours. While Mayor Bill de Blasio announced earlier this month that the city would start developing a plan to reduce the “reliance on hotels,” the Department of Homeless Services has not yet said it is safe to move the approximately 10,000 people currently residing in 139 hotels back into the shelter system.\n\nThe Legal Aid Society says that if Mayor de Blasio decides to move people experiencing homelessness out of hotels, its lawyers would file a lawsuit. “The public health crisis is not over, and moving people experiencing homelessness back into overcrowded shelters could spark a second wave of COVID-19, putting lives at needless risk,” says Judith Goldiner, attorney-in-charge of the Civil Law Reform Unit at the Legal Aid Society.\n\nThe Legal Aid Society found that approximately 14,000 New York City families were facing eviction before the pandemic began in March. The organization sent a letter to New York State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie urging the legislature to reconvene to extend the statewide eviction moratorium, set to expire October 1, indefinitely.\n\nResidents of Upper West Side hotels share about the positive impacts of moving from congregate shelters to isolated hotel rooms. Councilman Stephen Levin has called on the de Blasio administration to expand rental assistance and provide additional housing and homelessness resources to protect New Yorkers experiencing homelessness from the threat of COVID-19.\n\nSeptember 10, 2020\n\nTenants and housing advocates rallied outside Troy City Court on August 27 to protest against evictions. There were about 30 landlord-tenant proceedings on the Troy City Court scheduled for August 27. VOCAL-NY, a grassroots advocacy organization, says that despite New York’s eviction moratorium, property owners are using pre-COVID-19 paperwork to pursue evictions.\n\nAn op-ed penned by Dave Giffen and Giselle Routhier of the Coalition for the Homeless in the New York Daily News discusses the vocal NIMBY voices urging officials to prematurely move people residing in hotels to congregate settings. The authors urge New Yorkers to stop dehumanizing people experiencing homelessness and instead act with compassion and reason.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on August 17 declared that he is considering moving people temporarily residing in hotels during the pandemic back into homeless shelters. An article in Curbed argues that hotels are still the city’s best chance to prevent the looming homelessness crisis. The #HomelessCantStayHome Coalition sent a letter to city officials on August 12, urging them to stop moving New Yorkers experiencing homelessness back to congregate shelters, end harmful sweeps, and enact additional policies to protect the health and safety of people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe president of the Housing Court Judges Association, a union representing 50 housing court judges in New York City, testified on August 21 at a state senate hearing, urging New York legislators to intervene to prevent a looming ‘nightmare’ situation in housing court. Judge Daniele Chinea asked legislators to help landlords and tenants with their growing debts, rather than force judges to exercise discretion when both parties are reporting extreme financial strain.\n\nSeptember 2, 2020\n\nAlthough New York’s eviction moratorium was extended until October 1, advocates say that the state courts and legislature should go further by pausing all eviction proceedings, including those filed before the pandemic’s start. “No one should have to fight to save their home during a pandemic,” said the Housing Justice for All and Right to Counsel NYC Coalitions in a joint statement.\n\nCurbed NY reports that 14,500 New Yorkers have pending eviction warrants and will be the first tenants evicted when the state’s eviction moratorium expires in October. Behind those tenants, there are 200,000 pending eviction cases in New York City alone that were filed before March 17 that can begin to progress through housing court.\n\nA coalition of healthcare providers is urging Governor Andrew Cuomo and state policymakers to pass legislation to prevent mass evictions. “Preventing evictions and moving towards a system that ensures safe, secure housing for all is an essential part of our continued response to COVID-19,” the coalition wrote in a letter to Governor Cuomo and state legislative leaders. Over 500 healthcare professionals signed a letter to the state Department of Health, urging the department to support eviction prevention legislation and investigate the impact of evictions on public health.\n\nAugust 25, 2020\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that households with children have been more likely to suffer COVID-19 job and income losses, contributing to higher rates of missed rent and debt payments, food insufficiency, and a greater need to dig into savings.\n\nOne week after a temporary eviction ban expired in New York, the state court system extended an eviction moratorium through October 1. The new order mandates that no existing or new eviction warrants can be executed until October and continues the suspension of proceedings in new eviction cases brought by landlords after March 17.\n\nAugust 19, 2020\n\nAs many as 400,000 families across New York City could end up in housing court as the state’s eviction moratorium partially expires on August 5. Governor Andrew Cuomo extended protections for tenants who have been impacted by the pandemic. Still, tenants must gather the necessary paperwork, find an attorney, and go to court to argue their case. The Wall Street Journal also reports that thousands of New Yorkers could be evicted in the coming weeks after the state’s eviction ban expires on August 5.\n\nCBS New York reports that, according to a new study, 1.5 million New Yorkers are unable to pay August rent and are at risk of eviction.\n\nAugust 11, 2020\n\nCurbed reports that technology and linguistic barriers are making New York’s emergency rent relief program inaccessible to those who need it most. Efforts to make the application accessible and inclusive do little to make up for the program’s strict eligibility requirements and convoluted application process.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio launched the Landlord-Tenant Mediation Project on July 21 to help workers impacted by the pandemic avoid eviction.
