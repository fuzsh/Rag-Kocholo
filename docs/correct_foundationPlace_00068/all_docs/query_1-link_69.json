        "text": "National I-Corps Teams applicants\n\nA team accepted into the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Innovation Corps (I-Corps™) National Teams training program is eligible to be awarded up to $50,000, which supports the team’s program participation including stipends and expenses for virtual and in-person customer discovery.\n\nThrough the seven-week program, teams engage with prospective customers, partners, and others in the ecosystem—evaluating the commercial potential for turning their technologies into successful products, processes and services.\n\nSubmit an executive summary\n\nIf you are eligible for national training but have not started the application process yet, submit an executive summary using the NSF I-Corps Teams Executive Summary Form.\n\nRespond to the solicitation\n\nIf you have already completed your interview with the I-Corps staff and have been invited to respond to the solicitation, do so at the link below.\n\nHow to apply\n\nForm a team.
