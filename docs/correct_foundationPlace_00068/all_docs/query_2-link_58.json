        "text": "Love national parks? There's a holiday for that! Join us for National Park Week, a nine-day celebration of everything \"parks\". Not just about more than 400 national parks nationwide of different shapes, sizes, and types. Also discover what the National Park Service does through our programs and partners to preserve natural and cultural heritage and provide recreational opportunities in places across the countryâ€”and even the world!\n\nNational Park Week is happening April 20 to April 28 this year. Entrance fees will be waived on April 20, 2024, to kick off the celebration and to encourage everyone to enjoy their national parks in person. National Park Service parks, programs, and partners will host events and activities all week! Follow National Park Week on social media and join the fun all week using #NationalParkWeek.\n\n2024 Theme Days\n\nEach day of National Park Week has a special theme to showcase many ways to experience, learn, or get involved with national parks and what we do outside of our park boundaries."
