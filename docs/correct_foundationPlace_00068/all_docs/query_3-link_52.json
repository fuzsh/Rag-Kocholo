        "text": "Beyond The Classroom\n\nOur academic programs offer real-world experience in a variety of fields, from journalism to archaeology to advertising. You can intern at ESPN, work on an archaeological dig in a neighboring community, or see your work in an ad campaign that airs around the world. These experiences will help you develop the skills and knowledge you need to succeed in your chosen field.\n\nCentral In The Community\n\nAt Central, you'll find opportunities to learn, grow, and make a difference. Through partnerships with local businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies, you can gain hands-on experience and make a real-world impact. Central is the perfect place to prepare for a successful future. With its commitment to community engagement, Central helps students become engaged citizens who are prepared to make a positive impact on the world.\n\nIn 2010, the Carnegie Foundation designated CCSU a Community Engaged Institution."
