        "meta_description": "NEW REQUIREMENT FOR REVIEW OF USAC DECISIONS: Any party (including, but not limited to entities filing an FCC Form 499, federal universal service program applicants, and service providers) that wishes to file an appeal of a USAC decision must first seek review of that decision by appealing directly to USAC before filing an appeal with the Commission. Parties seeking a waiver of Commission rules should submit waiver requests directly to the Commission instead of filing such requests with USAC (See 47 C.F.R. § 1.3). A party that has filed an appeal with USAC and received an adverse decision may, if it chooses, appeal USAC’s decision to the Commission. See Sections 54.719-54.725 of the Commission’s rules for further information regarding review of USAC decisions. Universal Service Program for High-Cost Areas The federal universal service high-cost program (also known as the Connect America Fund) is designed to ensure that consumers in rural, insular, and high-cost areas have access to modern communications networks capable of providing voice and broadband service, both fixed and mobile, at rates that are reasonably comparable to those in urban areas. The program fulfills this universal service goal by allowing eligible carriers who serve these areas to recover some of their costs from the federal Universal Service Fund. This pages serves as an archive of all high-cost releases, including releases concerning the Connect America Fund. The Connect America Fund page highlights certain Connect America Fund releases.",
