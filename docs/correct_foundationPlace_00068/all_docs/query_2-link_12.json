Her vision is that this matching gift will generate new funds for P2, ensuring long-term support for pollinators. Every first-time or increased donation made or pledged now through December 31, 2024 will be matched dollar-for-dollar. Please join Laurie to grow the Catalyst Fund - Creating a strong foundation for a brighter future.\n\nThe North American Pollinator Protection Campaign (NAPPC) is seeking nominations for eight prestigious awards: Pollinator Advocate Award (three countries), the Farmer-Rancher Pollinator Conservation Award (three countries), the Pollinator Roadside Management Award, and the Pollinator Electric Power Award.
