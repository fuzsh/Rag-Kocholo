        "text": "While students are still enjoying their summer break, Cobb County School leaders have already kicked off the new school year. This is the 10th year Superintendent Chris Ragsdale has led the annual kickoff event as superintendent of Georgia’s second-largest school district.\n\nWhen Superintendent Ragsdale took the job, Cobb teachers made less than the average teacher in the Atlanta metro. Today, Cobb teachers are the highest paid in the state, Cobb County schools are fully staffed, and Cobb students achieve at higher levels than their peers.\n\n“My philosophy is to invest in the team,” Superintendent Ragsdale said.\n\nOver the past decade, Cobb teacher pay raises have increased by more than 50% thanks to the historic and healthy raises recommended by Superintendent Ragsdale and approved by the Cobb County School Board of Education.\n\n“All of the praise heaped on the Superintendent isn’t just words. The results are the proof. We retain our staff, they’re happy in their work, and our students’ success is proof that his philosophy and decision-making has been right all along,” said Board Chair Randy Scamihorn.\n\nFormer Board members, including a retired Georgia State Senator, joined the Cobb County School leaders at the kickoff event to congratulate Superintendent Ragsdale and thank him for his service.\n\nRetired Georgia State Senator Lindsey Tippins praised Superintendent Ragsdale for his decisive leadership, listening to the community, and providing stability to the nation’s 23rd-largest school district.\n\nGeorgia Board of Education member Scott Sweeney commended Superintendent Ragsdale for doing “what’s right” for students.\n\nAs part of his address to the room full of school leaders, Superintendent Ragsdale emphasized the District’s priorities, which help drive student success:\n\nEnsure that Cobb is the best place to teach, lead, and learn.\n\nSimplify our foundation for teaching and learning in order to prepare for innovation.\n\nUse data to make decisions.\n\nOne example of student success took the stage to inspire the veteran Cobb educators. Cobb County Schools graduate Kevin Paul Scott returned to Harrison High School, where he once attended as a student, to encourage the educators to remain focused on their purpose and why they serve as educators.\n\nBoard Chair Randy Scamihorn pointed to veteran teachers who inspired him when he was a new teacher. One of those teacher leaders, Dr. Liss Maynard, who became a long-serving principal, still serves Cobb students as Assistant Superintendent of South Side Elementary Schools.\n\nAs the inspiring finale to the 2024-2025 kick off, Superintendent Ragsdale surprised the educators with on-stage piano performance."
