        "text": "Attending Dodge City Community College helped me take classes with a small student to professor ratio. After graduation, it helped with a smooth transition to a larger university. It made sense economically and provided a stellar education at the same time.\"\n\n– Erin (Schneweis) Reece A.A., B.S., M.A.H.R.\n\nAs a single mother, I appreciated the opportunity to further my education in an affordable and supportive environment. I’m now working toward becoming an elementary school teacher in our local school district. DC3’s flexible course schedule is exactly what I needed to be able to go to school and work at the same time. I’m now on my way to becoming the first one in my family to graduate with a bachelor’s degree!”\n\n– Kierra Johnson Class of 2016, Associate of Applied Science, Early Childhood Education\n\nDC3 gave me the opportunity to study while participating in activities – like Danceline – that I enjoyed. It gave me the start that I needed to get me where I am now – very close to completing a 4-year degree from a large university.\"\n\n– Jessica Garcia Class of 2016, Associate of Applied Science - Speech\n\nAs a major in the U.S. Air Force and a former F-16 instructor pilot, I know excellence when I see it. The Dodge City Community College staff here in Arizona, both administrative and instructional, consistently demonstrate a commitment to excellence that matches the very best I’ve seen in the Air Force. Their eagerness to help students succeed, whether in the classroom or in the helicopter flight program, is unmatched by any other civilian program I know. The friendly, welcoming demeanor of the administrative team, combined with the knowledge and individualized effort of the instructors, provides every student a clear path to becoming a college-educated, professional helicopter pilot.\n\n– Terry Blakemore 2023 Flight Instructor Program Student\n\nDodge City Community College helped me to become who I am today. I chose DC3 because I was awarded a scholarship for golf. My coach instilled a toughness in me that I have today, pushing me to become a better person and man in all that I did. I am now giving back by being a high school math teacher and golf coach at Garden City High School.\"\n\n– Trenton Specht Class of 2011, Associate Degree of Science, GCHS Math Teacher\n\nThe friendly atmosphere this institution possessed from faculty and staff to other scholars have given me lifelong memories that I will cherish throughout my career. I enjoyed the way courses were set up so that none were overlooked.\"\n\n– Anthony Banks Class of 2011, General Studies Graduate, MBA\n\nI chose to attend Dodge City Community College based on the affordability as well as the convenience. When I graduated high school, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. Like many high school graduates in Southwest Kansas, I wasn't even sure what was available to me. DC3 provided the stepping stone from where I was at the time to where I didn't even know I wanted to be. DC3 bridged this gap in an affordable way and paved the way for my future success.\"\n\n– Neal Giebler Class of 2010, B.S. Information Networking, Solutions Delivery Analyst\n\nAttending Dodge City Community College was one of the best choices I made. It was affordable, close, and had a low student to professor ratio.\"\n\n– Kimber Berry Class of 2017, Associate of Arts Degree\n\nI chose DC3 because it's HOME and I was offered a scholarship to play in the band. As a photographer for the student newspaper, I worked the sidelines alongside the professional photographers and learned a lot about the business. After graduation, I became an intern at Rocking M Radio and in 2017, I became the General Manager. At DC3, the people I met and the connections I made because of my time at DC3, has made all the difference in my career.\"\n\n– Joshua Roesener Class of 2008, Associate of Applied Science Mass Communications\n\nMy recommendation to anybody would be if you’re going to go to cosmetology school—and you’re within a reasonable distance to Dodge City Community College—you need to choose DC3, because you’re going to leave with a world-class certification. The staff here do such a great job covering different topics, and they give you every resource you can imagine. There’s zero reason for you to fail at DC3.\"\n\n– Preston Stebens Class of 2022, Certificate, Cosmetology\n\nHaving a local option for college was very important to me – I couldn’t afford to leave the Dodge City area for school. Luckily, I was able to live and work locally while getting a quality education at the same time. While at DC3, I spent most of my time participating in the music department, learning music theory and participating in band and vocal music. Along with the great memories, I’ve retained my sight-singing skills, which still help me today.\"\n\n– Doug Austen Class of 1980, Associate, Controller-Finance\n\nGetting my certificate in early childhood education allowed me more options for employment. It also helped open doors and gave me the opportunity to find work in our local community.”\n\n– Crissa Salmans Class of 2002, Certificate, Early Childhood Education\n\nDodge City Community College was my first life choice as an independent person, and DC3 provided me with a strong foundation to emerge as a trusted business professional. Through 15 years of business ownership and years of volunteer work, I am so proud and happy to reflect upon the opportunities that DC3 brought to my eyes, as seeing is believing. I am a Conquistador forever!\"\n\n– Curtis J. Zerr Class of 1989, Associate of Arts in Business\n\nDC3 has helped me further my education and achieve my goal of graduation from a university. I chose DC3 because I had the opportunity to jumpstart my collegiate athletic career while getting my education. Since graduating from DC3, I have obtained 2 more degrees in Business Management and Human Resources. I am working towards my goal of becoming a CEO of a professional sports franchise.\"\n\n– Eddie Holland Jr. Class of 2013, Associate of Arts in Business, B.A. Business Mgmt and Human Resources\n\nI traveled to Dodge City for a visit all the way from Colorado and as soon as I met the staff, professors, my coaches and even the kitchen staff everyone treated me with so much respect and was incredibly welcoming, I knew in that moment that was what I wanted my college experience to be, and to this day I look back and I am so grateful for making the decision to be a Conq!\"\n\n– Luz Sanchez Class of 2016, Associate of Arts\n\nI wouldn’t have gotten to where I am today without the amazing faculty and learning environment at DC3. With the ongoing support of the instructors and staff, I was able to achieve more in the field of biochemistry than I ever thought was possible. I owe so much to the staff of DC3 for helping me transfer to Kansas State to complete my biochemistry degree with the help of the Bridges to the Future program. I am now working to get both a PhD in pharmaceutical science and a master’s degree in management of drug development. And I owe it all to DC3!\"\n\n– Larry Rodriguez Class of 2012, Associate of Science\n\nI chose DC3 not only because of it being local and the low price, but also because it offered the exact degree I was wishing to pursue. Thanks to the education I received, I was able to land my current position of IT Coordinator at another college shortly after graduation.\"\n\n– John Smithhisler Class of 2017, Associate of Applied Science, Computer Science"
