It departs on July 19.\n\nIt can accommodate 5,668 passengers on 18 decks.\n\nUtopia of the Seas was designed specifically for short three- and four-night cruises, something that is uncommon with larger ships.\n\nThis âattraction on water\" has 21 places to eat, 23 bars, five pools, three water slides and two casinos.\n\nUtopia is the sixth of Royal Caribbeanâs Oasis-class vessels.\n\nGrammy Award singer Meghan Trainor has been named Godmother of Utopia of the Seas and is joining media, travel agents and influencers for the launch."
