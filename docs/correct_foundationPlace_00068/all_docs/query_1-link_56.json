Click learn more to find out how you can compete and contribute to a great cause!\n\nFutbolito in the City powered by Shell Energy provides free soccer programming and free play to youth in the greater Houston area. Houston Dynamo FC and the Houston Dash will provide free coaching for kids ages 6-14 for 90 minutes, once a week for ten weeks (split into two five-week sessions). Participants will have the opportunity to receive prizes including Dynamo FC/Dash gear, tickets, autographs and the chance to meet Dynamo FC/Dash players. Register for one location or all of the locations below to be a part of the fun!\n\nThe Kicks for Kids program offers businesses the opportunity to bring underprivileged children out to a Houston Dynamo or Houston Dash game. Through the program, corporations have the ability to purchase tickets to upcoming Dynamo or Dash home matches, which Dynamo Charities then distributes to local children's charities and schools. These valuable donations allow children, who would not otherwise be able to, the opportunity to enjoy a positive morale-building experience at Shell Energy Stadium.\n\nDynamo Charities is excited to bring back the 50/50 Raffle to every Houston Dynamo FC Home game.Â During each Houston Dynamo FC home game, one lucky fan will win 50% of the net proceeds for that night, with the other 50% going back to support Dynamo Charities.\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us for our 2ndÂ Annual Boots and Suits Celebrations.Â Thanks to your incredible generosity we were able to raise over $100,000 to help support Dynamo and Dash Charities and the programs and pillars that we support.Â We look forward to seeing everyone at next yearâs event.Â Please check back later for more details!\n\nThe Dynamo and Dash Goals school assembly program is designed to educate elementary and middle school aged students about the importance of healthy eating & wellness through the power of soccer. Each appearance will last one hour and consist of a presentation filled with interactive activities for up to 100 students led by a Houston Dynamo or Dash representative. Every student will receive a Dynamo and Dash Goals poster and a Dynamo and Dash branded item to go home with.\n\nThroughout the season, with the help of MLS Works and TUDN, Allstate's Every Save Makes a Difference program ensured that every save during a nationally televised Dynamo game sent $500 worth of soccer equipment to a Houston-area school in need. The 2022 season saw overÂ $10,000 worth of equipment be donated.\n\nThe Dynamo & Dash Kickstart STEM program is an educational curriculum aimed at encouraging students to learn about Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) concepts with a focus on using soccer as an educational tool.\n\nFor any questions or further assistance, please email us at charities@houstondynamo.com.
