        "text": "I know of no other place to post this as I suspect it will get no response or very little support.\n\nWhile I do not understand in the last 6-9 months why there are fewer and fewer quality positions for expert HR professionals and the few that are posted have a ridiculous budget of $5-$10/hr, I do understand that there is more competition, and clients are trying to find the cheapest fix.\n\nAfter sending many proposals for expert HR Consultation (in the past, I've always been contacted for at least an initial interview), and spending ridiculous sums of money just to get my name before a client, I receive 1-2 indications that someone has looked at my proposal.\n\nBut the heighth of disgust is when a client messages me, seems very excited that he has finally found someone who understands state employment law, sets a specific interview time for me and then treats me so disrespectfully not to show up or even communicate with me. Oh by the way, this same client, asked me to go off UpWork to schedule a zoom call, and I explained UpWork's policy. I showed him how to access the zoom link on UpWork, he acknowledged through a message, saying he would set a calendar reminder to login at 4 pm cdt last Friday afternoon. I even postponed a weekly client update call just to give us the chance to talk.\n\nAt 3:55 pm on 7/12/24, I sent him the zoom link; was ready for interview. At 4:03, I sent him message that I was waiting on call; at 4:13, I sent him another message, asking if we had miscommunicated time and asking him to propose another time. To date, I have not had the courtesy of a single response from him.\n\nThis is a SaaS startup client that suggested to me that they treat their employees well. While I understand that business circumstances sometimes prevent a call from taking place, it is so disrespectful of me as a person and as a professional to be \"stood up\" with no explanation. If he hired someone else, all he had to do is to communicate.\n\nI don't work for clients who have such low regard for people and I suspect I dodged a bullet."
