Go for the Gold in Lake Placid (Adirondacks)\n\nCredit: @my_focal_points on Instagram\n\nThere's \"snow\" better place than Lake Placid!

Evans Brewing, which features a massive fireplace that stretches all the way to the ceiling or gather ‘round the blazing fire pits on the patio at Woodstock’s Tinker Street Tavern.\n\n6.
