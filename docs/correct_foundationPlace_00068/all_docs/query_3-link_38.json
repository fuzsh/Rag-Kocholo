        "text": "The two basic types of damage to the bladder by trauma are bruises and tears.\n\nBlunt injury (a bruise) is damage caused by blows to the bladder. Penetrating injury (a tear) is damage caused by something piercing through the bladder.\n\nAlmost everyone who has a blunt injury to the bladder will see blood in the urine. Those with penetrating injury may not actually see bleeding. There may be pain below the belly button, but many times the pain from other injuries makes the bladder pain hard to notice. If there’s a large hole in the bladder and all of the urine leaks into the abdomen, it’s impossible to pass urine. In women, if the injury is severe enough, the vagina may be torn open as well as the bladder. If this happens, urine may leak from the bladder through the vagina. Blood may also come out of the vagina in this case.\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\nHard to start urinating\n\nWeak urine stream\n\nPainful urination\n\nFever\n\nSevere back pain\n\nWhen the bladder is empty, the bones of the pelvis protect it from blows to the lower abdomen. As it fills, though, the top of the bladder rises into the abdomen where it’s less protected. In children, the pelvic bones aren’t fully developed, so it’s more easily injured than adults. If the pelvis is hit with a force great enough to break the pelvic bones, the bladder may be injured even if it’s empty.\n\nThe most common ways the bladder is injured are:\n\nCar crashes\n\nFalls from high places\n\nHeavy object falling on the lower abdomen\n\nYou can prevent bladder trauma from a car crash by wearing a seat belt properly. The seat belt should be worn as a lap belt, and not across the belly. During a car crash, passengers with a full bladder wearing a seat belt around the belly may have the force of the crash focus on the full bladder.\n\nThe bladder can also be hurt by being pierced from the outside (\"penetrating trauma\"). Some causes of penetrating trauma are:\n\nBullets\n\nKnives\n\nShrapnel\n\nIEDs (improvised explosive devices)\n\nThe treatment for bladder trauma depends on the type of damage.\n\nBlunt injury is damage caused by blows to the bladder. This bruises the bladder.\n\nPenetrating injury is damage caused by something piercing through the bladder. This tears the bladder.\n\nContusion\n\nMost of the time, the bladder wall doesn’t tear and is only bruised. The only sign will be bloody urine. Your health care provider may just leave a wide catheter in the bladder so clots can pass. Once the urine becomes clear, the catheter will be taken out if there aren’t any other reasons to leave it in.\n\nIntraperitoneal Rupture\n\nIf the tear is on the top of the bladder, the hole will usually open to the part of the abdomen that holds the liver, spleen, and bowel. Urine leaking into the abdomen is a serious problem. This tear can be sewn closed with surgery. A catheter is left in the bladder for up to 2 weeks after surgery to allow the bladder to rest. The tube will either come out through the urethra or out through the skin below the belly button.\n\nExtraperitoneal Rupture\n\nIf the tear is at the bottom or side of the bladder, the urine will leak into the tissues around the bladder instead of the abdominal cavity. Complex injuries of this type should be repaired with surgery. But often it can be treated by simply placing a wide catheter into the bladder to keep it empty. The urine and blood drain into a collection bag. It usually takes at least 10 days for the bladder to heal. The catheter is left in the bladder until an X-ray shows that the leak has sealed. If the catheter doesn’t drain properly, surgery is needed.\n\nPenetrating Injuries\n\nInjury to the bladder from a bullet or other penetrating object is usually fixed with surgery. Most of the time, other organs in the area will be injured and need repair as well. After surgery, a catheter is left in the bladder to drain the urine and blood until the bladder heals."
