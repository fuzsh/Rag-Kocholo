        "text": "OVIEDO, Fla. â A+ Teacher Tenesha Wells-Eason knows that early learning is important for little ones to build a strong foundation for their future.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nTenesha Wells-Eason says teaching was a calling for her\n\nWells-Eason says teaching allows her to be creative and innovative\n\nShe travels across Seminole county to conduct story times\n\nHereâs how you can nominate an A+ Teacher ð\n\nShe is the teacher on assignment for the early learning department for the Great Start Program for Seminole County Public Schools.\n\nWells-Eason says her students are not required to be still.\n\nâI want the families to know that itâs okay that the babies want to move around. They want to run around a little bit because thatâs what theyâre supposed to do, and thatâs how they learn,â she said. âI love that teaching allows me to be creative. Innovative.â\n\nHer classroom is not a traditional one. She travels across Seminole County to conduct story times.\n\nâThe purpose of the program is to build language skills in our babies. So I want them to make sure they take away solid reading skills or language skills; being able to use vocabulary words before they enter pre-K.â\n\nThe children arenât the only ones who are learning.\n\nâOf course, my other students are the parents. So I want them to take away knowing they are their childâs first teacher. So, I want them to know how to advocate for their child before they enter school, so this space is great for teaching them those strategies, those skills,â Wells-Eason said.\n\nWells-Eason uses books, songs, rhymes and plays to show parents how to build strong language skills in their kids. Overall, thatâs what itâs all about â learning.\n\nâThereâs no other better job than teaching,â she said."
