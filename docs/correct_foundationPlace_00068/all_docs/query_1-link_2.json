Every young person at Covenant House receives a warm bed, food, health and wellness services, a case manager, and, most important of all, unconditional love and absolute respect.\n\nShelter is Only the Beginning\n\nCovenant House's doors are open 24/7 to all young people who need housing and help, regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. From crisis to care: We help young people achieve stability and Independence.\n\nAs many as 4.2 million young people will experience a period of homelessness this year in the U.S. alone. The causes of homelessness are complex, and many of the most vulnerable young people in our communities face the greatest risk."
