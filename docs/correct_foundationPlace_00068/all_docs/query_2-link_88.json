        "text": "The box office at Radio City Music Hall is currently open Monday through Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., and closed on Sunday. Box office hours are adjusted during the Christmas Spectacular season. Please check back in early October for adjusted hours.\n\nFor additional assistance, please contact Guest Relations at [email protected] or 212-465-6225.\n\nAccessible seating may be secured by contacting the Radio City Music Hall Accessibility Services Department at [email protected] or 888-609-7599, Monday through Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. ET, and Saturday and Sunday between 10:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. ET.

For more information, please contact Garden of Dreams at 212-465-4170 or [email protected]. Please note, since the Foundation benefits children, single tickets cannot be accepted; therefore, a minimum of two tickets per performance must be donated. The Foundation can only accommodate said donations if given notice at least three business days in advance of the performance. Your contribution is tax deductible to the extent permitted by law.\n\nRadio City Music Hall does not have a formal dress code. We do ask, however, that you use your best personal judgment when dressing for the Christmas Spectacular.\n\nCostumes are permitted with some exceptions. To ensure a safe and positive experience for all guests, full-face coverings are permitted only after clearing security and must be removed if requested by security personnel. Large costumes or headpieces, as well as full face paint, fake weapons and any other hazardous or distracting items, which may be determined at the sole discretion of our security personnel, are NOT permitted.\n\nTaking photographs or videos (with a traditional camera, cell phone or any other device) is not permitted during the performance.\n\nFor the safety of the performers and as a courtesy to your fellow patrons, we ask that guests please silence and put away all cell phones for the duration of the show, and refrain from using their phone or texting during the performance.\n\nThe Christmas Spectacular is an immersive experience that may include confetti, pyrotechnics, smoke effects, flashing lights and drones. Such elements may aggravate certain medical or physical conditions, and guests should take into consideration if they have a history of discomfort or physical symptoms when experiencing these elements.\n\nRadio City Music Hall has partnered with KultureCity to improve our ability to assist and accommodate guests with sensory needs. Weighted lap pads and sensory bags, containing special KCVIP badges, fidget tools, noise canceling headphones and other resources, are available to borrow at no cost by leaving an ID at our Guest Services Desk in the Grand Foyer.\n\nPlease contact Guest Relations at 212-465–6225 or [email protected] should you have additional questions.\n\nRadio City Music Hall is committed to meeting the needs of our guests and creating an enjoyable and unforgettable experience for all.
