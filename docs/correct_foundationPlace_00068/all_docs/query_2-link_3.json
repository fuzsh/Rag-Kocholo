All five partners pledged to invest to build and maintain 50 mini-soccer pitches in all five boroughs and provide free programming for children focused on promoting healthy eating habits, active living, and mentorship.\n\nNew York City FCâs new 50/50 Raffle program allows fans to support City in the Community by contributing to the growing charity foundation and winning half of the proceeds of the winning jackpot. For each New York City FC match, one lucky fan will win half of the proceeds of the 50/50 raffle for that match, with the other half benefiting CITC. With your support, we can continue to make a difference."
