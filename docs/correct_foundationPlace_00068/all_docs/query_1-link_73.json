        "text": "Begin your day at LeanIX Connect On Tour by picking up your name badge at our registration desk. Enjoy a cup of warm coffee while you settle in, acquaint yourself with the venue, and get ready for a day filled with insightful sessions, networking opportunities, and knowledge sharing.\n\nIn the opening session, you'll discover technology's role in navigating a business environment facing disruption after disruption. Explore how transformative technology like AI can be leveraged as a catapult for growth and innovation despite this - setting you up to proactively manage whatever comes next. Best of all, we unpack this through the lens of the LeanIX product strategy within SAP and beyond for the year ahead. We're excited to have you join us as we lead technology transformation, together.\n\nImagine a world where IT surprises are a distant memory. Where business decisions are seamlessly translated into technology solutions, and vice versa. Today, many challenges arise from misaligned business and IT decisions that can lead to missed opportunities, operational disruptions and frustration. To avoid this, it is important to understand all dependencies between business processes and IT execution to assess the associated effects across all company levels, departments and employees. In this session, we will show you how to recognize and understand the correlations with the help of our solutions, and how you can solve them with an agile approach.\n\nEisnerAmper, an accounting and professional services company, is pursuing a private equity backed accelerated growth strategy. We are expanding our business service offerings and geographic footprint across the USA through a fast-paced stream of Mergers & Acquisitions. To support this growth strategy, the Enterprise Architecture team has leveraged LeanIX, developing policies & procedures which drive a convergent, target state, application portfolio. Through these efforts we have streamlined our M&A integration practice and enabled business transformation, providing transparency, reducing complexity, and ultimately cost for the firm.\n\nWe are seeing clients across industries deciding to invest in EA tooling to bring efficiency into their architecture teams and better align with business priorities. Many have chosen LeanIX, and we have been at the forefront of these implementations. Our approach leverages an agile product development methodology combined with a strong architecture foundation, and powered by the EY Transformation Realized Framework. During this session, we share real world examples and lessons learnt in these journeys from concept to product in as quick as 6 weeks.\n\nThe presence of technical debt means organizations cannot leverage new technological innovations like AI and cloud technologies. Companies accumulate technical debt through actions like maintaining multiple redundant applications or continuing with outdated or unsupported applications, often leading to high costs, system outages, lost productivity, and employee churn.\n\nIn this session we’ll discuss some of the best practices for evaluating and rationalizing tech debt to bolster large-scale digital transformations.\n\nIn today's digital-first age, organizations must continually adapt and innovate to stay ahead in the technology and competition. This requires close collaboration between IT and Business teams to ensure that technology solutions are aligned with core business objectives. Join us in this session where we will explore the common challenges when it comes to collaboration between IT and Business teams and how to overcome them, and share best practices to strengthen the relationship.\n\nIn this 60-minute workshop session, participants will explore how LeanIX can help them tackle the challenges of tech risk. Guided by experts, attendees will delve into the capabilities of LeanIX, learning how automation empowers organizations to manage and navigate the complexities of technological obsolescence effectively. Through hands-on demonstrations and interactive sessions, participants will discover how to identify, assess and address obsolete technologies. By the session's end, attendees will gain practical insights and strategies to optimize their tech landscapes, ensuring agility, resilience, and future-proofing in the face of rapid technological evolution.\n\nCollaboration plays a crucial role in enterprise architecture and successfully executing transformation plans. Join us in this interactive and hands on session guided by experts where you will learn how to foster collaboration between IT and Business teams, break down siloes and drive innovation using LeanIX. Together we will also explore different practical scenarios and how you can leverage collaboration capabilities within LeanIX to drive successful modernization of your application landscape. By the end of this workshop, you will gain actionable insights and be able to implement best practices between IT and Business teams to align application modernization efforts with business objectives and digital transformation goals.\n\nI’m leading an enterprise initiative called the Connected Enterprise. It consists of four main components of work – 1) perform business process analysis of our major processes identifying opportunities for improvement, 2) establish our systems of record and reference within those processes for our major data domains, 3) Set forth an application strategy and, 4) Establish an integration platform and competency enabling our app strategy. The overall objective is to publish an enterprise blueprint and roadmap that will drive our Connected Enterprise.\n\nEvery enterprise is balancing the imperative to apply AI to a myriad of potential use cases with the need to mitigate risks and adhere to internal and external AI policies. Enterprise architects are at the forefront of facilitating these objectives, which are frequently at odds. In this session, LeanIX will delve into how enterprise architects can approach AI within their ecosystems, navigate the tension between enabling innovation and avoiding risks, and outline how LeanIX is positioned to help architects tackle the challenges AI presents."
