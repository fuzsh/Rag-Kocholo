        "text": "Love Your Block (LYB) is a program that brings together city leaders and citizens to revitalize neighborhoods one block at a time. LYB Hartford partners with organizations, neighborhood groups, and residents. It is a mini-grant program that supports residents who want to make a difference in their community by funding projects focused on combating litter, activating vacant lots, and strengthening neighborhood pride. Ideal locations are gateway areas with high visibility and high-impact.\n\nHistory of Love Your Block\n\nHartford was one of ten cities chosen by Cities of Service to receive $25,000 in funding over two years (2019-2020) and two AmeriCorps VISTAs. Love Your Block Hartford's was designed to increase neighborhood pride by creating opportunities for residents to own and lead change in their community. We will achieve this by providing competitive mini-grants that support volunteer-led anti-litter projects.\n\nCities of Service is a former nonprofit and current research center at Johns Hopkins University that helps mayors build stronger cities by changing the way local government and citizens work together. Cities of Service helps their coalition cities tap into citizen insights, skills, and service to identify and solve critical public problems. Founded in 2009 by New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Cities of Service supports a coalition of more than 250 cities, representing more than 73 million people across the Americas and Europe. Since 2009, over 9,000 community members across dozens of cities have revitalized more than 2,200 blocks. They have removed 5.6 million pounds of trash, created 900 art displays, cleaned 60,000 square feet of graffiti, repaired over 70,000 square feet of community space, and maintained over 730,000 square feet of public space. Visit us at citiesofservice.org or follow us on Twitter @citiesofservice.\n\nAmeriCorps VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) members bring passion and perseverance where the need is greatest: to organizations that help eradicate poverty. AmeriCorps VISTA members serve as a catalyst for change, living and working alongside community members to meet our nation’s most pressing challenges and advance local solutions."
