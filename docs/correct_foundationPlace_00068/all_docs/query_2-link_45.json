        "text": "Welcome to KIPP NYC College Prep High School, where we see each student as unique. Our school strives to match what sparks their curiosity with what and how we teach. We go beyond traditional education, challenging their minds while nurturing their joy of learning. Our approach is centered on preparing every student for college, career, and beyond, celebrating all paths to a fulfilling life.\n\nWe believe in joining together with families and communities. These partnerships are vital in pursuing the more just world we all want to see. Every day, our College Prep students and alumni deploy their smarts and hearts to break through any barrier that dares stand between them and the future they want. Together, they are lighting ever-wider paths to opportunity and change.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our vibrant community, where every student’s potential is embraced and every path to success is celebrated.\n\nExtracurricular Activities:\n\nWe encourage students to explore over 25 clubs and student organizations, fostering diverse interests and abilities. Additionally, our leadership programs promote student voice, community service, and peer mentorship. Please click here to see the list of our clubs & student organizations!\n\nVisual and Performing Arts:\n\nWe offer a multitude of art electives in Visual Arts, Graphic Design, Music, Choir, Dance, and Drama. We provide students with introductory, advanced, and AP-level courses. Our after-school programs offer choir, dance, spoken word, drama, step, visual arts, yearbook, Fall play, and Spring musical. Students can participate in nearly a dozen school productions, competitions, and outside performances throughout the school year.\n\nAthletics:\n\nKIPP NYC College Prep offers a robust athletics program and was the first charter school to compete in the Public School Athletic League (PSAL). We offer football, soccer, volleyball, cheerleading, basketball, wrestling, baseball, softball, track, and lacrosse. We have varsity and junior varsity programs totaling over a dozen interscholastic sports teams. Additionally, we offer intramural flag football, basketball, and kickball to benefit students from team support in a less competitive setting. Approximately a quarter of our student body participates in our athletic program, and we have won city championships in Football, Men’s Varsity Basketball, Men’s Varsity Baseball, and Women’s Varsity Rugby.\n\nWe are committed to creating an environment where students thrive academically and personally.\n\nCollege Counseling:\n\nOur college counseling team supports students’ journey toward higher education and meaningful career paths. We understand the importance of individualized guidance in shaping our students’ futures. We provide a comprehensive college and career counseling department to ensure our students engage in enriching summer programming, develop individual career plans, are fully prepared for the SAT college entrance exam, and go on to enroll in a college or career opportunity that meets their interests, abilities, and financial needs. Students take part in a two-year college readiness sequence, consisting of College and Career Readiness (CCR) or Foundations of Career Development (FOCD) in their junior year and Senior College and Career Counseling (SCCC) in their senior year.\n\nCareer Counseling:\n\nThe Workforce Development Staff ensures that our students are well-prepared for the demands of the professional world. The Career Counseling Staff also provides valuable resources and opportunities to guide students through their postsecondary years.\n\nOur dedicated career counselors work with students from 5th grade onwards, helping them reflect on skills and passions. Students are exposed to meaningful summer programs, internships, and volunteer experiences.\n\nKIPP Forward:\n\nKIPP Forward supports students in discovering what a fulfilling life means to them and then breaking through any barrier that stands in their way of achieving it. We help students choose and prepare for the educational and career paths that fit their goals and purposes. Once on their way, KIPP Forward teams help alumni tackle academic, social, and financial challenges they might encounter while pursuing their dreams.\n\nWe currently support over 2,000 high school students and over 4,200 high school alumni of KIPP, Achievement First, and a growing number of partner organizations through 1:1 advising and robust programming related to College and Career Readiness, College Success, and Career Services. Learn about our KIPP Forward program here.\n\nFresh Meals Everyday:\n\nWe provide our students with nutritious, delicious, and, most importantly, homemade meals in the school’s state-of-the-art kitchen by professionally trained chefs. The kitchen staff includes College Prep alumni and student’s family members. All meals for students are free; we provide breakfast and lunch at no cost. Breakfast options include cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, assorted bagels, and a hot breakfast. For lunch, we offer a main entree that consists of protein, grain, and a vegetable with assorted fruit options. Students can build their salad at our salad bar or try a prepared salad. Fresh milk and filtered water are available with every meal. In addition to our standard menu, we offer vegetarian and vegan options daily.\n\nPlant and Environmental Club:\n\nThe Plant and Environmental Club are growing fresh herbs, like lettuce, tomatoes, kale, and parsley, in a vertical hydroponic system! When ready to harvest, they provide nutritious greens to the school’s kitchen to prepare meals for the KIPP NYC community."
