During the 2024-2025 FIRST season, FIRST® DIVE℠ presented by Qualcomm, teams will use their STEM and collaboration skills to explore life beneath the surface of the ocean. Along the way, we’ll uncover the potential in each of us to strengthen our community and innovate for a better world with healthy oceans.\n\nExplore the Future\n\nIn REEFSCAPE℠ presented by Haas, a new challenge launching January 4, 2025, FIRST Robotics Competition teams will use their engineering skills to strengthen one of the ocean’s most diverse habitats – making waves to build a better world. Registration is now open.\n\nMAKE WAVES IN REEFSCAPE\n\nDownload and share logos, social graphics, posters, and more to take your season celebration even further.\n\nFIND ADDITIONAL MENTORS\n\nCreate a team profile on the FIRST Mentor Network sponsored by NI to find additional support."
