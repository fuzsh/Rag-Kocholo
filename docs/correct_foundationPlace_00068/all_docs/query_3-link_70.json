        "text": "Phil Mickelson is Buffalo attorney Joseph Hanna’s favorite professional golfer.\n\nSo, Hanna was a bit in awe when he received an email from Mickelson’s representatives about an opportunity to possibly combine forces.\n\nThe two have in common the efforts they have each made over the years to support military personnel and their families.\n\nHanna has delivered millions of golf balls and clubs to troops overseas through running Bunkers for Baghdad, and Mickelson, the six-time majors winner, and his wife, Amy, started Birdies for the Brave, a military outreach initiative.\n\n“For the last 15 years, we, from afar, have admired Phil and Amy Mickelson for all they have done for our military members and troops around the globe. … And here we are today as partners,” said Hanna, president and founder of Bunkers in Baghdad. “We’re now working with a generational golfer, and certainly someone I have appreciated for many years.”\n\nThe partnership kicked off with an event in Houston for 40 military families, where children of Air Force and Navy personnel decorated golf balls and wrote letters to be sent to troops alongside golf equipment. They also received golf lessons from Mickelson and his LIV Golf team, the HyFlyers Golf Club.\n\nAs part of Bunkers for Baghdad's Bunkers Buddies program, children send personalized messages to troops overseas and here at home, helping plant the seed with the next generation about the importance of kindness and service to others. Thousands of students and teachers at around 2,000 schools nationwide have participated in the program.\n\nMickelson, whose father was a Navy aviator, can be a polarizing figure. He faced fierce scrutiny as one of the first golfers to leave the PGA Tour for LIV Golf, which is financed by the Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. But Hanna said he was “amazed by how generous (Mickelson) was with his time.”\n\n“I’ve been around a lot of professional athletes, entertainers and musicians as part of my day job over the last 20 years, and (Mickelson’s) graciousness and interest and empathy towards what military families do day in and out for our country was phenomenal to see,” Hanna said.\n\nAlso attending the event was former professional golfer and current broadcaster David Feherty, who served as the inspiration for the idea behind Bunkers in Baghdad.\n\nBunkers in Baghdad has shipped 15 million golf balls and 1.5 million golf clubs to members of the nation’s military over the past 15 years. It has collected new and used golf equipment for troops stationed in 76 different countries and every state and for Wounded Warriors programs across the nation to aid in the rehabilitation of injured veterans.\n\nThe organization has partnered with the likes of Callaway Golf, Topgolf and the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres, as well as Dick’s Sporting Goods.\n\nDespite having three young kids of his own at home and a busy day job working for Goldberg Segalla, Hanna said he is motivated to keep the nonprofit going because the work has created so many meaningful connections with troops deployed all over the world.\n\n“As long as we keep getting requests from our troops and our veterans, we’ll keep going,” he said. “It’s the least we can do for all that they do for us.”\n\nBeau Fleuve teams with New Era Cap\n\nBeau Fleuve Music & Arts has teamed with New Era Cap to release a limited collection of Beau Fleuve branded headwear.\n\nThe Buffalo rooted company is releasing a series of custom designed caps in anticipation of hosting the eighth Annual Beau Fleuve Celebration Weekend in August.\n\nNew Era, also a Buffalo company, selected three regional artists to be part of the Celebration Cap activation, and these artists curated cap side patches to be featured on the Beau Fleuve cap. They are Patti Thomas, Ghost Room Art; Tyshaun Tyson, Lfthanded Bandit; and Emeka Wajed, MadebyMek.\n\nIn addition to the event Aug. 25, the collection will be featured at several Beau Fleuve lead up event activations throughout the summer and a pop-up shop at the New Era flagship store in downtown Buffalo.\n\nDiscflect championships to be hosted in Buffalo\n\nThe 24th PDFA Discflect World Championship tournament is coming to Buffalo in August.\n\nThe Professional Discflect Association and Kan Jam will host the open tournament Aug. 24 at Buffalo RiverWorks, 359 Ganson St., Buffalo. It will feature two divisions (Amateur and Pro), with no prior qualification required.
