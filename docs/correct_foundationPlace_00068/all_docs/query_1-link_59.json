The icing on the cake was the electrifying presence of DJ KING SZN, De Andre King, who took the turntables to new heights and brought the house down.\n\nIt was inspiring to see so many young men of color connecting and networking with industry professionals, like our own Executive Director Danny Rojas, sharing their experiences and aspirations. We are proud of our Scholars for their hard work and dedication to changing the landscape of technology.\n\nEVENTS\n\nAll Star Code @ Congressional App Challenge\n\nOur own Executive Director Danny Rojas gave the keynote address at the Congressional App Challenge, a prestigious prize in student computer science that showcases the best and brightest apps created by high school students across the country1. Danny shared his inspiring story of how he became passionate about coding and diversity in tech.\n\nWe were also proud to see three of our 2022 Scholars from Tennessee being selected as winners of the challenge Shaun Murray, Jared Murray, and Johnathon Sherrill created an app called EcoBalance, which is a game that teaches players about the importance of maintaining a healthy balance of ecological systems. They demonstrated their app at the Capitol Visitor Center, along with over 300 other award-winning coders from 46 states.\n\nWe want to congratulate our Scholars and Danny for their amazing achievements and for representing All Star Code at this national event.

A new study finds that 80% of the US workforce will have at least 10% of their work affected by GPTs, which are AI models that can generate text that mimics a human author. This could have significant economic, social, and policy implications for workers across all wage levels.\n\nHow can we prepare for this change and ensure that humans are not left behind by the robots? In this article, S. Mitra Kalita argues that we need to combine ethics and economics, and focus on advancing human talent to use AI more effectively. She also highlights some examples of how AI is already being used in various domains, such as sales, recruitment, and journalism.\n\nThe article also features the perspective of Danny Rojas, the Executive Director of All Star Code, a nonprofit organization that aims to empower young men of color with skills and mentorship in the tech sector. Rojas shares his vision of how AI can be used to create more opportunities and social mobility for underrepresented groups. He says:\n\n\"We believe technology is the catalyst for turning today’s underrepresented into tomorrow’s leaders. Facts are facts: 55% of All Star Code Scholars over the age of 18 are first generation college students. We’re not just teaching them how to code; we’re teaching them how to think critically, creatively, and collaboratively. We’re teaching them how to be leaders in a world where AI is ubiquitous.\"\n\nNews\n\nLearn More About Our Summer Intensive\n\nAre you looking for a way to gain an edge in the innovation economy?
