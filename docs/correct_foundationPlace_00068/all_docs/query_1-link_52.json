Especially for those who protect us all, the hard-workers who get it done every day, the home teams we cheer for, and of course, family and friends. Our mission is to serve you the most authentic, mouth-watering all-American food that’s done right.\n\nGiving Back\n\nOur young men and women in uniform. Veterans who served with honor. Our local Police, Firefighters and First Responders who make Our Community a better place to live. They’re the people we respect most of all, so MISSION BBQ tries to give back in return. From fundraisers to service projects, we have your back, donating over $25,000,000 supporting vital charities since opening our doors in 2011.\n\nA Servant's Heart\n\nA Servant's Heart\n\nA Servant's Heart\n\nSuzanne is an inspiration to Our Teammates. She prioritizes showing how much she cares about people, even if it means flying out of the state to spread positivity and appreciation. “They, on their own time, went to visit one of the Tuskegee Airmen to thank him and to acknowledge him for what he had done for our country,” said SHL Jackie about a trip Suzanne organized to spread some love to an American Hero.\n\nStories of Service\n\nLee Humiston proudly tours his museum sharing the history that shaped the world through the eyes of veterans and their mementos and memorabilia. He knows the importance of teaching history to future generations and he uses his collection to keep memories of his fellow veterans alive. “That’s what I want to leave. So that after I’m gone, kids can come through here, the grandkids of people who have been here, and see this and understand what American history really is.”"
