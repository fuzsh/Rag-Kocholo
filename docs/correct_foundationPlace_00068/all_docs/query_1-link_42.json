Applicants should have an advanced degree and at least five years of professional work experience.

For example, a social justice advocate working at a nonprofit organization, a lawyer with experience at a large law firm, and an environmental scientist with experience working on climate policy, could all be strong candidates if they demonstrate superior academic and professional credentials and a strong interest in public service. Of course, applicants who have studied public administration, political science, or public policy would also be competitive. All competitive applicants will demonstrate a strong interest in a career in public policy, substantial accomplishments in a professional environment, and notable academic achievement.\n\nThe diversity of applicant qualifications reflects the needs of our state government, which seeks talented leadership for agencies as varied as the Department of Environmental Conservation, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Children and Family Services.
