        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. â An organization that provides services for homeless people in Orlando will continue those services uninterrupted after a major boost in funding.\n\nSALT CEO and Executive Director Eric Camarillo said in early July he had planned to suspend the nonprofitâs shower and laundry services, but while working to raise about half a million dollars, SALT got a $300,000 donation from Big Nova Foundation â enough to keep its services going.\n\nâEveryone deserves the basic dignity of a shower and clean clothes,â said Big Nova Foundation Executive Director Sarah Asma. âWe are looking forward to being a partner with SALT into the future to ensure that these services and the many others they provide are not only continued but expanded. Our greatest hope is that our confidence in Eric and his staff through this grant will inspire others in our community to support their work.â\n\nThe organization continues to face a funding shortfall after the ending of COVID-19 relief money it had been receiving up until this year, but Camarillo said Big Nova is a step in the direction of recurring funds.\n\nâItâs not just a one and done â theyâre here to stay,â said Camarillo. âTheyâre helping with this, but this is the beginning of what I think is a beautiful partnership with SALT and the Big Nova Foundation to really end homelessness here in Central Florida.â\n\nQuattara Jones recently became homeless, and now sleeps underneath an overpass in downtown Orlando. Jones said sheâs thankful sheâll continue to get the help she needs until she can find somewhere to live.\n\nShe said taking a shower at SALTâs mobile shower unit is one of the bright spots of her day.\n\nâYouâre filthy from not being able to bathe daily and you get that shower â I mean you feel half human,â said Jones.\n\nJones also gets her clothes cleaned at SALTâs mobile laundry unit. And with SALT Outreach more secure financially, she believes sheâll have a better chance to find a permanent home, sooner than later.\n\nâIt lifts you up â it gives you hope,â said Jones. âI know it gives me hope because if this place wasnât here, I wouldâve given up a long time ago.â\n\nâWe need plenty of funding because without that a lot of people donât have a place to go, a lot of people donât have resources and this is a good place to get resources â anything they need basically,â said David Johnson, another recipient of SALTâs services.\n\nCamarillo said even with the huge donation, the nonprofit is still in the process of trying to raise another $200,000 so they can have enough money to keep their services going for as long as theyâre needed."
