        "text": "Timeshifter uniquely combines the only elements shown to reset the circadian clock (light-dark exposure and melatonin supplements), and alleviate the symptoms (light, melatonin, caffeine, naps), and not surprisingly, the sum of their effects is greater than the individual parts. There are many scientific studies attesting to the benefits of our approach, and our algorithm has been used for many years by NASA, F1 drivers and elite athletes, and more recently by astronauts and mission controllers at Axiom Space.\n\nOur Chief Scientist is Steven W. Lockley, Ph.D. Dr. Lockley is a Neuroscientist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, an Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. With almost 30 years of research experience, he is considered an international authority on how to reset the circadian clock.\n\nAny jet lag ‘solution’ that does not have light and light avoidance as the central planks of the advice will not help you adapt to new time zones faster. Some advice may aim at improving sleep or reducing sleepiness, but this is not addressing the circadian rhythm disruption which is the underlying cause of jet lag — a little like treating a fever without addressing the underlying infection. This may seem to help in the short-term but is not the most efficient or effective solution and does not address other consequences of jet lag such as digestive disorders and immune problems.\n\nGiven that appropriately timed light exposure and light avoidance are the only proven way to alleviate jet lag, many of the common ‘tips’ are either ineffective or may even make your jet lag worse. For example, knocking yourself out with sleeping pills, or getting on the new time zone as quickly as possible, or following the light-dark pattern on the plane, do not work.\n\nSleep equals dark as far as the circadian clock is concerned – when you close your eyes to sleep, you block light information going from the eyes to the brain - so if you sleep at a time when you should be seeing light, you will shift your circadian clock in the wrong direction and make jet lag worse. Advice focused only on sleep, without resetting the circadian clock, assumes that insomnia and sleepiness are the only symptoms of jet lag, which is not the case. Sleep (and therefore dark) timing should be scheduled as part of the overall light-dark exposure plan designed to reset the circadian clock, and end jet lag, as quickly as possible.\n\nMany claims have been made about diets or fasting being able to reset the clock. These claims are based on studies of nocturnal (night-active) rodents which cannot easily be translated to (day-active) humans. Food does not reset the circadian clock in the brain and there is currently no accepted method for using food — or fasting — for resetting circadian rhythms.\n\nThe evidence for this is found in studies of totally blind people, who Dr. Lockley has studied extensively. Totally blind people have no light information reaching the brain and therefore cannot synchronize the circadian rhythms to the 24-hour day. This results in a clinical disorder called non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder. They still get this disorder even though they eat their meals on a regular 24-hour pattern; if food could reset their circadian clock, they would not develop non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, yet they do, showing that food is not an effective method to reset the clock.\n\nWhile advice on what and when to eat may be helpful in reducing the metabolic consequences of jet lag, caused by eating at the wrong biological time, it will not alleviate the underlying cause.\n\nThe light-dark cycle is the strongest time cue for resetting the circadian clock. Depending on when you see light, it can shift your circadian clock either earlier or later. For many trips, seeing light when you land can shift the clock in the wrong direction, making jet lag worse and prolonging the number of days it will take you to adapt. You might even get 'stuck’ at the wrong time, ruining your vacation or business trip. The timing of light exposure is therefore not intuitive and generic advice does not work – proper advice requires estimation of your internal body clock time in order to schedule sunlight (or any light) exposure properly.\n\nJet lag is more than just a sleep disorder – it affects all the biological systems that the circadian clock controls. Focusing on sleep alone will not be effective and, given that sleep blocks light to the circadian clock when you close your eyes, means that sleep at the wrong time will send the wrong light signal to the brain, making jet lag worse.\n\nIf you shifted sleep for many days leading up the trip it might help, but in the real world, this approach is not practical. For example, a 6-hour time change from New York to Paris would need you to sleep from 5pm to 1am leading up the trip and staying awake all night. When coming back, you would need to sleep in Paris from 5am to 1pm to adapt back to New York time, again an impractical solution. Our Practicality Filter ensures that sleep is scheduled at a time when it will help with your circadian adaptation AND is practical to stick to.\n\nYes! The astronauts are real and are investors in Timeshifter.\n\nFormer NASA Astronaut and Chief Astronaut at Axiom Space, Commander Michael López-Alegría, has completed five space missions on Space X, Space Shuttle, and Soyuz. He holds NASA records for most extravehicular activities (EVAs) or ”spacewalks” (10), cumulative EVA time (67 hours, 40 minutes), and for the 3rd longest spaceflight at 215 days!\n\nAnother legendary astronaut you might have seen on our site is Professor Mike Massimino. Mike has successfully completed two of the hardest space missions – both to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. He also was the first person to tweet from space! Today, Mike is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University.\n\nAnother one of our investors, Dr. Smith Johnston, is a former NASA flight surgeon and Chief Medical Officer at Axiom Space. He was the head of the Fatigue and Longevity Programs at NASA for many years and developed the first circadian desynchrony program to help NASA astronauts and mission controllers manage jet lag, shift work disorder and circadian challenges during space light. Our Chief Scientist, Dr. Steven W. Lockley, continues to assist NASA today.\n\nTimeshifter is tightly connected with astronauts because circadian science has been a critical part of enhancing the safety and performance of astronauts on space missions for many decades, as NASA understand the critical importance of circadian rhythm management to reduce the safety and health risks of clock disruption. Circadian plans are carefully crafted to help astronauts reduce jet lag when traveling for training visits, align with rocket launch and spacewalk timing, and control their day-night cycle when living aboard the International Space Station, including shifting their schedules for space walks, docking and undocking. Mission controllers are provided with circadian plans to support these missions 24/7, without compromising anyone’s safety."
