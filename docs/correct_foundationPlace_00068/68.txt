Every hour of your time helps make our city more equitable.

When you volunteer with New York Cares, you’re not just “helping out.” You help make your city more resilient by giving more New Yorkers options for how they work, live, and play. Greater equity means more options, and every hour of your time goes a long way.

New York City is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the country. So, yes, representation matters. A lot.

We see and celebrate diversity in all its forms. Representation reflects the community—and yields a far more positive impact. We gather ideas and insights from a wide range of individuals and community partners with different backgrounds and perspectives to find the best solutions to pressing community needs.

☀️ Our Community

Every day, thousands of New Yorkers show up for the causes and organizations they believe in. Learn more about what inspires them to serve, and how you can join the ranks.
