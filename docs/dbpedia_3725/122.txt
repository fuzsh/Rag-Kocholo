Eastleigh Football Club are delighted to announce the signing of winger, Enzio Boldewijn, following his departure from Sutton United.

Born in Amsterdam, Enzio began his youth career as SC Voorland before he joined Utrecht in 2011 and went out on loan to Den Bosch in 2012.

After spending time at Almere City, the Dutchman moved to England for the first time where he joined Crawley Town and went on to make 91 appearances, scoring 15 goals and assisting numerous goals during his time.

In 2018, the attacker completed a move to Notts County where he made 112 appearances over three years. During his time in Nottingham, he scored 19 goals and again, proved to be a threat from the wide area.

Most recently, the 30-year-old spent time at Sutton United, making 84 appearances during his spell in South London.

Upon joining the Spitfires, Boldewijn said: “I’m very excited to get started. The whole project that the team is in having just missed out on playoffs last season.”

He added: “Everything fits at the moment and I’m happy to be here.”
