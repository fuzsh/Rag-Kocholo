        "text": "Almere, 12 November 2023 – Since 2015, Yanmar has proudly been the stadium sponsor of Almere City FC. This June, promotion to the Eredivisie, the Dutch premier league, marked a historic achievement for both the young club and the city of Almere. On November 12, during the blockbuster encounter with Ajax Amsterdam, Yanmar also served as a match sponsor. A spectacular Sunday at the Yanmar Stadium.\n\nTo heighten the excitement of the match, Yanmar showcased various tractors and excavators outside the stadium. This was warmly received by the supporters, as evident from the numerous photos and selfies taken. The enthusiasm was further fueled by the distribution of Yanmar goodies with FunGuns to the audience before the match.\n\nEagerness, power, and ambition\n\nAlmere City proved to be a worthy opponent for Ajax, displaying eagerness, power, and ambition. The sensational match concluded with a 2-2 draw, a fair result, and a notable outcome for the young Almere City players against the established Ajax.\n\nFootball is our engine\n\nThe sponsorship of Almere City aligns perfectly with Yanmar’s global passionate commitment to sports sponsorship, particularly in football and watersports.
