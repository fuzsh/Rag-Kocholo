        "text": "The 23-year-old joins on a two-year contract, with the option for a third year, after leaving Dutch second-tier club Almere City. The Reds beat off competition from several top-flight clubs in the Netherlands to sign him.\n\nDutchman Enzio can operate on either flank, has pace, an eye for goal and helped Almere to the Dutch League end of season play-offs.\n\nReds chief Drummy said: “We’re delighted to have Enzio here and I think he’s the sort of player who is going to excite our supporters, he will be like a breath of fresh air.\n\n“He can operate on both flanks and he is very quick, strong and technically very good. He’s a player that was identified to us a while ago.\n\n“Enzio is very keen to play in England. He calls it the home of football. We think he is capable of developing even further and, just as importantly, he is hungry to do well and be successful with Crawley. This is an opportunity he is desperate to grab and I like that hunger in a player.\n\n“It’s an important signing for the club and one I think which shows our intent. Enzio’s style will suit the system and philosophy we want to implement here.”\n\nBoldewijn said: “The club’s ambition helped influence my decision and I think Mr Drummy’s appointment makes Crawley the right place for me to flourish.\""
