        "text": "Tottenham Hotspur now have 13 players out on loan after a January transfer window in which they were the busiest team in the Premier League.\n\nSpurs also added another new arrival to their ranks after the window closed with the signing of Lucas Bergvall. The 18-year-old Swede is not technically on loan though back at his club Djurgarden as he signed a couple of days after the deadline, instead he will officially join the north London club in the summer on a five-year deal.\n\nThere is also Ivan Perisic who has joined Hajduk Split on loan until the end of his Tottenham contract this summer and will then play for the Croatian team next season. The 34-year-old is not expected back from his cruciate ligament injury until April or potentially even May but we will continue to provide updates on his progress when they come in.\n\nElsewhere Spurs have a number of players out across the English game at various levels as well as those playing in Spain, Turkey, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy.\n\nHere's how the other 12 Spurs loan players have got on over the past week:\n\nAlejo Veliz (Sevilla)\n\nAlejo Veliz made a deadline day switch to Spanish side Sevilla as Tottenham look to help the 20-year-old's development with regular football over the remainder of the season.\n\nThe Argentine, who has already scored his first Premier League goal at Brighton and made eight appearances for Spurs, is almost back from a knee injury suffered in the win against Bournemouth on New Year's Eve.\n\n\"So far, everyone I've met here, for example the president, has been so welcoming,\" explained Veliz, as reported by Sevilla's official website. \"I've come here to do the best I can for the club. Yesterday was a long day, but it was worth all the effort that was put in.\n\n\"I'm so proud and grateful to be given this opportunity. I have been training well with the ball for two weeks as part of my recovery from injury and next week I should be able to train with the whole squad.\"\n\nREAD MORE: From Tottenham to Chelsea - Todd Kline, those stadium naming rights and his impact at Spurs\n\nREAD MORE: Micky van de Ven so angry he couldn't talk in dressing room as Lucas Bergvall wows Tottenham\n\nOn meeting his new teammates, he added: \"[I've] already spent a bit of time with them and will try my best to fit in. The fact I will be wearing the number 10 gives me even more reason to give everything on the pitch. I'm looking forward to hopefully being able to play with them from Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm a striker who likes to play in the penalty area, who chases every ball and doesn't give up. Going from the Premier League to La Liga is a very exciting step,\" said the youngster. \"When my agent told me Sevilla were interested, I told him to do whatever it took to make it happen, because it’s a huge club and I think I'm going to love it here.\n\n\"I spoke with the coach and am very happy. It will depend on me to show, with the healthy competition here, what I’m about, show my best football on the pitch and try to earn my place.\"\n\nSevilla sporting director Victor Orta revealed that the Spanish side had tried to sign the Argentine back in the summer before he made the move to Tottenham from Rosario Central.\n\n\"Veliz is a striker that we have been trying to get for a while,\" said the Spaniard. \"We were competing against some of the biggest teams in Europe in the summer. When those players then go to one of the big clubs we continue to have them on our radar to see how they progress.\n\n\"In the final week of the transfer window, we learned that Veliz could be an option and that they would be able to recover from his injury within a week and we went for the signing.\"\n\nTroy Parrott (Excelsior Rotterdam)\n\nTroy Parrott added yet another goal to his collection this season with a close range strike as Excelsior Rotterdam lost 2-1 at Almere City on Friday night.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland international turned 22 on Sunday and now has 10 goal involvements in 17 Eredivisie matches, with seven goals and three assists.\n\nThat means Parrott has managed a goal involvement every 94 minutes, so pretty much one a game, in the Eredivisie and it's not going unnoticed that he's racking them up at a team in the bottom half of the table.\n\nfootball.london understands that while Parrott remains desperate to prove himself at Tottenham, clubs in Serie A, the Eredivisie and the Championship are monitoring his situation at the north London club. He has a contract with Spurs until 2025 and there is understood to be an option within it for the club to extend that by another year.\n\nThe young striker wants to catch Postecoglou's attention after injury robbed him of the chance last summer. If he still cannot then the fact that he has a European passport as an Irishman will make him a wanted man on the continent and at home.\n\nDjed Spence (Genoa)\n\nDjed Spence got to play on his favoured right-hand side this weekend after spending his two previous games at Genoa on the left side of the pitch.\n\nThe good thing for the 23-year-old is that he has already started all three matches he's been available for at the Serie A club, which means he's already got more minutes under his belt (225) than he has for Tottenham in total since joining the north London club in the summer of 2022, with only 41 minutes to his name in a Spurs shirt.\n\nHe almost opened his account for Genoa in a 0-0 draw at Empoli. There was drama for Spence in the 78th minute as he nearly ended up as the matchwinner when his looping header from an Aaron Martin cross beat the goalkeeper, but was cleared off the line at the last moment by Sebastiano Luperto.\n\nThe young full-back managed one tackle, one interception and one clearance, while winning two aerial duels during the game as well as embarking on two dribbles at the other end of the pitch.\n\nSpence getting down to business in Italy is good news after reports this week on Spence's time at Leeds United earlier this season suggested that Daniel Farke was unimpressed by the player's demeanour and performance levels, while reported poor punctuality was underlined by the full-back arriving late for the meeting in which he was told he would be going back early to Spurs.\n\nEric Dier (Bayern Munich)\n\nEric Dier has a 100 per cent record as a Bayern Munich player and the centre-back is playing regularly for the Bavarian side.\n\nAfter coming on at half-time against Union Berlin in a 1-0 victory last month, the 30-year-old has played every minute in the Bundesliga since with back-to-back wins against Augsburg and Borussia Monchengladbach, meaning Dier has played three times and won three times.\n\nThe centre-back, who has recently become a father for the first time, has settled in well in Germany, playing alongside his former Tottenham team-mate Harry Kane.\n\n\"Harry helped me a lot in the integration, that makes everything easier for me,\" Dier said in an interview with German media outlet Bild this week. \"But that applies to everyone in the club. They have all been incredible so far and have helped me a lot. I'm very grateful for that.\n\n\"I always want to play, no matter where I am. When I came here I was ready to play and I got the chance to do so in the past two games.\"\n\nTanguy Ndombele (Galatasaray)\n\nTanguy Ndombele continues to have a bit-part role at Galatasaray with just a couple of minutes from the bench in the 2-0 win at Samsunspor on Friday night. That follows on from his nine minutes in the 2-1 victory at home against Gaziantep on the Monday evening.\n\nThere had been some suggestions in Turkey that Galatasaray might try to negotiate a return for the French midfielder in the January transfer window but that never came to pass.\n\nNdombele has now made 20 appearances for the Turkish side, getting just 552 minutes across those games.\n\nSergio Reguilon (Brentford)\n\nReguilon had already made his debut for Brentford with a 16-minute cameo from the bench in their 3-2 win against Nottingham Forest last month. That meant the Spaniard's previous two matches have both been against Nuno Espirito Santo's side as he ended his time at Manchester United with a defeat at the City Ground.\n\nHowever, he was unable to play against his parent club Spurs in the Premier League in midweek so will be hoping to take his place on the pitch against Manchester City on Monday night.\n\nWith Rico Henry out for the rest of the season, Reguilon is a natural left-back when Thomas Frank needs one and he should get plenty of game time in the months ahead.\n\nJoe Rodon (Leeds United)\n\nJoe Rodon made it back-to-back clean sheets as Leeds United won 1-0 at Bristol City on Friday night to remain hot on the heels of second-placed Southampton.\n\nThe Welshman continues to earn praise aplenty during his time at Elland Road and he was handed an eight in Leeds Live's player ratings from the game with the review: \"Dealt with what came his way in the box, but never asked to do a huge amount. Big header late doors as Leeds were flagging under Bristol pressure. Came into his own in the latter stages.\"\n\nLeeds fans are desperate for their club to sign the 26-year-old permanently but there was no option in their original loan agreement to do so. That means the Yorkshire club will have to negotiate with Spurs if they want to sign the Wales international and his form this season will only have increased his value and the interest in his services.\n\nThere was some talk that Leeds might attempt to strike an early deal last month for the player to prevent a transfer tussle thanks to his starring role in the backline for the promotion-chasers. However, Leeds may be forced to wait until they know whether they will be back in the Premier League with the financial boost that brings, which could in turn allow other clubs a shot at signing the Welshman in the summer.\n\nJaphet Tanganga (Millwall)\n\nJaphet Tanganga is experiencing regular football for the first time in a long while as he made it back-to-back starts with Millwall in the Championship.\n\nOn Saturday, Tanganga was in central defence again as Millwall lost 1-0 at Hull City. The 24-year-old gave an interview ahead of the game which was featured in Southwark News, where he spoke about learning the art of defending up against some of the best attackers in the Premier League at Spurs.\n\n\"You play against the best to match try and match yourself up and see if you’re able to deal with the best and there’s things I’ve added to my game due to the way I’ve had to defend against Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min [in training] that I can bring into my footballing ability,\" he said. \"Definitely it’s been very helpful for my growth working under great managers and playing with great players.\"\n\nTanganga also talked about that tough six months at Augsburg in Germany where he did not play a single minute of competitive football.\n\n\"I think in football it’s a lot of things, it’s not just one thing. Obviously I came over there injured and they still took me on,\" said the defender. \"The manager was sacked and the new one came in and he had his ideologies and he didn’t favour me in the team, but that’s not a problem, that’s how football goes. I was just keeping myself ready for when an opportunity arises for when I was able to be involved. Unfortunately, it didn’t.\n\n\"But I wanted to be ready and fit to maybe find somewhere else in January for an opportunity if it presented itself, which it did. Now I’m here at Millwall, involved in [three] games more than I did at Augsburg, which is progress.\"\n\nHe added: “You definitely have to look at yourself. Obviously coming in injured didn’t help but you have to look at yourself. Like could I have done more in training? Could I have pushed a bit more. Definitely I look at myself in that situation but it’s not just one thing. It’s a multitude of things of why it maybe didn’t work.\n\n\"I wasn’t playing but it was a nice to learn a new culture, learn a new language and Augsburg were very good to me in terms of how they treated me. It didn’t work out on the pitch but off the pitch, it was a great group of players, great staff and they made it really welcoming for me just as it has been at Millwall.\"\n\nAlfie Devine (Plymouth Argyle)\n\nAlfie Devine made it back-to-back starts in the Championship for Plymouth Argyle, playing 75 minutes as they picked up a 1-0 victory at Swansea.\n\nThat means the 19-year-old midfielder, who was involved in the winning goal, has started two matches for Argyle and won them both. He was unable to play in the FA Cup draw at Leeds in between as he was cup-tied having played in the competition in the first half of the season for Port Vale.\n\nAfter the win at Swansea, Devine received a six in Plymouth Live's player ratings with the review: \"The 19-year-old loan signing from Tottenham made just his second Argyle appearance as one of the two attacking players behind Ryan Hardie in Argyle's 3-4-2-1 formation. He made a darting run to receive the initial short corner taken by Adam Forshaw which led to Morgan Whittaker's decisive goal. Devine touched the ball back to Forshaw and his cross into the box picked out the Pilgrims' top scorer, whose first-time finish was very precise.\"\n\nDevine will again miss out on the FA Cup replay with Leeds on Tuesday night but will be hoping to come up against old Tottenham team-mate Jack Clarke on Saturday as Plymouth travel to Sunderland.\n\nAshley Phillips (Plymouth Argyle)\n\nAshley Phillips continues to earn plaudits for his performances for Plymouth alongside Devine. The 18-year-old centre-back has played every minute bar five in his four matches since arriving at the club.\n\nThe teenager played his part in helping Argyle keep a clean sheet at Swansea on Saturday and was handed a seven out of 10 by Plymouth Live in their player ratings.\n\nThey gave him the review: \"It is impressive how much of a physical presence that Phillips has about him at the age of just 18. After four successive starts for the Pilgrims since arriving on loan from Tottenham Hotspur it is already clear he is more than good enough to play at Championship level.\"\n\nPhillips will be looking to impress again on Tuesday night at home against Leeds in the FA Cup fourth round replay.\n\nMatthew Craig (Doncaster Rovers)\n\nMatthew Craig was an unused substitute as Doncaster Rovers drew 1-1 at Sutton United in League Two.\n\nThe 20-year-old defensive midfielder and Scotland U21 international was unable to play in midweek as Rovers lost 1-0 at Bradford in the quarter-finals of the EFL Trophy as he had previously played in the competition for Tottenham's U21s.\n\nCraig will be hoping to get some minutes as Doncaster host Tranmere in the league this coming Saturday afternoon.\n\nJosh Keeley (Barnet)\n\nJosh Keeley made his fifth straight start for Barnet as they drew 1-1 with Wealdstone in the National League on Saturday afternoon. The 20-year-old Republic of Ireland U21 international has been earning plaudits for his displays for the non-league side since joining last month."
