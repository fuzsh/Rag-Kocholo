        "text": "It is another weekend where bet slips have to be made in anticipation of winning the Mega Jackpot if not the lucrative bonuses offered. Therefore it is in our greatest interest to provide an in-depth analysis of the upcoming matches in an effort to help you come up with a winning bet slip. Below is a breakdown of the individual matches in the Mega jackpot.\n\nAFC ESKILSTUNA vs HELSINGBORG\n\nIn Sweden’s Allsvenskan Eskilstuna meet Helsingborg in an interesting matchup, Eskilstuna is fifteenth in the league table whereas their opponents Helsingborg are fourteenth on the table with only three points separating them thus Helsingborg have eight points while their opponents have five points. Helsingborg has lost four and drawn one of their last five matches while Eskilstuna has drawn two, lost two, and won one of their last matches. In their last recent two meetings, they drew in one match and Eskilstuna won one match away from home. Statistically, Eskilstuna looks to be the better team with home advantage in this match but due to both teams’ table positioning a draw could ensue.\n\nALCORCON vs UD EXTREMADURA\n\nAlcorcon will be playing Extremadura in the LaLiga 2. Alcorcon are in eleventh place with 51 points while their opponents Extremadura are in fifteenth place with 45 points with a stellar four wins and one loss in their last five matches while Alcorcon has three losses one draw and one win comparatively. Both teams have won a single match in their last two meetings where the team that was playing at home registered a win. Statistically, Extremadura looks to be the better team but the fact that Alcorcon is playing at home and are above in the table could be anyone’s match or even Steven.\n\nESPANYOL vs REAL SOCIEDAD\n\nIn the Spanish LaLiga ninth placed Real sociedad meet eighth placed Espanyol in a match that will definitely be tough by the mere fact that both teams have a 50 points tie. In their last five meetings the teams have registered two draws, Real sociedad winning twice and Espanyol winning once. Interestingly Espanyol have won twice, drawn twice and lost once while playing at home in comparison to Real sociedad who have won once drawn one and lost three times in their last five matches away from home. Espanyol are favorites to win in this match up in an anticipatory extension of their last home win against strongly second placed Atletico Madrid.\n\nELCHE vs TENERIFE\n\nIn LaLiga 2 Elche will be playing Tenerife. Elche are 12th placed on the table with 50 points while Tenerife are 17th placed on the table with 43 points. Elche are favorites to win having won four and lost only one match in their last home matches. Tenerife have only won one, lost two and drawn two of their last away matches. In the head to head statistics of the last five matches, Tenerife have won two matches in which they were at home, Elche has won one match in which they were also at home while both teams drew twice.\n\nALAVES vs GIRONA\n\nAlaves will meet relegation prone Girona in the Spanish LaLiga. This will be a tough match as Girona will be looking to upset Alaves. Both teams have drawn twice in their last four meetings and Girona have won two matches. Girona are 17th placed with 37 points while Alaves are 11th placed with 47 points. Girona have lost four and won one of their last five matches away from home while Alaves have won three and drawn two of their last five matches whilst playing at home. This match has a very high chance of ending up a draw if not a Girona win as really need it and hope that Celta Vigo lose next match while overturning a six goal difference.\n\nHUESCA vs LEGANES\n\nThis could more or less be termed as a display match considering the fact that Huesca have already been relegated, but it is very common for such teams to put on a great game as they play for the last time in the League. It is highly anticipated that 13th placed Leganes will be the favorites of this match up, as they are slots higher than bottom placed Huesca who are 20th on the table. In their most recent meeting Leganes won at home by a single goal while Huesca have only won a single match, drawn two and lost two while playing at home in their last five games. This could very likely end in a draw as no team will be highly motivated as there is nothing to play for as the LaLiga winds up.\n\nSTRASBOURG vs RENNES\n\nThis will be a match between two teams in the French Ligue 1 competition that are 11th and 12th placed consecutively on the table with at 46 points tie. The home team Strasbourg are favorites to win with their home advantage and having won two out of three matches in their last meetings with opponents Stade Rennes. Notably Strasbourg won by 4 goals to one while playing away in their last meeting in December last year. Therefore it is highly anticipated that they replicate the magnificent performance this time round with a home turf advantage. Rennes haven’t won a single match in their last five games while playing away from home.\n\nGUINGAMP vs NIMES\n\nGuingamp will be playing Nimes in the French Ligue 1, Guingamp have already been relegated as they are placed 20th at the bottom of the table. However they will definitely be looking to end their Ligue 1 playing time with a good performance considering the fact that they held their opponents to a goalless stalemate while they were playing away from home in their last meeting in September of last year. Nimes current form away from home doesn’t look good with only one win and four losses in their last five matches. Therefore this match could likely go Guingamp’s way or a draw.\n\nPERTH GLORY vs SYDNEY FC\n\nIn the Australian League playoffs Perth glory who drew 3-3 and won 5-4 on a penalty shoot out to Adelaide united in the semifinal of the playoffs will be meeting Sydney Fc who thrashed Melbourne victory a whooping six goals to one in their semifinal of the play offs. However Perth Glory’s have won four and lost one of their last five matches in comparison to Sydney fc who have won two, Lost two and drawn once in their last five matches. In the head to head statistics Sydney fc seem to be the favorites having won 11 out of 12 matches they have played against Perth Glory who have only won one match.\n\nEMOPLI vs TORINO\n\nThis will be an interesting clash in the Italian Serie A. It will be the second last match for both teams and it is quite significant to both teams because Empoli are 18th on the table with 35 points and facing relegation. A win for them could mathematically put them away from relegation assuming Genoa and Udinese lose or draw in their upcoming matches. On the other hand Torino are 7th placed on the table with 60 points. Mathematically if they win this game and the last one assuming Atalanta Milan and Roma lose or draw in their upcoming matches they could as well finish in fourth place. Even though Torino are favorites to win Empoli will definitely unleash their full capacity in order to avoid relegation. Torino have won once and both teams have drawn twice in their las three meetings.\n\nPARMA FC vs FIORENTINA\n\nFifteenth placed Parma fc will be facing Fourteenth placed Fiorentina in the Italian Serie A. Parma fc have 38 points while Fiorentina have 40 points. In their recent two meetings Parma fc have won once away from home while both teams drew in the second match. Parma’s recent home form is one win, one draw and one loss, While Fiorentina have lost four matches and drawn one. Statistically Parma look to be the favorites with a home advantage.\n\nCADIZ FC vs OSASUNA\n\nThis will be a match in the LaLiga 2 that will feature Cadiz fc who are at the top of the table with 77 points versus 6th placed Osasuna with 62 points. In their last four meetings Osasuna have won three matches while Cadiz fc managed to bag only one win. Cadiz have four draws and one win in their last five matches at home in comparison to their opponents Osasuna who have two wins, two draws and one win in their last five matches away from home. Osasuna look to be the favorites in this match although Cadiz fc have the home advantage.\n\nFC ROSTOV vs ZENIT ST PETERSBURG\n\nIn the Russian league 8th placed Rostov who have 38 points meet League leaders Zenit st Petersburg who have 61 points. In their last five meetings Zenit have won two matches, Rostov have won once and both teams have registered a draw in two matches. Zenit are clearly the favorites having beat Rostov away from home in January by five goals to nil, even though they have won two games and drawn three in their last five matches away from home. As compared to Rostov who have won two games, drawn two games and lost one game in their last five home games.\n\nLUGO vs DEPORTIVO LA CORUNA\n\nEighteenth placed Lugo who are fighting for relegation in LaLiga 2 face seventh placed Deportivo La coruna who have 61 points. Lugo have 41 points. In their recent two meetings both teams drew once and Deportivo La coruna won once. Lugo have two wins, two losses and one draw in their last five home matches, while Deportivo La coruna have three wins, one draw and one loss in their last five away matches. It will be a tough match even though Deportivo La coruna are the favorites.\n\nCORDOBA vs GIMNASTIC TARRAGONA\n\nThese are two teams in the LaLIga 2 that both face relegation with a point apart. There won’t be much to fight for in this game although Gimnastic have won three matches as compared to Cordoba who have won two of their last five meetings. Gimnastic have registered a poor away form having lost all five of the recent away games. Which gives an upper hand to Cordoba who have recently won two and lost three of their home matches.\n\nJUVENTUS vs ATALANTA\n\nItaly’s Serie A League leaders Juventus will face fourth place Atalanta who are only one point away from third placed Inter. Therefore Atalanta will be going into this match with a winning mentality in order to go above inter on the table as the season is almost over. Juventus will most likely be relaxed as this match just looks like a formality to them as they have already won the title. This match could easily end in a draw or a win for either Juventus or Atalanta.\n\nNAPOLI vs INTER\n\nSecond placed Napoli meet third place Inter with a ten point difference between them as the Italian serie A comes close to an end. The difference in points suggest that it won’t be a highly contested match, but Napoli are clearly the favorites in this match but Inter are clearly under pressure from Atalanta who are a point below them. Therefore they will be highly motivated to maintain their third place position. This is a match that could go anyways, thus a win for either teams or a draw as they inch closer to the end of the season.\n\nWelcome to yet another SPORTPESA MEGAJACKPOT, POST-MATCH ANALYSIS – THE BREAKDOWN-7. We managed to get 9/17 correct predictions which were poor by our standards. There were close calls and red cards that threw some of the games off not to mention a mind boggling total of 6 draws with 3 of them coming in the last 4 matches: but as always, we like to take on any loss as a challenge to do better. With that in mind, below is the breakdown of the results as well as an in depth look of our research methodology in the hopes that with each loss we all gain a lesson that could potentially set us on our way back to the Sportpesa Megajackpot Bonus once again in the coming week.\n\nReading vs Millwall\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 3-1\n\nYakou Meite netted a brace for Reading as they eased the pressure on manager Paul Clement by beating fellow Championship strugglers Millwall. Meite headed Reading into the lead as he glanced in Tyler Blackett’s near-post cross but Murray Wallace levelled for Millwall within six minutes.\n\nClement’s side regained the lead on the stroke of half-time after Blackett was fouled by Mahlon Romeo in the penalty area. Sam Baldock converted from the spot, as Romeo was booked, and the Royals made the points safe when Meite headed in a Leandro Bacuna corner late on.\n\nReading’s first Championship victory in four games came courtesy of a gritty display and some notable saves from returning goalkeeper Anssi Jaakkola. The Finn was recalled between the sticks for the first time since March after injuries to Vito Mannone and Sam Walker.\n\nTwice he denied Millwall an opener in the first 15 minutes with a one-on-one save from Lee Gregory before clawing a Jake Cooper header off his line. Before Meite broke the deadlock, Liam Kelly struck a post for Reading in the first half, while Tom Elliott headed an effort against the crossbar as Millwall searched for a leveller after the break. Jaakkola again proved solid when he blocked a close-range Shane Ferguson volley from Jed Wallace’s cross as Reading clinched an important victory.\n\nWe had gone for a home win based on head to head records as well as current form and it proved an accurate prediction.\n\nWigan vs West Brom\n\nOur 1st Pick: 2\n\nResult: 1-0\n\nJosh Windass ended West Bromwich Albion’s seven-game unbeaten run to lift Wigan Athletic up to seventh in the Championship. Summer signing Windass got the only goal 16 minutes from time. Latching onto Nick Powell’s knockdown from Latics goalkeeper Christian Walton’s long clearance, he accelerated, then veered to his right past the last defender to drill low right-footed past Sam Johnstone.\n\nAlbion would have regained top spot with a point or better but failed to score in the league for only the second time this season.\n\nOnly a string of fine saves from Johnstone prevented Wigan winning by more and Albion ended with 10 men as Jake Livermore was sent off for a second yellow card late on. After a free-scoring few weeks, this defeat would have acted as a timely reminder to Albion that promotion back to the Premier League will not be straightforward.\n\nPaul Cook’s Wigan proudly protected their own undefeated sequence – they have not lost in the league at the DW Stadium since February – and were unfortunate not to win by more. Despite hamstring injuries keeping out Latics attackers Will Grigg and Michael Jacobs, they created several chances and limited Albion – by far the Championship’s top scorers – to just one shot on target.\n\nAlbion’s front duo of Dwight Gayle (eight) and Jay Rodriguez (seven) had scored more than Wigan’s team (14) combined this season – but Windass levelled that statistic. The Latics dominated a feisty game that featured nine bookings, including Livermore’s pair of yellows, and Windass was denied three times by Johnstone before opening the scoring.\n\nJohnstone also twice denied Gary Roberts, while Albion’s best chance of rescuing a point saw Ahmed Hegazi’s header hit the side netting late on.\n\nWe had gone for an away win based on their long unbeaten streak but it came to a crashing end over the weekend.\n\nNottingham vs Norwich\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 1-2\n\nTimm Klose’s second-half double lifted Norwich City into the Championship play-off places at the expense of Nottingham Forest with a 2-1 win at the City Ground.\n\nCity, who inflicted Forest’s first home defeat since they lost to Brentford in April, had to come from behind to secure the points. Lewis Grabban crashed home a Joao Carvalho chipped pass to put Forest in front on five minutes. Despite the best efforts of Onel Hernandez, who hit a post, and Marco Stiepermann, who missed with the goal gaping, that was how it stayed until the second half.\n\nOn the hour, Klose headed in a Moritz Leitner free-kick to level and, with time ticking down, the Switzerland international then nudged a rebound from Jordan Rhodes’ shot past Costel Pantilimon for his third goal in as many games.\n\nThis was Forest’s first defeat in all competitions since their 2-1 away loss at Brentford on 1 September, and was the result of Aitor Karanka’s side failing to build on their early momentum as the Canaries forced their way back into the game.\n\nThey drop to eighth, two points behind Blackburn in sixth. In-form Forest forward Joe Lolley, who had three goals in his past four games, struck the crossbar soon after Grabban’s early goal, but the shift in possession and chances was noticeable after the break. City striker Rhodes imposed his presence on the game, keeping Pantilimon busy, and Klose’s timely brace ensured a return to winning ways and a first defeat against the Canaries for Reds boss Karanka.\n\nWe had based our pick on home ground advantage but Norwich made a stunning comeback to secure a memorable away victory.\n\nShrewsbury vs Sunderland\n\nOur 1st Pick: 2\n\nResult: 0-2\n\nSunderland scored twice in the second half to run out comfortable winners at Shrewsbury.\n\nAn own goal from Omar Beckles gave the visitors the lead before sub Luke O’Nien added a late second.\n\nShrewsbury created two early chances as Beckles nodded Alex Gilliead’s cross over the bar before a Luke Waterfall header from Shaun Whalley’s corner was saved by Sunderland goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin.\n\nVisiting skipper Lee Cattermole volleyed Jerome Sinclair’s cross over the bar before Whalley’s curling free kick at the other end bounced up against the bar.\n\nSunderland made the breakthrough in the 58th minute as left-back Beckles turned a cross from Lynden Gooch into his own net.\n\nChris Maguire’s well-struck shot was kept out by home goalkeeper Joel Coleman shortly afterwards.\n\nBeckles and sub Aaron Amadi-Holloway were both off target with headers as Shrewsbury chased an equaliser before O’Nien, having just been sent on by Black Cats manager Jack Ross, fired in a low shot to double Sunderland’s advantage six minutes from time.\n\nWe backed the black cats to carry the day and it proved an accurate prediction.\n\nCardiff vs Fulham\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 4-2\n\nFulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic said his side have “so many defensive problems to fix” after they slipped into the Premier League relegation zone with defeat at Cardiff. Andre Schurrle’s spectacular 30-yard strike put the visitors ahead against the run of play, but within 10 minutes they trailed against a resurgent Bluebirds side inspired by a fervent home crowd.\n\nJosh Murphy equalised with a precise low finish, and then Bobby Reid seized on frenetic Fulham defending to slot in his first goal for the club – only for Ryan Sessegnon to make it 2-2 before the break. Fulham seemed to grow in confidence from that point, but Cardiff responded again, with Callum Paterson shooting on the turn to squeeze the ball into the bottom corner to make it 3-2.\n\nThen, as the visitors went in search of a late equaliser, a slip from Tim Ream allowed Victor Camarasa to square the ball to Cardiff substitute Kadeem Harris, whose close-range finish prompted delirious celebrations among the home fans.\n\nCardiff’s first league win of the season lifted them off the bottom of the table and out of the relegation zone, while Fulham have now conceded 12 goals in their past three games.\n\nBased on Fulham’s abysmal defensive record, we backed the home side to carry the day and they did run rampant against their London-based opponents.\n\nNewcastle vs Brighton\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 0-1\n\nRafael Benitez said turning around Newcastle’s fortunes will be the toughest challenge of his career after slipping to the bottom of the Premier League following defeat by Brighton.\n\nThe Magpies remain winless after a fifth straight home loss thanks to Brighton’s Beram Kayal, who deflected in Jose Izquierdo’s strike in the 29th minute.\n\nThe Seagulls lost leading scorer Glenn Murray, who was taken off after a sickening aerial collision in the ninth minute. Brighton boss Chris Hughton later stated that the forward had been concussed but would leave hospital after having precautionary fans. But it did not put the visitors off their stride in a match where they spent most of the time defending.\n\nBenitez said the Magpies needed to be “more precise and clinical” after producing 27 shots on goal, with only six on target. Midfielder Jonjo Shelvey went closest to scoring – first with a strike that was superbly blocked by Mat Ryan, then with a free-kick saved by the Australian with the help from his wall.\n\nAnd despite saying he was confident he could turn things around, when asked if the current situation is the toughest he has faced, the Spaniard said: “Yes, at the moment, yes.” I have had a lot of situations, but at the moment, obviously it’s a difficult task.”\n\nThe result means Newcastle are the fourth team in top-flight history to lose their first five home games of a season – the other three teams were relegated.\n\nWe had backed the home side to get their 1st win of the season based on their 1st half performance against the red devils but they were once again poor and deserved no points.\n\nHull City vs Preston\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 1-1\n\nHull City missed a chance to move out of the Championship relegation zone as fellow strugglers Preston North End grabbed a late equaliser. The Tigers hit the woodwork three times through Kamil Grosicki, Chris Martin and Jarrod Bowen and saw Preston goalkeeper Chris Maxwell pull off a string of saves.\n\nBowen then put the Tigers ahead from the penalty spot five minutes from time after Lilywhites centre-back Jordan Storey had brought down Martin. But Preston hit back in the third minute of stoppage time when Louis Moult brought the ball down, turned and fired in to extend the visitors’ unbeaten run to three games.\n\nHull had failed to score in three of their past four games heading into the match and looked like they would draw another blank until Bowen broke the deadlock from 12 yards. After Alan Brown and Lukas Nmecha spurned early chances for North End, Poland international Grosicki’s fierce strike came back off the upright and Martin hit the bar with a header.\n\nMaxwell denied Bowen from Grosicki’s cutback after the break and the influential Pole had two more attempts saved before Maxwell deflected another Bowen effort onto the post. The forward’s fourth goal of the campaign seemed set to give Nigel Adkins’ side a first win in six games but substitute Moult struck to share the spoils.\n\nAlex Neil’s Preston move out of the bottom three on goal difference after Millwall lost at Reading, while Hull climb off the bottom having won more games than Ipswich Town, who return to the foot of the table.\n\nWycombe vs Scunthorpe\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 3-2\n\nCraig Mackail-Smith completed a remarkable Wycombe comeback by scoring an injury-time winner as the ten-man Chairboys recovered from two goals down to beat Scunthorpe.\n\nMackail-Smith punished a mistake from defender Rory McArdle, racing clear before finishing expertly past Jak Alnwick. It looked like Wycombe would settle for a valiant point after Fred Onyedinma curled home from 20 yards on 53 minutes to make it 2-2 after good hold-up play by Adebayo Akinfenwa.\n\nScunthorpe had started the game in lightning fashion with two goals in the opening seven minutes as they threatened to run riot. Ryan Colclough scored after just 18 seconds, cutting in from the left and firing past a stranded Ryan Allsop.\n\nStephen Humphrys made it 2-0 in double-quick time, clinically slotting past the Wycombe keeper. However, Dominic Gape gave Wycombe hope with a brilliant finish on 26 minutes to reduce their arrears. Allsop was sent off with 10 minutes to go after being given a straight red for a foul on Ike Ugbo before Mackail-Smith’s deserved winner.\n\nWe had backed the home team based on h2h records and it proved accurate.\n\nCrawley Town vs Newport\n\nOur 1st Pick: 2\n\nResult: 4-1\n\nCrawley closed in on the League Two play-off places with an impressive win over promotion-hunting Newport County. Joe Maguire struck for the hosts inside a minute from a Lewis Young cross. Jamille Matt levelled, but Filipe Morais’ penalty restored Crawley’s lead after Ollie Palmer was brought down.\n\nPalmer’s header and Ashley Nathaniel-George’s solo goal stretched Crawleys’ lead, before County’s Fraser Franks was shown a straight red card for a bad foul on Nathaniel-George.\n\nYeovil vs Tranmere\n\nOur 1st Pick: X\n\nResult: 0-0\n\nYeovil and Tranmere played out a goalless draw as neither side did enough to secure all three points in their League Two clash at Huish Park. Yeovil arguably had the better of the few opportunities in the game as a flicked header from Alex Fisher in the first half was tipped over by Scott Davies.\n\nAfter the break, the Glovers went reasonably close again as a cross from Jake Gray turned into a shot and, with Davies stranded, Luke McCoulough expertly headed away from under his own bar.\n\nYoann Arquin perhaps should have done better with a Carl Dickinson free-kick that found him in the box but he could only put it wide, while Tom James had Davies worried with a free-kick of his own which the Tranmere goalkeeper tried to catch but could only push over the bar.\n\nJames Norwood did have a chance for the visitors deep into added time but despite having eight league goals already this season only rolled his tame effort into the hands of a thankful Nathan Baxter.\n\nWe had backed these two to settle for a point each based on current form and it proved an accurate prediction.\n\nIpswich vs QPR\n\nOur 1st Pick: X\n\nResult: 0-2\n\nQueens Park Rangers eased to victory at Championship strugglers Ipswich Town to increase the pressure on Tractor Boys manager Paul Hurst. The visitors went ahead when Town keeper Dean Gerken fumbled Luke Freeman’s corner into his own net.\n\nRangers doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time through Tomer Hemed’s penalty after Eberechi Eze was felled in the box by Toto Nsiala. Gerken denied Eze and Hemed after the break, while England Under-20 forward Eze also clipped the bar with a shot from the edge of the box as Rangers dominated.\n\nIpswich have won just once in the league this season under Hurst and are yet to register a home victory since the former Shrewsbury boss took charge at Portman Road this summer. The Suffolk side rarely threatened Joe Lumley in the QPR goal, with a Grant Ward header their only effort on target.\n\nIt proved to be a comfortable afternoon for the west Londoners once they took the lead from Freeman’s set-piece, as Steve McClaren’s side made it three games without defeat. Ipswich remain one point from safety despite the loss but drop to the bottom of the table, slipping behind Hull City on games won.\n\nPlymouth vs Burton\n\nOur 1st Pick: X\n\nResult: 2-3\n\nBurton defender Kyle McFadzean scored twice as Nigel Clough’s side claimed their first League One away win of the season at basement side Plymouth. Unmarked McFadzean headed home Stephen Quinn’s 84th-minute free-kick at the near post to put the Brewers ahead for the first time in an enthralling game. Argyle striker Freddie Ladapo scored twice in the first half, opening the scoring with a superb shot from just inside the box that beat the diving Dimitar Evtimov after nine minutes.\n\nMcFadzean levelled in the 19th minute, heading home from a corner after Ben Turner nodded back across goal from the far post. Ladapo pounced on a Quinn backpass to round Evtimov and score his second after 35 minutes.\n\nBut just moments later Albion again restored parity from a corner, Lucas Akins heading home Jamie Allen’s 39th-minute delivery. Ladapo – who should have had a hat-trick – played his part in defence, clearing McFadzean’s goal-bound header off the line following another corner but the defender would not be denied six minutes from time.\n\nDerby vs Sheffield Utd\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 2-1\n\nA goal after 19 seconds helped Derby County deny Sheffield United the chance to go top of the Championship, as the Blades’ four-match winning run ended with defeat at Pride Park.\n\nRams striker Jack Marriott’s clever, flicked finish won the game for Frank Lampard’s hosts with 13 minutes to play. Derby had led inside the first minute when Craig Bryson completed a good team move, but Chris Basham tucked United level before half-time.\n\nThe hosts pressed for a winner, before Marriott’s second goal in two starts sent them up to fifth. The win was Derby’s first since their Carabao Cup victory on penalties at Manchester United in September and their sixth of the league season, moving them four points behind the second-placed Blades.\n\nThe visitors would have gone top with a draw, after defeats for promotion-chasing Leeds United and West Bromwich Albion earlier on Saturday. Chris Wilder’s men played some well-worked football in the first half, culminating with Basham’s equaliser, after John Fleck had beaten four Derby players before squaring the ball to the centre-half at the far post.\n\nBut Martyn Waghorn should have headed Derby back in front moments later and then they had the better of the second half, before Marriott darted in at the near post and diverted home to end United’s five-match unbeaten streak.\n\nStrasbourg vs Monaco\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 2-1\n\nThierry Henry’s first game as a manager ended in defeat as his Monaco side were beaten 2-1 at Strasbourg in Ligue 1. Frenchman Henry, 41, saw his side go behind when goalkeeper Seydou Sy fumbled an Adrien Thomasson header.\n\nIt got worse for the visitors when Samuel Grandsir saw red for a high foot, before Strasbourg substitute Lebo Mothiba made it two for the home side. Youri Tielemans’ late penalty was only a consolation, with Monaco above bottom club Guingamp on goal difference.\n\nTheir six-point tally from 10 games this season is also the club’s worst start since the 1953-54 season. The result sees Strasbourg rise to sixth in the table, with the principality side left to focus on Wednesday’s Champions League group match at Club Brugge. Former France and Arsenal star Henry, who began his playing career at Monaco and helped them win Ligue 1 in 1997, was assistant manager of Belgium before joining the eight-time French champions.\n\nWe had backed Monaco to continue on their downward spiral despite their new coach and it proved to be accurate.\n\nRayo Vallecano vs Getafe\n\nOur 1st Pick: 2\n\nResult: 1-2\n\nWhat started out as a rather timid 1st half ended up as a thrilling clash in the 2nd between these two Spanish sides in the La Liga. This one had it all as it had both a sending off as well as an own goal that ended up as the match winner.\n\nThe game came to life in and around the 63rd minute when the visitors broke the deadlock courtesy of a Dimitri Foulquier goal that sent the away fans into ecstasy. Their joy was doubled when Sergio Akieme found the back of the net albeit on the wrong end to put the visitors two goals up with 20 minutes to go.\n\nThe hosts did pull one back via Raul De Tomas but it was a case of a little too late and their evening got even worse as Oscar Trejo was given his matching orders during extra time. The visitors then held on to a vital win in their quest for survival in the Spanish La Liga.\n\nInter vs AC Milan\n\nOur 1st Pick: X\n\nResult: 1-0\n\nInter Milan Captain, Mauro Icardi, scored a dramatic injury-time winner as they beat city rivals AC Milan at the San Siro in Serie A.\n\nThe 222nd Milan derby was petering out before the Argentine striker headed in Matias Vecino’s cross. Inter – who lost Radja Nainggolan to a first-half injury – were deserved winners, but it was a lacklustre game.\n\nThe closest either side came before the winner was Inter’s Stefan de Vrij hitting the post from close range. Icardi – who only touched the ball 15 times in the entire game – and AC Milan’s Mateo Musacchio both had goals correctly disallowed for offside. Inter move up to third with the victory – with AC Milan remaining 12th.\n\nhat’s it for another pulsating week of our sportpesa megajackpot post-match breakdown.

We managed to get 6/17 correct predictions which were poor by our standards. There were close calls and red cards that threw some of the games off not to mention a mind boggling total of 6 draws with 3 of them coming in the last 4 matches: but as always, we like to take on any loss as a challenge to do better. With that in mind, below is the breakdown of the results as well as an in depth look of our research methodology in the hopes that with each loss we all gain a lesson that could potentially set us on our way back to the Sportpesa Megajackpot Bonus once again in the coming week.\n\nPreston vs Wigan\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 4-0\n\nCallum Robinson scored twice as Preston impressively beat Wigan at Deepdale to move off the bottom of the Championship and end a 10-game winless run.\n\nTom Barkhuizen fired home the opener after neat build-up play in the first half. He then turned provider just after the break, creating space for Daniel Johnson to play in Robinson who slotted home.\n\nWigan’s task became huge moments later when former Manchester United midfielder Darron Gibson was sent off for a bad tackle on Ben Pearson.\n\nVictory was sealed with a few minutes left; Paul Gallagher scoring a penalty after Lukas Nmecha was fouled in the box, before Robinson turned in Sean Maguire’s pull-back to make it 4-0 deep into injury time.\n\nVictory was not quite enough to lift North End out of the relegation zone, with Reading just above them on goal difference. Wigan drop to 10th following their fifth defeat in 12 league games this season.\n\nWe had gone for a home win based on current form and it proved an accurate prediction as the hosts ran riot.\n\nQPR vs Derby\n\nOur 1st Pick: X\n\nResult: 1-1\n\nGeoff Cameron’s first goal for QPR earned the hosts a point and stopped Derby County moving into the Championship play-off places.\n\nCameron scored from 10 yards from a Nahki Wells cross after Rams keeper Scott Carson had saved Luke Freeman’s free-kick.The Rams led slightly against the run of play at the interval, Jack Marriott marking his first Championship start by drilling home after a defensive mix-up following Bradley Johnson’s long ball.\n\nBut Rangers responded impressively, Wells hitting the bar before Cameron’s leveller, just QPR’s ninth goal in 12 league matches this season, rescued a draw.Rangers were unfortunate to trail at the interval, having created the better chances.\n\nMassimo Luongo and Jake Bidwell were both off target with decent opportunities before Marriott’s opener for the visitors.\n\nA powerful Tom Lawrence free-kick then tested Rs keeper Joe Lumley, but the hosts continued to look the sharper.\n\nThe lively Wells had a header easily saved and then smashed a fine shot against the bar from the left side of the penalty area. After Cameron’s neat leveller early in the second half, both sides could have earned the win late on. But Toni Leistner, the matchwinner for QPR against Reading in midweek, blasted a shot over, while Rams substitute Harry Wilson forced Lumley into a smart save.\n\nDerby, who have now lost just two of their past 15 away games at Loftus Road, are seventh while QPR slip to 18th in the table, five points above the relegation zone.\n\nPeterborough vs Barnsley\n\nOur 1st Pick: 2\n\nResult: 0-4\n\nBarnsley closed in on the automatic promotion places in League One with a 4-0 win at second-placed Peterborough. The Tykes had goalkeeper Adam Davies to thank for keeping out an early Ivan Toney penalty, with former Posh midfielder George Moncur scoring a minute later for the visitors before Brad Potts (twice) and Jacob Brown struck to move Barnsley within two points of their opponents.\n\nThings might have been different when Posh were awarded a penalty in the 13th minute for contact on Joe Ward by Dimitri Cavare.\n\nToney’s spot kick was well saved low down to his left by Davies, and Posh were punished a minute later when they failed to clear and the ball came to Moncur to score from close range.\n\nPotts then rifled in a 25-yard free-kick touched in his direction in first-half stoppage time, with the attacking midfielder finding the bottom corner from 20 yards after 59 minutes. Substitute Brown scored in the same corner in the 92nd minute to round off the win.\n\nWycombe vs Burton\n\nOur 1st Pick: X\n\nResult: 2-1\n\nAdebayo Akinfenwa’s 200th goal in English football and a penalty from Joe Jacobson secured Wycombe a 2-1 win against Burton.\n\nTwo goals in seven minutes set the Chairboys on their way to victory, although Marvin Sordell’s goal shortly after half-time threatened a Burton comeback.\n\nHowever, Wycombe held on for their first home League One victory of the season. After a quiet opening period, Craig Mackail-Smith was clumsily barged over in the box by Kyle McFadzean after 30 minutes and Jacobson stepped up to open the scoring on his 200th game for the Chairboys.\n\nRandell Williams then escaped his man and his cross from the left was met by Akinfenwa, whose powerful header extended his side’s lead. However, early in the second half, Liam Boyce’s inch-perfect ball left Sordell one-on-one with Ryan Allsop and he rounded the goalkeeper with ease to reduce the deficit. Burton had further opportunities with Sordell spooning over from close range but Wycombe saw out the rest of the game.\n\nPlymouth vs AFC Wimbledon\n\nOur 1st Pick: 2\n\nResult: 1-0\n\nPlymouth’s 12-match wait for a League One win ended as they beat Wimbledon 1-0 at Home Park thanks to Freddie Ladapo’s 75th minute winner.\n\nThe Argyle target man headed home after Graham Carey latched on to Ruben Lameiras’ short corner to send over an inch-perfect cross from the right.\n\nThe win lifted Argyle off the foot of the table ahead of their trip to basement side Oxford next Saturday. Argyle had threatened five minutes earlier when central defender Ryan Edwards headed just over from Carey’s corner from the left. Carey nearly made it 2-0 with a thumping shot minutes after the goal but keeper Joe McDonnell saved well down low at his post.\n\nArgyle’s on-loan Arsenal keeper Matt Macey made a save on the line to deny Jake Jervis from point blank range after 62 minutes. Former Argyle forward Jervis seemed certain to score when he side-footed skipper Deji Oshilaja’s cross towards goal at the far post but 6ft 7in Macey got down to turn the ball away to safety.\n\nJoe Pigott sent a shot just wide of goal after good work from Jervis as the second half started with Wimbledon on the front foot but the visitors could not find a way back into the game.\n\nMillwall vs Aston Villa\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 2-1\n\nCaretaker manager Kevin MacDonald warned Aston Villa’s players they need to “tidy up” their performances after seeing them beaten by Millwall despite taking an early lead.\n\nTammy Abraham gave MacDonald the perfect start to his third spell as Villa’s temporary boss, cleverly steering home Conor Hourihane’s free-kick on the volley after just seven minutes. But the first match since Bruce was sacked then turned sour with Shane Ferguson and Tom Elliott earning victory for the Lions.\n\nMillwall – winless in eight before Saturday – responded well to Abraham’s opener and deservedly levelled when Ferguson fired home Jake Cooper’s knockdown. Elliott’s second-half strike completed the turnaround to lift the Londoners out of the relegation zone and leave Villa with just one win in their past 10 Championship games.\n\nWith James Chester’s suspension and Mile Jedinak’s hamstring injury leaving makeshift pair Alan Hutton and Axel Tuanzebe at the centre of Villa’s defence, MacDonald opted for pragmatism further forward to protect his back four.\n\nThat meant Villa’s bench featured an array of attacking talent – worth more than £50m based on their most recent transfer fees. But the defensive approach failed to pay dividends as, despite Abraham’s early opener, Villa again failed to add to their solitary league clean sheet this season.\n\nAfter Ferguson’s leveller, Villa were relieved to get to half-time at 1-1 as Millwall’s Shaun Williams had a goal-bound shot blocked by Manchester United loanee Tuanzebe and whistled another strike just over from 30 yards.\n\nMore poor defending just three minutes into the second half allowed Elliott to drill the hosts in front after Villa failed to clear Ferguson’s cross. And despite a brief Villa rally – in which James Bree nodded inches wide – Neil Harris’ Lions could have won by more as a Williams header crashed back off the bar.\n\nThe victory was only Millwall’s second Championship win of the season and lifted them to 20th, leaving whoever succeeds Bruce at Villa Park with much to ponder.\n\nCrystal Palace vs Wolverhampton\n\nOur 1st Pick: 2\n\nResult: 0-1\n\nCrystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson described his side’s performance as a “major disappointment” after Matt Doherty’s winner extended Wolves’ unbeaten Premier League run to six matches.\n\nRaul Jimenez put Doherty through on 56 minutes and, despite the tight angle, the full-back was able to beat Wayne Hennessey at his near post.\n\nAlthough the home side began confidently in the first ever Premier League meeting between the clubs, Hodgson’s team were wasteful in the final third. Nuno Espirito Santo set a Premier League record by naming an unchanged starting XI for an eighth consecutive opening fixture, and Wolves arrived at Selhurst Park as the in-form side.\n\nThe visitors had to be patient to force a decisive breakthrough against Southampton last time out, and it was a similar story in south London, where the hosts began largely in control. But Nuno’s men have remained committed to their expansive style of play – and once again that paid off as the adventurous Doherty unlocked the Palace defence with a great finish.\n\nIt’s no coincidence that eight of Wolves’ nine league goals have come in the second half, and they demonstrated their ability to gradually wear down their opponents’ resistance.\n\nWhile their attacking players will continue to receive plaudits, the Wolves defence – and Patricio in particular on this occasion – were excellent, allowing their side to keep a fourth clean sheet in five league matches. And although Cavaleiro probably should have doubled the advantage late on, victory means Wolves are now seventh on 15 points.\n\nGrimsby Town vs Port Vale\n\nOur 1st Pick: 2\n\nResult: 2-0\n\nGoals from Wes Thomas and JJ Hooper saw Grimsby pick up their first home league win of the season as they beat Port Vale. Just over 30 seconds into the game, Grimsby found themselves ahead as Mitchell Clark sold Scott Brown short with a back-pass, with Thomas latching onto it before rounding the goalkeeper and rolling the ball into the empty net.\n\nChances were few and far between for both sides for the rest of the first half, although Tom Pope went close for Vale as he flashed a volley just over the crossbar.\n\nGrimsby should have doubled their lead just after the break when the ball broke to Hooper in a great position inside the penalty area, but the forward could only strike the ball against the post.\n\nHe made no mistake moments later though as Thomas and Charles Vernam linked up well on the edge of the box, with the latter playing the ball across the face of goal for Hooper to tap home and earn his side their second victory of the week.\n\nBury vs Mansfield\n\nOur 1st Pick: X\n\nResult: 2-2\n\nNicky Maynard’s stoppage-time goal earned Bury a point against Mansfield Town.Maynard slid home his second of the game from 15 yards five minutes into seven of added time at the end. Mansfield scored a bizarre opening goal after 10 minutes. Danny Rose profited as the ball slipped out of Joe Murphy’s grasp when the Bury keeper prepared to make a regulation clearance, and the ex-Bury striker tapped the loose ball into an unguarded net from five yards.\n\nMurphy atoned for his clanger minutes later when he saved superbly from Otis Khan, while Rose should have made it two after half an hour but fired wide from 15 yards. After the restart, Khan went on a terrific run before curling an exquisite shot inches wide.\n\nBury then evened the score spectacularly in the 55th minute. Nicky Adams headed the ball hopefully towards Nicky Maynard eight yards from goal, and the Bury striker swivelled superbly before lashing home with a breathtaking scissor kick.\n\nThe Stags regained the lead after 73 minutes when defender Matt Preston powerfully headed home Timi Elsnik’s corner, but Maynard had the final say.\n\nMacclesfield vs Notts County\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 0-1\n\nA late Jon Stead penalty earned Notts County victory over Macclesfield. The hosts are still without a win this season, and had been good value for a point before centre-back Fiacre Kelleher gifted possession to Enzio Boldewijn, who bore down on goal, where keeper Kieran O’Hara committed a foul that virtually handed the visitors victory.\n\nThe spot-kick still had to be put away but in Stead, the Magpies had just the man for the job, and he sent O’Hara the wrong way eight minutes from time to give Notts their third straight win.\n\nMacc had shaded a first half with precious few openings for either side. The stalemate continued after the break, with the home side producing decent build-up play without a final ball, and Notts County content to sit deep.\n\nAnd with nine minutes left on the clock, Kelleher’s moment of madness led to the goal, after which substitute Nathan Thomas almost added a second for the visitors.\n\nSwindon Town vs Northampton\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 1-1\n\nMatt Taylor’s free-kick rescued a point for Swindon as they came from behind against Northampton at the County Ground. The home side should have broken the deadlock after just seven minutes when James Dunne had his close-range shot saved by David Cornell.\n\nSwindon came close to taking the lead again as clever link-up play eventually saw Cornell deny Marc Richards with another save. Northampton had to wait until the 22nd minute before their first real opportunity fell to Sam Hoskins, who broke free before seeing his shot parried against the post.\n\nThe visitors came alive after the break and almost went ahead through Andy Williams, only for Swindon’s Taylor to deny him a chance from six yards out.\n\nHowever, they didn’t have to wait long for their goal which came in the 58th minute when John-Joe O’Toole volleyed in from a Hoskins cross but Swindon responded in emphatic fashion, Taylor curling his free-kick into the top corner from 25 yards out.\n\nStevenage vs Colchester\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 3-1\n\nKurtis Guthrie scored against his old club as Stevenage recovered to beat Colchester in a feisty encounter at Broadhall Way.\n\nColchester went ahead after 86 seconds when Sammie Szmodics tapped in from three yards at the far post, from Ryan Jackson’s low cross.\n\nSzmodics and Luke Norris had opportunities soon after, as Colchester pressed for a second.\n\nBut Guthrie went close with a deflected long-range effort before the former Colchester striker equalised four minutes before half-time when he tapped home at the far post, after Scott Cuthbert had headed on Joel Byrom’s corner.\n\nStevenage nearly scored again early in the second half when half-time substitute Emmanuel Sonupe’s acrobatic effort was saved well by Dillon Barnes.\n\nStevenage goalkeeper Seny Dieng denied Norris before Ben Kennedy slotted the hosts ahead from the spot with eight minutes remaining, after Steve Seddon had been fouled by substitute Brennan Dickenson in the area.\n\nAnd two minutes later, Sonupe wrapped up Stevenage’s win when he calmly lifted a shot past Barnes, from Guthrie’s pass.\n\nMorecambe vs Tranmere\n\nOur 1st Pick: 2\n\nResult: 3-4\n\nA Harvey Gilmour double inspired Tranmere to victory against Morecambe in a superb and fiery encounter at the Globe Arena.\n\nOn-loan Sheffield United man Gilmour was Rovers’ hero as his sensational second in the 89th minute won it for the visitors. Morecambe took the lead with a superb individual goal from Rhys Oates after 13 minutes. The Morecambe forward made it three goals from three games with a superb, low 25-yard shot that flew past Scott Davies and into the bottom corner.\n\nThe visitors hit back just before the half-hour mark with a well-worked free-kick. Gilmour floated the ball into the Morecambe area and Ollie Banks used his height and strength to head past Barry Roche from six yards out.\n\nThe Shrimps were denied a penalty for handball before Micky Mellon’s side took the lead four minutes before the break. Zoumana Bakayogo was found on the overlap down the left and produced the perfect cross for Gilmour to beat Roche with a diving header from eight yards out.\n\nRovers added a third on 54 minutes when Jonny Smith struck a sweet left-foot curler past Roche from the edge of the Morecambe box.\n\nThe game continued to flow from end to end, with Davies saving smartly from Liam Mandeville before the Shrimps added a second when Vadaine Oliver headed home Zak Mills’ cross from close range after 73 minutes. The home side then levelled seven minutes later when Andrew Tutte’s cross into the area was flicked by AJ Leitch-Smith past Davies from 12 yards out.\n\nThe action didn’t stop there, however, as Gilmour curled home Bakayogo’s lay-off to earn the win. The game ended with a fracas involving both sets of players, with Tranmere goalkeeping coach Eric Nixon being shown a red card.\n\nYeovil vs Exeter\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 2-2\n\nJayden Stockley took his season’s goal tally to eight with a brace as Exeter claimed a draw at Yeovil. Exeter asserted their authority after just nine minutes when Stockley headed in the opener. Hiram Boateng hung up the cross and goalkeeper Nathan Baxter failed to come out allowing the striker to nod in.\n\nYeovil were level after 48 minutes and it came from another defensive mistake, this time when Luke Croll’s header back to Christy Pym was weak and Olufela Olomola pounced on it before rounding the goalkeeper and laying it to Jordan Green to tap in.\n\nIn the 61st minute it was 2-1 to the Glovers with Olomola the provider again, beating Croll for pace from a long ball forward before crossing in for Alex Fisher to score. Stockley then scored his second of the day after 75 minutes when he found space in the box to head in a Dean Moxey cross and level.\n\nGuingamp vs Montpellier\n\nOur 1st Pick: 2\n\nResult: 1-1\n\nPrior to this highly anticipated French Ligue 1 match, both teams had met 30 times and drew 12 times while Guingamp wins 6 times and Montpellier winning 12 times. The stats were in favor of the away side but we backed the home side to win as they needed the win badly in order to escape being early candidates for the drop.\n\nThey were fighting for their first season win of the Coupa de la Ligue match in their home match as they tried to push on proceeding to the next level. The visitors broke the deadlock in and around the 30th minute via an Andy Delort goal and went into the break in the lead. By this point the hosts were already down to 10 men as Marcus Thuram was given the matching orders as early as the 7th minute.\n\nThe situation swung back in favor of the hosts though as Florent Mollet was sent off thus making it a 10v10 match just before halftime.\n\nThis spurred the hosts and they duly got their reward via a Nicolas Benezet equalizer just at the stroke of the hour mark. Both teams had chances to pull ahead but given the general play, a draw seemed a fair result.\n\nLiverpool vs Manchester City\n\nOur 1st Pick: 1\n\nResult: 0-0\n\nWe had backed the home side to carry the day based on historical records between this two sides but the rather dull affair proved to be an anticlimax.\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola were both left satisfied after a goalless draw left their sides level on points at the top of the Premier League.\n\nChampions City have not won a league game at Anfield in 15 years, and Riyad Mahrez wasted a glorious opportunity to send them clear when he missed a late penalty. City’s summer signing from Leicester fired an 85th-minute spot-kick high over the bar after substitute Leroy Sane was brought down by Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.\n\nIt handed the Reds a reprieve as both sides extended their unbeaten league starts to eight games, with City now top on goal difference from Chelsea and Liverpool. All three are level on 20 points. City felt they were denied two earlier penalties when Dejan Lovren bundled over Sergio Aguero and Van Dijk handled in an aerial challenge – referee Martin Atkinson waving away the first appeal and awarding a foul for a push by Fernandinho in the second incident.\n\nMahrez also squandered City’s other big chance in a game that failed to live up to expectations, dragging an effort wide, while keeper Ederson was virtually unemployed against Liverpool’s normally potent attack.\n\nThis Anfield confrontation was billed as a potential thrill ride between two sides who – along with Chelsea – have set the pace in the Premier League. It was not to be – this was a cagey and, at times, dull and tame affair.\n\nLiverpool’s attacking trident of Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane were unable to cause the damage they inflicted on City in last season’s Champions League quarter-final, while Guardiola’s intention was clearly to draw the early fire from Klopp’s side.\n\nCity had no intention of being drawn into the sort of Anfield battles that saw them over-run last season and led to suggestions that Klopp’s intense, pressing style was one that Guardiola could not master.\n\nLiverpool ran out of steam and ideas after the first 10 minutes, while City were content to slow matters down to throw cold water over the Anfield atmosphere – and in that respect it was highly effective as the home side, so irresistible in attack last season, barely troubled Ederson.\n\nKlopp’s side have now gone four games without a win after a flawless start to the season and the influence James Milner has on Liverpool was illustrated by their lack of direction after he went off injured in the first half. City was the better side, but neither was able to produce the decisive moment and spoils were thus shared by the end of regulation time. press association\n\nIK Start vs Sarpsborg\n\nOur 1st Pick: 2\n\nResult: 1-0\n\nIK Start came into this one having played 24 matches and at position 15 with 23 points in the 2018 Norway Eliteserein. Their opponents on the other hand having played 24 matches were at position 9 with 32 points. In their last 5 h2h Sarpsborg had won 4 times Start 1 with 1 draw for both sides. This explains why we backed the away team to carry the day.\n\nHowever, a last minute goal by Mathias Bringaker was enough to ensure a memorable victory for the hosts and in the process secured them 3 vital points. The home crowd was in fine volume as they spurred their team on to victory. It was a rather lacklustre match with chances coming far and in between.\n\nThat’s it for another pulsating week of our sportpesa megajackpot post-match breakdown.

Their record breaking signing, Neymar Jnr is set to undergo surgery in his homeland, Brazil while their budding French star, Kylian Mbappe an Marquinhos are still struggling in their quest to attain full fitness ahead of next week.\n\nAll eyes are therefore on Liberia’s prince Timothy Weah, son of the current Liberian President and African Footballing legend, George Weah. The African prodigy who opted to ply his trade for the U.S youth international squad, is part of the 18-man squad named by Emery to travel to Troyes as one of the only recognized striker alongside the likes of Angel di Maria and Julian Draxler.\n\nThe highly rated teenager has made seven appearances for PSG’s under-19 team in the UEFA Youth League this season and has already found the back of the net against Celtic last September. With the PSG manager stating that we should expect new faces in the weekend fixture, this should be a thrilling encounter.\n\nThis is simply a clash of two at opposite ends of the French League table. On paper, the home side who are more in need of the points as they sit 18th after 27 games on just 28 points. However, despite the loss of Neymar amongst other rested key players, we see PSG winning this game comfortably as their reserve team is capable of trumping the relegation battlers, Troyes. In the 20 previous games Troyes have won two while PSG have won 14 and four have been drawn. PSG comfortably won the reverse fixture 2-0 earlier in the season.\n\nTOTTENHAM HOTSPUR V HUDDERSFIELD TOWN\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKg_QSrM_o\n\nTottenham Hotspur are hoping to move up to 3rd in the Premier League with a win over the season English Premier League surprise package, Huddersfield on Saturday. Read on for all our free sportpesa predictions and betting tips.\n\nTottenham looked like they would struggle on Wednesday night in their FA Cup tie as they went into the break tied 1-1 with Rockdale at Wembley after an incident packed first half where the failures of VAR proved to be the main talking point. The second half quickly put any potential cup upsets that have been a constant presence in the FA Cup to rest though, as Spurs ran riot to eventually win 6-1 and book their place in the next round of the FA Cup.\n\nThis extends the North Londoners unbeaten run to an impressive 16 games in all competitions, including a shock away come back resulting in a draw against Juventus in the Champions League and wins over Arsenal and Manchester United.\n\nIn the English Premier League alone they are enjoying the longest current unbeaten streak of all the teams, winning seven and drawing three of their last ten outings. This has propelled them up into the top four, and a win on Saturday could send them up to 3rd and just one point behind Manchester United who currently sit in 2nd.\n\n“We’re on a 16-game unbeaten run in all competitions and I expect us to pick up three more points against Huddersfield. And with quite a few of our fringe players having played in the midweek FA Cup game against Rochdale, there’s strong competition for places and we now seem to have players like Moura and Lamela who can come off the bench to change a game. And with the stadium nearly finished, a 10 point gap over Arsenal, and the visit of Juventus in the Champions League coming up, we’re excited and optimistic about the future. Llorente showed his class midweek and if he can come off the bench as super sub and grab some goals then we have another game-changer in our squad.” Mauricio\n\nHuddersfield on the other hand have enjoyed a vital resurgence recently though, winning their last two in the Premier League and subsequently pulling themselves away from the hotly contested relegation zone. They are still only three points above the bottom three though, so there’s still a lot to fight for as dropping points could send them right back to the dog fight at the English Primier League Table.\n\nThe Terriers are unlikely to pull further clear of danger this weekend though as they are up against a really good Spurs side with Dembele drawing praise from fans and critics alike for his exemplary displays of late. Away from home, they have lost nine of their 14 Premier League games, and none of their wins or draws have come against sides in the top six.\n\nMeanwhile, Spurs have banished their Wembley hoodoo and are currently enjoying a 13-match unbeaten streak in the English capital. They have won nine of the last 11 and kept a clean sheet in six of these matches. Considering the fact that Huddersfield have failed to score in every single one of their away losses this season, backing a Tottenham Win looks like a great bet.\n\nAt Multibet Kenya, we have free Sportpesa Today Games Predictions every week!\n\nHuddersfield do have some memorable moments which they will never forget in their previous visit to Wembley for last season’s Championship play-off – in which they beat Reading albeit on penalties – and their recent wins over Bournemouth and West Brom have boosted their hopes of staying up. This trip feels like a free hit; nothing to lose and everything to gain, although it will be tough\n\nHarry Kane, arguably the 2017/2018 player of the season scored twice as Spurs comfortably beat the Terriers 4-0 in September and another convincing win could see them end the weekend five points ahead of the reigning Premier League champions, with Chelsea up against Manchester City on Sunday.\n\nHuddersfield have won back-to-back league games for the first time since the opening two weeks of the season to boost their survival hopes. In terms of team news, Tottenham are hoping to welcome back highly rated centre-backs Jan Vertonghen (ankle) and Toby Alderweireld (thigh). Their manager, Mauricio Pochettino said on Tuesday that Vertonghen could be fit for this weekend’s encounter.\n\nThe pair both missed a league game for Spurs for the first time since 2015 last weekend, with Davinson Sanchez and Eric Dier tasked with filling in a back four against Crystal Palace. Heung-min Son may have played his way back into the starting XI after a dazzling showing as Spurs hit six against Rochdale in the aforementioned midweek FA Cup tie, while new signing Lucas Moura put in another eye-catching shift.\n\nHuddersfield star player, Aaron Mooy (knee) is in a tight race to be fit to face Tottenham but Huddersfield are more confident over Chris Lowe (hamstring) and Philip Billing (ill) being fit and ready for this crunch tie.\n\nSean Scannell (shoulder), Elias Kachunga and Jon Stankovic (both knee) are still a few weeks after from a return.\n\nIn summary:\n\nTottenham Hotspur are unbeaten in six games in all competitions against Huddersfield (W3 D3), since a 1-2 home defeat in April 1956.\n\nHuddersfield Town haven’t lost both league meetings with Spurs in a single season since the 1953-54 top-flight campaign, though this is only the fifth campaign they’ve met in since then.\n\nSpurs are unbeaten in their last 33 Premier League games against newly promoted sides (W31 D2) since a 0-1 loss at QPR in April 2012.\n\nIndeed, they’ve won their last 15 in a row against promoted sides – the third longest such run in Premier League history (Chelsea: 27 between 2002 and 2006 and Manchester United: 17 between 2006 and 2009).\n\nThe Terriers are unbeaten in their last four competitive visits to Wembley Stadium (W1 D3), with the last two finishing 0-0, both of which they won on penalties.\n\nSpurs are currently enjoying the Premier League’s longest unbeaten run (10 games – W7 D3 L0), last losing at Manchester City in December.\n\nSince the start of last season, Spurs have lost just one of their 33 Premier League home games, picking up 84 points from those games – more than any other side (W26 D6 L1).\n\nHarry Kane’s 24 goals for Spurs this season in the Premier League have been worth 14 points – the most of any player in the competition in 2017-18.\n\nIf Kane scores, he’ll be the third player to have scored 25+ goals in three consecutive Premier League campaigns, after Alan Shearer (four seasons between 93-94 and 96-97) and Thierry Henry (three seasons between 03-04 to 05-06).\n\nJan Vertonghen is a slight doubt for Spurs as he recovers from an ankle injury, whilst Toby Alderweireld will be left out after suffering a setback in his path back to recovery.\n\nPhilip Billing, Aaron Mooy, and Chris Lowe are all doubts for the visiting Huddersfield, whilst Jon Stankovic, Elias Kachunga, and Sean Scannell are all injured too.\n\nWe are going for a Spurs win as they have been in exceptional form since mid-December.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulx2ctCsRR4\n\nZENIT V AMKAR\n\nZenit started the season with huge ambitions under former Manchester City manager, Roberto Mancini. Nonetheless, their pursuit of the Russian League has been halted with a dreadful series of results back in October (five straight league matches without a win) forcing them to go into the winter break with an eight-point deficit to high-flying and runaway leaders Lokomotiv Moscow.\n\nWith only ten games left to play until the end of the season, it’s clear that Mancini’s men simply cannot afford any slip-ups, especially against the bottom-half sides like Amkar Perm’. The visitors did not change their squad much compared to the first half of the season and it’s pretty clear that they will be in for a huge clash in their quest to maintain top flight status until the end of the season.\n\nZenit vs Amkar Perm: Head-to-head record,\n\nZenit have won 7, drawn 6 and lost none of their 13 home matches against Amkar Perm’. Overall, Amkar have only won 3 of 29 H2H clashes with Zenit.\n\nOnly one of last five meetings has seen both teams on the score line.\n\nZenit vs Amkar Perm’: our Prediction\n\nZenit are massive favourites and we do expect to see a pleasant afternoon for the home team fans at Stadion Krestovskyi.\n\nAmkar have been struggling for goals ever since the start of the season and thus we are backing a convincing home win.\n\nGOR MAHIA v BANDARI\n\nBandari welcomed their manager Kerr to the Kenyan Premier League with a win over Gor Mahia in the GOtv Shield last season. Gor Mahia are set to throw out a scary attacking lineup as the league defending champions go all out for Bandari’s scalp. Coach Dylan Kerr named both Jacques Tuyisenge and Meddie Kagere in his starting squad, same as Francis Kahata who makes a return to the team’s first starting eleven. Kerr, who watched Bandari eliminate Gor Mahia out of GOtv Shield last season, has also included George Odhiambo and Ernest Wendo in his starting squad while highly rated Humphrey Mieno has been rested for the tie. It will be a 14th meeting between the two sides in the league, and as expected K’Ogalo, the record breaking champions lead the way with seven wins\n\nBoth on paper and on the pitch, Gor Mahia have the strongest team, and have not stuck to the same line up since the season started. On Wednesday, they managed to get a draw. When the two teams met last season in the reverse fixture, goals from Innocent Wafula and Godffrey Walusimbi reduced Noah Abich’s strike to just but a mere consolation.\n\nThe last time Gor Mahia lost to Bandari in the Kenyan Primier league match was back in 2014 when they succumbed to a 2-1 defeat. Gor Mahia: Godffrey Walusimbi scored and provided an assist in the reverse fixture last season, and he will definitely be one to watch.\n\nBandari FC Defender Benard Odhiambo proved to be the star against Wazito, and this time round, he should need no further motivation as he comes up against the champions, Gor Mahia. Former Muhoroni Youth star man Wycliffe Ochomo was not at his best in the team’s last outing, and he will defibtely need to work harder to score against Gor Mahia.\n\nWe are firmly going in with awin for Gor Mahia.\n\nLAZIO V JUVENTUS\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVYq-coJZpY\n\nThese two sides couldn’t have had as different levels of success in midweek. Lazio crashed out of the Copa Italia on penalties while, Juventus secured a meeting with AC Milan in the cup final by making light work of Atalanta by winning 2-0 on aggregate. The champions still remain in with a high chance of another domestic double, while securing a treble is firmly in their hands after a couple of near misses in recent years. However, the Old Lady have work to do in Serie A, as they’re a point off surprise leaders Napoli as we head into a huge weekend in Italy.\n\nSimply put, Max Allegri’s Juventus need to make sure that they come out of this clash with three points if they are to stand any chance at pushing the league leaders Napoli all the way to the wire.\n\nHowever, Lazio come in to this clash in great form and they should prove a tough nut to crack. Juventus are unbeaten in their last 12 league games (W11 D1) and have conceded just one goal during this period. In their last 13 matches across Serie A and the Copa Italia, they have gone on to rack up a commendable 13 victories, while they’ve won 12 of those matches to nil. They’ve got to be on a high with that form behind them, and that should see them claim some revenge for their loss at home to Lazio in the reverse fixture earlier on in the season.\n\nThe fact that Lazio have an awful record in this particular fixture probably helps matters for the away side, too. They are without a win at home to Juventus in Serie A since December 2003 – with nine defeats and three draws in the process. Juventus have won their last four away matches to the Aquile, all of which have been without conceding a goal. Given their form, we’re backing a win for Juventus.\n\nNAPOLI V ROMA\n\nThis Saturday evening brings us a mouth-watering clash between Napoli and Roma. We all have been waiting an for opportunity like this to place our bets and earn some good money. Napoli hold the better record in the past six encounters held in Naples against the history-rich Roma with four wins, one draw and one defeat. The last match ended 1:3. With an average of 2.5 in terms of number of goals.\n\nNapoli has twenty-two wins, three draws and one loss after twenty-six rounds of the 2017/2018 season. Their last match was against Cagliari and the league leaders made minced meat of the opposition in that particular encounter. Jose Callejon scored after twenty-nine minutes of play to make it 0:1. Three minutes before half time, Dries Mertens made it 0:2 with a well worked goal. Marek Hamsik scored in sixty-first minute to make 0:3 to pull the match beyond reach. To add salt to injury, in the seventy-second minute, referee pointed to the spot and Lorenzo Insigne had no trouble in scoring to bring the match to 0:4. Mario Rui made it 0:5 in the dying minute to make it a total rout.\n\nNapoli has ten wins, two draws and one loss at home. Their form is currently great because they’ve won five consecutive home matches. The Napoli attackers have managed to score thirty goals in front of their home fans and that sets their mind at ease ahead of match this tantalizing match against Roma.\n\nRoma find themselves in fifth place after twenty-six rounds and they suffered defeat a week ago. They were up against AC Milan and despite a stalemate after the half-time mark, the Rossoneri took the lead after only three minutes of play in second half of the match to make it 0:1. Victory was confirmed in seventy-fourth minute when Ac Milan made it 0:2. Roma have seven wins, four draws and one loss in their away matches. The team from Rome conceded only six goals all their away games. They have also scored at least once in their last four matches.\n\nEnjoy what promises to be an excellent football match on paper at least when Napoli come face to face with Roma and try to earn money with our predictions and Sportpesa betting tips.\n\nIn this particular match anything is possible and we expect lots of scoring chances and goals. Maybe Napoli have the edge to win all three points if current form is anything to go by, but it will not be an easy job. Our risky bet goes on to back Napoli to walk away with all three points as they have been on a hot streak this season when it comes to winning the big clashes.\n\nAll the best in your picks for Sportpesa Games today!
