        "text": "The Energy Storage Team at SFW had our annual spring gathering last month. The event more or less coincided with my 2-year work anniversary at SFW and was an opportunity to catch up with our team members who are spread out across multiple locations in different countries. The serene surroundings of the Nuuksio National Park (a short drive from our offices in Espoo) provided a perfect backdrop for our discussions. Nature-based activities and a team bbq lunch also provided opportunities for some relaxation and informal discussions with team members and colleagues who closely work with us from other departments. Some reflections after this gathering and after having completed 2 years with SFW and in Finland: üå° We had our gathering during a \"heat wave\" in Finland. Finland experienced a warmer than usual, dry May in 2024 with many parts of the country experiencing a higher number of days where the temperature exceeded 20 Celsius. While I am not an expert to draw a link to climate change, anecdotal evidence appears to suggest that these events are becoming commonplace, thereby increasing the urgent need to transition our energy systems as soon as possible. In some ways, being involved in the energy industry and commercializing solutions which can accelerate this transition indeed gives me a sense of greater purpose at work. ü§ù Importance of a positive work environment - a cursory glance at my LinkedIn profile will tell you that I have worked in some great organizations with fantastic teams. A common thread in most of my jobs was being part of a tight-knit team working more or less in a start-up mode. I have been lucky to avoid any \"toxic\" work environments in my career and SFW is absolutely a great place to work. Supportive team mates, empathy from the management and the highly flexible workplace make it easy for employees to enjoy a healthy working environment suited for the modern day workplace. While no company is perfect, the overall direction at SFW is oriented towards of becoming a great place to work. üë®üíº Being mentored and being a mentor - With the size of our team, I have had the chance to get mentored by some great colleagues with more years of experience. This is true especially in developing my softer skills such as being able to sell, market, talk with customers, work with other team mates and so on. As our team evolves and grows with an influx of young, talented and enthusiastic members, the opportunities to provide mentorship also grow and I have been able to reflect on my own experiences and share those with our new team members, hopefully speeding up their career development. All in all, it has been an exciting 2 years in a job which has given me a sense of purpose, great team mates and opportunities to grow. I look forward to growing the business, learning and sharing in the years to come, supported by an amazing team. #anniversary #ldes #workplace #purpose\n\nThis week was so intense, but so far productive in a same time. Even when I came back home from TRAKO, feeling sick and spending over a day in bed, it didn't stop me. I‚Äôm getting better now and I‚Äôm looking forward to continue some of fantastic discussions started this week in Gda≈Ñsk. During TRAKO POLAND I had the privilege of meeting so many fantastic people, engaging in great discussions about the current developments in the railway industry sector, and it was an absolute pleasure meeting many of you in person. I also had the opportunity to explore new technologies and learn more. During some interactions, I couldn't help but notice something important. Many individuals, despite having brilliant solutions, often followed their positive statements with a \"BUT.\" They'd say, something like: \"We have a great solution, BUT the market is not ready for that yet,\" or \"We're too expensive.\" Let‚Äôs start doing it in the opposite way and say it something like that instead: ‚ÄúThe market is struggling with repeating the same things, BUT we have great solutions to fix that‚Äù. Remember, if you don't believe in yourself, don't expect others to believe in you either. Confidence in your vision and your ability to make it happen is the foundation for success. Embrace your ideas, stay committed, and watch how belief in yourself can move mountains! üí™üåü #BelieveInYourself #Confidence #NoExcuses #PositiveMindset #SuccessMindset #KeepGoing #EnablingFutureMobility\n\nüì∏ Recapping the 7th CharIN Testival in Europe and the 3rd CharIN Conference EUROPE, held at the amazing facilities of our host Ekoenergetyka in Zielona G√≥ra, Poland. A resounding success in shaping the future of e-mobility While a picture can capture a moment, it's your presence and active participation that truly made this CharIN Testival and Conference a success. üôè We extend our heartfelt thanks to our host, Ekoenergetyka, and to all the attendees, speakers, and organizers who brought their energy and enthusiasm to the event. Stats & Facts CharIN Conference & Testival EUROPE Poland 2024: √ó Over 470 attendees at the CharIN Conference & CharIN Testival: √ó The biggest CharIN Conference & Testival in history so far. √ó Over 270 attendees of the CharIN Conference √ó Over 200 attendees of the CharIN Testival √ó 34 highly renowned electric mobility speakers and panelists at the CharIN Conference √ó 30 different testing electric mobility companies at the CharIN Testival √ó 10 Test slots, 2 of them with dynamic pairing option ‚Äì where participating companies could choose test partners. √ó 6 electric trucks, 9 electric cars, 14 charging stations, 4 test systems: 6 electric trucks, the highest number of heavy-duty vehicles we ever had at a Testival.

They are the architects of dreams, shaping the future one lesson at a time. In my beloved Zambia and across Africa, education stands as a beacon of hope, yet inequalities persist. We must bridge the gap, ensuring every child has access to quality education, regardless of their background. Education is not just a privilege; it's a fundamental right. Global disparities further emphasize the need for a united effort. The transformative power of technology can play a pivotal role. Let's harness the potential of AI, VR, and other innovations to create inclusive learning environments. In doing so, we equip our youth with the tools to thrive in an ever-evolving world. As someone deeply passionate about education, I believe it's our collective responsibility to drive change. Let's foster collaboration, embrace technology, and empower educators to mold a future where education knows no bounds. #educationforall #inclusivefuture #edutech\n\nüåÖGrowth and Positivity with the Longer Days at Bua Nua üöÄ As Ireland relishes the 'grand stretch' of brighter evenings, we at Bua Nua are also embracing a period of growth and positivity. Just as the extended daylight lifts our spirits, we believe in the power of clear and effective communication to illuminate our workplaces. üåû The Light of Clarity: In these longer days, let's draw inspiration from the natural light that brightens our world. Clear communication is akin to this light, dispelling shadows of misunderstanding and illuminating paths to higher productivity and enhanced team morale. üîç Transparency and Continuous Improvement: Our ethos at Bua Nua is deeply rooted in the principles of transparency and relentless improvement. We understand that these values are essential for a thriving business environment, much like the essential role of sunlight in nurturing life. üåü A Brighter Future for Businesses: As the days grow longer, let it be a metaphor for the limitless possibilities that lie ahead. With clear communication and a commitment to continuous improvement, we are ushering in a brighter future for businesses everywhere. At Bua Nua, we're more than just a platform; we're a beacon of positive change.
