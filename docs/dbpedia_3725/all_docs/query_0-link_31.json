        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe information in this preview is complete to 5pm on Wednesday 1 August 2018. Managerial data is as accurate as I can make it: it is almost impossible to identify the exact dates managers joined or left minor non-league clubs 25 years ago, and detailed statistical information for minor leagues is not readily available. Online statistics databases have not been used due to the errors they can contain. As I have compiled the figures myself, any errors, therefore, are my fault entirely. Firstly, sincere apologies to the subjects; secondly, any errors should be minor and not affect the overall impression; thirdly, it will be more accurate than Wikipedia.\n\nAn average points per game figure is given for each manager. In order to translate that into something more tangible, the table below shows how many points that figure equates to over the course of a 46-game season. Although other factors obviously come into play, it gives an indication of how likely that manager is to be involved in a relegation struggle (under 1.20 PPG), a play-off challenge (above 1.50 PPG needed) or an automatic promotion challenge (above 1.70 PPG needed).\n\nAs for the player sections, permanent transfers and longer-term loans in are included; shorter-term loans and season-long loans out are not included.\n\nOnly regular pre-season friendlies are listed. Those played behind closed doors frequently follow irregular formats and feature high numbers of trialists, rendering the results irrelevant.\n\nMANSFIELD TOWN\n\nLast season: 8th\n\nP46 W18 D18 L10 F67 A52 Pts72\n\nAverage attendance: 4,308\n\nChairman: John Radford, 52 (appointed September 2010)\n\nManager: David Flitcroft, 44 (appointed March 2018)\n\nDavid Flitcroft’s managerial record:\n\nLeague games only – playoffs and cup games not included.\n\nPlayers out (9):\n\nGoalkeepers (0):\n\nDefenders (4):\n\nJohnny Hunt, 27 (Stevenage)\n\nRhys Bennett, 26 (Peterborough United)\n\nGeorge Taft, 25 (Cambridge United)\n\nPaul Digby, 23 (Forest Green Rovers)\n\nMidfielders (4):\n\nJoel Byrom, 31 (Stevenage)\n\nAlfie Potter, 29 (Untraced)\n\nJack Thomas, 22 (Untraced)\n\nLewis Collins, 21 (Cleethorpes Town)\n\nForwards (1):\n\nJimmy Spencer, 26 (Untraced)\n\nPlayers in (5):\n\nGoalkeepers (0):\n\nDefenders (1):\n\nMatt Preston, 23 (Swindon Town)\n\nMidfielders (2):\n\nNeal Bishop, 36 (Scunthorpe United)\n\nOtis Khan, 22 (Yeovil Town)\n\nForwards (2):\n\nCraig Davies, 32 (Oldham Athletic)\n\nTyler Walker, 21 (Nottingham Forest – season loan)\n\nAverage age of players out: 26\n\nAverage age of players in: 27\n\nNumber of players in squad: 23\n\nOne to watch: Tyler Walker, 21 (striker)\n\nSeason ticket sales: 1,443\n\nPre-season:\n\nP8 W5 D2 L1 F15 A4\n\n7/7 Vitória Sport Clube N 0-1 (played in Albufeira, Portugal)\n\n12/7 Bradford Park Avenue A 3-0\n\n14/7 Retford United A 5-0\n\n14/7 Hednesford Town A 0-0\n\n18/7 DERBY COUNTY H 3-1\n\n21/7 SHEFFIELD UNITED H 0-0\n\n24/7 SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY H 2-1\n\n28/7 ROTHERHAM UNITED H 2-1\n\nCommentary:\n\nHere is the million-dollar question: do Mansfield have a similar budget to last season? Their bold and ultimately misguided attempt to buy promotion went horribly wrong of course, perhaps allowing Lincoln into the playoffs through that failure. The departure of controversial manager Steve Evans in March did not help that drive, although Mansfield presumably knew what they were getting when they employed him. A massive fine for owner John Radford from the Financial Conduct Authority set the seal on a year to forget at Field Mill, although there is no sign of it affecting his ability to invest in Mansfield Town.\n\nWith Evans gone, new manager David Flitcroft could not maintain the promotion push and now appears to be trying to sort out the mess left behind. Three Evans signings – Joel Byrom, Jimmy Spencer and Alfie Potter – have already been released, while six members of Evans’ 2017 summer spree were made available for transfer despite being under contract. Quite how much money he has in his budget may depend on how many of Evans’ expensive errors he can move on, but the evidence seems to suggest the coffers are not empty regardless. Highly-rated young striker Tyler Walker has arrived on a season loan from Nottingham Forest on wages rumoured to make Simon Cowell gasp, while industrious midfielder Otis Khan from Yeovil looks the best of the rest for a mere £100,000. The Stags suffered a blow late in the transfer window when Danny Rose handed in a transfer request after a number of offers for him were rejected.\n\nLike the Imps, Mansfield are also developing their infrastructure through the construction of a new training ground. The £2m facility at Pleasley benefits from a £500,000 grant from the Premier League & FA Facilities Fund, a condition of which stipulates that the facility must be made available for local community use. It will also be used by the club’s academy and Mansfield Town Ladies. The rest of the money comes from a company owned by John Radford.\n\nA highlight for many during the summer was an ill-advised appearance on BBC’s Question Time by CEO Carolyn Radford, who proved unequivocally that she is not Karren Brady. If nothing else, the Mansfield Town Theatre of the Bizarre promises to keep the rest of us entertained regardless of what happens on the pitch. And who knows? With the sorry Evans episode consigned to history, perhaps Mansfield can even become likeable again.\n\nAt the bookies (Ladbrokes): 10/1 (fourth favourites)\n\nPrediction: Playoffs.\n\nMILTON KEYNES DONS\n\nLast season: 23rd in League One (relegated)\n\nP46 W11 D12 L23 F43 A69 Pts45\n\nAverage attendance: 9,202\n\nChairman: Pete Winkelman, 60 (appointed March 2004)\n\nManager: Paul Tisdale, 45 (appointed June 2018)\n\nPaul Tisdale’s managerial record:\n\nLeague games only – playoffs and cup games not included.\n\nPlayers out (7):\n\nGoalkeepers (0):\n\nDefenders (2):\n\nScott Wootton, 26 (Plymouth Argyle)\n\nBen Tilney, 21 (Larne)\n\nMidfielders (5):\n\nNigel Reo-Coker, 34 (Training with West Bromwich Albion)\n\nEd Upson, 28 (Bristol Rovers)\n\nGiorgio Rasulo, 21 (Untraced)\n\nConnor Furlong, 20 (Untraced)\n\nHugo Logan, 19 (Untraced)\n\nForwards (0):\n\nPlayers in (9):\n\nGoalkeepers (0):\n\nDefenders (4):\n\nMathieu Baudry, 30 (Doncaster Rovers)\n\nMitch Hancox, 24 (Macclesfield Town)\n\nJordan Moore-Taylor, 24 (Exeter City)\n\nBaily Cargill, 23 (AFC Bournemouth)\n\nMidfielders (4):\n\nRyan Harley, 33 (Exeter City)\n\nLawson D’Ath, 25 (Luton Town)\n\nRyan Watson, 25 (Barnet)\n\nJordan Houghton, 22 (Chelsea)\n\nForwards (1):\n\nRobbie Simpson, 33 (Exeter City)\n\nAverage age of players out: 24\n\nAverage age of players in: 27\n\nNumber of players in squad: 31\n\nOne to watch: Kieran Agard, 28 (striker)\n\nSeason ticket sales:\n\nPre-season:\n\nP7 W3 D1 L3 F10 A5\n\n7/7 Newport Pagnell Town A 3-0\n\n9/7 St Neots Town A 5-1\n\n13/7 Brackley Town A 0-1\n\n18/7 UD Almería N 0-0 (played at Pinatar Arena, Murcia)\n\n20/7 FC Jumilla N 1-2 (played at Pinatar Arena, Murcia)\n\n24/7 IPSWICH TOWN H 0-1\n\n27/7 OXFORD UNITED H 1-0\n\nCommentary:\n\nFollowing a somewhat unexpected relegation in May, MK Dons find themselves having to rebuild from the bottom. Three wins from four games in March appeared to be carrying the side to safety, but a run of six successive defeats in April dumped them back into the basement division they left in 2008. Indeed, it is only two seasons since the club graced the Championship with ambitions of Premier League status, so they might be forgiven for blinking in surprise at their current plight.\n\nHowever, the post-relegation mourning period was refreshingly brief. Owner Pete Winkelman moved quickly to resolve the problem of the revolving door to his manager’s office by bringing in an experienced manager: Paul Tisdale joins after twelve years at Exeter, accompanied by three of his better players in Ryan Harley, Jordan Moore-Taylor and Robbie Simpson. The core to the squad is a solid one, and certainly one that never should have been relegated. Kieran Agard, in particular, will prove too good for League Two, whilst Moore-Taylor, Baily Cargill and Mathieu Baudry should ensure a firm defence. Crowds look set to hold up well, and will easily top 10,000 if the side starts winning again.\n\nIn terms of support, management and players, MK Dons appear to have all the hallmarks of a successful season ahead. A club with a capacity of 30,500 would naturally expect to be playing at Championship level as a minimum, and MK Dons are a fish out of water in League Two. They will certainly be one of the big fish that every other team in the division will be angling for, but it is hard to see anything less than a successful challenge for promotion.\n\nAt the bookies (Ladbrokes): 13/2 (second favourites)\n\nPrediction: Champions.\n\nMORECAMBE\n\nLast season: 22nd\n\nP46 W9 D19 L18 F41 A56 Pts46\n\nAverage attendance: 1,492\n\nChairman: Peter McGuigan, 68 (appointed 2000)\n\nManager: Jim Bentley, 42 (appointed May 2011)\n\nJim Bentley’s managerial record:\n\nLeague games only – playoffs and cup games not included.\n\nPlayers out (11):\n\nGoalkeepers (2):\n\nDan Nizic, 23 (Western Sydney Wanderers – Australia)\n\nNiall Maher, 19 (Untraced)\n\nDefenders (4):\n\nMichael Rose, 36 (Macclesfield Town)\n\nDean Winnard, 28 (Untraced)\n\nPatrick Brough, 22 (Falkirk)\n\nAaron McGowan, 22 (Hamilton Academical)\n\nMidfielders (0):\n\nForwards (5):\n\nAdam McGurk, 29 (Untraced)\n\nRhys Turner, 23 (Barrow)\n\nReece Deakin, 21 (Untraced)\n\nLuke Jordan, 19 (Ramsbottom United)\n\nSteven Yawson, 18 (Untraced)\n\nPlayers in (11):\n\nGoalkeepers (2):\n\nMark Halstead, 27 (Southport)\n\nDawid Szczepaniak, 18 (Airbus UK Broughton)\n\nDefenders (2):\n\nZak Mills, 26 (Grimsby Town)\n\nJordan Cranston, 25 (Cheltenham Town)\n\nMidfielders (2):\n\nAndrew Tutte, 27 (Bury)\n\nLamin Jagne, 20 (Manchester College)\n\nForwards (5):\n\nJames Sinclair, 30 (GAIS – Sweden)\n\nJason Oswell, 25 (Stockport County)\n\nRhys Oates, 23 (Hartlepool United)\n\nLiam Mandeville, 21 (Doncaster Rovers – season loan)\n\nCarlos Mendes Gomes, 19 (West Didsbury & Chorlton)\n\nAverage age of players out: 24\n\nAverage age of players in: 24\n\nNumber of players in squad: 24\n\nOne to watch: Barry Roche, 36 (goalkeeper)\n\nSeason ticket sales:\n\nPre-season:\n\nP4 W2 D1 L1 F8 A8\n\n10/7 Bamber Bridge A 2-1\n\n13/7 Alfreton Town A 3-2\n\n24/7 Chester A 2-2\n\n28/7 FLEETWOOD TOWN H 1-3\n\nCommentary:\n\nAfter years of financial struggle and inadequate cash flow, Morecambe FC was finally taken over by London-based Bond Group Investments Limited in May 2018. The new owners promised to pay off all significant debts and put money into the club, which they did in July (£750,000). The immediate future of the club is more secure, and at least the players may get paid regularly now. However, little money exists for building a squad capable of carrying the club away from perennial danger at the foot of the Football League, a challenge that has faced likeable manager Jim Bentley for the last seven seasons. Indeed, Bentley became the longest-serving manager in England after Paul Tisdale parted company with Exeter in June; considering Morecambe’s ongoing struggle for League survival, that represents a remarkable show of loyalty by both parties.\n\nA mix of experience and youth has been brought in during the summer, with striker James Sinclair returning to the Football League after a spell in Sweden. Stockport’s Jason Oswell will be keen to make his mark in the League at last at the age of 25, whilst the signings of youngsters Lamin Jagne and Carlos Mendes Gomes from Manchester College are very imaginative. Perhaps the most important signings came with the retention of old stagers Kevin Ellison and Barry Roche on one-year contracts. One big omission will be striker Garry Thompson, who will be out until December with a ruptured Achilles tendon suffered against Crewe in April.\n\nThe club appears to have made some bargain basement signings again this summer, but it must be remembered that Morecambe are fishing at the very bottom of the professional pool. To have kept the club in the big time despite gates dropping into three figures at times is no mean achievement. By rights, Morecambe should not really have a League club at all, given its population of under 35,000. This is one of those rare occasions when the manager’s relatively poor statistical returns have to be ignored. The headline at the Globe Arena is that Jim Bentley has somehow kept the club out of League Two’s bottom two for seven seasons in a row: the question is, can he make it eight?\n\nAt the bookies (Ladbrokes): 80/1 (favourites for relegation)\n\nPrediction: Relegation.\n\nNEWPORT COUNTY\n\nLast season: 11th\n\nP46 W16 D16 L14 F56 A58 Pts64\n\nAverage attendance: 3,489\n\nChairman: Gavin Foxall, 48 (appointed August 2015)\n\nManager: Michael Flynn, 37 (appointed March 2017 as caretaker, May 2017 permanently)\n\nMichael Flynn’s managerial record:\n\nLeague games only – playoffs and cup games not included.\n\nPlayers out (10):\n\nGoalkeepers (1):\n\nJames Bittner, 36 (Retired)\n\nDefenders (2):\n\nJamie Turley, 28 (Untraced)\n\nCalaum Jahraldo-Martin, 25 (Untraced)\n\nMidfielders (4):\n\nBen Tozer, 28 (Cheltenham Town)\n\nJoss Labadie, 27 (On trial with Dagenham & Redbridge)\n\nLamar Reynolds, 22 (Dagenham & Redbridge)\n\nTom Owen-Evans, 21 (Falkirk)\n\nForwards (3):\n\nPaul Hayes, 34 (Untraced)\n\nMarlon Jackson, 27 (Untraced)\n\nFrank Nouble, 26 (Colchester United)\n\nPlayers in (8):\n\nGoalkeepers (0):\n\nDefenders (2):\n\nFraser Franks, 27 (Stevenage)\n\nTyler Forbes, 22 (Brighton & Hove Albion)\n\nMidfielders (4):\n\nAndrew Crofts, 34 (Scunthorpe United)\n\nKeanu Marsh-Brown, 25 (Forest Green Rovers)\n\nCharlie Cooper, 21 (Forest Green Rovers – season loan)\n\nTyreeq Bakinson, 19 (Bristol City – loan until January)\n\nForwards (2):\n\nJamille Matt, 28 (Blackpool)\n\nAntoine Semenyo, 18 (Bristol City – season loan)\n\nAverage age of players out: 27\n\nAverage age of players in: 24\n\nNumber of players in squad: 25\n\nOne to watch: Keanu Marsh-Brown, 25 (winger)\n\nSeason ticket sales:\n\nPre-season:\n\nP5 W1 D2 L2 F4 A5\n\n13/7 Undy AFC N 1-1 (at Chepstow Town FC)\n\n14/7 Chippenham Town A 0-1\n\n18/7 Penybont A 0-0\n\n21/7 Hereford FC A 2-0\n\n28/7 STOKE CITY U23 H 1-3\n\nCommentary:\n\nPerennial financial problems continue to dominate in South Wales. The supporter-owned club has been forced to consult fans regarding its future ownership model. The club recently posted a £351,456 loss in the latest accounts (to June 2017) but claim last season’s FA Cup run will offset that amount in this year’s accounts. However, the cost of playing at Rodney Parade has apparently increased by 100% due to increased rents by the ground’s owners (the Welsh Rugby Union) to cover the cost of extensive health & safety and pitch works. Doubts have been raised over the viability of remaining at the ground despite being committed to a lease until 2023. With average attendances continuing to struggle in this rugby heartland, the £50,000 per annum rent may prove increasingly hard to find.\n\nIt would be fair to say that Newport had a great season in 2017-18, finishing in the top half of League Two as well as earning a fourth-round FA Cup replay against Spurs at Wembley. Unfortunately, they have lost the heart of that team during the summer. Two of the better players in Frank Nouble and Ben Tozer rejected contract offers to move to other League Two clubs, while injured captain and convicted vampire Joss Labadie unexpectedly decided to do likewise. On the positive side, new signing Keanu Marsh-Brown can be a handful on his day, the problem being that his day does not come often enough. Fraser Franks will make the defence more secure, and new skipper Andrew Crofts from Scunthorpe will offer organisation and nous in midfield.\n\nA very lacklustre pre-season schedule was far from being ideal preparation, and there is little to suggest that Newport can expect anything more than another mid-table season at best. But Michael Flynn has shown himself to be a clever manager despite his inexperience and appears unfazed by the ongoing financial challenges that remain. There will be no risk of relegation while he is in charge, and perhaps that is a reasonable enough ambition at present.\n\nAt the bookies (Ladbrokes): 33/1\n\nPrediction: Mid-table.\n\nNORTHAMPTON TOWN\n\nLast season: 22nd in League One (relegated)\n\nP46 W12 D11 L23 F43 A77 Pts47\n\nAverage attendance: 5,830\n\nChairman: Kelvin Thomas, 45 (appointed November 2015)\n\nManager: Dean Austin, 48 (appointed April 2018 as caretaker, May 2018 permanently)\n\nDean Austin’s managerial record:\n\nLeague games only – playoffs and cup games not included.\n\nPlayers out (6):\n\nGoalkeepers (1):\n\nRichard O’Donnell, 29 (Bradford City)\n\nDefenders (3):\n\nBrendan Moloney, 29 (Untraced)\n\nRaheem Hanley, 24 (Untraced)\n\nAaron Phillips, 24 (Untraced)\n\nMidfielders (0):\n\nForwards (2):\n\nKevin Luckassen, 25 (Almere City – Holland)\n\nLeon Lobjoit, 23 (Untraced)\n\nPlayers in (4):\n\nGoalkeepers (1):\n\nLewis Ward, 21 (Reading – season loan)\n\nDefenders (1):\n\nHakeem Odoffin, 20 (Wolverhampton Wanderers)\n\nMidfielders (0):\n\nForwards (2):\n\nAndy Williams, 31 (Doncaster Rovers)\n\nJunior Morias, 23 (Peterborough United)\n\nAverage age of players out: 26\n\nAverage age of players in: 24\n\nNumber of players in squad: 28\n\nOne to watch: Junior Morias, 23 (striker)\n\nSeason ticket sales: 2,750 (11/6/18) 3,210 last season\n\nPre-season:\n\nP5 W5 D0 L0 F12 A0\n\n3/7 Sileby Rangers A 2-0\n\n7/7 St Albans City A 4-0\n\n10/7 Brackley Town A 1-0\n\n24/7 BARNET H 3-0\n\n27/7 MANCHESTER UNITED XI H 2-0\n\nCommentary:\n\nAnd so we welcome one of football’s yo-yo clubs back to League Two. Since the formation of the four-division league format in 1958, Northampton have been promoted from and relegated back to the basement division on no fewer than seven occasions. In the 1960s came that famous run to the First Division and back, perhaps setting the tone for what has happened since. One thing is for certain: Northampton will be looking for their eighth promotion from the fourth tier, and with immediate effect.\n\nPlaced into context against the environment the club has been operating within in recent times, that relegation in May was no surprise. The club was put up for sale in May this year following ongoing disputes with the council regarding the development of the troublesome East Stand. Northampton Borough Council is still trying to recover a £10.25 million loan granted to the club in 2013 for the redevelopment of Sixfields; the money has disappeared, and the council has spent a further £1 million plus in an unsuccessful attempt to locate the money. No one quite knows what the ultimate repercussions may be.\n\nAgainst that background, Northampton also have a relatively new manager to lead them into their campaign in the shape of former Spurs right-back Dean Austin. Austin has very little experience of management, although he is very knowledgeable as a coach. Two of his better players in Brendan Moloney and goalkeeper Richard O’Donnell have moved on, but the retained list contained few surprises. Quite where the goals are going to come from is perhaps the main challenge facing Austin – last season’s top scorer Chris Long, on loan from Burnley, will not be there this time. Andy Williams, with over a hundred Football League goals to his name, has come in from Doncaster, while the speedy Junior Morias from Peterborough looks the pick of the signings.\n\nNorthampton were another side who undertook an underwhelming pre-season schedule. Having played a flurry of games against some minor non-league sides, Northampton allowed themselves just two official games in the final four weeks of pre-season, and one of those was at home to relegated Barnet. In short, Northampton is a relegated club that is up for sale, is embroiled in legal wrangling with the council, and has a new manager. However, they look in a better state than fellow relegated clubs Bury and Oldham in spite of the off-field shenanigans. They could be in for an interesting season at the newly-named PTS Academy Stadium.\n\nAt the bookies (Ladbrokes): 12/1 (joint fifth favourites)\n\nPrediction: Playoffs.\n\nNOTTS COUNTY\n\nLast season: 5th\n\nP46 W21 D14 L11 F71 A48 Pts77\n\nAverage attendance: 8,513\n\nChairman: Alan Hardy, 54 (appointed January 2017)\n\nManager: Kevin Nolan, 36 (appointed January 2017)\n\nKevin Nolan’s managerial record:\n\nLeague games only – playoffs and cup games not included.\n\nPlayers out (13):\n\nGoalkeepers (1):\n\nAdam Collin, 33 (Carlisle United)\n\nDefenders (3):\n\nMike Edwards, 38 (Untraced)\n\nNicky Hunt, 34 (Crewe Alexandra)\n\nCarl Dickinson, 31 (Yeovil Town)\n\nMidfielders (5):\n\nRob Milsom, 31 (Untraced)\n\nMichael O’Connor, 30 (Lincoln City)\n\nLiam Noble, 27 (Hartlepool United)\n\nCurtis Thompson, 24 (Wycombe Wanderers)\n\nElliot Hodge, 22 (On trial at Burton Albion)\n\nForwards (4):\n\nAlan Smith, 37 (Untraced)\n\nShola Ameobi, 36 (Untraced)\n\nJonathan Forte, 32 (Exeter City)\n\nCallum Saunders, 22 (Untraced)\n\nPlayers in (10):\n\nGoalkeepers (0):\n\nDefenders (1):\n\nBen Hall, 21 (Brighton & Hove Albion – season loan)\n\nMidfielders (7):\n\nDavid Vaughan, 35 (Nottingham Forest)\n\nEnzio Boldewijn, 25 (Crawley Town)\n\nAndy Kellett, 24 (Wigan Athletic)\n\nNathan Thomas, 23 (Sheffield United – season loan)\n\nChristian Oxlade-Chamberlain, 20 (Portsmouth)\n\nTom Crawford, 19 (Chester)\n\nWill Patching, 19 (Manchester City)\n\nForwards (2):\n\nKristian Dennis, 28 (Chesterfield)\n\nKane Hemmings, 27 (Oxford United)\n\nAverage age of players out: 31\n\nAverage age of players in: 24\n\nNumber of players in squad: 23\n\nOne to watch: Enzio Boldewijn, 25 (winger)\n\nSeason ticket sales: 3,100\n\nPre-season:\n\nP6 W3 D0 L3 F26 A13\n\n7/7 Rolls Royce Leisure Select XI A 17-0\n\n10/7 Basford United A 3-1\n\n14/7 DERBY COUNTY H 1-4\n\n21/7 LEICESTER CITY H 1-4\n\n28/7 Luton Town A 0-2\n\n28/7 Carlton Town A 4-2\n\nCommentary:\n\nAnd so the club with the fantasy football finances returns with a vengeance. Following owner Alan Hardy’s admission last season that the current wage structure and bonus scale was unsustainable, we might have been forgiven for thinking Notts County were about to cut their cloth this summer. The wage bill was certainly reduced by some significant departures – thirteen players have gone, including presumed high wage-earners Alan Smith, Shola Ameobi and Jonathan Forte.\n\nHowever, it is the arrivals that have drawn a sharp intake of breath from the outside world. The significant signings of Kristian Dennis (transfer fee alleged to be £150,000) and Kane Hemmings on a lucrative three-year deal started the golden ball rolling. Enzio Boldewijn was then signed from Crawley for a substantial six-figure fee (rumoured to be £300,000), which represents the largest investment since County paid £1.5 million for Kaspar Schmeichel in 2009. The total transfer fee for the three players is believed to be around £550,000, and that is without taking into account the wages for the three or the cost of recent Welsh international David Vaughan from across the Trent. With Hardy desperately trying to flog season tickets under a variety of guises and making impassioned appeals for the fans to turn up, one wonders how secure the whole thing is. Again.\n\nThere is no doubt that County have conducted some excellent summer business, whatever the cost, and they appear to have a squad to envy. Further to those headline signings, there has been a huge reduction in the average age of player, suggesting that the legs may last further into the season than they did last time. One criticism of the County side was that they appeared to run out of steam mid-season, and manager Nolan has certainly taken steps to avoid a similar fate this time.\n\nFrom a Lincoln City perspective, we should also mention that Hardy is relaunching the ladies’ team this season under the new name Notts County Women. That is a bit strange, as Hardy closed the Notts County Ladies club down last summer on the basis that to continue would be ‘little short of financial suicide’. At that time, they could not cover the £1 million needed to cover debts, a £350,000 tax bill and the £500,000 per year running costs of the club. Hardy also stated the projected revenue from sponsorship and attendances was only £28,000, so what makes him think it is suddenly more viable 12 months later? Hardy says they will start further down the women’s pyramid and play home games at the ground of financial disaster area Ilkeston Town, which Hardy also owns. Not much of this makes sense. In fact, none of it does.\n\nConsidering the astounding amount of money spent this summer, anything less than promotion next May will represent catastrophic failure. Watch this space.\n\nAt the bookies (Ladbrokes): 11/2 (favourites)"
