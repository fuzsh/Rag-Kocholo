        "text": "It’s known as ‘the beautiful game’ for a reason. In the world of football, where passion and camaraderie converge, stadiums serve as the majestic arenas where dreams are made, legends are born, and history is written. From the roar of the crowd to the excitement of penalty shootouts, stadiums aren’t just a place to watch this incredible sport: they’re also a place for communities to gather. But which are the best stadiums in the world? In a bid to determine this question, Ticketgum crunched the numbers, gathering data on over 140 football stadiums from across the globe: from East to West. We then created the stadium index — a score out of 100 generated through several factors which come into play when determining which football stadiums are the best in the world:\n\nThe stadium's seating capacity\n\nThe average number of goals scored\n\nThe average monthly attendance\n\nGoogle reviews\n\nGlobal search volume of each stadium\n\nThe amount of attention they get on social media (TikTok and Instagram)\n\nSo, buckle up as Ticketgum determines, once and for all, which is the best football stadium in the world.\n\nHow Do Stadiums Rank Across The World?\n\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty details of the data, it’s important to take a look at how each region compares in terms of its stadiums. While each continent faces its own unique political and social challenges, football is a sport that brings the world together. Surprisingly, North America rams as the top region in the world when referring to the average stadium index, at 55.99, narrowly followed by Europe, at 54.30 on average. Africa ranks as the lowest region in the world, at just 30.21.\n\nTop 10 Best Stadiums in the World\n\nSo, which stadium comes out on top? Here are the top 10 best stadiums in the world according to Ticketgum’s stadium index score.\n\n1. Mineirão, Brazil\n\nBrazil is undeniably one of the biggest football nations on the planet, so it’s no surprise that Mineirão, the home ground of football team Cruzeiro, is the top-ranked stadium in the world. With a seating capacity of just 61,846, this arena is far from being the biggest stadium in the world. However, with a high Google rating of 4.7, as well as an average of 4 goals per game, a game played in Mineirão is guaranteed to be anything but boring. You may remember this stadium from the iconic 2014 FIFA World Cup, where Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1 in a semi-final humiliation, going five goals ahead in the first half hour — now dubbed as The Mineirazo (The Mineirão Smash).\n\n2. Celtic Park, Scotland\n\nCeltic Park in Glasgow, Scotland, brings it home for the “Bhoys In Green”, ranking second place as the best football stadium in the world. With a seating capacity of 61,927, a similar size to Brazil’s Mineirão, this stadium is the home of the Celtic football team. Celtic Park also has the same average goals scored per game, 4, as Mineirão, as well as the same Google ranking, 4.7.\n\n3. Wembley Stadium, England\n\nSituated in London, England, the famous Wembley Stadium serves as the home ground for the England national team. It also has the largest seating capacity among the top 10 stadiums with 90,000 seats, a whopping 37% more seats than Mineirão, making it one of the biggest football stadiums in the world. Of course, Wembley hosted the iconic 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, where the Three Lions took home their only-ever World Cup trophy after a remarkable win against West Germany.\n\n4. MetLife Stadium, USA\n\nThe MetLife Stadium, located in New Jersey, USA, ranks fourth on the list of the best football stadiums overall. As another mammoth stadium on the list, the MetLife Stadium hosts 82,500, only 7,500 less than Wembley, and has a Google rating of 4.5. Similar to the top-ranked stadiums on the list, matches at MetLife Stadium have an average of 4 goals per game, clocking a final stadium index score of 79.03.\n\n5. Estadio Olímpico Universitario, Mexico\n\nMexico’s Estadio Olímpico Universitario ranks fifth on the list of the best football stadiums in the world and is the home stadium of UNAM Pumas. This huge stadium can accommodate 68,954 spectators and, surprisingly, has a higher Google rating than Metlife Stadium, at 4.7. Matches here also average 4 goals per game, but its low social media engagement, at 24143 Instagram hashtags — almost ten times lower than Metlife Stadiums' number of hashtags, at 282,913 - gives this arena a final stadium index score of 78.05.\n\n6. Estadio Azteca, Mexico\n\nAnother stadium flying the flag for Mexico is Estadio Azteca, home to Club América, Cruz Azul, and the Mexico national team. However, this 87,523-capacity stadium falls short when looking at the reviews with a Google rating of 4.5. With a respectable average of 3 goals per match, Estadio Azteca still holds up strong on the list overall.\n\n7. Old Trafford, England\n\nThe Reds go marching on into seventh place, as Old Trafford, in Manchester, England, lands itself in the top ten. Home to Manchester United, this stadium is one of the most famous and iconic in the world. At 76,000 capacity, this stadium isn’t the biggest stadium in the world but still packs a punch with a Google rating score of 4.6 and an average of 3 goals per game. One set of fans disappointed to miss out on the list will be Liverpool vs Man Utd's most historic rivals who boast a famous stadium of their own. For more insight into visiting Liverpool's iconic ground, check out our comprehensive Anfield stadium guide.\n\n8. Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium, Indonesia\n\nTaking the crown for the best football stadium in Asia, and eighth in the world, is Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia — home to the Indonesia national football team. Surprisingly, this 77,193-capacity stadium, similar in size to Old Trafford, has one of the highest Google ratings on the list, at 4.8. However, its weak attendance-to-capacity ratio (51.38%), as well as its incredibly low Instagram engagement (9,536 hashtags) — around 130 times lower than the number of hashtags made for Old Trafford, 1,380,573 — gives other stadiums on the list an edge.\n\n9. Santiago Bernabéu, Spain\n\nAlthough Real Madrid may be one of the most iconic football teams in the world, its home stadium Santiago Bernabéu ranks just ninth overall. Despite lacking in social media engagement compared to other European stadiums, this huge arena can accommodate 81,044 spectators and has an impressive 74.13% attendance-to-capacity ratio — the second highest ratio out of all top ten stadiums, with only Wembley at 77.26% above it.\n\n10. Gillette Stadium, USA\n\nLast, but certainly not least, on the list of the best football stadiums in the world is Gillette Stadium, located in Massachusetts, USA. The home ground of MLS side New England Revolution, this stadium has a seating capacity of 68,756 and a Google rating of 4.6. As the second stadium in North America to take the top ten, the Gillette Stadium is let down by its weak attendance-to-capacity ratio of just 46.02% — the lowest out of all top ten stadiums in the world.\n\nTop 10 Worst Stadiums in the World\n\nWhile stadiums are a remarkable feat of human engineering, not every arena across the globe scored well in our study. Here are the top 10 worst stadiums in the world according to Ticketgum’s stadium index score.\n\n1. Al-Shaab Stadium, Iraq\n\nAl-Shaab Stadium in Baghdad, Iraq, home to Al-Shorta SC and with a seating capacity of 40,000, ranks as the worst football stadium in the world. Sadly, you’re unlikely to witness an exciting game of football in these walls, with the stadium having just a single goal per game on average — making it one of only four on the list that has an average goal-per-game score of under 2. The stadium also has a weak Google rating of 4.0, as well as incredibly low social media engagement: just 38 Instagram hashtags and 743 TikTok views.\n\n2. Levy Mwanawasa Stadium, Zambia\n\nAs the second African stadium on the list, the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium in Zambia, home to ZESCO United and the Zambian national team, comes in third place as the worst stadium in the world. The stadium has a seating capacity of 40,800, a Google rating of 4.1, an average of 2 goals per match, and a final stadium index score of 11.92 which is still leagues ahead of Al-Shaab Stadium which ranks just at just 3.42.\n\n3. Nagai Stadium, Japan\n\nNagai Stadium located in Osaka, Japan and home of Cerezo Osaka, ranks third among the worst stadiums in the world. This stadium is respectable in size and accommodates 47,816 spectators. However, its incredibly weak Google rating score of 4.0 and an average of one goal per game — the same as Al-Shaab — lands this stadium as one of the worst in the world.\n\n4. Kashima Soccer Stadium, Japan\n\nAnother Japanese stadium, Kashima Soccer Stadium in Kashima takes the fourth spot of worst stadiums in the world. With a seating capacity of 40,728 and home to the Kashima Antlers, this stadium has a Google rating of 4.3. However, the incredibly low amount of TikTok attention this stadium receives, at just 250 views lands this stadium fourth.\n\n5. Peter Mokaba Stadium, South Africa\n\nPeter Mokaba Stadium in Limpopo, South Africa, hosting the clubs Baroka and Polokwane City, is the fifth-worst stadium in the world according to our findings. It can hold 41,733 spectators and has a Google rating of 4.2, as well as a monthly search volume of 1400. However, like many on the list, a low social media engagement drags this stadium down to the fifth worst in the world.\n\n6. Hang Jebat Stadium, Malaysia\n\nHang Jebat Stadium in Krubong, Malaysia, one of Melaka FC’s home grounds, is ranked sixth on the list of the worst stadiums in the world. As one of the smallest stadiums on the list, this 40,000-capacity has a Google rating of 4.1. Despite having a monthly search volume of 400 - 3.5 times less than the Peter Mokaba Stadium — the number of TikTok views this stadium receives, at 2,600,742, gives it the edge.\n\n7. Adrar Stadium, Morocco\n\nDespite causing an uproar as the beloved underdog of the FIFA World Cup 2022, Adrar Stadium in Morocco, which hosts the national football team and Hassania Agadir, ranks as the seventh-worst stadium in the world. With a seating capacity of 45,480, it received a higher Google ranking than others on the list, at 4.4. However, its lack of social media engagement with just 140 hashtags, weighs this stadium down.\n\n8. March 28 Stadium, Libya\n\nLocated in Benghazi, Libya, the March 28 Stadium ranks as one of the worst stadiums in the world. As the home turf of the Libya national football team, this arena can accommodate 40,000 spectators and has a Google rating of 3.8. However, with just 9 Instagram hashtags, the lowest number of all stadiums we surveyed, the stadium stands as the eighth worst in the world.\n\n9. Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field, USA\n\nAs the worst stadium in North America, Rentschler Field, situated in East Hartford, USA, comes in as the ninth worst stadium in the world. With a seating capacity of 40,000, the stadium had a Google rating of 4.4 and an average of 2 goals per match. Despite being the worst in the continent, the stadium ranks a 4,300 search volume — making it the most searched stadium on the list.\n\n10. Stade Mohamed V, Morocco\n\nStade Mohammed V, in Casablanca, Morocco ranks as the tenth worst stadium in the world. Although the arena can host a respectable 45,000 attendees, the average Google rating for this venue is 4.2, with the average number of goals clocking in at 2 per game.\n\nWhich is the Best Stadium in Europe?\n\nCeltic Park, Scotland\n\nIf you think Camp Nou or Wembley takes the trophy as the best stadium in Europe, think again. Celtic Park ranks as the top stadium in Europe. Despite having 4 times fewer Instagram hashtags than Wembley, at 75,872, and almost 10 times fewer TikTok views, at 45,400,000 — it’s Celtic Parks’ Google reviews which really give the stadium the edge. At 4.7, Celtic Park is a blatant fan favourite ranking above other major stadiums and only topped by Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium which lands a 4.8 on Google reviews. With an average of 4 goals per match, the same as Mineirão in Brazil and one above Wembley, you’re guaranteed an exciting match too. Celtic Park’s impressive score makes it the best football stadium in Europe and one of the best football stadiums in the world.\n\nWhat is the Best Stadium in North America?\n\nMetlife Stadium, USA\n\nMetLife Stadium, located in the USA, takes the crown as the best stadium in North America, with a seating capacity of 82,500. Although the USA may be better known for American Football, the stadium isn’t one to miss. Boasting a remarkable Google rating of 4.5, and an average of 4 goals per match, a game at the Metlife is guaranteed to not disappoint. But it’s the amount of attention this stadium gets online, particularly on how much it’s searched, which brings home the win for Metlife. The stadium clocks a whopping monthly global search volume of 178,000, over 8 times higher than the second-best stadium in North America, Estadio Olímpico Universitario in Mexico City, which has a monthly search volume of 20,000.\n\nWhat is the Best Stadium in South America?\n\nMineirão, Brazil\n\nMineirão, located in Brazil, stands as the best stadium in South America. Home to the renowned Cruzeiro football club, the stadium offers a seating capacity of 61,846, providing an impressive stage for thrilling matches. With a stellar Google rating of 4.7, Mineirão has garnered significant acclaim for its facilities and overall fan experience. It’s known for having exciting matches too, with an average of 4 goals per match — one of the highest in the world — giving the stadium a final index score of 83.40. It’s when compared to other stadiums in South America where this stadium really shines though, ranking leagues ahead of South America’s second-best stadium, Maracanã Stadium in Brazil, which has a stadium index almost 20 points lower than Mineirão, at 65.45.\n\nWhere is the Best Stadium in Africa?\n\nKings Park Stadium, South Africa\n\nAlthough Africa has its fair share of the worst stadiums in the world, it also has impressive stadiums too. According to the numbers, Kings Park Stadium in South Africa ranks as the best stadium in Africa. Serving as the home ground for Lamontville Golden Arrows F.C., this stadium offers a seating capacity of 52,000, providing an impressive stage for football matches. With a final stadium index score of 46.91, Kings Park Stadium lands only a fraction ahead of the second-best stadium in Africa, Cairo International Stadium, which has a final stadium index score of 45.76.\n\nWhich is the Best Stadium in Asia?\n\nGelora Bung Karno Main Stadium, Indonesia\n\nGelora Bung Karno Main Stadium in Indonesia, the home ground for the Indonesia national football team, takes the title of the best stadium in Asia. With impressive scores across the board, resulting in a final stadium index score of 72.52, this stadium ranks leagues ahead of the second-best stadium in Asia, Bukit Jalil National Stadium, in Malaysia, which clocks a final stadium index score of 67.39. But it’s the Google reviews which really make Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium a standout venue. As the highest-rated stadium in the world on Google, scoring 4.8, this Indonesian arena is clearly a favourite among football fans worldwide and is one of the best in the world.\n\nBest Performing Football Stadiums on Social Media\n\nIt’s also important to consider how these football stadiums perform online too. In the ever-evolving landscape of social media, football stadiums have emerged as captivating hubs of online engagement. Whether it’s capturing the heart-wrenching near misses or the final moments of penalty shootouts, the amount of engagement stadiums have on social media offers a window into this exciting sport - and, most importantly, indicates how engaged fans are at the stadium. So which football stadiums perform the best on social media?\n\nMost Engaged With Stadium On Instagram: Camp Nou, Spain\n\nCamp Nou in Spain proudly takes the crown as one of social media’s most engaged with football stadiums, based on the number of Instagram hashtags it has garnered. With an astounding 2,359,109 hashtags, this iconic stadium, home to Barcelona Football Club, has captured the hearts and attention of fans worldwide. Its popularity on social media platforms reflects the deep admiration and global reach of the club, as well as the awe-inspiring atmosphere and memorable experiences that Camp Nou offers. As fans flock to share their moments and memories from this legendary stadium, it solidifies its position as the ultimate destination for football fans, affirming its status as the best stadium in the world.\n\nMost Engaged With Stadium On TikTok: Estadio Azteca, Mexico\n\nEstadio Azteca in Mexico claims the title of the most viewed stadium on TikTok, based on the impressive number of TikTok views it has garnered. With a staggering 838,600,000 views, this iconic stadium, home to Club América, Cruz Azul, and the Mexico national football team, has captured the attention and imagination of TikTok users worldwide. Its popularity on the platform illustrates the enthusiasm and fascination surrounding the stadium, as well as the captivating football moments it provides.\n\nMethodology:\n\nTicketgum was interested to reveal which international football stadium is the best in the world.\n\nThey gathered a seed list of all stadiums that are the home of a club or national team which have hosted international matches and have a capacity of 40,000 or more. That is the minimum capacity required for a stadium to host FIFA World Cup finals matches.\n\nNational football stadium attendance/goal data was obtained from 11v11.com for each team and stadium. This data was averaged across all games.\n\nSome stadiums have an average attendance that exceeds capacity, this is because some stadiums have reduced their capacity over the years e.g. Estádio do Morumbi.\n\nOnly stadiums with more than 3 attendance data figures were kept to maintain a good sample size.\n\nNext, Google Maps API was used to obtain average review scores for all the stadiums.\n\nOnly stadiums with at least 1,000 reviews were kept.\n\nSocial media data on Instagram hashtag searches was included for each stadium, using a variety of versions of each stadium’s name. The number of TikTok views for several variations of each stadium’s name was also added to the data. Finally, global monthly search volumes for each stadium were collected using Ahrefs Keywords Explorer.\n\nThe factors which contributed to the final ranking for each stadium are: seating capacity, reviews, the average number of goals per match, Instagram hashtags, TikTok views, and monthly global search volumes. The last three factors were given a lower weighting in contributing to the final rankings.\n\nOnly stadiums which have hosted international matches were included in the dataset.\n\nStadiums that are inactive or abandoned were excluded.\n\nNote: Due to limited data available, stadiums from Oceania were excluded from this study.\n\nBlog categories\n\nAlso on Ticket Gum\n\nIn-Depth Review of the Tottenham vs Man United Match Experience\n\nIn the latest Tottenham vs Man United match, we dive into the game highlights, key moments, and fan experiences.
