        "text": "Notts County\n\nThe Magpies find themselves playing National League Football having been relegated from Sky Bet League Two last season.\n\nDuring their time in the Football League, Notts County were proudly the world’s oldest Football League Club prior to their relegation, and they will be keen to re-assert that status with a promotion winning season this time out.\n\nNeal Ardley’s side are front-runners to gain promotion next year alongside Chesterfield, and with a number of dangerous players still on their books, they will certainly prove a tough test for The Bees this term.\n\nOne to watch – Enzio Boldewijn\n\nCounty signed Enzio from Crawley Town, but the winger’s career began in the Netherlands with SC Voorland before joining Utrecht.\n\nFollowing a loan spell away from Utrecht, Boldewijn joined Almere City where he would make over 90 appearances.\n\nHis switch to England came in 2016 when he joined Crawley Town, and he quickly found his feet with an impressive first year with the Red Devils. The Dutchman went onto score 15 goals during his spell with Crawley before joining Notts County in 2018.\n\nBoldewijn joined the Magpies for a six-figure sum and he currently has five goals to his name in with County.\n\nYeovil Town\n\nThe Glovers were also relegated last time out after they finished rock bottom of Sky Bet League Two.\n\nTheir relegation ended a 16-year stint in the Football League which dated back to 2003. Four points adrift with one game to play, The Glovers fate was sealed prior to the final game of the season.\n\nThe National League new-boys play at Huish Park, a 142-mile trip from The Hive London. Barnet and Yeovil boast an equal league record against each other, sharing three wins at peace.\n\nOne to watch – Matt Worthington\n\nA product of the AFC Bournemouth Academy, Worthington signed a new long-term deal with the Glovers in January 2019.\n\nDuring his time with the Cherries, Worthington enjoyed a number of loan spells away from the club at the likes of Eastbourne Borough, Yeovil and Forest Green Rovers.\n\nDue to his loan spell with Yeovil being the most fruitful, Worthington signed a contract to stay in Somerset in January of this year.\n\nA box-to-box midfielder at just 21 years of age, he will be certainly one to keep an eye on this year.\n\nStockport County\n\nThe Hatters gained promotion to the National League after being crowned champions of the National League North. They finished in top spot, just one point better off than second-placed Chorley.\n\nPlaying their football at Edgeley Park, the Bees will face a good 180-mile trip up to the South of Manchester to face Jim Gannon’s side.\n\nThe Northern outfit comes out on top when looking at the head-to-head league records, just edging four wins over Barnet’s three, however, Darren Currie’s side will be sure to put that right this season.\n\nOne to watch – Frank Mulhern\n\nThe Irishman has played for a host of clubs across non-league. Starting out in the Conference Premier with Southport, Mulhern only went on to make one appearance for the Sandgrounders before leaving for Guiseley.\n\nSpells at Harrogate Town, Alfreton Town and Bradford AFC followed before he eventually signed for Stockport last season.\n\nMulhern was pivotal in Stockport’s success in the National League North and could play a vital role for the Hatters this upcoming season.\n\nChorley FC\n\nHaving finished in second place in the National League North last season, Chorley had to go through the Play-Offs to gain promotion and in-hand came up trumps following a penalty shoot-out with Spennymoor Town.\n\nAs the Play-Off final finished 1-1, the tie was forced to penalties and the Magpies overcame Spennymoor 4-3 to earn their right to play in the National League next season.\n\nChorley play their football at Victory Park, a ground named after the outcome of World War One. 200 plus miles from The Hive, the Bees face another long distance away day.\n\nOne to watch – Marcus Carver\n\nThe 25-year-old forward missed just one game last season and racked up an impressive 17 goals in all competitions.\n\nCarver’s footballing career began with Accrington Stanley, though he enjoyed a number of loan spells away from the club during his five-year stay. Halifax Town, Barrow, AFC Fylde and Chorley all took the forward on loan and following a successful loan period with the latter, Carver signed permanently in 2016.\n\nHaving been credited with ‘energy to burn’, Carver will be one to watch as we go head-to-head with the Magpies.\n\nTorquay United\n\nTorquay rather ran away with the National League South having finished a comprehensive 10 points above second-placed Woking.\n\nThe Gulls won 27 of their 42 games last season, losing just eight and will be looking to have a positive season in the top flight of non-league football.\n\nPlaying their games at Plainmoor, Barnet face a 200-mile journey to the South-West to face the Gulls.\n\nIn terms of head-to-head record, Barnet just edges Torquay having won 11 games compared to their 10.\n\nOne to watch – Jamie Reid\n\nReid’s career began in 2012 when he represented Exeter City, but in search of first-team football, the forward was loaned out on several occasions.\n\nFirst to Dorchester Town, Reid scored three goals in 12 games before securing a loan spell with Torquay. Proving a success, the forward enjoyed two more loan moves to the Gulls and is now contracted with the South-West club.\n\nA local lad, the pacey forward has become a fan’s favourite and will certainly prove a threat in the upcoming season.\n\nWoking FC\n\nLast on the list of new opponents for this season are Woking, who secured their place in the National League after coming through the Play-Offs in the National League South.\n\nThe Cardinals finished in second place last season on 78 points before beating Welling United 1-0 in the Play-Off final courtesy of an Armani Little free-kick.\n\nWoking play their games at the Laithwaite Community Stadium, under 50 miles from The Hive.\n\nThe last time these two sides met, Barnet came out 2-1 winners courtesy of goals from John Akinde and Joey Jones\n\nOne to watch – Paul Hodges\n\nHodges’ performances last season earned him a contract extension which he signed this Summer and he will be looking to be just as important to his team this time out.\n\nHe made 46 appearances in all competitions last season, scoring seven goals and was often called upon as an impactful substitute.\n\nHis willingness to run in behind and create chances has made him extremely popular amongst the Woking fans and they will be delighted to have him on board for the upcoming season."
