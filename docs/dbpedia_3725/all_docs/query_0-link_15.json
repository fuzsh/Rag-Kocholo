        "text": "PARAMARIBO, Suriname (CMC):\n\nDraft legislation has been introduced into Suriname's parliament, designed to help the country qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.\n\nThe dual nationality legislation aims to change the law to facilitate players born in Suriname who play professional football overseas, but cannot represent their country.\n\nThe initiative is part of a project dubbed 'Suriname en route to 2018' and already 25 players have been announced, who, if the dual nationality legislation gets passed, would be eligible to play for the national team.\n\n\"If the dual nationality law does get approved, we are playing in the World Championships in Russia in 2018,\" declared John Krishnadath, chairman of Suriname's Football Association (SVB).\n\n\"We will own one of the four spots of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF).\"\n\nFootball talent from Suriname has featured prominently in international football with the likes of Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Patrick Kluivert, Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit, an elite quintet that helped the Netherlands claim 12 European Cups among the names.\n\nSuriname, however, have never qualified for a World Cup with its best effort being a berth in the final group stage of qualifying for the 1978 tournament.\n\nThere are more than 100 Surinamese players in the Dutch professional leagues, but none of their overseas professionals are eligible to represent their country.\n\nSuriname's footballers cannot play for the national team once they assume a different nationality.\n\nI've heard somewhere in january or february this new year.It is on the agenda of the National Assembly and opposition and coalition are positive about this bill,but they still need to agree with each other about the content of that bill.\n\nSVB chairman John Krishnadath Has indicated that politicians must act quickly,he will then be able to schedule official friendlies.So i hope that those politicians will listen to his urgent call.There is no time to lose,i've noticed that the qualifying battle for WC2018 begins in june or july?Actually, time too short, now everything must be done hastily,i seriously ask myself if the SVB can put together a good team in such a short time.Actually, this can be blamed on politics,they are very late to put this bill finally on the agenda.\n\nYeah..that's right.But maybe those politicians had different things on their mind and i think dual citizenship was a case that had no priority for them.But now it has been given the highest priority.\n\nWhat Louis Giskus concerns,he is no longer chairman of the SVB.Thank god he was not elected again,so now it's John Krishnadath and he is very serious to build something solid.He has also put pressure on those politicians by giving them the proposal and everyone has received a copy.So there is no way back.Those political leaders can't deny this for ever,the Surinamese people demand it from the government.That was clearly demonstrated by a full Andre Kamperveen stadium with thousands and thousands of people who saw Natio/Suriprofs vs WConnection.And that after a period for more than 40 years ago.So those politicians are convinced by the fact that something has to be done,they are very seriously busy to deal with this matter.\n\nIf so,it would be my preference to play a friendly against Chili or Belgium.But i don't know if this is true,it's not official (yet).We'd better wait until the SVB comes with an official message.It can be incorrect.\n\nHere is a list of Surinamese players in Dutch and other European Leagues.I've updated the list from Natio com.\n\nSuriprofs Attackers/Strikers\n\n1st Division Eredivisie\n\n- Jarchinio

in American leagues but that would take too much time to find them.Players in red are not eligible to play for the Surinamese NT.\n\nUnfortunately, the dual nationality will not be introduced by the Surinamese government.Apparently they want to wait until after the political elections.And then it will be too late to use players from abroad.Sorry guys, we had hoped that the Surinamese politics would cooperate, but it is delayed.So the SVB has no choice to work with local amateur players again.And because of this,it's not realistic anymore for Suriname to have a chance to reach the WC in Russia.\n\nThe only positive news i have is that Dean Roberto Gorre will be the new coach.Dean was a youth coach of the Scottish Football Association.Furthermore he has played in numerous Dutch professional clubs.Dean says that he will do his best,but he knows he can not accomplish much with the local players.\n\nSeems like the effort should really be on improving the domestic league anyway. A&B managed to turn things around by creating one club that played in the American 3rd division last cycle. It doesn't take much to become more competitive in this region\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with those politicians?Now i ask myself,do they realy ike football or not?Christ jesus i'm getting tired of this.The SVB had great plans and look what they are doing again.Seems like nothing is going to happen,it's very frustrating for those players who want to play for Suriname.When will the government ever realize that this is enough???When I'm dead and burried????\n\nWell,the Surinamese FA has also plans to invest in the local leagues.They want a similar professional system like Trinidad & Tabago,so it means that they want to professionalize atleast 8 clubs from what i've heard last month ago.So we hope to hear more about this in the future.The Surinamese FA wants to get rid of the old amateur system\n\nThanks for ur comment.Those Surinamese politicians still don't realize how important it is to bring football on a higher level in the country.They have much to learn about the importance of sport, especially for the youth and how it can bring economic benefits.Seems like they are afraid for something and we don't know what it is and why.\n\nI agree that the process to allow players with Surinamese roots to play for the National Team is long overdue. I think Suriname has the potential to be a stalwart among CFU squads once incorporation is approved. Even if such a law were approved a few months ago, I think Suriname challenging for a 2018 World Cup berth is overly optimistic. Qualifying in 2022 may even be a stretch. If Suriname consistently challenges for a spot in the Gold Cup in 2017, 2019, and 2021, then we can honestly say their full potential is starting to be realized. It's much easier for a CFU side to to compete for 4 spots in the Gold Cup than it is for them to become one of only 3 or 4 CONCACAF teams to make the World Cup."
