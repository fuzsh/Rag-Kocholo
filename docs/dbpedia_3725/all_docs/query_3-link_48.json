        "text": "Generally Eindhoven is known for two things  the football club PSV and the electrical giant Philips. The guided bus from Eindhoven Airport to the city centre passes the Philips Stadium, home of PSV, which is regarded as a tourist attraction. Thats not surprising as, with all due respect, there are not too many attractions to see in the city.\n\nI had a look round the new PSV super store they have opened under one of the stands at the Philips stadium. Previously you could pick up the last programme from the previous home game free of charge in the club shop. Theres no place for this in the new store, although, they have kept another shop open at the back of the ground. I was able to pick up one of their unique mini programmes from their game the previous day against Sampdoria in the Europa League.\n\nIt must be hard being a second team in a city but FC Eindhoven are anonymous to say the least. The club has no presence at all in the city centre except for a couple of childrens club shirts I saw in a sports shop. Even the tourist information shop does not sell FC souvenirs anymore. It wasnt always this way. The club was founded on November 16, 1909 as EVV Eindhoven. In 1954, Eindhoven were the last Dutch league champions before the introduction of the professional league. After turning professional in 1954, the club played in the Eredivisie (1st division) until 1957, when they were relegated to the Eerste Divisie (2nd Division). In 1969 they were even relegated to the Tweede Divisie (3rd Division). Two years later, the club secured promotion back to the Eerste Divisie, and in 1975 they were promoted back to the Eredivisie. In 1977, FC was relegated back to the Eerste Divisie, where they have remained ever since.\n\nFC Eindhoven's biggest rivalry is with neighbours PSV Eindhoven, against whom they contest the Lichtstad Derby ('City of Light Derby'). Like football rivalries in some other cities, such as Glasgow, the rivalry between Eindhoven and PSV has its origins in religion. Having always been a Roman Catholic stronghold, FC Eindhoven used to be a bigger club than PSV in the period between 1930 and 1955. PSV on the other hand, were of a more Protestant background, being connected with the Philips company.\n\nIn 2004, FC Eindhoven started a co-operation deal with neighbours PSV Eindhoven, meaning the possibility of swapping youth players between the two clubs; that co-operation ended in 2005. In the 2009-2010 season FC Eindhoven qualified for playoffs to advance to the Eredivisie. They advanced past the first round defeating AGOVV Apeldoorn 4-2 goal aggregate. They were then pitted against possible relegation from Eredivisie club Willem II and we're narrowly defeated 3-2 aggregate. So they remained in the Eerste Divisie for the 2010 -2011 season. The club also had a crisis a couple of seasons ago when the Dutch Football Authorities were going to expel the club from professional football due the financial situation at the club. This led to a campaign to raise money through various sources so that the club received a professional license and was able to celebrate its centenary season.\n\nMy hotel, the Crown Inn, is located on the Markt Square and it is an ideal location for the centre of the city and the bus and railway stations which are next to each other. Public transport is extremely well organised although a new swipe card system has been introduced on the buses which completely baffled me. Luckily you can still pay in cash. Eindhoven is a great location to ground hop. You have PSV and Eindhoven in the city itself with Helmond Sports, Fortuna Sittard, FC Oss and Den Bosch a short train journey away.\n\nThe FC Eindhoven website didnt advise on using public transport to reach their Jan Louwers Stadion. Luckily the staff, after a bit of web searching, in the tourist information office was able to provide me with walking directions and the appropriate bus. A 171 or 172 bus takes you to the sports complex where the stadium is located. The complex has a council sports facility feel about it. I got on the bus at the main railway station for the journey that lasted about 20 minutes. One problem with the 2nd division stadiums in the Netherlands is that the majority of them were upgraded to all seating in the late 1990s. Some clubs must have used the same architects as a lot of stands are identical. As the Jan Louwers stadium was built in the 1950s I was hoping for something slightly different. The ground is basically three sided. The main stand has been extended over the years by adding two pagoda style extensions. Two basics stands complete the stadium with flat hard standing behind one goal completing the fourth side. Only one turnstile block was open for home supporters on the corner of the ground. Programmes were sometimes dispensed by youth players or supporters club members and they ran out about 20 minutes before kick off. A programme is better than no programme but the issue was extremely poor. It was given away free but consisted of a A4 sheet of glossy paper folded into 6 pages.\n\nI always feel a programme reflects a club and it may just be an image problem that is not attracting the paying public to south Eindhoven for their football fix. I arrived one hour before kick off and the place was deserted. I actually thought the game had been cancelled. After entering the ground a trestle table was used to sell replica shirts and scarves. No other souvenirs were on sale. I went for a beer in the club bar, that was quite empty, to be met by the wonderful sisters grim serving behind the bar. I made the disastrous mistake of not buying my tokens (or munters as they are known) before ordering my drink. Grim sister one had a face like a smacked backside that could only have been acquired by drinking 10 pints of fizzy Jupiler a day. Eventually munters in hand I was allowed my drink. The bar is bland except for an excellent tile mural which features an extremely old team picture in blue and white tiles.\n\nThe game itself was quite good. Second in the table FC took on Almere City who was known last season as FC Omniworld. They have changed their purple kit to a Rugby League style black shirt with red v. If ever a side was suited to our own Blue Square Bet North league it has to be Almere. Equipped with two enormous centre halves, a giant centre forward and the wonderfully named hatchet man Touvarno Pinas they would fit in nicely. Star man for FC Eindhoven is Ratko Vonsimpson. Strange name but he looked very dangerous every time he received the ball. This led to his two goals in the first half. A name to remember you may think but in the second half he was rubbish. With the second half ticking away a poor Almere decided that the new Dutch tactic of total hacking instead of total football was the order of the day. FC saw out a comfortable win to remain in second place in the league."
