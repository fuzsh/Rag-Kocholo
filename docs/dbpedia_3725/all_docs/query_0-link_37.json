        "text": "The Football season gets underway this weekend and as usual, the hopes and expectations of fans across the country will be high with dreams of a successful season.\n\nSunderland will be fancied to make an immediate return to the Championship following their shock relegation last season, while West Bromwich Albion, Stoke City and Swansea will be fancied to do well and make an assault on an immediate return to the Premier League.\n\nTranmere Rovers make their Football League return after winning promotion from the National League and so too are Macclesfield, who finished last year as Conference champions.\n\nSo with no further ado, here is your complete guise to all the movers and shakers in this season's EFL.\n\nAston Villa\n\nManager: Steve Bruce\n\nPosition last season: 4th\n\nNickname: Villans\n\nGround: Villa Park\n\nCapacity: 42,660\n\nPlayers in: Andre Moreira (Atletico Madrid, loan)\n\nPlayers out: John Terry, Christopher Samba, Gabriel Agbonlahor (all released), Pierluigi Gollini (Atalanta, undisclosed)\n\nKey man: Conor Hourihane\n\nChances: Last season’s play-off final defeat sent Villa into a spiral after the extent of their financial woes was laid bare. They needed to go up and failed, leaving owner Tony Xia scrambling to pay the bills. However, they have since seen investment from billionaire duo Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens, meaning key players such as Jack Grealish may not have to be sold. Manager Steve Bruce knows what it takes to win promotion, and with the club’s off-field troubles seemingly behind them it could be a better season than expected.\n\nBirmingham City\n\nManager: Garry Monk\n\nPosition last season: 19th\n\nNickname: Blues\n\nGround: St Andrew’s\n\nCapacity: 30,016\n\nPlayers in: Kristian Pedersen (Union Berlin, undisclosed)\n\nPlayers out: Paul Robinson (retired), Jason Lowe (Bolton, free), Andrew Shinnie (Luton, free), Robert Tesche (Bochum, free), Cheick Keita (KAS Eupen, loan)\n\nKey man: David Davis\n\nChances: Blues will be hoping for more success following their brush with relegation, which saw them finish 19th for the second successive season. Manager Garry Monk was the club’s fifth boss in less than 18 months when appointed as Steve Cotterill’s replacement in March, but won five of his last nine league games and believes he will get the chance to shape a better future at St Andrew’s. He has been hampered by a transfer embargo this summer, however, and doubts remain about the club’s ownership structure.\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nManager: Tony Mowbray\n\nPosition last season: 2nd in League One\n\nNickname: Rovers\n\nGround: Ewood Park\n\nCapacity: 31,367\n\nPlayers in: Joe Rothwell (Oxford, undisclosed), Jacob Davenport (Man City, undisclosed), Kasey Palmer (Chelsea, loan)\n\nPlayers out: Liam Feeney, Elliott Ward, Aaron Dillon (all released), Scott Wharton (Lincoln, loan)\n\nKey man: Bradley Dack\n\nChances: Blackburn instantly bounced back to the Championship and manager Tony Mowbray has created a positive atmosphere around Ewood Park that has not been seen for years. Mowbray is a shrewd operator and momentum should keep his side out of relegation trouble, but much will depend on how key midfielder Bradley Dack fares in the second tier. Dack, voted League One player of the year last season, has never played at this level before.\n\nBolton Wanderers\n\nManager: Phil Parkinson\n\nPosition last season: 21st\n\nNickname: The Trotters\n\nGround: Macron Stadium\n\nCapacity: 28,723\n\nPlayers in: Jason Lowe (Birmingham, free), Erhun Oztumer (Walsall, free), Clayton Donaldson (Sheffield United, free), Pawel Olkowski (Cologne, free), Yanic Wildschut (Norwich, loan), Marc Wilson (Sunderland, free), Josh Magennis (Charlton, undisclosed), Jack Hobbs (Nottingham Forest, free), Luke Murphy (Leeds, free)\n\nPlayers out: Derik Osede, Dorian Dervite, Jem Karacan, Jan Kirchhoff, Chinedu Obasi (all released), Ben Amos (Millwall, loan), Chris Taylor (Blackpool, free), Mark Howard (Blackpool, free), Jeff King St Mirren, free), Aaron Wilbraham (Rochdale, free), Darren Pratley (Charlton, free), Filipe Morais (Crawley, free)\n\nKey man: Erhun Oztumer\n\nChances: Bolton only survived by the skin of their teeth last term – having sold top scorer Gary Madine in January – and their preparations for this campaign have been hit by a friendly being cancelled due to players striking over unpaid wages and bonuses. It looks as though boss Phil Parkinson will once again face an uphill battle to preserve his side’s Championship status and boardroom issues will not help matters.\n\nBrentford\n\nManager: Dean Smith\n\nPosition last season: 9th\n\nNickname: The Bees\n\nGround: Griffin Park\n\nCapacity: 12,763\n\nPlayers in: Ezri Konsa (Charlton, undisclosed), Said Benrahma (Nice, undisclosed), Julien Jeanvier (Reims, undisclosed)\n\nPlayers out: Zain Westbrooke (Coventry, free), Konstantin Kerschbaumer (Ingolstadt, undisclosed), Theo Archibald (Forest Green, loan), Andreas Bjelland (FC Copenhagen, free), John Egan (Sheffield United, undisclosed), Florian Jozefzoon (Derby, undisclosed), Reece Cole (Yeovil, loan)\n\nKey man: Romaine Sawyers\n\nChances: Brentford have finished in the Championship’s top 10 in each of their last four seasons since winning promotion in 2014 and despite the Londoners’ modest budget could be among those challenging for the play-offs again. Manager Dean Smith, linked with West Brom this summer, has maintained the fine work of predecessors Uwe Rosler and Mark Warburton and more shrewd signings will strengthen his hand for the new campaign.\n\nBristol City\n\nManager: Lee Johnson\n\nPosition last season: 11th\n\nNickname: Robins\n\nGround: Ashton Gate\n\nCapacity: 27,000\n\nPlayers in: Adam Webster (Ipswich, undisclosed), Marley Watkins (Norwich, £1million), Hakeeb Adelakun (Scunthorpe, free), Andreas Weimann (Derby, undisclosed), Jack Hunt (Sheffield Wednesday, undisclosed), Mohamed Eisa (Cheltenham, undisclosed), Niki Maenpaa (Brighton, free)\n\nPlayers out: Gary O’Neil, Luke Steele, Scott Golbourne, Arnold Garita (all released), Hordur Magnusson (CSKA Moscow, undisclosed), Aden Flint (Middlesbrough, undisclosed), Bobby Reid (Cardiff, undisclosed), Gustav Engvall (KV Mechelen, undisclosed), Zak Vyner (Rotherham, loan), Jonny Smith (Tranmere, loan), George Dowling (Eastleigh, loan), Antoine Semenyo (Newport, loan), Luke Steele (Nottingham Forest, free), Tyreeq Bakinson (Newport, loan)\n\nKey man: Famara Diedhiou\n\nChances: Bristol City helped set the early pace in the Championship last season, losing only four league games before the turn of the year, but just four victories from January until the end of the season put paid to their promotion hopes. Star players Aden Flint and Bobby Reid have been sold for big profit and although boss Lee Johnson has recruited wisely, it remains to be seen whether the Robins can mount another challenge.\n\nDerby County\n\nManager: Frank Lampard\n\nPosition last season: 6th\n\nNickname: The Rams\n\nGround: Pride Park Stadium\n\nCapacity: 32,600\n\nPlayers in: Mason Mount (Chelsea, loan), Harry Wilson (Liverpool, loan), Florian Jozefzoon (Brentford, undisclosed), Jack Marriott (Peterborough, undisclosed), George Evans (Reading, undisclosed)\n\nPlayers out: Chris Baird, Jason Shackell, Darren Bent (all released), Andreas Weimann (Bristol City, undisclosed), Charles Vernam (Grimsby, undisclosed)\n\nKey man: Matej Vydra\n\nChances: Frank Lampard has not picked an easy assignment for his first foray into management with Derby owner Mel Morris cutting costs ahead of this campaign after the club once again failed to win promotion last season. Charged with handling a tight budget and making progress on the pitch after the club missed out in the play-offs in May, former Chelsea midfielder Lampard will have succeeded if he gets the Rams anywhere near the top six.\n\nHull City\n\nManager: Nigel Adkins\n\nPosition last season: 18th\n\nNickname: The Tigers\n\nGround: KCOM Stadium\n\nCapacity: 25,586\n\nPlayers in: Eric Lichaj (Nottingham Forest, undisclosed), David Milinkovic (Genoa, undisclosed), Reece Burke (West Ham, undisclosed), Jordy de Wijs (PSV Eindhoven, undisclosed), Todd Kane (Chelsea, loan), George Long (Sheffield United, undisclosed)\n\nPlayers out: Greg Luer, Greg Olley, Josh Clackstone (all released), David Meyler (Reading, free), Allan McGregor (Rangers, free), Max Clark (Vitesse Arnhem, undisclosed), Michael Dawson (Nottingham Forest, free) Seb Larsson (AIK Solna, free)\n\nKey man: Jarrod Bowen\n\nChances: Hull endured a dismal first season back in the Championship, flirting with back-to-back relegations after dropping out of the Premier League in 2017. Experienced trio Michael Dawson, Allan McGregor and Seb Larsson have all departed and Nigel Adkins has made his intentions clear by drafting in young, hungry players. The Tigers will benefit from a pre-season of stability and should challenge in the top half of the table.\n\nIpswich Town\n\nManager: Paul Hurst\n\nPosition last season: 12th\n\nNickname: Tractor Boys\n\nGround: Portman Road\n\nCapacity: 30,311\n\nPlayers in: Trevoh Chalobah (Chelsea, loan), Jordan Roberts (Crawley, free), Gwion Edwards (Peterborough, undisclosed), Ellis Harrison (Bristol Rovers, £750,000), Janoi Donacien (Accrington, loan)\n\nPlayers out: Michael Crowe (Preston, free), Stephen Gleeson (Aberdeen, free), Adam Webster (Bristol City, undisclosed), Luke Hyam (Southend, free), David McGoldrick (Sheffield United, free)\n\nKey man: Martyn Waghorn\n\nChances: Ipswich fans are expecting entertaining football from new manager Paul Hurst, but he must work with a similar playing budget to that of predecessor Mick McCarthy, who quit before he intended to last season after falling out with fans. Former Shrewsbury boss Hurst will use the money from the sale of Adam Webster to fund team strengthening, but the Tractor Boys must go through a period of transition this season.\n\nLeeds United\n\nManager: Marcelo Bielsa\n\nPosition last season: 13th\n\nNickname: Whites\n\nGround: Elland Road\n\nCapacity: 39,460\n\nPlayers in: Lewis Baker (Chelsea, loan), Jamal Blackman (Chelsea, loan), Barry Douglas (Wolves, undisclosed), Jack Harrison (Manchester City, loan), Patrick Bamford (Middlesbrough, undisclosed)\n\nPlayers out: Madger Gomes (Sochaux, undisclosed), Felix Wiedwald (Eintracht Frankfurt, undisclosed), Marcus Antonsson (Malmo, undisclosed), Andy Lonergan (released), Mallik Wilks (Doncaster, loan), Paudie O’Connor (Blackpool, loan), Tyler Denton (Peterborough, loan), Jay-Roy Grot (VVV Venlo, loan), Pawel Cibicki (Molde, loan), Lewie Coyle (Fleetwood, loan), Luke Murphy (Bolton, free), Ronaldo Vieira (Sampdoria, undisclosed), Hadi Sacko (Las Palmas, loan)\n\nKey man: Samuel Saiz\n\nChances: Expectation has risen since former Argentina and Chile boss Marcelo Bielsa was appointed in June after last season’s promotion challenge evaporated. Much depends on how Bielsa gets on with the hierarchy at Elland Road and the club’s summer recruitment, but if the 62-year-old settles quickly and is allowed to get on with his business he could organise Leeds into genuine top-six contenders. Either way, fans should hold on to their hats for the ride.\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nManager: Tony Pulis\n\nPosition last season: 5th\n\nNickname: Boro\n\nGround: Riverside Stadium\n\nCapacity: 34,000\n\nPlayers in: Paddy McNair (Sunderland, £5million), Aden Flint (Bristol City, £6million)\n\nPlayers out: Antonio Barragan (Real Betis, undisclosed), Tomas Mejias (released), Martin Cranie (released), George Miller (Bradford, loan), Fabio Da Silva (Nantes, undisclosed), Joe Fryer (Carlisle, loan), Hayden Coulson (St Mirren, loan), Callum Cooke (Peterborough, undisclosed), Patrick Bamford (Leeds, undisclosed)\n\nKey man: Aden Flint\n\nChances: Having finished fifth and lost to Aston Villa in the play-off semi-finals last season, Middlesbrough will be looking to leave nothing to chance this time around. They moved swiftly to tie up Bristol City defender Aden Flint and Sunderland utility player Paddy McNair, but with potential suitors eyeing the likes of Adama Traore, Adam Clayton and Britt Assombalonga and additional targets in mind, there could yet be further movement.\n\nMillwall\n\nManager: Neil Harris\n\nPosition last season: 8th\n\nNickname: The Lions\n\nGround: The Den\n\nCapacity: 20,146\n\nPlayers in: Murray Wallace (Scunthorpe, undisclosed), Ben Amos (Bolton, loan)\n\nPlayers out: Tim Cahill, Jimmy Abdou, Kris Twardek, Jamie Philpot, Christian Mbulu, Noel Leighton, Harry Girling (all released), Noah Chesmain (Colchester, free), Harry Toffolo (Lincoln, free), Tom King (AFC Wimbledon, loan), Kristian Brymora (Hassleholms IF, free), Harry Smith (Macclesfield, free)\n\nKey man: Shaun Hutchinson\n\nChances: Millwall were one of the Championship’s surprise packages last season as a 17-match unbeaten run from January catapulted them into play-off contention and Neil Harris’s tight-knit group, led by talisman Steve Morison, will be gunning to defy the odds again. The Lions may find it harder after their first campaign back in the second tier, but the Londoners’ unbreakable team spirit will stand them in good stead.\n\nNorwich City\n\nManager: Daniel Farke\n\nPosition last season: 14th\n\nNickname: The Canaries\n\nGround: Carrow Road\n\nCapacity: 27,244\n\nPlayers in: Emi Buendia (Getafe, undisclosed), Moritz Leitner (Augsburg, undisclosed), Teemu Pukki (Brondby, free), Ben Marshall (Wolves, undisclosed), Felix Passlack (Borussia Dortmund, loan), Jordan Rhodes (Sheffield Wednesday, loan), Tim Krul (Brighton, free)\n\nPlayers out: Wes Hoolahan (released), Tristan Abrahams (Exeter, loan), Marcel Franke (SV Darmstadt, loan), Ebou Adams (Ebbsfleet, free), James Maddison (Leicester, undisclosed), Josh Murphy (Cardiff, undisclosed), Steven Naismith (Hearts, loan), Marley Watkins (Bristol City, £1million), Adam Phillips (Hamilton, loan), Diallang Jaiyesimi (Yeovil, loan), Yanic Wildschut (Bolton, loan), Sean Raggett (Rotherham, loan)\n\nKey man: Ben Marshall\n\nChances: After last season’s disappointing first campaign in English football, the pressure is on boss Daniel Farke to deliver a sustained assault on the top six. Norwich have cashed in on star players James Maddison and Josh Murphy and the German has brought in a raft of new signings, which he must quickly gel into an effective unit or face another campaign of mid-table mediocrity and the wrath of Canaries fans.\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nManager: Aitor Karanka\n\nPosition last season: 17th\n\nNickname: The Reds\n\nGround: City Ground\n\nCapacity: 30,445\n\nPlayers in: Michael Dawson (Hull, free), Joao Carvalho (Benfica, £13.5million), Diogo Goncalves (Benfica, loan), Gil Bastiao Dias (Monaco, loan), Hillal Soudani (Dinamo Zagreb, undisclosed), Costel Pantilimon (Watford, undisclosed), Jack Robinson (QPR, free), Lewis Grabban (Bournemouth, undisclosed), Jack Colback (Newcastle, loan), Luke Steele (Bristol City, free)\n\nPlayers out: Chris Cohen, Ashkan Dejagah, Jack Hobbs (all released), David Vaughan (Notts County, free), Eric Lichaj (Hull, undisclosed), Aaron Smith (Hamilton, free), Tyler Walker (Mansfield, loan), Jorge Grant (Luton, loan), Jason Cummings (Peterborough, loan), Barrie McKay (Swansea, undisclosed)\n\nKey man: Lewis Grabban\n\nChances: Former Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka knows what it takes to win promotion from the Championship and has been heavily backed by the club’s board to deliver success as they embark on their 20th season outside the top flight. Signings such as Costel Pantilimon, Joao Carvalho, Diogo Goncalves and Lewis Grabban are a huge statement of intent and anything less than a play-off place must be seen as a failure.\n\nPreston North End\n\nManager: Alex Neil\n\nPosition last season: 7th\n\nNickname: The Lilywhites\n\nGround: Deepdale\n\nCapacity: 23,404\n\nPlayers in: Ryan Ledson (Oxford, undisclosed), Michael Crowe (Ipswich, free), Jordan Storey (Exeter, undisclosed), Graham Burke (Shamrock Rovers, undisclosed), Andrew Hughes (Peterborough, undisclosed)\n\nPlayers out: Jermaine Beckford, Anders Lindegaard, Clive Smith (all released), Greg Cunningham (Cardiff, undisclosed), John Welsh (Grimsby, free), Tommy Spurr (Fleetwood, loan), Mathew Hudson (Bury, loan), Eoin Doyle (Bradford, free)\n\nKey man: Alan Browne\n\nChances: Alex Neil’s Preston finished just outside the play-offs in the Scot’s first season at the helm even after they lost key striker Jordan Hugill to West Ham in the winter transfer window. Sean Maguire reached double figures despite missing four months of the season through injury. The Republic of Ireland international could be the difference maker for a settled side, who could challenge again, in Neil’s second term in charge.\n\nQueen's Park Rangers\n\nManager: Steve McClaren\n\nPosition last season: 16th\n\nNickname: The Hoops\n\nGround: Loftus Road\n\nCapacity: 18,238\n\nPlayers in: Joe Felix (Fulham, free), Toni Leistner (Union Berlin, free)\n\nPlayers out: Nedum Onuoha, James Perch, Jamie Mackie, Jay Emmanuel-Thomas (all released), Alex Smithies (Cardiff, undisclosed), Jack Robinson (Nottingham Forest, free)\n\nKey man: Massimo Luongo\n\nChances: Former England boss Steve McClaren was appointed in May following the departure of Ian Holloway and immediately quashed any talk of a promotion challenge in his first season in charge. The Hoops have finished 18th and 16th in their previous two seasons and McClaren has targeted a top-half placing. He will have to work within the club’s modest playing budget and will do well to keep his latest club out of the lower echelons.\n\nReading\n\nManager: Paul Clement\n\nPosition last season: 20th\n\nNickname: Royals\n\nGround: Madejski Stadium\n\nCapacity: 24,161\n\nPlayers in: Andy Yiadom (Barnsley, free), John O’Shea (Sunderland, free), David Meyler (Hull, free), Marc McNulty (Coventry, undisclosed), Darren Sidoel (Ajax, undisclosed), Sam Walker (Colchester, free), Sam Baldock (Brighton, undisclosed)\n\nPlayers out: Stephen Quinn, Joseph Mendes, Deniss Rakels (all released), Jonathan Bond (West Brom, free), Sandro Wieser (FC Vaduz, free), Danzell Gravenberch (KSV Roeselare, loan), Tennai Watson (AFC Wimbledon, loan), Yann Kermorgant (released), Joey van den Berg (NEC Nijmegen, loan), Lewis Ward (Northampton, loan), George Evans (Derby, undisclosed), Sam Smith (Oxford, loan)\n\nKey man: Liam Moore\n\nChances: Reading were embroiled in a relegation dogfight last season and appointed Paul Clement as Jaap Stam’s replacement in March. But the Royals won only two of their last eight games under Clement and could struggle to make headway again unless experienced signings John O’Shea and David Meyler can help galvanise a club that lost its way. A mid-table finish can be expected at best in their bid to stay clear of the bottom three.\n\nRotherham\n\nManager: Paul Warne\n\nPosition last season: 4th in League One\n\nNickname: Millers\n\nGround: New York Stadium\n\nCapacity: 12,021\n\nPlayers in: Kyle Vassell (Blackpool, undisclosed), Clark Robertson (Blackpool, undisclosed), Zak Vyner (Bristol City, loan), Marek Rodak (Fulham, loan), Sean Raggett (Norwich, loan)\n\nPlayers out: Shaun Cummings, Mason Warren, Kuda Muskwe, Darnelle Bailey-King (all released), Jonson Clarke-Harris (Coventry, free), Dominic Ball (Aberdeen, loan), Jerry Yates (Carlisle, loan), Ben Purrington (AFC Wimbledon, loan)\n\nKey man: Will Vaulks\n\nChances: Rotherham are back in the Championship after one year in the third tier and should not find it too hard to do better than last time they were in the division when they went down with a record low points total. Momentum and a feelgood factor under popular manager Paul Warne might carry the Millers far, but although some lessons might be learned, a relegation battle lies ahead.\n\nSheffield United\n\nManager: Chris Wilder\n\nPosition last season: 10th\n\nNickname: The Blades\n\nGround: Bramall Lane\n\nCapacity: 32,702\n\nPlayers in: Dean Henderson (Manchester United, loan), John Egan (Brentford, undisclosed), David McGoldrick (Ipswich, free), Kean Bryan (Manchester City, free), Ben Woodburn (Liverpool, loan)\n\nPlayers out: Clayton Donaldson (Bolton, free), Chris Hussey (Cheltenham, free), Louis Reed (Peterborough, undisclosed), Samir Carruthers (Oxford, loan), Ben Heneghan (Blackpool, loan), Nathan Thomas (Notts County, loan), James Hanson (AFC Wimbledon, undisclosed), David Brooks (Bournemouth, undisclosed), George Long (Hull, undisclosed), Harvey Gilmour (Tranmere, loan), Sam Graham (Oldham, loan), Ched Evans (Fleetwood, loan), Regan Slater (Carlisle, loan)\n\nKey man: John Fleck\n\nChances: Sheffield United’s continued progress under manager Chris Wilder is in danger of being undermined by the High Court battle between joint-owners Kevin McCabe and Prince Abdullah. The Blades’ back-to-back promotion challenge last season faded, but midfielder Paul Coutts’ return from a broken leg and Wilder’s ability to get the best out of his players should see them in the mix for a top-six finish.\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\nManager: Jos Luhukay\n\nPosition last season: 15th\n\nNickname: Owls\n\nGround: Hillsborough\n\nCapacity: 39,732\n\nPlayers in:\n\nPlayers out: Ross Wallace, Jake Kean (both released),Glenn Loovens (Sunderland, free), Jordan Rhodes (Norwich, loan), Jack Hunt (Bristol City, undisclosed)\n\nKey man: Barry Bannan\n\nChances: Sheffield Wednesday suffered a play-off hangover last season after a top-six finish in 2017 under previous boss Carlos Carvalhal, with a catalogue of injuries making life difficult for replacement boss Jos Luhukay. The return of talisman forward Fernando Forestieri from a serious knee injury is key to the Owls’ chances this time around, but if he and the likes of Barry Bannan and Tom Lees stay fit they could challenge again.\n\nStoke City\n\nManager: Gary Rowett\n\nPosition last season: 19th in Premier League\n\nNickname: Potters\n\nGround: Bet365 Stadium\n\nCapacity: 30,089\n\nPlayers in: Oghenekaro Etebo (Feirense, £6.35million), Benik Afobe (Wolves, loan), Adam Federici (Bournemouth, undisclosed), James McClean (West Brom, £5million), Tom Ince (Huddersfield, £10million)\n\nPlayers out: Stephen Ireland, Glen Johnson (both released), Kevin Wimmer (Hannover, loan), Ramadan Sobhi (Huddersfield, undisclosed), Marc Muniesa (Girona, undisclosed), Lee Grant (Manchester United, undisclosed), Xherdan Shaqiri (Liverpool, £13million), Dominic Telford (Bury, free)\n\nKey man: Joe Allen\n\nChances: Stoke are expected to be among the promotion contenders and Gary Rowett is charged with taking the club straight back to the Premier League, after opting to leave Derby this summer to replace Paul Lambert. Big-name departures were expected following relegation, but that has generated money and Rowett has had a big budget to sign replacements. The best piece of business, however, is managing to keep Joe Allen.\n\nSwansea City\n\nManager: Graham Potter\n\nPosition last season: 18th in Premier League\n\nNickname: Swans\n\nGround: Liberty Stadium\n\nCapacity: 21,088\n\nPlayers in: Yan Dhanda (Liverpool, free), Jordi Govea (Real Madrid, free), Joel Asoro (Sunderland, undisclosed), Bersant Celina (Manchester City, undisclosed), Barrie McKay (Nottingham Forest, undisclosed)\n\nPlayers out: Angel Rangel (released), Ki Sung-yueng (Newcastle, free), Leon Britton (retired), Lukas Fabianski (West Ham, £6million), Kyle Bartley (West Brom, undisclosed), Kenji Gorre (Nacional, free), Borja Baston (Alaves, loan), Roque Mesa (Sevilla, undisclosed), Lewis Thomas (Forest Green, free), Adam King (Peterborough, loan)\n\nKey man: Jordan Ayew\n\nChances: Swansea were relegated in May after seven seasons in the top flight and former Ostersunds FK manager Graham Potter has been tasked with getting them straight back up following the departure of Carvalhal. Potter is up against it. The Englishman will oversee the club’s transfer policy, but could find it hard to replace the likes of Alfie Mawson, Wilfred Bony and the Ayew brothers should they all leave in the summer.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion\n\nManager: Darren Moore\n\nPosition last season: 20th in Premier League\n\nNickname: Baggies\n\nGround: The Hawthorns\n\nCapacity: 26,688\n\nPlayers in: Sam Johnstone (Manchester United, £6.5million), Kyle Bartley (Swansea, undisclosed), Jonathan Bond (Reading, free), Harvey Barnes (Leicester City, loan), Conor Townsend (Scunthorpe, undisclosed)\n\nPlayers out: Claudio Yacob, Gareth McAuley (all released), Jonny Evans (Leicester, £3.5million), Tahvon Campbell (Forest Green, undisclosed), Ben Foster (Watford, undisclosed), James McClean (Stoke, £5million)\n\nKey man: Nacer Chadli\n\nChances: Relegated from the Premier League last season, West Brom will be one of the favourites for promotion, but rookie boss Darren Moore is untested after just six games in charge in April and May following the departure of Alan Pardew. The Baggies’ bid to bounce straight back will be boosted by parachute payments, but they have lost key players and it will not be easy for Moore to rebuild a squad after a turbulent period both on and off the field last season.\n\nWigan Athletic\n\nManager: Paul Cook\n\nPosition last season: 1st in League One\n\nNickname: Latics\n\nGround: DW Stadium\n\nCapacity: 25,133\n\nPlayers in: Kal Naismith (Portsmouth, free), Leonardo Da Silva Lopes (Peterborough, undisclosed), Christian Walton (Brighton, loan), Reece James (Chelsea, loan), Callum McManaman (Sunderland, free)\n\nPlayers out: Donervon Daniels, Reece James, Andy Kellett, Sam Stubbs (all released), Luke Burke (AFC Fylde, free), David Perkins (Rochdale, free), Craig Morgan (Fleetwood, undisclosed), Terell Thomas (AFC Wimbledon, undisclosed), Josh Laurent (Shrewsbury, undisclosed)\n\nKey man: Will Grigg\n\nChances: For the second time in three years, Wigan arrive in the Championship having won the League One title. They went straight back down last time as Nick Powell and Will Grigg struggled for fitness and form. Both need to prove they can cut it at this level, but manager Paul Cook will be encouraged by recent FA Cup wins over Premier League trio Bournemouth, West Ham and Manchester City.\n\nLEAGUE
