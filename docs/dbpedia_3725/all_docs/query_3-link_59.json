        "text": "As mentioned before, I have a lot of small, previously unplayable, nations loaded and this meant when I started my save (in June 2017) there were plenty of jobs available.\n\nMy manager, if you can even call this guy a manager right now, was created to be the worst possible professional I could possibly conceive and, as you can see from the above, he has a terrible set of skills to go alongside his Sunday League Footballer previous experience. Despite this, the reputation of many of the divisions I had loaded meant that interviews were actually pretty easy to come by and I eventually found myself in a position whereby I was able to select where I wanted to go. I looked for somewhere where their league season had not already started, as I always like having a full preseason to sort things out.\n\nI eventually found somewhere and so would like to welcome you all to James Yates' first club side, Mount Rich.\n\nClub Background:\n\nWho? I hear you all cry...\n\nMount Rich are a very small, semi-professional side based in Grenada, one of the many Caribbean islands. They are a club situated in the northeastern corner of the island, more specifically in a town called Morne Fendue. They were formed in 1986 but they really do not have much in terms of a history, having won the Grenadian second division on two separate occasions but having never previously before played in the countries top domestic league.\n\nWithin Grenada itself they do hold a national reputation rating but that equates to just half a star, the lowest possible on FM.\n\nFacilities:\n\nIs it weird that I was genuinely quite happy with these facilities.\n\nOur home stadium is the Plains Playing Field, and a quick Google image search suggests that calling this place a stadium is a bit of a stretch. It genuinely appears to have no stands, and instead the 700 fans just stand around the edge of the touchline in order to watch the action unfold. Despite this, the average price of a ticket is £8, which seems incredibly steep considering you do not get a seat for the 90 minutes!\n\nElsewhere, our training facilities (both senior and youth) are of the basic level but, given our semi-professional club status, I cannot imagine we will be developing too many players through team training so this does not really bother me. What is quite exciting is the youth recruitment level, which already sits at well established. Our junior coaching needs some work but I guess we at least have the potential to maybe recruit some youngsters who are ready for the first team.\n\nCompetitions:\n\nThis is the main reason I wanted to start this type of save, to experience some different competitions. Thanks to the fantastic work of @claassen, we will be competing in two different domestic competitions this season.\n\nFirstly, we will take part in the GFA Premier Division. This is the top tier of domestic football in Grenada and is currently ranked the 35th most reputable division in North America. There are currently 11 sides in the top division and everyone plays each other twice for a total of 20 fixtures. The league rules suggest that the division runs from July to December, so no idea what happens from January onwards - maybe the longest preseason ever?\n\nThere are not too many other GFA Premier Division rules. You are only allowed 4 foreign players in the playing 11, not that I imagine I will be attracting any, and the bottom three sides all are automatically relegated. Given that the division below is not accessible, this means finishing in the bottom three will cause me to automatically be fired.\n\nThe media unfortunately seem to think that this is a distinct possibility but, with a predicted finish of 8th, I am hopeful that we can avoid relegation. A few interesting teams in this league including Grenada Boys Secondary School (GBSS), who are only allowed to field players under the age of 20, and Queens Park Rangers, whose badge looks almost exactly the same as their English namesakes.\n\nThe most successful sides from recent times however have been Hard Rock FC and Paradise Sports Club, with the former having won the league title on a record four occasions whilst Paradise have five of their current squad players in the senior Grenada national team.\n\nAlongside the league we also take part in a domestic cup, which has to have the single best name for any competition ever, the Waggy-T Super Knockout Football Tournament. From what I can tell, it is a very simplistic knockout cup, involving primarily the teams from the top division and a few select first division opponents, for 16 teams in total. All fixtures are played over a single leg with extra time and then penalties being used to determine the winners in each round.\n\nThis tournament has been dominated by Paradise Sports Club, who have won the trophy a record four times and been named champions the past two seasons. The only really shock win here came in 2010 when Super Strikers picked up their sole piece of silverware.\n\nGrenadian Football:\n\nAs previously mentioned, the domestic side of football in Grenada is relatively poor, with an entirely semi-professional league system and a top division lacking in reputation. To make up for things, the governing body decided to name their domestic cup with the greatest name I have ever read...\n\nOn the international front, the senior side are currently managed by Andrew Munroe, who was previously the national U20 manager for four years. They are currently ranked 156th in the world, behind the likes of Cambodia, Bangladesh and Madagascar, and have no historical achievements of note.\n\nThey will compete in the CFU Caribbean Cup (a competition I managed in during my previous save when with Martinique) and they will also get to take part in the CONCACAF World Cup Qualifiers. There best player is Aaron Pierre, a defender who currently plays for Northampton in England. The most capped player in the squad however is Shane Rennie, a central midfielder who currently plays for Paradise Sports Club in his homeland.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo that concludes my introduction to Mount Rich, James Yates first ever managerial job. I am assuming most people here have never managed in Grenada before so I am hoping you guys enjoy this slightly alternative journey.\n\nI will be back soon with a preseason update, which will look at the delightful squad I have inherited and cover the few transfers I have been able to make. Thanks again for reading and please leave a comment if you are enjoying!\n\nUpdate 1: Preseason 2017\n\nTeam: Mount Rich\n\nDivision: GFA Premier Division\n\nHaving arrived on the sunny island of Grenada, there was no time wasted in getting stuck into preseason business with new club, Mount Rich. This update will cover the budgets, transfers, squad overview and friendly results, given you all an insight into what life is like in the GFA Premier Division.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOARD ROOM:\n\nThe chairman of Mount Rich is a man named Jake Straker, the guy who was willing to sign an unknown Englishman from London for his small, semi-professional, Grenadian football club. In terms of finances, I was fairly happy with what I was given:\n\nI sort of gathered that I would not be offered any sort of a transfer fund but a wage budget of £862 was way more than I was expecting. Given that most players at the club are on very small part-time deals or on non-contracts, this was more than enough to cover my preseason spending spree.\n\nIn addition, the board also made their objectives for the coming season known to me:\n\nBoard Objectives (2017)\n\nGFA Premier Division - Avoid Relegation\n\nWaggy-T Super Knockout Football Tournament - Be Competitive\n\nBoth very much achievable in my opinion. I am hoping I can push for a midtable finish in the league and then who knows what might happen in the cup.\n\nCLUB STAFF:\n\nWhen I joined, the club had an assistant manager, a physio and a single scout. I made it a preseason priority to build a basic backroom staff, one that would hopefully be able to apply sufficient coaching to our players.\n\nI ended up hiring a rather varied bunch of people, predominantly all regens, but from a variety of Caribbean nations. My backroom staff consists of two Grenadian nationals, two from Trinidad & Tobago, one from St. Vincent & the Grenadines, one from St. Lucia and one from Barbados. I am not sure if this will affect my youth intake at all but it would be nice to see us receive some players from the other Caribbean islands.\n\nTRANSFERS:\n\nI am not going to bore you with a list of all the out transfers as it was mainly me releasing players who were nowhere near up to standard for the club. I will look at released players in future seasons, when I have a bit more of an affiliation to and you guys have a bit more knowledge of the players departing.\n\n(In)\n\nI did add nine players to the squad though, with the majority signing on free transfers.\n\nThe weakest players here are probably attacking midfielder Nigel Modeste (22) and forward Kirani Greenidge (25). Despite their lack of skill, these two will likely be prime rotation options this year, having both joined on a non-contract basis from fellow GFA Premier Division sides.\n\nI signed central defender Earldon McQueen (28) from another GFA Premier Division league side, Super Strikers, and he will likely slot into the first eleven.\n\nOne of the better signings here was that of Kimron Redhead (35), who we purchased for £25 from first division side Boca Juniors. Redhead has played 18 times for the senior national side and can operate in central midfield, as a shadow striker or up top and his versatility should prove extremely valuable this season. We signed another Boca Juniors player in the form of teenage midfield Chad Mark (19). The youngster has already represented the senior national side on one occasion and so should be right at home in our first eleven having become our clubs record ever signing, costing £240.\n\nWe then picked up a pair of fullbacks in Quinton Rennie (27) from Paradise Sports Club and Kimron Marshall (24) fromSt. John's Sports. Both of these guys were inexplicable signed to non-contract agreements at their respective clubs so we were able to lure them away for free.\n\nOne of the best two signings of this window though is without a doubt Henson Cuffie (30).\n\nDo not get me wrong, this guy is not anything amazing, but at this level he is a pretty class midfielder. He has a fairly good set of physical attributes despite his age, including good pace and agility. What really impresses me is his technical skills however, he has high ratings for both passing and tackling, and should become an all-round monster in the middle of the park this year.\n\nHe is another who has represented his country at international level, clocking up 13 senior appearances.\n\nThe other signing that I was really pleased with was that of Uriah Enoe (19).\n\nThe young forward was signed from Hilltop Ballers, a team in the first division, on a fee transfer. He has already played a pair of games for the national U20 squad and at first glance his physical attributes would not look out of place in some of the lower European leagues. He has good pace, jumping, natural fitness and agility, all skills that can be keys to success in lower reputation divisions. He also has good dribbling skills to go alongside solid finishing and heading, meaning I am already predicting that this guy will be our top scorer come the end of the year.\n\nTHE SQUAD:\n\nUnsurprisingly my assistant agrees that Henson Cuffie (30) will be a key players for us this season, rating him at 4.5*CA. The only five star player in the squad was one who was already here when I arrived, central defender Nicko Williams (27). He is a very solid defender and should prove very valuable this season given our weak goalkeeper situation. Fullbacks Kimron Marshall (24) and Quinton Rennie (27) both look like very solid additions.\n\nWe have already mentioned Chad Mark (19) and forward Uriah Enoe (19) who both look like solid, young, additions. One other player that I like the look of is midfielder Earldon Millette (18) who, despite his young years, looks pretty talented. Two other teenagers that I like the look of are attackers Kirani Noel (16) and David McQueen (16), both of whom should feature in the first team quite a bit as the year goes on.\n\nOverall, I am fairly happy with this squad. The first eleven are pretty decent but the glaring weakness here is clearly our severe lack of depth. I literally have only one left fullback and have almost no-one else who can play in the centre of midfield behind the three standout players. Our goalkeeping situation is also far from ideal, where I will be having to start Kuan Williams (16) between the sticks.\n\nTACTICS:\n\nA completely new tactic for me. If you read my other story you will know that I had loads of success with a winger-heavy, overlapping style and although I would have loved to replicate that here, I simply do not have the personnel to do so. Our squad is completely devoid of anyone who can play out wide and instead I have had to come up with something a little more creative.\n\nIt is essentially a 4-3-3 but with a player filling in between the midfield trio and attacking pair. I have not played much FM using this style before so I am very wary of how it might turn out. For starters I realise that this set-up is very narrow so I will likely set the fullbacks to an attacking mentality, in order to try and provide some semblance of width.\n\nI like to play primarily on a control mentality but with a fluid team shape as I think it is important to allow players to contribute to the different phases when asking individuals to overlap and when passing into space. This leads onto my specific team instructions, which include; pass into space, work ball into box, look for overlap, play narrower, and roam from positions. The whole idea is that we try to attack the centre of opposition teams, using our superior numbers through the middle. If this does not prove effective, we have the option to play into space on the overlap where hopefully our fullbacks will be working hard to get forward.\n\nIn theory this whole thing makes sense in my head but I have no idea how fruitful it will be when it comes to actual games. As always, every player has also been given his own set of individual instructions to ensure the worst passers do not try anything silly etc.\n\nFriendly RESULTS:\n\nW = 2, D = 1, L = 2\n\nWe had a fairly torrid preseason as the players failed to gel quickly and the tactic struggled to shine.\n\nWe lost our opening fixture against fellow Premier Division side St. John's Sport before then struggling to a draw against another league rival in the form of Chantimelle. We then saw some real improvements during the final three fixtures. Firstly we played really well against a very talented St. Ann's Rangers team from Trinidad & Tobago. Despite the strength of our opponents we played very well and created a good number of chances. We finished the preseason with a pair of 2-0 wins, albeit against first division Grenadian sides.\n\nI was fairly impressed with out abilities going forward as we did manage to score in every game. We did look a bit stretched defensively, especially against the better sides and this is a bit of a concern going into he start of the league season. Kimron Redhead and Uriah Enoe both had pretty good preseasons, scoring two goals each, whilst fullbacks Kimron Marshall and Quinton Rennie both looked very adept at playing in their attacking fullback roles.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere was no other news from the preseason. We stayed pretty much free of injury and will be going into our first league fixture with a fully available squad. I am fairy happy with the signings we made, I mean they definitely helped to strengthen the side, but we are lacking depth in so many areas that I really cannot see us challenging the top sides for any silverware this year. I am however confident that we can avoid relegation and my aim will be to push for a midtable finish.\n\nI will hopefully be back soon with an update covering the first month or so of competitive football in Grenada. Again, I hope you are all enjoying this rather alternative type of story!\n\nUpdate 2: August 2017\n\nTeam: Mount Rich\n\nDivision: GFA Premier Division\n\nThe preseason is over and the start of my first year in Grenada is here. The previous update highlighted some key new signings that I hope will be able to guide us to a safe, mid-table, finish. Alongside this however, the offseason also offered an insight into how much different managing in a small country might be. For starters, our tactic, which I have very little experience in using, looked pretty average throughout all the friendly games as we were simply unable to find any rhythm or consistency.\n\nThis, alongside financial constraints and the strength of some of the opposition teams, had me thinking that I might have made a bad move in staring my career on this little Caribbean island...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGFA Premier Division RESULTS:\n\nW = 6, D = 0, L = 0\n\nWell this was a lot better start than I had envisioned.\n\nWe started the year with an emphatic home win against a fairly weak Super Strikers side, netting four goals but never could I have imagined how good we would be from there on in. We followed this win up with three further games where we scored four goals, including a brilliant home victory over a strong Hard Rock team.\n\nWe then hosted Paradise Sports Club, one of the better teams in the division and, in a true back and forth affair, we managed to come away 3-2 winners thanks to goals from Kimron Redhead, Uriah Enoe and Kirani Greenidge. Our final game of August saw us travel to Chantimelle and we continued our superb goalscoring record, finishing with a fine 3-0 win.\n\nWe were absolutely superb in August and most pleasing was our attacking prowess, a part of our game that was missing in the preseason, but the tactic has been crazily effective and we have created chances freely in every game we have played. Overall we scored a ridiculous 22 goals in our six fixtures, conceding just three, as we totally dominated all opponents in the GFA Premier Division.\n\nPLAYER STATISTICS:\n\nI apologise in advance if you are not that interested in statistics but I love analysing player performances, it gives me a real indication of the process behind that all-important average rating figure. Speaking of which, we finished the first month with an impressive 14 players holding an average rating of at least 7.0.\n\nThe key man thus far has been Kimron Redhead (8.45). The 35 year old former international joined the club at the start of the season and has duly impressed during his first seven games. He has played 13 key passes, clocked up 5 assists and added 7 individual goals from his deep-lying forward position.\n\nIn defence, fullbacks Quinton Rennie (8.10) and Kimron Marshall (7.93) have both thrived within the tactic and played superbly. The duo have tallied five assists between them whilst Rennie is averaging 3.40 tackles/game. Central defender Earldon McQueen (7.76) has proved an excellent offseason addition whilst defensive partner Nicko Williams (7.18) is averaging a team-high 4.00 tackles/game at an impressive 94% success rate. Young goalkeeper Kuan Williams (6.85) has played reasonably but there is definitely room for improvement there.\n\nIn midfield the key contributor has been 19 year old Chad Mark (7.52). The newly signed teenager has netted three goals whilst completing 83% of his passes. His strong play in the middle of the park has been supported by the performances of both Earldon Millette (7.32) and Henson Cuffie (7.18), with the later averaging 3.31 tackles/game whilst also leading the squad with an 86% pass completion rate.\n\nIn attack, the key man alongside redhead has been new signing Uriah Enoe (7.54). The teenager has been a revelation and is quite clearly too good for this division having scored 4 goals in just five appearances. He averages 3.52 dribbles/game, highlighting his tendency to run at opposition defenders, a trait which I love at this level. Elsewhere, young attacking midfielders David McQueen (7.38) and Kirani Noel (7.08) have both impressed playing in the slot behind the two main forwards.\n\nLEAGUE TABLE:\n\nTOP OF THE LEAGUE?!\n\nAnd with a game in hand over second placed Hurricanes! I am very pleased with how we have performed though and to be ahead of some of the bigger sides, including Paradise Sports Club, is very pleasing. Hard Rock, who were also predicted to challenge for the title, have had a bit of a disastrous season thus far and currently find themselves down in 7th. SAB are the only side yet to win a game but to give you an idea of how crazy this league is, here are the results for Super Strikers, the side we beat on opening day:\n\nTalk about inconsistent form!\n\nThis has been a running theme throughout the league thus far, some really crazy games with an absolute ton of goals.\n\nAs previously mentioned though, our attacking prowess has been a real key feature of our early season successes. In the league, our 22 goals scored and +19 goal difference are easily the best in the division. Defensively we have been solid, having conceding just 3 goals, which is also the best record in the league.\n\nOTHER NEWS:\n\nThere was not much else in the way of other news this month but here are a few bits that might be of interest.\n\nInjuries:\n\nWe had stayed relatively free of injury throughout the preseason but we did suffer a one fairly severe knocks when newly signed forward Kirani Greenidge pulled a hamstring during the opening game of the season.\n\nInjuries at this level can have a devastating impact. Squads are small in size and three or four injuries to star players can really have a big effect given the lack of depth. Hopefully the injury bug stays away otherwise our lack of rotation options might prove costly.\n\nInternational News:\n\nThe first Grenadian squads of this save were recently announced and, amazingly, seven of our players were called up to represent their country.\n\nFirstly, young goalkeeper Kuan Williams was placed in the Under 20s, the 16 year old having started every league game for us this season.\n\nEven more exciting was the news that Earldon Millette and Uriah Enoe, who were both previously in the U20s themselves, had received their first call-ups for the senior national side.\n\nThe other four players, central defender Nicko Williams, fullback Quinton Rennie, and central midfielders Henson Cuffie and Chad Mark have all previously represented their country at the senior level but it was still nice to see our early season form get some recognition on an international stage.\n\nUnfortunately Enoe did not get to make an appearance in either friendly game but Earldon Millette was handed a start during the friendly against Puerto Rico and had a pretty solid game, with his side winning 1-0. Hopefully this will be the start of a long international career for the teenager.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo that brings to an end my first month of management in Grenada. We are currently on a superb run in the league and look unstoppable going forward, banging in goals galore through our first six games. Some of the new signings are proving excellent additions and we have managed to stay clear of any major injuries thus far.\n\nWith just 20 league games in a season, we are technically a third through the campaign already. It is looking as though we will easily achieve our target of a mid table finish but now have an opportunity to push for an unlikely league title in our very first season!\n\nHope you guys are enjoying this Caribbean adventure. Is there any other nation/continent that you would like to see me managing in next?\n\nUpdate 3: September & October 2017\n\nTeam: Mount Rich\n\nDivision: GFA Premier Division\n\nWelcome back to my little Caribbean adventure where, as you may recall, I had recently joined Mount Rich on the small island of Grenada. In the previous update we got off to a superb start, winning all of our first six games, whilst scoring freely and showing a real attacking dominance. Despite the shortness of the league season, just 20 games, we had put ourselves in a very strong position to push for a possible title victory in our first year.\n\nThis update will cover the middle portion of the league season and a whole host of other news from the club and around the division.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTRANSFERS:\n\nFirstly was the news that, despite a very short league year, Grenada actually has a midseason transfer window! Who knew?! Anyway, there was not much in the way of talent out there for me to purchase but I did make some dealings.\n\n(Out)\n\nWe lost just one player, as 23 year old winger Cassim Bain signed a contract with First Division team Hilltop Ballers. Bain never played a game for us but that was mainly because he did not fit into our tactical system and he therefore drops down a division with his new club.\n\n(In)\n\nWe signed one player during this window, Ariel Charles (26), from fellow league rivals Hard Rock. The central midfielder had played seven games for his former club during the first part of this season and now joins us as a very solid rotational option in the middle of the park. He only agreed to a non-contract agreement but hopefully we can hold onto him and he should get a reasonable amount of game time.\n\nGFA Premier Division RESULTS:\n\nW = 4, D = 2, L = 2\n\nNot quite as sensational as our first month but still a very solid eight games of football.\n\nOur winning streak did come to an end at home to a very strong Hurricanes team where we were able to come away with a 1-1 draw. We followed this up with a pair of closely fought victories against St. John's Sports and then in a thriller against TAMCC.\n\nOur unbeaten run eventually came to an end when we fell to a very disappointing SAB Spartans team. We rebounded well from this disappointing loss, with a comfortable win against Super Strikers, followed by a tough drawn contest with QPR. We ended October with a remarkable 5-1 away victory over a very strong Hard Rock team, where there was a hattrick for youth forward Shavon Bishop. We then ended this run of games with our worst performance thus far, resulting in a terrible 2-0 defeat at home to Grenada Boys Secondary School.\n\nOverall, we maintained our decent attacking performances but struggled a bit more with regards to consistency, only managing the odd few games where we would score multiple goals. We did manage to net 16 goals in these eight fixtures though and defensively we did play okay but we definitely did not perform up to expectations, only managing to keep a single clean sheet and conceding 11 goals, at an average of more than one per game.\n\nPLAYER STATISTICS:\n\nOur slight dip in form has coincided with a small drop in the individual performances of our squad. We have still been playing very well though, and currently have 12 players with an average rating of at least 7.0.\n\nThe key man here continues to be Kimron Redhead (7.75). The experienced forward has been prolific in front of goal, netting 11 times in his 14 appearances this season. He has also played 25 key passes to go along with his five assists.\n\nIn defence our two fullbacks, Kimron Marshall (7.71) and Quinton Rennie (7.53) have both been excellent, with Marshall in particular impressing enroute to a team high 27 key passes played, whilst Rennie has connected on 20 total crosses, the most in the squad. Our central defenders have not been quite as brilliant, although Earldon McQueen (7.26) has played well and leads the team with 40 defensive interceptions. Nicko Williams (7.01) has also been solid and his 3.64 tackles/game are the highest amongst all defenders.\n\nOur midfielders have been very effective, especially the two teenagers, Earldon Millette (7.41) and Chad Mark (7.40). Millette has played 22 key passes and racked up five assists, whilst simultaneously averaging 2.30 tackles/game. Chad Mark has completed a very impressive 82% of his passes and also added four individual goals. The experienced Henson Cuffie (7.07) has helped to form a very effective trio in the centre of midfield, averaging a team-high 3.80 tackles/game.\n\nIn attack, young forward Uriah Enoe (7.35) has formed a solid partnership with Redhead up front, scoring six individual goals and providing a further six assists. In addition, teenage attacking midfielders David McQueen (6.97) and Kirani Noel (6.92) have both been solid. One name that has really impressed recently is Shavon Bishop (8.13), a new name that you will not have heard of but one who recently joined as part of our youth intake (more on that below). Bishop has been very good, scoring on debut before then netting a hattrick in his second appearance.\n\nLEAGUE TABLE:\n\nA couple of league defeats are enough to see us drop to second place, as we now fall a single point behind a very strong Hurricanes side. They have only lost one game themselves this year and it is looking likely that we are now locked in a two horse race with our rivals for the title. We only have six games left to play in the GFA Premier Division and still have to travel to our main rivals for a very tricky away fixture late in the season, making this title race a real exciting one!\n\nGrenada Boys Secondary School (GBSS) have been on a terrific run of form recently and, alongside Paradise, are mathematically still in with a chance at challenging for the title. Hard Rock, who were up there with the preseason favourites, have had an awful year and currently find themselves in 7th position, fighting off the threat of relegation. Speaking of the drop, there are six teams who still have a realistic chance of going down and it looks like that battle will also go down to the final day of the season.\n\nOur 38 goals scored and +24 goal difference is easily the best in the division. Defensively, despite a bit of a form dip, we have continued to be solid and our 14 goals conceded is tied for the least alongside rivals Hurricanes.\n\nOTHER NEWS:\n\nQuite a few bits of additional news to inform you of this update.\n\nInjuries:\n\nThe first month of the year had seen us remain relatively injury free, with very little in the way of major setbacks. The past coupe of months saw our already thin depth options et even thinner as we lost three players to lengthy ailments.\n\nFirstly we lost Nigel Modeste, a player capable of playing in attacking midfield or upfront, for two months after he broke a toe. The attacker had played seven games, scoring two goals, before his injury. We then lost young attacking midfielder David McQueen to a concussion before his replacement, youth academy product Kyle John-Brown, also went down with some pulled knee ligaments.\n\nWe are now struggling incredibly with depth options behind our starting front three and hopefully this does not affect us too much going forward.\n\nYouth Intake:\n\nSpeaking of some of the new players, October in Grenada sees the annual influx of youngsters in the form of the ever-exciting youth intake.\n\nWe have a pretty decent youth set up in terms of facility levels and therefore I was hoping for something a little bit better than this. Overall I was pretty disappointed with the current ability of this group, although there are a few players in here that could provide helpful for the first team. I signed the top two here along with the left back Reigh Millette and central defender Davier Ogilvie.\n\nThe main player here though is Kyle John-Brown, the young attacking midfielder who was lost to injury on his debut.\n\nHe is probably the most talented player in this intake and has a decent personality (resolute). He has a very solid set of physical attributes for this standard of football, with solid ratings for pace and acceleration. His mental attributes are pretty decent for a 16 year old and I am especially impressed with his levels for teamwork, vision and work rate. He should get plenty of playing time in the first eleven, at least after he has recovered from his injury.\n\nThe other player that I like the look of is forward Shavon Bishop.\n\nThe young striker has a less than ideal personality (unambitious) but still has high levels for determination. He also has a pretty solid set of physical attributes with good levels for pace, jumping reach and acceleration. Although his technical skills do not look that amazing, he has a well-rounded set of forward related traits; with reasonable finishing, heading, first touch and technique.\n\nBishop has already had a superb start to his Mount Rich career, netting four times in three appearances enroute to becoming the clubs youngest ever scorer, at 16 years and 121 days.\n\nManagerial Updates:\n\nI managed to also complete my first ever career coaching qualification, netting my National C Licence. It is important to gain a few of these as I go along in order to make sure that I am capable of landing jobs in the multiple countries that I intend on visiting.\n\nThese courses primarily help to boost my managerial attributes which, as you can see above, are severely lacking! I am going to have to get a lot of these numbers closer to double figures if I am ever going to be able to successfully apply for solid European positions.\n\nCup Draw:\n\nAlthough this story has primarily been focused on the Grenadian domestic league, there is also a cup competition that is due to get started in November, the Waggy-T Super Knockout Football Tournament.\n\nThe first round draw has already been completed and we are due to take on T.A. Marryshow Community College, a fellow GFA Premier Division side. Our opponents are having a fairly decent domestic campaign and find themselves in 6th position. We have only faced off against them once so far this year, defeating them in a thrilling 4-3 win at home.\n\nThis cup only has 16 teams competing in it, meaning just three wins will result in a finals appearance. We have managed to avoid any of the bigger teams in the opening round but this away fixture will no doubt be a tricky one to overcome.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat brings to a close another update from Grenada. We are still playing well in the domestic league but our overall consistency has become a bit more sporadic. The play of our forwards has been fairly pleasing although we have struggled a bit defensively as of late and I am thinking a tweak in tactics might be in order.\n\nWe only have six games left in the season but will now require a slip up from Hurricanes if we are to stand any chance of winning the title in my first season of management. I have decided that it might be a good idea to set myself the aim of winning at least one piece of silverware in each country before I move on to a different job. For now though, I am happy in Grenada, where games in October are played under 33 degree sunshine! Living the dream!\n\nUpdate 4: November & December 2017\n\nTeam: Mount Rich\n\nDivision: GFA Premier Division\n\nAs you may recall, the previous update saw us drop to second place in the league following some rather inconsistent form, especially with regards to our play in front of goal. Despite this we still had a realistic chance of securing a historic league title for the club in what was also my first job in football management.\n\nThis update, which spans two months, will cover the remaining GFA Premier Division fixtures and also see us embark on our domestic cup journey, in the Waggy-T Super Knockout Football Tournament.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGFA Premier Division RESULTS:\n\nW = 6, L = 0, D = 0\n\nA superb end of season run sees us go unbeaten through six games and you might notice that we also defeated our title rivals Hurricanes during this span. Considering we were just one point behind our rivals at the start of this update. The mathematicians amongst you will realise our form, in particular this vital victory, will have some big consequences in relation to the league table, but more on that later...\n\nWe kicked off this run of games with a nice away victory over a strong Paradise side, courtesy of a Shavon Bishop goal. We followed this with a high scoring triumph over relegation threatened Chantimelle before the important game against Hurricanes. In a closely fought battle, that saw only eight total shots (four for each team), we came away with a vital victory thanks to a superb strike from experienced forward Kimron Redhead. We then smashed a hapless St. John's Sports side, scoring five very good goals against them, before finishing the season with a pair of clean sheets against two sides at the foot of the division.\n\nOverall, I was extremely happy with our defensive improvements after our slight struggles during the past update. We kept four clean sheets and conceded just three goals in these six fixtures whilst also maintaining our attacking prowess, scoring 14 times.\n\nWaggy-T Super Knockout Football Tournament RESULTS:\n\nAlongside our league campaign, the month of November also saw the start (and completion) of Grenada's only domestic cup competition, the superbly named Waggy-T Super Knockout Football Tournament. As you may remember, we had drawn a fellow GFA Premier Division side in the opening round and, with just three knockout rounds separating us and a finals appearance, I was confident of adding some early silverware to my career.\n\nFirst Round: vs T.A. Marryshow Community College (GFA Premier Division)\n\nDespite being drawn as the away side, we put in a thoroughly professional performance and easily dispatched our league rivals with a comfortable 3-0 victory.\n\nWe totally dominated here from start to finish, racking up a very impressive 22 total shots. We took the lead just after the 20 minute mark when Kimron Redhead lashed home following a brilliant through ball from left fullback Kimron Marshall. We doubled our advantage just before the break when Uriah Enoe smashed home a strong finish from the edge of the area into the top corner of the net. Enoe added a second individual strike late on when he latched onto another brilliant pass from Marshall and placed a neat shot into the bottom corner.\n\nA fairly routine victory in the first round meant we cruised into the quarter finals where we were handed a very favourable draw.\n\nQuarter Final: vs Fontenoy United (GFA First Division)\n\nFontenoy United are a side who play their domestic football in the division below us and, given that we were also drawn as the home side, I felt very comfortable resting the majority of our first team players. This proved to be a very sensible decision as we cruised through thanks, primarily, to a brilliant first half performance.\n\nCentral defender Earldon McQueen rifled home following a poorly cleared corner to open the scoring after just ten minutes. Just a couple of minutes later and we doubled our advantage, when youth academy forward Shavon Bishop tucked home following a nice pass from back-up midfielder Alister Ettienne. We capped a superb first period when Kirani Greenidge smashed home from inside the area after a nice knockdown header from strike partner Bishop.\n\nWe never looked like conceding in this one, limiting our opponents to just 41% possession and just a single shot at goal. This win meant we cruised through to the semifinal where we were handed a potentially tricky draw.\n\nSemi Final: vs Paradise Sports Club (GFA Premier Division)\n\nThe semi final stage saw us drawn against Paradise Sports Club, the competitions reigning holders and most successful side, having won the tournament on a record four previous occasions. Having to travel away added another tricky element to this tie but luckily we were able to come away with an important victory.\n\nWe took the lead after just three minutes when central midfielder Earldon Millette cracked home a fine strike from the edge of the area and from there on in we slightly edged a rather nervously played out match. Both sides struggled to create any clearcut chances, as we managed just four shots on target for the whole game. Still, this was better than our opponents who genuinely failed to hit the target for the entire 90 minutes, having just five, off-target, shots in total.\n\nA fine win and one that meant we would be playing in the cup final during my first ever season in Grenada.\n\nFinal: vs Chantimelle FC (GFA Premier Division)\n\nWhat an amazing way to win our first trophy!\n\nWe ended up playing Chantimelle FC in the final following the relegation-threatened sides solid cup run but they were no real challenge for our clinical finishing. This game was played in the national team stadium, in front of a rather hefty crowd of 1,548 spectators.\n\nThe highlight here was a superb, first half hattrick, from Uriah Enoe. The young forward scored a header, a close range finish and then rifled home a penalty to ensure that we were leading 5-0 at halftime in what turned out to be a very one sided affair. There was also a double from central defender Nicko Williams, who scored following both a corner and a free kick. The other two goals came from young midfielder Chad Mark, who slammed home a close range header, and substitute Shavon Bishop, who tucked home a neat finish late on.\n\nWe completed a cup run that saw us conceded zero goals by limiting our opponents to just two total shots in the final.\n\nPLAYER STATISTICS:\n\nOur excellent end of season form was the result of some excellent individual performances through the final two months. We ended the year with an impressive 15 players holding an average rating of at least 7.0.\n\nThe star man here was left fullback Kimron Marshall (7.80), who finishes the season with one of the highest ratings I have seen for a full FM season. The 24 year old racked up 8 assists and a ridiculously good 42 key passes from his defensive position as he became a real force going forward. He was not bad at the defensive end either, averaging 3.63 tackles/game and 28 interceptions.\n\nElsewhere at the back, fellow fullback Quinton Rennie (7.50) had a very good year, adding six assists of his own and connecting on a team-high 36 chances. Central defenders Earldon McQueen (7.47) and Nicko Williams (7.30) both had very solid years, with McQueen leading the way with 68 defensive interceptions and Williams being successful with 94% of his tackles. Young goalkeeper Kuan Williams (7.01) improved his play in the second half of the year and finished with just 17 goals conceded in 24 games.\n\nIn midfield, the key man was teenager Earldon Millette (7.63). The youngster, who won his first senior national team cap this season, scored 4 goals, collected six assists and led the team with 43 key passes played. Alongside him, fellow teenager Chad Mark (7.32) had a good year, scoring five individual goals of his own whilst Henson Cuffie (7.02) played well in his ball winning role, averaging 4.26 tackles/game. Ariel Charles (7.10) who joined midseason proved to be a very solid rotational option.\n\nUp front, Kimron Redhead (7.55) finished the season as the clubs top scorer with 15 goals in his 23 appearances. He added a further 6 assist and led the team with 4 Player of the Match Awards won. His strike partner Uriah Enoe (7.35) was also pretty prolific, adding 12 goals of his own and leading the squad with 7 assists. Youth academy attacking midfielder Kyle John-Brown (7.30) looked very good in limited action whilst David McQueen (6.94) outplayed fellow youngster Kirani Noel (6.88).\n\nSTANDINGS:\n\nAs you may have guessed, we ended up easily being crowned league champions! Our main rivals, Hurricanes, had an awful end to the year, losing three of their final six fixtures and actually ended up finishing 3rd, below Grenada Boys Secondary School.\n\nParadise Sports Club finished fairly strongly and ended up placing 4th whilst preseason favourites Hard Rock stumbled their way to 6th, just seven points clear of relegation. Speaking of the drop, Waggy-T Super Knockout finalists Chantimelle finish bottom and are relegated to the First Division along with SAB Spartans and Super Strikers,\n\nIn fairness we definitely deserved this league title, our 52 league goals scored and +35 goal difference was easily the best in the division. Amazingly, Hurricanes actually conceded less goals than us over the course of the entire year but, with just 17 goals let in, we averaged less than one goal conceded per game.\n\nSome really emphatic wins in there, with plenty of games finishing with us scoring 4+ goals. We were just so good going forward and managed to maintain this attacking ability through all 20 league games, resulting in a much deserved league crown during my first season in management.\n\nOTHER NEWS:\n\nNot much in the way of other news, just some little bits and pieces from around the club to be aware of.\n\nInternational News:\n\nThe excellent domestic form of left fullback Kimron Marshall led to the defender receiving his first call-up for the senior national side. Quinton Rennie now has seven caps for his country whilst young forward Uriah Enoe scored his first international goal in a friendly against Martinique.\n\nHall of Fame:\n\nHaving won both of the domestic competitions in Grenada, the GFA Premier Division and the Waggy-T Super Knockout Football Tournament, I collected my first Managerial Hall of Fame points.\n\nThese two trophies became the most reputable bits of silverware won by Mount Rich, having previously only won the Grenadian First Division. Unfortunately for me, the Grenadian domestic set-up is not the most reputable and therefore my double trophy success resulted in just 23 Hall of Fame points. Still, a start is a start and now I have to decide whether to stay in the Caribbean or look for a job elsewhere.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat brings to a close my first season in Grenada and what a successful year it has been, collecting two trophies and playing some very exciting, attacking football. The option to remain in Grenada still remains but I do feel as though I have achieved everything possible on this tiny island and therefore it might be time to look for a new job possibly.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggests for where they would like to see me manage next or would you guys prefer me to carry on in Grenada for a bit?\n\nUpdate 5: End of Season Review (2017)\n\nClub: Mount Rich\n\nDivision: GFA Premier Division\n\nI started out my managerial career at a small, semi-professional club, located on the Caribbean island of Grenada. Despite no previous experience, I was hired and went on to lead the club to a historic season in which we were crowned league and cup champions! We exceeded all expectations, considering the media expected us to finish near the foot of the table, and finished the year collecting the clubs' first ever meaningful silverwares.\n\nThis update will take a quick look back at our record setting season and act as a platform for the clubs end of season awards.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCOMPETITIONS:\n\nGFA Premier Division. Final League Position: 1st\n\nPlayed: 20 (W = 16, D = 2, L = 2)\n\nGoals Scored: 52, Goals Conceded: 17, Goal Difference: +35\n\nPoints Total: 50\n\nA superb first year in Grenada saw us finish as league champions in my inaugural season as a football manager. Despite being tipped for relegation by the media and having a fairly low-standing board expectation we managed to play well beyond those suggestions and cruised to top position. Our clinical finishing was one of the most important aspects of this excellent year, with our 52 goals scored (close to 3 per game) and our +35 goal difference easily the best attacking figures in the division.\n\nIn fact we only dropped 10 points all year, so we were not that far off having that elusive 'perfect-season'. In the end our closest title rivals, Hurricanes, fell away during the leagues' final few months despite briefly overtaking us into top position around the midday point of the year. Grenada Boys Secondary School, the team only permitted to field players under the age of 20, ended up placing second following some excellent end of season form. Preseason favourites Paradise Sports Club (4th) and Hard Rock (6th) both had disappointing years by their standards. Domestic cup finalists Chantimelle did not have the best of league seasons, finishing bottom and are therefore relegated along with Super Strikers and SAB Spartans.\n\nWaggy-T Super Knockout Football Tournament. Final Position: Winners\n\nPlayed: 4 (W = 4, D = 0, L = 0)\n\nGoals Scored: 14, Goals Conceded: 0, Goal Difference: +14\n\nI could not have asked for anything more during our cup run this season as we cruised to victory in the Waggy-T Super Knockout following four flawless games where we did not concede a single goal.\n\nIn the first round we overcame fellow GFA Premier Division side, easily beating T.A. Marryshow Community College in an away game. The second round saw us handed a very favourable draw as we came up against First Division team Fontenoy United and we recorded a second 3-0 win of the competition to progress to the semi-finals.\n\nThis was where our toughest game came, as we had to play the reputable Paradise Sports Club in an away fixture. We ended up playing really well and an early Earldon Millette strike sent us trough to the final. In the last game we were drawn against the relegated Chantimelle and played our best game of the season, recording an emphatic 7-0 victory to gift us the league and domestic double!\n\nPLAYER STATISTICS:\n\nWe finished the season with a whopping 15 players holding an average rating of 7.0 or higher, a pretty impressive feat given that we only played 20 league games. Below are some key stats from our historic Grenadian campaign:\n\nKimron Redhead finished as the clubs top scorer, netting 15 times throughout the course of the season. Two other players managed to reach a double digit goal tally with Uriah Enoe netting 12 times and youth academy product Shavon Bishop reading 10 goals in just 12 appearances.\n\nThe leading assist provider this season was left fullback Kimron Marshall, who tallied 8 in total. Forward Uriah Enoe finished second, collecting 7 assists, whilst three other players, Earldon Millette, Kimron Redhead and Quinton Rennie, all reached 6 assists.\n\nForward Kimron Redhead ended the season with the most Player of the Match Awards, picking up 4. Left fullback Kimron Marshall finished with 3 awards.\n\nDefensive midfielder Henson Cuffie led the team with an impressive average of 4.26 tackles/game in his 22 appearances. Central defender Earldon McQueen led the way with 68 defensive interceptions.\n\nAll-time Best XI:\n\nGiven that the Grenadian leagues do not have that much in the way of history, it is unsurprising to see that the Mount Rich all-time best XI is made up exclusively of players who played for us this season.\n\nMost of these selections were filly straightforward but it was interesting to see David McQueen and youngster Shavon Bishop named in the starting team ahead of Uriah Enoe, who is named as a substitute.\n\nPLAYER AWARDS:\n\n1) Player of the Year: Kimron Marshall (LB) - 18 matches, 8 assists, 42 key passes, 23 crosses connected, 3.63 tackles/game, 3 PoM Awards, Ave Rating: 7.80\n\nSigned on a free transfer at the start of the season, left fullback Kimron Marshall really played well and ended the year with one of the highest average ratings I have ever had on FM. The 24 year old was a solid defensive performer but where he really impressed was on the attacking front, tallying eight assists and a very impressive 42 key passes played.\n\nThis was pretty surprising given his relatively poor technical attributes but what I like the most about Marshall though is his impressive physical traits, with high levels for pace, acceleration, stamina and strength. The defender is under contract for the next couple of seasons and should be a mainstay in the starting eleven for many season to come.\n\n2) Defensive Player of the Year: Quinton Rennie (RB) - 20 matches, 6 assists, 28 key passes, 36 crosses connected, 2.90 tackles/game, Ave Rating: 7.50\n\nAnother free signing at the start of the season, Quinton Rennie provided a solid option opposite Marshall in defence. The 27 year old, who has made seven senior appearances for the national team, connected on a team-high 36 crosses throughout the season as he provided another attacking option from the fullback position. He was also pretty decent on the defensive front but it was in attack that Rennie impressed the most.\n\nAgain, this was a surprise given the relatively poor level of technical skills but Rennie also has some pretty solid physical attributes for this level of football, with good levels for pace, acceleration, agility and stamina.\n\n3) Midfield Player of the Year: Earldon Millette (CM) - 19 matches, 4 goals, 6 assists, 43 key passes, 2.61 tackles/game, 25 interceptions, Ave Rating: 7.63\n\nOf all our sold midfielders, the standout performer was without a doubt Earldon Millette. The 19 year old had an exceptional year and actually won his first caps for the Grenada senior national side during the season. He was an exceptional all around presence, proving a threat with the ball at his feet enroute to completing a team high 43 key passes whilst also being solid in defence, averaging 2.61 tackles/game and collecting 25 defensive interceptions.\n\nThe youngster again has a solid set of physical attributes, which seems to be a running theme with my successful players in this league. He also has some reasonable mental attributes given his age and his technical traits, although not amazing, are pretty good for this standard. The youngster actually did receive some interest from a few Grenadian teams throughout the season but I managed to tie him up to a longer term contract.\n\n4) Attacking Player of the Year: Kimron Redhead (ST) - 23 matches, 15 goals, 6 assists, 40 key passes, 4 PoM Awards, Ave Rating: 7.55\n\nOur top scorer from this season was the 35 year old attacker Kimron Redhead. The veteran is capable of playing in midfield or just behind the main strikers but I almost exclusively utilised him as an out and out forward during this season, a decision that proved to be a very god one as Redhead rewarded me with 15 goals scored in just 23 appearances.\n\nDespite his age, the experienced forward still has a very good set of physical attributes, including good ratings for pace, acceleration and stamina. He has a good rating for finishing and first touch to go alongside a very solid set of mental traits. It will be interesting to see whether Redhead regresses much given his advancing years but, for now at least, he is one of the better players at the club.\n\n5) U21 Player of the Year Award: Shavon Bishop (ST) - 12 matches, 10 goals, 2 assists, 1.44 dribbles/game, Ave Rating: 7.70\n\nDespite only playing 12 times for the club, having joined from the youth academy midway through the year, Shavon Bishop proved to be a revelation in front of goal. The 16 year old netted 10 times for the club as he highlighted his keen eye for goal through his limited playing time.\n\nDespite his age he has a very good set of physical skills and his technical traits are pretty well rounded, with solid numbers for finishing, first touch and heading. He has a very high level of determination despite having a less than favourable personality. I am hoping to see more from the teenager as the seasons progress.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nOverall, this has been a very enjoyable first season in Grenada and we have been extremely successful, completing an inaugural league and domestic cup double. All the new signings that we brought in have played excellently and we proved to be a real attacking force, scoring goals for fun in all competitions.\n\nAs previously mentioned, our trophy wins gave manager James Yates his first ever Managerial Hall of Fame Points, albeit not that many, as it added 23. I was planning on departing Grenada following this season, given that I have won everything possible in the country, however this recent piece of news just landing in my email inbox\n\nI will look into the clubs we are playing in more detail during the preseason update but for now I just thought it would be worth noting that, as GFA Premier Division champions, we are permitted to take part in the CFU Champions Cup (essentially the Caribbean version of the Champions League). Given that this tournament runs so early in the calendar year I think I should at least give that a go before deciding whether or not to move on to a different club, especial given that the winner of this competition then qualifies for the CONCACAF Champions League!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hope everyone is still enjoying this story so far. I am very much looking forward to playing in the CFU Champions Cup and the idea of getting a Grenadian team into the CONCACAF Champions League is one that, although entirely unrealistic, is actually pretty motivating!\n\nI will be back with a preseason update soon, detailing the opposition that we face off against in Group F of the Champions Cup this coming season.\n\nI am very pleased that so many of you appear to be enjoying this little Caribbean adventure. It has been very fun to play through thus far and we had an extremely successful first season, picking up a domestic league and cup double - the first top tier trophies in the clubs history. These bits of silverware also added the first ever Managerial Hall of Fame points of my short career.\n\nBefore we get stuck into the new season I want to post a short update welcoming everyone back to Grenada and, more specifically, Mount Rich.\n\nClub Background:\n\nPrior to my hiring, Mount Rich were a club who had never won any silverware in the top division of Grenada. The small, semi-professional club can be found in the northeastern corner of the island, based in the town of Morne Fendue. They were formed in 1986 and had previously won the Grenadian First Division on two separate occasions but last years success in the GFA Premier Division and the Waggy-T Super Knockout was the clubs first major trophy wins in their history.\n\nThe exceptional domestic season led to an obvious increase in reputation, where we still are recognised nationally but now hold a full star rating.\n\nFacilities:\n\nOr facilities are almost identical to last year, with just a single improvement recently being approved.\n\nOur youth set-up is actually pretty decent. We already have a well established youth recruitment and this upgrade means we now have an average junior coaching. Our youth intake last season was actually fairly good but I am hoping this improvement might see some even better players coming through.\n\nIn terms of other facilities, our home games are played at the 700 capacity Plains Playing Field, a grass based, council owned arena that we struggled to barely fill last year. Our training facilities and youth facilities are not spectacular, sitting at a basic level.\n\nCompetitions:\n\nThis coming season is an exciting one as it sees us enter a third competition and it is these competitions, ones that I have no prior experience or knowledge of, that made me want to attempt this type of save.\n\nThe main domestic league of Grenada is the GFA Premier Division. The top tier of Grenadian football is slightly different this year in that it has been reduced to just 10 teams, meaning that the season is even shorter, with just 18 league games. The top side, and the one finishing second, qualify for the CFU Champions Cup, whilst the bottom two sides are automatically relegated, with the side finishing 8th entering into a relegation playoff.\n\nOur first ever top domestic title means we are the reigning holders of the league going into this season. Hard Rock FC are the countries most dominate domestic side, having won the league title a record four times but last season was a big shock with not only ourselves winning but with Grenada Boys Secondary School coming in second.\n\nThis year, the media are predicting us to be up there and challenging for a defence of our title. The two newly promoted sides, Ball Dogs and Happy Hill, both look pretty strong on paper and will be attempting to avoid relegation this season. The league looks like it will be extremely competitive this season, which a number of teams likely challenging for the top spot.\n\nThe second competition that we will be participating in is the Waggy-T Super Knockout Football Tournament, the only domestic cup competition in Grenada. This tournament consists of just three rounds, played over a single leg, prior to a final with just 16 total teams competing.\n\nAs you may recall, we are the current holders of the cup competition having smashed Chantimelle 7-0 in the final last year. Paradise Sports Club have been the most successful side in this competition over the past five seasons and have actually won the trophy on a record four separate occasions.\n\nThe final tournament that we will be participating in is the CFU Champions Cup, essentially the Caribbean champions league. For starters, this tournament is massive! There are 64 teams competing this season, in 16 different groups. The teams taking part are from a multitude of different Caribbean nations and the group draw itself has already been made\n\nWe were drawn in Group F alongside Fruta Conquerors, North East Stars and Royal Montserrat Police Force.\n\nThe easiest side in this group is likely Royal Montserrat Police Force. They are only an amateur team and are predominantly filled with greyed out players but have won the Montserrat Championship on a record five occasions.\n\nThe team that are probably the most similar to ours is Fruta Conquerors. The semi-professional outfit finished runners up in the Guyanese top division last season and appear to have a squad similar in strength to ourselves. They have some very talented players and are led by forward Anthony Abrams, who has won 54 caps for his native Guyana.\n\nThe final team that we will be up against are easily the most challenging. North East Stars won the domestic crown in Trinidad & Tobago last season, a competition that is ranked the 9th most reputable league in North America. Their squad is made up almost entirely of native players but they are all very talented and this will be a very tough fixture for us.\n\nWe only play each team once and have to finish atop the group if we wish to progress to the next round. Given the extremely tough draw we have received, it is looking like that will be a very difficult task, but you never know when it comes to continental football, stranger things have happened.\n\nGrenadian Football:\n\nAs we have previously discussed, the domestic side of football in Grenada is relatively poor, with an entirely semi-professional league system and a very short running season. The GFA Premier Division is currently ranked as the 35th most reputable league in North America (below the second domestic tier of Guatemala) but the FA try to make up for things by having the best named cup competition that I have ever participated in.\n\nAndrew Munroe continues to manage the national side but there has not been much in the way of senior fixtures, with last year consisting entirely of friendlies. They have improved there ranking ever so slightly and at 148 in the world. I think this season will see them participate in the CFU Caribbean Cup and hopefully my players; Uriah Enoe, Earldon Millette, Chad Mark, Quinton Rennie and Kimron Marshall will get to experience that competition.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo that ends our re-introduction to life at Mount Rich in Grenada. The CFU Champions Cup takes place in March so I will hopefully have an update, detailing our performance in that, ready to post very soon.\n\nI obviously do not want to spend my entire career in Grenada, especially as I have already won all the domestic trophies possible in the country, but I think it would be fun to stay for at least one more season and get to experience the Champions Cup whilst also maybe attempting to defend my league crown. What do you guys think? I could look for another job in the Caribbean? Or I could go further afield?\n\nUpdate 6: February & March 2018\n\nClub: Mount Rich\n\nDivision: GFA Premier Division\n\nSo, as you may recall, we had successfully qualified for the CFU Champions Cup having won the Grenadian league title last season. The domestic league preseason does not start until July (as does the next transfer window) but with Champions Cup running throughout March, I am going to be posting an update for that prior to entering into talk about transfers and tactical updates.\n\nThis obviously means that we will be utilising the same squad from last season in the Champions Cup, a tournament that has a ludicrous 64 teams competing across 16 groups in the first round.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFriendly RESULTS:\n\nW = 2, D = 1, L = 2\n\nPrior to the start of the CFU Champions Cup, we were able to arrange some friendly fixtures as a way of ensuring that our fitness was at an appropriate level going into the competitive games.\n\nI was not too fussed about the results here, given that the focus was to make sure that the squad was match fit and ready for the tournament, but we did actually have some good performances against some fairly strong opposition. We only played one game against Grenadian opposition, comfortably beating Grenada Boys Secondary School in an away fixture. The other four games saw us face off against opponents from the various division of Trinidad & Tobago. Given that most of these sides were stronger than us in terms of player talent, I was very happy with our performances, especially with the 4-2 victory over Defence Force SL.\n\nWe failed to score in the opening game but then showed our attacking prowess by netting 10 times in our next four fixtures. Defensively we were not as solid as I would have liked, conceding nine times in these five games, and that is something that will definitely need to improve come tournament time. Speaking of...\n\nCFU Champions Cup RESULTS:\n\nThe Caribbean Football Union Champions Cup is essentially a Champions League style event run for the teams of the various Caribbean nations. The first round, which consists of 64 teams across a whopping 16 groups, sees the group winner advancing to a Final Stage (4 groups of 4 teams) and the chance to then progress to the semi-finals.\n\nAs you may remember we had been handed a pretty difficult group draw, having to play fixtures against Royal Montserrat Police Force (Montserrat), Fruta Conquerors (Guyana) and North East Stars (Trinidad & Tobago).\n\nGame 1. CFU Champions Cup Group F: vs Royal Montserrat Police Force (Montserrat)\n\nWe kicked off our tournament with a game against Royal Montserrat Police Force, the one team that I expected us to dominate in our group. All fixtures for this tournament are played in neutral venues and this particular one was held in The Bahamas.\n\nWe dominated the first half and grab two goals within the first half an hour, firstly from youth academy defender Davier Ogilvie heading home following a flick-on from a corner and then from Uriah Enoe, who slotted home a neat finish from near the edge of the area. We kept the ball well, owning 60% of the possession, but let our opponents score a last minute consolation which put a slight dampener on the win given that goal difference can be very important in tournaments such as these.\n\nKyle John-Brown, our young attacking midfielder, was awarded Player of the Match following a dominate performance behind the front two strikers. All in all this was an efficient performance and one that put us in a good position going into our final two games.\n\nGame 2. CFU Champions Cup Group F: vs North East Stars (Trinidad & Tobago)\n\nWe made the trip from The Bahamas to Mexico for this game against North East Stars, from the top domestic division of Trinidad & Tobago. This was our toughest game on paper but we played so much better than I thought we would.\n\nWe again controlled the game, dominating possession with 59% of the ball, but we struggled to create chances, managing just 10 shots with only three on target. The best chance of the game fell to midfielder Chad Mark who rattled the crossbar with a rising shot from inside the area midway through the first period. We again defended pretty well though and limited our much stronger opponents to just four total shots.\n\nThis was not a brilliant game for the neutrals but one that meant our chances of qualifying were well and truly alive going into our final fixture.\n\nGame 3. CFU Champions Cup Group F: vs Fruta Conquerors (Guyana)\n\nWe left Mexico and travelled to Curacao to take on our final group opponents, the Guyanese league champions, Fruta Conquerors.\n\nConsidering the last fixture was the most boring of games, this matchup proved to be the complete opposite! After a scoreless first half, one where we created chances but showed a lack of clinical finishing, things really spurred into life in the second period. We took the lead just before the hour mark when Shavon Bishop slotted home a nice finish but our advantage lasted just two minutes as our opponents managed to score with their first shot at goal.\n\nThe next piece of action saw Fruta Conquerors reduced to ten men as one of their midfielders picked up a second yellow card. We instantly made our numerical advantage count as Bishop netted his second of the game following a close range finish from a superb cross. Uriah Enoe than got himself on the scoresheet, tucking home a controlled close range volley in the 73rd minute to extend our lead further.\n\nWe again showed an inability to concentrate directly after scoring as we allowed our Guyanese opponents to again score, from just their second effort of the game. There was still time for Enoe to add his second, and a fourth goal for our team, in the dying minutes as he slotted home following a nice pass from Chad Mark.\n\nI was so surprised with how easily we dominated this game, having 20 shots to our opponents two, but I was very disappointed that we did not manage to keep a clean sheet. Still, this meant we racked up 7 points from our three fixtures and meant we would have to see how the other fixtures in the group played out before knowing whether it was enough to progress to the next round.\n\nPLAYER STATISTICS:\n\nWe played pretty well during these three groups fixtures and had six players who averaged an individual rating of at least 7.0.\n\nThe standout here was young forward Uriah Enoe (7.43), who netted 3 goals in his three appearances and picked up a Player of the Match Award in the final game.\n\nElsewhere, Shavon Bishop (7.40) put in some good performances, bagging a double in the final game. Young attacking midfielder Kyle John-Brown (7.30) played excellently behind the from two, leading the way with 7 key passes played. Defensively, fullback Quniton Rennie (7.13) and experienced centra defender Nicko Williams (7.10) also had some good performances, with the later completing 100% of his attempted tackles.\n\nSTANDINGS:\n\nUhh! Goal difference!\n\nWe finish the group stage with an identical record to North East Stars but they smashed Royal Montserrat Police Force in the final game by a 6-0 scoreline to ensure their goal difference was way higher than our own. Unfortunately, with just one team going through, this means we miss out on progression with our Trinidad & Tobago rivals heading into the next round.\n\nWe played really well throughout these six games but probably should have beaten the Police by a bigger scoreline in our opener or, if we had just managed to sneak one goal against North East Stars ourselves, then we may have been progressing in their place.\n\nElsewhere there was one other Grenadian team in the tournament:\n\nGrenada Boys Secondary School also failed to make it through their group, losing out to Robin Hood from Bermuda. This group was way easier than our own and I would have definitely backed us to have gone through had we been in their position.\n\nTo give you some indication of how tough our group was, this happened:\n\nIn an absolute thriller of a final, North East Stars, managed to win the entire tournament, beating Arnett Gardens of Jamaica, and win themselves a place in the next edition of the CONCACAF Champions League. If we had been placed in an easier group I definitely think I may have had a chance at progressing further but I guess that is what makes these sorts of tournaments so unpredictable.\n\nOTHER NEWS:\n\nInjuries:\n\nFirstly we lost Earldon Millette during the very first friendly game. He went on to miss the entire friendly schedule and although he returned in time for the Champiosn Cup fixtures he was horribly shy of match sharpness and did not have a very big impact in any of the group games.\n\nThese two injuries were even more costly as they ruled both players out for the duration of the Champions Cup. the biggest loss here was that of last seasons Player of the Year, Kimron Marshall. The left fullback twisted an ankle during a friendly game he was sorely missed during our group games, especially given that we have a severe lack of depth at fullback behind the two starters.\n\nWe also lost young attacking midfielder Kirani Noel to another twisted ankle, this one suffered from kicking a ball... Luckily Kyle John-Brown has been playing well in Noel's position the season so this was not so big a blow.\n\nInternational:\n\nThe highest number of call-ups thus far as 10 of our players were selected in the two Grenada squads.\n\nFirstly, the impressive Kyle John-Brown was joined by forward Shavon Bishop, goalkeeper Kuan Williams and central defender Davier Ogilvie in the U20 squad. Both John-Brown and Ogilvie went on to make their national team debuts during a victory over the Cayman Islands.\n\nYoungsters Chad Mark, Uriah Enoe and Earldon Millette were joined in the senior national squad by central defender Nicko Williams and fullbacks Quinton Rennie and Kimron Marshall, with leftback Marshall getting his first ever call-up. He ending up making his debut during the CFU Caribbean Cup, whilst Rennie has become entrenched as the countries starting rightback, racking up 11 senior appearances thus far.\n\nSquad News:\n\nOne bit of news from the squad was the information that last seasons top scorer, Kimron Redhead, has planned to retire from playing at the end of this coming season. The experienced veteran is the clubs oldest ever scorer and was a key component of our attacking success last year. I could have attempted to talk him out of it but his skills are declining and it will be nice for him to go out on top.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo that concludes our CFU Champions Cup journey with Mount Rich for this season. We played pretty well, probably well enough to progress from most of the other groups, and incidentally finished below the side that then went onto win the whole tournament. I would love to have gotten further in this tournament, the idea of trying to get a Grenadian side into the CONCACAF Champions League is a very enticing one but one that I think would require me to stay at the club for many, many more seasons.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you want me to stay at Mount Rich and attempt to develop the club or would you like to see me move to another country/league and win some more silverware elsewhere?\n\nUpdate 7: Preseason 2018\n\nTeam: Mount Rich\n\nDivision: GFA Premier Division\n\nHaving failed to progress beyond the groups stages of the CFU Champions Cup, we had a fe months off before the domestic league season kicked off in July. In that time the transfer window opened, resulting in us making some additions, whilst we also managed to play through a full slate of friendly games.\n\nThis update, although occurring after our first competitive games of the year, will cover all the preseason goings on before we begin the defence of our GFA Premier Division title!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOARD ROOM:\n\nOur successful league campaign last year resulted in a pretty significant prize fund, meaning our overall bank balance sits at around £80,000 (way up from the £15,000 we had last year). This extra cash has seen the chairman willing to increase the amounts available for both the wage and transfer budgets.\n\nAs you can see, despite the extra money available I am still spending way below what I am allowed, with almost £600pw of the current wage bill unused. That is mainly because I am able to sign the majority of players I want on small, part-time contracts or even on a non-contract basis. The board even provided me with a transfer budget for the first time, not that I plan on using it, but it is a good sign that financial we are heading in the right direction.\n\nIn addition to the monetary side, the board also made me aware of their objectives for the upcoming season:\n\nBoard Objectives (2018)\n\nGFA Premier Division - Win the GFA Premier Division\n\nWaggy-T Super Knockout Football Tournament - Reach Final\n\nWell, our board have definitely changed their tune over the course of a single season! Last year they simple wanted me to avoid relegation but now, having totally exceeded everyones expectations in my first season, they want me to win the league and reach the cup final at a minimum.\n\nI am fairly confident that we will be there, or there about, come the end of the year but this adds a little bit of pressure this season that I was not expecting.\n\nCLUB STAFF:\n\nNot too many new faces here but, again, my backroom is made up of a fairly assorted bunch of people from various Caribbean islands.\n\nThe majority of my staff return following last season but one replacement was made with the goalkeeping coach position. We signed Jahvan Mason, from St. Vincent & The Grenadines, and he instantly helps to improve the weakest area of our coaching department from last year. We signed two more additional coaches in the form Jolanshoy George, who joins the club as the U20s fitness coach and then in Ricardo London, a very talented general coach who teams up with the senior squad.\n\nTRANSFERS:\n\n(Out)\n\nNot much happening on the out transfer front but we did lose two players, both of whom were on non-contract agreements and therefore chose to leave when approached by other clubs.\n\nJake Marshall (27) was a back-up central defender who appeared sporadically for us last season, playing in 8 games an averaging a rating of 6.74. Nigel Modeste (23) was also a backup, one capable of playing in an attacking midfielder or forward role. He again did not see too much playing time, totalling just 8 appearances and scoring two goals. He choose to leave and join newly promoted side Happy Hill, so we will likely see him again at some point this season.\n\n(In)\n\nDespite only losing two players I decided to use this window to improve the overall depth available at the club, something that was severely lacking last season.\n\nFirstly I signed a pair of backup fullbacks in Kimron Belfon (18) and Nicko Budd (24). Behind talented starters Kimron Marshall and Quinton Rennie we literally had nothing at either fullback position so I made it a priority to find someone capable of playing should either of our two stars get injured or need a rest.\n\nI also signed another body who can play in the centre of midfield, Dwayne Leo (36). The experienced Grenadian has played 20 times for the senior national side and, despite his age, should provide a decent rotational option for the season. One area of the team where we were very weak last year was in goal and so I added another keeper to provide some competition for youngster Kuan Williams. Desmond Noel (43) might just be the oldest player I have ever managed on FM but he has still got some playing years left in him, having appeared in all 20 league games last year for division foe, Queens Park Rangers.\n\nCentral defence was another area I wanted to strengthen and so I added Christon Noel (23) from recently relegated Chantimelle. He was probably the best player at his previous club and should see a fair amount of action this season in the middle of the defence. I also added another option upfront in the form of Quintana Ogilvie (32). The veteran forward previously played for Paradise Sports Club, for whom he scored five league goals last season.\n\nOne of the most interesting signings of this window however is that of Christ Kisangala (21).\n\nThe first thing you might notice about the big central defender is that he is not from Grenada! The youngster, who is from Democratic Republic of Congo, will become the first foreign player to ever appear for Mount Rich. Indeed he will be the only overseas player to play in the top division as ever other squad is made up entirely of Grenadian nationals.\n\nI have no idea how my scout found this guy, but he did just after Kisangala was released from TP Mazembe who play in the top DR Congo domestic division. He is not even that talented, I just wanted to show off the first non-Grenadian player of this save. He does have some good physicals though, with high pace, acceleration and jumping reach, and therefore I am hoping he can have an impact at this level.\n\nThe most exciting signing of this window though was that of another forward, Shaddai Sampson (17).\n\nI had to make Sampson the highest paid player at the club in order to get him to sign but just look at those attributes... definitely worth it.\n\nThe teenager was a product of Chantimelle's youth intake last season and ended up scoring twice for the relegated side in just five appearances. He has an outstanding level of finishing and first touch for this level, to go along with good pace, acceleration and balance. To be honest, I did not really need another forward but this guy was simply too good to pass up on.\n\nAs you can see, despite only being a professional footballer for half a year, he has already made his debut for the senior national side, totalling bypassing the U20 squad and he has the potential to become not only one of the best players for this club, but one of the best ever for his country should he develop nicely.\n\nTHE SQUAD:\n\nHere is an overview of the entire squad, minus some decent youth players, for the upcoming season.\n\nAs you can see, the main thing here is that we have far more depth than we did last year. Every position now has a reasonable back-up option and some either have multiple rotational options.\n\nUnsurprisingly, my assistant agrees that young forwards Shaddai Sampson (17) and Uriah Enoe (20) have the potential to form a devastating partnership upfront whilst last years youth intake product, attacking midfielder Kyle John-Brown (17), looks the real deal as well - creating a very young trio of offensive weapons. The three excellent central midfielders from last year, Chad Mark (20), Earldon Millette (19) and Henson Cuffie (30), all return and provide some stability in the midfield.\n\nDefensively, new signings Christ Kinsagala (21) and Christon Noel (23) look most likely to partner star man Nicko Williams (28) in the centre of defence whilst talented fullbacks Kimron Marshall (25) and Quinton Rennie (28) look ready to man the wing positions.\n\nOverall, I am much happier with this squad than I was last year. We have some very solid defensive options and have actually managed to upgrade in a few areas, including at the goalkeeper position where ageing veteran Desmond Noel (43) is set to start the season opener. We managed to stay relatively free of injury last year, something which I would very much like to see happen again, but if it does not I feel much more prepared given our improved depth this time around.\n\nTACTICS:\n\nAn almost identical tactic to last year here as we role with a 4-3-1-2 style.\n\nAgain, the fullbacks will both be placed on an attacking role in order to ensure that they provide a wide option when we are in possession. The midfield trio performed excellently last year but I may have to ask them to do slightly more defensive work if we get caught with our fullbacks too high up the pitch. I played the man behind the forwards as a shadow striker last year but that never turned out to be very effectively. I am hoping that an advanced playmaker should be able to pick out one of our two star forwards, who will both be set as poachers, when in possession.\n\nAs usual, I will primarily play on a control mentality but with a fluid team shape, used to ensure that the midfielders do their fair share of the defensive duties. Again I will be utilising individual instruction for all players and the following team instructions: pass into space, work ball into box, look for overlap, play narrower and roam from positions.\n\nThese all feed into my philosophy which is that I want to give my forwards as many chances as possible do score in and around the area. We have the option to play it wide for the fullbacks, who are under instructions to cross early and often OR we work it short through the middle using two of our central midfielders and our attacking midfielder to overload the centre of the pitch and create gaps/space for the pair of poachers to exploit.\n\nFriendly RESULTS:\n\nW = 2, D = 5, L = 0\n\nWe managed to go unbeaten throughout the entire preseason but ended up drawing a mammoth five games!\n\nDefensively we were fairly solid but we failed to reach the attacking highs of last years league form, a concert that hopefully we can just attribute that to preseason rustiness in front of goal. We played a couple of fellow GFA Premier Division sides, holding out for 1-1 draws against both St. John's Sports and T.A. Marryshow Community College.\n\nOTHER NEWS:\n\nInjuries:\n\nThe biggest, and only really injury setback was this one suffered by star midfielder Earldon Millette. This was sustained midway through the run of friendly games but, with the regular season fast approaching, he is still 3 weeks away from returning to full fitness. This is a real shame since the youngster was our star man in the centre last year and will be sorely missed through the first month of league action.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat brings to an end another update from Grenada. The board have pilled the pressure on this season and expect me to bring home a trophy and be competing in the final for the other. We made some decent signings, most of which should ensure that our depth and rotational options are of a much higher standard than they were last year, and we also managed to obtain our first foreign player.\n\nThe league season this year only contains 18 fixtures (since the league was reduced to 10 teams) and therefore we will need to ensure that we hit the ground running if we are wanting to defend our title from a year ago.\n\nI will hopefully be back soon with another update from the first month of the GFA Premier Division season and I really hope you are all still enjoying this adventure!\n\nUpdate 8: July & August 2018\n\nTeam: Mount Rich\n\nDivision: GFA Premier Division\n\nThe preseason has passed and now it is time for some more Grenadian league football. We failed to impress during the friendly schedule, playing solid defensive football but demonstrating a distinct lack of clinical finishing despite adding a number of different attacking players during the transfer window.\n\nAs you may recall, we won the league and domestic cup double last season, in a year that no-one could have predicted. This time around, the pressure is on, with the board expecting another league victory and a cup final appearance to match. My personal aim is to finish in the top two spots and guarantee ourselves another trip to the CFU Champions Cup - anything less than that will be a disappointment.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTRANSFERS:\n\nYes, the preseason might have passed, but the transfer window in Grenada remains open until the end of August. I do not usually like partaking in transfer activity once the season has begun but I did not really have a choice because of a few departures...\n\n(Out)\n\nJust the one player departed, back-up central midfielder Ariel Charles (27). The rotation man was one of the few remaining players who were with us on a non-contract basis and therefore he was able to freely speak to other clubs.\n\nT.A. Marryshow Community College, who are in our division, offered him a deal and, despite us offering him a similar contract, he decided to leave and join our league rivals. Granted he will likely get more playing time at his new club but this was still annoying considering my aim this preseason had been to build-up squad depth, not lose it.\n\nTo make matters worse, we then had this happen...\n\nDwayne Leo (36), who we signed just a month ago, decide to retire from football - completely out of the blue, without any warning. Kimron Redhead had announced his plans to retire at the end of the season but Leo decided to spring this decision on us after playing in four league games, demonstrating that life at Mount Rich definitely was not for him.\n\nUnfortunately, like Charles, Leo played in the centre of midfield and this meant that we lost two, very solid, rotational options in a matter of days. I had to then go out and scramble to find some replacements.\n\n(In)\n\nI was unable to find two decent enough players but I did manage to acquire Quinton Daniel (22) from recently promoted Happy Hill. Unfortunately, he was only interested in a non-contract agreement and therefore we are liable to lose him in the future but for now I just needed someone who was willing to play as a central midfielder.\n\nGFA Premier Division RESULTS:\n\nW = 4, D = 3, L = 1\n\nFar from the start I had planned for our league season.\n\nWe stared well enough, beating two very good opponents in our opening games and keeping a pair of clean sheets but then things went downhill. We could only manage draws against St. John's Sports and newly promoted Happy Hill before conceding four away to Hard Rock and slumping to our first defeat of the season. Things did not improve on the defensive end as we conceded three goals the following week against bottom of the league T.A. Marryshow Community College, only managing a win thanks to some improved forward play. We then struggled to a boring 0-0 draw against a strong Hurricanes outfit before ending August with a closely fought victory over the other new side, Ball Dogs (great team name though).\n\nWe played pretty well going forward, smashing in 19 goals in these eight fixtures but defensively we were awful after our first two games. The remaining six fixtures saw us keep just one clean sheet and concede 12 times, not the sort of form befitting of league champions.\n\nPLAYER STATISTICS:\n\nOur start of season form has been far from spectacular and that is reflected in the average ratings of our players. Whilst we do have 13 individuals who hold an average rating of at least 7.0, the actual ratings are way down on what we achieved last year.\n\nOne person who has shone though is new forward Shaddai Sampson (7.59). The teenager has been excellent in attack, scoring five goals and adding a further five assists in just seven appearances.\n\nDefensively we have been pretty poor. Last seasons Player of the Year, Kimron Marshall (7.26) has been good but his form is way short of the lofty heights he reached last season. Likewise, fellow fullback Quinton Rennie (7.07) and central defender Nicko Williams (7.06) have both been solid but not spectacular. New signings Christ Kisangala (6.87) and Christon Noel (6.55) have both struggled to settle whilst goalkeeper is a real issue with both Desmond Noel (7.00) and Kuan Williams (6.88) not looking great between the posts.\n\nChad Mark (7.15) has been the best performer in the centre of midfield, playing 14 key passes and scoring a pair of individual goals. Earldon Millette (7.02) has struggled a bit upon returning from injury whilst ball-winner Henson Cuffie (6.79) has been pretty awful. This poor form has resulted in Kimron Redhead (7.08), last seasons top scorer, dropping back into midfield more regularly and, fortunately, he has been fairly efficient.\n\nUp top, Uriah Enoe (7.23) has formed a very effective partnership with the newly signed Sampson. Enoe leads the team with eight goals in just 10 appearances this season . Another new signing, Quintana Ogilvie (7.02) has provided an excellent option off the bench and has scored four times in his seven games. The player who I have been most impressed with though is Kyle John-Brown (7.13). The youngster was a product of our youth intake last year and, given the poor form of our central midfielders, he has really stepped up and provided a playmaking presence when going forward. The 17 year old leads the team in key passes played, with 27, and has also added four assists.\n\nLEAGUE TABLE:\n\nFortunately for us, our poor form to start the year has not been punished as much as I expected as it seems everyone is struggling a bit. The only two undefeated sides at this stage are St. John's Sports and Happy Hill but these two have drawn 11 fixtures between them. Top of the league at the moment are a resurgent Hard Rock side who had a very poor campaign last time out whilst Hurricanes sit in third, with the same points total as ourselves.\n\nTwo sides really struggling at the moment are Paradise Sports Club and last seasons league runners up, Grenada Boys Secondary School. Both are in danger of facing a relegation battle and, given that the season is just 18 games in length, they will need to turn their fortunes around very quickly!\n\nOTHER NEWS:\n\nSquad Happiness:\n\nOne reason that we might be struggling a bit is individual player happiness. Our excellent season last year meant that a few of our players starting attracting interest from overseas clubs and that has only intensified during the first few months of this season.\n\nThe screenshot above shows Earldon Millette's moral, after I denied him a move to Club Sando in Trinidad & Tobago. For now, he is the only one really unhappy and complaining to teammates but I have been refusing bids for the likes of Uriah Enoe, Chad Mark and Nicko Williams so things could really get out of hand if everyone starts kicking off.\n\nI would consider letting people go if the bids I were receiving were substantial, but at the moment no-one seems willing to pay anything above £2,000 and it just seems silly to let a player like Millette depart for that.\n\nInternational News:\n\nThe latest Grenada squads were announced and there were a few big surprises with regards to our players.\n\nFour; Davier Ogilvie, keeper Kuan Williams, David McQueen and new fullback Kimron Belfon, were all named in the U20 squad.\n\nThe big shocks came in the senior side where both Chad Mark and Uriah Enoe both failed to receive call-ps, despite being two of our best players during this current season. In their place, Earldon Millette was named despite only just recently recovered from injury and there were first-time call-ups for both Kyle John-Brown and, amazingly, for Shavon Bishop, our young forward who has barely played a game for us this season! Shaddai Sampson was deservedly named to the senior side and will be looking to add to his two previous appearances for the national side.\n\nThe Football Universe:\n\nThe main bit of news from the worldwide universe was that the 2018 World Cup took place in July and there was a shock winner!\n\nAlexis Sanchez and co beat France in the final to lift a first ever World Cup for Chile! The last match of the tournament was a pretty close affair but a solid first half saw the winners score three goals, with Sanchez netting a brace, and they were able to hold out for an unlikely trophy win.\n\nThe run to the final was not easy for Chile, they had to beat Belgium and then Germany along the way so are definitely serving champions.\n\nThere were not too many surprises in the second round, although Brazil needed penalties to overcome a resistant Senegal side and Italy lost to Argentina whist Portugal could not overcome a tough Belgium outfit. England made the quarter finals but lost out to France, with the later then beating Argentina on spot kicks in order to reach the final.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat concludes the first few months of action in Grenada and it has not been the start of season I had hoped for. We have by no means played badly but I was not expecting us to be so bad defensively and therefore find ourselves in a real title battle. Failing to finish in the top two would be a massive disappointment but there are still 10 games left to play and we are very much in the running for another GFA Premier Division title - it is just looking a lot tighter than last time!\n\nUpdate 9: September & October 2018\n\nTeam: Mount Rich\n\nDivision: GFA Premier Division\n\nWelcome back to Mount Rich in Grenada where the last update saw us struggle to find consistent league form, especially on the defensive end where we conceded a large amount of goals. Fortunately for us, no-one else in the league was able to take proper advantage of this and it resulted in a very tight looking league table, with just four points separating the top six sides.\n\nThis update will see us play through the months of September and October, which include the majority of our remaining league games and also see the draw for the first round of the Waggy-T Super Knockout Football Tournament take place.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTRANSFERS:\n\nDespite only having an 18 game league season, the Grenadian domestic scene still has a midseason transfer window. Not much business was done on our behalf but there were a few points of interest worth bringing up.\n\n(Out)\n\nThe one big news item was that we agreed to sell troubled midfielder Earldon Millette. The youngster had a terrific season last year but had been riddled by injuries this time around. When offers started coming in for the teenager from abroad he made some real noise about wanting to leave and starting openly complaining to teammates.\n\nI obviously did not want him to leave but given the moral-sapping crusade he was on I thought it best to cut my losses now. He will join Point Fortin in the Trinidad & Tobago top domestic division at the beginning of next season.\n\n(In)\n\nWith Millette departing in the future, I had no plans on letting him play any further part in this league season. In his place I signed another central midfielder, Kareem Coutain (24) from league rivals Paradise Sports Club. The 24 year old has played 15 times for the senior Grenada national side and had played nine times for his previous club this season, averaging a rating of 6.96.\n\nGFA Premier Division RESULTS:\n\nW = 5, D = 1, L = 1\n\nA lot better to start September but we then had a few poor results to end October.\n\nWe kicked things off with two remarkable victories over struggling Queens Park Rangers and Grenada Boys Secondary School sides. We won both of these games emphatically, with back to back 6-2 scorelines. We followed these wins with another pair of victories, firstly against Paradise in a game where we kept our first clean sheet in ages, and then against St. John's Sports, where we required an 89th minute winner.\n\nWe"
