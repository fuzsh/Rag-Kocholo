The winger possesses an abundance of pace and is renown for scoring great goals.

Although he could not help County avoid relegation from the Football League after joining the club from Crawley Town ahead of the ill-fated 2018-19 season, Boldewijn has caught the eye over the last two campaigns in the National League.

The 28-year-old scored eight goals last term as County reached the play-off final where the promotion dream was ended by Harrogate Town.

He has picked up where he left off this season with Boldewijn again a regular in Neal Ardley's side and weighing in with three strikes in 17 outings.

Boldewijn has showed the form that led to interest from clubs higher up the pyramid in the former FC Utrecht winger, who emerged as one of League Twoâ€™s hottest talents during his time with Crawley, where he netted 10 goals and had 10 assists for his team-mates during 2017-18.

He arrived at Crawley in 2016 upon his release from Almere City, and Boldewijn signed for County on a three-year deal for an undisclosed six-figure fee in July 2018.

Ardley loves working with the exciting winger.

"Enzio has had the rocket and an arm around the shoulder. He's had a little bit of everything. He is a good lad and I've got a very good relationship with him," said Ardley.

"I feel like I can deliver that sort of news and feedback to him. And, at the end of the day, we're all here for a reason to try and bring success for this club and anybody that's not pulling their weight, it's my job to make sure that they know that."
