        "text": "Some books look so beautiful on the shelf. Not only for their aesthetic virtues, but for what their spines say about the owner. The four hardbound volumes of Donald Knuth’s “The Art of Computer Programming” — all snug in their dark purple case — send a clear message: Step aside, Muggles, because you’re in the presence of a Real Programmer. A Serious Practitioner of Computer Science.\n\nBill Gates once said, “If you think you’re a really good programmer… read Art of Computer Programming… You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing.”\n\nFor me, the act of ordering this series felt like a major professional accomplishment. I allocated a special place on my shelf for these books before they arrived, as one might make room out in the barn for a shiny new mainframe.\n\nThe weight of their authority was so great that they became immovable. So I never read them, and this isn’t really a book review of the series. Sorry not sorry.\n\nThis also isn’t one of those reviews where the reviewer walked out of the movie early, in disgust. Knuth’s books are epic, and he is truly a master of the fundamentals of computer programming, its origins in mathematics, and the intersection of the two fields. So much respect."
