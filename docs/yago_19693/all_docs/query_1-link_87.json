        "text": "I came to a career in software development with a degree in English, rather than Computer Science or another science/engineering background. I have gone a long way on my self-taught basis, but after 10+ years of doing this, I want to go back and fill in the gaps, particularly with the math.\n\nThe obvious place to give myself a Comp-Sci education is to go through The Art of Computer Programming. However, as I didn't take all that much math and my last math class in college was in 1995, I need some brushing up and augmenting to even be able to read the math notation in TAOCP.\n\nMy thought was to go to Khan Academy and work through the necessary topics as a remedial prereq to reading TAOCP. However, in a Catch 22, I'm trying to figure out which topics do I actually need to go through as prep.\n\nSo, what I'm wondering is, if someone basically only had high school math (I've got a bit more than that, but I think it's a valid question for someone to approach this with just high school as a background), what math \"classes\" does one need from somewhere like Khan Academy in order to start TAOCP prepared to read and understand the included math?"
