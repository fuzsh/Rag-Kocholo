        "text": "How Not to Be Wrong\n\nBy Jordan Ellenberg,\n\nFrom my list on computer science without coding.\n\nBy Martin Erwig Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m a professor of computer science at Oregon State University. My research focus is on programming languages, but I also work on computer science education and outreach. I grew up in Germany and moved to the United States in 2000. Since computer science is a fairly new and not widely understood discipline, I am interested in explaining its core ideas to the general public. I believe that in order to attract a more diverse set of people to the field we should emphasize that coding is only a small part of computer science.\n\nMartin's book list on computer science without coding\n\nWhy did Martin love this book?\n\nThis book is not about computing, but it is relevant in an indirect way. I love this book, since it is written in such an engaging style and illustrates with many examples that math is not a dry subject to be practiced only by mathematicians but helps everyone to solve real-world problems. The book shows how important it is to be precise in describing problems and that applying a little mathematical rigor goes a long way in solving them. Ellenberg describes mathematics as the “extension of common sense by other means.” In a similar way, I view computer science as the extension of problem-solving methods (aka “algorithms”) by other means.\n\nBy Jordan Ellenberg,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked How Not to Be Wrong as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"Witty, compelling, and just plain fun to read . . .\" -Evelyn Lamb, Scientific American\n\nThe Freakonomics of math-a math-world superstar unveils the hidden beauty and logic of the world and puts its power in our hands\n\nThe math we learn in school can seem like a dull set of rules, laid down by the ancients and not to be questioned. In How Not to Be Wrong, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how terribly limiting this view is: Math isn't confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we do-the whole world is shot through…\n\nPreview\n\nHow to Solve It\n\nBy George Polya,\n\nFrom my list on mathematical and algorithmic thinking.\n\nBy Steven S. Skiena Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am Professor of Computer Science at Stony Brook University, and have spent the past thirty years thinking/teaching/writing about algorithms. Algorithms are the really cool thing about computer science, for they form the ideas behind any interesting computer program. And algorithms turn out to be the ideas behind many interesting aspects of life that have nothing to do with computers. I have written six books on algorithms, programming, gambling, and history –including the ranking of the historical significance of all the people in Wikipedia.\n\nSteven's book list on mathematical and algorithmic thinking\n\nWhy did Steven love this book?\n\nPolya was a great mathematician who knew what counted (after all, he made major contributions to combinatorics, the mathematics of counting). He thought hard about what he was doing when working on problems in mathematics, developing a mental process that lead to creative breakthroughs and solutions. Polya’s problem-solving method is broadly applicable to domains other than mathematics, and this book features many nice puzzles to improve your thinking.\n\nAlgorithm design is challenging because it often requires flashes of sudden insight which seem to come out of the blue. But there is a way of thinking about problems that make such flashes more likely to happen. I try to teach this thought process in my books, but Polya got there first.\n\nBy George Polya,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked How to Solve It as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA perennial bestseller by eminent mathematician G. Polya, How to Solve It will show anyone in any field how to think straight. In lucid and appealing prose, Polya reveals how the mathematical method of demonstrating a proof or finding an unknown can be of help in attacking any problem that can be \"reasoned\" out--from building a bridge to winning a game of anagrams. Generations of readers have relished Polya's deft--indeed, brilliant--instructions on stripping away irrelevancies and going straight to the heart of the problem.\n\nPreview\n\nAlgorithms to Live By\n\nBy Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths,\n\nFrom my list on computing and why it’s important and interesting.\n\nBy Michael L. Littman Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nSaying just the right words in just the right way can cause a box of electronics to behave however you want it to behave… that’s an idea that has captivated me ever since I first played around with a computer at Radio Shack back in 1979. I’m always on the lookout for compelling ways to convey the topic to people who are open-minded, but maybe turned off by things that are overly technical. I teach computer science and study artificial intelligence as a way of expanding what we can get computers to do on our behalf.\n\nMichael's book list on computing and why it’s important and interesting\n\nWhy did Michael love this book?\n\nI always find myself applying algorithmic thinking in my everyday life—it affects the way I put away dishes, navigate to the store, and organize my to-do lists. And I think others could benefit from that mindset.\n\nSo, when I read this book, my reaction was \"Yes! That's what I want people to know. I just wish I could have said it that well!\" The authors (who I know, but didn't know they wrote a book together), did a fantastic job of selecting algorithms with deep human connections. Really! And they explain them just right, without getting too mathematical but while still hitting the key ideas with clarity and accuracy. Fantastic!\n\nBy Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n5 authors picked Algorithms to Live By as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA fascinating exploration of how computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives.\n\nIn this dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show us how the simple, precise algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. Modern life is constrained by limited space and time, limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? The authors explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal…\n\nPreview\n\nAdventures of a Mathematician\n\nBy S. M. Ulam,\n\nFrom my list on for mathematical inspiration.\n\nBy Thomas A. Garrity Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love mathematics and truly believe that “Functions Describe the World.” I'm deeply satisfied that I've spent my professional life discovering new mathematics and explaining known mathematics to others. I was an undergraduate at the University of Texas, Austin, got my PhD from Brown University, then spent three years as a G.C. Evans Instructor at Rice University, before moving to Williams, where I've been ever since. Besides writing All the Math You Missed (But Need to Know for Graduate School), I've also written Algebraic Geometry: A Problem Solving Approach (with a number of co-authors) and Electricity and Magnetism for Mathematicians: A Guided Path from Maxwell’s Equations to Yang-Mills, and a number of research articles.\n\nThomas' book list on for mathematical inspiration\n\nWhy did Thomas love this book?\n\nUlam was a Polish mathematical prodigy, publishing significant mathematics by the time he was 20. He was part of the rich Polish math community centered around Stefan Banach. Unlike most, he was heading to the United States in 1939 (with his younger brother) when Germany invaded Poland. All the rest of his family were murdered by the Nazis. He on the other hand ended up in Los Alamos, providing critical help on the Manhattan Project. Later in life, he wrote this book, his autobiography. Based on his history, one could well think that it would be a book full of tragic grief. Instead, it is a pean to the joys of doing mathematics and of living a life full of mathematics, without downplaying the horrors of the mid-twentieth century.\n\nBy S. M. Ulam,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Adventures of a Mathematician as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis autobiography of mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, one of the great scientific minds of the twentieth century, tells a story rich with amazingly prophetic speculations and peppered with lively anecdotes. As a member of the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1944 on, Ulam helped to precipitate some of the most dramatic changes of the postwar world. He was among the first to use and advocate computers for scientific research, originated ideas for the nuclear propulsion of space vehicles, and made fundamental contributions to many of today's most challenging mathematical projects. With his wide-ranging interests, Ulam never emphasized the importance of his…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Art of Computer Programming\n\nBy Donald Knuth,\n\nFrom my list on the theory and practice of computer programming.\n\nBy Federico Kereki Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have been working with computers for decades now – having started with programmable handheld calculators and working my way up and down through mainframes, mini- and micro-computers. I always thought there is an art to writing software, and that good software can be read and admired. Maintainability, readability, and testability are some core needs for software, and after going through many programming paradigms, I feel that functional programming (FP) is the way to go – and several modern web frameworks agree. JavaScript (and now, TypeScript) are essential to web development, and I wanted to show how FP could be successfully used with those languages, and thus my book.\n\nFederico's book list on the theory and practice of computer programming\n\nWhy did Federico love this book?\n\nThis multi-volume book is, for me, a masterpiece that goes far beyond just coding or algorithms or data structures, and serves as a profound exploration of algorithmic thinking and computer science's theoretical foundations, going deeply into the performance of algorithms and the behavior of data structures.\n\nKnuth's meticulous approach, coupled with his clear and engaging prose (with occasional touches of humor) clearly explains complex concepts, and shows a deep understanding of the artistry inherent in solving computational problems.\n\nBill Gates said that anybody who went through all its volumes would get a job at his company, and I surely agree!

Yes, it’s ostensibly about ActionScript, the coding language in Flash, which no one uses anymore. But you won’t use this book to learn ActionScript or Flash: You’ll use it to learn how to make things move with code, in any language. You’ll skip over the ActionScript-specific parts in favor of the lucid explanations and helpful illustrations. Your visual brain will appreciate seeing how sines, cosines, and tangents are relevant—and necessary!—to make digital things move. (Your heart will wish your brain had paid better attention in trigonometry class years earlier, but hey, no regrets!) The chapters “Trigonometry for Animation” and “Velocity and Acceleration” alone are worth the purchase price.\n\nBy Keith Peters,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Foundation ActionScript 3.0 Animation as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis is the first definitive and authoritative book available on ActionScript 3 animation techniques. ActionScript animation is a very popular discipline for Flash developers to learn. The essential skill set has been learned by many Flash developers through the first edition of this book. This has now been updated to ActionScript 3, Adobe's new and improved scripting language. All of the code has been updated, and some new techniques have been added to take advantage of ActionScript 3's new features, including the display list and new event architecture. The code can be used with the Flash 9 IDE, Flex Builder…\n\nPreview"
