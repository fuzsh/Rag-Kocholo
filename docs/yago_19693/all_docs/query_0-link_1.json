        "text": "The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP)\n\nby Donald E. Knuth.\n\nClick here to sign up for The Art of Computer Programming Newsletter, which features updates on new editions and promotions.\n\n(photo of TAOCP, 1968–2015, by Héctor García-Molina)\n\nAt the end of 1999, these books were named among the best twelve physical-science monographs of the century by American Scientist, along with: Dirac on quantum mechanics, Einstein on relativity, Mandelbrot on fractals, Pauling on the chemical bond, Russell and Whitehead on foundations of mathematics, von Neumann and Morgenstern on game theory, Wiener on cybernetics, Woodward and Hoffmann on orbital symmetry, Feynman on quantum electrodynamics, Smith on the search for structure, and Einstein's collected papers. Wow!\n\nView “historic” publisher's brochure from the first edition of Volume 1 (1968)\n\nA complimentary downloadable PDF containing the collected indexes is available from the publisher to registered owners of the five-volume boxed set. This PDF includes the complete indexes of Volumes 1, 2, 3, 4A, and 4B, as well as the index to Volume 1 Fascicle 1. Registered owners of the earlier four-volume boxed set are, similarly, entitled to download an earlier collection of indexes. This earlier collection includes Volumes 1, 2, 3, and 4A; Volume 1; and Volume 4 Fascicles 5 and 6.\n\neBook versions\n\nThese volumes are now available also in portable electronic form, using PDF format. Special care has been taken to make the search feature work well. Thousands of useful \"clickable\" cross-references are also provided — from exercises to their answers and back, from the index to the text, from the text to important tables and figures, etc.\n\nWarning: Unfortunately, however, non-PDF versions have also appeared, against my recommendations, and those versions are frankly quite awful. A great deal of expertise and care is necessary to do the job right. If you have been misled into purchasing one of these inferior versions (for example, a Kindle edition), the publishers have told me that they will replace your copy with the PDF edition that I have personally approved. Do not purchase eTAOCP in Kindle format if you expect the mathematics to make sense. (The ePUB format may be just as bad; I really don't want to know, and I am really sorry that it was released.) Please do not tell me about errors that you find in a non-PDF eBook; such mistakes should be reported directly to the publisher. Some non-PDF versions also masquerade as PDF.\n\nThe authorized PDF versions can be purchased at www.informit.com/taocp. If you have purchased a different version of the eBook, and can provide proof of purchase of that eBook, you can obtain a gratis PDF verson by sending email and proof of purchase to taocp@pearson.com.\n\nVolume 1\n\nFundamental Algorithms, Third Edition (Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 1997), xx+650pp. ISBN 0-201-89683-4\n\nVolume 1 Fascicle 1, MMIX: A RISC Computer for the New Millennium (2005), v+134pp. ISBN 0-201-85392-2\n\nTranslations of previous editions:\n\nRomanian translation by Adrian Davidoviciu, Adrian Petrescu, Smaranda Dimitriu, and Paul Zamfirescu, Tratat de programarea calculatoarelor, V. 1: Algoritmi fundamentali (Bucharest: Editura tehnica, 1974), 676pp.\n\nRussian translation by Galina P.

These fascicles will represent my best attempt to write a comprehensive account; but computer science has grown to the point where I cannot hope to be an authority on all the material covered in these books. Therefore I'll need feedback from readers in order to prepare the official volumes later.\n\nFor example, the following fascicles appeared before the hardcover editions of Volumes 4A and 4B were complete.\n\nVolume 4 Fascicle 0, Introduction to Combinatorial Algorithms and Boolean Functions (2008), xii+216pp. ISBN 0-321-53496-4\n\nVolume 4 Fascicle 1, Bitwise Tricks & Techniques; Binary Decision Diagrams (2009), xiii+261pp. ISBN 0-321-58050-8\n\nVolume 4 Fascicle 2, Generating All Tuples and Permutations (2005), v+128pp. ISBN 0-201-85393-0\n\nVolume 4 Fascicle 3, Generating All Combinations and Partitions (2005), vi+150pp. ISBN 0-201-85394-9\n\nVolume 4 Fascicle 4, Generating All Trees; History of Combinatorial Generation (2006), vi+120pp. ISBN 0-321-33570-8\n\nVolume 4 Fascicle 5, Mathematical Preliminaries Redux; Introduction to Backtracking; Dancing Links (2019), xiii+384pp. ISBN 978-0-13-467179-6\n\nVolume 4 Fascicle 6, Satisfiability (2015), xiii+310pp. ISBN 978-0-13-439760-3\n\nTranslations of those fascicles:\n\nJapanese translation of Volume 4 Fascicle 0 by Eiiti Wada (Tokyo: ASCII Media Works, 2009), xii+206pp.\n\nChinese translation of Volume 4 Fascicle 0, under the direction of Lin Peng Huang (Beijing: Chinese Machine Press, 2010), xii+432pp.\n\nHungarian translation of Volume 4 Fascicle 0, under the direction of Antal Iványi: Bevezetés a kombinatorikai algoritmusokhoz és a Boole-függvényekhez (Budapest: AnTonCom Infokommunikációs Kft., 2009), in preparation.\n\nAlbanian translation of Volume 4 Fascicle 0 by Ana Ktona, Besmira Nushi, and Silvana Greca, Arti i programimit kompjuterik, V. 4, Fashikulli 0, Hyrje ne algoritmat me Kombinatoralë dhe funksionet Boolean (Bitola: Mikena, 2009), 238pp.\n\nHungarian translation of Volume 4 Fascicle 1, under the direction of Antal Iványi: Bitenkénti trükkök és módszerek; Bináris döntési diagramok (Budapest: AnTonCom Infokommunikációs Kft., 2009), in preparation.\n\nJapanese translation of Volume 4 Fascicle 1 by Eiiti Wada (Tokyo: ASCII Media Works, 2011), x+256pp.\n\nRomanian translation of Volume 4 Fascicle 2, by Cora Radulian: Generarea tuturor tuplurilor și permutărilor (Bucharest: Editura Teora, 2005), vii+144pp.\n\nJapanese translation of Volume 4 Fascicle 2 by Hiroshi Koide, supervised by Makoto Arisawa and Eiiti Wada (Tokyo: ASCII Corporation, 2006), viii+129pp.\n\nRussian translation of Volume 4 Fascicle 2, by Yu.

But if you want to help debug them, please go right ahead.\n\nVolume 5\n\nSyntactic Algorithms, in preparation.\n\n9. Lexical scanning (includes also string search and data compression)\n\n10. Parsing techniques\n\nEstimated to be ready in 2030.\n\nFuture plans\n\nAs I continue to write Volumes 4 and 5, I'll need to refer to topics that belong logically in Volumes 1--3 but weren't invented yet when I wrote those books. Instead of putting such material artificially into Volumes 4 or 5, I'll put it into fascicle form. The first such fascicle is in fact ready now (see above): It describes MMIX, a RISC machine that is used in Volume 4A; MMIX will also take the place of MIX in all subsequent editions of Volumes 1, 2, and 3.\n\nDownload the 16 Feb 2004 version of Volume 1 Fascicle 1 (583KB of compressed PostScript) (this old version is however no longer being maintained; see the errata below)\n\nAfter Volume 5 has been completed, I will revise Volumes 1--3 again to bring them up to date. In particular, the new material for those volumes that has been issued in beta-test fascicles will be incorporated at that time.\n\nThen I will publish a “reader's digest” edition of Volumes 1--5, condensing the most important material into a single book.\n\nAnd after Volumes 1--5 are done, God willing, I plan to publish Volume 6 (the theory of context-free languages) and Volume 7 (Compiler techniques), but only if the things I want to say about those topics are still relevant and still haven't been said. Volumes 1--5 represent the central core of computer programming for sequential machines; the subjects of Volumes 6 and 7 are important but more specialized.\n\nVolumes 1--4B are available from the publisher, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.\n\nMIXware\n\nThe MIX computer will soon be replaced by a RISC machine called MMIX. Meanwhile if you want to try out the existing programs for the original 60s-era machine, you might be able to find suitable software at the following sites:\n\nGNU's MIX Development Kit\n\nJMixSim, an OS-independent assembler and simulator, by Christian Kandeler\n\nMixIDE, another OS-independent assembler and simulator, by Andrea Tettamanzi\n\nMIXBuilder: an editor, assembler, simulator, and interactive debugger for Win32 platforms, by Bill Menees\n\nEMIX: an expandable MIX emulator for the Win32 platform, by Daniel Andrade and Marcus Pereira\n\nMIX/MIXAL in C with lex and CWEB documentation and a source debug facility, by Douglas Laing and Sergey Poznyakoff\n\nDavid Smallberg's version that can be compiled for Linux\n\nDan Taflin's assembler and interactive simulator in HTML and Javascript\n\nAndras Pahi's updated version of Darius Bacon and Eric Raymond's open-source load-and-go assembler and simulator, from The Retrocomputing Museum\n\nJohn R. Ashmun's MIXware for the Be [Haiku] operating system, with extended support for interrupts\n\nRutger van Bergen's MIX emulator in .NET/C#\n\nChaoji Li's MIX assembler and simulator, in Perl\n\nRuslan Batdalov's MIX emulator, in Scala, which allows execution both forwards and backwards\n\nMichael Schröder's instructions for building a real MIX on a little fpga-board\n\nJustin Flude's implementation in GO, includes floating-point ops\n\n(Please let me know of any other sites that I should add to this list.)\n\nThe MMIX Supplement\n\nMartin Ruckert has written an excellent 200-page companion to Volumes 1, 2, and 3, intelligently translating all of the MIX programs into MMIX form. This booklet is jam-packed with instructive details and opportunities for self-instruction.\n\nErrata et Addenda for Volume 1\n\nThe main changes between the second and third editions of Volume 1 are listed in the Errata for Volume 1 (2nd ed.) (335K bytes of compressed PostScript, 80pp)---an archival file that is not being kept up to date. But thousands of additional refinements appear in the 3rd edition; you really should ask someone to get it for you next Christmas.\n\nThe main changes to the third edition of Volume 1, made before the appearance of Volume 4A in 2011, are listed in the Earliest errata for Volume 1 (3rd ed.) (262K bytes of compressed PostScript, 50pp).\n\nThere's also another major list of changes, covering the period 2011--2021: Earlier changes for Volume 1 (3rd ed.) (143K bytes of compressed PostScript, 20pp).\n\nIndex to Algorithms and Theorems in Volume 1 (new in 2011) (14K bytes of compressed PostScript, 2pp)\n\nThere's also a (much shorter, last updated 08 February 2024) list of changes since the 49th printing was released in 2022, almost all of which have been made in more recent printings:\n\nErrata for Volume 1 (after 2021) (88K bytes of compressed PostScript, 11pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 1 (after 2021), long form (90K bytes of compressed PostScript, 11pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 1 (after 2021), TeX form (34K bytes of raw TeX text)\n\nNote: You can't run that TeX file through TeX; it imports all kinds of other files that are private. But if you have no way to look at compressed PostScript files, you might try reading the TeX code as a last resort; at least you'll be able to figure out the page numbers on which corrections have been made.\n\nAnd there's also a list of changes to Volume 1 Fascicle 1, last updated 14 May 2024:\n\nErrata for Volume 1 Fascicle 1 (88K bytes of compressed PostScript, 11pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 1 Fascicle 1, long form (92K bytes of compressed PostScript, 13pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 1 Fascicle 1, TeX form (39K bytes of raw TeX text)\n\nNote: An unknown number of badly printed copies of Volume 1 Fascicle 1 were printed by mistake. Among other defects, the copyright page has incredibly poor resolution, and the MMIX summary chart has been omitted from the inside back cover. If you have purchased one of these monstrosities, the publishers assure me that they will replace your copy with a good one.\n\nErrata et Addenda for Volume 2\n\nThe main changes between the second and third editions of Volume 2 are listed in the Errata for Volume 2 (2nd ed.) (555K bytes of compressed PostScript, 142pp)---an archival file that is not being kept up to date. But thousands of additional refinements appear in the 3rd edition; you really should ask someone to get it for you next Christmas.\n\nThe main changes to the third edition of Volume 2, made before the appearance of Volume 4A, are listed in the Earliest errata for Volume 2 (3rd ed.) (229K bytes of compressed PostScript, 50pp), dated 08 January 2011.\n\nThere's also another major list of changes, covering the period 2011--2021: Earlier changes for Volume 2 (3rd ed.) (133K bytes of compressed PostScript, 19pp).\n\nIndex to Algorithms and Theorems in Volume 2 (new in 2011) (14K bytes of compressed PostScript, 2pp)\n\nThere's also a (much shorter list (last updated 13 November 2023) of changes since the 45th printing was released in 2022, almost all of which have been made in more recent printings:\n\nErrata for Volume 2 (after 2021) (75K bytes of compressed PostScript, 6pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 2 (after 2021), long form (74K bytes of compressed PostScript, 6pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 2 (after 2021), TeX form (26K bytes of raw TeX text)\n\nNote: You can't run that TeX file through TeX; it imports all kinds of other files that are private. But if you have no way to look at compressed PostScript files, you might try reading the TeX code as a last resort; at least you'll be able to figure out the page numbers on which corrections have been made.\n\nErrata et Addenda for Volume 3\n\nThe main changes between the first and second editions of Volume 3 are listed in the Errata for Volume 3 (1st ed.) (430K bytes of compressed PostScript, 109pp)---an archival file that is not being kept up to date. But thousands of additional refinements appear in the 2nd edition; you really should ask someone to get it for you next Christmas.\n\nThe main changes to the second edition of Volume 3, made before the appearance of Volume 4A in 2011, are listed in the Earliest errata for Volume 3 (2nd ed.) (226K bytes of compressed PostScript, 43pp).\n\nThere's also another major list of changes, covering the period 2011--2021: Earlier changes for Volume 3 (2rd ed.) (117K bytes of compressed PostScript, 15pp).\n\nIndex to Algorithms and Theorems in Volume 3 (new in 2011) (14K bytes of compressed PostScript, 2pp)\n\nThere's also a (much shorter list (last updated 13 November 2023) of changes since the 45th printing was released in 2022, almost all of which have been made in more recent printings:\n\nErrata for Volume 3 (after 2021) (63K bytes of compressed PostScript, 5pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 3 (after 2021), long form (63K bytes of compressed PostScript, 5pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 3 (after 2021), TeX form (16K bytes of raw TeX text)\n\nNote: You can't run that TeX file through TeX; it imports all kinds of other files that are private. But if you have no way to look at compressed PostScript files, you might try reading the TeX code as a last resort; at least you'll be able to figure out the page numbers on which corrections have been made.\n\nErrata et Addenda for Volume 4A\n\nThe following corrections to the paperback fascicles that preceded Volume 4A will make them essentially consistent with the first hardcover printing of that volume. (These errata files reached their final form on 01 January 2011, and they won't be updated again; see below for additional amendments and corrections to the hardcover printing.)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 0 (124K bytes of compressed PostScript, 11pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 0, long form (128K bytes of compressed PostScript, 13pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 0, TeX form (51K bytes of raw TeX text)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 1 (166K bytes of compressed PostScript, 13pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 1, long form (169K bytes of compressed PostScript, 14pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 1, TeX form (47K bytes of raw TeX text)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 2 (100K bytes of compressed PostScript, 13pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 2, long form (109K bytes of compressed PostScript, 16pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 2, TeX form (50K bytes of raw TeX text)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 3 (112K bytes of compressed PostScript, 14pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 3, long form (118K bytes of compressed PostScript, 17pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 3, TeX form (48K bytes of raw TeX text)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 4 (124K bytes of compressed PostScript, 9pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 4, long form (126K bytes of compressed PostScript, 9pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4 Fascicle 4, TeX form (32K bytes of raw TeX text)\n\nThe main changes to the first edition of Volume 4A, made before the appearance of Volume 4B in 2022, are listed in the Earliest errata for Volume 4A (225K bytes of compressed PostScript, 44pp).\n\nThere's also a (much shorter, last updated 09 October 2023) list of changes since the 20th printing was released in 2022, almost all of which have been made in more recent printings:\n\nErrata for Volume 4A (after 2021) (75K bytes of compressed PostScript, 6pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4A (after 2021), long form (76K bytes of compressed PostScript, 6pp)\n\nErrata for Volume 4A (after 2021), TeX form (19K bytes of raw TeX text)\n\nNote: You can't run that TeX file through TeX; it imports all kinds of other files that are private.

If you are a really careful reader, you may be able to recoup more than the cost of the books this way, and you'll be helping future readers too.\n\nHowever, people who have read the book Eats, Shoots & Leaves should not expect a reward for criticizing the ways in which I use commas. Punctuation is extremely important to me, but I insist on doing it my own way.\n\nSimilarly, you can save yourself valuable time by not trying to get me to change ‘awhile’ to ‘a while’.\n\nAs mentioned above, I take no responsibility for errors in the eBook editions that do not use PDF format. I would soon go broke if I had to pay for all of them! Such errors should be reported directly to the publisher, not to me, and you should request a replacement copy.\n\nPlease send your comments either by email to taocp@cs.stanford.edu or by old-fashioned mail to\n\nDonald E. Knuth\n\nComputer Science Department\n\nGates Building 1B\n\nStanford University\n\nStanford, CA 94305-9015 USA.\n\nIn either case please include your postal address, so that I can mail an official certificate of deposit as a token of thanks for any improvements to which you have contributed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE TO THE SPEAKERS OF FRENCH AND OTHER EXOTIC LANGUAGES: Numerous quotations and bibliographic citations found in these books have been copied verbatim from the original sources. If you believe you have found a typographic error, you must prove it by showing that the original was incorrectly transcribed; believe it or not, your language has changed over the years, just as English has.\n\nAlthough I'm working full time on Volume 4C these days, I will try to reply to all such messages within nine months of receipt.\n\nBUT PLEASE DO NOT SEND EMAIL TO TAOCP EXCEPT TO REPORT ERRORS IN THE ART OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING. And if you do report an error via email, please do not include attachments of any kind; your message should be readable on brand-X operating systems for all values of X. (Encrypted messages that I get from \"gmail.com\" are also gibberish and unreadable without great pain.) Send PLAIN ASCII TEXT ONLY.\n\nDon Knuth's home page"
