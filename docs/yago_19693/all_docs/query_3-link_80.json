        "text": "Download and open the 'Processing' application. Select something from the Examples. Hit the Run button. Lather, rinse, repeat as necessary. More information on using Processing itself is can be found in the environment section of the reference. To learn the Processing language, we recommend you try a few of the built-in examples, and check out the reference. A group of diverse books have been written to help people with different goals and skill levels.\n\nProcessing 4 introduces major improvements behind the scenes, with the primary goal to keep your code running smoothly on the latest hardware and operating systems.\n\nIf you are still using Processing 3 or a Processing 4 beta, we strongly encourage you to switch to Processing 4 to get the best performance, compatibility, and support in the future.\n\nThe core Processing software is augmented by libraries and tools contributed through the community. These inventive extensions are a bright future for the project. We have a list of Contributed Libraries and Contributed Tools posted online. These contributions can't be underestimated.\n\nTo contribute to Processing development, please visit Processing on GitHub to read instructions for downloading the code, building from the source, reporting and tracking bugs, creating libraries and tools."
