Add winemaker to the Yonkers native's list of accomplishments.

Blige will lead a virtual gathering to celebrate her newly launched Sun Goddess Wines at Stew Leonard's on Thursday. The name, Sun Goddess, is a homage to Blige's mother, meant to capture her memories of love for the warmth and the energy of the sun.

Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano declared Sept. 17 as “Mary J. Blige Day” in the childhood hometown of the music legend. Blige’s mother, Cora, and brother, Bruce, will accept the honor.

The singer, who was discovered by a record company executive when she recorded a cover of Anita Baker's "Caught Up in the Rapture," at the Galleria Mall, grew up in the William A. Schlobohm Houses, one of the oldest public housing complexes in Yonkers.

At her wine event, sommelier Blake Leonard and her father, Stew Leonard Jr., will moderate a discussion with Blige on her pinot grigiot and sauvignon blanc. The wines were produced by Fantinel, a winery owned by the Fantinel family in Friuli Venezia Giulia. Sun Goddess wines will sell for under $20 at Stew Leonard’s Wines & Spirits of Yonkers and online.
