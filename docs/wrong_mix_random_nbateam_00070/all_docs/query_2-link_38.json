        "text": "Outdoor amphitheater, Rogers, Arkansas, USA\n\nThe Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion (originally known as the Arkansas Music Pavilion and commonly known as the Walmart AMP) is an outdoor amphitheater located in Rogers, Arkansas. The venue opened in June 2005 as a semi-permanent venue, becoming a permanent venue in 2014. Its capacity is now 11,000 fans.\n\nIt opened June 7, 2014, with a performance by Blake Shelton and Hunter Hayes.[2]\n\nThe Arkansas Music Pavilion was created in 2005 as a concept inspired by some of the most well known amphitheater's in the country including the Cape Cod Melody Tent (MA), The Universal Lending Pavilion (CO) and the Aspen Music Tent (CO) and The Boston Harbor Lights Pavilion (MA). These concepts generally combined a covered seating area and lawn seating. The original concept for a seasonal, semi-permanent concert venue was created by Dan White, Amy Mack White and Kelly Rourke which combined the features of an architecturally interesting canopy, theater style box seating, and no seat that was farther than 120 feet from the stage. The venue structure was designed by Tentnolology from Vancouver, Canada. The original venue had 2,533 seats under the pavilion. The entry into the market was discussed with the Walton Arts Center and was designed to become \"collaborative and never competitive\" with the Walton Arts Center. It was thought that the two venues together could create a year-round arts infrastructure for the region.\n\nThe AMP was unanimously approved by the City of Fayetteville under Mayor Dan Coody and was embraced by the Fayetteville Economic Development Council as a driver of tourism and arts development for the region. It opened to the public on Father's Day weekend in 2005 with headliners America and The Doobie Brothers. The original venue was located on the bluff behind the Northwest Arkansas Mall overlooking the city of Fayetteville. The land lease was set at $1 with Alice Church, manager of the mall who believed the concept would drive economic impact to the mall and the region. The venue operated at this location for four seasons from 2005 to 2009, with the original ownership team consisting of Dan & Amy White, Kelly Rourke, Joseph Boskus and Robbie Bader. Each season had 10 headlining national tours. The venue was independently owned and operated. The \"AMP\" became one of the fastest growing music venues in the country and renowned national tour stop between Kansas City and Dallas. In its second season it became the largest outdoor venue in the State of Arkansas. The venue played host to several community fundraising events including a respite shelter for Hurricane Katina, integral in the Bikes Blues and BBQ Festival and the backdrop for the reality TV show \"Daly Days\" on the Golf Channel.\n\nIn 2009, the venue was sold to Suzie Stephens and Brian Crowne by remaining partners Joseph Boskus, Dan White and Amy White. Brian Crowne had been involved from the inception as a fellow venue owner of George's Majestic Lounge, who acted as a credible advisor to the region's music scene. The original owners stayed on in a consulting capacity for the first year. In 2011, the music venue was purchased by the Walton Arts Center.[3] Failed contract negotiations lead to moving the structure to the Washington County Fairgrounds for 2012 and 2013 seasons.[4] The move saw a dramatic increase in ticket sales and overall turnout for events. In January 2013, the Walton Arts Center Council announced plans build a permanent structure for the amphitheater. This location was one of the original locations that the original creators had discussions with as a visible symbol or arts and entertainment for the region. Wanting to remain in Northwest Arkansas, many locations were viewed however the decision was made to build in Rogers near the Pinnacle Hills Promenade.[5] Construction began in late October 2013, with plans to complete in June 2014. In early 2014, Walmart, Inc purchased naming rights to the venue.[6]\n\nWeezer\n\nPhish\n\nShinedown\n\nPitbull and Iggy Azalea\n\nSlipknot and Killswitch Engage\n\nfor KING & COUNTRY\n\nBackstreet Boys\n\nGoo Goo Dolls with Blue October\n\nChicago with Brian Wilson\n\nAn Evening with James Taylor & his All Star Band.\n\nOneRepublic with Needtobreathe\n\nWillie Nelson with Brothers Osborne, Steve Earle and Allison Russell\n\nThe Chicks\n\nJimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band\n\nIncubus with Coheed and Cambria\n\nFoo Fighters\n\n[7]\n\nLana Del Rey\n\nPeso Pluma\n\nShinedown\n\nCulture Club/ Howard Jones/ Berlin\n\nSting\n\nSnoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa\n\nPantera\n\nLamb Of God"
