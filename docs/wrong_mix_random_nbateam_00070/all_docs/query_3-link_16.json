With its abundant beaches, enchanting waterfalls, and romantic charm, this island is the perfect destination for those seeking a dreamy vacation. But before embarking on your adventure, let's familiarize you with where Saint Lucia is.\n\nSaint Lucia is nestled in the Eastern Caribbean, closely neighbored by enchanting islands such as Barbados, Saint Vincent, and Martinique. The most convenient way to reach this tropical locale is by air, and you have two options: Hewanorra International Airport (UVF) and George F.L. Charles Airport (SLU), each offering its unique advantages for your journey.\n\nExpert tip: The best time to visit Saint Lucia is between mid-April to December, when you'll enjoy the finest weather and vibrant events, allowing you to explore all the incredible things Saint Lucia is known for.\n\nFlying to Saint Lucia via Hewanorra International Airport (UVF)\n\nYour choice of airport often depends on your point of origin. For international travelers, Hewanorra International Airport (UVF) near Vieux Fort, situated about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of the capital city, Castries, is your primary gateway. UVF is Saint Lucia's largest and most popular international airport, guaranteeing modern facilities and amenities, including shopping, dining options, and parking. UVF is the preferred choice for guests arriving from international destinations, such as the United States and Canada. Most visitors heading to Saint Lucia from these locations will land at this southern airport.\n\nGood to know: UVF is very close to Vieux Fort, a town that was once the capital of Saint Lucia.\n\nFlights to UVF\n\nHewanorra International Airport receives daily flights from several airlines, offering a convenient connection to and from Saint Lucia:\n\nFrom the United States: Four airlines offer flights to Saint Lucia from Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Miami, New York City, Newark, and Philadelphia.\n\nFrom Canada: There are three airlines that offer flights to Saint Lucia departing from Montreal and Toronto.\n\nWe've provided more general information on flight options from the US and Canada to UVF below:\n\nGateway Airline Schedule Duration Atlanta (ATL) Delta Daily 4hr 12min Boston (BOS) JetBlue Sat 4hr 45min Charlotte (CLT) American Airlines Daily 4hr 45min Chicago (ORD) United Sat 5hr 30min Miami (MIA) American Airlines Daily 3hr 40min Montreal (YUL) Air Canada Mon 5hr 00min Montreal (YUL) Air Transat Sun 5hr 10min New York City (JFK) JetBlue Daily 4hr 40min Newark (EWR) United Sat, Sun 4hr 45min Philadelphia (PHL) American Airlines Sat 4hr 45min Toronto (YYZ) Air Canada Mon, Fri, Sat, Sun 5hr 05min Toronto (YYZ) WestJet Tue, Thu, Sun 5hr 10min\n\nFlying to Saint Lucia via George F.L. Charles Airport (SLU)\n\nThe George F.L. Charles Airport is the smallest of Saint Lucia's two airports, primarily serving inter-island regional travel and ideal for guests embarking on island-hopping adventures or staying at Sandals Resorts in the Caribbean. Located in Vigie, just outside Castries, SLU offers a more compact and efficient experience, with facilities like snack bars and souvenir shops.\n\nImage credit: Galina Savina/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile George F.L. Charles Airport handles regional flights and can be an option for those connecting from other Caribbean islands, the majority of international visitors to Saint Lucia choose Hewanorra International Airport.\n\nGood to know: The George F.L. Charles Airport (SLU) is closer to Sandals Resorts than the Hewanorra International Airport, making it the perfect choice if you're traveling from other Caribbean destinations. Sandals Regency La Toc, Sandals Halcyon Beach, and Sandals Grande St. Lucian are excellent options for a vacation conveniently located minutes away from SLU.\n\nFlights to SLU\n\nTravelers originating from the below Caribbean destinations can book flights to George F.L. Charles Airport (SLU) in Saint Lucia:\n\nAntigua\n\nBarbados\n\nCuracao\n\nFort-de-France (Martinique)\n\nPointe-a-Pitre (Guadeloupe)\n\nPort of Spain (Trinidad & Tobago)\n\nSaint Kitts\n\nSaint Maarten\n\nSaint Vincent\n\nExpert tip: Elevate your Caribbean escape by embarking on an island-hopping adventure across multiple Sandals Resorts in various destinations, then flying into Saint Lucia via SLU. This strategic choice grants you quicker access to the northern resorts and attractions, so you can get started on your Saint Lucian adventure even faster.\n\nTransfers from St. Lucia airports to Sandals Resorts\n\nGood news for travelers to Saint Lucia! Airport transfers to and from the resort are included in Saint Lucia vacation packages for all Sandals guests. Regardless of your choice of airport or room category, you can enjoy hassle-free transportation to your resort.\n\nImage credit: alexfan32/Shutterstock.com\n\nSaint Lucia's airports are all accessible by car, with the furthest being just around an hour and a half away. For a quicker arrival, consider booking a helicopter transfer that will give you a scenic introduction to the island from the sky.\n\nHere's a little more detail on the distance of the various Sandals Resorts from Saint Lucia airports:\n\nHewanorra International Airport\n\nTo Sandals Regency La Toc: 34 miles (55 km), ~1 hr 10 min [Directions]\n\nTo Sandals Grande St. Lucian: 41 miles (66 km), ~1 hr 40 min [Directions]\n\nTo Sandals Halcyon Beach: 36 miles (58 km) ~1 hr 20 min [Directions]\n\nGeorge F.L.

It's renowned for its intimate atmosphere and lush surroundings, making it the perfect choice for a Caribbean escape.\n\nBONUS: Other things to know when flying to Saint Lucia\n\nDo you need a passport to go to Saint Lucia?\n\nYes, international travelers must carry a valid passport with an expiration date extending at least six months beyond their travel dates. Be sure to also have a return ticket as part of your travel documents. If you don't already have a passport, be sure to apply for one well in advance of your vacation.\n\nDo you have to pay departure tax in Saint Lucia?\n\nSaint Lucia imposes a departure tax included in your airfare for passengers aged 12 and above leaving the island by air.\n\nChoosing a Saint Lucia airport: First steps to a spectacular vacation!\n\nNow that you're well-informed about the Saint Lucia airports and your transportation options, you're one step closer to experiencing the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. Whether you decide to explore every corner of this enchanting island or simply revel in the comforts of your Sandals Resort, Saint Lucia promises an unforgettable experience.\n\nIf you're traveling from a Caribbean destination, George F.L. Charles Airport can be a great option as it is more convenient in terms of accessibility to northern resorts and attractions. Though the Hewanorra International Airport is further away from some of the major resorts on this island, it is close to some of the best attractions in Saint Lucia including waterfalls, hiking trails, and the popular Sulphur Springs (drive-in volcano). Despite the differences in distance, no matter where you choose to stay on this island you'll have access to the best tours, attractions, and amazing resorts.\n\nSomewhere before or after making the decision on which airport to travel to, you will need to think about where to stay in Saint Lucia. Sandals all-inclusive resorts offer three different accommodation options on the island. Each resort in Saint Lucia has its own distinct personality and is adults-only. Have fun and create good memories whether or not you leave your resort.\n\nExpert tip: The stunning beauty of Saint Lucia and the friendliness of the people will definitely make this one destination you won't soon forget, as will this Saint Lucia food and drinks.

This event first happened in 1947, just after World War II. Like other carnival events around the Caribbean, the carnival in Saint Lucia is inspired by an ancient pagan festival rooted in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. If you visit the island during the month of July when the carnival is held you'll have a chance to attend a host of parties, concerts, boat rides, and other events as well as participate in the grand Carnival Parade.\n\nSaint Lucia's carnival attracts visitors from all over the world. Some Saint Lucians residing in other countries make a point of returning home for this event. With lots of entertainment, glittery costumes, and opportunities to socialize, let loose, and dance, the carnival on this island appeals to anyone who just wants to have a good time against the backdrop of paradise.\n\nSaint Lucia Carnival was previously held in February/March ahead of Lent. The event's date was changed for a variety of reasons, but mostly to avoid competing with Trinidad and Tobago's carnival, which is the biggest in the Caribbean. Saint Lucia Carnival continues to grow, and, if you're on the island during this time, you can expect to hear lots of soca and calypso music, be dazzled by colorful costumes, and parade through the streets with a fun-loving crowd!\n\nExpert Tip: Other than carnival time, the best time to visit Saint Lucia is between the months of December to mid-April, which is considered the peak season for this island. Much like July, peak season is when you can find more activities to do in Saint Lucia and more consistent weather as well.\n\nHow can you participate in Saint Lucia's carnival experience?\n\nImage credit: Blue Sky imagery/Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you're planning on being in Saint Lucia around carnival time it might be a little difficult to resist being part of the fun. If you're wondering how you can participate, you can either sign up with a Mas Band (carnival band) or watch the carnival festivities from the sidelines. We'll start with the band option. There are lots of carnival bands to choose from in Saint Lucia including Just 4 Fun, Red Unlimited, Legends Carnival Band, XUVO Carnival, Fuzion Mas, and more. Prices for costumes vary for the different bands (which we'll discuss later). It might help to watch some videos or search for reviews on these bands in advance, so you can decide which will be best for you.\n\nOnce you've selected a carnival band you can start counting down the days to play Mas. Mas is short for masquerade! You can get the ball rolling by making a down payment on the costume of your choice. Closer to the carnival parade, you'll be able to pick it up at a designated location. Once you put on your costume on carnival day, you'll join the rest of the masqueraders on the carnival route. In Saint Lucia, this route is usually from Union to Castries. Stick with your band as that is where you'll get all your provisions for the day, inclusive of drinks and food.\n\nAnother option to participate in Saint Lucia Carnival is simply watching the festivities from the sidelines. This might sound a little mundane, but it absolutely is not. If you find the right spot you can feel like you're part of the carnival celebrations even if you're just a spectator. Dress for the occasion, particularly the hot weather, and get ready to have some fun! After the parade, you can even plan to go to one of the 'last lap' carnival parties!\n\nWhat are carnival costumes like in Saint Lucia?\n\nImage credit: Angela N Perryman/Shutterstock.com\n\nCostumes for the Saint Lucia Carnival range from colorful and captivating to elaborate and ginormous. These costumes are what you'll wear in your Mas Band on the two days of the carnival parade. Carnival costumes are available in a range of colors and styles, which means you can do some shopping around before selecting the costume and band that you like best. Most costumes include lots of feathers, rhinestones, and other assorted costume gems. The carnival costumes for women tend to be more elaborate than those for men, although there are a few options for men that are more intricate and detailed. Take your time looking around before you decide!\n\nCarnival music\n\nImage credit: Angela N Perryman/Shutterstock.com\n\nAround carnival time in Saint Lucia, you can expect to hear lots of traditional calypso, as well as high-energy soca music, almost everywhere you go. The local music has African and East Indian influences, particularly in terms of the catchy rhythms. There are specific events you can go to in Saint Lucia if you want to experience more of the local music. These events include the Groovy Soca and Power Soca competitions, as well as the National Calypso Monarch competition.\n\nCarnival in Saint Lucia makes room for regional soca as well.

Other genres like hip hop and dancehall are sometimes played on the island at carnival events but these tend to be in the minority.\n\nCarnival events\n\nThere is no short supply of events happening in Saint Lucia during carnival time. This includes the Parade of the Bands and other national events in Castries, as well as community events held in places like Soufriere, Vieux Fort, Gros Islet, and other areas. More festivities and individual events take place in Reduit Beach, Rodney Bay Marina, and Pigeon Island. Carnival events in Saint Lucia tend to span a few weeks to a month ahead of the main celebration.\n\nSaint Lucia Carnival's pre-opening festival\n\nImage credit: Paul Wishart/Shutterstock.com\n\nPre-carnival parties set the tone for the main carnival celebrations held in Castries. The list of these types of events in Saint Lucia is extensive and continues to grow every year. This list includes club parties, breakfast parties, boat rides, concerts, night Mas events, community carnival activities, and more. Surprisingly enough, even though there are so many parties on the schedule and even some on the same days, many of them are sold out.\n\nCarnival prime-up or pre-carnival events are a fantastic opportunity for visitors who do not plan on participating in the Parade of the Bands to get a taste of carnival. One of the most popular events in Saint Lucia held ahead of carnival is 'Color Me Red'. This event has been held on Pigeon Island in Saint Lucia featuring regional acts like Patrice Roberts, Kes, Nadia Batson, and Saint Lucian performers like Ezra, Arthur, and more. If you're headed to a pre-opening festival or event in Saint Lucia, keep in mind that most of these events tend to start later than the ticketed time.

Some people go all out and create their own outfits or costumes for this and other themed events.\n\nOther than 'Color Me Red', the list of events held ahead of carnival in Saint Lucia includes band parties, concerts, and other celebrations.\n\nCarnival J'ouvert\n\nImage credit: Blacqbook/Shutterstock.com\n\nJ'ouvert is a traditional event that dates back to the early 1830s when slavery was abolished in the Caribbean.
