        "text": "Music and film star Mary J. Blige will receive the Breakthrough Performance Award for her acclaimed performance in the Dee Rees drama, “Mudbound,” Jan. 2 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival Awards Gala, festival officials have announced.\n\nBlige will join previously announced 2018 honorees Timothée Chalamet, Gal Gadot, Holly Hunter, Allison Janney, Gary Oldman, Sam Rockwell, Saoirse Ronan and the cast, director and producers of the film, “The Shape of Water,\" at the Film Awards Gala. The black tie event, hosted by Mary Hart, is expected to attract 2,500 people at the Palm Springs Convention Center, plus fans gathering outside to watch the red carpet arrivals.\n\nMORE: Saoirse Ronan to receive major award\n\nThe festival runs Jan. 2-15 at venues throughout Palm Springs and Cathedral City.\n\n“Mary J. Blige is a global superstar in the world of music who continues to make her mark as an actress in both television and film,” said Festival Chairman Harold Matzner. “In her current film, 'Mudbound,' Blige gives a quiet yet fantastic performance as Florence Jackson, a strong woman supporting her sharecropper family in rural Mississippi.”\n\nMORE: Ensemble of \"Shape of Water\" to be honored\n\nPast recipients of the Breakthrough Performance Award include Mahershala Ali, Marion Cotillard, Jennifer Hudson, Felicity Huffman, Brie Larson, Lupita Nyong’o, David Oyelowo, Rosamund Pike and Jeremy Renner. In the years they were honored, Ali, Cotillard, Hudson, Larson and Nyong’o went on to receive Academy Awards, while Huffman, Pike and Renner received nominations.\n\nSet in the rural American South during World War II, “Mudbound” is the story of two families pitted against one another by a ruthless social hierarchy, but bound together by the shared farmland of the Mississippi Delta. It follows the family of Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke), newly transplanted from the quiet civility of Memphis and unprepared for the harsh demands of farming. Henry’s wife, Laura (Carey Mulligan), struggles to keep the faith in her husband's losing venture while, Hap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Blige), sharecroppers who have worked the land for generations, struggle to build their own small dream despite the rigidly enforced social barriers they face.\n\nBlige is a Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, actress and philanthropist, with a track record of eight multi-platinum albums, nine Grammy Awards (plus 32 nominations), a 2012 Golden Globe nomination and five American Music Awards. She has appeared in Tyler Perry’s dramatic comedy “I Can Do Bad All By Myself,” and starred in “Rock of Ages.”\n\nHer other credits include the TV movie “Betty & Coretta,” the holiday musical drama “Black Nativity” and guest spots on “Black-ish,” “Empire,” “The Wiz Live!” and “How To Get Away With Murder.”\n\nPast festival honorees have included Ben Affleck, Javier Bardem, Cate Blanchett, Sandra Bullock, Bradley Cooper, George Clooney, Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Clint Eastwood, Tom Hanks and Nicole Kidman.\n\nFor ticket information, call (760) 778-8979 or visit psfilmfest.org."
