        "text": "Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Mavens Do It Better podcast. And now your host, Heather Newman.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nHello everyone. Here we are again for another Mavens Do It Better podcast, where we interview extraordinary experts who bring a light to our world. And we definitely have a wonderful person on today who I've known for a while and we've been trying to get scheduled for a bit, so Chevonna Gaylor, Hello! How are you?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nHi! So happy to be here and I'm so glad we're finally able to make this happen.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nI know.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes, yes, yes.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nAbsolutely. Me as well. So, where are you coming to us today from?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nToday I am in my office. I call myself \"not your average therapist,\" and therapy is my gift. So, my office is my happy place. This is where the magic happens.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nI'm in my typical HQ right now in Marina Del Rey, California. You're California as well.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes. Southern California as well. Yes. In near Temecula area, so about an hour east of LA and about an hour north of San Diego.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah that's right. Temecula is kind of wine country as well, too right?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes, Temecula wine country. I'm not in Temecula, but most people don't know where Canyon Lake is, so I say Temecula because I'm about 10-15 minutes away from Temecula, just so that they have an idea of where.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nRight right. Gotcha. So Gosh, we met through a mutual - a few mutual friends actually, with Eleuthera Lish, of course, wonderful Eleuthera, who you do a lot of work with actually, yeah?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes, yes, my work with Eleuthera. She is the executive director of Soteria, which provides safe spaces and intervention, early intervention, and prevention for sexual assault and just creates safety in nontraditional settings. So, she is the executive director of that, and I am the clinical director. So, we've collaborated on some amazing projects, like offering safe spaces at Coachella and Stagecoach. And we recently did a research project, kind of working with those this year at Mardi Gras, to look at potentially establishing safe spaces in the future. So just definitely large-scale nontraditional settings of being able to provide that emotional safety.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, absolutely. Yeah. I've been in the background with Soteria. for a while.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYeah, I mean, you know that. Sure. I know, you're very -\n\nHeather Newman\n\nTotally. It's been fun watching what you two are doing, and the rest of the team as well. So, I've always been like, Ooh, it's great to see how things kind of keep evolving. Because Mardi Gras, gosh, right in the middle of sort of the beginnings of our pandemic that we're in the middle of - I bet that was interesting on like a gazillion levels. Having been there for that.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nIt was fascinating. Especially because it definitely, personally impacted us. Yeah. So Eleuthera and I stayed together in the hotel there. And she had just come from Seattle. So, we stayed together for about three or four days. I was not very familiar with the pandemic and what was going on. So, we were all over the place. We were in so many - we worked with fire department, we worked with emergency responders, we went to the sober tanks, we were in the middle, we worked with Red Cross. So, we were definitely behind the scenes with the FBI and really kind of collaborating in safety settings and not fully aware of the dynamics. And then when we went back Eleuthera was ill. And so, what we found was that she said, she called me, and it was almost humorous. They asked her, so have you been in close contact with anyone else? Because you may have contracted it before you even went to New Orleans. And she said, No, no, just my husband. And then she thought about and she said, Wait, I was in bed with Chevonna. And they were like, wait, what? So, wait, let me explain.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nThat's funny. Yeah, I know. I share a bed, hotel rooms with my girlfriends, people I work with all the time. And you know what I mean? You don't even think about it. You're like, yeah, of course, we're saving money. And that's what we do.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nIt just sounded like a weird thing to say. I was in bed with Chevonna and then, so maybe - (laughing)\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, yeah, no, I went to a fairly large gathering that first weekend in March in Joshua Tree for a friend's birthday, and yeah, it was interesting. You know, I don't think any of us, for sure had it, and I don't know how many people got tested to see if they had it or not. But people flew in from all over, and it was one of those before we all kind of knew what was happening, you know? And now we're in not so good times around all of that.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYeah. What I've been what I've been thinking about and I was kind of a quote that I've been that's just been on my spirit lately is that um, I just typed it out yesterday, because it just was it was kind of it was running through my head and I was like, I have to get this out. The world is rocking. The world is rocking, and there's no way for us to not be swayed.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nBecause the entire world is rocking. If we're alive in this time, we're going to be swayed. But it's important that we have to be actually intentional about making sure that we don't fall.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, Right. Yeah. I like that. I mean, sometimes you got to get steady with some friends and some family.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes, yes. Hold on to some somebody or something else that can be your rock to kind of hold you up because yeah,\n\nHeather Newman\n\nAbsolutely. Yeah. I like that metaphor a lot, because it is, it's wiggly. I mean, the world is always moving and stuff, but right now it's so - I don't know. I'm sure you're probably talking about that kind of stuff in what you do with your therapy and everything too. I mean, this is a time there's noise and trauma and. Are you super busy right now? I would assume so.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nExtraordinarily. So, my practice is fuller than it's ever been. But additionally, two nights a week I work out of a hospital emergency room as a psychiatric liaison. And so, if someone were to come into the emergency room for a medical issue, obviously. But what they find in assessing them is that their medical issue has any kind of emotional or psychiatric foundation, then what the psychiatric liaison does is goes in and assesses what's going to be the appropriate kind of discharge or disposition plan. So, we do a thorough psychiatric evaluation, and then we collaborate with the doctors, the nurses, the entire team to figure out okay, so now once they're medically clear what should happen? And so, there's been a significant increase in suicide attempts over this time, because of the fact that people are struggling, they're struggling, they don't have their standard coping skills, their coping mechanisms. A lot of job loss, relationship loss, that isolation has meant increased drug and alcohol use. All of that has kind of played into a lot of people that I'm seeing.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, that makes sense. I want to I want to circle back. Where are you from originally?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nLA! I'm an LA girl. Absolutely.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nOkay, okay, maybe I did know that. But okay. Have you been other places for school or anything like that?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nI did. I was born and raised in Los Angeles. Undergrad, I went to UCLA and then for grad school, my husband and I had the opportunity to go to Illinois. And so, we took the kids there. He worked for Trader Joe's and he was promoting with Trader Joe's because they were expanding to the Midwest and East Coast. So he helped kind of start that expansion in the Midwest, and we moved there and I got my master's there, and he moved up in the ranks and became a manager at the Trader Joe's in the Midwest, and we raised our kids there for about six and a half, seven years.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nOkay, cool. Yeah. Where were you in Illinois?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nThe Northwest suburbs of Chicago. So, a little town called Arlington Heights.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nNo way. I went to high school Wheaton.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nNo way! No way. I went to grad school in Schaumburg.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nOh, get out of town. My dad used to run the Schomburg JC Penney. He was the manager of the JC Penney in Schaumburg.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes! Look at that. I love the Midwest. I feel like the people I met there were so much more authentic. Like, what we realize is it was family. When you meet people in Los Angeles, it's very surface. I find.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nIt's very surface. But the people we met in Illinois, they're family and we still have relationships. It was beautiful. It was a beautiful experience.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nThat's so funny. Yeah, I was like where? I was like, I am divorced, but I my extended family from my divorce, but they live in Arlington Heights, funnily enough. I've been to Arlington Heights many times. My dad worked at JC Penney's, and was a manager. And so, every time he got promoted, we got moved. And so, we were in Michigan, Indiana, and then Illinois, and I got to go to high school all four years in Wheaton. So that was a big deal. Then I went to a year of Illinois State University and then popped out west to Seattle to finish up at U dub.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nWow, so Seattle? Is that where you met Eleuthera?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYes and no. We met later. We have a mutual friend Julia Francis, actually. And that's kind of how we met but funnily enough Eleuthera lived in Sebastopol. I've lived in Sebastopol. Like there were just all these weird funny like I did theater in Seattle. She went to Cornish like, yeah. So, it was one of those destiny like at some point, we're going to intersect, and we finally did. And then working on Into Action and We Rise with everybody, you know, getting to know the whole crew down here too was super cool.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nAre you in? You're in LA. You said you're in like the LA area right now, right?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, I live in Marina Del Rey. So over here on the Westside. I love it down here. I lived in Seattle for 10 years and then Sebastopol up in North Bay. So yeah, I really like LA, but I got a lot of family and friends up in Seattle too. So yeah, that's cool. So, you got so got your MBA and you're raising kids. And then what brought you back to California?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nWell, I got my master's in Illinois. I started practicing there and raising kids. Right as I was getting ready to graduate - because we had three children. And so right as I was getting ready to graduate, I unexpectedly expected our fourth blessing, okay. Yeah, right before grad school, right before the into grad school. So, we were like, Okay. All right. So, I graduated, and I started my career, and of course he's, you know, opening stores in Lake Zurich and Palatine, and just opening all these stores in Chicago area. And it came down to us needing to be parents and build a career at the same time. So, if someone wasn't feeling well, and I'm like, Well, I'm building a career and he's like, well, I'm the breadwinner. So, we're like, who takes off? We didn't have any family. We had some friends, but how much can you impose on those friends that feel like family before they become estranged associates?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nLike No and NO.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nSo, we're like, I think we need some family. With four kids and two very ambitious parents, I think we need family support. And made us decided to come back. And then it's interesting because we didn't come back to Los Angeles because we were thinking - you've been in Arlington Heights. Our little suburbanites would have had complete shock. So, we came back to another small town - Canyon Lake. Our parents had some retirement property there. And we just came back to their house in Canyon Lake and we've been there.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nThat's awesome. Yeah, yeah, definitely. That's Arlington Heights to sort of like LA would definitely be a bit of a jolt.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nBe traumatic. Yes, traumatic.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYes. Oh, my goodness. And with your practice, will you tell our listeners a little bit about your practice and what you do as well?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nSure, well, I'm a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist. And as I said, therapy is my gift. Really, I feel like it's my calling and so it's my honor to serve others. And in that honor, I kind of had to find my niche or it found me because people with the most hurt were led to me. For whatever reason I've been able to hold space with them and partner with them towards their healing. So, I work with individuals. It could be a four-year-old who needs play therapy due to grief or an adult who's just trying to find their way in life, or a young adult or male relationships, communication, self-esteem. But I even work with like severe trauma. I partner with some organizations that support human trafficking eradication. So, I treat the human trafficking survivors as well as working with the staff on how to deal with that vicarious trauma of working with the survivors as well.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, great. Yeah, I think some people don't always realize that as a first line worker, I don't even know what you want to call it, maybe a better word than I do. But just when you're of service,\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes, when you're directly in the thick of it,\n\nHeather Newman\n\nIn the mix, right? As a therapist or a doctor or nurse or whatever, it's not just like I go do my job and I'm not affected by it, right? So, self-care, I think, too, and how do you deal with that and let go of that kind of stuff. So that's the kind of thing you're doing with people like that, right?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes, absolutely. Because you have to have a process to release it. Because if we're not, if you don't take that time to nurture your own soul and you're not whole, then you're going to try to support someone else while you're fully wounded. And it's not as effective. It's not as effective because you're seeing through the lens of your wound. You're seeing through the lens of your own pain instead of being able to fully connect with that person.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, it's almost like in relationships where I like the 20 minute to half hour transition between work and not work, you know?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYeah. Yes. And I like that you said that because I even do that in therapy. I might dig into something heavy and then we jump out and maybe have humor. And then we dig in deep and then we jump out. But I think having that heaviness is just too much for any human being to just stay. One of the women that I work with that has some significant trauma, she calls it leaning in. She'll say, you know what, sometimes I'll lean a little bit into my grief. But then I sometimes I can't lean in. So, I'll say, I'll tell her Hey, we’re gonna lean in a little bit, and then I promise we'll lean out. So, we have to be able to lean out.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, for sure. And I think right now, to me life is a big roller coaster in a puzzle anyway. Sometimes you're WHAAA! And sometimes you're like, Oh my gosh, hanging on with one hand, and other times Both hands on. I just feel like people right now in general are just tired, and also just too much I don't know what to do, I don't know where to focus. Between COVID and George Floyd and everything that's been, all this stuff, and I'm like, What? Like, one thing maybe? One thing hope? I don't know.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nIt is heavy. Like I said, the world is rocking, and trying to figure out - really the goal is to try to find what we do with that emotion.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nOnce we feel it, Okay, so I need some purpose. I can't just sit and stew in it. I've been doing a lot of training on the impact of the global health pandemic as well as what I call this global awakening, of this justice awakening. It's heavy, but it's also a huge opportunity. And so, but what we are finding is that anxiety, depression, and PTSD. People who already struggle with those things. So, anxiety they already have. Their baseline is worrisome thoughts, right? Depression baseline is sad thoughts, PTSD, of course, there's been some kind of trauma. So, people who are already in those categories or struggle with that, it's getting by being inundated with everything that's going on in the world, those can be worse. Those symptoms can be worse. But the thing that's powerful now is people who never struggled with anxiety, depression, or even like, trauma triggers are now experiencing it for the first time and they're like, Whoa, what is this? I've never had heart palpitations. I've never had a panic attack. I've never - What is this? This is a new. And so, it's unfamiliar. And giving yourself permission to know that if the world has changed around you it's going to eventually change you. So just like we said, the world is rocking. We're gonna sway. Don't let yourself fall. Realize it's okay to rock. Don't be mad at yourself for swaying like what's wrong with me? Why am I rocking back and forth? The world is rocking. You're on the earth. It's gonna be gonna affect you. It's okay.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, yeah, I know. Everybody not takes it down a notch, but just give yourself a break maybe, you know. A little bit. I'm seeing a lot with a lot of friends and people that are just like, Whoa, you know? So, you probably do a lot of that for yourself, right? Sort of that, I need to like, so I can have my family and my husband and all of those things. You know, do that separation for yourself.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nI have to. I have to. A couple weeks ago. I think it was just two weeks ago, I was feeling - I've been working 70 to 80 hours a week. Between my practice being completely full, the hospital job, training contracts and contracts with other I have about three or four other contracts with other organizations. Just I was feeling heavy. So, I just was like what do I need? I had to assess myself: Chevonna, what do you need? I needed the ocean and I needed my family. So, I contacted - now my children are adults. I only have one that's not an adult. But I've texted everybody in the family and said Weekend beach house vacation - we're going. And I just found an Airbnb on the beach. I booked it for two days, well three days and two nights, and I reserved it and said I'll be there. I hope you guys all can come on out. I need ocean, I need air, and I need you. And so, we had, it was just an impromptu family getaway and it was so good for my soul. I don't know I assume it was good for their souls too, but I'm being selfish here. I needed that.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, yeah. I read you know, I read, and does it relate to the blog post you wrote about the cups?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nOh yes.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nI read that I thought that was cool. Will you tell everybody about that, and we'll make sure to put that in the show notes as well.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nOh, about the cups - my three cups. Oh, my goodness.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nAnd the languages. I love the love languages.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes, my love - One of the most powerful things that I did learn about is love languages, and I didn't learn that until well into my marriage. Well into my marriage. And so, for those who are not familiar with the concept of love languages, the belief is that there are five primary love languages that we speak. And that when we speak that language is the way we not only give, we receive and give love. So, for example, the five proposed love languages are words of affirmation, which is just telling someone you care about them. Acts of service is doing something for someone. Gifts, it can be as small as a small treat or as big as a diamond ring. Quality time and physical touch. And physical touch is not necessarily it can be non-sexual touch - hugs cuddles, just physical touch. So, my love language, what I learned after about seven years of marriage when I discovered this theory, is that my love language is words of affirmation. I score very high on words of affirmation and physical touch, I'm cuddly. Now my husband, he scored lowest on words of affirmation. And so, what he realizes that he loves to show his love. And so, what I realized is a lot of times that maybe he'd be wanting to show it - and gifts. So, he'd be wanting to show me his love through gifts or through doing stuff for me and I'd be looking for that compliment. Like, tell me I'm pretty or that the dress looks good or my button looks good under those jeans. You know, and he's like, But I watched your car and I brought you coffee. So, we learned that and I, for the life of me, I never knew that gifts matter to him. We have been together. We had kids; we have been together all these years. And when I saw that I said, I think this must be wrong. He said no, when you and the kids are gone all day, and maybe I was at work all day and you come home and say, Hey, I know you really like these potato chips and I bought you these chips while we were at the store because I thought about you. He's like, that really matters to me. I'm like chips?? Or he's like - All the things I do for you and you care about a Snickers? He's like That matters to me. That was groundbreaking. That was great for our relationship.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, I think I discovered it too. Not so long ago. And it's for husbands and wives and partners or whatever. But I think having your mom do it is super interesting too. Like, everybody in your family because it applies. And if you can figure that, I've heard of families doing those things, and they're all like, I had no idea that you were like, but it makes sense. Don't you think that people do, like you were saying, they do what they want? Like they do to others what they want done to them. I guess as far as -\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nThe example is for my daughter She is not emotionally expressive at all, and when I actually discovered that they had it for adolescents was around the time (she's now 25) but it was around the time she was a middle schooler and Ooh, I was like, either she hates me or...? It was really a tough time in our relationship. I was grasping for straws. Please Lord, I need something. Show me what to do. And so, I had her take it, and because I would always text her these long flowy messages. Like that was when cell phones were new, and she had a razor. She had a pink flip phone razor. She was in middle school. Yes! And she was IT. And I will text her these messages about how I love her and she's my angel but she's my only girl and I just believe in her and how like she's beautiful and all this stuff and I get back KAY.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nWhat? Kay.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nOh yeah. So, I'm like All right. But when she took the survey, like almost 90% was acts of service. And I realized that almost every morning my daughter - because everybody knows that I start my day with a cup of coffee. Almost every morning she would make me like a slice of toast and a cup of coffee. And she wouldn't make a big deal out of it - she'd say Mom I made your coffee, or Mom I got your stuff out of the car for you because I know you're tired. She just would always do-little considerate things for me. And I thought that she didn't care about me because she wasn't sending me back flowy lovey emotional mushy texts. But she had been she Showing me her love for me, and that was so powerful. It really brought tears to my eyes and I'm like she's been telling me she loved me all this time. And then I realized, okay, I haven't been telling her I love her in the way she would receive it. Because she may have been thinking like, dang, she never does anything nice or considerate for me. She's just always telling me how pretty I am. Or how smart and powerful I am. And she's like, I don't care about that, right?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nThat's so funny. Yeah, I loved your article about that because I definitely relate to that. And the cups too. Wil you talk about the cups part?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nThe love cups. Yes. I have to refresh my memory, because I wrote that a long time ago.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nOh, you did. Okay.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nOh yes.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nI think it was the love languages that sort of caught my eye, and then I was like, Ooh I want to read the rest of that?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nSo, I talked about the spiritual cup, the interpersonal cup, and then the personal cup. So, the spiritual cup, I'm going to actually read if you don't mind.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nPlease do.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nOkay, so the spiritual cup is that agape love. So, for me my faith is my primary source of strength. And so, I give out so much of myself that I have to make sure that I'm filling my spiritual cup to stay grounded, to stay effective. To stay effective to be able to give. So, I achieve that through kind of prayer and meditation, scripture, listening to music. And that kind of gets my cup full to be able to give out and to pour out to others. But then there's the interpersonal cup: my love for my family and friends. I have to have that. I have to be connected to those people that I love and whether it's my husband or whether it's my kids, or my girlfriends, my sisterhood, it means the most to me. The saddest thing in the world that I ever heard - one of the saddest things - is when I hear women say, I don't have girlfriends. I don't have that. I don't get along with other women. I'm like, Girl!\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYou know what you are missing? Something about a sisterhood bond that can feed your soul in a way that no other relationship can.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nAgreed.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nMan!\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, and there's a lot of that. There's a lot of that where it's like, I only get along with men or whatever. And it's like, huh?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nExactly.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nI think people are missing out for sure if they're not cultivating those relationships. And if we don't, we get to where we're fighting against each other. You know? Like that base, I'm jealous of you. The chemicals in our body that are like, We try to get the best sperm. Ah, you know?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nDo you have a core sisterhood that you're connected to?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, absolutely. I do. Yeah. And that happened I would say for me a little bit later in my life. I always had a core set of friends and also, I don't have children and so I think the other thing for me going through my life was that when people went off and had kids, my ex-husband and I kind of had friends that were either single or it was gay couples or it was like it wasn't the people who went off to have children you know. So that was sort of interesting friend group. That happened for a while, like when we were younger, when everybody was babies and then after college is when for me that really started, that connection of sisterhood, for sure.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nAnd what you're mentioning is really powerful. I'm glad you mentioned that with the interpersonal cup because our circles do change. And mind you even though it does make me sad to hear people say, Oh, I don't have girlfriends. It is important to recognize that not everybody's meant to be in every season of your life.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYes. Agreed.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nI heard a quote recently. I did a training with Pepperdine. I co-presented with two other speakers and one of the other speakers said, not everybody is well or healed enough to be in the front seat of your car. And I was like, oh my gosh. And so, it made me think about the fact that it's not that that person is bad, or you wish them ill intent, but some people are not well enough, and I thought about it, okay. There has to be a level of wellness and mutual support and love for them to be in the front seat of your car. And then there are some people who are just in your life. You know, I don't know about you, but I have some family members, they're still in the car. I mean, they're there. They might be in a trunk in the back seat... Or in the Way Back! ... but they're in a car. I haven't decided to kick them out of the vehicle yet. They're in the car. But they're not well enough to be in the front seat and that's okay. I still love them. But there are some people who have just had to get out. It's okay, they just have had to Get out of the vehicle, because my car is going in a certain direction and maybe they didn't want to go that way. They weren't kind of on that path. So, like, hey, let me let you out so you can get to your particular destination. And I love you. Yes, and I didn't even think about the perspective of they have to be well enough to be in the front seat because you will share the load. You will go back and forth. Oh my gosh, look at that. We could write a whole book around that statement. I need to get her name and number. I just need to get her information so I can quote her - make sure I give her the credit, but I have a whole lot that I can write around that not everybody is well or healed enough to be in the front seat of your car.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah. I think that is an amazing analogy. I've never heard that before. I think that's so cool. Well, and it's also like, you know what? When you're in a car, you want to share the load of the driving and the responsibility and all that stuff. And when somebody is sleeping, or, you know, every other thing that maybe you don't want while you're on your road trip, that's hard too you know. And then people get mad sometimes. They're like, Well, I'm not important to you anymore, and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. And it's not that. It's just that, you know, sometimes it's distance. Sometimes it's you don't live next to each other or whatever. Just things change. Yeah, it is interesting who's in the front seat and who's in the other. I like that a lot. Yeah, or your navigator. You know? So interesting. Yeah. I had someone also say to me, he's actually a tarot card reader. And he said to me, he was like, you know, you're probably in a lot of people's first ring of a phone call if something goes down. You probably are too, you know?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYeah.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nLike clients, family, but also extended because of what do for a living, right? And he said to me, he was like, you know, he was like, maybe you need to give pause and know who your inner ring is for your like immediate responses. Your folks, your honey, or whatever. And then out and maybe you don't necessarily have to be the first person of all of these people, because when they don't get a hold of you, they will they will try number two, number three, number four. And maybe that's ok.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes, yes, that is really important - being able to consecrate that time. And what helped me to realize that was, what I found was when I would pour out so much to other people, the people who were closest to me who were on the front seat of my car weren't getting the best of me. And I realized I had to save the best for them. I have to say the good stuff for them. They deserve the good stuff. Yes, they deserve the good stuff. Like even something as simple as sometimes the way we would talk to - my pastor said something in a sermon. He was talking about how we will talk to others better than we'll talk to our family. And I was thinking, hmm, if I'm out in public and I need somebody to hand me something or throw something away, I may say, Hey, could you please throw that away from me? But if I'm talking to my kids, it's like, hey, throw this away. And I thought about it like, Oh! Why am I treating other people with more kindness and respect than I treat the people who are closest to me? And that really shifted my energy and it let me realize they deserve my best.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah. I don't know what it was, something I saw, where the moms on the phone. And she's like, (sweet) Hi, Judy. Yes, of course. Of course, I'll bring that pie and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. She hangs up the phone and she's like, (angry/yelling) Like I said, God dammit!\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nThat is true. That but that doesn't - mind you, I have failed in that department many times. I specialize in working with adolescents, but ooh, each of my kids during that adolescent phase, I was not the best mom to them. And I tell people all the time, it's so funny when people come in, I say look, especially because I'm in a community that's relatively small. And like Arlington Heights was like point 1% African American and that was me and my kids. (laughing) We were that point 1%. Canyon Lake is similar, right? And so, people know if they come in and do therapy with me, they know that there's some cute little brown faces around they have the last name Gaylor, which is not common, and they may belong to me. It's very likely that they belong to me. And I tell them, do not judge me. Do not judge me by my children. They're amazing. But just because I am a therapist doesn't mean I'm perfect. Doesn't mean I'm a perfect parent, doesn't mean I'm a perfect partner, doesn't mean I'm a perfect person. Don't expect that just because I offer healing to other people and emotional support to other people that I don't have meltdowns myself.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah. Trying to get it right, right? And whatever right means. Words like normal and right kind of bug me.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nExactly!\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYou know, just try to be your best, I guess. Do your best.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes! Trying to be our best. Trying to grow. Trying to be our best. Trying to be the best friend, trying to be the best person. And goes to the third, the personal cup, like that self-love. Because I love travel and adventure. I love being able to read a good book. You know, what fills your personal cup? What do you love to do? Like what makes you just feel your best personally?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nI think travel definitely has been one in my life. I love writing. I love to be honest. To write stories. I love a good book, too. I really love reading and learning. And then I collect art museums. If I would have taken more time in school, I would have done an art minor. Just I love art.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nWow, that's awesome.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah. So those kinds of - and getting outside. For sure.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nWhen can you tell? Like when is your radar - When does your alarm go off that lets you know that at least one of these cups is feeling kind of empty? What's your telltale sign or some of your telltale signs?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nI think when I get angry about like, wanting to exercise or something, you know what I mean? Like I know things that are good for me and then I'm like, I don't want to do that. I don't feel like it. And then I'm like, well, if you're acting like that, that's actually what you need to be doing.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nOh, that's powerful!\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, And when I get angry about certain things, I tend to write about them instead of just - make it into a learning moment you know? I've read a lot of books, like going through a divorce and moving to a new city, and I've done a lot of wonderful reading about things that I wish I would have read eons ago. Like there's a Codependence No More, I think is a really great book.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nMm Hmm! I recommend it all the time.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, that was an enlightening book for me, and I love - I have the journal. There's a daily journal. And I really like that and I kind of use it over and over again. And I write in it sort of overtime and stuff. But that I think, because I think everybody's got a little bit of codependent and a little bit of narcissist in them, depending, and we have that sort of scale, right? And sometimes it flips, depending on who you're with. So that kind of to me was a big breakthrough. And taking care of myself. I'm very high energy and I put myself last and I know that, and I think that's affected my relationships. If you aren't taking care of yourself. It's RuPaul right? If you aren't gonna love yourself, how the hell are you gonna love anybody else?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nBecause you become a martyr and you become resentful.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, yeah, and yeah. And other people, I just don't like that either. Take care of yourself, whether it's by working too much or, you know I watch other folks who are dealing with addictions. With not just having an addiction, but it's dealing with somebody that has one, you know? It's a lot. I've seen parents or friends or whatever, that tear their hair out of their head, because they're like, I love this person. I'm trying to help. I don't know what to do, and it's exhausting. So, I think I try to identify the cups and I like talking about things. I'm very, very verbal that way. And also, I try to ask inquisitive questions as like a manager of people. Not just How are you feeling? But like trying to do like a scale of one to five. Like, how are you feeling? And we do it that way. Yeah, that's a good question.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nI'm sure that insight comes in handy at work, with leading teams for sure. With communication styles and the inside. And all of that is very valuable for leading a team and makes them feel like they can trust you because they feel connected and heard.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, I try. I try. I mean, I think you get to a certain age too. I don't know, maybe you find this, I feel like there's like, I dropped in kind of in my 40s, you know? In a different way than I was in my 30s. It was kind of like, It's all about me and all this stuff. And I'm kind of like, Yeah, it's about me, but it's about me raising other people up and bringing people along because I've been helped along the way, and I keep going, Oh my god, am I really 48? When did that happen? You know? And you're the adult in the room.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYeah, 40s was - when I passed that threshold, that was actually exciting for me because I realized that although I had significantly changed, obviously, I was more confident in my 40s than I was in my 20s because I was just comfortable with - I'm more comfortable with who I am. And I just stopped caring as much about other people's opinions. And that was so liberating in my 40s. That was the biggest transition of my 40s.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, I agree with that completely. For me, too. Yeah. I mean you still care about some, but I feel like some of that imposter syndrome and some of that other stuff kind of goes away, depending on what you feel is success. For you, for your job, it's about having a good number of clients. You do so many things is what I'm trying to get to that get to. And that feeds you, I would imagine, in different ways.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nIt does. Every role feeds me in different ways. And when I was in undergrad and grad school, I looked at all my textbooks. And every single psychology textbook was based on a theory of an older white male. Every theory, every image. And I said, there's emotional healing that needs to happen for the entire world, but that's not reflected or represented in these books. And I was absolutely determined to change that. And so, by changing that, the way to change that is just to walk in my purpose, and I literally put myself out there in every capacity that I can. If there is a way for me to go and face forward and make a change. I do. And sometimes when I'm tired, and I want to give up, actually the other people who are watching me - I had someone call me about an opportunity, and I was in a car with my youngest, my 15-year-old. And I was just feeling already overwhelmed. That was supposed to be my off day and I was on a business call. And he happened to be in the car on my off day, and I'm taking care of business and the person was telling me, Hey, I've really been talking you up but I think there's some great opportunities that are gonna come down the pipeline for you. I'm really excited to collaborate with you on some projects. And when we hung up, I almost started to tear up and I was like, I don't think I can take on, although that sounds so exciting. And my son was like, what's wrong? I'm like, I don't have space for any more projects. I don't think I have any more to give. And he checked me immediately. He said, Mom, you always say that you want to be the absolute best, that you want to be the greatest and you want to do the most. You think that you can do that by saying you're tired, or that you don't want to, or you don't have more room, or you can't do anymore? He's like, you got to figure out how to make it work. If you want to be the best, then you got to be willing to do the work. (laughing)\n\nHeather Newman\n\nAnd you're like, Well, I did something right there!\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nAll right, but what about you? I'm your mom. He's like, I'm 15! All right! You got to do the work. He starts giving me the speech. Do you think Oprah said she can't take another series on or another part on another project? You think Oprah? I'm like Oprah has a team.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nLove it. Oh, yeah. When people throw our Oprah or Beyonce at you, you're like Okay, they like they have a few people helping them by the way. But that's all right.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nExactly. Publicists, team. They're not going home to clean toilets after speaking.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nThe point is there though, right?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYeah, I get it. I got it. I felt supported. I felt like it wouldn't be taking from him to walk in that purpose. So, it does heal me, it feeds me. It makes me feel like I'm making an impact. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. But it can feel overwhelming. I'm the president of our local chapter of the statewide California marriage and family therapists. We have local chapters and this year I'm serving in the chapter. And being emotionally heavy, being definitely the racial minority, and having to lead a team of other clinicians that sometimes struggle with understanding inequality and inequity and injustice and the impact, especially because of in this area, limited exposure. Yesterday, I was supposed to kind of lead my team and we had to have our board meeting and everything, and I wasn't, I didn't want to. I didn't want to be the leader. I didn't want to be the black leader with the burden of making sure that everybody is aware of the fight of the black people in the world, especially in a clinical setting. I didn't want to. But I realized that this is what I pray for. To be able to have an impact and make a change from a leadership perspective. So how can I make an impact and then not want to do it?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nI think you're allowed to have both feelings.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes. To have those feelings and still just keep pushing. To be able to feel like I don't want to, but I know I've to and I'm called to. So, let me see what I need to do to fuel myself to do it.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you for doing it - one. Because it is - in conversations and reading and some of it for me like, and I say it from a place of, you know, I'm sitting in a really nice apartment, I have a great job and all of that, and where I was dropped into the world with the privilege I have, but I also see people and sometimes I'm like, I don't really want to talk to you unless you've like gone to read these three books and watched a couple of movies about this because I can't have this conversation.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nIt's exhausting! It's exhausting, but then the change can't come without it.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, without conversation. Without connection, without you know, the change can't come without that. And that sometimes it feels like a heavy, heavy task, I want to say burden, but not necessarily a burden. I remember when we were in Illinois. We were there and in Arlington Heights, and my one of my first jobs was they had an after-school program. And so, before and after school, so I supervised the after-school program and I had all these like little high schoolers that would come and help with the elementary schoolers at the elementary school. They'd do the arts and crafts and I oversee - it was kind of like a Boys and Girls Club type thing, but on the elementary school campus. This cute sweet 18-year-old staff, she said, like, in the middle of the year, she said, you know, you guys are the first black family I've ever met or seen in real life. Well, she's like, ever, I've never ever, ever seen a black family in real life. And I thought, honestly, I thought, first of all, how awesome it is for her to have met us. What a great teaching opportunity. So, it goes along with it. This is heavy, like Dang. So, if we mess up then she's like, Hey, Black families suck. (laughing) I knew just one.... Hope you don't screw up, right? Oh, my goodness. Wow. No pressure!\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nAlso, what a great opportunity and how grateful I was for her to feel comfortable enough with me to disclose that. And it was just such a great relationship and such a great connection. So, through the exposure we make the change, the conversations, right?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nAbsolutely. Yeah. We must, we have to, and it's one of the things you know? I wanted to ask you about - I’m excited to, I haven't read it yet, but I want to read your book. I was looking at The Emerging Healer, adding insight and impact to your mental health work. And it struck me I was like, I think everybody should probably read that, especially if you're in a position of management or whenever you're dealing with people, right? I mean, that's a layer.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes! It's the book, also I thought about changing the title, the subtitle at least, because it gives the impression that it is just for mental health workers. But there's a level - what it is it's for people who have insight or who are seeking insight to go a little deeper, right? Because what I do is, I teach people - I'm very transparent about my story. So, I use a narrative approach. So, I transparently share my story, interwoven with clinical insight, interwoven with kind of tools that people can use to get better connected to other people. So, each chapter has a blend of my personal story, how my personal story impacted me professionally, and then here are some tips and tools that you can use to apply in everyday life.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nLove it.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nAnd then it ends with questions. So, like there are bullet points that are for like, if you are a therapist, do this. Because so many therapists would say, I went to school, and I got out of school, and then I sat with a person who came to me for their support and their healing and I had no idea what to do. Because all that theory and textbook and reading doesn't prepare you for someone who comes to you with heavy pain and is like, Oh. So, I give really concrete tools. And then there's also a processing question for anyone. Like, for example, one of the chapters is called What's in a name? So, I talk about where my name came from, and just kind of tell the story about my name, and my feelings about my name coming up, right? And so, I talk about the fact that I really didn't like the name. I thought it was something - it was so different - and I thought it was, I don't know, stereotypical. And then it was spelled all different and I always had to explain how it was spelled, and it was just frustrating. And then I include an article by Ayesha Curry, where she was talking about her name as well and how her parents, her father, loved the song Isn't she lovely? by Stevie Wonder. And the daughter's name is Ayesha that he was singing about. So, she talks about where her name came from and how she learned to appreciate it. So, I also tell people that when you ask the person, where did their name come from? You're asking about them. So, I go on to the power of words. When you speak over a person, the significance of their name is spoken over them every time you say their name. Right? Then also, even if a person doesn't know where their story came from, that's telling of their identity. Like where did your name come from?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nMy name Heather comes from my mom and dad. They wanted to name me Sean or Heidi. Started out there. And then I believe there's some Scottish and Irish in my family. And so, Heather came from that. So yeah.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nSo, what I heard from that is every time they spoke Heather, they spoke heritage, and they spoke love.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nBecause they were so intentional about picking your name that they mulled over several name choices, which means that they really care significantly about you. Then they wanted to give you something that was indicative of the heritage of your family meaning. So, every time they spoke your name, they spoke those things over you. And I'd imagine that you carry that love and that heritage with you throughout your lifetime.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah. Yeah, I've never heard that. But yes, yes. I love it.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nSo, there's power in that. So now if you're a therapist, and you're fresh out of grad school, and you have no idea what to say, you're sitting there and you're stuck. Like literally stuck on stupid like uh, What do I say to this person? Ask them, Hey so where does your name come from?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nInteresting.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nJust that conversation can ease into like, if they say, I don't know, or whatever, wherever it goes, you can follow their lead and in guide that session, based upon just that question.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nRight, and that tells you a lot about their family, their parents, how they feel about their parents, how they you know,\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nEven if they say I was born in the system, I don't know, I never knew my parents. Okay, tell me more. Or I was named after my father and he's in jail and I struggle with that. Whatever it is, it's so telling.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, it's fascinating. I love that. Because when you're working and you're your manager or you're any of that stuff, sometimes you're How do I start a conversation with somebody I don't know, trying to get to know them and get to know me. I can't wait to read this. Yeah, that's super cool. Interesting. I can probably talk to you for another hour or two or four or 16. But maybe I'll take us into our last question. Moments and sparks. Moments in one's life that change us and I'm wondering if you could share with our listeners if you can pick one or maybe a couple - person place thing but quote - that really seat you in who you are in this moment in today?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nOh, this moment today. Wow, that's a big one. Wow that's pretty powerful. Okay, so one more time, what was the question one more time, because my brain went everywhere, I'm like Oh I can answer so many different ways.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, you know its moments, sparks, and its people, it's a book, the answers are all over the place all the time. Something that you would say, you know what? That moment, that thing, that really when I sit and think about sort of today where things are in the world with me, all of that, something that either changed you or sparked something in the way you think?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nWhat I would say, honestly, I'm gonna use a very funny story to that seems so surfacy, but it's going to kind of tie into more depth, Okay? So... lately and when I was growing up, I've always had kind of thick hair. Not super long but big kind of bouncy hair for me. And it's been something that I love. Now as I got older, over the last couple of years, my hair started thinning and I wear my braids a lot. It started thinning and I had resigned to the fact that maybe you know, it's hereditary. I'm getting older, it's hormones, it's genetics, I just have to accept this. However, over the past six months, I've been intentionally pouring love and light into myself, mind body and soul, including my hair. The products, the way I talk to my hair and my body. The way I talk to myself, the way I nurture that area of myself. And today I left the salon and she's like Your hair is back to where it was. It's actually thicker. My stylist is like it's thicker, the curl pattern is healthier than it was before. And she's like I'm really loving the way your hair - and I said wow, what you feed will grow. Like no matter what, don't let any of the - if you nurture something, it will grow. So, what I got today was if I nurture something in my soul, it will grow, and God is a restorer for me. Spiritually God is a restorer. So, there is restoration possible in anything that looks bad. So, it just resonated with me, like my husband and I when we were a young couple, I bought a home. And in the housing crisis, we lost that home. And it was devastating to me, but what I got in the message from my hair being restored was that home ownership and property management can be restored. That Investment can be restored, that relationships can be restored. Nothing that appears dead is gone. There's always that hope for restoration if I desire that, and I pour into it. So, I know that may sound silly, but really it was a profound message for me in this season of restoration in every single area.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nI love that that. Yes.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nRestoration is possible.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nRestoration and feeding your soul, and the power of positive thinking and words and intention.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes, yes.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nAnd you know, hair is a big deal. (laughing) Let's be real.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nI just was not willing to accept the fact that oh, this is just something I need to resign to. This is something I just need to accept. Mind you, there are gonna be areas where acceptance needs to come. But that was not something I was willing to accept. I wanted to see if there was a way for me to change it. And I think that for ourselves and our lives, knowing that one of the things that I love to live by is You can heal. So, I'd love to have people know that if you're in a season that is hurting or difficult financially, physically, emotionally, interpersonally, medically, you can heal. I believe that we can all heal. I just released this. I'll send it to you, the five-step blueprint to healing\n\nHeather Newman\n\nOkay, cool.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nAnd it gives a five-step blueprint. I write out a five-step blueprint to what it looks like to heal. Because I believe that Everybody can heal. It will take work, but everybody can heal.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, I can't wait to see that. That's awesome. I'm with you. I say yes, yes.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYes, yes, yes. Yes. So good. Oh, well, I'm going to put The Emerging Healer link there, and your website is chevonna.com. We'll put that in there. Yes, and see, so I didn't like the name. And then at the end I realized with this unique naming, unique spelling, I get chevonna.com. I mean, who gets their name as their website? Like Thank you. So, I have to thank my mom since she named me. And I've mentioned that in the story, that I learned to love it and appreciate the uniqueness of it, and it has been advantageous for me professionally. However, although there is so much depth, so much vulnerability, so many life lessons, and so much power in my book, and I share pieces of my mom story and my father story and just all of that, and the book is really powerful and engaging and entertaining and in depth. And my mom heard the whole story and at the end she says, Hmm, so you don't like your name? (laughing) Is that the Only thing you got out of my book?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nNothing like our moms, to give us What? What?\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nThat one thing.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nThat would be my mom too. Oh my gosh, that's hilarious. Oh, you are so wonderful. Thank you for what you do in the world for so many. I know you. I know because I know I know you and I and I know of you through lots of friends, and I know how much you reach out and touch people and change people's lives. So, thank you for what you do. Really.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nThank you for having me so much, and for giving me this platform. And I can't wait to see you face to face and give you a big old school hug.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nI know. I know. I'm like yes, please. Sometime soon for sure. So okay, well, thank you so much again. I really appreciate it.\n\nChevonna Gaylor\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nAll right, bye. Everybody, that has been another episode of The Mavens Do It Better podcast, and here is to another big beautiful day on this blue spinning sphere. Thanks everybody. Bye. The original music on this podcast was created by Jesse Case.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWelcome to the Mavens Do It Better podcast. And now your host, Heather Newman.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nHey everybody, here we go. Here's another episode of The Mavens Do It Better podcast, where we interview extraordinary experts who bring a light to our world. And today I have a fantastic wonderful colleague and friend on, Kristin Juel, who I met back in the holiday times. Been a while but thank you for being on. Yes. Hello! And where are you coming to us from today? Beautiful behind you -\n\nKristin Juel\n\nAww, thanks. Yeah, live from Hollywood, where we are currently quarantined.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYes, and I am currently quarantined in Marina Del Rey, in my HQ as well. We were just talking a little bit before we got started. This is the first podcast I'm recording since the Coronavirus broke out, so we were talking a little bit about that. And I'm happy to be talking to another beautiful human being. How are you doing? What's going on for you?\n\nKristin Juel\n\nYeah, I'm good. I mean, these times are strange. And so obviously I say that just to start and preface everything, but yeah, it feels good. I, probably like you, I've been remote for 15 years. More than that - since forever. And I've had clients for so long that you know, sometimes you go to their office and you work from there. Sometimes you have an office, so sometimes you're long term on something. The last seven years since I started this company, we've all worked remotely. We have to, so it's been great to like, I feel like we're just positioned for this. It's business as usual for the most part, with the exception of the fact that obviously, no one has toilet paper\n\nHeather Newman\n\nRight, absolutely. I've worked from home since 2006 as well, so setup, you know, I've got three screens and the microphone, like all that stuff. But, you know, I get my juice from (not the siren that's going by which, you know what, that's life right?) In the Big City. But from going to in-person events, right? Because I do a lot of speaking and all of that stuff. So, I'm home home, and then I go and I'm like, Woohoo, and then I come home and I'm in my Netflix action and whatever else. Will you tell everybody a little bit about your business, because that's why we're here - to talk about that. But I bet you get the same thing a little bit. You know, where you work from home and then you're out with musicians and everything that you do. Well, tell everybody about Juel Concepts. It's great.\n\nKristin Juel\n\nYeah, I totally agree. I know exactly what you I mean. It's almost like you come home to rejuvenate so that you can go out and be, you know, on, frankly,\n\nHeather Newman\n\nCompletely. Y\n\nKristin Juel\n\nAnd I have always been very extroverted, seemingly yourself as well. But I have recently, well not recently but about eight years ago or 10 years ago, I started looking into a lot of things that what that means, and it turns out even if you are extroverted, you still need to have that place where you go to where you can, like, calm down and reconnect with yourself. So, I've been very, very diligent about that over the last few years too, so. Okay, so where do I start? Juel Concepts is a company I founded seven years ago. And it came at a time when I was very fortunate to have been working at a major company for eight years, called Kaiser Permanente. It's a health care company.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nI'm a member. Exactly. I think half state of California is a Kaiser member, so that was a very good position whereas a national person, I was brought in to do brand strategy. I focused on consumer and member engagement. Again, Kaiser is a system that you have membership. So, I got to do great projects for eight years, where I designed - we went from the thrive campaign through to the lifecycle of a member. So, like from the cradle to the grave, it is what it is, but every single touch point. And when I got there, so I did not want this job. I had already had a background in advertising and brand strategy for I think at that point, it had been 17 or 18 years. Or no - 15 years. And I didn't want a job. I was working at TiVo. I was doing consulting contracts and I really loved it, but they came in pretty hot and it was a really great opportunity. So, I took it and thought, well, I'll be there for a year. And it was eight years later. During that time, I really pivoted my career from just the advertising and strategy part to including music as a component for what I did, And it had always been there. I had always wanted to do something with music I loved. I did some freelance projects for MCA for a woman named James Simon in the 90s, mid 90s, late 90s when I was in California, and I had loved it so much, but they really couldn't afford the overhead of a person like me to be honest with you. So, I backed off of it and stayed in advertising. So, when I left, after the time with Kaiser, I basically was like, let me see what I can do using music and we instituted use of music and I built the business case. We built the business case as a team, for use of music for engagement and better health, but also, anytime that you could do consumer facing events, we found that it was really popular to put together an activation around music, where it was like sometimes if we sponsored the Nike women's marathon, we would also do an activation that was like When they zig we zag. So, it would be like, we would have massage therapy components for the marathon, as opposed to talking about running. It's obvious conversation. We wanted to have unique conversation. So, the whole point was build the brand through the discovery of something, revealing something unique and unexpected. Cool.\n\nKristin Juel\n\nAnd that's a brand strategy. That's what we do. So, I left the company. After eight years, I was offered a package during a restructure and I was like, That's good. And I was like I love you. Thank you so much. We good here? Okay, cool. No harm no foul. I'm awesome... out. So, I started this company literally the day I got the indication this was happening. So, it's seven years, officially on March 13.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nCongratulations!\n\nKristin Juel\n\nYeah, thank you. It was fun. The first year was the hardest thing I think I'd ever done. Well, that's not true. It got harder. The first year was hard just to get your footing because you don't know what you don't know until you don't know it, right? You're in front of someone you're like, I don't know. I think I can do this. And, you know, no one really - I'll say it's not an inclusive industry. But then again, I worked in 35 different categories. I can't think of many that are - no one really likes to see someone new coming in and shaking things up. So, I was lucky at Kaiser again, I got to spend a lot of time at TiVo and Kaiser with innovation. So, the sense of iterative design and sometimes disruptive but mostly iterative, it feels very, data driven pieces, informing - we called it art and science - you couldn't - you Shouldn't create a brand with just the science. It's can be very challenging to come from that area, and there are many brands that do it and they discount and they do things that don't necessarily help them in the long run to create what we like to do, which is the value that you hold in the consumers heart and soul. Like what that's about. So the first year I did some projects, but most of the time, I was just trying to figure out like, I met with the Grammys, and I met with Live Nation, and everyone was like, you should work here and you should work there. And then it turns out someone told me the industry is like a burning building, and you're trying to run in when everyone's running out. So, you should really just create something yourself. It was great advice, a little hard to hear. But I've had those moments over my career anyway. So, I took it, I took the Dharma head on, and went right for it. Started with management and then realized that the holes that artists face are actually really good, best suited for me to help fill them with marketing too. And I have that background as well.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, for sure. Wow. So, an auspicious beginning. Yeah, I'll say, yeah. It took a while. It took a year to figure out what we were up to. But then once it got started, it was like, Okay, and then it took a couple more years to figure out how to make money. And then that's still a challenge. It's definitely about the hustle. Being a business owner, you know, I've been doing it for a long time as well. 2006 for me, and you're always looking for the next project and working really hard. And yeah, my business came out of me leaving something else as well. You know. l remember, I think we had this conversation when we met and I was like, you find connections with strong people who have had to reinvent themselves and I feel like that's why I look at even the artists that I work with, some of them have been doing that and I'm here for that. Anytime someone needs to reinspire, reinvent, reconfigure, course correct - all of that. It's just, I think it's a very rare opportunity that people get in life. And you should really go for it like that. Well, why not? Completely. No, I agree with you hundred percent. As you know, I had Shelly Piken on the podcast not too long ago. She's just so great. We had so much fun and thank you for that. When we all met same night you know? And what is the name of that hotel? My brain... Oh, the Sunset Marquis. Sunset Marquis - I was like wait a minute what is it?\n\nKristin Juel\n\nThat was your first time there, right?\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYes, it was my first time. You know, I'm still newish to LA and so it's cool to go to something that's so iconic. And the Morrison Hotel, the gallery. Just being there. I was like, Okay, wow. Yeah, it was an incredible night. That was a really good night. It was a fun one. And yeah, Shelley's a really great example of someone I can - You want her to succeed. You know what I mean? Because she's already a legend. You know, She's got it. Literally nothing to prove. I had to introduce her at this showcase, and I was just like, There's just nothing left to prove. I think it's just a matter of when she finally decided she wanted to leave, like I did. But what legacy are you leaving behind? You know, it's one thing to have helped somebody. It's another thing to do it yourself. Right? She wrote the lyrics and gave people their stories. Now she's telling her own story through her own lens, and I'm honored to get to partner with her on all of that. And it was a really fun interview I got to listen to. Yeah, we were trying to get ready and we'd met a little earlier. We're like, I need to zhuzh and so I need another hour. And we're doing video, so big shout out to Shelly.\n\nKristin Juel\n\nWe love her. She's an artist that we get to work with. Releasing her album this summer. And it's been a journey with that, and definitely now even more than ever.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, no kidding. Well, and you have worked with Hamish Anderson for a really long time. Oh, yeah. Since that first year actually. Yeah, he came in straight away. He already had a different manager and they brought me in to help with some brand strategy. And the former manager was a little different background. Fortunately, I had spent some time on a personal level with some people in the industry. You never realize - I think that was probably my biggest learning curve, knowing how to ask people for help, or who to ask for help. If you can ask for help. And so, for the first few years I didn't, but opportunities would happen to me. Things would happen. When I was with Hamish for instance. Actually, in general, it was just amazing that the universe would give me these little tiny things that you just go, Oh, oh, that's what that feels like. So, like one night, I was working with a band whose lead singer was the basis for Hamish. But I was friends with a person named Gary Clark Jr, who is a great blues guitarist who I adore. And I was early on that tip because of Kaiser truthfully, because I was always looking for artists who were trying to do new things because we would do events and things. So, I was like, let's see what this guy's about. I went to see his show. I think it was actually a Sunset Marquis show that he did when he was there. And then I saw him at South by Southwest, and I had seen him a couple times. And then we got to be friends. And one night I'm in New York with that band who had introduced me to Hamish, and I started working with. And we're in New York doing the show all of us together. And Hamish's show was the next night but the band he was working with was Blizzard the night before, and it had been my birthday. And I remember being like all in a celebratory mode and whatever. Everybody came out to the piano bar for the show for Antigalactics and we were like, Oh, this is great. And then it was a terrible show. The sound was horrible. It was like the worst night I've ever had. Actually, Hamish left early because of that because he was like, whatever, and I was like going fine. I'm just a friend. And then then I walk outside the bar and Gary's standing on the street in New York and I was like, What are you doing? He's like, what are you doing? Then we just started talking and as the night progressed, I said Listen, if you want to blow some 22-year-old kid's mind from Australia, come to the Rockwood tomorrow. And he did. He showed up and Hamish's mind was literally like blown. It was like, How did this happen? Because I never even told him I knew Gary. There was no reason. One thing I don't do is I don't over promise and under deliver. Yeah, sure. Absolutely.\n\nKristin Juel\n\nSo that happened. And it was a very funny moment for everybody to realize like, that's again an indication where that night they met, they bonded, they had a good time. I had a great time. Hung with Gary for a while, it's just a really fun night and fast forward to five years later, I finally wrote an email to his manager and I was like, Listen, the work that he's doing is so important and Hamish and I would love to support it in any way, this last album that he did. And then the next day, we had an offer to do the tour and hustle in Australia for Hamish, so you know, if it took five years, these things don't happen overnight. You kind of figure out what you can do, and people use that word hustle all the time. I just think of it as being proactive. I think it used to be a negative connotation. And now I'm like, Well, I'm just gonna let it be. It is what it is. I call it hustle. I think it's proactive. It's one of the tenets of brand. I'm not going to wait for someone to tell me it's okay to do it. I'm gonna figure it out.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, I agree with you. I mean, that word hustle is, well, first of all, I think learning the hustle in the YMCA with my parents back in the day, that was super fun. So, my connotation to the hustle is that, but it is, like hustle or productive. I was talking to somebody earlier that she was talking about, you know, just saying yes, as well. Every project that I got, in my early my career in technology, in and around Microsoft, was because I was like, Yeah, I'll do that! Didn't necessarily know what I was doing, but I said yes. And you know, 20 years later, I have all this experience doing all kinds of things because I said yes to them. Right? Or after it or asked the question, Can I do that? Will you be in my advertisement or will you play my show or whatever? Right. And I think that's the thing about people in small business and people like us who are consultants - That you have to be like that. You have to be proactive or you're never going to get anything. No, for sure. I think you don't wait for people to literally I'd rather, and this might have been a Kaiser thing, but I did learn to ask for forgiveness versus permission. And I'm a problem solver. That's why my career works so well. For me, I thought it worked well, because I would get a request. And they don't know what they're asking for. So, you have to figure it out. None of this has changed. We're all in the same boat. But when you're a consultant, you hear what people are saying, you process the information, and you go back to them with an opportunity or a solution. So, you know, when I hear hustle, I'm like, well, that just means that people thought it was like a like side project or something like that. A really easy thing for you to you know, bring in, but a lot of the work that we do isn't easy, you know what I mean? And again, even Hamish going that tour with Gary, you know it was five years to the day in the making when we were on that thing and that and those five years, he had to spend the time building Hamish. You don't just get to do (I mean some people probably do) but you might be ill equipped to pay it off. So even though perhaps it could have started sooner, I'm happy it happened when it did because Hamish was prepared for that role. He knew what he was doing, and it was very rewarding experience altogether for him, and it definitely moved the needle. But again, had we done it five years sooner, when we had an opening up for BB King even, I think back to all that and it was like that was a huge deal too. So, each of the artists, you know, they all kind of come into us in different phases of their career. And you know, Hamish was truly baby band when we met. Like radio, but nothing really was spinning. And so, he's like the biggest case study of what you can do if you're consistent in your messaging. Yeah, I think it is that that took five years. I mean, you probably have this too in your career. There's a quote, the quote is like, They might not remember what you say, but they remember how you made - ... how you make them feel. Yeah. And I have people who come out of the woodwork that I worked with in like 2005 or 2006. And literally, they're like, the last time I was with you was when we were on show site in a bar in New Orleans. And what are you doing right now? Are you still doing your stuff? And it happens a lot. And it's one of those things it's like, I'm so thankful for that. Also keeping up with people and stuff, but sometimes like something like that comes out of the blue and it changes everything, right? Yeah, and that's amazing. It comes from the Universe. You know, like if you if you put it out there, I mean, I am a big believer that intention gets you everywhere you want to be. You have to believe it. You have to go for it. If you have hesitation in your mind, it's not coming to you. And I know that maybe it's a little esoteric, and perhaps even Californian of me to say, but I'm an original East Coast person who has the values of work hard, and these rewards come to you. But if you're working hard at like, you know, something that's not serving you, well, then, you know, you're really building a career in an area that's going to never be good for you. So, I feel like all of our artists and myself included, we all need to be a litmus test for what feels right. You know, music in general should be a feeling-based thing. The analytics and the algorithms that go into it can change the conversation, obviously, shed light on things that are challenges or opportunities, but I do feel like the work that we do is better served when it's authentic to you. You are the person, you're the only one that can really make it that way. You know? Yeah, I'm with you, I believe 100% in what I like to call the Woo. You know, I mean, to me that putting things out in the universe, saying positive things, talking about what you want and the authenticity thing. Yeah, I believe that 100% I love that that's the way you work with your clients. I mean, that shines through in artists as well, right? That's why people connect so deeply with certain artists and others. They're like, Oh, they're cool. And they may be a megastar. But there's some people that people just go (sigh), and it's because they're authentic, and they share a story. And sometimes it's the GRRRR and sometimes it the YAY. And you mentioned east coast. I want to talk origin story. Let's talk about where you grew up and where you come from, and all that. Yeah, no, I totally am. I was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Ah, ok!\n\nKristin Juel\n\nMy first house, my parents lived in a place called Jessup, Pennsylvania. I'm Italian descent I know you can tell right? But my mom was Italian. So, my family was basically like we were raised in an Italian community. So, I got to be this really grounding. It was very fun. And we moved to the Poconos after, because I was 13, I think it was - no 10. I was 10. And I went to school in the Poconos. And then right before I graduated high school, my mother passed away. So that was pretty transformative for me. She had been sick with lung cancer for nine months. And during that time, that was like my senior year and like, what are you doing with your life? And I remember I applied to Pepperdine, and I applied to SMU and NYU, and I did okay. I got into them. The one I really wanted to go to Pepperdine, but that was obviously when my mom died. My dad was like, maybe you could stay closer. So, I went to NYU. And I was very fortunate to have been able to do that. I learned a lot about myself because when you're 18 and you go to New York and you have - I'd only been there like twice before. I had no clue what I was doing. I used to say I had the word Evian on my forehead, which is naive spelled backwards. And just walk around like this. I'm like this Pennsylvania thing, like what? Yeah, that didn't last long. That shine - held at gunpoint my freshman year, like within three months. Yeah lots of lots of turnover. I had, like 16 roommates. A big turnover at NYU. My freshman year moved off campus into the East Village and had the time of my life for a couple years.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah.\n\nKristin Juel\n\nIt's funny because when you look back on it, it was like Blues Traveler Spin Doctors, Joan Osborne. They were all the bands at the time. I'm dating myself, but I don't care. I'm literally gonna be 50 this month and I'm like Whatever, I'm here. My mom died at 46 so all of my life has just been like that thrown into Let's celebrate every day. I'm just yoloing. I've been doing that - I didn't even know it was a term. So, yeah, John Popper and all those guys were doing all these great music things and I was super into the scene. Then Mary J. Blige came out. It was all music like, I love music, I love music. Then my internship, I worked for Linda Ellerbee, and I did a Moveable Feast. It was a documentary with her. That was eye opening. She actually references me in one of her books. And I never knew people could write a book and actually put your name in it and then tell a story that was not really true, which is kind of funny too, because like, she just took liberties with things. She wasn't even in the room with the thing she was talking about. But that was a big like, What is this? People can do that. And then I did the York Times for an internship and I hated it. I thought for sure I would love it. I hated it. I was like, Oh, God, like now not enough thought. I wanted to be a broadcast journalist. And when I was working with Linda, she was like, Look at your face. There isn't an ethnic bone in your face. And she was right. The times were changing and she was like you're not gonna - so she was very honest with me and that's why I'm saying like people are always like, I think when you know I think people sometimes they tell you things and it hurts you to hear it, but I had to become thicker skinned and resilient. And so, I did it - I just went through it whatever - heard it, absorbed it, processed it, and then of course corrected again. So, by the time I guess it was probably on my third internship. I did Wells. Rich, and Greene in New York, which was an ad agency that was on top of the world. It was like best in the planet. Mary Wells was the iconic female advertising executive. Met - literally walked in and was like, Oh, these are my crazies. Like I've arrived. This is it. Yeah, like my first day I shamefully went to go steal a cigarette from someone, and I heard this voice like I saw that, and it was like the person who I'm still friends with (John Ray). He was an incredible creative director. He's like, I won't tell you let me give you a tattoo. And I was like, WHAT? So, I spent my lunch break with him tattooing my arm. I was like, I love this place. But you know, it's just so creative. Everything was super creative. And yeah, had a great time. And I wound up doing that for like I said, so long. It was 12 and a half years advertising side, and client side 13 years.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nOh wow.\n\nKristin Juel\n\nBut the agencies I worked for after that, it was like Chiat Day. So basically, after New York I moved to LA and started working. Well actually, the Jonathan club was the first one because I was the editor of their newsletter, the magazine. That was pretty interesting. And it taught me again, it's a members only men's club. No women were allowed.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nWhat club was that?\n\nKristin Juel\n\nIt's called the Jonathan Club, downtown, and they have a thing of the beach too. So, I'm sure that they've amended that. I think they started letting women in while I was there, but it was like, no women, so that was that. Then I went back into advertising. I was so psyched to do that. So, I started back in there. I wound up going through the (other ad agencies), and it was like a denser Young and Rubicam. It's a bunch of murders that happened. And then the tail end of it, it was Chiat Day. And Chiat Day was a really great experience because it was you know, Nissan, and we did an iconic campaign called Mr. Kay and I met a woman named Chris Bianchi after I left there. She then eventually became the president of Chiat Day, so I got to see strong women in advertising. Really cool stuff. And I really liked it a lot. One point I left advertising to go do interactive, and everyone thought I was nuts. And it was before the internet came out, right and then like, we're all like using floppy disks, doing advertising, trying to make it digital. Hysterical, right? Like all the stuff you think back. You're like, Oh my god, and I have a lot of it. When I look back, I'm like this is mind blowing. So, I left and went to this interactive company. We worked on Mercedes Benz and Disney launches. And that lasted a year. And then I was back in advertising. So, it was fun. I moved to New York. Cliff Freeman and partners moved me to New York. You might know Chiat Day because they have like Apple. They did the original campaign for that aired one time during the Superbowl when they launched Apple. But you might not know Cliff Freeman until I tell you these things. So, he wrote \"Sometimes you feel like a nut. Sometimes you don't.\"\n\nHeather Newman\n\nWow.\n\nKristin Juel\n\nYeah. So he was that guy. He also did the Wendy's \"Where's the beef\" campaign? So, do you remember that? So, I flew to New York to meet with him. And I just remember sitting in the meeting and I did new business. So, I would help with the pitches and whatever needed to be done, said yes all the time. Whatever it takes, let's do it. So, he sits in this meeting and he has his baseball bat and just kept striking it on the floor. Really nice Southern guy. So nice. I think it might have been from Memphis. I'm not sure. And just looked at him and said, Is this like an intimidation tactic? Because like, it's working. So anyway, he used to come in and be like, is this funny? And we had a wall of like, Cliff-isms. You know, it's like, flatulence plus kids equals funny. He was very about like, the humor. Yeah, we did some great stuff there too. And then I moved over to another agency, then 911 happened. Then I moved back to LA because I was like, Okay, I missed the sun. I missed this guy. If I'm gonna have to do this, everybody became so stressed out all the time. And I was like, Yeah, no, I think I'm done with New York. I had done it twice, like moved from LA back to New York and then I was like, Okay, I'm cool. So yeah, I've been here now 18 years. And I love it. I think LA is not for everybody - in the first six months I cried myself to sleep and I'm like, What have I done? I always felt like there was a New Yorker, I think it was, a cartoon that I remember seeing at one point and I'm not going to get it right but it was like in New York when people say fuck you Oh wait sorry, can I curse? In New York they mean Have a nice day. And in LA when they say Have a nice day, they meant Fuck you. So, it was like, nobody was really what they thought you know? I think that that's changed over time as well. But back in the late 80s, early 90s it was a tough town. It was a very strange town. I moved right in time for the Rodney King riots. I was there in New York at Tompkins Square one. So, like I said, resilience, you know, that's a big thing. You got to get through it.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah. Yeah, absolutely. Wow, I always learn so much about people on these podcasts. I'm like, That's amazing. And Gosh, having so much experience in the advertising world too. Actually, I worked in an agency once, in Seattle, and loved it. And there is a vibe to that that is really fun. Because a lot of times it's a lot of money. And, you know, you have to really be on point, and words are so important, like little bits and chunks of things are so important, right?\n\nKristin Juel\n\nGetting into like kernel of something, that's like you could say, Yeah, we got that. I know what that campaign is. To me, those are the things that you go, Wow, that just levels everything to just like a phrase, you know what I mean? And I love finding good unique positioning.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nKristin Juel\n\nThat's the important piece.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah that's yummy. I love it. So, there's a lot of folks who listen who are technologists in technology and all of that, and for what you do for your business, you're doing a lot of marketing and brand building. What are some tools and things that you love and use every day if you don't mind sharing?\n\nKristin Juel\n\nYeah, so I would say - if any of our artists are listening, I can hear the eye rolls. Asana, I live and breathe by Asana. It is a project management tool. And it's a lifesaver for me because I have, I have run - when I was at Kaiser, I used to run 85 projects at a time. I would be involved in the RACI diagrams where it would be like responsible, accountable, consulted or informed. I was involved with so many things and I like staying sharp, right? So, I didn't mind that part. So now, you know, again, like as you're dealing with so many different things, plus there's a learning curve and all that stuff, Asana became my best friend because you can put reference information in there, you can have historical things. So, you never forget what you've done. There's no excuse. I always tell our interns when you come on, you'll see you can see a thin slice across everything just by going through the Asana projects and our emails. And the Asana projects, I put everything I can in there - metrics, things that worked, things that didn't work, anything I can think of, because I'm not sure I'm going to be able to find it later. So, Asana's the number one tool. I'd say that's my favorite. And, you know, obviously, slack is a good one, but it's a lot harder to get people to use slack. I don't know why - just a lot harder. So, our group tends to not use it as much. And I love analytics. So, every day I do - we used to do our own dashboards but now I just use a lot of the Google Sheets and stuff like that, the suites obviously. But I chart metrics pretty much every day, which is a tracking tool for artists to understand how their work is performing in market. Yeah, and I love the back ends of Spotify and Apple Music. And my favorite favorite metric is Shazam. I absolutely love Shazam. That's the one company I would have killed to work for. And when I met with them, like, Why do I have to move to New York? I don't want to do that. But I really loved what they did. I think they've done a great job creating an ecosystem for artists, that's all in one place for the discovery process.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nyeah, super cool. Shelley and I talked a little bit about this, and I've talked to a couple of different folks who are in the music industry on the podcast, and just the changes over time, from radio, like we referenced and all of that, going into the digital. Maybe what's one of the biggest things for an artist of today, sort of expectations of like when you put an album out, are you going to get paid? Are you gonna make it big? Are you gonna make a million dollars?\n\nKristin Juel\n\nYeah, I think you give what you get, right? So really, if you're in it and you're investing your time and you're putting your content out and you're doing a really good job keeping people engaged in your world and what you're doing, Yeah. I think you can move mountains that way. I think being consistent in a message, being consistent in what you're doing, your sound, is important. I think that you will not earn money likely, like they always tell you, it's like any business. You can't expect that you're going to start your business and within five months, you're gonna have a sustainable, scalable income coming in. You have to plan for it and prep for it. And you got to do a lot of work to get those people to care and come into you. And once they come in, you got to do even more work to get them to stay. Because you know, you can't just throw it, you can't just drop a single. People who tell me, I just have to put something out. I'm just gonna put something out. I'm like, you know, go for it. You do you. I can't even get involved because I always tell people yeah, if you did it in your house, and it didn't cost you anything, Yes, sure. Okay, fine. But like really if it's a great sound you should get behind your own work somehow and market it properly and make sure that you give it time and seed the market. So, most of it's like in Hamish's case and Ruby and Soul Phonics case, I was a huge fan of Ruby's I was telling Gary about her, and I was buying her vinyl. I had never seen her live that I knew. I knew her sound because the DJs were telling me. It was a distribution deal, but I didn't know it at the time, right? So, it's like, I'm a consumer before I was in music, and you're very like, oh, there's all these different ways you can get music to you. When the vinyl went away, and the physical went away and digital became the thing, again, I was like, still should be able to make money because when I was at TiVo, we had a $13 subscription. That's what TiVo costs, right, at that time. And yet, within that $13, I had money to market if we needed to. We didn't do a lot of it, did some circulars, but my point was, and at Kaiser too, so no matter if it's like $13 or $100 or $1,000 a month, there's always in that a line item for marketing. And that area, that's where I think money can go back to artists more. But in the current phasing of it, like how it's working now, if you do a good job and you build your brand, and I do use radio, and I believe in radio tremendously. I think anybody who discounts radio is clearly they're not dealing with the kind of artists that I'm dealing with AAA I think is a really great discovery platform and we love it. So yeah, big fan of that discovery and radio. But also, the streaming platforms, you eventually can get to a place where it can help offset some of your costs. It's never gonna - not never - it takes a while for it to get to a place where you can actually earn, like a lot. And I think most of the time that I've seen people really have a financial benefit is when they go into the Sync realm. So, once you have an established brand, and you're doing shows and you're consistent with your releases, and music supervisors start to hear your name, you can start to get the requests for your songs. And that's where you will see a payoff, and it's smaller than it ever has been too. It's like there are people who are willing to do it for free. And I'm sure a lot of people get their starts that way and they don't have to pay for music, but like a company like Kaiser, we always paid for music. And we went from using Bob Dylan and the Bee Gees to a Michelle Branch used for an advertisement, you know, in commercials. And it was because at some point you realize the emerging artists you get more bang for your buck even too. Bob Dylan in the Bee Gees didn't care if we use their thing on a Medicare spot, but Michelle Branch definitely would have liked it. And for what it's worth, Sync is another one of those areas that I've seen the evolution where people were telling me No, I don't want my song on your playlist. Because Kaiser you know, it's like health care. No, I don't want to. And I'm like, oh, but it's a health platform that we're working on and they were like I still don't care. So, I was told no. And now though you see these artists that are like, I just want the brands to get my songs out there. So, you see that evolution. Once you let your guard down and you allow yourself to earn in those areas, it really can be consistent for you. So, I'm lucky that all of my artists can, most of them have done something in Sync.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, that's super cool. And you're working mostly with emerging artists or people who are maybe doing something that they haven't done in a while. And it's management and marketing for musicians, artists, bands, all of that.\n\nKristin Juel\n\nYeah. And anything adjacent, so we've also done, you know, support for other brands as well that are in the space, too. I mean, it's definitely more right now on the artist side, but it's always good to have a good balance.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYeah, absolutely. And so, talking about the pandemic a little bit, having folks really, like so many people are sharing things and going live and all of that. Have some of your artists done some of those things?\n\nKristin Juel\n\nYeah and I think that's great. I mean, some of them are more leaned into it than others. We're definitely trying to figure out how do I make an eight-piece band sound... right? Like that's impossible to do. So, they'll have to dupe over or something like that and do this social distancing. You know, Hamish did a livestream, Shelly did a live stream, Jessica did a live stream. So, everyone's sort of figuring it out. We're actually working very hard right now on a platform because again, I didn't really get into this just to be a manager. I wanted to get into this to understand music and technology, and where the brands fit and all that stuff, too. So, there's a really big hole in the market right now for artists to deliver their content, and actually have a potential monetization piece for it. I don't know. There are things like Patreon and there used to be Pledge music for when you released music. You know, we've used Pledge and we had a bad experience at the end there. So, I think what we're trying to figure out now is how we can turn Juel Concepts into a media portal that allows our artists to all house their own content in there. And then we offer it up to people and we say, Listen, you know, if you have $1 a month, or you have $10, or whatever it is, especially in today's climate, you know, right to the artists. And then you get to interact directly with them. So, like, for instance, if she does smoothies, she could do a smoothie thing with you. Like, it's like creating a sense of community, within our own artists, as well as the fan bases of those artists. But then I'd like to use it as a proof of concept for ideas that come in, where we're like, oh, this would be really good, this might be a TV show idea. Or this might be something we could do there, and then improve the concept, and then bring it to like a kwibi or whatever it is. My goal is to start creating content that actually is interesting for other brands and other artist companies, music companies to do something. So, we're gonna so we're gonna start kicking that off, it's the 16th I think? with a livestream for just Juel Concept artists. And then we'll open up the portal, hopefully shortly after that with a couple content pieces and like a calendar section. And try and use this time to start deconstructing and reconstructing what it could possibly look like. Because I think the worst thing we could see would be if each artist went and did their own Patreon or something during this time, because you'll be spending so much time and energy marketing that it loses - it's even what Shelley doesn't want to do. Nobody wants to be having to do marketing all the time or social media. So, I figured if Juel Concept does it, and then we port everything into it, it might be easier for everyone. And we have no idea what we're doing. But this is another one of those, like, if you plant the stake in the ground today, in a year, you'll have experience that's worthwhile somehow, one way or another. Like 10,000 hours towards something makes you an expert, right? May as well do it with something you love.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nAbsolutely. Malcolm Gladwell it up for sure. The other thing, what does your shirt say? It says Hot Buttered something, but I can't see the other part.\n\nKristin Juel\n\nHot Buttered Soul.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nOh, ok! I was like, I wonder what that says. And I've been thinking about it.\n\nKristin Juel\n\nYeah, Isaac Hayes.\n\nHeather Newman\n\nYes, totally. I was like, I love it. Awesome. That's so interesting and cool. I love that concept. I mean, it's, kind of like you bringing people together under one house, and then being able to do all kinds of things, slice and dice the content, how you would want and also help them get it out in a way that's...\n\nKristin Juel\n\nIt's in one centralized location. It's just exhausting, all of the different things that everybody's doing, and we're gonna see more. This is the thing you know. Now it's the wild wild west again. It's our favorite time. Everybody's like, out of necessity comes opportunity. So, I've been kind of Waiting for this. And again, coming into this industry, looking at the data, looking at the art and the science. This is all going to matter. You know our artists; they can perform their songs. They're legitimately talented. We're not trying to go into the - how do I say this without sounding...? If any of them wanted to be on a label, they could do it. It's not about the label. It's about the type of music that they're putting out. So, they're putting out music that we're hoping is going to last the test of time. And I think that's the piece, like when you look back on Hamish and Ruby and Jessica, Shelly, these are all every one of them. You know, you're putting out something that in 10 years, you could still listen to, right? I know like even Ruby's stuff, it's just so classically soul oriented. That's never gonna go out of style. It's just never. It will always be fashionable just because it's great music, you know what I mean? So, we do put a priority on the performance is an important piece of this and you have to be able to handle your stuff like live "
