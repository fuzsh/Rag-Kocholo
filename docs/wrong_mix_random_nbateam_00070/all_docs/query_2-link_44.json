        "text": "Mary J. Blige made headlines over the weekend with her announcement that she had received an honorary New York City high school diploma and was to attend Howard University in the fall, making her a member of the class of 2014.\n\nThe Washington Post decided to follow-up MJB’s claims with the folks at Howard:\n\nEarly Tuesday, a rep for the school declined to address Blige’s prospects at the school, noting that information about applicants and admissions is confidential. By late in the day, the university put out a statement suggesting Blige’s comments may have been somewhat premature. They were kind about it, though, praising her “resilience and dedication” to her craft: “We encourage Ms. Blige to continue her studies and welcome her consideration of Howard University in the future. We are happy to work with Ms. Blige on completing the formal process for admission.”\n\nBest of luck to you Mary!\n\nRELATED: Mary J. Blige Shows T.I. Some “Good Love” At Essence Music Festival"
