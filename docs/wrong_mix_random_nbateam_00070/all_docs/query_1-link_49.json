        "text": "Mary J. Blige is a global superstar, winning multiple Grammy awards, a BET Lifetime Achievement award, as well as garnering numerous Emmy and Oscar nominations.\n\nShe is currently starring as the ruthlessly successful businesswoman Monet Tejada in the Starz spinoff series \"Power Book II: Ghost.\"\n\nMARY J. BLIGE: On her role as 'queenpin' survivor in Starz spinoff series\n\nMORE MARY J: Documentary on singer's life in the works\n\nAdd winemaker to the Yonkers native's list of accomplishments.\n\nBlige will lead a virtual gathering to celebrate her newly launched Sun Goddess Wines at Stew Leonard's on Thursday. The name, Sun Goddess, is a homage to Blige's mother, meant to capture her memories of love for the warmth and the energy of the sun.\n\nYonkers Mayor Mike Spano declared Sept. 17 as “Mary J. Blige Day” in the childhood hometown of the music legend. Blige’s mother, Cora, and brother, Bruce, will accept the honor.\n\nThe singer, who was discovered by a record company executive when she recorded a cover of Anita Baker's \"Caught Up in the Rapture,\" at the Galleria Mall, grew up in the William A. Schlobohm Houses, one of the oldest public housing complexes in Yonkers.\n\nAt her wine event, sommelier Blake Leonard and her father, Stew Leonard Jr., will moderate a discussion with Blige on her pinot grigiot and sauvignon blanc. The wines were produced by Fantinel, a winery owned by the Fantinel family in Friuli Venezia Giulia. Sun Goddess wines will sell for under $20 at Stew Leonard’s Wines & Spirits of Yonkers and online.\n\nHow to attend\n\nThe event takes place Sept. 17 beginning at 6 p.m. A Zoom link will be provided to all participants once they have pre-registered via https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_W5yamVx1RLioquc6_HxbSQ"
