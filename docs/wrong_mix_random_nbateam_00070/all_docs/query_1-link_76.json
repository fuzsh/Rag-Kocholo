Blige, is about to host her third annual \"Strength of a Woman Festival and Summit\" throughout New York City and you might want to get the whole crew together for this electrifying family affair.\n\nThe three-day festival will include concerts, panels, and female empowerment sessions curated by an all-Black and all-women team.\n\nRECOMMENDED: A huge music festival showcasing Asian-American talent is coming to NYC\n\nMary J. Blige created the multi-day festival in partnership with PEPSI and Live Nation Urban to empower and give resources to women of color across the music, wellness, tech, beauty and financial literacy sectors.\n\n“I’m so excited to bring our Strength of a Woman Festival and Summit to my hometown, New York City, a place that has always been a huge source of inspiration for me,” the artist said in an official statement. “Having the opportunity to continue to uplift, inspire and build within my community is the reason I created this festival. [...] Nobody does it like New York, so get ready.”\n\nThe festival is going to kick off on Friday, May 10, with a jazz concert starring Robert Glasper at Blue Note in Greenwich Village.\n\nThe programming will continue on Saturday, May 11, with the Strength of a Woman Summit, an all day affair featuring keynote speakers, panels, workshops and more. The event's hosted by Jess Hilarious, comedian and co-host of The Breakfast Club, and Gia Peppers, a podcaster and entertainment journalist.\n\nThe Saturday will close out with a Coachella-level concert at Barclays Center on May 11 where Blige will perform alongside special guests 50 Cent, Jill Scott, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Lola Brooke and Funk Flex. Angie Martinez will host the event at Barclays.\n\nOn Sunday, May 12, a gospel brunch hosted by Blige at the Brooklyn Chophouse in Times Square and a gospel concert featuring The Clark Sisters at the recently renovated Brooklyn Paramount will wrap up the extravagant affair."
