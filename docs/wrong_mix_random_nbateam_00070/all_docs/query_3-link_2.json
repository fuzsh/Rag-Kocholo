        "text": "1. Evaluation Task 1 By Amr Nabeel\n\n2. In what ways does your media product use, develop or challenge forms and conventions of real media products?\n\n3. Forms and Conventions — Music — Conventions are specific characteristics for each genre of music that make the genre recognisable to the audience. This is done by using forms. Forms are the ways in which conventions are presented this can be done through: technical (editing, sound, camera angle etc…) and symbolic (mise-en-scene etc…) conventions. These characteristics help distinguish a genre to its audience, allowing it to be aimed at a specific audience and in turn sell better. For example, Pop music may use bright colours (Pink, Red, Yellow) in their music videos; whilst Grunge music would use dark colours (Black, Grey, Brown). These conventions become synonyms with the genre allowing audiences to identify the genre of music they are listening to.\n\n4. Editing Ciara’s music video for ‘I Bet’ had a similar editing technique to our music video of ‘Are You That Somebody’. They both show the artist replicated four times on each corner of the screen. By manipulating the image and replicating the artist multiple times, it connotes that she is a dominating/important person. Through my research in the R&B genre I found that women are mostly shown to be strong/powerful and important. By multiplying our artist, she dominates the screen and the audience focus only on her. This also allows for her target audience (18 - 21 year old females) to connect with her because it fits with their ideologies of female empowerment and therefore they will buy into her brand. Additionally, it subtly connotes that she is extraordinary and supernatural because she is in more than one place on the screen; this links to Dyer’s star theory paradox that an artist “must be both ordinary and extraordinary”. Like Ciara many R&B artists are synthetic, to convey this we made the digital manipulation/ editing obvious by replicating her many times on the screen. I feel that through editing we used and developed the typical conventions of the R&B genre, of women being empowered and strong; we conveyed the strong female tone, through an abstract visual technique. Ciara - I Bet Our Music Video\n\n5. Lighting The lighting in Kelly Rowland’s music video ‘Work’ and our music video are quite similar. In recent music videos especially those in the R&B genre it is a typical symbolic convention for these colours (pink/blue) to be used. The pink and blue palette connotes femininity and seduction. The symbolic conventions of using these colours hints at the neon lights in nightclubs, therefore connoting the idea of partying and going out. This appeals to the target audience (females 18 to 21 years old) who tend to go out and party. More recent R&B music videos such as those by Ariana Grande and Kelly Rowland have begun to use the blue and pink colour scheme. These music videos have become extremely popular; therefore by following a similar colour scheme to that of successful artists it will draw their audiences to watch our music video. By using similar conventions to that already used in R&B music videos Kelly Rowland - Work Our Music Video\n\n6. We found that in Beyonce’s ft. Shakira’s music video for ‘Beautiful Liar’ and our music there are close-up body shots. These close up shots of the abdomen creates an intimate connection with the audience and emphasises the artists beauty. This also connotes sexuality and is provocative which is a common characteristic of synthetics female artists in R&B who are represented as seductive and alluring. It uses the same technical convention of close up body shots that heighten the sexual of the artist. Camera Our Music VideoBeyonce ft. Shakira - Beautiful Liar\n\n7. Make-up Our Music VideoBrandy - Put It Down ft. Chris Brown Both the ‘Put It Down’ music video, by Brandy, and our music video had similar make-up. Both use beauty make-up that accentuates the artists facial features and wear bold lipstick. Brandy and our artist both wore red lipstick, red lips connote sensuality and provocativeness all of which are conventions used for female R&B artists. Females in the genre, are shown as provocative and sexy, and that is what we tried to convey through make-up. Additionally, by looking seductive it not only interests a female target audience who will try to imitate the look but also attract a secondary male audience who will be attracted to the artists’ looks. This follows Negus’s theory of synthetic artists, especially in the R&B genre, who are created by institutions in order to be consumed by audiences.\n\n8. Challenging the Conventions We challenged the convention by starting the video differently than most R&B music videos. In the R&B genre most artists are synthetic as suggested by Negus’s theory; therefore artists are constructed in order to be consumed by audience. A common way of doing this is by displaying the artist as the most important feature of the video. For example in Mariah Carey’s music video for ‘We Belong Together’ it starts of with the shot above of her looking at the camera; this establishes her as the dominant figure in the music video. We decided to challenge the convention in our music video, by showing the rapper first and only showing the singer 15 seconds into the music video. By doing this is contradicts the typical convention of primarily showcasing the artist. We found that challenging the convention offered a different dynamic to the artist by making her mysterious. On the other hand, it made her much more grand and important when she appeared on screen later on. This still maintains the synthetic quality (Negus’s Theory) of our artist as a constructed image of glamour. Mariah Carey - We Belong Together Our Music Video\n\n9. Set The set design (wheel) in Ariana Grande’s ‘Focus’ music video is similar to the wheel design in our music video. The concept of a person inside a wheel is striking visual element that is rarely seen. This connotes that the artist is avant-guard and innovative in their music video concepts. Additionally, by having the surroundings black, it requires the viewer to focus on the artist in the centre of the frame. As a result, we are drawn to her and give her attention; it also suggests that she is an important person. Conventions that make the singer the most significant feature of the music video are common in the R&B genre, this is because they are targeted for mass audiences who not only consume their music but their image; arguably, the image is the most crucial factor in a synthetic artists success. In our music video we did have a much larger wheel which the artist could stand in, this not only gave space for choreography, but is also suggests that the artist can command a large set build which consequently adds to her high status and diva persona, which the audience recognise. Our Music VideoAriana Grande - Focus\n\n10. Character Positioning The character positioning during the dancing sequence in Amerie’s music video for ‘One Thing’ resembles the character positioning in our music video. The two dancers are on either side of her in the background whilst she is in the front closer to the audience. In both cases it shows the artist as being the principal and ‘star’. The artist is represented as being a diva and more dominant than the dancers because she is in the front and centre, making her the focus of attention. By having the artist in the foreground and closer to the viewer, it makes the viewer feel as if they are present with the artist; this links with Dyer’s star theory paradox where he says that ‘an artist must be both present and absent’. This means that the artist is present in the viewers life and they feel a connection, however the artist is not physically there. The use of this convention is popular in the R&B genre because the institution want to present their artists as a strong and extravagant people, especially if they are female. Our Music VideoAmerie - One Thing\n\n11. Digipak Our Album Front CoverKelly Rowland - Talk a Good Game We can see some clear similarities between the Kelly Rowland ‘Talk a Good Game’ album front cover and our front cover. The artist is the main feature (focus) and is in the centre of the digipak; this emphasises their powerful and female empowering image. This relates to the ideology of our target audience of females (aged 18-21) who believe in the female empowerment message of our artist. It also highlights the fact that they are synthetic artist (Negus's Theory) because they are promoting themselves on their cover. We can also see that on both covers, they are looking head on at the camera and engage with the audience. Our artist is striking a strong pose that exudes her sex appeal and confidence all of which contribute to create her diva persona; which are common conventions used to represent females in the R&B genre. A difference between the two is that Kelly Rowland is behind her name on the cover, whilst our artist is in front of the cover. This suggests that our artist is recognisable and does not need her name to be recognised. Front\n\n12. Digipak Our Album Back CoverBeyonce - Dangerously in LoveMariah Carey - Rainbow Above we can see the album covers for Mariah Carey and Beyonce, they both have their backs to the camera but they look back engaging with their audience. Across all three back covers they have their back towards the audience. They pose in a seductive manner and are dressed provocatively, this attracts their predominant female target audience who appreciate their body confidence and try to imitate their style; however it also draws in a secondary male audience who are attracted to the artists’ looks. Although all three covers are similar, we challenged the convention by not having our artist look back at the audience. This connoted that our artist is mysterious and alluring which persuades her audience to find out more about her. Back\n\n13. Website We wanted to create a website that would showcase the artist and have her as the main feature. Additionally, we wanted the website to have a modern design that would be easy to use by users.\n\n14. Website Home Page We found that Mary J Blige’s home page for our website and our home page were very similar. The most obvious being was that the background kept changing, we used a gif with different images of the artist that changed in the background; meanwhile Mary J Blige’s website had the video of her latest music video as the background. This made both our websites visually striking. This plays with the convention of the R&B genre, where artists need to be new, bold and impressive. In addition, the font used is clean and easy to read on both websites; this again links in with the conventions of female R&B artist, where they are the focus. There are a lot of close-ups of the artists used on our homepage, this allowed the artist to form an intimate connection with her audience. Additionally, it is linked to Dyer’s star theory paradox where he states ‘an artist must be both present and absent’. Our artist is connecting with her audience and therefore is present, however she is not physically with them, thus ‘absent’. Mary J Blige - Home Page Our Home Page\n\n15. Website Colour Scheme Beyonce - Website Our Website We made sure that our website was bright and colourful with harmonious colours throughout. We used pinks/purples/oranges and reds because they usually connote femininity and we wanted to attract and reflect the target audience who are females aged 18-21 years old. Compared to other websites such as Beyonce’s website, our’s is much more colourful. During our research we found that many artists in the R&B genre tend to use warm tones such as browns and golds or otherwise black and white. This may be because R&B music tends to have an urban, jazz quality with a strong bass rhythm therefore bright colours would clash with the identity of the genre. However, we challenged this convention by using bright colours to represent the new generation of R&B and the different aspects of the genre which we reflected by the use of different colours on each page."
