        "text": "Mary J. Blige is a busy woman.\n\nBut recently, she’s found time to add one more title to her already impressive resume: movie producer.\n\nWith eight multi-platinum albums, nine Grammy Awards (from an incredible 38 nominations), two Academy Award nominations, and two Golden Globe nominations, among other accolades, Blige has proven that she’s a gifted, versatile artist.\n\nNow, she’s brought two of her biggest songs to the small screen.\n\nUsing her very first top ten hit, 1992’s Real Love, as an inspiration, Blige has teamed up with Lifetime to turn the song into a two-part original movie for the network.\n\nIn the first film, 18-year-old Kendra (Ajiona Alexus) sets off on her own for the first time, attending an HBCU in North Carolina. Determined to focus on her studies, Kendra finds herself falling for fellow student Ben. Despite facing numerous hardships, Kendra works hard to realize her dreams, but even though things don’t work out quite the way she anticipated, she’s hopeful for the future.\n\nIn the second installment, entitled Strength of a Woman, which jumps ahead more than 15 years, Kendra, now a successful photographer, realizes that she must reckon with the decisions she’s made for the life she thought she wanted, as she faces new challenges, especially when it comes to love.\n\nThe title Strength of a Woman comes a cut on from Blige’s 2017 album of the same name, her thirteenth studio release.\n\nExecutive producer Jordan Davis explains the evolution of the project, saying, “I'm a fan of Mary's, and she told me she wanted to [make these films] with her songs. So, she picked these two particular songs and she wanted to set [the first film] at an HBCU and wanted to talk about a woman's experience and experience of an artist.”\n\nAs for Blige’s involvement, Davis says, “She worked with us every step of the way, between the casting and the costumes and the music, and I think that you can see her spirit in the film through the whole thing.”\n\nWith Real Love is set in the ‘90s, Davis says, “[Because] it's a period piece, we had to put it in context of when the stories took place. So, with Real Love Ajiona and I had long conversations about this at the time. The experience of our character takes place in the ‘90s and so how she relates to it, how she responds to it, and how the other characters dealt with it, we were trying to stay true to what was going on for that period of time.”\n\nFor Alexus, delving into that decade was enjoyable as she says, “This is so fun for me because I always I say I'm such an old soul. I grew up on all the ‘90s stuff that you can think of.”\n\nShe adds, “Before I actually started filming, I watched a lot of Janet Jackson, like in [the movie] Poetic Justice, [other films, including Love Jones and Love & Basketball. Those were the films that I studied when filming this and I feel like you can see pieces of all that, and we definitely need that in our generation right now. “\n\nIncorporating all things ‘90s was amusing for Davis as well, as she admits. “I had a good time in the ‘90s and it was really fun to do set decoration [for the film] and look at the computers that were in the rooms and the hairstyles and everything that was going. We had a really good time doing that.”\n\nAs for what she wants viewers to gain by watching the films, especially Strength of a Woman, Alexus says, “I think there are so many things you can take from it, but in life, troubles never stopped coming your way. And I just think you're always finding strength on your journey. It never stops. So, Kendra is just the real definition of resilience in bouncing back. She's always pursuing her dreams and goals. You see her balance all of that and I think that's where you can see [her] strength for sure.”\n\nDavis agrees, adding that she sees the two films, while packed with unexpected turns, as presenting a positive message for viewers. “I think we're living through crazy times and I would like [people] to walk away from these movies and feel optimistic about themselves and about their futures. We've put a lot on [our main character] in these movies, and she finds her way out of places and goes to better places and makes good choices at difficult times. So, I’d like people to believe that there are better tomorrows and to see themselves to better places.”\n\nBringing it back to the artist whose work is the foundation for the films, Alexus points out that, “I was speaking with Mary and she sad that when she hears Real Love, it brings up a painful time in her life, but certain people, we hear it and we think of love and happiness. So sometimes what’s painful for you in your life will be an inspiration and motivation to other people. So, just learn how to find your strength and just keep pushing forward because you never know who's watching and who you're being a trailblazer for.”\n\nOffering a little more insight, Alexus says that she believes Real Love and Strength of a Woman, will help viewers to, ‘not be defeated by their journey.’\n\nShe says, “Don't be defeated, and know that whatever it is you're going through, this too shall pass.”"
