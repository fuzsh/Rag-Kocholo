Charity Edna Adams Earley, born December 5, 1917 or 1918, in Kittrell, North Carolina, (died January 13, 2002), becomes a pioneering army officer. She grew up in Columbia, South Carolina and attended the public schools of Columbia-Howard School, Waverly School, and Booker T. Washington High School, from which she graduated without ever missing a day of class. From the time she was in the fifth grade, Earley knew that she wanted to major in mathematics. She enrolled at Wilberforce University, an African-American Episcopal school in Xenia, Ohio, where she earned her BA in mathematics in 1938. Upon graduation, she returned to Columbia for four years to teach mathematics and science. Greater challenges beckoned Earley. She applied for and was eventually accepted into the first Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps-WAAC, which had been established during World War II. At the time of her entry, she did not know that the United States was at war. By the end of the war more than 4,000 African-American women had enlisted. She did realize that African-Americans had always been loyal to their country and viewed military service as being intertwined with freedom and full citizenship. Earley served in the Women’s Army Corps from July 1942 to March 1946. She moved up the ranks and became a lieutenant colonel, the highest position held by an African-American woman in the US military during World War II. She commanded the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion through its moves form Birmingham, England, to Rouen and Paris, France. This was the only group of African-American women to serve overseas during World War II. Additionally, she was a company commander and a station control and training officer. After her army years, Earley earned her MA degree in vocational psychology form Ohio State University and studied further at the University of Zurich and at the Ungian Institute of Analytical Psychology in Zurich, Switzerland. Public service was an integral part of Earley’s life. She volunteered with the Urban League, the YWCA, and the United Way of Dayton, Ohio, the United Negro College Fund, and the Black Leadership Development. She received several recognitions, including induction into the Ohio Women’s Hall of Fame. She received a Brotherhood Award from the Dayton Area Conference of Christians and Jews, a “Black Women Against the Odds” tribute to the top 100 women in African-American history and she established the Charity Edna Earley Scholarship at Wilberforce University. Her book, “One Woman’s Army,” published in 1989 and reissued in 1996, is a vivid story of her experiences and travels in the US Army. (From: Sources: Contemporary Black Biography .

As one of only six African-American students enrolled in the school of music at the time, she was not allowed to stay in the residence halls. Duke Ellington went to Evanston in 1944 and, after hearing Ms. Davis at a recital, asked her to join his band. She was soon singing alongside Joya Sherrill and Al Hibbler. She and Mr. Hibbler handled the vocals on one of the Ellington band’s best-known songs of that era, “I Ain’t Got Nothin’ but the Blues.” Ms. Davis performed with the Ellington orchestra from 1944 to 1950. As a member of a trio of female vocalists — including Ms. Sherrill and Maria Ellington Cole (no relation to Duke, later married to Nat King Cole) — she offered the maestro an opportunity to reprise something he had long relished: wordless vocalization. A major moment in her career came on Nov. 13, 1948, when she sang Billy Strayhorn’s “Lush Life,” with Strayhorn at the piano, at Carnegie Hall. “She was a classically trained coloratura,” Phil Schaap, curator of Jazz at Lincoln Center, said in an interview on Tuesday, noting that Ellington had used “the high-register female voice as instrumental color” in the middle and late 1920s. Among the best-known wordless works was “Creole Love Call,” sung by Adelaide Hall in 1927. “With Kay Davis, he returned to this practice,” including revisiting “Creole Love Call” in 1944. Mr. Schaap said “And he took a work that featured the trombone, ‘Blue Light,’ renamed it ‘Transblucency,’ and blended trombone with her highest-notes coloratura voice.” While “Transblucency” may be her signature piece in the genre, Ms. Davis recorded several other noteworthy wordless vocals — many accompanied by the renowned trombonist Lawrence Brown — including “Violet Blue,” “Minnehaha” and “On a Turquoise Cloud.”\n\nJohnny Pate, born December 5, 1923, in Chicago, Illinois, becomes a musician as a child playing the piano and tuba.

In the early ’60s, OKeh Recordsproducer/A&R director Carl Davis (Walter Jackson, Major Lance, Ted Taylor, the Opals) wanted a unique sound and enlisted Pate to write arrangements for the label. Pate and Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions first teamed in January 1963 recording the ballad “Sad Sad Girl and Boy,” which mid-charted in Cashbox magazine‘s charts. The next single, the rousing “It’s All Right,” parked at number one R&B for two weeks and hit number four pop in fall 1963; followed by “Talking about My Baby,” “I’m So Proud,” “Keep on Pushing”. The Keep on Pushing LP peaked at number eight pop in fall 1964. Pate produced and recorded most of their hits at Murray Allen‘s Universal Recording Studios in Chicago. In 1968, Pate began doing arrangements for Curtis Mayfield’s Custom label (the label’s slogan was “We’re a Winner”), whose roster included Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions and the Five Stairsteps. Pate left the label in 1972 and worked on numerous recordings including the classic 1978 quiet storm forerunner LP Words and Music by TV/movie/stage actress Lonette McKee on Warner Bros. Records. Pate also made soundtracks for films including Shaft in Africa. In 2006, TNC Records released an 80th Birthday album in tribute to Pate.
