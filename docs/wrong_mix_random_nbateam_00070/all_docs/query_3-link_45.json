        "text": "Textual Analysis - Rae Morris - Grow\n\nTextual Analysis - Rae Morris - Growstephdagg\n\nRae Morris is a British singer-songwriter who first found success through the BBC Introducing scheme and is now signed to Atlantic Records. Her song \"Grow\" has lyrics that are emotionally powerful and can resonate with young people based on their own life experiences. The music video features close-up shots that emphasize the song's emotion and shows Morris portrayed vulnerably to illustrate that it's okay to feel heartbreak. The black and white cinematography may reflect the themes of giving up and not fighting back in the lyrics. Morris' main audience is young people who can relate to the song's themes of past relationships and childhood.\n\nChloe shaw\n\nChloe shaw Westhatchmediastudies\n\nThe document introduces Chloe Shaw, a 20-year-old singer and songwriter who has experience performing live and writing her own songs. It outlines her musical career so far, including supporting other artists and performing at festivals. The document proposes using social media websites and creating an online presence to market Chloe to a wider audience and help advance her music career to \"the next level\". It envisions developing her brand through fashion and live performances to build a loyal fan base and potentially launch a clothing line.\n\nJay z presentation #Comm2F00\n\nJay z presentation #Comm2F00Stephen Nixon\n\nJay Z has found success through his music career and business ventures rather than social media presence. While he maintains Facebook and Twitter accounts, he is not very active on them. However, Jay Z has engaged his large fan base over the years through consistently releasing new music, touring, and owning businesses like Roc-A-Fella Records that promote his brand. As one of the best-selling artists of all time, Jay Z's name recognition allows him to prioritize his career over social media.\n\nWhy music videos?\n\nWhy music videos?Charlotte Jean\n\nMusic videos promote artists by showing their personality and creative ideas, which entertain viewers and help discover new music. They increase sales through views on YouTube and MTV, which previously launched careers. Videos raise popularity that leads to chart success and signing for fledgling artists like Justin Bieber. Comparing Michael Jackson and Carrie Underwood shows how videos impact exposure and sales more than just songs. Artists also benefit from synergy with films, TV, and ads, like songs featured in John Lewis and Apple commercials that boosted recognition and sales for Gabrielle Aplin and Willy Moon.\n\nCityandcolour\n\nCity and Colour is the musical project of Canadian singer-songwriter Dallas Green. He chose the name City and Colour because his name is Dallas and a city, and Green is a colour. Green is well known for his amazing singing talent and says he is happier and prouder about his recent work than anything else he has done, though he lacks confidence in himself. The band is highly active on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Soundcloud to engage with their large fan base and share their music and tour experiences.\n\nComm final\n\nEmployers viewing publicly available social media profiles of employees and job applicants may be acceptable, but insisting on access to private profiles would be an invasion of privacy. While social media has become very common, individuals are still entitled to keep some aspects of their personal lives private without just cause for intrusion. Asking for passwords to access private social media pages is akin to demanding keys to someone's home or access to their bank accounts. Rather than focusing on how someone uses social media, employers would be better served concentrating on resumes, interviews, and legitimate background checks to evaluate someone's work ethics.\n\nSocial Media Ethical Use for Finance &amp; Insurance\n\nSocial Media Ethical Use for Finance &amp; InsuranceDeborah Gonzalez, Esq.\n\nDeborah Gonzalez, Esq. gave a presentation on the ethical use of social media for those in the insurance and financial services industries. She discussed why knowing how to properly use social media is important, defined social media, and listed some major social media platforms. Gonzalez also covered why professionals in IFS use social media, applicable rules and guidelines, and the \"5 D's\" of ethical social media use. She concluded by taking questions from the audience.\n\nSlándáil Project Magazine 2015\n\nSlándáil Project Magazine 2015Victoria Macarthur\n\nSlándáil | Empowering Emergency Services through Social Media Slándáil is a European project that is investigating the use of digital media in times of natural disaster and is equipping disaster management personnel with software services for harnessing social media for better disaster response.

While Facebook claims this will improve advertising and sharing, many argue it invades users' privacy by sharing private purchasing and browsing habits without clear consent. Some users are considering closing their Facebook accounts if Beacon is not made truly optional. The new applications could generate revenue for Facebook but also risk reducing users and trust if privacy concerns are not adequately addressed.\n\nChapter6\n\nThis document contains an overview of ethics and responsibilities in public relations. It discusses how organizations and PR practitioners are judged based on ethics, social responsibility, and financial responsibility. Top management sets the ethical tone and PR often acts as the \"social conscience\" of an organization. The document also outlines categories of ethics, principles of ethical behavior, and responsibilities PR has to various stakeholders. It explores some grey areas in PR like research ethics and internal/international practices.\n\n12.2.14 webinar\n\n12.2.14 webinarSocial Media Today\n\nSo you checked out a new product on the market but decided not to buy.

Facebook saw explosive growth reaching over 400 million users. However, updates to allow sharing of personal information through the \"Open Graph\" and partner sites led to public backlash over user privacy controls. Facebook then simplified its privacy settings and allowed users more control over how their information is shared in response to these concerns. Weisfeld concluded by noting the importance of respecting user privacy and being aware of clients' privacy policies as an agency.\n\nEthical vs. Unethical Media Presentation\n\nEthical vs. Unethical Media PresentationFranky Factz\n\nThis document summarizes an ethics presentation comparing ethical and unethical media. It discusses Ethisphere, an ethical media company, and Tim Durham, an unethical media figure who conducted a Ponzi scheme. It also analyzes several large corporations for their ethical and unethical practices, including allegations of violence against union workers at Coca-Cola plants in Guatemala and Nigeria, Chevron being accused of tax evasion and paying media to limit negative coverage, and the ethical practice of Five Guys giving away free toppings compared to the unethical used game refund policies of GameStop. Works cited are provided for all sources.\n\nThe pros and cons of social media\n\nThe pros and cons of social mediaSally Loan\n\nThe document discusses the pros and cons of social media and social networking. It provides information on digital footprints, popular social networking activities among students, things to consider when using social media, and how social media can be used for education.

The conclusion emphasizes balancing innovation with engagement by using the right tools for the intended outcomes."
