        "text": "Mary J. Blige celebrated a big birthday this month, and she threw an epic party to celebrate.\n\nIn photos from the event, Mary donned a deep-V, cut-out minidress that showed off her strong legs and core.\n\nThe singer aims to exercise with her trainer at least four times a week.\n\nMary J. Blige just turned 52, and she didn‚Äôt hold back for the big occasion. The singer-songwriter modeled an epic minidress for her big night, and she was clearly feeling herself (as she should).\n\nMary casually dropped photos from the event on Instagram, and there are a slew of shots of her looking all kinds of strong and fierce. First, there are various photos of Mary in the crystal-emblazoned, deep-V minidress, showing off her seriously toned legs and abs. This is followed by a picture of Mary in a hot pink mini with a matching crystal-covered bra top, and accessorized with miles of strong legs.\n\n‚ÄúWOW!!! What a night!!! It‚Äôs nothing like partying with people you really LOVE and who LOVES you back!!!‚Äù she wrote in the caption. ‚ÄúThat energy was crazy and unmatched!!! Thank you to everyone for all the birthday LOVE!!! I‚Äôm so overjoyed and still recovering from Saturday!!! #CapricornSeason.‚Äù\n\nPeople cheered her on in the comments. ‚ÄúWhoaüî•üî•üî•,‚Äù said Method Man, while Lala Anthony commented, ‚Äúu looked gorgeous‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù\n\nHere's another peek at her birthday look:\n\nMary works hard on her physical health, and she previously told Health that she‚Äôs big on lifting weights. ‚ÄúI like to look a certain way. So I have to do what I have to do,\" she said. \"I do a lot of weights‚Äîheavy lifting. It keeps everything firm.‚Äù\n\nMary also told SELF that she aims to exercise four times a week with a trainer. ‚ÄúIt's full body,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSometimes I'll tell them, okay, well, let's concentrate on the legs, well let's concentrate on the arms, or let's go hard on the abs.‚Äù But she also makes sure to have cardio in the mix. ‚ÄúI mean, you have to train like an athlete,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is the game.‚Äù\n\nNaturally, she goes all in during performances, too, which requires some serious cardio endurance. Example A:\n\nOn the food front, Mary shared with Health that she goes big on protein and veggies. ‚ÄúI eat a lot of protein,\" she said. ‚ÄúI drink a green juice every day. I've been a vegetable eater since I was a kid.‚Äù\n\nHappy birthday, Mary J.! Fifty-two looks good on you.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
