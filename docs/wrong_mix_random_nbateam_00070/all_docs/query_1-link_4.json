        "text": "Updated Friday Oct. 13, 2023 to include info about Kendrick Lamar's most recent GRAMMY wins, as of the 2023 GRAMMYs.\n\nA GRAMMY veteran these days, Kendrick Lamar has won 17 GRAMMYs and has received 47 GRAMMY nominations overall. A sizable chunk of his trophies came from the 58th annual GRAMMY Awards in 2016, when he walked away with five — including his first-ever win in the Best Rap Album category.\n\nThis installment of GRAMMY Rewind turns back the clock to 2016, revisiting Lamar's acceptance speech upon winning Best Rap Album for To Pimp A Butterfly. Though Lamar was alone on stage, he made it clear that he wouldn't be at the top of his game without the help of a broad support system.\n\n\"First off, all glory to God, that's for sure,\" he said, kicking off a speech that went on to thank his parents, who he described as his \"those who gave me the responsibility of knowing, of accepting the good with the bad.\"\n\nLooking for more GRAMMYs news? The 2024 GRAMMY nominations are here!\n\nHe also extended his love and gratitude to his fiancée, Whitney Alford, and shouted out his Top Dawg Entertainment labelmates. Lamar specifically praised Top Dawg's CEO, Anthony Tiffith, for finding and developing raw talent that might not otherwise get the chance to pursue their musical dreams.\n\n\"We'd never forget that: Taking these kids out of the projects, out of Compton, and putting them right here on this stage, to be the best that they can be,\" Lamar — a Compton native himself — continued, leading into an impassioned conclusion spotlighting some of the cornerstone rap albums that came before To Pimp a Butterfly.\n\n\"Hip-hop. Ice Cube. This is for hip-hop,\" he said. \"This is for Snoop Dogg, Doggystyle. This is for Illmatic, this is for Nas. We will live forever. Believe that.\"\n\nTo Pimp a Butterfly singles \"Alright\" and \"These Walls\" earned Lamar three more GRAMMYs that night, the former winning Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song and the latter taking Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (the song features Bilal, Anna Wise and Thundercat). He also won Best Music Video for the remix of Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood.\"\n\nLamar has since won Best Rap Album two more times, taking home the golden gramophone in 2018 for his blockbuster LP DAMN., and in 2023 for his bold fifth album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.\n\nWatch Lamar's full acceptance speech above, and check back at GRAMMY.com every Friday for more GRAMMY Rewind episodes.\n\n10 Essential Facts To Know About GRAMMY-Winning Rapper J. Cole\n\nMary J. Blige’s tireless work ethic, extraordinary singing talent and soul-level relatability are the secret ingredients to her longevity as a recording artist. Her discography includes nine GRAMMY wins and 37 nominations, and the multi-hyphenate artist continues to demonstrate that there's no limit to her creativity.\n\nBlige is nominated for six awards at the 2023 GRAMMYs, including Album Of The Year and Best R&B Album for Good Morning Gorgeous (Deluxe). The title track is nominated in three categories: Record Of The Year, Best Traditional R&B Performance and Best R&B Song, and \"Here With Me\" is up for Best R&B Performance.\n\nGood Morning Gorgeous encapsulates the true self-love Blige felt after healing from divorce, abusive relationships and depression. As she explains on an album interlude \"good morning gorgeous\" is the affirmation Blige now says to herself in the mornings — and, for the first time, she believes it. And when it comes to the odds of adding to her GRAMMY wins on Feb. 5, it’s safe to wager that Blige thinks they’re sound.\n\n\"Bet on me, why not?\" Blige sings in the chorus of the album’s \"On Top.\" \"Don’t act like I never left on top.\"\n\nFor her resonant musical messages, Blige has been crowned the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul. But she’s also an industry professional who deftly sets and iterates on trends, keeping even her earliest releases relevant and exciting.\n\nBlige became a record label boss when she released Good Morning Gorgeous as a joint venture between Lyor Cohen’s 300 Entertainment and her own Mary Jane Productions. She’s a frequent executive producer of her albums and multimedia projects and is set to executive produce two fictional films for Lifetime in 2023 through her production company Blue Butterfly. Real Love and Strength of a Woman are both named for her songs. Real Love is described as a romantic drama set in an upstate New York college.\n\nAfter more than 30 years of recording, Blige has amassed an acclaimed and extensive discography of consummate original classics, deep soundtrack cuts, scene-stealing covers and remixes. Press play on the Amazon Music playlist above and use the below guide as a diving board into a career full of the empathetic pain, healing, promise and happiness that she has shared with unflinching honesty and vulnerability.\n\nThe Queen Of Hip-Hop Soul\n\nBlige was living in a housing project in Yonkers, N.Y. when the late Andre Harrell signed her to his Uptown Records, which released her 1992 debut album, What’s The 411? Harrell coined the nickname Queen of Hip-Hop Soul to describe the fresh way Blige's music melded rap beats with R&B hooks.\n\nHarrell and his then-intern Sean Combs gave her a rugged style to match her music, with boots and baseball caps instead of heels and sparkles. Young women from the inner city saw themselves in Blige's aesthetic and in her rawness.\n\nYet admiration for Blige’s powerful vocals and unique tone grew before her name was ever recognized. Blige was first heard as a backup singer for Father MC’s 1990 hit \"I'll Do 4 U\" and, the following year, her own single \"You Remind Me\" (from the Strictly Business soundtrack) gave Blige some street buzz to lead into What’s The 411? The hip-hop swagger of \"Real Love\" — which samples \"Top Billin'\" by Audio Two, a beat highly familiar to New York City fans at the time — served as her formal introduction to the world and remains a calling card decades later.\n\nThe My Life Era (Extended Mix)\n\nContrary to the music industry’s sophomore slump stereotype, Blige’s second album is a seminal work. 1994's My Life became career-defining, and an album that she has subsequently reflected on to show her growth.\n\nThe album is a reflection of her volatile relationship with singer Cedric \"K-Ci\" Hailey, Blige explained in Mary J. Blige’s My Life, a documentary she executive produced for Amazon Studios in honor of the album’s 25th anniversary. Throughout, Blige keenly pairs heights of happiness with depths of her despair on songs like \"You Bring Me Joy,\" \"I’m Goin’ Down,\" \"I Love You\" and \"Be Happy.\"\n\n\"The whole 'My Life' album is, 'Please love me, don’t go, I need you,'\" she said in the documentary. Combs, then known as Puffy, continued: \"When she made that album, she was fighting for her heart.\" (Combs and Harrell served as executive producers of My Life.)\n\nBlige and Combs never collaborated quite so closely again, though they remained friends. Combs didn’t produce 2011’s My Life II… The Journey Continues (Act 1), but he appears in a telephone skit to open the album, similarly to how he did on My Life. The sequel features guest stars such as Nas, Beyoncé and Drake.\n\nThough her earlier works hinted at the potential, My Life most firmly established Blige as a beacon for hurt hearts everywhere. In a 2021 interview with Trevor Noah, Blige described how childhood physical and mental abuse, as well as her relationship with Hailey, led to substance abuse and depression. When she used the songs on My Life as a way of saying she needed help, \"four million people responded and said, ‘'We need help, too.'\"\n\nCovers, Collaborations And Remixes\n\nCover songs have been an acclaimed — and long-lasting — part of Blige’s career ever since she sang \"Sweet Thing\" by Rufus featuring Chaka Khan on What’s The 411? Blige released her hugely popular version of Rose Royce’s \"I’m Goin’ Down\" in 1994, which reached No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100, and she beat Beyoncé to the punch in 2000 with her take on Maze’s \"Before I Let Go.\"\n\nBut her ascension to rock star status has a lot to do with her scene-stealing covers of songs of stadium-level acts. Blige has delivered epic versions of songs by Led Zeppelin (\"Stairway To Heaven\") and Sting (\"Whenever I Say Your Name\"), and when she collaborated with U2 on a new version of \"One,\" there’s an audible battle with Bono as to whose song this is now.\n\nBlige collaborates with rap, R&B, rock, country, electronic and classical artists with equal ease, and her discography includes work with late legends, including \"Holdin’ On\" with Aretha Franklin and a cover of Stevie Wonder’s \"As\" with George Michael. She won her first career GRAMMY in 1995 for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for \"I'll Be There For You / You're All I Need To Get By,\" a collaboration with Method Man that covers Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.\n\nA dance music collaboration with London duo Disclosure called \"F for You\" in 2013 helped to catalyze an entire album from the Capital of England called The London Sessions. The 2014 album features a second collaboration with Disclosure (\"Right Now\"), a cameo from UK garage DJ/producer MJ Cole (\"Nobody But You\") and guest vocals from Scottish singer Emeli Sandé (\"Whole Damn Year\").\n\nBlige has long understood the potency of both hip-hop and dance music remixes, which remain a part of her single roll-outs. Over the years, she created a remix album of songs from What’s The 411?, and in 2002 released club-focused reworks of songs from No More Drama, Mary and Share My World on Dance For Me.\n\nBlige's remixes also pay homage. On her cover of First Choice’s \"Let No Man Put Asunder,\" Blige honors singers who came before by featuring guest vocals from the group's lead singer, Rochelle Fleming.\n\nHer Rap Alter Ego\n\nBlige has rapped a few times on her albums, beginning with a verse in \"Love,\" from 2001’s No More Drama. She won her first solo GRAMMY for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 2003 for \"He Think I Don't Know\" from No More Drama. By the time she rhymed on \"Enough Cryin’\" and \"Take Me As I Am\" (both from 2005’s The Breakthrough), her rap alter ego had a name: Brook Lynn.\n\nHer cadence caught the ear of her friend Busta Rhymes, who recruited Blige for his \"Touch It (Remix)\" the next year. \"The haters plot and they watch, lookin’ all pale/While I’m on a yacht overseas, doin’ my nails,\" she raps alongside Busta, Missy Elliott and Rah Digga.\n\nBrook Lynn took a hiatus for a few years after that, but she came back blazing in 2011. \"Homegirls love me and we be ridin' Phantoms/Mad chicks hate me 'cause I be writin' anthems,\" she rhymes on \"Midnight Drive\" from My Life II… The Journey Continues (Act 1).\n\nThe Soundtracks\n\nSince \"You Remind Me,\" her first Top 40 entry, appeared on the soundtrack to Strictly Business, Blige has written stunning original songs such as \"I Can See in Color\" for Precious (2009). She has also licensed other hits to dozens of movies.\n\nAfter years of contributing to soundtracks, Blige created her own as executive producer and performer of the soundtrack for Think Like a Man Too (2014), which includes a cover of Shalamar’s \"A Night to Remember\" and guest appearances by Pharrell Williams and The-Dream.\n\nBlige has been cast in several acting roles since she guest starred in an episode of The Jamie Foxx Show in 1998 and has played fictional characters as well as real life figures Betty Shabazz (Betty and Coretta) and Dinah Washington (Respect). She received Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Best Original Song for her work on 2017 film Mudbound.\n\nMore than 30 years into her recording career, Blige appears happy, energized and ready to add more hits and heartfelt anthems to her songbook.\n\nSongbook: A Guide To Whitney Houston's Iconic Discography, From Her '80s Pop Reign To Soundtrack Smashes"
