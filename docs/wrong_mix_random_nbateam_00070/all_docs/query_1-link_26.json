        "text": "Back in February, Mary J. Blige delivered her fourteenth studio LP Good Morning Gorgeous, which contained 13 songs and assists from Anderson .Paak, Dave East, DJ Khaled, Fivio Foreign, and Usher. Months later, the longstanding queen of hip hop soul unveiled a deluxe edition of the album, adding on six additional songs and new collaborations alongside Remy Ma, Moneybagg Yo, Jadakiss, Ne-Yo, and more.\n\nOne particular standout from the upgraded version of Good Morning Gorgeous is a remix of “Come See About Me” that features Fabolous. Produced by Cool N Dre and El Michels, the track exudes a level of confidence that should make anyone want to go outside and hit the town with their special someone:\n\n“Something ’bout your loving, always keeps me jumping, pop one out the oven, watch me bake, when at your best, can never go wrong, you take the lead and keep it up front, talking about a lifetime, only, yeah, come, come and see about me, you know I’m really in a good mood, I bought a coast for you, match that so we can have two, come, come and see about me, you know I’m really in a good mood, you make a move, I make a move, we make a movie…”\n\nThe accompanying clip takes viewers to an exotic location, where Mary J. Blige shows off her beauty in revealing outfits and swimsuits throughout. While she enjoys champagne with actor Da’Vinchi, Fabolous can be spotted with his own love interest in a Jeep on the beach."
