One series, Power Book II, will star queen of hip hop soul, Mary J. Blige. Mary plays a woman in the “underworld.”\n\nDeadline reports Method Man will also be added to the cast. He will portray an “ambitious and savvy attorney named Davis Maclean. Method Man’s character is “attracted to the NYC underworld run by Oscar nominee Mary’s character, but may find himself entrapped by some secrets from his past.”\n\nMethod Man is no stranger to TV. He’s made big screen and small screen appearances on OZ, The Wire, The Deuce, Drop The Mic, and The Last O.G.\n\nPower officially ends on Feb. 9th. Power Book II is set to come out later in 2020."
