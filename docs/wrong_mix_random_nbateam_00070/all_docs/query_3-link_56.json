        "text": "Archive 35 ← Archive 37 Archive 38 Archive 39 Archive 40 Archive 41 → Archive 44\n\nI was recently editing Black swan (disambiguation), and in addition to adding an entry I rewrote some links to include more significant piping in the attempt to avoid lines like:\n\nThe Black Swan (Bert Jansch album), by the folk singer-songwriter Bert Jansch\n\nwhich seems redundant to the point of being less clear than the more aggressively piped version:\n\nThe Black Swan, an album by the folk singer-songwriter Bert Jansch\n\nI thought that I was interpreting #MOSDAB correctly (even until a few minutes ago), but having re-read it, I'm not so sure. I'm absolutely convinced that the latter version is more clear, and makes the entire page more legible, but I'm not out to run against the grain on this. The given example of Moment seems fine, as does Black Swan (album), but the links with parenthetical content repeated more clearly in the description seem like they're working against the intended purpose of easy disambiguation. Clarification on this matter would be welcome. JamesLucas (\" \" / +)\n\nIn that case, it would seem like all you need is The Black Swan (Bert Jansch album). That itself will explain enough for the typical searcher. bd2412 T\n\nThat seems reasonable, if not elegant (in terms of punctuation). It's definitely preferable to the redundancy. JamesLucas (\" \" / +)\n\nBD, did you mean to put the whole string in Italics, including the part in parentheses? I believe that line should read as follows:\n\nThe Black Swan (Bert Jansch album)\n\nIn other words, the Italics should be around only the actual title, and only in the piped section, yes? --Auntof6 (talk)\n\nOops, yes - meant that no additional explanation is required beyond the link title itself. bd2412 T\n\nI ran across {{Refer}} (and Cat-tagged it). Its creation and use seem to me to warrant the opportunity for discussion here.\n\n--Jerzy•t\n\nSeems similar to the ones in Category:Disambiguation lead templates. Pretty useless and an unnecessary complication as far as I'm concerned. I change them all to plain wikimarkup when I come across them. older ≠ wiser\n\nIn this edit, an editor changed statement of policy about disambiguation pages having red-links. I reverted the edit with summary directing to discuss here.\n\nThe policy change suggested would have effect of outlawing disambiguation pages having only one bluelink article and otherwise having redlink items. I oppose that proposed policy change because it would outlaw many disambiguation pages covering U.S. NRHP-listed places which were created fairly under existing policy. These disambiguation pages all cover multiple wikipedia-notable places having the same name. Redlinks are explicitly allowed in MOS:DABRL and other guidelines and past discussions. Please update me if this has been discussed somewhere, but I certainly oppose an undiscussed policy change that would affect many articles. doncram (talk)\n\nWe should, as a matter of common sense, permit redlinks for inherently notable topics (such as NRHP listed places, national legislators, etc.) on the grounds that the entries are needed and will eventually be made. bd2412 T\n\nAnd again, not that this applies to NHRP entries, since they should have blue links, but: as a matter of common sense, the disambiguation guidelines disallow red links without blue links for notable topics on the grounds that the needed entries can easily be made when the needed-but-ambiguous articles are created. Future Wikipedia articles are disambiguated by future dab edits; current disambiguation pages disambiguate only current Wikipedia articles, common sensically. (Unrelated to whether the guidelines make more logical sense in the order that I tried to put them in.) -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nI'm the \"an editor\" above. The edit linked did not actually change any policy; it merely put the guidelines in a more logical (IMO) place. The guidelines before and after say the same thing. The guidelines did and do guide against having disambiguation pages without ambiguous Wikipedia articles to disambiguate. However, that has little effect on the NHRP-related dabs; the entries thereon all have blue links, either as the entry or in the description. The edit was not aimed at those pages, nor at any other pages, because (again) the edit did not actually change the meaning of the guidelines. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nI agree with JHunterJ.... there was no policy change here. Dlabtot (talk)\n\nIndeed. All he did was reorganize the material. There was no substantial change to the existing guidelines.--ShelfSkewed Talk\n\nSorry, I was a bit confused. I see now that JHunterJ's edit merely moved the passage that i focused on; it did not add the passage I questioned (\"A disambiguation page should not be made up completely of red links or have only one blue link on the entire page, because the basic purpose of disambiguation is to refer users to other Wikipedia pages.\") In between the addition and the deletion of that in different spots, it also changed a different passage (the one saying \"If the only pages that use the red link are disambiguation pages, unlink the entry word but still keep a blue link in the description\", which I don't happen to understand, but don't need to).\n\nI appreciate that JHunterJ is not aiming at the NRHP disambiguation pages, thanks for clarifying. However, I disagree with JHunterJ's summary statement above, that \"Future Wikipedia articles are disambiguated by future dab edits; current disambiguation pages disambiguate only current Wikipedia articles, common sensically.\" The wording seems imprecise to me, because in fact it would not be common-sensical to delete disambiguation pages that have been set up to disambiguate between same-name known-to-be-wikipedia-notable topics, where currently there exists only one article, but where the others will be created eventually.\n\nIn the end, I remain concerned about the existing language, wherever it is placed. Technically I see you can read it to say that the NRHP pages I am concerned about are already excluded (because the NRHP redlink entries indeed do or should already include an explanatory, secondary bluelink). It seems though it could easily be interpreted to apply against these NRHP dab pages where there is just one primary bluelink. However, I am not familiar with the other issues that may pertain here, and don't have a better wording suggestion myself, and I don't have specific knowledge of any misunderstandings being created, so I guess the existing language can stand. Thanks! doncram (talk)\n\nAbout the middle paragraph: It would still be common-sensical to delete disambiguation pages that have been set up to disambiguate between same-name known-to-be-Wikipedia-notable topics, where currently there exists only one article, but where the others will be created eventually -- because the idea of \"known-to-be-Wikipedia-notable\" is indeterminate. One editor's idea of WP-notable may not be consensus. If the editor pursues the common-sensical course and creates the possibly notable article (even as a stub), then the other guidelines of notability, etc., can be applied and consensus reached, and then as long as there exists the ambiguous Wikipedia page add it to the disambiguation page. If instead this policy were changed to allow that common-sensical approach to be reversed, then other editors would point to it when they added non-notable entries to disambiguation pages when no articles are or could be eminent. Disambiguation pages disambiguate Wikipedia articles, and we should trust the future Wikipedia to take care of itself. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nSome readers of this page may be interested in Wikipedia talk:Disambiguation pages with links/Archive 12#Introducing \"The Daily Disambig\". --R'n'B (call me Russ)\n\nThe Jefferson County example in the article does not make sense to me. If there were only one Jefferson County, it should not appear on the Jefferson disambiguation page (according to the example) but since there is more than one Jefferson County, the Jefferson County disambiguation page gets listed on the Jefferson disambiguation page. Either we want Jefferson County listed or we don't, how many of them there are should make no difference. SpinningSpark\n\nI agree, if I understand your point correctly, that it doesn't make sense to say that Jefferson should not link to an article called Jefferson County, but it should link to a disambiguation page, if one exists, that lists multiple articles called \"Jefferson County.\" And that does seem to be what MOS:DP#Examples of individual entries that should not be created currently says to do. Propaniac (talk)\n\nI would list either on the \"See also\" section of the dab (as related dab or partial-title match). -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nIf that's what the practice is, then the guideline should say \"partial matches should be placed in a 'see also' section\". Saying not to include partial matches is very confusing if we are actually including them, but not in the main body. I'm not arguing for this one way or the other, but it should be made clear what is required. SpinningSpark\n\nAs with other partial title matches, this is dealt with by the exception provided for in MOS:DP#Examples of individual entries that should not be created: The above does not apply if the subject is commonly referred to simply by Title. For instance, Oxford (disambiguation) should link University of Oxford and Catalina might include Santa Catalina Island, California. If there is disagreement about whether this exception applies, it is often best to assume that it does. If there is only one Foo County and it is reasonable that some might at times refer to it as simply \"Foo\" then it belongs on the dab page. If there are a dozen articles named Foo County, they need a separate disambiguation page which can be linked to from the Foo page to avoid duplication. older ≠ wiser\n\nBut hold up, the page is specifically citing Foo County as an example of partial matches that should not be linked. You might be right that Foo County is often referred to as just Foo (I don't know if that's true, it doesn't arise in the UK because county names generally do not have \"county\" in them) but that just makes it a bad example. The point is it should not be saying that partial matches should not be listed for one occurence, but list the dab page for multiple occurences. That is just not consistent. SpinningSpark\n\nYes, there is inconsistency. Personally, I've never thought that particular list of individual entries that should not be created was very useful precisely because exceptions are so commonly made for exactly the types of entries in the list. Surely there are better examples of partial matches that would better illustrate the principle. older ≠ wiser\n\nThere are two things here;\n\nit's a bad example\n\nit's telling the reader to do the wrong thing even if it had a good example\n\nIt must be wrong since it instructs two contradictory things. Whichever you believe is right, the other must be wrong. That's ground for deleting it right now, someone can put a good example in later. SpinningSpark\n\nI agree; I don't like that list of examples, either. (Actually, I thought the standard was to include Foo County, however many there are, at Foo (disambiguation); apparently I'm just so used to seeing those \"exceptions\" I thought it was the rule. I also recall getting confused in the past by how I'm supposed to treat Foo Township.) Foo University also seems to me to be an especially bad example, because I'd be surprised if there's any Foo University or Foo College that isn't routinely referred to as just \"Foo\".\n\nWhenever I refer to that section, it's always because a user wants to add something like Pulp Fiction (film) to Pulp (disambiguation), or The Magician's Nephew to Magician (disambiguation). Can't we just use examples like that? Propaniac (talk)\n\nThere's a discussion at Talk:Lincoln#Attempts at a consensus over the lead to a disambiguation page. The edit war at the article has been between editors who want \"Lincoln may refer to:\" and editors who want a longer lead that singles out two of the entries for special attention. Please participate in the discussion. Uncle G (talk)\n\nMy attempt to clean this article has been reverted. Abtract (talk)\n\nTagged for cleanup. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nThere is a friendly disagreement about which version of this dab page is more useful, Version A or Version B. Or something else? Feedback is appreciated. Station1 (talk)\n\nSomething else. The entries from version A, rearranged with the entries that have their own articles at the top and the entries that have just the NRHP list links below them. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nConsensus, despite JHunterJ's persistent disagreement on this point, has been that ordering items by geographical location in pages of primarily NRHP listings makes more sense for readers, who are likely to be looking for a historic site that they know is in a particular city, state. See: this extended past discussion at WikiProject Disambiguation. In that discussion even JHunterJ accepted or suggested ordering by geographical location, if subsection headers breaking it up by states are introduced (and which I agree is good in really long disambiguation pages like First Presbyterian Church, so that readers can navigate by a TOC). Here, i think sections and a TOC would be heavyhanded. The ordering is by state then city, and that is briefly explained at top, which seems to be just right for this one, to me. doncram (talk)\n\nAs you note, since there weren't any sections or groups here (and there shouldn't be, given the brevity of the list), the same consensus applies here (despite your persistent disagreement on this point): blue links first, then red- or no-links. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nSorry, the consensus in the long discussion was that ordering by geographic area was fine, and only you argued for bluelinks before redlinks. The final versions of the three main articles worked on during the discussion show organization by geography, and show no use of \"bluelinks first\". Also, I asked again later, in April 2009, for more general feedback in this discussion: Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Disambiguation/Archive 16#followup feedback sought on NRHP disambiguation, and there was a 3:1 consensus in favor of listing by state then city about one dab article that had been questioned (Phillips House). The one other view was that it should order strictly by alphabetical names, not by bluelinks first. (About alphabetical as an option, I think that for Broad Street Historic District it is best to show the East and Commercial variations together with the others for same city and state.)\n\nBy the way, in the first long discussion, which was in September 2008, i had claimed that the NRHP list-articles would be completed out in a good table format, with properly disambiguated names for all NRHP listings, in about six months time. It took slightly longer, but in a drive completed on July 4, 2009, we completed the job. There are about 84,000 NRHPs listed, and there are about 1,600 dab pages covering NRHPs with ambiguous names, and all of those dab pages have been cleaned up to conform to MOSDAB. :) (Thank you for your applause) :) doncram (talk)\n\nThe guidelines also specify blue links before red links. Only I may have read the guidelines into that discussion, but the consensus is there. If the NRHP dabs aren't following the broader consensus, that isn't the same as me going off by myself. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nI'm sorry, but the long discussion's subsection Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Disambiguation/Archive 13#current version of Lewis House and ordering addressed the ordering clearly, and others consulted all available guidelines. As part of that, a separate query was put at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)/Archive 37#Should bluelinks always go first?, where the consensus of all but JHunterJ was also that there is no \"bluelinks first\" rule. JHunterJ, let's just agree to disagree about what is best. Enough about the ordering, which was not User:Station1's concern here, anyhow. Thanks! doncram (talk)\n\nThe guidelines address the ordering clearly. The talk pages discuss the guidelines, although perhaps not as clearly (see the section immediate above this one where it comes up again). If you'll stop worrying about my answer to Station1, I'll stop worrying about your worrying about it. Station1 requested feedback, and I provided feedback. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\n[outdent] And I thank you for it. And I agree that if all these useless redlinks remain, bluelinks should come first; that's fairly clear in MOS:DAB, both old and new versions. But my main concern is that this page is simply a list of redlinks for articles mostly unlikely to be written in the near future if ever, that direct people to bluelinks that do not even mention \"Broad Street\" anywhere in them (with the exception of Mississippi; I admit I missed that one). Even if all the bluelinked lists did mention \"Broad Street\" I don't think it's very useful to list redlinks on a dab page unless there's something substantial at the bluelinked list such as a section or at least the equivalent of a stub. Otherwise the search engine is much more useful, accurate and up to date for finding articles that merely mention \"Broad Street Historic District\" somewhere in them. (Besides that big issue there are numerous other issues that would exist even if these were all bluelinks, such as combining 5 dab pages into one, using \"in the United States (by state then city)\", and including items such as \"South Broad Street Row\" mixed with the main listings.) Station1 (talk)\n\nYou're right, if the blue link included with an entry doesn't lead to an article that mentions the ambiguous title, then that blue link should be removed (and the entry too, if there is no appropriate blue link available to replace it). As for \"substantial\", I have a different take: the existence of the dab page (or any page at the name) means that the page will show up instead of search results by default. I think there's a benefit in including the pages that mention the dabbed phrase (even insubstantially) -- below the entries that have articles of their own, and then below the entries that are substantially covered by other articles. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nThe page shows by default if you just enter or hit Go, but not if you hit Search. Would it be useful to have something like a modified Template:Search link that showed something like \"Search Wikipedia for this phrase\" on the bottom of the dab page and automatically performed the search rather than have to constantly update redlink entries manually which, as this case shows, can be problematic? Example: - Station1 (talk)\n\nBy \"by default\" I mean when you hit \"Enter\" -- the default button (\"Go\") is triggered. I am neutralish on the inclusion of links to search results on dab pages. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nThey're not \"useless redlinks\": they assist readers and editors who are looking for NRHP-listed places, and they help editors like me in fixing up NRHP list-articles that include these entries. For example, in recent days several editors have been checking MA state NRHP list-articles and found several instances where a link in the list-article pointed to a dab page like this one, and then they replaced that with the correct, fully disambiguated redlink name.\n\nI do acknowledge that when I created/developed this Broad Street Historic District dab I used the shortcut of linking to state-level NRHP list-articles, while in many cases before or since then those state-level lists have been split into county- or city-level NRHP list-articles, and the dab page has not yet been updated to link to each of the specifically relevant county- or city-level ones. Each item here, however, is covered in a table of such a list-article and has stub-type information available about it there (NRHP listing date, description of location, coordinates, perhaps a description, perhaps a photograph). What you need to do, to improve any entry that bothers you, is to find the more specific NRHP list-article that includes the item, following the procedure explained at MOS:DABRL: \"To find out if any article uses the red link, click on it, and then click 'What links here' on the toolbox on the left side of the page.\" I just used that method to identify the specific county list-articles of the first few items, and revised their links in the dab page. Also I just updated the dab to explain why the South Broad Street Row entry is listed there: it is a NRHP-listed historic district. And i created a stub article for it, so it is now a bluelink entry. I do request you all to please not delete any of those entries.\n\nAn alternative solution is to create stub articles or to wait for them to be created. Those articles will all be created eventually. As I said, above, during the last year the list-articles have all been improved into table form containing stub type information for each NRHP place. During the last year individual articles were created for many NRHP listings around the U.S., including finishing out all of MD and RI and almost all of MA. Articles in WikiProject NRHP have grown from 9000 in February 2008 to aboout 24000 now, covering a large fraction of the 84,000 NRHP-listed places. There is a steady pace of article creation. A bot may well be run to generate stubs for all the remaining ones, too. doncram (talk)\n\nsearch link\n\nI'm sorry about going off down the path with one other editor, about just one issue that will no longer apply when all the articles have been created. Besides that, Station1 wanted to discuss some other questions.\n\nAbout the search link suggestion, I find that interesting. Perhaps search links could be given instead of dabs. The search link example is: ). Offhand, though, I don't think it works as well as the prepared dab page. It does find and list first the dab page and the 3 existing articles named exactly \"Broad Street Historic District (City, State)\". But i note it does not find the redlink \"Broad Street Historic District (Bethel, Maine)\". And I don't suppose you can control the order of presentation. For this dab article, what seems to work well in organizing the info for readers is to put it into geographical name order, which can be done manually in the dab page. I don't see how use of the search link would help in this one dab page, myself, but I wonder if it could be a useful feature to use in dab pages somehow. It seems like a neat tool. Does anyone see potential here? doncram (talk)\n\n\"Within each of the above groups, the most commonly-used meanings should appear at the top, with less common meanings below.\" I agree with this edit: [1] and disagree with this partial deletion: [2] -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nCan you explain what this statement means Within each of the above groups, the most commonly-used meanings should appear at the top, with less common meanings below. in the context where the above groups are 1) Articles with a clarifier in parentheses: (e.g., South Pacific (film)); 2) Articles with a clarifier following a comma: (e.g., Kneeland, California); 3) Articles with the item as part of the name: (e.g., Electronic keyboard as part of a Keyboard dab page); including usage as a give name or surname 4) Synonyms (e.g., Bite as part of a Nibble dab page); 5) Broader-subject articles which treat the topic in a section: (e.g., Medieval art as part of a Fresco dab page).?\n\nThis rationale makes no sense. These groupings are based purely on arbitrary characteristics of the title. I agree with placing the most common meanings overall at the top of a page, and I might also possibly agree to placing more common meanings within subject area groups at the top of that group on very long pages, but what sense does it make to place the most common parenthetically disambiguated term at the top of that grouping and then the most common comma disambiguated term at the top of that grouping and then the most common partial match at the top of that grouping, and so on? older ≠ wiser\n\nThe characteristics of the title, rather than being purely arbitrary, are used as a preliminary indication of the likelihood that that is the article sought by someone who ends up on the dab page. When those characteristics have multiple matches, the matche should continue to be sorted in order of likelihood. Like everywhere else in the dab guidelines. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nAnd the issue here is with the removal of the guidance for likeliest-first, not on the other groupings that weren't deleted. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nI'm afraid I still do not understand. The titles used for articles are very often entirely arbitrary and are unreliable as indicators of the likelihood that that is the article sought by someone who ends up on the dab page. While the guidance may have some utility in some contexts, it is far too simplistic to encode as a universal preference. There are many contexts in which such arbitrary sequencing is more confusing and likely to be unhelpful to readers. older ≠ wiser\n\nI find them (article titles and redirects, when the redirect is a better match than the title) to be useful tools, but I have no problem with recasting them (since they are currently so encoded) so that their \"toolness\" is emphasized, and that the problem their trying to solve is that of likelihood-ordering. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nPardon? I see words that I recognize and some that I do not, but I am having a hard time understanding your meaning. older ≠ wiser\n\nThe ordering by naming style could be reworded to make it clear that the reason that ordering was chosen was because of the assumptions about their relative likelihood. But the end result should still emphasize ordering by likelihood. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nI'm confused, the part that I object to is the categorical directive that entries within each of the above groups (which is unclear what above groups it is referring to) the most commonly-used meanings should appear at the top. As I've alread said, I agree with placing the most common meanings overall at the top of a page -- although even then, this placement is not universal and typically only when there are a handful of topics that could qualify as primary topics when considered against all the other topics on a page. I think applying that same logic to subgroupings on a page is fraught with original research and potential biases. There are situations where such ordering might be warranted, but I think these are an exception rather than the rule. Further I think it is a mistake to assume that the form of a title provides reliable information about the likelihood that readers might be looking for that term on a particular disambiguation page. older ≠ wiser\n\nThe proposed scheme seems elaborate and unhelpful. Too much is being inferred from characteristics of the title, when other common sense orderings may make better sense. I suggest reverting the order of entries section back to the version of August 30 or earlier. doncram (talk)\n\nAnd as ever, note that the version of August 30 (or earlier) still specifies articles before non-articles (i.e., blue links before red links). -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nNo i do not see that specified in the August 30 version. What language exactly are you referring to? doncram (talk)\n\nThe ordering of \"articles\" before the entries that have the requisite blue link in the description. Again. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nI don't see it, but i suppose this is a matter of interpretation, perhaps a gestalt thing that i don't follow, and the difference in interpretation between u and me is the same as a year ago between you vs. me and others in the \"long discussion\" linked from the #Broad Street Historic District section below. Never mind, it is not germane to this discussion section. I'll probably not respond further. doncram (talk)\n\nI'm using WP:ARTICLE to \"interpret\" what the guidelines mean by \"article\" -- articles are a subset of pages and therefore can be blue linked; red links and no-links are not (yet) articles. Disagreeing with the guidelines isn't the same as claiming they're a matter of interpretation. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nThe previous frequency-of-usage recommendation was: \"In most cases, place the items in order of usage, with the most-used meanings appearing at the top and less common meanings below.\" The recommendation was added in May 2005 (diff, original discussion). I took this to apply to entries both on the top of the page and within topic subsections, but at any rate a recommendation to order by frequency of usage should be returned to the page in some form, in my opinion. A disambiguation page's function is to aid navigation, and ordering by frequency of usage (where it can be reasonably determined) is in most cases the most effective sorting method to achieve that end. What I liked about the old wording is that it was flexible enough to allow for the exercise of good judgment, exceptions for special cases, etc. So, to reiterate, I'd like to see that recommendation returned in some form (ideally just add back the previous wording). --Muchness (talk)\n\nUser:JHunterJ just made two moves involving a valid dab page consisting of 8 NRHP entries, one a bluelink and the other properly formed redlinks. He inappropriately moved the one bluelink item, Roosevelt School (Lake Wales, Florida) to the former dab page name Roosevelt School and moved the dab to Roosevelt School (disambiguation). He also rearranged the dab page to put it out of geographical order. All of this is just unhelpful.\n\nThis is a case where all eight of the entries are of exactly equal importance. The one Florida article had been created not because it is more important, but because Florida wikipedian User:Ebyabe has gone through all the Florida NRHP lists and created stub articles.\n\nI created 2 more articles on the list, just for sake of proving they all could be created, although this goes against wishes of some WikiProject NRHP participants who don't want stubs created before photos or other material is available to create a better starter article.\n\nI was able to restore the one back to the Lake Wales name, but it requires an administrator to restore the dab to the proper location. Could an administrator please move Roosevelt School (disambiguation) to Roosevelt School? I know i could submit this at wp:RM but since this type of article is under discussion on this wt:MOSDAB page I thought I should bring it up here where administrators involved here would understand the context. Thanks. doncram (talk)\n\nThe move and changes JHunterJ made were completely appropriate at the time he made them. There was only one article about \"Roosevelt School\" so that article gets the name. If everything else on the dab page was redlinks, it needn't even exist; to move it to \"Roosevelt School (disambiguation)\" was 'generous' in my opinion. He then put the primary topic linkback on the top line in accordance with MOS:DAB; the rest, all redlinks, remained in geographical order. What was done was extremely helpful. If you've since created some stubs to make a point (\"just for sake of proving they all could be created\"), that's no reason to complain about about another editor's completely justifiable edits. Station1 (talk)\n\nThat's just not correct. There are good purposes served by having redlink items on a dab page, and MOS:DABRL specifically allows them. JHunterJ's uninformed assertion that one on the list was of primary significance, based on the fact that it was the one which, randomly, first had an article, is inappropriate. It was not helpful, it was just disruptive.—Preceding unsigned comment added by Doncram (talk • contribs)\n\nHowever, this \"uninformed\" here is a dig. Your view of the disruptiveness of applying the dab guidelines to NRHP-related disambiguations is not consensus. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nThe purpose of a dab page is to direct a reader to the article they're looking for when there are several articles that could reasonably possibly have the same title. If there is only one article with a particular title, there is no call for a dab page, especially without \"(disambiguation)\" as part of its title. If there is only one article about \"Roosevelt School\" and that article is not at the title \"Roosevelt School\", we do readers a disservice by making them look at a dab page they don't expect, when that dab page serves no useful purpose because there is only one choice of an actual article on that dab page. They must then click through that dab page to get to the actual article. Dab pages are not meant to be search engines, nor to give info about the subject, but only to disambiguate among existing articles. What do you believe are the \"good purposes\" served by having a dab page with only one article and a bunch of redlinks? Station1 (talk)\n\nSo moved. If this comes up again on another name, feel free to use {{db-move}} for these requests, once you've taken the steps to make base-name-disambiguation appropriate again. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nThe move back was one part of cleaning up the small mess you created. Thanks for doing that much. I disagree with your insistence that you were correct and the page was not appropriate. It was appropriate by MOSDAB and by common sense and by the consensus of groups of editors who have reviewed this kind of page in \"long discussion\" and related links from another discussion section on this Talk page. doncram (talk)\n\nI didn't insist. Station1, however, recognized that it was correct. It believe it will be correct in the future as well. When the first article at a name is created, it should go to the base name (since one article can't be ambiguous by itself). When the second article that could have the name is created, then the situation might change and one or the other of the articles might be(come) the primary topic, or neither might be and the base name would be a disambiguation page. Dealing with the situation in a timely fashion (i.e., when it comes up, instead of trying to solve a problem before it exists) is not \"cleaning up a mess\" -- it's the normal and expected effort required to improve Wikipedia. Future Wikipedia is expected to have future editors addressing future issues -- current editors do not need to (and should not) set up everything so that any particular future article can be created without a move. Unless you are proposing every article be moved to a title that includes a unique disambiguator (and one that will definitely remain unique in perpetuity) so that every possible future article can also be accomodated. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nIt is probably inane to reply to you but what i mean by your insisting is your getting the dig into your 11:14 comment to assert that the article was not \"base-name-disambiguation appropriate\". And you are further insisting again now. The original disambiguation article was perfectly correct according to consensus of editors and according to MOSDAB. Your bland assurances that one article is of primary importance when it is absolutely clearly known that it is not, is exasperating. You have pulled this stunt on other disambiguation pages i've developed before, and it is annoying. doncram (talk)\n\nPointing out that the original disambiguation was inappropriately placed at the base name was not a dig, but a statement of its conflict with the project guidelines. The original disambiguation was not perfectly correct as Station1 also explained. It is exasperating for you to think that the NRHP view of disambiguations is more correct than the disambiguation project's view of them. This is one of the reasons I suggested early on that you look into the creation of NRHP set index articles, since you seem to want to provide informational content to the reader (articles) rather than navigational aid (disambiguations). -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nAgain it is probably silly to reply to you but you are just wrong on many points here. No one wants to create a descriptive list-article on the scattered set of schools coincidentally given the same name, but there is a need to disambiguate among them. Articles will eventually be created for all of the NRHP ones. And there is no conflict between wikiprojects. It has mainly been just me working on NRHP disambiguation, and I sought and obtained WikiProject Disambiguation consensus on how to fix them compatible with MOSDAB. The compromise involved adding explanatory bluelinks in support of each redlink entry, which I have complied with, despite it not being part of MOSDAB (which instead provides a procedure for dab critics to follow, involving clicking on the redlink and then what links there, effectively to find what i am providing as an explanatory bluelink more easily for you. Station1 is incorrect for insisting that the redlinks are not compliant, and for asserting that my creating stub articles is wp:POINTY in the sense of disrupting wikipedia to make a point. The possibly wp:POINTY behavior, to move and to rearrange a geographically organized NRHP-related dab page, is yours. Based on your previous behavior I assume you will want to get a last word in. Please proceed and I probably will not further reply though I will probably disagree with what you say. doncram (talk)\n\nYou are wrong on many points:\n\nExactly one blue link in each dab entry is a fundamental part of MOSDAB.\n\nWhen ambiguous articles are eventually created, disambiguation pages can eventually reflect the new navigational information. There is no need for disambiguation pages to anticipate these eventualities, any more than a map should anticipate future border changes.\n\nNone of my edits were pointy.\n\nBased on my past behavior of correcting your errors and responding to your accusations, yes, I've replied here. If you will stop accusing me or claiming my edits were wrong/pointy/digs/whatever, I will stop explaining how those accusations are mistaken. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\n(outdent) I agree with HJH. The goal is to get the user to a page containing the information as quickly as possible. If there is only one page that has useful information, then it makes sense to send the user to that page. If you argue that it is important to make it clear that we don't have a page for what they are looking for quickly, you might have a point. But it would be better to spend the time creating the pages. (John User:Jwy talk)\n\nOkay, i'll respond to you too. The goal is to provide a reader with the useful information that is at the dab page itself, about whether or not there is a wikipedia article about the Roosevelt School that the reader is interested in. I have done the research to find that there are in fact 8 equally important NRHP-listed ones. Directing all readers to an article about the one of them in Florida is probably sending 7/8 of all readers to the wrong place. They want the dab page itself, to learn yes, they are not crazy to think the one in their City/State is significant, no there is not yet a wikipedia article on it, and yes the redlink is there for them to click on to start the article if they are willing to upload a pic or do whatever to create an article. Also, in this case it is absolutely clear that there will be a permanent need for a Roosevelt School dab page covering 8 wikipedia-significant places. Changing the form of the dab page from what is known to be the permanently helpful form is tearing down nearly finished work and is not helping. I am having to take time to try to maintain and restore a system of many dab pages that works and is good, instead of creating articles. Also, within the NRHP wikiproject I am having to balance against other editors' wishes that simple stub articles not be created yet, until one can create like a Start level quality article or one with a photo. Currently I personally create stub articles only as needed as part of battling to head off dab editor attacks. Right now I can't and won't do the high quality stubs for all the scattered Roosevelt Schools around the nation. If there is one in my area I may well go there and take a pic and get the NRHP nom docs and do a good article. But otherwise you have to wait until someone else does it, and not tear down the work I and other NRHPers have put into a system that is 100% MOSDAB compliant according to MOSDAB as interpreted by a consensus of all but one WikiProject Disambiguation editors in a long discussion and revisited in later discussions. We are all volunteers here, and you can have your view about what is the best way for me to spend my time, but actually you can't really judge for me the best way for me to defend the system of them. Currently i am judging the best use of my time is to participate here in arguing to you individually and to JHJ to leave well enough alone, and to spend your time differently, too. No offense intended and no offense taken. Thanks for your comment, hope this gives you a clearer idea where i am coming from on this. By the way, would you be willing to help create articles about any of these NRHP-listed historic sites? I would be happy to assist you by pointing you to tools that help and to relevant information sources that vary by state. doncram (talk)\n\nCan't answer for Jwy, but, no, I wouldn't be interested in creating NRHP articles. I am, however, happy to leave well enough alone, but that wasn't the case (\"good enough\") on the version of the dab page arrangement I came across. Since you consider the version I created a mess and I consider the version I started with wrong, I am also happy to put in that effort and undo my own moves and perform others once the NRHP members (or other editors) create additional stubs (or full articles). Since this ends in a version everyone can live with, I am arguing that that is the good-enough process that we should leave alone. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nI appreciate that you are agreeing here and in this version of Roosevelt School dab which JHunterJ was the last to edit to a version showing geographical order, in fact in red-blue-red-red-red-blue-red-blue order in terms of red and blue links. And as you will have noticed i use this new example in commenting against a proposed \"bluelinks-first\" MOSDAB policy in Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)#Rewording the \"Order of entries\" section discussion section above on this Talk page. I do hope we're done here now. Thanks. doncram (talk)\n\nNot fixing it is not the same as endorsing it. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nBoth Roosevelt School and Broad Street Historic District need fixing. The only reason I'm not touching them is because they're still under discussion here and because I'm not interested in getting into an edit war over pages almost no one looks at. Blue links first has always been the guideline at MOS:DAB. Station1 (talk)\n\n\"The goal is to provide a reader with the useful information that is at the dab page itself...\" - here is the heart of the problem. That is most certainly not the goal of a dab page. This is basic. The goal of a dab page is: \"When an article title could refer to several things, it is necessary to provide links or a disambiguation page so that readers typing in that title can quickly navigate to the article that interests them.\" We are not disambiguating the world, only articles on WP. \"I am having to take time to try to maintain and restore a system of many dab pages that works and is good, instead of creating articles\" - please don't do that, there is not consensus for the type of dab pages you want (it's at the point where I recognize dab pages you've edited on sight, without looking at the edit history - that's not good). Please do create articles in your area of expertise - that is what is truly helpful. Station1 (talk)\n\nPer a discussion at User talk:JHunterJ#MOS:DAB on the wording of this guideline:\n\nI feel that the \"most commonly-used meanings should appear at the top\" rule is too vague, and on its own often leads to fairly arbitrary orderings, hampering navigation. I propose adding the following text, or similar:\n\nTo the extent that it is unclear which meanings are the most common, entries within the above groups should be ordered either alphabetically or chronologically. People should typically be alphabetized by last name. Places should be alphabetized by their geographical location, typically a country or state – for example, \"Montana\" for the article \"Butte, Montana\".\n\nBetween the two current sentences of bullet point #4:\n\nWithin each of the above groups, the most commonly-used meanings should appear at the top, with less common meanings below. Entries with a link in the description (Red-link entries and unlinked entries) should appear after blue-link entries.\n\nOr as a separate bullet point #5. I feel that having a more explicit ordering guideline will reduce edit conflicts and improve navigability. WP:IAR implicitly applies, as with the rest of the guideline. Thoughts appreciated, » Swpbτ • ¢\n\nArranging them alphabetically (or otherwise) is going to be contradictory to arranging the entry-links before the red- or no-links. Most commonly used is not vague, although it may be harder to agree upon. My argument from my talk page was that not every last aspect of every dab page needs to be covered by the manual of style; the important thing is that the reader's navigation is assisted, and some of the decisions (such as the ordering of entries that have indistinguishable relative likelihood) can and should be left to the editorial consensus at the individual pages. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nWell if relative commonality is hard and subjective for an editor to determine, it's even harder for a reader to figure out what the editor was thinking. Alpha and chrono, on the other hand, are something everyone gets. They don't contradict the blue-red separation rule any more than the commonal use rule does - both are lower priorities, as the numbered list and wording make apparent. Assisting navigation is my first goal as well, and the entire reason for my suggestion – you might see it as minutiae, but I don't. » Swpbτ • ¢\n\nRelative commonality CAN be hard, but is often reasonably obvious. Where it is not, an appropriate choice that addresses the \"easy navigation\" goal can be selected - and in most cases agreed on by consensus. Thats not calling it minutiae, its admitting to the variety of circumstances and trusting the editors to understand the navigational goal. The \"best\" can vary according to the circumstances. Reducing edit conflict is not a primary goal.\n\nAnd there is some (not complete) correlation between relatively common and blue/red links: The more likely targets are more likely to have been created already. That can't be said of chronological or alphabetical. (John User:Jwy talk)\n\nWith respect, that sounds nice, but it doesn't seem to work that way on the real dab pages I edit dozens of a day – more often than not, the order seems utterly arbitrary, and would certainly slow me down if I were looking for a particular entry, expecting some kind of order that I can quickly recognize and use. Of course the best organizing scheme varies from page to page, and I think the guideline has more than enough caveats to make that clear, although it could be emphasized even further. But what's the harm in suggesting a useful scheme for editors who come here looking for one? And one that, at least some of the time (if not most of the time), is clearer and more effective than the common use scheme? Also, you haven't actually addressed how this conflicts with red-blue separation, which has a stated higher priority. » Swpbτ • ¢\n\nAlso with respect, the proposed wording wasn't suggesting a useful scheme, it was specifying the use of a particular useful scheme. On those pages where the order is utterly arbitrary (so therefore ignoring the guidelines anyway), there's no benefit in adding more to the ignored guidelines. On the dozens you edit each day, you should feel free to alphabetize them if the previous order was arbitrary or not helpful to the reader -- that would be the proper bold approach, and probably would not be met with resistance. As for \"stated higher priority\", you proposed to insert \"alphabetically\" before the red-blue separation line. Most editors also aren't programmers; setting up rules by priority is simply an unneeded complication here. Is the lack of a specification here causing problems in reach consensus on any pages out in the wild? -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nWould someone other than JHunter comment here? 1 vs. 1.5 editors does not to me a satisfying consensus make. To JHunter, I'm suggesting that the order ends up arbitrary despite the guideline, because the guideline is vague and insufficient even for those who read it. I did not propose to put alpha before red-blue, I proposed to put it after (5>4). Rules by priority isn't unneeded, its exactly how organization is and should continue to be done, and its the setup already in place in the guideline! I will gladly change the text to be more \"suggestive\" than \"specifying\":\n\nWhen it is unclear which meanings are the most common, another logical scheme may be used. Alphabetical order and chronological order are two of the most common schemes. If using alphabetical order, people should typically be alphabetized by last name, and places should be alphabetized by their geographical location, typically a country or state – for example, \"Montana\" for the article \"Butte, Montana\".\n\nThis text would then go below the 1-4 priority list, to clearly not be part of it. Now that it is clearly a suggestion, what possible harm could be caused by adding it? (Especially in the face of the benefit it will provide.) » Swpbτ • ¢\n\nI guess I'm the 1/2, right? Maybe this makes me whole: I think \"When it is unclear which meanings are the most common, another logical scheme may be used. Alphabetical order and chronological order are two of the most common schemes.\" is sufficient. (John User:Jwy talk)\n\nI think I agree with Jwy. Propaniac (talk)\n\nButte, Montana is an especially bad example. It's the primary or near-primary use of \"Butte\" and should appear near the top of the dab page, not alphabetically. Station1 (talk)\n\nA lot depends upon context. In general, in a list that is otherwise organized alphabetically or chronologically, I think it is unhelpful to move redlinks or links in the description out of that sequencing. However, in lists of dissimilar entries, there may be some sense to moving these to the end of the list. older ≠ wiser\n\nI agree. There could potentially be some sense, when applied by an informed editor, to moving redlinks lower, say if in fact the editor knew enough to know that those were likely to be less important in permanent sense than other bluelinked items. However, it is not a general rule that in dab pages the topics of articles which happen to be bluelinks now are more important permanently in any sense justifying higher placement in a dab page than the topics of redlinks which have yet to be written. I think we should be trying to support establishment of dab pages that are stable and permanently sensible in their ordering, and introducing bluelinks vs. redlinks as a formal factor in ordering would just obscure the consensus development at each dab page of which ordering makes most sense.\n\nAlso, suppose there were a decision to do bluelinks first, then, say, alphabetical. In a given dab page, that ordering might be more or less apparent to readers when the dab has just been cleaned up by dab-editor imposing that. But the apparent pattern gets lost gradually as redlinks turn blue from the creation of articles elsewhere. And there would be further difficulty in explaining that ordering explicitly in the dab itself, so that editors who might add another entry know what to do, or so that editors passing by know to update the ordering when they see that bluelinks are now appearing among the redlinks. A mainspace statement that the list is ordered by bluelinks then redlinks, and then alphabetically, is not acceptable as it violates wp:SELF. If the ordering cannot be explained in mainspace, I oppose using it. I simply oppose any specific mention in the MOSDAB guideline of preference for bluelinks first. I agree with Jwy and Propaniac's simple wording above, instead. doncram (talk)\n\nI hope there are no issues with me responding here. As I've mentioned before, the guidelines already specify blue links first. Doncram has so far treated my repetition of that guideline as somehow my own personal (and isolated) view, despite my continued statements that it is already in the guidelines. The proposed wording above has not (as far as I can tell) included a proposal to remove the current guidance on blue links first. I would omit the \"order\"s and \"of the most\" in the latest proposed wording, to make that sentence \"Alphabetical and chronological are two common schemes.\" -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nJHunterJ, I wasn't aware that you and perhaps one other editor had slipped that in, in this diff from Sept 25-26. I don't see a consensus for having it in. That seems like quite a coup for you, at least temporarily! And i think it should now be removed. I don't see a consensus for ordering by that, and I oppose for reasons stated above and elsewhere in many previous discussions with you. doncram (talk)\n\nThat's not the guideline I was referring to. That's a re-affirming of this ordering:\n\nArticles with a clarifier in parentheses: (South Pacific (film))\n\nArticles with the item as part of the name: (Electronic keyboard as part of a Keyboard dab page)\n\nSynonyms\n\nLarger subject articles which treat this item in a section: (Medieval art from a Fresco dab page)\n\nThe first three deal with the ordering of blue links (articles). The last one handles the entries where the blue link occurs in the description. I've pointed this out before too. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nSpecifically, the current wording, that\n\nWithin each of the above groups, the most commonly-used meanings should appear at the top, with less common meanings below. Entries with a link in the description (Red-link entries and unlinked entries) should appear after blue-link entries.\n\nis unacceptable to me because it overrules use of sensible other orderings, in favor of arbitrary blue-red ordering. This would prohibit, for example, the geographical order by state then city used in dabs like Broad Street Historic District, discussed in #Broad Street Historic District. Many many editors have cumulatively disagreed with JHunterJ's repetitive arguments over the last year, about this. It would affect thousands of dab pages, and there is NOT a consensus for that change being slipped in! doncram (talk)\n\nI do wish you'd stop making this about me. I'm trying to work with the consensus of the Wikipedia editorship, and have continued to do so even when I disagree with them. Blue-links-first is not arbitrary; if you disagree with it, it would still be beneficial for you to understand the reasoning behind it. Most-likely-first is the underpinning reason. Topics that have articles (blue links) are more likely to be sought (and more likely to be useful to the seeker) than topics that don't, simply because seekers are also editors. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nIf there are a few common usages and many uncommon usages, it makes sense for navigational purposes to put the common usages at the top of the disambiguation page. Separately, I don't see any necessity to attach a particular opinion to any particular editor. I'm not aware of \"many editors cumulatively disagreeing\" with JHunterJ, but if you want to make that claim, linking to specific instances in which this was discussed in the past would be much more profitable. While there's a rare exception now and then, this isn't a corner of Wikipedia that attracts many edit warriors, and we don't need any vilification of productive editors. Dekimasuよ!\n\nJust to note, I did provide links to a previous \"long discussion\" and an RFD and other links to related WikiProject Disambiguation talk archives, in which consensus of all but one participant was secured, in discussion section Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)#Broad Street Historic District currently showing on this Talk page.\n\nAlso, in new discussion section Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)#restore NRHP dab page please, JHunterJ eventually agrees to \"leave well enough alone\" and accepts the current article of this version of Roosevelt School dab which JHunterJ was the last to edit. JHunterJ is there accepting that ordering by geographic order is okay. That is NOT by bluelinks first then redlinks, in fact it currently goes red blue red red red blue red blue. Thank goodness he is conceding on this one. However, I do not want to see MOSDAB changed to a version that would outlaw that and embolden other editors to cause continued turmoil on legitimate dab pages where consensus in the past and now is that a different sensible ordering makes more sense. doncram (talk)\n\nJust to be clear: I'm leaving that ordering alone (because re-ordering it causes drama, and I like to pick and choose my dramas), but not accepting it as okay. The \"leaving well enough alone\" discussion you're referring to is the movement of the articles and dab pages to and from the base name, not the ordering . -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nI'll avoid commenting on the current multiple issues with NHRP listing pages (not limited to disambiguation), but with regards to redlinks and the order of entries -- if a redlink is worth including on a disambiguation page, I don't think there is any basis for relegating these to a secondary status. If they belong on the page then they should be ordered the same as any other entry. If they are not worth including, then remove them. Disrupting logical sequencing such as by alpha order or chronologically is unhelpful. older ≠ wiser\n\nOrdering by likelihood also disrupts those sequencings. I disagree that using sequences other than alpha or chrono is unhelpful. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nI didn't say that using sequences other than alpha or chronological is unhelpful. It is unhelpful to have what appears to be an alpha or chronological list contain portions that are not in alpha or chronological order. older ≠ wiser\n\nIf the list is ordered by blue then red then black (unlinked), it wouldn't appear to be an alpha or chrono list. It would be unhelpful to disrupt a logical sequencing such as disambiguating ambiguous articles before listing ambiguous topics that are not (yet) ambiguous articles. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nWikipedia mainspace is supposed to describe the real world, not describe itself (WP:SELF). Among other problems of maintenance and reader service already described, that ordering would unduly self-refer, calling attention to the current temporary state of wikipedia coverage of the notable known real world places. I agree to disagree with JHunterJ about merits of any proposed \"bluelinks-first\" policy and about whether the most reasonable interpretation of currently stated MOSDAB policy dictates that or not. doncram (talk)\n\n(after ec) No, Wikipedia articles (not mainspace) are related to the real world. Disambiguation pages are Wikipedia-aware navigational aids. That's why they don't pipe links to hide disambiguating phrases in titles, for instance. If you have another interpretation of the guidelines ordering articles first that somehow enables un-articled topics to appear before articles, please state it. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\n@JHJ, If the list is ordered by blue then red then black (unlinked), it wouldn't appear to be an alpha or chrono list. Perhaps this might be obvious to someone schooled in the arcana of disambiguation. But such a disctintion (as well as the significance) would not be so obvious for most readers. And as pages are created, the redlinks turn blue and then there is even more uninutitive inconsistency. older ≠ wiser\n\nDisambiguation pages always need maintenance when ambiguous articles are created. People unschooled in the arcana can still distinguish red and blue (excepting the color blind), and users of Wikipedia know what the colors mean. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nWhy place a totally unnecessary additional burden on maintenance? And I do not think your assumptions about what readers understand about links are well-founded. And it is still illogical to have what is otherwise an alpha or chrono-sorted list superimposed with other criteria. older ≠ wiser\n\n\"totally unnecessary\" is incorrect, unless you are also going to call the requirement for a single blue link on each entry \"totally unnecessary\" -- it has the issue with maintenance when a red link turns blue. It is also illogical to have what is otherwise an article-or-not sorted list superimposed with other criteria (such as alpha or chrono). But no one is superimposing it either way, but rather making one secondary. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nYou're right about removing the extra blue link, but for someone looking for an entry on a list that is otherwise sorted either alphabetically or chronologically, such a fine point of disambiguation page maintenance is irrelevant. What is significant for a reader is not having to spend unnecessary time trying to parse an ordered list that is broken apart into unhelpful divisions. older ≠ wiser\n\nRight. Now there's just the disagreement over which divisions are unhelpful. :-) -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nAnd the same problem rears on Boxwood, where the entries are not otherwise in alphabetical or geographical order. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nArbitrary division 1\n\nSO: Is there consensus to at least add the following below the bulleted list (per myself, JHunter, Jwy, and Propaniac, at least): \"When it is unclear which meanings are the most common, another logical scheme may be used. Alphabetical and chronological are two common schemes.\" The discussion seems to have shifted to whether red-blue separation should be de-prioritized or eliminated (I favor the latter), but can we at least implement the original change for now? » Swpbτ • ¢\n\nI agree with this. I don't find the rationale to mandate a preference for ordering by blue link/red link to be very convincing. older ≠ wiser\n\nYes, and thanks for bringing it back to that. doncram (talk)\n\nWell now the current text has changed, so the addition must change as well. \"Finally, within the above groupings [1-5], entries should be ordered with a logical scheme, such as alphabetical or chronological.\" Whoever actually removed the red/blue bit, thank you. Red/blue and common/uncommon separation were never especially logical, and the former required extra maintenance. Alpha/chrono is worlds better, in that it's what a sane person unfamiliar with this project would reasonably expect to find. Is there anyone other than JHunter who disagrees? » Swpbτ • ¢\n\nI disagree that alpha/chrono makes more sense as a rule. In the vast majority of disambig pages, most of the entries will have no chronology, and while I do tend to alphabetize entries in groups to lend some kind of order, I don't think it's particularly helpful to users because they a) don't know what the alphabetical title of their topic is, and b) they're unlikely to recognize the alphabetization. Most of the time new entries will get added out of alphabetical order or out of any other kind of order. I agree with separating red and blue entries in most cases because I think it looks better (although honestly I rarely leave redlinks on cleaned-up pages anyway, because most of the time it's not linked from any article and there's no article that mentions the topic, or if there is an article that mentions the topic, there's no indication anyone will ever create an article about the topic, so I just delink it). I haven't felt particularly compelled to participate in this argument because it mostly seems to revolve around listing NRHP entries, which I just leave alone anyway because I don't want to argue with doncram and any other NRHP people about it (and it's understandable why they want to use different principles for those pages than I use in cleaning up other pages, although really it would make sense to call the NRHP disambig pages \"set indices\" instead). But I do not want rules designed for NRHP pages to be added to the MOS that covers all disambig pages.Propaniac (talk)\n\nJust to emphasize one particular point, I'm really unconvinced by any argument about disambiguation pages needing more maintenance if we do it one way or the other. An unwatched disambiguation page will turn into a mess no matter how you've organized it, because (at least in my experience) 99% of users who edit it after you will use a totally different format, piped all to hell, wikilinking to seventeen different articles to describe a topic that isn't mentioned in any of them and which the user probably made up, and it'll be in the worst possible place on the page and probably misspelled to boot. Propaniac (talk)\n\nAlpha/chrono is not a universal solution. However, most well-formed dab pages typically use some form of alpha/chrono ordering. I don't agree that readers are unlikely to recognize the alphabetization. Certainly in lists of terms with parenthetical disambiguation it may not be obvious which parenthetical term an entry would have and thus alpha sorting by the parenthetical term is not especially helpful. But for geographical entries, alpha sorting by state is relatively obvious. There are similar such situation where alpha ordering is a simple and obvious means of ordering. While I agree with adding text suggesting that alpha and chrono are common methods for ordering, I would not want them to be seen as mandates. Regarding red links, once again, if a redlink satisfies the basic criteria for inclusion, then it should not be treated differently based on aesthetic preferences. In particular, I think overlaying a list that has an obvious alpha or chrono sort with a editor-centric red/blue differentiation is confusing. Regarding NRHP lists, I agree these would be better served by being set indexes, but for reasons that are not clear to me, Doncram seems to feel they are not appropriate. older ≠ wiser\n\nWatch out for straw men — no one has ever suggested that alpha/chrono be mandated. Agree strongly that the aesthetic value of red/blue sep should take a distant backseat to real navigability guidelines. » Swpbτ • ¢\n\nI was only referring to an unfortunate tendency of editors to interpret guidelines to suit their own perspective and allow a simplistic adherence to the perceived letter of the guideline to overrule common sense and consensus. Even apparently innocuous guidance that includes terms like \"should\" can easily be taken to mean \"must\". older ≠ wiser\n\nPersonally, I appreciate the clarification, as one reason I haven't participated in this debate is that it's become increasingly unclear (to me, at least) what exactly is being suggested. Propaniac (talk)\n\nWell Propaniac, I disagree strongly that users are \"unlikely to recognize the alphabetization\". Anyone who has ever used a print encyclopedia or dictionary will immediately expect alpha. I certainly do. As far as users not knowing the name of their intended topic, that's often not the case. I use dab pages all the time when I know the full title of the article I want and I'm just too lazy to type the whole thing into the search box. And yes, the alpha has helped me find what I was looking for numerous times. Red/blue separation never has. » Swpbτ • ¢\n\nAs the blue/red suggested rule is intended (I think) to be used in the belief that a red link is likely less popular than a blue link - putting the less popular lower. I think you would not necessarily recognize if it helped you. You didn't have to scan over an unwanted article when you thought you entered the complete name. So I challenge that it has been no help to you. But I admit a strict red/blue ordering is imperfect at providing that most efficient ordering.\n\nThis is not a print encyclopedia. They don't have dab pages. Our dab pages have not been consistently alphabetical and I suspect most do not depend on it being so.\n\nPeople may recognize that a given page is alphabetical, but it is rare that it will be of use to them. Yes, for town names if the state/county is alphabetized. But in most mixed pages, there may be more efficient ways to order the list. (John User:Jwy talk)\n\nThis is one of those times where the non-print medium should conform to something that is done in print media, because it makes more sense than any alternative.\n\nI would strongly disagree with any principle under which disambiguation pages are organized with the assumption that users will already know the title of their targeted article. If that's how you look at disambiguation, it's no wonder you would find alphabetical listings wholly ideal, but the intended purpose of disambiguation is to aid users who do not know the title of the article they're seeking, in which case alphabetical ordering can be unhelpful for obvious reasons. (It probably won't hurt, but it's not much better than anything else.) Propaniac (talk)\n\nFirst, I don't think anyone is suggesting that alphabetical order should be the only or dominant means of organizing a page. But I stand by my assertion that most well-formed disambiguation pages do use alpha sorting in some form. It is quite simply one of the most familiar ways to organize lists. I strongly object to the notion that disambiguation page editors have some crystal ball that enables them to rank entire lists of entries by familiarity or most common uses. In some cases there are very obvious common uses which could helpfully be placed at the top or otherwise highlighted, but applying the same method to entire lists is highly subjective and problematic. And what is especially problematic and potentially confusing to users is to inexplicably mix different methods of organization within a single group. older ≠ wiser\n\nOf course. Alpha doesn't have to be the \"perfect\" scheme, when it's the only scheme that makes any sense at all. Ordering by \"common use\" or \"familiarity\" is one miniscule step above just randomizing the entries – and that, not the particular circumstances when alpha is \"most\" useful – is the core argument against the old guideline. » Swpbτ • ¢\n\nI realize that I am the lightning rod for the ordering-by-lieklihood right now, but other editors (Station1, Jwy) have also concurred with the likelihood emphasis here. I was a little surprised to see the discussed new wording proposal changed to a new wording at the same time it was implemented. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nA recent !vote included the reason \"I have problems with mandates.\" This hits upon one of my own observed problems with the dab style guidelines: we have jumbled together matters of style (bullet, no trailing period, how to format titles) with matters of disambiguation (don't include exposition or exploration, only include ambiguous articles) and some that are in a gray area (don't pipe the entry links, list the primary topic separately at the header).\n\nI'm going to project one of the reasons that I joined the disambiguation project on to other editors; maybe I'm wrong and I'm the only one. Disambiguation editors tend to disambiguation pages because they have a set of obvious, concrete fixes that can be applied when \"cleaning up\" a disambiguation page. In theory, there should be low drama and little research (nothing beyond clicking through a link to see if the ambiguous term is there, checking incoming links to red links, and searching for blue links for red and unlinked entries without them). But the proliferation of concrete \"fixes\" beyond what truly needs to be mandated has led to more and more drama (in waves), or at least is seems so to me.\n\nMaybe we can (a) rearrange the guidelines, (b) split the guidelines, and/or (c) eliminate some guidelines. (This idea was also re-suggested to me by reading about Verkeersbordvrij in The Future of the Internet by Jonathan Zittrain, although certainly it is less weighty here than he presents it.)\n\nI believe the key guideline would be:\n\nKeep out of the reader's way (navigation, the assumption is that the reader meant to be at one of the articles disambiguated)\n\nDo not list entries that aren't actually ambiguous (navigation, not exploration)\n\nOne blue link per entry (it's a navigation page, not a normal part of the wikiweb)\n\nDo not pipe entry names (navigation: make it most obvious to the reader where they're going)\n\nSome guidelines that (IMO) wouldn't fall under the key guideline:\n\nEnding a fragment with a period (style, doesn't hinder the reader)\n\nListing or not listing the variant spellings\n\nInclude (or not) birth & death years for people\n\nSome guidelines that are currently under discussion:\n\nOrder by articles (blue link topics) before broader topics (blue link in description). I would have placed this under the key guideline, but it is apparently not \"low drama\", so should be left out of that set\n\nIf there is other consensus for pursuing this, there are several possible avenues: move the key stuff back up to the main WP:D page and leave the style stuff here; rearrange this page to put the key stuff at the top and make the style stuff a \"gallery of examples\" beneath it; split this page into key and other; and probably other approaches as well. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nI would strongly agree with sorting out WP:D and MOS:DP so they cover different topics, as they're supposed to, and perhaps paring down the guidelines as suggested, if it's possible. Propaniac (talk)\n\nThe implication of the Verkeersbordvrij model is to downgrade the manual of style altogether, and to recommend the imitation of existing best practice. I have much sympathy for that view, and that is what many editors actually do. Unfortunately JHunterJ then immediately gives us a \"key guideline\" which to some extent contradicts that. In real life there are often good reasons to blur the distinction between navigation and information, that is, to include in dab pages relevant facts which may be repeated in article pages, or even which appear nowhere else. I have in mind in particular dab pages based on frequently used English phrases, where there may be no article about the phrase itself, but the dab page is the best place to give the phrase's origin (and should start with it). A different example is given by words which are both surnames and placenames (perhaps also given names and names of institutions or objects), where the dab page may be a good place to present, briefly, how these interrelate. To fix ideas for the former case I suggest we examine Let There Be Light, Let there be light, Fiat Lux (disambiguation), where I could argue that the first two, or perhaps all three, might be merged. SamuelTheGhost (talk)\n\nIt is unfortunate SamuelTheGhost immediately works on making this about the editors rather than about the guidelines. The particular so-called dab pages about phrases and their origins are not dab pages but Wikipedia articles. There's even a Category:English phrases for them. Anthroponymy articles can cover surnames and their origins and their interrelations to other articles. Etc. If there's encyclopedic content to be presented, it's not a dab page. Disambiguation pages disambiguate Wikipedia articles. Disambiguation pages: Let There Be Light, Fiat Lux (disambiguation). Articles: Let there be light, Fiat lux (article redirect), Fiat Lux (article redirect). The dab pages should not be merged with the articles. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nI'll have to read up on Verkeersbordvrij. I think it a good idea to review and simplify, but my pre-Verkeersbordvrij-reading opinion is that some (not strict, but strong) consistency between dab page style assists navigation, so some guidance is useful. But let me do my homework. (John User:Jwy talk)\n\nI think the new organization section needs some work. It doesn't match the formatting of the section and group headings (bolding and bullets), which may be just an artifact of the list, but could be causing confusion for readers who then use bullets and subbullets for groups on pages. Perhaps a simpler list of common group headings would be better? -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nWith due respect to the editor(s) who worked on it, I think the entire new section is excessive and would be better filled by, as JHunterJ suggested, a simple list of some common headings. While I appreciate that everything in the section is only \"suggested,\" it seems to include quite a lot of \"suggestions\" that go far beyond the guidelines' previous direction on the subject and appear to be based on the personal taste of the editor. (For one thing, I hate separating acronyms from the other entries on a dab page, because the user may not know whether their topic's title is an acronym and I see no reason not to sort them by subject as with the other dab entries.) Propaniac (talk)\n\nI reverted it. A list of common heading could still be added. -- JHunterJ (talk)\n\nCould someone please look at this [3] ... maybe I am wrong? Abtract (talk)\n\nI think you might be. If the other project wants to tag it, I don't see what problem it is to us. I'm not sure WHY they want to tag it or what good it does, but... (John User:Jwy talk)\n\nYup, it does seem a bit of a daft thing for those projects to track, but it's not up to us to tell other projects what they can or cannot track. older ≠ wiser\n\nI agree with the above users; it doesn't appear to make any sense to include it, but they can if they want to. Propaniac (talk)\n\nThanks ... I may have been thinking of templates. Abtract (talk)\n\nI want to propose this type of sorting format be accepted in Disambiguation, but only in the media / medium section (e.g. media as in titles of artwork, film, movie, song and medium as in book, short story, novella, franchise...etc)\n\nmeaning disambiguate the titles of medias through means of hierarchy (e.g.\n\nDisambiguation title: Halloween In film list of episodes in\n\nFrasier A\n\nGunman\n\nThat's 70 Show\n\nif they are repeats of the same name, all of them are required to add the years in parenthesis.\n\nThe statistics clearly shows that users find it easier to navigate in the spike from around 3.0k to an instant view hits of 9.6k as show in here. Or perhaps a template documentation might be more suitable?\n\n--173.183.102.95 (talk)\n\nA couple things: 1) you don't explain why your proposal improves things (and continues to take care of some of the issues that WP:MOSDAB attempts to address) and 2) I'm pretty sure I can think of a good reason for a spike on this page on October 31 that has nothing to do with layout. (John User:Jwy talk)\n\nVirtually the same pattern can be observed in the statistics for October 2008, when the page looked more or less as it does now.--ShelfSkewed Talk\n\nWP:MOSDAB is a complex, exhaustive definition as is.

Josh Parris\n\nDoes anyone have a strong reason why in Wikipedia, we often treat England the same as we treat Russia, the US, or Tanzania, even though it is not a sovereign nation in political contexts like the UN or International Olympic Committee but the other three are? Reserving such special usage to the modern UK would unfortunately force us in light of WP:The role of policies in collaborative anarchy#Neutral_point_of_view to either recognize other former sovereign nations like the USSR, the Republic of Vermont, and the Sultanate of Zanzibar well outside of their historical contexts or count any number of subnational administrative divisions with at least their own own legislative assemblies like the State Assembly of Adygea, the Vermont General Assembly, or the House of Representatives of Zanzibar, which are well apart from their overarching national ones, at the same level as sovereign nations because England does not even have one of its own. In order to avoid violating one of the five WP:PILLARS by giving WP:UNDUEWEIGHT only to subdivisions of the UK, we could very easily limit our choice of modern countries to those described by the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 as this not only includes every nation on the List of United Nations member states, the List of United Nations observers and non-members, and the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories but also quasi-nations like Greenland that have their own legislative assemblies and the power to make international agreements outside of the scope of their national legislatures, such as Greenland's not being party to the EC and most of the modern EU, unlike the rest of Denmark. :)--Thecurran (talk)\n\nQuick answer \"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds\" (Ralph Waldo Emerson). We are not \"forced\". as you put it, to do anything. The purpose of wikipedia is to inform and help the reader. Every English speaker knows what \"England\" means, so there is no good reason to avoid the term where it fits. By the same token, there is no overriding reason why a place may not be located just to \"Texas\" or \"California\". What is suggested here is a form of literal \"political correctness\" which we don't need.

If more than ten per cent of articles make one the first three mistakes above, please accept that as refuting your stated hypothesis, \"Every English speaker knows what \"England\" means[.]\", and therefore your proposal, \"[T]here is no good reason to avoid the term where it fits.\", as you wrote it was conditional on the hypothesis with the word, \"so\". Let us commence said test, knowing full well that if less than ten per cent make said mistake, it merely means this test supports your hypothesis within a ten per cent margin of error but other tests may not do so. Since this follows the Scientific method, and one may WP:VERIFY this with WP:RELIABLE#Quotations of English speakers, which is one third of the WP:Core content policies, User:Bkonrad should realize that this is not just \"conform[ing] to arbitrary standards of political correctness.\" but following our \"aim to help readers\". :)--Thecurran (talk)\n\nNB: Subhits are included to depict exactly what readers would see.

There was also a new found appreciation of the open landscapes of romantic wilderness, and a concern for the ancient folk arts. William Morris is particularly associated with this latter trend, as were the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Another important influence, from about 1890 until 1926, was the growing knowledge about the visual art of Japan.

First of all, similar to other religions hardly any Christians follow the teachings/instructions of the religion. And of course the author is correct, there are many divisions within Christianity in India, depending on really one's economic status, not stricly what caste one was before becoming Christian. There are churches where the congegation is mostly well off and others where everyone is quite poor and services are conducted in Tamil. The mention of the different Christian groups as \"Roman Catholics, Protestants, Methodists,etc.\" is incorrect. The 2 basic groups are Catholics and Protestants. Within Catholics are Roman Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox and similar sounding names, the Roman Catholics are 99% of the Catholics. People don't seem to realize that RUSSIA IS NOT COMMUNIST ANY MORE IT IS RUSSIAN ORTHODOX. There Russian Communist party is now just a small opposition party. Within the Protestants are Methodists, Pentecostals, Evangelicals (many kinds) In the US/England the Evangelicals are usually the lower classes. The 'Church of England' is for the upper classes - the equivalent in USA is the Episcopalian Church. Russia has quickly realized that many if not all western church groups and western NGOs are really centers of sedition, India also should immediately ban the inflow of foreign money to western religious groups, western NGOs (however noble their aims seem to be) and even re-evaluate the work of WHO UNAIDS and such. Without foreign money coming in, let us see how many conversions there are. Another horrifying thing is that many international Christian groups are fronts for western intelligence (CIA etc.). A classic example is the Protestant missionary organization Wycliffe Bible Translators, which worked in concert with Rockefeller to destroy indigenous peoples' cultural values in South America to abet penetration by U.S. businesses.

Of course, the reality of imperial and pre-devolution Great Britain was never that simple, as Scotland, for instance, always retained many of the institutional trappings and the cultural identity of a distinct nation.
