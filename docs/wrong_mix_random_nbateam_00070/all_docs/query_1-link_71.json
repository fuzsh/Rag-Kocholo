        "text": "Urban One has announced that GRAMMY™ and EMMY Award-winning singer, OSCAR®-nominated actress and legendary Queen of Hip Hop Soul, Mary J. Blige will be recognized as the prestigious Entertainment Icon Honoree at “URBAN ONE HONORS.” The two-hour “URBAN ONE HONORS: Best in Black” event premieres during Black History Month on Sunday, February 25, 2024 at 8p/7c, on TV One and simulcast on CLEO TV.\n\nMary J. Blige is one of the defining voices of the contemporary music era. With a track record of eight multi-platinum albums, nine Grammy Awards (plus a staggering 32 nominations), an EMMY award, two Academy Award nominations, two Golden Globe nominations, and a SAG nomination, among many other accolades, Blige has cemented herself as a global superstar. Influenced at an early age by the music of Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, and Gladys Knight, Blige brought her own gritty, urban-rooted style—fusing hip-hop, soul, and honest, frank lyrics—to the forefront on her 1992 debut album “What's the 411?” The multi-platinum set quickly spun off several hits, including two No. R&B No. 1s: “You Remind Me” and “Real Love.” Blige helped redefine R&B and began forging a unique niche for herself on the more personal second album, 1994's “My Life.” She is loved for her passionate, chart-topping hits like \"Be Without You,\" \"No More Drama,\" and \"Family Affair,\" all of which have made her a force in music. Over her career, Blige has released 15 studio albums, in addition to starring in films and television programs such as “Mudbound”, “The Umbrella Academy”, “Respect”, “Power Book II: Ghost” and more.\n\n“Urban One is thrilled to honor the incomparable Mary J. Blige as our 2024 Entertainment Icon. Mary’s immeasurable talent and award-winning music has shaped our culture and has had a profound impact on artists and music across all genres, but most notably the elevation of female artists in both R&B and Hip Hop across generations. She fully personifies the ”Best in Black” theme of this year’s Urban One Honors,” says Michelle L. Rice, President of TV One and CLEO TV.”\n\nBlige joins previously announced esteemed honorees: Dionne Warwick, recognized as the Lifetime Achievement Honoree; Chlöe, celebrated as the Generation Next Honoree; Frankie Beverly, honored as a Living Legend, and Donald Lawrence, acclaimed for his Inspirational Impact."
