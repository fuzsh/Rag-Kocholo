        "text": "Post by syrus on\n\nMary J. Blige is going back to the beginning on My Life II: The Journey Continues, the sequel to her 1994 sophomore release.\n\nDue September 20, the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul’s tenth studio album has already produced the first single “Someone to Love Me (Naked)” featuring Diddy and Lil Wayne, and is set to feature additional production from Kanye West, Swizz Beatz, Danja, Stargate, and The Underdogs.\n\nThe LP, recorded in Los Angeles and New York City, sees MJB looking toward the future while acknowledging the past. “From me to you, My Life II… Our journey together continues in this life,” explained Mary. “It’s a gift to be able to relate and identify with my fans at all times. This album is a reflection of the times and lives of people all around me.”\n\nWhile the video for the Jerry Wonda-produced “Someone to Love Me (Naked)” has already premiered online, the Colin Tilley-directed clip will make its television debut on April 5 following BET’s “The Game.”\n\nMy Life II will serve as the follow-up to its groundbreaking predecessor, which was certified multi-platinum and spawned the singles “I’m Goin’ Down,” “Be Happy,” and “You Bring Me Joy.”\n\nPost by slw84 on\n\nThe title doesn't impress, but I hope she does something different and unexpected!\n\nWell...I thought that they were going to just recreate Mylife in modern times...\n\nGood luck on that...we saw what happen to that recreation of What's the 411 flop love and life.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI hate the album title. I don't like when artists release albums and call them part two of their best album. Let the public decide if you put out something worthy of that title. Also this leads me to believe instead of going at it with a more organic approach, she's probably hitting the studio trying to recreate that sound that she had back then just like she did with Love & Life. That album had some good songs on it and was probably looked at as being worse than it was but it still felt like she was regressing as an artist.\n\nAlso I don't know why she keeps releasing these street heater singles. At this point of her career I don't think they're doing anything for her other than killing off some of the hype for a new Mary project."
