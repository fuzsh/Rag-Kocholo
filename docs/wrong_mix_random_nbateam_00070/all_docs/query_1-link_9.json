        "text": "Mary J. Blige continued a special California weekend after being nominated at the 2018 Golden Globes for best performance by an actress in a supporting role for her contributions starring as Florence Jackson in Dee Rees’ Mudbound.\n\nThe nine-time Grammy Award-winning artist celebrated her 47th birthday in style Thursday (Jan. 11), as she received the honor of her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nDiddy was in attendance to support the queen of hip-hop soul and had high-praise for the “Love Yourself” artist saying: “Whatever she is going through, she knows she has a responsibility to help others who are going through the same thing. Mary J. Blige has saved a lot of lives. Mary J. Blige has saved a lot of broken hearts.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nA teary-eyed Mary J. got emotional when reflecting on her career telling the crowd in attendance, “I’m so grateful for this star right now because I’ve earned it probably three times. I say that with confidence and not arrogance. I say it because I know that now, and I know my worth, and what this means.”\n\nAfter enduring a messy divorce from ex-husband Kendu Isaacs, in addition to releasing a solo album and appearing in Mudbound — which she credits to saving her life — Blige has been through a lot the last couple years. With a Hollywood star added to her already cemented legacy, Blige’s story now lives on forever."
