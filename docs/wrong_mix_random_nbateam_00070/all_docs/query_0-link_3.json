It is the only state encyclopedia in the country to be produced by a library system. The EOA strives to offer a definitive, comprehensive, and accurate record of America’s twenty-fifth state. The mission of this free online encyclopedia is to collect and disseminate information on all aspects of the state’s history and culture and to provide a comprehensive reference work for historians, teachers, students, and others seeking to understand and appreciate Arkansas’s heritage. The EOA debuted online to the public in May 2006 as a work in progress. At that time, it contained approximately 700 entries and 900 pieces of media; as of 2013, the site offers more than 3,200 entries and more than 4,200 pieces of media. Users have come from every continent (including Antarctica) and more than 215 countries. During its first month online, the EOA had about 47,000 visits; the EOA now receives more than 1.6 million visits each year. Major funding for the establishment of the EOA was provided by the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation. Over the years, the EOA has also received funding from the Department of Arkansas Heritage, the Arkansas General Assembly, the Arkansas Humanities Council, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as donations from individuals, foundations, and organizations. CALS has pledged to keep the EOA in operation in perpetuity.

I like the way I am. I’m a natural, actual, real authentical, Arkansas lovin’ man. —Johnny Cash, “Arkansas Lovin’ Man” There’s a lot to love about Arkansas music—if one can even declare such a broad category of “Arkansas music.” Arkansas music is folk music. It’s blues music. It’s rock, it’s jazz, it’s classical, it’s metal, it’s opera. Arkansas music flows like a river, in and out of the state, in and out of decades. Or maybe it flows like a bloodstream. It has a pulse. Or perhaps it defies such conceits entirely and just shows up, picks up a fiddle or a sax or a microphone or a guitar, and fills the room with melodies old or new or maybe old and new. Putting together this book has been full of surprises (“Wow, I never knew [name of excellent musician] was from Arkansas!”), questions (“Now, when exactly was Sonny Boy Williamson born?”), and logistical puzzles (“Should we categorize Al Green as gospel or R&B?)—but mostly delights. After all these years publishing the Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture (EOA) online, it is a pleasure to give some weight to all these words and pictures. It’s like moving from the new-fangled on-the-go mp3 to the vinyl record album playing in the living room; sit down, stay awhile, and immerse yourself in the richness of all this music. There is just something about flipping through a book, enjoying the pictures and the surprise of what the next page may bring. The sheer heft of it in your hands conveys the importance of this subject. We’ve been lucky to have so much musical expertise to build on in the EOA’s first venture into print, from all our knowledgeable entry authors to Robert Cochran’s seminal book on Arkansas music, Our Own Sweet Sounds, as well as the radio show Arkansongs from Stephen Koch and Keith Merckx. But in putting together this collection of encyclopedia entries and media covering music in Arkansas (some material quite new and some that has been on the EOA site for years), we know we are not capturing everything. We are probably even, despite our best efforts, leaving out some major things. Although complete coverage of the topic is a noble goal, we are not attempting to be exhaustive. It is folly. If we know anything from running the online EOA, it is that there is always more. Always. Moreover, this encyclopedia is a repository of knowledge about Arkansas music past and present, but leaning more heavily on the past. Many artists performing today, or maybe people just now picking up instruments or opening their mouths to sing, will likely be enshrined in the encyclopedias of the future. Finally, reading about all these musical legends is marvelous and enlightening, but listening is really the thing. May this book inspire you to fill your ears with some of this “natural, actual, real authentical” music from the Natural State.

Much of this is due to the state’s geography— both its diverse landscape and populace and its proximity to key musical hubs and regions in the nation. Pre-European Exploration through the Nineteenth Century “From the first, music mattered. You can even see it in what the archaeologists find… fragments of cane flutes and whistles older than Columbus,” wrote Robert Cochran in his history of Arkansas music, Our Own Sweet Sounds: A Celebration of Popular Music in Arkansas. “But you can’t hear this music, and until the first explorers published their accounts in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, you couldn’t even read about it. The Osage drums, the leg rattles of Caddo dancers, the voices of Quapaws raised in song—all is silence.” Cochran traced what could be the earliest reference to Arkansas music to European explorers encountering Native Americans in the state on multiple occasions in the 1680s. Other accounts are sparse and isolated to settlements such as Arkansas Post, Washington (Hempstead County), and scattered outposts along trade routes such as the Arkansas River and the Southwest Trail. Perhaps the most famous piece of music from this period referencing the state is “The Arkansas Traveler.” The tune may or may not have been written in Arkansas, but, as Cochran wrote, “By 1845 it was known as a fiddle tune and in 1849 it was reported as the name of a race horse and the most popular dance tune in [the resort town of] Hot Springs.” The tune eventually spawned a popular dialogue as well as a stage drama of the same name and, later, famous Currier & Ives engravings of two paintings by Arkansas painter Edward P. Washbourne: The Arkansas Traveler and The Turn of the Tune. Cochran also noted that there were strong Ozark Mountain folk music and African-Ameri-\n\n10\n\nArkansas’s first officially recognized state song, Eva Ware Barnett’s “Arkansas.”\n\nCourtesy: Old State House Museum Collection\n\ncan musical traditions in Arkansas in the 1800s, but very little of either was documented. Exceptions include Emma Dusenbury of Baxter County, who recorded 116 songs with the Library of Congress and sang at the Arkansas centennial celebration in 1936, and vaudeville star Essie Whitman of Osceola (Mississippi County), who was one of the Whitman Sisters. Early Twentieth Century and Radio The advent of radio in the 1920s enabled musicians, in Arkansas and around the world, to make their marks far from home. Music was a natural fit for the aural medium, and, by 1925, Arkansas had stations licensed in Little Rock (Pulaski County), Fayetteville (Washington County), Hot Springs (Garland County), and Fort Smith (Sebastian County), joining the original WOK in Pine Bluff (Jefferson County). Plenty of early talent found fleeting fame on the airwaves of stations that, by the 1930s, were scattered around the state. Programs found on 10,000- to 50,000-watt “clear channel” AM radio stations with far-reaching signals proved most influential on the future artists from Arkansas, often musicians and singers who chose musical\n\nperformance as a way out of the cotton fields. The National Barn Dance on WLS out of Chicago, Illinois, gave Ruby Blevins (a.k.a. Patsy Montana) of Beaudry (Garland County) her first taste of national fame. WLS would also pick up the Lum and Abner program starring comedians Chester Lauck and Norris Goff of Mena (Polk County), and it hosted comedian, radio host, and banjo player Benjamin “Whitey” Ford of Little Rock—perhaps best known as the Duke of Paducah. Shreveport radio station KWKH’s Louisiana Hayride served as a showcase for famed Arkansas singers and musicians such as Johnny Cash of Kingsland (Cleveland County), Lefty Frizzell of El Dorado (Union County), and Floyd Cramer of Huttig (Union County), while WSM out of Nashville, Tennessee, broadcast weekly from the Grand Ole Opry. These and other programs of the day served as something of a model for Arkansas’s most famous and longest-standing radio broadcast. In November 1941, Helena (Phillips County) businessman Sam Anderson and a group of business partners put KFFA on the air. They were soon approached by blues musicians Sonny Boy Williamson of Helena and Robert Lockwood Jr. of Turkey Scratch (Phillips County) about the possibility of letting them play live on the air as a way to advertise nightly appearances around the area. Anderson told them they would need a sponsor and put them in touch with Interstate Grocery Company owner Max Moore, who had been considering an advertising campaign for one of his products, King Biscuit Flour. The fifteen-minute King Biscuit Time program aired live from the Floyd Truck Lines building with Lockwood, Williamson, and a rotating cast of musicians performing as the King Biscuit Entertainers. The program was so popular that Moore soon re-branded another product as Sonny Boy Cornmeal. As of 2013, the program airs daily from the Delta Cultural Center in Helena-West Helena (Phillips County) on KFFA with longtime host “Sunshine” Sonny Payne. Later in the 1940s, Williamson briefly migrated upriver to KWEM in West Memphis (Crittenden County), a station that hosted musicians who would pay to play live in the studio. The exposure worked to boost the careers of many musicians, including James Cotton of West Helena (Phillips County), Pat Hare of Cherry Valley (Cross County), and Robert Nighthawk of Hel-\n\nena. The station also influenced future trends. Noted figures from Elvis Presley to the Memphis Horns’ Wayne Jackson of West Memphis to Albert King of Osceola have said that the music they heard on KWEM influenced their own careers. The blues music that was a staple for these and many other radio stations around the Mississippi Delta region was highly influential and helped define the sounds of other genres. These include rhythm and blues (R&B), rock and roll, and country music, all of which would frequently borrow the song structure and phrasing of early Delta blues heard on recordings by the likes of Peetie Wheatstraw of Cotton Plant (Woodruff County)—best remembered for his direct influence on Robert Johnson, who, in turn, served as a musical mentor to Robert Lockwood Jr. when Johnson lived with Lockwood’s mother Arkansas’s First Radio Station near Helena, which WOK was the first radio station served as the de facin Arkansas—and the first radio to capital of blues station of its kind in the mid-South. music in the Delta Started in 1922 by Harvey C.

It was only after moving north that she began to play blues, jazz, and R&B publicly. Her 1945 hit “Strange Things Happening Every Day” is often cited as the first rock and roll record. The song was later covered by Johnny Cash, who said Tharpe was his favorite singer when he was a child. By this time, one of the most important figures in the history of Arkansas music was in New York paying his dues. Songwriter, musician, band leader, and jump blues pioneer Louis\n\n11\n\nJordan of Brinkley (Monroe County) was born in 1908 into a musical household and studied at Arkansas Baptist College in Little Rock before he left the state to pursue a career that—for nearly a decade beginning in 1942—would see him dominate the R&B charts as the “King of the Jukebox.” With his 1943 hit “Ration Blues,” Jordan became the first black musician to achieve “mainstream” crossover success on both the pop and country charts. Jordan’s influence was as broad as it was deep. He has been called the “Father of Rhythm & Blues” and the “Grandfather of Rock ’n’ Roll” by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (he was inducted in 1987) and has been cited as a key influence by fellow musical legends including Chuck Berry, B. B. King, Bob Dylan, and James Brown. Popular Music in the Post–World War II Era The roughly three decades following World War II became the most important period for music in Arkansas, both in terms of the number of artists and other musical figures hailing from the state as well as the music they produced during this time. Journalist and Arkansas music historian Stephen Koch, host of the NPR-affiliated radio program Arkansongs, wrote, “It’s literally impossible to overstate the significance of this period— both in terms of the product of our fellow Arkansawyers as well as the deep and lasting marks they left—on the music world. The number of important players in the music industry rivaled that of nearly any other state, and their impact and significance may exceed it. The global influence that they had is truly staggering, especially when one considers how little credit the state\n\nSonny Burgess and the Pacers; circa 1957.

It cannot be denied that Arkansas has had a tangible and disparate role in shaping the record collection of almost anyone who has one.” It was across the Mississippi River in Memphis, Tennessee, that artists began building upon the foundation of Tharpe’s early work, laying the groundwork for rock and roll. Much of this was done at Sun Records, where artists like Cash, Billy Lee Riley of Pocahontas (Randolph County), and Sonny Burgess of Newport (Jackson County) found a home, however briefly. Riley and Burgess continued to perform rockabilly music, often in venues along a storied stretch of Arkansas highway now known as Rock ’n’ Roll Highway 67. Cash, who had moved to Dyess (Mississippi County) with his family as a young boy, joined fellow Memphis-based Sun Records alumni Charlie Rich of Colt (St. Francis County) and Conway Twitty of Helena (who had already sat atop the rock and pop charts) in pursuing their ambitions in Nashville, Tennessee, as country singers. All three achieved legendary status, while Cash transcended boundaries to become a cross-cultural icon to his generation and those to come. He was the recipient of twenty Grammy Awards (most coming late in his career and some awarded posthumously), Kennedy Center honors, and the National Medal of Arts. He is a member of the Country Music, Rockabilly, Gospel, Rock and Roll, and Songwriters Halls of Fame; as of 2013, he is the only person ever inducted into all five. Given its largely rural population during this period, Arkansas had no shortage of native musicians who decided to pursue country music. In the early part of the postwar era, the trade publications referred to the music of rural America as “folk,” while the music industry used the “hillbilly” label. Either moniker would have been embraced by Jimmy Driftwood of Timbo (Stone County), who used his grandfather’s homemade guitar in the process of penning literally thousands of songs over the course of his life. Driftwood’s chosen career was as a teacher, and after earning his degree in education from Arkansas State Teachers College (which later became the University of Central Arkansas), he began writing songs as a way to make learning more interesting for his students. Driftwood’s greatest success as a songwriter and musician came relatively late in life. He became a member of\n\nthe Grand Ole Opry in the 1950s and was in his fifties when he charted six songs simultaneously on the pop and country charts in 1959. Five Driftwood songs would eventually earn Grammy Awards, including “The Battle of New Orleans”—a song written in 1936 as a lesson for his students—which was named Song of the Year in 1959. Conway Twitty (born Harold Lloyd Jenkins) was one of the top country artists of the twentieth century. In 1943, when he was about ten, his family moved to Helena from Louisiana. He formed his own band, the Phillips County Ramblers, and, after serving in the military, went to Memphis to pursue his music career. It was here that he took his stage name by combining Conway, Arkansas, and Twitty, Texas. By 1958, his rock and roll recording “It’s Only Make Believe” was number one. But even with his success as a rock and roll performer, Twitty preferred country music. By 1965, he had changed genres. His 1968 recording “Next in Line” became his first country number-one single. Twitty released dozens of top-rated singles in his rock and country careers, recording some 110 albums. In the 1970s, Twitty and fellow country star Loretta Lynn collaborated on a number of highly successful duet recordings. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999. Future country legend Glen Campbell of Billstown (Pike County) hailed from southwestern Arkansas, meaning that a migration to Memphis and then Nashville was less natural. He picked up the guitar as a youth, and, in the mid-1950s, moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to play in a band with his uncle; he later formed his own band. While honing his skills, Campbell became friends with fellow Arkansas expatriate and guitarist Louie Shelton of Little Rock, and then moved to Hollywood, California, in 1960 to work as a session musician. Campbell was quickly recognized as a formidable guitar player and found plenty of work (along with Shelton) as part of the renowned Wrecking Crew group of studio players. During this period, he played on records for a varied list of artists that included Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard, Jan and Dean, and Nat King Cole. For a time, he was also a key component of producer Phil Spector’s famed Wall of Sound. Campbell’s session work was also heard on the Beach Boys’ landmark Pet Sounds album, and, for a period in the mid1960s, Campbell was a touring member of the\n\nBeach Boys, filling in for Brian Wilson, who had tired of the road. Campbell also worked to launch his own solo career and struck gold in 1967 with “Gentle on My Mind” and “By the Time I Get to Phoenix”— performances that earned him five of his nine Grammy Awards. Eventually, Campbell’s listener-friendly brand of country pop topped the charts nine times on the way to his 2005 induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Campbell is just a single example of an influential musical artist from Arkansas for whom the lines between country and rock were blurred. This was also the case with Levon Helm of Elaine (Phillips County), who picked up the guitar at an early age and performed in talent shows around Helena with his sister. What he described as the “hambone” elements of their act may have played a role in Helm’s fascination with the drums. It was the drumming that led to his hiring on as a teenager with rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins of Huntsville (Madison County), known for his wild stage antics. It was through Hawkins and his connections north of the border in Canada that Helm would meet the members of the group of multi-instrumentalists and singers that eventually became known simply as the Band. Often credited as being the progenitors of the Americana genre, the Band was adored by fans and critics alike, and Helm became one of the most respected drummers of the era. The Band’s active period with its original lineup began in 1967 and ended less than a decade later amid differences in creative vision between Helm and singer/guitarist Robbie Robertson. Their final concert in their original configuration was chronicled in the acclaimed Martin Scorsese documentary The Last Waltz—a project that Helm never truly embraced due to creative and logistical conflicts, again, with Robertson. The remaining members of the group reunited in 1983, releasing several studio albums, touring intermittently, and playing at their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994—all without Robertson. The Band called it quits for good in 1999 following the death of Helm’s dear friend—bass player and singer Rick Danko. Helm was already battling throat cancer by this time, which severely marred his distinctive singing voice. He played several years with his own band, leaving the vocal duties to others, including his daughter Amy Helm. By 2004, he was singing again and later released two studio\n\n13\n\nalbums and one live album, all of which won Grammy Awards. Helm died of cancer in 2012. Straightforward, “Southern-fried” rock and roll was the style of Black Oak Arkansas (BOA), led by the flamboyant front man “Jim Dandy” Mangrum of Black Oak (Craighead County). His onstage mannerisms and vocal trademarks were unabashedly copied by David Lee Roth of the more successful Van Halen (with Mangrum’s evident but unsolicited approval). All of the members of BOA originally hailed from Craighead County but spent some time based in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Memphis, where they signed with the “I’ll Take You There” mostly R&B-oriented Al Bell recalled writing the song Stax Records as the “I’ll Take You There” while sitting on Knowbody Else. The the hood of an old school bus that band finally signed was rusting in his family’s back yard with Atlantic subsidiary Atco and settled in North Little Rock. “We were preat a compound in the pared to go into Muscle Shoals and Ozark Mountains, record the Staple Singers when I got where many of their word that my brother was dead,” Bell antics were chronisaid. After the funeral, Bell said that cled by manager and he did not want to be in the house future central Arkanwhere everyone was gathered. “I sas concert promoter went back there and sat on the hood Butch Stone.

I’ll take you there.’” as the record-buying public became more enamored of the disco and “urban cowboy” fads. Still, BOA continued to release albums despite frequent personnel changes, even involving Mangrum. As of 2013, the group was still playing occasional concerts as Jim Dandy’s Black Oak Arkansas. The disco craze would prove to be the high point in the already distinguished career of Johnnie Taylor of Crawfordsville (Crittenden County). Even though he was well established as a respected blues, soul, gospel, and R&B singer and one of the biggest artists charting hits for Stax, Taylor was perhaps best known for his 1976 hit “Disco Lady,” which spent four weeks at the top of the pop chart and was the first single ever certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of two million copies. Much of Taylor’s tenure at Stax was spent while the label was being run by\n\n14\n\nAl Bell of Brinkley, who made Taylor a marquee artist at the label along with icons like Isaac Hayes and the Staple Singers. Bell is the writer of “I’ll Take You There,” arguably the Staples’ signature song. The R&B talent from Arkansas was prodigious. “Little Willie” John of Cullendale (Ouachita County) had a short but extraordinary career as an R&B artist. He was the first to cut the song “Fever,” which went on to be recorded numerous times by Peggy Lee, Barry Gibb, and Madonna, to name a few. The John recording, produced by Henry Glover of Hot Springs (who was also a trusted friend of Levon Helm throughout his career), hit the top of the R&B chart in 1956. John’s personal demons caused his star to fade, and he charted his last hit in 1961. He died in prison in 1968, but the significance of his contributions did not go unrecognized; he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Al Green of Forrest City (St. Francis County) was one of the world’s brightest musical stars in the early 1970s when he released a string of number-one albums, until a domestic incident with a girlfriend at his Memphis home pushed him into the ministry. While preaching, Green found middling success exclusively as a gospel singer but gravitated back to R&B in the late 1980s and went on to release a number of secular albums that did well but never achieved the success he enjoyed at the peak of his career. The blues continued to thrive in Arkansas in the postwar years in the hands of such musicians as Williamson, Lockwood, and Nighthawk. It was with the latter that a young Frank “Son” Seals of Osceola got his start as a drummer. He soon picked up the guitar and began tearing up the Chicago blues scene. His contemporary, Luther Allison of Widener (St. Francis County), taught himself to play guitar and went on to share the stage with the likes of Howlin’ Wolf and Freddie King. Jazz, Opera, and Classical Music in the Modern Era Arkansas is not commonly associated with jazz, opera, or classical music even though recognition is warranted. Pharoah Sanders, born in Little Rock, worked as a sideman for John Coltrane and Don Cherry before setting out on his own. He became one of the most admired saxophone players in jazz, moving from avant-garde to hard bop and post-bop. He became a free jazz\n\npioneer, eventually influencing his former menTroubled Island happened to be one of more tor, Coltrane, with his dissonant style.

McBeth served as conductor of the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra from 1971 to 1973 and is credited with making the ensemble a viable and financially stable entity with its own permanent venue and professional musicians. In 1975, McBeth was named composer laureate of Arkansas—the first composer laureate in the United States. Late Twentieth Century and Looking Forward The 1980s saw far less Arkansas music finding national attention; the careers of the postwar luminaries were either slumping or in permanent decline. Little Rock’s Ho-Hum flirted with mainstream rock and roll success, even seeing a song of theirs used in an episode of the popular television program Melrose Place. Little Rock band Ashtray Babyhead found some interest from major labels with its brand of hook-laden power-pop but ultimately never achieved success as a group even after re-branding themselves with the radio-friendly moniker the Kicks. Member Jeff Matika eventually joined Arkansas native Jason White of North Little Rock (Pulaski County) in the ranks of popular rock band Green Day as a touring member. The future of Arkansas music remains bright, however. For example, Trout Fishing in America of Prairie Grove (Benton County) combined keen talent, hard work, and high-mileage vehicles in building a loyal audience stretching from coast to coast. Between 1979 and 2010, the duo, consisting of bassist Keith Grimwood and guitarist Ezra Idlet, released nearly two dozen albums—most on their own Trout Music label—as well as two books and at least two full-length concert videos. Almost half of the albums were marketed as “family” releases because of their kid-friendly content. As a result, many of the dates on their full touring schedule consist of daytime concerts for families, followed the same evening by more adult-oriented concerts in clubs. The band has been nominated for four Grammy Awards. Multi-platinum-selling rock band Evanescence of Little Rock won Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Hard Rock Performance in 2004 while being nominated for three others, including Album of the Year. The group, led by singer and multi-instrumentalist Amy\n\n16\n\nLee, is still producing music and touring as of 2013 despite numerous personnel changes. Country singer Joe Nichols of Rogers (Benton County) signed his first record deal at age nineteen and, between 2003 and 2011, became a Music Row veteran with eight studio albums including a greatest hits compilation that included three number-one singles. Shaffer Smith of Camden (Ouachita County), better known by his stage name Ne-Yo, is a singer/songwriter, producer, and actor known for collaborations with some of the biggest names in R&B and hip-hop music. As of 2013, he has been nominated for thirteen Grammy Awards and has won three. Memphis-based Americana and southern alt-country-rock band Lucero, fronted by Ben Nichols of Little Rock, was formed in 1998 and, by 2013, had released nine studio albums on at least five labels, including Nobody’s Darlings, which was produced by legendary pioneer of the “Memphis Sound” Jim Dickinson of Little Rock and released in 2005 on their own Liberty & Lament label, as well as 1372 Overton Park (2009) and Women & Work (2012). A line can be drawn from Arkansas artists such as Louis Jordan and even comedian Rudy Ray Moore of Fort Smith to hip-hop and rap music. Jordan made copious use of the spoken word\n\nLucero frontman Ben Nichols at the 2012 Arkansas Sounds music festival in Little Rock.\n\nPhoto: Mike Keckhaver\n\nin his work, and his music is seen by many as a forerunner to rap and hip-hop. Arkansas’s own rap/hip-hop scene began bubbling under the surface in the 1980s and is active in the twenty-first century with a substantial number of prolific artists. No Arkansas rappers, however, have yet managed to gain the notoriety of their counterparts in other southern cities such as Memphis, New Orleans, and Houston, Texas. The talent pool of Arkansas musicians is seemingly not as wide nor deep as it was during the postwar heyday, but the soil has been turned, and the influential seeds of the pantheon of Arkansas music are planted in fertile ground, leaving a rich legacy for those who will come after.\n\nT\n\nFor additional information: Arkansongs. http://www.ualr.edu/kuar/arkansongs/ (accessed December 19, 2012).

Blues is acknowledged as the root from which sprang jazz, rhythm and blues (R&B), rock and roll, and hip-hop; in addition, it has informed the genres of country and western, gospel, and bluegrass. Blues and its offspring have long since crossed the globe, but its standard-bearers are largely confined to the Mississippi River Delta, especially eastern Arkansas and western Mississippi. Emerging in part from call-and-response “field hollers” dating from the slavery era, blues had practitioners originally belonging to many different groups with their own musical styles. Most scholars believe that commercial blues was born around the start of the twentieth century and popularized by bandleader/songwriter W. C. Handy. Traveling medicine shows played the region, and blues stars were among the first to test 78 rpm recording technology. The genre gained momentum in the 1920s with female vocalists such as Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith and with stage shows and brass bands. This style largely faded with the Great Depression. Handy’s own description of how he first heard what became known as blues was more the standard image— blues tunes played by a nondescript solo male street performer. In the 1930s, William Bunch, known as Peetie Wheatstraw, of Cotton Plant (Woodruff\n\nCounty), Roosevelt Sykes of Elmar (Phillips County), and Robert “Washboard Sam” Brown of Walnut Ridge (Lawrence County) were among the era’s most popular and prolific blues performers. Washboard Sam, best known for the song “Mama Don’t Allow,” also recorded under the names Ham Gravy and Shufflin’ Sam—and sometimes performed with his half-brother “Big Bill” Broonzy, who was raised in Langdale (Jefferson County). Casey Bill Weldon, born in Pine Bluff (Jefferson County), had a mid-1930s hit, “Somebody Changed the Lock on My Door,” and recorded as a member of the Memphis Jug Band, the Hokum Kings, and the Washboard Rhythm Kings. Locally, Marianna (Lee County), Forrest City (St. Francis County), Brinkley (Monroe County), Osceola (Mississippi County), and many other Arkansas cities were brimming with homegrown and transplanted talent, and patrons packed clubs with names like the Dipsy Doodle, White Swan, Blue Flame, and Wilson’s Tell-‘Em-‘BoutMe Cafe. In 1941, a blues music radio program, King Biscuit Time, began broadcasting five days a week on KFFA 1360 AM out of Helena (Phillips County). For the first time in its birthplace, blues was heard regularly live over the airwaves, a medium that knew no color line, and recognition of both King Biscuit Time and the blues widened. “Sunshine” Sonny Payne was employed at KFFA at the inception of King Biscuit Time in the 1940s and has hosted the Peabody Award–\n\n17\n\nwinning program into the twenty-first century, interrupted only by his World War II service. Host to Elmore James, Johnny Shines, Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Robert Johnson, and countless others, Helena-West Helena (as it is now called) was already a bustling music town with a lively nightlife. With the success of King Biscuit Time, still more bluesmen were attracted to the region. Others, like James Cotton, “Forrest City” Joe Pugh, Fred Below, and Willie “Big Eyes” Smith, did not have as far to travel to catch the zeitgeist. In addition to the ever-growing audience, the program Bluesman CeDell Davis performing at the White Water Tavern in Little Rock; helped launch a number of percirca 2008. Courtesy: Dotty Oliver/Little Rock Free Press formers. King Biscuit Time made a star of the show’s originator, Aleck “Rice” Miller (a.k.a. Sonny Boy Williamson), a decade before he ever cut a record. Williamson was even honored with his own brand of corn meal, bags of which displayed him atop a giant corncob. Robert Lockwood Jr., Houston Stackhouse, Joe Willie Wilkins, Robert “Dudlow” Taylor, and James “Peck” Curtis, who had played on Blytheville (Mississippi County) radio in the mid-1930s, all took their turns as King Biscuit Boys on King Biscuit Time, as did many others. Some heard their first electric guitar on the show, an experience signaling a new era, courtesy of Lockwood, the de facto stepson of performer Robert Johnson (who spent likely the most settled period of his life in Helena). After two years on King Biscuit Time, Lockwood, born in Turkey Scratch (Phillips County), had his own show promoting Mother’s Best Flour. By 1943, Chester Arthur Burnett (known as Howlin’ Wolf), a farmer in the region, did a show promoting Hadacol elixir on KWEM in West Memphis (Crittenden County). These shows’ popularity helped spread blues beyond its core rural black constituency. As black southerners migrated north to catch the industrial revolution, so did the music. Although the solo acoustic performer remained a\n\n18\n\nstaple, blues increasingly featured drums and plugged-in instruments. Howlin’ Wolf, who moved to Chicago, Illinois, and embodied the louder, more aggressive sound until his 1976 death, named this style for the town where he created it—the West Memphis style. It is more popularly known as Chicago blues. Meanwhile in the 1940s, Louis Jordan of Brinkley trademarked the popular, more urbane jump blues. In the midst of the big band era, Jordan’s stripped-down blues- and jazz-based Tympany Five set the prototype in style and substance for R&B and rock combos to come. In addition to his incredible chart success, he influenced such musicians as Chuck Berry, B. B. King, James Brown, and Ray Charles. Around the same time, “Sister Rosetta” Tharpe of Cotton Plant exploded a myriad of taboos with her wild, bluesy electric guitar stylings in a black gospel setting; Isaac Hayes and Johnny Cash both claim her as an influence. Jimmy Witherspoon of Gurdon (Clark County) had a 1949 big band hit with a remake of Bessie Smith’s 1923 song “Ain’t Nobody’s Business.” Guitarist Auburn “Pat” Hare, born in Cherry Valley (Cross County), experimented with distortion. Little Rock (Pulaski County) native author/producer Robert Palmer dubs Hare “the power-chord king” in his Rock & Roll: An Unruly History, crediting Hare with cutting “the first heavy metal record” in 1954. Although he had long performed in combos, “Big Bill” Broonzy subsequently exploited the nostalgia for “authentic” blues performers, often portraying himself as just off the farm. With several tours in the 1950s, Broonzy helped spark European interest in blues. American blues performers proved to be the inspirational source of the early 1960s British Invasion of the American charts: the Rolling Stones recorded with and appeared with Howlin’ Wolf on TV, and both the Yardbirds and the Animals recorded with Sonny Boy Williamson. Albert King, who played a right-handed, flying-V guitar left-handed, is probably the most imitated blues guitarist today, with Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan being just two of King’s acolytes. King, who settled in Crittenden County, is buried in Edmondson (Crittenden County). Like King, guitarists/vocalists “Son” Seals of Osceola, Larry “Totsy” Davis of Little Rock, Willie Cobbs of Smale (Monroe County), and Luther Allison of Widener (St. Francis County) forged\n\nsuccessful blues careers during the sometimes lean 1960s and 1970s, as did lesser-knowns such as Elmon “Driftin’ Slim” Mickle of Keo (Monroe County), as well as Claude “Blue Smitty” Smith and Floyd Jones, both guitarist/vocalists from Marianna who recorded for Chess. Robert Palmer’s 1981 book Deep Blues helped raise scholarly awareness of blues. In the early 1990s, Palmer further helped spark renewed interest in what many saw as an antiquated musical form by producing vibrant albums by the Jelly Roll Kings, with Sam Carr of Marvell (Phillips County) and Frank Frost of Auvergne (Jackson County), along with R. L. Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, and Helena-born CeDell Davis for the Fat Possum label of Oxford, Mississippi, which Palmer helped found. Davis cut a 2002 album produced by Little Rock native Joe Cripps with rock-star power from R.E.M.’s Peter Buck and others. The 1986 inception of Helena’s King Biscuit Blues Festival also helped repopularize blues in its cradle. Worldwide appetite for American blues made international stars of Luther Allison, Eb Davis of Elaine (Phillips County)— both of whom moved to Europe—John Weston of Smale, Michael Burks of Camden (Ouachita County), and other Arkansans who may be better known around the world than in their hometowns. Blues laid the foundation for the entirety of the modern American sound and has influenced generations. Arkansas produced much of the original class of rock and rollers—Sonny Burgess and the Pacers, Billy Lee Riley and His Little Green Men, Roland Janes, cousins Ronnie and Dale Hawkins, Charlie Rich, Johnny Cash, Conway Twitty, Roy Buchanan, and Levon Helm. All were heavily influenced by blues. R&B acts are equally indebted to blues, and many Arkansans contributed to the sound: musician/songwriter/producer Henry Glover, born in Hot Springs (Garland County); Cullendale (Ouachita County) native Little Willie John; Junior Walker, who was born in Blytheville (Mississippi County); Johnnie Taylor of Crawfordsville (Crittenden County); Osceola’s Harvey Scales; Al Green of St. Francis and Lee counties; Lenny Williams of Little Rock; Brinkley-born producer/songwriter Al Bell; and Ne-Yo of Camden, among others. Though other popular musical strains have caught on over the decades, at their core is blues. “I think blues will never die,” said Helena-born slide guitar great Robert Lee “Nighthawk” Mc-\n\nCollum. “You can always come up with something else, but when you wind up, you wind up with the blues every time. It’s just something you can’t get rid of.” The Delta Cultural Center, part of the Department of Arkansas Heritage, opened in 1990 on Helena’s historic Cherry Street. Around the corner is a street named for harmonicist Frank Frost. Once the music of societal outsiders, blues is now celebrated around the world, and, at last, in its birthplace.

Internationally famous Arkansan composers of classical music include Scott Joplin, Florence Beatrice Smith Price, William Grant Still, and Conlon Nancarrow. Sarah Caldwell, who grew up in Fayetteville (Washington County), was a longtime opera director in Boston, Massachusetts, and the first woman to conduct an opera at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Arkansas has been home to opera singers Mary Lewis, Barbara Hendricks, Susan Dunn, Marjorie Lawrence, Mary McCormic, Robert McFerrin Sr., and William Warfield. Classical music figures prominently in academic music degree programs at the state’s universities, and Arkansans have at various times held regular opera performances at the Opera Theatre at Wildwood Park for the Arts in Little Rock (Pulaski County) and at Opera in the Ozarks at Inspiration Point in Eureka Springs (Carroll County). The Arkansas Symphony Orchestra in Little Rock is one of ten symphony orchestras in the state. Classical Music: Early Arkansas History Music figured prominently in early Arkansas history, with traveler Washington Irving identifying French chansons being sung at Arkansas Post in 1832. Early American pioneers brought their own music with them. This folk music was transmitted orally well into the twentieth century and fell into categories such as ballads, religious hymns, and even scatological songs. Familiar tunes usually provided by one or more fiddle players accompanied dancing. Early Arkansans also brought along pianos and sheet music. Surviving sheet music collections contain popular songs as well as non-vocal compositions, including polkas, waltzes, marches, and transcriptions of opera arias. The most “refined” were the parlor songs, while others more suited to the porch than the parlor, such as “Juanita,” were performed outdoors. Church music fell into denominational camps: those who used organs, pianos, or other instru-\n\n20\n\nmental combinations and those who did not and depended on singing schools to teach the “shape note” singing tradition. Training in church music remains an important part of the curriculum at Ouachita Baptist University (OBU) in Arkadelphia (Clark County) and Harding University in Searcy (White County). The first recorded formal concert in Arkansas was held at Arkansas Post in 1821 by a Mr. Fries. Before the Civil War, Batesville (Independence County) residents put on a performance of Joseph Haydn’s The Creation, which requires an orchestra, chorus, and soloists. After 1853, H. G. Hollenberg’s Great Southwest Music House out of Memphis, Tennessee, was the major source for both sheet music—which Hollenberg started publishing himself—and musical instruments. Hollenberg’s Little Rock branch was long the capital city’s leading supplier. Moses Melody Shop in Little Rock followed later. Violinist Ferdinand Zellner gave an Arkansas-related title to his “Fayetteville Polka” in 1856. Benjamin Franklin Scull, son of a pioneering Arkansas County family, composed music for minstrel troupes while studying medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His “I Am Near to Thee,” with words by Little Rock newspaperman John E. Knight and dedicated to Mary E. Woodruff, was published in 1858. Since Arkansas has for a long time occupied a distinctive position in the American imagination, the tune, story, and visual image of “The Arkansas Traveler” attracted international attention. The Arkansas-based version of the Trav-\n\nArkansas Symphony Orchestra strings and woodwinds.\n\nCourtesy: Arkansas Symphony Orchestra\n\neler story is said to have begun in 1840. Sandford C. (Sandy) Faulkner—for whom Faulkner County would later be named—got lost in rural Arkansas and asked for directions at a humble log home. Faulkner, a natural performer, turned the experience into an entertaining presentation in which the Traveler was greeted by the Squatter at the log cabin with humorously evasive responses to his questions. Finally, the Traveler offered to play the second half, or “turn,” of the fiddle tune the Squatter was playing. The tune was the “Arkansas Traveler.” In his happiness at hearing the turn, the Squatter mustered all of the hospitality of his household for the Traveler. When the Traveler again asked directions, the Squatter offered them but suggested that the Traveler would be lucky to make it back to the cottage “whar you kin cum and play on thara’r tune as long as you please.” Following the publication of the story, both Mose Case—an entertainer from Buffalo, New York—and Cincinnati violinist Jose Tasso produced sheet music versions of the tune (the Case version was published in 1863 and distributed widely), and violinist Henri Vieuxtemps played an elaborate set of variations of it, as well as including it in his American Bouquet (No. 6) series. Twentieth-century composer David W. Guion in 1929 wrote a difficult piano concert transcription based on the tune, and Harl McDonald’s The Legend of the Arkansas Traveler was recorded by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1939. An arrangement was also recorded by the Boston Pops Orchestra. Finally, this fiddle tune, improbably supplied with words by a committee, was legislated into becoming Arkansas’s official state song between 1949 and 1963. It is now the state’s official historical song.\n\nTimeline • 1821 – The first formal concert recorded in Arkansas was held at Arkansas Post. • 1856 – Violinist Ferdinand Zellner titled one of his compositions “Fayetteville Polka.” • 1872 – Wolf Detleff Carl Botefuhr became the founding director of music at the University of Arkansas. • 1930 – William Grant Still completed his Afro-American Symphony, which became the first symphony written by an African American to be performed by a major orchestra. • 1960 – Following the disbanding of the Little Rock Civic Symphony, the current Arkansas Symphony Orchestra was formed. • 1976 – University of Arkansas graduate Sarah Caldwell became the first woman to conduct an opera at the Metropolitan Opera House. • 1979 – The Arkansas Chamber Singers formed. • 1997 – Opera star Gretha Boston, the first Arkansan to receive a Tony Award, was inducted into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame.\n\nthe only tune one southern Arkansas band knew. After the war, town bands became popular; Bradford (White County) had an ensemble that included women. Academic institutions, at first academies and then colleges, supplied music education and offered performances. Little Rock’s St. Johns’ College and Arkansas Industrial University (now the University of Arkansas) in Fayetteville were music centers. UA’s founding director of music in 1872 was Wolf Detleff Carl Botefuhr; Moonlight on the Poteau was one of his many compositions. Botefuhr moved to Fort Smith (Sebastian County) in 1881, where he opened his own conservatory and taught the young William Worth Bailey, a talented blind violinist called “the American Paganini.” In 1923, Bailey became the concertmaster of the Fort Smith Symphony; his wife, Katherine Price Bailey, was the conductor and remained in that position for many years.\n\nClassical Music: Civil War through the Gilded Age Many backwoods soldiers received an expanded musical education during the war. The tune “Wait for the Wagon” was fitted with pro-secession and anti-secession lyrics in the spring of 1861, and Harry MacCarthy, “the Arkansas Comedian,” authored the South’s first highly popular song, “The Bonnie Blue Flag.” Civil War brass bands, with their own special music but also transcriptions of newly popular songs, performed on the Fourth of July and other occasions. “Dixie” was rendered by bands during and after the war. The popular song “Lorena” was\n\nOpera: Post Civil War through the Gilded Age The late nineteenth and early twentieth century saw a rise in the popularity of classical music, especially opera—considered a “higher” form of music by the educated elite. In 1870, Little Rock’s first visiting opera company, headed by the famed tenor Pasquilino Brignoli, came by steamboat and presented six operas in a shabby setting, and Little Rock responded by erecting a $50,000 opera house in 1873. Many other\n\n21\n\ncommunities, including Fort Smith, Hot Springs (Garland County), Clarendon (Monroe County), Cotton Plant (Woodruff County), Van Buren (Crawford County), and St. Joe (Searcy County) built what were styled “opera houses.” These structures were used as venues for all kinds of local performances and school events as well as for major national companies passing through by train. However, plays and minstrel shows were more common than opera companies. Classical Music: Twentieth Century During the early part of the twentieth century, music clubs around the state, as well as individual music supporters, began pushing for music education for the young and for quality musical performances for the enjoyment of the citizenry. The music club movement was central to organized culture. Little Rock’s Musical Coterie, founded in 1893, was one of the first groups preceding the Arkansas Federation of Music Clubs formed in 1908. By 1940, there were forty senior and thirty junior clubs around the state. Music was not neglected at the state’s colleges; Frederick Harwood worked from 1913 to 1946 building a music program at what is now Henderson State University in Arkadelphia. For about a decade starting in 1912, Little Rock held May festivals that imported outside orchestras and performers. The Community Concerts organization was active for more than ten years in Little Rock and in other communities in the 1950s. Famous twentieth-century violinist Jascha Heifetz came to El Dorado (Union County) during the oil-boom days. Colleges and high school auditoriums or basketball courts were used for concerts. Radio stations regularly broadcast classical music, including Saturday matinees live from the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In 1933, the Little Rock Civic Symphony, precursor of the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra, was organized and directed by Laurence Powell of the music department at Little Rock Junior College (now the University of Arkansas at Little Rock) as part of the school’s music program. Powell had already organized an orchestra in Fayetteville. Low pay led him to leave Little Rock in 1939, and the group folded. The State Symphony Orchestra and the Arkansas Philharmonic Society followed, but the current Arkansas Symphony Orchestra was not established\n\n22\n\nuntil 1960. By 2013, it was the only symphonic body in the state with some salaried players; all other orchestras operate completely on a per-service basis. Paul W. Klipsch, who began manufacturing high-end high-fidelity speakers in Hope (Hempstead County) in 1946, was an important symphony supporter. Signs of renewed interest in classical music emerged in the mid-1950s. In 1966, the Arkansas Arts Council, which received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, was created to advance the arts in Arkansas, including classical music. New regional orchestras appeared in the mid-twentieth century. The Jonesboro Symphony Orchestra became successively the Northeast Arkansas Symphony Orchestra and then the Delta Symphony Orchestra. Aided by Arkansas Arts Council grants, these orchestras organized youth concerts, held competitions, and expanded their outreach. By 2013, symphony orchestras could be found in Conway (Faulkner County), Fort Smith, Pine Bluff (Jefferson County), El Dorado, Texarkana (Miller County), Fayetteville, Mountain Home (Baxter County), Bentonville (Benton County), and Jonesboro (Craighead County). Children’s concerts, pop concerts, and salutes to the military were featured prominently in regional orchestras. The Arkansas Symphony was praised by the music critic of the Washington Post for its 1976 Bicentennial concert in the national’s capital, and the Fort Smith Symphony made three recordings of William Grant Still compositions for the Naxos label. These various orchestras were not without problems, however. The North Arkansas Symphony, which had made a commercial recording, had to cancel its last concert in 2008 and shut down. The Symphony of Northwest Arkansas started up two years later. Band music, aside from its connection with high school and college football games, declined in popularity, and only one semi-professional band remained active in the state. What is now the Diamond State Chorus, a men’s barbershop singing group, started in 1955, with the women’s group, now called Top of the Rock Chorus, starting in 1961. The Arkansas Chamber Singers, founded in 1979, became the premier volunteer chamber chorus in the state. A musical series, Artspree, succeeded in bringing a variety of individuals and groups to Little Rock, and the Chamber Music Society of Little Rock, founded in 1952, brought in notable\n\nensembles and individuals. In Helena (Phillips County), the Warfield Concerts provided free admission; classical music figured prominently in the offerings. Phillips County’s Lily Peter brought the Philadelphia Orchestra at her own expense to play in Little Rock in 1969. The Hot Springs Music Festival started in 1995 and paired students with professionals to offer public concerts.\n\nter Philharmonic Orchestra and still performed today, it is Still’s most well-known composition and was the first symphony composed by an African American that was performed by a major orchestra. Florence Beatrice Smith Price, a graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music who taught at Cotton Plant Academy and Shorter College in Little Rock but was denied membership in the Arkansas State Music Teachers Association, became the first black female composer to have a work performed by a major American symphony when the Chicago Symphony Orchestra performed her Symphony in E Minor on June 15, 1933.

More recently, opera mezzo-soprano Gretha Boston of Crossett (Ashley County), who was inducted into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame in 1997, debuted at Carnegie Hall in May 1991 with Mozart’s Coronation Mass. The first Arkansan to receive a Tony Award, she won the 1995 Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her role as Queenie in the Broadway revival of Show Boat. Juilliard-trained soprano Barbara Hendricks from Stephens (Ouachita County) had an international career in opera and film and performed at jazz festivals. She also has been noted for her work with refugees and for other humanitarian causes. She also performed at a gala for President Bill Clinton’s 1993 inauguration. Soprano Georgia Ann Laster grew up in Arkansas; a branch of the National Association of Negro Musicians is named after her. Other Arkansan classical and opera musicians who have achieved fame include Mary Lewis of Hot Springs, who made her way to\n\nOpera: Twentieth Century Opera did not fare as well as classical music in the twentieth century, although there were some successes. Beginning in 1941, Hot Springs was home to retired opera star and professor Marjorie Lawrence. She held summer opera coaching sessions at her ranch, Harmony Hills, which advanced the cause of classical and opera music in Arkansas. A nationally famous program supported by the music clubs dating back to 1950, Opera in the Ozarks at Inspiration Point, includes internationally known tenor Chris Merritt among its alumni. Former Metropolitan Opera star Blanche Thebom came to Little Rock in 1973 and founded the Arkansas Opera Theatre. After she left in 1989, it became the Opera Theatre at Wildwood under the direction of Ann Chotard. Following Chotard’s retirement, the board chose to expand the park’s vision, and opera productions have not resumed. Operas were also produced at the state’s universities. An Arkansas State University music teacher, soprano Julia Langford, who performed with City Opera of New York and many regional companies, frequently featured her students in campus productions. Mezzo-soprano Mignon Dunn of Tyronza (Poinsett County), who appeared 653 times at the Metropolitan Opera, was the wife of Kurt Klippstatter, who conducted the Arkansas Symphony in the 1970s. Trailblazers in Classical and Opera Music Classical and opera music may not have achieved the recognition granted more specialized popular forms, but especially notable are the many trailblazers in classical music and opera who have been associated with Arkansas—especially African Americans. Scott Joplin, renowned for his ragtime compositions, wrote his single surviving opera, Treemonisha, with a plot set in Arkansas. William Grant Still of Little Rock completed his Afro-American Symphony in 1930. First performed in 1931 by the Roches-\n\n23\n\ngrand opera via vaudeville and operetta. Her career included radio performances and recordings with His Master’s Voice (HMV), Victor, and RCA. Celebrity status was accorded to Mary McCormic—born Mamie Harris in Belleville (Yell County). A graduate of what is now OBU, she sang in Paris, France, and in Chicago, Illinois, and left behind a recorded legacy. Frances Greer of Piggott (Clayton County) and Helena had an extensive vocal career that included The Frances Greer Show on radio, performances with the Metropolitan and Philadelphia Opera companies, and work in operetta and radio. Susan Dunn of Malvern (Hot Spring County), a Hendrix College graduate, was a prominent soprano during the 1980s and 1990s. One of the important names nationally in opera production was UA graduate Sarah Caldwell, who brought opera back to Boston and became the first woman to conduct an opera at the Metropolitan Opera House, on January 13, 1976. Also making a name for herself in opera is soprano Kristin Lewis of Little Rock, who began her vocal studies at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway and performs around the world. Some other notable Arkansas classical composers, performers, and directors are player-piano composer Conlon Nancarrow of Texarkana; world-renowned composer and conductor Fran-\n\ncis McBeth, who was professor and resident composer at OBU and also conducted the Arkansas Symphony for many years; Jeff Hitt, an outfitter at Yellowstone National Park who composed Yellowstone for Violin and Orchestra; composer John S. Hilliard of Hot Springs, who is especially known for his piano compositions; the Grammy-nominated New York Philharmonic Orchestra English horn player Thomas Stacy, who grew up in Augusta (Woodruff County); and Buryl Red of Little Rock, who is the musical director and conductor of the CenturyMen choral group. UA professor Bruce Benward wrote the bestselling two-volume book Music In Theory and Practice (1963), which has long been the standard in the field.

Once this particular sound was brought by British immigrants to the United States, country music began to change as it was blended with the music of immigrants from other places, as well as with traditional religious hymns and the music of African slaves predominantly residing in the southern United States. Arkansas has had a firm place in the history of country music from its very beginnings in the United States, and the state has been the birthplace of many wellknown country artists, as well as particular style variations of country music. While the folk music of the British Isles was more focused on topics of love and romance, the\n\n24\n\nearly forms of country within the United States were centered on practical topics as well as tragic ones, which can still be heard in the music of popular country artists. Country music was not performed on the radio until 1922, when the music industry decided to broaden the options of available genres. During the 1920s, the instrumental style of what was then known as “hillbilly” music did not stray far from homemade banjos and fiddles. Dr. Smith’s Champion Hoss Hair Pullers were very influential during this time period; they were one of the most popular string bands in Arkansas between 1926 and 1929 and even recorded a few songs at Victor Records in 1928. They proved to be a boon to the public perception of Arkansas music. The 1930s brought a new era and style of country music, as the “hillbilly” fiddle band\n\nsound was beginning to fade out and be replaced by “country/western,” inspired by Jimmie Rodgers of Mississippi, who many consider to be the “Father of Country Music.” This music featured lyrics of grand, romantic ideals of life in the western states and was performed in western cowboy apparel, which is still a common style in country music today. Yodeling also became a popular performance mode in country music. Patsy Montana, born Ruby Blevins, of Garland County was influenced by this new style of country music and wore a typical western get-up, including a cowboy hat and a gun and holster. She was discovered on The National Barn Dance on the radio station WLS from Chicago, Illinois, and her 1935 release “I Want to Be a Cowboy’s Sweetheart” was the first record by a female country/western singer to sell over one million copies. Elton Britt of Zack (Searcy County) and Carolina Cotton (born Helen Hagstrom) of Cash (Craighead County) were also heavily influenced by Rodgers’s yodeling style throughout their music careers in the 1940s. Jimmy Wakely of Mineola (Howard County) was one of the last country musicians to fully embrace the classic image of a “singing cowboy.” He achieved a great deal of national success, appearing in several films with Gene Autry. Two other Arkansas country artists of the 1930s and 1940s, Lonnie Glosson of Judsonia (White County) and Wayne Raney of Wolf Bayou (Cleburne County), popularized the harmonica throughout the United States. Together, Glosson and Raney established a highly successful mail-order harmonica company. Both musicians had somewhat of a “hillbilly boogie” sound; their hit single “Why Don’t You Haul Off and Love Me” was number one on the country music charts in 1949. Glosson’s solo career was also quite successful; his 1936 song “Arkansas Hard Luck Blues” is considered by the Country Music Hall of Fame to be a precedent to the talking blues style of both Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie. The 1940s also brought a new variation of country music called honky-tonk, which is a type of country music with strong beats and lyrics that bemoan misfortune. Several Arkansas country musicians influenced, participated in, and contributed to this mode. T. Texas Tyler of Mena (Polk County), born David Luke Myrick, used honky-tonk instrumentation in his music and combined it with a nearly spoken vocal style. His 1948 hit “Deck of Cards” reached the top of\n\nTimeline • 1922 – John Carson recorded two “hillbilly” songs in Atlanta, considered to be the founding moment for country music in the United States. Arkansas’s own Dr. Smith’s Champion Hoss Hair Pullers, Lonnie Glosson, and Wayne Raney performed in the hillbilly style. • 1932 – Johnny Cash was born. The most famous musical artist to emerge from Arkansas, he was inducted into the Country Music, Rockabilly, Gospel Music, Rock and Roll, and Songwriters Halls of Fame and earned numerous Grammys. • 1933 – Harold Lloyd Jenkins, later known as Conway Twitty, was born. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999. • 1935 – Patsy Montana released “I Want to Be a Cowboy’s Sweetheart,” which was the first record by a female country singer to sell over one million copies. • 1943 – Louis Jordan became the first African-American male to succeed in both the country and pop charts with his single “Ration Blues.” • 1948 – “Lefty” Frizell’s “Deck of Cards” reached the top of the country music charts. • 1950 – “Arkie” Shibley recorded the original version of “Hot Rod Race,” which would later be covered by several major country as well as rock and roll artists. • 1953 – Ronnie Dunn was born in Coleman, Texas; he spent most of his childhood in El Dorado. He and Kix Brooks became Brooks & Dunn, who have won more awards than any other duo in country music history. • 1987 – K. T. Oslin became the first female country artist to win the Country Music Song of the Year award, for her single “80’s Ladies.” • 1987 – Wayland Holyfield’s “Arkansas (You Run Deep in Me)” was adopted as an official Arkansas state song. Holyfield wrote songs for major country artists such as Conway Twitty, George Strait, and Brooks & Dunn. • 2009 – Justin Moore from Poyen (Grant County) released his first album, Justin Moore, which quickly achieved gold status, as did his 2011 album Outlaws Like Me.\n\nthe country music charts, and its storytelling style was widely imitated. “Lefty” Frizell, who was born in Texas but grew up in Arkansas, debuting as a singer in El Dorado (Union County), also performed country in the honky-tonk style. Willie Nelson has claimed that he and many current artists have been influenced by this style. Considered to be one of the most influential artists in the history of country music, Frizell released several chart-topping honky-tonk hits, including “If You’ve Got the Money, Honey, I’ve\n\n25\n\nSheet music for Patsy Montana’s “I Want to Be a Cowboy’s Sweetheart.” Courtesy: Old State House Museum Collection Got the Time” (1950), “I Love You a Thousand Ways” (1950), and “Saginaw, Michigan” (1964). He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1982. Country music, throughout its history, has tended to blur the lines between genres. Almost all country music borrows elements of song structure from early Delta blues music, so it is unsurprising that several country artists have crossed over into the rhythm and blues (R&B) genre. The Browns of Sparkman (Dallas County) succeeded in straddling the line between country and R&B with their hit “The Three Bells” in 1959. The Browns were also important in developing the smoother, more elegant “Nashville sound” of country that would further develop and become popular in the 1990s. Country artist Floyd Cramer, who grew up in Huttig (Union County), also influenced the Nashville sound with his smooth piano playing in songs like “Last Date,” which hit number two on the Billboard charts. Cramer is widely considered to be the most influential pianist in the history of country music due to de-\n\n26\n\nveloping the bluesy “slip-note” style that influenced many pianists who would follow him. Country music was beginning to cross over into rock and roll during the 1950s as well. Crawford County native Jesse Lee “Arkie” Shibley’s 1950 recording of “Hot Rod Race,” which hit number five on the country charts, is considered to be influential to the origination of rock and roll as a genre. He also influenced the genre of blues with the talking blues style that he incorporated into many of his songs. Conway Twitty, born Harold Lloyd Jenkins, was also influential in both the country and rock genres. Growing up in Helena (Phillips County), Twitty began as a rock artist and was hugely successful, releasing several singles that hit number one on the pop charts, such as “It’s Only Make Believe” in 1958. However, as the years passed, he played more in the country style. He released several singles that reached number one on the country charts, such as “Next in Line” in 1968. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999 and is still one of the most successful musical acts to emerge from Arkansas. Levon Helm of Marvell (Phillips County) also blurred the lines between the country and rock genres; in the late 1960s, he was a leading member of the early Americana group the Band. Several country artists also ventured into the pop genre and influenced modern country with a more pop-like sound. Jimmy Driftwood of Timbo (Stone County), who was a member of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1950s, released six singles that made the country and pop charts simultaneously in 1959. Glen Campbell of Pike County, a renowned country guitarist, played guitar on records for popular artists such as Elvis Presley, Merle Haggard, and Nat King Cole. He also toured as a member of the Beach Boys for several months during the 1960s and won several Grammys for his contributions to both country and pop music. Charlie Rich of Colt (St. Francis County), a popular country musician from the late 1950s to the 1970s, ventured into several different genres, including pop, gospel, blues, and rockabilly. His single “The Most Beautiful Girl” topped both the country and pop charts, and he was influential to the lush, pop-like “countrypolitan” sound that is popular in Las Vegas, Nevada, and other large cities. Narvel Felts of Keiser (Mississippi County), a country musician of the 1970s, also worked within the rockabilly genre and is in the\n\nRockabilly Hall of Fame. The Cate Brothers of Washington County, although they were never as widely successful as Rich or Felts, were also well respected in their musical crossovers from country into the rockabilly and rock genres. The country artist who experimented with the most genres throughout his career, as well as arguably the most famous musical artist to emerge from Arkansas, was Johnny Cash. Born in Kingsland (Cleveland County), Cash explored country, gospel, blues, pop, and rock and roll. He had several singles, such as “Ring of Fire” and “Understand Your Man,” that topped both the country and pop charts. He is also the only musician ever to be inducted into the Country Music, Rockabilly, Gospel Music, Rock and Roll, and Songwriters Halls of Fame. He also garnered several Grammys throughout his musical career. While many country artists were gaining success through venturing into other genres, the Wilburn Brothers of Hardy (Sharp County) were taking advantage of listeners’ appreciation for a more classic form of country. Performing from the late 1950s into the 1970s, this sibling duo performed at the Grand Ole Opry and received the only “lifetime recording contract” ever made by Decca Records. They helped launch the careers of several more modern country artists, such as Loretta Lynn, Patty Loveless, and the Osborne Brothers. Modern Arkansas country music has moved somewhat back into a more traditional mode, although it often still crosses over into pop music. Some recent Arkansas musicians have had a great deal of success within Arkansas as well as nationally. Wayland Holyfield of Mallett Town (Conway County) is an excellent example of this more modern yet homely country sound; his single “Arkansas (You Run Deep in Me)” was adopted by the Arkansas General Assembly as an official state song in 1987. He has also been inducted into the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame and written/co-written songs for artists such as Conway Twitty, George Strait, and Brooks & Dunn. Ronnie Dunn, born in Texas, was raised in El Dorado (Union County). Dunn was a member of the wildly successful and internationally famous country duo Brooks & Dunn and has been performing since the 1970s. K. T. Oslin of Crossett (Ashley County) was the first female artist to win the Country Music Song of the Year, for her hit single “80’s Ladies,” and has also garnered several Grammy Awards. Tra-\n\ncy Lawrence of Foreman (Little River County), who, like Dunn, was born in Texas and raised in Arkansas, released several chart-topping singles during the early 1990s, such as “Texas Tornado,” “Time Marches On,” and “I See It Now.” Collin Raye of De Queen (Sevier County) has had multiple hit singles, such as “Little Rock” and “Every Second,” and has garnered multiple Country Music Award nominations. Joe Nichols of Rogers (Benton County) released several hugely successful studio albums between 1996 and 2013 and has had several number-one hit singles. Justin Moore of Poyen (Grant County) is one of the most recent acts from Arkansas to gain success within the world of country music; both of his records, Justin Moore (2009) and Outlaws Like Me (2011), have achieved gold status. Throughout the years, country music has transformed from a somewhat down-home genre to one that is popular in cities and cosmopolitan areas as well. However, throughout all of country’s changes in sound, as well as country artists’ evolutions in style, it has retained its solidly American sensibility and its themes of love and loss, family, and practical struggles of the working class.

Early folk music in Arkansas falls into two broad categories: folksongs (which do not present a narrative) and ballads (which tell a story). Folksong collectors sought to record and preserve this traditional music in the twentieth century, with Vance Randolph, John Quincy Wolf, and others working in Arkansas. The lyric folksong form of the blues developed in the Arkansas and Mississippi Delta regions in the late nineteenth century among the first generation of African Americans to come of age after slavery. Protest music of the early to mid-twentieth century, dealing with labor and social conditions—as well as war, civil rights, and politics—took on the folk style and sensibility, contributing to the renewed interest in traditional folk music, termed the folk revival, of the 1950s and 1960s. The mid-to-late twentieth century brought the contemporary/popular folk style into prominence, with the singer/songwriter at the center. Most commentators identify verbal material as folklore on the basis of its oral dissemination, its performance taking place in situations whe"
