The singer will star in the Netflix series The Umbrella Academy which is supposed to be executive produced by Steve Blackman.\n\nThe series is about a dysfunctional superhero family that forms the collective, Umbrella Academy. The family works together to find out information regarding their father, Reginald Hardgrave’s mystery death. The series takes place in a surrogate universe, where real life events like the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy did not happen.”\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning singer reportedly signed a one-year deal with the series, will be playing the role of Cha-Cha. Cha- Cha is a socio-path who travels within different time periods to kill her main targets.

This will be Ms. Blige first big television role although she has had guest spots on The Wiz Live!, Empire, and Black-ish.\n\nThere’s no premiere date as of yet.
