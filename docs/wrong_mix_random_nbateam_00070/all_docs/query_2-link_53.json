        "text": "T.I. and Mary J. Blige’s collaboration “Don’t Forget” — confirmed as the first single from Tip’s upcoming Paper Trail reissue — leaked this week, MTV reports. The reissue of T.I.’s 2008 album is expected out this summer and features five new tracks. With T.I. heading to prison to serve a one-year sentence for gun charges, the song will likely serve as the rapper’s goodbye, coming on the heels of his reflective “Dead and Gone” duet with Justin Timberlake. “Don’t forget to remember me,” Blige sings on the chorus. “Please keep me in your heart, if we ever have to part.” According to TMZ, T.I. has 11 days until he must report to a low-security prison in Forrest City, Arkansas.\n\nAccording to MTV, Kanye West’s original feature on Paper Trail‘s “On Top of the World” — a verse that was ultimately excised from the record — might be resurrected for the reissue. Other potential Paper Trail tracks include “Like I Do” featuring The-Dream and “My Dear” with Ciara. Plus, Tip was rumored to have been working in the studio with Dr. Dre during Grammy weekend, so perhaps something will come out of those sessions. As for “Don’t Forget,” T.I. and Blige reportedly plan to shoot a video for the single at an undisclosed location.\n\nTrending\n\nRelated Stories:"
