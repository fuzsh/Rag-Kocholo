        "text": "At first glance this photo of Sean Penn and Volodymyr Zelenskiy looked like a macho man contest. Sean is filming a documentary about the Russian invasion and he has flown to Ukraine three times while working on it. In the photo Sean looks pleased as punch while he’s handing Zelenskiy one of his Oscars and telling him to bring it back to Malibu after he wins the war. Zelenskiy looks a little puzzled by the odd gesture and the photo op, but he indulged the actor.\n\nLast year, Hopper Penn, 29, and Dylan Penn, 31, were at the Cannes Film Festival with their father Sean Penn, presenting his film Flag Day, in which they both appeared. THIS year they are both at the Rome Film Festival with their OWN film, Signs of Love, with no help from their proud Dad. Both kids were introduced to acting in their father’s earlier films and fell in love with it. Dylan stars in Signs of Love as a young man struggling and selling drugs in a rough Philadelphia neighborhood who falls in love with a deaf girl from a well-off family. He begins to imagine a better life, but his alcoholic sister (played by Dylan) and low level companions make it difficult. Hopper and Dylan have appeared in a number of films but these are their biggest roles so far, so parents Sean and Robin Wright are both (separately) pleased.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nOkay, this photo puts a lot of pieces together. It’s Law & Order actor Vincent D’Onofrio and his cute daughter, actress Leila George (her mother is Italian born actress Greta Scacci), together in Venice, Italy. Leila is the over 30 years younger wife who filed for divorce from Sean Penn, but keeps changing her mind. Finally the divorce was finalized in April, but they were seen out to dinner in NYC earlier this week. Leila and Sean have social activism and environmentalism in common so their relationship might continue but in a different way. She is not the first of Sean’s wives to file for divorce and change her mind a few times…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nSean Penn and his daughter Dylan looked really happy just a few weeks ago at The Cannes Film Festival when their father-daughter movie Flag Day premiered. Their festive mood didn’t last long- Cannes reviewers had nothing good to say about the film, calling it torpid, drab, ponderous, and grandiose. Just five years ago Sean debuted his film The Last Face at Cannes and the audience alternately laughed out loud and booed- declaring the film the “worst” at Cannes. So he probably wasn’t surprised. If this film doesn’t make money, at least it might give Dylan’s acting career a boost…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nIt’s about time. We don’t OFTEN agree with Sean Penn but this time we have say he’s absolutely RIGHT. Sean laid down the law on the set of his film Gaslit with Julia Roberts and announced that he won’t show up for work until EVERYONE on the set is vaccinated. Crew members working on set and close to actors were required to be vaccinated but crew members not in close proximity were not. Penn is definitely throwing his weight around, but in a GOOD way. Free vaccinations will be given at an on-site clinic to make it convenient for everyone. Productions should have done this a LONG time ago and this might catch on, so Penn is doing everyone a favor.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA – Sean Penn chatting with Randy Gerber outside Nobu\n\nSean Penn has been helping people with his CORE charity since 2010 so it makes sense that he’d get around to giving his kids a career boost. He directed and stars in Flag Day, which just screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Dylan Penn, 30, and Hopper Penn, 27, both look excited to be there with their father. (Dylan inherited good looks from her mother Robin Wright) The film is based on a true story about a father leading a double life as a con man/crook so he can take excellent care of his daughter. Hopper plays his estranged son. Both Dylan and Hopper have been working on assorted projects of their own, but this film should open more doors in Hollywood for them.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA,\n\nSean Penn, 59, took his kids out to dinner in Malibu along with his girlfriend – as usual he’s the oldest one in the group. Above, he had a few parting words for his son Hopper, 26. Sean’s daughter Dylan Penn, 29, is a model and aspiring actress and his son Hopper is an actor and occasional producer. Sean’s girlfriend of four years is Australian actress Leila George, 28. She’s the daughter of actors Vincent D’Onofrio and Greta Scacchi, and grew up in Australia. Sean Penn always seems to attract beautiful young women – it’s quite astonishing…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nThe minute we heard (well over a year ago) that Sean Penn was planning to direct his girlfriend Charlize Theron in a movie, we predicted the demise of the relationship. We figured Penn wouldn’t be able to control his impulses and temper under difficult circumstances and Charlize would be turned off. Whether it was his temper or his limited talent, Charlize ended the romance shortly after filming. Some critics imagined that it only took her one look at the rushes to cut all ties. The movie, The Last Face, was declared the worst at Cannes, with the audience alternately laughing out loud and booing. One critic called it “the pompous nadir of Sean Penn’s career” and and it was suggested he stop directing. To her credit, Charlize showed up for the premier and her reunion with Penn was described as “awkward.”\n\nAbove, Charlize is in the black tux (with heels) standing between Sean’s son Hopper (he’s in the movie) and Javier Bardem, who plays her love interest. Sean is not wearing the required black tie.\n\nPhoto Credit: AKM-GSI\n\nOh my. The truth DOES tend to drift to the surface eventually. Sean Penn’s ego must be crushed since it has been revealed that drug kingpin El Chapo (Joaquin Guzman) had NEVER HEARD of Sean Penn before their secret interview! The New York Post reported that Mexican actress Kate Del Castillo had been exchanging flirty emails with El Chapo and arranged the Rolling Stone interview with Penn. El Chapo’s lawyer told his client that Sean Penn has starred in “21 Grams” but the drug lord had never seen the movie and had no idea who Penn was. It turns out that El Chapo was actually very interested in meeting Del Castillo and did the Penn interview to get closer to HER. So Sean Penn’s STAR POWER did not open doors – it was actually Kate Del Castillo’s SEX APPEAL that landed Penn that interview!\n\nPhoto Credit: AKM-GSI"
