        "text": "One of Time magazine’s icons listed in “The 100 Most Influential People of 2022” and the recipient of the 2022 Billboard ICON Award, the undisputed Queen of Hip Hop Soul, Mary J. Blige, announces her “Good Morning Gorgeous Tour” presented by Hologic in partnership with The Black Promoters Collective (BPC). Grammy® Award-winning and Oscar-nominated Blige will perform in 23 cities, including a visit to Little Caesars Arena on Saturday, September 24 at 8 p.m. Blige will be joined by special guests, platinum-selling, Grammy® Award-winning artist Ella Mai and Queen Naija.\n\nMary J. Blige has been one of a select handful of artists at the top of our desired list to partner with since the initial construction of The BPC. Having her support in our mission so early in the process is a testament to the hard work we have put in to bring superior cultural experiences powered by black business to the masses. We firmly believe this is a match made in heaven and are honored to partner with the Queen,” states The BPC Co-Founder and President Shelby Joyner.\n\n“We’re thrilled to continue our partnership with Mary J. Blige as the presenting sponsor for her Good Morning Gorgeous tour,” said Steve MacMillan, Hologic’s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. “As a global leader in women’s health, we’re committed to emphasizing the lifesaving importance of preventive screenings and the annual Well Woman exam, and Mary’s voice is a powerful way to reach millions of women.”"
