        "text": "â€” Realness has been Mary J. Blige's essence since she signed her first recording contract in 1989. She was a bigvoiced, eager teenager from Yonkers who got her break by recording a song in a booth at a shopping mall. Her 1992 debut album, What's the 411?, presented her not with standard rhythm-and-blues glamour but as a neighborhood girl, with guest rappers, sampled beats and rough notes, adding up to \"hip-hop soul.\" She took over more of the songwriting on her next album, My Life, for an autobiographical streak that she has continued and deepened ever since.\n\n\"She's an open book and always has been,\" said Bryan-Michael Cox, who produced and collaborated on writing her 2006 hit \"Be Without You\" and produced two songs for her new CD, Growing Pains (Geffen). \"You know exactly what she's been through in her life with her music.\"\n\nGrowing Pains, which sold more than 600,000 copies its first week, represents an upturn in her life. The Breakthrough, released at the end of 2005, became a rare blockbuster in a music business desperate for them. It brought her eight Grammy nominations and three awards.\n\n\"It was years of painfulness to get to this point,\" Blige, 36, says. \"But once you've been going through so much self-hatred and stuff for so long, you get to that point and you say, 'Gosh, am I good enough ?'\n\n\"And then something says - and this is the growth - yes, you are. And that's why I named the album Growing Pains because it was that moment that I realized, you know what, it's going to take a lot more growing and a lot more pain to sustain this breakthrough.\"\n\nShe has been married since 2003 to Kendu Isaacs, a producer who is also her most-dedicated advocate. \"Just Fine\" is the rare Mary J. Blige song to proclaim confidence rather than tension or distress. The new album starts with its victory laps: a self-esteem booster called \"Work That,\" a proud proclamation that she's a \"Grown Woman\" and \"Just Fine.\" But then it moves into Blige's emotional and musical stronghold: the turbulence of trying to hold together a relationship that matters.\n\nBlige, a hitmaker early on, regularly sells millions of albums. But she sings less often about success than about pain: heartless men, a tough childhood, an unshakable self-doubt. \"When I look back at that Mary,\" she says, \"I wish I could just take her, and I wish I could raise her. Me, this Mary. Because she just wanted to sing, and she didn't know anything about the music business. And she always cared about people more than she cared about herself. And she would give so much away to people. And no one would giveher anything back. And it would hurt her really badly.\"\n\nThat comes through on the albums, she says. \"I was crying out for help. On the My Life album I was saying: 'Somebody help me. I'm about to end it all.' Not with slitting my wrists or taking pills, but whatever drug, whatever alcohol, whatever I could do. I'm about to slowly start the process of ending it all.\"\n\nListeners identified with her.\n\n\"Four million fans or something worldwide came out and it was like, 'Mary, we hear you and we're going through it too,'\" she says. Blige fell into addiction, and was just pulling herself out about the time she released her 2001 album No More Drama. \"I was going through so much. I was dying. I had come off of being an alcoholic and a drug addict and everything else. And I just - it was either put up or shut up. It was two choices. It was: You want to live or you want to die?\" She lived, and she has since told her story on talk shows and inwomen's magazines, becoming a symbol of recovery well beyond the music world.\n\nBlige credits Isaacs with pulling her through. \"Although I was trying to kill myself, I didn't want to die. And so I prayed and I was like, 'Lord, you've got to help me, you've got to send me someone that's going to help me or send me a friend or something.' And here he comes. And he just started questioning me and challenging me and not being afraid to go against me in a positive way up against that negative stuff.\n\n\"And a challenge like that - you're either going to keep this good man that God brought in your life or send him away because you don't want anybody challenging you in your areas of negativity. So I said, I'm going to keep him and I'm going to get better.\"\n\nGrowing Pains doesn't make that a happily-ever-after story.Tension builds through lovers' quarrels in \"Stay Down\" and in \"Roses,\" which was written with the team behind Rihanna's hit \"Umbrella,\" Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart and The Dream. In \"Roses,\" Blige works herself up to a contradictory fury, wanting to be left alone and needing her man. \"You don't want nobody messing with you, you just want to rip somebody's head off,\" she declaims. Most of \"Roses,\" Blige says, was a freestyle - improvised in a vocal booth.\n\nA song that echoes Stevie Wonder, \"What Love Is,\" was written by Blige and the Star-Gate production team with lyrics from Ne-Yo, and despite its title, it's not sugary. Its minor-key piano chords carry contrasts like, \"Reason to laugh and smile/reason to cry yourself to sleep at night/ start a fight/make up break up wrong or right/Heaven for all it's worth can equally be hell on earth.\"\n\n\"Talk to Me\" begs a man to open up to her; she says she left the vocals on it unaltered, as raw as she sang them. \"I love mistakes. But they've got to be good mistakes.\"\n\nFor Blige, Growing Pains is her latest step toward positive thinking. Some listeners, she said, have preferred hearing her struggle through her triumphs. When she released No More Drama, \"a lot of the fans were like: 'Mmm, no. I liked Mary better when she wassinging them sad, sad songs,'\" she says. \"Well, I can't really do that right now because I'm trying to get my head together. And a lot of my fans went and a lot of them disappeared. But where they disappeared, a whole 2 million, 3 million more showed up. Because there's more people that want to be free than people that want to be trapped.\"\n\nWith Growing Pains she's determined to sing about where she stands here and now, even if sad songs have been more bankable. \"I can't settle and be miserable because you want me to sell a miserable album. If you want to deal with some other artist, then go deal with some other artist. I'm not worried about finances or you buying my album. I'm worrying about my sanity.\""
