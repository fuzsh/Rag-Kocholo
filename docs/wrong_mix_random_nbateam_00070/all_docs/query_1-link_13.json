It first launched in 2022. In a release announcing its 2024 rollout, Blige said, “I’m so excited to bring our Strength of a Woman Festival and Summit to my hometown, New York City, a place that has always been a huge source of inspiration for me. Having the opportunity to continue to uplift, inspire and build within my community is the reason I created this festival. I’m so grateful for all the support from our performers, attendees and, of course, our partners Live Nation Urban and Pepsi. Nobody does it like New York, so get ready.”\n\nFestival partner Pepsi will bring back its Pepsi Dig In platform, featuring an array of food from local Black female restaurateurs. In celebration of Women’s History Month, presale tickets will go live Wednesday and Thursday (March 6-7) with the code STRENGTH. General ticket sales will begin Friday, March 8, at 10am ET.
