        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS\n\nThere will be no “Power” outage at Starz.\n\nThe premium cable network announced on Friday that it is going forward with a sequel to its most popular drama, and it will be headlined by a big-time celebrity. Get ready for “Power Book II: Ghost” with Mary J. Blige.\n\nThe announcement was made by “Power” executive producers Courtney A. Kemp and Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson during a panel session at the Television Critics Association press tour. They said the spin-off is in pre-production and will be the first in “a collection of series” inspired by gritty crime drama.\n\nAlso announced during the TCA session: The sixth and final season of “Power” will air in two parts. The 10-episode Part I will debut as previously announced on Sunday, Aug. 25. Part II, which will consist of the final five episodes, will debut in January.\n\nBlige took the stage at at the end of the panel to express her gratitude.\n\n“This is probably the most exciting thing that’s going to happen to me this year,” she said. “I’ve been a fan of ‘Power’ since the very beginning. … It’s so relative to how I grew up. I knew so many Tashas and so many Ghosts. … I’m so grateful to be a part of this.”\n\nJackson and Kemp said that Blige immediately came to mind while they were thinking about how to structure the spin-off.\n\n“I said I got to find a replacement for me … and somebody who’s got enough juice and grace to make the show even bigger,” Jackson said.\n\nNo details about the spinoff’s plot or Blige’s character were revealed.\n\nStarz also said that it will air an after-show during Season 6 called “Power Confidential.”"
