To a certain extent, attempting to encapsulate the state of popular music \"since 1990,\" the period on which Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians focuses, is to aim at a moving target. Given the fleeting nature of stardom — and the evanes- cence of pop culture as a whole — some \"hot new per- formers\" of 2003 likely will be forgotten within five years, others as soon as six months. Ongoing developments in technology and the music industry have accelerated this process, so that artists sometimes release one album and, unable to hold their own amid so many competing outlets for entertainment — DVDs, video games, the Internet — are not heard from again. Trends rise and dis- appear with equal unpredictability. For example, the popularity of \"divas,\" a term previ- ously reserved for only the most venerable female per- formers but bestowed in the late 1990s upon newcomers such as Shania Twain and Brandy, had largely played out by the early 2000s, as one-time divas Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston released albums that proved critically and commercially disappointing. Selection and Inclusion of Artists The question of which performers to include required a substantial degree of judgment. Targeting the top tier, or \"most popular,\" performers — Eminem, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Nirvana, and others — was simple; choosing the next level and the one below it proved more difficult. The selection process was always challenging and often thorny. The value of an entry on rock and R&B star Tina Turner, for instance, is clear: Not only did Turner set a standard for energy and tenacity that continues to be an inspiration for younger performers, she also retained her hit-making prowess into the 1990s. At the same time, other talented performers of Turner's generation — Patti LaBelle, Gladys Knight — are omitted because their com- mercial success in the 1990s did not reach the same heights. They still perform concerts and sell recordings among a core group of fans, but their appeal is largely con- fined to those with esoteric tastes. Like Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones, two \"veteran\" acts also included, Turner has proven consistently relevant from a commer- cial perspective. When considering entries for younger performers — newcomers who have invigorated pop by pre- senting old styles in a different way — Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1 990 has targeted those artists who are likely to have staying power in the years to come, with the understanding that the vagaries of the music business render long-term predictions impossible. The bulk of the book is devoted to rock, pop, coun- try, R&B, and hip-hop. For entries in these categories, the book's goal is to spotlight artists who are popular in the current period, those who have established their success with hit recordings, CD sales, and radio airplay. When con- sidering entries for other genres — classical, world, Latin, Broadway, blues, folk, New Age, and jazz — and deter- mining the right balance of entries for each category, the criteria for inclusion were slightly different, but commer- cial success remained as one factor. In the field of jazz, for instance, the critical attention given to performers often outdistances their \"success\" from a commercial standpoint. Although the 1990s saw young jazz musicians such as xi Introduction Diana Krall moving into the pop mainstream, the bulk of jazz artists continued to work far outside the confines of hit radio and music television. The jazz entries, therefore, represent a survey not only of \"crossover\" artists such as Krall but also of established performers — Keith Jarrett, Wynton Marsalis — who seldom achieve hits on the Top 40 pop charts. At the same time, classically inclined read- ers may be surprised that an orchestra such as the Lon- don Symphony is included while the Berlin Philharmonic, considered one of the most accomplished in the world, is not. In a larger collection both would have warranted inclusion. In this collection, the London Symphony was selected because it epitomizes what contributor Douglas McLennan calls the \"entrepreneurial spirit that has made it one of the most recorded orchestras in the world.\" The goal in presenting entries for non-pop or rock genres is to provide readers with a sample survey of the field. Although not every worthy artist or group is included, the present collection will give readers a solid base from which to explore these styles further. Changes in Pop Since 1990 The concept of \"crossover,\" the transition of an artist from a \"niche\" or \"cult\" status into the mainstream of popular recognition, is a recurring theme within the entries, one that has notably characterized the state of pop music since the 1990s. Latin artists Marc Anthony and Ricky Martin, blues guitarist Kenny Wayne Shep- herd, and classical performer Andrea Bocelli are just a few of the performers whose careers have benefited from this movement. Crossover, of course, has been a goal of pop performers for decades — the success of the 1960s record company Motown, for example, was built upon crossover from R&B into the pop market — but the 1990s witnessed the enactment of crossover to an unprece- dented degree. It became not merely a goal, but a neces- sity for economic survival. Commercial radio formats in the 1990s grew more conservative, with little attention devoted to new or untested artists; at the same time, the music industry continued to issue new product at a steady pace. As Michael Selverne discusses in his essay within the appendix, approximately 6,500 albums are released each year in the United States. Of these, only two per- cent are judged successful by attaining \"gold\" or \"plat- inum\" status. Further, the standard channel for music distribution, the CD, has been threatened by the increased number of ways fans can hear music by their favorite artists: MP3 file sharing, audio streaming, and websites. As a result, by 2003 the entire industry was in the midst of one of its worst slumps in history, battling music downloads on the one hand while pushing CDs with the all-time high price of $19.99 on the other. In this shaky climate, artistic risk-taking, even among those known for their iconoclasm, has become rare. Former music \"rebels\" such as Randy Newman, while con- tinuing to issue solid material, firmly joined the 1990s Hol- lywood establishment, composing family-friendly scores for hit movies. In country music, \"traditional\" artists such as Mark Chesnutt have smoothed out the rough edges in their sound, bringing it into line with the accessible standards of hit radio, in which \"playlists\" — song sets given regular rotation at stations — are determined by market research strategies such as focus groups and surveys. Similarly, hip- hop artists such as R. Kelly and Mary J. Blige added pop elements — soaring choruses, inspirational lyrics — to their recordings as the 1990s progressed, although, despite the odds, they often succeeded in preserving the integrity of their original artistic vision. Kelly's \"I Believe I Can Fly\" (1996), one of the biggest hits of the decade, gained its power from traditional gospel vocalizing combined with a slick pop production, while Blige crafted one of the most appealing albums of her career, Mary (1999), by setting her grainy voice against a bed of lush strings and elegant orchestrations. As Kelly and Blige prove, crossover is not necessar- ily a negative force. It has, for instance, allowed rap music to retain its commercial potency throughout the 1990s and into the new millennium, as rappers such as Will Smith, Ja Rule, and Eminem have earned lasting favor among a pop audience. If the tenacity of a style is any indication of its value, rap has emerged as one of the most impor- tant musical developments of the late twentieth century. As rap has evolved over the course of a 25-year recorded history, it has displayed remarkable staying power and resilience, adapting to new trends by filtering into pop, rock, hip-hop, and R&B. By the early 2000s, rap had enjoyed a longer hit-making life than those of antecedent styles in African- American music such as soul, funk, or disco. Coming to terms with the ongoing development and vitality of rap, a style initially disregarded by the critical establishment as \"nonmusical\" or \"talky,\" is one of the most exciting elements of this volume, proof that innovation is not necessarily stifled by the presence of commercial success. A development separate from, but related to, crossover has been the rise of pluralism within pop music since the 1990s. As pop continues to evolve, a greater number of artists have incorporated elements from out- side genres into their work. By the end of the 1990s this musical breadth had become a mark of erudition on the part of the artist, pointing to an awareness of the disparate styles that blend into pop's musical brew. In previous decades, it was common for performers to remain within a single, definable stylistic pattern. The albums of 1970s singer Carole King, for example, vary little in terms of sound from one to the next. When folk-rock artist Joni Mitchell experimented with jazz on her mid-1970s albums, the effort was viewed as a bold stylistic move. Such ini- xii Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 Introduction tiatives were the norm by the 1990s, when digital tech- nology and musical \"sampling\" made it easy for an artist to insert a riff from the past or a snippet of an African polyrhythm into a modern song. Contemporary artists such as Wyclef Jean, Annie Lennox, and David Byrne have made eclecticism their trademark, delving into new musical terrain with each successive release. While it can be argued that many of these explorations are more con- cerned with style than with substance, it is undeniable that contemporary musicians are more aware than ever of the array of options, or \"sound bites,\" available for use in their music. In addition to crossover and pluralism, the entries reflect other changes that occurred within the pop world of the 1990s. In support of the maxim that trends never disappear but are instead recycled and updated, \"boy bands\" — a staple of pop music in the early 1970s with groups like the Jackson 5 and the Osmonds — returned in the 1990s. Acts such as Hanson, the Backstreet Boys, and *NSYNC attained idol status among one of the pop indus- try's primary target markets: teenage girls. At the same time, another branch of pop music appealed to a more mature, music-savvy audience, with older artists such as Santana, Aerosmith, Tony Bennett, and Frank Sinatra gaining a renewed fame that rivaled their success in the past, particularly in terms of record sales (Sinatra's 1993 Duets album became the biggest seller of his career). In a sense, the pop audience's attentions have always been bal- anced between a craving for the \"new\" and a nostalgic yearning for the past; the most successful pop music looks both forward and backward. Music fans of the 1990s took pride in their eclecticism, and it was not uncommon for purchasers of the latest album by Sheryl Crow or Alanis Morissette also to buy a \"traditional\" CD such as the 1997 crossover hit Buena Vista Social Club, which showcased a number of Cuba's finest, yet most neglected, musicians. With the expanding selection of choices in pop music, audiences by the early 2000s began to fall into segmented categories associated with their interests: Southern Rock, Speed Metal, Gangsta Rap. These fans found kindred musical spirits through Internet websites and chat rooms tailored to their needs. Traditional marketing initiatives began to seem out of date as more music fans learned about new artists through word-of-mouth and online recom- mendations. In a mark of the dichotomy that has always characterized popular culture, however, segmented audi- ences also possessed a greater capacity to branch out into other musical areas. The range of musical subgenres is now wider than ever, but, due to technology and the cross- pollination of pop music styles, the gaps separating one listener from another have grown smaller. Acknowledg- ing this development by featuring entries on a diverse range of styles, the contributors have sought to capture the com- plex, variegated nature of current popular music. Format and Style Within the entries, contributors have represented bands and artists on their own tenns; a rock perfomer such as Bruce Springsteen is not depicted as \"greater\" or \"lesser\" in value than Broadway theater composer Stephen Sond- heim. Both have been active since 1990, and in this way have contributed immeasurably to the current musical landscape. At the same time, the contributors have exerted critical assessment within each style. Unlike many musi- cal reference works that describe the subject's work with technical, dispassionate language, the new Baker's offers judgment without entirely discarding the ideals of objec- tivity and distance with which such volumes are informed. In this way Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1 990 departs from the Ninth \"Centennial\" Edition of Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians (2001 ), edited by Nicolas Slonimsky and Laura Kuhn. The emphasis in that six-volume work is classical, and its guid- ing principles are biographical and bibliographical. Fur- thermore, it does not attempt to assess the recording achievements of its subjects. Slonimsky's entry on Lud- wig van Beethoven, for example, contains more than ten columns devoted to the composer's complete output, including orchestral works, chamber works, works for piano, for voice, and for solo instruments and orchestra. Yet Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians does not mention any famous Beethoven recordings by the con- ductors Wilhelm Fiirtwangler, Leonard Bernstein, or Car- los Kleiber; the pianists Wilhelm Kempff or Alfred Brendel; or sopranos such as Christa Ludwig and Barbara Bonney. Such a listing would have proved overwhelming, and invariably the question of which recordings are still in print would need to be answered. In contrast, and as the book's cover image implies, Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1 990 focuses largely upon the recordings. This is fitting, since the recorded album or single track, unlike a musi- cal score, can be considered a finished work of art. The book assumes that readers will get to know the subject not through formal study of piano, guitar, or voice, but through repeated exposure to recordings. Although the interests of fans and inveterate music lovers have been considered, the book is tailored for general readers, those without for- mal training in music. Each entry, therefore, strives to pro- vide a general overview while delving deeply enough to seize upon the inherent worth of its subject. On the whole, contributors have not been concerned with assessing an artist's career on a strict album-by-album basis. Rather, they have employed a selective approach that limns an artist's special contribution — the elements making that artist wor- thy of inclusion. It is hoped that the book's balance — critical yet inclusive — will be useful for placing each performer's work Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 xiii Introduction in its proper context. Entries on pioneering artists such as James Brown and George Jones are presented as \"appreci- ations\" as much as biographies. Neither performer can be accurately described as a \"hot\" artist in a contemporary sense. Both have remained active performers since 1990, but their commercial success peaked decades earlier. With- out an understanding of the ways in which they have influ- enced the course of contemporary music, however, the work of their descendants in rhythm and blues and country can- not adequately be assessed. Likewise, the Beatles, a group that has not existed officially since 1970, are given a sub- stantial entry due to the enormous influence they have exerted upon every rock band that has followed them. The volume's mission, therefore, is to appeal to two different audiences. One can be described as an older reader famil- iar with the Beatles and James Brown, but for whom devel- opments since 1990 in rock and R&B — grunge, rap, hip-hop — have gone largely unnoticed. The second is a reader born after 1980, aware of young artists such as Mary J. Blige and Britney Spears but oblivious to pop music's longstanding relation to Broadway, jazz, and Tin Pan Alley. Through categorical inclusiveness, Baker's seeks to bridge the gap between these audiences. Through its format, structure, and content, Baker's hopes to complement, rather than compete with, the Inter- net. While the editors and contributors understand that a great deal of biographical information is available on the Web, they also believe in the value of two concise vol- umes that can be browsed and consulted through multi- ple encounters. Further, given the transitory nature of material on the Web, Baker's will provide readers with a long-lasting, dependable alternative. Acknowledging the importance of Internet research, contributors have included Web links for performers and bands wherever pos- sible. They have also strived for accuracy with regard to the biographical information at the beginning of each entry: birthplace, birth date, best-selling album since 1990, and hits since 1990; although it has not always been pos- sible to unearth more arcane data such as the birth dates of musicians who long ago left a group. The albums listed at the end of each entry reflect the contributor's assess- ment of which works are significant — the recordings that best represent an artist's contributions as a whole — rather than a complete discography. Selected sidebars, called \"spotlights,\" target the record- ings, events, and movements that have defined popular music since 1990. There are spotlights on special events and cultural moments (such as Farm Aid or Gilberto Gil being named Brazil's minister of culture); hit songs (Hanson's \"MMMBop\"); and pivotal albums (Nirvana's Nevermind). The genre index at the end of Volume 2 supplements the general index and is designed for browsing. Only the largest genre categories are included in this index. Examples include rock and pop, classical, country, jazz, Latin, rhythm and blues, and world. No attempt has been made to separate rock from pop or to divide rock into its fragmented com- ponents. Artists and bands in the genre index appear only once, each within a single category, even though the genre description that appears beneath a subject title in the book may list multiple categories. For example, the subject \"Elvis Costello\" appears in the genre index under rock; the genre line under Costello's article lists rock, pop, and country. Four interpretive essays in the appendix have been commissioned to help expand the use and depth of the book, providing historical context for many of the sub- jects. The essays address themes of particular importance to popular music in the United States since 1990: the rise and fall of grunge (the dominant popular rock genre at the start of the 1990s); rap music's emergence within the commercial mainstream; the impact of corporate radio since the mid-1990s and its effects upon musical content; and the role of the Internet and the crisis of the music industry in the early 2000s. Attempting to Define \"Popular\" In conclusion, the term \"popular music\" can be chal- lenging to define, as it begs the question, \"What is popu- lar?\" In his book The Rise and Fall of Popular Music (1994), music historian Donald Clarke equates \"popular\" with \"commercial.\" In contrast to classical music, the creation and performance of which is often aided by governmen- tal or private subsidies, \"popular music\" is associated with business and enterprise. In general, a symphonic, operatic, or chamber composer creates music irrespective of com- mercial considerations. A popular music writer, on the other hand, must score some kind of \"hit\" — whether on the Top 40 charts, in a Hollywood film, or on the Broadway stage — in order to enjoy a full-time career in music. This is not to say that creators of pop music are not simultaneously interested in making \"art\"; rather, that popular art is often created with commercial considerations in mind. At the same time, the lines between \"popular\" and \"classical\" are not always clear-cut. The years since 1990 have witnessed classical performers moving into the cultural mainstream to an unprecedented degree. Opera singers such as Renee Fleming are marketed like pop stars, via advertising cam- paigns that emphasize their good looks and sex appeal. This development notwithstanding, \"classical\" and \"popular\" are still widely perceived as separate areas of appreciation. The difference between the two can be detected through a trip to a local CD store. While the pop, rock, and R&B aisles will be thronged with crowds, the classical section is often empty, an oasis of quiet amidst the hubbub and cacoph- ony that surrounds it. Moving past categorical divisions, the concept of pop- ular music can perhaps best be described through its entry in the Collins English Dictionary: \"music having wide xiv Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 Introduction appeal.\" It is this definition that most accurately expresses the philosophy of this book and its editor, Stephen Wasser- stein. Over the course of almost 600 entries, the two vol- umes comprising this new addition to Baker's seek to address the question of which musicians have been pop- ular at some point since 1990, regardless of genre or style. For this reason, classical artists such as Fleming, as well as classical \"bands\" such as the Boston Pops and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, are included; their appeal is so widespread that they can be described as \"popular\" in their reach and influence. As the first book of its kind to spotlight all forms of music since 1990, it targets and surveys those artists who have made a significant impact on current popular culture. Although the book's empha- sis is contemporary, the decision to use 1990 as a starting point gives it the historical perspective common to a ref- erence work. Popular music has changed dramatically since 1990; in these volumes, the editorial team and contribu- tors aim to capture the varied, complex nature of today's pop within a readable, concise format. DAVID FREELAND NEW YORK Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 XV At* AALIYAH Born: Aaliyah Haughton; Brooklyn, New York, 16 January 1979; died Abaco, Bahamas, 25 August 2001 Genre: R&B Best-selling album since 1990: Aaliyah (2001) Hit songs since 1990: \"Try Again,\" \"More Than a Woman\" A teenage star who never reached her adult potential, Aaliyah Haughton blazed a bright trail through the world of contemporary rhythm and blues during the middle to late 1990s, until her untimely death at the age of twenty-two in a plane crash in the Bahamas. Haughton was born in New York and raised in Detroit. (Her name, pronounced Ah-LEE-yah, a transliteration from Swahili, means \"exalted one\"). She was inspired by her mother, Diane, a singer, and her uncle, a lawyer briefly married to Gladys Knight, the R&B legend best known for the 1970s ballad \"Midnight Train to Georgia.\" Haughton got her first break performing with Knight at the age of eleven and released her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing but a Number, in 1994, at the age of fifteen. The preternaturally mature singer scored several Top 10 hits from the album with the sing-songy, hip-hop-flavored \"Back & Forth\" and the Isley Brothers's \"At Your Best (You Are Love).\" But her marriage to her producer, the Chicago singer R. Kelly, threatened to overshadow her debut. Kelly wrote most of the songs on the album, which mixed street-savvy R&B with rapping and a few unexceptional ballads. The songs, such as \"Throw Your Hands Up,\" feature lyrics that match Aaliyah's early image, which blended street-tough baggy pants and bandannas with a sly, girl-next-door smile (\"Straight from the streets / Is where I'm coming from / Straight out the streets / With a touch of jazz in me\"). Because Haughton was underage at the time of the marriage, the union generated controversy and was quickly annulled; it did nothing, however, to slow the singer's meteoric rise. Her second album featured even stronger compositions and touches that prefigured her later sig- nature style, thanks to a close collaboration with the pro- ducer, Timbaland, and the rising star rapper/producer, Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott. Their combination of skit- tering, minimalist space-age beats and Haughton's rich yet ethereal vocals set the stage for their most distinguished future collaborations. The 1996 album One in a Million produced another pair of hits, including the languid title track and the seductive \"If Your Girl Only Knew.\" \"One in a Million\" finds Haughton evolving from the inexpe- rienced, shy teen of her debut into a more mature, enig- matic seductress. Haughton continued to grow artistically with every single she released, most notably in her 1998 single, \"Are You That Somebody,\" from the Dr. Dolittle soundtrack. Again buoyed by Timbaland's crisp, futuristic beats, the song is built around an infectious sample of a baby's cry. \"Journey to the Past,\" a track from the animated Disney film Anastasia, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song that same year, and Haughton performed it on the Academy Awards. Unlike so many of her contemporaries, Haughton kept her private life off-limits, furthering her slightly mysteri- ous image. Known for her close familial relationships, a 1 AC/DC tireless work ethic, and a pleasant disposition, the singer gained fans among profanity-spewing rap artists and sub- urban teens alike with an image that was both streetwise and classy. With a preference for black leather, dark sun- glasses, and a tuft of hair covering her left eye, the singer exuded an air of effortless cool that extended to her fluid, languid dance moves. It was that enigmatic style that earned Haughton her first movie role, co-starring with the Asian martial arts star Jet Li in Romeo Must Die (2000). The single \"Try Again,\" from the film's soundtrack, further cemented the creative and commercial symbiosis between Haughton and Timbaland; this stutter-stepping, up-tempo R&B affinnation helped push the album, which Haughton executive-produced, to more than 2 million in sales. With positive reviews for her work in Romeo Must Die Haughton signed on to appear in a co-starring role in the two sequels to the science fiction film The Matrix and a lead part in the vampire drama Queen of the Damned. Superstardom Cut Short by a Tragic Accident While filming her gothic role in the Anne Rice-inspired Queen of the Damned, Haughton recorded her self-titled third album, which further expanded her sound, adding touches of blues, jazz, and salsa to a group of songs exploring themes of abusive relationships, sex, and betrayal. Tracks such as the propulsively funky \"More Than a Woman\" and the Caribbean-flavored \"Rock the Boat\" are infused with Haughton's increased confidence and control. Just one month after the album's release, Haughton was returning from the Bahamas after filming a video for Rock the Boat when her promising career was cut short. The charter airplane she and eight of her entourage were on crashed after takeoff. Haughton's elaborate funeral in downtown New York City, which featured a horse-drawn carriage pulling her casket, was fit for royalty. A ceremony for friends and family following the funeral featured a photo of Haughton with the inscription \"We were given a Queen, We were given an Angel.\" The singer was buried in Westchester County, New York. An album of outtakes, remixes, and previously unre- leased songs with contributions from many of the singer's contemporaries and fans, I Care 4 V, was released in late 2002.

GIL KAUFMAN AC/DC Formed: 1973, Sydney, Australia Members: Brian Johnson, vocals (born Newcastle, Eng- land, 5 October 1947); Phil Rudd, drums (born Melbourne, Australia, 19 May 1954); Cliff Williams, bass (born Essex, England, 14 December 1949); Angus Young, guitar (born Glasgow, Scotland, 31 March 1959); Malcolm Young, guitar (born Glasgow, Scotland, 6 January 1953). Former mem- bers: Mark Evans, bass (born Melbourne, Australia, 2 March 1956); Ronald Belford \"Bon\" Scott, vocals (born Kir- riemuir, Scotland, 9 July 1946; d. London, England, 20 Feb- ruary 1980); Chris Slade, drums (born Pontypridd, Wales, 30 October 1946); Simon Wright, drums (born Alden, Eng- land, 19 June 1963). Genre: Rock Best-selling album since 1990: The Razor's Edge (1990) Hit songs since 1990: \"Moneytalks\" AC/DC blended power chords, hard-rock beats, and searing vocals with a theatrical stage presence that featured the ceaseless cavort- ing of lead guitarist Angus Young in his trademark school uniform. Blatant sexual innuendo was proudly displayed in their songs, from \"Big Balls\" to \"You Shook Me All Night Long.\" After the release of Highway to Hell (1979) and the sudden death of singer Bon Scott, AC/DC returned tri- umphantly with Back in Black (1980) and For Those About to Rock We Salute You (1981). Through subsequent decades AC/DC continued to release albums using a pat formula. AC/DC was formed by the brothers Malcolm and Angus Young in 1973. Playing at local pubs with Dave Evans (vocals), Larry van Knedt (bass), and Colin Burgess (drums), the group gained notice for their bombastic sound and energetic stage presence. At the suggestion of his sis- ter, Angus began to wear his school uniform onstage, a gim- mick that rapidly became his trademark. Evans and the Young brothers relocated to Melbourne, where bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd joined the group. After Dave Evans refused to sing at a performance in September 1974, the group's chauffeur, Bon Scott, stepped in for the night and soon replaced Evans as the group's lead singer. After recording two albums released only in Australia, the group was signed to Atlantic Records, which offered selections from these albums under the title High Voltage ( 1976). Mark Evans quit the group after lengthy tours, and Cliff Williams was recruited as the new bassist. Upon mov- ing to London, AC/DC gained a cult following and was soon touring with such groups as KISS, Aerosmith, Styx, and Cheap Trick. The group's April 1978 performance at the Apollo in Glasgow, Scotland, was recorded and later released as If You Want Blood, You've Got It (1978). 2 Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 Ace of Base During this time AC/DC released Let There Be Rock (1977), which include the perennial favorite \"Whole Lotta Rosie,\" and Powerage (1978). Gaining international attention, the group recorded Highway to Hell (1979) with the producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. The title track begins with a blistering guitar riff that characterizes all of the verses. This riff is balanced by a chorus with the mem- orable line, \"I'm on a highway to hell.\" Bon Scott pres- ents the melody in a characteristically forceful tone that verges on screaming. Soon after the album's release, AC/DC incurred a tragic setback with the sudden death of Bon Scott, who choked on his own vomit after a night of heavy drinking. Many critics and fans assumed that the band would fold, but Brian Johnson was quickly recruited as the new lead singer. After two months in the studio, AC/DC released Back in Black ( 1980), whose title and black cover paid trib- ute to Scott. The title track opens with a straightforward guitar riff that concludes with a syncopated rhythm. John- son belts out the melodic line, which is limited in pitch movement but effective in its extremely high register. In \"You Shook Me All Night Long,\" Johnson employs a string of sexual innuendoes beginning with the first line, \"She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean.\" With Back in Black and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (originally recorded with Bon Scott in 1976 and released in 1981 ), AC/DC occupied the charts simultaneously with two albums featuring two different singers. Following the release of For Those About to Rock We Salute You (1981) and Flick of the Switch (1983), Rudd left the group and was replaced by Simon Wright. In the mid-1980s, the group was implicated in a bizarre controversy that centered on Richard Ramirez, a serial killer who claimed that their song \"Night Prowler\" inspired him to commit numerous mur- ders. This negative publicity eventually dissipated, and AC/DC continued to record albums and tour. After the release of Blow Up Your Video (1988), Simon Wright left the group to join Dio and was replaced by Chris Slade. After a series of mildly successful albums in the late 1980s, AC/DC released The Razor's Edge (1990), which eventually charted at number two on the Billboard chart. \"Money Talks\" begins with a guitar riff that echoes the melodic line. Although the song is humorous at times, with the tongue-in-cheek chorus, \"C'mon, c'mon, love me for the money,\" it lacks energy and momentum. While explor- ing some new musical territory with extended introduc- tions and prominent backup vocals, the album is uneven and uninspired. \"Mistress for Christmas,\" with its line, \"Want to be in heaven with three in a bed,\" sounds like a failed joke, and \"Let's Make It\" recalls a weaker version of \"Back in Black.\" AC/DC then released Live (1992) and Bonfire (1995), a box set memorial to Bon Scott. Phil Rudd rejoined the group, and with their next album, Ballbreaker (1995), AC/DC regained some of its energy. \"Cover You in Oil\" begins with a strong introduction and a medium-tempo rock groove. The lyrics in the chorus are effective, although the rhyme scheme in the verse is awkward and forced: \"Pull on the zip, she give good lip (service).\" The song \"The Honey Roll\" begins with a strong guitar riff that leads into a straightforward verse. The guitar solo is followed by a short bridge and extended choruses. With Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip (2000), AC/DC uses a different style of guitar riff with a single -note drone set against a melodic line. In \"Stiff Upper Lip,\" the intro- ductory guitar sounds lithe and blues-tinged rather than raucous. Brian Johnson begins the verse in a low register, singing \"I was born with a stiff, stiff upper lip\" with an effec- tive pause halfway through the line. \"All Screwed Up\" explodes with an oscillating guitar riff and includes a sur- prisingly melodic interlude before the chorus. Throughout their career AC/DC were intensely loyal to their musical formula: riff-driven rock replete with power chords, blistering vocals, and constant allusions to sexual acts. They eschewed popular manifestations of hard rock, from the imagery of glam-metal and hair-bands to the power ballads of arena rock. For these same reasons their recent material sounds derivative, recycled, and at times lethargic. While AC/DC gained little ground in the U.S. singles charts, their albums enjoyed tremendous sales inter- nationally. In 2003 they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a fitting tribute to their uncompro- mising spirit and tireless musical activity.

WYNN YAMAMI ACE OF BASE Formed: 1990, Gothenburg, Sweden Members: Jenny Berggren, lead vocals (born Gothenburg, Sweden, 19 May 1972); Jonas Berggren, producer (born Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 3 Bryan Adams Gothenburg, Sweden, 21 March 1967); Malin \"Linn\" Berggren, lead vocals (born Gothenburg, Sweden, 31 October 1970); Ulf \"Buddha\" Ekberg, producer (born Gothenburg, Sweden, 6 December 1970). Genre: Rock Best-selling album since 1990: The Sign (1993) Hit songs since 1990: \"All That She Wants,\" \"Don't Turn Around,\" \"The Sign\" With a bright, danceable sound reminiscent of 1970s disco, Ace of Base enjoyed a string of hits in the early 1990s and proved that the Seattle grunge movement could not keep pop music down for long. The sisters Jenny and Linn Berggren began their singing careers in a church choir in their native Gothen- burg, Sweden. Their older brother Jonas was also involved in music, playing synthesizers and writing songs with his friend Ulf Ekberg. The four joined forces in 1990 and formed Ace of Base. The fledgling band began playing local dance clubs and, within a year, the Scandinavian label Mega Records signed Ace of Base to a recording contract. After Ace of Base achieved early chart success in Scandinavia, Metronome Records, based in Germany, signed Ace of Base to a distribution deal and released the band's first European single, \"All That She Wants.\" The song's jaunty rhythm, peppy keyboards, and infectious sing- along chorus (\"All that she wants is another baby\") made the song a hit on radio and in dance clubs throughout Europe. The tune reached number one on the pop charts in ten countries. Arista Records signed Ace of Base to a U.S. distri- bution deal and released \"All That She Wants\" in the fall of 1993. The song's breezy European feel, coupled with the overwhelming popularity at the time of brooding, \"grunge\" songs from acts such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam, made \"All That She Wants\" an unlikely contender for mass appeal, but the track became a Top 10 hit. Ace of Base's follow- up single, \"The Sign,\" was even more successful, reach- ing number one on the U.S. pop charts. \"The Sign\" epitomizes Ace of Base's relentless optimism and enthu- siasm; over an upbeat, pulsing groove, the Berggren sis- ters trade vocals, exulting in a recent breakup: \"I got a new life, you would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad / How can a person like me care for you? / Why do I bother, when you're not the one for me? / Oo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo.\" \"The Sign\" also benefited from heavy rotation on MTV, which embraced the good-looking Swedes and their promotional videos. By the end of 1994, Ace of Base's U.S. debut album, The Sign, had sold more than 8 million copies and had charted three Top 10 singles. The band also received three Grammy nominations, including one for Best New Artist. Ace of Base released its sophomore album, The Bridge , in 1995. The single \"Beautiful Life\" features a more intense, club-centric beat, but it still resonated with mainstream audiences, reaching number fifteen on the Billboard charts. The album was a commercial disappointment, as was its follow-up, Cruel Summer (1998), despite the latter's chart- ing of another Top 10 hit, the band's cover of the Bana- narama title track. While Ace of Base's popularity in the United States sagged, the band remained wildly popular in Europe, scoring several number one hits with songs largely ignored by U.S. radio. Though the band's stay at the top of the U.S. charts was brief, Ace of Base created some of the more endur- ing pop hits of the 1990s.

SCOTT TRIBBLE BRYAN ADAMS Born: Kingston, Ontario, 5 November 1959 Genre: Rock Best-selling album since 1990: Waking Up the Neigh- bours (1991) Hit songs since 1990: \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,\" \"Please Forgive Me,\" \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" After entering the pop music scene in the early 1980s, Canadian singer/songwriter Bryan Adams quickly gained notoriety with a catchy, easily definable mainstream rock sound. However, that definition has gotten murky through the years, as his soft love ballads, some of which are movie soundtrack hits, have commercially triumphed. Early Years As far back as he can remember, Adams was inter- ested in music, but this passion flew in the face of his dom- inating father's wishes. The father was a military man, later a diplomat to the United Nations, and the family lived all over the world. When Bryan's parents divorced, his mother, a schoolteacher, took him and his younger brother to settle in Vancouver, British Columbia. Adams quit high school at age sixteen and began performing and writing songs for a local rock group called Shock and another named Sweeney Todd, with which he cut two albums. Adams sought out the songwriter/producer Jim Vallance in 1980, and they began co-writing songs, some of which 4 Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 Bryan Adams were recorded by the Canadian supergroups Bachman- Turner Overdrive and Loverboy as well as by Bonnie Tyler and KISS. The Making of a Superstar In 1981 Adams decided on a solo career and signed a now-famous contract with A&M Records in Toronto for the sum of one dollar. His first release went nowhere, but his second, You Want It, You Got It (1981), sold well in Canada and made way for Cuts Like a Knife ( 1983 ). This album went platinum in the United States and introduced Adams's husky-voiced, passionate rock with agreeable hits like \"This Time,\" \"Straight from the Heart,\" and the title track, \"Cuts Like a Knife.\" Adams followed with Reckless (1984), which soared to the top spot on the U.S. record charts. It features six major hit singles, including \"Run to You,\" \"Summer of '69,\" and a red-hot duet with singing legend Tina Turner, \"It's Only Love.\" The handsome Adams seemed to have found a perfect balance with his pliable foot-stomping rock. He became one of rock's bona fide superstars. In 1991, after Adams and his band toured the world playing sold-out stadiums at every stop, he recorded a dul- cet ballad by the veteran film composer Michael Kamen \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\" for the soundtrack to the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves starring Kevin Cost- ner. The song was a megahit and went number one imme- diately in the United States, Canada, and England, where Adams now lives. It sold over 8 million copies as a sin- gle. The song's success paved the way for Waking Up the Neighbours (1991), which contains \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\" in addition to the bouncy hit \"Can't Stop This Thing We Started.\" Waking Up the Neighbours sold almost 6 million copies in its first two months of issue. Adams continued to succeed with ballads and movie soundtracks, adding the gorgeous \"Please Forgive Me,\" another chart topper, to a greatest hits album, So Far So Good (1993). The album sold 13 million copies worldwide. Later that year he recorded the song \"All for Love\" with his fellow superstars Rod Stewart and Sting for the film The Three Musketeers. The film was a flop but the song went to number one, as did \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?,\" which he recorded for the film Don Juan DeMarco (1995), starring Johnny Depp. In the meantime, Adams continued to tour worldwide, developing a mas- sive following in Europe and Asia in addition to the United States. Rock music success and all of its trappings has claimed its fair share of casualties, but seems to have had few adverse effects on Adams. By all accounts down-to-earth, Adams has used his celebrity to promote and raise money for an impressive list of personally favored humanitarian causes, including Live Aid, Net Aid, Amnesty Interna- tional, Greenpeace, cancer research, environmental causes, Ethiopian famine, and freedom for Nelson Man- dela. He is a devout vegetarian, an avid equestrian, and has never been married. Adams has a strong passion for photography and has snapped shots in privileged photo sessions with such luminaries as the queen of England and Paul McCartney. His work has appeared in galleries, books, and magazines worldwide. Placated by live and compilation albums, fans had to wait five years for Adams to follow-up the colossal Wak- ing Up the Neighbours. In 1996 he released 18 'til I Die (1996). The album used the same formula as Neighbours by adding an already-released soundtrack hit. This time it was \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" Adams's fans were beginning to split down the middle. One side longed for the raw rock of his earlier days, the other for Adams's recent ballads; most of Adams's later work is sad- dled with the challenge of satisfying both camps. The fol- lowing year he answered with a collection of songs, including some of his heaviest rockers, in a live acoustic set on MTV as part of its Unplugged series. Accolades and Staying Power Adams has sold more than 50 million albums throughout a career that shows no sign of slowing down. He has been showered with awards, including sixteen wins out of twenty-four Juno nominations (the Canadian ver- sion of a Grammy), and three Grammy Awards out of thir- teen nominations. He has also won two MTV Music Awards and had three Academy Award nominations for soundtrack songs. In 2002 he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for the song \"Here I Am\" from the sound- track to Dream Works's animated epic, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. He also released an album of the film's music under the same title. The ballad-heavy recording features a duet with fellow Canadian Sarah McLachlan on \"Don't Let Go.\" The album as a whole displays Adams's song- writing growth and his innate ability to infuse his songs with satisfying hooks. \"Get Off My Back,\" from Spirit, was one return on the album to his rock sound. He toured most of 2002 with the bare-bones trio of Keith Scott on gui- tar, Mickey Curry on drums, and Adams on bass guitar, a departure from his usual role as rhythm guitarist. The pride of Canada, Bryan Adams has earned a top spot in contemporary music with relentless touring and an ability to appeal consistently to a mainstream audience.

DONALD LOWE JOHN ADAMS Born: Worcester, Massachusetts, 15 February 1947 Genre: Classical John Adams's evocative scores and provocative projects helped make him one of the most prominent American composers of the final decades of the twentieth century. In 1 99 1 a sur- vey of major American orchestras by the Amer- ican Symphony Orchestra League showed Adams to be the most frequently performed living American composer that year. Adams grew up in the northeastern United States and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Harvard Uni- versity, where he studied conducting, played the clarinet, and composed. His prominent teachers included Leon Kirchner, David Del Tredici, and Roger Sessions. In 1971 he moved to San Francisco, California, to teach and con- duct at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music ( 1972-1983 ) and to be composer-in-residence for the San Francisco Symphony (1978-1985). It was here that some of his most important works — including Shaker Loops (1978, 1983), Harmonium (1980-1981), Harmonielehre (1984-1985), and Grand Pianola Music (1982)— were commissioned and performed. Adams's music fit neatly with the minimalist style of composition that was shaking off the complexities of atonality in the 1970s and 1980s and gaining something of a popular following. Minimalism reduced the com- plexities of harmony and melody to their most basic form, repeating chord progressions and melodic fragments and simplifying the musical language. Adams's brand of undu- lating minimalism always seemed to have more going on, and his writing quickly evolved into a distinctive post- modernist blend of styles. Right from the first composi- tion, his music had an expressive bent that seemed to want to develop beyond the repetitions of the minimalist style. These expansive musical sensibilities were channeled into provocative projects, such as his widely debated first opera based on President Richard Nixon's historic trip to China, Nixon in China. The piece was startling when it premiered at the Houston Grand Opera in 1987. At a time when contemporary opera — particularly American con- temporary opera — was something of a rare undertaking, Adams and his A-list creative team of director Peter Sel- lars, librettist Alice Goodman, and choreographer Mark Morris tackled a contemporary subject and sparked a new genre of postmodernist music for the theater. A record- ing of the piece won a Grammy Award in 1989 for Best Contemporary Composition, and the original production was restaged at opera houses throughout Europe and Amer- ica in the 1990s. Though not as well known as a conductor, Adams has championed his own and other contemporary composers' work from the podium. From 1987-1990 he was \"creative chair\" of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, serving as part of the orchestra's experimental creative leadership team, conducting four weeks of concerts, and overseeing the orchestra's contemporary music programs. He has also con- ducted the Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony, Philadelphia Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Con- certgebouw, London Symphony, and BBC Orchestra, and has recorded his own music conducting the San Francisco Symphony. Adams's second opera — an even more controversial work than Nixon — was The Death ofKlinghoffer. The opera is built around the story of the 1984 hijacking of the Ital- ian cruise ship Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean Sea by Palestinian terrorists, and the subsequent murder of a wheelchair-bound American tourist Leon Klinghoffer. The opera debuted in March 1991 in Brussels, Belgium, as the Persian Gulf War was coming to a close, and the per- formances were picketed and condemned for the opera's sub- ject matter. Klinghoffer employed the same creative team (Goodman/Sellars/Morris) as Nixon, but many of the reviews, both in Europe and at the American premiere in San Francisco later that year, were scathing, mostly because of the subject. A subsequent production planned by the Los Angeles Music Center Opera (one of the co- commissioners) was canceled, and the opera was not per- forated again during the next ten years, despite the fact that the score offers some of Adams's most lyrical and luminous music. A third stage piece, a \"song\" play, a kind of staged story set to music titled I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky (1995), failed to generate the kind of intense interest of Adams's previous efforts. If the 1980s established Adams as a major voice in American music, the 1990s secured his position. As his compositional style evolved beyond the simplified musi- cal structures of minimalism and into a new take on the expressive qualities of Romanticism, Adams's eclectic style encompassed a wide range of twentieth-century idioms and 6 Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 Ryan Adams references, from Russian-born American composer Igor Stravinsky to swing music. He produced a series of cham- ber and orchestral works, including Violin Concerto (1994), which was commissioned by an unusual partner- ship between the Minnesota Orchestra, the London Sym- phony, and the New York City Ballet. City Ballet director Peter Martins choreographed a dance to the work and it was presented during the 1994-1995 season. The Concerto won the 1995 Grawemeyer Award for Contemporary Music. The Chamber Symphony (1993) is typical of Adams's wit: It sets up a musical duel between the rigorously intel- lectual style of serialism, in which each note is determined by strict formulas, and the inflated freneticism of cartoon soundtrack music. Adams also has a love of musical puz- zles and odd titles, chosen sometimes just because he likes the sounds of the words, as witnessed in titles such as Slonimsky's Earbox (1996), Gnarly Buttons (1996), and Naive and Sentimental Music (1997-1998). Yet it was because of his ability to express deep sen- timent that the New York Philharmonic chose Adams to write a work commemorating the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center. Adams's On the Trans' migration of Souls opened the New York Philharmonic's 2002 season. As the twenty-first century began, Adams emerged as one of the leading composers of the day, as close as any- one since the iconic quintessential American composer Aaron Copland to being considered a \"national\" Amer- ican composer. His ability to synthesize musical styles and create music of freshness opened up a new vein of Amer- ican music.

DOUGLAS MCLENNAN RYAN ADAMS Born: David Ryan Adams; Jacksonville, North Carolina, 5 November 1974 Genre: Rock Best-selling album since 1990: Gold (2001) Hit songs since 1990: \"New York, New York,\" \"When the Stars Go Blue,\" \"Answering Bell\" Ryan Adams, the solo singer/songwriter, com- bines the cocky cacophony of garage rock with the sweet and sad aspects of country music. Adams started out as the lead singer and songwriter of Whiskeytown, a band that rode the wave of alter- native-country in the mid- to late 1990s. Formed in 1994, the group officially broke up around 2000, shortly before the release of Adams's debut album Heartbreaker (2000). In just two years, the prolific Adams released three albums. For someone who dropped out of high school after tenth grade, Adams has proved to be a success. Guest appearances by country singers Kim Richey and Emmy- lou Harris make Heartbreaker no ordinary debut. It is an introspective tearjerker, an earthy, spare production, with Adams's cracked, worldly voice holding it together, while the pianos, banjos, harmonicas, and acoustic guitar play in the background. First-person songs examine failed romantic relationships. A sorrowful, wailing harmonica accompanies cry-in-your-beer tunes such as \"Sweet Car- olina,\" a duet with Emmylou Harris, and the desperate, waltzy ballad \"Why Do You Leave?\" Adams quickly signed to Lost Highway, the country- rock imprint of Universal Music Group. Gold (2001), which Adams wrote while living in Los Angeles, brought him some attention. The video for \"New York, New York,\" the album's first track, showed the downtown skyline of Manhattan and was recorded just a few days before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It became an unintended anthem. Adams called \"New York, New York\" his love letter to the city, but did not mean it to be patriotic. In the chorus he sings, \"Love don't play any games with me like she did before / The world won't wait so I better shake / That thing right through the door / Hell I still love you though, New York.\" With its Hammond organ, chugging beat, and a guitar lick worthy of the Rolling Stones, \"New York, New York\" is Gold's most inspirational moment. Gold's other fifteen tracks are mostly mid-tempo musings on city life, relationships, and late nights at bars. \"La Cienega Just Smiled\" is lovely. \"When the Stars Go Blue\" was covered by Bono of U2 and the Corrs shortly after the album's release. With a chameleonlike voice, Adams conjures the raw grit and rebellious spirit of Steve Earle one minute, and the sweetness and desperation of a folksinger the next. He has the disheveled, devil-may-care demeanor of a true punk rocker and the heart of a die-hard romantic troubadour unafraid to wear his heart on his sleeve. As a musician, his instincts are more varied than any single genre could convey.

CARRIE HAVRANEK Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 7 King Sunny Ade KING SUNNY ADE Born: Sunday Adeniy; Oshogbo, Nigeria, 1946 Genre: World Best-selling album since 1990: Odu (1998) Sunny Ade, son of a royal Yoruban family — his father was a Methodist minister-church organ- ist and his mother was leader of the choir — was interested in percussion instruments as a child, but his parents opposed a career in music: A Niger- ian prince was meant to pursue law. At age sev- enteen Ade quit school to go to Lagos, teach himself to play guitar, and join the Rhythm Dandies, a high-life band run by Moses Olaiya (subsequently famous throughout Africa as Baba Sala, a comic and filmmaker). So began Ade's commercial empire, based on a tradition-based but futuristic, polyrhythmic West African guitar- orchestra dance style called \"juju music.\" The term juju may be imitative of the sounds of a small hexogonal tambourine. Others believe that it is a dispar- agement (like \"mumbo jumbo\") that musicians turn topsy- turvy or a variant of jojo, Yoruban for \"dance.\" The post-World War II Nigerian singer/songwriter Tunde Nightingale and bandleader I. K. Dairo pioneered the style and influenced Ade, as did American soul stars James Brown and Brook Benton and the country singer Jim Reeves. Ade established his first band, the Green Spots (referring to Dairo's Blue Spots) in 1966, emphasizing Yoruba religious rhythms performed on hand-held per- cussion devices and two-head \"talking drums,\" pulsating through interlocking layers of electric guitar riffs. He used this format in twelve albums recorded through 1974, reis- sued on CD as The Best of the Classic Years (2003). Ade and juju music thrived during an era of oil- industry profitability and overall optimism in independent Nigeria. His subtle but energized and positive songs, with lyrics conveying social lessons through ancient Yoruban proverbs and parables, reflected a sophisticated Africa look- ing forward. When legal problems beset his anangement with the Nigeria-Africa Song label, Ade formed his own firm, connected to the major U.S. label Decca Records, to back his new band, the African Beats. In 1982 the inter- nationally distributed label Island Records signed King Sunny to a recording contract, hoping he would become the next black star to reach the heights of the recently deceased reggae singer/songwriter Bob Marley. Ade's American debut album, Juju Music (1982), and his follow-up, SyncrO'System (1983), were well received, and he embarked on tours of the United States, Europe, and Japan with a troupe of some thirty members, including female background singers, interweaving electric guitarists and bassists, three talking drummers, a trap-set drummer, other percussionists, and players of electric keyboards, syn- thesizers, pedal-steel guitars, vibes, xylophones, and accor- dions. The singers shake beads and shells and netted gourds; the talking drummers ape speech patterns, hammering out fast phrases with curved sticks against drumheads, stretched taut or slackened to produce various tones. The guitarists play catchy, repetitive, sparkling grooves. The odd soloist dashes across the ensemble's steady state of sonic flux. The rhythms are irresistible, seemingly ancient and profound yet funky; they compel the body to move. French producer Michael Messonier collaborated on Ade's third U.S. album, Aura (1984), with Stevie Won- der as harmonica soloist on the title track. But the mix muted the African Beat's power, and sales were disap- pointing. Though Ade performed in and contributed music to Robert Altman's film O. C. and Stiggs (1985), he was dropped by Island in 1988. In one well-publicized incident his band quit in the midst of a Japanese concert. Through the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s Ade continued to release albums in Nigeria — his catalog there numbers more than a hundred — and appeared irregularly, purportedly to \"combat rumors of my demise,\" usually in world music cir- cuit venues. King Sunny Ade and His African Beat: Live at Montreux, a concert video released by Island Visual Arts in 1990, was shot during a 1983 performance. In the early 1990s Ade sharpened his aim. Though he remained in the Yoruban tradition of praise singer rather than gadfly or polemicist like his friend and rival, the late Fela Kuti, he wrote more pointed lyrics, including a song about family planning, an ironic subject for a father of twelve. Ade has invested his superstar earnings wisely and par- ticipates in the running of an oil firm, a mining company, a nightclub, and film and video production houses, among other concerns. Named the first president of the Musical Cooperative Society of Nigeria in 1982, Ade continues as chairman of the society's Advisory Council and as \"patron\" of the Juju Bandleaders' Association. He chairs the Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria, and founded the King Sunny Ade Foundation with other Nigerian civic and business leaders. Mesa recorded and released E Dide/Get Up (1995), Ade's first American studio album in over a decade. Ade also convened an African supergroup to record \"The Way Forward,\" his composition advocating political unity among Nigerians of diverse ethnic strains. His next U.S. album, Odu (1998) — recorded in Louisiana — was celebrated as his return to top form. With management from the Seattle-based world music producer Andy Franklin, Ade has mounted new tours of Europe and the United States. Ade remains a heroic entertainer, a lean, closely cropped man with a tight smile and great reverb, and the 8 Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 Aerosmith most elegant imaginable duckwalk-with-instrument. Ade slings his guitars low over his shoulder down to his hip or knees. He is a musician of nuance, not overkill — a mas- ter of chord placement rather than a single -note line won- der. He understands tempi and pacing, and he often performs sets of an uninterrupted two or three hours. His immediately identifiable sound is a beacon of Afro-pop, influencing Caribbean dance styles, including reggae, soca, calypso, the music of African exiles in Europe, world music hybrids like Afro-Celt Sound System, and U.S. jam bands.

HOWARD MANDEL AEROSMITH Formed: 1970, Sunapee, New Hampshire Members: Tom Hamilton, bass (born Colorado Springs, Colorado, 31 December 1951); Joey Kramer, drums (born Bronx, New York, 21 June 1950); Joe Perry, lead guitar (born Lawrence, Massachusetts, 10 September 1950); Steven Tyler, lead vocals (born Steven Victor Tallarico, Yonkers, New York, 26 March 1948); Brad Whitford, rhythm guitar (born Winchester, Massachusetts, 23 February 1952). Former members: Jimmy Crespo, lead guitar (born, Brooklyn, New York, 5 July 1952); Rick Dufay, guitar (born Richard Marc Dufay, Paris, France, 19 February 1952). Genre: Rock Best-selling album since 1990: Get a Grip (1993) Hit songs since 1990: \"Cryin,\" \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,\" \"Jaded\" Since the early 1970s Aerosmith has been one of the most popular bands in rock music and synonymous with a lusty, bad-boy persona. Buoyed by a remarkable comeback in the late 1980s, a cleaner, sober version of the band went on to even greater success. Ironically, the rock titans owe a portion of their rebound to rap music. From Unknowns to Superstars Singer Steve Tyler and guitarist Joe Perry formed Aerosmith in 1970 in the resort town of Sunapee, New Hampshire, where their families both owned summer homes. Tyler was already a veteran of the band Chain Reaction, which had recorded with Verve Records and was an opening act for the Yardbirds and the Beach Boys. Tyler had admired Perry's playing in a rock group called Jam Band and they decided to form Aerosmith. They added guitarist Brad Whitford, bass player Tom Hamilton, and drummer Joey Kramer, moved to Boston, and began com- peting for gigs in the local area. Aerosmith 's reputation as an exciting club band spread fast across the northeast and in 1972 they managed to secure a record deal with Columbia Records. Their debut album, Aerosmith (1973), was a success in the Boston area but nationwide sales were only luke- warm, despite the band's hitting the charts with their bal- lad \"Dream On.\" In pursuit of more exposure, they began to extensively tour, taking time off to record a second album, Get Your Wings (1974). This album sold better as the band's audience had expanded and Aerosmith was hit- ting full stride, with critics hailing them as an American version of the Rolling Stones. Their flamboyant concerts featured a swaggeringly raw, muscular rock. Perry's guitar hung low off his pelvis like an afterthought, an extra appendage that chunked chords and seared blistering solos while Tyler strutted from one side of the stage to the other. Pouting his oversized lips to the crowd, whipping them into frenzy with his lurid strut, Tyler was quickly gaining a reputation as one of hard rock's greatest lead singers. Fur- thermore, Tyler's voice could hop two octaves into a melodic scream. His vocal work on \"Dream On\" is an example. Whitford, Hamilton, and Kramer provided a fierce rhythm usually based around Perry's pulsating gui- tar riff with Tyler's rapid-fire lyrics spewing rhyming chron- icles of sexual conquests and related misbehavior. Aerosmith was turning into America's rock and roll icon and their next album, the mega-selling Toys in the Attic (1975), cemented that image. It contains the sassy \"Sweet Emotion\" and rock anthem \"Walk This Way.\" Toys in the Attic remained a top seller for years and dramati- cally increased the sales of the first two releases, leading the way to Aerosmith's superstardom. They began head- lining stadium-sized venues all over the world and subse- quent albums, especially Rocks (1976), sold extremely well. However, just like their indulgent image onstage, the members of Aerosmith were also indulging offstage in every excess that rock superstardom offers. Particularly rowdy were Tyler and Perry, who digested such a variety of drugs that they were labeled \"The Toxic Twins.\" By 1979 fatigue and craziness from seven straight years of touring and recording caused tremendous turmoil within the band. Perry finally left to go solo and journeyman guitarist Jimmy Crespo replaced him. Two years later disgruntled rhythm guitarist Whitford departed to start a band with Ted Nugent's disgruntled rhythm guitarist Derek St. Holmes. Rick Dufay took Whitford's place. Their subsequent Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 9 Aerosmith recordings sold poorly and in 1981 Tyler suffered a seri- ous motorcycle accident that required more than six months of recovery. He returned and Aerosmith contin- ued, but many wrote them off as finished. The Comeback In 1984 Perry and Whitford, unsuccessful in their ven- tures, rejoined the other members, putting Aerosmith back in its original form — but by no means was the band reformed. Drug and alcohol consumption was even more prevalent as they stumbled through two tours and one album, Done with Mirrors (1985). Finally, each member surrendered to rehabilitation for substance abuse and a sober Aerosmith emerged. Their first post-rehab effort was in collaboration with the rap group Run-D.M.C. on a rap version of \"Walk This Way.\" The single was an enormous seller, went high on the charts, and was just the push that Aerosmith needed. Their next album, Permanent Vacation (1987), continued in a commercial vein and produced three chart hits, most notably \"Dude Looks Like a Lady,\" which was featured in the hit movie Mrs . Doubtfire ( 1 993 ) . The album went triple platinum and Aerosmith was once again riding high, albeit sober. After roaring out of the 1980s in a storm of success, Aerosmith began the 1990s on hiatus in preparation for the recording of their next album, Get a Grip ( 1993 ). The album lacked some of the rawness that older fans had come to expect, but Aerosmith was sensing that music tastes were changing from a harder rock/blues sound to what would later be called alternative rock and they understood firsthand from their work with Run-D.M.C. how a change in style could pay off. In contrast to the plunder of their previous work, the newer songs made note of what all that plunder really meant. While still carrying their trademark swagger, several of the songs, such as \"Get a Grip,\" \"Liv- ing on the Edge,\" and \"Fever,\" speak of the depths of drug misery and a newfound peace in sobriety. The lyrics \"Now I'm feeling low down, even slow seems way too fast, and now the booze don't work and the drugs ran out of gas\" sung in \"Fever\" reveal some of this. Get a Grip contains three power ballads, \"Amazing,\" \"Crazy,\" and \"Cryin,\" all of which landed high on the charts, and the album was a giant, selling 12 million copies. An MTV video of \"Crazy\" introduced the world to Tyler's then sixteen-year-old daughter, Liv Tyler, as she and actress Alicia Silverstone played the video's main characters. Ms. Tyler later became a major movie star and the video represented Tyler's return to responsible fatherhood. \"Crazy\" won a 1995 Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Group, as did \"Living on the Edge\" in 1994. Aerosmith spent much of the mid-1990s on another world tour, during which the band silenced skeptics who did not think they could still deliver the snarling rock of their past. After the tour, they recorded Nine Lives (1997), which scored a Grammy nomination in 1998 for Best Rock Album. Nine Lives was recorded amidst unfounded rumors that the band was doing drugs again and the ensuing chaos within the group resulted in them firing their manager. The hard-rocking album is a hear- kening back to the band's early days with heavy riffs driv- ing a frolicking spirit. A rock ballad in the style for which Aerosmith is reknown, the sweeping \"Hole in My Soul\" is one of the album's highlights. A European printing of Nine Lives features two extra songs. One of them, \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,\" written by Dianne Warren, is among the four songs that Aerosmith contributed to the movie soundtrack Armageddon (1998). The film stars Liv Tyler and the song became Aerosmith's first number one hit. By 1999 Nine Lives reached 6 million in sales and scored the band another Grammy for \"Pink.\" Many felt that Aerosmith would slow down in the new millennium as the band members had reached or were close to reaching their fifties, but they came blasting back. Intermittently that year Aerosmith sequestered itself in an old farmhouse creating material for their next record, Just Push Play (2001), which they would also produce. In January 2001 they pre-released a ballad off the album, \"Jaded,\" and promoted it with a memorable appearance at halftime of the 2001 Super Bowl, billed with pop sen- sations *NSYNC and Britney Spears. They appeared shortly after in Los Angeles at the American Music Awards and followed that with their fourth appearance on the tel- evision show Saturday Night Live. Just Push Play was released on March 19, 2001, the same day that the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The artist Kid Rock introduced them at the Hall of Fame cer- emonies and joined them in a performance of \"Sweet Emo- tion.\" Aerosmith then teased the crowd with their gentle \"Jaded\" before segueing into the powerhouse classic, \"Train Kept a Rollin.\" The crowd, mostly music industry insid- ers, was electrified. By April, Just Push Play had gone plat- inum in sales and Aerosmith was at the start of a sold-out worldwide tour. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, interrupted the tour, but only for six days. Tyler strongly advocated the healing powers of rock music and the importance of the United States resuming its normal activities. In October they performed a Washington, D.C, concert to benefit victims of the tragedy. Aerosmith released another successful compilation album, O' Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits (2002) and moved to Hawaii in 2003 to record their next studio release. In August they kicked off a world tour with KISS, another band of surviving rock legends. On February 7, 2003, Aero- smith performed with myriad top artists to celebrate and benefit the Blues Music Foundation at New York's Radio City Music Hall in what was billed as the music event of the year. 10 Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 AfroCelts Aerosmith set out in the 1970s with the goal to become the greatest rock band in the world. In some assess- ments, they achieved that goal and then surpassed it with massive staying power in the pop rock scene later on. Aero- smith was first identified by their boisterous rock sound, but may be remembered longer for their powerful rock ballads.

Genre: World, Fusion Best-selling album since 1990: Volume 3: Further in Time (2001) Hit songs since 1990: \"When You're Falling\" (2001) AfroCelts is the name taken by the ensemble formerly known as Afro-Celt Sound System upon the release of its fourth album, Seed (2003). The band's conceits and charms remain the same: AfroCelts is a recording and concertizing troupe creating a fantasy fusion. In it, African drums accent keening U.K. pop and traditional singing, electric guitars, studio keyboards, and strings, and identifiably Gaelic instruments such as uilleann pipes, bodhran, and Breton harp are also blended into the band's technically slick and sophisticated mix. Over the course of a selective performance schedule initiated at Peter Gabriel's July 1995 WOMAD (World of Music Art and Dance) festival in Reading, England, and the release of four albums, AfroCelts has realized the orig- inal inspiration of Simon Emmerson. Emmerson first toyed with the multicultural notion of mixing African and Celtic signature sounds by introducing uilleann pipes into an album he produced for Senegalese singer/bandleader Baba Maal in the late 1980s. Emmerson was at the time also a producer of Afro-pop and active in the experimental dance world. He drew on both circles of contacts to convene musicians from West Africa and the British Isles for the WOMAD sojourn, though he claimed his collaborators were merely fellow residents of his London neighborhood, a hotbed of musicians, mixers, and sound studios. James McNally of the Irish band the Pogues and Mar- tin Russell of the hard-core Irish hip-hop band Marxman have become Emmerson's co-producers and co-composers. The intricate arrangements require creative input from kora player N'Faly Kouyate and percussionist Moussa Sis- soko and uilleann pipists, including Ronan Browne, from the touring cast of the theatrical event \"Riverdance.\" Early on, Emmerson was encouraged by visual artist Jamie Reid, who created his work \"Afro Celts: Music from the Light Continent: Sound Magic\" especially for the cover of Afro- Celt Sound System's debut album, Volume I : Sound Magic (1996), prior to its production. Afro-Celt Sound System made its U.S. concert debut in July 1997, after having established itself as a U.K. suc- cess through a repeat WOMAD festival performance in 1996. It gained attention at well-received concerts at the Cambridge Folk Festival, Tribal Gathering (attended by a dance crowd), and at the Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands (cablecast on MTV). The band made its WOMAD USA festival debut in 1999, and Gabriel sang with it at WOMAD USA 2001, making his first Ameri- can performance since 1992. Though AfroCelts spotlights the undiluted talents of traditionalists, it is not a purist folk unit. Afro-Celt Sound System recordings always have glossy pop formulas and at Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 11 Christina Aguilera least one mainstream rock ballad at their cores. One description of the compositional equation as \"jigs and reels atop global percussion and rave rhythms\" ignores Emmer- son's heroic guitar lines and proud balladry that in Vol- ume 3: Further in Time (2001 ) was given voice by Gabriel (on \"When You're Falling\"), Sinead O'Connor (on the title track), and Robert Plant, of Led Zeppelin fame (on \"Life Begin Again\"). McNally concurs, saying, \"Our style of writing and playing music does not pretend to adhere to any particu- lar traditional style except our own . . . music rooted in the past that's reaching into the future.\" On Seed (2002), AfroCelts departs from its central African and Celtic sources to include a flamenco guitar solo and a Brazilian singer. The album is promoted as AfroCelts's new begin- ning, and something of a regrouping after the death in 1997 of keyboardist Jo Bruce, son of Jack Bruce, bassist for the legendary British blues-rock band Cream. Emmerson, discussing the ensembles' name change, explained, \"We're not a sound system anymore. . . . We've developed a very defined sound which has come from us playing together. It's not about a DJ and programs and sam- ples. It's taken a long time, but we've finally become a band.\" Presumably a pinch of hardship is necessary to leaven cleverness and virtuosity in the achievement of such musical status.

HOWARD MANDEL CHRISTINA AGUILERA Born: Christina Maria Aguilera; Staten Island, New York, 18 December 1980 Genre: R&B, Pop, Latin, Rock Best-selling album since 1990: Christina Aguilera (1999) Hit songs since 1990: \"Genie in a Bottle,\" \"What a Girl Wants\" After becoming one of the most popular teen pop singers of the late 1990s, Christina Aguilera sought to break out of the squeaky-clean image and sound that she had helped popularize along with the teen queen Britney Spears. With a strong, expressive voice that set her apart from other carefully packaged pop acts, the singer underwent a public image makeover that saw her reemerge as a streetwise, salacious sex bomb. Christina Aguilera [ap/wide world photos] Born in New York to parents of Irish and Ecuadorian descent, Aguilera endured a peripatetic childhood because of her father's military career. When the family landed in Philadelphia, Aguilera began her performing career by appearing in local talent shows at age six. The minidiva graduated to a losing appearance on the televised talent show Star Search in 1988, later joining the cast of the Dis- ney Channel's The New Mickey Mouse Club in 1992; the cast featured Spears as well as Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez, future members of the boy band *NSYNC. In 1994 Aguilera moved to Japan, recording a duet, \"All I Wanna Do,\" with Japanese pop star Keizo Nakan- ishi. She returned to the United States in 1998 to record the song \"Reflection\" for the Disney animated film Mulan. The song helped secure a recording contract with RCA, 12 Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 Ahrens and Flaherty which issued Aguilera's self-titled debut in the summer of 1999. Released seven months after Spears's debut, Christina Aguilera hewed closely to the pop formula employed by the singer's fellow Mickey Mouse Club alum: saccharine ballads mixed with catchy pop and slickly produced rhythm and blues songs. With a stable of some of the music indus- try's most able songwriters behind her, Aguilera was able to concentrate on her vocals, which climbed to Whitney Houston-like pop gospel heights on tracks such as \"I Turn to You.\" The album spawned the instantly hummable, number one hit \"Genie in a Bottle,\" a slinky dance-pop confec- tion on which the squeaky-clean, blonde -haired teenager sings the controversial lines, \"If you want to be with me, baby there's a price to pay / I'm a genie in a bottle / You gotta rub me the right way.\" Despite its smash number one charting success, the song's burbling keyboards and generic electronic drumbeats did little to distinguish Aguil- era from her peers. The album also spawned the hits \"What a Girl Wants\" and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You).\" Aguilera took home a Grammy in 2000 for Best New Artist. Hopping onto another trend of the moment, Aguil- era released a Spanish-language album in September 2000. Though half-Ecuadorian, Aguilera did not speak Spanish, which required that she learn how to sing the album's songs phonetically. A combination of Spanish versions of her hits (\"Genio Atrapado\") and new tracks, the album was quickly followed by the Christmas offering, My Kind of Christmas. The holiday album mixes renditions of tradi- tional Christmas tunes such as \"Have Yourself a Merry Lit- tle Christmas\" with a handful of songs written by Aguilera. A Controversial Career Makeover An unsanctioned album of demos recorded by Aguil- era when she was fourteen and fifteen, ]ust Be Free, was released to the singer's chagrin in June 2001. After a short period out of the spotlight, Aguilera emerged as part of a female supergroup to cover Patti Labelle's disco hit \"Lady Marmalade\" for the Moulin Rouge movie soundtrack. Dressed in lingerie, a large gold nose ring, and thick makeup, Aguilera took her place alongside singers Pink and Mya and rapper Lil' Kim in the video for the song, which became one of the biggest hits of 2001 and won a Grammy in 2002 for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. The new look was the beginning of a makeover for the singer, who seemed desperate to break out of her girl-next- door image and distance herself from other pop-divas-in- the-making such as Jessica Simpson and Mandy Moore. Just three years after bursting onto the scene, a barely recognizable Aguilera emerged in 2002 with Stripped, a col- lection of intensely personal songs co-written and co- produced by the singer. Along with the album's cover, which features a topless Aguilera in low-slung pants with only her hair covering her breasts, the video for the album's first single, \"Dirrty,\" made it clear that this was a new Aguilera. Joined by rapper Redman in the clip for the las- civious, high-energy R&B dance song, a barely clothed, heavily pierced and dreadlocked Aguilera — now prefer- ring the name X-Tina — shimmies amid a panoply of gritty and bizarre characters, from masked female boxers and bodybuilders to mudwrestlers and fire-eaters. Heavily influenced by rap and rock music, Stripped is full of defiant lyrics in which Aguilera derides her glossy pop image and strikes out at ex-lovers and an abusive father while painting a portrait of the complex, conflicted woman behind the hype. Showcasing her more mature, wider range, Aguilera shines on the album's sweeping ballads, including the smoky, jazzy \"Walk Away,\" in which she sings \"I was naive, your love was like candy / Artificially sweet, I was deceived by the wrapping / Got caught in your web and I learned how to bleed / I was prey in our bed and devoured completely.\" Though a critical and commercial backlash greeted the perhaps too-transgressive \"Dirrty,\" Aguilera accom- plished the rarest of feats for a teen pop act: a second act. Successfully breaking out of and remaking her manufac- tured image, Aguilera's powerful voice and emerging song- writing style showed promise for the former Mouseketeer's career prospects.

GIL KAUFMAN AHRENS AND FLAHERTY Members: Lynn Ahrens (born New York, New York, 1 Octo- ber 1948); Stephen Flaherty (born Pittsburgh, Pennsylva- nia, 18 September 1960). Genre: Musical Theater Best-selling album since 1990: Ragtime [Original Cast Recording] (1998) The team of lyricist Lynn Ahrens and composer Stephen Flaherty found a marked degree of success within the musical theater world of the 1990s, writing with enough complexity to please critics while retaining a cheery tunefulness that appealed to mainstream audiences. Stylistically, the pair falls between legendary composer Stephen Sondheim, whose work has been criti- cally praised but often popularly ignored, and Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Popular Musicians Since 1990 13 Air Frank Wildhorn, whose hook-laden pop scores gained 1990s commercial success but critical deri- sion. Ahrens and Flaherty are unique in their abil- ity to write in many different styles; the sound of their work is largely shaped by the setting and sub- ject matter of the material. While they gained recognition in the late 1990s for film scoring, Ahrens and Flaherty remain devoted to the musi- cal theater form, with several of their shows rank- ing among the most recognizable Broadway theater productions of the decade. Lynn Ahrens came to musical theater after a distin- guished career in television writing and production. Dur- ing the 1970s she contributed songs such as \"Interplanet Janet\" and \"Do the Circulation\" for the popular children's Schoolhouse Rock television series. In 1982 she attended the prestigious BMI Musical Theatre Workshop, where she met Flaherty, who had written musicals since his teenage years. Soon the pair began working on a theatrical version of the 1967 film, Bedazzled, but were forced to abandon the proj- ect after failing to obtain the stage rights. Fortunately, the musical captured the interest of Playwrights Horizons, a New York off-Broadway t"
