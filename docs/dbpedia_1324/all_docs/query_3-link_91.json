As the IES is a general Code of Ethics, FIG council has asked the Working Group 1.1 to look for best practice examples of the IES-Code in our professional environment (surveying, geospatial, land management, valuation, construction surveying, cadastre, â¦.). At the meeting FIG members and participants can present and discuss best practice examples. Once these best practice examples are identified and discussed FIG Council will check whether the current FIG Ethics Code should be updated or adapted to the IES-Code. This can finally lead to a discussion about a harmonisation or replacement of the existing Ethical Code of FIG.\n\nRead the report of WG 1.1 - International Ethics and Standards\n\nGary Strong (United Kingdom):\n\nInternational Ethics Standards (IES) (10628)\n\n[abstract] [paper]\n\nNigel Sellars (United Kingdom):\n\nChallenges for Surveying Professionals in the 21st Century â Ethics and the Importance of Stakeholder Engagement (10399)\n\n[abstract] [paper]\n\nMonday,\n\n11 May\n\n14:00â15:30\n\nTS01A: Blended Learning and Innovations in Professional Education\n\nCommission: 2\n\nOrganiser: Dr. David Mitchell, FIG Commission 2 Chair, Australia\n\nBlended learning is a key theme of FIG Commission 2 and this session highlights innovative practices in blended learning by the FIG community.

Maria Henriques, FIG Commission 6 Chair, Portugal\n\nPhotogrammetry is an old technique, renewed in the 1990âs when new computing techniques were developed, making it user-friendly. Concerning equipment, the technical progresses in the field of digital photography together with UAV helped to expand its domains of use. Due to their skills, engineering surveyors quickly mastered the technique and the equipment. This session is a good example since it includes presentations related to the use of photogrammetry and UAV, but also with the technique itself including the desired theme of accuracy.\n\nAlessandro Capra (Italy):\n\nUnderwater Photogrammetry for Change Detection (10745)\n\n[abstract] [paper]\n\nPietro Grimaldi (Italy):\n\nArchitectonic Photogrammetry and Earthquake of 1980 in Italy (10779)\n\n[abstract] [paper]\n\nNaa Lamkai Quaye - Ballard, Daniel Asenso Gyambibi and Jonathan Quaye - Ballard (Ghana):\n\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for Topographical Mapping of Inaccessible Land Areas in Ghana: a Cost Effective Approach (10476)\n\n[abstract] [paper]\n\nGiuseppina Vacca (Italy):\n\nWEB Open Drone Map (WebODM) a Software Open Source to Photogrammetry Process (10728)\n\n[abstract] [paper]\n\nKenneth Varner (Germany):\n\nA Toolset for Automating 1mm Measurement Accuracy in Photogrammetry Surveys (10623)\n\n[abstract] [paper]\n\nHeinz-Juergen Przybilla and Baeumker Manfred (Germany):\n\nRTK and PPK: GNSS-Technologies for Direct Georeferencing of UAV Image Flights (10801)\n\n[abstract] [paper]\n\nMonday,\n\n11 May\n\n14:00â15:30\n\nTS01C: Roundtable: Task Force 2021 Governance\n\nOrganiser: Dr. Diane Dumashie, FIG Vice President, United Kingdom\n\nThe Task Force on the Future Governance of FIG is an internal Task Force focusing on an evaluation and proposal of potential changes of the current FIG Governance.

Given the implied ties to sea level, this effort takes on a more significant role for surveyors and the geodetic and cadastral agencies developing such models. The importance of accurately understanding the land/water interface and the flow of water is critical for many regions around the world.

This session will be interactive where your expert views can inform a new unregistered land valuation manual that will cover about 70 percent of the land surface of the world. This FIG session will follow on from the initial masterclass held at World Bank Land 2020 and will discuss the preliminary work of the authors, initial concepts that need to be recognised and included and also act as an opportunity to engage the global FIG family of land professionals.\n\nThe session will begin with a presentation by Dr. Mike McDermott and Dr. Peter Wyatt, providing an overview of the proposed guide, a report on the World Bank Land 2020 masterclass (and other connected sessions), an open discussion on the format of the GLTN manual and a debate on the changing nature of valuation and its critical interaction with developing world land security, informality and differing forms of tenure.\n\nTuesday,\n\n12 May\n\n15:30â16:00\n\nExhibition Area, RAI\n\nAfternoon Break\n\nTuesday,\n\n12 May\n\n16:00â17:30\n\nFIG Corporate Members Meeting\n\nOrganiser: Prof. Dr. Rudolf Staiger, FIG President, Germany\n\nBy invitation only\n\nThe 2020 FIG Corporate Members Meeting is where the corporate membership within FIG meets the FIG Administration to exchange information, provide feedback and discuss on-going and proposed activities.\n\nTuesday,\n\n12 May\n\n16:00â17:30\n\nTS05A: Responsible Land Administration Teaching Essentials\n\nCommission: 2 and 7\n\nOrganiser: Dr. David Mitchell, FIG Commission 2 Chair, Australia &\n\nMr. Daniel Paez, FIG Commission 7 Chair, Australia\n\nThis joint Commission 2 and 7 session involves presentations about the GLTN project â Responsible Land Administration Teaching Essentials: A structured knowledge base.

And with increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, coupled with rapid urbanization and inadequate drainage - there is a devastating potential for floods, where lives and property are at an enormous risk. Mitigating this threat effectively requires moving from a fragmented perception to an integrated, cross-disciplinary and proactive approach for considering the multiple processes and scales involved, and thus being able to represent current conditions, anticipate changes, and improve decisions resulting in improved environmental sustainability. 4D digital twins can become the common and federating indexâ bringing together reality meshes, terrain models, imagery, and GIS sources as well as hydrometeorological data to comprehensively model, analyze and simulate floods.\n\nRoundtable Discussion Topics:\n\nCreation of digital twins including creation of digital context and continuous updates. How a digital model can be used for prevention through virtual inspection of actual storm water utilities, dams, as well as underwater structure (tetrapods, dykesâ¦).\n\nNon-structural mitigation / adaptation measures (such as flood risk maps, flood forecasting and early warning systems, spatial planning / flood risk adapted land use, flood action plans at a local scale) vs. sometimes overestimated and highly engineered traditional structural measures.\n\nWater quality-quantity nexus â floods can cause pollution and water scarcity can increase pollutants concentration.\n\nBidirectional communication before and during crises is essential to raise public awareness, reinforce preparedness, minimize outrage, but also for obtaining valuable feedback and insights from the population.\n\nReal world examples of flood modeling and simulation at city and site scale.\n\nWednesday,\n\n13 May\n\n11:00â12:30\n\nTS06C: Europe and Middle East Experiences in Land Administration\n\nCommission: 7\n\nOrganiser: Mr. Daniel Paez, FIG Commission 7 Chair, Australia\n\nEurope and the middle east countries have a long history of land administration systems.
