        "text": "The Fellows is a first of its kind thinking initiative at The School of Thinking, designed to advance the participants’ expertise in selected heuristics and frameworks of thinking. The workflow is carried out by the former students of the SoT’s Regular Track (Alpha & Iota), who remain affiliated with the SoT programme, and CLEA affiliates. The Fellows will be gathering on a monthly basis to specialize in one or more framework(s) of thinking, which are coherent, well developed, well operationalised, and very different from their own thinking comfort zones.\n\nSessions will be held ONLINE or at CLEA (Krijgskundestraat / Rue de la Stratégie 33) on the following days (19:00-22:30) or online:"
