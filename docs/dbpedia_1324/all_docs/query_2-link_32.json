Based on brain anatomy, I will derive a novel approach of goal directed behaviour and its learning. In short, I suggest that goal selection is implemented as part of the limbic loop connecting the hippocampus to the ventral basal ganglia, which reads-out of the virtualization in the memory system by the selection system to trigger the execution of a plan. Plan execution is then performed by further, hierarchically organised, cortex – basal ganglia loops, where lower level loops are constrained by objectives determined on higher level loops. Examples of simulation data from models are compared to experimental data.\n\n—\n\nFred Hamker graduated in electrical engineering from the University of Paderborn in 1994 and received his PhD from the Faculty of Computer Science at the Technical University of Ilmenau in 1999. He worked at the JW Goethe University Frankfurt am Main and the California Institute of Technology (Pasadena, USA). In 2003, he founded a research group at the University of Münster in the Department of Psychology. Since 2009, he has held the professorship of Artificial Intelligence at the TU Chemnitz. Since 2010 he is associated with the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin.\n\nHis research group takes a model-driven approach to studying how the brain works, with the goal of developing novel intelligent cognitive systems. Models are developed that help interpret psychological and neuroscientific data, thus contributing directly to the understanding of the brain. Likewise, research is being done on the transfer of neuroscientific knowledge into new concepts of artificial (brain-inspired) intelligence.\n\nModel-based and model-free reinforcement learning mechanisms in brains and robot\n\nMehdi Khamassi\n\nThe reinforcement learning (RL) theory constitutes a framework for an artificial agent to learn actions that maximize rewards in the environment. It has been successfully applied to Neuroscience to account for animal neural and behavioral processes in simple laboratory tasks, such as Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, and single-step economic decision-making tasks. It moreover became very popular due to its account for dopamine reward prediction error signals. However, more complex multi-step tasks, such as navigation and social interaction tasks, illustrate their computational limitations.\n\nIn parallel, researches in engineering, in robotics in particular, have emphasized the complementarity between different learning strategies when facing complex tasks, and explored solutions to combine these different strategies. One central distinction is between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning strategies: In the former case, an agent learns a statistical model of the effects of its actions in the environment, and then use this model to plan sequences of actions towards desired goals. In contrast, model-free strategies are relevant when the environment statistics are too noisy to learn a good internal model. In this case, RL agents can rather learn local action values and adapt reactively in each state of the environment.\n\nIn this presentation, I will show a series of work where we used a coordination of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning to account for a diversity of behavioral and neural observations in humans, non-human primates and rodents in different paradigms: Navigation, instrumental and Pavlovian conditioning. I will moreover present recent robotics results where the same algorithm with the same parameters produces optimal performance in simple navigation and social interaction tasks, with a drastically reduced computational cost compared to classical methods. Finally, I will show how the patterns of mental simulation within such internal models can mimic experimentally observed reactivations of the rodent hippocampus in spatial cognition tasks, and raise new predictions for future experiments.\n\n—\n\nMehdi Khamassi is a research director employed by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and working at the Institute of Intelligent Systems and Robotics (ISIR), on the campus of Sorbonne Université, Paris, France.

He explores the functional anatomy of neurological symptoms within the context of brain networks, utilizing an array of research tools such as functional MRI, EMG, SPECT, and TMS. His investigations encompass resting-state functional connectivity, effective connectivity through DCM, and task-based cerebral activity. The ultimate objective of his work is to unveil the origins of neurological symptoms, paving the way for innovative diagnostics and treatments for individuals grappling with movement disorders. Dr. Helmich’s impactful research has yielded valuable insights, as evidenced by his contributions to numerous publications, including studies examining stress and mindfulness in Parkinson’s disease and the amplification of Parkinson’s tremor under cognitive load.\n\nSergi Bermúdez\n\nThis seminar will explore the potential applications of virtual reality (VR) technology in stroke rehabilitation and fitness training. The integration of entertainment technology has been instrumental in advancing Virtual Rehabilitation research, leading to a surge in studies in this domain. The presentation will delve into the role of neurosciences in stroke rehabilitation research, the design methodology for rehabilitation applications, and the challenges of personalizing and customizing rehabilitation technology. The synergy between technology and neuroscience research is driving the field’s expansion. Developing VR applications involves formulating hypotheses based on technology’s underlying science and addressing customization to cater to each patient’s specific deficits, engagement, and comparison to conventional treatments in randomized control trials. This seminar will comprehensively review the approaches used in the last decade at the NeuroRehabLab for developing VR systems, encompassing hardware, software, design, and implementation methodologies.\n\n—\n\nSergi Bermudez is an Associate Professor and researcher with expertise in Informatics, Human-Computer Interaction, Entertainment Technologies, and Neurorehabilitation.

A relatively simple view that highlighted the contribution of one major form of heterosynaptic plasticity to cerebellar motor learning has given way to a plethora of perspectives that suggest that many different forms of synaptic and non-synaptic plasticity, acting at various sites, can control multiple types of learning behaviour including cognitive processes. The challenge is to reconcile these different mechanisms and unite them into a single overall concept. In this lecture I review our current understanding of the changes in the activity of cerebellar Purkinje cells in different ‘microzones’ during various forms of learning. During the initial stages of relatively simple forms of learning, such as modification of sensorimotor reflexes, the simple spike activity of each microzone is bound to either increase or decrease. Instead, during more complex forms of learning, including planning and decision making, mixed sequences of increases and decreases of activity can occur within individual microzones, operating as ensembles in synergy. In either case, the upbound and downbound changes in activity in the microzones appear to depend on the directional and temporal demands of the downstream circuitry involved, continuously finetuning and orchestrating the optimal behaviour. In my lecture for the Donders Cognition, Brain and Technology Summer School I will highlight these fundamental principles as well as the clinical implications.\n\n—\n\nDr. Christian de Zeeuw began his academic journey with a PhD in medicine Cum Laude under Jan Voogd at the University of Rotterdam, generating a new technology in which he demonstrated simultaneously the connectivity of nerve fibres and the identity of the neurotransmitters. He pursued neurophysiology under Rodolfo Llinas, where he unraveled the circuitry of the vestibulocerebellum underlying eye movement control and showed that this part of the brain generates predictions required for motor learning. In addition, he discovered the dendritic lamellar body. Transitioning to molecular biology with Frank Grosveld, he identified genes like CYLN2 linked to Williams Syndrome. Founding the Department of Neuroscience in 1998, which earned numerous awards, grants, and fellowships. Noteworthy accolades include the Beatrix Award, ERC-Adv grant, and Royal Dutch Academy of Arts & Sciences membership. He co-directed the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, initiated a cerebellar cognition group, and pioneered transformative programs. With commercial ventures like Neurasmus BV and BlinkLab, his numerous papers and citations delved into diverse neuroscience disciplines.

This method could provide a solution for blind and visually impaired patients. It is the only possible solution for patients in whom the connection between eye and brain is lost so that a prosthesis in the eye is not an option.\n\nI will first give an overview of the functioning of the visual cortex, which has low level areas for the analysis of simple visual features and higher areas for the analysis for more complex properties such as object category and face recognition. I will then discuss the mechanisms that determine whether a visual stimulus will reach consciousness or not. It is well established that the electrical stimulation of electrodes in the visual brain leads to artificial percepts called “phosphenes”. This method also works in patients who have been blind for decades. The goal of our own research is to bring a prosthesis for the visual brain closer. We implanted 1000 electrodes in the visual cortex to generate complex visual patterns. We demonstrated that this stimulation leads to interpretable images, in the same way that pixels form recognizable patterns on a screen. These new neurotechnological developments take important steps in the direction of prostheses that can restore a rudimantary form of vision.\n\n—\n\nPieter R. Roelfsema received his MD degree in 1991 and his PhD degree in 1995. He moved to the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience in Amsterdam in 2002 and became director in 2007.

Roelfsema studies visual perception, plasticity, memory and consciousness in the visual system of experimental animals, humans, and with neural networks. His main question is how neurons in different brain areas work together during seeing and thinking. Roelfsema studies how networks of neurons work together to perceive and solve cognitive tasks and how they configure themselves during learning. He develops the neurotechnology for high-bandwidth visual prostheses for blind people, aiming to restore a rudimentary form of sight. Roelfsema coordinates the Dutch neurotechnology initiative NeuroTech-NL. In 2019 he co-founded the start-up company Phosphoenix that aims to develop a visual brain prosthesis.\n\nMichael Wenzel\n\nGaute Einevoll\n\nMeasurements of electric potentials from neural activity have played a key role in neuroscience for almost a century. Simulations of neural activity is an important tool for understanding such measurements and to make a quantitative link between what the neural network is doing and what is measured. Volume conductor (VC) theory is used to compute extracellular electric potentials such as extracellular spikes, MUA, LFP, ECoG and EEG surrounding neurons, and also magnetic signals such as MEG. In the lecture, the foundations of VC theory is outlined. Furthermore, examples are provided of how the theory is applied to compute spikes, LFP- EEG- and MEG signals generated by neurons and neuronal populations.\n\n—\n\nGaute Einevoll is a professor of physics at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and the University of Oslo working on brain physics, in particular, physics-type modelling of nerve cells, networks of nerve cells, brain tissue and brain signals. He is participating in the large-scale EU Human Brain Project started in 2013 and scheduled to end in 2023\n\nPatrick Ruther\n\nState-of-the-art stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) probes are realized using precision machining of cylindrical electrodes lined up to electrode arrays of up to 18 recording and stimulation sites. These probes enable the integration of only a few micro-contacts to record single unit activity. The lecture presents different approaches to realize depth probes using micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technologies based on flexible polymeric substrates. These technologies allow on the one hand cylindrical SEEG probes with up to 128 channels distributed along a cylinder with a diameter of 800 µm or highly flexible probes with unprecedented lengths of up to 35 cm targeting deep brain areas. The lecture will discuss the applied technologies and their respective limitations as well as requests for future systems optimizations.\n\n—\n\nPatrick Ruther received the Diploma degree in physics and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering in 1993 and 1996, respectively.

Integrating multi-channel electrical recordings with optical techniques can reveal dynamics invisible to standard, single-modality approaches. Fast dynamics recorded electrically can be related to simultaneously acquired optical signals from specified populations. We have developed flexible multi-electrode arrays that are chronically stable, permitting months long measurements of single units and local field potentials in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus of awake, behaving mice. We have combined chronic, multi-site electrophysiology with optical methods such as wide-field or 2-photon imaging, and fiber photometry cortex. We find diverse state-dependent patterns of coupling between concurrently acquired hippocampal and thalamic spiking activity and calcium dynamics in local circuits and across dorsal cortex. The combined application of electrical and optical methodologies provides a powerful tool with which to monitor and perturb brain-wide activity patterns. We believe the refinement of combined approaches will continue to reveal previously inaccessible and under-appreciated aspects of coordinated dynamics in the brain.\n\n—\n\nChristopher Lewis earned a BSc in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a second degree in Philosophy, Neuroscience and Psychology from Washington University, USA. During his studies he worked on vision and guidance systems for mobile robots in the Media and Machines group of Professor Robert Pless. Before pursuing graduate studies, he worked for some years as an engineer and software consultant in clinical and industrial settings. During his doctoral studies, he worked with a wide range of techniques and model organisms, including fMRI of clinical and non-clinical human cohorts, as well as large-scale electrophysiology and optogenetics in primates, cats, and rodents to investigate the effects of intrinsic brain activity on sensory coding and learning. He received his PhD in Neuroscience from Radboud University based on work performed at the Institute for Advanced Biomedical Technology in Chieti, Italy and the Ernst Strungmann Institute in Frankfurt, Germany. He is currently a staff scientist in the Helmchen lab at the Brain Research Institute, University of Zurich where he works with a small group developing novel electrode arrays to combine multi-channel electrophysiology with diverse optical methods. He is interested in understanding the brain-wide dynamics underlying perception and learning.\n\nArtificial Awareness: moving from theoretical possibility towards empirical actuality\n\nMichele Farisco\n\nTo make progress in the discussions about the theoretical possibility, logical coherence, conceptual plausibility, technical feasibility and empirical realism of artificial awareness, it is necessary to start from a preliminary theoretical reflection, which includes the clarification of the relevant terms as well as of the logical, theoretical and empirical conditions for artificial awareness to arise. In this talk I first sketch a conceptual analysis of key terms from consciousness research (including how the concept of awareness relates to the concept of consciousness) to then focus on the multidimensionality of consciousness and on the concept of consciousness profiles, introducing a relevant taxonomy. Against this background, I analyse the theoretical possibility of artificial awareness and reflect about how to identify (and possibly quantify) the dimensions composing a particular profile, arguing for the need of developing empirical, notably ecological indicators of consciousness in the case of artificial systems.\n\n—\n\nHuman Brain Project and the EIC Pathfinder CAVAA project.

To achieve this, in this project we will use physiological sensors to obtain different signals (e.g., EEG, heart rate, electrodermal activity) and analyze them online to extract meaningful metrics about the user’s psychophysiological state. Then, we will use these metrics in real-time to adapt different parameters of a generative audiovisual artwork. The participants undertaking this project should have experience or interest in physiological signal processing and audiovisual arts (ideally, generative). Although the focus of this project is artistic, the technologies and methods employed can also be employed in other domains involving systems that dynamically adapt to their users.\n\nAdvancing Epilepsy Surgery: Integrating Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) for presurgical evaluation and quantitative analysis\n\nVadym Gnatkovsky\n\nSEEG, a minimally invasive procedure involving the placement of depth electrodes within the brain, offers a platform for long-term monitoring and recording of epileptic activity. This provides crucial insights into the epileptogenic zone, facilitating accurate localization and characterization of the brain regions responsible for seizures. By accurately identifying the epileptogenic zone and preserving critical brain functions, patients experience improved outcomes and a reduced risk of postoperative deficits. The quantitative aspect of SEEG analysis adds a layer of sophistication to the evaluation process. Various quantitative techniques, including spike detection, functional mapping, source localization, and network analysis, collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the complex neural dynamics underlying epileptogenic network. This lecture will expound upon several of these quantitative approaches.\n\n—\n\nVadym Gnatkovsky is a Senior Researcher at the Department of Epileptology, University Hospital Bonn, Germany.\n\nHe studied Medicine from 1992 to 1999 at the Odessa State Medical University, Ukraine.

Moreover, these waveforms need to be applied in a smart way, based on feedback, and in a closed-loop fashion. This requires sensing technology, not only for reading the electro-chemical signaling of the brain itself but also of other physiological parameters. Additionally, this feedback needs to be self-learning so it can learn to recognize the (personal) brain activity and connectivity characteristics that characterize a symptom and the intensity of a symptom. It then selects an optimal stimulation design to normalize the symptom by increasing or decreasing connectivity to change the network structure.\n\nIn this DCBT Summer School lecture I will address the technological aspects of how these ‘bioelectronic medicines’ can do this, what they will look like, and which future developments are needed to make them a reality. In particular, we will look into the network organization of the brain, power-efficient brain-like neuromodulation, flexible implant technology, and new modalities to interact with our electro-chemical mainframe, so that we can truly feel better.\n\n—\n\nWouter Serdijn is a professor of bioelectronics, the head of the Section Bioelectronics of Delft University of Technology and as Medical-Delta professor also affiliated with the Neuroscience Department of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

Nutritional needs, such as hunger and thirst, ought to be balanced and weighed against competing needs like mating and voluntary exercise.Despite a long- known crucial role of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the reward system in the regulation of innate behaviours, the neuronal mechanisms enabling state-dependent representation and orchestration of multiple innate drives are not yet understood. Using optogenetics, chemogenetics, deep-brain calcium imaging and electrophysiology in freely behaving mice, we investigated functions of neuronal populations in LH and other subcortical brain regions in feeding and social interaction. We identified neuronal populations and circuits, which act in a complementary manner to enable the flexible fulfillment of multiple essential needs\n\n—\n\nProf. Tatiana Korotkova studied biology with a focus on human and animal physiology in Lomonosov Moscow State University.

Place cells – the principal cell of the hippocampus – represent information about an animal’s spatial location. Yet, during sleep and rest, place cells spontaneously recapitulate (‘replay’) past trajectories. Replay has been hypothesised to serve a variety of functions in memory. In my talk, I will describe recent work I carried out, which showed replay may support a dual function: underpinning both spatial planning as well as the consolidation of new memories. Namely, we found during rest periods, place and grid cells from the deep medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC, the principal cortical output region of the hippocampus) replayed coherently. Importantly, putative dMEC replay lagged place cell replay by ~11ms; suggesting the replay coordination may reflect consolidation. Moreover, in a separate study, we found replay occurring just before movement to or upon arrival at a reward site preferentially depicted locations and trajectories consistent with the animals’ current task demands; perhaps indicative of spatial planning. However, we also found replay could dynamically ‘switch’ between a planning and consolidation mode in relation to engagement with task demands, and we found planning-like replay predicted the accuracy of imminent spatial decision. Finally, I will discuss unpublished work showing hippocampal-dMEC synchronisation in the theta-band may underlie hippocampal-dMEC replay coordination and ongoing work where we employ an ontogenetic approach to elucidating the neural circuit mechanisms of spatial memory.\n\n—–\n\nDr. Hauður Freyja Ólafsdóttir received her PhD in Neuroscience from University College London (UK) in 2014 under the supervision of Prof. Hugo Spiers. Her thesis focused on the role of hippocampal place cell activity during sleep and wakefulness in spatial navigation. During her postdoc, in Dr. Caswell Barry’s (UCL) lab, she studied the contribution of hippocampal-cortical communication during different behavioral states to memory consolidation and spatial planning. In 2018 she received a Donders Mohrmann fellowship to start her own lab at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour (Radboud University, the Netherlands). The primary research objectives of her lab are to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying episodic and spatial memory, in development and adulthood, using state-of-the-art electrophysiological and imaging techniques.\n\nIntroduction to phase-amplitude coupling\n\nGuido Nolte\n\nThis lecture covers mathematical concepts of coupling measures to estimate functional relations between neuronal oscillations partly within but mostly across different frequencies.\n\n1. In the first part, I will give a very basic and largely qualitative introduction of fundamental measures to estimate the coupling of phases of oscillations at a specified frequency, with the most popular measures being the phase locking value (PLV) and coherence. I will also discuss the problem of volume conduction, meaning that functional relations can also be an artifact of signal mixing in sensor space, and how this can be addressed using e.g. the imaginary part of coherence.\n\n2. In the main part of this lecture, I will discuss cross-frequency coupling and here basically phase-amplitude coupling. Several rather intuitive measures of phase-amplitude will be introduced. The main focus will then be on the relations between these coupling measures and bicoherence. Essentially a measure of coupling between phases at three different frequencies, which is a (normalized) third order statistical moment in the Fourier domain and which is analogous to coherence being a normalized second order statistical moment. It will be argued that the study of such relations is helpful to understand and optimize parameter setting for phase-amplitude coupling.\n\n—–\n\nDr. Guido Nolte studied physics and made his PhD in 1995 at the University of Oldenburg/Germany.

On one side, transient brain rhythms are detected in EEG/MEG signals. On the other, fMRI reveals slow and spatiotemporally organized signal fluctuations. Using mathematical models of coupled oscillators, I will show how the network system can engage in a critical regime where intermittent cluster synchronization can generate signals sharing qualitative and quantitative features of human brain activity. I will present phenomenological insights obtained from models of coupled oscillators in the brain’s Connectome structure. Insights into general integrative processes of brain function will be discussed.\n\n—–\n\nDr. Joana Cabral holds a PhD in Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience and a MSc+BSc in Biomedical Engineering, currently working as Assistant Researcher at the Life and Health Sciences Research Institute of the University of Minho in Portugal.

Her main interest is to investigate the fundamental principles underlying brain function. In other words, Joana is curious about the most primitive biophysical mechanisms at the genesis of coordinated brain activity, ultimately leading to our thoughts and actions. In her research, she tests hypothetical mechanistic scenarios using analytical and numerical methods to investigate fundamental brain mechanisms.\n\nBrain simulations: from neural dynamics to cognitive functions\n\nJorge Mejias\n\nThe use of mathematical and computational models to study the brain has experienced a sharp rise in recent years as it constitutes a topic of interest, not only for neuroscience but for related disciplines like complex systems, nonlinear physics, psychology, and artificial intelligence. While many models have traditionally focused on ‘microscopic’ neural circuits (up to tens of thousands of neurons), novel data on detailed brain connectomes for human and no-human animals is facilitating the development of computational models of large-scale brain networks. In this lecture, I will cover recent work on large-scale brain modeling, and how it is used to understand the dynamics of neural activity observed in vivo and the perceptual and cognitive functions associated with such dynamics. In the first part, I will show how brain models are able to disprove predictions from local or microscopic computational models whose solutions do not hold then the large-scale recurrent connectivity of the brain is taken into account. A paradigmatical example is the propagation of sensory signals, a process traditionally studied with simplistic feedforward networks and which becomes dynamically unstable when real brain connectomes are considered. Proper solutions to this problem involve a strong balance between excitation and inhibition in brain networks. In the second part, I will show how this model can be extended to incorporate naturalistic neural oscillations, in an example of multiscale brain modeling. By constraining each level with neuroanatomical data and testing its dynamics with electrophysiological data, the multiscale model is able to reproduce a wide range of experimental observations across different spatial and temporal dynamics, and uncovering the emergence of functional hierarchical structures. Finally, in the third part, I will cover brain models which, besides realistic neural dynamics, can account for cognitive brain functions. In particular, I will introduce a data-constrained large-scale brain model able to explain the emergence of working memory –a particular type of short-term memory process in neural circuits –as a phenomenon distributed across large brain regions, in agreement with recent experimental evidence. This constitutes a new computational framework in which a large-scale model not only describes brain activity but also incorporates brain operations and function.\n\n—–\n\nDr. Jorge Mejias is an assistant professor and head of the Computational Neuroscience Lab at the Cognitive and Systems Neuroscience Group at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

Heuristic arguments have favored a certain “E/I balance” to be important for normal brain function and “E/I imbalance” is thought to characterize many neurological and psychiatric disorders. The concept of E/I balance, however, is not uniquely defined at the mechanistic level because of many contributing factors, such as the size, number, and cellular distribution of synapses, the decay time of synaptic currents, and network topology. Here, we explain a definition of E/I balance that is inspired by computational modeling of critical brain dynamics. In this framework, E/I balance is an emergent network property—a functional state characterized by high spatio-temporal complexity emerging in neuronal networks balancing between order and disorder. The definition enables measuring an “E/I ratio” at the network level, and we show its utility for understanding basic principles of information processing in neuronal networks and for studying brain disorders in which E/I balance may be disrupted.\n\n—–\n\nDr. Klaus Linkenkaer-Hansen is Associate Professor in the Department of Integrative Neurophysiology at Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research (CNCR) at VU Amsterdam.

While these procedures nowadays have been replaced by more reversible neurostimulation methods, most therapies for brain disorders are still based on trial-and-error, and effective mechanisms remain unknown. Using computational modeling can help us provide insight into neuronal network processes and interactions underlying normal and abnormal behaviour, as well as the mechanisms of therapeutic methods. While the difficulty in modeling is determining how much complexity needs to be included to simulate the aspects we are interested in as realistically as possible, it allows us to easily test new stimulation paradigms and stimulation targets. However, validation is essential for computational models to become useful tools for research purposes and clinical applications. In this presentation, two types of computational modeling will be presented and discussed in relation to experimental or clinical data: 1) 3D volume conduction modeling to study the local stimulation effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and motor cortex stimulation (MCS) in Parkinson’s disease; 2) neuronal network modeling, at a microscopic (cellular) and macroscopic (system) level, to study the behaviour of (part of) the basal ganglia-thalamocortical network under normal and Parkinsonian conditions and the effect of DBS.\n\n—–\n\nDr. Ciska Heida is an Associate Professor in the Biomedical Signals & Systems group at the University of Twente, The Netherlands.

One of the cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease is a low-frequency (4-6 Hz) resting tremor. In the past, several studies have pointed toward the involvement of two cerebral circuits in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease resting tremor: basal ganglia and a cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit (consisting of cerebellum, thalamus and motor cortex). The exact circuit-level architecture of causal interactions between both circuits has long remained unclear, which has been a topic for our research over the last couple of years. In this presentation, we will talk about how we used functional MRI together with computational modelling (i.e. Dynamic Causal Modelling) to study the cerebral network of Parkinson’s disease resting tremor. We will focus on tremor-related cerebral activity and how different cerebral regions influence each other, i.e., how they are effectively connected. We propose the dimmer-switch hypothesis where the basal ganglia initiate a tremor episode, and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit produces tremor amplitude. Next, we will discuss how this system-level framework has formed the basis to study several clinical characteristics of Parkinson’s disease tremor, such as the influence of dopaminergic medication and cognitive stress. Finally, we will discuss how this knowledge can be used to improve the therapy of Parkinson’s disease tremor.\n\n—–\n\nDr. Michiel Dirkx is a post-doctoral researcher at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging and a neurologist in training at the Radboud University Medical Centre.
