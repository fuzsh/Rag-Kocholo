        "text": "Skills Gaps: A Review of Underlying Concepts\n\nMarch 31, 2022\n\nand Evidence\n\nSarah A. Donovan\n\nEmployer reports of job vacancies left unfilled due to a lack of adequately skilled applicants have\n\nSpecialist in Labor Policy\n\nspanned U.S. industries for decades, and have often raised concerns among some Members of\n\nCongress about the broader economic implications of a potential mismatch between skills\n\nAdam Stoll\n\npossessed by workers and those sought by employers. Some concerns center on the notion that\n\nActg Deputy Assistant\n\ncertain skillsâoften higher-level or mid-level skillsâthat are sought by employers are not\n\nDirector and Specialist\n\npossessed by enough workers, impeding employersâ ability to find the capacities they need to\n\noperate, innovate, expand, and compete, and this ultimately slows economic growth. Other\n\nconcerns relate to the plight of workers and the notion that mismatches between workersâ skills\n\nDavid H. Bradley\n\nand the current or future demands of work may be a primary driver of unemployment and may\n\nSpecialist in Labor\n\nrender the skillsets possessed by groups of workers obsolete.\n\nEconomics\n\nDisagreement exists about the pervasiveness of skills misalignments, and about their scale and\n\nBenjamin Collins\n\nhow concentrated they are. This is called into question by suggestions that other factorsâsuch as\n\nAnalyst in Labor Policy\n\nwage levels and working conditionsâmay be partially or largely responsible for unfilled\n\npositions, unemployment, or other outcomes that are sometimes attributed to skills gaps and cited\n\nas evidence of their existence.\n\nNonetheless, there is little doubt that work demands regularly evolve throughout many occupations and industries creating, at\n\nleast on some scale, mismatches between what jobs require and the readiness of workers to perform those tasks. Large\n\nstructural changes accompanying new technologies have had a substantial effect on the types of jobs available and on the\n\nwork performed in industries across the economy during certain periods. Current conversations around automation, artificial\n\nintelligence, and technological change more generally indicate that such structural changesâand the potential for large-scale\n\nskills gapsâmay be on the horizon in the coming years.\n\nCentral to skills gap debates are what have become perennial questions surrounding (1) the mix of education and training\n\nneeded to equip workers with the skills and knowledge required for work, and (2) who should provide it, finance it, and\n\ndetermine its content and help workers navigate what is needed. These issues are not newâworker skills have always\n\nmattered to production, and U.S. workers and employers have long had to adapt to the changing demands of work. But\n\nidentifying the mix of general and specific skills and knowledge needed in the workforce, and the appropriate roles for\n\ngovernment, employers, and workers in developing them, can be complex.\n\nSeveral separate laws authorize federal policies and programs aiming to improve the preparedness of the U.S. workforce,\n\nemploying many different strategies. Some place emphasis on the development of a foundation of transferrable knowledge\n\nand skills. Others provide support for postsecondary educational pursuits and lifelong learning, allowing existing or\n\nprospective workers to select the particular types of education or training in which to invest. Other federal policies support\n\nspecific types of training in areas where a shortage of skilled workers exists (e.g., cybersecurity, nursing). Still others\n\npromote skill development by encouraging employer-provided training. Relatedly, there are many federal policies that are not\n\nfocused on skill development, which can also affect whether sufficient numbers of workers holding skills that meet the needs\n\nof employers are available (e.g., policies that address factors that may inhibit labor force participation among skilled workers\n\nsuch as availability of child care, and policies in areas such as immigration that affect the size and composition of the labor\n\nforce).\n\nThis report is a response to congressional requests for the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to identify, synthesize, and\n\nexplain the core components of the skills gap discourse and, to the extent possible, explore and clarify evidence on the\n\nexistence of skills gaps. The report acknowledges that the skills gap label is often applied to several different circumstances\n\nand conditions, and it offers a discussion of the varied meanings associated with the term. The report attempts to shed light\n\non the nature and existence of various types of skills misalignments and explores their potential policy implications.\n\nThe report presents a limited review of indicators that are commonly cited as evidence of the existence of skill\n\nmisalignments. These include broad indicators examining job openings and hires, employer wage responses to unfilled jobs,\n\neducational credentials possessed in relation to those required, and the adequacy of measurable foundational skills among\n\ncurrent (and future) workers. The report notes that these indicators, which measure trends of relevance to the skills gap\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\ndebate, do not clearly suggest that widespread misalignments exist. At the same time, this review cannot rule out\n\nmisalignments as a possibility.\n\nThe report notes as well that available existing broad indicators have limitations. For instance, not everything of interest can\n\ncurrently be measured. Notably lacking are accepted measures that examine the adequacy of the supply of in-demand\n\ncapacities such as soft skills. Further, some indicators may be imprecise. As an example, some rely on educational credentials\n\nas a proxy measure for skills possessed by workers or required for work, and there is debate about whether this may be an\n\nimperfect proxy for skill levels possessed and actually required. Additionally, some indicators are generated through\n\nimperfect research. Some, for example, come from employer and industry surveys, which are seemingly well positioned to\n\nshed light on imbalances between supply and demand for skills, but these surveys often do not meet standards for quality\n\nresearch, and they may lack impartiality.\n\nWith regard to a more narrow examination of skill shortages affecting particular occupations or fields in which there is an\n\nundersupply of credentialed workers, or in which work demands may be changing rapidly, the report notes there is more\n\nagreement about the existence of some misalignments. The report highlights illustrative examples of fields in which evidence\n\npoints to shortages. Also discussed is the complexity associated with isolating the causes when occupations, employers, and\n\nregions face difficulty in filling positions. That is, it is difficult to attribute hiring challenges to a skills shortage when there\n\nare often many other plausible explanations for hiring challenges.\n\nThroughout the report, there is discussion of enduring challenges that complicate policymaking in this arena. One is that the\n\nskills gap label encompasses a series of somewhat separate (but interrelated) issues, and it is not clear that there is a common\n\nproblem definition or consensus about what may need to be addressed. Further, it can be hard to reach agreement about\n\nrespective responsibilities of workers, employers, and government in ensuring the acquisition of skills. While there are\n\nnumerous federal investments promoting a skilled workforce, there is no clear agreement about whether, or the extent to\n\nwhich, the different skills-related challenges being addressed by federal policies need to be thought of as a continuum and\n\naddressed in an interconnected manner.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\nlink to page 6 link to page 7 link to page 8 link to page 8 link to page 9 link to page 11 link to page 11 link to page 12 link to page 13 link to page 16 link to page 17 link to page 19 link to page 20 link to page 21 link to page 22 link to page 23 link to page 24 link to page 25 link to page 27 link to page 27 link to page 27 link to page 28 link to page 28 link to page 29 link to page 30 link to page 30 link to page 31 link to page 32 link to page 33 link to page 35 link to page 36 link to page 37 link to page 38 link to page 40 link to page 40 link to page 43 link to page 44 link to page 14 link to page 15 link to page 16 Skills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction ..................................................................................................................................... 1\n\nAbout This Report ..................................................................................................................... 2\n\nDefining Terms .......................................................................................................................... 3\n\nClarifying the Meaning of Gaps ......................................................................................... 3\n\nClarifying the Meaning of Skills ......................................................................................... 4\n\nWhat Spurs Debates About Skills Gaps?

They have been\n\nmentioned in congressional deliberations for many years, and with considerable frequency in the\n\npast decade. Employer reports of job vacancies left unfilled due to a lack of adequately skilled\n\napplicants have spanned U.S. industries, and have often raised concerns among some Members of\n\nCongress about the broader economic implications of a potential mismatch between skills\n\npossessed by workers and those sought by employers.1\n\nConcerns about skills gaps also garner considerable media attention, with some coverage focused\n\non the types of skills being sought by employers and on the economic consequences that may\n\nstem from a lack of adequately skilled workers. Other coverage raises questions about whether\n\nthe supply of skilled workers is actually inadequate.2\n\nAcademic research on skills gap-related topics is robust as well, and focuses on several issues.\n\nSome research examines the nature and existence of skill misalignments. Other research points to\n\na variety of factors leading to lingering vacancies reported by employers, suggesting that reducing\n\nskills mismatches may require policy approaches that include but also extend beyond support for\n\nskills investment. Relevant factors identified in research include rapid changes in employer needs\n\nor consumer demand, rapid technological change affecting the nature of work, geographical\n\nmismatches in the supply of workers with in-demand skills and the locations of available jobs,\n\nfluctuations in the size of the labor force, and the cost to employers of investing in workersâ skills\n\nespecially in tight labor markets where returns on those investments are uncertain.3\n\n1 For instance, in recent years the following congressional hearings before an array of congressional committees have\n\nfocused on themes related to skills mismatches and gaps: House Committee on Small Business, Subcommittee on\n\nInnovation and Workforce Development, Mind the âSkillsâ Gap: Apprenticeships and Training Programs, June 4,\n\n2019; House Committee on Small Business Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax, and Capital Access, Shrinking\n\nthe Skills Gap: Solutions to the Small Business Workforce Shortage, June 14, 2018; House Committee on Education\n\nand the Workforce, Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Development, Closing the Skills Gap: Private\n\nSector Solutions for Americaâs Workforce, May 19, 2018; House Ways and Means Committee, Jobs and Opportunity:\n\nLocal Perspectives on the Jobs Gap, April 12, 2018; Joint Economic Committee, A Record Six Million U.S. Job\n\nVacancies: Reasons and Remedies, July 12, 2017; Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation,\n\nClosing the Skills Gap and Boosting U.S. Competitiveness, June 29, 2017; Senate Committee on Small Business and\n\nEntrepreneurship, Bridging the Skills Gap: How the STEM Education Pipeline Can Develop a High-Skilled American\n\nWorkforce for Small Business, May 22, 2013; Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation,\n\nSubcommittee on Innovation and Export Promotion, Promoting American Competitiveness: Filling Jobs Today and\n\nTraining Workers for Tomorrow, April 17, 2012; and Joint Economic Committee, The Road to Economic Recovery:\n\nProspects for Jobs and Growth, February 6, 2010. Congressional discussions about the inability of employers to find\n\nqualified workers date back to at least the 1960s. For example, concerns about the lack of skilled workers were raised\n\nduring hearings of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare on the Manpower Development and Training\n\nAct of 1962 and on the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n\n2 Media coverage devoted to skills gaps includes Minaya Ezequiel, âCompanies Seek to Fill Skills Gap by Retraining\n\nTheir Own Workers; a tight labor market amplifies need to develop skills internally,â The Wall Street Journal online,\n\nMarch 8, 2019; Matt OâBrien, âThe skills gap is fixed, because there was no skills gap,â The Washington Post, January\n\n14, 2019; Peter Murphy, âTax Incentives Needed To Close Workplace Skills Gap,â Investorâs Business Daily,\n\nSeptember 7, 2018; Douglas Belkin, âMore Companies Teach Workers What Colleges Donât: Amid skills gap\n\ncompanies focus less on four-year degrees and more on skills that workers have or can learn,â The Wall Street Journal\n\nonline, March 22, 2018; and Noam Scheiber, âPresidentâs Plan to Expand Apprenticeships Rekindles âSkills Gapâ\n\nDebate,â The New York Times, June 16, 2017.\n\n3 For materials that frame various aspects of the skills gap debate, see Peter Cappelli, Why Good People Canât Get\n\nJobs: The Skills Gap and What Companies Can Do About It, Wharton Digital Press, 2012; Andrew Weaver, The Myth\n\nof the Skills Gap, MIT Technology Review, August 25, 2017; Dan Restuccia et al., Different Skills, Different Gaps,\n\nMeasuring and Closing the Skills Gap, Burning Glass Technologies Report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n1\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nThe federal government has had a longstanding role in supporting the development of work-\n\nrelated skills using varied policy approaches. Federal policies aiming to improve the preparedness\n\nof the U.S. workforce are authorized through several federal laws, and address what can be\n\nviewed as a series of inter-related issues. Some place emphasis on the development of a strong\n\nfoundation of transferrable knowledge and skills. Others provide support for postsecondary\n\neducational pursuits and lifelong learning, allowing existing or prospective workers to select the\n\nparticular types of education or training in which to invest. Other federal policies support specific\n\ntypes of training in areas where a shortage of skilled workers exists (e.g., cybersecurity, nursing).\n\nStill others promote skill development by encouraging employer-provided training.4 Relatedly,\n\nthere are many federal policies that are not focused on skill development that can also affect\n\nwhether sufficient numbers of workers holding skills that meet the needs of employers are\n\navailable (e.g., policies that address factors that may inhibit labor force participation among\n\nskilled workers such as availability of child care, and policies in areas such as immigration that\n\naffect the size and composition of the labor force).\n\nAbout This Report\n\nThis report is a response to congressional requests for the Congressional Research Service (CRS)\n\nto identify, synthesize, and explain the core components of the skills gap discourse and, to the\n\nextent possible, explore and clarify evidence on the existence of skills gaps. The report\n\nacknowledges that the skills gap label is often applied to several different circumstances and\n\nconditions and explores the varied meanings associated with the term.\n\nThe report also attempts to shed light on the nature and existence of varied types of skills\n\nmisalignments and explores their potential policy implications. It opens with operational\n\ndefinitions for three termsâskills mismatch, skills gaps, and skill shortagesâto help clarify some\n\nof the key underlying issues and concepts that are prevalent in the skills gap discourse, and\n\nprovides a framework for discussing them more precisely. It then offers an overview of the\n\nvarious issues and explanations that commonly surface in the skills gap debate. The next section\n\nof the report examines commonly cited evidence of skills mismatches, gaps, and shortages, noting\n\nthe strengths and limitations of key sources. Although the section notes the likelihood of\n\nmismatches, gaps, and shortages in some instances and comments on some expectations for\n\nfuture trends, it does not attempt to draw firm conclusions from the reviewed sources about their\n\npresence in the current economy. The report then examines potential employer responses to skills\n\nmisalignments, and closes with a discussion of federal policies designed to deal with existing or\n\nFoundation, March 2018; James Bessen, Employers Arenât Just WhiningâThe Skills Gap Is Real, Harvard Business\n\nReview, August 2014; Andrew Weaver and Paul Osterman, Skill Demands and Mismatch in U.S. Manufacturing, ILR\n\nReview 70(02), March 2017, pp. 275-307; Seamus McGuinness, Konstantinos Pouliakas, and Paul Redmond, Skills\n\nMismatch: Concepts, Measurement and Policy Approaches, Journal of Economic Surveys, Vol. 32, 2018, pp. 985-\n\n1015; Anthony Carnevale, Nicole Smith, and Jeff Stroehl, Help Wanted: Projections of Job and Education\n\nRequirements Through 2018, Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, June 2010; and Lawrence Kahn,\n\nSkill Shortages, Mismatches, and Structural Unemployment a Symposium, ILR Review 68(2), March 2015, pp. 247-\n\n250.\n\n4 For overviews of several of these approaches, see CRS Report R44252, The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity\n\nAct and the One-Stop Delivery System, by David H.

Skinner.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n2\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\npotential misalignments between the skills sought by employers and those possessed by workers.\n\nThis discussion devotes attention to policy approaches focused on investing in skills as well as\n\nother approaches toward addressing misalignments.\n\nAlthough much of the discourse on skills mismatches, gaps, and shortages tends to focus on\n\nemployersâ perspectives and potential economic impacts, such skills misalignments can have\n\nsignificant consequences for workers as well. Just as workers with in-demand skills are well\n\nplaced to find work and bargain over compensation and working conditions, those who do not\n\nhold sought-after skills risk unemployment or poor job matches. Further, changing work demands\n\ncan be costly for workers who to varying degrees pay for education, trainings, and certifications\n\nthat may lose value over time. Similarly, incomplete information about workforce demands can\n\nlead some workers to invest in the wrong types of skills. In response to the task CRS was asked to\n\ntake on, and in line with many prominent policy discussions and available analyses, this report\n\nfocuses on employersâ recruitment challenges and approaches to improve the alignment of skills\n\nheld in the workforce to those sought by employers. While an in-depth analysis of workersâ\n\nchallenges and the impacts of skills misalignment on them are outside the scope of this report,\n\nthey affect individual livelihoods and also have broader social and economic implications.\n\nDefining Terms\n\nAs noted above, varied meanings associated with vocabulary used in skills gap debates is the\n\nsource of confusion. Consequently, a good starting point for an exploration of the skills gap\n\ndiscourse is discussing the different meanings that can be ascribed to skills and gap. These terms\n\nare not always used in a precise manner, and they are often not used in a consistent manner. This\n\nlikely adds to disagreement about skills gaps.\n\nAn effort is made here to clarify meanings for these terms. It is not aiming to construct a\n\ndefinitive set of definitions; rather, it is intended to identify some important conceptual\n\ndistinctions in the conditions being described by various terms and to highlight how terms will be\n\nused henceforth in this report. In the review of the skills gap literature and discourse that\n\ncomprises the majority of this report, several key terms will be used in the manner delineated\n\nbelow.\n\nClarifying the Meaning of Gaps\n\nWhile there is little disagreement about the existence of mismatches between evolving demands\n\nof work and the skills and knowledge possessed by workers, there is substantial disagreement\n\nabout the scale of these mismatches, relating to their depth, breadth, and how concentrated they\n\nare. Some core distinctions related to the scale and nature of misalignments are captured in the\n\ncommonly used terms skills mismatch, skills gaps, and skill shortages.5 They can be\n\nconceptualized as follows:\n\nï· Skills Mismatch: An imbalanceâan over-supply or under-supplyâbetween the\n\ntypes or level of skills available and labor market needs. The term does not\n\nnecessarily imply a certain scale of imbalance.\n\nï· Skills Gap: A shortfall in the aggregate supply of a certain skill or set of skills\n\nbroadly sought by employers (e.g., communication or computational skills).\n\n5 This taxonomy of terms, and the use of the terms in this report, is largely based on work presented in Peter H.\n\nCappelli, ILR Review, 68(2), March 2015, Skill Gaps, Skill Shortages, and Skill Mismatches: Evidence and Arguments\n\nfor the United States, pp. 251-290.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n3\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nï· Skill Shortages: A shortfall in the supply of specific skills associated with\n\nparticular occupations (e.g., a dearth of workers prepared to work as nurses or\n\nspecial education teachers).\n\nIn this report, the term skills mismatch is the most broad, inclusive, and flexibly used term,\n\nencompassing relatively smaller-scale misalignments between what workers are prepared to do in\n\nrelation to existing work demands as well as larger-scale misalignments. For example, a need for\n\nemployees to become proficient in a new software package that a business adopts for handling\n\nfinancial transactions and tracking inventory or to master new features in an updated version of\n\nExcel might constitute smaller-scale misalignments. Larger-scale misalignments might involve\n\nlarge groups of workers lacking fundamental types of skills (e.g., computational or\n\ncommunication skills) or knowledge.\n\nA mismatch can characterize misalignments going in either direction, not just misalignments\n\nwherein employers cannot find what they are seeking. For instance, it could characterize workers\n\npossessing in-depth skills in areas no longer sought by many employers, or too many individuals\n\ninvesting in education or training in areas in which limited job opportunities exist.\n\nThe term skills gap characterizes a situation in which, on a widespread basis, employers have\n\ndifficulty finding employees possessing adequate levels of skills required for work. This might\n\ninclude critical thinking skills, mathematical or programming skills, or soft skills such as\n\ncommunication or the ability to work effectively in groups. The connotation is that there is a\n\nshortfall of skills that are of fundamental importance to many types of work.\n\nThe term skill shortage is used to depict situations in which employers in particular fields (e.g.,\n\nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics [STEM] fields) are unable to find sufficient\n\nnumbers of workers with the type or level of skill sought to fill available positions. This can\n\nencompass situations in which not enough workers pursue degrees or training in in-demand\n\ndisciplines, work requirements change in a manner calling for more workers with highly\n\nspecialized skills (e.g., advanced manufacturing), or when new fields emerge, like cybersecurity,\n\nrequiring skills and knowledge for which no formal preparatory path previously existed.\n\nClarifying the Meaning of Skills\n\nIn the skills gap discourse, the term skills largely functions as a composite term. It can\n\ninterchangeably refer to knowledge, skills, competencies, and even attributes possessed by\n\nworkers.\n\nThe skills gap discourse is often centered on the adequacy of current or future workersâ\n\nknowledge and skills. There are not universally accepted definitions of these terms.6 There is,\n\nhowever, some consistency in components of descriptions of knowledge and skills forwarded\n\n6 One recent effort attempting to help clarify some of these definitional issues was an interdisciplinary examination\n\nundertaken by the National Academy of Sciences aiming to define the set of key skills embodied in labels such as 21st\n\ncentury skills, new basic skills, deeper learning, and higher order thinking. That work, which focused on aligning lists\n\nof 21st century skills from various sources with research-based taxonomies of cognitive, interpersonal, and\n\nintrapersonal skills, noted that these labels are typically used to include an array of both cognitive and non-cognitive\n\nskills. In other words, labels such as 21st century skills can encompass many different types of skills including âcritical\n\nthinking, problem solving, collaboration, effective communication, motivation, persistence, and learning to learn.â For\n\nmore information on this effort, see National Research Council of the National Academies, Committee on Deeper\n\nLearning and 21st Century Skills, Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the\n\n21st Century, James W. Pellegrino and Margaret L. Hilton, eds., National Academies Press, 2012. (Hereinafter referred\n\nto as Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century).\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n4\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nacross many sources, and it is useful to attempt to identify some of the core elements of each to\n\nhelp facilitate a more precise exploration of what workers may be missing. With that aim in mind,\n\nthe following depictions of knowledge and skills are forwarded:\n\nï· Knowledge can be thought of as having a command of facts, concepts, theories,\n\nand principles, or a theoretical or practical understanding of disciplines, subjects,\n\nprocesses, or technical material; and\n\nï· Skills can be thought of as having the ability to do something, such as perform\n\nmathematical computations, read, write, research, or think critically.7\n\nSometimes groups of skills are labeled or further categorized as being academic skills, cognitive\n\nskills, non-cognitive skills, or technical skills.8 Another type of skills that receives substantial\n\nattention in the skills gap discourse is frequently labeled soft skills, which, depending on the\n\ndefinition, can include interpersonal or people skills, ability to work well as part of a team,\n\ncommunicating well with others, and work ethic.9\n\nMaking matters more complex, knowledge and skills are often categorized as being basic versus\n\nbeing applied.10 These distinctions can be meaningful, as they may suggest where the acquisition\n\nof such skills and knowledge can best occur or should occur. This set of issues often features\n\nprominently in policy debates, as does consideration of the nature of the capacities employers are\n\nseeking that workers may be lacking. For these reasons, it is important to consider that while the\n\nterm skills is often used as a catch-all term, determining what it is depicting can be central to\n\nnavigating the skills gap discourse.\n\nIn this report, the term skills will sometimes be used as a composite term to broadly describe\n\nobserved or theorized imbalances between preparedness and capacity of workers and the demands\n\nof work (e.g., employers report being unable to find the skills they need). The use of skills in this\n\nmanner is consistent with much of the literature. The report takes care to use the terms knowledge\n\nand skills as delineated above when attempting to explore or clarify material pertaining to the\n\nnature of imbalances.\n\n7 While it is helpful to delineate separate characteristics of skills and knowledge, it is also the case that they are\n\nfrequently described as being inter-connected. For instance, one such description is in Education for Life and Work:\n\nDeveloping Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century, p. 23, which presents the view that knowledge that\n\ncan be transferred or applied in new situations can be characterized as 21st century skills. In this construct, the authors\n\nexplain âknowledge includes both content knowledge in a domain and also procedural knowledge of how, why, and\n\nwhen to apply content knowledge.â They refer to this blend of content knowledge and related skills as 21st century\n\ncapacities.\n\n8 For other frequently cited efforts that present taxonomies of skills that include some of these terms see What Work\n\nRequires of Schools: A SCANS Report for America 2000, The Secretaryâs Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills,\n\nU.S. Department of Labor, June 1991, pp.13-15; and An Occupational Information System for the 21st Century: The\n\nDevelopment of O*NET, Peterson et al., Washington D.C., American Psychological Association, 1999.\n\n9 As is discussed throughout this report, employers often identify soft skills prominently among the skills they have\n\ndifficulty finding at a level consistent with expectations. For a discussion of soft skills and many of the definitional and\n\npractical issues schools attempting to help impart them face, see Grover J. Whitehurst, Hard Thinking on Soft Skills,\n\nEvidence Speaks Reports, Vol. 1, #14, Brookings Institution, March 24, 2016. For a more in-depth sense of which\n\nskills constitute soft skills, see skills characterized as interpersonal and intrapersonal in Education for Life and Work:\n\nDeveloping Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century.\n\n10 There is no universally accepted definition of these terms, but basic skills and knowledge might be thought of as\n\nfoundational knowledge and skills such as reading comprehension, writing with clarity and use of appropriate\n\ngrammar, or foundational knowledge of techniques and approaches used in mathematics or science. Whereas applied\n\nskills might include writing in formats or genres emphasized in occupations, or applying knowledge of mathematical\n\nconcepts to particular work-setting problems or projects.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n5\n\nlink to page 37 Skills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nWhat Spurs Debates About Skills Gaps?\n\nIndications of some imbalance between the supply and demand sides of the labor market are\n\ngenerally the impetus for many skills gap debates. Notably, when employers experience difficulty\n\nin filling jobs (i.e., open positions go unfilled for long periods), particularly during periods of\n\nrelatively high unemployment, concerns emerge about the adequacy of available workers.\n\nSimilarly, when employer surveys that are designed to gauge employersâ needs and the suitability\n\nof available workers reveal dissatisfaction with the availability of adequately prepared workers,\n\nconcerns surface about the skill level of the workforce. Projections also play a role in this debate,\n\nas large-scale efforts that attempt to forecast the future educational needs of the workforce (with\n\neducational credentials serving as a proxy measure for skill level) sometimes predict impending\n\nmismatches on a sizable scale.\n\nRival explanations for imbalances between supply and demand in the labor market also abound,\n\nsuggesting the prominence of skills gaps may be overstated. For instance, it is often suggested\n\nthat unfilled vacancies and unemployment may be a function of the wage levels and working\n\nconditions being offered or workersâ lack of access to affordable childcare or eldercare as\n\nopposed to being indicators that adequately skilled workers are unavailable. Broader analyses and\n\nprojections of mismatches between educational credentials required for positions and those\n\npossessed in the workforce are rebutted by suggestions that credentials are an imperfect proxy for\n\nskill demands associated with many types of work and that many positions require educational\n\ncredentials that are not well matched with actual demands of the job. Employer concerns about\n\nthe readiness of available workers are rebutted by suggestions that employers may lack\n\nwillingness to invest in the training and development of workers, preferring instead to onboard\n\nemployees requiring limited scale-up costs.11 This implies employer dissatisfaction with available\n\ncandidates may be a function of employers becoming pickier.\n\nNonetheless, there is little doubt that work demands regularly evolve throughout many\n\noccupations and industries creating, at least on some scale, mismatches between what jobs require\n\nand the readiness of workers to perform those tasks. It is also well documented that large\n\nstructural changes accompanying new technologies have had a large effect on the types of jobs\n\navailable and on the work performed in industries across the economy during certain periods.\n\nCurrent conversations around automation, artificial intelligence, and technological change more\n\ngenerally suggest that such structural changes may be on the horizon in the coming years.12\n\nIs This a New Issue?\n\nThe debate about skill misalignments and the underlying challenges reflected in the debate have\n\nexisted for some time. For frame of reference, in early U.S. history, skill requirements and\n\nsystems to develop them were more transparent and clearly defined. Prior to the industrial\n\n11 Employersâ willingness to invest in training is influenced by many factors, including an employerâs expectations\n\nabout how long the worker will stay with the firm. See the discussion in the âEmployer-Provided Trainingâ section of\n\nthis report.\n\n12 For a variety of perspectives on evolving skill demands in light of technology, artificial intelligence, and automation,\n\nsee Mark Muro, Robert Maxim, and Jacob Whiton, Automation and Artificial Intelligence: How machines are affecting\n\npeople and places, The Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, January 2019; Daron Acemoglu and Pascual\n\nRestrepo, Automation and New Tasks: How Technology Displaces and Reinstates Labor, National Bureau of Economic\n\nResearch Working Paper 25684, March 2019; Carl Frey and Michael Osborne, The future of employment: How\n\nsusceptible are jobs to computerisation, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, Vol. 114: January 2017, pp.\n\n254-280; and David Autor, Why Are There Still So Many Jobs?

Much of what workers needed to learn to perform work was well understood and\n\ntransmitted in a family, in an agrarian setting, or in small-scale craft operations. The likelihood\n\nthat changes to work processes (e.g., through rapid technical innovation) would dramatically\n\naffect workersâ capacity to perform their jobs was comparatively low. The employerâs incentive to\n\ntrain workers thoroughly was relatively high, as was the likelihood of receiving a satisfactory\n\nreturn on that investment.\n\nIn subsequent periods, determining how best to prepare workers for work and who is responsible\n\nfor job preparation has been more complicated. Compounding the challenge is the reality that\n\nwork requirements are often a moving target. Multiple factors have dramatically affected the\n\ntypes of jobs that are available to workers, the requisite skills and knowledge associated with\n\nthose positions, and whether workers can rely on mastering a relatively finite set of skills or need\n\nto evolve continually to keep pace with changing work demands.\n\nSchools have played a central role (i.e., at a minimum, a role in equipping youth with\n\nfoundational skills and knowledge) at the elementary and secondary levels, and increasingly this\n\nhas been the case at the postsecondary level as well. Employer-provided training (formal and\n\ninformal) has also played a key role. Workforce development programs and services have been\n\nemployed, on a targeted basis, to address these issues as well.\n\nThese issues are not newâworker skills have always mattered to production, and U.S. workers\n\nand employers have long had to adapt to the changing demands of work.13 But identifying the mix\n\nof general and specific skills and knowledge needed in the workforce, and the appropriate roles\n\nfor government, employers, and workers in developing them, can be complex.\n\nReview of the Evidence of a Skills Mismatch\n\nThis section of the report examines data and research findings that feature prominently in\n\ndiscussions about the existence of a skills mismatch in the United States, with a particular focus\n\non broad indicators.14 Official data on job openings and hires provide broad indicators of unmet\n\nemployer demand for workers, and can help identify industries that face greater staffing\n\nchallenges. Employersâ viewpoints as collected through industry reports provide further insights,\n\nand comparisons of workersâ educational attainment to employersâ reported educational\n\nrequirements can address the specific question of whether there exists an over- or under-supply of\n\neducated workers in todayâs labor market.\n\nIn general, when broad indicators are examined, the available data do not reveal a clear skills\n\nmismatch in the economy, but they also do not rule one out. For example, in aggregate, the\n\nnumber of workers with a college degree appears to be greater than the number of jobs that\n\nexplicitly require them.15 However, because official data on employersâ educational requirements\n\ngenerally do not identify qualitative characteristics (e.g., the degree holderâs field of study), a\n\n13 For an overview of the types of occupational shifts that have occurred historically, which played a role in changing\n\nwork demands, see Ian Wyatt and Daniel Hecker, Occupational Changes During the 20th Century, Monthly Labor\n\nReview, March 2006.\n\n14 As noted earlier, skills mismatch is a broad and inclusive term that encompasses relatively narrow occupational\n\nmisalignments between workersâ skill sets and existing work demands (i.e., skill shortages, such as a local shortage of\n\nexperienced plumbers), broad-based deficiencies (i.e., skills gaps, such as a widespread shortage of foundational skills)\n\nand other types of misalignments. As a matter of feasibility, broad indicators of mismatches are the focus of this section\n\nof the report. Skills gaps and shortages are examined separately in this report.\n\n15 While the overall number of college graduates and career certificate holders appears to meet or exceed employersâ\n\nneeds, there may yet remain a mismatch when specific postsecondary credentials are considered.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n7\n\nlink to page 14 Skills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nskills mismatch may yet exist in certain industries or occupations. Employer reports and job\n\nopenings data indicate that hiring in some industries is more challenging than in others. Again,\n\nthese sources do not contain enough detail to distinguish job vacancies that remain open because\n\nskills are scarce from those that remain open due to insufficient compensation offers or other\n\nreasons.\n\nJob Openings and Labor Turnover Data\n\nDebate around a prospective skills mismatch is frequently discussed in the context of job\n\nopenings. Notably, official data show that the number of job openings have exceeded job hires in\n\nrecent years, and reveal cross-industry differences in employersâ success filling open vacancies.\n\nThese patterns bolster claims that employers cannot find the workers they need, but do not\n\nnecessarily identify a skills mismatch. That is, while some job vacancies remain open when in-\n\ndemand skills are scarce, persistent job openings can also point to a strong economy, with\n\nemployers adding new positions as they expand production but struggle to fill jobs in the face of\n\nlow unemployment. In short, while job-openings data are important to assessing employersâ\n\nunmet labor needs, additional information is often needed to identify the forces driving hiring\n\nchallenges (e.g., skills deficits, competitive labor markets, or other explanations).\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) is the\n\nprimary data source for job openings and related measures.16 JOLTS data provide important\n\ninformation on job openings, hires, and labor turnover more generally, but they do not provide\n\ninformation on the content of job openings (e.g., skills required, task-content of jobs,\n\ncompensation offered), which limits their usefulness in explaining recent patterns. Figure 1 plots\n\nJOLTS data on the number of hires over the course of a month and the number of jobs open at the\n\nend of a month, and shows that both indicators (hires and openings) tend to rise and fall with\n\neconomic cycles (i.e., they are procyclical). This pattern is intuitive, as businesses tend to\n\nincrease staffing in response to rising consumer demand.17 Job openings levels rose above hires\n\ntemporarily in June and August of 2014 and have been continually above hires from January 2015\n\nto November 2021 (with the exception of May and June 2020).18 This may indicate greater\n\nrecruitment challenges (e.g., due to a competitive labor market or to a skills mismatch). It could\n\nalso reflect lower job posting costs, an increased willingness among employers to hold positions\n\nopen for longer periods, or that workers are more selective about jobs.\n\n16 The BLS JOLTS collects information on job openings and hires, as well as job separations, and provides insights into\n\njob turnover in the U.S. labor market on a monthly basis. Data and program information is at https://www.bls.gov/jlt/.\n\n17 A business may also have a greater need to fill openings created by employees who have left the firm. Voluntary\n\nseparations (quits) rise during expansions when alternative job opportunities are more abundant.\n\n18 Both job openings and hires fell in March and April 2020, with some rebound starting in May. The particularly large\n\nnumbers of hires in May and June 2020 likely reflect the rehiring of workers who were on temporary layoffs.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n8\n\nlink to page 15\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nFigure 1.

Hires indicate the number of persons hired over the entire reference month. JOLTS data for November\n\n2021 are preliminary.\n\nAlso relevant to employerâs staffing challenges, JOLTS data reveal a notable and fairly steady\n\nrate of worker movement between jobs. Figure 2 shows that the churn rateâdefined here as the\n\ntotal number of job hires and separations in a given month as a share of employmentâis\n\nprocyclical and has fluctuated between about 6% and 9% of employment for the last 20 years.19\n\nThis means that while employers operate in a labor market characterized by a lot of worker\n\nmovement (which affects staffing even when workers hold in-demand skills), in aggregate there\n\nhas not been a marked long-term change in the rate of worker movements in recent decades.20\n\n19 Additional discussion of the churn rate used in this section is in BLS, âWhich industries need workers? Exploring\n\ndifferences in labor market activity,â Monthly Labor Review, January 2016, at https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/\n\narticle/which-industries-need-workers-exploring-differences-in-labor-market-activity.htm.\n\n20 The sharp increase in the churn rate during the 2020 recession reflects the swift and sizeable degree of job loss early\n\non in the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent recall of workers from temporary layoffs.

Worker Churn Rate\n\nDecember 2000 through November 2021, in thousands\n\nSource: Figure created by CRS using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Job Openings and Labor\n\nTurnover Survey (JOLTS) and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER; recessionary periods).\n\nNotes: The worker churn rate is the total number of job hires and separations in a given month as a share of\n\nemployment. Data for November 2021 are preliminary.\n\nAnalysis at the industry level suggests that some employers face greater staffing challenges than\n\nothers. This is shown in Figure 3, which plots the fill rateâthe number of hires in a given month\n\nas a percentage of the number of job openings at the end of the monthâfor the private sector as a\n\nwhole and two industries selected to show the range of rates (the retail sales sector and the health\n\ncare and social assistance sector). Fill rates below 100% indicate that job openings at the end of\n\nthe month exceeded hires made during that month (e.g., 200 hired and 400 openings would show\n\na fill rate of 50%), and potentially flag hiring challenges. Likewise, fill rates above 100% indicate\n\nthat hiring in a given month exceeded the number of job openings remaining at the end of the\n\nmonth (e.g., 175 hires and 100 openings would show a fill rate of 175%).\n\nOverall, private sector employers had fill rates above 100% until 2015âconsistent with Figure\n\n1âwhen job openings started to exceed monthly hires. In general, fill rates for retail sales were\n\nabove the industry average and exceeded the fill rate for the health care and social assistance\n\nindustry. That retail sales jobs are easier to fill is not unexpected, as most positions appear to have\n\nrelatively few specialized or scarce skill requirements. For perspective, nearly 23% of retail sales\n\npositions in May 2020 were retail salespersons (i.e., whose primary function is to sell\n\nmerchandise to customers), another 19% were cashiers, and 13% were laborers and material\n\nmovers. By contrast, 33% of positions in the lower-fill-rate health care and social assistance\n\nindustry were for healthcare practitioners and in technical occupations and 29% were in\n\nhealthcare support occupations.\n\nThe fill rate declined in both industries (and in private sector industries overall) from 2010 to\n\n2020. While a skills mismatch explanation is possible, it is not the obvious primary cause. For\n\none, the unemployment rate also declined considerably over this period (from 9.8% in January\n\n2010 to 3.5% in January 2020), indicating that the labor market was become increasingly\n\ncompetitive. In addition, given the occupational composition of the retail sales industry (i.e.,\n\npredominantly sales and cashiers positions) a skills deficiency argument appears less compelling.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n10\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nFigure 3.

Data for November 2021 are preliminary.\n\nEmployer Surveys and Industry Reporting\n\nAs consumers of workersâ skills, employers and industry groups can provide nuanced insights on\n\nthe availability of in-demand skills in their particular labor markets. These perspectives are\n\nsometimes captured in employer surveys, which collect information for various purposes and can\n\ntake many forms. Federal agencies, for example, may sponsor employer surveys to improve the\n\nallocation of government resources.21 Private sector organizations, such as human resources\n\nconsultants (sometimes called workforce solutions companies or recruitment experts), have\n\nsponsored or conducted employer surveys as well.\n\nSome surveys provide a broad gauge of employer experiences, polling employers across multiple\n\nindustries and sometimes across countries.22 Such data can help to identify broad gaps in skills\n\n(i.e., that exist across multiple industries), but may lack details needed to develop a policy\n\nresponse. For example, a recent Manpower Talent Shortage report indicates that âskilled trades\n\n(electricians, welders, mechanics)â were the hardest-to-fill positions in the United States.23\n\nAdditional data and analysis are needed to determine if such positions are hard to fill because\n\nemployers receive little response to job postings, because applicants do not have the needed\n\n21 For example, a recent DOL-funded study collected and examined information from employers to learn how to\n\nsupport and leverage strong relationships between employers and workforce development providers. See Molly Scott,\n\nLauren Eyster, and Yipeng Su et al., The Employer Perspectives Study: Insights on How to Build and Maintain Strong\n\nEmployer-College Partnerships, Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training Round 4\n\nEvaluation, Prepared for the U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC, October 2018, https://www.dol.gov/sites/\n\ndolgov/files/OASP/legacy/files/Employer-Perspectives-Study-Report-Round-Final.pdf.\n\n22 The Manpower Group reports, for example, its Talent Shortage report is based on information collected from more\n\nthan 24,400 employers across six sectors and 44 countries and territories; see âAbout This Surveyâ at\n\nhttps://go.manpowergroup.com/talent-shortage.\n\n23 Manpower Group, Talent Shortage 2020, Closing the Skills Gap: What Workers Want,\n\nhttps://go.manpowergroup.com/talent-shortage.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n11\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nskills, because of high turnover in such occupations, because qualified workers are reluctant to\n\nrelocate for work, or for other reasons.24\n\nSome employer organizations survey their members (employers) on a regular basis, providing\n\nsome insights on how staffing challenges have evolved over time. The National Federation of\n\nIndependent Business (NFIB), for example, publishes a monthly jobs report based on its Small\n\nBusiness Economic Trends data, which have been collected from NFIB members since 1974.\n\nNFIB reported that in April 2021, 54% of surveyed business owners struggled to find qualified\n\napplicants (an increase over the March 2021 report).25 Detailed analyses are sometimes provided\n\nthrough industry reports, which may be sponsored by industry organizations, and often describe\n\nindustry employersâ current and projected workforce needs, hiring challenges, and strategies for\n\naddressing skill shortages.26 Given their narrower focus, industry reports can be helpful to\n\nunderstanding the specific staffing challenges and their drivers.\n\nEmployer surveys and industry reports can be illuminating sources, shedding light on specific\n\noccupation and skill needs generally or in a particular industry, but they are limited in a few key\n\nways. For one, they may base their findings in part on proprietary business data, whichâthough\n\nvaluableâcomplicates the verification of some claims. Relatedly, they may draw their sample\n\nfrom members who opt to participate in the survey. This can result in small and select samples,\n\nboth of which can limit the representativeness of findings.27 Finally, to the extent that employer or\n\nindustry groups use the results of such surveys to advocate for greater government investment in\n\nworkforce development programs, these groups may have incentives to emphasize a skills\n\nshortage or a skills mismatch interpretation of employer experiences when other interpretations\n\nare possible.\n\nWorkersâ Educational Attainment and Employersâ Educational\n\nRequirements\n\nSome studies have explored the potential for a mismatch between workersâ educational\n\nattainment and employersâ educational requirements (i.e., an over- or under-supply), using a\n\nvariety of methods.28 While formal education is not the only mechanism by which workers\n\nacquire skills, it provides some indication of the skill sets available to employers and is relatively\n\nstraightforward to observe in labor force data.29 And a research focus on educational mismatch is\n\n24 Recruitment challenges may stem from employer decisions as well, such as below-market wages offers or setting\n\nunrealistic qualifications requirements.\n\n25 The NFIB Jobs Report for April 2021 is at https://assets.nfib.com/nfibcom/2021-April-Jobs-Report-FINAL.pdf.\n\n26 For example, the Manufacturing Institute, part of the National Association of Manufacturers, has collaborated with\n\nDeloitte to publish multiple reports on employersâ staffing needs in the U.S. manufacturing sector; see\n\nhttp://www.themanufacturinginstitute.org/Research/Skills-Gap-in-Manufacturing/Skills-Gap-in-Manufacturing.aspx.\n\n27 For example, the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) 2019 Skills Gap Survey had was based on\n\nresponses from 1,028 SHRM members who responded to an invitation to participate; SHRM reports that 20,000\n\ninvitations were sent, translating into about a 5% response rate. The methodological note to its report cautions readers\n\nthat âalthough SHRM is confident in its research, it is prudent to understand that the results presented in this survey\n\nreport are only truly representative of the sample of HR professionals responding to the survey.â Society of Human\n\nResource Management, The Global Skills Shortage, Bridging the Talent Gap with Education, Training, and Sourcing,\n\n2019, https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/pages/skills-gap-2019.aspx.\n\n28 A review of studies is in Seamus McGuinness, Konstantinos Pouliakas, and Paul Redmond, Skills Mismatch:\n\nConcepts, Measurement and Policy Approaches, Journal of Economic Surveys, Vol. 32, 2018, pp. 985-1015.\n\n29 Many workers gain the skills and knowledge they need through formal or on-the-job training and work experience.\n\nNon-school preparation can be significant for some jobs. For example, the BLS reports that entry-level physicians\n\ntypically complete a three to seven-year internship and residency program in addition to obtaining bachelorâs and\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n12\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nsupported by business reports and posted job requirements, which show that workersâ education\n\nlevels are meaningful to employers. In 2020, for example, nearly 70% of civilian workers were in\n\njobs for which employers identify a minimum educational level for average job performance.30\n\nAnalysis of online job-postings requirements also show rising employer demand for bachelorâs\n\ndegrees.31\n\nThe literature on educational mismatch for the United States in particular is relatively small and\n\nhas produced mixed findings, with some finding little evidence of a mismatch and others raising\n\nconcerns about a shortfall of college-educated workers.32 Current national survey data suggest the\n\nnumber of college-educated workers may be sufficient to meet employersâ needs. BLS data show,\n\nfor example, thatâbased on employer reportsâabout 23% of jobs held in 2020 required at least a\n\nbachelorâs degree for average job performance. In terms of supply, however, 44.0% of employed\n\nworkers (29.5% of unemployed workers) had acquired at least that credential.33 At the other end\n\nof the spectrum, BLS data also show that whereas employers indicated that 71% of jobs held in\n\n2020 required a high school degree or less education, more than 90% of employed workers had at\n\nleast graduated from high school.\n\nAnother approach to assessing a mismatch on educational attainment is to ask workers whether\n\nthey hold the necessary credentials to do their job, or if a higher level is needed or a lower level\n\nwould be sufficient. The 2017 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n\n(OECD) Survey of Adult Skills put that question to U.S. workers, who largely reported that they\n\nheld the necessary degree (59.2%) or that a lower level of education would be sufficient\n\n(31.4%).34\n\nmedical school degrees. This is not the case for all jobs, however. BLS data also indicate that many jobs can be\n\nperformed with little specific training: employers reported that in 2020, nearly 31% of workers were in jobs that\n\nrequired more than a short demonstration but not more than one month of preparation time.

The share of employed U.S. workers with a bachelorâs or higher degree has also been\n\nrising: from 28% in 1994 (the first year for which BLS published such statistics) to 44% in 2020.\n\n32 For example, the American Action Forum projects that by 2029 the labor market may face an undersupply of\n\nworkers with a bachelorâs or higher degree that exceeds 8 million workers. Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Tom Lee,\n\nProjecting Future Skill Shortages Through 2029, American Action Forum, July 18, 2019,\n\nhttps://www.americanactionforum.org/research/projecting-future-skill-shortages-through-2029/.\n\n33 That workersâ educational attainment exceeded minimum educational requirements for jobs in 2020 does not\n\nnecessarily indicate an overeducated workforce. Education can increase the range of jobs available to a worker and help\n\nworkers advance their careers, and has value (e.g., in terms of quality of life, intellectual enrichment, life management,\n\nhealth) that may not be measured by labor markets. Data on minimum educational requirements are from BLS, ORS,\n\n2020, https://www.bls.gov/ors/; and data on the educational attainment of employed and unemployed workers are from\n\nBLS, Current Population Survey (CPS), https:/www.bls.gov/cps.\n\n34 CRS calculations based on the OECD Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies public use\n\nfile published by the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics at https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?\n\npubid=2020222. Similarly, Michael J. Handel summarizes job requirements from data he collected through his Survey\n\nof Skills, Technology, and Management Practices (STAMP), and finds âhalf of the jobs are described by workers as\n\nrequiring no more than a high school degree, and over 30% of workers report their jobs require less education than they\n\nhave attained personally.â See Michael J. Handel, âWhat Do People Do at Work?

Typical entry-level education is\n\ndetermined by a number of factors, including the educational attainment of workers who currently\n\nwork in the occupation and evolving training needs for new entrants in the occupation.36 The\n\nestimates of occupational employment growth can be combined with data on the level of\n\neducation that is typically needed to enter each occupation to offer some insight into the\n\neducational demands of the current and near-future labor markets.37\n\nTable 1 presents the employment levels in 2020 and projected employment levels in 2030 in\n\noccupations by typical educational level needed for entry.38 In short, the numbers in Table 1 do\n\nnot suggest a drastic rise in the share of jobs requiring a higher education degree at entry. BLS\n\nprojects that employment in occupations with typical entry-level education at the postsecondary\n\nlevel will grow faster than the national average. Conversely, employment in occupations where\n\nthe typical entry-level education is a high school diploma or less are projected to grow at a rate\n\nslower than the national average. But these differences in growth result in only incremental\n\nchanges to each occupational groupâs overall share of the labor market. For example, despite the\n\nrelatively slower employment growth projected for occupations that typically do not require\n\npostsecondary education for entry, the share of employment in these occupations is expected to\n\ndecline by less than a percentage point. Similarly, the employment share of occupations that\n\ntypically require a bachelorâs degree or more is projected to increase by less than a percentage\n\npoint. This projected employment share of occupations that typically require a bachelorâs degree\n\nwould still be less than the approximately 44% of employed workers (employed in any\n\noccupation) with at least a bachelorâs degree in 2021.39\n\n35 For example, the EP program projects the number of registered nurse or retail salesperson jobs that are expected to\n\nexist in the national labor market at the beginning and end of a 10-year period. The most recent projections cover 2020\n\nthrough 2030 and include approximately 800 occupations. The BLS employment projections methods are described at\n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/emp/calculation.htm. The BLS approach is not embraced by all researchers. For\n\nexample, Carnevale et al. provide a critique of BLS projection methods and apply an alternative estimation strategy.\n\nSee Anthony Carnevale, Nicole Smith, and Jeff Stroehl, Recovery: Job Growth and Education Requirements Through\n\n2020, Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, June 2013, https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/\n\nrecovery-job-growth-and-education-requirements-through-2020/#resources; and Anthony Carnevale, Nicole Smith, and\n\nJeff Stroehl, Help Wanted: Projections of Job and Education Requirements Through 2018, Georgetown Center on\n\nEducation and the Workforce, June 2010.\n\n36 In some cases, typical education may be higher than the minimum education for average job performance described\n\nin the prior section and measured by the BLS Occupational Requirements Survey. For more information, see BLS,\n\nEmployment Projections, âMeasures of education and training,â https://www.bls.gov/emp/documentation/education/\n\ntech.htm.\n\n37 CRS used information on the âtypical education needed for entryâ for each occupation in 2020 from EP Table 1.7\n\n(https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/occupational-projections-and-characteristics.htm) to group occupations by educational\n\nlevel. Employment levels were then tabulated for 2020 (estimated employment) and 2030 (projected employment) by\n\neducation level. Results were verified against the â2020 Employmentâ and âEmployment Changeâ for each educational\n\nlevel in Table 5.2 (https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/education-summary.htm).\n\n38 While each occupation is assigned a single level of education typical to entry, many occupations have workers at\n\ndiffering education levels. For example, the EP specifies that the typical educational level for a construction manager is\n\na bachelorâs degree and the typical educational level for a paralegal is an associateâs degree, even though each\n\noccupation has workers with higher and lower levels of education. For a distribution of education level by occupation,\n\nsee EP Table 5.3 at https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/educational-attainment.htm.\n\n39 Arguably, a share of workers with at least a bachelorâs degree in 2021 will have left the labor market by 2030, for\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n14\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nTable 1.

If the typical level of education in some occupations increases,\n\nthen the distribution of employment in occupations at higher levels of education may increase at a\n\nrate faster than that suggested by the table.\n\nEducational Attainment: Qualitative Considerations\n\nThe discussion above suggests that the U.S. workforce has the educational credentials desired by\n\nemployers when measured at a broad level. But college graduates experience a range of outcomes\n\nin the labor market, indicating that some degree-holders are more in demand (or productive) in\n\nthe workplace than others. This variability may be, in part, a response to a greater range of skills\n\nretirement or other reasons. Some positions in 2030 that require a bachelorâs degree or higher education will hire from\n\nthe pool of new labor market entrants. See BLS, CPS, Labor Force Statistics Database (at https://www.bls.gov/cps/\n\ndata.htm) for information on the number of workers in the civilian noninstitutional population 25 years and over with at\n\nleast a bachelorâs degree.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n15\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nand abilities brought to the labor market by bachelorâs degree holders (i.e., worker\n\ncharacteristics), and to differences in degree-granting institutional characteristics (e.g.,\n\npreparation quality, coursework) or specialized training (e.g., field of study).\n\nResearch shows that field of study matters to labor market outcomes, perhaps reflecting a relative\n\nscarcity of certain skill sets in the labor market as well as differences in employersâ valuation of\n\nspecialized skills. In terms of skills mismatch, this may suggest a horizontal mismatchâthat is,\n\nworkers may hold the required level of education but not in the field sought by employers.40 For\n\nexample, analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that whereas the overall\n\nmedian earnings of college graduates early in their careers was $42,000 in the 2018-2019 period,\n\nearly-career earnings varied by college major (from $32,300 for family and consumer science\n\nmajors to $68,000 for chemical and electrical engineers).41 Another study found similar patterns\n\namong career certificate programs.42 In addition to documenting a considerable range of annual\n\nearnings across certificate programs (e.g., $15,300 for a medical assisting certificate graduate and\n\n$33,900 for a graduate with a certificate in licensed vocational nursing), the study found that\n\nseveral certificate programs with the highest enrollments had low earnings (e.g., 10 of 15\n\nprograms with the most graduates had âtypical earnings of $18,000 or lessâ), raising questions\n\nabout a potential oversupply of certain credentials.43 So while BLS data and some studies suggest\n\nthat the overall number of college graduates and career certificate holders meets or exceeds\n\nemployersâ needs, there may yet remain a mismatch when specific post-secondary credentials are\n\nconsidered.\n\nSkills Not Measured by Educational Credentials\n\nEmployers have general and specific skill needs that are not captured fully by educational\n\ncredentials. For example, some job postings solicit cognitive skills (e.g., problem solving) or\n\nsocial skills (e.g., communication, teamwork) in addition to educational requirements, or\n\ncondition employment on applicantsâ ability to pass a background check or other measure of\n\ntrustworthiness.44 Assessing a mismatch between the supply and demand for these skills is\n\n40 In addition, workers may be employed outside of their field of study. For example, an individual trained as a chemist\n\nmay be employed as an industry consultant.\n\n41 Federal Reserve Bank of New York, âThe Labor Market for Recent College Graduates,â May 21, 2021,\n\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/college-labor-market_compare-majors.html. Another study\n\nthat examined pay differentials across college majors also identified chemical and electrical engineering among top-\n\nearnings majors, while a major in âmusic and speech/dramaâ was a low-earning major. Joseph G. Altonji, Lisa B.\n\nKahn, and Jamin D. Speer, âCashier or Consultant? Entry Labor Market Conditions, Field of Study, and Career\n\nSuccess,â Journal of Labor Economics, vol. 34, no. S1 (2016), pp. S361-S401. In related work, the same authors found\n\nthat the pay differential between higher- and lower-paying college degrees increased over the 1993-2011 period; see\n\nJoseph G. Altonji, Lisa B. Kahn, and Jamin D. Speer, âTrends in Earnings Differentials across College Majors and the\n\nChanging Task Composition of Jobs,â American Economic Review, vol. 104, no. 5 (2014), pp. 387-93.\n\n42 The Aspen Institute, From College to Jobs: Making Sense of the Labor Market Returns to Higher Education, 2015,\n\nhttps://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/labormarketreturns/.\n\n43 This could suggest an oversupply of workers with such training, but other explanations are possible. For example,\n\nearnings may be low because the programs prepare workers for entry-level jobs that require considerable employer-\n\nprovided training or supervision.\n\n44 David Deming and Lisa Kahn found, for example, that employers seeking candidates for professional occupations\n\nfrequently include cognitive (37% of professional job postings), social skill requirements (36% of professional job\n\npostings), or both (25% of professional job postings) in postings in addition to educational attainment requirements\n\n(59% of postings; among such postings with educational requirements, the average requirement is 15.7 years of\n\nschool). David Deming and Lisa B. Kahn, âSkill Requirements across Firms and Labor Markets: Evidence from Job\n\nPostings for Professionals,â Journal of Labor Economics, vol. 36, no. S1 (2018), pp. S337-370 (hereinafter, âDeming\n\nand Kahn, 2018â).\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n16\n\nlink to page 16 link to page 16 Skills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nchallenging, because few surveys attempt to measure them in workers at a national level, but\n\nthere is some indication that an undersupply may exist. A 2017 survey of small businesses, for\n\nexample, indicates that among firms that reported recent difficulties in hiring, 36% gave âlack of\n\nsoft skillsâ as a reason and 23% gave âdifficulty passing background check, credit check, or drug\n\ntestâ as a reason that hiring was challenging.45\n\nIn addition, workers can gain skills and expertise through nondegree postsecondary programs\n\n(e.g., certifications), apprenticeships, and on-the-job training (formally and informally acquired).\n\nRecent BLS data and projections point to strong and continuing demand for workers in the\n\nmiddle-skill range (i.e., education and/or training beyond high school but less than a college\n\ndegree) in some occupations. For example, industrial machinery mechanics, electricians, and\n\nfitness instructors are examples of occupations that do not require a post-secondary degree for\n\nentry-level positions, had median annual earnings in 2019 that were greater than the overall\n\nmedian ($39,810), and were projected by BLS to grow by at least 50,000 jobs and with average or\n\nbetter employment growth between 2019 and 2029.46\n\nReview of the Evidence for the Existence of Skills\n\nGaps\n\nA skills gap describes a shortfall of a certain skill or set of skills broadly sought by employers. A\n\ngap in the supply of foundational skills (e.g., reading comprehension, numeracy), for example,\n\nwould have far reaching consequences for U.S. employers, as these skills are needed in most\n\noccupations. Digital literacy and soft skills are also required, to varying degrees, in many\n\nworkplaces. Given their large-scale nature, identifying and measuring skills gaps generally\n\nrequires national-level assessment. Federal statistical agencies, like the National Center for\n\nEducation Statistics (NCES) and BLS, that are able to collect nationally representative data, play\n\nkey roles in measuring countrywide supply and demand for certain skills. Some research\n\norganizations and business consultants provide additional insights into the extent of gaps by\n\ncollecting or analyzing large-scale data or examining the skill content of jobs (See the âEmployer\n\nSurveys and Industry Reportingâ section of this report for a discussion, including of the\n\nlimitations of these resources). Available prominent sources do not seem to clearly identify a\n\nsizable gap in foundational skills or basic digital skills in the U.S. workforce. However, several\n\navailable sources generate findings that lend themselves to multiple interpretations, and it is often\n\ndifficult using existing indicators to map assessed skill levels (of workers or those preparing to\n\nenter the workforce) against the precise level of skills needed across the workforce. Moreover,\n\nseveral types of skills are not addressed in existing sources. Additional researchâincluding the\n\ndevelopment of standardized measuresâcould assess the sufficiency of soft skills in the U.S.\n\nworkforce.\n\n45 The study was based on data from the 2017 Small Business Credit Survey (SBCS), which included a module on\n\nhiring challenges and firm responses to such challenges. Hiring difficulties are prevalent; about two-thirds of firms with\n\nrecent job openings reported challenges. Such firms were asked to select from a survey-provided list of reasons that\n\nhiring was difficult, and were permitted to select more than one reason.

As expected, these types of skills are broadly sought by employers.\n\nFor example, BLS reported that nearly all jobs in 2020 had a minimum formal education or\n\nliteracy requirement.47 Extending beyond narrow characterizations of basic skills, a recent Pew\n\nResearch Center analysis indicated that âfundamental skillsâ such as critical thinking, writing,\n\nspeaking, reading comprehension, active listening and learning, and judgment and\n\ndecisionmaking were important to work performance in about 70% of occupations.48\n\nA limited number of national level resources assess the foundational skills of current or future\n\nworkers. Results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a nationally\n\nrepresentative assessment of U.S. students, that examines some core foundational skills, suggest\n\nthat most 12th grade students in 2019 had at least basic math and reading skills (70% of students\n\nin reading and 60% of students in math). At the same time, these results suggest sizable\n\npopulations of students possess a skill level below the basic 12th grade skill level in these areas\n\n(30% in reading and 40% in math) as assessed by NAEP. 49\n\nMapping these NAEP results against the skill content of jobs in the economy is not a\n\nstraightforward exercise. In part, this is because NAEP does not purport to assess students against\n\nthe skill requirement of jobs; it is focused on assessing learning expected at certain grade levels in\n\nschool.50 It is also hard to decipher the proportion of jobs that demand 12th grade skill levels in\n\nthese domains. Consider, for instance, that 22% of employment in the United States is in\n\noccupations typically requiring no formal educational credential. Another 39% of employment is\n\nin occupations typically requiring a high school equivalent education. It is difficult to glean the\n\n47 According to employer responses to the BLS 2020 Occupational Requirements Survey (ORS), 69.5% of jobs\n\nrequired at least a high school degree, and 27.2% of jobs that did not have a minimum formal educational requirement\n\nrequired literacy. See https://www.bls.gov/ors/.\n\n48 The Occupation Information Network (O*NET) database was a key source of information for the Pew Research\n\nCenter study. The O*NET database contains standardized and occupation-specific descriptors on hundreds of U.S.\n\noccupations. It was developed and is maintained by the North Carolina Department of Commerce with financing from\n\nthe Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration. Additional information is at\n\nhttps://www.onetcenter.org/. Rakesh Kochar, Women Make Gains in the Workplace Amid a Rising Demand for Skilled\n\nWorkers, Pew Research Center, January 2020, https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/01/30/women-make-gains-in-\n\nthe-workplace-amid-a-rising-demand-for-skilled-workers/.\n\n49 Specifically, 2019 NAEP assessments indicated that 60% of 12th grade students were, at a minimum, able to solve\n\nmathematical problems that require the direct application of concepts and procedures in familiar mathematical and real-\n\nworld settings, and when reading text appropriate to 12th grade, 70% of 12th grade students were, at a minimum, able to\n\ndemonstrate an overall understanding and make some interpretations of the text. These students demonstrated either a\n\nbasic, proficient, or advanced level of achievement on assessments. Studentsâ performance on the NAEP assessments\n\nvaries across subgroups of the population. The level of performance required in each domain likely varies across\n\noccupations. In any case, efforts to improve studentsâ performance at the individual and group levels may yield\n\nconsiderable benefits for students, regardless of whether or not employers currently find these foundational skills in\n\nsufficient supply. A discussion of the NAEP and other assessments is in CRS Report R45401, National and\n\nInternational Educational Assessments: Overview, Results, and Issues, by Rebecca R. Skinner. Assessment results are\n\nat https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/.\n\n50 NAEP assesses students in relation to standards that define what students should know and be able to do in particular\n\nsubjects. The NAEP Governing Board works with subject matter experts, practitioners, members of the business\n\ncommunity, and members of the public when establishing standards. Standards are collaboratively developed based on\n\nthe knowledge and experience of various stakeholders, and are focused on knowledge, skills, and competencies that are\n\nrelevant to many endeavors, not just those applicable to work. For more information on NAEP and its focus, see CRS\n\nReport R45401, National and International Educational Assessments: Overview, Results, and Issues, by Rebecca R.\n\nSkinner.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n18\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nprecise share of this set of occupations requiring the 12th grade level of skill in these foundational\n\nareas as that skill level is assessed by NAEP. Hence, NAEP results (based on those not yet fully in\n\nthe workforce) may lend themselves to multiple interpretations if applied to debates about the\n\npotential existence of a broad undersupply of foundational skills.\n\nAnother relevant resource is a large series of work readiness assessments conducted over the\n\n2006 to 2011 period by the ACT, which in addition to college entrance exams and educational\n\nassessment work, develops and administers job readiness assessments for a large array of\n\ncorporate clients. These assessments indicate that workers generally have foundational reading\n\nand applied mathematical skills needed by employers.51 However, ACT analysis also revealed\n\nthat information location skillsâskills that are important in many types of workâwere lacking\n\nfor numerous worker groups.\n\nOne more source generating findings of relevance at a national (and international) level is the\n\nOECD Survey of Adult Skills, which presents survey respondents with a series of questions about\n\nthe extent to which and ways in which they use skills in their everyday life and at work. The\n\nsurvey also administers some assessments to gauge respondentâs levels of proficiency in these\n\nskill domains. Finally, in one set of analyses, it maps assessed skill level against self-reported\n\nlevel and nature of use of skills at work. Findings are reported on whether assessed skill levels are\n\nwell matched with, or whether respondents are under-skilled or over-skilled in relation to, the\n\nskill demands they report facing at work (in qualifications, literacy and numeracy skills, and field\n\nof study). These findings suggest that in 2017, U.S. respondents were typically well-matched or\n\nover-skilled in terms of qualifications and literacy and numeracy skills; about half of U.S.\n\nrespondents reported they were well-matched in their field of study.52\n\nBasic Digital Skills\n\nUse of digital technology in U.S. workplaces suggest broad demand for basic digital skills across\n\noccupations and industries.53 National data on the workplace role of digital technology are scarce,\n\nbut some studies have been able to document the widespread nature of digital skills through\n\noccupational analysis and online job posting requirements. Researchers from the Brookings\n\nInstitution, for example, analyzed the digital skill content of hundreds of occupations using the\n\nOccupation Information Network (O*NET) database, a DOL-funded catalog of standardized job\n\ncharacteristics for hundreds of occupations, and found that a majority of jobs in 2016 had a\n\nmedium or high digital content level.54 High digital content jobsâsuch as software developers,\n\n51 The ACT work readiness standards are based on a nationally representative sample of jobs in a given occupation.\n\nACTâs work readiness findings (i.e., the degree to which workers possess certain foundational skills) are based on a\n\nlarge sample (4 million assessments) but the methodology section of the report does not indicate whether this sample is\n\nnationally representative.

Retail jobs use digital point-of-sale and inventory\n\ntechnology. Navigation and communication software are used in transportation jobs. Construction work and production\n\njobs use digital technology to schedule and document work, improve workplace safety, and run diagnostic tests on\n\nmachinery.\n\n54 Mark Muro, Sifan Liu, Jacob Whiton, and Siddharth Kulkarni, Digitization and the American Workforce, Brookings\n\nInstitution, November 2017, https://www.brookings.edu/research/digitalization-and-the-american-workforce/.

Similarly, a study of middle-skill job postings in 2016 by Burning\n\nGlass Technologies (BGT) indicated that 82% of middle-skill jobs required some proficiency in\n\ndigital skills.55 The ability to use productivity software (e.g., word processing, spreadsheets)\n\neffectively appears to be a baseline digital skills requirement; the majority (78%) of middle-skill\n\npostings in 2016 required applicants to be able to use this software.\n\nWhile some observers have pointed to a lack of digital skills in some industries,56 there does not\n\nappear to be a widespread absence of these skills in the U.S. workforce. The results of the 2017\n\nOECD Survey of Adult Skills, for example, revealed that most U.S. adults (ages 16 to 65) had at\n\nleast basic technology skills.57 The survey results indicated that more than 30% of adults could\n\ncomplete straightforward tasks using common technology applications and simple reasoning, and\n\nan additional 31% could perform more advanced tasks using both common and more specific\n\ntechnology and more sophisticated problem-solving skills.58\n\nSoft Skills\n\nThe term soft skills generally captures workersâ ability to interact effectively with others (e.g.,\n\ncustomers, teams of coworkers, the public) and includes skills such as social intelligence,\n\ncommunication skills, the ability to set goals and plan and carry out tasks, and a positive attitude\n\ntoward work and learning. Employers demand for such skills can be measured through employer\n\nsurveys and job posting requirements, and seen in labor market outcomes for positions that rely\n\non strong soft skills. For example, a survey conducted by the National Association of Colleges\n\nand Employers revealed that the top three attributes sought by employers in 2019 were problem-\n\nsolving skills, ability to work on team, and a strong work ethic.59 Interpersonal skills are a clear\n\noccupation.â\n\n55 The study defined middle-skill jobs as those for which most job postings do not require a bachelorâs degree and at\n\nleast 50% offer a $15 hourly wage. Burning Glass Technologies, The Digital Edge: Middle-Skill Worker and Careers,\n\nSeptember 2017, https://www.burning-glass.com/research-project/digital-skills-gap/\n\n56 For example, participants in a panel hosted by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 highlighted a prevalence of low\n\ndigital skills among workers in certain industries (e.g., manufacturing); see HRDive, Millions of US workers have\n\nâlimited or no digital skills, February 2020, https://www.hrdive.com/news/millions-of-us-workers-have-limited-or-no-\n\ndigital-skills/572048/.\n\n57 The OECD Survey of Adult Skills is designed to measure the proficiencyâas defined by the OECDâof working-\n\nage adults (16-65 year-olds) in three key information-processing skills (literacy, numeracy, and problem solving in\n\ntechnology-rich environments) and to allow for international comparisons. The survey has been conducted in over 40\n\ncountries since 2011, including the United States in 2011-2012 and 2017. The survey defines problem solving in\n\ntechnology-rich environments as âusing digital technology, communication tools and networks to acquire and evaluate\n\ninformation, communicate with others and perform practical tasksâ and assesses respondentsâ abilities âto solve\n\nproblems for personal, work and civic purposes by setting up appropriate goals and plans, and accessing and making\n\nuse of information through computers and computer networks.â Additional information on survey design is at\n\nhttps://www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/about/#d.en.481111. Recent results are in OECD, Skills Matter: Additional Results\n\nfrom the Survey of Adult Skills, OECD Skills Studies, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1787/1f029d8f-en.\n\n58 Another nearly 20% could successfully complete simple information and communications technology (ICT) tasks but\n\ncould not complete those with greater complexity. Specifically, such individuals could complete tasks based on well-\n\ndefined problems involving few steps and that do not require any categorical or inferential reasoning. The survey also\n\nprovided insights into digital illiteracy among U.S. adults; the share of adults with no or little ICT in the United States\n\nwas 7.4%, which was below the OECD-country average of 16.3%.\n\n59 National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), Key Attributes Employers Want to See on Studentsâ\n\nResumes, January 13, 2020, https://www.naceweb.org/talent-acquisition/candidate-selection/key-attributes-employers-\n\nwant-to-see-on-students-resumes/.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n20\n\nSkills Gaps: A Review of Evidence and Underlying Concepts\n\nasset to workers in the service sector, particularly those who interact with the public.60 Analysis of\n\njob postings requirements by BGT indicated that communication skills were the top-ranked\n\nbaseline skills sought by employers across all occupations during the September 2014 to August\n\n2015 period.61 BGT uses the term baseline skills to denote skills (including soft skills) âsought by\n\nemployers across multiple occupations and that are not typically taught in training programs.â\n\nCustomer service was the second-ranked baseline skill in front-facing jobs like customer and\n\nclient support; hospitality, food, and tourism; and sales. A study by the Georgetown University\n\nCenter for Education and the Workforce linked data on recent labor market outcomes to data\n\ndescribing occupational competencies (in this context, occupational knowledge, skills, and\n\nabilities) and identified communication, teamwork, sales and customer service, leadership, and\n\nproblem solving and complex thinking as the top five competencies in high demand. Of these,\n\ncommunication had the highest demand across occupations.62 Further, economist David Deming\n\nobserved that high-skill occupations with the fastest employment growth (between 2000 and\n\n2012) were those that ârequire significant interpersonal interactionâ (e.g., managers, teachers,\n\nphysicians, nurses).63\n\nAssessing the sufficiency of soft skills in the U.S. workforce is particularly challenging. The term\n\ndoes not refer to a single, agreed-upon set of worker skills, and so employers may refer to\n\ndifferent and sometimes industry-specific soft skills when citing concerns about a soft skills\n\ngap.64 In addition, soft skills must be assessed in context (e.g., communication skills in a\n\ncustomer service role may differ from those needed in a technical work environment) and some\n\nsoft skills are more abstract than others (e.g., the ability to set goals may be easier to observe and\n\nassess objectively than creative-thinking skills).65 For these reasons, a standardized measure of\n\nsoft skills in the student population or in the workforce has yet to be developed, and it is therefore\n\nnot possible to assess with confidence whether or not a widespread deficiency in soft skills exists\n\nin the U.S. workforce.\n\n60 This is a potentially large group. BLS estimates that in 2019, about 75% of workers had some interaction with the\n\npublic, https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2020/three-fourths-of-workers-had-to-interact-with-the-public-in-"
