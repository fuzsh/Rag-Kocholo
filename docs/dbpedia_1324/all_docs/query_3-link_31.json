The session is designed to inform policy makers and practitioners about the underpinning rational for the manualâs application. The session will explore areas of influence and recognition with the International Valuation Standards and the RICSâs Global Valuation Standards (Red Book).\n\nThis is at a time when valuation and its operation are undergoing a revolution in understanding and practice. Valuers are being asked to consider and include valuation decisions on all kinds of âassetsâ from natural capital to social value as well as firm up on their protocols and standards on traditional concepts of âmarket valueâ. This important manual brings a lot of these thought processes to fruition as we look at âvalueâ, and its attribution to unregistered land. Valuation is a critical element of for enabling effective land acquisition, taxation and transfer processes and is a key component of land administration systems.\n\nIntro from UN Habitat GLTNâ¯\n\nDanilo Antonio and John Gitau, GLTN\n\nUN GLTNâ¯Unregisteredâ¯Land Manual â intro\n\nJamesâ¯Kavanaghâ¯(RICS)â¯\n\n[handouts]\n\nExpert authors ââ¯Mike McDermott & Peter Wyattâ¯\n\nViews on future use and development\n\nBen Elder, RICS, FIG Commission 9 and IVSC â the future direction of valuation practice\n\nDr. Kwabena Obeng Asiama - FIG Young Surveyors network â valuation, unregistered land and the YSN Volunteer Initiative\n\nMonday,\n\n21 June\n\n10:30â12:00\n\nSTAGES\n\n02.1 - Regional Academic Networks: Lessons from COVID-19 for SDG Goal 4 (education)\n\nCommission: 2\n\nChair: Dr. Dimo Todorovski, Netherlands\n\nRapporteur: Mr. Marien de Bakker, Netherlands\n\nThe aim of this session is to explore how the SDG Goal 4 targets and indicators would benefit from regional academic networks drawing on the lessons learned as we transitioned to fully online education.\n\nEffective regional academic networks allow effective sharing of knowledge with good online learning management systems and learning materials, and the online platforms also allow good teachers to reach more students through effective regional networks connected online. This will potentially help support improvements in\n\nTargets 4.3 and 4.5 - by improving access for both women and men.\n\nTarget 4.7 - the networks make it easier for learners to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development.\n\nMenare Royal Mabakeng, Stephnie De Villiers, Celina Awala, Ase Christensen and Uchendu Eugene Chigbu (Namibia):\n\nSupporting Capacity Development in Land Administration in Namibia: The NUST Experience (11034)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nRodolfo Salazar, Ginella Jacome (Ecuador) and Dimo Todorovski (Netherlands):\n\nLatin America Land Administration Network (LALAN), Covid19 and SDG 4 (11084)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nRosario Casanova and Paula Caram (Uruguay):\n\nTeaching on the ethical use of geographic information in America (11120)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nJossam Potel (Rwanda) and Monica Lengoiboni (Netherlands):\n\nThe Eastern African Land Administration Network and Covid 19: Effects and Implications (11148)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nUchendu Eugene Chigbu (Namibia), Elias Danyi Kuusaana (Ghana) and Menare Royal Mabakeng (Namibia):\n\nStructural Holes in Academic Networks: Lessons from Bridging Competency Gaps in Land-Related Education and Learning in Africa (11170)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nMonday,\n\n21 June\n\n10:30â12:00\n\nSTAGES\n\n03.4 - Geospatial impact of COVID-19\n\nCommission: 3\n\nChair: Prof. Markus Schaffert, Germany\n\nRapporteur: Ms. Sahinkaya Cemre, Turkey\n\nThe coronavirus is changing our lives worldwide.

The first half-hour will be an interactive series of presentations which explore the different faces that mentoring can hold, from participants in VCSP in-Country Mentoring and the SSSI Mentoring Program. This will explore the value of mentoring to different people and the unexpected aspects of the mentoring experience and how it can change lives. The remaining hour will be spent in structured speed-mentoring, where seasoned surveyors will have the chance to speak with young surveyors in five-minute time slots one-on-one (virtually) over a series of set topic areas.\n\nWith the global trends, technological changes, as well as the declining number of surveyors in the world, the surveying profession is facing a number of challenges. One of the keys to sustaining the future of the surveying profession is a well connected global community.\n\nMentoring is a key part of professional development in our industry. This session brings together seasoned and young surveyors to explore and highlight the benefits of mentoring at many levels - to the mentee, the mentor, their organisation, and the profession. The session will comprise presentations and âspeed-mentoringâ between seasoned and young surveyors present. Lessons from this session will be used together with lessons from previous mentoring programs and workshops to develop a strategy for a mentoring program within FIG and the FIG Young Surveyors Network.\n\nMonday,\n\n21 June\n\n13:00â14:00\n\nSTAGES\n\nKEYNOTE: THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE PROFESSION\n\nChair: Ms. Kate Fairlie, Land Administration Specialist, Former Chair of FIG Young Surveyors Network\n\nWhat impact is the coronavirus pandemic having on the geospatial industry worldwide?

Impressive figures. Governments and companies from all over the world are interested how Kadaster works with artificial intelligence, pointclouds and image generation (for the cadastral map). How is Kadaster moving with time and digital challenges?\n\nIn this session we discuss the issues, solutions and dilemmas we encounter in bringing our cadastre to the next level in a world where data are at the heart of societyâs needs and our operations. We provide an insight how cadastres evolve in this data-driven world and contribute to sound decision making and recording in the spatial domain and the land market in particular. This requires that the data ecosystem of the cadastres is linked up with the data of other domains. Cadastres will be more data-centric and have to link up with other domains if they want to remain a relevant to the users.\n\nAlso we zoom in on how Artificial Intelligence was used to rebuild the cadastral map. Currently the map has a so-called graphic quality (standard deviation of boundaries are 20 cm for urban areas and 40 cm for rural areas), because of the different working methods over time and the production scale. Kadaster has started a research program to develop a map where the location of borders is so accurate, that the map is more in line with future developments. For this purpose, almost all (historical) field sketches have to be processed. An enormous challenge that requires far reaching automation. The research program has investigated whether it is possible to automatically extract the original measurements from the fieldwork reports and to combine this information and re-determine the location of the boundaries. In this session the concept is explained as well as, geodetics aspects and AI solutions.

The ͚decade of action to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while celebrating the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. However, by March 2020, with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, optimism quickly deteriorated into an unprecedented global crisis. As a consequence, our world is now being forced to rapidly adapt to confronting social and economic changes and challenges, from local to global levels, across all industries and sectors, and in all areas of supply and demand. The pandemic has not only created new challenges, but reinforced the pre-existing obstacles to realizing the SDGs - structural inequalities, socio-economic gaps, and systemic challenges and risks and a lack of timely fundamental data and enabling technologies to measure and monitor what is happening where, when, and how.\n\nViewed through a geospatial lens, the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the unprecedented need for data, geospatial information, enabling technologies, and insights for governments and citizens across the globe, to not only enable decision-makers to inform policies and planning, but to also minimize the risk to people, especially the most vulnerable population groups.\n\nThis session will present the geospatial response to COVID-19, the future trends in geospatial information management to better respond to crises and accelerate the progress on the SDGs, the FAO and the World Bank support at the country level.\n\nConcept Note\n\nOpening: Hartmut Mueller, Chair of FIG Commission 3 and Rumyana Tonchovska, FAO of the UN\n\nCOVID-19: Ready to Respond.

The achievements of the past 18 months brings into sharp focus an important question for our profession today; as we look to the future of surveying, What skills and talents will we need to possess to solve the problems of the 21st century, and why. We need to attract the brightest young people from the broadest reaches of our societies reflecting diversity form around the world to enter our profession and practices.\n\nOur answer begins with a challenge. Our industry needs to find solutions to how the planet can accommodate human population growth yet remain within the bounds of the resilience of our planet. We will need new talent to help us archive this objective in a sustainable manner.\n\nWhat better place to start addressing this challenge by asking our panellists of rising young stars from Asia, Europe, Australia and Africa (and USA). They will deliberate and challenge our current conventions and mind-sets to ensure that we evolve in sync with the communities we serve.\n\nThe session aims to draft a statement addressed to Council for inclusion in the Future 2028 strategy deliberations and to gain knowledge, to achieve results with land and property organisations, to exchange knowledge and to be inspired.\n\nInvited speakers:\n\nMichail Kalogiannakis.

This is a wide-ranging session covering the PPP âconstellationâ. We will be considering how taking Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to the next level brings a new dynamic to PPPâs. Inspired by the Danish experience we will hear how the use of a âcooperativeâ approach to PPPs can, if emulated in developing countries, offer the flexibility required to create fit for purpose land administration systems that would otherwise not be possible if relying on the traditional top-down approach. We will consider the oft ignored but critically important commercial viability element of PPPs, discover how collaboration between the private and public sector is working in the context of maintaining the Spanish Cadastre and learn how âgenuineâ public partnership is being used to deliver security of tenure in Zambia. This is a wide-ranging session that is a must for anyone with an interest in ensuring a responsible intersection of the public and private sectors towards providing inclusive land governance and administration.\n\nCecilie Ravn-Christensen and Kenneth Norre (Denmark):\n\nPrivate Sector Responsibility in Supporting Sustainable Development (10866)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nSÃ¸ren Brandt Pedersen (Denmark):\n\nPublic â Private â Partnerships as a Catalyst for Tenure Governance in Developing Countries (10979)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nTony Burns (Australia), Fletcher Wright (USA), Kate Fairlie and Kate Rickersey (Australia):\n\nHow to conceptualize a PPP for land administration services: understanding the private sector and commercial feasibility.

The session will be interactive and delegates are encouraged to bring details of the challenges they have experienced in practice to the session to see how the manual could be applied in those circumstances.\n\nMonday,\n\n21 June\n\n22:00â23:30\n\nSTAGES\n\n05.3 - Vertical Datums Defined by GNSS and a Geoid\n\nCommission: 5\n\nChair: Mr. Nic Donnelly, New Zealand\n\nRapporteur: Mr. David Avalos, Mexico\n\nWhen defining spatial coordinates, the most fundamental component is the inherent reference frame for the geospatial data. GNSS observations must have the context of the reference frame to determine positions and provide for safe navigation. Physical heights above a vertical surface are usually taken with respect to geometric reference frames. To obtain precision and accuracy, it is necessary to understand how the vertical datum relates to the geometric reference frame.\n\nBasara Miyahara, Koji Matsuo, Tokuro Kodama and Shinobu Kurihara (Japan):\n\nDevelopment of Gravimetric Geoid Model of Japan Using Airborne Gravity Data Covering Japan Archipelago (10914)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nKevin Ahlgren (USA):\n\nAn Updated Surface Gravity Prediction Model (xGRAV20) (11150)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nChristopher Pearson (New Zealand) and Sebastien Vielliard (France):\n\nSupport for Dynamic Datums in Trimble Software (10897)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nYaw Opoku - Gyamfi, Kwame Tenadu, Isaac Dadzie, Herbert Djaba and Michael Nyoagbe (Ghana):\n\nEstablishing ghanaâs active geodetic reference network as a tool for enhancing national socio â economic development buoyed by the realities of a pandemic (11141)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nRichard Stanaway (Australia):\n\nApproaches to Time-Dependent Transformations Between Reference Frames in Practice (11144)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nMartin Lidberg (Sweden), Wolfgang SÃ¶hne (Germany) and Karin Kollo (Estonia):\n\nAdvancing the geodetic infrastructure in Europe through EUREF (11184)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nGershon Steinberg, Gilad Even - Tzur, Hagi Ronen, Hezi Hezi Sarid and Sagi Daliot (Israel):\n\nThe development of the Israeli official geoid undulation model (10892)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nThis is a peer reviewed paper.\n\nMachiel Bos, Rui Fernandes (Portugal), Mohammed Al-Marri, Mudher Abdulah (Qatar) and Hazem Barakat (Canada):\n\nThe New Gravimetric Geoid Model of Qatar: QG2020 (11176)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nSammy Matara, David Siriba, JohnBosco Kiema and Sammy Musyoka (Kenya):\n\nPredicting Displacement Effects of Tectonic Movements on the Kenyan Geodetic Reference Frame Network (KENREF) (10951)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nGyula IvÃ¡n (Hungary):\n\nTransformation Between Reference Ellipsoids, Using Non-Euclidean Relationships (11095)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nTuesday, 22 June Tuesday,\n\n22 June\n\n08:00â09:30\n\nSTAGES\n\nSmart Surveying in the Netherlands: Totally 3D\n\nChair: Mr. Harrie van der Werf, the Netherlands\n\nA cooperation between Rotterdam, The Hague and Amsterdam\n\nThis session covers three presentations with the following topics:\n\nMission and vision on 3D city modelling by Jane Hermans, Rotterdam, the Netherlands\n\nChange management by Harrie van der Werf, The Hague, the Netherlands\n\nCollaboration between Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, ministry of internal affairs and union of municipalities.\n\nMission and vision show the picture how we want to work with 3D-data in about five to ten years. At the moment most of the data used in the government are 2D. However, users of information and a lot of companies already work in 3D. In the exchange of information the government has to change incoming 3D survey data to 2D data as defined by law. After that the 2D data must be upgraded to 3D information for usage. A 3D process is more efficient. Furthermore the dialogue with citizens and other users is better facilitated. This happens for instance in the building sector where BIM is becoming the standard.\n\nChanging from working in 2D to 3D is a great change. Technically it is complex, but a lot is available. Change management shows that the technical issues are a small part of what is needed. In this section of the presentation we will explain how change can be accomplished. And how this change is directly related to the necessity of working with an architecture of microservices and standards for interfaces and 3D databases.\n\nThe third part of the presentation will cover how the collaboration between the three cities takes place. The collaboration is based on a modern information architecture (âcommon groundâ). Here we will present what we are doing right now. Working in an agile environment we create best practices in the entire chain of 3D information. The best practices will become available to everyone. (Including you).\n\nThese three subjects (mission, change and practice) will create questions: that will be the fourth part. You are invited to ask us anything: we will probably need your questions to improve our work.\n\nTuesday,\n\n22 June\n\n08:00â09:30\n\nSTAGES\n\n03.1 - Geospatial Analytics Use Cases\n\nCommission: 3\n\nChair: Mr. Cemal ÃzgÃ¼r Kivilcim, Turkey\n\nRapporteur: Mr. David Elegbede, Nigeria\n\nGeospatial analytics is the backbone to answering location-based questions and making smart decisions related to our world.

The purpose of this session is to give insight in what FELA is and to have an open discussion on the uptake of the framework in the FIG community, a communication plan and to share first ideas on implementations and use cases. The outcome would be that participants understand the current status of FELA and how this specialisation of IGIF can be used in the domain of Land Administration.\n\nAfter an introduction by Eva-Maria Unger (with plenty of room for questions), two themes will be discussed with the participants (this is an interactive session):\n\nWhat is needed to get FELA taken up by the FIG community?\n\nWhat is the right global communication approach for FELA?\n\nMore reading: The document on FELA can be found at https://ggim.un.org/meetings/GGIM-committee/10th-Session/documents/E-C.20-2020-29-Add_2-Framework-for-Effective-Land-Administration.pdf.

During 2020 all teaching and training institutions had to adapt very quickly so they could respond to the need for remote learning.\n\nDuring this transformation to online learning we saw may very innovative and inspiring approaches to online learning. However, we also found that online learning has very definite disadvantages. Some students really cannot cope well with online learning, and some learning activities need to be face-to-face. These experiences allow us to reflect on the good and bad aspects on transforming our education online. It is now generally accepted that online learning will be part of the future approaches to education, and that the challenge will be to find the best âblendâ of online and face-to-face learning.\n\nIn this session we aim to hear from leading academics and training organisations about the most innovative ways they adapted their learning and teaching to online. We also aim to have a discussion about these innovative approaches and how they help us to develop an appropriate âblendâ of online and face-to-face learning going forward.

They can support responsible land policies and land management strategies, assist land dispute reduction, enable fair investment opportunities, support social and spatial justice, and overall good governance. However, a large number of people-to-land relationships (read: tenures) are unaccounted for in formal land administration systems, especially in the developing countries. This undermines equity, equality and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For many reasons, conventional surveying approaches have been proven not to be efficient when it comes to scaling and completing land administration systems. Fit for Purpose approaches challenge the paradigm: seek lower costs, less recording time, and appropriate spatial data qualities. With FFPLA having now being formally on the FIG agenda for almost a decade, this session will reflect the successes, challenges, and future directions of the FFPLA approach.\n\nEmmanuel Nkurunziza, Director General of the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) Stig Enemark, Honorary FIG President, Senior Consultant and Professor Emeritus of Land Manaement, Aalborg University Denmark.

During 2020 all teaching and training institutions had to adapt very quickly so they could respond to the need for remote learning.\n\nDuring this transformation to online learning we saw many innovative and inspiring approaches to online learning. However, we also found that online learning has very definite disadvantages. Some students really cannot cope well with online learning, and some learning activities need to be face-to-face. These experiences allow us to reflect on the good and bad aspects on transforming our education online. It is now generally accepted that online learning will be part of the future approaches to education, and that the challenge will be to find the best âblendâ of online and face-to-face learning.\n\nGuenther Retscher (Austria), Vassilis Gikas (Greece) and Regine Gerike (Germany):\n\nCurricula Enrichment for Sri Lankan Universities Delivered through the Application of Location-Based Services to Intelligent Transport Systems (10865)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nThis is a peer reviewed paper.\n\nDimitris Anastasiou, Vangelis Zacharis, Vassilis Pagounis and Maria Tsakiri (Greece):\n\nAn Interactive Virtual Environment for Teaching Total Station Surveying (10957)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nAndrey Kupriyanov (Russia):\n\nScientific and Engineering Approaches of Study Courses Based on The GNSS-RTK/PPP Technology (10991)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nDeni Santo, Kariyono Kariyono and Mulyadi Mulyadi (Indonesia):\n\nBlended Learning Method to Improve Licensed Cadaster Surveyor Competency Standard in Indonesia (11043)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nChetha Ben (Fiji):\n\nExperiences and Innovation in land courses at the University of South Pacific (11238)\n\n[abstract] [paper] [handouts] [video]\n\nWednesday,\n\n23 June\n\n10:30â12:00\n\nSTAGES\n\n3.5 - Participatory Geospatial Approaches\n\nCommission: 3\n\nChair: Dr. Sagi Dalyot, Israel\n\nRapporteur: Mr. Cemal Kivilcim, Turkey\n\nMuch is done nowadays in respect to the investigation and identification of initiatives and projects that make use of user-generated spatial content as an enabler to processes, infrastructures, and services.
