        "text": "The Base Cup final between Telenet BC Oostende and Port of Antwerp Giants was held in front of a nice attendance at the Heysel Palais 12 in Brussels this afternoon. The Base Cup Final Four has definitely been a real success and congratulations to the organizers and volunteers involved in this project for the very good job done.\n\nNone of the teams on the floor was able to build a large advantage in the first quarter. After 6-6, BC Oostende took the lead via US player Ryan Thompson (198-G-89, college: Rider) and Serbian experienced guard Dusan Djordjevic (193-G-83, agency: Beo Basket), both pretty efficient in offense. The scoreboard showed 14-10 and 18-12 for the men of Coach Dario Gjergja (agency: Beo Basket ) but Belgian Lion Maxime De Zeeuw (204-PF-87) as well as US scorer Ryan Pearson (198-F-90, agency: Court Side, college: George Mason) allowed their team to quickly come back in the race. Gjerga had to send his tall guy Wesley Wilkinson (206-PF-84, college: Nebraska) back on the bench because he had committed personnal fouls already. The Giants of Belgian Coach Paul Vervaeck played tough and, thanks to a very spectacular shot from mid-range by small guard Frank Turner (176-PG-88, agency: Court Side, college: Canisius) on the buzzer, were even on top (24-25) after 10 minutes in this game.\n\nExperienced BCO captain Veselin Petrovic (195-G/F-77, agency: Beo Basket) had a few minutes of play in the first and second quarters of the title game. He had not played in the semifinal against Liege Basket last Saturday. Belgian internationals Maxime De Zeeuw and Roel Moors (190-G-78) hit three-pointers to bring their team on top at 28-31. Mateusz Ponitka (197-F/G-93) for BCO and Roel Moors for the Giants showed their full potential and the game gained in intensity. The scoreboard showed 36-39 on a fastbreak finished in an impressive manner by Giants' playmaker Frank Turner. BCO Head Coach Dario Gjergja took a time-out right after Turner's spectacular action. Quentin Serron (190-G-90) converted a three-point shot and Veselin Petrovic stole the ball to lay it in and make 41-39. Roel Moors was still well present in all sectors of the game for Port of Antwerp Giants. Nevertheless, BC Oostende remained in front at the half mainly thanks to a last rush and a tough defense played against the Antwerpse guards: 45-42.\n\nEarly in the third quarter, both teams hit great baskets and the game was tied again at 52-52. Playing a tough defense allowed BCO to take the lead again and the two repeated assists by Dusan Djordjevic to his Belgian mate Quentin Serron impressed many observers at the Heysel Palais 12. The Serbian guard was called a third personal foul right afterwards. Paul Vervaeck took a time-out at 58-53 after a dunk by BCO strong man Gregory Echenique (206-C-90, college: Creighton). The defending Belgian Cup winners of BC Oostende remained efficient while the Giants started to miss several attempts and forced some shots. Young talented Belgian international Quentin Serron even made 64-56 for BC Oostende right at the end of the third quarter, which was particularly marked by very low scoring (12-9).\n\nJean Salumu (193-F-90) from long range (two three-pointers in a row) and nice assists by Niels Marnegrave (191-PG-87) pushed BCO to a 72-61 lead. Only Maxime De Zeeuw could respond for the Giants. The score evolved always in favour of BC Oostende (79-68) even if Giants' Coach Paul Vervaeck tried to find solutions (79-72 and 86-74). Gregory Echenique ended several BCO actions with tremendous dunks. Niels Marnegrave (7 assists) and Dusan Djordjevic controlled the game and were excellent at playmaking. The fifth personal foul of Djordjevic with only 38 seconds left in the game did not change anything and Telenet BC Oostende eventually won 88-79. 11 players scored for BCO in this game while only 5 scorers were recorded on the Giants' side. It is the 15th Belgian Cup title won by BC Oostende (the first one was won in 1962) and the second in a row.\n\nDusan Djordjevic of BC Oostende earned the honorary title of Base Cup Final Four MVP and experienced captain Veselin Petrovic could lift the cup to the joy of the many BCO fans who attended the Base Cup final in Brussels.\n\nTelenet BC Oostende vs. Port of Antwerp Giants: 88-79\n\nScore evolution: 24-25, 50-47, 62-56 and 88-79.\n\nBest scorers:\n\nBCO: J. Berggren 6, Q. Serron 13, G. Echenique 10, R. Thompson 13, N. Marnegrave 2, V. Petrovic 2, W. Wilkinson 5, P.-A. Gillet 4, J. Salumu 6, M. Ponitka 8, D. Djordjevic 19.\n\nGiants: R. Moors 11, F. Turner 19, R. Pearson 20, B. Stewart 7, M. De Zeeuw 22."
