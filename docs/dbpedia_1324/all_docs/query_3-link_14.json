        "meta_description": "Abstract. Tsunamis caused by large volcanic eruptions and flanks collapsing into the\nsea are major hazards for nearby coastal regions. They often occur with\nlittle precursory activity and are thus challenging to detect in a timely\nmanner. This makes the pre-emptive identification of volcanoes prone to\ncausing tsunamis particularly important, as it allows for better hazard\nassessment and denser monitoring in these areas. Here, we present a\ncatalogue of potentially tsunamigenic volcanoes in Southeast Asia and rank\nthese volcanoes by their tsunami hazard. The ranking is based on a\nmulticriteria decision analysis (MCDA) composed of five individually\nweighted factors impacting flank stability and tsunami hazard. The data are sourced from geological databases, remote sensing data, historical volcano-induced tsunami records, and our topographic analyses, mainly considering the eruptive and tsunami history, elevation relative to the distance from the sea, flank steepness, hydrothermal alteration, and vegetation coverage. Out of 131 analysed volcanoes, we found 19 with particularly high\ntsunamigenic hazard potential in Indonesia (Anak Krakatau, Batu Tara,\nIliwerung, Gamalama, Sangeang Api, Karangetang, Sirung, Wetar, Nila, Ruang,\nSerua) and Papua New Guinea (Kadovar, Ritter Island, Rabaul, Manam, Langila, Ulawun, Bam) but also in the Philippines (Didicas). While some of these volcanoes, such as Anak Krakatau, are well known for their deadly tsunamis, many others on this list are lesser known and monitored. We further performed tsunami travel time modelling on these high-hazard volcanoes, which indicates that future events could affect large coastal areas in a short time. This highlights the importance of individual tsunami hazard assessment for these volcanoes, the importance of dedicated volcanological monitoring, and the need for increased preparedness on the potentially affected coasts.",

GonzÃ¡lez Vida, Manuel J. Castro DÃ­az, Fabrizio Romano, Hafize BaÅak Bayraktar, Andrey Babeyko, and Stefano Lorito\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-41,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-41, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModeling the tsunami generation due to a rapid submarine earthquake is a complex problem. We propose and test, under a variety of realistic conditions in a subduction zone, an efficient solution to this problem, and a tool which can compute the generation of any potential tsunami in any ocean of the world. We will explore in the future solutions which would allow us to model the tsunami generation also by slower (time-dependent) seafloor displacement.\n\nAnatomy of a fumarole field; drone remote sensing and petrological approaches reveal the degassing and alteration structure at La Fossa cone, Vulcano Island, Italy\n\nDaniel MÃ¼ller, Thomas R. Walter, Valentin R. Troll, Jessica Stammeier, Andreas Karlsson, Erica De Paolo, Antonino Fabio Pisciotta, Martin Zimmer, and Benjamin De Jarnatt\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1692,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1692, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use drone-based optical and infrared remote sensing to analyze a volcanic degassing system. Anomaly detection allows us to reveal the degassing and alteration structure, which will be evaluated by mineralogical and geochemical analysis. A comparison of the defined anomaly pattern to present-day diffuse degassing and the thermal pattern allows to constrain major active units and to constrain their contribution to the total activity. We provide a detailed anatomy of a degassing system.\n\nAPPLICATION OF SAR TIME-SERIES AND DEEP LEARNING FOR ESTIMATING LANDSLIDE OCCURRENCE TIME\n\nW. Wang, M. Motagh, S. Plank, A. Orynbaikyzy, and S. Roessner\n\nInt. Arch. Photogramm. Remote Sens. Spatial Inf.

Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 841–860, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-841-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-841-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrairie wetlands are important for biodiversity and water availability. Knowledge about their variability and spatial distribution is of great use in conservation and water resources management. In this study, we propose a novel approach for the classification of small water bodies from satellite radar images and apply it to our study area over 6 years. The retrieved dynamics show the different responses of small and large wetlands to dry and wet periods.\n\nVariable-resolution building exposure modelling for earthquake and tsunami scenario-based risk assessment: an application case in Lima, Peru\n\nJuan Camilo Gomez-Zapata, Nils Brinckmann, Sven Harig, Raquel Zafrir, Massimiliano Pittore, Fabrice Cotton, and Andrey Babeyko\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 3599–3628, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-3599-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-3599-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present variable-resolution boundaries based on central Voronoi tessellations (CVTs) to spatially aggregate building exposure models and physical vulnerability assessment. Their geo-cell sizes are inversely proportional to underlying distributions that account for the combination between hazard intensities and exposure proxies. We explore their efficiency and associated uncertainties in risk–loss estimations and mapping from decoupled scenario-based earthquakes and tsunamis in Lima, Peru.\n\nThermal UAS survey of reactivated hot spring activity in Waiwera, New Zealand\n\nMelissa PrÃ¤g, Ivy Becker, Christoph Hilgers, Thomas R. Walter, and Michael KÃ¼hn\n\nAdv. Geosci., 54, 165–171, https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-54-165-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-54-165-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUtilization of geothermal reservoirs as alternative energy source is becoming increasingly important worldwide. Here, we studied the surface expression of a warm water reservoir in Waiwera, New Zealand, that has been known for many centuries but remained little explored. Using thermal infrared cameras we were able to show renewed activity of the hot springs on the beachfront and identified faults and fractures as important fluid pathways, as well as individual fluid conducting lithologies.\n\nProcesses culminating in the 2015Â phreatic explosion at Lascar volcano, Chile, evidenced by multiparametric data\n\nAyleen Gaete, Thomas R. Walter, Stefan Bredemeyer, Martin Zimmer, Christian Kujawa, Luis Franco Marin, Juan San Martin, and Claudia Bucarey Parra\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 377–397, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-377-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-377-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPhreatic eruptions often occur without signs of enhanced volcanic unrest, avoiding detection and posing a threat to people in the vicinity. We analyzed data of the 2015 phreatic eruption of Lascar volcano, Chile, to retrospectively identify a precipitation event as the trigger mechanism and potential signs heralding this minor eruption. We showed that it is possible to detect the precursory activity of phreatic eruptions by deploying appropriate multiparametric monitoring.\n\nSinkholes and uvalas in evaporite karst: spatio-temporal development with links to base-level fall on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea\n\nRobert A. Watson, Eoghan P. Holohan, Djamil Al-Halbouni, Leila Saberi, Ali Sawarieh, Damien Closson, Hussam Alrshdan, Najib Abou Karaki, Christian Siebert, Thomas R. Walter, and Torsten Dahm\n\nSolid Earth, 10, 1451–1468, https://doi.org/10.5194/se-10-1451-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/se-10-1451-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe fall of the Dead Sea level since the 1960s has provoked the formation of over 6000 sinkholes, a major hazard to local economy and infrastructure. In this context, we study the evolution of subsidence phenomena at three area scales at the Dead Seaâs eastern shore from 1967–2017. Our results yield the most detailed insights to date into the spatio-temporal development of sinkholes and larger depressions (uvalas) in an evaporite karst setting and emphasize a link to the falling Dead Sea level.\n\nStructural weakening of the Merapi dome identified by drone photogrammetry after the 2010 eruption\n\nHerlan Darmawan, Thomas R. Walter, Valentin R. Troll, and Agus Budi-Santoso\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 18, 3267–3281, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-18-3267-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-18-3267-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAt Merapi volcano, lava dome failure may generate pyroclastic flow and threaten populations who live on its flanks. Here, we assessed the potential hazard of the Merapi lava dome by using drone photogrammetry and numerical modeling. Results show a weak structural depression that is associated with high thermal imaging in the southern Merapi lava dome sector. The southern lava dome sector may be further destabilized by typical rainfall at the Merapi summit and produce pyroclastic flow up to 4 km.\n\nInSAR observations of the 2009 Racha earthquake, Georgia\n\nElena Nikolaeva and Thomas R. Walter\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 16, 2137–2144, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-2137-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-2137-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study of active faults is relevant to estimate the seismic hazard of the surrounding area and relies on different methods. In the last decade interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques have proved to be robust tools to investigate the surface deformation caused by earthquakes. We used the multi-temporal ALOS L-band InSAR data to produce interferograms spanning times before and after the 2009 earthquake (Mwâ = 6.0) in the Racha region (Georgia).\n\nLava flow hazard at Fogo Volcano, Cabo Verde, before and after the 2014–2015 eruption\n\nNicole Richter, Massimiliano Favalli, Elske de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen, Alessandro Fornaciai, Rui Manuel da Silva Fernandes, Nemesio M. PÃ©rez, Judith Levy, SÃ³nia Silva VictÃ³ria, and Thomas R. Walter\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 16, 1925–1951, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-1925-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-1925-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide a comprehensive lava flow hazard assessment for Fogo volcano, Cabo Verde before and after the 2014â2015 eruption based on probabilistic lava flow simulations. We find that the probability of lava flow invasion has not decreased at the location of two villages that were destroyed during this eruption, but have already started to be rebuilt. Our findings will be important for the next eruption of Fogo volcano and have implications for future lava flow crises elsewhere in the world.\n\nProbabilistic tsunami hazard assessment for the Makran region with focus on maximum magnitude assumption\n\nAndreas Hoechner, Andrey Y. Babeyko, and Natalia Zamora\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 16, 1339–1350, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-1339-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-1339-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Makran subduction zone is not very active seismically, but nevertheless capable of hosting destructive earthquakes and tsunami, such as the Balochistan event in 1945, which led to about 4000 casualties. Some recent studies suggest that the maximum magnitude might be higher than previously thought. We generate a set of synthetic earthquake catalogs to compute tsunami hazard along the coast of Iran, Pakistan and Makran and show how different seismicity assumptions affect the hazard.\n\nThe ring-shaped thermal field of Stefanos crater, Nisyros Island: a conceptual model\n\nM.

Young, Ebru Kirezci, and Jin Liu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2175–2190, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2175-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2175-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper examines the changes in shoreline position of the coast of south-east Australia over a 26-year period to determine whether changes are consistent with observed changes in ocean wave and storm surge climate. The results show that in regions where there have been significant changes in wave energy flux or wave direction, there have also been changes in shoreline position consistent with non-equilibrium longshore drift.\n\nBrief communication: Implications of outstanding solitons for the occurrence of rogue waves at two additional sites in the North Sea\n\nIna Teutsch, Ralf Weisse, and Sander Wahls\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2065–2069, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2065-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2065-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate buoy and radar measurement data from shallow depths in the southern North Sea. We analyze the role of solitons for the occurrence of rogue waves. This is done by computing the nonlinear soliton spectrum of each time series. In a previous study that considered a single measurement site, we found a connection between the shape of the soliton spectrum and the occurrence of rogue waves. In this study, results for two additional sites are reported.\n\nA systemic and comprehensive assessment of coastal hazard changes: method and application to France and its overseas territories\n\nMarc Igigabel, Marissa Yates, Michalis Vousdoukas, and Youssef Diab\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1951–1974, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1951-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1951-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges in sea levels alone do not determine the evolution of coastal hazards. Coastal hazard changes should be assessed using additional factors describing geomorphological configurations, metocean event types (storms, cyclones, long swells, and tsunamis), and the marine environment (e.g., coral reef state and sea ice extent). The assessment completed here, at regional scale including the coasts of mainland and overseas France, highlights significant differences in hazard changes.\n\nSimulating sea level extremes from synthetic low-pressure systems\n\nJani SÃ¤rkkÃ¤, Jani RÃ¤ihÃ¤, Mika Rantanen, and Matti KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1835–1842, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1835-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1835-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the relationship between tracks of low-pressure systems and related sea level extremes. We perform the studies by introducing a method to simulate sea levels using synthetic low-pressure systems. We test the method using sites located along the Baltic Sea coast. We find high extremes, where the sea level extreme reaches up to 3.5 m. In addition, we add the maximal value of the mean level of the Baltic Sea (1 m), leading to a sea level of 4.5 m.\n\nNonlinear processes in tsunami simulations for the Peruvian coast with focus on Lima and Callao\n\nAlexey Androsov, Sven Harig, Natalia Zamora, Kim Knauer, and Natalja Rakowsky\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1635–1656, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1635-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1635-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTwo numerical codes are used in a comparative analysis of the calculation of the tsunami wave due to an earthquake along the Peruvian coast. The comparison primarily evaluates the flow velocity fields in flooded areas. The relative importance of the various parts of the equations is determined, focusing on the nonlinear terms. The influence of the nonlinearity on the degree and volume of flooding, flow velocity, and small-scale fluctuations is determined.\n\nThe potential of global coastal flood risk reduction using various DRR measures\n\nEric Mortensen, Timothy Tiggeloven, Toon Haer, Bas van Bemmel, Dewi Le Bars, Sanne Muis, Dirk Eilander, Frederiek Sperna Weiland, Arno Bouwman, Willem Ligtvoet, and Philip J. Ward\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

We evaluate dykes and coastal levees, foreshore vegetation, zoning restrictions, and dry-proofing on a global scale to estimate what levels of risk reductions are possible. We demonstrate that there are several potential adaptation pathways forward for certain areas of the world.\n\nModeling tsunami initial conditions due to rapid coseismic seafloor displacement: efficient numerical integration and a tool to build unit source databases\n\nAlice Abbate, JosÃ© M. GonzÃ¡lez Vida, Manuel J. Castro DÃ­az, Fabrizio Romano, Hafize BaÅak Bayraktar, Andrey Babeyko, and Stefano Lorito\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.

We propose and test, under a variety of realistic conditions in a subduction zone, an efficient solution to this problem, and a tool which can compute the generation of any potential tsunami in any ocean of the world. We will explore in the future solutions which would allow us to model the tsunami generation also by slower (time-dependent) seafloor displacement.\n\nThresholds for estuarine compound flooding using a combined hydrodynamicâstatistical modelling approach\n\nCharlotte Lyddon, Nguyen Chien, Grigorios Vasilopoulos, Michael Ridgill, Sogol Moradian, Agnieszka Olbert, Thomas Coulthard, Andrew Barkwith, and Peter Robins\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

We show the combinations of sea levels and river discharges that cause flooding in the Conwy estuary, N Wales. The results showed flooding was amplified under moderate conditions in the middle estuary and elsewhere sea state or river flow dominated the hazard. Combined sea and river thresholds can improve prediction and early warning of compound flooding.\n\nVolcano Tsunamis and their effects on moored vessels safety: The 2022 Tonga event\n\nSergio Padilla, ÃÃ±igo Aniel-Quiroga, Rachid Omira, Mauricio GonzÃ¡lez, Jihwan Kim, and Maria A. Baptista\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-663,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-663, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano in January 2022 triggered a global phenomenon, including an atmospheric wave and a volcano-meteorological tsunami (VMT). The tsunami, reaching as far as Callao, Peru, 10,000 km away, caused significant coastal impacts. A study delves into understanding these effects, particularly on vessel moorings safety. The findings underscore the importance of enhancing TWS and preparing port authorities for managing such rare events.\n\nNearshore tsunami amplitudes across the Maldives archipelago due to worst-case seismic scenarios in the Indian Ocean\n\nShuaib Rasheed, Simon C. Warder, Yves Plancherel, and Matthew D. Piggott\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 737–755, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-737-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-737-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we use a high-resolution bathymetry dataset of the Maldives archipelago, as well as corresponding high numerical model resolution, to carry out a scenario-based tsunami hazard assessment for the entire Maldives archipelago to investigate the potential impact of plausible far-field tsunamis across the Indian Ocean at the island scale. The results indicate that several factors contribute to mitigating and amplifying tsunami waves at the island scale.\n\nEvidence of Middle Holocene landslide-generated tsunamis recorded in lake sediments from Saqqaq, West Greenland\n\nNiels J. Korsgaard, Kristian Svennevig, Anne S. SÃ¸ndergaard, Gregor Luetzenburg, Mimmi Oksman, and Nicolaj K. Larsen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 757–772, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-757-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-757-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA tsunami wave will leave evidence of erosion and deposition in coastal lakes, making it possible to determine the runup height and when it occurred. Here, we use four lakes now located at elevations of 19–91 m a.s.l. close to the settlement of Saqqaq, West Greenland, to show that at least two giant tsunamis occurred 7300–7600 years ago with runup heights larger than 40 m. We infer that any tsunamis from at least nine giga-scale landslides must have happened 8500–10 000 years ago.\n\nInvestigation of historical severe storms and storm tides in the German Bight with century reanalysis data\n\nElke Magda Inge Meyer and Lidia Gaslikova\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 481–499, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-481-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-481-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStorm tides for eight extreme historical storms in the German Bight are modelled using sets of slightly varying atmospheric conditions from the century reanalyses. Comparisons with the water level observations from the gauges Norderney, Cuxhaven and Husum show that single members of the reanalyses are suitable for the reconstruction of extreme storms. Storms with more northerly tracks show less variability within a set and have more potential for accurate reconstruction of extreme water levels.\n\nRevisiting regression methods for estimating long-term trends in sea surface temperature\n\nMing-Huei Chang, Yen-Chen Huang, Yu-Hsin Cheng, Chuen-Teyr Terng, Jinyi Chen, and Jyh Cherng Jan\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-218,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-218, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMonitoring the long-term trends in sea surface warming is crucial for informed decision-making and adaptation. This study offers a comprehensive examination of prevalent trend extraction methods. We identify ordinary least squares as suitable for general tasks yet highlight the need to address seasonal signal-induced bias, specifically the phase-distance imbalance. Our implementation, evaluated with simulated and realist data, provides a potential solution.\n\nTsunami Hazard Assessment in the South China Sea Based on Geodetic Locking of the Manila Subduction Zone\n\nGuangsheng Zhao and Xiaojing Niu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-227,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-227, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe purpose of this study is to estimate the spatial distribution of the tsunami hazard in the South China Sea from the Manila subduction zone. The plate motion data is used to invert the degree of locking on the fault plane. The degree of locking is used to estimate the maximum possible magnitude of earthquakes and describe the slip distribution. A spatial distribution map of the 1000-year return period tsunami wave height in the South China Sea was obtained by tsunami hazard assessment.\n\nProposal for a new meteotsunami intensity index\n\nClare Lewis, Tim Smyth, Jess Neumann, and Hannah Cloke\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 121–131, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-121-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-121-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeteotsunami are the result of atmospheric disturbances and can impact coastlines causing injury, loss of life, and damage to assets. This paper introduces a novel intensity index to allow for the quantification of these events at the shoreline. This has the potential to assist in the field of natural hazard assessment. It was trialled in the UK but designed for global applicability and to become a widely accepted standard in coastal planning, meteotsunami forecasting, and early warning systems.\n\nTotal water levels along the South Atlantic Bight during three along-shelf propagating tropical cyclones: relative contributions of storm surge and wave runup\n\nChu-En Hsu, Katherine A. Serafin, Xiao Yu, Christie A. Hegermiller, John C. Warner, and Maitane Olabarrieta\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3895–3912, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3895-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3895-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTotal water levels (TWLs) induced by tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the leading hazards faced by coastal communities. Using numerical models, we examined how TWL components (surge and wave runup) along the South Atlantic Bight varied during hurricanes Matthew (2016), Dorian (2019), and Isaias (2020). Peak surge and peak wave runup were dominated by wind speeds and relative positions to TCs. The exceedance time of TWLs was controlled by normalized distances to TC and TC translation speeds.\n\nHurricane Irma: an unprecedented event over the last 3700Â years?

Sci., 23, 3761–3788, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3761-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3761-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work documents the impact of Hurricane Irma (2017) on the Codrington barrier and lagoon on Barbuda Island. Irma caused two wide breaches in the sandy barrier, which remained unopened for 250 years. The thick and extensive sand sheet at the top of the lagoon fill was attributed to Irma. This unique deposit in a 3700-year record confirms Irma's exceptional character. This case study illustrates the consequences of high-intensity hurricanes in low-lying islands in a global warming context.\n\nBayesian extreme value analysis of extreme sea levels along the German Baltic coast using historical information\n\nLeigh Richard MacPherson, Arne Arns, Svenja Fischer, Fernando Javier MÃ©ndez, and JÃ¼rgen Jensen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3685–3701, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3685-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3685-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEfficient adaptation planning for coastal flooding caused by extreme sea levels requires accurate assessments of the underlying hazard. Tide-gauge data alone are often insufficient for providing the desired accuracy but may be supplemented with historical information. We estimate extreme sea levels along the German Baltic coast and show that relying solely on tide-gauge data leads to underestimations. Incorporating historical information leads to improved estimates with reduced uncertainties.\n\nStorm characteristics influence nitrogen removal in an urban estuarine environment\n\nAnne Margaret H. Smiley, Suzanne P. Thompson, Nathan S. Hall, and Michael F. Piehler\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3635–3649, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3635-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3635-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFloodwaters can deliver reactive nitrogen to sensitive aquatic systems and diminish water quality. We assessed the nitrogen removal capabilities of flooded habitats and urban landscapes. Differences in processing rates across land cover treatments and between nutrient treatments suggest that abundance and spatial distributions of habitats, as well as storm characteristics, influence landscape-scale nitrogen removal. Results have important implications for coastal development and climate change.\n\nA new European coastal flood database for lowâmedium intensity events\n\nMarine Le Gal, TomÃ¡s FernÃ¡ndez-Montblanc, Enrico Duo, Juan Montes Perez, Paulo Cabrita, Paola Souto Ceccon, VÃ©ra Gastal, Paolo Ciavola, and Clara Armaroli\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3585–3602, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3585-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3585-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAssessing coastal hazards is crucial to mitigate flooding disasters. In this regard, coastal flood databases are valuable tools. This paper describes a new coastal flood map catalogue covering the entire European coastline, as well as the methodology to build it and its accuracy. The catalogue focuses on frequent extreme events and relies on synthetic scenarios estimated from local storm conditions. Flood-prone areas and regions sensitive to storm duration and water level peak were identified.\n\nBoulder transport and wave height of a seventeenth-century South China Sea tsunami on Penghu Islands, Taiwan\n\nNeng-Ti Yu, Cheng-Hao Lu, I-Chin Yen, Jia-Hong Chen, Jiun-Yee Yen, and Shyh-Jeng Chyi\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3525–3542, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3525-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3525-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA paleotsunami deposit of cliff-top basalt debris was identified on the Penghu Islands in the southern Taiwan Strait and related to the 1661 earthquake in southwest Taiwan. A minimum wave height of 3.2 m is estimated to have rotated the biggest boulder for over 30 m landwards onto the cliff top at 2.5 m a.s.l. The event must have been huge compared to the 1994 M 6.4 earthquake with the ensuing 0.4 m high tsunami in the same area, validating the intimidating tsunami risks in the South China Sea.\n\nA wave-resolving modeling study of rip current variability, rip hazard, and swimmer escape strategies on an embayed beach\n\nYe Yuan, Huaiwei Yang, Fujiang Yu, Yi Gao, Benxia Li, and Chuang Xing\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3487–3507, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3487-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3487-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRip currents are narrow jets of offshore-directed flow that originated in the surf zone, which can take swimmers of all ability levels into deeper water unawares. In this study, a 1 m fine-resolution wave-resolving model was configured to study rip current variability and the optimal swimmer escape strategies. Multiple factors contribute to the survival of swimmers. However, for weak-to-moderate rip and longshore currents, swimming onshore consistently seems to be the most successful strategy.\n\nHuman displacements from Tropical Cyclone Idai attributable to climate change\n\nBenedikt Mester, Thomas Vogt, Seth Bryant, Christian Otto, Katja Frieler, and Jacob Schewe\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3467–3485, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3467-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3467-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn 2019, Cyclone Idai displaced more than 478 000 people in Mozambique. In our study, we use coastal flood modeling and satellite imagery to construct a counterfactual cyclone event without the effects of climate change. We show that 12 600–14 900 displacements can be attributed to sea level rise and the intensification of storm wind speeds due to global warming. Our impact attribution study is the first one on human displacement and one of very few for a low-income country.\n\nGlobal application of a regional frequency analysis on extreme sea levels\n\nThomas P. Collings, Niall D. Quinn, Ivan D. Haigh, Joshua Green, Izzy Probyn, Hamish Wilkinson, Sanne Muis, William V. Sweet, and Paul D. Bates\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2267,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2267, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal areas are at risk of flooding from rising sea levels and extreme weather events. This study uses a new way to figure out how likely coastal flooding is around the world. The method uses data from observations and computer models to create a detailed map of where these floods might happen at the coast. The approach can predict flooding in areas where there is little or no data. The results can be used to help get ready for and prevent this type of flooding.\n\nEstuarine hurricane wind can intensify surge-dominated extreme water level in shallow and converging coastal systems\n\nMithun Deb, James Benedict, Ning Sun, Zhaoqing Yang, Robert Hetland, David Judi, and Taiping Wang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2134,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2134, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe coupled earth system, hydrology, and hydrodynamic models to generate plausible and physically consistent ensembles of hurricane events and their associated water levels from the open coast to tidal rivers of Delaware Bay and River. Our results show that the hurricane landfall locations and the estuarine wind can significantly amplify the extreme surge in a shallow and converging system, especially when the wind direction aligns with the surge propagation direction.\n\nThree decades of coastal subsidence in the slow-moving Nice CÃ´te d'Azur Airport area (France) revealed by InSAR (interferometric synthetic-aperture radar): insights into the deformation mechanism\n\nOlivier CavaliÃ©, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Cappa, and BÃ©atrice Pinel-PuyssÃ©gur\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3235–3246, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3235-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3235-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal areas are fragile ecosystems that face multiple hazards. In this study, we measured the downward motion of the Nice Côte d'Azur Airport (France) that was built on reclaimed area and found that it has subsided from 16 mm yr-1 in the 1990s to 8 mm yr-1 today. A continuous remote monitoring of the platform will provide key data for a detailed investigation of future subsidence maps, and this contribution will help to evaluate the potential failure of part of the airport platform.\n\nModelling extreme water levels using intertidal topography and bathymetry derived from multispectral satellite images\n\nWagner L. L. Costa, Karin R. Bryan, and Giovanni Coco\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3125–3146, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3125-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3125-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor predicting flooding events at the coast, topo-bathymetric data are essential. However, elevation data can be unavailable. To tackle this issue, recent efforts have centred on the use of satellite-derived topography (SDT) and bathymetry (SDB). This work is aimed at evaluating their accuracy and use for flooding prediction in enclosed estuaries. Results show that the use of SDT and SDB in numerical modelling can produce similar predictions when compared to the surveyed elevation data.\n\nRegional assessment of extreme sea levels and associated coastal flooding along the German Baltic Sea coast\n\nJoshua Kiesel, Marvin Lorenz, Marcel KÃ¶nig, Ulf GrÃ¤we, and Athanasios T. Vafeidis\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2961–2985, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2961-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2961-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmong the Baltic Sea littoral states, Germany is anticipated to experience considerable damage as a result of increased coastal flooding due to sea-level rise (SLR). Here we apply a new modelling framework to simulate how flooding along the German Baltic Sea coast may change until 2100 if dikes are not upgraded. We find that the study region is highly exposed to flooding, and we emphasise the importance of current plans to update coastal protection in the future.\n\nJoint probability analysis of storm surges and waves caused by tropical cyclones for the estimation of protection standard: a case study on the eastern coast of the Leizhou Peninsula and the island of Hainan in China\n\nZhang Haixia, Cheng Meng, and Fang Weihua\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2697–2717, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2697-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2697-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSimultaneous storm surge and waves can cause great damage due to cascading effects. Quantitative joint probability analysis is critical to determine their optimal protection design values. The joint probability of the surge and wave for the eastern coasts of Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan are estimated with a Gumbel copula based on 62 years of numerically simulated data, and the optimal design values under various joint return periods are derived using the non-linear programming method.\n\nMeteotsunami in the United Kingdom: the hidden hazard\n\nClare Lewis, Tim Smyth, David Williams, Jess Neumann, and Hannah Cloke\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2531–2546, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2531-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2531-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeteotsunami are globally occurring water waves initiated by atmospheric disturbances. Previous research has suggested that in the UK, meteotsunami are a rare phenomenon and tend to occur in the summer months. This article presents a revised and updated catalogue of 98 meteotsunami that occurred between 1750 and 2022. Results also demonstrate a larger percentage of winter events and a geographical pattern highlighting the hotspot regions that experience these events.\n\nClimate-induced storminess forces major increases in future storm surge hazard in the South China Sea region\n\nMelissa Wood, Ivan D. Haigh, Quan Quan Le, Hung Nghia Nguyen, Hoang Ba Tran, Stephen E. Darby, Robert Marsh, Nikolaos Skliris, JoÃ«l J.-M. Hirschi, Robert J. Nicholls, and Nadia Bloemendaal\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2475–2504, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2475-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2475-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used a novel database of simulated tropical cyclone tracks to explore whether typhoon-induced storm surges present a future flood risk to low-lying coastal communities around the South China Sea. We found that future climate change is likely to change tropical cyclone behaviour to an extent that this increases the severity and frequency of storm surges to Vietnam, southern China, and Thailand. Consequently, coastal flood defences need to be reviewed for resilience against this future hazard.\n\nAssessing Typhoon Soulik-induced morphodynamics over the Mokpo coastal region in South Korea based on a geospatial approach\n\nSang-Guk Yum, Moon-Soo Song, and Manik Das Adhikari\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2449–2474, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2449-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2449-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study performed analysis on typhoon-induced coastal morphodynamics for the Mokpo coast. Wetland vegetation was severely impacted by Typhoon Soulik, with 87.35 % of shoreline transects experiencing seaward migration. This result highlights the fact that sediment resuspension controls the land alteration process over the typhoon period. The land accretion process dominated during the pre- to post-typhoon periods.\n\nBayesian hierarchical modelling of sea-level extremes in the Finnish coastal region\n\nOlle RÃ¤ty, Marko Laine, Ulpu Leijala, Jani SÃ¤rkkÃ¤, and Milla M. Johansson\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2403–2418, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2403-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2403-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied annual maximum sea levels in the Finnish coastal region. Our aim was to better quantify the uncertainty in them compared to previous studies. Using four statistical models, we found out that hierarchical models, which shared information on sea-level extremes across Finnish tide gauges, had lower uncertainty in their results in comparison with tide-gauge-specific fits. These models also suggested that the shape of the distribution for extreme sea levels is similar on the Finnish coast.\n\nAssessing the coastal hazard of Medicane Ianos through ensemble modelling\n\nChristian Ferrarin, Florian Pantillon, Silvio Davolio, Marco Bajo, Mario Marcello Miglietta, Elenio Avolio, Diego S. CarriÃ³, Ioannis Pytharoulis, Claudio Sanchez, Platon Patlakas, Juan JesÃºs GonzÃ¡lez-AlemÃ¡n, and Emmanouil Flaounas\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2273–2287, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2273-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2273-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe combined use of meteorological and ocean models enabled the analysis of extreme sea conditions driven by Medicane Ianos, which hit the western coast of Greece on 18 September 2020, flooding and damaging the coast. The large spread associated with the ensemble highlighted the high model uncertainty in simulating such an extreme weather event. The different simulations have been used for outlining hazard scenarios that represent a fundamental component of the coastal risk assessment.\n\nA predictive equation for wave setup using genetic programming\n\nCharline Dalinghaus, Giovanni Coco, and Pablo Higuera\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2157–2169, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2157-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2157-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWave setup is a critical component of coastal flooding. Consequently, understanding and being able to predict wave setup is vital to protect coastal resources and the population living near the shore. Here, we applied machine learning to improve the accuracy of present predictors of wave setup. The results show that the new predictors outperform existing formulas demonstrating the capability of machine learning models to provide a physically sound description of wave setup.\n\nContribution of solitons to enhanced rogue wave occurrence in shallow depths: a case study in the southern North Sea\n\nIna Teutsch, Markus BrÃ¼hl, Ralf Weisse, and Sander Wahls\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2053–2073, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2053-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2053-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRogue waves exceed twice the significant wave height. They occur more often than expected in the shallow waters off Norderney. When applying a nonlinear Fourier transform for the Korteweg–de Vries equation to wave data from Norderney, we found differences in the soliton spectra of time series with and without rogue waves. A strongly outstanding soliton in the spectrum indicated an enhanced probability for rogue waves. We could attribute spectral solitons to the measured rogue waves.\n\nCompound flood events: analysing the joint occurrence of extreme river discharge events and storm surges in northern and central Europe\n\nPhilipp Heinrich, Stefan Hagemann, Ralf Weisse, Corinna Schrum, Ute Daewel, and Lidia Gaslikova\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1967–1985, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1967-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1967-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh seawater levels co-occurring with high river discharges have the potential to cause destructive flooding. For the past decades, the number of such compound events was larger than expected by pure chance for most of the west-facing coasts in Europe. Additionally rivers with smaller catchments showed higher numbers. In most cases, such events were associated with a large-scale weather pattern characterized by westerly winds and strong rainfall.\n\nImprovements to the detection and analysis of external surges in the North Sea\n\nAlexander BÃ¶hme, Birgit Gerkensmeier, Benedikt Bratz, Clemens Krautwald, Olaf MÃ¼ller, Nils Goseberg, and Gabriele GÃ¶nnert\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1947–1966, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1947-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1947-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExternal surges in the North Sea are caused by low-pressure cells travelling over the northeast Atlantic. They influence extreme water levels on the German coast and have to be considered in the design process of coastal defence structures. This study collects data about external surges from 1995–2020 and analyses their causes, behaviours and potential trends. External surges often occur less than 72 h apart, enabling a single storm surge to be influenced by more than one external surge.\n\nOptimal probabilistic placement of facilities using a surrogate model for 3D tsunami simulations\n\nKenta Tozato, Shuji Moriguchi, Shinsuke Takase, Yu Otake, Michael R. Motley, Anawat Suppasri, and Kenjiro Terada\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1891–1909, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1891-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1891-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents a framework that efficiently investigates the optimal placement of facilities probabilistically based on advanced numerical simulation. Surrogate models for the numerical simulation are constructed using a mode decomposition technique. Monte Carlo simulations using the surrogate models are performed to evaluate failure probabilities. Using the results of the Monte Carlo simulations and the genetic algorithm, optimal placements can be investigated probabilistically.\n\nEnabling dynamic modelling of coastal flooding by defining storm tide hydrographs\n\nJob C. M. Dullaart, Sanne Muis, Hans de Moel, Philip J. Ward, Dirk Eilander, and Jeroen C. J. H. Aerts\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1847–1862, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1847-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1847-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal flooding is driven by storm surges and high tides and can be devastating. To gain an understanding of the threat posed by coastal flooding and to identify areas that are especially at risk, now and in the future, it is crucial to accurately model coastal inundation and assess the coastal flood hazard. Here, we present a global dataset with hydrographs that represent the typical evolution of an extreme sea level. These can be used to model coastal inundation more accurately.\n\nThe role of preconditioning for extreme storm surges in the western Baltic Sea\n\nElin AndrÃ©e, Jian Su, Morten Andreas Dahl Larsen, Martin Drews, Martin Stendel, and Kristine Skovgaard Madsen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1817–1834, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1817-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1817-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen natural processes interact, they may compound each other. The combined effect can amplify extreme sea levels, such as when a storm occurs at a time when the water level is already higher than usual. We used numerical modelling of a record-breaking storm surge in 1872 to show that other prior sea-level conditions could have further worsened the outcome. Our research highlights the need to consider the physical context of extreme sea levels in measures to reduce coastal flood risk.\n\nFreak wave events in 2005â2021: statistics and analysis of favourable wave and wind conditions\n\nEkaterina Didenkulova, Ira Didenkulova, and Igor Medvedev\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1653–1663, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1653-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1653-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper is dedicated to freak wave accidents which happened in the world ocean in 2005–2021 and that were described in mass media sources. The database accounts for 429 events, all of which resulted in ship or coastal and offshore structure damage and/or human losses. In agreement with each freak wave event, we put background wave and wind conditions extracted from the climate reanalysis ERA5. We analyse their statistics and discuss the favourable conditions for freak wave occurrence.\n\nProbabilistic projections and past trends of sea level rise in Finland\n\nHavu Pellikka, Milla M. Johansson, Maaria Nordman, and Kimmo Ruosteenoja\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1613–1630, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1613-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1613-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe explore the rate of past and future sea level rise at the Finnish coast, northeastern Baltic Sea, in 1901–2100. For this analysis, we use tide gauge observations, modelling results, and a probabilistic method to combine information from several sea level rise projections. We provide projections of local mean sea level by 2100 as probability distributions. The results can be used in adaptation planning in various sectors with different risk tolerance, e.g. land use planning or nuclear safety.\n\nThe effect of deep ocean currents on ocean- bottom seismometers records\n\nCarlos Corela, Afonso Loureiro, JosÃ© Luis Duarte, Luis Matias, Tiago Rebelo, and Tiago Bartolomeu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1433–1451, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1433-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1433-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show that ocean-bottom seismometers are controlled by bottom currents, but these are not always a function of the tidal forcing. Instead we suggest that the ocean bottom has a flow regime resulting from two possible contributions: the permanent low-frequency bottom current and the tidal current along the full tidal cycle, between neap and spring tides. In the short-period noise band the ocean current generates harmonic tremors that corrupt the dataset records.\n\nAn interdisciplinary agent-based evacuation model: integrating the natural environment, built environment, and social system for community preparedness and resilience\n\nChen Chen, Charles Koll, Haizhong Wang, and Michael K. Lindell\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 733–749, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-733-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-733-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper uses empirical-data-based simulation to analyze how to evacuate efficiently from disasters. We find that departure delay time and evacuation decision have significant impacts on evacuation results. Evacuation results are more sensitive to walking speed, departure delay time, evacuation participation, and destinations than to other variables. This model can help authorities to prioritize resources for hazard education, community disaster preparedness, and resilience plans.\n\nCoastal extreme sea levels in the Caribbean Sea induced by tropical cyclones\n\nAriadna MartÃ­n, Angel Amores, Alejandro Orfila, Tim Toomey, and Marta Marcos\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 587–600, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-587-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-587-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTropical cyclones (TCs) are among the potentially most hazardous phenomena affecting the coasts of the Caribbean Sea. This work simulates the coastal hazards in terms of sea surface elevation and waves that originate through the passage of these events. A set of 1000 TCs have been simulated, obtained from a set of synthetic cyclones that are consistent with present-day climate. Given the large number of hurricanes used, robust values of extreme sea levels and waves are computed along the coasts.\n\nCharacteristics of consecutive tsunamis and resulting tsunami behaviors in southern Taiwan induced by the Hengchun earthquake doublet on 26 December 2006\n\nAn-Chi Cheng, Anawat Suppasri, Kwanchai Pakoksung, and Fumihiko Imamura\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 447–479, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-447-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-447-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nConsecutive earthquakes occurred offshore of southern Taiwan on 26 December 2006. This event revealed unusual tsunami generation and propagation, as well as unexpected consequences for the southern Taiwanese coast (i.e., amplified waves and prolonged durations). This study aims to elucidate the source characteristics of the 2006 tsunami and the important behaviors responsible for tsunami hazards in Taiwan such as wave trapping and shelf resonance.\n\nPotential tsunami hazard of the southern Vanuatu subduction zone: tectonics, case study of the Matthew Island tsunami of 10Â February 2021 and implication in regional hazard assessment\n\nJean Roger, Bernard Pelletier, Aditya Gusman, William Power, Xiaoming Wang, David Burbidge, and Maxime Duphil\n\nNat.

Sci., 23, 393–414, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-393-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-393-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOn 10 February 2021 a magnitude 7.7 earthquake occurring at the southernmost part of the Vanuatu subduction zone triggered a regional tsunami that was recorded on many coastal gauges and DART stations of the south-west Pacific region. Beginning with a review of the tectonic setup and its implication in terms of tsunami generation in the region, this study aims to show our ability to reproduce a small tsunami with different types of rupture models and to discuss a larger magnitude 8.2 scenario.\n\nDetecting anomalous sea-level states in North Sea tide gauge data using an autoassociative neural network\n\nKathrin Wahle, Emil V. Stanev, and Joanna Staneva\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 415–428, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-415-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-415-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKnowledge of what causes maximum water levels is often key in coastal management. Processes, such as storm surge and atmospheric forcing, alter the predicted tide. Whilst most of these processes are modeled in present-day ocean forecasting, there is still a need for a better understanding of situations where modeled and observed water levels deviate from each other. Here, we will use machine learning to detect such anomalies within a network of sea-level observations in the North Sea.\n\nObservations of extreme wave runup events on the US Pacific Northwest coast\n\nChuan Li, H. Tuba Ãzkan-Haller, Gabriel GarcÃ­a Medina, Robert A. Holman, Peter Ruggiero, Treena M. Jensen, David B. Elson, and William R. Schneider\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 107–126, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-107-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-107-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we examine a set of observed extreme, non-earthquake-related and non-landslide-related wave runup events. Runup events with similar characteristics have previously been attributed to trapped waves, atmospheric disturbances, and abrupt breaking of long waves. However, we find that none of these mechanisms were likely at work in the observations we examined. We show that instead, these runup events were more likely due to energetic growth of bound infragravity waves.\n\nCited articles\n\nAirbus: Copernicus DEM Validation Report (v2.1), https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/documents/20126/0/GEO1988-CopernicusDEM-SPE-002_ProductHandbook_I1.00.pdf (last access: 19Â September 2022), 2020.â\n\nAnnunziato, A., Prasetya, G., and Husrin, S.: Anak Krakatau volcano emergency tsunami early warning system, Science of Tsunami Hazards, 38, 68â95, ISSNÂ 8755-6839, 2019.â\n\nBadriana, M.
