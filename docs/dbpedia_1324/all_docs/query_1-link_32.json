        "text": "Loukas Mavrokefalidis signed a contract until the end of the season with Ionikos BC, the greek team announced.\n\nThe veteran big man started the year with Peristeri, where he played 4 games (12.2 p, 5.5 r).\n\nRussian powerhouse Lokomotiv Kuban wants to sign Gabriel Lundberg from Zielona Gora and made an offer to the player, a source told Sportando.\n\nThe Danish player is shining this season in both VTB League and PLK averaging 16.8ppg, 4.1rpg and 6.5apg in domestic league and 19.7ppg, 3.1rpg and 5.5apg in European Cup.\n\nVirtus Bologna CEO Luca Baraldi said that Stefan Markovic will not be neither excused from team activities nor be waived after his story on Instagram following Aleksandar Djordjevic’s firing late on Monday.\n\n“He will be fined but we are not waiving or excusing him from team activities” Baraldi said.\n\nLess than 24 hours after firing him, Virtus Bologna decided to keep Sasha Djordjevic.\n\nThe coach had a meeting with the management of Virtus Bologna today and the two sides decided to continue together.\n\nDjordjevic joined Virtus early in 2019 and won one Basketball Champions League.\n\nVirtus Bologna started searching on the market the new head coach for the current season after firing Sasha Djordjevic late on Monday.\n\nThe options were Luca Banchi, Sergio Scariolo and Zeljko Obradovic but none of them seems ready and available to join the club anytime soon.\n\nFor this reason one of the options to replace Sasha Djordjevic at the helm of the bench is…Sasha Djordjevic, as reported by Daniele Labanti.\n\nDjordjevic is now in the gym meeting the front office of Virtus Bologna that fired him yesterday.\n\nOn Sunday, Koper Primorska due to an unfortunate situation probably played their last game ever. As his agent Matej Mamić told Sportando, 25-year old Erjon Kastrati is already actively looking for a new team. Kosovo NT member is averaging 11.8 points and 4 rebounds per game in the ABA league and scoring 18.1 points per game in the Slovenian league this season.\n\nThe end of an era? After 60 years of history, Virtus Roma is close to disappearing.\n\nThe club from the Italian capital will have -3 points in the standing for paying the Federation Fee late but today the owner Claudio Toti is expected to withdraw Virtus Roma from Italian Serie A.\n\nThe negotiations with the American group interested in buying the club have stalled over the last days and, as reported by Il Corriere dello Sport, Claudio Toti will withdraw the team from Serie A, barring a very unlikely twist, putting an end to a sporting agony that those who care about Virtus’s fate did not deserve.\n\nIf the club withdraws from Serie A, all the players will be free to leave.\n\nStefan Markovic’s future in Bologna is at risk but also Milos Teodosic is under scrutiny, according to several reports from the Italian press.\n\nTeodosic moved to Bologna in the summer of 2018 signing a multi-year contract but after Djordjevic’s firing and due to some performances not up to expectations, the Serbian star is at risk, like his teammates.\n\nAccording to several reports from Italian media, Stefan Markovic is at risk of being kicked out by Virtus Bologna after his post on Instagram after Sasha Djordjevic’s firing.\n\nStefan Markovic criticizes Virtus Bologna’s decision to fire Sasha Djordjevic\n\nLa Gazzetta dello Sport writes that Markovic is almost out of the team while Tuttosport reports that the Serbian is not liked a lot by his teammates.\n\nThe Serbian guard joined Virtus Bologna in the summer of 2019.\n\nThe South East Melbourne Phoenix have announced the signing of high-flying American point guard Keifer Sykes as their second import on a one-year deal.\n\nThe 26-year-old Chicago native has played for a number of clubs across the world – most recently at EuroLeague giants Panathinaikos – since finishing a stellar college career at Green Bay.\n\nHe’s also represented Cleveland, Golden State and Denver at the NBA Summer League, and the Austin Spurs in the NBA G-League.\n\nSykes won two Horizon League Player of the Year awards at college, has led the Turkish Basketball League in scoring, and averaged over 28 points in China.\n\nHe says winning an NBL title with the Phoenix is the driving factor behind his latest move.\n\n“I just believed that this was my best chance to win a championship,” Sykes said.\n\n“I came over here to be a point guard, to lead, and to win. My number one thing I want to always do is win.\n\n“I think the NBL will bring out the best in all of my abilities and that’s why I’m excited to be here. I just want to win at the end of the day and take this team to the playoffs and see how far we can go.”\n\nThe 5’11 (180cm) point guard is known for his elite athleticism and jaw-dropping dunks, having participated in multiple dunk contests over his career.\n\n“I like to play an exciting style of basketball; dunks and plays that people have never seen,” he said.\n\n“I’m excited to meet the fans, meet the team, meet the staff, and I’m just excited for this season.”\n\nSykes joins star forward Mitch Creek, fellow Chicago import Ben Moore and Australian Boomer Cam Gliddon in an exciting Phoenix line-up.\n\nPhoenix Head Coach Simon Mitchell first saw Sykes play in Las Vegas in 2018 when he was travelling as an assistant coach with Melbourne United and said the guard “dominated the session” and “terrified opposition guards”.\n\nMitchell and Phoenix CEO Tommy Greer watched him play with the Denver Nuggets in the NBA Summer League last year and sparked a mutual interest with the guard, now coming into fruition a year on.\n\n“I love his speed, quickness, and tenacity. It stands out on both sides of the ball,” Mitchell said.\n\n“His ability to score or deliver to teammates out of the pick and roll is exceptional and will be enhanced with the shooting we will be putting on the floor with him. He also has that next level athletic ability when he gets into the paint.\n\n“Most importantly, from our discussions, Keifer just talks about winning and his willingness to do whatever it will take to win.”\n\nPhoenix CEO Tommy Greer added: “Keifer is an incredibly talented and exciting player who we’ve had our eyes on for a while now, so it’s fantastic to secure him as the final piece of our roster.\n\n“With Keifer’s inclusion adding to what we believe is already a really strong squad, we have high hopes of making a finals push and shaking things up in our second season.”\n\nSykes is currently quarantining in Sydney and is set to arrive in Melbourne and will join the team’s NBL21 preparations in mid-to-late December.\n\nThe Phoenix roster now includes Keifer Sykes (import), Ben Moore (import), Mitch Creek, Cam Gliddon, Reuben Te Rangi, Kyle Adnam, Dane Pineau, Kendall Stephens, Yanni Wetzell, Adam Gibson, Izayah Le’afa (development player), Tristan Forsyth (development player).\n\nThe club’s main roster is now complete, with an optional ‘Next Star’ prospect the only possible addition.\n\nESPN’s Olgun Uluc reports that the NBL has rescinded Nahziah Carter’s deal with Melbourne United after it became public that an investigation from the University of Washington alleged that he sexually assaulted two students.\n\nCarter was suspended from the university’s basketball team activities in October for violating the Intercollegiate Athletics Code of Conduct. After announcing on Dec. 4 that he would pursue a pro career, it was reported Carter was finalizing a deal to join Melbourne United as a Next Stars player. That deal is now ‘off the table’, per Uluc.\n\nItalian and Basketball Champions League side Fortitudo Bologna is expected to announce soon the firing of coach Meo Sacchetti, a source told Sportando.\n\nItaly NT coach arrived at Fortitudo earlier this year, but went on to win just one game out of 10 between LBA and BCL. Yesterday’s loss against Brescia was the 7th consecutive loss for the Italian side between league and cup."
