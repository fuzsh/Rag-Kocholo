        "text": "Dear Network, I am excited to share that I will be looking for new opportunities, available from June onward in Amsterdam or globally! ðŸŒŽ I am a big believer in the power of networking, so I would love to hear from you if you see how my previous experience and current drive for new challenges could fit into your organization or an organization you know. What I bring: - 5+ years of diverse international experience across Europe, Australia, and Asia, working in the impact & innovation space (startups, business accelerator/VCâ€¦) - A passion for building high-value client relationships and partnerships - A commitment to integrating innovation and impact into every business strategy - An interest and commitment to sustainability, with previous experience in verticals such as Energy, FinTech, Mobility, and Gender Equality My experience and areas I want to explore further: -Partnerships and Stakeholder Management -Business Development and Sales -Research and Consultancy -Strategic Communication and Events -Project Management I am interested in exploring different commercial roles such as partnerships, account management, investor/corporate relations, as well as research and consultancy. However, I am not fixated on the role type or location, but much more on the mission of the company and the growth opportunity it brings. Letâ€™s connect! ðŸ’«\n\nHappy International Womenâ€™s Day to all the incredible women out there! ðŸ¤— Today, and every day, it's crucial to strive for gender equality in both our personal and professional lives. There's a pressing need for change, and one way to understand this urgency is by looking at the numbers. In the financial sector, women hold only 4% of senior board positions in the Netherlands. Despite legislative efforts and various initiatives, progress remains slow. That's why we have been working on a research project to understand why so many talented women are leaving the finance industry at alarming rates. These women are driven, ambitious, and willing to put in the hours to pursue their dream careers in finance. So, why aren't more of them reaching the top? While it's encouraging to see many organizations actively seeking to diversify their boards and promote women to top positions, it's crucial not to overlook the importance of supporting women early in their careers. These formative stages often set the tone for their professional futures. Are you curious about what can be done to retain this valuable talent and help them thrive within the industry? Are you interested in joining us on this journey of empowering the next generation of women in finance? Download our report here: https://lnkd.in/eiUN23jp I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any questions you may have! ðŸ˜„\n\nAfter three amazing and very fulfilling years at Startupbootcamp, I took some time off to recharge and to get a new source of inspiration. After that, the decision came quite easily. I wanted to keep working for a company that creates a positive impact, challenges the norms on the market and is ready to grow and innovate. So I am happy to announce that I recently accepted a new challenge and joined Female x Finance as a Strategic Growth Manager. I met the founders MÃ©lanie Bosboom and LÃ©onie Kennepohl in late 2021 when they just started, so I am beyond impressed with what they built in such a short time: more than 55 partnerships and a community of 3500 ambitious women in finance. Based on the research, it will take at least another 88 years to achieve gender equality in the finance sector! However, we are ready to challenge that so if you believe that your organisation can benefit from a more inclusive workplace or you would just like to explore how to support this cool initiative that empowers women in the industry, I am always happy to chat!\n\nIn the past years, impact investing showed rapid growth of 42% which accounted for $715 billion. Despite this apparent demand, asset-holders still have a lack of data about the success of their investments. Kauan Von Novack (SBC) and Tommy Hurley (Shamrock Ventures) will discuss the importance and the future of impact investing at our first WHATâ€™S NEXT: Impact Investing Fireside Chat. This event will take place today at 17:00 CEST. Join us live and get insights on how Impact Investing leads to new frontiers of investing by generating positive social impact while producing financial returns. Register here: https://lnkd.in/dQciGHx Startupbootcamp and Shamrock Ventures announced a partnership for the new SBC Sustainability Program, which will invest in 30 high potential startups and scaleups that contribute to accelerating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals."
