        "text": "We are recalling all foreign players that ever have played in the League, telling about foreign championships and National teams of different countries in World basketball map project. Moving to Belgium.\n\nPopulation: 11,5 mln.\n\nPlayers in the history of League: 1.\n\nFull list of players: Maxime De Zeeuw.\n\nThe only Belgian in the history of VTB United League – former Nymburk player Maxime De Zeeuw. He has been playing in homeland for the first 10 years of his career, played for the Czech club in 2015/16 season averaging 8,4 points in 30 championship games.\n\nSince 2009 De Zeeuw has been National Belgian team player.

Since 2012 Oostende has been the best team of the country, they have 20 champion titles overall, and that is the best record in the history of the League.\n\n4 Begian teams out of 10 participated in international tournaments last season. Oostende and Antwerp Giants – in Champions League while Bruxelles and Charleroi – in FIBA Europe Cup.\n\nBelgian League has its own season awards, just like many other professional leagues have: MVP, Best Belgian player, Coach of the year, Rookie of the year and Star of the coaches (award that is given to the most valuable players in coaches’ opinion).\n\nIn 2007 UNICS former forward D’or Fisher was Belgian League’s MVP, and in 2010 – Zenit’s forward Will Thomas. Two more individual awards belong to ex-Nymburk player Maxime De Zeeuw – rookie of the year (2009) and best Belgian player (2014).\n\nBesides, Codi Miller-Mclntyre (PARMA and Zenit, Belgian League scoring, assisting and stealing leader in 2017), Garlon Green (Khimki and Enisey, 3rd best scorer in 2018) and Josh Bostic (Spartak and VEF, 2nd best scorer in 2012) have played in Belgian championship.\n\nInteresting fact\n\nLegendary point guard Tony Parker was born in Belgian capital, Bruxelles.

During Eurobasket group stage they left Israel, Germany and Great Britain National teams behind. In Eurobasket 2021 qualification The Lions took one of the most sensational wins in their history, leaving no chance to Lithuania (86:65).\n\nNowadays Belgian National team is ranked 37 by FIBA, outpacing 3 latest World Cup participants (Japan, Jordan, Cote d’Ivoire).\n\nThe most famous players in the history of Belgium\n\nD.J.
