The VTB United League presents a new edition of Transformation, our series highlighting the new faces expected to have a big impact in the upcoming season. This week, we look at three more free agent signings: Kalev hopes to restart former Nets center Josh Boone's career, Francisco Cruz is ready to shake things up at VEF and Belgian forward Maxime de Zeeuw will play a big role at Nymburk after this month's EuroBasket.

Josh Boone, Kalev

Position: Power forward/center

Country: USA

Age: 30

Former Clubs: UConn, NCAA (2003-2006), New Jersey Nets, USA (2006-2010), Zhejiang Golden Bulls, China (2010-2012), Iowa Energy, D-League (2013, 2014), San Miguel, Philippines (2014), Al Manama, Bahrain (2014-2015)

NBA Stats: 5.2 points and 4.9 rebounds per game

Kalev's front office hopes American big man Josh Boone can resurrect his career and replace Frank Elegar in the middle. Before he entered the NBA, Boone was a star in the NCAA, winning a championship with UConn in 2004 . He started for the New Jersey Nets in 2007-08, averaging 7.3 rebounds per game to finish 2nd on the team in that category. He left the Nets in 2010, however, moving to China for two seasons. Boone later made an attempt to return to the NBA through the D-League, before spending time in the Philippines and Bahrain, where he won a championship last season.

Amazing physical attributes allow Boone to play at both power forward and center. He's aggressive on the boards, skilled in the low post and able to run the fast break. On defense, Boone can stay with his man and block shots.

If Kalev can help Boone adjust to a new environment and fit with the team, expect him to have a big impact in the VTB United League.

Francisco Cruz, VEF

Position: Shooting guard

Country: Mexico

Age: 25

Former Clubs: University of Wyoming, NCAA (2010-2012), Halcones Rojos, Mexico (2012-2015), Ciclista Olimpico, Argentina (2015)

2014-15 Season Stats: 11.6 points, 2.9 rebounds, 2.4 assists in 26 minutes per game in Mexico

After four years of college basketball, Cruz spent three seasons in Mexico. He also played 10 games for Argentina's Ciclista Olimpico earlier this year. Now he's looking for a big change, swapping his native country for faraway Latvia.

That's not to say he doesn't have international experience. The 25-year-old Cruz is a member of the Mexican national team, averaging 12.2 points per game at last year's World Championships, helping lead the team to the playoffs. This summer, he averaged 13.8 points at the Pan-Am Games and he's currently playing for Mexico at the FIBA Americas tournament, where Mexico hopes to earn a berth in next summer's Olympic Games.

Big for his position and very athletic, Cruz is always a threat to drive to the basket. He's a bruising guard, capable of finishing and drawing the foul in the paint. He can also knock down the '3'. Cruz is a cool and collected shooter, waiting for the last moment to release the ball. His fundamental approach and experience will be very valuable in Riga, where he'll be a leader on a young VEF squad.

Maxime de Zeeuw, Nymburk

Position: Power forward

Country: Belgium

Age: 28

Former Clubs: Brussels, Belgium (2004-2005), Verviers-Pepinster, Belgium (2005-2010), Optima-Gent, Belgium (2010-2011), Verviers-Pepinster, Belgium (2011-2012), Antwerp, Belgium (2012-2014), Virtus Roma, Italy (2014-2015)

2014-15 Season Stats: 8.0 points, 4.2 rebounds, 0.9 assists in 19.3 minutes per game in Italy

The Czechs champions aren't done yet on the free agent market, but the experienced Maxime de Zeeuw is certain to be one of the biggest moves of the summer. He's spent much of his career in Belgium and gotten better with each season. De Zeeuw was named Rookie of the Year in 2005 and Most Promising Player in 2009, while in 2014 he was Player of the Year. After that, he spent a year in Italy's Serie A at Virtus Roma, before the club was dropped to the second division due to financial trouble. Now Maxime will play for the Czech Republic's top team.

De Zeeuw is an athletic big man, who can run the floor and bang in the paint. De Zeeuw is most dangerous on the pick-and-roll. He can roll to the basket or pop out to the perimeter for the three-point shot, making him a tough man to cover.

He also has extensive experience on the Belgian national team, going all the way back to the junior level. 28 years old, he's yet to reach his full potential. The Uccle native is currently playing at EuroBasket 2015 and should be a key player for Nymburk in the upcoming campaign.
