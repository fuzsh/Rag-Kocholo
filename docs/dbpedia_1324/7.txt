Maxime De Zeeuw was our guest on the TIB Playground podcast, he talked about a potential return in Belgium: “I really love Antwerp, but there is also Brussels”

When asked about a potential return in Belgium, that’s what the Belgian Lion responded:” I don’t know. I want to say yes, but it depends on many things. I’m 33, but if I have a really nice challenge in Belgium I might say yes. But right now, my priority is to discover new challenges, like I does in Israel right now.“
