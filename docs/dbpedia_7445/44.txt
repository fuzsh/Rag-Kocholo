That’ll do Pig! - Children’s Theatre Company, Minneapolis, MN, brings the Heartwarming Classic — Babe, The Sheep-Pig — to Stage in January.

As the basis for the Academy Award-nominated film, Babe The Sheep-Pig paid homage to a gallant piglet won by James Cromwell’s character “Farmer Hogget.” With a surprising ability to wrangle fellow barnyard animals with determination and unsurpassed politeness, Babe won the hearts of Farmer Hogget and film audiences everywhere.

Now, for the first time, Children’s Theatre Company (CTC) will bring this heartwarming tale to life on stage in the Twin Cities’ first professional production of Babe (The Sheep-Pig), opening Friday, January 21, 2011.

Peter C. Brosius, artistic director for CTC and director of CTC favorites Dr. Seuss’ The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins, A Christmas Story and The Biggest Little House in the Forest, directs his third CTC production show this season.

“Babe is a delightful story by the English writer Dick King-Smith,” says Brosius. “Mr. Smith, who worked as a farmer for 20 years before becoming a teacher and writer, filled his writing with quirky, wonderfully observed characters. The playwright, David Wood, created a lively, very tender and theatrical story that inspires us all.”

The story arc follows Babe, a piglet won by sheep farmer Hogget and his wife and taken in by the Hogget’s dog “Fly,” as he discovers his astounding ability to herd sheep through time-tested personality traits: bravery, honesty, consideration and the best possible barnyard manners. Babe becomes an unlikely hero as his star rises over the Grand Challenge Sheep-Dog Trials.

Reuniting the comic duo of last holiday season’s Cinderella, actors Dean Holt and Reed Sigmund lead the cast as Babe and Farmer Hogget. Holt, who just completed his run as Robin Hood, and Sigmund, who played the roles of Prince John, Will Scarlett, Friar Tuck and Little John, also in Robin Hood, are in their 17th and 11th seasons, respectively, here at CTC. Sigmund’s work is beloved by CTC patrons. He has also been seen in The Wizard of Oz, A Year with Frog and Toad, The Snow Queen and If You Give a Mouse a Cookie. Holt is the recipient of an IVEY Award for his work in CTC’s production of Reeling.
