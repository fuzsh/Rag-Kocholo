        "text": "The story is about a farmer who wins a pig from a nearby fair and the pig lives with all the sheepdogs and he wants to be one. He rounded up the sheep because he was their friends and they did what he asked them to. It is a good book\n\nI like the vocabulary.It is about a pig who is adopted by a sheepdog and wants to be like her and he proves to everyone that sheep aren't dumb along with his sheep friend,Ma.\n\nThe sheep pig is a story about a pig named Babe that wants to be a sheep dog though it's a pig so instead it becomes a sheep pig. In the end Babe goes to a competition and is better than all the dogs getting 100/100 the closest being 85/100. Babe also saved sheep from being stolen and saved them from being eaten by dogs which wouldn't of been nice.\n\nIt was interesting to think that Pigs and Sheep might be able to talk but humans can't hear them. There were different feelings happy and sad, and it was interesting. I really like Fly she is my favourite character.\n\nI thought it was really good and really funny. It was fiction and I liked Fly the Collie best.I would recommend it to people who like pigs and sheep.\n\nThis book is very good and some of it made me laugh. I would recommend it to anyone who is over 4 or 5 .\n\nThe sheep pig is a very good book and I think it is very funny how Babe wants to become a sheep pig after he got adopted by a sheepdog.\n\nI think they should read this book because it is very funny when Babe wanted to be a sheep pig because he got adopted by a female sheepdog ! It is adventurous and I would definitely love to read it again\n\nI think you should read this book 'cause it's different from the others and besides, ANYONE will like this book!\n\nMe and my family love the film and now I love the book but not the most interesting. Maybe because I've seen the movie..... :0)"
