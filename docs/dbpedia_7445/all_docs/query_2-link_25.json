        "meta_description": "Ein Schweinchen namens Babe: Directed by Chris Noonan. With Christine Cavanaugh, Miriam Margolyes, Danny Mann, Hugo Weaving. Gentle farmer Arthur Hoggett wins a piglet Babe at a county fair. Narrowly escaping his fate as Christmas dinner, Babe bonds with motherly border collie Fly and discovers that he too can herd sheep. But will the other animals accept him?",

        "text": "Babe is separated from his family and becomes friends with some of the animals on his new farm. He learns that each animal has a role to play and that both he and Ferdinand the duck are fated to be lunch! Both take new roles to escape their fate and Babe tries to become a sheepdog. As Farmer Hoggett begins to notice the unusual way Babe can work with the sheep he begins to groom him for that role  much to the worry of his wife and the other farm animals.\n\nWritten by the guy who wrote the Mad Max films  that's what kills me. I know it's adapted but how can the Mad Max writer manage to deliver such a sweet film that is unassuming and comic and heart warming. The plot is great as it is adapted from `The Sheeppig' but Miller's script adds so many comic touches that it's funny throughout. The characters are all well written so that we care about them and get easily drawn in.\n\nIt's directed well and again feels fresh and different  whether it's the chapter set up or the use of the narrator or the way that the singing mice make the links it all works well. Because it is gentle and unassuming I found myself involved in it so easily and the themes of finding your own path and friendship are not rammed down your throat but just sit there if you want to get them. I've seen this several times and the silent, wonderful climax to the sheepdog trials makes me choke everytime (even if it is predictable).\n\nAll the voices are good and the use of animals is faultless. The use of animatronics is a little ropey at times but the sense of goodwill the film gave me extended to overlooking these minor complaints. James Cromwell is just superb as the human face in this drama  everytime I see him now I can only hear him say `that'll do pig'. Babe is a great hero and you feel for him from the start to the end  when he gives a little satisfied sigh it's difficult not to feel warm inside.\n\nOverall this is one of the best children's films I've seen  it's light and unassuming and not a classic but it is comic, gentle and ultimately heart warming  what more do you want?"
