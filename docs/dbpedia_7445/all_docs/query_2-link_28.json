        "text": "Children's theatre sometimes shouts and gallops in a frenetic attempt to keep the attention of its target audience. CATCO Is Kids' charming production of “Babe, the Sheep Pig” takes the opposite approach. Its unhurried rhythms and gentle approach to its characters makes for a relaxing evening of theatre.\n\nDavid Wood's play, based on Dick King-Smith's novel, follows sweet piglet Babe (Preston Hudson), who is won at a fair by Farmer Hogget (Chris Johnson). Lonely, he is adopted by mother sheep dog Fly (Jillian Christie), despite the protests of her puppies. After watching her work, he discovers his own way of herding sheep, which depends not on aggression and insults but on a polite appeal to their feelings, and employs it to good effect in the championship sheep dog trials.\n\nDirector Andrew Protopapas allows this story to unfold in its own good time, with detours as Babe gets acquainted with the farm ducks, cat and other animals, and suspenseful interludes as he confronts sheep rustlers and outside dogs that attack the sheep.\n\nJohnson is a substantial, reassuring presence as laconic Farmer Hogget, silently communicating his affection for the animals. Ella Palardi makes a humorous match for him as his enthusiastic, loquacious wife, who more than compensates for his silence.\n\nHudson is an appealingly polite Babe, and Boula Ross is affecting as elderly ewe Ma, the first sheep to take a shine to the unfamiliar pig. Christie's Fly, who narrates the story and takes part in most of the action, is the sensitive heart of the play. She gives Fly a measured grace and dignity that anchors its flights of fancy.\n\nA large cast of young actors fills out the roles of the animals with endearingly serious commitment.\n\nHay bales, a simple but evocative backdrop, and shifting projected images help set the various scenes, as does Caroline Dittamo's fluid lighting, which gives a clear sense of shifting times of day. Debbie Hamrick's delightfully intricate costumes go a long way in transforming the young actors into credible animals.\n\nBecause the play depends on its audience's ability to connect the dots between its episodic scenes, and because one significant character dies during the play, parents should consider whether to take very young children, and they might be advised to make sure kids have some understanding of the possibly unfamiliar practice of sheep dog trials. (At Friday's opening night performance, quite a few kids asked out loud, “What's happening?” and “Why is he doing that?”)\n\nEven those occasionally confused, however, will appreciate the quiet fun of the farmyard scenes and the play's unobtrusive espousal of respect for the feelings of others."
