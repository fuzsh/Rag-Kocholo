        "text": "Chracters!\n\nBabe\n\nBabe is a happy-go-lucky male pig, or, more specifically, a Large White. He was taken from his family when he was a young piglet to be auctioned off at a carnival. At that carnival, he was won by Farmer Hogget and was taken home to live at their farm. When he grows older, he finds out the usefulness of a sheepdog and is dertermined to become a sheep-pig, even if most of the farm is convinced that he's crazy. He does develop a way of herding sheep that works for everyone - being polite. Being polite comes naturally to Babe, so he doesn't have to do much to be nice to the sheep.\n\nFly\n\nFly is a caring collie bitch (or more kindly called a \"collie-whatever\") that will mother almost anything. When Babe first comes to Hogget's Farm, Fly 'adopts' him, and becomes his foster mother. She also is a sheepdog, with a 'My way or the highway' attitude towards the sheep. In other words, if they don't do what she tells them to do, she'll do almost anything to get them to obey. She thinks that Babe's idea is silly at first, but her views soon change when she sees his progress.\n\nMa\n\nMa is a warm hearted old ewe with an awful cough. When Babe first encounters her, he's off looking for an animal he can one day herd, but ends up with a friend. Ma is, like all sheep or ewe, afraid of sheepdogs, but once she makes peace with Babe, she speads the news. Ma encourages Babe to be polite and keeps him having a good and easy time herding sheep. Unfortunately, Ma dies near the end of the book, thanks to some god-awful wild dogs.\n\nOther Characters\n\nIn other words, minor characters in the book in which I have little pixels for. Farmer Hogget\n\nMrs. Hogget"
