        "text": "The story is about a farmer who wins a pig from a nearby fair and the pig lives with all the sheepdogs and he wants to be one. He rounded up the sheep because he was their friends and they did what he asked them to. It is a good book\n\nAnonymous 25.08.2022\n\nI like the vocabulary.It is about a pig who is adopted by a sheepdog and wants to be like her and he proves to everyone that sheep aren't dumb along with his sheep friend,Ma.\n\nAnonymous 20.01.2022\n\nThe sheep pig is a story about a pig named Babe that wants to be a sheep dog though it's a pig so instead it becomes a sheep pig. In the end Babe goes to a competition and is better than all the dogs getting 100/100 the closest being 85/100. Babe also saved sheep from being stolen and saved them from being eaten by dogs which wouldn't of been nice.\n\nAnonymous 30.12.2020\n\nIt was interesting to think that Pigs and Sheep might be able to talk but humans can't hear them. There were different feelings happy and sad, and it was interesting. I really like Fly she is my favourite character.\n\nAnonymous 20.08.2020\n\nI thought it was really good and really funny. It was fiction and I liked Fly the Collie best.I would recommend it to people who like pigs and sheep.\n\nAnonymous 15.08.2020\n\nThis book is very good and some of it made me laugh. I would recommend it to anyone who is over 4 or 5 .\n\nAnonymous 25.07.2018"
