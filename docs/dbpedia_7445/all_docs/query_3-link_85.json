        "text": "As a family we LOVE going to the theatre, well me and the kids do, the hubby just nods off lol.\n\nI used to be an actress amongst other things before I had the children (clearly not very successfully or you’d have heard of me pre-blog!) my love of theatre is well known but I love watching the kids faces as they become lost in a production and get carried off with the magic.\n\nOne of Harry’s favourite movies when he was younger was Babe and he re-watched that DVD until it was too scratched to play right through any more. So he was thrilled when I told him we were going to see it on the stage. Dominic cannot wait either!\n\nHere’s the lowdown on the production….\n\nAdapted from Dick King-Smith’s much-loved children’s novel which inspired the Oscar-winning 1995 film, Babe, The Sheep-Pig is arriving on stage in 2017 in a major UK Tour. Featuring stunning puppetry, an original score and an utterly charming ‘baa-ber sheep’ quartet, it tells the story of the lovable Babe in a heart-warming tale of friendship, adventure and bravery.\n\nMeet the lovable Babe in a heart-warming tale of friendship, adventure and bravery.\n\nWhen Babe arrives at Hogget’s Farm he is taken in by the trusty sheep-dog Fly and discovers a talent for herding. With the help of his adopted Mum, our polite piglet soon wins over the most suspicious of sheep. But can a small pig make it in a dog’s world, and when his farmyard friends are in trouble can Babe save the day?\n\nJoin us for an enchanting family favourite, as the classic novel which inspired the Oscar-winning film, is bought to life by a cast of West End performers in a show brimming with laughter, thrills, stunning puppetry and original live music.\n\nAdapted by Olivier Award winner David Wood (Goodnight Mister Tom, James and the Giant Peach, The BFG), follow the incredible story of one piglet’s rise to become the world famous sheep-pig.\n\nThe UK tour is in full swing as we speak, enjoying a run in London’s Polka theatre until Sunday 5th February, before going on to venues all around Britain.\n\nI am chuffed to little mint balls to be able to bring you the chance to win a family ticket to see the show at a venue near you.\n\nSimply enter via the Rafflecopter widget below and good luck!\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway\n\nHave you seen the show already? What did you think?"
