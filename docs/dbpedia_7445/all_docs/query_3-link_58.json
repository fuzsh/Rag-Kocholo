        "text": "Hello! It's really lovely to see you all, and thank you for coming to join me for today's reading lesson where we will be reading and discussing \"The Sheep-Pig.\" My name's Ms. Clarke.\n\nI'm really, really excited to learn with you today.\n\nNow, very importantly for today's lesson, you will need a copy of the book \"The Sheep-Pig.\" This is what the front cover looks like.\n\nHave a look.\n\nI need you to pause the video and go and get your copy of \"The Sheep-Pig\" now.\n\nPause the video and go and find it.\n\nOff you go.\n\nOkay, I am pleased to see you all with your books in front of you now, so now we can get started with today's lesson.\n\nThe outcome for today's lesson is I can discuss a turning point in the story.\n\nLet's have a look at our keywords for today.\n\nMy turn, your turn.\n\nI'll say them, you say them back.\n\nPlot.\n\nTurning point.\n\nStructure.\n\nStereotype.\n\nWell done.\n\nLet's have a look at the definitions of these words.\n\nSo the plot is the sequence of events that make up the main storyline of a narrative.\n\nSo it's essentially what happens in the story.\n\nA turning point in a narrative is a pivotal moment that significantly alters the course of the story or a character's journey.\n\nSo pivotal, an important moment that might alter, change the direction of the story.\n\nStory structure refers to the order of events within a narrative that gives it a coherent and engaging flow.\n\nSo a clear structure.\n\nAnd stereotype refers to a generalised and often unfair or untrue belief about a particular group of people or things.\n\nSo there might be a stereotype about what a pig can and cannot do.\n\nIn today's lesson, we are going to be reading the story first of all, and then the second learning cycle we will be discussing a turning point.\n\nSo let's get started with our first learning cycle, reading the story.\n\nSo we are reading \"The Sheep-Pig\" by Dick King-Smith.\n\nWhat do we know so far about this story? We know that Babe has formed positive relationships with the other animals on the farm due to his politeness and kind nature.\n\nFly, the border collie, is an experienced sheepdog on the farm who has become Babe's mum.\n\nHe refers to her as his mum.\n\nBabe has decided he wants to learn to become a sheep-pig, and he shows a unique obedience and willingness to learn.\n\nSo a really kind of special obedience, doing the right thing, following instructions, and an eagerness to learn.\n\nAnd Babe has told us that he thinks being polite will be an effective way to herd sheep, but Fly the sheepdog was not so sure.\n\nSo you now need to read Chapter Five.\n\nCan you all find your book, \"The Sheep-Pig\"? I know you've got it in front of you 'cause you already found it earlier in this lesson.\n\nCan you find your book and read from the start of Chapter Five all the way to the end of Chapter Five? Maybe your teacher will be reading to you, maybe somebody at home will be reading to you, or maybe you will be reading yourself or with a partner.\n\nEither way, read Chapter Five.\n\nPause the video now.\n\nOkay, great reading, everybody.\n\nWell done.\n\nI've got a little task for you to do with a partner.\n\nI would like you to summarise Chapter Five in just one sentence.\n\nSummarise means give the key events, key ideas from what you've read, and I've asked you to do that just in one sentence.\n\nCan you pause the video and have a go now? Okay, well done.\n\nHere's my summary of Chapter Five in just one sentence.\n\nIn Chapter Five, Babe was a hero and saved all the sheep on the farm from being stolen by squealing so loudly and scaring the sheep-stealers away! Well done if you managed to summarise that chapter in one sentence.\n\nSuch an exciting chapter where a lot happens, but you did a really, really good job putting the main events, the key ideas into that one sentence.\n\nGreat job.\n\nSo let's check your understanding on that chapter.\n\nWhat name is given to the people who were trying to steal the sheep? Was it A, burglars, B, rustlers, or C, farmers? Pause the video and answer now.\n\nOkay, well done.\n\nWell done if you said B, it was rustlers.\n\nThat was the term used in the book that they used to describe the people, I think they were farmers, but coming to steal the sheep.\n\nAnd one more check for understanding.\n\nTrue or false, Mrs. Hogget's opinion of Babe changed at the end of Chapter Five.\n\nIs that true or is that false? Pause the video and make your choice.\n\nOkay, well done if you said true.\n\nHer opinion of Babe did change.\n\nBut let's justify that answer.\n\nWhich is the best justification? Is it A, Mrs. Hogget was amazed at how Babe saved the sheep, or B, Mrs. Hogget initially only wanted to fatten Babe up in time for Christmas! After he rescued all the sheep, she now wants to save him too.\n\nWhich best justifies the fact that Mrs. Hogget's opinion of Babe has changed? Pause the video and make your choice.\n\nOkay, well done if you said B.\n\nA, Mrs. Hogget was amazed at how Babe saved the sheep, but B gives a really clear justification of how her opinion has changed, because originally she only wanted to fatten him up for Christmas, but now she wants to save him.\n\nShe doesn't want to eat him anymore.\n\nWell done.\n\nSome more reading to do now.\n\nWhoever is reading to you, maybe somebody is reading to you, maybe you are reading yourself, you need to read the whole of Chapter Six.\n\nSo everybody get your book.\n\nHave you got your book now? Find your book and read Chapter Six.\n\nPause the video and off you go.\n\nOkay, great reading, everybody.\n\nWell done.\n\nSo a lot happened in that chapter.\n\nBabe went to try and herd the sheep, went to see what Fly was doing with Farmer Hogget, he was invited up, and quite a lot happens in that chapter.\n\nAnd in the end of the chapter, the sheep listen to Babe and they follow his instructions.\n\nMy question is, why do you think the sheep listen to Babe? Can you talk to your partner and answer that question now? Pause the video and have a go.\n\nSome great ideas coming from all of you.\n\nWell done.\n\nSome of you said similar things to this: I think the sheep listen to Babe because he shows respect and politeness towards them.\n\nAnd if you are polite and kind, generally you receive a positive response, that's right.\n\nIf you're kind and polite to people, generally people will want to do as you ask, and that's really true in life and you've probably found that as well.\n\nSo that's probably why they listened to him, because he respects them and he asks them really kindly, really politely.\n\nWell done.\n\nSo let's check your understanding on that chapter.\n\nHow did Fly make the sheep move? So initially they didn't respond to her, they weren't responding to her, they weren't moving, but then she did manage to get them to move in the end.\n\nHow did she make them move? Was it A, she asked them politely, B, she jumped at one of the sheep with aggression, causing the rest of the flock to follow her instructions, or C, she ordered them rudely to move? Can you have a think? Pause the video, have a think, and make your choice.\n\nOkay, welcome back.\n\nWell done if you said B, she did.\n\nShe jumped at one of the sheep with quite a lot of aggression, and then the rest of the flock thought, \"Well, we better do as she says, we don't want to be jumped at like that and hurt at all.\" She had tried ordering them to to move, but rudely, which she normally does, but that hadn't worked, and she definitely doesn't think asking them politely is a good idea.\n\nOkay, so I've got some questions for you for your practise task today.\n\nI would like you to discuss these inference questions with your partner.\n\nRemember, inference means reading between the lines, looking for clues, thinking about what that tells you.\n\nYou will need to refer to Chapter Six.\n\nYou don't need to read the whole chapter again, but just have your book with you, have your book with you just so you can flick through and look for some ideas for some evidence.\n\nQuestion one, why did Farmer Hogget think himself daft? So quite near the beginning of the chapter, he says he thinks he might be daft.\n\nWhy? Daft means a bit crazy or mad.\n\nTwo, why does Farmer Hogget decide to take Babe with him? Why? Why did he take a pig with him to go and do the sheep herding? And three, why won't the sheep move for Fly? For all of these answers, you need to search for clues within the text and ask, what does this clue tell me? So think carefully about these questions, you can flick through Chapter Six to help you, and discuss these answers with your partner.\n\nPause the video, off you go.\n\nAmazing, some really, really great answers going on.\n\nWell done.\n\nBut why did Farmer Hogget think himself daft? He probably thought he was going a bit crazy by thinking that a pig might actually be able to herd sheep, as this was unheard of.\n\nNever before has a pig been a sheep-pig.\n\nIt's always been left to the sheepdogs.\n\nSo he probably was thinking, \"Oh, I must be daft.\n\nI must be going a bit mad thinking this might actually work.\" Number two, why did Farmer Hogget decide to take Babe with him? Well, Farmer Hogget had noticed some unique qualities in Babe.\n\nHe'd noticed that he was different to other pigs, that he was obedient, that he followed instructions, and he wanted to see whether this obedience and determination may actually work in him becoming a sheep-pig, so he just wanted to try it out.\n\nAnd three, why didn't the sheep move for Fly in the start? Why didn't they move for her? The sheep did not want to respond to Fly's rudeness and sharpness.\n\nAnd instead they were asking for Babe, they wanted Babe to move them because he was polite and respectful.\n\nSo they were a bit fed up of being spoken to rudely and they thought, \"No, we're all gonna make a stand and say no and ask for Babe instead.\" Well done if you've got some similar answers to those there.\n\nGreat job! So now we are moving on to our second learning cycle, discussing a turning point.\n\nStory structure refers to the order of events within a narrative that gives it a coherent and engaging flow, so a clear structure.\n\nIt is important for stories to have a clear structure to present the narrative in a meaningful way so that readers can understand and enjoy it.\n\nIt's got to have a kind of logical flow to it, a beginning, a buildup, a climax, a resolution, to keep the story going, to keep the story moving and to help us to understand it.\n\nSo there are four main parts of a story structure, the opening, the buildup, the climax, and the resolution.\n\nA turning point in a narrative is a pivotal moment that significantly alters the course of the story or a character's journey.\n\nSo it really changes the direction of the story.\n\nA turning point typically occurs somewhere in the middle of the narrative, but there may be multiple turning points that happen at different points in the story.\n\nAnd it leads the story into a new, a different, and an unexpected direction.\n\nSo it's kind of key moment that changes the direction of the story.\n\nSome people might confuse the terms turning point and climax, and they're similar and they're definitely related, but they're not exactly the same thing.\n\nThe climax is a type of turning point that is considered the highest point of tension, excitement, and drama in the story.\n\nAll climaxes can be considered turning points, but not all turning points are climaxes.\n\nSo a climax might be the really, really exciting point of the story where something happens and you're left on a cliffhanger and then there's a resolution.\n\nBut there may be other turning points that aren't necessarily climaxes, that aren't the most kind of highest tension point of the story.\n\nSo what does the turning point in a story do? Is it A, leads the story in a different direction, B, tells the most exciting part of the story, or C, explains the outcome of the story? Can you pause the video and answer the question now? Okay, well done if you said A, it leads the story in a different direction.\n\nB, sometimes the turning point might tell the most exciting part, but that's called a climax.\n\nAnd it doesn't explain the outcome of the story, that would be the ending, the resolution.\n\nSo Chapter Six could be considered the turning point in the story \"The Sheep-Pig.\" Babe, despite being a pig and not a traditional sheepdog, demonstrates his intelligence and herding instincts.\n\nThe turning point is when Babe successfully herds the sheep, gaining the respect and admiration of the farmer and others who initially doubted his abilities.\n\nSo it's a really key point in the story, because he's really earnt that respect and he's kind of changing the direction of where the story is going.\n\nSo people doubted him, but he's proved everybody wrong.\n\nThis achievement marks a crucial moment in the narrative, as it challenges stereotypes, one of our keywords there, and expectations about what animals can and cannot do based on their species.\n\nSo if you remember, a stereotype is a view that's often unfair and not true that people have, a view or opinion people have on a particular group of people or group of things.\n\nSo a stereotype of a pig might be that pigs cannot herd sheep.\n\nWell, Babe has challenged this stereotype by showing that actually he can herd sheep.\n\nSo let's check your understanding.\n\nWhy is Chapter Six considered the turning point in the story? Is it A, Farmer Hogget changes his opinion on pigs and decides they are useful animals around the farm, B, Mrs. Hogget changes her opinion of Babe and decides she no longer wants to eat him at Christmas, or C, Babe's success challenges conventional expectations about pigs and their abilities and sets the stage for Babe to transform into a sheep-pig? Which one best summarises why this chapter is a turning point in the story? Pause the video, make your choice.\n\nOkay, welcome back, and well done if you said C.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nHis success does challenge the conventional expectations, challenges stereotypes, and it kind of sets the stage, leads the story into this new direction of Babe transforming into a sheep-pig.\n\nWell done! So time for a task now.\n\nWe have identified the turning point of the story.\n\nI would like you to discuss these questions with your partner.\n\nA, what qualities or abilities do you think Babe displayed that made the sheep respond differently than they did to Fly? B, how do you think Fly felt when the sheep listened to Babe instead of her? How might this have changed Fly's perspective on Babe? So perspective means what you think or how you view someone.\n\nSo how might Fly view Babe differently now? And C, how do you think this moment will impact Babe's role on the farm and his relationships with the other animals? Have a think carefully about these questions and discuss them with your partner.\n\nListen to your partner's point of view as well.\n\nMaybe you'll think different things.\n\nGood luck, pause the video now, and off you go.\n\nOkay, great discussing, everybody.\n\nWell done.\n\nSo let's have a look at some answers, things you might have said.\n\nWhat qualities or abilities do you think Babe displayed that made the sheep respond differently than they did to Fly? Babe showed compassion, respect, and kindness, and asked the sheep to move rather than bossing them around like Fly did.\n\nHe also showed patience and good communication skills, which proved to be successful.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSo he was respectful, he was kind, but he communicated really well to the sheep as well.\n\nAnd he wasn't bossing them around in a rush, charging them around.\n\nHe was showing patience, he waited for them, and the sheep responded really well to that.\n\nGreat answer.\n\nHow do you think Fly felt when the sheep listened to Babe instead of her, and how might this have changed Fly's perspective on Babe? Maybe you said Fly might have felt a bit jealous that Babe experienced immediate success with the sheep.\n\nYeah, she's been doing this all her life, and actually for someone to come out and to experience success so easily, maybe she was a bit jealous.\n\nBut lots of you I heard say she may have been proud of the way Babe herded the sheep because she'd been the one teaching him and talking about it with him.\n\nAnd she's a bit of a mother to him as well, so she probably felt a sense of pride that he was able to do this.\n\nAnd in terms of how it might have changed her perspective, well it may lead her to have even more respect for him now.\n\nYou know, initially she was unsure about a pig's abilities, but now she probably has quite a lot of respect for the pig and what he could do.\n\nC, how do you think this moment will impact Babe's role on the farm and his relationships with the other animals? Maybe you said, I think Babe will now be well respected and admired on the farm and will be given different roles and responsibilities as the rest of the animals will listen to him.\n\nSo yeah, maybe his role on the farm will change, he'll be given jobs to do, given responsibilities to do, because he clearly communicates well and can get animals to respond to him.\n\nAnd he will continue to form positive bonds with the other animals.\n\nIt seems that all of his relationships are developing in a really, really positive way.\n\nWell done! So a turning point in a story is a pivotal moment or event that significantly alters the direction or outcome of the narrative.\n\nIt leads the story into a new, different, and unexpected direction.\n\nAnother question for you now to discuss with your partner, your last practise task in today's lesson.\n\nCan you explain how Babe challenges stereotypes and how this might alter the direction of the story? How does he challenge the stereotypical view of a pig and how might the direction of the story change? Pause the video and discuss this question with your partner.\n\nAmazing discussions, everybody.\n\nI really enjoyed hearing all of those ideas.\n\nWow! Some of you said, despite expectations and preconceived ideas about pigs, Babe displays intelligence and good herding skills.\n\nSo that's how he challenges a stereotype there.\n\nBabe's success challenges the idea that animals should adhere strictly to traditional roles and may lead to animals being given different roles on the farm.\n\nSo it challenges this idea, the stereotype that certain animals fit certain expectations and roles of what they should do, and maybe this might change the direction of the story because they might be given different roles to do now on the farm.\n\nGreat idea.\n\nSome of you said Babe's success is due to his kindness and ability to communicate effectively with the sheep.\n\nThis challenges stereotypes by highlighting the importance of qualities beyond what is traditionally expected.\n\nThis may lead to a new focus on kindness and respect in how jobs are done on the farm.\n\nSo yeah, traditionally, the expectation is that the dog goes out, the sheepdog goes out and barks orders at the sheep and they move because they're being forced to.\n\nBut Babe is challenging this stereotype and actually showing that there are better qualities like communication and kindness that could be used really effectively, and maybe this will change the direction of how everybody acts on the farm and how jobs are done on the farm.\n\nSome really, really thoughtful and interesting ideas there.\n\nWell done.\n\nSo let's look at a summary of our learning today.\n\nWe have learnt that a turning point in a narrative is a pivotal moment that significantly alters the course of the story or a character's journey.\n\nThe turning point is when Babe successfully herds the sheep, gaining the respect and admiration of the farmer and others who initially doubted his abilities.\n\nBabe successfully herds the sheep and impresses Farmer Hogget and Fly, and Babe challenges stereotypes and expectations about what animals can and cannot do based on their species.\n\nSome really, really interesting and high-level discussions today.\n\nYou worked really, really hard, so well done, and thank you everyone for joining me for this lesson today.\n\nBye for now."
