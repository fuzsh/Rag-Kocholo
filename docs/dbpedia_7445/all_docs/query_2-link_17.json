        "text": "It was very funny but somtimes I lose track of what Babe is doing.My fav was Babe so nice and polite.I would recomened it to people who likes sily books. It was so silly.\n\nMadam Diamond Windchime 17.08.2024\n\nI loved this story because Babe was lonely without his mum and Fly looked after him instead and he called her mum. I liked it when he talked nicely to the sheep and they did what he asked them to do.\n\nConstable Cello Possum 14.08.2024\n\nI recently read a heartwarming story about a piglet named Babe who went to a new farm and made some amazing friends. One of those friends was a dog named Fly and his adorable puppies. Unfortunately, one day the puppies were sold to new farms and Babe was left feeling lonely. However, Babe had a special talent for fetching sheep and soon put that talent to good use. In fact, Babe became so good at it that he won first prize in the Grand Challenge Sheep-dog Trials! I am so proud of Babe and all that he accomplished. It just goes to show that anyone can do great things when they put their mind to it.\n\nQueen Marge Frozen-Peas 03.08.2023\n\nStar Reviewer\n\nIf you like this book, you would also like Charlotte's Web, and if you like Charlotte's Web, you would also like this book. I would like to also watch the movie since I've read the book.\n\nDon Adolpho Skateboard 30.07.2023\n\nThis pig is really shy and reminds me of Charlottes web. Its a good book because you can get different animals in shapes and sizes and it is very funny especially when the man goes off to the fair and enters the raffle.\n\nEarl Quicksand Bobble-hat 20.07.2022\n\nI loved The Sheep-Pig because it had lots of interesting details. It had lots of animals, which I really like. There was a sad part where an animal died, but it had a happy ending.\n\nEmpress Magnolia Pawprint 03.08.2021\n\nI liked this book. There was a pig called babe and he wanted to be a sheep pig. He was won by Farmer Hoggett in what the Wright was and got to keep him. He was raised by a sheep dog called Fly so he learnt to be like a sheep dog and not a pig. My favourite character was Babe the pig. I would recommend this book.\n\nEarl Race-car Peanut-butter 13.09.2020\n\nThe sheep pig was about a pig how was really good at being a sheep dog. But it was so so so sad his mummy had left him and he found a sheep dog how was nice and had puppies but 1 year later she had to let the puppies leave her so the pig and the sheep dog stayed together by each other’s sides .I’d recommend this book to people how do not get too emotional.\n\nCountess Diamond Legend 06.07.2020"
