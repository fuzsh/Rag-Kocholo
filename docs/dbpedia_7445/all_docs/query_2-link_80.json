        "text": "Most asked questions about Suzy Sheep character\n\nSuzy Sheep is Peppa’s best friend. They have been friends since they were babies. Mummy Pig showed Peppa and Suzy Sheep some old photographs from when they were babies. They don’t remember being that young, but they are pleased to see that they have always been best friends. Suzy Sheep’s favourite toy is her toy owl.\n\nSuzy Sheep often comes to Peppa’s house to play. Peppa and Suzy love to play in the garden. They also love playing in Peppa’s bedroom. Suzy loves to jump up and down in muddy puddles. Peppa and Suzy are very chatty. While running on the school sports day, they were so busy chatting that they forgot to run and ending up being last however, they didn’t mind as it was the taking part that counted.\n\nSuzy sheep likes playing dress-up. She often dresses up as a nurse, and when she grows up, Suzy wants to be a doctor or a nurse because she likes to help sick people get better. One Halloween, she dressed up as a vampire, and on an international day, she represented Holland.\n\nSuzy Sheep is very confident. She isn’t afraid to ask for a turn in the sandpit at the playgroup after the other kids have had a go. Suzy is good at sports and loves playing bat and ball.\n\nSuzy Sheep almost moved away to another country and to a new school because her mummy got a new job. Peppa was sad, but she made Suzy a going away card and gave Suzy her favourite plastic crown. Fortunately for Peppa, Suzy ended up not moving away.\n\nSuzy and Peppa often argue, especially when Peppa calls Suzy bossy and Suzy thinks Peppa talks too much. But they always say sorry and make up and become best friends again."
