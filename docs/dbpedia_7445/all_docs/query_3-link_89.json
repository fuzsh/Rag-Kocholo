        "text": "Hi everyone, and welcome to another review. This time, I went to go and see ‘Babe – The Sheep-Pig’ at The Mercury Theatre in Colchester!\n\nThis is definitely a show for all the family! ‘Babe’ tells the story of a farm pig who dreams of becoming a sheepdog, and all his friends at the farm help him to fulfill his dream. But without some scary things happening along the way.\n\nAs usual The Mercury Theatre and their ‘Made in Colchester Production’ didn’t disappoint. The show was fun, lively, and upbeat, there was never a dull moment.\n\nThere was a lot of humorous moments both for children and adults alike. As this show has a somewhat small cast, most of them having to play multiple characters or animals. The only person who didn’t was the puppeteer who was operating Babe, along with the actress playing ‘Fly’.\n\nLike I said at the beginning, this is a show for the whole family, however, there are some scary scenes that younger children may find too much. But I believe if this is the first time taking your children to the theatre, this would be a good show to start them off with! It has elements of a professional production, and I came away with that feeling, which is good for the adults and parents. But there is no doubt this show is aimed at children. The show has a very good message of friendship for children which is always lovely to see!\n\nAlso another thing I wanted to point out whilst I was there, was that The Mercury Theatre have now installed boxes in the auditorium, so you can go and sit with your family or party without having to be around the crowd of people, if your children aren’t a big fan of crowds, or has a visually impaired person, like me you find it difficult to walk about in crowds of people!\n\nOverall, ‘Babe’ was excellent and would thoroughly recommend during the school holidays and summer season!\n\nPeople with a visual impairment: I think your do fine here, there’s plenty of light, throughout the show, and plenty of colour. There are a few scenes which are set at night and are quite dark along with strobe lighting!\n\nPeople who have no Vision: Again, I think your do fine here too. The show will be very easy to follow without audio description and it is very audible and not so much visually, but if you prefer audio description there is a touch tour and audio description performance available!\n\n‘Babe The Sheep-Pig’ is running at The Mercury Theatre between 27th July – 29th August!
