        "text": "The hilarious, inspirational tale of a chubby little piglet who dreams of herding sheep. When Babe, an orphan piglet, is won by Farmer Hoggett at a fair, he is quickly adopted by Fly, the farmyard sheep-dog. Inspired by Fly’s skill at herding sheep, Babe is determined to learn everything he can from his new mentor – even though the other animals laugh at him. He knows he’ll never be a sheep-dog. But can Babe prove himself against the odds, and become a true sheep-pig? Full of wonderful animal characters, this is an unforgettable story about defying obstacles and reaching for dreams.\n\n#reading-lists-7\n\n#readandrespond-0816\n\n#bookpacks-0816"
