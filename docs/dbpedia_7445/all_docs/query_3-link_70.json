        "text": "Narrator: This is a tale about an unprejudiced heart... and how it changed our valley forever. There was a time not so long ago... when pigs were afforded no respect except by other pigs. They lived their whole lives in a cruel and sunless world. In those days, pigs believed that the sooner they grew large and fat, the sooner they'd be taken into pig paradise.\n\n- Haa! Haa! Get up!\n\nNarrator: A place so wonderful...that no pig had ever thought to come back.\n\n- Yo! Yeah!\n\nGood-bye, Mom.\n\nNarrator: So when the day came for their parents to go to that other world of endless pleasures, it was not a time for young pigs to be sad. Just another step towards the day when they, too, would make the journey. Perhaps it was because he was alone. Perhaps his sadness made him easier to catch. Whatever the reason, of the thousands of animals in the piggery that day... only one was chosen.\n\n- How's this one, Harry?\n\n- Just right for the purpose.\n\n- How much do I owe you?\n\n- It's a runt, Harry.\n\nJust a worthless, little runt.\n\nYou're too modest, Esme Hoggett.\n\nNine out of ten first prizes for jams and jellies... is more than a matter of luck.\n\nLuck still plays its part. Our berries were wickedly good this year. And our water is very tasty too.\n\nOf course, we don't use the town water.\n\nArthur Hoggett!\n\nHow's it going, Arthur?\n\nHow are those sheep of yours? Come on, try your luck.\n\nHow about taking a guess,\n\nArthur? All for a good cause.\n\n- Don't keep pigs.\n\n- Before Christmas day. Think of it.\n\nWhat a feast!\n\nThat'll do, Pig.\n\nNarrator: The pig and the farmer regarded each other. And for a fleeting moment, something passed between them. A faint sense of some common destiny.\n\n- Hah. Strange.\n\nFirst time the little thing hasn't screamed its head off.\n\nNow you'll have to have a guess.\n\nSixteen pounds, five-\n\nEew.\n\nTwo ounces.\n\nHooey! Hoggett!\n\nHooey! Hoggett!\n\nThanks, Arthur. We'll be weighing the little pig tomorrow.\n\nWe'll phone you if you win.\n\nWhen you win, Arthur.\n\nWhen you win!\n\nCare to guess the pig's weight, sir?\n\nSupport the Lion's Club.\n\nOoh!\n\nWhat could we do with a pig, eh, Duchess?\n\nJust think. Two nice hams. Two sides of bacon.\n\nOh, and pork chops, kidney, liver, chitlins, pickle his feet.\n\n- Save his blood for black puddin'. There's the telephone.\n\nHoggett!\n\nGood news, Arthur.\n\nYou've won the pig.\n\nMice: Pigs are definitely stupid.\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n- What is it, Mom?\n\n- That's a pig.\n\n- They'll eat him when he's big.\n\n- Will they eat us?\n\nGood heavens, no! The bosses only eat stupid animals... like sheep and ducks and chickens.\n\nYea!\n\nIt does look stupid, Mom.\n\nNot as stupid as sheep, mind you. But pigs are definitely stupid.\n\nExcuse me. No, we're not.\n\nGood heavens! Who are you?\n\nI'm a Large White.\n\nYes, that's your breed, dear. What's your name?\n\nI don't know.\n\nWhat did your mother call you to tell you apart from your brothers and sisters?\n\nOur mom called us all the same.\n\nAnd what was that, dear?\n\nShe called us all Babe.\n\nPerhaps we shouldn't talk too much about, uh, family.\n\nI want my mom.\n\nThere, there. You've got to be a brave boy now. I left my mother when I was your age, and my pups will have to leave me soon.\n\nBut I'll keep an eye on you, if you like, just 'til you find your feet.\n\nThe little pig's a bit low. He's going to sleep with us... just 'til he finds his feet.\n\nUntil he finds his feet.\n\nBut, Mom, he'll wet the bed!\n\nNonsense! If you do want to do anything, you'll go outside, won't you?\n\nGood boy.\n\nYea!\n\nYeah! Yeah!\n\nStomp on him!\n\nWhat's your name, Pig?\n\n- What does he taste like?\n\n- Where did he come from?\n\nMice [Reading]: The way things are.\n\nComin' through!\n\nHey, get lost!\n\nWe've got to do something about that duck.\n\nOoh! Ooh!\n\nDoodle-loo-dee-doo.\n\n- What's that noise?\n\n- It's only Ferdinand.\n\n- What's Ferdinand?\n\n- He's a duck.\n\n- He wants to be a rooster.\n\n- He hates being a duck.\n\n- We'll catch him one day and eat him. Won't we, Mom?\n\n- Yes, dear.\n\nYech! Who'd want to eat a duck?\n\nBabe, you wait here.\n\n- Aren't pigs allowed?\n\n- Not live ones.\n\n- Sorry, dear. Only dogs and cats inside the house.\n\nWhy?\n\nThat's just the way things are.\n\nWhoa!\n\nOw! -\n\nPig-pig-piggy!\n\nOoh, what a spectacular feast I've got for you.\n\nOh, yes! What a lucky little pork chop you are.\n\nDelicious! Oh, yes! Yum, yum, yum.\n\nWho's gonna grow up to be a big, fat pig?\n\nYou are! You are! Yum, yum, yum.\n\n- Where are we going?\n\n- To work with the sheep.\n\n- What's sheep?\n\nSheep is animals with thick, woolly coats. And thick woolly heads.\n\nAnd men can't look after them without us.\n\nWhy do they need us?\n\n'Cause we're sheepdogs! Yea!\n\nNot you, dear.\n\nWhy not?\n\nWe have to do dogs' work. You're a pig.\n\nYour job is to stay here and eat your food.\n\nWe'll be back at the end of the day.\n\nThey don't think I'll remember. Well, I don't forget.\n\nSeems like a sheep's just born to suffer.\n\nHello? Excuse me.\n\nDarn wolf!\n\n- I'm not a wolf. I'm a pig.\n\nWhat are you?\n\n- Ewe.\n\nPig. What are you?\n\nI'm a ewe. A ewe!\n\n- You're a sheep!\n\n- I'll not be called a common sheep, thank you kindly. I'm a Border Leicester ewe. The name's Maa.\n\n- What's wrong with you, Maa?\n\n- Foot rot. And I got me a nasty cough. And I'm not as young as I used to be.\n\n- Seem like a nice young pig.\n\nWhat be your name?\n\nBabe.\n\nNot like them wolves. Treat you like dirt, they do!\n\nBite you as soon as look at you, those savages!\n\nBite you?\n\nAnd worse. Some wolves be so bad, they run a sheep down and tear it to pieces.\n\nFly would never do that!\n\nFly, is it? A right vicious creature she be, I'll tell you.\n\n- Not Fly.\n\n- All them wolves is cruel to sheep.\n\nAlways have been.\n\nBrutal savages!\n\nThat's what they be.\n\nI wouldn't want to see a gentle soul like you mixin' with the likes of them.\n\nNarrator: That afternoon when he saw Fly, the pig's mind was a tangle of questions. Cruel, vicious, brutal? What was it that dogs did in the fields all day?\n\nHello, Babe? Had a good day?\n\nBabe: Yes, thank you.\n\nNarrator: The old sheep had to be wrong about Fly. And the pig promised himself that he would never think badly of any creature ever again.\n\nCrime and Punishment!\n\nNarrator: The morning of the terrible crime... started like any other on Hoggett Farm.\n\nComin' through! Comin' through! Take off!\n\n- Now!\n\n- Up, up, up.\n\nNee-nee-nee-nee.\n\nHmm?\n\nI was worried it might have a harsh tone, but that's quite a nice musical ring. I walked into O'Halloran's Hardware, and there it was waiting for me.\n\nWhat a splendid way to wake up each morning! Hoggett, dear. Church.\n\nNarrator: When embarking on an audacious crime, a duck needs a willing accomplice. A creature who is reliable, beyond suspicion, and above all, extremely gullible.\n\nHey! Psst!\n\nWha\n\nWhat?\n\nYou look like an intelligent, sophisticated, discerning young fella.\n\nBabe: Who, me?\n\n- Yeah. Follow me. Oh, boy!\n\nAre you in for some fun!\n\nWhat are we doin'?\n\nWhere are we goin'?\n\nNarrator: Now the duck knew exactly what he had to do. The alarm clock had to go. His very life depended on it.\n\n- Do you see it?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- Good.\n\nSo I go through the kitchen, across the living room...\n\n- Good, good.\n\n- into the bedroom.\n\nGet the mechanical rooster and bring it out to you.\n\n- What about that cat?\n\n- But quietly bring it out to you.\n\n- Excellent.\n\n- I don't think I can do it.\n\nIt's against the rules. Only dogs and cats allowed in the house.\n\nIt's a good rule, but this is bigger than rules. This is life and death.\n\nIt is?\n\nMm-hmm. Follow me.\n\nHello! Look, there's something you should know.\n\n- Humans eat ducks!\n\n- I beg your pardon?\n\nMost ducks prefer to forget it, but the fact is that humans like to eat plump ducks.\n\nI don't think so. Not the boss.\n\nNot the boss's wife.\n\nOh, come on.\n\nHumans don't eat cats. Why?\n\n- Well, they're- -\n\nThey're indispensable. They catch mice.\n\nHumans don't eat roosters. Why?\n\nThey make eggs with the hens and wake up everyone in the morning.\n\nI tried it with the hens. It didn't work.\n\nSo I turned to crowing, and lo! I discover my gift.\n\nBut no sooner do I become indispensable than they bring in a machine to do the job!\n\nAh, the treachery of it!\n\n- A mechanical rooster!\n\n- Oh, dear me.\n\nOh, dear you?\n\nI suppose the life of an anorexic duck doesn't amount to much in the broad scheme of things.\n\nBut, Pig,\n\nI'm all I've got.\n\nWhy do you need me to do it?\n\n- I'm allergic to cats.\n\n- Oh.\n\nThey make me sneeze.\n\nBabe: Ahh. Don't worry. I won't wake the cat.\n\nMy life is in your hands.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nOh, no!\n\nAh, boy.\n\nNo, no, no!\n\nYour foot, your foot! Take the string off your foot.\n\nWait, wait. Let me put it this way. Stop. Turn around-\n\nShh.\n\nNo, no! The other way! Turn-\n\nNo, stop! Oh!\n\nStop! Stop, stop, stop!\n\nDon't, don't, stupid. Go outside... now.\n\nBabe: But you said you can't do without me.\n\n- I can. Trust me, I can.\n\n- Are you sure? You're positive?\n\n- Yes!\n\n- Go outside and stand guard.\n\n- Okay. Good idea.\n\nOh, boy. Want something done, you gotta do it yourself.\n\n- Hmm.\n\n- Guard against what?\n\nAhh! Ahh!\n\nDon't worry.\n\nStick with me and please,\n\nI beg you, not one more word.\n\nAll right.\n\nAah-\n\nBabe: Don't sneeze, Ferdie. Just hold your breath.\n\nAhhh-\n\nAh-choo!\n\nIt was my mistake. I was trying to loosen things up a little.\n\nBut, no. Today proves that it doesn't work.\n\nFrom now on, we'll all respect the rules.\n\nTo each creature its own destiny.\n\nEvery animal in its proper place.\n\nAnd a pig's proper place is under the old cart, not in the barn.\n\nAnd absolutely never in the house.\n\n- Is that understood?\n\n- Yes, sir.\n\nNow, Pig, regarding the company you keep. Being young, it's hard to discriminate, so I'll make it easy for you. I forbid you to talk to or consort with... that duck... ever. Have I made myself clear?\n\nUh... what's \"consort\"?\n\nIt means, young man, that you must not go anywhere near that duck.\n\nAs for the fugitive duck, when he shows himself, let him know this:\n\nBeing a duck he must behave like a duck.\n\nNo more of this crowing and nonsense.\n\nHe should accept what he is and be thankful for it.\n\n- That goes for all of us.\n\n- Here, here!\n\nNarrator: Rex continued long into the night. Elsewhere, there was more talk. The subject was Christmas dinner... and whether that year he main course would be roast pork...\n\nor Duck a l'Orange.\n\nAnd pork is a nice, sweet meat.\n\nThen there's the crackling.\n\nThat always adds interest and texture.\n\nGet him!\n\nGet the pig! Get the pig!\n\nGet the pig!\n\nGet him! Get him!\n\n- Psst!\n\n- Ferdinand!\n\n- Everyone's been looking for you.\n\n- Shh. Shh.\n\n- What is this place?\n\n- What's happenin' out there?\n\nRex isn't very happy.\n\nBoy, all these new rules!\n\nI'm not allowed to\n\n- Oops.\n\nNot allowed to what?\n\nHuh?\n\n- Piggy!\n\n- What? You didn't see me, all right?\n\nAnd I didn't see you. All right? Oops.\n\nNarrator:The time comes for all creatures... when childhood ends... and the doorway opens to life as an adult. And so it was with Fly's pups. Though that time was all too soon for Fly.\n\nPuppy, puppy, puppy.\n\nCome on.\n\nIn my pocket.\n\nFly?\n\nMay I call you Mom?\n\nNarrator: And so it was that the pig... found his place in the world of the farm. And he was happy, even in his dreams.\n\n- Hello!\n\n- Folks, how are you?\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\nHow's my favorite girl?\n\nNanny's got a jellybean.\n\nGive us a kiss.\n\nGuess what we're having for Christmas dinner.\n\n- Roast pork.\n\n- I hate pork.\n\nDarn silly carry-on,\n\nif you ask me.\n\nThe cat says they call it Christmas.\n\nChristmas!\n\nChristmas dinner, yeah.\n\nDinner means death.\n\nDeath means carnage!\n\nChristmas means carnage!\n\nChristmas means carnage!\n\nOooh.\n\nYes!\n\nWait.\n\nEatin' pigs! Blaah! Barbarians!\n\nYou're goin' back to the fields, Maa.\n\nOh, young'un, tragic there ain't more of your kind.\n\n- I'll be thinkin' of ya always.\n\n- I could come visit you, Maa.\n\nI'd like that, but-\n\nWell, we shouldn't hope for too much. Ooh!\n\nLa-la-la\n\nla-la-la#\n\nLa-la-la\n\nla-la#\n\nLa-la-la\n\nla-la-la-la#\n\nLa-la-la\n\nla-la-la-la-la, hey#\n\nNarrator: And so, it was Christmas Eve. And time had run out for the pig.\n\n- Are you doing him tonight then?\n\nGood.\n\nThe blood'll drain by morning.\n\n- Pity.\n\n- What's that?\n\nNothin'.\n\nWhat on earth are you babbling on about?\n\nShame to miss out on the best ham prize at next year's fair, is all.\n\nNice plump haunches he's gettin'.\n\nBeautiful. Still... silly to wait, I suppose.\n\nAway in a manager#\n\nNo crib for a bed#\n\nThe Little Lord Jesus#\n\nLay down his sweet head#\n\nBless all the dear children#\n\nIn your tender care#\n\nAnd fit us for heaven#\n\nTo live with you there#\n\nHere it is!\n\n- The bird.\n\n- Yuck. Chicken?\n\nNo, it's Duck a l'Orange.\n\nAnd, Mother, it looks absolutely superb.\n\n- I'm not going to eat any of it!\n\n- This is fabulous.\n\nFerdinand!\n\nIf you're out here, who's that in there?\n\nHer name's Rosanna.\n\nWhy Rosanna?\n\nShe had such a beautiful nature.\n\nOh, Ferdinand.\n\nI can't take it anymore.\n\n- Really!\n\nThe fear's too much for a duck. It eats away at the soul.\n\nThere must be kinder dispositions in far-off gentler lands.\n\nThe only way you'll find happiness is to accept... that the way things are is the way things are.\n\nThe way things are stinks! I'm not gonna be a goner. I'm gone.\n\nI wish all of you the best of luck.\n\n- Where will you go?\n\n- No idea.\n\nBut I'm a clever duck. I could do with an adventure.\n\n- I'll miss you, Ferdie.\n\n- Ferdie?\n\nNo one's ever called me that before.\n\nHey, good luck, Pig. Huh?\n\n- I am outta here.\n\n- Bye, bye.\n\nOw! Would you do me a favor, old thing?\n\n- Anything.\n\n- Open the gate, huh?\n\nHa-ha-ha! Whoa!\n\nNarrator: The pig knew it was against the rules to leave the farm. But something was definitely wrong.\n\nHow lovely, darling. What is it?\n\nIt's a fax machine.\n\nYou can send us letters by phone.\n\nNarrator: At any other time, the pig would've been tickled pink... by his first visit to the sheep fields. But now there was fear in the air. Maa and her kind were under threat.\n\nHey, Frank, feel like pork for dinner tonight?\n\nYoung'un, you're alive!\n\nBabe: Maa! What's happening? Who are these men?\n\nI'll get him out. Come around, Sniff!\n\nBabe: Where's our boss? It doesn't seem right.\n\n- What's wrong, dear?\n\n- It's the wrong one!\n\nI want the house I saw on the television!\n\nOh, there, there.\n\nGet! Quick!\n\nGet the dog in.\n\nOut of the sheep!\n\nCome on!\n\nLet's go!\n\nGood dog.\n\nGood pig.\n\nOooh.\n\nOooh!\n\n- Hey, hey. Dad says his little porker's a watch pig.\n\n- Dearie me!\n\nIf it's not a duck that thinks it's a rooster,\n\nit's a pig that thinks it's a dog!\n\nA pig that thinks it's a dog!\n\nBlue moon\n\nyou saw me standing alone#\n\nWithout a dream in my heart\n\nwithout a love of my own#\n\nBlue moon, you knew just what\n\nI was there for#\n\nA pig that thinks it's a dog!\n\nA washing machine, a radio, a new alarm clock.\n\nI think it's a lovely fax machine, darling, but can't you use it?\n\nWe already have one, Mom.\n\nThat's the whole idea.\n\nWe can send faxes to each other.\n\nDon't be afraid of it just because it's new.\n\nThese accounts are a real worry,\n\nArthur.\n\nEvery month your expenditure is greater than your income.\n\nIt's eating up your reserves.\n\nYou need to modernize, get some sort of cash flow going.\n\nYou're still using a horse and cart, for God's sakes.\n\n- Dad?\n\n- Funny, that.\n\n- What?\n\n- Those chickens, that pig.\n\nWhat's the pig got to do with anything?\n\nNothing.\n\nJust look at them. The browns and the whites.\n\nCome, Rex. Come, Fly.\n\nCome, Pig.\n\nCome, Pig!\n\nPerhaps he's pleased with you for what you did yesterday.\n\nI didn't do much.\n\nIf it wasn't for you, dear, they could've stolen the whole flock.\n\nIs Rex unhappy with me?\n\nOh, he'll be all right. Just stay out of his way today.\n\nWay to be, Fly.\n\nRex, come by.\n\nThat'll do.\n\nYou're so quick. I'd never be able to fly like you can.\n\nPigs aren't built to fly, dear.\n\nBut speed isn't the thing. It's attitude.\n\nThey just have to know who's boss.\n\nOut you go.\n\nMmm!\n\nGet 'em up, Pig.\n\n- He wants you to drive them out of the yard.\n\n- Away to me, Pig.\n\nRemember, you have to dominate them.\n\nDo that and they'll do anything you want. Go.\n\n[Babe started barking but the sheep laughed at him]\n\nThis is ridiculous, Mom.\n\nNonsense. It's only your first try.\n\nBut you're treating them like equals.\n\nThey're sheep. They're inferior.\n\nAh, no they're not.\n\nOf course they are!\n\nWe are their masters. Let them doubt it for a second and they'll walk all over you.\n\n- Fly, get that pig out of there.\n\nMake them feel inferior.\n\nAbuse them. Insult them.\n\nBut they'll laugh at me.\n\nThen bite them. Be ruthless. Whatever it takes. Bend them to your will.\n\n- Enough!\n\n- Go on! Go!\n\nMove along there, you-\n\nYou, uh, big butt heads!\n\nOw!\n\nYoung'un, stop this nonsense. What's got into you? I just finished tellin' what a nice young pig you be.\n\nMaa, I was just trying to be a sheepdog.\n\nHah! Enough wolves in the world already... without a nice lad like you turnin' nasty.\n\nYou haven't got it in ya, young'un.\n\nYou and I are descended from the great sheepdogs.\n\nWe carry the bloodline of the Ancient Bahou.\n\nWe stand for something.\n\nAnd today I watched in shame as all that was betrayed.\n\n- Rex, he's just a little pig.\n\n- All the greater the insult.\n\nI'm sorry I bit you. Are you all right?\n\nI wouldn't call that a bite, myself. You got teeth in that floppy mouth or just gums?\n\nYou see, ladies, a heart of gold.\n\nAhh. Heart of gold.\n\nNo need for all this wolf nonsense, young'un.\n\nAll a nice little pig like you need do is ask.\n\nThanks very much.\n\nIt was very kind of you.\n\nA pleasure.\n\nWhat a nice little pig!\n\nAll right, how did you do it?\n\nI asked them, and they did\n\nit. I asked them nicely.\n\nWe don't ask sheep, dear.\n\nWe tell them what to do.\n\nI did, Mom.\n\nThey were really friendly.\n\nMaybe Rex might be a little more friendly if I had a talk with him.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nI think you better leave that to me.\n\nRex?\n\nI know it was hard for you today... watching all that happening.\n\nBut surely it's not worth all this misery.\n\nPlease, dear, not on such a beautiful night.\n\nYou put these ideas into his head!\n\nTwo-faced traitorous wret-\n\nGet down!\n\nDown, Rex. Fly!\n\nNarrator: A dark cloud had descended on the valley. And the pig felt that the troubles were all his fault. But he was certain that he knew how to put things right again.\n\nOh, uh, excuse me, sir. But I-I-I think all this trouble-\n\nWell, it's not distemper.\n\nCan't be rabies.\n\nMust be the hormones.\n\nWhat about Hoggett's notion, the dog jealous of the wee pig?\n\n- I don't see that myself.\n\nNo. So what should we do?\n\nYou can keep him locked up or... snip, snip. I can do it Tuesday.\n\nNo.\n\nOr Wednesday.\n\nHoggett doesn't want the dog operated on. He's a breeding dog.\n\nI can sedate him, of course, but he'll be useless as a working dog.\n\nI'll give you pills to put in his food.\n\nGood dog.\n\nThe Sheep Pig.\n\nNarrator: A pig doing the work of a sheepdog? With Rex out of action and Fly injured from the fight, Farmer Hoggett had no choice.\n\nMaa! Maa! The boss has to give you some medicine.\n\nOh, dear, I thought so! It's horrible stuff, that.\n\n- I know, but it's for the best.\n\n- Young'un, if you say so.\n\nShoo! Shoo!\n\nNarrator: When the thought first came to him, Farmer Hoggett dismissed it as mere whimsy. But, like most of his harebrained ideas, it wouldn't go away.\n\n- What are they doing?\n\n- It's a sheepdog trial.\n\nSo it's like a competition for sheepdogs?\n\nAnd their bosses. It's like an obstacle course.\n\nHow do they decide who wins?\n\nIt's time and mistakes. You get points for how quick you are.\n\nAnd they take points off for every mistake.\n\nEvery time a sheep goes the wrong way, that's a mistake and you lose points.\n\n- Looks like fun!\n\n- For a sheepdog, there's no prouder moment.\n\n- Rex and I used to- - Hmm?\n\nNever mind.\n\nOh.\n\nWas Rex a champion?\n\nHe had the makings of the greatest champion there ever was, but it wasn't to be.\n\n- What happened?\n\nA while back when Rex was in his prime, the winter rains brought a great flood to the valley.\n\nRex and the boss got most of the flock onto the high ground.\n\nThen Rex went back to look for the strays.\n\nHe found them. They'd been stranded by the rising water.\n\nHe tried to herd them across to safety, but they wouldn't budge.\n\nToo afraid and too stupid to save their own skins.\n\nIt was freezing cold and the water kept rising.\n\nRex stayed with them right through the night.\n\nBy morning, the sheep were drowned.\n\nAnd when they found Rex, he was barely alive.\n\nOh, Mom!\n\nTwo weeks rest in front of the fire saw him back on his feet.\n\nBut his hearing was never the same again.\n\nHe'd never want anyone to know, but he's almost totally deaf.\n\nIs that why he's so, you know, angry?\n\nThat's not the half of it.\n\nAll this was barely a month before the Grand National Challenge.\n\nHe tried his best, but he couldn't hear the boss's calls, and it slowed him up.\n\nThe cold truth is that, but for the stupidity of sheep, Rex would've been the champion of champions.\n\nGood dog.\n\nThat's it, all right. Good.\n\nHere we go. All right.\n\nNow, through here like this.\n\nAnd then, big hook to the left. Big hook.\n\nBig hook. Through this gate here.\n\nNarrator: It was at that time that Mrs. Hoggett began to worry about her husband. But Farmer Hoggett knew that little ideas... that tickled and nagged and refused to go away... should never be ignored... for in them lie the seeds of destiny.\n\nClose the gate like that, and you're done.\n\nA Tragic Day.\n\nMom. Mom! Can we start work early today?\n\nOh, dear, it's not even dawn yet. You can go to work when the rooster crows. Oh, go back to sleep.\n\nAhem. Um, excuse me. Hello, sir. Excuse me, but it's nearly dawn, and-\n\n- What?\n\n- Sorry to disturb you. It's nearly dawn, and I wondered if you'd mind crowing just a few minutes early this morning.\n\n- Get out of here!\n\n- But, well, see I-\n\n- Get lost!\n\n- Oh, okay.\n\nNarrator: Now the pig understood why the sheep called all dogs wolves. And he was filled with a deep and terrible rage.\n\nBabe: Maa! Maa! Are you all right?\n\nHello, young'un.\n\nBabe: Oh, Maa, can you get up?\n\nI don't reckon.\n\nBabe: It's over, Maa. The wolves have gone far away. I'll get the boss up here to look after you. You'll be all right. You'll be all right! Oh, Maa! Maa!\n\nHome, Pig.\n\nNarrator: Fly knew that there was only one fate for any creature... that took the life of a sheep on Hoggett Farm. But Fly could never believe that Babe was a sheep killer, so she remained in the field to do something she'd never talk to the sheep.\n\nTell me. Who killed the old one?\n\nWolf!\n\nWolf. Is that the only words you half-wits know?\n\nWolf!\n\nAre you saying it was a dog?\n\nWhere's Babe?\n\nWas it wolf or Babe?\n\nWolf! Babe!\n\nNarrator: Farmer Hoggett was carrying something in the crook of one arm. A kind of black, shiny tube.\n\nCome, Pig.\n\nNarrator: The pig had a vague memory that shiny tubes produced food, and guessed that some quite unexpected surprise... would come out of two small round mouths.\n\nBabe! Wolf!\n\nBabe! Wolf!\n\nQuiet!\n\nNarrator: Fly decided to speak very slowly, for it was a cold fact of nature that sheep were stupid... and no one would ever persuade her otherwise.\n\nPlease, please would you be... so kind as to tell me what happened?\n\nQuiet!\n\nPlease, tell me what happened this morning.\n\nNarrator: The sheep spoke very slowly... for it was a cold fact of nature that wolves were ignorant... and nothing would convince them otherwise.\n\nBabe came! He saved us!\n\nThe wolves killed Maa.\n\nBut Babe drove the wolves away!\n\nThank you! Thank you! Thank you all very much!\n\nPleasure talkin' to ya.\n\nHooey! Hoggett! Hooey! Arthur!\n\nOh, there you are!\n\nWell, what do you think?\n\nThat was the police on the telephone.\n\nSaid there are wild dogs about.\n\nApparently the Mitchells lost six lambs this morning.\n\nWhat are you doing with that gun?\n\nOh, I\n\n- Nothing.\n\nMice: Pig of Destiny!\n\nNow, it's all very simple.\n\nJust half an hour at 350 degrees.\n\nI've given you rabbit casserole for Friday.\n\nNow, for Duchess, it's liver in the morning, heart for the evening.\n\nExcept Fridays, when it's steak in the morning, and cooked liver at night.\n\nWarm it up and fried a bit but test it, because she bites into it before she knows what's what silly darling.\n\nThat'll be the bus.\n\n- Oh, bye, bye.\n\n- Have a good time. Bye.\n\nHello, everyone!\n\nOh, dearie me, Valda.\n\nI know I have to be at the National Conference.\n\nI am the Assistant General Secretary of the Northeast Region after all, but I do worry about leaving that man alone.\n\n- Still acting a bit strange?\n\n- Just silly things.\n\nOdd little things only a wife would notice.\n\n- Still, he can't get up to too much mischief in three days, Kenny.\n\n- Of course not.\n\nGo on.\n\nGo on!\n\n- Oh! Good evening.\n\nShame about the weather.\n\nNasty cough!\n\nNarrator: It had been a long time since Arthur Hoggett... had had an animal in whose abilities he had so much faith. And with the National Grand Challenge Sheepdog Trials only two days away, he wasn't going to let the fact that his animal was a pig deter him. He had been worried, for he was a truthful man, that the heading might say \"Name of dog.\" And then whatever he put would be a lie. But as it happened, luck, for the moment, was running with him.\n\nIt's all right, really! I'm just, well Bless you.\n\nWhoa, whoa!\n\nUh, easy, whoa! Ah.\n\nOh, no.\n\n- So, ah... what's happening?\n\n- Oh, no.\n\nShh. Easy, easy.\n\n- Good pig. Good pig.\n\nHold still. Hold still.\n\nNarrator: There are many perfectly nice cats in the world. But every barrel has its bad apples. And it is well to heed the old adage, \"Beware the bad cat bearing a grudge.\"\n\n- How are you feeling?\n\n- A bit tired.\n\nYou'll need a good sleep to put you in top condition tomorrow.\n\nDon't stay up too late.\n\nGood night.\n\nGood night, Mom.\n\nOh, do forgive me for scratching you, dear. I got a bit carried away. It's a cat thing.\n\nOh. Well-\n\nBut oh-\n\nFeeling good about tomorrow, are you?\n\nMm-hmm. It should be all right, I think.\n\nI probably shouldn't say this, but I'm not sure if you realize... how much the other animals are laughing at you for this sheepdog business.\n\nWhy would they do that?\n\nWell, they say that you've forgotten that you're a pig. Isn't that silly?\n\nThey even say that you don't know what pigs are for.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n- You know... why pigs are here.\n\n- Why are any of us here?\n\nWell, the cow's here to be milked.\n\nThe dogs are here to help the boss's husband with the sheep.\n\nAnd I'm here to be beautiful and affectionate to the boss.\n\nYes?\n\nThe fact is that pigs don't have a purpose.\n\nJust like ducks don't have a purpose.\n\n- I don't- - All right, for you own sake, I'll be blunt.\n\nWhy do the bosses keep ducks? To eat them.\n\nSo why do the bosses keep a pig?\n\nThe fact is that animals that don't seem to have a purpose really do have a purpose.\n\nThe bosses have to eat. It's probably the most noble purpose of all... when you come to think about it.\n\nThey eat pigs?\n\nPork, they call it.\n\nOr bacon.\n\nThey only call them pigs when they're alive.\n\nBut, uh, I'm a sheep pig!\n\nThe boss's husband's just playing a little game with you.\n\nBelieve me, sooner or later, every pig gets eaten.\n\nThat's the way the world works.\n\nOh! I haven't upset you, have I?\n\n- Mom?\n\n- Mm-hmm.\n\n- Mom!\n\n- Good heavens!\n\nWhat on earth are you doing out in the rain?\n\nYou should be looking after yourself with such a big day ahead of you.\n\nAre pigs for eatin'?\n\nWho told you that?\n\nThe cat told me. Pigs don't have a purpose except to be eaten.\n\nIs it true?\n\nIt's true. For many pigs,\n\nit's true.\n\nSo my mother, my father, my brothers and my sisters, all- -\n\nProbably, dear.\n\n- Do you want to talk about it?\n\n- No, it's all right.\n\nI understand. I'll be all right.\n\nEven... the boss?\n\nYes, dear.\n\nOoh! Ooo!\n\nBabe?\n\nBabe!\n\nBabe!\n\nBabe!\n\nBabe!\n\nBabe's run away.\n\nRex?\n\nPlease?\n\nCall the boss.\n\nHe's over here.\n\nHold on, Pig.\n\nYou'll be home soon.\n\nHe's got a cold, but that doesn't explain a pig not eating.\n\nHe's got me stonkered, Arthur.\n\nBut I can tell you this.\n\nIf you don't get fluids into him soon, you're gonna lose him.\n\nC'mon, son. Pull yourself together.\n\nThe boss needs you.\n\nHere we go.\n\nCome on, Pig. Ah, come on.\n\nThere's my boy.\n\nCome on, then. Come on.\n\nIf I had words#\n\nTo make a day for you#\n\nI'd sing you a morning#\n\nGolden and true#\n\nI would make this day#\n\nLast for all time#\n\nThen fill the night#\n\nDeep in moonshine#\n\nIf I had words#\n\nTo make a day for you#\n\nI'd give you a morning#\n\nGolden and true#\n\nI would make this day#\n\nLast for all time#\n\nListen, Arthur, I'll tell you what we can do.\n\nYou're listed third, but we can put you last in the program.\n\nHowever, you must be here by 3:30; otherwise you'll be disqualified.\n\nAll right.\n\nAnd welcome back to the National Grand Challenge Sheepdog Trials... coming today from the Kingsmith Show\n\nGround in the heart of sheep country.\n\nThe weather's been patchy, but we've already seen some wonderful work by these talented dogs.\n\nStay there.\n\nExcuse me, sheep.\n\nHello! Hello!\n\nGood morning to you all!\n\nOh, boy.\n\nI've never met a sheep with such a strong, dark face.\n\nAre they feeding you well?\n\nBabe, I'll try.\n\nAll right, blockheads!\n\nPay attention over here!\n\nNow, you pay attention to what this pig has to say... or I'll come in there and rip you to shreds!\n\nHadn't thought of this.\n\nKeep trying, keep talking to them.\n\nI'll see what I can do.\n\n- Doesn't it look a picture?\n\nOur show ground on the telly!\n\n- Apart from the weather.\n\n- Look! There's your Bert!\n\n- Bert Ford and Sweep doing very well.\n\n- Sweep's having a little trouble with this gate, Clive.\n\n- A lot of trouble actually.\n\n- That's going to set Bert back.\n\n- Don't worry, Valda.\n\nJust a little slipup.\n\nLook, he's doing much better now.\n\nToo many loose sheep. And Sweep's usually such a reliable dog.\n\nHey, whoa. Stop!\n\nIf those sheep won't talk to Babe, the boss is going to look like an idiot.\n\n- I don't know what to do.\n\n- There is one thing.\n\nI gotta go!\n\nI'll try to be back in time.\n\nAhem. It must've been terrible weather for you, out in the field with all this rain we've been having.\n\nHey, that dog's in a hurry.\n\nCome on, Nick,\n\nI got a beer and a TV waiting.\n\nThe last entry is Pig.\n\nOwner, A. Hoggett.\n\n- Was that \"Hoggett\"?\n\n- I think it was!\n\n- Huh?\n\n- He said Hoggett.\n\nIt was clear as a bell.\n\nMust be another Hoggett. We only have the two dogs, and they certainly... aren't-\n\nWolf! Wolf!\n\nWolf! Wolf!\n\nShut up, you morons!\n\nThe little pig's in trouble.\n\nWhat trouble has come to our Babe, wolf?\n\nThe sheep at the trials won't talk to the little fellow.\n\nThey won't listen.\n\nHe doesn't know what to do.\n\nDon't know what we could do to help.\n\nIt's not right to give help to a wolf.\n\nYou wait here, wolf.\n\nYou'll have to speak up. I'm a... little hard of hearing.\n\nI asked you to wait here, wolf.\n\nDo what you're told by an old sheep for a change.\n\nWe'll see what we can do for you.\n\nWork completed. Restore power.\n\nVery frustrating to be sitting up here... wondering what's causing the delay.\n\nWe have someone on their way to the judges' rooms now.\n\nWe'll tell you what's causing the problem as soon as we find out.\n\n- Perhaps it's a drug test?\n\n- Yeah, it could be.\n\n- I've never heard of a drug test at a sheepdog contest before.\n\nWe've got somethin' here that might be of use to our pig.\n\nPassword! Password!\n\nBefore we gives you anythin', you'll be makin' us a solemn promise.\n\n- Yes?\n\n- Treat us civil!\n\nYes!\n\nYou gotta treat us nice-like.\n\nI'll try.\n\n- No bitin'!\n\n- That's right.\n\nWolf must avoid bitin' us sheep... at all costs!\n\n- All right! I'll try that too.\n\nI'll try.\n\nIt's preposterous! We'd be the laughingstock of every sheepdog organization... in every civilized country in the world!\n\nThere's no rule-\n\nWe'll see about that when the adjudication committee have finished their meeting.\n\nWhat will we have next year, a laughing hyena doing show jumping, I suppose?\n\nBut the most important of all, you must promise... never ever to let this password we be about to give... to be used against any sheep anywhere.\n\nI promise you that.\n\nI'll make sure the pig knows it too.\n\n- We have the promise!\n\n- 'Tis for Babe.\n\n- 'Tis for Babe saying.\n\nMaa would have wanted it.\n\nBaa, ram, ewe. Baa, ram, ewe. To your breed, your fleece, your clan be true. Sheep be true. Baa, ram, ewe.\n\nIs that it?\n\nIs that the password?\n\nMr. Hoggett, the judges would like me to convey to you... their disappointment that a man such as yourself, with a long and honorable association with the work of National Sheepdog Association, should see fit to flout... the historic conventions which have long ruled our sport.\n\nHowever we find there is no rule, as such, which would prevent your... animal... being entered.\n\nThe committee has ruled that if you wish to proceed, there is nothing we can do to stop you.\n\nWhat do you wish to do?\n\nThere appears to be some movement down there now.\n\nI expect if there are no further problems, we shall see Hoggett and his dog Pig.\n\n- Unusual name. Strange name, isn't it?\n\n- Pig.\n\nAnyone for a game of cards?\n\nOh, good grief! Look!\n\nHe's a fool!\n\nEntry number 23, Mr.\n\nA. Hoggett with Pig.\n\nThis is just too crazy to believe.\n\nAnd if that isn't enough. We have a stray dog on the field.\n\nThey trying to round him up?\n\nThe dog's gonna give a few tips on how to be a sheep pig.\n\nWell, it's up to him now.\n\nAway to me, Pig.\n\nGet off!\n\nBaa, ram, ewe. Baa, ram, ewe! To your breed, your fleece, your clan be true. Sheep be true. Baa, ram, ewe.\n\nWhat... what did you say?\n\nGet yourself a dog, Hoggett.\n\nThere, there, Esme.\n\nIt's not the end of the world.\n\nIs he just going to stand there until his time runs out?\n\nOr could this be some sort of protest?\n\nMaybe we should line up an interview with the sheep pig?\n\nOr the sheep pig's trainer.\n\nHe's a lively sort of fellow by the looks of things.\n\nGood heavens!\n\n- Hey!\n\n- Shh.\n\nIt's Babe!\n\nI-\n\nI-\n\n- It,\n\nuh- - Hmm.\n\nOh, beautifully done! I can't tell you how grateful I am to y'all.\n\nNow, for one last favor.\n\nIf the three ladies with collars would kindly walk out of the ring, I'd be very much obliged.\n\nNarrator: And so it was that in all the celebration, in all the hubbub of noise and excitement, there were two figures who stood silent and still... side by side.\n\nThe pig did it! The perfect score!\n\nYippee! Yippee!\n\nNarrator: And though every single human in the stands or in the commentary boxes... was at a complete loss for words, the man, who in his life had uttered fewer words than any of them... knew exactly what to say.\n\nArthur: That'll do, Pig. That'll do,"
