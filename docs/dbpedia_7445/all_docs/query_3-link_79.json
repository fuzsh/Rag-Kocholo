        "text": "Meet the little pig with big dreams this winter, in a new stage adaptation of Dick King-Smith’s heart-warming tale of friendship, adventure and bravery.\n\nWhen Babe arrives at Hogget’s Farm he is taken in by the trusty sheep-dog Fly and discovers a talent for herding. With the help of his adopted Mum, our polite piglet soon wins over the most suspicious of sheep. But can a small pig make it in a dog’s world and when his farmyard friends are in trouble can Babe save the day?\n\nThe Polka Theatre hosts this enchanting family favourite before heading out on a national tour, as the classic children’s novel which inspired the Oscar-winning film comes alive with plenty of laughter, thrills, stunning puppetry and original music, including a charming ‘baa-ber sheep’ quartet.\n\nAdapted by David Wood, author of Polka’s recent staging of James and the Giant Peach, follow the incredible story of one piglet’s rise to become the world famous Babe, The Sheep-Pig."
