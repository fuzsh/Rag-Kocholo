He knows he can’t be a sheep-dog. But maybe, just maybe, he might be a sheep-pig.\n\n‘An unexpectedly thrilling, funny charmer of a book’ – Guardian\n\n‘Dick King-Smith is a huge favourite with children’ – Observer\n\n***Winner of the Guardian Fiction Award***\n\nDick King-Smith served in the Grenadier Guards during the Second World War, and afterwards spent twenty years as a farmer in Gloucestershire, the country of his birth.\n\nMany of his stories are inspired by his farming experiences.
