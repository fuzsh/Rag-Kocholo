        "text": "Cat: Oh, do forgive me for scratching you, dear. I got a bit carried away. It's a cat thing.\n\nBabe: [laughs] Oh, well, but...\n\nCat: Feeling good about tomorrow, are you?\n\nBabe: Mm-hmm, it should be all right, I think.\n\nCat: You know, I probably shouldn't say this, but I'm not sure if you realise how much the other animals are laughing at you for this sheepdog business.\n\nBabe: Why would they do that?\n\nCat: Well, they say that you've forgotten that you're a pig. Isn't that silly? And they even said that you don't know what pigs are for.\n\nBabe: What do you mean, 'what pigs are for'?\n\nCat: You know, why pigs are here.\n\nBabe: Why are any of us here?\n\nCat: Well, the cow's here to be milked, the dogs are here to help the Boss's husband with the sheep, and I'm here to be beautiful and affectionate to the Boss.\n\nBabe: Yes?\n\nCat: [sighs softly] The fact is that pigs don't have a purpose. Just like, ducks don't have a purpose.\n\nBabe: [confused] Uh, I - I don't, uh...\n\nCat: All right, for your own sake, I'll be blunt. Why do the Bosses keep ducks? To eat them. So why do the Bosses keep a pig? The fact is that animals that don't seem to have a purpose really do have a purpose. The Bosses have to eat. It's probably the most noble purpose of all, when you come to think about it.\n\nBabe: They... eat pigs?\n\nCat: Pork, they call it. Or bacon. They only call them pigs when they're alive.\n\nBabe: But, uh, I'm a sheep pig.\n\nCat: [giggles] The Boss's husband's just playing a little game with you. Believe me, sooner or later, every pig gets eaten. That's the way the world works. Oh... I haven't upset you, have I?\n\n[chuckles softly]\n\nBabe: Was Rex a champion?\n\nFly: He had the makings of the greatest champion there ever was. But it wasn't to be.\n\nBabe: What happened?\n\nFly: A while back, when Rex was in his prime, the winter rains brought a great flood to the valley. Rex and the Boss got most of the flock onto the high ground. Then Rex went back to look for the strays. He found them. They'd been stranded by the rising water. He tried to herd them across to safety, but they wouldn't budge. Too scared and too stupid to save their own skins. It was freezing cold and the water kept rising. Rex stayed with them right through the night. By morning, the sheep were drowned. And when they found Rex, he was barely alive.\n\nBabe: Oh, Mum.\n\nFly: Two weeks' rest in front of the fire saw him back on his feet, but his *hearing* was never the same again. He'd never want anyone to know, but... he's almost totally deaf.\n\nBabe: Is that why he's so - you know - angry?\n\nFly: That's not the half of it. All this was barely a month before the Grand National Challenge. He tried his best, but he couldn't hear the Boss's calls, and it slowed him up. The cold truth is that, but for the stupidity of sheep, Rex would've been the champion of champions.\n\nFerdinand: Look, there's something you should know.\n\nBabe: Yes?\n\nFerdinand: Humans eat ducks!\n\nBabe: [Gasps] I beg your pardon?\n\nFerdinand: Ah, most ducks prefer to forget it, but the fact is that humans like to eat plump, attractive ducks.\n\nBabe: Ohhh, I don't think so. Not the Boss, not the Boss's wife.\n\nFerdinand: Oh, come on. Humans don't eat cats - why?\n\nBabe: Well, they're...\n\nFerdinand: They're indispensable: they catch mice. Humans don't eat roosters - why? They make eggs with the hens and wake everyone up in the morning.\n\nBabe: Right.\n\nFerdinand: I tried it with the hens: it didn't work. So I turned to crowing, and lo! I discover my gift. But no sooner do I become indispensable than they bring in a machine to do the job. Ohhhh-oh-oh. the treachery of it - a mechanical rooster!\n\nOld Ewe: We've got something here that might be of use to our pig.\n\nSheep, Sheep, Sheep: Password! Password!\n\nOld Ewe: Before we gives you anything, wolf, you'll be making us a solemn promise.\n\nRex: Yes?\n\nSheep: Treat us civil!\n\nOld Ewe: Yes, you gotta treat us nice-like.\n\nRex: I'll try.\n\nSheep: No biting!\n\nOld Ewe: That's right, wolf must avoid biting us sheep at all costs.\n\nRex: All right. I'll try that too. I'll try.\n\nOld Ewe: But the most important of all, you must promise never ever to let this password we be about to give to be used against any sheep anywhere.\n\nRex: I promise you that; I'll make make sure that the pig knows it too.\n\nOld Ewe: We have the promise!\n\nSheep: 'Tis for Babe!\n\nSheep: It's for his sake!\n\nSheep: Maa would've wanted it.\n\nOld Ewe, Sheep, Sheep, Sheep: Baa-ram-ewe. Baa-ram-ewe. To your breed, your fleece, your clan be true. Sheep be true. Baa-ram-ewe.\n\n[Babe's first attempt to herd sheep just got him laughed at]\n\nBabe: This is ridiculous, Mum!\n\nFly: Nonsense. It's only your first try. But you're treating them like equals. They're sheep; they're inferior.\n\nBabe: Oh, no, they're not.\n\nFly: Of course they are. We are their masters, Babe. Let them doubt it for a second and they'll walk all over you!\n\nRex: Fly! Get the pig out of there!\n\nFly: Make them feel inferior - abuse them, insult them.\n\nRex: Fly!\n\nBabe: They'll laugh at me.\n\nFly: Then bite them! Be ruthless. Whatever it takes, bend them to your will.\n\nRex: Enough!\n\nFly: Go on, go!\n\nBabe: [relieved that he's alive] Ferdinand!\n\nCow: If you're out here, who's that in there?\n\nFerdinand: Her name's Rosanna.\n\n[They watch the Hoggett family carve the roast duck]\n\nFerdinand: Why Rosanna? She - she had such a beautiful nature.\n\nBabe: Oh, Ferdinand...\n\nFerdinand: I can't take it anymore.\n\nCow: [disapprovingly] Really.\n\nFerdinand: The fear's too much for a duck. It - it eats away at the soul! There must be kinder dispositions in far-off gentler lands.\n\nCow: The only way you'll find happiness is to accept that the way things are is the way things are.\n\nFerdinand: 'The way things are' stinks! I'm not gonna be a goner, I'm gone! I wish all of you the best of luck.\n\n[Ferdinand and Babe are planning to steal the Alarm clock behind the dog house outside the Hoggett farm house]\n\nBabe: So I go through the kitchen, across the living room.\n\nFerdinand: Good, good, good!\n\nBabe: I go into the bedroom...\n\nFerdinand: Yup!\n\nBabe: ...Get the mechanical rooster...\n\nFerdinand: Yep!\n\nBabe: ...And bring it out to you.\n\nFerdinand: What about the cat?\n\nBabe: Oh, I'll *quietly* bring it out to you.\n\nFerdinand: Excellent.\n\nBabe: I don't think I can do it.\n\nFerdinand: Nah!\n\nBabe: It's against the rules. Only dogs and cats are allowed in the house.\n\nFerdinand: I love that rule. It's a good rule. But *this* is bigger than rules! This is life and death!\n\nBabe: What?\n\nFerdinand: Mmm-Hmmm... Follow me.\n\n[Ferdinand waddles into the dog house; Babe lingers at the entrance]\n\nFerdinand: Hello?\n\nBabe: [Babe enters the dog house]\n\nFerdinand: Look, there is something you should know: Humans eat ducks!\n\nBabe: [gasps] I beg your pardon?\n\nFerdinand: Oh, most ducks prefer to forget about it. But the truth is, humans like to eat plump attractive ducks.\n\nBabe: Oh, I don't think so. Not the boss. Not the boss's wife.\n\nFerdinand: Come on! Humans don't eat cats. Why?\n\nBabe: Well, they're...\n\nFerdinand: They're indispensable! They catch mice. Humans don't eat roosters. Why?\n\nBabe: Well, uh... I-I...\n\nFerdinand: They are indispensable. They make eggs with the hens and wake everybody in the morning. I tried it with the hens. It didn't work. So I turned to crowing... and Lo! I discovered my gift! But no sooner do I become indispensable, then they bring in a *machine* to do the job!\n\n[moaning in despair]\n\nFerdinand: Oh-ho! The treachery of it... A *mechanical rooster*!\n\nBabe: Oh, dear me.\n\nFerdinand: Oh, dear you?\n\n[Ferdiand sighs]\n\nFerdinand: [forlorn] I suppose the life of an anorexic duck doesn't amount in the broad scheme of things... but pig... I'm all I've got!\n\nBabe: So... why do you want me to do it?\n\nFerdinand: [groans] I'm allergic to cats.\n\nBabe: Oh.\n\nFerdinand: [sadly] They make me sneeze.\n\nBabe: Don't worry. I won't wake the cat.\n\n[Babe heads for the dog door in the Hogget's front door]"
