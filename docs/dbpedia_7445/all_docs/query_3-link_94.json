        "text": "MooShu’s antics have been on a low key this past week, as he’s more interested in eating, foraging and making his nest for the winter. So, I thought I would share some interesting tidbits on a rare pig breed I came across.\n\nThe Mangalica (or Mangalitsa in the U.S. and Mangalitza in Hungary) is often referred to as the “sheep pig” due to their wooly coat. Originating, and mainly found in Hungary, it is a domestic pig bred for meat production.\n\nLincolnshire Curly-Coated Pig\n\nThe only other known pig that had similar hair was the Lincolnshire Curly-coated Pig from England, which is now extinct.\n\nThere are three separate breeds of Mangalitsa currently in existence: Blonde, Swallow-bellied, and Red.\n\nBlonde Mangalica\n\nThe Blonde is the only pure-bred remaining in this line of pigs, as the other two breeds were a result of cross breeding.\n\nSwallow-bellied Mangalica\n\nThe Swallow-Bellied was produced through breeding the Blonde with the now extinct Black Mangalica.\n\nRed Mangalica with piglets\n\nThe Red is a result of cross breeding between the Blonde and the Szalonta Breed.\n\nThe other extinct pure-breds are the Wolf and Baris. (pictures unavailable)\n\nHungary is currently attempting to reconstruct these breeds from highly debated selective breeding techniques."
