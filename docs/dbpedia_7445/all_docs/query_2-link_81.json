        "text": "I really enjoyed this film and it was very heat-warming as well as having great morals.\n\nMy favourite animal is a pig so, naturally, my favourite character was babe. I loved how it was from an animals perspective and that the singing mice were at the end of each title. It was really clever how they made the movie like a book with different chapters and sections to the book. I think the plot was slightly hard to read but as the storyline flourished the plot became clearer and more enjoyable.\n\nI feel this movie gives a great moral. Even if your were not 'made' for something doesn't mean you can't do it. Like a sheepdog pig or as you may call it a sheepig. I love how the farmer always believed in babe even though he was going to eat him.. The ending was also very good.\n\nI also admired the leader sheepdog's courage and was sad to see him on a chain even thought he had done some thing wrong. His wife the other sheepdog was very kind to take babe in and care for him as one of her own.\n\nIn conclusion this is a great feel-good film and I would recommend it to any age and families. This is certainly a comedy and I would definitely watch it again.\n\nPrint this review"
