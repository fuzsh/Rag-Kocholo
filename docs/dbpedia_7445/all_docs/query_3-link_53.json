        "text": "‘Ready to go?’ I enquired. ‘Yes’. My grandson (6) was ready with his backpack at the front door. ‘My sheep are coming. And the other animals.’ His backpack was stuffed with multiple model sheep, and pigs, and ‘one calf’. ‘They’re the farm animals,’ he told me. ‘And the zoo animals are coming too.’ He’s been a model animal lover since he could first name them. His collection of model horses is more than his house can tolerate. A herd of black ones are now at my house. (A difficult negotiation between him and his mother).\n\nHe knows where each animal came from, and he knows if one is missing. To an undiscerning eye, a collection of 30 or so model sheep looks fairly indistinguishable one from the other. But to his eagle eye they are individuals. The same with the pigs, horses, cows, and goats. Sometimes he’s decided which specific individual one he wants to take to school with him. This is difficult. It means looking for it just as we are leaving. Also the chosen one can only go as far as the classroom entrance. Then it has to be handed to me to ‘look after it carefully’. I’m used now to going to the gym accompanied by a model pig or lamb and (last week) a life-sized black crow, ‘It’s for Halloween’.\n\nHe had the backpack because we were off to the horse races. He loves watching horse racing. Unfortunately, on the day the races were cancelled as torrential rain last week made the course unsafe. I got an email on the morning saying: ‘Due to overnight rain and the forecast of up to 40mm of more rain during the day, with no let up until late afternoon, we have made the difficult decision to abandon our Raceday today, 20 October.’ It was too late to abandon our travel plans.\n\nWe set off with the alternate plan of going to a farm. He was mollified when I said the farm had sheep (‘what breed?’) and horses. But still disappointed about the horse racing. I was too, as it had fallen on a teacher INSET day so there were no issues about taking him out of school to go to the races. And I now enjoy horse racing. I’m constantly delighted by the new things my grandchildren invite me to be interested in.\n\nThe trip involved a bus, two trains and a car ride. The second, 90 minute, train ride gave him/us time to read The Young Stock. It’s a great mag, sent to me to give to him by his aunt. I hadn’t seen it before. But ‘ Inside the 32 pages are facts and stories on farming and the countryside. …. We want to engage farming children to read factual content and for children from a non-farming background to be actively interested in our environment and food production.’\n\nSo, we learned, among other things, about all the equipment needed for lambing – resulting in a long discussion on why lambs have their tails docked with an elastic band (more learning for me), how to put slurry on fields, the lifecycle of frogs, and how avocados are grown.\n\nHe then cut out every picture of sheep and lambs (there were lots), and stuck them into his farm animal lift-a-flap book. (I’ve learned when travelling with him to have scissors and Sellotape at the ready). This book wasn’t in his backpack, but in the one his mum handed to me with his spare clothes, overnight stuff and books.\n\nHave I said that one of his stock phrases is, ‘When I am a farmer … ‘? His mum found out about the nearest Young Farmers group but you have to be 8. He’s very annoyed at the age restriction, but is not letting it overcome his determination to be a farmer. Daily, he’s practicing and learning about what the farming life involves. One of his favourite TV programmes is Down on the Farm, though he also likes programmes about Humbolt Penguins, another of his favourites – though not for his farm.\n\nThis farmer trait seems to have been born into him. Why, we don’t know as no-one in his heritage has been a farmer. When he was about 2 we bought him a book Farm Animal 1001 photos. It was 50p from a booksale. It’s the most used book and has enabled him to learn and identify the different breeds of sheep, horses, cattle, goats, chickens, turkeys and so on. So when we say, looking at a pig, ‘It’s a saddleback.’ He can confidently tell us whether we are right or wrong, and if we are wrong tell us what breed it is.\n\nHe has almost, but not quite, got the connection between farm animals and eating meat. He refuses to eat beef as he knows it is from cows, but he does love pork sausages, even though he knows it is from pigs. On on farm visit, we veered off the discussion on how pigs become pork when he got alarmed at seeing a butcher’s cleaver in a mock-up of a traditional pork butcher’s shop.\n\nHe may have given me the farming bug, as I watched an episode of This Farming Life the other day and was intrigued to see that in one of the families featured, the three boys had a model farm animal collection and were engrossed in playing out a story about their model animals being sold at auction (one of the three boys wants to be a livestock auctioneer). This, playworld running alongside them actually living on a farm, being with real animals every day, and attending life animal auctions.\n\nMy grandson’s sheep collection comprises mainly ewes (about 15), and one ram, with about 5 lambs. I wasn’t allowed to challenge his assertion that ‘the ram is in charge, and all the ewes have to listen to him.’ This included the ram telling the ewes when they could and could not drink water or eat sheep food. Then there was a whole episode of a model 2CV coming into the field of model sheep. The sheep all clustered round it. ‘The ewes are waiting for the ram to tell them whether it is an undercover police car’. Hmm.\n\nDogs are permissible in this young farmer’s world but not cats. ‘Cats have scary yellow eyes’. In fact he is very averse to cats and every time we see one on the street, which is often in our part of the world, we have to freeze and wait for it to slink off somewhere else. He won’t go near them. I don’t know where this response came from."
