Gave her a dose of arsenic, figured it will either kill the worms or her-- either way we were tired of dealing with her contamination efforts.. Cleaned her out better than prune juice.\n\nYeah, I had given her a dose of Cydectin on Saturday.\n\nJust waitin' for her to feel better.\n\nWas hoping to find a supplemental iron to help with the anemia.\n\nlol @ the arsenic!\n\nBut, yeah, I heard folks in the \"olde days\" used to use stuff like that!\n\nEllieMay said:\n\nYeah, I had given her a dose of Cydectin on Saturday.\n\nJust waitin' for her to feel better.\n\nWas hoping to find a supplemental iron to help with the anemia.\n\nlol @ the arsenic!\n\nBut, yeah, I heard folks in the \"olde days\" used to use stuff like that!\n\nmore common than you think, of the arsenic, even today.\n\niron is easy to find- TSC has it-- it's about the only thing they carry that we need, check the baby pig section.\n\nThat's good to know...iron in the baby pig section at TSC...thanks Cedar! Something to keep in stock for that just in case time.\n\nApple seeds have arsenic in them...we do let the sheep eat some from our trees, but have limited how many they get."
