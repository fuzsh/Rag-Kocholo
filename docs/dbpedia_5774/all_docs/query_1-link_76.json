        "text": "Considerable effort has been invested in developing methods for predicting the crystalline structure(s) of a given compound, ideally starting from no more than a structural formula of the molecule. Reliable computational predictions would be of great value in many areas of materials chemistry, from the design of materials with novel properties to the avoidance of an undesirable change of form in the late stages of development of an industrially important molecule. Methods used in crystal structure prediction are reviewed, with particular focus on the most common approach â€“ global lattice energy minimization. Progress and current limitations are highlighted, with reference to examples from the literature and the results of blind tests organized to objectively monitor developments in the field.\n\nThis analysis attempts to answer the question of whether similar molecules crystallize in a similar manner. An analysis of structures in the Cambridge Structural Database shows that the answer is yes - sometimes they do, particularly for single-component structures. However, one does need to define what we mean by similar in both cases. Building on this observation we then demonstrate how this correlation between shape similarity and packing similarity can be used to generate potential lattices for molecules with no known crystal structure. Simple intermolecular interaction potentials can be used to minimize these potential lattices. Finally we discuss the many limitations of this approach."
