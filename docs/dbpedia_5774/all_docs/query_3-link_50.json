The division consisted of more than 10,000 soldiers, primarily of the infantry branch, with supporting artillery. The division was not motorized, but instead relied on marching for the infantry units and horse-drawn transport for the support equipment.\n\nThe division was designated 73. Infanterie-Division in Germany.\n\nThe 73rd Infantry participated in the Invasion of Poland of 1939 as a reserve division of Army Group North.\n\nIn 1941, it fought briefly in the Greek Campaign. It was on the Eastern Front, in southern areas, from July 1941 through May 1944. As part of the 11th Army, it participated in the Crimean campaign in late 1941, including the initial assaults near Perekop and the \"Tartar Ditch\" as well as Sevastopol.\n\nIn the spring of 1944 it was cut-off by the Soviet forces in the Crimea and destroyed in Sevastopol in May 1944. Reformed soon after in Hungary, it participated in battles around Warsaw in the summer, at the end of July was routed by the Red Army's 2nd Guards Tank Army commanded by Alexei Radzievsky, and in September 1944 was destroyed by Soviet forces during their assault on the Praga suburb of Warsaw. The Army Group Center requested that the division be dissolved permanently as punishment for bad battlefield performance, but the request was rejected. Reformed again, the division was completely destroyed for the final time in the fighting around Danzig in 1945. The surviving divisional staff officers went down with the liner Goya on 17 April 1945.\n\nCommanding officers[]\n\nGeneral der Artillerie Friedrich von Rabenau, 26 August 1939.\n\nGeneral der Infanterie Bruno Bieler, 29 September 1939.\n\nGeneral der Infanterie Rudolf von Bünau, 1 November 1941.\n\nGeneralmajor Johannes Nedtwig, 1 February 1943.\n\nGeneralleutnant Dr. Friedrich Franek, 26 June 1944.\n\nGeneralmajor Kurt Haehling, 30 July 1944.\n\nGeneralmajor Franz Schlieper, 7 September 1944.\n\n[]"
