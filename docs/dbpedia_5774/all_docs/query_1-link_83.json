Thank, Ann in Texas [email protected] Aug. 30, 2006\n\nFAUST\n\nI have a Heinrich Faust born in 1750 whose parents were Abraham Faust (1716) and Sarah Catherine Mack. He had 2 sisters, Anna Marie and Catherine as wel as a brother Peter. Abraham's father was Melchoir (1679). His father was Adam Bernhard. I have more info if you want, I can e-mail it to you. Looking for information on Henry Foust (b. 1750). His parents were Johann Abraham Faust and Sarah Catherine Mack. He had 2 sisters, Mary and Catherine. Jerry, you mentioned:... a Heinrich Faust born in 1750 whose parents were Abraham Faust (1716) ... I wonder if a brother of Abraham named Heinrich is in your files. I found a court record in Montgomery county - see: FOUST, HENRY. Norriton. October 26, 1784. Anna Foust, Jacob Vanfossen, adms. This Henry might be ancestor to the grandchildren mentioned in Chester county will abstract of Mary Fox, who was actually the widow of Peter Vanfossen. He had used the name Peter Fox after moving to Chester county. Here is a part of that abstract. Fox, Mary. U. Oxford. July 25, 1797. Sept. 9, 1797. To sons John and William, horses, cows, etc. Remainder of cash to son William, except 2/6 to daughter Catherine. Also, Jacob, Benjamin and Nancy, each 2/6. Mentions 2 grandchildren, Abraham and Henry Foust. Executors: John Hook, James Lepber. I've searched in vain to find the grandchildren, Abraham and Henry Foust. Perhaps, you have a lead?

List of the real estates\n\n1840 - Abraham and Isaac Straub removed their extensive grain and lumber mills from the island opposite Milton to the mouth of Muddy run. They were the inventors of a reaction water-wheel, the first in the United States, and their operations were quite extensive. Their water power was derived from the river, dams having been constructed on both sides of the island; but the erection of the Lewisburg dam interfered with these arrangements, and hence the selection of a new location at the mouth of Muddy run. Chamberlin & Bisel, Yager & Bisel, John Ott, and W. B. Kemerer successively continued the business; on the 28th of March, 1874, the mill was burned, involving a loss of twenty thousand dollars. It was immediately replaced by the present building, a substantial frame structure http://www.webroots.org/library/usahist/honcpa16.htmlhttp://www.webroots.org/library/usahist/honcpa16.html NOTE: NOT OUR LINE....\n\n1844 - If Frederick Straub was born in 1844 in Union Co., PA, then we would expect to find him in the household of his parents in the 1850 census. There are two potential candidates in the 1850 census of PA, both in Chapman Twp., Union [now Snyder] Co.: 1) Frederick (ae 7, b. PA) in the household of Peter R. STRAUB (ae 36, b. PA). 2) Frederick (ae 6, b. PA) in the household of widow Mary STRAUB (ae 45, b. PA). There are no other Frederick STRAUB / STROUP's in any PA county in 1850 anywhere near age six. As I understand it, your Frederick is Frederick Whistler STRAUB/STROUP, b. Apr 1844 in Union Co., PA, who married Henrietta FORD and fought in the Civil War in the 44th Indiana Infantry. The other Frederick STRAUB / STROUP was born 24 Mar 1844 in Union Co., PA, and married first Rebecca Jane GLASS/GLASE/GLACE, whom he divorced 4 Oct 1882, then married second Rosa L. HAHN on 17 Oct 1882. He fought in the Civil War in Co. J, 53rd Pennsylvania Volunteers. The question, of course, is which parents go with which Frederick? Do you know the identities of any of your Frederick's siblings? Have you found him living near any other STRAUBS / STROUPS in his adult life? Based on the 1850 Census, Peter's children were Washington (17), Elizabeth (11), Benjamin (9), Fredrick (7), Sarah (5), Henry (3), and Anna (10 m); and Mary's children were Eliza (17), Rebecca (16), Solomon (12), Jeremiah (10), West (8), Frederick (6), and Lydia (8 m). It would obviously be helpful to find both Fredericks in the 1860 census. And if anyone knows the late husband of widow Mary and/or her maiden name, I'd greatly appreciate knowing. As for the name change from STRAUB to STROUP, it's an Anglicized phonetic misspelling. STROUP is *the* most common variation of the German/Swiss surname STRAUB / STRAUBE. These were illiterate farmers; they didn't know how to spell their name. It got written down however the particular clerk or census-enumerator happened to feel like spelling it. For a great many STRAUBS, the misspelling stuck. NOTE: NOT OUR LINE.....\n\n1844 - Frederick Stroup (b. 1844) was one of the sons of Peter K. Stroup (Misspelled \"Staub\" in the 1850 Chapman, Union Co--now Snyder Co--PA census.) The youngest child in the 1850 census is listed as \"Anna\" but is actually \"Emma.\" We have an article from 1939 in Michigan interviewing her about the pioneer days (on the occasion of her 89th birthday). She said she was born in Union Co, PA, near Liverpool (which Chapman is). She remembered passing through Grand Rapids, MI, in a covered wagon, in 1863, where her father stopped to buy supplies. He later homesteaded in the area which is now Lake Co, MI. Peter K. \"Straup\" received a land grant in 1870 for Chase, Lake Co, MI. And Frederick received a land grant in 1871 in the same area. Both appear in the Lake Co 1870 census, one right after the other in Chase. The family seems to have consistently spelled their name \"Straup\" in Michigan. But Frederick's Union Army records spell the name as \"Stroup\" and this is the spelling he adopted when he moved on with his own family to Kansas in the 1880's. Frederick had a brother Lewis (b.1854). There is a Lewis Straup of the right age in the Green, Mecosta Co, MI census of 1870. He was listed as a student and was living with Felix (age 57) and Lydia (age 51 or 54) \"Ekias\" or \"Eklas\" or some variant on that spelling. Both were born in Pennsylvania. Frederick had an aunt Lydia (and also an aunt Kate). It looks like Peter probably left Lewis in Green (perhaps with his aunt Lydia?) to finish school while he went on to homestead in what was later called Chase in Lake Co, MI. Chase isn't too far from Green--they both used the Paris post office. There are interesting multiple connections between the Straups and the Ford family in Mecosta Co. Peter had been listed in the 1850 Union Co PA census as married to Martha. But on Dec 3, 1863, he married Amanda Ford in Mecosta Co. A few months earlier his daughter Elizabeth married Ira Lee Ford in Green, Mecosta Co. Ira Lee Ford was Amanda's brother. Then, when Frederick was discharged from the Union Army he came to Michigan and married Ira Lee Ford's daughter, Henrietta, in the same area in 1868. (They're listed as marrying in Osceola Co rather than Mecosta Co, but it turns out that the Mecosta and Osceola Co lines changed around that time.) Then Lewis Stroup, Peter's son and Frederick's brother, married Lucetta Ford, who was a niece of Ira Lee Ford. Lewis and Lucetta had apparently gone to school together in Green. Back to Peter K Staub / Straub / Straup / Stroup. He is listed in the 1850 census as having been born in Pennsylvania, as was his wife Martha. But I have no info on her maiden name or on where in PA they were born. There was a Margaret Neiman, age 82, also living in the household in 1850. So I'm wondering if she was Martha's mother or Peter or Martha's grandmother. (And of course her name could have been misspelled also.) By the way, Peter and Amanda Ford Stroup had two children on the 1870 census: Willmetta age 3 and Delmore age 1. Amanda was born in \"Canada West.\" Peter is not listed in the 1880 census in Chase. I hope this info gives other people some clues. And I'd love to have some clues about Peter K's origins, parents, etc., and those of his (first?) wife, Martha. I wonder if Peter was related to the Straub's who founded Straubville, which is now called Freeburg, north of Chapman, in the Washington Township area of Union/Snyder Co. It is thought that these Straubs originally came from Freiburg in what is now Germany. NOTE: NOT OUR LINE....\n\n1845 - SAMUEL OHL, farmer, P. O. Buckhorn, is a grandson of Henry OHL, who came to this country from Germany many years ago and settled in Berks County, where his son, also named Henry, the father of Samuel, was born. Henry, with his brother, John, bought a tract of 300 acres, a part of which is the farm now occupied by our subject. This land was then mostly in timber but he cleared the greater part of it, and it is now a fine farm. Henry married Catherine, daughter of Daniel MERICLE of Madison Township, and eleven children were born to them, viz.: Elizabeth, widow of George SMITH, now living in Bloomsburg with her son; Eli, married to Joanna STOUFFER, and living on a part of the homestead; Henry, living in Michigan; Catherine, widow of Daniel SMITH, living near Buckhorn; Mary, wife of Seth SHOEMAKER, living in Buckhorn; Sallie Ann, who was married to Esau SHOEMAKER of Buckhorn and died leaving two children: Jesse, who had resided in the West, came home on a visit and died at his brother's house; Rebecca, who was married to Geo. HITTLE, and died near Buckhorn, leaving one child; an unnamed infant, and a son who died when a child. Samuel is the second child and was born January 29, 1820, in a house which stood near the site of his present residence. He has never lived off the farm on which he was born. He married, December 25, 1845, Marie B. STRAUB, daughter of Adam STRAUB of this township, who was born December 30, 1826. To this union eleven children have been born, three of whom died in infancy and Harriet L. when fourteen years old. The living are: Thomas J., who married Sarah, daughter of John BETZ, of this township, and now residing in Pittsburgh; Eli J., who is married to Amanda MUSGRAVE, of Greenwood Township, resides in this township; Margaret, wife of Hugh APPLEMAN, living in Hemlock Township; Amos, single and living in Pittsburgh; Sarah S., single and living with her parents; Anna E., also living at home, and S. Howard, who is married to Miss Mary YOCUM of this township, and works for his father. Mr. OHL has applied himself closely too his farming pursuits, refusing to accept any office. He and family are members of the Grange; he is a member of Van Camp Lodge, No. 140 of Bloomsburg, and, with his wife and family, a member of the Lutheran Church, in which he has been an elder for several year.(History of Columbia and Montour Counties Pennsylvania, Battle, 1887, pg. 485) NOTE: NOT OUR LINE....\n\n*** My Line - 1846 Annie E. (Straub) FAUST ( b. Mar 1846) is living in Allegheny City (now part of Pittsburg), PA, with husband William FAUST ( b. Dec 1850) and five children: Emma, Ida, Ella, Walter, and Violet. NOTE : Annie may have been born in Hesse Germany...1850 Census Pa. There's nothing to suggest Anna was married before she married William Henry FAUST, nor would it help us if she had been. She is Anna STRAUB (age 20) in the 1870 census (living with the FISCHER family), then Mrs. Anna FAUST (age 29) in the 1880 census (living with her husband, William Henry FAUST). The problem is that I can't find her in the 1860 census, where she should be age 9 or 10 (or possibly age 14, if she was fibbing about her age in later life). That doesn't mean she isn't there, it just means she isn't in the index at Ancestry.com. There are many reasons why someone cannot be found in a census index, and what I would normally do is give up using the index and do a page-by-page search of the township or county where I suspect the person should be. The problem with Anna is that she lived in Allegheny City, which became part of Pittsburgh. There is no way I'm going to do a page-by-page search of a big city, especially not when there's an easy alternative. As I said before, the most obvious, direct, and simply thing to do here is to get her death certificate. There's always a possiblity that the informant for the death certificate did not know the identity of Anna parents, but *most* death certificates include the names and birthplaces of the decedant's parents, so they are always worth getting. When available (which mostly means in the 20th century), death certificates should be routinely obtained, in any case, as documentation for your genealogy. I hope you will get Anna's, and I hope you will post here what you find out from it.You might also try for her marriage license. Again, it's documentation you should have, and there's a rare chance that it might name her parents.If the death certificate doesn't pan out, another avenue is to check is county court records, sometimes called \"Orphan's Court Records,\" because Anna was still a minor when she was living with the FISCHER's. Then, as now, a minor had to have a legal guardian, so if she was living with the FISCHERs because she was orphaned, they may have been her legal guardians. If Anna's parents were still alive, but she simply wasn't living with them, then there'll be no such court records.You can review what I have at my web site:\n\nhttp://dgmweb.net/genealogy/FGS/F/FaustWilliamHenry-AnnaElizabethStraub.shtmlhttp://dgmweb.net/genealogy/FGS/F/FaustWilliamHenry-AnnaElizabethStraub.shtml I have nothing beyond what is there.

Dec 1850) and five children: Emma, Ida, Ella, Walter, and Violet. - *** My Line - 1900/ 1930 In the 1900-1930 censuses, Anna gives the birthplace of her parents as Germany, but in the 1880 census, she gives their birthplace as Hesse, which is extremely helpful in narrowing down her parents because the majority of STRAUBS in PA are from Baden, Wuerttemberg, Alsace-Lorraine, or Switzerland.\n\n1910 and 1920 Censuses of Pittsburgh, Allegheny Co., PA, there is a widow, Mary STRAUB (b. ca. 1868), with five children: 1. Clara STRAUB, b. 1895/6 2. Emil STRAUB, b. 17 Mar 1898; d. Dec 1978, Pittsburgh, PA 3. Otto K. STRAUB, b. 29 Jan 1900; d. 14 Jan 1989, Los Angeles Co., CA; m. Amelia 4. Herman STRAUB, b. 20 Feb 1903; d. Apr 1983, Pittsburgh, PA 5. Helen STRAUB, b. 1905/6 The children were all born in PA. Mary and her late husband were born in Hesse-Cassel, Germany, and she immigrated in 1890. Try as I might, I cannot find Mary and her children in the 1900 census when, presumably, her husband was still alive. So, I'm seeking the name of Mary's husband -- and Mary's maiden name. For details, please see family group sheet at my web site: Note: Can't be our line , our ancestor states she was from Hesse and she listed her father as Frederick he may have been born about 1817....\n\n*** My Line - In 1910, Annie E.
