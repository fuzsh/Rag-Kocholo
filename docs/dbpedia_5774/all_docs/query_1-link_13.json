        "text": "Prussian Colonels-in-Chief 1792-1806: Cuirassier Regiments\n\nBy Stephen Millar\n\n�The next moment the plain [around the village of Hassenhausen] fairly rocked and trembled under the headlong charge of the Prussian cavalry as they came pouring on the French infantry. The shock was terrific; but that splendid body of horse recoiled from the blow as if it had fallen against the face of a rock instead of living men. The French threw themselves into squares, and the front rank, kneeling, fringed with their glittering bayonets the entire formations, while the ranks behind poured an incessant volley on the charging squadrons. These would recoil, turn, and charge again, with unparalleled but vain bravery. Prince William [of Prussia], who led them on, disdaining to abandon the contest, again and again hurried them forward with an impetuosity and strength that threatened to bear down everything before them.�\n\nJ. T. Headley, Napoleon and his Marshals [Ch. 4, Vol. I] c. 1850\n\nThe 13 five-squadron cuirassier regiments available for the Jena-Auerstadt Campaign usually formed two-unit cavalry brigades within each Prussian division (along with two infantry brigades). Unfortunately, these �mixed� divisions were not the ideal solution for waging Napoleonic warfare. While these �heavy� brigades provided the divisional commander with a mobile reserve, the cuirassier regiments were scattered throughout the entire Prussian field army � making it very difficult to co-ordinate a large-scale cavalry charge on the battlefield.\n\nThe majority of the cuirassier regiments in 1806 � nine in total � were assigned to Brunswick-Luneburg-Wolfenbuttel's main army. Cuirassier Regiment �Henckel von Donnersmarck� Nr. 1 and Cuirassier Regiment �Holtzendorff� Nr. 9 were brigaded together in Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen's army; Cuirassier Regiment �Wagenfeld� Nr. 4 and Cuirassier Regiment �Bailliodz� Nr. 5 went to L�Estocq's corps in East Prussia.\n\nCuirassier Regiment Nr. 1\n\nCuirassier Regiment �Henckel von Donnersmarck� Nr. 1 was one of two Prussian cuirassier regiments forming part of its colonel-in-chief's brigade (Grawert's division) at Jena.
