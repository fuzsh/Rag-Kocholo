Already in his inauguration speech AMADOU-MAHTAR M'Bow, Director General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, had emphasized, among other things, that in view of the rapid changes to which all societies are exposed and of the ever more intensely manifested phenomena of world-wide interdependency, all peoples seem to be ready to preserve the essential foundation of their existence, notably their cultural identity. At the same time, the cultural exchanges are increasing in numbers and intensity.1 It is exactly in this sense that the Programme of Work approved by the UNESCO General Conference assigns great importance to the problems of cultural identity and intercultural relationships. Among other things, interdisciplinary studies on a variety of aspects in the development of Slav cultures and their interrelations with other cultures are planned. In this broad framework is also included the collective study on the language and culture of Lusatian Sorbs and their role in safeguarding their cultural identity planned in the programme and supported by the International Association for the Study and Dissemination of Slav cultures. The Lusatian Sorbs, the only national minority in the German Democratic Republic, are descendants of the West Slavic tribes which settled in the region from the rivers Oder and Neisse to the rivers Elbe and Saale and partly far beyond in the 6th century. The real central Sorbian region was initially situated in the area between Elbe and Saale: Only later did the name Sorb extend to the other closely related tribes. The contemporary Lusatian Sorbs are immediate descendants of the Milzener and Lusatian tribes belonging to the Sorbian ethnic community. The settlements of the latter tribe approximately covered the region between the river Dahme and the woodland area at the river Bober. The southern neighbours of the Lusatians were the Milzeners whose centre was Budissin (Bautzen), a fortress first mentioned in 1002. The settlement area of the Milzeners extended to the region between Kamenz and Bischofswerda and reached up to the river Neisse and beyond.\n\n8\n\nMARTIN KASPER\n\nThe formerly self-contained language area of the Lusatian Sorbs has continually narrowed over the centuries owing to German colonization. In accordance with the present-day territorial administrative structure of the G.D.R., the Lusatian districts of Bautzen, Kamenz and Niesky, which are inhabited by Sorbs and Germans, belong to the county of Dresden. And also inhabited by Lusatian Sorbs are the districts of Hoyerswerda, Spremberg, WeiBwasser, Forst as well as Cottbus, Calau, Liibben and Guben, all of which belong to the county of Cottbus. In the course of historical development, this region was increasingly settled by a German population, at first in towns, and later also in the countryside. At present, the entire settlement area has a nationally mixed population. The share of Sorbs in this population has been continuously decreasing at present amounting to about one quarter. Also in the individual villages with a percentage of Sorbian inhabitants rather differs regionally being highest in the districts of Kamenz, Bautzen and Hoyerswerda in Upper Lusatia and in the rural district of Cottbus in Lower Lusatia. Demographic investigations carried out in about 1950 showed that more than 100,000 persons could speak the Sorbian language. 2 Exact numbers cannot be provided at present because the statistical surveys record neither the nationality nor the mother tongue. We may certainly assume that the number of those persons who declare that they are of Sorbian nationality is bigger than the number of those who speak the Sorbian language. In the Sorbian region of Lusatia, the Roman Catholic and the Evangelical Lutheran confessions come especially into the foreground. Among the Sorbianspeaking population, about 16 per cent profess allegiance to the Roman Catholic religion. The overwhelming majority of believers profess allegiance to the Evangelical Lutheran religion. Exact data cannot be provided, since the confession is not statistically recorded. The social and occupational structure of the Sorbian population has profoundly changed since 1945. The peasantry is no longer predominant but the working class determines the social structure. The former existing ethnically dependent social differences between Sorbs and Germans have been completely overcome. Today, there are no essential differences in the social and occupational structure of the German and Sorbian population.\n\nSome basic lines and distinctive features in cultural development of Lusatian Sorbs The Slavic tribes near the river Elbe were still in an early feudal stage of development when they were confronted with the eastward expansion of the Frankish feudal lords who could already rely on a feudal state. After violent resistance\n\nIdentity and Intercultural Relationships\n\n9\n\nthese Slavic tribes were subjugated. This had deep-going social implications. With the loss of political independence disappeared the prerequisites for the further formation of a state system of their own and for the development of an independent social organism. From now on, the social development of the Sorbian population is marked by integration into the social organism of the respective social formation and by complete dependence on the existing form of state. Both in feudalism and in capitalism, the respective leading classes whose representatives were'always Germans, were missing in the structure of the Sorbian population. The overwhelming majority of the Sorbs belonged to the masses of dependent and exploited classes and strata. The preponderant social stratum of the Sorbian population was the peasantry. Besides the peasants there were many artisans who lived mainly in the countryside but also in towns. Capitalist industrialisation set working power free also among the Sorbian rural population who became industrial workers. When they migrated from the countryside to the industrial agglomerations they were assimilated as a rule in the second or third generation. With the development of industrial production the number of workers increased. Together with the crofters they constituted in the early 20th century the social basis of the Sorbian national movement fighting for social rights and national equality. Until 1945, Sorbian culture, as the culture of an underprivileged group, was a marginal social phenomenon. From the Middle Ages until Hitlerite fascism, the ruling circles of the state had always impeded and suppressed the development of the Sorbian language and culture. In all these periods of oppression the Sorbs opposed forcible Germanization and struggled to preserve their ethnical identity. Contrary to the other subjected Slavic tribes who were finally absorbed in the German ethnic community, the Lusatian Sorbs succeeded in preserving their ethnical identity and in further developing the Sorbian language and culture. Following, the basic lines and most essential stages of this development will be described. With the loss of political independence in the 10th century also the social and political foundations for the development of a feudal Sorbian culture were destroyed. Many Sorbian noblemen had died in the fight against the German conquerors. Some Sorbian nobles converted to the Christian religion and were absorbed by the German nobility, others merged with the subjected dependent feudal peasantry. Under these conditions, no feudal Sorbian culture could develop. Apart from some exceptions, the creative cultural forces of the Sorbian people could manifest themselves mainly in the field of folk art. The feudal village community of the peasants, in its ethnical composition almost exclusively Sorbian, constituted the social basis for the formation, existence and functioning of the content, form and process of folk art. This was an expression of the creative forces inherent in the peopleand reflected in a specific manner the artistic and aesthetic needs of the\n\n10\n\nMARTIN KASPER\n\nfeudally oppressed Sorbian population and its ideas of values. Marked sociocritical accents have developed. The social backwardness of the village, the regional and cultural isolation of the peasantry from the urban population as well as language barriers brought about many features of regionalism, of archaism, and also conservative features. Language and folk art became a very important distinctive feature in ethnical terms. This function had first been imposed upon it also by the social discrimination against its representatives and their ethnical oppression at the hands of the ruling class. Only in the course of a long historical development ethnically integrating properties of folk art emerged increasingly in addition to its distinctive features in ethnical terms. These traits were mainly due to social factors. In this process, folk art became a demonstrative expression of relevant national attitudes and actions. This development reached a culminating point among the Sorbs in the 19 th century. The economic and social conditions under feudalism impaired the development of material culture, the products of which in the first line served to meet the practical needs of housing, clothing, and housekeeping. Handy, beautifully shaped adorned articles, serving everyday needs, testify to the artisan skills and developed aesthetic feeling of their creators. Among the material used particular importance was attached to wood, wicker-work, clay and iron. Great importance was attributed also to the adornment of clothes. Variegated was the work in the primarily language-based genres of folk art, encompassing many legends and fairy tales, as well as songs and music. However, there is little testimony to folk plays. The national epic is also lacking in Sorbian folk poetry. In the towns, a Sorbian patriciate could not be formed. Only in the late Middle Ages also the Sorbian part of the population acquired more importance in the flourishing Lusatian towns. In these circumstances, a Sorbian bourgeoisie and thus a bourgeois Sorbian culture could develop only late and only to a rather modest extent. From these urban strata came the few Sorbian humanists who worked at the universities in Krakow and Wittenberg. Although they were committed to their Sorbian background, their activities had no lasting impact on the development of Sorbian culture. The beginnings of Sorbian literature came with the Reformation. Lusatia had become almost completely protestant. The propagation of the Christian faith in the mother tongue as demanded by M A R T I N L U T H E R required translation into Sorbian of the liturgical texts that were needed for worship, since most Sorbs only spoke the Sorbian dialect of their surroundings and did not understand German. From these practical needs emerged the first beginnings of Sorbian writing. Some patriotically minded educated village pastors, mostly without any support from the church authorities, made the first translations into the dialects spoken in their parishes.\n\nIdentity and Intercultural Relationships\n\n11\n\nThe first full translation of the New Testament which did not go into the press, however, was completed in 1 5 4 8 . It was made by M I K L A W S J A K U B I C A from Laubnitz (Polish Lubanica). The work is based on a Lower Sorbían dialect which was spoken east of the river Neisse. The first printed Lower Sorbían book was the hymn-book with catechism edited by A L B I N U S M O L L E R U S ( 1 5 4 1 — 1 6 1 8 ) from Straupitz near Cottbus. It was printed in Bautzen in 1574. Only in 1597 did Pastor W E N C E S L A U S WARICHIUS ( 1 5 6 4 — 1 6 1 8 ) from Göda near Bautzen print a translation of L U T H E R ' S Catechism. The work of developing a written Sorbian language of these clergymen and of others not mentioned here who had strong ties with their people was of decisive importance for preserving and furthering Sorbian culture. The Age of Enlightenment led to new bourgeois cultural aspirations. Again, they were carried on by clergymen, but now they were no longer limited to the needs of the church. Worth noting are clearly occurring initial forms of a bourgeois national self-assurance, in which the Slavic component is already contained. At the same time, cultural endeavours increasingly shifted from Lower Lusatia to Upper Lusatia. The ideas of Enlightenment were spread in Lusatia amid tensions between the interests of the feudal nobility and those of the peasantry who were deprived of all rights and lived in feudal dependence. The misery of the peasants was connected with miserable conditions in the field of schooling and education. The peasants defended themselves against these inhuman conditions. The anti-feudal resistance included refusal to do corvée, complaints and flight and open uprising. The new view of the value of man and the defence of their natural rights made the rationalists also turn to the cultural values of the Sorbian people and to the Slavic world in general. Enlightenment manifested itself in the Lusatian region, last but not least, in the defence of the Sorbian people's right to exist, in an intensified research into Sorbian history, language and culture, and in a growing interest in natural sciences. A source of rationalist ideas at that time were the universities. For the development of Sorbian culture Leipzig, apart from Wittenberg, became especially important. It was there that in 1716 Sorbian students of theology united in a Wendish Preachers' College. From there emanated important stimuli for the promotion of Sorbian language and culture. In 1779, the Upper Lusatian Society of Sciences was founded in Görlitz. It became an important centre of German-Sorbian and, moreover, of GermanSlavic cultural encounters. As the \"first Sorbian rationalist\"3 it is necessary to mention M I C H A L F R E N C E L ( F R E N T Z E L , 1 6 2 8 — 1 7 0 6 ) who was the first to become aware of the close kinship between Sorbian and the other Slavic languages and who is considered as the real\n\n12\n\nMARXIN KASPER\n\n\"founder of the Upper Lusatian written language\".4 In 1709, BOGUMIT FABRICIUS (FABRIZIUS, 1681—1741) translated the New Testament into Lower Sorbian. Even more clearly the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment are reflected in the vast\n\ncreative work of ABRAHAM FRENCEL (FRENTZEL, 1656—1740). This scholar, whose\n\nworks fill 34 volumes and deal with the origin of the Sorbian language, the history, usage and customs of the Sorbs, the topography and natural history of Upper Lusatia, is regarded as \"one of the most important Slavists before JOSEF DOBROVSKY\"5 (1753—1829). With his \"Schutzschrift für die alten Slawen und Wenden\", printed i n 1 7 5 5 , HADAM B . SÜRACH (SCHIRACH, 1 7 2 4 — 1 7 7 3 ) b e c a m e o n e o f t h e\n\nfirst champions of an unprejudiced concept of the Slavs in Germany. More clearly than ever before, the idea of a new human being, natural right, JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU'S concept of the sovereignty of the people, were represented in the treatise \"Gedanken eines Oberlausitzer Wenden über das Schicksal seiner Nation\" b y JAN HÖRCANSKI (HORTZSCHANSKY, 1 7 2 2 — 1 7 9 9 ) published in 1 7 8 2 . T h e A g e\n\nof Enlightenment also led to the beginnings of an artistic secular poetry and to first attempts to found newspapers (1790, 1809—1812) which, however, soon fell victim to censorship. Rationalist tolerance and scientific research enhanced the social prestige of Sorbian language and culture, deepened in parts of the intelligentsia the ideas of national values which were consolidated by referring to natural right and the growing Slavic consciousness. The picture of Sorbs in the Age of Enlightenment saw the Sorbian ethnic community as a part of the Slav world which still seemednot very differentiated. Tracing the history, language, culture, usage and customs of the Sorbs back to the Slavic world was to legitimize the existence of this people and to explain its value. Starting points of a bourgeois national consciousness were emerging clearly. The concept of the Sorbs that was formed in the Age of Enlightenment was taken over by Romanticism and prepared the ground for the national ideas of values at the time of national rebirth. Throughout the 19th century, even until the 20th century, the principle of each people's natural right to exist as an ethnical group, which was founded in the Age of Enlightenment and reaffirmed by the idea of inter-Slavic cultural cognition, determined the essence of national selfconsciousness among the Lusatian Sorbs. The decay of feudalism and the inevitable transition to capitalist conditions led to significant changes in all social sectors. The whole of Lusatia was affected by deep-going economic transformations. After serfdom was abolished, new farming methods gradually developed. Thus, the old patriarchal way of life had to give way to the emerging bourgeois Sorbian culture. At first, peasants had great difficulties with the capitalist working system. It became an urgent necessity to master new farming methods and acquire agronomical knowledge. This aim was also served by peasants' clubs which were set up\n\nIdentity and Intercultural Relationships\n\n13\n\nin all parts of Lusatia. They also backed their resistance against the economic and political dominance of the Junkers. The capitalist transformation necessitated improved education. A prerequisite for this was education in the mother tongue which the authorities prohibited time and again. Among the Sorbian rural population, resistance was growing against forcible Germanization at schools. Gradually, the economic and cultural demands and aspirations were emerging. A national movement was formed whose social basis was provided by the Sorbian rural population. As a result, the exchange of information within the ethnical community increased. The intellectual and cultural life of the intelligentsia was at first concentrated in the university centres of Leipzig, Breslau (today: Wroclaw) and Prague. The narrow stratum of Sorbian intelligentsia broadened a little. Gradually, affluent peasants saw to it that their sons had a university education. The necessary changes in education had raised the prestige of the teachers. This reinforced the ranks of the Sorbian intelligentsia. Under the impact of the ideas propagated by the Great French Revolution, the words \"people\" and \"popular\" in the meaning of their bourgeois democratic content obtained greater importance. Increasingly, the people became the point of departure and addressee of the cultural endeavours of the intelligentsia. The intellectuals codified their mother tongue. They explored the history and culture of the people and described its ethics and customs. The educated circles recorded the folk art and aroused a growing interest in national costumes. It was professional men who promoted literature, songs, the theatre, as well as the press and education. All these efforts attached the intelligentsia to the people and exerted a stimulating influence on the national movement. This impact affected ever larger sectors of the people and marked their thinking and activities. In the university towns thé Sorbian students experienced the national movement of the German bourgeoisie. Above all, the national liberation movement of related Western and Southern Slavic peoples had a great influence on them. The Slavic component had an even greater influence on the emergence of a concept of their own national values. Especially close interrelations existed between them and Czech, Slovak, and Polish cultural workers. Mutual cultural relations with the Slavic peoples facilitated, promoted and accelerated the formation process of a bourgeois Sorbian culture and the propagation of national awareness among the Sorbian people. With the awakening of national awareness, the endeavours, aimed at cultivating the mother tongue and national culture as well as other distinctive national features acquired increasing political importance and became a stimulating factor in the aspirations for national rights and liberties. This development culminated in the setting up of the scientific society Macica Serbska (1845 to 1847) in accordance with a model of the Western Slavs. Social\n\n14\n\nMARTIN KASPER\n\ncommitment and close ties with the people — general features of cultural development among the oppressed Western and Southern Slavic peoples — also marked the content and forms of Sorbian studies united within the Macica Serbska. From the very beginning Sorbian studies were focussed on preserving and developing the cultural autonomy and satisfying the cultural needs of the people. The most important initiator and organizer of this movement was J A N ARNOST SMOLER (Schmaler, 1816—1884). His scope of activities was wide and multifaceted. He worked as an editor, publisher and journalist of newspapers and journals, modernized the Upper Lusatian orthography and promoted education at clubs. The endeavours aimed at consolidating and developing the Sorbian language were of great importance. They resulted in spelling reforms, a basic condition for the further development and spreading of literature and the press, of the written word in general. But the two main Sorbian dialects, the Lower Lusatian dialect of Cottbus, and the Upper Lusatian dialect of Bautzen, had already developed into variants of the written language which could no longer be merged into one common written language under the given circumstances. A rapprochement between the two Upper Lusatian dialects, the south-eastern one between Bautzen and Lobau and the dialect group spoken by the catholic Sorbs around Wittichenau and Crostwitz, was successfully worked at in the 19th century. Apart from the linguistic aspirations, much attention was devoted to collecting folk songs in line with suggestions made by JOHANN GOTTFRIED HERDER. The basis of the developing bourgeois Sorbian culture was still narrow, especially in the fine arts which could not become deep-rooted in Lusatian soil. K . A. KOCOR (Katzer, 1822—1904), a village teacher, became the \"founder of bourgeois Sorbian artistic music\" 6 . Already his first compositions attracted the attention of the poet HANDRIJ ZEJLER (Seiler, 1 8 0 4 — 1 8 7 2 ) . Their friendship developed into creative cooperation. ZEIJLER'S popular and patriotic lyrics which were put to music by KOCOR were taken up by the masses. Since 1 8 4 5 , choir festivals organized mainly by teachers, bore witness to bourgeois musical life. ZEJLER passes to be the real founder of Sorbian poetry. Sorbian national literature began with him. He became the poet of the people and of the national rebirth. Noteworthy was also the upsurge taken by journalism since 1842. Progressive-minded teachers, united in their pedagogical activities with a democratic attitude, devoted commitment to their people's education and the development of a national Sorbian culture. The most important feature of this broad-based cultural development was its close ties with the people. Science, education, the press and clubs contributed to the fact that the bourgeois national art gradually took roots among the people. It is proof of the vitality of the Sorbian people that they could accept and acquire these new cultural achievements. About the mid-19th century, a rapid capitalist development began in Lusatia\n\nIdentity and Intercultural Relationships\n\n15\n\nwhich in the late 19th century led to an intensive industrialization of central Lusatia. This had profound social and cultural implications. Especially after the emergence of the German Empire, the ruling classes stepped up their policy of Germanization by coercion which was only temporarily mitigated in the bourgeois Weimar Republic, and under the Hitler régime culminated in endeavours aimed at the complete liquidation of the Sorbían nationality. In all that time, more than ever before, Sorbian culture was in the service of national self-awareness and of the defence against increasing oppression. Sorbian national consciousness which was based on the progressive traditions of the popular movement and on Slavic solidarity, became the ideological basis in the resistance against Greater German chauvinism and against the fascist ideology. In the countryside, the capitalist development resulted in a rapid differentiation. Capitalism set free many working people. They had no longer any basis for existence in the countryside and were looking for work and wages in the industry. Those who migrated into towns and industrial centres as a rule lost their contacts with the Sorbian language and culture and became assimilated to the Germans. With the spreading of industrialization, the workers also had the opportunity of continuing to live in the countryside. With their life-style these Sorbian workers brought new aspects to the village, but retained their links with Sorbian language and culture. Now the peasant village community disintegrated finally. Wage work became the determining feature of social differentiation among the peasantry. In this differentiation process peasants developed into landlords, applying the capitalist system of farming, crofters, middling peasants and farmhands that became completely different social strata of the village. Farm work changed, and so did the way of life in rural areas. The traditional half-timbered and thatched-roof houses made way to spacious homes with extensive brickwork farm buildings. The rural artisans gave more and more way to industrial production. In the furnishing of living rooms, in clothes, hair-style and food the urban bourgeois models and customs were gaining ground. In the 19th century the men's national costumes disappeared in the entire Sorbian language area, and in the villages in the vicinity of Bautzen, also the women's national costumes disappeared. The increasing opening up of the village to the town and the changing farm work influenced community life as well. Customs that were connected with ancient rural production and with mythic ideas and superstition, decayed rapidly. Increasingly, the narrative traditions disappeared (such as fairy tales, proverbs, and folk songs), bagpipe and fiddle were replaced by brass bands, and the traditional folk dance had to make way to new-fashioned dances. Bourgeois clubs became the centres of convivial life. However, this process of replacement of folk art did not have a uniform course. In the remote regions of the Spreewald and the Central Lusatian Heath, folk culture was preserved for a long time to come in its original functions. The develop-\n\n16\n\nMARTIN KASPER\n\nment was different in Upper Lusatia, where the tempestuous processes of opening up the villages were in full swing in the mid-19th century already. Together with the different social structure, various and contradictory attitudes regarding the future of their own ethnical community manifested themselves. Within a relatively short period, a social regroupment took place under the leadership of the Sorbian national movement. The leadership that came from the affluent bourgeois circles, for the sake of economic interests wanted to bring about a conciliation with the ruling classes and were ever less willing to advocate the national interests of the people. New leaders from the circles of crofters and workers living in rural areas now became the heads of the Sorbian clubs and associations, devoted themselves to the care of Sorbian culture and opposed the increasingly chauvinist Greater German anti-Slavic policies. The social processes in the countryside and the increasingly anti-Sorbian governmental policy as well as resignation after the defeat of the 1848 Revolution temporarily led to a paralysing crisis of Sorbian culture. But in 1860 already a new upsurge became imminent. MICHAL H6RNIK (Hornig, 1833—1894) became the \"initiator of the national movement aimed at the needs of the people\".7 He endeavoured to link the struggle of large sections of the working rural population for social progress with the democratic demands and the increased efforts aimed at preserving and consolidating national self-consciousness. In many fields of Slavic science and of cultural activities, this talented and confessionally tolerant village pastor was indefatigably active. In 1860, he founded the first belletristic monthly review which could be published under its later name \"Luzica\" until it was banned in 1937.\n\nIn the early eighteen seventies, the Sorbian students organized in the Young Sorbian Movement. The Young Sorbs recorded many remarkable achievements in science and the arts, in cultivating the language and in cultural activities. From their midst came the important Sorbian poet JAKUB BART-£ISINSKI (1856—1909), a complete edition of whose entire work was published in 14 volumes only now. At his side was ARNOST MUKA (MUCKE, 1854—1932), an outstanding organizer\n\nof cultural life and an internationally renowned Slavist. Far more difficult even than in Upper Lusatia was the situation of Sorbian culture in Prussian Lower Lusatia. But there, too, young forces opposed the increas-\n\ning pressure. When in 1880 the ethnographer HENDRICH JORDAN (1841 — 1910)\n\nsucceeded in creating a Lower Sorbian section of the scientific society Macica Serbska, the cultural aspirations there were provided a firmer foundation and a broader basis. After the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, a rapid industrial expansion began in the region of Lusatia. At the same time, the lower village strata became rapidly impoverished. Land buyers of the coal magnates, court bailiffs and usurers tormented the villagers. Farmers' clubs, cooperatives, farmers' savings\n\nIdentity and Intercultural Relationships\n\n17\n\nbanks and credit banks resisted the pauperization of the working rural people under the leadership of energetic representatives of the peasants. These circles also opposed the suppression of the Sorbian language at schools and the German chauvinist cultural alienation of the villages. Cultural clubs of the Sorbian rural population defended their Sorbian mother tongue, cultivated the Sorbian songs, staged plays and propagated Sorbian literature. In the late 1890s the situation was mature for organizational links between rural and cultural clubs. Pressed by the rural population, A r n o S t B a k t ( B a r t h , 1870—1956), the organizer of the peasants' movement, stood for the Saxon diet election in 1911. Thus the democratic national rural movement reached a new culmination in its evolution. One year later, in 1912, delegates from 31 cultural and rural clubs were convened in Hoyerswerda by B a r t and Pastor B o G i j m i l S w j e l A (Schwele, 1873—1948) from Lower Lusatia and founded the Association of Sorbian clubs which they called Domowina (homeland). The association was created by the people and expressed its unflagging desire for survival and its demands for equal national rights. By founding the Domowina, the Sorbian national movement obtained a firmer organizational basis. As umbrella organization of all Sorbian clubs, the association directed cultural and educational work among the Sorbian population. It represented the interests of the people vis-a-vis the government. During the November Revolution of 1918, the social democratic government had promised the farmers it would distribute the estates of the big landowners. The Lusatian People's Party (Luziska ludowa strona), founded in 1919, struggled to make this promise come true. For many years, this party worked as the spokesman of the poor Sorbian rural population. But all its efforts were in vain. In contrast, the crofters' sales cooperatives and trading companies which had already been existing before First World War, continued to spread. Likewise in 1919, a separate Sorbian financial institution was created, the Serbska ludowa banka. In August 1919, the Constitution of the Republic, adopted by the National Assembly in Weimar, came into force. This document granted a certain constitutional protection to the non-German minorities, banned any discrimination against their ethnical development and facilitated cultural activities. The Sorbian national movement resolutely had recourse to these bourgeois democratic liberties. However, the basic law did not bind the state to guarantee and promote national autonomy of the minorities. The activities of the Lusatian People's Party were also aimed at the free development of the Sorbian language and culture. In 1919, the only Sorbian daily newspaper, \"Serbske Nowiny\" was issued, about 10 more journals and most of the Sorbian literature were edited and printed at the Sorbian publishing house, and a bookselling firm was created after the 2\n\nLusatian Sorbs\n\n18\n\nMARTIN KASPER\n\nFirst World War. In Saxony, a legal assertion that the Sorbian language could be taught at school had been obtained in 1919. The Association of Sorbian Teachers made great efforts to implement this law, and wrote Sorbian textbooks and directed the further education of Sorbian teachers. The scientific society Macica Serbska which also promoted research in history, literary history and ethnography deserves lasting praise for editing much-needed dictionaries and grammar books. Poignant social critique, resistance against national oppression, close ties with the people, and a multiplicity of forms marked the work of those writers who had renewed the Working Group of Sorbian writers founded in 1899. Noteworthy are also translations of world literature. The Sorbian daily newspaper serialized works of the most important representatives of Slavic literatures as well as translations of German, English and French literatures. Whereas in Lower Lusatia, war veteran clubs and Prussian military bands impeded Sorbian musical work, the choir movement in Upper Lusatia which had united in an Association of Sorbian Choral Societies, took a great upsurge. The traditions of choir festivals were revived. The most important creative musician of that time was B J A R N A T K R A W C (SCHNEIDER, 1861 — 1948). His work ranged from arrangements of folk songs, patriotic choral song and artistic solo song, via cantatas, mass and oratoria to chamber music and orchestral works. But the artistic revival was not limited to music only. Also the sculptors, painters, architects had organized in a working group. With his works marked by original artistic individuality influenced by the treasure of legends and myths, the painter M Ë R Ô I N N O W A K (NEUMANN, born in 1900) attracted attention also outside Lusatia. The aspirations to utilize the opportunities deriving from the Weimar Constitution for the active preservation of Sorbian culture, were increasingly opposed to the anti-Slavic easternpolicy of German monopoly capital, which had again consolidated its positions weakened in the war and was striving for a revision of postwar conditions. The most reactionary forces of these governing circles in 1933 abolished bourgeois democracy and set up their overt fascist dictatorship. Under these conditions, Sorbian culture in a specific manner reflected the interests, needs and demands of the Sorbian people which was threatened in its very existence. This culture was a decisive component of its national consciousness, of its national identity. Sorbian culture which, owing to the social situation, was above all amateur art and to a considerably lesser extent professional art, was relying on the Sorbian clubs regarding organization. Because a policy of oppression in an unprecedented way impeded the development of the creative potential and the acquisition of the cultural achievements by the Sorbian people all branches of Sorbian culture matured to contain a message deeply opposed to Hitlerite fascism and to have close ties with th£ people, as never before. Under the devoted slogan \"For our Sorbian people to the last breath\" the Domowina whose direction had\n\nIdentity and Intercultural Relationships\n\n19\n\nbeen assumed in those hard times by the teacher PAWOL NEDO ( 1 9 0 8 — 1 9 8 4 ) , defended the vital rights of the Sorbian people. In those decisive struggles the Domowina staunchly defended the cultural identity of the Sorbian people, the right to preserve and develop Sorbian language and culture and the continuation of the mutual cultural relationships with the cognate Slavic cultures, the Slavic autonomy of Sorbian culture and the national symbols of the people. Courageously, the Sorbian people defended these values of theirs despite any interdictions and thus acquired these treasures anew. Ever since, they have been an inalienable intellectual property of the people, more so than ever before. The surrender of Hitlerite Germany initiated a fundamental turning point in the history of the Sorbian people. The social transformations brought about in the territory of what is now the German Democratic Republic allowed and achieved the social, political and cultural emancipation of the Sorbian people. Lusatia today is an important centre of coal mining and energy production in the G.D.R. This development has fundamentally changed the social and occupational structure of the Sorbian population. Most Sorbians continue to live in the countryside or in town-like modern settlements. The character of farm work is changing with industrial working methods increasingly dominating. Divison of labour, specialization are bringing about new agricultural occupations. The rural population's way of life and of dwelling is more and more assimilated to that of the urban population. Among the work force the proportion of those is increasing who do not work in agriculture, but in major industrial undertakings, in transport, the service sectors, the health service or in other non-farming fields. Simultaneously with the changing social structure the educational standards, cultural interests and requirements, the entire way of life is changing. UNESCO has insistently been advocating the recognition of each people to preserve and respect for its cultural integrity. The function and impact of culture are ultimately determined by social reality. The implementation and safeguarding of a free existence and the development of the national features of each people and the mutual approximation, and mutual enrichment of their cultures are among the principles of the cultural policies in socialism. The socialist German state regards it as its duty to guarantee the Sorbs equal opportunities and to support this national minority in preserving and developing its traditional and contemporary cultural values. The preservation, cultivation and development of Sorbian language and culture therefore is one of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. The relevant article of the G.D.R.'s Constitution provides, that \"Citizens of the German Democratic Republic of Sorbian nationality have the right to cultivate their mother tongue and culture. The exercise of this right is encouraged by the state\". The real safeguarding of the free cultural development of the minority presupposes the support and promotion of the minority by the majority. The safeguarding of this right is in conformity with the respect inherent in socialist 2*\n\n20\n\nMARTIN KASPER\n\nsociety for the dignity, integrity and the creative intellectual potential of every people. Sorbian culture fulfils a twofold function under the present conditions. First and foremost, it constitutes an objective structural component of the Sorbian ethnical community, is an expression of its identity, of national development. At the same time, Sorbian culture is active today beyond its actual ethnical range. This is possible because, under social conditions in socialism, the social isolation imposed on Sorbian culture in the past has been overcome and its equality with German culture been implemented. As a special part of socialist national culture, Sorbian culture in its entirety enriches and determines the cultural life of society. Hence, the development of Sorbian culture and language are part and parcel and a result of the cultural development of the entire society. Sorbian studies, education, Sorbian literature, music, drama, fine arts, folk art and other cultural branches are flourishing in a manner unprecedented in Sorbian history. Since the mid-1950s, this process has been connected with a professionalization and institutionalization of culture. Today, several state institutions are devoted to the cultivation and development of Sorbian culture and language. Scientific foundations for Sorbian cultural development are being set up by the Institute of Sorbian Ethnography, a research establishment of the Academy of Sciences of the G.D.R. The edition of Sorbian literature in all fields, including Sorbian text-books and literature on the Sorbs in German is a task of Domowina publishers. This publishing house also brings out eight Sorbian newspapers and journals which are printed at the Sorbian printing firm \"Nowa Doba\". The German-Sorbian People's Theatre in Bautzen also stages plays in the Sorbian language, and the State Ensemble of Sorbian Folk Art is concerned with the cultivation and spreading of Sorbian culture at home and abroad. The House of Sorbian Folk Art, also a state institution, promotes the development of folk art and handicraft. The Sorbian professional artists are organized in special sections for writers, musicians, figurative artists, theatre and film workers which promote their work. The mother tongue is taught at kindergartens, at general polytechnical ten-grade schools and at two extended twelve-grade schools taking pupils up to A-level education in the Sorb language. Teacher students attend the Sorbian Teachers' Training College. Sorbian university lecturers attend the Institute of Sorbian Studies at Karl Marx University in Leipzig. The Domowina, the Association of Lusatian Sorbs, founded in 1912, banned by the fascists in 1937 and renewed in 1945, through the work of its members organized in local groups and district associations, makes a major contribution to cultivating and developing Sorbian language and literature and to consolidating national consciousness. This has had an impact on the development of the Sorbian language. Indeed, owing to the process of large-scale industrial production and to the change in\n\nIdentity and Intercultural Relationships\n\n21\n\nthe character of agricultural work and to an increased mobility of the population, this language has lost some earlier spheres of communication but has opened up some new spheres of communication and in certain spheres of social contacts, has become a norm of social conduct. At the expense of the territorial dialects, the supra-regional colloquial form has been consolidated.8 The broad process of cultural development equally encompasses the creative and the receptive sphere. The development of literature and art is characterized by a deepening of the aesthetic content, by an increasing artistic mastery and a wide range of subjects as well as by a multitude of styles, forms and genres. From 1976 to 1980 alone, Sorbian writers wrote 146 books, 125 major works of figurative art, 220 compositions, as well as 6 films with Sorbian themes were made. At the same time, the Sorbian publishing house brought out 119 text-books and over 400 new titles in the Sorbian language. The number of regular subscribers to Sorbian books increased by 58 per cent during this period. Between 1976 and 1980, the Bautzen Nationality Theatre staged 25 plays in Sorbian which were performed 244 times. The Domowina promotes theatre groups, choirs, literary circles, circles for textile design, for figurative art and for folk dance. In 1980, 117 such groups existed within the framework of the Domowina. Every autumn they are holding concerts which have already become a popular tradition. Similar examples could be given regarding the cultivation of customs and of folk art. Interest in cultural traditions is growing. The content and motive of traditional folk culture are included in a variety of ways in the professional arts. This is clearly reflected in literature, music, the visual arts and in drama. Folk culture is a source of contemporary professional art. It provides a basis for the national form of Sorbian art, lends it an unmistakable colouring and decisively determines specific national features. No individual culture can exist as an entity closed, to other cultural influences. Isolated each culture suffers decay. Further cultural development presupposes respect for other cultures and cultural interrelations. Each autonomous cultural development includes the preservation and development of its intrinsic cultural values and the adaptation of universal cultural values. These principles also apply to Sorbian culture. Especially close are its interrelations with German culture and with the culture of the cognate Slavic peoples. In the millennial coexistence of Sorbs and Germans, cultural influences and conditions have become effective which substantially characterized the development and the features of Sorbian culture. At present they are conducive not only and not even in the first place, to cultural assimilation but promote mutual approximation. There are many forms of expression inherent in this process. Certain ethnical and national peculiarities of Sorbian culture are effective beyond their ethnical sphere and are also respected and cultivated by the German population. This symbiosis is manifested in a multitude of ways: German cultural troupes in the\n\n22\n\nMARTIN KASPER\n\nLusatian region include Sorbían songs, music and folk dances in their repertoires. Sorbían folk customs and feasts enjoy increasing popularity among the German population. Of course, the Sorbs, who all have also mastered a good command of the German language, take part through German press, television, radio, film, literature, the theatre, etc. not only in German culture but also in world culture. On a new basis, traditional cultural interrelations with other Slavic cultures are developing. Because of the historical and linguistic kinship to the Slavic peoples, these ties are particularly close. Slavic cultural interrelations have significantly influenced the development of Sorbían culture since the 19th century. Particulary intensive was the influence of Czech, Polish, Slovak and Russian literature, music and painting. These traditions are continued and deepened today under the new social conditions. After the end of the war, translations were published of nearly all Slavic literatures. Anthologies of contemporary prose of other peoples are very popular. Only recently anthologies of Ukrainian, Byelorussian and Macedonian prose were published. Sorbían literature was translated into Czech, Slovak, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Byelorussian, Macedonian, Slovenic and other languages. Cultural exchanges are not, of course, limited to Sorbian-German and interSlavic relations. Noteworthy are also translations from French and English. It is quite natural, that increasing industrialization, the changing character of farm work, the process of village-town approximation, and other objective causes also have their cultural repercussions. In everyday culture and everyday life an almost complete internationalisation has come about regarding traditional content and forms, also regarding clothing and food. In the structural and residential spheres, no essential ethnically conditioned differences exist between Sorbs and Germans. This also applies to most sectors of material folk culture. Traditional agricultural instruments have lost their original functions since generations. Also the function of traditional national costumes has changed. They are worn only by older women, other wise on festive occasions and holidays or by cultural groups. A similar development may also be observed in the field of language. Large-scale industrial and agricultural production, mixed work teams, an increasing mobility of the population and their growing educational level, the increasing influence of the mostly German-speaking mass media, mixed marriages, and other objective causes favour the use of the German language. These developments do not eliminate the further flourishing of Sorbían culture which has great prospects under socialist conditions. Neither this introductory summary nor the individual studies in this volume claim to be exhaustive. Many issues had to be omitted, some could only be dealt with briefly. Nevertheless, the editors and authors hope that it has become possible\n\nIdentity and Intercultural Relationships\n\n23\n\nto outline the main trends of cultural development, the contribution of language and culture to preserving the ethnical identity of the Lusatian Sorbs and the role of culture in the process of mutual exchange between the peoples. Over many centuries, language and culture constituted an essential basis in the Lusatian Sorbs' struggle for preserving and maintaining their ethnical identity. Being a protection and intellectual weapon in the struggle against national oppression, culture as an entirety of intellectual values has to an increasing extent stimulated the aspirations of the people for social and national liberty. Despite many reprisals under antagonistic social conditions, the Sorbian people has mustered enough creative strength to preserve and develop further the inherited cultural values by incorporating these treasures into vivid relations with the progressive social development. Although Sorbian culture under antagonistic social conditions was pushed into the role of a social outsider, it has always been striving to break through the isolation imposed on it and to establish a creative relationship with the humanist values of German culture and, above all, with the cognate Slavic cultures, but also to participate in the treasures of world culture. By accepting and acquiring these values, Sorbian culture could renew and enrich itself. The function and impact of culture are ultimately marked by social reality as a whole. This regularity which was insistently underlined also at the UNESCO World Conference, is reflected in the Lusatian Sorbs' cultural development. Only after Sorbian culture had become an integral part of social and state policy in the G.D.R., were new ways and possibilities of development opened to it. The Lusatian Sorbs' culture, like any culture, represents an unique and irreplaceable total of values. This culture is making its own modest, but unmistakeable and irreplaceable contribution to the great treasure of world culture. In this contribution it is not decisive whether it is the culture of a big or a small nation. The culture of each nation contributes to the world cultural process with the achievements which serve the development and universal moulding of man, the development of the peoples to ever more perfect forms of social life, mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence.\n\nFootnotes 1 Ansprache des Generaldirektors der Organisation der Vereinten Nationen für Bildung, Wissenschaft und Kultur, AMADOU-MAHTAR M ' B O W , auf der Eröffnungssitzung der Weltkonferenz, in: MONDIACULT.

A Treatise on Cultural History B y J A N SOLTA\n\nThe Slavs settled the land between the rivers Elbe and Saale in the west and Oder and Neisse in the east in the 6th century A. D., during the migration of the peoples. The earlier inhabitants had left the country. The Sorbian tribes settled south of the line marked by the villages of Fürstenwalde—Köpenick (today part of Berlin) and Jüterbog—Zerbst (near the Saale estuary). Especially important for this treatise are the tribes of the Lusatians in the vicinity of the Spreewald and the Milzeners on the upper Spree with their tribal fortress Budissin as their centre. The Lusatians gave their name to the countryside Luzica—Lusatia. The land of the Milzeners in the south has been called Upper Lusatia since the turn to the 15th century. Consequently, original Lusatia was called Lower Lusatia. The early political development of the Sorbian tribes covered three major periods: firstly, the period from the 6th to the late 8th century, a time of comparatively peaceful conditions for an independent development; secondly, the period of wars with the Frankish and East Frankish feudal lords which began with the reign of CHARLEMAGNE in the Carolingian realm of the Franks (768 to 814) and lasted until the end of the 9th century; thirdly, the period of the defensive struggles against the expansion of the early feudal German state in the 10th century which ended with the ultimate defeat of the Sorbs and the loss of their political independence. The Slavic settlement in the 6th century which took a peaceful course, was of a peasantry character. The expansion to the east of the early feudal German state in the 10th century, a military project, was a conquest of the country by the lords. It was aimed at subjugating semi-feudal peasant peoples by aggressive feudal lords. The term \"feudal expansion to the east\" covers two different processes. On the one hand, the military and political occupation in the 10th century, which took place under the sign of the sword and the cross, so as by using Christianization finally to create a — though artificial — community of conquerors and subjugated, of exploiters and exploited. On the other hand, the taking in of a great number of people from western regions, beginning in the 12th century with the aim of the colonization of the peasantry and of settling artisans and merchants in the towns.\n\n26\n\nJ A N SOLTA\n\nAlso the local Slavic inhabitants were partly included in the colonisation plans of the feudal lords. The rural masses of the people of Slavic and German descent jointly cultivated the land. They were both antagonistically opposed to their German lords when struggling for safeguarding their interests. 1 The loss of independence in the late 10th century created a vital incision in Sorbian history. It compels the historian to face the following question: Is the history of the Sorbs now terminated? This question is being answered in various ways. For instance, \"Kindlers Kulturgeschichte des Abendlandes\" contains at the most some indications about the fate of the Sorbian tribes until their loss of independence. In the volume \"Die Slawen\", written by ROGER PORTAL, they do not appear. However, the variation of the subtitle of this work is significant. In the original 1965 version the formulation is \"Les Slaves. Peuples et Nations\" (Peoples and Nations), in the German translation and its inclusion as volume 20 of the \"Kulturgeschichte\", however, the title is \"Die Slaven. Von Völkern zu Nationen\" 2 (From Peoples to Nations). This seems to be a specification. The Sorbs, a Slavic people, belong to the group of peoples which have not developed into nations. In contrast to the method of excluding minor Slavic peoples is the tradition, stemming from the Age of Enlightenment, of taking them into consideration in standard works about the Slavs. We should like to point to SCHLÖZER and VON ANTON. AUGUST LUDWIG SCHLÖZER, who distinguished between the Wends (Sorbs) of Lusatia and the Winds (Slovenes) in Carinthia and at the same time considered Upper and Lower Sorbian as a unity 3 ; K A R L GOTTLOB VON ANTON, a German from Upper Lusatia, one of the fathers of Slavic studies in Germany, who also treated the Sorbian language in his works. 4 Related to both of them was JOSEF DOBROVSKY, who all through his life was concerned with the Sorbs, turned the attention of Slavic scholars to them and also recommended to them to visit Lusatia. 5 The number of study trips of foreign scholars to Lusatia was growing from decade to decade. The Sorbs, their language, history and culture were integrated into Slavic studies as a research subject and are a part of them. This is testified at present by the work of the International Committee of Slavists and the congresses of Slavists organized by it and by other international panels as well as by the research concepts of several important institutes. Apart from general scientific interest in the Sorbs, this certainly reflects also the topical question about their existence and their position as a national minority with equal rights in the socialist German Democratic Republic. The fact that independence was lost and that an independent political development in the late 10th century was prevented is one of the initial considerations of any description of Sorbian history. The authors of a first synthesis of the history of the Sorbs, the Pole WILHELM BOGUSLAWSKI and the Sorb MICHAL HÖRNIK, began their work by stating this particularity that the Sorbs \"lost their political\n\nHistory\n\n27\n\nindependence a long time ago or have actually never been able to develop it completely.\"6 Thus they belong to the group of nationalities without an independent national political history. The Sorbs lack any such traditions. This did not prevent them from \"waking up\" later on the way from feudal to capitalist society and from participating in the development of a national rebirth of the Slavic (and not only Slavic) peoples in Central and Southeast Europe. This contradiction in the historical development is also manifested in the history of some peoples of the Hapsburg monarchy, as of the Slovaks and Slovenes.7 The history of the Sorbs can be represented by at first looking at their interrelation, created in capitalism, with the bourgeois German nation. The Sorbs were associated with this nation as a relatively autonomous Sorbian nationality.8 The specific interrelations of this association have developed historically, ever since irom the loss of Sorbian independence a new situation emerged. As a tribe in feudalism, the Sorbs were an ethnic community without their own national aristocracy. In the middle-class population of the towns in the Sorbian region, in which the German population had an important share, the Sorbs saw themselves as inferior regarding their number \"and influence. The bourgeois transformation of society in the 19th century, excluding the rural bourgeoisie, did not result in the formation of a national bourgeoisie. An intelligentsia which was mainly rooted in the middle-class and the peasantry constituted the leading strata of the Sorbian nationality. Its not completely developed socio-economic structure distinguished it essentially from the German nation. Under these circumstances, Sorbian culture developed over the centuries as a peasant folk art. The self-consciousness of the Sorbs can be interpreted as an elementary consciousness based on the Sorbian ethnic substance and the underprivileged situation of the peasantry which was deprived of all rights under feudal status. At first, this self-consciousness had the quality of a primarily ethnical consciousness. However, the scientific recording and documentation of folk art, especially by J A N A R N O S T SMOLER (JOHANN ERNST SCHMALER) in the pre-1848 decade, is already an expression of a new national literature and national science, i.e. of a bourgeois Sorbian cultural development. The complete title of this standard folkloric work in the German variaAt is \"Volkslieder der Wenden in der Oberund Niederlausitz. Aus dem Volksmunde aufgezeichnet und mit den Sangweisen, deutscher Übersetzung, den nötigen Erläuterungen, einer Abhandlung über die Sitten und Gebräuche der Wenden und einem Anhange ihrer Märchen, Legenden und Sprichwörter\"9. In the endeavour to record the folk art, to relate to it and to sublate it in modern culture, is reflected the bourgeois movement of national \"awakening\". The bourgeois-influenced national cultural aspirations in the 19th century whose social basis was essentially provided by the social and economic emancipation of the peasants, were also deep-rooted in Sorbian cultural traditions. This statement\n\n28\n\nJAN SOLTA\n\ndoes not exclude the mutual cultural relations of the Sorbs with German culture on the one hand, and the Slavic cultures on the other. But these were relations on the level of mutuality in which the Sorbs had a part due to their own growing strength. The concept of \"mutuality\" was, according to EDUARD WINTER, a suitable expression for a \"positive development of cultural relations among the peoples.\" It excluded such constructions as \"the occidental idea\", \"different cultural levels\" and \"transfer of culture\" from west to east, \"terms which are so dangerous to peace in Europe\".10 He included in his publication \"Wegbereiter der deutsch-slawischen Wechselseitigkeit\" as representatives of Sorbían culture FRANC J U R I J LOK (FRANZ GEORG LOCK), bishop of Bautzen and advocate of the Age of Enlightenment, and the Pan-Slavist JAN PÉTR JORDAN, a Sorbían publicist and publisher.11 The biographies of other persons contain some significant references to the Sorbs.12 The aim of assessing and paying homage to the cultural achievements and interrelations of Slavic peoples in the history of European cultures on an objective scientific basis was also served by an international conference held in Berlin in 1976 on behalf of UNESCO at which, of course, the issue of Sorbían culture enjoyed appropriate attention.13 Autonomous cultural developments (also under conditions of links with the history of the German people) and cultural interrelations are being emphasized because especially with regard toSorbs any views of \"different cultural levels\" and of \"Slavic inferiority\" should be rejected.14 At that time, already, the literary historian JOSEF PÁTA from Prague drew attention to these problems.16 The folk art of the Sorbs was represented in a valid manner by the work of SMOLER, and we should like to remind the readers of this fact. The traditions beyond this object which prepared the bourgeois cultural development in the 19th century and helped mark the nationál issues in the Sorbs' historical consciousness will be outlined below by indicating some facts. It is important to emphasize Sorbían participation in the spreading of Protestantism at home and in distant countries as well as the long-time effects of the Reformation in the fields of culture and of school education as conceived by PHILIPP MELANCHTHON. With the exception of a minor region marked by the Upper Lusatian towns of Bautzen, Kamenz and Hoyerswerda, the Sorbs were affected by the Reformation. They assisted it in a variety of manners, especially in connection with the University of Wittenberg.16 In 1548, MIKLAWUS JAKUBICA completed the first translation into Sorbian of the New Testament, a manuscript which did not find its way to a printer's shop.17 The first books printed were ALBIN MOLLER'S \"Wendisch Gesangbuch ...\", also the \"Kleiner Catechismus\" (Budissin 1574) and LUTHER'S \"Kleiner Katechismus\" in the translation of W J A C L A W WARICHIUS (Budissin 1595)18. With his \"Unterricht, wie die Buchstaben in wendischer Sprache zu gebrauchen und auszusprechen seien\" WARICHIUS initiated the endeavours for a\n\nHistory\n\n29\n\nSorbian grammar. As a vicar in Goda he also held the office of inspector of the Latin Grammar School founded there in order to prepare Sorbian pupils for University. The first printed complete Sorbian translation of the Bible of 1728 also names Budissin as the town of publication.19 The confessional rivalry between catholics and protestants in Upper Lusatia caused the catholics to make efforts also to develop a literature of their own in Sorbian, whereas the estates of the March systematically promoted these activities of the protestants.20 Pietism, a progressive sub-current of Protestantism emanating from the University and the Francke Foundation in Halle, in the 18th century exercised, above all in the form supported by the Moravian Church in Upper Lusatia, great influence on the educational and cultural development among the Sorbs, but was violently combatted by the Sorbian advocates of Enlightenment because of its tendencies towards bigotry. All in all, it can be said for the Sorbian area that the vicarage, above all the Lutheran rectory, at that time proved to be a centre for the cultivation of education and of culture.21 The share of Sorbs in important intellectual and cultural movements has also gone down in cultural tradition which 19th-century Sorbian culture remembered. The activities and merits of those people are appreciated in special presentations of history, without taking into account their relationship to Sorbian in each particular case. M I K X A W S z DRJE2DZAN came from the circle of the Dresden Hussites, a partisan of JAN HUS in Prague and a theoretical pioneer of the peasant and plebeian wing of the Hussite movement.22 His outstanding role in the struggle of the Prague population has only recently been described by historical research. Although his personal activities have for a long time been unknown to the Sorbs, the unreserved siding with the Hussite movement of the \"Historija serbskeho naroda\" already and its inclusion in the further context of Sorbian history is well-known.23 This attitude which is to be attributed above all to coauthor MICHAL H 6 R N I K , a catholic clergyman, was influenced by the national tradition of the Czech people with whom the Sorbs felt linked with regard to language and culture. As a militant humanist, J A N R A K (JOHANNES RHAGIUS AESTICAMPIANUS) was at many universities in European countries a respected scholar and poeta laureatus open to the progressive spiritual developments, who in the last years of his life, from 1 5 1 7 to 1 5 2 0 , worked in Wittenberg, together with LUTHER and MELANCHTHON.24 He has a firm place both in German and Sorbian cultural history. This also applies to K A S P A R PEUKER, a son of artisans born in Bautzen, a physician and university professor in Wittenberg who advocated the ideas of his father-inlaw MELANCHTHON and above all worked for extending his university's relations with the countries of Southeast Europe and for the consolidation of Protestantism there.25 NIKOLAUS VON DRESDEN, JOHANNES RHAGIUS AESTICAMPIANUS, a n d CASPAR\n\n30\n\nJAN SOLTA\n\nare only a few eminent personalities who became renowned far out side Sorbian-speaking Lusatia. But the significance of the advocates of Enlightenment, of the Upper Lusatian Society of Sciences founded in Görlitz in 1779, and of the Josephinian reforms whose repercussions, coming from Prague, could be felt even in Upper Lusatia, are but a few examples. Incidentally, the late stage of the Age of Enlightenment in the last third of the 18th century developed into a preliminary stage or initiating phase of the National Renaissance Movement. Apart from other achievements, eminent advocates of Enlightenment have deserved great praise also for opposing pressure for Germanization of the ruling circles, for championing respect and protection of the Sorbian subjects' mother tongue and for demanding an extension of the school system on its basis. J U R I J M J E N (GEORG MÖHN) composed in 1757 a poem in verse \"Der sorbischen Sprache Vermögen und Lob im Dichterlied\" and translated into Sorbian poetry three chants from the \"Messias\" by KLOPSTOCK. These works are the most eloquent testimony to this attitude.26 In the opposition against Germanization are united the spontaneous actions of the masses of the people in some parishes and the work of scholars on a literary level. Some authors, such as NATHANAEL BOHUMÈR L E S K A (NATHANAEL GOTTFRIED L E S K E ) , Professor of economics in Leipzig, and ANDREAS TAMM, rector in Muskau and later a lawyer at Görlitz county court, supported the peasants in their antifeudal actions. They criticized the conditions of serfdom which were extremely far developed in Lusatia and demanded their abolition, protected the struggling peasants against calumniations, and postulated an agrarian reform in conformity with the principle of preserving, liberating and promoting the farmsteads. As a repercussion of the French Revolution of 1789 and of the 1790 peasants' uprising in the Electorate of Saxony the struggle of the peasants reached a climax. In 1794, the centre of the peasants' movement shifted from the region of Meissen to the Sorbian region of Upper Lusatia. Some examples are to show how the ethnic self-assurance of the Sorbs was gradually replenished with bourgeois aspects and what was the content of their awareness expressed in this context. JAN MICHAL BUDAR, an affluent lawyer and big landlord, in his testament made in 1767 instituted as his universal heir the entire \"Wendish poverty\" of the Sorbian settlement area, that is an entire people.27 BUDAR, who always sided with the corvée peasants who were struggling against the aristocratic landowners, was guided likewise by social and national considerations. In other cases, the emergent relationship of the Sorbian-German national association was already showing, if somebody committed oneself to being a Sorb and at the same time a German — the latter case with regard to the larger circle of German culture and also in view of his status as a subject of the German sovereign. The nationally conscientious Sorb MjEri in 1775 justified his Sorbian translation of PEUCERUS\n\nHistory\n\n31\n\nparts of the \"Messias\" made to prove the \"efficacy, richness of vocabulary and subtlety\" of his Sorbian language by asserting that \"Klopstocks Messias das erhabenste und majestätischste Gedicht ist, daß wir Deutschen (emphasis by J. §.) zur Zeit haben . . . \" (Klopstock's Messiah is the most sublime and majestic poem that we Germans [emphasis by J. 5.] have at present ...). 28 Apart from this dualism occasionally encountered in the Sorbian national consciousness we also ind a commitment of belonging to the big family of Slavic peoples, a feeling of kinship which was here and there also expressed by other Slavic peoples. Already PEUKER in a letter 1 5 6 6 to bishop JAN BLAHOSLAV, who had translated the New Testament into Czech, called the Czech language and his own Sorbian mother tongue \"lingua nostra\". 29 In 1 6 9 7 , MICHAL FRENCEL dedicated his Sorbian writings together with a note of welcome in Latin and Sorbian to the \"great tsar and grand duke\" PETER I, expected to visit Dresden, \"who with many thousands of millions of subjects speaks in our Wendish or Sarmatian language\". \"I am reporting most humbly to your Majesty the Tsar that we Germans and Wends here in Saxony also have the Apostolic Lutheran faith and teaching ,..\" 3 0 . Diverse as these statements may seem, they do testify to the increasingly bourgeois national content in the Sorbs' self-assurance. Sorbian history is not to be traced in detail here. We shall investigate the further formation of the Sorbs' historical awareness. In contrast to their national awareness it is more comprehensive and contains the latter as an integral part. If we agree with the considerations of M . A . BARG, then the historical consciousness is \"that form of social consciousness in which all three modes of historical time — past, present and future — combine\" and that proves to be \"a fundamental ideological characteristic of the culture in a given historical epoch.\" 31 The Sorbs did not arrive at such a mature historical awareness before the period of bourgeois transformation of society in the 19th century which is presenting itself in their history and culture as an \"awakening\" and \"national rebirth\". The antifeudal peasants' movement, the growth of capitalist factors in economic life and the political upheavals in the twenty-five years of the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and the liberation struggle against Napoleon undermined the late feudal agrarian and state constitution. In concert with the intellectual and cultural currents of that time, they provided the basis for the national renaissance of the peoples in Central, East and Southeast Europe. From the historian's viewpoint the concept of national rebirth cannot be limited to the \"spheres of culture and artistic creativity\", according to V . A . D ' J A K O V , it rather covers the difficult \"complex of closely interrelated socio-economic and political and ideological processes characterizing the transitional period from feudalism to capitalism\". 32 If we turn to the concrete historical events in the history of individual peoples, it should also be borne in mind that in social development there was not only a\n\n32\n\nJAN SOLTA\n\nphase-shift in relation of West and East, but, as L . SZIKLAY and E. BojTÄR emphasize, such a phase-shift also occurred among the peoples in East Europe.38 It is furthermore significant for Sorbian history that it was moving towards completing the association relationships between bourgeois nationality and bourgeois nation in the relations between Sorbs and Germans. It is here that the already mentioned problem of cultural interrelations with other peoples should be taken up again. In the Age of Enlightenment, chiefly in the second half of the 18th century, the accent was placed on Sorbian-German encounters. At that time, the eminent personalities of Sorbian culture were formed by the German Enlightenment. They maintained Sorbian-German cultural relations and were simultaneously reaffirmed in their proud attitude as Sorbs by these ties. The vivid activities culminated in the 50 years' jubilee of the Leipzig-based Wendish Preachers' Society in 1766, and in the early history of the Upper Lusatian Society of Sciences in Görlitz which was founded in 1779. Later on, Sorbian Romanticism also received first significant impulses from the Preachers' Society in Leipzig, although that town was not a stronghold of German Romanticism, as for instance Jena or Dresden. Also in the 17th and 18th centuries remarkable interrelations existed between Sorbs and other Slavic peoples which intensified in the last decades before 1800. At that time, in Bohemia and in other regions of the Hapsburg monarchy the domination of Jesuits was broken. In the wake of the Josephinian reforms, the world of ideas inherent to the Age of Enlightenment entered the educational and cultural spheres. Here it is necessary to point to JOSEF DOBROVSKY and his relationships with the Sorbs.34 The Sorbs who were living in Leipzig at the time of Romanticism already had creative exchanges with patriots of other Slavic peoples, especially of the Czech people. This applies especially to the years 1826 through 1828, the time, when HANDRIJ ZEJLER (ANDREAS SEILER) studied in Leipzig and was going through the first stage on his way to become the leading poet of Sorbian Romanticism. The farther on, the more the Slavic mutuality in literature and culture came to the fore in the international contacts of the Sorbs, although also in the first half of the 19th century important Sorbian-German contacts still existed. However, a shift of emphasis in favour of Slavic interrelations roughly since the 1820s is evident. During the ascendant phase in the history of the bourgeoisie, this trend was in no opposition to the development of the German people. Mutual relations between Slavs gave strength and shape to Sorbian culture, especially in the 1830s and 1840s. Comparing the national and cultural advance of Sorbs and Czechs, the already mentioned phase shifting is a striking phenomenon. The Sorbs orientated themselves on the progress in bourgeois development of the Czech people and benefited from advice and assistance from this side. This allowed them before 1848 to reduce their backwardness. In the late 1830s, the\n\nHistory\n\n33\n\nnational movement of the Sorbs was formed supported by the middle class and the peasantry, as it were, a specifically Sorbian manifestation of the antifeudal opposition movement in Germany, a manifestation that saw a new stage in those years. To summarize, Sorbian culture in those years was characterized by the following events: The language conflict continued unabatedly. The cultivation of language and of folk art was intensified. The cause of school education on the basis of the mother tongue was promoted. The Macica Serbska was founded in Bautzen. National choir festivals were launched. The confessional barriers between catholics and protestants were gradually reduced. The Saxon-Prussian barriers in Sorbian cultural relations were overcome. Newspapers were founded. This fact gave rise to publicity and to the emergence of a modern national literature, although modest in general. In the field of journalism, disputes were waged about the Slavic peoples, including the Sorbs. These nations were accused of Pan-Slavism serving the interests of tsarist Russia. This accusation had been voiced since the early 1840s by Hungarian and German liberal circles. Indeed, the activity of J . P. JORDAN and K. A. MOSAK-KLOSOPOLSKI ( K . A. MOSIG VON AEHRENFELD) in Leipzig made it clear that from the Sorbian side, too, assistance was given to the national and cultural endeavours of other Slavic peoples.35 The social and political differentiation in the ranks of the Sorbian intelligentsia continued, it reached its preliminary culmination in the year of the 1848 Revolution. The conservatives in the executive committee of the Macica Serbska and elsewhere defended the dynasties of princes in 1848, they refused to proclaim Sorbian national demands, suppressed Sorbian-Slavic contacts and disassociated themselves from the national movement. (From now on, the conservatives will in principle always be opposed to Slavic mutuality and work towards integrating the Sorbian minority into the ruling system of Junkers and bourgeoisie in Germany.) Liberals and democrats mobilized the Sorbian peasants, founded clubs for peasants and for education which in 1848/49 were merged into a central association with 2000 members (April 1849), they supported the peasants' petition movement and in this way extended and deepened the national movement. But it was only the democrats, above all Sorbian village school teachers, who really committed themselves to the social cause of the peasants, and on this basis accepted to join the consistent democrats on the German side and supported the demand for introducing a republic. Because, as the \"Serbski Nowinkar\", the newspaper of the democrats, wrote, democracy and monarchy would never agree. Already in the disputes about the accusation of Pan-Slavism in the 1840s, Sorbian journalists explained the position of the Sorbian nationality and its relation to the German people on the one hand and the Slavic peoples on the other. The Sorbs were said not to advocate their complete independence of German domination. They rather wanted \"to arouse national consciousness in a reasonable and 3\n\nLusatian Sorbs\n\n34\n\nJAN SOLTA\n\nopportune manner, form and preserve it without instigating hatred against the Germans\". Their cultural work was said to be devoted to the cultivation of their language and to scientific research, and these were indeed \"the aims by which Lusatian Slavs are chained to the others\". In contrast \"the political unity of a people is based on quite a different foundation than on the unity of language.\" 36 Proceeding from these principles, SMOLER by mediation of the German democrat ROBERT BLUM in 1 8 4 8 addressed himself to the constituent German National Assembly which was to work out a constitution at St. Paul's Church in Frankfurt, whereas he understood the Slavs' Congress in Prague as an affair of the Slavic peoples of the Hapsburg monarchy. SMOLER requested the inclusion of provisions in the constitution that were suitable to guarantee the rights of the \"Slavic inhabitants in Germany\", and this was done. The interrelations of the association of the Sorbian nationality with the bourgeois German nation were thus outlined. The democratic forces of the Sorbs connected with the national movement have always committed themselves to the principle of cultural interrelations with the Slavic peoples, even in the dark years of the Hitlerite fascists' policy of extermination. Is it correct to characterize the bourgeois transformation process among the Sorbs as a development leading from the late feudal social crisis and the Age of Enlightenment via an \"awakening\" to a \"national rebirth\", since finally \"only\" a nationality emerged that was associated with the bourgeois German nation, rather than an independent bourgeois nation? If those specific features of Sorbian history, which do constitute a reality, are really to be comprehended then this question must be answered in the affirmative. The national rebirth was described as a multifaceted and complex process. No less varied were its results. From the Sorbian peasant people of feudal times had emerged a bourgeois nationality which the same as the bourgeois nation was based on the socio-economic foundation of capitalist society, only that — as was already mentioned — it was lacking a fully developed capitalist class structure, and also a national bourgeoisie. Leading forces stemming from the middle class and from the peasantry proved themselves in the struggle for the emergence and growth of an autonomous bourgeois culture, which continued to have close ties with the people and relied on mutual relations with Slavic peoples. The bourgeois historical consciousness of the Sorbs had developed. This selfawareness was essentially a democratic view of history in accordance with the aspirations of the middle class. This attitude encompassed \"all three modes of historical time\". With regard to prospects, this viewpoint accepted a position on an equal footing for the Sorbian minority in a democratically organized German state. On this basis, a further development of Sorbian culture was advocated. With the defeat of the bourgeois democratic revolution of 1848, however, the\n\nHistory\n\n35\n\nprogressive potential of the middle classes had markedly decreased. A period of stagnation ensued in the second half of the century, and later, a new orientation commenced gradually. In 1871, a Junker-bourgeoisie régime was established owing to the unification \"from above\" of Germany into an empire, and this created a new situation. Antidemocratism, militarism, chauvinism, hostility against the Slavs were birthmarks of the empire which pursued a policy of severe oppression and Germanization against the national minorities. The minorities alone were unable to hold their own against the ruling classes. The German working class grew to become the leading social force that would once be capable of uniting all opposition movements against exploitation, oppression and reaction. The struggle of the working class was a genuine alternative to the state system of Junkers and bourgeoisie. The new revival of the national movement of the Sorbian middle classes and peasantry in the last three decades of the 19th century was accompanied by strong Slavic cultural influences. Indeed, the Slavic peoples in their overwhelming majority were waging a national democratic liberation struggle. Among them — also among the Russians — the Sorbs found moral support and to some extent material assistance. It proved to be a contradiction that on the other hand the forces of the national movement, Sorbian cultural creativity and Sorbian ethnography did not show any understanding for the ideas of the revolutionary struggle of the working class at home for a long time to come. The influence of class-conscious Sorbian workers on the national movement remained exiguous. Thus in the course 6f further development the subjective cognitive limits due to class conditions as well as an objective weakening of the middle-class strata impaired the political and ideological positions of the Sorbian democratic forces. As fundamental features of middle-class national limitations in the historical consciousness that was moulding the national movement and Sorbian culture, let us list the following : firstly, the long-time almost exclusive orientation to the peasants and, at the same time, an obstinate reserve towards the socialist workers' movement; secondly, an underestimation of the social factor in the national question, and the unilateral emphasis on ethnical viewpoints; thirdly, lacking comprehension of the real extent of common features in Sorbian and German history and, fourthly, a tendency to self-isolation inherent in the Sorbian ethnical community in and from capitalist Germany. Now, the historical consciousness outlined here should not be considered as something static. There were, for instance, disputes among the Sorbs, as above all about the Young Sorbian Movement in the 1870s and 1890s and about the foundation of the national Domowina organization in 1912/13. Influences of political conservatism and clericalism were repelled by the democratic forces. In the course of the aggravating class struggle in imperialist Germany before and after the First World War, the general democratic potential of the national movement was 3*\n\n36\n\nJ A N SOLTA\n\nstrengthened. First serious steps were made towards a policy of alliances with the socialist workers' movement and the Communist Party. In the years of Hitlerite fascism it became possible to isolate the reactionary elements among the Sorbs and to ward off all attempts of a fascist \"Gleichschaltung\". Interdictions and persecution then had to be endured, but the anti-fascist attitude of considerable population groups could be strengthened. Post-war Sorbian literature provides realistic documentation of how the anti-fascist conviction of many Sorbs was manifested in their actions, in their solidarity and support of those who were persecuted on racial and political grounds at home as well as of the forced labourers and prisoners of war. Apart from social and national motives (there existed \"Slavic interrelations\" on a completely new level) in many places also basic attitudes of people moulded by humanistic and Christian principles worked in this direction. Despite this field of vision which was enlarged mainly by anti-fascism, a middleclass national narrowness at first continued to be inherent in principle also in 1945 in those strata of the population which supported the national movement. Yet the Domowina, renewed on 10 May, began its activities as an anti-fascist democratic national organization. To the best of its ability it took part in solving the urgent tasks of democratic reconstruction in the country. In this revolutionary process of socialist transformation initiated by the anti-fascist democratic transformation of social conditions, also the formation of a Marxist-Leninist historical view of the Sorbian nationality was advancing. Equal national rights — their ideological preparation among the people, constitutional provisions and their implementation — constituted an element of the new order. It should not be forgotten that the Sorbian workers also benefited from all the other social and political achievements. Suffice it to recall the democratic land reform, the school reform, Sorbian cooperation in state administration — just to cite a few examples. They were old demands of the national movement that were fulfilled now. In the constitution of the German Democratic Republic founded in 1949, equal rights and the equal position of the Sorbs as the only national minority of the German state of workers and farmers were confirmed and ensured. Creation of equal conditions and thus state promotion for those sectors of the population which had formerly been put at a disadvantage due to their situation was one of the consequences of these equal rights. Critical acquirement of the cultural heritage, the struggle against petit bourgeois-democratic views regarding culture and history before 1945 meant both to overcome impeding thinking habits and to accept progressive aspects from outside and to continue Sorbian traditions of struggle against past ruling classes and their ideological concepts. The anti-imperialist struggle middleclass forces had waged before 1945 in an essentially defensive manner was now, under the conditions of a new ratio of forces between socialism and capitalism\n\nHistory\n\n37\n\nat home and abroad, continued along offensive lines from the positions of the working class. In subsequent times, this was conducive to enlarging the field of vision in the Sorbs' social thinking, but above all, it facilitated the comprehension of the interconnection between social and national issues as well as between national and international aspects. A deep-going understanding of the common features among workers of Sorbian and of German nationality in the history and in the present began. The ties of friendship in the coexistence of the two nationalities were consolidated by the development of association relations in the conditions of socialism. A new world-outlook moulded by the ideological and theoretical principles of the working class determines the intellectual and cultural aspirations of the Sorbs in the G.D.R., their socialist culture and their historical consciousness. The Sorbian literature of today vividly reflects this advance in the sphere of consciousness.\n\nReferences and footnotes 1 Cf. in this respect: H E R R M A N N , J.
