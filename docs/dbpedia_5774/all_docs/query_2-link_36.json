        "text": "132 folios on paper, watermark with a coat of arms (unidentified), modern foliation in pencil, 1-132, NINE WATERCOLORS, ONE GOUACHE PAINTING, ONE PEN AND INK DRAWING, ONE HAND-COLORED LITHOGRAPH, ONE COPPER ENGRAVING, some minor stains, ff. 49, 57, 88, 89 loose from the sewing, in overall excellent condition. ORIGINAL BINDING of mottled calf over pasteboards, covers gold tooled with a narrow foliage band forming a frame and small floral corner pieces, gilded initials on front cover “S.M.E.v.S.,” flat spine gold tooled with flowers and foliage bands, titled in gilt over a band of green leather “Dendmahle (denkmale) der Freundschaft,” gilt edges, patterned endpapers, leather somewhat rubbed on the covers and worn at the top of the spine, but in overall in good condition, kept within a contemporary slipcase of marbled paper, very worn. Dimensions 106 x 170 mm.\n\nLess studied than the album amicorum typically made for men, those produced by women offer insightful glimpses into women’s social networking. Sophie’s album, collecting 85 souvenirs from friends and family of eminent German aristorcrats, displays especially fine illustrations, mainly watercolors of charming allegorical scenes and romantic pastoral landscapes, many undoubtedly inspired by local views in the Polish countryside, where the family lived.\n\nProvenance\n\n1. This is the album amicorum of Sophie Beate Maximiliane von Seydlitz, née von Wiese und Kayserswaldau (1772-1853). She was abbess of the Czerna (Tschirnau) convent in Silesia. Inserted in this volume is an engraving of the Pilgramshain manor house, built by the Seydlitz family in 1838 (see f. 3). The entries were made in different parts of Prussian Silesia (today southwestern Poland and eastern Germany), between 1794 and 1822, with one addition in 1845. The album is published in Jahrbuch der Auktionspreise für Bücher, Handschriften und Autographen 41 (1990), p. 924, and the “Repertorium Alborum Amicorum” (Online resources).

The latter was promoted to a Bohemian baronial rank in 1718. The Seydlitz family included several court officials, chamberlains, state elders, intellectuals and generals of the Prussian army, among whom Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz (1721-1773), one of the greatest Prussian cavalry generals. The Seydlitz family seat was founded in Pilgramshain by Joachim Sigismund von Seidlitz und Ludwigsdorf in 1708. A new manor house for the family was built by Hans Rudolf Fedor Alexander von Seidlitz und Ludwigsdorf in 1838. Its classical style with clear lines is a rare exception to the neo-Gothic architecture of the time. The village was called Pilgramshain (“village of the stranger”) since 1318, and its eastern part Ludwigsdorf. A Protestant school was established in the village in 1758.\n\nThe album amicorum, or album of friends, is a booklet in which young aristocrats collected entries made by their friends and relatives. On the pages of the Stammbuch, as it was called in German, friends would usually offer poems, wishes, drawings and watercolors, signed with a date and current location. The album amicorum was popular from the sixteenth until the nineteenth century. It was initially favored by men in aristocratic, bourgeois and university circles, and entries were collected from acquaintances met during travels and studies. However, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the albums were increasingly made for women. The decoration was adapted accordingly, and the entries were collected more locally, from among the closest family members and friends. These albums were more intimate, and no longer served as collections of remembrances of fellow students or prized inscriptions written by great scholars of one’s time. Throughout their history, the albums usually assumed an elongated horizontal format, as is the case for our manuscript.\n\nThe album amicorum is central to modern transdisciplinary research studying texts, reception and collecting in cultural and social contexts and the history of mentalities; see especially the comprehensive study by Werner Wilhelm Schnabel published in 2003. And album amicorum owned by women bring another important dimension to social history, as we listen to the voices of women who have often been forgotten or left aside in the past.\n\nLiterature\n\nFechner, J.-U., ed.
