        "text": "Compiled by David A. Lossos Â© August 2018\n\nOne of my pet projects the last few years is the creation of a genealogical database in which everyone included is somehow related to St. Louis. In addition to my own personal and professional research I've entered data into a Legacy 8 database from the following sources:\n\n(A) \"St. Louis: The Fourth City, 1764 -1909\" Volume II and III by Walter B. Stevens (2,145 pages)\n\n(B) \"The Book of St. Louisans\" by John W. Leonard in 1906 (603 pages)\n\n(C) \"Edwards's Great West and Her Commercial Metropolis\" by Richard Edwards and M. Hopewell in 1860 (605 pages)\n\n(D) \"Annals of St. Louis in its Territorial Days from 1804 to 1821\" by Frederic L. Billon in 1888 (428+ pages)\n\n(E) \"Encyclopedia of the History of St. Louis\" William Hyde and Howard L. Conard in 1899 (2572 pages\n\n(F) \"Final Resting Place\" by Kevin Amsler (220 pages)\n\n(F) \"Tales from Bellefontaine Cemetery\" by Carol Ferring Shepley in 2008 (372 pages).\n\nIn this website I've listed 9600 marriages (occurring after 1950) of those known to have occurred in Missouri and Illinois (mostly the St. Louis Metro area).\n\nFind someone of interest and contact me for possibly more info - Dave Lossos at [email protected]\n\nTo return to the \"Genealogy in St. Louis\" Web Site click here."
