        "text": "Here's my substantially complete bust of Admiral Canaris, wartime chief of the Amt Ausland/Abwehr or German Intelligence Service (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abwehr). I am starting a new string to show the sculpt and the painting of it, mostly because I want to break the link with my earlier terrible first attempt. This is a bit better, although my wife says the dog looks a bit like a muppet. I hope he looks better with paint. That's my first attempt at sculpting a dog and a wire haired dachshund ain't easy. Canaris had two of these - Sabine and Seppel (later replaced by Kasper). He doted on them and a sure fire way of ending your career in the Abwehr was to scold one of Canaris' pets.\n\nYou probably know that Canaris was a key supporting member of the German Resistance, providing cover for an active conspiratorial group in the Abwehr, saving Jews and foiling some of Hitler's plans in a way that decisively changed the course of the war. When his personal diary was found at OKH HQ in Zossen in early 1945, he was tried and executed on Hitler's direct order. The execution occurred on April 9, 1945, two weeks before allied troops liberated KZ Flossenburg, where he and his small group of resisters were being held. Also executed were Generalmajor Hans Oster (who gave away German invasion secrets to the Allies in 1939), Karl Sack (Judge Advocate General of the German Armed Forces), Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer (now seen as the closest thing there is to a Protestant saint), his brother-in-law Hans von Dohnanyi (killed at KZ Sachsenhausen; Dohnanyi was a mainstay of the German resistance against Hitler 1938 - 1945), General der Artillerie Friedrich von Rabenau (of the Goerdeler/Beck circle), and two Abwehr captains involved in the July plot - Ludwig Gehre and Theodor Struenck.\n\nThe bust is sculpted in a combination of Sculpey firm (head & dog head) and Magic sculpt.\n\nI will be painting him in acrylics and inks, as per usual. Here's the uniform and medal bar.\n\nColin\n\nThanks gents - by way of self critique I will say that I am fairly happy with his face. I think I should have made his shoulders wider (although they do look narrower than actual in the photos for some reason). I am not too thrilled about the right arm, the hand or the dachshund. I wish I had seen the review of Pete Morton's Rat Catcher in time for this as he nailed it doing almost the same small dog and hand hold. Anyway, I am hoping I can remedy some of the faults I see on the dog and hand with paint. Finally, I think I did his awards and epaulettes too fast - again I hope I can correct any weaknesses with paint. We shall see - that's what happens when you sculpt in your sick bed. At least a I learned a lot from this one.\n\nColin"
