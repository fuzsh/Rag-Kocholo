to establish, from the Reichsarchive, the first central archive of the German army, in Potsdam.

In mid-1942, von Rabenau was relieved of his office, transferred to the rank of General der Artillerie and sent into premature retirement. He studied Protestant theology at the University of Berlin and in 1943 was made Licentiatus theologiae, writing his dissertation on military chaplaincy.
