        "text": "Attorney General-Elect Austin Knudsen on Wednesday named Kalispell resident Major Steve Lavin as the next colonel of the Montana Highway Patrol.\n\nLavin currently serves as a major at the Highway Patrol with 28 years of service. He will succeed outgoing division chief Colonel Tom Butler, who was appointed by Attorney General Tim Fox in 2013.\n\n“Steve has the vision, experience and leadership ability we need to tackle the difficult challenges we face,” Knudsen said of his appointment in a media release. “His integrity and steadfast devotion to duty will serve Montana well.”\n\nLavin said he was honored for the opportunity.\n\n“I appreciate Attorney General-Elect Knudsen placing his confidence in me and look forward to the task ahead,” he stated.\n\nLavin was born and raised in Helena, and graduated from Montana State University in 1989.\n\nHe was elected to the Montana Legislature in 2011 and served four terms in the House as a Republican representing Kalispell’s HD-8. Over those four terms he sponsored successful legislation creating a 24/7 sobriety project for impaired driving offenders, and worked on other criminal justice related bills, including the creation of a \"blue alert\" system regarding violent offenders.\n\nHe currently resides in Kalispell with his wife of 29 years, Amy, and has two children, Michael and Cassidy."
