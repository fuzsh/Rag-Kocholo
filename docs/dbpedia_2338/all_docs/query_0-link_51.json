        "text": "One of TV's finest comedic actresses, Cynthia Stevenson was born in Oakland, California, to Al Stevenson, an upholstery warehouse owner and Gayle Stevenson née Boniface, an editor. She moved north with her mother and brother, Gregory, to Bellevue, Washington and then to Vancouver, British Columbia, where she spent most of her childhood.\n\nCynthia took her first step toward an acting career in the University of Victoria's Phoenix Theatre Program. Cynthia returned to California to complete her training, attending the renowned American Conservatory Theatre (ACT) in San Francisco, and the Drama Studio London at Berkeley.\n\nAfter arriving in Los Angeles, Cynthia found roles with an improv group and in two local theatre productions, one of which was a long-running hit, \"The Ladies Room,\" written and directed by Robin Schiff and produced by Heartaches (1915), which brought Cynthia critical acclaim for her comedic skills. Because of this work, she landed an immediate job on a TV sketch comedy, Off the Wall (1986), where she was featured in 26 episodes.\n\nCynthia quickly built her resume with guest parts on popular sitcoms, including \"Max Headroom,\" \"Empty Nest,\" \"The Famous Teddy Z.,\" \"Newhart,\" Major Dad\" and many others. In between came her first starring role as talk show host Jennifer Bass in My Talk Show (1990), an original, offbeat nightly series, described as the \"first cult hit\" of the 1990s. It proved to be Cynthia's big break, as director Above the Limit (1900) noticed and cast her as Bonnie Sherow opposite star Photographing a Ghost (1898) in the Oscar nominated film The Player (1992).\n\nLegendary TV producers Cheri Steinkellner and Bill Steinkellner chose Cynthia for a recurring guest spot on their iconic hit series Cheers (2011). The producers then tapped her for a co-starring role in their next sitcom Bob (1992) playing the daughter of cartoonist Bob Newhart. That performance, in turn, inspired the same production team to create a new show Silver Girls (1995) especially for Cynthia. Co-starring as Hope opposite Jessica Lundy (as Gloria), the talented cast included Tiffani Thiessen and Enrico Colantoni. Whenever talking about her career path, Cynthia has always been quick to point out that it was Cherie and Bill Steinkellner who gave it movement and direction.\n\nWith a versatility that has moved easily between TV and film, Cynthia had top roles in several 1990's character-driven ensemble features, such as Watch It (1993), produced by David Brown and written and directed by [link-nm0002368]; Vergiß Paris (1995), written, produced, directed and starring Billy Crystal; Familienfeste und andere Schwierigkeiten (1995) produced and directed by Jodie Foster; Live Nude Girls (1995) written and directed by Julianna Lavin and Happiness (1998), written and directed by Love or Riches (1911). In addition she has been a recurring guest on network and cable shows, including \"Ally McBeal,\" \"Monk,\" \"Six Feet Under,\" \"According to Jim\" and \"The L. Word.\"\n\nWhen Lifetime decided to enter into the half hour comedy business, they tapped Cynthia for the lead role in Susan Beavers' Oh Baby (1998), an innovative, first-person take on single motherhood created by Der Mann mit der Torpedohaut (1970). It ran for two years. She then relocated to Vancouver (known as \"Hollywood North\") where she starred as the troubled Joy Lass in the long-running Showtime favorite Dead Like Me - So gut wie tot (2003). While working in Vancouver, Cynthia was featured in several family films, including Agent Cody Banks (2003) and Agent Cody Banks 2: Mission London (2004), plus her repeating role as Jackie Framm in Air Bud: Golden Receiver (1998) and its five subsequent comedies for Disney, and the TV movie Das kleine Mord-Problem (2006) opposite Judy Davis and directed by In Little Italy (1909).\n\nBefore leaving Canada and returning to Southern California in 2008, Cynthia had a regular role as a feisty female sheriff on ABC's Men in Trees (2006) and also starred in Lifetime TV's Christmas comedy Will You Merry Me? (2008), as well as the films Neverwas (2005), Fall 39 (2009), I Love You, Beth Cooper (2009), Jennifer's Body - Jungs nach ihrem Geschmack (2009), and the long-awaited So gut wie tot - Dead Like Me: Der Film (2009).\n\nCynthia's busy roster continues to expand back home with roles in such films as Reunion (2009), Tiger Eyes (2012) and Baja (2018). TV guest appearances have included such popular programs as \"Life Unexpected,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"Off the Map,\" \"Chaos,\" \"Private Practice,\" \"Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Supergirl,\" with recurring roles on Your Family or Mine (2015) and How to Get Away with Murder (2014).\n\nCynthia lives in the Los Angeles area with her husband and son.\n\nDiedrich Bader was born in Alexandria, Virginia, but moved to Paris, France, with his family at age two. While in the \"City of Light\" he developed an appreciation for movie legends like Fred Astaire and Charles Chaplin. So, when a fragile \"Chaplin\" movie reel burned in the theater's projector, four-year-old Bader hopped on stage and entertained the crowd with an imitation of the \"Little Tramp.\" The standing ovation he received set the course for the rest of his life--he knew he wanted to perform.\n\nHe returned to the United States for high school and attended North Carolina School of the Arts. During spring break he was discovered by a casting director in Santa Fe, New Mexico. That meeting led to an audition for a small role in a TV pilot. Bader landed a starring role instead. Although the pilot wasn't picked up, Bader moved to Los Angeles and began auditioning for other roles. He landed guest spots on several series, including Raumschiff Enterprise: Das nächste Jahrhundert (1987), Der Prinz von Bel-Air (1990), Cheers (1982) and Zurück in die Vergangenheit (1989). Filmmaker Penelope Spheeris liked his tongue-in-cheek delivery when he read for her action-adventure spoof series, Danger Theatre (1993). She hired him in that role and for the feature film Die Beverly Hillbillies sind los (1993), which she directed. Bader played the dual roles of twins Jethro and Jethrine Beaudine. He also filmed the political thriller Assassination File - Operation Laskey (1996) for the Encore Entertainment Group. Bader was excited to work on the project, as it allowed him to be shot in the head -- a first for the actor. Bader's father, William, was Chief of Staff for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and is president of the Eurasia Foundation on Capitol Hill. His mother, Gretta, is a sculptor whose portrait of the late Sen. J. William Fulbright sits in the National Gallery in Washington, DC. Bader's wife is actress Dulcy Rogers; they reside in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nAmerican stage, screen and television actress, and comedian Carol Kane (b.

The actress received a surprise Academy Award nomination for her performance in the 1974 independent film, Hester Street (1975); Times of Israel describes Kane's character, Gitl, as \"a straight-from-the-shtetl immigrant who, with her young son, joins her husband (Steven Keats) who is already halfway assimilated in New York's Lower East Side; the push and the pull between tradition and change drive the story to its bittersweet conclusion.\"\n\nThe following decade, from 1980-1983, she appeared on the television series Taxi (1978). Kane portrayed Simka Dahblitz-Gravas, wife of Latka Gravas (Andy Kaufman). She received two Emmy Awards, and a Golden Globe nomination for her work in the series. Over the years, Kane racked up tons of credits from Taxi and Die Braut des Prinzen (1987), to Die Geister die ich rief...
