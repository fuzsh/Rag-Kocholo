        "text": "Just about every coach can break down film, but Steve Lavin takes it to a different level. Lavin, the new boss at St. John’s, is married to an actress, Mary Ann Jarou, whose television roles include an appearance on “The King of Queens.”\n\nAfter her husband was introduced at a news conference Wednesday in Taffner Field House in Jamaica, Queens, Jarou dished some Hollywood gossip.\n\n“A lot of people don’t know this but Steve is quite the amazing film critic, he can break down a movie better than Siskel and Ebert,” Jarou said. “He’ll say, ‘The editing — they could’ve done a better job,’ or ‘That scene was pretty powerful.’ ”\n\nJarou said Lavin’s cinematic sensibility grew from his youth in San Francisco, when his parents took him to see everything from the Three Stooges to Charlie Chaplin. He is, indeed, a West Coast guy.\n\nLavin last coached at U.C.L.A. in 2003, finishing a seven-year stint with a university-worst record of 10-19 (145-78 over all) before his career dissolved into a job with the cameras and microphones of ESPN.\n\nWhen asked which film actor Lavin most resembled, Jarou replied: “Gene Kelly,” a star perhaps best known for “Singin’ in the Rain.”\n\nBut it will take more than a song-and-dance routine to make St. John’s relevant again nationally or in the Big East or even in New York, where the basketball recession is extreme at Madison Square Garden.\n\nSt. John’s has not been to a Final Four since 1985 under Lou Carnesecca, who sat beaming on stage alongside Lavin, Athletic Director Chris Monasch and the college’s president, the Rev. Donald J. Harrington.\n\nLavin said he would talk basketball with Carnesecca over coffee. Another elder who might get a bigger role is Gene Keady, a retired longtime Purdue coach.\n\nKeady was Lavin’s mentor, hiring Lavin as an assistant in 1988 at Purdue. Lavin said he planned to attend the Final Four and talk to Keady there about a staff position.\n\nIf Keady accepts Lavin’s offer, it would not technically be a full-time assistant position, Lavin said, but might involve sitting on the bench in games.\n\nThat could help Lavin with game strategy, not always thought to be his strength at U.C.L.A.\n\nAnother aspect of the job, recruiting, could be bolstered by the hiring of assistants familiar with high school and amateur leagues in New York and the Northeast.\n\nAlthough Lavin would not confirm any names, one often mentioned for such a role is Barry Rohrssen, the Manhattan coach whose recruiting helped elevate Pittsburgh when he was an assistant there.\n\nBut Lavin said he also knew how to charm high school players. U.C.L.A. was a brand name and he attracted some top talent by recruiting nationally and internationally.\n\nTo describe how he will negotiate New York gyms, Lavin used a television analogy. “It’s not as though I’m going to be Mr. Magoo, wandering around,” he said.\n\nLavin looked and acted bi-coastally suave. His appearance and words were the sort that come from a man accustomed to being watched and heard, his hair combed and jelled in Pat Riley fashion.\n\nHe described himself as “the youngest of six children, clearly an Irish-Catholic family.” As for not being a New Yorker, he noted that not every pope is Italian, a line that drew smiles in the audience at this Catholic university.\n\nAt the very least, he proved he could mix metaphors with the best of them. “As you can see, I’ve got a full plate,” Lavin said. “I look at it as the glass is half-full.”\n\nLavin, who replaces Norm Roberts, was hired after a search that was at times awkward and included the public wooing of Billy Donovan of Florida and Paul Hewitt of Georgia Tech.\n\nLavin inherited a team that went 17-16 and could return five starters. Roberts, said Lavin, “really stabilized things here; there’s momentum here.”\n\nAfter the session ended, Lavin and Jarou were ready for their close-up, brought together for the benefit of photographers, a bouquet of red roses placed in her arms, no thorns apparent.\n\nShe said she hoped to work in television or theater. He spoke of a different Midtown stage. “New York City, Madison Square Garden, the Big East, the tradition,” Lavin said. “How do you beat that?”"
