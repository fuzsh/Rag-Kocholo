        "text": "Lavin History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nFrance\n\nIreland\n\nThe history of the Lavin family goes back to the Medieval landscape of northwestern France, to the regions known as Brittany and Normandy. The name Lavigne is derived from the Old French word \"vigne,\" meaning \"vine,\" and as such it is likely that the first bearers of this name owned or worked on a vineyard. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Lavin family\n\nThe surname Lavin was first found in Brittany where they held a family seat in the seigneury of Haute Morays.\n\nThey later branched to Houle in that same province. They were closely allied to this latter House of Houlle de Kermassonet. Branching to the region of Tournai they intermarried with the family of Hennebert. Branches were later found in Maine, Le Mans, Bourbonnais, Guyenne, and Artois. In the south of France they held a family seat in the region of Languedoc at Puylaroque.\n\nJoseph Lavigne, son of Pierre and Jeanne (née Gazaille), settled in Contrecoeur, Quebec and married Marie-Anne Gareau on 12th November 1727. 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Lavin family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Lavin research. More information is included under the topic Early Lavin History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nLavin Spelling Variations\n\nThere were a great number of spelling variations in French surnames. One reason for this was the wide variety of cultural influences present in France during the early development of the French language. The many spelling variations of the name include Lavigne, Levine, Levin, Levigne, Levigny, Laveine, Lavignes, Lavene, Des Vignes, deVigne, Devignes, Devigne, De lavigne and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Lavin family\n\nMore information is included under the topic Early Lavin Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLavin Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Lavin is the 6,396th most popular surname with an estimated 4,974 people with that name. 3\n\nLoading...\n\nLavin migration to the United States +\n\nIn 1643, 109 years after the first landings by Cartier, there were only about 300 people in Quebec, in 1663 there were only 500, 2,000 migrants arrived during the next decade. Early marriage was desperately encouraged amongst the immigrants. Youths of 18 took fourteen-year-old girls for their wives. The fur trade was developed and attracted migrants, both noble and commoner from France. 15,000 explorers left Montreal in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Migration from France to New France or Quebec as it was now more popularly called, continued from France until it fell in 1759. By 1675, there were 7000 French in Quebec. By the same year the Acadian presence in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had reached 500. In 1755, 10,000 French Acadians refused to take an oath of allegiance to England and were deported to Louisiana. Meanwhile, in Quebec, the French race flourished, founding in Lower Canada, one of the two great solitudes which became Canada.
