        "text": "Arizona State alumni Derrick Wrobel joined the Sun Devil staff in summer of 2015 after five seasons at St. John's working for Steve Lavin as assistant to the head coach. St. John's earned an NCAA berth in 2015, posted 21 victories and NCAA berth in 2011, an NIT appearance in 2013 and 20 wins and NIT berth in 2014.\n\nUnder Lavin the Red Storm went 81-53 with three 20-win seasons and two NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\nWrobel in his career at ASU, Cal and St. John's has worked with a dozen players who have played or been drafted to the NBA and been on the staff of six NCAA Tournament teams including the 2010 Pac-10 Champion California Golden Bears.\n\nHe spent four seasons on the Cal staff as he was with the Bears for back-to-back 20-win seasons and NCAA Tournament appearances in 2009 and 2010, including the 2010 Pac-10 Championship season.\n\nIn Wrobel's administrative position, he was responsible for providing support for a variety of daily operations within the men's basketball program including game scheduling, team travel, as well as organizing practice and shoot around times.\n\nHe also supervised student development activities throughout the academic year and assisted with on-campus visits of prospective student-athletes. Wrobel also performed duties related to the administration of the Steve Lavin St. John's Summer Basketball Camp, alumni relations, and day-to-day operations.\n\nWrobel served as the Cal men's basketball program's Director of External Relations for his last two seasons in Berkeley, after performing duties as the Bears' Basketball Operations Coordinator from 2006-07 to 2007-08. In those roles, he fulfilled a number of functions related to scheduling, day-to-day operations, recruiting communications and camp/clinic administration. Working first under then-Cal head coach Ben Braun and then under Mike Montgomery, Wrobel accompanied the Bears on their first conference title run in 50 years in 2010.\n\nWrobel hails from Phoenix, Ariz., and is a 2001 graduate of Arizona State's Walter Cronkite School of Broadcasting with a B.A. in broadcast journalism. He was a four-year team manager as an undergraduate, and began his professional career in intercollegiate athletics upon graduation, serving as the Sun Devils' Director of Men's Basketball Operations from 2001-02 to 2005-06.\n\nServing on then-head coach Rob Evans' staff, Wrobel's duties encompassed aspects of team travel, practice preparation, academic support, marketing and film exchange, in addition to coordinating summer camps and golf tournament fundraising events.\n\nHe and the former Michelle Chartier were married on Aug. 20, 2005, and gave birth to a son, Zachary Lucas, on Sept. 19, 2014."
