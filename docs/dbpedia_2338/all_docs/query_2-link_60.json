        "text": "Missoula, MT (KGVO-AM News) - On March 18, 2024, Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen announced the retirement of Montana Highway Patrol Colonel Steve Lavin.\n\n“I’m grateful to Steve for his decades-long career with the Montana Highway Patrol,” Knudsen said. “It was a pleasure working with him during his tenure as colonel to keep Montanans safe in their communities and on the road. I wish him well in his retirement.”\n\nLavin was appointed by Attorney General Knudsen in January 2021 and retired after over 30 years of service with the Montana Highway Patrol.\n\nOn April 2, 2024, Knudsen announced the appointment of Kurt Sager as colonel, and head, of the Montana Highway Patrol. Before his appointment, Sager was lieutenant colonel with 21 years of service to the agency and people of Montana.\n\n“Over the last two decades with the Patrol, Kurt has proven to be a great leader,” Knudsen said. “I am confident he has the experience and leadership skills necessary to face the public safety challenges we’re experiencing in Montana. I look forward to working with him to continue to serve and protect Montanans.”\n\nREAD MORE: Retiring Montana Highway Patrol Spokesman Takes New Post\n\nColonel Sager served as the interim head of the Patrol, following former Colonel Steve Lavin’s retirement earlier this month. According to Knudsen, Sager began his career with MHP in 2003 as a trooper in Northeastern Montana. He served as a sergeant in Helena, captain in Great Falls, and a major at Patrol headquarters, prior to becoming lieutenant colonel in 2023. He also oversaw the successful relocation of MHP headquarters from Helena to Boulder in 2021.\n\n“I am grateful to Attorney General Knudsen for the trust he’s placed in me to lead the Highway Patrol,” Sager said. “Our troopers are some of the best and bravest in the nation and it’s an honor to serve alongside them in our mission to keep Montanans safe.”"
