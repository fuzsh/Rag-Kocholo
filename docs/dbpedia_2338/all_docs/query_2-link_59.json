        "text": "@ralster\n\nAlford comes off much more human in the book and less inscrutable and aloof than he projects.\n\nHe faces the same kind of cultural barrier at UCLA that Wooden and Lavin did. Midwesterners are northerners and underneath the surfer jams and kicked back SOCAL surface, SOCAL is the Deep South come west, as surely as San Francisco is the old Northeast come west.\n\nIt’s tough for most northerners to relate to true southern Californians in the same way they struggle with most true southerners. Lavin learned how to be appealing to SOCAL media, but even with Wooden and Pete Newell strongly behind him, he could never really win over the UCLA alumni. It’s more than just W&L and rings. They are a different breed, kind of like UNC’s alumni. So: you have to separate Alford from the culture to assess how he is doing.\n\nAlso, Alford is subject to the same apparent petroshoeco recruiting constraint that Self appears to be at KU, only Alford has 10-20 million local SOCAL folks to offset it some what with. Still: you gotta separate Alford from the apparent embargo effect, too.\n\nAs a Coach he totally masters Bob Knight ball, and seems to pick up Coach K’s innovations, but he is also greatly influenced by his father’s game, as the book makes clear and I suspect the departures from classic Knight/K ball are him trying to adapt his dad’s ideas to D1. His dad was a high school coach and Alford says in the book back at Iowa that he relied heavily on his dad’s philosophy too. I suspect Alford is a bit like Huggins in trying to use a father’s high school coaching ideas in D1. But whereas it’s straightforward with Huggins–Hugs often runs his dad’s old offense, it’s not clear to me exactly what Alford is borrowing from his pop. I suspect folks in Indiana would know. The book does not make it clear.\n\nI think Alford probably knows as much about the game, as a coach, as Self does, and played at a much higher level than Self ever did.\n\nBut I have never watched him closely, so my impression is only 2 cents worth. It’s this: Alford’s deficiency is that so far anyway, while a fine game tactician and teacher, he is not charismatic and he has not innovated strategically in any way that gave him and his teams a decisive edge, as Self has done. Alford learns from others just as well as Self does, indicating flexibility, but he has not yet transformed any aspect of the game with his own vision, as Self has done in several aspects of the game.\n\nBest I can do so far.\n\n@ralster\n\nHowland was never the UCLA kinda guy IMHO. He wasn’t smooth and smart enough. Lavin had the look, but he confused Hollywood slick with UCLA smooth.\n\nIt’s not enough to win big.\n\nIt’s not enough to be SOCAL smooth.\n\nIt’s not enough to be smart.\n\nYou have to be all three.\n\nWooden was very straight, but they can accept that if you are smooth, smart and win big.\n\nI think Alford is getting smooth, even though he is a straight arrow, as Wooden was.\n\nHe’s very smart; that is huge at UCLA. Persons forget that UCLA is second only to UC-Berkeley in academic stature among state universities across the country, and ranked much higher than several Ivies. It’s really a great school academically. And SOCAL is very driven to be great academically. The association of small colleges including Pomona, Occidental, Claremont etc. are modeled off Oxford and have out stripped both the Big and Little IVYs in some kinds of rankings. They are to American spookdom what Oxford is to British Spookdom. And Cal Tech is just another realm above everything in physics and insane technologies. SOCAL is brainiac central behind the smog and road rage. So the UCLA coach needs sports pedigree and he must be smart. Smooth, not slick, astronomical standards but no swag, fierce but graceful. Hugely confident but no bragging. And win rings!\n\nThey like a guy who is smart enough to outsmart the smartest. He’s close but not yet showing any genius.\n\nAnd he isn’t winning big. They will endure that if the coach can bring the rest.\n\nBut can he?\n\nHe’s probably go two more seasons at most to prove it.\n\n@jaybate-1.0 I love your followup post, because perhaps unwittingly, in your explanation of soCal culture, it made me think of 2 things, regarding “hollywood slick” and smooth, etc…–>\n\nFirst, is that if Alford moves on, UCLA can get Jay Wright. A perfect fit. I find it interesting that Gregg Marshall turned down UCLA’s offer. Maybe he didnt think he would fit in with the culture. I know he cannot recruit to the ability UCLA would need, and maybe Marshall knows that too. Or maybe the shoeCo’s would show some kids his way, who knows…But Jay Wright could be a “shoe-in” for the SoCal crowd.\n\nSecond, your explanation goes a long way into explaining why a zany, tangential, metaphorical character like Bill Walton can be allowed to do color commentary for PacWest games. I can see that segment of SoCal society you describe, probably love Walton’s intellect. And make no mistake, he is “allowed” to have that on-air personality, just as Dick Vitale directly told my brother in law that he is told to have that on-air persona he is now infamous for. ESPN knows exactly what its target audiences want…\n\n@ralster\n\nGood additions. Walton is a great example, as were Kareem, and Wilt In Southern California, you don’t have to conceal being smart, because so many persons are. You also can’t be pretentitious about it, because high IQ is not a scarce commodity. The important thing is that you are smooth beyond it. Intellect necessarily has sharp elbows in its field of application, so to live there successfully Even the bright folks have to chill. I think this is why persons would be surprised to find that Bill out of the limelight is probably very chill. Everyone there knows lots of exceptional people and they get used to it. For every nut you find there you will find ten, or a hundred incredibly bright people that are actually doing impressive things with their abilities; this some outsiders overlook, when forming stereotypes of Southern Californians. It attracts both types–The truly bright and those trying to fake that they are.\n\nThe amazing thing about those three all time great big men is how overtly and unapologetically intellectual they were. SOCAL was a great fit for them. They wore their brains on their shirt sleeves, so to speak. Southern Californians are on the western perimeter of conus. They like smart people that leave the program, achieve massively, and come back to tell about It. People forget that those celebrities at the game are not just celebrities, but exceptionally talented at one thing or another. It’s like NYC in its share of bright persons, but not so urban, pressured and in your face.\n\nWalton is about as pure SOCAL as you can get. Californians totally get him.\n\nJay Wright might adapt, but he may be more stylish than smooth. I can’t say. He would have to want to adapt some, as Jerry West did, but he seems smart, like Zeke from cabin Creek. West is an example of someone who could adapt, but obviously always wanted to get back to his home culture. There are few that can both.\n\n@KUSTEVE\n\nI am not sure that many KU fans remember this, but the chancellor that put UCLA on the map and made it become what it is today was previously KU Chancellor Franklin Murphy, born KC, KU ‘36, and Ku’'s chancellor who turned KU largely into what it is today. Murphy was a brilliant ( Phi Beta Kappa) medical doctorate physician educated at University of Pennsylvania, that Was a World War II army veteran, who came home and joined KU Med medical faculty and within a few years became its director, built it up, then became KU’s Chancellor. After a fallout with Gov. George Docking, Murphy accepted an offer from the great UC system President Clark Kerr to come and take UCLA to the next level. No telling how much greater KU would have been had Murphy stayed. Murphy is credited with turning UCLA into the world class graduate research university we know to day and launching UCLA MEDICAL SCHOOL to the elite level. He birthe the Jules Stein institute and it was Murphy who shepherded UCLA through the 1960s without the student and police violence that wracked Berkeley under Kerr and KU under Wescoe. Murphy was a great chancellor by any measure. I swear, when I once walked UCLA’s campus I could feel some kinship between KU and UCLA in the culture and design of both schools he so strongly influenced. It’s a feeling and attitude, not a look.\n\nUCLA started humbly from a juco. It lacks the legacy snobbishness of UC and Stanford. It was born in the era of the Depression and war when many Southern Californians were displaced midwesterners. No doubt they found connections to Steve on many levels, for he is not on the surface a UCLA guy. But they value the Wooden legacy like we value Phog and they want to do right by it and the game. But doing right there is more complicated because LA IS different than Lawrence. There are more constraints to meet.\n\nPeople forget that they have often outsourced for basketball coaches, between trying to hire there own… They hired LB before KU did. LB was an appeal to the old KU tradition through DEAN AND UNC. They hired Lavin, who only looked slick, but was actually a Gene Keady guy from Wooden’s Purdue and Keady was a Sutton guy and a Kay grad. Howland was hired because he had assisted for a time at UCLA, but otherwise he didn’t really have the pedigris.\n\nIf Alford can get players under the apparent embargo, he could make it. They like a smart square every now and then. And Wooden told them endlessly his game descended from Big Ten ball and from Iba. Wooden did not like Knights mouth and physical aggression with players and refs. But he thought Knight was a great coach and Alford and “Indiana” kind of person. That explains Alford and Lavin and so on."
