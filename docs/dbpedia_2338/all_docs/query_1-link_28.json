        "text": "St. John’s is expected to storm the NCAA tourney this week with one of its strongest squads in recent memory — but their good-luck charm sits behind the bench.\n\nMary Ann Jarou, the stunning wife of freshman coach Steve Lavin, is the Red Storm’s rock.\n\nKnown as “Miss Mary,” the plucky, petite Midwesterner has caught nearly every game in her husband’s remarkable first season with the Johnnies, including those in Alaska.\n\n“It was live, breathe, eat basketball,” said Jarou, 33. “The team is like a family.”\n\nShe is especially bonded to Gene Keady, the legendary Purdue basketball coach who now assists Lavin.\n\n“She’s good luck and she’s good looking,” Keady said.\n\nThough devoted to her handsome, 46-year-old husband, Jarou is no desperate housewife.\n\nThe actress and model has landed spots on “The King of Queens,” “General Hospital” and “Entourage.”\n\nShe’s currently auditioning for off-Broadway gigs, forming an entertainment company and jet-setting to fashion shows in Paris.\n\nJarou’s big-city success sprang from humble roots.\n\nBorn in Flint and raised in a small Michigan town, Jarou is the oldest of four children in a tight family.\n\nBut the exotic beauty (she is of French, Lebanese, Mexican and Filipino descent) had bigger fish to fry, and moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting.\n\nWhile at a Lakers game in 2003, a friend introduced her to a striking, lantern-jawed ESPN commentator and former UCLA basketball coach.\n\nJarou ended up swallowing her pride and asking him out.\n\n“He kids that I was the aggressive one. But he was checking me out,” she jokes.\n\nThe couple wed in a private ceremony in Capri, Italy, in 2007.\n\nSince arriving in New York last year, Jarou has barely had time to unpack the boxes in their SoHo loft.\n\nWhen she’s not acting or traveling with the Top-20 team — which is expected to be chosen tonight for a coveted berth in the 68-team NCAA national tournament — Jarou loves to stroll downtown.\n\nThough a diehard Red Storm fan, Jarou doesn’t wear the team’s gear.\n\nThe 5-foot-2 fashionista drowns in even the smallest team merchandise, and she’s got a semi-serious plan for next season.\n\n“I think I’m going to make my own clothing line for St. John’s. I’m going to create cute stuff,” she said."
