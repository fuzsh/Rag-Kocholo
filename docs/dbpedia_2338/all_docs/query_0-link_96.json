Shortly after college in 2001, his former life as an athlete interconnected with a natural business sense and SponsorHouse was born. The original mission was simple…support and connect amateur athletes with sponsors through the ‘Internet’, which was the first concept of its kind. That vision later evolved into Hookit, a supercharged version of the original vision powered by a groundbreaking brand marketing and commerce platform that will disrupt a $300B+ sports economy. Today, Hookit aggregates nearly 1B pieces of athlete data and content each month to help them quantify their value, earn recognition and get deals. For the first time ever, brands now have a clear and effective solution to quantify and maximize their athlete and sports marketing programs.\n\nSocially responsible and community driven, Scott is active with several business and sports organizations, including Founder Institute, UCSD Connect, San Diego Venture Group, SDSI (San Diego Sport Innovators) and SIMA (Surf Industry Manufacturers Association). Regarded as an expert on the topics of sponsorship, sports marketing, social media and digital technologies, Scott is passionate about sharing his experiences and has been invited to speak at several industry events, including: SDSI – Leveraging Social for Brand Engagement (San Diego, CA), CommNexus – Location-Based Services meets Social Media (San Diego, CA – 2010), YPulse Youth Marketing Summit (San Francisco, CA – 2009/2010), Sandios Round Table – Startup Bootstrapping & Fundraising (San Diego, CA – 2009), Where’s Waldo LA – Finding Social Influencers (Los Angeles, CA – 2009), National Sports Forum (Los Angeles, CA – 2008) and most recently DIBRACA Digital Brand Camp at Weber State University (Ogden, Utah).\n\nScott holds a degree in Sports Medicine from Elon University and a Master’s degree in Internet Business Systems from Mercy College.
