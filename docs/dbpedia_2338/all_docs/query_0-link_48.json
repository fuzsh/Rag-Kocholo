        "text": "Results:\n\nA total of 63 subjects were enrolled that had both fetal and neonatal brain MRIs (d-TGA= 37, HLHS= 26). Baseline demographics are presented in by WMI severity. Gestational age at birth was on average 1 week earlier for those with moderate-severe WMI on the postnatal pre-operative MRI, though not statistically significant (GA birth: d-TGA: 38.8 weeks, 95% CI: 38.2–39.4 vs. 39.1 weeks, 95% CI: 38.7–39.5 wks, p= 0.5; HLHS: 38.1 weeks, 95% CI: 37.6–38.5 vs. 39.1 weeks, 95% CI: 38.5–39.9 wks, p= 0.07). No other clinical or demographic factors were different by WMI severity for either cardiac group. Anatomic details are included in . Among the d-TGA group, the percentage of patients with a VSD was similar in those with none/mild WMI compared to those with moderate-severe WMI. In addition, 4 subjects had an associated coarctation of the aorta, one of which had moderate-severe WMI. Among the HLHS group, a significantly higher percentage of patients had aortic atresia in the moderate/severe WMI group. The prevalence and severity of pre-operative neonatal brain injury is presented in . In the d-TGA group, 12 (32.4%) subjects had WMI, of whom 4 (10.8%) had moderate to severe WMI. In the HLHS group, 8 (34.6%) had WMI, of whom 5 (19.2%) had moderate to severe WMI.

The trajectory of TBV from the fetal to neonatal time period by WMI severity is depicted in and . In d-TGA subjects, overall TBV was significantly lower in the group with acquired neonatal moderate to severe WMI after adjusting for postmenstrual age at scan and site (overall TBV was 14.8 mL (95% CI: −28.8, −0.73) lower each week from fetal to neonatal life in those with moderate to severe WMI compared to those with none/mild WMI, p= 0.04) ( ). However, the rate of change in TBV (i.e. rate of growth) did not differ by injury group. TBV increased at a rate of 15.5 mL/week (95% CI: 11.8–19.1) in the subjects with none/mild WMI while it increased at a rate of 13.8 mL/week (95% CI: 7.9–19.5) in those with moderate-severe WMI (p= 0.74). To account for differences in anatomy, a sensitivity analysis was performed removing the 4 d-TGA subjects with associated coarctation of the aorta. We observed a similar trend of a lower TBV among those with acquired neonatal moderate/severe WMI after adjusting for age at scan and site (overall TBV was 14.7 mL (95% CI: −31.7, 2.2) lower each week from fetal to neonatal life in those with moderate-severe WMI compared to those with none/mild WMI, p= 0.08) In HLHS subjects, no significant difference was noted in overall TBV between those with none/mild WMI and those with moderate-severe WMI (coefficient 14.8, 95% CI: −14.4, 44.1, p= 0.32) and there was no difference noted in rate of change in TBV between the groups (15.1 mL/week, 95% CI: 11.9–18.4 in none/mild WMI vs. 19.1 mL/week, 95% CI: 9.7–28.5 in mod-sev WMI, p= 0.27).\n\nTable 3.\n\nd-TGAHLHS (n= 26)None/Mild WMI\n\nN= 33Mod-Sev WMI\n\nN= 4None/Mild WMI\n\nN= 21Mod-Sev WMI\n\nN= 5 Fetal TBV, mL Mean, 95% CI 267.6\n\n(254.1–281.1)244.1\n\n(176.2–311.9)250.0\n\n(231.3–268.7)225.1\n\n(162.2–288.0) Neonatal TBV, mL Mean, 95% CI 336.6\n\n(323.7–349.6)312.0\n\n(292.6–331.4)330.1\n\n(311.9–358.3)325.8\n\n(276.4–375.1)\n\nTable 4.\n\nd-TGAHLHSWMI SeverityCoefficient (95% CI)*p-valueCoefficient (95% CI)*p-value None-Mild Ref Ref Mod-Severe −14.8 (−28.8, −0.73)0.0414.8 (−14.4, 44.1)0.32\n\nFinally, we noted no difference in the rate of growth from fetal to neonatal life by cardiac diagnosis. TBV increased by 15.3 mL/week in d-TGA and 15.9 mL/week in HLHS. The difference in slopes per 1 week increase in postmenstrual age was minimal at 1.6 mL, 95% CI: −0.61, 3.8, p= 0.16 ( ).\n\nDiscussion:\n\nIn this prospective longitudinal study across three sites, we demonstrate that lower TBV as a measure of brain maturity beginning in the 3rd trimester of fetal life is associated with increased risk of acquired moderate to severe WMI in the neonatal pre-operative period in patients with d-TGA, but not in HLHS. Interestingly, rate of perinatal brain growth, though similar between d-TGA and HLHS was not a risk factor for injury in either group. Our results identify important differences between HLHS and d-TGA with regard to acquired postnatal brain injury that brings to light several physiologic considerations that are unique to the fetus with complex CHD.\n\nThe overall model that informed our study design is the concept that fetuses with CHD and restricted oxygen/nutrient delivery have delayed brain development4,10 that heightens their postnatal susceptibility to WMI via instability during the perinatal transitional period. The mechanism of acquired WMI in term neonates with complex CHD is thought to be secondary to hypoxic-ischemic injury to susceptible immature premyelinating oligodendrocytes similar to the mechanism seen in premature infants6. Similar to prior studies we did not identify WMI on fetal MRI, thus we designed our study to determine if brain immaturity beginning in the fetal time period is associated with postnatal acquired brain injury. Given the myriad of risk factors associated with WMI in the CHD population after birth7–9, isolating the relationship between brain maturity and WMI has been challenging with varying results in the literature. Semi-quantitative techniques have suggested that brain immaturity is a risk factor for WMI12,13, while other studies utilizing quantitative diffusion weighted imaging have not found similar results8. As a crude measure of brain immaturity, relative prematurity (i.e. early term birth) has been associated with increased risk of pre-operative WMI in patients with CHD14,15, which was a trend observed in our study. In the present study, we found that in subjects with d-TGA, fetal total brain volume is lower and continues to remain low after birth among those that go on to acquire postnatal moderate to severe WMI compared to those who do not.\n\nA piglet CHD model demonstrates that hypoxia impairs the generation and migration of neural progenitors destined to become forebrain interneurons and reduces overall cortical growth16. It is possible, that within the d-TGA group, there are varying degrees of impaired oxygen and nutrient delivery to the brain such that a certain subset of patients have a greater decline in cortical growth, overall brain volumes and maturation. Those with the most brain immaturity may be particularly vulnerable to hemodynamic instability that occurs after placental separation and is often difficult to predict prenatally17 leading to significant WMI. Pre-operative brain injury is more common in d-TGA compared with new post-operative brain injury18, suggesting that fetal, perinatal and neonatal risk factors play an important role in the development of acquired injury.\n\nPerinatal brain ischemia may be a significant contributor to risk of WMI in the setting of brain immaturity. Animal models support a role for cerebral ischemia in acquired WMI in addition to hypoxemia. In particular, systemic hypotension and cerebral hypo-perfusion resulting from umbilical cord occlusion in the fetal lamb model results in periventricular white matter injury as well as injury to the cerebral cortex19,20. In the normal newborn, the transitional circulation results in a 3–5 fold increase in left ventricular output due to the decline in pulmonary vascular resistance and increase in pulmonary blood flow. This is mirrored by dramatic reductions in output from the right ventricle with removal of the umbilical circulation21,22. In contrast to the normal fetus, in d-TGA, cerebral circulation is largely driven by output from the right ventricle and is thus more dependent on systemic venous return. These hemodynamic aberrations unique to the fetus with d-TGA may lead to varying degrees of cerebral ischemia during the transitional period from fetal to neonatal life further contributing to acquired perinatal WMI. In addition, lower PaO2 levels prior to corrective cardiac surgery has been associated with WMI in d-TGA9. In the setting of an immature brain, these patients may be even more sensitive to relatively low PaO2 levels supporting timely interventions for those with a restrictive atrial communication and/or earlier corrective surgery18. Given that all of the subjects in this cohort were prenatally diagnosed, this cohort is likely generally healthier with regard to perinatal clinical characteristics and brain health compared to postnatally diagnosed patients23,24. Despite this advantage, a significant percentage of subjects with d-TGA in our cohort had evidence of postnatal WMI prior to surgery, highlighting the potential significance of the transitional circulation as it pertains to perinatal/ delivery room and pre-operative management to protect cerebral blood flow and minimize ischemia. Our findings potentially provide a mechanism to prenatally identify d-TGA subjects that are the most vulnerable to ischemia and thus at highest risk of acquired WMI after birth to allow for clinical care that provides the highest degree of neuroprotection.\n\nInterestingly, perinatal brain growth from the fetal to postnatal time period did not differ by cardiac group, similar to a prior study25. Oxygen and nutrient delivery to the fetal brain are thought to be similar between HLHS and d-TGA as seen by lower oxygen saturation levels in the ascending aorta by fetal cardiac MRI. In addition, both subgroups demonstrate trends towards decreased cerebral oxygen delivery and significantly lower cerebral oxygen consumption compared with controls10. Despite the similarity in perinatal brain growth, the two groups diverged in the association between brain immaturity and acquired postnatal WMI. No significant association was identified between brain immaturity and acquired postnatal WMI in HLHS suggesting that the underlying fetal and perinatal physiology has different implications for postnatal risk of WMI in this group compared to d-TGA. In particular, anatomic factors within the HLHS group may contribute more to susceptibility to WMI during the perinatal transitional period. As described above, changes during transitional circulation such as a decline in pulmonary vascular resistance and increase in pulmonary blood flow leads to a significant increase in LV output with a decline in RV output in the normal neonate. In the setting of HLHS with varying degrees of left heart hypoplasia, cerebral blood flow and risk of ischemia might be more variable in the transitional period depending on the presence or absence of antegrade flow across the aorta. Thus, those at the extreme end of the spectrum with aortic atresia and lack of any antegrade flow to the brain are likely at highest risk of ischemia and acquiring WMI during the transitional period. In fact, all 5 HLHS subjects with moderate to severe WMI had aortic atresia in our cohort. Indeed postnatal studies have demonstrated an association between aortic atresia and smaller ascending aorta size with impairments in white matter microstructure both at birth26 and later in life27. Our findings for both d-TGA and HLHS suggest that future studies should focus on the transitional circulation and its impact on cerebral blood flow and risk of WMI including incorporation of anatomical details to tailor possible interventions.\n\nOur study was strengthened by the prospective design with longitudinal fetal and neonatal MRI scans. In addition, our study reports findings within homogeneous groups of patients with either HLHS or d-TGA allowing for analysis by cardiac physiology. However, our findings are limited by the relatively small sample size making it challenging to determine causality in the relationship between brain maturity and injury. The multi-center nature of this study may lead to unmeasured confounders that can influence the relationship between brain maturity and WMI; however, this was addressed by adjusting for site in our analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, perinatal brain development appears to be related to the risk of clinically significant acquired postnatal WMI, particularly in patients with d-TGA ( ). Given the association between moderate to severe WMI and poor motor outcomes in infancy3, these findings aid in identifying imaging markers before birth to predict neurologic outcomes. In addition, our results can help inform clinical trials on perinatal interventions aimed at optimizing brain development and minimizing clinically significant brain injury in the CHD population."
