        "text": "At sixteen years old, Melanie Lynskey dazzled the film world with an audacious debut in Peter Jackson's revered psychological crime picture, Heavenly Creatures (1994). Her electrifying portrait of Pauline Parker - high school misfit whose fierce rapport with her only friend (a pre-fame Kate Winslet) spirals dangerously out of control - was deemed \"perfect\" (Richard Corliss, TIME) and secured the humble New Zealander a Best Actress trophy in her motherland. Following a three-year interval spent studying at university and relocating to Los Angeles, Lynskey made a welcome return to the silver screen when she was cast as Drew Barrymore's sweet-natured stepsister in Andy Tennant's 'girl power' twist on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, Auf immer und ewig (1998). Parts in Weil ich ein Mädchen bin (1999), Coyote Ugly (2000), Snakeskin (2001), Sweet Home Alabama - Liebe auf Umwegen (2002), Shattered Glass (2003), and Clint Eastwood's Oscar-nominated war epic Flags of Our Fathers (2006) came next.\n\nIn the consequent years, Lynskey emerged as one of the industry's most celebrated character actors, picking up plaudits for a host of appearances in prestige vehicles such as Sam Mendes's Away We Go - Auf nach Irgendwo (2009), Jason Reitman's Up in the Air (2009), Steven Soderbergh's Der Informant! (2009), Tom McCarthy's Win Win (2011), Stephen Chbosky's Vielleicht lieber morgen (2012), and Adam McKay's Don't Look Up (2021). Prolific supporting roles - opposite the calibre of George Clooney, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio - aside, spotlight turns in Hello I Must Be Going (2012), Happy Christmas (2014), The Intervention (2016) - for which she scored a Special Jury Prize at Sundance - and the genre-bending Fremd in der Welt (2017) have equally proved her mettle as a dynamite leading lady.\n\nSince entering the annals of 21st century popular culture with her riotous embodiment of Rose - on the toweringly successful Two and a Half Men (2003), where she appeared for over a decade as Charlie Sheen's duplicitous admirer - Lynskey has injected her scene-stealing prowess into a multitude of small-screen gigs: among them, HBO's exalted tragicomedy Togetherness (2015), which showcased her \"sublime\" (Vanity Fair) depiction of a dissatisfied stay-at-home mom; macabre Stephen King spookfest Castle Rock (2018), where she headlined as pill-popping psychic Molly Strand; and all-star political period piece Mrs. America (2020), in which she joined forces with Cate Blanchett. For her spellbinding work on Showtime's Yellowjackets (2021) - where she's front-and-centre as Shauna, a suburban housewife consumed by horrific secrets - Lynskey collected the coveted Critics' Choice Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series (2022), with Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall describing her turn in the runaway cult smash as the \"dark, messy, charismatic part she's been waiting her whole career to play\".\n\nA likable, boyish-looking actor with thick eyebrows and a friendly smile, Justin Long is a native of Connecticut.\n\nHe was born and raised in Fairfield, the second of three sons. His father, R. James Long, is a Professor of Philosophy at Fairfield University, and his mother, Wendy Lesniak, is a former Broadway actress. He is of German, Sicilian, and Polish descent. He attended Fairfield Prep, and after graduating, he attended Vassar College. He first really showed his promise as a member of the comedy troupe \"LaughingStock.\" His performing talent garnered favorable notices and he won roles in some independent productions, notably Galaxy Quest - Planlos durchs Weltall (1999). However, he refused to act full time until after he graduated, which he did in 2000. He first gained notice when he played the nervous teenager Warren Cheswick in the TV series Ed - Der Bowling-Anwalt (2000). The following year, he starred in the offbeat horror film Jeepers Creepers - Es ist angerichtet (2001). The film, with its ghoulish ending, was a major hit on the horror circuit and raised his profile.\n\nHe played the boyfriend of Britney Spears in Not a Girl (2002), and won a supporting role in the Vince Vaughn comedy Voll auf die Nüsse (2004). He had high-profile roles in some offbeat independent films, most notably Raising Genius (2004) and Abserviert (2005), and scored commercial success again when he played Lindsay Lohan's boyfriend in Herbie Fully Loaded - Ein toller Käfer startet durch (2005). In 2007, he appeared as second lead in the fourth \"Die Hard\" film, Stirb langsam 4.0 (2007).\n\nHe continues to win acclaim and fans. He scored commercial success again with a role in the Jennifer Aniston romantic comedy Trennung mit Hindernissen (2006). He is private about his personal life and does not make a point of attending nightclubs and parties. However, his personal life did get scrutiny in 2008, due to his romance with actress Drew Barrymore that year.\n\nIn addition to his film appearances, he is a spokesman for the Apple Mac computers, appearing with John Hodgman in its commercials.\n\nKristin Chenoweth is an American stage, screen and television actress, though, depending on who you ask, Chenoweth fans may disagree on what her most famous roles are. Since Chenoweth began her career, she has been credited with roles in musicals and plays on and off-Broadway, on various television shows and can be seen in movies on television and the big screen. She has also lent her recognizable voice numerous times to animated features.\n\nChenoweth was born in the small town of Broken Arrow, OK. Soon after her birth, Chenoweth was adopted by Jerry and Junie Chenoweth. She is very open about her adoption and has been known to support various adoption causes and organizations around the U.S. Although Chenoweth knows the backgrounds of her birth parents, she has commented that she has little interest in meeting them. The Chenoweth family includes older brother Mark. Chenoweth graduated from Broken Arrow High School and went on to study Musical Theater at Oklahoma City University. Under the guidance of Florence Birdwell, Chenoweth flourished in stage and vocal performance. She later received her Master's Degree in Opera Performance at OCU.\n\nAn avid fan of all things Oklahoman, Chenoweth was inducted into the 2010 State Hall of Fame. Fans of Kristin Chenoweth, the stage actress, have seen her stealing performances in Steel Pier, Epic Proportions, and The Apple Tree. In 1999, Chenoweth received the Tony Award for her performance as \"Sally\" in \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\". Chenoweth is well-known as the originator of \"Glinda\" in the 2003 mega-hit musical \"Wicked\". The role, written with Chenoweth in mind, earned her a Tony Award Nomination amongst many other accolades. Chenoweth returned to Broadway in 2010, alongside Sean Hayes in the Broadway revival of \"Promises, Promises\". In January of 2007, Chenoweth became the third musical theater performer in history to have a solo performance at NYC's Metropolitan Opera. She has also performed with various Symphonies around the world. Chenoweth has recorded 3 studio albums. Those who know Kristin best from her various television performances remember her as the quirky, down on love, \"Olive Snook\" on Pushing Daisies (2007). The role won Ms. Chenoweth an Emmy Award in 2009 for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. The show, ultimately canceled shortly after its 2nd season, is still considered by Kristin to be one of her favorite characters to play.\n\nIn 2001, Chenoweth starred in the short-lived NBC comedy Kristin (2001). She has also been seen on The West Wing: Im Zentrum der Macht (1999), Alles Betty! (2006) and has a recurring role on Fox's Glee (2009) as the recovering alcoholic has-been, but lovable \"April Rhodes\" . Her appearances on \"Glee\" earned her a 3rd Emmy nomination. Most recently, Ms. Chenoweth had a small part in the 2010 comedy, Du schon wieder (2010). She has also had roles in Mein Schatz, unsere Familie und ich (2008), Blendende Weihnachten (2006), Krass (2006) and link=tt0420223]. In 2009, Chenoweth took on the challenging role as \"Linda\" in the film, Into Temptation (2009). Ms. Chenoweth is bi-coastal, spending a good amount of time in both New York and Los Angeles.\n\nIntriguing, inspiring, and never less than interesting -- key adjectives in describing the career of Beverly D'Angelo, which has well passed the four-decade mark. Perhaps deserving better movies than she generally found herself in, she nevertheless was always an object of fascination and the one to watch...whatever the role. Hardly the shrinking violet type, Hollywood counted on her for her colorful personality, down-to-earth demeanor and scene-stealing capabilities.\n\nBeverly Heather D'Angelo was born on November 15, 1951 in Columbus, Ohio, the daughter of musicians Priscilla Ruth (Smith), a violinist, and Eugene Constantino \"Gene\" D'Angelo, a bass player who also managed a TV station. Her maternal grandfather, Howard Dwight Smith, was the architect who designed the Ohio (\"Horseshoe\") Stadium at Ohio State University. Her mother had English, Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry, and her father was of Italian descent. Beverly once attended an American school in Florence, Italy.\n\nInitially drawn to art, Beverly worked as a animator/cartoonist at Hanna-Barbera Productions before moving to Canada to pursue a rock singing career, To make ends meet she worked as a session vocalist and sang anyplace she could -- from coffeehouses to topless bars. At one point the teenager was invited to join up with rockabilly legend Ronnie Hawkins. Beverly's acting career started up when she left the Hawkins band and joined the Charlottetown Festival repertory company. She was touring Canada as Ophelia in \"Kronborg: 1582\", a rock musical version of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" when the renowned Colleen Dewhurst caught a performance and saw promise in both Beverly and the show. Eventually musical director Gower Champion got into the mix and the show was completely revamped, becoming the rock musical \"Rockabye Hamlet\", which made its way to Broadway in 1976. While the show itself was short-lived, Beverly's Ophelia attracted fine notices and she soon found herself on the West coast with film and TV opportunities. After this point, she seldom returned to the stage but did star alongside Ed Harris in the 1995 off-Broadway production of Sam Shepard's \"Simpatico\", which earned her a Theatre World Award.\n\nA role in the TV miniseries Der Preis der Macht (1976) led to bit parts in Hexensabbat (1977) and in the Woody Allen classic Der Stadtneurotiker (1977). A string of co-starring roles followed with First Love (1977), the Clint Eastwood starrer Der Mann aus San Fernando (1978) and the film adaptation of the hit counterculture musical Hair (1979). Best of all for Beverly was her powerhouse featured performance as the one-and-only Patsy Cline in the acclaimed biopic Nashville Lady (1980). Both she and Oscar winner Sissy Spacek (as fellow country singer Loretta Lynn) expertly supplied their own vocals.\n\nPlaying everything from tough-as-nails prostitutes, party girls and barflies to rich, prim widows and depressed, alcoholic moms, most of Beverly's output was solid during this time. Playing happening kind of gals, she customarily rose above much of the standard comedic or dramatic material given. An interesting gallery of offbeat characters came her way in a number of hit-or-miss features: Ich brauche einen Erben (1981), Der Chaos-Express (1984), Sterben... und leben lassen (1986), Traumfrau vom Dienst (1987), High Spirits - Die Geister sind willig! (1988), Cold Front - Ein Killer läuft Amok (1989), Die Erbschleicher (1990), Ein Papst zum Küssen (1991), Man Trouble (1992), Lightning Jack (1994), Zwei Satansbraten außer Rand und Band (1994), Merchants of Venus (1998) and Sugar Town (1999). She also sang in a few of these films.\n\nBeverly attracted mainstream notice as Chevy Chase's beleaguered wife in the comedy spoof Die schrillen Vier auf Achse (1983) and its three sequels. Stronger roles came with such films as the English/Irish production Miracle - Ein geheimnisvoller Sommer (1991) and the Neo-Nazi film American History X (1998). She was also a favorite of director John Schlesinger who used her in Da steht der ganze Freeway Kopf (1981) and Auge um Auge (1996), among others. In the spoof Hilfe, meine Frau ist ein Saurier! (1996), in which she served as associate producer, Beverly gamely starred as a chic Beverly Hills housewife who turns into a flying prehistoric reptile by night. Other offbeat independent filming includes Illuminata (1998), Merchants of Venus (1998), Weaver of Claybank (1915), Black Water Transit (2009), House Bunny (2008), Episode #7.33 (2007), Bounty Killer (2013), Frat Pack (2018) and Dreamland (2016).\n\nOn TV, Beverly scored well as matricide victim Kitty Menendez in Familiendrama in Beverly Hills - Die Geschichte der Menendez-Brüder (1994) and earned an Emmy-nomination (and arguably gave the best performance) as Stella Kowalski opposite \"Hair\" co-star Treat Williams in the TV remake of Endstation Sehnsucht (1984). Other topnotch TV mini-movies included Sündiges Geheimnis - Ich liebe den Freund meiner Mutter (1996) and Das jüngste Gericht - John Lists Story (1993), in which she played Robert Blake's devout wife. On primetime she has been cast quite assertively in recurring parts -- she has been spotted on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999) as a defense attorney; Entourage (2004) as a talent agent; Shooter (2016) as a national security advisor; and Insatiable (2018) as a scheming beauty contestant coach.\n\nBeverly's off-camera romantic life has been just as interesting. Following her relationship with \"Hair\" director Milos Forman, she married Lorenzo Salviati, an economics student who also was an Italian duke. She left Hollywood and lived with him in Europe, but separated after two years and returned. A six-year relationship with Irish director Neil Jordan was followed by one with Oscar-winning production designer Anton Furst; this ended tragically when, just weeks after their breakup, he committed suicide. A former union with the volatile Al Pacino produced twins Olivia and Anton, who were born in 2001.\n\nThese days, Beverly's career on camera has remained secondary to the raising of her children. Occasionally she has made use of her vocal talents performing at L.A. nightclubs and with a jazz band that included brother Jeff. From time to time she still lights up the screen as a brash professional or somebody's colorful mom; whatever time she has on screen, whether major or minor, it is always welcomed and never, ever less than...interesting.\n\nKate Micucci was born in New Jersey and spent most of her school years in Pennsylvania. As a kid, she focused on playing outside in the woods and playing classical piano. In college, she majored in art, focusing on painting and making puppets. She received an A.A. in Fine Arts from Keystone College.\n\nAfter a small stint watering banana and pineapple plants in Hawaii, Kate decided to go to Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where she made more puppets and received a B.A. in Studio Art. Since 2008 she has resided in Los Angeles, where she has a steady gig building sandcastles. She also works as an actor and can be found around town playing the ukulele.\n\nKate is the co-creator and co-star of the group \"Garfunkel and Oates\", which she created with Riki Lindhome. The girls were named one of Variety's Comics to Watch in 2010, and their two-woman show regularly sold out at Largo, UCB, Meltdown, and Super Serious Show. The IFC series Garfunkel and Oates, which the girls also co-created, wrote and starred in, was IFC's third highest series premiere in the network's history. In addition to comedy, Kate and Riki have written songs for Universal's \"Search Party\", Paramount's \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" animated feature, and \"The Big Bang Theory\". Kate has also appeared in the film \"When in Rome\" and has a recurring role on the television show Raising Hope. Most recently she wrapped filming the lead role in \"Unleashed\", directed by Finn Taylor; Mike Birbiglia's \"Don't Think Twice\", which premiered at SXSW; \"Easy,\" the Joe Swanberg anthology for Netflix; and Jeff Baena's new film \"The Little Hours\", which premiered at Sundance.\n\nPaget Brewster is an American actress. Her career started in the early 1990s, but her breakthrough was portraying FBI agent Emily Prentiss in the long-running police procedural series \"Criminal Minds\" (2005-2020, 2022-). Prentiss was introduced as the replacement to the character of Elle Greenaway (played by Lola Glaudini) who resigned in the 2nd season. Brewster portrayed the character regularly from 2006 to 2012, and again since 2016.\n\nBrewster is also a prominent voice actress in animation. Her most prominent voice roles so far were portraying the reporter Audrey Timmonds in \"Godzilla: The Series\" (1998-2000), the super-heroine Birdgirl/Judy Ken Sebben in \"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law\" (2000-2018) and the sequel series \"Birdgirl\" (2021-2022), bounty hunter Rona Vipra in \"Duck Dodgers\" (2003-2005). Lana Lang in \"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\" (2012), Lois Lane in \"Justice League: Gods and Monsters\" (2015), Poison Ivy in \"Batman and Harley Quinn\" (2017) , and the adventurer Della Duck in \"DuckTales\" (2017-2021). Della was depicted as the twin sister of Della Duck. The character of Della was created for the \"Donald Duck\" comic strip in 1937, but had been limited to minor appearances until her re-introduction in \"DuckTales\" .\n\nIn 1969, Brewser was born in Concord, Massachusetts, to Galen Brewster and his wife Hathaway Tew. Both of her parents worked as school administrators at Middlesex School, a non-sectarian high school located in Concord. Brewster spend most of her early life in Massachusetts. She moved to New York City for her college education, as a design student at the Parsons School of Design. During her first year there, she took some acting roles. She eventually decided to drop out of the design school, and to pursue acting as a full-time career.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Brewster moved to San Francisco, in order to take acting classes. In 1995, she became the host of the late-night talk show \"The Paget Show\" at KPIX-TV. Her first notable acting role in television was portraying the recurring role of the actress Kathy in the fourth season of the sitcom \"Friends\". She appeared in the series from 1997 to 1998. Kathy was depicted as a love interest to both Joey Tribbiani (played by Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler Bing (played by Matthew Perry). The love triangle caused some problems in the relationship of the two men. Kathy was written out of the series when she left Chandler for another man.
