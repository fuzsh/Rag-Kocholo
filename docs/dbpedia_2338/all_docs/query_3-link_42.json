Wade - District 10     In 2020, Nancy Wade and Ashley Woodthorp organized the Heart of Lincoln Square Neighbors Association Save Your Ash campaign (HOLS SYA).

Funds were raised to treat almost all of HOLS ash trees and protect them for two years. They reinstated the campaign in January 2023 for continued protection. Their goal is to continue to preserve the many benefits trees provide: crime reduction and increased income, better physical and mental health, flood and heat island prevention, and wildlife habitat.

She could tell these folks had no one else to turn to for help, and she assisted about 100 seniors. She continues this work, expanding services to include helping seniors retain their housing, identify alternatives, drive them to appointments, and tap resources to cover moving costs, security deposits and other expenses (a big thank you to Common Pantry’s Housing Fund!).

The campaign gives people in the HOLS area an opportunity to protect their street ash trees from an invasive insect, the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) that has killed half of Chicago’s public ash trees since it arrived in 2008. Ash are about 12%, or 45,000, of Chicago’s street trees, about 1,000 in each ward. Chicago had been successfully treating them for EAB up until 2018 when that budget was cut. Letting them die and removing them is ten times more expensive than treating them.\n\nNancy and Ashley recruited volunteers to survey the local ash, tie signs to trees, and talk to neighbors door to door. Funds were raised to treat almost all of HOLS ash trees and protect them for two years. They reinstated the campaign in January 2023 for continued protection. Their goal is to continue to preserve the many benefits trees provide: crime reduction and increased income, better physical and mental health, flood and heat island prevention, and wildlife habitat. They continue to lobby the City of Chicago to restore funding.\n\nDiane Geers - District 11\n\nAs a Catholic school educator for 44 years, Diane Geers has experienced a multitude of rewarding accomplishments through coaching, mentoring, and fundraising efforts for numerous organizations. For 30 years, she coached girls volleyball at various schools and parks, led as the fundraising coordinator for Breast Cancer Night and fundraising treasurer for St. Baldrick’s Foundation, and volunteered for a decade in the tutorial program for Valentine Boys and Girls Club.\n\nHer involvement as a Chicago Park District community activist is unparalleled, giving generously of her time and talents to many, particularly as a mentor and model to young girls and teens. Her life has been a life of service above self.\n\nKathleen Trainor - District 12\n\nKathleen Trainor was born in Lincoln Square and has lived here for many years. She has always loved getting involved in her community in various ways. She was fortunate to have meaningful work all her life –a 40-year career in affordable housing, followed by a few years as the Director of the Common Pantry in North Center.\n\nIn 2020, Kathleen began volunteering for her new 47th Ward Alderman, Matt Martin. Soon thereafter, a long-awaited senior development – Ravenswood Senior Living -- opened its doors. The demand for this housing was tremendous. The application was online and that presented a barrier for many seniors. So she began helping seniors apply, assemble the documentation they needed, get answers to their questions, and advocate for them. She loved the work, and it clearly filled a need. She could tell these folks had no one else to turn to for help, and she assisted about 100 seniors. She continues this work, expanding services to include helping seniors retain their housing, identify alternatives, drive them to appointments, and tap resources to cover moving costs, security deposits and other expenses (a big thank you to Common Pantry’s Housing Fund!). As she has shared, \"It is so gratifying to have found a way to help that is so important and appreciated!\"\n\nLuisette Kraal - District 13\n\nLast summer, a chance encounter with newly arrived asylum seekers sprung Luisette Kraal into action. Word of a dinner invitation spread, and hundreds of hungry migrants just off the bus from Texas arrived at her home. Witnessing their needs, she sought donations and quickly created a free store in Sabka Shaara’s storefront church basement to distribute clothes and shoes. Her efforts expanded, and she now offers hot meals, shelter, grief sessions to process trauma, transportation, medical care, and holiday parties. Dubbed Nuevos Vecinos, her rapidly created organization has created a welcoming community for more than 1000 asylum seekers.\n\nA native of Curacao in the Dutch Caribbean, Luisette is a nurse, writer, Bible teacher, life coach, Dutch Bible translator, and pastor’s wife. She holds a Master of Science in Nursing from the Rijks University in Maastricht, Netherlands, and a Master of Arts in Biblical Studies from Moody Theological Seminary. Luisette and her husband provide ministry to the Spanish-speaking refugee community and are guided by their “Saved to Serve” life slogan. Luisette has two biological daughters and fostered three sons with AIDS and cancer.\n\nVolunteers and donations to Nuevos Vecinos are recruited through the all-volunteer Refugee Community Connection group on Facebook.\n\nLiz Kunkle - District 14\n\nLiz Kunkle was raised in Winnetka and moved back in 2008 with her young family. As a long-time avid recycler, she enthusiastically joined her elementary school’s Environmental PTO committee. She quickly became chair of the committee and stayed in that role until her youngest child graduated. In 2011, she founded Go Green Winnetka, one of numerous community environmental advocacy groups in the Go Green Illinois network that focus on issues in their own communities, share best practices, and collaborate to address challenges across municipal boundaries. Since then, she was appointed to Winnetka’s Environmental and Forestry and Plan Commissions and has been integrally involved in drafting the community’s Sustainability Plan and 2040 Comprehensive Plan. More recently, she quit her “day job” as a trademark attorney to focus on environmental issues full-time. She has worked for Collective Resource Compost, a woman-owned food scrap pick-up and compost company, and is a Board member and Policy Committee co-chair of the Illinois Food Scrap & Composting Coalition, a nonprofit advancing diversion and composting of all organics in Illinois. Everything Liz does is with an eye toward raising environmental awareness, inspiring people to take individual and collective action, and creating more sustainable, just, and climate resilient communities.\n\nKathryn Cawley - District 15\n\nKathryn (Kasia) Cawley is the first woman Police Chief in Hoffman Estates. She has served the District 15 community on the police force for 23 years moving up in the ranks to lead the department. In a short time, she obtained funding to hire the first police social worker to assist in response to police calls, especially calls involving domestic violence. She began her career in the Air National Guard, where she served in Security Forces. She holds a bachelor's degree in Sociology and a master’s degree in Public Safety Administration. She also graduated from Northwestern University's School of Police Staff and Command. Kasia serves on the Board of Directors for the Major Case Assistance Team and is involved with organizations such as the Hoffman Estates Charitable Foundation, the Children’s Advocacy Center, Habitat for Humanity and Special Olympics. Outside of her Police Chief role, she enjoys spending time with friends and family and her book club. She is married and is mother to a 15-year-old daughter. She is going the extra mile in May when she will compete in a 6-mile obstacle course race with the proceeds going to first responders and their families.\n\nAntonia Ruppert - District 16\n\nAntonia Ruppert is an Illinois artist who has been creating for over 25 years. She creates paintings that tell a story, and she fell in love with art as a child upon seeing her Dad draw after coming home from work. The oldest of six siblings, she recalls drawing horses and people on tons of pink paper that was gifted to her by the dentist office. Now creating on canvas, panels and paper using all kinds of paint, she is inspired by stories of unity, love and hope.\n\nCurrently, Ruppert is excited about her work in various Chicagoland communities and throughout the 16th District, sharing her passion for arts and artivism. On the board of Sarah's Inn, a domestic violence awareness and prevention agency, she seeks to uplift her entire community with creative expression. She has been Featured in the Museum of Science and Industry Black Creativity Exhibition, Moraine Valley CC Regional Showcase and the Dupage Art League's Best of the Best Exhibition.
