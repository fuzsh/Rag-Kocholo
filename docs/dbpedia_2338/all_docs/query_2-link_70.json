The program has achieved both its only #1 ranking in the AP poll and only advancement to the Elite Eight during his tenure. Gottfried played three seasons of basketball at Alabama, and the Crimson Tide advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in each of those seasons. Gottfried resigned as head coach at Alabama on January 26, 2009, two days after the Crimson Tide suffered a 10-point loss to Kentucky and the recent departure of point guard Ronald Steele.\n\nPrep career\n\nHe graduated from Mobile’s UMS Prep, now known as UMS-Wright Preparatory School, in 1982. He played on the UMS basketball team for one season, averaging 21.6 ppg/11.2 rpg, and was a inducted into the National Honor Society. Gottfried was inducted into UMS-Wright’s Hall of Fame and in 2004 was the UMS Alumnus of the Year. He also attended Carterville High School in Carterville, Illinois (14 ppg/4 apg) and Carbondale High School in Carbondale, Illinois (16 ppg/6 apg).\n\nCollege career\n\nGottfried graduated with a Bachelor of Arts & Sciences in Communications from the University of Alabama in 1987. He attended Oral Roberts on a basketball scholarship his freshman season, 1982-1983, before transferring to Alabama. He attended UCLA graduate school for two years.\n\nCoaching career\n\nUCLA\n\nGottfried served as an assistant coach for 8 seasons (1987-95) at UCLA under Jim Harrick. Also members of the staff were former UCLA head coach Steve Lavin and current Washington head coach Lorenzo Romar. The Bruins were the 1995 NCAA Champions with Gottfried as an Assistant Coach & recruiter. The Bruins were ranked 1st nationally for their recruiting class in 1994 and produced future NBA players Ed O'Bannon, George Zidek, Tyus Edney, Don MacLean, Tracy Murray, Pooh Richardson, Trevor Wilson, Darrick Martin and Mitchell Butler.[1] He has faced his former school twice as head coach at Alabama, losing 79–57 in the 2001 John Wooden Classic and losing 62–59 in the 2nd Round of the 2006 NCAA Tournament.\n\nMurray State\n\nGottfried was Head Coach from 1995–97 at Murray State University and compiled a 68–24 overall record.

He led the Tide to the SEC regular season championship in the 2001-2002 season. The following year, his team became the first in Crimson Tide history to be ranked No. 1 in the AP poll. The team held the top spot for two weeks before losing 51-49 to Utah in the second-to-last game before conference play. Since then, his tenure at Alabama has been marked by key player injuries and disappointment. He has posted back to back losing seasons in the SEC in 2006-07 and 2007-08.
