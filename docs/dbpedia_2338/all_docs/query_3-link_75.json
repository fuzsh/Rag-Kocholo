Magazine Best Workplaces - 2018\n\nI am a retired Electrical Engineer – my last job was Chief Engineer of a software company (I was also a co-founder of the company). We developed the Escape sales force management system, a pioneer in the provision of “Software as a Service” (SaaS). After retirement, I have been active as a mentor, volunteer, and investor. I am a member of two organizations (SCORE and Tech Coast Angels that have provided me to obtain knowledge, experience and contacts that are directly applicable to mentorship of entrepreneurs:\n\nSCORE is a nation-wide nonprofit organization dedicated to helping small businesses. I have been a Mentor since 2012, during which time I have had the opportunity to assist many (a few hundred) small businesses in various aspects of start-up planning, finance, and management of on-going operations. I developed and am currently presenting workshops in the areas of Start-up Planning, and development of Value Propositions, Business Models and Financial Projections.\n\nTech Coast Angels is one of the largest and most active angel investment networks in the country, focused mainly on Tech and Life Science. I am a member of the Tech committee and am involved in screening and conducting “Due Diligence” of companies that have applied for funding.\n\nIt has been my experience that entrepreneurial success requires not only a great idea and the passion and persistence to bring it to life, but also a sound grasp of the fundamentals of business, a maniacal attention to details, and the flexibility to make adjustments as needed. I can offer both an extensive technical background and recent experience in assisting small businesses to help you succeed.\n\nJohn C. Wills\n\nPresident/CEO; FLI, Incorporated; Santa Monica, CA\n\nMy interest in being a mentor for the Lavin Entrepreneur Center is centered on helping accelerate and reinforce the skills and knowledge the Center is imparting during its two year program. A mentor cannot prepare a mentee for the future chapters in their career. However, once a bond of trust is established the relationship can provide great value to both parties in supporting the acquisition of the tools needed to succeed in the future.\n\nI have been mentoring and coaching SDSU students from various disciplines since 2013. As a consultant for the last 40+ years I believe I have a good understanding of how to help others achieve their goals. My clients have represented a diverse set of industries, roles, and responsibilities with a common objective of improving the productivity of their organizations, their employees, and their customers.\n\nAt FLI, my responsibilities include corporate marketing, sales, planning, and operations. I also participate actively in client consulting and project activities. My career, supported by many mentors and coaches, has allowed me to develop extensive experience in business consulting, strategic and tactical planning, sales, marketing, business and project management, software design and development, and performance system design, development, and delivery.\n\nPrevious career experiences:\n\n1979-80: Director; Tratec/McGraw Hill; Los Angeles, CA\n\n1975-79: Vice President; Tratec, Inc.; Los Angeles, CA\n\n1969-75: Director; Burroughs Corporation; Detroit, MI\n\n1965-69: Captain; USAF; Wichita Falls, TX\n\n1960-65: B.S.—Accounting/Business Administration; SDSU; San Diego, CA\n\n1956-60: Graduated; Helix High School; La Mesa, CA\n\nSDSU affiliations:\n\n2017-present: SDSU Campanile Foundation Board (TCF) – Member\n\n2019-present: SDSU TCF Executive Committee – Member\n\n2018-present: SDSU TCF Finance & Investment Committee – Chair\n\n2013-present: SDSU Los Angeles Regional Council – Founding Member\n\n1965-present: SDSU Alumni – Lifetime Member\n\nLinkedIn profile: www.linkedin.com/in/john-c-wills\n\nWatch Introduction\n\nI have over 30 years of experience in operations, manufacturing, and product development, having held management and executive positions throughout my career. I earned my BSME degree at the University of Texas and immediately joined Hewlett Packard in Rancho Bernardo. I held positions in both manufacturing and product development during my 15 years there. I then joined a small $2M startup company that grew into a $200M operation (global supplier of automation equipment) in Carlsbad where I retired as VP Operations a few years back. I now serve as a Certified Mentor for San Diego SCORE and champion their Advisory Board program with the goal of giving back to our business community. I have enjoyed the process of mentoring throughout my career, and I’m excited at the prospect of participating in the Lavin Entrepreneur Program.\n\nI can offer strong guidance in the areas of manufacturing, product development, supply chain, customer support services, career development, and engineering. I have specific skills in the application of Lean Enterprise tools (process improvement, problem solving), project management, people management, and business software system implementation. I have a strong understanding of the importance of culture and values in building a successful company. I have less depth in the areas of marketing, sales, and finance.\n\nMelissa Martin founded Wean Green in 2009 when she was on maternity leave from teaching first grade in Canada. She saw a market need for an eco-friendly storage option to store her homemade baby food and toddler snacks for her 2 daughters. To get started, Melissa grabbed her Mr.Sketch markers and created a business plan centered around infinitely recyclable glass containers that has survived a decade's worth of twists and turns.\n\nNever one to not maximize her \"spare\" time, Melissa has been involved in many organizations including Children's Wish Foundation, Alberta Women Entrepreneurs, 10,000 Kids Charity, Alberta Children's Hospital and most recently she has been mentoring companies at District Ventures which is\n\nan accelerator program started by Arlene Dickinson one of Canada’s foremost women entrepreneurs.. She has also been an active board member of Believe in the Gold charity and chaired their annual gala.\n\nMelissa splits her time between Canada & California and will be primarly a remote mentor.\n\nHer love for the environment and the outdoors has driven much of her company's passion for creating eco-friendly products.\n\nToday through her company, Melissa's enthusiasm is focused on eliminating single use plastic that is often found in lunches at school and work. She works with organizations around the world to\n\nhelp advocate for the curtailment of plastic waste and encourage consumers to purchase sustainable products.\n\nI like to refer to myself as a blue collar white collar kind of guy. Raised in an Irish Catholic blue-collar family in New Haven, CT, I grew up working very hard to help pay my way through college (Brown University) and Harvard Business School. My motor and work ethic have always been high.\n\nI started out my career in tech ... first with Westinghouse as a project manager for its U.S. Dept. of Defense radar division and following b-school I joined Hewlett-Packard's San Diego Division in printer peripheral marketing. The 1980s were booming with entrepreneurial opportunities so I left HP in 1988 to seek fame and fortune with a much smaller tech company. I succeeded, and failed, in a handful of them ... all the while learning a LOT. By 2004 I was done with the many trials and tribulations of the tech sector and decided to finish my career as a small business owner. I bought a small, two-person sign company (design, fabrication and installation of commercial signs) that was barely doing any business and grew it to 15 employees and $1.6M in revenue. History often repeats itself and along with many successes as a small business owner I endured, and learned from, many failures the lessons from which I share openly. I sold the business in 2019 just in time to retire before the pandemic hit.\n\nI have been a SCORE mentor for a year now and I absolutely love it. My approach is very open, non-judgemental and broad-based ... I can converse as easily at the 50,000 foot strategic level as I can at a highly detailed level. Every one of my SCORE clients is a unique individual and I treat each as such. I like the teaching aspect of mentoring and, just as much, I enjoy brainstorming and exploring new ideas, approaches and different ways of doing things. My clients say they appreciate my open-mindedness, sincerity, upbeat demeanor and generosity with my time.\n\nI was born and raised in San Diego and graduated from Marian Catholic High School before attending Cal Poly, Pomona, where I received a Bachelor’s of Science Degree in Biology. I returned to college several years later and received my MBA from San Diego State.\n\nJob history and brief description:\n\nSan Diego County Department of Environmental Health. After working for two summers with the county in the vector control division (where we worked on handling populations of potentially disease carrying pests, such as mosquitoes and rodents), I was able to secure a permanent position with the county as a county health inspector upon receiving my BS degree.\n\nLloyd Pest Control. After roughly three years with the county, I received an opportunity to move into private industry with Lloyd Pest Control and decided to make the move. At Lloyd, I served in the role of technical and training director for the first 18 years of my career. In this role I was responsible for training, safety compliance, quality assurance/control and portions of our HR processes.\n\nDuring my time as technical director, the company began exposing me to the operational processes at Lloyd, and I had the opportunity to serve as a branch manager of two offices, giving me a chance to dive deeper into the running of the business, which I found I enjoyed a great deal.\n\nEventually, I was promoted into one of two COO positions, initially running the termite division which comprised approximately 25% of total company revenue. In 2012, I was promoted again and became COO for the entire organization. During my time as the sole COO, Lloyd Pest Control has grown revenues by ~ 73% from roughly $22 million in overall revenue to what should be close to $38 million in revenue by the end of calendar year 2021.\n\nBusiness Strengths:\n\nOperational efficiencies\n\nGrowth through acquisition\n\nDevelopment and enrichment of company culture\n\nProcess management\n\nForecasting and budgeting\n\nIntegration of all disciplines into a cohesive growth model\n\nNote: While I admire those true entrepreneurs – the ones who wake up each day with a new vision to create another business model that satisfies a consumer need - that is not my strength. I am very comfortable in growing and strengthening a business but have never had the overwhelming desire to CREATE a new one. I am excited to mentor a young entrepreneur and guide them in the processes of a business, but as this is an entrepreneur program, I thought that would be good to share.\n\nSteve Griffin has been a Strategy Consultant for over 25 years, focused primarily on the Communications and Media industries. After a degree in Mathematics and Computing Science and a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Surrey, UK, a year with IBM and a failed first startup, Steve joined PA Consulting in London and knew he had found his calling: making things happen!\n\nSteve started a boutique consulting company with four colleagues in 2003. IBB Consulting Group focused on the upcoming convergence of broadband, wireless and media, helping clients in each industry identify these shifts and capitalize on them. The company grew to 160 consultants globally as the convergence accelerated, before being acquired in 2017 by Accenture Strategy, where Steve was a Managing Director for three years.\n\nSteve’s expertise is in bridging the gap between business, engineering and operations. He has a flair for analyzing complex business problems, identifying appropriate strategies, then architecting and delivering pragmatic solutions. Steve was privileged to work with many of the leading service providers, technology giants and content producers worldwide.\n\nSteve feels incredibly lucky to have a number of amazing mentors throughout his career, and now retired he is focused on giving back and helping local entrepreneurs find success. Steve volunteers his time as a Mentor at SCORE, providing pro bono strategy and planning advice to small business clients in San Diego, as well as investing in local startups.\n\nVic Wintriss BEE, ME, MSEE\n\nAs chairman and founder of Wintriss Technical Schools, dba The League Of Amazing Programmers I started a non-profit after-school program to teach underserved kids the Java computer programming language.

Purchased by Honeywell Control Systems and eventually spun off, the product line has metamorphosed to the punch press products now available at www.wintriss.com.\n\nAs a Commander in the U. S. Navy I flew Lockheed P2V (Neptune) and P3C (Orion) patrol plane aircraft from Jacksonville, Florida and Patuxent River, Maryland, accumulating over 5,000 hours of flight time searching the north Atlantic for Russian submarines during the cold war.
