        "text": "On Dec. 19, 2000, Oklahoma State basketball player Jason Keep stepped in front of a pass against Arkansas-Little Rock in the final minute, fumbling to gather the dribble before throwing down a two-handed dunk.\n\nAs a defender rushed underneath, Keep swung on the rim and the backboard shattered. Students rushed the floor of Gallagher-Iba Arena in Stillwater, Okla., picking up souvenirs of his raw power.\n\nKeep soon became a “SportsCenter”-fueled celebrity. The blood-pumping moment spotlighted his towering basketball presence as he funneled his aggression toward a ball and a rim.\n\n“Chaos, some run away from it as far as they can,” Keep said. “Some run right to it. That’s me. That’s who I am. I’m a fighter. It made me good at what I did in basketball.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/i95SKWkRaug?si=ASGG3O77Fs8AkGn4In life?\n\nThat’s where Keep’s story gets complicated and, at turns, both crushing and concerning. His tale also is inspirational, significant warts and all.\n\nKeep returned to the University of San Diego 21 years after leading the Toreros to the NCAA Tournament to finish his college degree. He graduated last Sunday at age 46.\n\n“It’s been a long journey, to say the least,” Keep said.\n\nAlong the way, Keep’s road was littered with unthinkable tragedy, poor decisions and a sprinkle or three of bad timing.\n\nThere was the loss of a daughter, stillborn after becoming tangled in the umbilical cord. Six months later, two of his Oklahoma State teammates and friends — along with eight others — were killed in a plane crash as the Cowboys returned from a game in Boulder, Colo.\n\nKeep sparred with legendary OSU coach Eddie Sutton. There was a driving while intoxicated charge. The sides agreed on a split and he eventually landed in San Diego with the Toreros.\n\nThe 6-foot-10 sequoia starred immediately at USD, scoring 30 points and grabbing 16 rebounds in win over UCLA at Pauley Pavilion. He propelled the team past Gonzaga in the West Coast Conference championship game for USD’s first NCAA Tournament berth in 16 years.\n\nIn spite of his size and skills and a still-NBA Combine record of 27 reps bench pressing 185 pounds — and 17 interviews with NBA teams, former USD coach Brad Holland said — Keep failed to catch on.\n\nKeep played overseas in at least 15 countries, but his non-basketball life began to spiral. He ended up in Arizona, working security at strip clubs and leading the treacherous fast life that came with it.\n\nOn Dec. 31, 2013, three men robbed strip club employees of $18,000 outside of an IHOP in Phoenix, according to police. A chase ensued and an officer and off-duty sheriff’s office volunteer were shot.\n\nThe next day, SWAT officers kicked down Keep’s door. He was charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery. He fought it, swearing to this day he was not involved beyond sharing some information with the assailants.\n\nKeep spent two years in jail.\n\nUnable to get a job because of his criminal record, Keep said he became desperate for money. When someone offered him $7,000 to transport undocumented migrants in September 2016, he agreed.\n\nPolice stopped Keep as he pulled into a Casa Grande, Ariz., McDonald’s to buy food and drinks for the passengers. They discovered three migrants in the car and two more in the trunk.\n\nThat led to a two-year sentence. Keep violated conditions of his release, and was ordered to finish out the sentence at a medium-security prison north of Phoenix known as Black Canyon.\n\nRock bottom, as they call it. He’s been rebuilding from ashes ever since.\n\nKeep’s book, in his mind, has incomplete chapters. Happier ones. Successful ones. Prove-yourself ones. The time came to stop being stuck on the old pages and write new, healthier ones.\n\nFew wanted to take a chance on a felon.\n\nUSD, the place where Keep played his best basketball, offered a cracked doorway. Former athletic director Bill McGillis bought in. Basketball coach Steve Lavin, whom Keep had beaten at UCLA, did too.\n\nKeep had promised family and Holland that he would graduate.\n\nThen he did, walking the stage last Sunday at Jenny Craig Pavilion alongside graduates less than half his age.\n\nTheir lives, just beginning. His, clawing for traction and rebirth.\n\n“It’s been a grind,” Keep said. “Bouncing around Airbnbs because you can’t find a place to rent with a record, going to school full-time with five classes, helping the basketball team. But it was something to work for, something to live for.\n\n“This is the right road. These are good people. This is my chance.”\n\nHeartbreak, then shock\n\nAsk Keep about all the twists and turns in his life, and accountability blurs with the haziness of history. He willingly accepts responsibility for some things, while lamenting the fickleness of fate related to others.\n\nKeep said he was suspended at Moscow (Idaho) High School after breaking a backboard and not initially owning up to it. He later admitted that discharging a gun inside city limits contributed to the suspension as well.\n\nKeep hunted fresh starts in Bend, Ore., and Pullman, Wash., before working six months on an oil rig near the Idaho-Wyoming border to make ends meet.\n\n“It was an H25 well, very dangerous,” Keep said. “If the parts-per-million sirens went off, you had to mask up, jump off the rig and run for your life. I decided that wasn’t for me.”\n\nKeep ran from the well to North Idaho College, which offered him a basketball scholarship. It was there that he caught the eye of Oklahoma State.\n\nMajor-college program. A daughter on the way. The horizon seemed bright. The future, boundless.\n\nThe baby was full term, a few days beyond the due date. Doctors induced labor, but the baby was born without a heartbeat. A tattoo, one of many on Keep, honors Alli Anne Marie.\n\n“She’d be 24,” Keep said quietly, reflectively. “I was crushed.”\n\nMonths later, on Jan. 27, 2001, the Cowboys’ plane crashed. The team traveled on three planes. Keep normally was on the third plane, routinely traveling with those pilots.\n\nLast-minute shuffling put Keep on another plane as broadcasters, staff and teammates Nate Fleming and Dan Lawson climbed aboard the twin-engine prop plane.\n\nBack in Stillwater, Keep kept calling his friends because the three had a homework assignment to finish for the next day. He found out the plane had crashed and all 10 aboard died after the pilot apparently became disoriented in a snowstorm.\n\n“It’s hard for me to talk about to this day,” said Keep, fighting back the emotional tsunami. “They were my brothers, you know? I cheated death, I guess you could say. Why did I make it home and they didn’t?”\n\nA tattoo on the back of Keep’s neck serves as a tribute to the players.\n\n“I was destroyed, bro,” Keep said. “I thought, this can’t be real. That’s part of why I left. I’m like, I’m outta here. This place is not good luck for me.”\n\nA new opportunity awaited in San Diego, a place Keep liked after experiencing it when the Cowboys played a game at San Diego State.\n\nThe Aztecs shrugged, so he connected with Holland at USD.\n\n“I was willing to give him two years of scholarship for one year of eligibility,” Holland said of Keep, who sat out the first season because of transfer rules. “It was worth it. We don’t beat UCLA at UCLA without Jason Keep. We don’t beat Gonzaga to win the conference tournament to go to the NCAAs without Jason Keep. We had a good team. With him, we had a really good team.\n\n“Jason was a handful at times, but he just needed some tough love.”\n\nBasketball, though, is not forever.\n\n‘Hell on earth’\n\nThe nomadic life of basketball overseas scratched some of Keep’s competitive itch, but it eventually faded. When Keep ended up in Arizona, the search for adrenaline steered him into seedy corners.\n\nQuickly, he was neck-deep in a tricky world.\n\n“It was easy work, the fast life and party scene,” Keep said. “I didn’t really know what I was getting myself into. I got involved more than I wanted.”\n\nHe knew the rich, the connected, the magnets for trouble.\n\nOne man began asking questions and hatching a scheme for what turned into the New Year’s Eve robbery. Keep said he “gave information I shouldn’t have given” but thought he had side-stepped any issues beyond that.\n\nSoon, the police were splintering his door.\n\n“I got played,” Keep said. “I was portrayed as the mastermind or whatever. I was the fall guy. When it all went down, it was like, ‘Is this really happening?’ I’m like, ‘Wait a second.’\n\n“The guy involved said he would clear my name, but it turns out he’s saying something completely different (to police).”\n\nWhen Keep entered prison, the light switch flipped.\n\n“It was hell on earth,” he said. “It was a gladiator ring in that place. I started doing tattoos and stayed in my cell to try to avoid all that stuff.”\n\nOnce out, Keep committed to finding ways to change the script and alter his life. Step one: Try to return to USD and deliver on a promise to get a degree.\n\nHolland coached the Toreros from 1994-2007, and every single one of his players graduated … except Keep. Holland had counseled Keep to walk away from his last classes because his NBA prospects seemed robust.\n\nKeep vowed to finish, no matter how long it took.\n\n“This was a long time in the making,” said Holland, who now lives in La Quinta. “He told me several years ago, ‘I’m going to make (your graduate record) 100 percent, Coach.’ I wanted to believe him, but it’s difficult to come back all these years later.\n\n“Whether you know him or look at his situation from afar, you have to admire the tenacity and willingness and desire: ‘I’m getting my degree. I told my mom I would do that one day. I told my coach I would do that one day.’\n\n“We’re all so proud of him.”\n\nMcGillis and Lavin, the current Toreros coach, began to advocate for the former player. Keep learned about a program named Torero Urban Scholars that works to reconnect those who formerly were incarcerated with higher education.\n\nThings began to click.\n\nThe right path. For once.\n\n“What impressed me the most was his desire was to come back and finish school,” Lavin said. “That’s a terrific example for our current players to gain and appreciate the value of an education.\n\n“I was aware of the school of hard knocks background, but also being a Catholic university, second chances are inherent in our mission. It’s one thing to have mantras and hashtags, but it’s another to back it up through actions the doing.\n\n“And I felt strongly it was valuable for our players to see firsthand how fragile and delicate, tenuous life can be. There’s a living example in Jason Keep of resilience and being able to get back up after you’ve been knocked down.”\n\nSupporting the player who beat you at UCLA?\n\n“When I introduce him to others I say, ‘This is Jason Keep. Former Torero great. Part of the NCAA Tournament team in 2003. He cost me my job,’ ” Lavin said with a laugh.\n\nIt’s more than a punchline for Keep.\n\n“He put his reputation on the line for me,” Keep said. “I’ve never been so thankful in my life. I tell him that all the time.”\n\nAs a basketball volunteer helping the Toreros, his Toreros, Keep said he cherishes a second chance like no other. It’s not only a golden ticket to help himself, but those lacing up sneakers behind him.\n\nAn assist that could matter mightily.\n\n“I try to tell the guys, ‘There might be a time when this all goes away,'” Keep said. “Me, I had it all right there. Then it wasn’t there anymore. Walking across that stage to graduate, it was extremely emotional. I put a lot of hard work into it.\n\n“I’m trying to get back and be something again. I don’t want my past to define me.”\n\nCan it happen? Will it happen?\n\nWith a diploma, there’s a chance to find out."
