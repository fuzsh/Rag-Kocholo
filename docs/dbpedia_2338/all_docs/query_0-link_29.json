In Spencer's first season (1996-97) at UCLA, the Bruins captured their third consecutive Pacific-10 championship.\n\nEarning a reputation around the country as one of the top one-on-one workout coaches, Spencer, 40, came to UCLA after three years of assistant coaching in the Australian National Basketball League.
