        "text": "Italy in support of Ukraine\n\nThis section is currently being updated\n\nItaly condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, which is a blatant violation of international law and humanitarian principles.\n\nItaly highlights its unwavering support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, full sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognized borders and its proactive engagement within the Euro-Atlantic community efforts to support Ukraine.\n\nItaly also fully supports Ukraine’s European path and actively contributed to the granting of EU candidate status to Kyiv.\n\nIn coordination with partners, we strongly condemned Russia’s sham referenda and annexation of the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia and shall never recognize such illegal acts. The Russian Ambassador in Rome was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 3rd 2022 to convey these messages.\n\nWe also support Ukraine’s future reconstruction, in line with the principles and commitments endorsed at the Ukraine Recovery Conference that took place in Lugano on 4-5 July 2022. In line with the priorities of our diplomatic action, we call on Russia to immediately cease hostilities, ensure safe passage to civilians by agreeing and respecting humanitarian corridors, and to refrain from any action that may affect civilian and critical infrastructures or nuclear facilities.\n\nItaly strongly condemns Russian strikes against civilian and critical infrastructure, which continue worsening the humanitarian situation and civilians’ conditions. Italy is ready to work with its partners to bolster Ukraine’s infrastructure resilience, as stated at the Paris Conference on 13 December 2022, where Italy pledged 10 million Euros.\n\nItaly continues to urge Russia to put immediately an end to its escalatory measures, including the irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, and stresses that any use of nuclear weapons by Russia will be met with severe consequences.\n\nWe reject Russia’s actions at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant and the increasing pressures exerted on the staff of the site. The safety, security and safeguards of the nuclear facility are crucial and we fully support the International Atomic Energy Agency’s efforts in this regard.\n\nItaly is in favor of a just peace under Kyiv’s full ownership. Italy appreciates President Zelensky’s formula for peace and supports the plan in principle.\n\nItaly also continues to call on Russia to engage in meaningful dialogue and negotiations aimed at establishing a ceasefire and humanitarian measures with a view to elaborating a shared and sustainable solution to the conflict.\n\nItaly deems it important that channels of communication between Ukraine and Russia remain as open as possible. This has led to practical and localized agreements, such as on the exchanges of prisoners and on the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which have brought some relief.\n\nItaly will continue to exert pressure on Russia by engaging in the multilateral sphere to ensure Russia’s isolation in light of its wanton disregard for the values, principles and norms of the international order, and to pursue its accountability for the gross violations it has committed and continues to perpetrate.\n\nDuring its mandate as Chair of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, Italy presided over the Committee’s decision that ruled that membership of the Russian Federation in the Council of Europe ceased as from 16 March.\n\nIn the OSCE, Italy joined the decision to activate twice the OSCE Moscow Mechanism on Human Dimension to establish a mission of experts to address the human rights and humanitarian impacts of the Russian Federation’s invasion and acts of war on the people of Ukraine.\n\nItaly supports action by the EU aimed at isolating and putting pressure on Russia in the various WTO groups and meetings as well as to suspending concessions or other obligations with respect to the Russian Federation, such as the most-favoured-nation treatment. Likewise, it supports EU action to suspend the accession process of Belarus.\n\nAt the same time, Italy is urging key players to push Russia to exercise restraint and move closer to a diplomatic solution of the crisis through peace talks.\n\nItaly is working with like-minded partners to detect, prevent, monitor and react to Russian disinformation and information manipulation and interference.\n\nItaly joined more than 40 partners in the referral of the situation in Ukraine to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, in order to expedite investigations on alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine. In response to the request made by Prosecutor Khan, Italy has committed a voluntary contribution of half a million Euros to the Trust Fund established by the Office of the Prosecutor and expressed availability to deploy several experts to support the Court’s investigations. It is also providing an additional contribution to the Trust Fund for victims.\n\nTogether with its partners, Italy has repeatedly affirmed its support for Ukraine’s application instituting proceedings against Russia before the International Court of Justice under the 1948 Genocide Convention. Last 15 September Italy, invoking article 63 of the Court’s Statute, officially filed a declaration of intervention in the said case.\n\nItaly intervened as third party in the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights concerning Ukraine’s allegations of mass and gross human-rights violations committed by the Russian Federation in its military operations.\n\nItaly co-sponsored and voted in favour of the adoption of five Resolutions approved by the United Nations General Assembly on the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and of the “Veto-Initiative” Resolution, which establishes that, following a veto in the Security Council, the General Assembly is automatically convened within 10 days. Also at the UN General Assembly, in December 2022, Italy co-sponsored and voted in favor of resolution on the situation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and in the city of Sevastopol promoted by Ukraine.\n\nItaly joined the Group of Friends of Accountability following the aggression against Ukraine and has recently joined the Core Group dedicated to achieving accountability for the crime of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nWithin the Human Rights Council (HRC) Italy actively supported Ukrainian initiatives to address ongoing violations of human rights and to promote accountability. At the beginning of March 2022 Italy supported the request to hold an urgent debate on the human rights situation in Ukraine and was among the first co-sponsors of the HRC resolution, which established an independent international Commission of Inquiry (CoI) to investigate all alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, which are occurring in the context of the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine. On the occasion of the 49th HRC session, together with other 50 countries (including all EU MS, US and UK), Italy also joined a cross-regional joint statement promoted by Poland expressing deep concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in Russia. Also within the HRC, together with other 54 Countries,\n\nincluding all EU MS, Italy has supported the convening of the Special Session on the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression held on the 12th of May that led to the adoption of a Resolution co-sponsored by all EU MS and adopted with a large majority (33 votes in favor, 2 against and 12 abstentions), which further details and strengthens the mandate of the CoI. Within the 51th session of the HRC (September-October 2022), Italy co-sponsored a side-event promoted by Ukraine on the issue of accountability.\n\nWe continued to raise the attention on the human rights situation in Ukraine within the Human Rights Council, including by intervening in our national capacity in the interactive dialogue with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on his report addressing killings of civilians committed in parts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions of Ukraine between 24 February and 6 April 2022. In November 2022, Italy also decided to provide a financial contribution amounting to EUR 500.000 to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to support the work of the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. The first amount (EUR 375.000) was already transferred in December 2022.\n\nItaly co-sponsored the Decision, recently adopted by UNESCO Executive Board, to alleviate the consequences of war on Ukraine’s Heritage. Moreover, Italy has been closely involved in finding a solution to the thorny problem of the Presidency of the World Heritage Committee, tasked to protect the World Heritage, entrusted to Russia, responsible for the destruction of Ukrainian Heritage. As a consequence, Italy has been instrumental in fostering a general agreement in the Committee, which resulted in the replacement of the Russian Chairman. Italy, in coordination with UNESCO, provided the Ukrainian authorities with the technical expertise to prepare the candidature file of the Historic Centre of Odessa as a World Heritage Site. Italy is also providing support to monitor the damage to the Ukrainian Heritage, with a special focus on UNESCO World Heritage Sites and those on the Ukrainian Tentative List, as well as other sites of national interest.\n\nItaly voted the suspension of all activities run by the OECD with Russia and a consequent decision by the OECD Council was adopted. Moreover, Italy, as Chair of the 2022 OECD Ministerial Council Meeting, has proposed to discuss the crisis in Ukraine at the MCM in June, the most important yearly meeting of the Organization; the proposal was accepted.\n\nItaly supported the decision of the Executive Council of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) to convene an extraordinary session of the General Assembly; and on 27 April 2022 voted in favour of the suspension of the Russian Federation from membership in the Organization.\n\nItaly has also contributed to the approval of the regulation of the Council of the EU of 24 May 2022 allowing for temporary trade liberalisation and other trade concessions with regard to certain Ukrainian products, a measure which can significantly support Ukraine’s economy.\n\nItaly has so far approved 6 substantial military support packages to the defence of Ukraine, inclusive of both lethal and non-lethal equipment based on the needs of Ukraine’s Armed Forces.\n\nOn January 24, 2023, the Italian Parliament definitively approved the conversion into Law of the Law Decree no.185 of 2 December 2022, extending the authorization to supply further military equipment to Ukraine through the year 2023;\n\nItaly has so far provided a series of courses and specialised training activities on a bilateral basis in favour of the Ukrainian Armed Forces; other similar activities are ongoing and planned; On January 27, 2023, the Italian Minister of Defence and the French Minister of the Armed Forces announced the decision to donate jointly a medium-long range air defence and anti-missile system SAMP/T to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as well as to organize and conduct jointly the training of Ukrainian personnel on the same system;\n\nSince the very first meeting, the Italian Defence is part of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group – also called “Ramstein Group” – leaded by the U.S.A. in order to better coordinate and calibrate military aid to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In this regard, an Italian Liaison Officer is deployed within the Security Assistance Group – Ukraine at the U.S. European Command in order to have a better understanding of the priority needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Italian Defence is participating as observer in other international supporting initiatives as: the International Donors Coordination Centre, leaded by UK, and the Copenhagen – Ukraine Initiative.\n\nIn 2023, Italy ensures participation in the NATO Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), concerning about 570 units and a large number of assets in the air and maritime domains; Italy increased readiness of these Forces in accordance with NATO requirements. In 2022 the Italian contribution in the NATO VJTF was of 1350 troops and a large number of assets in the land, air and maritime domains.\n\nIn accordance with NATO requirements, Italy increased readiness of the Immediate Follow-on Forces Group (IFFG), the reinforcement units of the VJTF, in 2023 concerning about 420 units and a large number of assets in the air and maritime domains.

So far, the confirmed donations have been from Total Energies S.p.A., Chiesi Farmaceutica S.p.A., ENI S.p.A., Terna S.p.A. and SNAM S.p.A. The Presidency of the Council of Ministers is working with TERNA S.p.A. to organize a new important donation of energy and electrical equipment, which sees the involvement of 20 Italian companies. A first batch of materials has been accepted by Ukraine. The Civil Protection Department is coordinating the donation and the shipment.\n\nThanks to a 17 million USD contribution, in 2021 Italy ranked within the 10 main donors to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). For 2022, Italy has provided 17.5 million USD to the CERF, maintaining its position among the top 10 donors. The funds will be used to respond to the Ukraine emergency and to other humanitarian crises. For 2023, Italy has already pledged a contribution of 15 million Euros to the CERF.\n\nIn line with G7 commitments, Italy provided a 200 million Euro loan at privileged conditions to Ukraine’s budget and specifically to pay wages of employees in the education sector.\n\nIn the EU framework, Italy strongly and constantly supported the decision of the Commission to provide a first short-term relief package of 9 billion Euros in 2022, and actively supported the decision to provide a second MFA+ (Macro-financial Assistance+) short-term relief package, of 18 billion Euros, in 2023, to support Ukraine’s short-term financial needs. First instalment of the second MFA+ of 3 billion Euros has been recently disbursed.\n\nThe “Decreto-Legge Aiuti ter” foresees the participation of Italy to the new EU emergency macro-financial assistance to Ukraine, through the underwriting of a financial guarantee by the Ministry of Finance for a total amount of 700 million Euros for 2022.\n\nItaly has adopted a strategy to gradually replace the current 29 billion bcm yearly gas supply from Russia by increasing supplies (via both pipelines and LNG) from existing sources.\n\nIn the period January-November 2022 the reduction of the gas from Russia was of 52% compared to the same period of 2021.\n\nWe act in synergy with major national players to relaunch national gas production, maximize the capacity of existing re-gasifier plants and strengthen critical infrastructures, including through an additional 10 bcm from new offshore re-gasifier capacity.\n\nLevels of gas reserves in Italy are among the highest in the EU. Italy has a stock capacity exceeding 20% of its annual consumption, both in commercial storage and public strategic reserve.\n\nItaly strongly sustained the adoption of the REPowerEU plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels, and actively supported the emergency measures proposed by the EU to secure Europe’s energy supply.\n\nThe Italian Government was instrumental in the adoption of a cap mechanism on the price of gas in Europe, which will shield European households and businesses from price spikes.\n\nItaly was also among the main sponsors of the EU Energy Purchase Platform, the new voluntary coordination mechanism, bringing together the Commission and the Member States, that will support the purchase of gas and hydrogen for the Union, and which is also open for Ukraine and Moldova.\n\nOur diversification strategy is a common asset for the overall EU energy security.\n\nThe creation of the Southern Gas Corridor/TAP, from the Caspian Sea to Italy, has proven to be a far-sighted endeavor, given that it is the only energy project added in Europe in the last decade that does not rely on Russia, and has the potential to redouble its capacity in the mid-term.\n\nThe EU’s energy diversification also benefits from Italy’s pivotal role in the Mediterranean at large, including in the Levantine Basin as a founding member of the East Mediterranean Gas Forum [EMGF]. Now more than ever, Italy’s inclusive and cooperative approach will be instrumental to further unlock the Region’s energy potential, in order to increase our common energy security.\n\nItaly has participated to two releases of oil stocks decided by all the members of the International Energy Agency, to quell the high prices of crude oil and prevent any supply gaps. The first release at the beginning of March, for 60 million barrels and the second in April for additional 120 million barrels. In both occasions, Italy has released the sixth largest amount of reserves among participating countries.\n\nAs for assistance to Kyiv in the energy domain Italy, through its Transmission System Operator (TSO), has supported from the very beginning the Ukrainian Government’s request to synchronize its power grid to the European power grid, after its disconnection from the Russian one.\n\nItaly remains committed, both at a multilateral and EU level and with our partners and energy suppliers, to a substantial clean energy transition, which we view as the only solution to achieve lasting energy security and strategic autonomy.\n\nAfter the Russian aggression, the Italian Ministry for Universities and Research has urged higher education institutions to grant scholarships and adopt other initiatives to support Ukrainian students. A special fund of 500.000 euros has been set up to assist Ukrainian students in Italian higher education institutions and Ukrainian researchers and professors participating in projects in our universities and research centers. The Italian Parliament has subsequently raised the sum to one million Euros, expanding the criteria for eligibility. In order to allocate these resources, the Ministry for Universities and Research has published a public notice. This was followedby 42 applications for funding.\n\nItaly has set up an antenna of the Embassy in Lviv, an Italian lecturer works in that office with the task of collaborating with local universities and supporting their educational activity.\n\nA section entirely dedicated to the Ukrainian emergency (https://www.istruzione.it/emergenza-educativa-ucraina/) has been published on the Italian Education Ministry website.\n\nAfter the administrative assessment by the Commission established at the Ministry of Universities and Research, the list of the beneficiaries of the Fund has been published on the institutional website (https://www.mur.gov.it/sites/default/files/2022-12/Decreto%20Direttoriale%20n.%20463%20del%2017-11-2022.pdf). There are 32 Universities and Research Institutions hosting Ukrainian nationality students, visiting professors and PhD students.\n\nThe total allocated support of the Project is EUR 731.234,96. The payment is in progress.\n\nIn order to support educational continuity, the Ministry of Education has allocated an initial sum of 1.000.000 Euros, to be assigned to educational institutions for the inclusion of Ukrainian students in Italian Schools. Educational inclusion of Ukrainian students is ensured through the Regional School Offices of the Ministry of Education in cooperation with the local authorities (Regions, Prefectures, Civil Protection, Local Authorities, Health Services). Moreover, there is a constant coordination with the EU Council and Member States to give a coordinated response to the requests of the Ukrainian Ministry of Education conveyed also bilaterally at political level.\n\nA special regulation has been adopted so that Ukrainian students enrolled in the Italian Education System have not been obliged to take the first and second cycle final exams at the end of the academic year. At the same time, in cooperation with the Ukrainian Embassy, the Ministry of Education has organized dedicated locations in Milan, Rome and Naples, where Ukrainian students have taken the online exams to have access to Ukrainian Universities.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture of Italy has adopted a 2.000.000 euro program to support Ukrainian artists, offering them residencies and related activities. In addition, the Ministry of Culture is collaborating with Ukrainian authorities and international partners in order to safeguard endangered Ukrainian cultural heritage.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture of Italy has purchased and delivered, through the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM), ad hoc emergency material for the protection, conservation and transport of Ukrainian cultural heritage at risk.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture is enhancing cooperation between the Carabinieri Unit for the Protection of Cultural Heritage and Ukrainian relevant authorities with a view to provide further assistance in the protection of heritage at risk and to include Ukrainian cultural heritage in the Italian databases so it can be monitored and safeguarded against illicit trafficking.\n\nPartecipazione del Ministro Antonio Tajani al Consiglio Affari Esteri dell’Unione Europea\n\nIl Vice Presidente del Consiglio e Ministro degli Affari Esteri...\n\nUkraine – Ambassador Formosa visits the “Okhmatdyt” hospital together with AICS and Italian humanitarian workers\n\nThe Italian Ambassador to Ukraine Carlo Formosa visited the “Okhmatdyt”...\n\nHearing of Minister Antonio Tajani on developments in the Middle East and Ukraine\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Committees of the Chamber of Deputies and...\n\nSee all"
