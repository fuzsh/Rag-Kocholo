        "text": "Biden stresses importance of relationships with heads of state in securing the release\n\n“Yes,” was the answer President Joe Biden gave CNN’s MJ Lee when asked if he thought this moment would come.\n\nIn the moments after three freed Americans Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, and Alsu Kurmasheva arrived on US soil, Biden pointed to his relationships with heads of state that led to the complex negotiations to bring the wrongfully detained Americans home.\n\nOn relationships: Biden heralded his own efforts to rebuild alliances, a hallmark of his one-term presidency.\n\nOn families: The president told reporters he felt a “sense of relief for the families” and told the released Americans, “Welcome home,” as they arrived at Joint Base Andrews.\n\nOn Putin: Asked what his message was to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden offered one word:\n\nOn the safety of journalists: Pressed by Lee on whether reporters should feel afraid reporting abroad, Biden said: “It matters to be aware of what you’re going into and not to take undue chances – because I’m going to come get you.”\n\nAsked where it would rank among his achievements as president, he said:\n\nBiden and Harris arrive at Joint Base Andrews, where Gershkovich's WSJ colleagues are gathered\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s motorcade has arrived at Joint Base Andrews ahead of the arrival of the returning freed Americans Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan, and Alsu Kurmasheva.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who traveled separately, also arrived by motorcade late Thursday.\n\nAbout a dozen Wall Street Journal employees have gathered on the tarmac in solidarity with their returning colleague.\n\nUS special envoy spoke with Paul Whelan days before his release, source says\n\nSpecial Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens spoke with former US Marine Paul Whelan by phone on Friday, a source familiar said. Whelan was at his remote prison camp in Mordovia at the time of the call.\n\nCarstens was not able to tell him any details about the imminent swap, but was able to get a sense of how Whelan was feeling, which was optimistic, the source said."
