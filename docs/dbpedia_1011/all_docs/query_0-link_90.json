        "text": "NATO's Stoltenberg urges US to \"deliver what they promised\" and facilitate Ukraine with support package\n\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged the United States to “deliver what they promised,” by facilitating Ukraine with a support package to help in their defense against Russian aggression.\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Saturday, Stoltenberg said it was vital and urgent that the US decide on a package for Ukraine.\n\nStoltenberg reminded the audience in attendance that Ukraine is currently running low on resources, particularly ammunition.\n\n“At the beginning of the war in Ukraine, we depleted our stocks, but now they are running quite low. So now we are focusing extremely also very much on how to ramp up production,” Stoltenberg said.\n\nThe NATO secretary general went on to announce that “there are new factories being set up, production has increased, but there is urgent need to do more.”\n\nLast week, the US Senate passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine, but the bill faces an uncertain future in the US House of Representatives, where House Speaker Mike Johnson has signaled he will not bring it for a vote.\n\nThe Kremlin has never been richer — thanks to a US strategic partner\n\nRussia is entering its third year of war in Ukraine with an unprecedented amount of cash in government coffers, bolstered by a record $37 billion of crude oil sales to India last year, according to a new analysis, which concludes that some of the crude was refined by India and then exported to the United States as oil products worth more than $1 billion.\n\nThis flow of payments, ultimately to Moscow’s benefit, comes from India increasing its purchases of Russian crude by over 13 times its pre-war amounts, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air analysis, exclusively shared with CNN. It amounts to US strategic partner New Delhi stepping in to replace crude purchases by Western buyers, reduced by sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the analysis said.\n\nNot sanctioned: While Russian crude sales to India are not subject to sanctions and are entirely legitimate, an examination of shipping routes by experts suggests this huge volume of shipments might involve the so-called “shadow fleet” of crude tankers, specially created by Moscow to try to disguise who it is trading with and how, and maximize the Kremlin’s profits.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nRussia presses its advantage on a vulnerable Ukraine\n\nThe Russian flag has been raised in several parts of Avdiivka in the Donetsk region, hours after Ukrainian forces beat a hasty retreat from the ruins of the eastern town they’ve been defending for a decade.\n\nBut Ukraine’s army is under pressure at several other points along the front line that meanders for about 1,000 kilometers from the border with Russia in the north to the Black Sea.\n\nThe Russians launched a determined drive to seize Avdiivka in October. But they are also on the attack near Bakhmut and Mariinka (also in Donetsk) and toward Kupiansk in the north.\n\nOn Ukraine’s southern front, in Zaporizhzhia, Russian and Ukrainian sources speak of a massive Russian build-up in the area where Kyiv tried to launch its counteroffensive last summer. According to some analysts, a force of 50,000 men has been assembled.\n\nWindow of vulnerability: The Russian military may have sensed a window of vulnerability in its adversary. Ukraine’s better units are exhausted after two years of combat; there is a new commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi; and Ukrainian troops are short of shells and vulnerable to relentless airstrikes.\n\nWhile the goal of President Volodymyr Zelensky and the armed forces is to recover all illegally occupied territory, the Ukrainians are now struggling to prevent the Russians from adding to the approximately 18% of Ukrainian territory they already hold.\n\nRemember: President Vladimir Putin’s declared aim is to seize all of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, but few believe he will stop there if there are further opportunities.\n\nUkrainian soldiers will soon be able to have children from beyond the grave\n\nThe Ukrainian parliament passed legislation in February to allow and fund the use of soldiers’ frozen sperm in case of their death.\n\nOnce President Volodymyr Zelensky signs the bill into law, it will, for the first time, allow the widows of Ukrainian soldiers to use their dead partners’ reproductive cells — both sperm and eggs — to have children.\n\nIt will also enable wounded soldiers to use their preserved reproductive cells to have children where their injuries would normally make that impossible.\n\nAdditionally, the state will pay to store these frozen cells for three years after a male or female soldier’s death, with clauses specifically recognizing the deceased biological parent on the child’s birth certificate. Currently, the government will pay for the initial freezing of reproductive cells.\n\nCryopreservation has been an “urgent but difficult issue,” MP Olena Shulyak, co-author of the bill, said in a post on Telegram.\n\nIt’s a law that will likely benefit many.\n\nUkraine’s battlefield losses are a closely guarded secret, but US officials estimate about 70,000 soldiers have been killed and nearly twice that number wounded.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nRussia raises flag in Avdiivka as Navalny’s family seeks answers. Here are the latest developments\n\nRussian troops have raised their country’s flag in the ruined town of Avdiivka in the Donetsk region after Ukrainian forces retreated.\n\nUkraine withdrew from the town, which it had been defending for a decade, months after Russia renewed efforts to seize it and tolerated devastating losses to do so.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that seven Russians were killed for every Ukrainian soldier lost.\n\nDespite the high casualty rates, Russia is pressuring Ukrainian defenses at several other points along the 1,000-kilometer frontline.\n\nThe seizure of Avdiivka demonstrates Russia’s growing manpower advantage in what is becoming a war of attrition.\n\nHere are the latest developments in the region:\n\nNavalny’s body: The family of the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny – who died last week in a Siberian prison – has been denied access to the morgue where his body is thought to be held. The Kremlin said it is “not involved” in returning Navalny’s body to his family, but that an investigation into the circumstances of his death is underway.\n\nMoscow tributes: Navalny’s death has been met with an outpouring of grief across the world. In Russia, where the smallest acts of political dissent carry great risk, hundreds have reportedly been detained as tributes were held.\n\nSecurity conference: The news of Navalny’s death and Ukraine’s withdrawal from Avdiivka muted the mood of this year’s Munich Security Conference, as talks between Western leaders were dominated by the need to provide more aid to Ukraine and bolster European security.\n\nCongressional delays: US President Joe Biden, in a call with Zelensky, said the withdrawal from Avdiivka was a result of Congress’s inability to pass further aid for Ukraine’s effort to fend off Russia’s invasion.\n\nSecond anniversary: As the anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, Russia continues to suffer devastating losses – both to troops and equipment. Ukraine has faced growing ammunition constraints as Western arms supplies slowed. The year ahead looks uncertain, with Ukraine’s better units exhausted after two years of combat and Oleksandr Syrskyi now at the helm as Ukraine’s commander-in-chief."
