        "text": "A Gentleman In Moscow\n\nAmor Towles\n\nWindmill\n\n2016, 462p\n\nRead from my husband’s TBR\n\nBlurb {from the publisher/Goodreads.com}: On 21 June 1922 Count Alexander Rostov – recipient of the Order of Saint Andrew, member of the Jockey Club, Master of the Hunt – is escorted out of the Kremlin, across Red Square and through the elegant revolving doors of the Hotel Metropol.\n\nBut instead of being taken to his usual suite, he is led to an attic room with a window the size of a chessboard. Deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, the Count has been sentenced to house arrest indefinitely.\n\nWhile Russia undergoes decades of tumultuous upheaval, the Count, stripped of the trappings that defined his life, is forced to question what makes us who we are. And with the assistance of a glamorous actress, a cantankerous chef and a very serious child, Rostov unexpectedly discovers a new understanding of both pleasure and purpose.\n\nThe first prompt I pulled from my TBR Jar this year was ‘A book set in or featuring Russia’ which gave me some pause because I wasn’t sure I had anything set in Russia. But then I remembered that my husband was given a copy of this book for his birthday last year and it was perfect. I have heard really good things about this author so I was keen to read it.\n\nA Gentleman In Moscow begins in early 1920s Russia, in the wake of the first world war and the overthrowing of the Royal family and rise of the Bolsheviks. Count Alexander Rostov was brought up in wealth and privilege and in 1922 he’s hauled before a Bolshevik court and questioned about a poem published under his name. He’s deemed to be an “unrepentant” aristocrat but for reasons it’s determined he should not be killed. Instead he’ll be confined for the term of his life to the Hotel Metropol in Moscow, where he was currently living before being hauled in and questioned. But not in the opulent, multi-room suite he had been occupying. Instead he’s removed to the 6th floor and the former servants quarters, a tiny room with a tiny window. He’s only allowed to take some of his belongings, the rest are put in storage in the basement of the hotel but the Count does the best he can to make his new lodgings comfortable.\n\nHe must stay within the confines of the hotel – he’s assured he’ll be shot if he steps foot outside of it. Apart from that, his life honestly….continues on much as it had before the judgement was passed. He is delivered the same breakfast each day, he takes his other meals in one of the hotel dining facilities. He drinks in the bar, he chats to the staff, he keeps a weekly hair appointment and takes his clothes for mending to the hotel seamstress. Meeting a 9yo named Nina who is also staying in the hotel opens his eyes to a whole new world as Nina (who for reasons unknown is in possession of a master key) takes him places he’s never seen inside the hotel.\n\nOrphaned as a child, the Count’s guardian was a Grand Duke and he and his sister were also raised by their grandmother. He often reminisces on times gone by, particularly those featuring his sister Helena. In an early part of the book, it’s made clear that the Count intends to “depart this world” on a certain date, however he’s interrupted whilst attempting to do so and his life takes another course. It changes again when years into the future, the Count has a young child left in her care. It’s supposed to be temporary but I feel like many people probably disappeared in Russia during this time and it soon becomes obvious that the Count will be raising this child, along with the help of several of the hotel’s key staff.\n\nI really enjoyed this. It did take me a while to get into it – the first 100p I felt like I was learning a lot about the time and the setting and the mannerisms of various people but after that, I got into the groove. I felt like it was very charming, it had this grand old hotel as pretty much the only setting. A real homage to a different time, when I guess as wealthy people, taking such a suite kind of permanently, would not have been so unusual. Dining out every single meal. Having anything you could want or need at your beck and call. The Count is incredibly wealthy, he obviously has to be in order to have this lifestyle and he’s lived his life a certain way up until now and he’s not really going to let a little thing like confinement to the attic stop him. He dresses each day, keeps his weekly hair appointments, he’s a gentleman. He likes things to be a certain way, he appreciates good service and those that know how to make people feel taken care of. When one of the restaurants in the hotel hires a new waiter who doesn’t live up to the Counts high standards, he’s not afraid to let him know. This waiter ends up being a ‘friend’ of the Party and so continues to progress through the ranks, much to the Count’s chagrin. He and several of the others enjoy thwarting this man or getting around his rules or regulations, often in humorous fashion.\n\nDespite his privileged upbringing, the Count isn’t a snob and cultivates a close group within the hotel that’s almost like a family, especially after it becomes clear that he’ll be raising Sofia, the young girl, for the long term. He knows he’ll need help (by now the Count also has his own role within the hotel) in order to continue to fulfil his duties and Sofia will also need people in her life that are not him. She’ll need to be educated, she’ll need women she can talk to. The Count regularly finds himself outplayed or confounded by Sofia, and it’s clear when he takes custody of her that he’s deeply out of his depth and doesn’t know what to do with a small child. A bachelor probably in his forties…? ish? when she comes to live at the hotel, the Count has to adjust and learn as he goes along.\n\nI just found myself deeply invested in this and all of the characters. I loved the insular setting, this grand old hotel of a bygone era. And even though you don’t get any of the surrounding areas as such, as the Count can’t leave and walk around the streets of Moscow, you get a more subtle indication of the country’s upheaval and change, the rise of the Party and the shifting landscape.\n\nI’ll definitely be reading more of Amor Towles in the future. I really enjoyed the way he told the story.\n\n8/10\n\nBook #15 of 2024\n\nThis is the 3rd book read that counts to my Historical Fiction Reading Challenge for 2024, hosted by Marg @ The Intrepid Reader.\n\nI also put A Gentleman In Moscow on my 24 in 2024 books I wanted to read and it’s also the 3rd book I’ve read from this challenge so far. I’m off to a flying start in this challenge!\n\nPosted in Uncategorized"
