        "text": "Situated just south of the Moskva River in one of Moscow's most rapidly developing commercial districts, the Aquamarine Hotel is a modern deluxe property opened at the start of 2010, and designed to appeal to business travelers with a combination of stylish guest rooms and suites, small but well-equipped meeting venues, and a full range of business and leisure services including business lounge, fitness centre and Spa. Just under ten minutes' walk from the metro, the hotel is also within walking distance of Red Square and the Kremlin. »»»\n\nAmong Moscow's most luxurious hotels, the Lotte Hotel Moscow is an exceptional 5-star business hotel. Not only does the Lotte Hotel offer sumptuously fitted and extremely spacious guest rooms, it also boasts a superb range of facilities including a state-of-the-art business center offering comprehensive technical amenities and full secretarial support. Meeting and conferencing facilities are also extensive and first-class, and the hotel's location on the Garden Ring is equally convenient for the downtown and for major business destinations such as the Moscow International Business Center. »»»\n\nThis mid-size, mid-range hotel in the north of Moscow has won a solid reputation as a value-for-money option for business travelers. A short walk from the metro and around 30 minutes door-to-door from Red Square and the Kremlin, the Maxima Irbis offers comfortable, modern 3-star accommodation and a superior range of business services, including 24-hour business center and adaptable meeting space. Friendly, English-speaking staff and comparatively low rates add to the hotel's attractions, while the one disadvantage is that the secluded Maxima Irbis is not easy to find on arrival. »»»\n\nBusiness travelers looking to save money on trips to Moscow are well advised to check out the Maxima Slavia Hotel and its sister properties, the Maxima Irbis and the Maxima Zarya. All three hotels offer comfortable, modern accommodation with fresh, colorful interiors, plus a wide range of business services, including well designed conference space, full office support, and high-speed internet access in room. Although the Maxima Slavia is a fair distance from the downtown, it does have reasonably quick access to the metro. »»»"
