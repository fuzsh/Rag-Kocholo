        "text": "It was one of the great mysteries of the 20th century. In the early hours of July 17 1918 a Bolshevik firing squad killed Russia's last tsar, Nicholas II, together with his wife, four young daughters and son. The Romanov family were dug up in 1991, formally identified using DNA samples, and reburied in a St Petersburg cathedral.\n\nBut two of the Romanovs were never found. The bodies of the tsar's heir, Prince Alexei, and his sister Princess Maria were missing. Archive evidence suggested the pair had been buried away from the others. But repeated digs at the leafy spot on the outskirts of Yekaterinburg in southern Russia, where the remains of the rest of the family were found, failed to reveal a resting place.\n\nThat was until last month when Sergei Plotnikov, a 46-year-old builder, stumbled on a small hollow covered with nettles. Mr Plotnikov was part of a team from an amateur history group who spent free summer weekends looking for the lost Romanovs. Mr Plotnikov said he was searching in the clearing surrounded by silver birch trees when his prodder hit something hard.\n\n\"There was a crunching sound,\" he said yesterday.\" This means you've hit coal or bone. My friend Leonid and I started to dig. We found several bone fragments. The first was a piece of pelvis. We then discovered a fragment of skull. It had clearly come from a child. We shouted over to the archaeologists. They began an expert search. My heart leaped with joy. I knew immediately that this was the kind of thing that happens only once in a lifetime. I also felt satisfied. I knew the Romanov children would finally be united with the rest of their family.\"\n\nMr Plotnikov said the evidence he discovered showed that the two missing Romanovs had suffered the same fate as their siblings and murdered parents.\n\n\"It was clear they didn't die peacefully. Their remains were very damaged. You could see that they had been covered in acid and burned with flames. What we dug up was in a very bad state. We didn't find any bullet holes. But it was clear from the bones that some kind of kerosene had been poured over them.\"\n\nYesterday Russian archaeologists confirmed they had discovered the remains of a 10-13 year old boy and an 18-23 year old woman - presumed to be Prince Alexei and Grand Duchess Maria. The wooded site, six miles north of Yekaterinburg, is not far from the original spot where the other Romanovs were secretly discovered in 1976 and finally dug up in 1991 after the collapse of communism.\n\nThere was little doubt that the remains were those of the Romanov children, Sergei Pogorelov, deputy director of the Sverdlovsk region's archaeological institute, said. As well as bone fragments, his team found pieces of Japanese ceramic bottles - used to carry sulphuric acid poured on the Romanovs' corpses. They also recovered seven teeth, three bullets of various calibres, a tantalising fragment of a dress, and wire from a wooden box.\n\n\"Archaeologists surmise that they are the remains of Prince Alexei and Grand Duchess Maria,\" Mr Pogorelov told a press conference yesterday. Forensic scientists in Yekaterinburg said they were studying 44 different bone fragments, ranging in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres. DNA tests were likely to confirm their origins, officials said.\n\nThere are lingering questions, however, as to why this latest dig apparently succeeded when numerous others had failed. \"We got lucky,\" Mr Plotnikov said. In fact, another team had dug at the same spot.\n\n\"Archaeologists excavated practically the whole site in the 1990s but then ran out of money,\" Maria Sosnina, a journalist with the local Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, said. \"They had to stop. They packed up, leaving behind an 8-metre- square area of ground. And that is exactly the place where they [the new team] found them. The area is the size of a football field. It's an ordinary looking place not far from the main road.\"\n\nThe discovery appears to fill in the last chapter of the doomed Romanovs. But Russia's orthodox church, which refused to accept that the previous remains were those of the Romanovs, immediately cast doubt on the latest find. \"I would like to hope that the examination will be more thorough and detailed than the examination of the so-called Yekaterinburg remains,\" Bishop Mark of Yegorvevsk, deputy head of the Moscow patriarch's external relations branch, said.\n\nRelatives of the Romanovs also said it was too early to draw firm conclusions. \"It is necessary to treat these findings very cautiously,\" Ivan Artseshchevsky told Russia's NTV, citing the controversy over the bones identified as those of the tsar and others killed. Tiny statistical margins of error in identification had sparked \"huge doubts and many disputes\".\n\nRussia's media were in no doubt yesterday. The newspaper Izvestiya published a haunting black and white photo of the Romanovs, taken in 1913, on its front page. Inside it ran more photos of 13-year-old Prince Alexei rowing with his sister on a lake, and posing for the camera in a sailor suit, his expression sombre.\n\nMr Plotnikov believes Russia's turbulent history has achieved a rare moment of closure. \"This is a big thing,\" he said. \"It's a really important discovery.\"\n\nBackstory"
