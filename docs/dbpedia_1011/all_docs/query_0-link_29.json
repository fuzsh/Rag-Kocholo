        "text": "Russia’s affluent, expansive capital has plenty to offer city breakers. Will Gray on a typical tourist day in Moscow\n\nMoscow is at the heart of Russia’s past and future – its communist memories are being replaced by glitz, glamour and affluence. The city’s history and sheer size mean there is plenty to attract tourists, from its architecture to its people and nightlife.\n\nYou can flag down almost any car on the road and, if it is going your way, it will become a taxi. Alternatively, use the metro: it’s cheap and efficient and its mosaic-lined, candelabra-filled stations, such as the one at Komsomolskaya, are an attraction in their own right.\n\nIn 24 hours you can tour the city’s highlights, then party on into the night. Here’s how:\n\n8.30am: Breakfast coffee at the Ritz-Carlton\n\nTake breakfast or a coffee at the Ritz-Carlton, in a fantastic location just off Red Square. Opened last July, it is described as the most luxurious and prestigious hotel in Moscow and offers 360-degree views of the city’s landmarks from the rooftop terrace.\n\n9:30am: Red Square and the Kremlin\n\nThe obvious first stop for any visitor, Red Square is an expanse of space bordered by the beautiful St Basil’s Cathedral, with its iconic sweetshop style domes; the GUM State Department store – Russia’s version of Harrods; and the Kremlin, the famous seat of Russian rule.\n\nThe latter, open to tourists every day except Thursday, houses a spectacular complex of palaces, cathedrals and churches and its armoury houses carriages, thrones and garments from the Russian tsars, as well as an amazing collection of Fabergé eggs and Lenin’s tomb.\n\nFrom here, stroll down to Varvarka Street to see churches and houses from the 15th to 17th centuries and then move on to Lubyanka Square, where you will find the former KGB building.\n\nMidday: Take a drive around the inner city\n\nPick up a ‘cab’ and head past Pushkin Square to Pashkov House, a spectacular white-pillared building that is now home to the Russian State Library.\n\nTake a route via the Bolshoi Theatre to see its pale pink facade and end your mini road trip at Bolotnaya Square, a former public execution site that is now a pleasant rest spot. If you have time – and make sure you do – head along the canal to the Tretyakov art gallery.\n\n2:30pm: Visit one of Stalin’s ‘Seven Sisters’\n\nMake your way to the Moscow State University building at Sparrow Hills, one of the awesome ‘Seven Sisters’ skyscrapers created by Stalin between 1947 and 1953.\n\nThe distinctive buildings with their intricate exteriors and large spires can be seen throughout the city. If you have time, take a ride up to the observation point on the Vorobyovy Gory for a great view.\n\n4pm: Ride the river\n\nEnd a busy touring day with a cruise on the river. Trips start near the university building and head back past the vast greenery of Gorky Park and the space shuttle to the Novospassky monastery, offering a panoramic view of the Kremlin on the way.\n\n5:30pm: Early evening drinks at the Red Bar\n\nHead up to the 27th floor Red Bar before the sun goes down to watch the city turn from day to night, while sipping a strong Russian vodka and listening to piano tunes in the cool lounge bar. Expect to spend a few roubles but it’s worth it for the views from the toilets alone.\n\n7:30pm Red Square at night, then dinner by the river or Old Arabat\n\nIf there is one attraction in Moscow worth seeing twice, it is Red Square. Head there again when it’s dark to see the evening glow on St Barts and the copycat Harrods lights on the GUM department store. Once you have absorbed the atmosphere, go to the river and board one of the floating restaurants.\n\nOld Arabat, once home to Ivan the Terrible’s secret police, can offer an alternative range of dining options. It can also be rewarding to stroll and stumble upon a unique dining experience in the many restaurants dotted around the city.\n\n11pm: Clubbing in a city that never sleeps\n\nWhen the bars start to close it’s time to head to the clubs. Propaganda, with its brick walls, ceiling pipes and rough wood furniture, has an underground feel but locals prefer to see top visiting bands or DJs at Opera or Fabrique, near the city centre, or Neo, further out of town.\n\nDyagelev was popular before it burnt down in February and new favourite Kak Na Kanarakh was quickly closed due to lack of permits. With the ‘in’ bars changing often, it’s worth asking a local to find out what the pick of the week is.\n\nSample product"
