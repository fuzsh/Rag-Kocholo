        "text": "It’s not the prettiest square in the Russian capital. It's certainly no match for Red Square, with the breathtaking onion domes of St Basil’s Cathedral and the Kremlin.\n\nEurasia Square is built beside the bustling \"Kyiv Railway Station\" and a hotel, where the BBC’s Moscow Office was once located. There’s a fountain and an unusual composition created by a Belgian sculptor entitled The Abduction of Europa.\n\nI remember when this square was constructed just over 20 years ago. It was built as a symbol of unity on the continent of Europe. There were once dozens of flags of different European countries flying here.\n\nThey were removed last year, and now the name’s gone too.\n\nGoodbye Europe; hello Eurasia.\n\nBut what exactly is Eurasia?\n\nDifferent countries have different concepts of Eurasia. President Vladimir Putin officially terms Russia a Eurasian power. He uses the word to mean Russia is geographically in Europe and Asia but civilisationally distinct from both.\n\nEurope Square's commemorative plaque still stands. It reads:\n\n“As a token of stronger friendship and unity between the European countries, the government of Moscow has decided to create the ensemble of the Square of Europe in the Russian capital.”\n\nThe reality is that Russia’s war in Ukraine and Western sanctions have put enormous strain on relations between Moscow and Europe. The Russian authorities talk constantly now of the need to tilt east and look towards China, North Korea, Asia as a whole.\n\nEurope isn’t just out of fashion - it is portrayed by the Russian authorities as the enemy.\n\nIt’s not the first time that the Moscow authorities have played politics with street names after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn June 2022 the street where the US embassy is located was renamed “Donetsk People’s Republic Square,” a reference to the self-proclaimed breakaway region of Ukraine, which Russia later claimed to have annexed.\n\nIn similar fashion, the following month the area around the British embassy became “Luhansk People’s Republic Square\".\n\nBack on (former) Europe Square, what do passers-by make of the change to Eurasia?\n\n“It’s the right decision,” Olga tells me. “We’re not friends with Europe right now. I don’t want to be in Europe.”\n\n“Eurasia is good,” says Anna. “Russia borders Europe and Asia. I was born in Kazakhstan, so this is fine with me.”\n\n“Europe has different standards now,” Pasha tells me. “They think in a different way. We’re gradually splitting away.”\n\nBut Yevgeniya is disappointed. She sees the name change as \"a sign of conflict between different countries.\"\n\n\"It’s so sad,\" she adds.\n\nBut at the end of the day, does a name really matter?\n\nFollowing the 1917 Russian Revolution so many streets and squares in Russia were renamed to feature the word \"communism\". Did it help the Soviet Union build communism? Not in the slightest.\n\nThe decision to ditch the word Europe from a square doesn’t mean that Russia won’t one day, once again, look West."
