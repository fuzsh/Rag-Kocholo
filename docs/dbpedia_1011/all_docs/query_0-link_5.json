        "text": "They were said to be keeping a low profile â almost invisible. But, with the imposing Mistral-class helicopter carrier the Vladivostok in the background, Russian sailors can be seen out in force in the port of Saint-Nazaire on Franceâs west coast. Dressed in navy blue uniforms, dozens of young men with cropped hair bask in the sun. Some allow themselves a short nap while others take the opportunity to make a phone call home â a home thousands of miles from the shipyards on the Atlantic coast where the two Mistral warships destined for Russia are being built.\n\nThe crisis currently tearing apart eastern Ukraine and the dire warnings of a new Cold War seem far away. The August sun warms the body and only a few ripples of discontent reach the peaceful shores of Saint-Nazaire.\n\nâWeâve already had the chance to visit the town and we were given a warm welcome. I heard talk of a protest against the sale of the Mistrals but everything has been fine for us,â a young Russian sailor tells Elena Gabrielian, a journalist on the Russian desk of FRANCE 24âs sister radio station RFI, in a low voice before walking off.\n\nThe sailors, who have been ordered not to speak to the press, are not very talkative. Local traders confirm the strict discretion of the Russians, who come to stroll in groups of five or six along Saint-Nazaireâs beach front while on evening leave."
