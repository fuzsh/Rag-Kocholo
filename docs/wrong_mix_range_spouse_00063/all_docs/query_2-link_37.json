        "text": "Marissa has been wonderful to work with!!! As first time buyers we didn’t know what to expect or how things worked. She listened to what we wanted and outlined the entire home buying process for us down to the last detail. She exemplifies professionalism staying right on top of things and working to get you what you want. I highly recommend her to anyone who’s looking for a great real estate agent!!!\n\nMarissa Drew, Realtor from The Gove Group was our agent and she was so nice and very informative explaining/answering any questions we had. Mike & I highly recommend Marissa with The Gove Group. She is extremely professional and very pleasant to work with. We have had a wonderful experience.\n\nIt was a great experience working with Marissa on the sale of our condo. Working with a top-selling real estate agent made it so easy. The process from beginning to end was awesome. She got to work right away and was very confident in the listing process. Marissa was very friendly, professional, and make us feel at ease. Our home sold very quickly and she did it all! I would highly recommend Marissa.\n\nWe were very lucky to meet Marissa at a Canterbury Commons open house. She has a great personality and positive attitude. She makes buying and selling simple and stressless.\n\nShe sold our house in Stratham in less then a week for $50k over asking. We then purchased our new home at Canterbury Commons from her. She walked us through everything from A-Z, including every selection of counters, cabinets, flooring, etc. If you need to buy or sell or both, you will be very happy having Marissa as your agent\n\nMarissa did an outstanding job assisting us with the purchase of a new construction home. She was very professional and responded quickly to any questions we had. We highly recommend her. She is an experienced realtor who is very knowledgeable of the industry and we enjoyed working with her.\n\nMarissa's kindness and patience throughout the selling and buying process made it stress free for us. She was always available to answer our many questions and we are grateful. We are \"home\" and beginning a new adventure!\n\nFrom the first OPEN HOUSE to the final closing, it was great to work with Marissa on the purchase of our new home. What we most appreciated was her ability to respond quickly to our questions and concerns. We also liked that she would send us photos onthe progress of the home building process.\n\nMarissa was outstanding from beginning to end of Our move. Always helpful, answering questions and giving excellent options. Highly recommend Her for any real estate journeys. She is excellent at Her job and represents The Gove Group in a highly professional manner.\n\nCopyright 2024 New England Real Estate Network, Inc. All rights reserved.
