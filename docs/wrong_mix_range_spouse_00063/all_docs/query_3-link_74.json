        "text": "Morgan Ortagus, the American television commentator and political advisor, was raised alongside three siblings, including her twin sister, Megan Ortagus.\n\nMorgan’s twin, Megan Ortagus Ahmed, is an experienced senior intelligence officer who has previously briefed cabinet officials in the U.S. President’s administration.\n\nMegan is married and lives in New York City, where she proudly serves as a host mother to a teenage Afghan refugee. She has not revealed the name of her husband.\n\nMoreover, the twins have a younger sister, Marissa, who is 34 years old and a licensed social worker at a prominent hospital. Marissa got married to her husband, Jamie in September 2022.\n\nThe three sisters, Morgan, Megan, and Marissa, are the daughters of parents Ronald E. Ortagus and Denise C. Ortagus.\n\nMegan Ortagus, Transitioning from Government Service to Empowering Afghan Futures!\n\nMorgan Ortagus and her twin, Megan, were born on July 10, 1982, in Auburndale, Florida. However, unlike Morgan, who is frequently in public, Megan prefers to keep her life private.\n\nMegan is a talented woman who graduated with top honors from Johns Hopkins University in May 2014, earning a Master of Arts in Global Security Studies.\n\nShe worked as a government officer for over a decade, from January 2011 to December 2022, in the United States Federal Government.\n\nHowever, before her government service, Megan worked for two years as a communications director at the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nFollowing extensive experience in government service, Megan co-founded and currently serves as the president of Uplifting Afghan Girls (UAG), an NGO launched in May 2023.\n\nThis non-profit organization collaborates with a charity in Afghanistan to identify exceptional young women and provide them with the incredible opportunity to study in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, she has extensive experience as a senior intelligence officer, addressing critical global issues in regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nThe Ortagus twins exemplify a supportive sibling relationship, with Megan as a pillar of support behind her sister’s public and professional aspirations.\n\nAdditional Information"
