Beyond grateful to each and every member of our dazzling team.\n\n“And a heartfelt thank you to the people who tuned in each week to go on this ride with us. We did it all for you. #seasonsix #michaelweatherly #nicholemillard #kathrynprice #dreamsdocometrue #grateful”\n\nThen in May 2021, showrunner Glenn Gordon Caron and star Freddy Rodriguez left the show after an investigation about inappropriate behaviour at the workplace.\n\nWith the show’s final season expected to continue this month, fans will soon find out how things will end for Jason and Marissa.\n\nDuring episode 10, there was tons of speculation she would be leaving TAC after she spent the entire episode arguing with Jason.\n\nThis even got so bad, she had a conversation with his wife to see if there was anything she could do to fix their relationship.\n\nAlthough Bull is coming to an end, fans will have to stay tuned to see if Marissa will smooth things out with Jason.\n\nBull season six continues Thursday on CBS."
