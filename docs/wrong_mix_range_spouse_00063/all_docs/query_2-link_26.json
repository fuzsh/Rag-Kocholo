        "text": "Marissa & Keith met at UNH at the end of Marissa's senior year. Marissa was out with some friends at Scorpions Bar & Grill (one of two bars that students go to in Durham). Keith had spent the day golfing in nearby Portsmouth, New Hampshire with some other UNH buddies and after golfing they decided to hit the town at their alma mater rather than head back to Boston for the night. Keith was wearing a white button down and stood out like a sore thumb amongst the sea of college boys in flannels and Boston sports teeshirts. Keith claims that Marissa approached him first. He bought her a (dollar) drink and they chatted throughout the night. At the end of the night they exchanged numbers. About a month later after Marissa had graduated, Keith asked her out to dinner in Boston. They went on a double date at the Beehive with Keith's good friend Maximillion MacArthur Ricciuti. It's amazing that Marissa stuck around after a double date that involved Max (just kidding, we love you Max) but she's sure glad she did!\n\nKeith told Marissa a couple weeks in advance that his boss and her husband invited them out for dinner. Marissa was flattered to be invited to dinner with them. Fast forward to Thursday, October 3rd. Keith called Marissa at work in the afternoon reminding her how important it was to be on time for dinner. When the time rolled around, Marissa left work and walked down to the Seaport. Keith told Marissa his boss was going to meet them at the restaurant and for her to meet him at The Barking Crab. When Marissa got to Barking Crab Keith was waiting there with a big smile and they quickly began walking down the Boston Harbor walk. Keith suddenly stopped and pulled Marissa aside. He then began a whirlwind of heartfelt words and was down on one knee before Marissa could process what was happening. After the best surprise of her life, Marissa walked with Keith to Del Friscos Steakhouse where Keith had made their dinner reservation. Their table by the window was covered with roses and champagne and Marissa was so excited she could barely drink her martini. After dinner, they decided to head back to the North End for some drinks and dessert. Marissa started calling her friends on the car ride over and was surprised to find that some of them weren't answering. It turns out that Marissa & Keith's friends were all waiting at Bacco in the North End where Keith pulled off another amazing surprise!"
