        "text": "I was 16 when Adam visited my church for the first time. I was playing “Eve” in a play that day. From the audience, he saw me and turned to his friend and said, “I’m going to marry her.” After service, we met in person, and I fell in love right back.\n\nAt 17, Adam graduated from high school and joined the Army. When he left for basic training, I told him I loved him and I would wait for him. A few short weeks later, the 9/11 terrorist attacks happened. On Valentine’s Day 2003, he was deployed to Iraq for a year and we wrote letters back and forth the entire time. This was before Facebook or Skype, so we still have boxes of our handwritten letters, and I like to go through them and see how our love grew through those years. I prayed for him and thought about him all the time. He came home safe and we attended college together.\n\nA few years later, Adam took me on a date to what was then called Bonfante Gardens. We sat by the pond and he pointed up to the sky. A plane flew over us and attached to it was a banner that said, “Marissa, Will You Marry Me?” He got down on one knee, said he loved me and wanted to spend his life with me, and gave me a beautiful ring. Of course, I said yes!\n\nOn the Fourth of July 2008, we were married before our family and friends in Creekside Terrace at Gilroy Gardens. It was the most wonderful day of my life, and we have beautiful photos of us on the rides, in the gardens and having a great time at one of our favorite places with those we love.\n\nWe were both born and raised in San Jose, but recently bought our first home and moved to Gilroy. We love this town and cannot wait to be blessed with children so we can raise them here. We grew up together and plan to grow old together and enjoy a lifetime of adventures.\n\nI love you Adam, and am thankful that I get to spend all my life by your side."
