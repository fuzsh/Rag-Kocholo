        "text": "Marissa's love for animals began at a very early age. \"There hasn’t been a time in my life when pets weren’t a part of it. Pets are my passion! I am a proud pet mamma 3 dogs, Ellie, Samantha and Rocky. They are my fur kids and have me wrapped around their little paws.\"\n\nOver the years, friends and family have entrusted their precious pets in her care because they trusted her abilities and knew that she would treat their pets as you would your own. Spending her days with cats and dogs is the ultimate job. Kind of hard to even call it a “job.” Who can resist waggs and purrs, wet kisses and lap naps? Pet sitting and dog walking is Marissa's profession, livelihood and her business.\n\nMarissa began fostering at a young age. After over 30 dogs that now have loving, forever homes, and a new leash on life, she explained that fostering those dogs was the most life-fulfilling thing she's ever done. \"I watched them come into rescue sad, lost, hurting and just wanting to be loved. With loving care and patience they blossomed, regaining faith in their human counterparts.\n\nAs a pet lover myself I understand the difficulty of finding someone who will care for your pets and respect your home. My clients can rest assure that they will be provided the highest degree of professionalism and heartfelt pet care for their four-legged family members. All pets are unique and deserve undivided attention,\" said Marissa.\n\nMarissa has many references who will gladly speak of her compassion and abilities to care for animals, her dedication and her high-moral values. I provide the utmost quality pet care for responsible pet parents. If you have a bored pooch and need daily dog walks, give Pampered Pups by Marissa a call. When you’re ready to go on vacation, she will not only treat your pets like her own, but I will closely monitor your home and property.\n\nHi, my name is Dave. I have been house & petsitting for over 25 years. I have a background in the insurance and medical fields, but a lifelong love for animals of all kinds, I am an active foster parent and on the Board of Directors with Home at Last Dog Rescue. One of the most exciting things I've done recently was fostered a pregnant 2 year old Shepard, she had 11 puppies that I loved & cared for from birth to 8 weeks. Not only did i see them grow from birth but I was there to care for them through it all, late night feedings & sleepless nights. They all went to fabulous homes and I keep in contact with all the adoptive families.\n\nHi! My name is Gabby, I’ve been caring for animals in some way or another for as long as I can remember, scooping up injured birds, skunks, groundhogs, mice, and squirrels and taking them to wildlife centers. My grandmother gifted me my first pet, a kitten, when I was 5 years old and I’ve been hooked ever since! The love of my life is my pitbull named Ziggy who enjoys my hobbies with me by modeling for my pet photography and illustrations. Our favorite thing to do together is hike in the woods and take in the scenery. I have 7 years of experience caring for a range of dogs from German shepherds and boxers to chihuahuas and mini doodles, as well as cats and small animals. I love to see every animal’s individual personality shine the more I get to know them! I look forward to meeting your pets, and making sure all their needs are met! :)\n\nHello there! My name is Natalie. I have been dog sitting for at least 4 years now. Meanwhile, I have my hands full at home with my own fur babies. I have my cat (Snickers), then my family has two dogs (Shelby and Bruno), another two cats (Coconut and Nala), and 2 guinea pigs, (Chiller and Squeaker). Even with my pets, it's never stopped me from helping watch someone else’s before. My love for any animal is completely endless. I think it's very important to make sure your pets feel safe and comfortable while you're away. Whether it be for the day or the week, your pets should feel happy and secure. While dog sitting I love going on walks, going to the park to play, and even some bathing and grooming (if needed)! Although, nothing can compare to those movie nights, snuggled on the couch. I am a fairly bubbly, creative, and down to earth person. Pampered pups by Marissa has given me this fantastic opportunity to spread joy to other animals.\n\nHi ! My name is Renee. I have been babysitting and loving on animals helping them stay comfortable and safe while their parents are off having fun for at least 30 years. I started in Las Vegas went to Great Falls Montana and my last stop is here in Lansdale.\n\nI don’t own any animals but I am so lucky because I get to enjoy your pets while you are away. The animals are my main source of exercise enjoying the outside while getting a few walks in daily. It is my main focus is to make sure everyone gets lots of love and that they feel comfortable while you are away. I am looking forward to seeing you soon.\n\nHi, I’m Holly!\n\nAnimal lover and self-proclaimed movie & music nerd!\n\nI’m the Mom of 2 rescue Fur Kids, Beatrix Kiddo and Ash Kristopherson. Named after characters from Kill Bill & The Fantastic Mr. Fox.\n\nWe enjoy taking long walks around Lansdale, chasing the occasional squirrel, playing ball and don’t forget belly rubs!\n\nI’ve been an animal person all my life and was fortunate enough to have raised some amazing furry family members over the last 25 years including Dobermans, Miniature Pinschers, and a Boston Terrier. I also grew up with cats, assorted small animals and lots of lizards.\n\nI’m excited to get to know & enjoy our clients and provide them with the best care and companionship possible. I’m committed to giving your Fur Kids the same love and care I give mine. I look forward to lots of cuddles and kisses from your furry family members.\n\nMy name is Peggy, born and raised in Pennsylvania. I’m happily married for almost 30 yrs, we have 6 children. Also, a pet rabbit, cat, and a dog. Furry friends are my best friends, I'm happiest when I'm spending time with my furry friends, love taking my dog hiking and to parks to hang out. All my furry friends have been recused animals, including rats at one point, and yes rats! They are actually super intelligent and fun to play with. Chopper has many challenges with anxiety, aggression with other dogs and likes to charge at cars and amazon trucks, so I have had to learn new ways how to support my dog with training and understanding what triggers my dog and how to support him while we are out in public, it's not perfect but his behaviors have improved a great deal with training, meds and lots of love. I also am the crazy lady who talks to farm animals, I absolutely love going to the farm to see all the farm animals it's one of my favorite things to do and my kids totally make fun of me. love spending time with family and friends, hiking, traveling, and learning how to cook new recipes. I’m also a business owner and that allows me to have flexible hours for my kids and that’s when I get to be very creative. I'm very excited to meet and spend time with your furry friends, you can trust that I will give them lots of love while you are away and probably have many conversations with them\n\nHi everyone! My name is Michele Let me tell you, I feel like the luckiest person in the world! I can honestly say for the first time in my life I love what I do.\n\nThere is a saying that goes\n\n\"If you do what you love you will never work a day in your life.\"❤️\n\nI am doing that now and I couldn't be pleased.\n\nI have had cats my whole life and have been lucky to have been the proud parents to three fur-babies.\n\nFiona is my boxer little devil and Samson is her saint of a brother that puts up with her!\n\nI will love your fur-babies just like they were my own and I look forward to meeting all of you as well!!!!\n\nHi, My name is NikkI\n\nI am a lifelong animal lover! Currently i have a 4 year old flat coated springerdoodle! Always having a passion for caring and the wellbeing of animals, led me to working in the pet industry. I have experience with reactive dogs and training as well.\n\nI enjoy fostering for rescues, finding them their forever home is the most rewarding! I was a photographer and would travel all over to different breeders to find unique breeds for published dog books.\n\nI enjoy meeting people and their pets so I am looking forward to meeting you and your babies! Our fur babies bring so much joy to our lives!\n\nHello! My name is Nicole and ever since I was a kid, I've had a passion for animals. Now that I am an adult, I am still just as committed to animals and love all pets. Unfortunately though, I live in an apartment that doesn't allow any pets, so pet sitting is my outlet!! I have experience with pet sitting/dog walking as well as extended overnights. I love walking park trails and getting outside with dogs, but also love curling up on the couch and giving lots of love. If it were my decision, I would be around animals all day so I am more excited to meet all your furry friends!!"
