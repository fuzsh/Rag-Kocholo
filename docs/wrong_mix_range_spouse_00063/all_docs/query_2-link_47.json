She was dedicated to her Catholic faith and to Catholic education. She demonstrated and impressed this upon her family.\n\nShe loved her Sicilian heritage, and passed her traditional recipes on to her children and grandchildren. Tena gathered her children and grandchildren each year after Thanksgiving to make Cuicidati (Italian Fig Cookies), Olive Salad, Svincuini, and Caponata.\n\nTena was a devoted wife and mother, a wonderful cook, seamstress, and bookkeeper. She worked beside her husband Leo in their business, Leo’s Firestone, until their retirement.\n\nShe will be sadly missed and lovingly remembered by her six children, Donna Grizzaffi Burke (Myron) of Morgan City, Melanie Grizzaffi O’Neil (Steve) of Gulf Shores, AL, Leo Grizzaffi Jr. (Leigh) of Morgan City, Julie Grizzaffi Walker of Lafayette, Bruce Grizzaffi (Jackie) of Baton Rouge, Gregory Grizzaffi (Brigitte) of Baton Rouge;); 13 grandchildren, Jacques “Jake” Olivier (Michelle), Matthew Olivier, Abby Burke, Emily Burke Patureau (Matthew), Benjamin Olivier (Ashley), Leo “Luca” Grizzaffi, Elizabeth Walker, Salvatore Grizzaffi (Marissa), Mariel Walker Ortego (Lane), Michael Grizzaffi, Grant Grizzaffi, Ava Grizzaffi, and Lucy Tena Grizzaffi; two bonus grandchildren, Roderick Burke and Lauren Burke Davidson (Aaron); five great-grandchildren, Clara and Audrey Olivier, Evelyn Grizzaffi, Jack Ortego, and Alice Grizzaffi; brother Matthew Rousso (Janet), three sisters-in-law, Belva Grizzaffi Myers, Janice Grizzaffi, and Earline Grizzaffi.\n\nTena was preceded in death by her parents, Jack Sr and Marie Rousso, the love of her life, her Honey, and husband of 67 years, Leo Luke Grizzaffi Sr.; her brothers, Rev. Anthony Rousso, Santo (Stella) Rousso, and Jack (Pat) Rousso Jr.\n\nVisitation will be held Saturday, February 24, 2024, at Twin City Funeral Home from 9:00 a.m. until 11:30 a.m. A Mass of Christian burial will follow at 12:00 noon Saturday, February 24, 2024, at Sacred Heart Catholic Church, with Very Rev.
