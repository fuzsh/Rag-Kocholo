        "text": "Marissa Morgan was Dr. Bull's second in command. She is a psychologist and neurolinguistics expert who formerly worked at the Department of Homeland Security (\"The Necklace\"). She temporary left TAC and was working in partnership with Bradley Lena. She created the algorithm for mirror jurors. She speaks to Dr. Bull through an earpiece during trials In the season 6 episode “False Positive”, she has lunch with Bradley to discuss a job offer, given the fact she struggled with being overlooked by Jason in recent months. Despite previously accepting Jason's offer of her own office, freedom to do whatever she wish's with her algorithm and matching Bradley's offer plus 20 percent she later left TAC after Bradley revealed one final perk in his offer, her name being acknowledged and being put above the door of Bradley's company. It must be known that her name on a door was not Marissa's cause for leaving TAC, but rather to be apart of something where her value is known and she does not have to negotiate or argue to earn that. However later in the season she returned to TAC as partner with Jason.\n\nShe is very organized and has knowledge about Greek mythology. She follows her convictions and never lets anyone force her into sty.\n\nShe was adopted and is very thankful that her new parents gave her a home.\n\nIn episode 6 of season 1 (\"Bedside Manner\") TAC's client is Dr. Terry Robeson, a gynecological surgeon. He is the best in his job and knows that. He is a former boyfriend of Marissa. They went to college (Harvard) together and were allied for one more year until she broke up with him. When Terry invited her to watch a surgery as their first date she became sick.\n\nWhile Marissa’s relationship with Terry didn’t go well she and Bull make a great team. She thinks the reason for that is that she is good at dealing with brilliant, complicated man but she shouldn’t date him. She has also been seen speaking a fluent French on occasion.\n\nTrivia[]"
