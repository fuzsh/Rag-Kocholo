        "text": "Pre-registration is now open. Logistics and open gaming requests are being updated.\n\nPre-Register | Badgeholders | Already Registered | Members | Airport Carpools | Rides Wanted/Offered | Roommates Wanted | Open Gaming | Childcare | Non-Gaming (Spouse/Family) Excursions | Lost and Found | Other Miscellaneous\n\nPRE-REGISTER: WBC prides itself on being gamer friendly with a minimum of red tape. There are no sold out events or lines to buy event tickets because there are no event tickets. One membership price covers all, with no additional event fees or tickets to worry about.\n\nJoin BPA/Preregister for the Convention\n\n(includes registration; Tribune membership includes ALL Pre-Cons)\n\nTerms and Conditions of Membership\n\n2012 WBC Pre-Reg Flyer (4/26/12; pdf; 1MB)\n\nThere are NO refunds. Pre-registration can you save up to 50% off certain at-the-door admission prices and also saves time at check-in. However, pre-registration is a discounted rate granted in exchange for guaranteed attendance. Consequently, no refunds are available.\n\nHotel registrations must be handled separately. See our Hotel and Travel Information page for reservation information with the Lancaster Host and Continental Inn.\n\nBADGEHOLDERS: All attendees at WBC need to have a World Boardgaming Championships Organizer Badge Holder, which serves as a handy souvenir keepsake, wallet and pen holder all in one convenient package—handsomely embossed with the BPA logo. No more lost badges or pins to wreck your shirt. It features a clear plastic view pouch for your badge, a zipper storage compartment for money, change, or hotel keys, two additional pouches for whatever else you need and a pen holder for that elusive writing implement needed for so many games. An easily fastened velcro neck cord assures a comfortable fit with no assembly required.\n\nSuch deluxe badge holders have been sold separately at other conferences for up to $10 each. We ask anyone who already has one to bring it back each year. If you don't bring one—including your first year at the convention, we will provide one for a token cost of $2. EVERYONE must have and wear a badge holder during the convention—there are NO exceptions. Please bring correct change if you will need to purchase badgeholders. Thanks for helping us upgrade the conference, go \"green\" and recycle and keep our costs—and your admission charges—low.\n\nALREADY REGISTERED?: The alphabetical list posted below will be updated irregularly at first and weekly during the summer with the names of those entitled to attend WBC 2012 and its various Pre-Cons. Sustaining Members entitled to Admission throughout WBC week (July 30th - August 5th) will be listed without reference to specific days. General members and guests who pay their admission fees by July 21 will be listed with the registered day(s) of their stay in brackets. Those registered for a separate preceding Pre-Con will also be listed as such with the \"pc\" prefix for those days. All Tribune and Sponsor level members are indicated in bold and may attend all Pre-Cons for no additional charge.\n\nThis list provides backup confirmation of the status of your registration in case you misplaced your email confirmation and is also useful as an easy checklist to see which old friends are attending this year and to cast your net for that elusive missing fourth team member, ride, or roommate. If your name appears here, you do NOT have to submit a pre-registration form UNLESS you wish to order more days admission, order a souvenir, or register a team for the Team Tournament.\n\nNote: Convention programs will not be mailed in 2012 but will be available on Schedule Page before July 1. WBC 2011-2012 Yearbooks will be distributed to all 2012 Sustaining level and higher members as of Jan. 1, 2012 (or Tribune members as of April 30, 2012) at Registration in the New Holland room. Yearbooks will be on sale at registration for $10 each while supplies last or can be downloaded at http://www.boardgamers.org/yearbook11/print/.\n\n2012 Boardgame Players & Guests [Total: 727]\n\nNote: All Tribune and Sponsor-level members shown in bold type are entitled to free admission to all WBC Pre-Cons as well as the entire WBC week. They may enjoy all or any part of the nine days between July 28 and Aug. 5.\n\nA: ... Ackman, Cliff ... Adams, Chris ... Alderman, William ... Allen, Henry ... Amicucci, Anna Maria ...
