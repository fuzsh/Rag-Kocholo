It must be known that her name on a door was not Marissa's cause for leaving TAC, but rather to be apart of something where her value is known and she does not have to negotiate or argue to earn that. However later in the season she returned to TAC as partner with Jason.

She is very organized and has knowledge about Greek mythology. She follows her convictions and never lets anyone force her into sty.

She was adopted and is very thankful that her new parents gave her a home.

In episode 6 of season 1 ("Bedside Manner") TAC's client is Dr. Terry Robeson, a gynecological surgeon. He is the best in his job and knows that. He is a former boyfriend of Marissa. They went to college (Harvard) together and were allied for one more year until she broke up with him. When Terry invited her to watch a surgery as their first date she became sick.

While Marissa’s relationship with Terry didn’t go well she and Bull make a great team. She thinks the reason for that is that she is good at dealing with brilliant, complicated man but she shouldn’t date him. She has also been seen speaking a fluent French on occasion.
