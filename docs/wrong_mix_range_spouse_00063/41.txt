Megan Ortagus, Transitioning from Government Service to Empowering Afghan Futures!

Morgan Ortagus and her twin, Megan, were born on July 10, 1982, in Auburndale, Florida. However, unlike Morgan, who is frequently in public, Megan prefers to keep her life private.

Megan is a talented woman who graduated with top honors from Johns Hopkins University in May 2014, earning a Master of Arts in Global Security Studies.

She worked as a government officer for over a decade, from January 2011 to December 2022, in the United States Federal Government.

However, before her government service, Megan worked for two years as a communications director at the Institute for the Study of War.

Following extensive experience in government service, Megan co-founded and currently serves as the president of Uplifting Afghan Girls (UAG), an NGO launched in May 2023.

This non-profit organization collaborates with a charity in Afghanistan to identify exceptional young women and provide them with the incredible opportunity to study in the United States.

Additionally, she has extensive experience as a senior intelligence officer, addressing critical global issues in regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

The Ortagus twins exemplify a supportive sibling relationship, with Megan as a pillar of support behind her sister’s public and professional aspirations.
