Generally jumping spiders need a bit of space, even though they are tiny and also need a variety of objects to explore in its enclosure such as tiny logs, faux plants etc. They love to jump and explore their surroundings and therefore, keeping a jumping spider can be very rewarding if you interact with it outside of its enclosure and let it get some exercise.\n\nYour jumping spider will learn to trust you and get to know you over time. Leaving a couple of bite sized crickets in its enclosure, misting it once a week lightly and providing enough hiding places should cover itâ€™s needs.\n\nIf you are uncertain about taking care of your jumping spider please send us an email!\n\nDownload the General Jumping Spider Care Guide Here\n\nGeneral information\n\nJumping spiders do not live very long â€“ most species only live up to 3 years\n\nPeacock spider males in particular have very short life spans (some only 3 â€“ 4 months).\n\nFemales live longer than males\n\nJumping spiders are very sensitive to climatic changes as well as moisture/dryness levels.\n\nJumping spiders prefer to eat flying insects such as fruit flies, flies, hover flies etc, but will eat crickets (appropriate size).\n\nJumping spiders are some of the few species that can be handled safely as long as it is less than 20 minutes per day (no to stress them).\n\nPlease take note of the age of your jumping spider when purchasing â€“ adult jumping spiders (especially males) may only live a couple of months. Therefore, we do not guarantee our jumping spiders for more than 7 days after shipping.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, our jumping spiders are ethically and sustainably wild caught. Read about our ethics here.\n\nWe currently have a breeding program in place â€“ check out our breeding room for more information.\n\nPlease leave this field empty\n\nOh hi there ðŸ‘‹ Itâ€™s nice to meet you.\n\nSign up to receive the latest news straight to your inbox!\n\nWe donâ€™t spam!
