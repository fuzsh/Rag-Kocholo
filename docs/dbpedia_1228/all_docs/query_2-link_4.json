        "text": "Hyllus diardi is commonly known as heavy jumper. It is recognized as one of the largest jumping spiders in the world.\n\nHyllus is a genus of the spider family Salticidae. Most species occur in Africa and Madagascar, with many in Australasia and north to India. H. insularis is found in Greece and Iran, but it is considered misplaced in this genus, and is now Evarcha insularis. Wikipedia\n\nLocation: Lornie Road â€“ February 2023"
