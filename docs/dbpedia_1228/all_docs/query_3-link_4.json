Pls help me\n\nI am new here too, but best advice I can give is put your sp name in the search bar at the top of the page and start reading. That's what I do hope you have luck in your quest\n\nIf the male is sub adult, you canâ€™t do anything right now. Either get an adult male or wait for this one to mature. You can only breed them when both are adult.\n\n// Please before breeding, inform yourself enough to know what you are doing with your animals. It seems like you do not know your animals enough yet - so first get to the point where keeping them does not get you in any surprises anymore. After that and after you have informed yourself about breeding enough you should think about this.\n\nAlso; try using the search function on AB - there you will find plenty of information - also on jumpers."
