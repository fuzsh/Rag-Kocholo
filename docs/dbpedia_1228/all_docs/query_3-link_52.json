        "text": "Subspecies of Sunda clouded leopard\n\nBornean clouded leopard A Bornean clouded leopard along the lower Kinabatangan, eastern Sabah, Malaysia Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Suborder: Feliformia Family: Felidae Subfamily: Pantherinae Genus: Neofelis Species: Subspecies:\n\nN. d. borneensis\n\nTrinomial name Neofelis diardi borneensis\n\nWilting, Christiansen, Kitchener, Kemp, Ambu and Fickel, 2007\n\nThe Bornean clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi borneensis) is a subspecies of the Sunda clouded leopard. It is native to the island of Borneo, and differs from the Batu-Sumatran clouded leopard in the shape and frequency of spots, as well as in cranio-mandibular and dental characters.[1] In 2017, the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group recognized the validity of this subspecies.[2]\n\nHabitat and distribution\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Kalimantan, it was recorded in Sabangau National Park.[3]\n\nIn northern Sarawak, it was recorded in mixed dipterocarp forest outside a protected area at elevations of 1,000 to 1,215 m (3,281 to 3,986 ft).[4]\n\nIn Sabah, it was recorded in Danum Valley Conservation Area, Ulu Segama, Malua and Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserves, Tabin Wildlife Reserve and the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary.[5]\n\nEcology\n\n[edit]\n\nResults of a camera-trapping survey revealed that it is largely nocturnal. A radio-collared female had a home range of around 23 km2 (8.9 sq mi) in 109 days.[6]\n\nEvolution\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Bornean clouded leopard is estimated to have diverged from the Sumatran clouded leopard in the Late Pleistocene, between 400 and 120 thousand years ago. Land bridges that were created due to low sea levels in the Late Pleistocene were submerged by rising sea levels, resulting in the Bornean clouded leopard becoming separated from the mainland population at this time.[7] It was recognized as its own subspecies in 2007 following an analysis of the genetic substructure of the Bornean and Sumatran clouded leopards, which concluded that there was enough genetic variation to recognize the Sumatran Neofelis diardi diardi and the Bornean Neofelis diardi borneensis as two different subspecies.[8]\n\nThreats\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Bornean clouded leopard is considered vulnerable, similar to other Neofelis species, due to anthropogenic disturbances such as deforestation, illegal poaching, and hunting pressure.[9] In Sabah, habitat loss is primarily driven by the development of oil palm plantations, which inhibits connectivity of the Bornean clouded leopard population.[10]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nBay cat\n\nBornean tiger\n\nSunda Islands\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
