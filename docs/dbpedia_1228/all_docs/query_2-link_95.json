        "text": "Hyllus cf giganteus is a contender for that title This female shouldn't be fully grown yet.\n\n[YOUTUBE]dJiF0cSFj44[/YOUTUBE]\n\nWOW!That is so cool!\n\nWhere is this species found?I was always under the impression some of the largest jumpers were located here in the USA..\n\n-Chris\n\nI saw a black one bigger then this when I was in mexico, although iam not too sure on the species.\n\nvery beautiful coloration you have there.\n\nWell, that reopens the possibility of what I saw downtown having been an extremely large jumper. I was astonished at its size but didn't grab a coke bottle quickly enough to catch it before it vanished in a puff of smoke.\n\nWell, our jumpers may not be the very largest in the world but we do have some doozies. I've seen P. audax monstrosities that were about 1\" DLS. That's not as large as the spider shown above but still pretty big... for a jumper. I think there is a Phiddipus spp out west that gets even bigger.\n\nThat was a great video Erik. Thanks for sharing it.\n\nErik got those beauties from me\n\nThe largest is officially Hyllus diardii, with Phidippus octopunctatus supposedly a very close second\n\nalthough my Phidippus regius AF is about as big as a fully grown Hyllus cf giganteum"
