This secretive, mid-sized (16–23 kg) carnivore, now severely endangered, is traditionally subdivided into four southeast Asian subspecies ( ) [4–8]. We used molecular genetic methods to re-evaluate subspecies partitions and to quantify patterns of population genetic variation among 109 clouded leopards of known geographic origin ( , Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Data available online). We found strong phylogeographic monophyly and large genetic distances between N. n. nebulosa (mainland) and N. n. diardi (Borneo; n = 3 individuals) with mtDNA (771 bp), nuclear DNA (3100 bp), and 51 microsatellite loci. Thirty-six fixed mitochondrial and nuclear nucleotide differences and 20 microsatellite loci with nonoverlapping allele-size ranges distinguished N. n. nebulosa from N. n. diardi. Along with fixed subspecies-specific chromosomal differences, this degree of differentiation is equivalent to, or greater than, comparable measures among five recognized Panthera species (lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard). These distinctions increase the urgency of clouded leopard conservation efforts, and if affirmed by morphological analysis and wider sampling of N. n. diardi in Borneo and Sumatra, would support reclassification of N. n. diardi as a new species (Neofelis diardi).\n\nIntroduction\n\nPatterns of phylogeographic variation and the validity of current taxonomic delineations were evaluated with a variety of molecular genetic markers that, together, provide a rigorous assessment of distinctiveness among groups of clouded leopards. The same measures were assessed among the five well-accepted species of the Panthera lineage to provide an evolutionary context and a direct comparison.\n\nMitochondrial DNA\n\nMtDNA sequence variation was assessed from four gene segments, ATP-8 (139 bp), control region (190 bp), Cyt-b (219 bp), and ND5 (223 bp), which were analyzed both separately and together ( ; Figures S1 and S2). DNA sequences were obtained for all four subspecies of clouded leopard for only the 139 bp of the ATP-8 gene fragment ( ; Figures S1 and S2). Among these sequences, there were 12–14 variable sites that distinguished N. n. diardi from the other three subspecies (Table S3). This genetic distance is similar to the 5–16 nucleotide differences among Panthera species. Of 14 variable ATP-8 sites among clouded leopard subspecies, five had nucleotides found only in N. n. diardi (Borneo) and not in other clouded leopard subspecies or Panthera species (Figures S1 and S2). There were six ATP-8 haplotypes ( ; Figures S1 and S2) among 67 clouded leopards (including four museum samples). N. n. diardi from Borneo (n = 3) had two haplotypes (DIA-1, DIA-2), N. n. macrosceloides (n = 2) had one haplotype (MAC-1), and N. n. brachyurus (n = 1) had haplotype BRAC-1. Two haplotypes (NEB-3, NEB-5) were found in N. n. nebulosa (n = 61).\n\nIn a phylogenetic analysis of the 139 bp of ATP-8, the three mainland subspecies fell into a monophyletic cluster distinctive of N. n. diardi with bootstrap support (BS) ranging from 63%–100% for three phylogenetic analytical methods ( ). N. n.diardi samples (haplotypes DIA-1 and DIA-2) formed a distinctive group with high BS for all three methods (100/100/93). The three other N. nebulosa subspecies formed an unresolved group (BS of 79/75/63). Similarly relationships among Panthera species were unresolved ( ).\n\nWhen the four mtDNA gene segments (771 bp) were analyzed as a whole, clouded leopards were monophyletic relative to the other Panthera species (Figure S3). Thirty-five N. n. nebulosa had five unique haplotypes, whereas the three N. n. diardi carried two distinctive haplotypes. There were 27–31 nucleotide differences separating N. n. nebulosa individuals from N. n. diardi (Bornean), as compared with 42–60 nucleotide differences separating pairs of Panthera species (Table S3B).\n\nNuclear DNA Sequence\n\nNuclear gene sequences (nDNA) of ATP-7A (635 bp), BGN (610 bp), HK1 (338 bp), IDS (573 bp), and PLP (932 bp) were each analyzed individually, then together as a nDNA data set, and finally combined with the mtDNA sequences (Figure S4). Using the concatenated nDNA genes, we found 11 sites that defined one unique combined sequence or “haplotype” in the three members of N. n. diardi (DIA-1) (Figure S2, Table S3C) and one haplotype (NEB-3) unique to all N. n. nebulosa samples ( ). Among the Panthera species there were 7–17 nucleotide differences in nuclear genes segments (Table S3C).\n\nWith combined analyses of concatenated mtDNA and nDNA sequences ( ; ), 36-41 nucleotides separated individuals of N. n. diardi from those of N. n. nebulosa; in comparison, there were 56–72 nucleotide differences separating Panthera species. In the combined 3,859 bp sequence, N. n. diardi (Bornean; DIA-1, DIA-2) had 36–41 fixed differences relative to N. n. nebulosa ( ); 21 of these variable nucleotide differences were also found in at least one Panthera species. The remaining 20 differences were unique to N. n. diardi and were not shared with Panthera species (Figures S1 and S2). Complete sequence data from all genes (771 bp mtDNA and 3088 bp nDNA) were available for only N. n. nebulosa and N. n. diardi because N. n. macrosceloides and N. n. brachyurus were represented by museum samples only (Table S2). N. n. nebulosa and N. n. diardi were reciprocally monophyletic with high bootstrap support (97/100/100 and 87/100/100, respectively) ( ). There were 41 steps between the subspecies, including seven homoplasies.\n\nTable 1\n\nDIA-1DIA-2NEB-1NEB-2NEB-3NEB-4NEB-5LionJaguarLeopardTigerSnow leopardDomestic catDIA-1*DIA-21*NEB-13838*NEB-236371*NEB-3404112*NEB-43939231*NEB-539391223*Lion140140130122133127133*Jaguar19219318717819118719072*Leopard1461471481411511451505668*Tiger190192184176188186189597264*Snow leopard14114213512614013413959706157*Domestic cat175176176161178164178138190134193134*\n\nMicrosatellites\n\nGenetic variation was estimated with 51 felid microsatellites [9] (Table S4) for clouded leopards and five Panthera species, including six diverse lion populations ( ). Observed heterozygosity for Panthera species was Ca 0.5, except in lions, where Ho was 0.3896± 0.009, ranging from 0.090 ± 0.013 in inbred Gir Forest lions to 0.504 ± 0.022 in the outbred Serengeti National Park lions. Observed heterozygosity across all clouded leopards was 0.471 ± 0.019 (0.482 6 0.021 in N. n. nebulosa and 0.441 ± 0.050 in N. n. diardi). Average microsatellite variance ranged from 2.43 to 6.55 within Panthera species but was almost double that in clouded leopards (11.38) ( ), indicating a large accumulation of mutational variation and suggesting the passage of a relatively long (near species-level) time interval [10, 11].\n\nTable 2\n\nSpecies or PopulationIndividualLoci TypedObserved heterozygosity ± SDExpected heterozygosity ± SDAverage Number of Alleles per LocusAverage Microsatellite VarianceAverage Allele Size Range (Repeats)/LocusNeofelis nebulosa15510.471 ± 0.01920.665 ± 0.02895.82 ± 2.2611.389.31N. n. nebulosa13510.482 ± 0.02080.597 ± 0.03524.55 ± 1.997.466.49N. n. diardi2510.441 ± 0.05030.487 ± 0.04672.10 ± 0.772.542.16Panthera onca15510.624 ± 0.01870.717 ± 0.02856.33 ± 2.175.547.69Panthera pardus13490.514 ± 0.02360.774 ± 0.02526.31 ± 2.136.557.59Panthera tigris15510.482 ± 0.02070.689 ± 0.03465.53 ± 2.064.936.47Panthera uncia15500.515 ± 0.01880.577 ± 0.03394.20 ± 1.742.434.30Panthera leo60510.394 ± 0.00930.560 ± 0.03685.29 ± 2.664.727.23Gir Forest10510.090 ± 0.01270.096 ± 0.02591.31 ± 0.650.260.55Ngorongoro Crater10510.445 ± 0.02240.435 ± 0.03552.84 ± 1.243.024.14Serengeti National Park10510.504 ± 0.02240.524 ± 0.03643.61 ± 1.74.845.49Kalahari Gemsbok National Park10440.393 ± 0.02380.404 ± 0.04442.68 ± 1.384.143.66Etosha Park10440.460 ± 0.02420.492 ± 0.04083.05 ± 1.433.963.77Kruger National Park10440.499 ± 0.02400.480 ± 0.04193.32 ± 1.74.384.80Felis catus15510.616 ± 0.01800.699 ± 0.02266.18 ± 2.465.347.78\n\nWe evaluated five microsatellite genetic-distance estimators to reveal species and population distinctions among clouded leopards and Panthera species ( , Figures S5–S8). Each Panthera species defined a monophyletic group (see Dps-based phylogram, ), with bootstrap support from 68%–99%, and among the lions internal population structure corresponded to subspecies or geographic designations. N. n. nebulosa individuals formed a monophyletic group (97% BS) distinct from the two N. n. diardi, which formed a highly monophyletic group. Other measures of microsatellite genetic distance [Dkf, Fst, Gst, and (δμ)2] similarly distinguished N. n. nebulosa and N. n. diardi (Figures S5–S8).\n\nIn a comparison of the distribution of microsatellite allele sizes between clouded leopard subspecies (Figure S9), allele sizes for 20 of 51 loci did not overlap between N. n. nebulosa and N. n. diardi (Fca44, 80, 81, 82, 90, 94, 100, 105, 107, 132, 144, 176, 212, 225, 249, 261, 275, 290, 304, and 310). This is twice the number of nonoverlapping alleles observed between any pair of Panthera species (Figure S9), which had from four (between lion and leopard) to nine (between snow leopard and tiger and between tiger and lion) non-size-overlapping loci. For six loci (Fca80, 82, 100, 107, 144, and 275), the allele size gap between Neofelis subspecies exceeded 14 bp (Figure S9). Between pairs of Panthera species, the maximum gap in allele size ranged from 30 bp between lions and leopards (FCA117) to 10 bp between leopards and jaguars.\n\nClouded leopard microsatellite data (for the individuals in ) were analyzed for evidence of population genetic structure/partitions with ARARst [12]. A two-group scenario partitioning N. n. diardi from N. n. nebulosa had the highest Rst value (0.60) relative to other scenarios with further partitions and showed significant population genetic differentiation (p < 0.001). A Bayesian algorithm as implemented in STRUCTURE [13] also provided the strongest support for only two partitions (K = 2, Pr(K) = 0.644). In this scenario, all N. n. nebulosa and N. n. diardi individuals were assigned to two unique clusters with high probability (q> 0.90), indicative of low levels of gene flow. We estimated N. n. nebulosa diverged from N. n. diardi 1.41 million years ago (MYA) (95% CI of 0.93–2.0 MYA) by using a calibration of 6.37 MYA for the divergence of clouded leopards from the Panthera lineage based upon a comprehensive analysis of nearly 20 kb of nuclear gene sequence and multiple fossil dates [1].\n\nCytogenetic Variation\n\nMost felid species, as well as many canid, mustelid, and hyena species, have two distinct acrocentric chromosomes, designated F2 and F3 [14, 15], that are considered part of the ancestral carnivore karyotype [15–17]. A G band analysis of metaphase chromosomes from three N. n. diardi and nine N. n. nebulosa revealed a dramatic fixed difference between the two subspecies. N. n. diardi individuals presented a conventional smaller F3 chromosome, identical to that in other felids. However, nine N. n. nebulosa had previously described F3 variants [14, 15] that were larger than F2 variants and that sometimes included an extended chromosomal arm above the centromere ( ). This chromosomal polymorphism is derived from recent additions of constitutive heterochomatin and also occurs in other mammals [16]. Additional insight was derived from chromosome paints of metaphase spreads, with field heterochromatin being visualized with a degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR) probe from an E group chromosome (R.S., unpublished data). This probe illuminated the homologous E group chromosome of both subspecies (arrows in Figure S10). However, in N. n. nebulosa the telomeres of several other chromosomes were also illuminated (Figure S10A), providing additional evidence of an increase in constitutive heterochromatin in N. n. nebulosa.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAn accurate and formalized taxonomy is critical to the conservation of the clouded leopard. Here we show that Bornean clouded leopards are a distinct population, reproductively isolated from other clouded leopard subspecies and having clear phylogenetic discontinuities. We estimate that Bornean clouded leopards diverged from mainland populations during the Pleistocene, when recurring episodes of global cooling and warming created opportunities for population isolation. The Sunda Shelf, between the Indonesian archipelago and Vietnam, was repeatedly exposed and then covered by changing sea levels [18]. However, even when the archipelago was connected to the mainland [19, 20], ancient river systems may have continued to isolate modern Borneo [20, 21]. Although captive breeding between Bornean and mainland clouded leopards has not been documented to our knowledge, behavioral patterns observed in captive breeding of clouded leopards may have reinforced reproductive isolation [22–24]. Similar geographic isolation likely influenced the evolutionary history of other species in the region. For example, Sumatran (P. pygmaeus) and Bornean (P. abelii) orangutans, which diverged 1.1–1.7 MYA, are sufficiently differentiated to be considered different species [25–27].\n\nBeyond the clear distinction between N. n. nebulosa and N. n. diardi individuals in our analyses, there was no indication of further subdivision within these two geographic regions. These findings have important conservation implications because field studies indicate that the Taiwan subspecies (N. n. brachyurus) may be extinct [28]. Our analysis of N. n. brachyurus was based upon two modern samples of zoo animals of possible Taiwanese origin and one museum sample. The two zoo samples had a haplotype (NEB-3) found in mainland N. n. nebulosa individuals ( ; Figures S1 and S2). The short sequence from the N. n. brachyurus museum sample was slightly divergent and may represent an historic Taiwanese clouded leopard haplotype. This provides initial support for the introduction of clouded leopards from mainland populations as a management tool for recovery of Taiwan's population.\n\nThere are three caveats that temper our conclusions for species-level designation of N. n. diardi. First, our sample size for N. n. diardi of only three individuals is small, reducing confidence that diversity in Borneo was adequately sampled. Second, clouded leopards may be present on other islands, and these must be sampled to confidently characterize clouded leopard evolutionary history. Third, a morphological assessment of these genetic partitions has not been completed to date. However, it is likely that a 1–1.5 MY separation could have led to morphological differences that would support the molecular genetic findings.\n\nHowever, the notable distinctions between N. n. nebulosa and N. n. diardi are based on multiple genetic markers, and if replicated with broader sampling, they would justify the recognition of two distinct clouded leopard species (and the naming of a new felid species). The substantial and cumulative evidence presented here from several distinct molecular markers includes: (1) reciprocal monophyly indicated by mtDNA (771 bp, Figure S3), nuclear DNA (3088 bp; Figure S4), and micro-satellite variation (51 loci; and Figure S5–S8) and comparable in magnitude to the species-level divergence among well-accepted Panthera species; (2) significant sequence distance between N. n. diardi and N. n. nebulosa specimens ( ; Table S3); (3) fixed nucleotide sequence and haplotype differences between subspecies (Figures S1 and S2); (4) recapitulation of genetic separation by AMOVA and STRUCTURE analyses of microsatellite distinctions; (5) large within-species microsatellite variance (twice that in Panthera species, ) with twenty (of 51) displaying nonover-lapping microsatellite allele size ranges between N. n. nebulosa and N. n diardi (Figure S9); (6) fixed cytogenetic distinctions in chromosome F3 ( ); and (7) a coalescent date of 1.41 MY for divergence between N. n. nebulosa and N. n. diardi; this number is more than twice the within-species divergence detected between any pair of Panthera species [29–34] and is within the same range (1–3 MY) as species-level distinctions across Panthera [1]. Taken together, these measures support species-level distinction.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge full collaborative credit to institutions and investigators who are listed in Tables S1 and S2 and who supplied the biological specimens upon which this study is based.
