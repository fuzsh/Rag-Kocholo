        "text": "Hi everyone! I'm looking on tips to pair jumping spiders. I'm planning to pair a pair of mine but I have never paired anything myself before. I'm looking for tips. From what I know, i should just introduce the male to the female on neutral territory. That way there's less risk of cannibalism. Am I right? Help is greatly appreciated. Thanks\n\nMake sure both are very well fed before introducing or they will try to eat each other. They'll act pretty aggressively regardless, but anything you can do to make the interaction calmer is better. Not sure about male to female vs. neutral, but I think either method would be fine.\n\nWhat genus do you have? Hyllus or Phidippus?\n\nQuite an old thread, but perhaps useful,\n\nhttp://arachnoboards.com/threads/my-jumping-spider-breeding.253223/\n\nJust read through it but nothing that I didn’t already know. Thank you anyways. Oh and I have Hyllus diardi\n\nMake sure both are very well fed before introducing or they will try to eat each other.

Checked back on them as often as I could. Took around 5 hours or so but they did it!!!! Sorry for the bad quality photo but I really didn’t want to disturb them. The male stayed inserted for around 1 hour and 30 minutes!!!! I have a good feeling about this\n\nAnd this is what I did to their honeymoon enclosure\n\nI left that piece of paper loose so I could peek on them every once in a while without disturbing them much\n\nMost people I see take out the male and the female, and let them meet each other on a “mating stage”. The aggressive level varies from individual to individual, some cases aggressive males can fatally wound females, so it’s a bit of a gamble. When I attempted to pair my WC audax, the Male was quite eager to mate and danced right when he sees her. While the female was not interested, and atmost only did a warning lunge to shoo the male off\n\nAll best wishes for breeding. Hyllus is not as commonly bred as Phidippus, so if you succeed you will be adding to uncharted territory. Good luck.\n\nThanks. I hope I end up getting some babies out of this pairing. They’re especially more uncommon/rare were I am. I’m located in the U.S.\n\nIts definitely possible:\n\nBut rather low yield. Not sure what conditions she kept them though, by the looks in the vid\n\nTemp set to 92 Fahrenheits - 31-33 Degrees Celsius. And quite dry 30 to 50% rel humidity, which might be strange. I heard they have higher humidity requirements + higher ventilation than say Phidippus regius.\n\nAnd yes, slings must be separated round 2nd Instar L2, to avoid coco-locos\n\nIts definitely possible:\n\nBut rather low yield.

And she did nothing like that. Just room temps, and what she’s been doing to care for the mom. She ended up getting 150 spiderlings or so out of 1 sac!\n\nThanks for the tips on when to separate but I already knew that as I’ve raised 3 or so Phidippus sacs\n\nNice ! Then you are in good track, and with no further fuss , you might get it through. Keep us posted please !\n\nI will definitely keep you guys posted on whatever happens next!!!\n\nI've bred and reared H. diardi several time and have a couple of breeding pairs at the moment. These guys actually do best reared communally with some good broad leaved plants like pothos. They build communally nests and I see very little cannibalism given plenty of food and space.\n\nGood luck with your female, they are one of my faves.\n\nI've bred and reared H. diardi several time and have a couple of breeding pairs at the moment.
