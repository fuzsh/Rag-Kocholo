        "text": "The bay cat Catopuma badia is a small cat endemic to the tropical forests of Borneo. One of only seven cats to be listed as Endangered by The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the bay cat is seldom seen, rarely photographed and is widely held to be one of the least known of the world’s wild cats. Consequently its distribution is known only poorly, hindering efforts for its conservation. Here we use MaxEnt niche distribution modelling to make predictions regarding its current distribution on Borneo. We collected a total of 71 occurrence records for the bay cat, stemming from all Bornean regions apart from Brunei and South Kalimantan, of which 40 were used in our modelling. Our habitat suitability modelling predicts that an extensive, contiguous area of interior Borneo, much of it hill forest, but also containing lowland and submontane forest, is suitable for the bay cat, supporting an earlier hypothesis that this cat is widespread across the island. Extreme lowlands, supporting ma...\n\nOngoing deforestation in Southeast Asia is leading to increased fragmentation and reduction of habitat for the mainland clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa). Using the largest detection/non-detection camera trap survey dataset known for the species throughout its range, we investigated factors affecting clouded leopard habitat use across Peninsular Malaysia. Habitat use was modelled using fine scale covariates and recently developed analytical techniques to account for spatial autocorrelation. Clouded leopard habitat use increased with increasing distance from water bodies, higher numbers of discontinuous core areas per unit area and higher elevation. In addition , clouded leopard habitat use was higher in sites with higher average forest change values. After extrapolating the predicted habitat use of clouded leopards across the whole of Peninsular Malaysia, we assessed the suitability of proposed ecological linkages, and identified other suitable forest patches not within the current Central Forest Spine. Our findings are valuable for land use planning and management, in particular, for determining the suitability of forest remnants to support populations of clouded leopard and predicting how this species will respond in human-dominated landscapes. Crown\n\nLittle is known about the ecology of the rare marbled cat Pardofelis marmorata on Borneo. In addition, the little information that is available on the species often comes from incidental sightings. Here we use the MaxEnt algorithm to produce a habitat suitability map for this species based on a compilation of existing data. We collected 105 marbled cat occurrence records for Borneo, of which 27 (Balanced Model) or 69 (Spatial Filtering Model) were used to estimate potential habitat suitability. The resulting relative habitat suitability map showed key conservation areas in Borneo. According to these results it appears that the most suitable habitats for marbled cat are lowland forests, but these forests are most threatened by deforestation and other anthropogenic activities. It is imperative to develop appropriate conservation strategies for the marbled cat on Borneo, including long-term research and monitoring, reduction of human disturbances in lowland forests, increased data-shar...\n\nThe leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis is one of the smallest cat species found on Borneo and is the most widely distributed wild cat species in Asia. It is listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Least Concern. The leopard cat is known to tolerate habitat disturbance and to occur in a range of vegetation types including primary and secondary forests, plantations and orchards. However, the extent to which the leopard cat can tolerate habitat disturbance and utilise non-forest areas is still unknown. In this paper, we collected 373 leopard cat location records across Borneo; of these, 228 records were obtained between 2001 and 2011. We analysed 63 (Balanced Model) and 102 (Spatial Filtering Model) records to model habitat suitability. The models predicted more than two-thirds of Borneo to be suitable habitat for the leopard cat. Almost the entire area of Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei and East Kalimantan were predicted to be suitable. The south of Central Kalimantan and the majority of West Kalimantan were predicted to be marginally suitable whereas half of South Kalimantan was predicted to be unsuitable for this species. Although more intensive surveys in Brunei, West Kalimantan and South Kalimantan would help to understand leopard cat distribution, no conservation actions are needed for this species. Abstrak (Bahasa Indonesia). Kucing Kuwuk Prionailurus bengalensis adalah salah satu jenis kucing liar terkecil yang ditemukan di Borneo dan merupakan jenis kucing liar yang sebarannya paling luas di Asia. Terdaftar sebagai jenis Berisiko Rendah (LC) pada Daftar Jenis Terancam Punah IUCN. Kucing Kuwuk diketahui sebagai jenis yang toleran terhadap habitat yang terganggu dan dapat hidup pada berbagai tipe hutan seperti hutan primer dan hutan sekunder serta lahan pertanian dan perkebunan. Namun sampai saat ini belum diketahui sejauh mana Kucing Kuwuk dapat bertahan terhadap gangguan habitat dan memanfaatkan kawasan bukan hutan. Pada penelitian ini kami mengumpulkan 373 catatatan kehadiran Kucing Kuwuk di Borneo, 228 diantaranya merupakan catatan dari tahun 2001-2011. Kami menganalisis 63 (Model Penyeimbang) dan 102 (Model Spasial Tersaring) catatan untuk membuat pemodelan kesesuaian habitat. Hasil pemodelan memprediksi lebih dari 2/3 dari Pulau Borneo sesuai untuk habitat Kucing Kuwuk. Hampir seluruh wilayah Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei, Kalimantan Utara dan Kalimantan Timur diprediksi sangat sesuai untuk habitat Kucing Kuwuk. Bagian Selatan Kalimantan Tengah dan sebagian besar Kalimantan Barat diprediksi sesuai untuk habitat Kucing Kuwuk, sedangkan sebagian Kalimantan Selatan diprediksi tidak sesuai untuk habitat jenis ini. Survey yang lebih intensif diperlukan untuk lebih memahami sebaran Kucing Kuwuk. Abstrak (Bahasa Malaysia). Kucing Batu Prionailurus bengalensis merupakan antara spesis kucing liar terkecil terdapat di Borneo. Kucing ini juga merupakan spesis kucing yang mempunyai taburan yang paling luas di Asia. Ia disenaraikan di dalam Senarai Merah Spesis Terancam IUCN sebagai Kurang Membimbangkan. Kucing Batu diketahui mampu bertolak ansur dengan gangguan habitat dan dapat dijumpai di pelbagai jenis habitat termasuk hutan primer dan sekunder, kawasan ladang, dan kebun. Walaupun demikian, sejauh mana Kucing Batu ini mampu bertahan dalam habitat yang telah diganggu manusia dan menggunakan kawasan bukan hutan masih tidak diketahui. Dalam kajian ini, kami mengumpulkan 373 rekod lokasi di mana Kucing Batu dijumpai di Borneo. Daripada jumlah ini, 228 rekod diperoleh di antara tahun 2001–2011. Kami menganalisis 63 rekod (Model Seimbang) dan 102 rekod (Model yang ditapis secara spasial) untuk membina model kesesuaian habitat. Model yang dibina meramalkan lebih daripada dua pertiga kawasan Borneo sebagai habitat yang sesuai untuk Kucing Batu. Hampir keseluruhan kawasan Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei dan Kalimantan Timur diramalkan sebagai sesuai untuk Kucing Batu. Bahagian selatan Kalimantan Tengah dan sebahagian besar Kalimantan Barat diramalkan sebagai sederhana sesuai manakala separuh daripada Kalimantan Selatan diramalkan tidak sesuai untuk Kucing Batu. Penyelidikan yang lebih terperinci di Brunei, Kalimantan Barat dan Kalimantan Selatan akan membantu untuk memahami taburan Kucing Batu dengan lebih baik. Namun demikian, tiada sebarang tindakan pemuliharaan diperlukan untuk spesis ini.\n\nThe flat-headed cat Prionailurus planiceps is classified as one of the most threatened cat species in the world. Its range is restricted to southern Thailand, peninsular Malaysia and the two largest Sunda Islands, Borneo and Sumatra. Its association with wetlands and lowland areas puts great pressure on this species, because these habitats are most threatened by degradation and agricultural conversions. Borneo has been identified as the stronghold for flat-headed cat. Of 140 flat-headed cat occurrence records for Borneo, 50 (Balanced Model) or 76 (Spatial Filtering Model) were used to estimate potential habitat suitability. Although we predicted suitable habitat for the flat-headed cat scattered across the lowlands of Borneo, some large lowland areas are predicted to be unsuitable, a likely consequence of forest conversion to oil palm plantations. Of particular predicted importance are forests in Brunei Darussalam, the Sabangau National Park and surrounding forest complex in Central...\n\nMost species of wild felids are threatened, but for many little is known about their status in the wild. For the cryptic and elusive Vulnerable Sunda clouded leopard Neofelis diardi, key metrics such as abundance and occupancy have been challenging to obtain. We conducted an intensive survey for this species on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. We deployed camera traps across four study areas that varied in elevation and threats, for a total of 28,404 trap nights, resulting in 114 independent clouded leopard photographs, in which we identified 18 individuals. Using a Bayesian spatially explicit capture–recapture analysis, we estimated clouded leopard density to be 0.8–2.4 individuals/100 km2. The highest predicted occurrence of people was at lower altitudes and closer to the forest edge, where we categorized more than two-thirds of people recorded by camera traps as bird poachers, 12.5% each as ungulate/tiger poachers and non-timber collectors, and &lt; 2% as fishers. Our findings p...\n\nExtensive areas of tropical forests have been, and continue to be, disturbed as a result of selective timber extraction. Although such anthropogenic disturbance typically results in the loss of biodiversity, many species persist, and their conservation in production landscapes could be enhanced by a greater understanding of how biodiversity responds to forest management practices. We conducted intensive camera-trap surveys of eight protected forest areas in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and developed estimates of Sunda clouded leopard Neofelis diardi population density from spatially explicit capture–recapture analyses of detection data to investigate how the species’ abundance varies across the landscape and in response to anthropogenic disturbance. Estimates of population density from six forest areas were 1.39–3.10 individuals per 100 km2. Our study provides the first evidence that the population density of the Sunda clouded leopard is negatively affected by hunting pressure and fores...\n\nThe snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is one of the world&#39;s most elusive felids. In Bhutan, which is one of the 12 countries where the species still persists, reliable information on its distribution and habitat suitability is lacking, thus impeding effective conservation planning for the species. To fill this knowledge gap, we created a country-wide species distribution model using “presence-only” data from 420 snow leopard occurrences (345 from a sign survey and 77 from a camera-trapping survey) and 12 environmental covariates consisting of biophysical and anthropogenic factors. We analyzed the data in an ensemble model framework which combines the outputs from several species distribution models. To assess the adequacy of Bhutan&#39;s network of protected areas and their potential contribution toward the conservation of the species, we overlaid the output of the ensemble model on the spatial layers of protected areas and biological corridors. The ensemble model identified 7,206 k..."
