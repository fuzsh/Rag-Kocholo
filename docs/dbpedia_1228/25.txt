Clouded leopards inhabit wetlands (swamps and forests). They are found from Nepal to southeastern China through Taiwan and Sumatra. In 2007, scientists based on DNA studies concluded that the leopards inhabiting the islands of Sumatra and Borneo should be considered a separate species â€“ the Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi). It differs slightly from the clouded leopards in its colouration and distribution of spots. Its coat has a greyish-brown or yellowish-brown shade. There are irregular cloud-shaped spots all over the body. Often with dark edges. It has an exceptionally long tail that provides balance when climbing trees. Its legs are relatively short, the hind legs longer than the front legs. Sunda clouded leopards can weigh from 12 to 26 kg, males being larger than females.
