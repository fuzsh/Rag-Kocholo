Hyllus diardi is one of the biggest jumping spider in the world.

Females have a 9-15mm body length.

As soon as I tried to take a close macro picture of it, it jumped straight into the lens, probably because it saw its own reflection.

This is a female. The female has all the hairs; the male doesn't.
