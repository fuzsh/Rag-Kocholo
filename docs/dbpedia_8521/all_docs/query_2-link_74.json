        "text": "USA wins 4 more golds on Day 6, total medals now 37\n\nWith gymnastics, swimming, rowing and fencing, the U.S. added four more gold medals on Day 6 of competition at the Paris Games, bringing the USA second behind only China in the number of top medals.\n\nThe U.S. had nine gold medals, and a top 37 medals overall at the end of the day of competition Thursday. China has 11 gold medals and an overall 24.\n\nSimone Biles, Kate Douglass, the U.S. four rowing team, and the women’s team foil won gold medals today.\n\nFrance is third in gold medals, with eight, and has 27 medals overall.\n\nSwimming: A gold, 2 silvers and a record\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nFour more sets of swimming medals were handed out tonight at Paris La Défense Arena.\n\nIn the 200-meter women’s butterfly, Canadian prodigy Summer McIntosh, China’s Zhang Yufei and Smith were considered the favorites with Carmel, Indiana’s Alex Shackell also in the mix.\n\nIt was McIntosh who prevailed to take the gold. The USA's Regan Smith finished second to add another medal to her collection, which now boasts five. She also won silver in the 100 backstroke Tuesday. Zhang took bronze.\n\nThe men’s 200-meter backstroke featured Hungary’s Hubert Kós, Switzerland’s Roman Mityukov and Arizona native Keaton Jones. It was a race most notable for who wasn't there — Ryan Murphy, who won silver in Tokyo, failed to qualify.\n\nJones was shut out of the podium. Kos took gold, Apostolos Christou of Greece the silver, and Mityukov the bronze.\n\nIndiana's Lilly King, a five-time medalist with two golds on her mantle, faced a stiff challenge in the 200-meter breaststroke from South Africa’s Tatjana Smith and Kate Douglass, of Pelham, New York. In the end, Douglass took gold, Smith silver and Tes Schouten of the Netherlands the bronze.\n\nSwimming powerhouses the U.S., Australia, Canada and China faced off in one of the signature races of these games, the 4x200-meter women’s freestyle relay.\n\nAustralia may have won the gold, but Katie Ledecky came out on top with her 13th medal — a silver medal — that cemented her as the most decorated female Olympian.\n\nFor Biles and Lee, two big reasons to celebrate\n\nSimone Biles and Suni Lee celebrated their wins for the women’s gymnastics individual all-around competition. Biles took home a gold medal, while Lee earned a bronze.\n\nThe Ledecky lineup: Another record broken\n\nLedecky became the most decorated U.S. female Olympian of all time with her silver medal win alongside the 4x200-meter freestyle relay team in Paris today.\n\nHere's a reminder of all her hardware:\n\nLondon 2012: Gold in 800m free\n\nRio 2016: Gold in 200m free; gold in 4x200m free relay; gold in 400m free; gold in 800m free; silver in 4x100m free relay\n\nTokyo 2020: Gold in 1500m free; gold in 800m free; silver in 4x200m free relay; silver in 400m free\n\nParis 2024: Gold in 1500m free; silver in 4x200m free relay; bronze in 400m free\n\nFrench manicures on the podium\n\nUpon winning gold and bronze in the all-around today, Simone Biles and Suni Lee shared their Olympic nails, which were a nod to the host country.\n\n\"A little something *french* for today's nail check,\" USA Gymnastics said in a post, along with a photo of the gymnasts' French manicures.\n\nOnce again, Biles comes out on top\n\nSimone Biles has been to the mountaintop, but getting back to the summit is even harder.\n\nIn her third Olympic Games, Biles won the individual all-around gold medal for a second time, reclaiming the 2016 title that etched her name among the sport’s legends.\n\nU.S. gymnasts have taken the individual all-around at the last five Olympics: Athens, Beijing, London, Rio and Tokyo.\n\nToday, Biles added Paris to that storied list.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRebeca Andrade claims all-around silver in final routine\n\nRebeca Andrade of Brazil claimed the silver medal in the women’s gymnastics all-around competition with a stunning final floor routine to wrap up her competition.\n\nRelive the journey of South Korea’s Kim Ye-ji’s winning silver in the women’s air pistol final at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nTeam USA has six pairs of siblings competing together at the Paris Olympics, in sports from field hockey to swimming.\n\nNew York City shows the love for Scruggs after fencing gold\n\nNew York City Hall was lit up in red, white and blue after New York native Lauren Scruggs helped her team win a gold medal in women’s team foil.\n\nScruggs and Lee Kiefer, Jackie Dubrovich and Maia Weintraub beat the Italian team for the top Olympic honor. Scruggs, 21, is from Queens.\n\nThe U.S. women's gold is the first U.S. team gold in the history of the Olympic sport. The U.S. women won silver at the Beijing Games in 2008.\n\nCuban wrestler Mijaín López on a quest for fifth Olympic gold\n\nCuban wrestler Mijaín López began his Olympic journey in 2004 in Athens, where finished fifth. Now, 20 years later in Paris, López hopes to earn his fifth Olympic gold.\n\nFlavor Flav and Reddit's Alexis Ohanian help cover Olympian Veronica Fraley's rent\n\nAhead of her Olympics debut, track and field athlete Veronica Fraley had a more pressing concern on her mind than the Games: paying her rent on time.\n\nFraley, 24, lamented her situation on social media today as she prepared for her women’s discus throw qualification round in Paris.\n\n“I compete in the Olympic Games TOMORROW and can’t even pay my rent” Fraley, the 2024 NCAA discus champion, wrote on X. “my school only sent about 75% of my rent while they pay football players (who haven’t won anything) enough to buy new cars and houses”\n\nHer post quickly drew the attention of rapper Flavor Flav and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who both responded online pledging to help by sending Fraley some money directly.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nReporting from Spring, Texas\n\nSimon Biles and Suni Lee, who won gold and bronze in the women’s gymnastics all-around, are inspiring the next generations of young gymnasts.\n\nThey include a group who watched them perform from Biles’ gym in Spring, Texas.\n\nDespite missing Jimmer Fredette, the U.S. men’s 3x3 basketball team came agonizingly close to an upset of Latvia, but the defending gold medalists scored six unanswered points to snatch a 21-19 win.\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nUkrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh's journey to the Olympics was affected by the ongoing war in her home country.\n\nSwimming: Douglass now has a complete set of Olympic medals\n\nWith her gold medal swim in the 200-meter breaststroke, Kate Douglass has rounded out her Olympic collection.\n\nShe now has a medal in every color.\n\nShe collected a silver in Paris as part of the 4X100 freestyle relay and scored bronze in the 200-meter medley in Tokyo.\n\nBut just because she has one in every color doesn't mean she's done hunting for gold. She competes again Saturday in the 200-meter individual medley.\n\nBreanna Stewart was pivotal in helping the U.S. women’s basketball team pull away late from Belgium, scoring a team-high 26 points and adding seven rebounds and five assists.\n\nDefending all-around Olympic champion Suni Lee dazzled with her uneven bars routine as she chased a second consecutive medal in the women’s all-around gymnastics event.\n\nSnoop's love of the Olympics goes way back\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nOne man having a ball in Paris is none other than Snoop Dogg, the hip-hop great who’s a special NBC Olympics correspondent during the Paris Games.\n\nIt turns out his love of the Olympics goes way back.\n\nMen's gymnastics: All-around finalists Paul Juda and Frederick Richard still celebrating team bronze\n\nA day after Frederick Richard placed 15th in the men's gymnastics all-around final and three days after his team won bronze in the team event, he said he's \"on top of the world\" and \"enjoying the journey.\" He said he's looking forward to representing Team USA in L.A. 2028.\n\nPaul Juda, who was also a part of the team and placed 14th in the all-around, said Richard, his teammate at the University of Michigan, as well, pushes him to do the \"cooler thing\" in his gymnastics.\n\n\"I think bringing back [a bronze medal] is definitely the cooler thing in this regard,\" Juda said.\n\nHe said he'll remember this experience \"for a lifetime.\"\n\nThe pair will be cheering on their teammate Stephen Nederoscik in the pommel horse final Saturday, when he is expected to clinch another medal for the men's gymnastics team.\n\nBeyoncé narrates Simone Biles' journey back to the podium\n\nIf anyone can recognize the greatest of all time, it's Beyoncé.\n\nThe legendary singer offered her voice to Simone Biles, narrating an introduction for the women's all-around gymnastics for NBC. The background music is the song \"Just for Fun,\" from Beyoncé's most recent album.\n\n\"Simone Biles inspires me, and I'm pretty sure she inspires you, too,\" Beyoncé says. \"Such confidence in her strength, such beauty in her power, such a great lesson in her story.\"\n\n\"Brilliance, it doesn't come easy. Gold can be a hell of a journey,\" she continues. \"And the greatest of all time is willing to put that title on the line every time she walks out there.\"\n\nOut of the 594 Team USA athletes in Paris, 11 are also members of the U.S. military. Jimmy Roberts reports on what it means to be an athlete representing the U.S. while also standing ready to defend it.\n\nThe equestrian team jumping competition got off to a hot start this morning during the qualification round.\n\nThe U.S. and Germany soared, while medal favorite Sweden stumbled on its final run.\n\nA silver and an American record for Regan Smith in the 200m butterfly\n\nSummer McIntosh of Canada got the gold in the 200-meter butterfly, but Team USA's Regan Smith claimed silver — and a new American record (2:03.84).\n\nIt is Smith's second straight silver in this event.\n\nShe now has five Olympic medals — four silvers and a bronze.\n\nGet to know Canadian swimmer Summer McIntosh\n\nCareer highlight: She beat Katie Ledecky in a 800-meter freestyle race on Feb. 8, ending the American’s winning streak at that distance, which had gone back to 2010.\n\nGo-to daily dish: Chocolate chip pancakes for predawn breakfast and again for breakfast No. 2 after morning training.\n\nHer name, “Summer,” was inspired by Fox’s teen drama “The O.C.” and Rachel Bilson’s character, though McIntosh said she’s not at all familiar with the show.\n\nThe family has three cats back in Toronto, one of them named “Mikey” in honor of all-time swimming great Michael Phelps.\n\nOlder sister Brooke McIntosh won pairs bronze at the 2022 World Junior Figure Skating Championships. Mother Jill Horstead finished ninth in the 200 butterfly at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nPre-race hype music: Toronto’s own Drake.\n\nRead more about McIntosh's Olympic journey here.\n\nThe Olympic chocolate muffin gains popularity in the village\n\nThe gooey chocolate muffin made famous by Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen has now caught the interest of Olympians across the Olympic Village.\n\nEbony Morrison, a hurdler with Liberia, posted a vlog-style TikTok video going to track down the viral muffin. Morrison noted that she isn't even a fan of chocolate but that after she had one she declared that it was \"bussin\" and a \"quality muffin.\"\n\n\"Yeah, believe the hype,\" Morrison said.\n\nChristiansen posted a video today noting that he had caught his nemesis, the “cookie man,” with a chocolate muffin. Singaporean swimmer Jing Wen Quah told her followers she'd snag a muffin after her races, but in the meantime she's averting her eyes \"so the Norwegian muffin man doesn't appear.\"\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThe Olympics is known for uniting people around the globe, but for the last several years, there’s been a critical ingredient missing … fans! Sam Brock reports on how the Paris Olympics are bringing the celebration back.\n\nMen's rowing: U.S. still riding high from 'incredible' gold medal finsh\n\nMichael Grady and Justin Best celebrate their historic achievement with the U.S. men’s four rowing team and Team USA's first gold medal since 1960.\n\nAndy Murray's career draws to a close after quarterfinal loss to American pair\n\nAnd so the curtain has come down on Andy Murray’s glittering tennis career. Three Grand Slam titles, two Olympic gold medals and 41 weeks as the world No. 1 — all in the greatest era in the history of men’s tennis along with Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.\n\nMurray, 37, signs off as one of Great Britain’s greatest ever sportspeople, with his career drawing to a close this evening after a straight-set loss alongside partner Dan Evans to American pair Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul. The result puts the Americans in the semifinals of the men’s doubles and guarantees that they will play for a medal.\n\nAfter a heartbreaking loss to Federer in the Wimbledon final in 2012, Murray went on to take Olympic gold on the same courts weeks later, capturing the hearts and minds of the British public and a global audience, truly establishing himself as a global icon.\n\nHe went on to claim his maiden Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open that summer, going on to finally win his home slam at Wimbledon twice in 2013 and 2016 before he became the first player ever, male or female, to win back-to-back Olympic singles tennis golds at the 2016 Rio Games.\n\n“I’m proud of my career,” Murray said after the match tonight. “I worked really, really hard to achieve the results I did at a really difficult time to win the major titles. I’m proud. I gave it a good go. How my body has finished up shows I’ve put it through a lot. So I’m looking forward to a rest now.”\n\nMurray is the second of the “big four” to bow out after Federer’s emotional retirement at the Laver Cup in 2022.\n\nSigning off his career with his typical dry British wit, Murray had this to say.\n\nBrittney Griner 'head over heels' for Americans returning home after prisoner swap\n\nReporting from Villeneuve-D'Ascq, France\n\nBrittney Griner knows only too well the swirling emotions of being involved in a prisoner swap, and she said today she is “head over heels” that fellow Americans are going home from Russia.\n\n“Great day. It’s a great day. It’s a great day,” Griner said after the U.S. women’s basketball team beat Belgium 87-74 to clinch a berth in the quarterfinals. “We’ll talk more about it later. But head over heels happy for the families right now. Any day that Americans come home, that’s a win. That’s a win.”\n\nGriner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, went through her own high-profile prisoner exchange with Russia in 2022 after having been sentenced to nine years in jail for drug possession and smuggling that year.\n\nSo Griner was thrilled to hear that Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, a corporate security executive from Michigan, both convicted of espionage charges that the U.S. government considered baseless, were going home.\n\nUSA’s Zhang bows out of badminton round of 16\n\nBeiwen Zhang was the last American standing in the badminton tournament but lost in the round of 16 to Spain’s Carolina Marina.\n\nLightning across Paris pauses beach volleyball, 3x3 basketball\n\nIt's a rain delay in Paris as lightning forces evacuations of the outdoor beach volleyball and 3x3 basketball courts.\n\nTeam USA had just caught up with China in women's beach volleyball when it was forced to stop, delaying the third and final set. Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth rallied to come back from a loss to secure the second set.\n\nMeanwhile, Serbia was leading host country France 13-10 in 3x3 men's basketball when they were forced to stop because of the inclement weather.\n\nWomen's basketball: USA staves off upset bid from Belgium\n\nThe U.S. women’s basketball team held off Belgium, winning 87-74, to move to 2-0 in group play.\n\nThe score belied how close the game was. Belgium competed hard with a U.S. team that has not lost in Olympic play since 1992. Emma Meesseman was arguably the star, bullying her way to 24 points for Belgium.\n\nBut the U.S. still has the best frontcourt in the world. Breanna Stewart and A'ja Wilson combined for 49 points. Wilson had 23 — connecting on 8 of 12 shots after starting 1-for-5.\n\nIt was an impressive effort by the Belgium women, who had the support of the crowd in Lille, which is only a short train ride from Belgium.\n\nThe U.S. next plays Sunday against Germany.\n\nTennis: Star-studded semifinals set for tomorrow\n\nSerbia's 24-time major champion, Novak Djokovic, will face Italy's Lorenzo Musetti in the men's tennis semifinal tomorrow.\n\nMusetti is coming off an impressive performance against Germany's Alexander Zverev. He defeated Zverev, the world's current No. 4, in straight sets today, 7-5, 7-5. Musetti is looking to continue his form this summer after advancing to the Wimbledon semifinals in July.\n\nDjokovic has faced a challenging path in Paris, defeating Rafael Nadal in round 2 and Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals, 6-3, 7-6. Djokovic is looking for a strong result after losing the men's Wimbledon final to Carlos Alcaraz of Spain.\n\nBoth men are aiming for their first gold medal. Djokovic won bronze in the 2008 Olympics. Meanwhile, Musetti is participating in his first career Olympics in Paris.\n\nThe other side of the bracket will feature two more youngsters, as Alcaraz, 21, and 23-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada will fight for a spot in the finals.\n\nAlcaraz is the youngest man to reach the singles semifinals at the Olympics since Djokovic in Beijing in 2008. Auger-Aliassime is the first Canadian to reach the semifinals in singles in Olympic history.\n\nWomen's basketball: Belgium is hanging around!\n\nBelgium is giving USA everything it can handle through three quarters.\n\nU.S. leads 60-53 after three in what’s been a highly competitive game.\n\nBreanna Stewart and A'ja Wilson have combined for 33 points, but no other American player has scored in double figures. Meanwhile, Emma Meesseman has been an absolute beast inside for Belgium, leading all scorers with 20 points on 9-of-13 shooting.\n\nShould be an exciting finish!\n\nKatie Ledecky claims 13th medal, most-ever for a female Olympian, with relay silver\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nAmerican women took silver in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay, putting an all-time record 13th medal around the neck of living legend Katie Ledecky.\n\nThe team of Ledecky, Claire Weinstein, Paige Madden and Erin Gemmell placed second, bested only by Australia as the mighty Dolphins turned in an Olympic-record time of 7:38.08.\n\nChina took bronze. Three years ago in Tokyo, China recorded the best time in Olympics history.\n\nNo woman has won more medals than Ledecky, though active Australian swimmer Emma McKeon has 12. Retired U.S. greats Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin also have a dozen.\n\nBasketball: USA opens up halftime lead over Belgium\n\nAfter ending the first quarter in a tie, USA leads Belgium 46-38 at the half.\n\nThe States led by as many as 13 in the second period. Breanna Stewart leads the team with 15 points. After a slow start, A'ja Wilson scored six points in the second, hitting three of her five field-goal attempts.\n\nThe U.S. isn’t bullying Belgium as easily as they did Japan. The two-headed center monster of Emma Meesseman and Kyara Linskens has held its own, combining for 18 points for Belgium.\n\nBasketball: USA, Belgium deadlocked after first quarter\n\nBelgium is giving the U.S. women’s basketball team a battle after one quarter.\n\nThe teams are tied at 23 after 10 minutes.\n\nThe size advantage the women had against Japan isn’t as extreme vs. Belgium. While Breanna Stewart is dominating in the frontcourt with 11 early points, A'ja Wilson is still finding her footing — she has four points on only 1-of-5 shooting.\n\nBelgium has had a balanced attack, with four of their five starters scoring at least four points\n\nLedecky set to break another record\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThe U.S. women’s 4x200m freestyle relay is expected to win a medal tonight. If that happens, Katie Ledecky breaks her tie for the most women’s swimming medals (currently 12 with Americans Natalie Coughlin, Dara Torres and Jenny Thompson and Australian Emma McKeon) and most medals for an American woman in any sport (12 with Coughlin, Torres and Thompson).\n\nThat would set Ledecky up in Saturday’s 800m freestyle final to break her tie with Thompson for the most Olympic gold medals for an American woman in any sport and to tie the record for Olympic gold medals for any woman in any sport with Larisa Latynina, a Soviet gymnast who won nine golds in the 1950s and ‘60s.\n\nHungary’s Hubert Kos rallies for gold in 200 backstroke\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nHungary’s Hubert Kos won his first Olympic medal by winning the 200-meter backstroke with a strong final 50.\n\nKos had to rally past upset-minded silver medalist Apostolos Christou of Greece, who completed the first 100 in 28.75 while the eventual winner Kos hit the halfway point at 29.24.\n\nSwitzerland’s Roman Mityuko took bronze and Arizona native Keaton Jones finished fifth.\n\nBefore this race, at least one American had medaled in the event since 1992. Ryan Murphy, who won silver in Tokyo, failed to qualify on Wednesday.\n\nCanada's Summer McIntosh wins 200 butterfly\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nCanadian wunderkind Summer McIntosh won her second gold medal of the Games, winning a power-packed 200-meter butterfly race in Olympic-record time.\n\nAmerican Regan Smith grabbed silver and defending Olympic champ Zhang Yufei took bronze.\n\nEarlier in these Games, the 17-year-old McIntosh struck gold in the 400 IM and silver in the 400 free.\n\nThe Canadian prodigy's 2:03.03 in the 200 fly bested Zhang's previous mark of 2:03.86 which she set in Tokyo.\n\nSimone Biles clinches second individual all-around gold medal\n\nand\n\nShe did it again.\n\nAfter having to pull out of the individual all-around event in Tokyo due to struggles with the \"twisties,\" Biles has regained her gold-medal status just days after she led Team USA to a gold medal in the team event.\n\nBiles is now the owner of six Olympic gold medals and has become the first gymnast to win two Olympic all-around championships nonconsecutively. No American has won the Olympic all-around more than once.\n\nRebeca Andrade of Brazil — and Biles' top competition — walked away with silver, the same place she finished in Tokyo in the all-around.\n\nAnd American Suni Lee took home the bronze, in perhaps the most cutthroat fight of the day, since Biles and Andrade were highly favored to go one and two.\n\nFencing: Japan wins bronze medal in women's foil team match\n\nJapan defeated Canada in women's foil team fencing to win a bronze medal.\n\nAfter an even contest between both teams in the first four rounds, the fifth proved to be decisive for Japan, opening a margin it never relinquished.\n\nCanada had a comeback in Round 6 led by Eleanor Harvey cutting the deficit to 20-17.\n\nThe final round was the closest, with Canada's Harvey at one point cutting Japan's lead to just 1 against Yuka Ueno. Japan ultimately hung on for the win, with a final score of 33-32.\n\nLee’s floor exercise guarantees her a medal\n\nThe reigning all-around champ just finished up the event final for the second time in her career.\n\nShe needed to give the best floor routine of her career (with a score of at least 13.535) to pull ahead of D’Amato and get into bronze medal position.\n\nShe scored a 13.666, which guarantees her another Olympic all-around medal, following up her gold in Tokyo on the same event.\n\nLee flashed a huge smile after she stuck her first tumbling pass, an indicator of what was to come.\n\nGymnastics: Just one event left\n\nThese women have just one more chance to prove they’re worthy of a medal.\n\nAfter three rotations, here is who would be topping the podium:\n\nSimone Biles (USA)\n\nRebeca Andrade (Brazil)\n\nAlice D’Amato (Italy)\n\nFollow full coverage here.\n\n3x3 Basketball: USA falls to 0-3\n\nThe U.S. men’s 3x3 basketball team is now an ignominious 0-3 after a loss to Lithuania on Thursday.\n\nIt was a tight battle, as Lithuania held on for a 20-18 win as time expired. Jimmer Fredette, the former BYU star hoping to recapture basketball glory at the Paris Games, didn’t play as the U.S. changed up its lineup from its first two contests.\n\nOutside shooting continues to be a problem for the States. While USA dominated inside the arc, Lithuania hit four 2-pointers as opposed to the U.S.’s one. With those baskets worth double, the 2-point line becomes an even bigger game changer in 3x3 hoops.\n\nThe U.S. will have another chance to record its first win, against Latvia, at 5:05 p.m. ET.\n\nFencing: Japan and Canada remain tied after competitive 3 rounds\n\nAs we near the halfway point, Canada vs. Japan has been a balanced contest thus far.\n\nAfter a competitive opening round, Japan's Karin Miyawaki faced off against Canada's Eleanor Harvey in Round 2. Both had even performances, leaving the score tied at 5-5.\n\nIn Round 3, Japan's Sera Azuma dueled Canada's Yunja Zhang. Both fencers had even touches at 5 each. Entering Round 4, the score remains tied at 10-10.\n\nFencing: Japan and Canada tied at 3-3 after Round 1\n\nThe first matchup had Japan's Yuka Ueno facing Canada's Jessica Ji Zia. The evenly competitive first round ends with a tied score of 3-3.\n\nGymnastics: Rebeca Andrade leading women’s all-around final\n\nAfter two of four rotations in the women’s gymnastics all-around final, Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade is in the lead, with Kaylia Nemour from Algeria in second, behind by .2 points.\n\nSimone Biles is trailing in third by .267 points after executing a below-average bars routine.\n\nBiles and Andrade are expected to go one and two in today's final.\n\nAlice D'Amato and Suni Lee are in fourth and fifth — and both are considered high contenders to medal today, as well.\n\nBiles and Lee will both close out the contest with the ever-tricky balance beam up next then will head to the floor, where Lee will contend on the event for the last time this Games.\n\nGymnastics: Here's who is leading halfway through\n\nTwo rotations down, two rotations to go.\n\nCurrently, at the top of the leaderboard:\n\nRebeca Andrade (Brazil)\n\nKaylia Nemour (Algeria)\n\nSimone Biles (USA)\n\nBiles and Lee — along with Andrade — head to the ever-difficult beam next.\n\nFollow full coverage here.\n\nFencing: Japan and Canada square off for bronze medal\n\nIn just moments, Japan and Canada will face off in the women's foil team fencing match for bronze.\n\nCanada is coming off a strong performance against the United States earlier today, while Japan enters the match after narrowly losing to Italy.\n\nGymnastics: After Rotation 1, here are the top 3\n\nAfter the first rotation, the current standings are:\n\nSimone Biles (USA)\n\nRebeca Andrade (Brazil)\n\nElsabeth Black (Canada)\n\nDon’t pay too much attention to where everyone stands right now, though. These gymnasts each have three more chances to prove they’re worthy of a gold medal.\n\nFollow full coverage here.\n\nTable tennis: China's Fan Zhendong advances to semifinals\n\nChina’s Fan Zhendong, 27, advanced to the men’s singles semifinals after mounting an impressive comeback against Tomokazu Harimoto, 21, of Japan.\n\nZhendong, who lost the first two games, won the next two before falling short again in Game 6. The final Game 7 offered a tense back-and-forth, which Zhendong ultimately pulled away to win 11-7.\n\nZhendong, nicknamed Xiao Pang or “Little Fatty,” plays an attacking style with a shakehand grip. He won the silver medal in men’s singles, as well as team gold, at the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nHis semifinals appearance will be Aug. 2 at either 5:00 p.m. ET or 8:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe women’s gymnastics all-around final starts now\n\nAnd we’re live! It’s officially go time for Biles and Lee, who will face each other — and the 22 other top gymnasts — for the gold in the individual all-around final.\n\nAside from our Team USA reigning champs (Biles won gold in this event in Rio and Lee won it in Tokyo), keep an eye on Rebeca Andrade (Brazil), Kaylia Nemour (Algeria) and Qiu Qiyuan (China), who are all in contention to medal as well.\n\nThe real showdown will be between Biles and Andrade, who will be battling for the top spot in today’s meet.\n\nFollow full coverage here.\n\nTemperatures in Paris have been a ‘hot’ topic for days at the Olympic Games\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nFor archers competing at the famed gardens of Les Invalides, the searing conditions weren’t only impacting their performance. Several broadcasters at the top of the stands were taking cover — quite literally — under umbrellas as they shielded themselves from the sun. Sounds of play-by-play commentary wafted above the cheers … leading us to turn our heads and find the broadcasters hard at work.\n\nStruggles continue for Team USA 3x3 basketball teams\n\nTeam USA's 3x3 women's basketball team fell to 0-3 after a 17-15 loss to Australia on Thursday morning. The U.S., which previously lost to Azerbaijan and Germany, now sits dead last in its group of eight teams.\n\nIt will have to get in the winner's circle soon, because only the top two teams qualify for the semifinals and the next four qualify for the play-in games. The women will face Spain later Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, the men's 3x3 team isn't faring too well either. Jimmer Fredette and Co. are 0-2 and take on Lithuania in a must-win matchup later today.\n\nAustralian swimmer says he's tested positive for Covid\n\nAustralian swimmer Zac Stubblety-Cook revealed Wednesday shortly after winning silver in the men’s 200-meter breaststroke that he had tested positive for Covid.\n\nCook is the latest to join a growing number of athletes who’ve tested positive, including British swimming star Adam Peaty, who announced his diagnosis less than 24 hours after winning silver in the 100-meter breaststroke on Monday.\n\nAustralia’s Lani Pallister withdrew just hours before the Women’s 1500 freestyle on Tuesday, opting to “save her energy” for Thursday’s 4x200 freestyle relay instead, according to the Australian Olympic Committee. As of now, Pallister is expected to compete in today’s relay this afternoon.\n\nThis brings the total number of athletes confirmed with Covid to nine, including at least five Australian water polo players who tested positive prior to the Games’ kickoff.\n\nDespite the apparent surge in infections, the Paris Olympics have no stringent protocols or preventive measures in place, according to French newspaper Le Monde.\n\nAmerican men win beach volleyball\n\nAmerican duo Miles Partain and Andy Benesh won their match today against Brazil to close out preliminaries in men's beach volleyball.\n\nPartain and Benesh will now await the results of later matches on Thursday to learn if they've advanced to the round of 16.\n\nPartain, 22, is the USA’s youngest beach volleyball player to ever compete at an Olympic Games. Benesh, 28, is among the tallest, standing 6-foot-8.\n\nWhy table tennis is exploding in popularity at 2024 Olympics\n\nTable tennis has provided viewers with dramatic moments and nail-biting matches throughout the Paris Games, and it’s continuing to explode in popularity. Willie Geist joins \"TODAY\" to take his shot with Team USA’s Rachel Sung.\n\nTeam USA soccer stars talking being in the spotlight at Olympics\n\nBoth of Team USA’s men’s and women’s soccer squads have advanced to the knockout stage, with the men’s team doing it for the first time in more than two decades. Players Benjamin Cremaschi, Caleb Wiley and Gabriel “Gaga” Slonina join “TODAY” to talk about the young team’s performance and playing in the summer heat.\n\nWomen at the Games: Paris 2024 vs. Paris 1924\n\nParis 2024 has made history as the first Olympic Games with an equal number of male and female competitors.\n\nThat makes quite a difference since the last time the French city hosted the Games, in 1924, when the International Olympic Committee more or less excluded women from competing.\n\nThe 135 female athletes, representing less than 5% of the 3,089 competitors, were restricted to swimming, diving, tennis and fencing events.\n\nIn response to the exclusion, several women-only games were independently held, starting in 1921 in Monte Carlo.\n\nAt the 1928 Amsterdam Games, the IOC allowed female athletes to compete in gymnastics and some track-and-field events, but later banned women from all track races over 200 meters (the restriction lasted until 1960).\n\nAs recently as the 1984 Los Angeles Games, when swimming and rhythmic gymnastics made their debuts and the women’s marathon was first held, less than a quarter of the competitors were women.\n\nToday, the IOC, which has a mostly male executive board, concedes that a gender gap still exists for officials and coaches at Paris 2024. The organization says that it continues to actively promote gender equality within the Olympic movement.\n\nWhy are there different Olympic medal counts? What to know about the tally\n\nTeam USA has dominated the 2024 Paris Olympics — at least by some metrics.\n\nAmerican media organizations — including NBC News, The New York Times and The Associated Press — rank nations based on their number of medals overall. By that measurement, the U.S. led the field as of 4 p.m. ET Wednesday, with 30 medals total, according to standings on the NBC Olympics website.\n\nBut some countries and organizations outside America sort nations based on their number of gold medals. By that standard, China topped the chart as of 4 p.m. ET, with eight gold medals. The U.S. was in seventh place, with five gold medals. Google is following suit in search results.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTable tennis: 17-year-old sensation advances to semifinals\n\nFélix Lebrun, France's 17-year-old table tennis sensation, advanced to the men's singles semifinals following a dramatic win over Yun-Ju Lin, 22, of Chinese Taipei.\n\nThe match, which went the maximum seven games, ping-ponged back and forth with the players trading wins for the first six rounds. But Lin couldn't overcome Lebrun's lightning-hot Game 7 start, opening with seven unanswered points. The game ended 11-6.\n\nLebrun, who plays with the traditional and largely abandoned \"penhold grip,\" has been described by The Wall Street Journal as the \"LeBron James\" of table tennis.\n\nHis semifinals appearance will be Aug. 2 at either 5:00 p.m. ET or 8:30 p.m. ET.\n\nBMX and canoe slalom medalists join ‘TODAY’\n\nTeam USA medalists Perris Benegas and Evy Leibfarth celebrated their medals with “TODAY” live in Paris.\n\nBenegas won silver in BMX freestyle, and Leibfarth took home bronze in canoe slalom (her coach is her dad!).\n\nThey were joined by Public Enemy co-founder Flavor Flav, “official hype man” of the U.S. women’s water polo team.\n\nManu Bhaker becomes first Indian with two medals in same Games\n\nSharpshooter Manu Bhaker has become the first Olympic athlete from India to win two medals in the same Games. Bhaker, 22, won bronze in both the women’s 10-meter air pistol and later the mixed team event with Sarabjot Singh.\n\nAs of Thursday, India has three medals, with another bronze in men’s 50-meter shooting from Swapnil Kusale.\n\nScottie Scheffler finishes four under par in first round of men's golf\n\nTeam USA's Scottie Scheffler is back in the clubhouse at Le Golf National having carded a solid, if unspectacular, opening round score of four under par in the men's golf competition.\n\nScheffler is making his Olympic debut in Paris and got his round off to the perfect start, with a birdie on the first hole and further birdies at holes three and nine. But it was a frustrating putting day for the American, with several wayward birdie putts throughout the back nine seeing him fail to gain momentum. It was ultimately a bogey-free round, though, and Scheffler will certainly remain in contention as the competition heads to the second of four rounds tomorrow. A 26-foot putt on the 17th finished off a decent round for the world No. 1.\n\nHe is currently four strokes behind the current leader, Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama, the 2021 Masters champion. Matsuyama has the clubhouse lead at eight under par. Ireland's Rory McIlroy, who was paired with Scheffler, sits at three under.\n\nXander Schauffle is still out on the course and is currently two shots off the lead. He is six under after 13 holes.\n\n‘I couldn’t go anywhere without getting mobbed’: Gabby Douglas and Nastia Liukin recall joining Olympic gymnastics royalty\n\nAthens, Beijing, London, Rio and Tokyo.\n\nFor five straight Olympic Games, American women have topped the all-around podium in gymnastics, cementing their names in the sport’s most exclusive club.\n\nIn the 20 years since the U.S. women’s gold-medal streak in the Olympic all-around began, the sport and the lives of those who reach its loftiest heights have evolved significantly.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nSailing: Men’s skiff postponed\n\nThe final of men’s skiff has been postponed midrace because of insufficient wind.\n\nThat's actually good news for the U.S. team of Ian Barrows and Hans Henken, who were slow at the start and struggled to get into the race.\n\nThere's been no indication from the race committee yet when the final will be rescheduled.\n\nSimone Biles and Suni Lee to face off in all-around final\n\nStraight off their gold-medal win in the women’s gymnastics team final, Simone Biles and Suni Lee will compete against each other in the all-around final.\n\nAn American has won gold in this event at each of the last five Olympics, but this is the first time in the history of the sport that two former champions will go head-to-head. NBC’s Kaylee Hartung reports for \"TODAY.\"\n\nJapanese rider celebrates country's first equestrian medal in 92 years with the horse that helped him win\n\nIn equestrian, a rider certainly cannot win a medal without their horse, and for Japanese rider Yoshiaki Oiwa, he certainly wanted to share the moment with the steed that helped deliver the silverware.\n\nTake a look at this adorable selfie taken by Oiwa with the bronze medal the pair won in the team evening competition — the country's first equestrian medal at the Olympics since 1932.\n\nAlgerian boxer previously barred from women’s event wins opening match\n\nAn Algerian boxer who was previously barred from a women’s event over chromosome-based gender testing won a preliminary-round match against an Italian opponent.\n\nImane Khelif, who failed to meet eligibility tests at the Women’s World Boxing Championships in New Delhi last year, defeated Italian Angela Carini in 46 seconds today after Carini abandoned the bout.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Carini's headgear twice became dislodged during the brief square-off, and she refused to shake Khelif’s hand after the unusual finish to the match as she cried in the ring before leaving.\n\nKhelif previously won a silver medal at the International Boxing Association’s 2022 world championships, but that same organization disqualified her in a year later just prior to a gold-medal match over what it said were elevated testosterone levels. Khelif has not identified as transgender.\n\nNBC News previously reported that the International Olympic Committee officially cleared all athletes participating in this year's boxing events.\n\nBig upset at Roland Garros as Iga Swiatek beaten in semifinals\n\nIga Swiatek is the world women's tennis No. 1 and she's by far the world's most dominant player on clay courts — she's won the last three French Open titles at Roland Garros. But she will not be the Olympic champion after suffering a shock defeat to China's Zheng Qinwen in straight sets.\n\nAfter Zheng, who reached the Australian Open final earlier this year, took the opening set 6-2, gold medal favorite Swiatek looked to be back on track after racing into a 4-0 lead in the second. But the momentum quickly swung away from her and Zheng’s rattled off four straight games, breaking Swiatek’s serve twice and leveling things up.\n\nAnother break for Zheng at 5-5 put her on the brink of one of the biggest wins of her career. After surviving a break point to take the second set 7-5, Zheng collapsed onto her back, screaming into the air in pure elation.\n\nZheng, who is the first Chinese player to reach the gold medal match of the singles at the Olympics, will play for gold against the winner of tonight’s match between Wimbledon semifinalist Donna Vekic and Anna Karolina Schmeidlova. Poland’s Swiatek will still have a shot at the bronze medal.\n\nSwimming: Team USA's Casas, Foster progress alongside Marchand in 200m IM heats\n\nTeam USA's Shaine Casas and Carson Foster are safely through to tomorrow's semifinals of the men's 200m individual medley alongside France's Leon Marchand.\n\nMarchand, France's poster boy for these Games, was back in the pool after winning golds in the 200 butterfly and 200 breaststroke last night. In doing so, he became the first male swimmer to win two individual golds on the same day since Australia's Freddie Lane did so in the 1900 Olympics.\n\nThe Frenchman will be hoping to go 4 for 4 with gold in the 200 IM, with further medal opportunities potentially to follow in two medley relays.\n\nTeam USA has qualified fourth fastest for tonight's 4x200 freestyle relay, having rested Katie Ledecky following her gold in the 1500 freestyle last night. She will almost certainly race in tonight's final.\n\nCaeleb Dressel squeezed through to the semifinals of the 50 freestyle — his time of 21.91 got him through in joint-13th.\n\nPhoebe Bacon and Regan Smith qualified as well for the women's semifinals of the 200 backstroke, placing 4th and 6th respectively.\n\nFrench, Israeli authorities keep security high during Paris Games\n\nEven before Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran on Wednesday, Israel’s foreign minister had warned France about the potential threat posed by Iran and its proxies to the country’s Olympics team in Paris in light of the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael’s secret intelligence service Mossad said in May that Iran had stepped up efforts ahead of the Games to target Israelis overseas. Israel has its own security teams in Paris, and NBC News has reported that officers from the Shin Bet, the country’s internal security service, are protecting the Olympic delegation.\n\nFrance’s domestic intelligence service, meanwhile, has identified those national teams and competition events that it deemed at additional risk, and the country's security services have put in place extra measures around Israel’s delegation.\n\nIsraeli athletes and officials are protected around the clock by France's elite GIGN tactical police unit, which specializes in counterterrorism and hostage operations. It was formed in 1974 after 11 Israelis died at the Munich Olympics following an attack by a Palestinian militant group.\n\nSeparately, prosecutors in France have been investigating death threats received last week by several Israeli athletes, as well as the publication online of athletes’ personal data.\n\nSailing: U.S. in medal contention\n\nAmerica’s Ian Barrows and Hans Henken are competing today in the first medal event in sailing, the men’s skiff.\n\nThe duo are in fourth place heading into the final, which is scheduled to start at 8:40 a.m. ET.\n\nThe U.S. team of Stephanie Roble and Maggie Shea are in the women's skiff final at 9:43 a.m. ET, and occupy the 10th spot.\n\nThe U.S. has not won a medal in sailing since 2016.\n\nCurrent wind conditions off Marseille are about 10 knots, forecast to increase to a moderate 15 knots by race time.\n\nWorld No. 1 archer Casey Kaufhold stunned in round-of-32 upset\n\nand\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nAmerican Casey Kaufhold, the world's top-ranked archer, was knocked out in a shocking round-of-32 upset by Lei Chien-ying from Chinese Taipei.\n\nKaufhold's 7-3 loss to the world No. 36 ended hopes for an American woman to reach the podium for the first time since 1976.\n\nHer U.S. teammates, Boston's Jennifer Mucino and San Diego's Catalina GNoriega have also been eliminated.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nTeam USA 3x3 men's and women's basketball teams on the brink of crashing out\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nBoth the U.S. men's and women's 3x3 basketball teams have gotten off to nightmare starts in their respective Olympic tournaments and might be running out of time to turn it around.\n\nThe 0-3 American women, who took gold in Tokyo, have dropped games to Germany, Azerbaijan and moments ago to Australia. They can still contend for a medal but have a narrow margin for error.\n\nThe U.S. men, who didn't qualify for Tokyo but were expected to challenge for a medal here, are 0-2, with losses to Tokyo bronze medalist Serbia and then Poland.\n\nBoth the men’s and women’s teams are in eight-team tournaments, playing a round robin of seven games. The top two teams in the group move straight to the semifinals, while teams ranked third through sixth face playoffs to determine the remaining two places. The U.S. women's team is currently eighth.\n\nThe U.S. men play twice on Thursday, first against Lithuania at 1:05 p.m. ET and 7:05 p.m. local time, before taking on reigning gold medalists Latvia at 4:05 p.m. ET and 10:05 p.m. local time. Team USA's women have one game left today, against Spain at 3:30 p.m. ET and 9:30 p.m. local time.\n\nArchery: American Ellison advances and praises the 'amazing' crowds\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nAmerican Brady Ellison easily won his round of 32 match in archery at Les Invalides on a bright and sunny day — in front of stands seating around 7,400 people.\n\nIt appears to be the largest live audience for an archery competition and quite a contrast from Tokyo, when Ellison came in as the top seed but failed to win a medal when he lost to the eventual gold medalist Mete Gazoz in the quarterfinals.\n\nOn whether there’s less pressure and the differences in Paris?\n\n“I mean Tokyo was kind of like an Olympic jail, right? We weren’t allowed to do anything.”\n\n“The people make the Olympics, not the venues. The crowds make it. You want to come out here and perform for the people … and this crowd is amazing.”\n\nHe has another match coming up shortly for a spot in the quarterfinals.\n\nWhat makes Katie Ledecky so great?\n\nAfter winning gold in her signature 1500-meter freestyle event last night, Katie Ledecky will aim to make history tonight by winning a record 13th Olympic medal in the 4x200 freestyle relay. That would make her the most successful female American Olympian of all time.\n\nNBC swimming analyst Rowdy Gaines takes a look at what makes Ledecky so dominant.\n\nTurkey's nonchalant sharpshooter wins silver without high-tech aids\n\nAt Olympic shooting events, you'll usually see competitors using a big pair of ear protectors and fancy lenses to help them aim. But Turkey's Yusuf Dikec didn't need any of that during Tuesday's mixed air pistol team event — all he needed was his humble pair of prescription glasses.\n\nThe 51-year-old Dikec strolled up to the shooting line without the fancy gizmos of his rivals. What he did next has taken the internet by storm.\n\nWith the relaxed insouciance of a man waiting for a bus, the Turkish athlete placed his left hand in his pocket and coldly took his shots as he helped his country to silver. Dikec and his partner were ultimately beaten to gold by Serbia, but the man's casual aura will surely be unmatched throughout the rest of the Games.\n\nSouth Korea's Kim Yeji also went viral earlier in the Olympics with her shooting style as she took silver in the women's individual 10-meter air pistol event.\n\nLauren Scruggs on her fencing silver and making Olympic history\n\nAmerican Lauren Scruggs made history at the Paris Olympics on Sunday when she took the silver medal in women’s foil fencing.\n\nScruggs, from Queens, New York, became the first Black American woman and the first Black out lesbian to win an individual fencing medal.\n\nShe described the experience as \"surreal\" and said she hopes her medal shows other people that fencing, which has historically lacked diversity, \"is for you.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTeam USA wins historic rowing gold in men's four\n\nTeam USA has claimed its first gold medal in the men's four since the 1960 Rome Olympics. It is Team USA's sixth gold medal of the Games.\n\nIn a nail-biting race, the U.S. and New Zealand were largely even throughout, but a final surge in the last 200 meters saw Team USA take the gold. World champions Great Britain were the favorites, but an awful start saw them languish behind, eventually recovering to take bronze.\n\nThe American quad consisted of Michael Grady, who was the lone returnee from the boat that finished fifth in this event in Tokyo, alongside Liam Corrigan, Justin Best and Nick Mead — all of whom competed in the eight boat in Tokyo. The group had won silver at last year's World Championships, and it has now added Olympic gold.\n\nU.S. Rowing made big changes after failing to medal in rowing in Tokyo for the first time ever. New technical director Josy Verdonkshot's more data-driven approach has paid instant rewards, with other U.S. boats also going strong at these Games. Team USA also finished fifth in the women's four final earlier, with the Netherlands edging out Great Britain for gold.\n\nBullied as a kid, Jennifer Lozano responded with a boxing career\n\nU.S. boxer Jennifer Lozano started thinking about how far the sport could take her at 9 years old in Laredo, Texas. When she secured her spot in the 2024 Paris Olympics at October’s Pan American Games, she finally realized a dream years in the making.\n\n“That was surreal. I just couldn’t believe what was right in my hand,” she told NBC News. “Something I was working so hard for. Something I had dreamt of for so long for years since I was a kid and everything I had to go through just to be here.”\n\nBut getting to this point wasn’t easy. Lozano, who fights Finland's Pihla Kaivo-oja later today, was often teased in school for her weight and her Spanish accent, even though she lived in a city where about 90% of the population speaks Spanish at home. When she sought advice about how to handle bullying, she turned to the person she trusted the most: her grandmother.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nJust what is that odd-looking Paris Olympics mascot?\n\nMany Paris Olympics fans have wondered just what the smiling red mascot of the Games is. Well, wonder no more.\n\nTennis: America's last man standing faces Carlos Alcaraz\n\nTommy Paul is the last American standing in the men's tennis singles at Roland Garros, and now he faces one of the most daunting tasks in the sport — taking on Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nSpain's Alcaraz is one of the favorites for gold in Paris after winning both the French Open and Wimbledon over the last few months. Alcaraz beat Paul in the Wimbledon quarterfinals last month and will be the favorite to take down Paul on the clay at Roland Garros.\n\nBut the American is in strong form and has won each of his three singles matches so far at the Olympics in straight sets. Paul and Alcaraz are second up on Roland Garros' central court today, getting underway at 8 a.m. ET.\n\nThe American is due to perform double duty today — he is also due to team up with Taylor Fritz in the men's doubles as they take on Great Britain's Andy Murray and Dan Evans tonight. Other notable matches include Novak Djokovic taking on Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas tonight and women's world No. 1 Iga Swiatek taking on China's Qinwen Zheng.\n\nChina wins women's race walking, bagging its 11th gold of the Games\n\nChina has extended its lead at the top of the gold medal table after taking its 11th gold of the Games in the women's 20k race walk.\n\nIn sweltering conditions where many racers opted to wear ice towels around their necks, China's Yang Jiayu led for over half of the race as she took the top spot on the podium by a comfortable 25-second margin ahead of Spain's Maria Perez. Australia's Jemina Montag took bronze.\n\nChina claims another shooting gold\n\nChina has claimed a third shooting gold of the Games, with Yukun Liu taking victory in this morning's men's 50-meter rifle three-position event.\n\nUkraine's Serhiy Kulish took silver, with Swapnil Kusale winning bronze to secure India's third medal of these Olympics.\n\nKatie Ledecky wins 1,500-meter freestyle and 8th gold medal\n\nTeam USA’s Katie Ledecky won her signature event at the Paris Olympics, the 1,500-meter freestyle, earning her eighth Olympic gold medal. French swimming superstar Leon Marchand won his second gold. And the men’s and women’s triathlons were held after the water quality of the Seine was deemed safe enough.\n\nTrack and field gets underway as Ecuador takes race walking gold\n\nThe first medals of Day 6 of the Olympics have already been handed out, with Ecuador's Brian Daniel Pintado taking gold in the men's 20km race walk.\n\nPintado pulled away from the rest of the field with 2 kilometers to go, and the Ecuadorian pulled out Cristiano Ronaldo's signature \"siuuu\" celebration as he crossed the line. Silver went to Brazil's Caio Bonfim, who finished 14 seconds behind, and bronze went to Spain's Alvaro Martin.\n\nThose race walking medals are the first of the Paris Games track-and-field events. The main difference between race walking and running is that athletes must have one foot in contact with the ground at all times, with time penalties if that rule is broken.\n\nThe women's race is now underway — Team USA did not qualify for either event.\n\nLightning strikes over Paris\n\nA bolt of lightning strikes during a storm in Paris this morning over an Eiffel Tower adorned with the Olympic rings.\n\nMen's golf underway with hopes high of an American gold\n\nWith Americans sweeping all four golf majors this season, hopes are high for an American gold as Xander Schauffele looks to defend the Olympic title over the next four days at Paris' Le Golf National.\n\nSchauffele has already won the PGA Championship and the Open this season, becoming the first player since 2018 to win two majors in the same year. Fellow Americans Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau, who is not at the Olympics, took the Masters and the U.S. Open respectively.\n\nScheffler, the world No. 1, will also be a medal favorite in Paris, having won six tournaments across a brilliant 2024. Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa round off Team USA's four-strong team.\n\nElsewhere in the field, Ireland's Rory McIlroy will be looking for redemption following his brutal collapse at the U.S. Open in June and after missing the cut at the Open a fortnight ago. He'll be determined for redemption here. Great Britain's Tommy Fleetwood and Spain's Jon Rahm have good records at Le Golf National and could also be among the podium chasers.\n\nParis 2024 Olympics Day 6: Here's what to look out for.\n\nGood morning! It's Day 6 of the 2024 Paris Olympics. We've got a bumper day of gold medal events for you today, with 18 gold medals up for grabs over the course of the day.\n\nPerhaps most exciting for our readers stateside will be the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final, where Team USA's Simone Biles will be looking to add to her haul. That's at 12:15 p.m. ET and 6:15 p.m. local time.\n\nThe USA's swimming team also competes. For the women, Katie Ledecky and the rest of Team USA race in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay at 4:03 p.m. ET and 10:03 p.m. local time. Before that, Regan Smith races in the 200 butterfly at 2:30 p.m. ET and 8:30 p.m. local time. Kate Douglass races for the 200 breaststroke medal at 3:11 p.m. ET and 9:11 p.m. local time.\n\nIn men's swimming, Keaton Jones is perhaps Team USA's best hope in the 200 backstroke event at 2:38 p.m. ET and 8:38 p.m. local time.\n\nIn nonmedal events, the Team USA women's basketball team plays Belgium at 3:00 p.m. ET and 9:00 p.m. local time; and in tennis, Tommy Paul takes on Carlos Alcaraz in the men's singles quarterfinal after 12:00 p.m. local time and 6:00 p.m. Novak Djokovic also plays Stefanos Tsitsipas at 1:00 p.m. ET and 7:00 p.m. local time.\n\nHere are the rest of the medal events to watch out for:\n\nTrack and Field — Men’s 20km race walk at 1:30 a.m. ET and 7:30 a.m. local time; Women’s 20km race walk at 3:20 a.m. ET and 9:20 a.m. Paris.\n\nShooting — Men’s smallbore rifle, three positions at 3:30 a.m. ET and 9:30 a.m. local time.\n\nRowing — Women’s double sculls at 5:18 a.m. ET and 11:18 a.m. local time; men’s double sculls at 5:30 a.m. ET and 11:30 a.m. local time; women’s four at 5:50 a.m. ET and 11:50 a.m. local time.\n\nSailing — Men’s skiff at 8:43 a.m. ET and 2:43 p.m. local time; women’s skiff at 9:43 a.m. ET and 3:43 p.m. local time.\n\nJudo — Men’s half heavyweight at 11:18 a.m. ET and 5:18 p.m. local time; women’s half heavyweight at 11:49 a.m. ET and 5:49 p.m. local time.\n\nCanoe Slalom — Men’s kayak single at 11:30 a.m. ET and 5:30 p.m. local time.\n\nFencing —Women’s team foil at 1:10 p.m. ET and 7:10 p.m. local time.\n\nSnoop Dogg declares himself the Olympics MVP after traveling with the U.S. men’s basketball team\n\nSpecial NBC Olympics correspondent Snoop Dogg has been all over the Games, carrying the torch, getting a swim lesson from Michael Phelps, traveling by bus and train with the U.S. men’s basketball team.\n\n\"Man, this is a grind out here,\" Snoop told NBC’s Mike Tirico on Wednesday’s prime-time Paris Games broadcast. \"But I’m having so much fun.\"\n\n\"Mike, I may be the MVP of the Olympics, just saying,\" Snoop said.\n\nSnoop joined the men’s basketball team on its bus and train journey down to Lille, where group-phase games are being played.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nHow to watch\n\nStream every moment and every medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Peacock.\n\nFull prime-time coverage begins tonight on NBC and Peacock at 8 p.m. ET."
