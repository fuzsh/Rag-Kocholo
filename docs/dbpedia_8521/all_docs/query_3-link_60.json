The historic loop track takes you into the heart of this World Heritage-listed landscape. It's an intimate, adventurous, and popular track which walkers have trodden since 1907.\n\nSetting out from Grand Canyon carpark this well-shaded track meanders through luscious native vegetation of ferns and golden wattles and remains close to Greaves Creek. All of these things combine to make this a particularly good walk for the summer months.\n\nAlthough there are loads of semi-ledges which make up this challenging walk, it is one of the rare locations where you don’t need specialist hiking or abseiling equipment to explore a canyon. Comfortable walking shoes are all you’ll need to get out there and explore. Still feeling energetic? Try the nearby Cliff Top walking track."
