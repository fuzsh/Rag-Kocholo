        "text": "About Evans Blue\n\nEvans Blue was formed in early 2005 when the five musicians, then in three different bands, connected through a local musician’s message board. The chemistry of the group was evident from the first rehearsal. The same message board then brought the band to the attention of producer Trevor Kustiak of The Pocket Studios in Toronto, and they began working together in March 2005. Since then, the band has written and recorded their debut album, The Melody and the Energetic Nature of Volume, which was completed in early November 2005 and released in February 2006 from Hollywood Records. Their first major single was \"Cold (But I'm Still Here)\", which received a great deal of radio airplay. The debut record has spent the last three weeks in the top 10 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart. The band recently finished their support of Taproot on their tour and are set to begin touring with Trapt and Shinedown and will later join Breaking Benjamin on select dates.\n\nTheir second CD entitled, \"The Pursuit Begins When This Portrayal Of Life Ends\", was released on July 24th, 2007.\n\nLead singer and main song/lyrical producer Kevin Matisyn was removed from the band on June 28th, 2008, with the remaining members citing \"musical differences\" and incompatible management issues.\n\nShow More\n\nGenres:\n\nAlternative, Rock\n\nBand Members:\n\nJoe Pitter, Dan Chandler, Parker Lauzon, V\n\nHometown:\n\nSainte-Louise, Canada\n\nEvans Blue was formed in early 2005 when the five musicians, then in three different bands, connected through a local musician’s message board.
