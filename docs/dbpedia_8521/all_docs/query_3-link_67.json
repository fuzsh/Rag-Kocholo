        "text": "The Man Comes AroundJohnny Cash\n\nThe idea for \"The Man Comes Around\" came to Johnny Cash from a dream he had where he was in Buckingham Palace and the Queen said to him, \"Johnny Cash, you're just like a thorn tree in a whirlwind.\"\n\nBoom ClapCharli XCX\n\nBefore recording \"Boom Clap\" herself, Charli XCX offered the song to Hilary Duff. However, the singer's people turned down the tune declaring it wasn't \"cool enough for Hilary.\"\n\nGod Bless AmericaKate Smith\n\nIrving Berlin said \"God Bless America\" was \"not a patriotic song, but rather an expression of gratitude.\"\n\nShe's A RainbowThe Rolling Stones\n\nIt was never a big hit, but \"She's A Rainbow\" became one of the most popular Rolling Stones songs in the digital age when it started showing up in commercials (iMac, Photoshop), and TV shows (American Horror Story: Coven, Ted Lasso).\n\nWork From HomeFifth Harmony\n\nFifth Harmony was going to call their song \"Work,\" but they changed it to \"Work from Home\" when Rihanna released a song with that title.\n\nPetula ClarkSongwriter Interviews\n\nPetula talks about her hits \"Downtown\" and \"Don't Sleep In The Subway,\" and explains her Michael Jackson connection.\n\nConcert DisastersFact or Fiction\n\nOzzy biting a dove? Alice Cooper causing mayhem with a chicken? Creed so bad they were sued? See if you can spot the real concert mishaps.\n\nDexys (Kevin Rowland and Jim Paterson)Songwriter Interviews\n\n\"Come On Eileen\" was a colossal '80s hit, but the band - far more appreciated in their native UK than stateside - released just three albums before their split. Now, Dexys is back."
