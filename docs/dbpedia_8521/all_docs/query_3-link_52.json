        "text": "PARIS -- More elimination games in team events, with more individual medals being awarded at the 2024 Paris Olympics on Wednesday.\n\nWatch the Olympics on FuboTV (7-day free trial) and Peacock\n\nTRACK AND FIELD\n\nWhere: Stade de France (Paris, France)\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nSESSION #12 (4 a.m., USA Network)\n\nMen: High Jump (Qualification, 4:05 a.m.), 5000m (Round 1, 5:10 a.m.), 800m (Round 1, 5:55 a.m.)\n\nWomen: 100 Hurdles (Round 1, 4:15 a.m.), Javelin Throw (Qualification, 4:25 a.m.), 1500m (Repechages, 6:45 a.m.)\n\nSESSION #13 (1 p.m., NBC)\n\nMen: 110m Hurdles (Semifinals, 1:05 p.m.), Triple Jump (Qualification, 1:15 p.m.), 400m Hurdles (Semifinals, 1:35 p.m.), 200m (Semifinals, 2:02 p.m.), Discus Throw (Final, 2:25 p.m.), 400m (Final, 3:20 p.m.), 3000m Steeplechase (Final, 3:43 p.m.)\n\nWomen: Pole Vault (Final, 1 p.m.), 400m (Semifinals, 2:45 p.m.)\n\nAnother sprinting event where the U.S. has a contender heading into the final. Quincy Hall has been the fastest person in the 400-meter so far in 2024, setting a solid pace of 43.80 in Monaco earlier this year. Hall took home the bronze at the world championships last year, but is hoping he can make a solid run in Paris.\n\nMichael Norman, the gold medalist from the 2022 Worlds, is right on pace with Hall, giving the U.S. a good shot of having two on the podium. Yet, Canadian Chris Williams, a two-time NCAA national champion, has been very fast this year, and could sneak into the medal conversation.\n\nFull track & field schedule\n\nWOMEN’S BASKETBALL QUARTERFINALS\n\nSerbia vs. Australia\n\nTime: 5 a.m. ET\n\nWhere: Bercy Arena (Paris, France)\n\nStream: Peacock\n\nA couple of second-place teams begin the knockout stage on the women’s side. In their third straight quarterfinal appearance, Serbia is looking to make it to the semifinals. They went 2-1 in group play, only losing to Spain in Group A. The Aussies also went 2-1 in the opening round, punching their ticket to the quarterfinals for the eighth consecutive Olympics. Australia hasn’t made it to the semis since 2012.\n\nSpain vs. Belgium\n\nTime: 8:30 a.m. ET\n\nWhere: Bercy Arena (Paris, France)\n\nStream: Peacock\n\nSpain is looking like a very dangerous team in Paris. A healthy mix of domestic and international talent led to the European nation winning Group with a 3-0 record, advancing to the knockout stage for the third tournament in a row. The Spanish last made it to the semifinals in 2016, when they won silver. In just their second Olympic appearance, Belgium is back in the quarterfinals once again after sneaking into third in Group C.\n\nGermany vs. France\n\nTime: 12 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Bercy Arena (Paris, France)\n\nStream: Peacock\n\nThe host country looks like a formidable opponent. France had a chance to win Group B, but a tough battle against Australia led to a lone mark on their record, but they still ended up in first place. The French are now searching for a fourth straight semifinal appearance at the Olympics. In their first Olympic appearance, the Germans showed some real spunk, going 2-1 in the opening round, only losing to the U.S. in a closer game than some expected.\n\nNigeria vs. United States\n\nTime: 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Bercy Arena (Paris, France)\n\nChannel: USA Network\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nAnother year, another Olympics where the Americans look like a team that is going to waltz to the gold medal game. Similar to their men counterparts, the United States finished the group stage with the most points scored (276) and the best point differential (+58). Outside of 1980, the U.S. has never missed the semifinals.\n\nIn their first two Olympic appearances, Nigeria failed to make it out of the group stage. However, this year’s team showed some might, beating Australia and Canada to finish third in Group B, moving onto the knockout stage.\n\nFull basketball schedule here\n\nMEN’S WATER POLO QUARTERFINALS\n\nWhere: Aquatics Centre (Paris, France)\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nCroatia vs. Spain (8 a.m., E! Network, FuboTV, Peacock)\n\nAfter years of being a meddling team in water polo, Spain is looking like an absolute unit in Paris. They went a perfect 5-0 in Group B, scoring the most goals (67) and allowing the fewest (39), leading to the best goal differential (+28) in the opening round. The Spanish squad is searching for its second straight trip to the semifinals.\n\nCroatia seemed like they were on a path to a favorable matchup in the quarterfinals. However, a disappointing loss to the United States in their group stage finale led to the Croatians finishing fourth in Group A. They are searching for an upset, and a third trip to the semis in the last four Olympics.\n\nGreece vs. Serbia (9:35 a.m., Peacock)\n\nThe rematch from the gold medal match in Tokyo is set for Wednesday. Serbia took down Greece to win their second straight gold medal in men’s water polo.\n\nIt seems as if the odds are in favor of the Greeks this time around. The team went 4-1, enough to finish atop Group A. A win over Serbians would send the nation to the semis for just the third time in its history. If you include the time when they were part of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenergo, Serbia has made it to the semifinals in each of the last six Olympics. However, this year, they went just 2-3 in the opening round, finishing fourth in Group B.\n\nUnited States vs. Australia (1 p.m., USA Network, FuboTV, Peacock)\n\nThe U.S. is back in the quarterfinals for the 10th time in the last 11 tournaments. It was a rocky road for the Americans, as they lost tough games to Italy and Greece. However, they were able to sneak into third in Group A with a win over Croatia. They have not been to the semifinals since their silver medal performance in 2008.\n\nThis is the first time in 12 years that the Aussies have advanced to the knockout stage. After bowing out in the opening round in each of the last two Olympics, Australia played in a tough Group B, but went 3-2 and snuck into second place.\n\nItaly vs. Hungary (2:35 p.m., USA Network, FuboTV, Peacock)\n\nIn the annals of history, this is a heavyweight matchup. Italy is looking to redeem themselves after falling in the quarterfinals in Tokyo, and looked good in the group stage, going 4-1 and finishing second in Group A. Hungary, the defending bronze medalists, are looking to get back to the semifinals for the fifth time in the last seven Olympics. They went 3-2 in the opening round, ending up third in Group B.\n\nMEN’S VOLLEYBALL SEMIFINALS\n\nWhere: South Paris Arena (Paris, France)\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nPoland vs. United States (10 a.m., NBC, FuboTV, Peacock)\n\nFor the first time since they won bronze in Rio, the United States is in the final four in men’s volleyball. While this American team had some firepower, no one could have predicted how good they would play. After going 3-0 to win Pool C, they dismantled Brazil, 2-1, in the quarterfinals to make it to the final four. They are trying to get to the gold medal match for the first time since winning it all in 2008.\n\nPoland is in the semifinals for the first time since 1980. After five straight quarterfinal exits, the Polish squad outlasted the previously undefeated Slovenian team in the quarterfinals. The last time Poland made it to a gold medal match, they won, back in 1976.\n\nItaly vs. France (2 p.m., Peacock)\n\nThe host nation is looking to go back to the Olympic final. The reigning gold medalists in France have played strong so far in Paris, even though they finished second to Slovenia in Pool A. Yet, they battled hard against a tough German team in the quarterfinals to advance to the final four for just the second time ever.\n\nItaly is back in the semifinals for the seventh time in the last eight Olympics. They went 3-0 in the group stage, winning Pool B. Then, in the quarterfinals, they went the distance to vanquish Japan. The Italians are eyeing a trip to the gold medal match for the fourth time in the country’s history.\n\nBEACH VOLLEYBALL QUARTERFINALS\n\nWhere: Eiffel Tower Stadium (Paris, France)\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nMEN’S\n\nPablo Herrera Allepuz/Adrian Gavira Collado (ESP) vs. Anders Bernsten Mol/Christian Sandlie Soerum (NOR) (3 p.m., Peacock)\n\nMol and Soerum’s quest to repeat as gold medalists continues. After winning Pool B with a perfect record, they defeated the American duo of Evans and Budinger in the Round of 16 on Monday. Herrera and Gavira are also coming off a 2-0 in their first match in the knockout round, and are trying to become the second Spanish team to make it to the semifinals.\n\nCherif Younousse/Ahmed Tijan (QAT) vs. Miles Partain/Andrew Benesh (USA) (4 p.m., NBC, FuboTV, Peacock)\n\nThe only American team left, Partain and Benesh seemed to turn things around in their Round of 16 match against the Italians, winning in straight sets. The last time an American team advanced to the final four was when Todd Rogers and Phil Dalhausser won gold in 2008.\n\nIt will be tough for the U.S., as Younousse and Tijan have been playing extremely well. The reigning bronze medalists won Pool A by going 3-0, before winning their Round of 16 match in straight sets.\n\nWOMEN’S\n\nDaniela Alvarez Mendoza/Tania Moreno Matveeva (ESP) vs. Melissa Humana-Paredes/Brandie Wilkerson (CAN) (11 a.m., Peacock)\n\nHumana-Paredes and Wilkerson stunned everyone. After sneaking into the knockout stage after winning their Lucky Loser’s match, they swept the American team of Kloth and Nuss to advance to the quarters. No female Canadian team has ever made it to the semis.\n\nAlvarez and Moreno are already making history as the first female Spanish team to make it this far. Yet, after an impressive run in the pool stage, they are one win away from a stunning semifinal appearance.\n\nAna Patricia Silva Ramos/Eduarda Santos Lisboa (BRA) vs. Anatasija Samoilova/Tina Graudina (LAT) (12 p.m., NBC, FuboTV, Peacock)\n\nSilva and Santos are looking to become the first Brazilian team to advance to the final four since two duos made it to the semis in Rio eight years ago. Graudina and Samoilova are trying to make it to the semifinals for the second straight Olympics.\n\nFull beach volleyball schedule here\n\nSKATEBOARDING\n\nMen’s Park Final\n\nTime: 11:30 a.m. ET\n\nWhere: La Concorde (Paris, France)\n\nChannel: USA Network\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nWhile Japan might have the edge on the street side, there is a great chance that the U.S. can sweep the podium in the park event.\n\nEven though reigning gold medalist Keegan Palmer is back to defend his title, Tate Carew, Gavin Bottger, and Tom Schaar are looking to paint the podium red, white and blue.\n\nAlso on the card is skateboard legend Andy Macdonald. The 51-year-old will be representing Great Britain, hoping to have some fun in what could be his final Olympics.\n\nFULL SCHEDULES"
