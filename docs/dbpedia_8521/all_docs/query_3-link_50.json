The McNamara and Big Blue Deck parking garages are located outside of the terminals, and the Green Lots are located a short distance from Evans Terminal.\n\nThe Green Lots have no height restrictions, so vehicles exceeding 7 feet high can use these parking lots instead of the covered garages. Courtesy shuttle buses transport passengers to and from the Green Lots with pick-up and drop-off from the ground transportation center.\n\nParking Fees\n\nGreen Lots 1 and 2 Parking Fees\n\n24-hour daily: $15\n\nHot Tip: Airport parking lots have QR codes to scan to remember where youâve parked and for directions to and from the terminals.\n\nPick-up or Drop-off Parking\n\nDTW has 2 cell phone waiting lots â 1 located near Evans Terminal and 1 located near McNamara Terminal. Family and friends collecting passengers can remain in their vehicles for free within these lots until they are called for pick-up outside of the terminal.\n\nPassengers can be dropped off curbside outside of the terminals, or by parking inside the short-term parking lots.\n\nOff-site and Hotel Parking\n\nDTW has reasonably priced daily parking compared to other major U.S. airports. However, off-site parking lots can offer even cheaper rates. Using a third-party booking site such as airportparkingreservations.com, passengers can book parking from $12 per day.\n\nThese off-site parking options operate their own shuttle services to/from the airport, so although they are located further away, they still offer a convenient alternative to official airport parking.\n\nParking for Passengers With Disabilities\n\nParking for disabled passengers is available in all parking garages and uncovered lots. High-mobility vehicles (not exceeding 8 feet, 2 inches) can be accommodated in designated areas of the Big Blue Deck and McNamara parking garages.
