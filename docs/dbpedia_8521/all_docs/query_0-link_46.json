        "meta_description": "Background: The data of spectrofluorimetric analysis showed that 1 hour after exposure to music / sound (100 dB), the concentration of EBAC in the brain tissues of all mice (100%) was increased 17.3 times (music) p <0.001 and 18.6 times (sound) p <0.001 compared with the control group. Similar results were found in mice exposed to music / sound (90 dB). After 4 and 24 hours, the permeability of Evans Blue returned to normal. The data indicate the effectiveness of the method for quantifying the BBB permeability for high molecular weight substances. The method of fluorimetric determination of the extravasation of the Evans Blue dye from cerebral vessels into brain tissue is effective for assessing the state of the BBB in real time and can be useful for studying the functions and pathology of the barrier function of the brain in animal experiments.",
