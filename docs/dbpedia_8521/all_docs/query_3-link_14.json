        "text": "Let’s pour out a cold tall glass of maple syrup for all the Canadian bands that at one point were poised to be superstars, but have since faded from our collective skies. Here’s a pretty thorough list of one-time hitmakers from this great country.\n\nTier 1:\n\nThey’re not actually “forgotten”. In fact most of these bands are still household names, but strictly in a nostalgic sense. They had solid careers and didn’t vanish so much as they grew irrelevant and/or broke up and went on indefinite hiatuses.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nDefault\n\nThe Sound: Nickelrock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Wasting My Time”, “Deny”\n\nThe Big Years: 2001-2002\n\nWha Happened?: A Chad Kroeger approved Nickelclone, they scored a few big radio hits when “active rock” was still a thing, namely “Wasting My Time and “Deny You”. They had another hit in “Taking my Life Away” in the mid-2000s, but then were relegated to strictly hard rock charts as that scene took a back seat to indie alt on rock radio. Lead singer Dallas Smith is a country singer now. Fellow Kroeger acolytes Theory of a Deadman are still going and surprisingly popular.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nNelly Furtado\n\nThe Sound: Hippie Pop, then Mainstream Pop\n\nThe Big Songs: “I’m Like A Bird”, “Maneater”\n\nThe Big Years: 2001, 2006\n\nWha Happened?: There just wasn’t enough setting Furtado apart from all the other starlets vying for the spotlight, even with her complete reinvention. She tried to make yet another comeback with the song “Hoops” a few years back to no luck. She probably still has a lot of money.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nProzzak\n\nThe Sound: Cartoon pop\n\nThe Big Songs: “Strange Disease”, “Sucks to Be You”\n\nThe Big Years: 1999-2000\n\nWha Happened?: Canada’s Gorillaz?? No, not quite as artisan. More like Canada’s Jem & The Holograms. They were all the rage for a year and a bit, then went away, then came back super serious and majorly depressed in 2006, then went away again. The two guys are still in the music industry, and recently did a series of reunion shows before disbanding “for good”.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nBif Naked\n\nThe Sound: Sometimes rock, sometimes pop\n\nThe Big Songs: “Spaceman”, “I Love Myself Today”\n\nThe Big Years: Early 2000s\n\nWha Happened?: Jumped around from genre to genre, scored big in 2001, then sporadically appeared a few times in the 2000s. I think the last I heard of her was around 2011. Not sure if she still does music.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nEdwin\n\nThe Sound: Solo artist rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Alive”, “Trippin'”\n\nThe Big Years: 1999-2000\n\nWha Happened?: Edwin left I Mother Earth and did a few slightly less angry albums, sometimes going as “Edwin & The Pressure” and also was a member of the band Crash Karma. He also got involved in the bar industry in Toronto for a while. He has since reunited with I Mother Earth on the reunion circuit.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nDie Mannequin\n\nThe Sound: Motorcycle pop\n\nThe Big Songs: “Do It or Die”, “Bad Medicine”\n\nThe Big Years: 2009-2010\n\nWha Happened?: They are still around, and have honed their sound to be a little more electronic but can still be played in tattoo and leather shops around town.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nEconoline Crush\n\nThe Sound: Industrial alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: “You Don’t Know What It’s Like”, “All That You Are”\n\nThe Big Years: 1997- 2001\n\nWha Happened?: After a slew of smaller radio singles, they broke through with their two big hits listed above. Then they went quiet around 2002. Lead singer Trevor Hurst released a solo album, the band re-appeared in 2008 with a new album, then quiet again.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Watchmen\n\nThe Sound: Alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: “Stereo”, “Absolutely Anytime”\n\nThe Big Years: Late 90s, Early 2000s\n\nWha Happened?: Became a legacy act. They’re still regularly played on rock format radio.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nBedouin Soundclash\n\nThe Sound: Campfire reggae\n\nThe Big Songs: “When the Night Hears My Song”, “Walls Fall Down”\n\nThe Big Years: 2005, 2008\n\nWha Happened?: ??? It’s a mystery. They had regular airplay, a stable of singles, and then singer Jay Malinowski did some solo stuff and the band abruptly stopped after 2010. It’s a shame because they were the right fit for today’s scene and could have done some interesting work if they’d branched out their sound.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nNeverending White Lights\n\nThe Sound: Sadcore alternative feat. big name guest singers\n\nThe Big Songs: “The Grace”\n\nThe Big Years: 2006\n\nWha Happened?: Main guy Daniel Victor kind of lost the plot on the most recent record in 2011, with a scant 2 guest singers on the whole record. Dude, the entire conceit of your project was to have a different well-known singer on each track.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nTreble Charger\n\nThe Sound: Canada’s Third Eye Blind\n\nThe Big Songs: “American Psycho”, “Red”, “Ever She Flows”\n\nThe Big Years: 1997-2000\n\nWha Happened?: ??? There was supposed to be a reunion but I guess Greig Nori doesn’t want to do it any more cuz he wants to judge more MuchMusic bands on TV.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nSimple Plan\n\nThe Sound: The poppiest of punk\n\nThe Big Songs: “I’m Just a Kid” “Untitled”\n\nThe Big Years: 2002-2005\n\nWha Happened?: They’re still around somewhere, doing stuff with Natasha Bedingfield. As expected, they now have fancy keyboards and beats in their music.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHeadstones\n\nThe Sound: Alterna-punk\n\nThe Big Songs: “Settle”, “Cubically Contained”\n\nThe Big Years: Late 90’s – 2002\n\nWha Happened?: Doing reunion shows here and there. Lead singer Hugh Dillon is also an actor as seen on Blue Flashlight or whatever the Canadian cop show was called.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nTier 2:\n\nThese bands are really a product of their time. They had big hits, maybe even two or three from their big album. They may have even had follow-up hits from an album a few years later, but those were usually forgettable efforts only played on the radio as contractually obligated CANCON filler. Some of them are actually still active, but far from the public eye.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nillScarlett\n\nThe Sound: Alternative Ska\n\nThe Big Songs: “Heaters”, “One-A”, “Nothing Special”\n\nThe Big Years: 2006-2007\n\nWha Happened?: They did pretty ok! They spawned a whole ska scene in Toronto with many imitators, but then just sort of went away at the turn of the decade.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nJoydrop\n\nThe Sound: Bif Naked 2.0\n\nThe Big Songs: “Sometimes Wanna Die”, “Beautiful Like You”\n\nThe Big Years: Late 90’s, early 2000’s\n\nWha Happened?: Faded out once the garage rock revival cleared out the last alt-rock survivors.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nCrash Test Dummies\n\nThe Sound: Mmmasochist-core\n\nThe Big Songs: “Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm”\n\nThe Big Years: 1994\n\nWha Happened?: To be fair, people who knew about these guys have probably not forgotten them and their aggressively boring songs. If you were to convert boredom into an audible sound, it would be this guy’s voice. Fortunately they were relegated to one-hit wonder status and Barenaked Ladies took up the mantle of quirky alternative Canadian band.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Trews\n\nThe Sound: East Coast Rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Not Ready to Go” “Tired of Waiting”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004\n\nWha Happened?: Touring and occasional releases\n\n——————————————————-\n\nDanko Jones\n\nThe Sound: Full-blooded rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Bounce”, “The Sound of Love”\n\nThe Big Years: 2000-2002\n\nWha Happened?: Still touring, still bouncing.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHawksley Workman\n\nThe Sound: Bono-voiced troubadour\n\nThe Big Songs: “Striptease” “Jealous of Your Cigarette”\n\nThe Big Years: 2000\n\nWha Happened?: Was big in the early 2000s, then released a few more albums, then started playing in…\n\n——————————————————-\n\nMounties\n\nThe Sound: Hawksley Workman + Hot Hot Heat + one of the Dahle brothers\n\nThe Big Songs: “Headphones”\n\nThe Big Years: 2014\n\nWha Happened?: Everyone went back to their other bands.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nMobile\n\nThe Sound: 80s post punk revival\n\nThe Big Songs: “Out of My Head”\n\nThe Big Years: 2006\n\nWha Happened?: They got out of people’s heads. Singer Mat Joly has a solo project.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHostage Life\n\nThe Sound: “Totally legit punk”\n\nThe Big Songs: “This Song Was Written By A Committee”\n\nThe Big Years: 2008\n\nWha Happened?: Punk no more\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Salads\n\nThe Sound: Hey dude, totally fun party time rock! Yeah!\n\nThe Big Songs: “Get Loose”\n\nThe Big Years: 2003\n\nWha Happened?: Will play a party if they get a slice of the pizza.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Lowest of the Low\n\nThe Sound: So 90s.\n\nThe Big Songs: “Salesman Cheats and Liars”\n\nThe Big Years: The 90s.\n\nWha Happened?: The 90s ended. Ron Hawkins did a side project called The Rusty Nails.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHolly McNarland\n\nThe Sound: mature angst\n\nThe Big Songs: “Numb”, “Do You Get High?”\n\nThe Big Years: 1998-2002\n\nWha Happened?: People stopped being sad.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Odds\n\nThe Sound: More sardonic version of Lowest of the Low\n\nThe Big Songs: “Eat My Brain”, “Someone Who’s Cool”\n\nThe Big Years: Mid-late 90’s\n\nWha Happened?: The 90’s like, totally ended dude.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHollerado\n\nThe Sound: Jangly, whimsical pop-rock about life written by hipsters for non-hipsters.\n\nThe Big Songs: “Juliette”\n\nThe Big Years: 2010\n\nWha Happened?: Zellers went out of business so there were no commercials left for Hollerado to score, so they broke up.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nPilate/Pilot Speed\n\nThe Sound: Indie alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: “Into Your Hideout”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004, 2006\n\nWha Happened?: They had to change their name from Pilate to Pilot Speed, the albums got progressively more and more boring and lead singer Todd Clark decided to switch things up by writing the song in the Good Life Fitness commercials.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nGob\n\nThe Sound: Pop-punk\n\nThe Big Songs: “I Hear You Calling”, “For the Moment”, “Ming Tran”\n\nThe Big Years: 1999-2003\n\nWha Happened?: Simple Plan took over the pop-punk scene. There was a more aggressive record in 2008 but it’s been quiet on the Gob-front ever since.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nStabilo\n\nThe Sound: Pop Rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Everybody”, “Flawed Design”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004, 2006\n\nWha Happened?: Nothing, really. They had their hits…and that was it.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nBy Divine Right\n\nThe Sound: Pre-hipster hip rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Come For a Ride”\n\nThe Big Years: 1999\n\nWha Happened?: After Brendan Canning and Feist left to form Broken Social Scene, By Divine Right slowly went away. They did a full album cover of Depeche Mode’s 1981 album Speak & Spell. They had a song a few years back called “Past the Stars”.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nJoel Plaskett Emergency\n\nThe Sound: CBC-core\n\nThe Big Songs: All of Them.\n\nThe Big Years: All of Them.\n\nWha Happened?: Joel Plaskett is a name that every Canadian has heard. He has played everywhere and has been around since Confederation. He is known by all and yet……what is he known for? I know he plays Canada Day concerts every year but I don’t know any of his songs or what he looks like. I just know that I am supposed to know who he is.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nLimblifter\n\nThe Sound: Big Shiny Tunes alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: “Tinfoil” “Ariel Vs. Lotus” “Screwed it Up”\n\nThe Big Years: The 90’s\n\nWha Happened?: I’m still not entirely sure of the Dahle family tree, but I know that the band splintered and there were like 100 side projects, one of which is listed next.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Age of Electric\n\nThe Sound: Limblifter 2.0 Original Limblifter\n\nThe Big Songs: “Remote Control”, “I Don’t Mind”\n\nThe Big Years: 1997\n\nWha Happened?: Whoa guys, I just found out that Age of Electric was the original and that Limblifter was in fact the side project!!! Mind blown. Whoa.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nWide Mouth Mason\n\nThe Sound: Prairie Rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “My Old Self”\n\nThe Big Years: Late 90’s\n\nWha Happened?: “My Old Self” was all by itself in terms of hits (they didn’t have too much further radio success).\n\n——————————————————-\n\nChampion\n\nThe Sound: Dark electro-rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “No Heaven”\n\nThe Big Years: 2006\n\nWha Happened?: It’s a complete mystery. The guitar conductor dropped another album in 2009 and then hints about another one, but he never really resurfaced.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nWintersleep\n\nThe Sound: Post punk actually, but then folk rock for the radio in order to make $$$\n\nThe Big Songs: “Weighty Ghost”\n\nThe Big Years: 2008\n\nWha Happened?: There was a side project called Contrived, but not much since 2008. Apparently there is a new album coming out soon.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHey Rosetta!\n\nThe Sound: Some kind of alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: “Welcome”\n\nThe Big Years: 2011\n\nWha Happened?: The biggest Canadian band you’ve never heard of. A massive following keeps them afloat and apparently they are still releasing music.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nFeist\n\nThe Sound: iPod commercial-core\n\nThe Big Songs: “1234”\n\nThe Big Years: 2007\n\nWha Happened?: Technically she’s still a household name in indie households (apartments in Kensington or The Annex) but iPod commercials (and iPods) are a thing of the past and her drab 2012 album didn’t retain any followers gained from the 2007 hit single.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nFeFe Dobson\n\nThe Sound: Avril 2.0\n\nThe Big Songs: “Bye Bye Boyfriend”, “Take Me Away”\n\nThe Big Years: 2003\n\nWha Happened?: Didn’t really build a big enough fanbase in the rock world, faded out for a while before re-emerging as more of a popstar. Now is available for any events MuchMusic needs talent for. “Oh shoot do we have anyone for New Year’s Eve?” “Just call FeFe and Shawn Desman!”\n\n——————————————————-\n\nTier 3:\n\nThese artists are perhaps the best representatives of what this list is all about. They were legitimately big solely in one year, hyped by media outlets as the “next big thing”. They had one big album, and usually just one big song- but it was a song that everyone knew. They were ready to take on the world…and then they didn’t. They’re still remembered, but not by many. Until you play that one big song of theirs, and then everyone’s like “OH THOSE GUYS”.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nCustom\n\nThe Sound: Sketchy uncle rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Hey Mister”, “Beat Me”\n\nThe Big Years: 2002\n\nWha Happened?: I think most people just expected him to be a one-off joke and then he had some weird angry political song and then disappeared forever.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nShocore\n\nThe Sound: Trashy metal disco\n\nThe Big Songs: “Bonecracker”\n\nThe Big Years: 2001\n\nWha Happened: They had a song called “Bonecracker”. Did you really think anything else would happen for them? (ps bonecracker is such a jam tho)\n\n——————————————————-\n\nOut of Your Mouth\n\nThe Sound: Canadian nu-metal\n\nThe Big Songs: “Music”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004\n\nWha Happened?: They got all the mileage they could out of their Madonna cover and then politely went away. I know they had a feud with Social Code too?\n\n——————————————————-\n\nSocial Code\n\nThe Sound: For angsty Canadian teens\n\nThe Big Songs: “Beautiful”, “Bomb Hands”\n\nThe Big Years: 2005\n\nWha Happened?: They arrived too late to the emo scene. My Chemical Romance ultimately took their spot.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Black Halos\n\nThe Sound: Punkorama punk\n\nThe Big Songs: “Some Things Never Fall”\n\nThe Big Years: 2001\n\nWha Happened?: Too many punks in the pit, they got lost in the shuffle.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nBoy\n\nThe Sound: B-List Sam Roberts\n\nThe Big Songs: “Same Old Song”, “Up in this Town”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004-2005\n\nWha Happened?: Real Sam Roberts was enough for the Canadian populace.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nJakalope\n\nThe Sound: Trent Reznor-curated pop group/Canada’s answer to Evanescence\n\nThe Big Songs: “Pretty Life”, “Feel It”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004\n\nWha Happened?: Original singer was replaced, interest in the project waned.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Waking Eyes\n\nThe Sound: The garagiest of garage rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Watch Your Money”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004\n\nWha Happened?: They arrived at the tail-end of garage rock and couldn’t capitalize on it quickly enough. Had a minor hit in “All Empires Fall” in 2008, but then gone.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nEvans Blue\n\nThe Sound: Too late nu-metal\n\nThe Big Songs: “Cold (But I’m Still Here)”\n\nThe Big Years: 2006\n\nWha Happened?: Honestly, it was surprising that they gained any traction at all. They arrived a year after nu metal was dead and buried and yet still scored a pretty big radio hit. There was another album in 2007, then the singer left the group and side projects like Parabelle ensued.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nAttack in Black\n\nThe Sound: Some kind of folk alternative i think\n\nThe Big Songs: “Young Leaves”\n\nThe Big Years: 2007\n\nWha Happened?: The singer’s voice really hindered any sort of future the band might have. Nothing big since 2007.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nNot By Choice\n\nThe Sound: Back-up Sum 41\n\nThe Big Songs: “Standing All Alone”, “Now That You Are Leaving”\n\nThe Big Years: 2002\n\nWha Happened?: Eventually replaced by another Sum 41 clone.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nOperation MD\n\nThe Sound: Sum 41 side-project\n\nThe Big Songs: “Sayonara”\n\nThe Big Years: 2008\n\nWha Happened?: So this was a guy from Sum 41, so I guess he went back to them, but then I think he left again. In any case, this band basically only had the one song.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nZuckerbaby\n\nThe Sound: 90’s alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: “Andromeda”, “Overexposure”\n\nThe Big Years: Late 90’s\n\nWha Happened?: Bye bye 90’s. But they opened for Wide Mouth Mason recently!\n\n——————————————————-\n\nSerial Joe\n\nThe Sound: Mistake-core\n\nThe Big Songs: “Mistake”\n\nThe Big Years: 1999\n\nWha Happened?: Canada’s Silverchair, the young prodigies had a few more minor hits after “Mistake” but the rock star life was not for them. The lead singer, whom everyone seemed to know at one point in their life, is now working as a technician for Bell.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nMajor Maker\n\nThe Sound: Candy commercial music\n\nThe Big Songs: “Rollercoaster”\n\nThe Big Years Month: August 2007\n\nWha Happened?: TV stopped airing the commercial.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nJunkhouse\n\nThe Sound: Pearl Jam knock-off\n\nThe Big Songs: “Shine”, “Out of My Head”\n\nThe Big Years: 1999\n\nWha Happened?: It was just a matter of time until they shined. And then it was just a matter of more time until they faded away.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nKazzer\n\nThe Sound: Car commercial-core\n\nThe Big Songs: “Pedal to the Metal”\n\nThe Big Years: 2003\n\nWha Happened?: He went away for a while, then came back as….\n\nRedlight King\n\nThe Sound: More mature car commercial-core\n\nThe Big Songs: “Old Man”\n\nThe Big Years: 2011\n\nWha Happened?: Twice a one-hit wonder!! That’s kind of neat. He’s the Canadian Cee Lo Green.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nKO\n\nThe Sound: Canadian Everlast\n\nThe Big Songs: “Capable”\n\nThe Big Years: 2010\n\nWha Happened?: Well hopefully he ended up OK.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nthe pack AD\n\nThe Sound: power rock duo\n\nThe Big Songs: “Sirens”\n\nThe Big Years: 2012\n\nWha Happened?: Rock radio stopped paying attention to them for some reason. Still around though.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nWild Strawberries\n\nThe Sound: Canada’s Cranberries\n\nThe Big Songs: “Crying Shame”, “Bet You Think I’m Lonely”\n\nThe Big Years: mid-90’s\n\nWha Happened?: They really were a product of their time, singer-songwriter alternative that could only exist in the 1990s. They’ve released a few albums since then but they’ve been very sporadic.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nstereos\n\nThe Sound: electro-emo\n\nThe Big Songs: “Summer Girl”\n\nThe Big Years: 2009\n\nWha Happened?: Ok so there was Stereos, Hedley, Marianas Trench, Faber Drive, Down With Webster…obviously someone had to lose in the sell-out war, and it was these guys.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Marble Index\n\nThe Sound: Garage rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “I Believe”, “Not So Bright”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004\n\nWha Happened?: Buried under the glut of all the other garage bands flooding the market at the time.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nElias\n\nThe Sound: generic-way-past-due-date alternative rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “All We Want”\n\nThe Big Years: 2009\n\nWha Happened?: What happened was they didn’t show up to an interview I was doing with them so I don’t care what they did after 2009.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nTier 4:\n\nThese artists didn’t really make it. They were about to! They were on the cusp of success, and it eluded them just by a little bit. They may have charted on regional charts, but for various reasons they missed out on the bigger scene and are now just footnotes in Canadian music history.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nSpiral Beach\n\nThe Sound: OoOoO very unique, artsy special music\n\nThe Big Songs: “Made of Stone”\n\nThe Big Years: 2008\n\nWha Happened?: They tried to be a new Broken Social Scene but they were JUST TOO quirky and intelligent for us the listeners and so they refused to grace us with more music, oh NO!\n\n——————————————————-\n\nEmm Gryner\n\nThe Sound: Wistful late 90s alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: “Summerlong”\n\nThe Big Years: 1998\n\nWha Happened?: Her label was not the most supportive and she had problems with album releases. She did a song with astronaut Chris Hadfield in 2014 though.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nAndy Stochansky\n\nThe Sound: Canadian Everclear\n\nThe Big Songs: “Wonderful”, “Stutter”\n\nThe Big Years: 2002\n\nWha Happened?: After years of working in Ani DiFranco’s shadow he finally released a successful solo album…but then failed to write a successful follow-up.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nDoctor\n\nThe Sound: 10% harder than The Watchmen\n\nThe Big Songs: “What Makes You Think He’s Lucky?”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004\n\nWha Happened?: Singer Daniel Greaves went back to Watchmen reunions, and also featured on a Neverending White Lights track.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nCopyright\n\nThe Sound: Theatrical alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: “Rock Machine”, “Transfiguration”\n\nThe Big Years: 1998-2001\n\nWha Happened?: I’m sure one of the CBC channels still plays them from time to time.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nJersey\n\nThe Sound: punk. just punk.\n\nThe Big Songs: “Generation Genocide”\n\nThe Big Years: 2003\n\nWha Happened?: Punks got eyeliner and keyboards.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nMudmen\n\nThe Sound: bagpipe-core/lad-core\n\nThe Big Songs: “Saturday”\n\nThe Big Years: 2002\n\nWha Happened?: Still played at Celtic bars every Saturday night.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Saint Alvia Cartel\n\nThe Sound: laid-back, man\n\nThe Big Songs: “Don’t Wanna Wait Forever”\n\nThe Big Years: 2008\n\nWha Happened?: one song then bye\n\n——————————————————-\n\nPanic & The Rebel Emergency\n\nThe Sound: laid-back, man\n\nThe Big Songs: “Wander Far Away”\n\nThe Big Years: 2008\n\nWha Happened?: one song then bye\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Miniatures\n\nThe Sound: Garage/post-punk\n\nThe Big Songs: “Dragonfly”, “Dead Flowers”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004, 2006\n\nWha Happened?: they just didn’t follow-up, man.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHeadstrong\n\nThe Sound: Not the TRAPT song, but close enough\n\nThe Big Songs: “Adriana”\n\nThe Big Years: 2002\n\nWha Happened?: They fought over their band name with another band and then they were no more.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nRon Hawkins & The Rusty Nails\n\nThe Sound: Punk version of Lowest of the Low\n\nThe Big Songs: “Bite Down Hard”\n\nThe Big Years: 2000\n\nWha Happened?: I dunno! They had the one song.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nKing Cobb Steelie\n\nThe Sound: electronica\n\nThe Big Songs: “Home”, “Below the Stars”\n\nThe Big Years: 2000\n\nWha Happened?: They released an instrumental album in 2004 and then went away. I’m pretty sure lead singer Kevan Byrne is a big shot in the media industry now.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nTin Foil Phoenix\n\nThe Sound: NOT Nickelback\n\nThe Big Songs: “Neapolitan”, “Ms. Genova”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004\n\nWha Happened?: A big fuss was made over the fact that they were signed to 604 records but DID NOT sound like Nickelback. It was basically their elevator pitch. But then they just didn’t make any more music so…ok?\n\n——————————————————-\n\nJet Set Satellite\n\nThe Sound: grrr angry hard rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Best Way to Die”, “Baby Cool Your Jets”\n\nThe Big Years: 2001\n\nWha Happened?: Label issues, band issues, failure to capitalize on success of debut record, diminishing returns, probably broke up.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nProjet Orange\n\nThe Sound: french alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: “Tell All Your Friends”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004\n\nWha Happened?: Oui oui, zey deed not last past un album.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Dears\n\nThe Sound: swoony indie rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Lost in the Plot”\n\nThe Big Years: 2003\n\nWha Happened?: They were supposed to be the next big thing, everyone was going nuts for them!! Then they released like ten forgettable albums in a row. Not even kidding. But they are still together, making music for CBC Channel 8.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nBoys Night Out\n\nThe Sound: punk, emo\n\nThe Big Songs: “Waking”\n\nThe Big Years: 2005\n\nWha Happened?: They hung around the local livejournal punk scene for a while, not sure if they are still mending broken hearts today.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nSandbox\n\nThe Sound: Late 90s alternative.\n\nThe Big Songs: “Curious”\n\nThe Big Years: 1998\n\nWha Happened?: People were no longer curious about them. Is this the band with the glasses guy from Trailer Park Boys in it?\n\n——————————————————-\n\nSee Spot Run\n\nThe Sound: Hear Spot rip off Spacehog\n\nThe Big Songs: “Weightless”\n\nThe Big Years: 2000? 2001?\n\nWha Happened?: People realized the song was an unabashed rip-off of Spacehog’s “In the Meantime”.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nCrowned King\n\nThe Sound: ska-emo\n\nThe Big Songs: “Don’t Wanna Go”\n\nThe Big Years: 2003\n\nWha Happened?: Pretty sure they waited three years just to make a music video for “Don’t Wanna Go”…not a good move.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Junction\n\nThe Sound: whimsical jangly Toronto\n\nThe Big Songs: “My Love Was There”\n\nThe Big Years: 2008-2010\n\nWha Happened?: Eventually, like all the other Tokyo Police Club clones, they fell off the map. The drummer now plays in a hip-hop cover band called Wing Night.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nBeast\n\nThe Sound: confident alt-pop\n\nThe Big Songs: “Mr. Hurricane”\n\nThe Big Years: 2008\n\nWha Happened?: Didn’t catch on.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nDinosaur Bones\n\nThe Sound: Yet another jangly tokyo police club clone\n\nThe Big Songs: “NYE”\n\nThe Big Years: 2011\n\nWha Happened?: Well one of the jangly whimsical indie rock bands had to be completely forgotten, it just happened to be these guys… and Plants & Animals…and Still Life Still.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nhHead\n\nThe Sound: amateur hour alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: “Collide”\n\nThe Big Years: 1992-1994\n\nWha Happened?: Member Brendan Canning later joined By Divine Right, then got super artsy and started Canada’s premier sound collective, Broken Social Scene.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHayden\n\nThe Sound: Angry grungy folk man\n\nThe Big Songs: “In September”\n\nThe Big Years: 1995\n\nWha Happened?: I think he became a less angry folk singer or something.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nGlueleg\n\nThe Sound: cheesy rap rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Pistons”\n\nThe Big Years: 1998\n\nWha Happened?: they were too cheesy to survive and melted in a puddle of melted cheese.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nKittie\n\nThe Sound: GiRl KoRn\n\nThe Big Songs: “Brackish”\n\nThe Big Years: 2001\n\nWha Happened?: They were all the rage with the goth girls at the mall, but then those girls grew up.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nRusty\n\nThe Sound: Canada’s Pearl Jam\n\nThe Big Songs: “Misogyny”, “Wake Me”\n\nThe Big Years: 90’s\n\nWha Happened?: Not much after the 90s ended\n\n——————————————————-\n\nScratching Post\n\nThe Sound: Canadian Veruca Salt\n\nThe Big Songs: “Bloodflame”\n\nThe Big Years: 1999\n\nWha Happened?: There can only be one Veruca Salt. Sidenote: They played Mike Bullard’s short-lived late night show. So much Canadian in one sentence!\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThousand Foot Krutch\n\nThe Sound: First, nu metal, then…???\n\nThe Big Songs: “Phenomenon”, “Rawkfist”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004\n\nWha Happened?: Honestly, I’m not sure. They were a Christian nu metal band that somehow managed to not only survive the decade, but played the decidedly hipster Wayhome Festival in 2015. Kudos?\n\n——————————————————-\n\nAshley MacIsaac\n\nThe Sound: Experimental fiddle-based alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: “Sleepy Maggie”\n\nThe Big Years: 1997\n\nWha Happened?: Personal issues arose for the man behind the project and he could no longer continue. Unclear if he still fiddles.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nProject Wyze\n\nThe Sound: Juggalos of the north\n\nThe Big Songs: “Room to Breathe”\n\nThe Big Years: 2001\n\nWha Happened?: Unfortunately the demand for Insane Clown Posse style groups isn’t as strong here in Canada so this menacing, spooky rap group didn’t last very long. A side project called Dead Celebrity Status didn’t do well either. Shoulda slapped on the face paint and moved south.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nRobin Black and the Intergalactic Rockstars\n\nThe Sound: Bar room glam rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “So Sick of You”\n\nThe Big Years: 2002\n\nWha Happened?: Too late for the 80’s, too early for the 80’s revival, Robin Black and pals wanted to be famous really really bad but it just didn’t work out. He’s an MMA commentator now though, so good for him.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nState of Shock\n\nThe Sound: Theory of a Deadman 2.0\n\nThe Big Songs: “Best I Ever Had”, “Money Honey”\n\nThe Big Years: 2007\n\nWha Happened?: A copy of a copy of a copy of a copy…I think Canadians were satisfied with one Theory of a Deadman.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nJJ and the Pillars\n\nThe Sound: Mumford and Sons go punk\n\nThe Big Songs: “The Wolves”\n\nThe Big Years: 2014\n\nWha Happened?: JJ kept doing cover songs on Instagram instead of working on new music.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nTier 5:\n\nThese bands are almost entirely forgotten by the public at large. Whether or not that is a good thing is up to your personal taste.\n\nAndrew F\n\nThe Sound: Privilege-core\n\nThe Big Song: “The End”\n\nThe Big Year: 2008\n\nWha Happened?: Andrew Franks managed to game the system and had his rich parents bankroll his reckless whining on iTunes, causing him to enter the top 10 songs chart. Then real people actually heard the music and abandoned him quickly. Now plays in a less-sad band called The Ashley Hundred.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nBlush\n\nThe Sound: Straight up nu-metal\n\nThe Big Songs: “Word From the Wise”\n\nThe Big Years: 2003\n\nWha Happened?: Wow finding these guys on the internet is really hard. I have no idea what their deal was, only that they apparently existed at one point. I might be the only person who has a copy of their song “Word From The Wise”.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nScott B Sympathy\n\nThe Sound: Smart-rock\n\nThe Big Song: “Drinking With The Poet”\n\nThe Big Year: 1993\n\nWha Happened?: Overshadowed by the Rheostatics. Played with other traditional rock outfits in the Toronto scene for a while. Current whereabouts unknown.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHail The Villain\n\nThe Sound: Neckbeard rock\n\nThe Big Song: “Take Back the Fear”\n\nThe Big Year: 2010\n\nWha Happened?: Divine intervention prevented any more damage from being done to the public’s ears; the comic book gimmick didn’t take.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nMiller Stain Limit\n\nThe Sound: Late 90’s rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Cellophane”\n\nThe Big Years: 1999\n\nWha Happened?: The year 2000.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Full Nine\n\nThe Sound: Garage rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Not Over”\n\nThe Big Years: 2002\n\nWha Happened?: They stayed in the garage because of legal issues with Disney and it was, in fact, over.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nTemplar\n\nThe Sound: Snowboarding montage music\n\nThe Big Songs: “The Need”\n\nThe Big Years: 2000\n\nWha Happened?: Finding their material on the internet was hard enough, as they are incredibly obscure. I have no idea what happened to them but I can only assume they didn’t make it through the great rap-rock extinction event of 2004.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHigh Holy Days\n\nThe Sound: Canadian Creed\n\nThe Big Songs: “All My Real Friends”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004\n\nWha Happened?: I suppose most Canadians weren’t too thrilled with a Canadian version of Creed.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nBreach of Trust\n\nThe Sound: Northern Saskatchewan hard rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Bad Trip”\n\nThe Big Years: 2004\n\nWha Happened?: They disappeared back into the mysterious snow storm they came from.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nCreature\n\nThe Sound: trashy alt-pop\n\nThe Big Songs: N/A\n\nThe Big Years: N/A\n\nWha Happened?: People confused them with Beast, who were already obscure enough.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHexes and Ohs\n\nThe Sound: Canadian Matt & Kim\n\nThe Big Songs: “H-h-highschool”\n\nThe Big Years: N/A\n\nWha Happened?: ?\n\n——————————————————-\n\nDriver\n\nThe Sound: Her-laughing-at-him-core\n\nThe Big Songs: “She Laughed At Me”\n\nThe Big Years: 2005\n\nWha Happened?: She laughed at them.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nCrush Luther\n\nThe Sound: White boy reggae\n\nThe Big Songs: “City Girl”\n\nThe Big Years: 2005\n\nWha Happened?: They just didn’t break out like they were supposed to. Producer Darrin Pfeiffer (of Goldfinger fame) was supposed to make them stars but due to some circumstances it just didn’t happen.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nFlashlight Brown\n\nThe Sound: generic pop punk\n\nThe Big Songs: “Patricia”\n\nThe Big Years: 2003\n\nWha Happened?: I’ll tell you what happened. They were pimped mercilessly on the radio by a DJ friend of theirs for months and failed to catch on because people just. didn’t. like. them. Fortunately we never had to hear them after that.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nC’mon\n\nThe Sound: Trews 2.0\n\nThe Big Songs: “Desperate Hearts”\n\nThe Big Years: 2005\n\nWha Happened?: Despite being featured on the soundtrack of the hit Hollywood movie The Covenant, I don’t think they lasted very long.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nCrystal Pistol\n\nThe Sound: Dirty, sleazy rock n’ roll (their words, not mine)\n\nThe Big Songs: “Rockstar”\n\nThe Big Years: 2005\n\nWha Happened?: Probably still on the hair metal bar circuit.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nStatic in Stereo\n\nThe Sound: Side project rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Before My Time”\n\nThe Big Years: 2001\n\nWha Happened?: They couldn’t replicate Limblifter’s success.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nRides Again\n\nThe Sound: Angry post-nu-metal rock\n\nThe Big Song: “Infected”\n\nThe Big Year: 2008\n\nWha Happened?: Hard rock was already commercially dead at the point these guys came around, and choosing a name that sounds like “Rise Against” didn’t help them stand out.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nMemory Bank\n\nThe Sound: Soaring post-punk revival\n\nThe Big Songs: “Bleed Like a Hero”\n\nThe Big Years: —\n\nWha Happened?: I heard their song once on the radio and then never heard about them again ever.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nStaggered Crossing\n\nThe Sound: Rock rock\n\nThe Big Songs: “Further Again”\n\nThe Big Years: 2001\n\nWha Happened?: Well according to last.fm they are huge superstars and are touring with Pearl Jam and are really great and are gonna be big any minute now so, good luck with that I guess?\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThrush Hermit\n\nThe Sound: Pre-Trews Trews\n\nThe Big Songs: The Day We Hit the Coast\n\nThe Big Years: 1999\n\nWha Happened?: They were part of the same East Coast music scene that Sloan were, but couldn’t replicate that band’s long-term success.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nChange of Heart\n\nThe Sound: Early alternative\n\nThe Big Songs: —\n\nThe Big Years: Early 90s\n\nWha Happened?: Despite being on the forefront of the Canadian alternative rock movement, Change of Heart didn’t write any songs that launched them into the same stratosphere as their peers or later alternative acts.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nThe Barstool Prophets\n\nThe Sound: —\n\nThe Big Songs: —\n\nThe Big Years: —\n\nWha Happened?: please no more bands"
