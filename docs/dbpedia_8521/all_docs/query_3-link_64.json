        "text": "The best blue light blocking glasses (a.k.a. blue light glasses) have become an indispensable accessory, and it’s easy to see why: Between working from home, scrolling on your phone and watching TV, the amount of screen time you’re logging is likely at an all-time high. While there’s limited research on the topic, blue light emitted from these screens can cause eye strain, headaches and other health issues. The best blue light blocking glasses aim to protect your vision, reduce eye fatigue and preserve your circadian rhythms, so you sleep better at night.\n\nWe consulted eye care professionals for advice on where to buy the best blue light blocking glasses and we also reviewed online testimonials from consumers who purchased and used these products. Many of the retailers on this list have also been tested by the Forbes Vetted staff and contributors who personally wear and highly recommend these glasses for convenient all-day protection.\n\nBest Blue Light Blocking Glasses Overall: Eyebuydirect\n\nBest Affordable Blue Light Blocking Glasses: Zenni\n\nBest Variety Of Blocking Blue Light Glasses: GlassesUSA\n\nBest Prescription Blue Light Blocking Glasses: Warby Parker\n\nMost Protective Blue Light Blocking Glasses: Felix Gray\n\nBest Blue Light Blocking Reader Glasses: Look Optic\n\nBest Blue Light Blocking Glasses For Easy Shopping: Liingo\n\nBest Oversized Blue Light Blocking Glasses: DIFF Eyewear\n\nBest Blue Light Blocking Glasses For Quick Delivery: Amazon\n\nBest Durable Blue Light Blocking Glasses: Roka Hamilton\n\nEyeBuyDirect Coupons | 40% Off In February 2024\n\nHow We Chose The Best Blue Light Glasses\n\nChoosing a great pair of blue light glasses isn’t something we take lightly: After all, most of us spend hours in front of the screen every day. We consulted with two health professionals, assistant professor Phillip Yuhas, O.D., Ph.D. and ophthalmology professor Sunir J. Garg, M.D., to understand how blue light glasses work and what goes into choosing the right pair. We also research, edit and continually update this list to ensure we’re offering you the best options. To start, we surveyed the entire market, looking at specialist eyewear retailers and generalist marketplaces. Then we sorted through a range of styles and prices and considered features such as prescription and magnification. Lastly, we tested each site to discover how easy it was to try the glasses while carefully assessing refund policies and warranties.\n\nWhat Should I Consider When Buying Blue Light Glasses?\n\nFrom cheap, basic frames to prescription designer specs, there are thousands of blue light blocking glasses for every need and budget. Consider the points below to help you find your perfect pair.\n\nUsage\n\nFirst thing’s first: Do you want frames you can wear all day, including to work meetings? It might be worth spending a little more for a decent pair that’ll hold up (and make you feel polished in front of your colleagues). Or, if you also want to wear them to yoga, the gym or while running or playing sports, you may want to opt for a performance pair like the ROKA Evans Glasses, which are also available in prescription.\n\nIf you’re just looking for a pair for occasional use or you’re shopping for your kids, lower-cost styles that you can afford to lose and replace may be your best bet. That said, you don’t have to settle for generic, low-quality glasses. For instance, Zenni (above) offers affordable options that are also well-made, stylish and affordable.\n\nPrescription Options\n\nDo you already wear prescription glasses? Consider getting a pair that does double-duty with prescription blue light blocking glasses. Several of the retailers above let you customize your lenses with upgrades like a blue light-filtering coating.\n\nReturn Policy\n\nHigher-end blue light glasses can be a splurge, especially if they include prescription lenses. For pricier specs, especially, be sure to check the retailer’s return policy. Some give you a two-week window, some allow a one-time return for store credit, some charge a restocking fee and some don’t allow returns on custom orders.\n\nStrength Of Blue Light Blocking\n\nThe blue light blocking glasses featured in this article are everyday frames, not safety gear. In other words, the frames do offer protection from harmful blue lights but they do not have the yellow-tinted lenses that are made specifically for very heavy screen use instead of daily use. The frames in this article protect your eyes from blue light but they still have clear lenses and can be worn to work and in casual settings.\n\nIf you plan on using the frames for significant screen use, you may want to choose a pair that blocks out a higher amount of light, like Felix Gray’s Volta Blue Light Glasses, or even consider a pair of specs with tinted lenses like Roka’s Rise Lola 2.0 glasses, which block out 53% of artificial blue-light.\n\nWhat Is Blue Light?\n\nBlue light is one of the colors on the visible light spectrum. It has a short wavelength, which means that it produces more energy than other light colors. There are two types of blue light—natural (from the sun) and artificial (from devices like your phone, computer, tablet and TV). While exposure to natural blue light during the day isn’t much of a concern, regular exposure to artificial blue light has been linked to various problems, like eye strain, fatigue and headaches.\n\nIs Blue Light Really Bad For You?\n\nWhat’s so wrong with blue light? For one thing, it contributes to eye strain, and it can also increase the risk of macular degeneration and other vision complications. It can also affect your sleep by disrupting your circadian rhythm. And while we’re all exposed to the blue light that comes from the sun (it’s the blue wavelengths in sunlight), which actually boosts attention and mood during the day, it’s our exposure to blue light outside of daylight hours that can affect us in less desirable ways.\n\nDo Blue Light Blocking Glasses Really Work?\n\nIt depends who you ask. There isn’t a lot of research to support the use of these screen protection glasses says Phillip Yuhas, O.D., Ph.D., assistant professor in the College of Optometry at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. That said, the technology is still new. “Some patients do find that some blue light blocking glasses improve subjective comfort while viewing a screen,” Yuhas says.\n\nBlue light glasses may also help you get a better night’s sleep, says Sunir J. Garg, M.D., a professor of ophthalmology at the Retina Service of Wills Eye Hospital. “For some folks, exposing themselves to intense blue light at nighttime can screw up their internal clock,” he says. “That can mess up certain people’s sleep-wake cycles. There may be some advantage to people using blue light glasses at night if they’re having trouble sleeping.”\n\nHowever, Valerie Kattouf, OD, optometry professor and medical reviewer for All About Vision, says that consumers shouldn’t use blue light glasses as a “band aid” since blue light itself is one piece of the puzzle contributing to digital eye strain. “I notice that [most people] are quite aware that the excessive amount of time they spend on digital devices is often the culprit for visual symptoms [but] even with this awareness, they don’t want to address the problem directly and alter their habits,” says Kattouf.\n\nUltimately, the evidence is mostly anecdotal but wearing a pair of blue light glasses while looking at screens won’t hurt. However, if you have any additional concerns about your eyes or vision, your best bet is to consult with your eye doctor. In the meantime, make sure you’re also taking regular breaks or making an effort to reduce screen time when possible to help improve your eye health.\n\nWhat Are The Benefits Of Wearing Blue Light Glasses?\n\nA systematic review of multiple trials and case studies suggests that blue light glasses are beneficial for individuals with sleep disorders, jet lag or variable shift work schedules. (Makes sense, since those issues are all related to disruptions in circadian rhythm.) There are also people who claim that wearing blue light lenses have helped decrease eye fatigue and frequency of headaches—but of course, that’s all anecdotal.\n\nAre There Any Downsides To Blue Light Glasses?\n\nGenerally speaking, blue light glasses themselves won’t harm your eyes. However, they may not provide the protection you think you’re getting, which is why you’ll want to order your glasses from a reputable retailer or trusted eye care professional.\n\nAnother possible downside is the tint. Lenses that block substantial blue light tend to have a notable yellow or amber hue, which could distort how you perceive colors. (Superficially speaking, they also might not always look that appealing to wear.)\n\nWhat Is The Difference Between Blue Light Glasses And Computer Glasses?\n\n“’Computer glasses’ is a generic term that encompasses lens treatments and prescriptions to minimize the eye strain experienced by technology use,” says Kattouf. “Blue light lens treatments are just one option offered to patients who are seeking treatments for digital eyestrain.” Computer glasses could have lenses with blue light filters, but not always. Computer glasses may also contain anti-glare treatments so the lenses to help relax your eyes and these treatments typically offer different-colored tints to enhance eye comfort.\n\nAre Blue Light Glasses Covered By FSA Or HSA Plans?\n\nFlexible Spending Accounts (FSA) and Health Savings Accounts (HSA) are pre-tax saving plans with funds that can be used for certain approved medical expenses. Both FSA and HSA accounts typically cover prescription eyeglasses, including blue light blocking pairs. Many online retailers qualify for these plans but it’s worthwhile to browse the FAQs section for any exclusions and check the specifics of your own plan before purchasing.\n\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\n\nAt Forbes Vetted, we approach all of our product recommendations with transparency and a critical (yet fashionable) eye.
