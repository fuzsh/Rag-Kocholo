For the company, see Smiling Friends Inc.\n\nSmiling Friends is an American-Australian animated television series, created by and starring internet personalities Zach Hadel and Michael Cusack, airing on Adult Swim.\n\nThe pilot episode \"Desmond's Big Day Out\" aired on Adult Swim on April 1, 2020, and the rest of the first season premiered on January 9, 2022.\n\nOn February 9, 2022, the series was renewed for a second season[2] which premiered on May 12, 2024. Its first episode, \"Gwimbly: Definitive Remastered Enhanced Extended Edition DX 4K (Anniversary Director's Cut),\" aired on April 1, 2024 after puppet-ified versions of Season One episodes.\n\nA third season was announced at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival on June 14, 2024.[3]\n\nPremise\n\nSmiling Friends follows Smiling Friends Inc. employees Charlie, Pim, Allan, Glep, as well as their boss, Mr. Boss, as they face misadventures while trying to make people smile, or otherwise bring happiness to their clients.\n\nProduction information\n\nIn Early 2017, YouTubers Michael Cusack and Zach Hadel conceived the idea of a show titled Little Helpers, inspired by South Park and Seinfeld, while dining in a Californian chicken restaurant, which featured \"a group of loveable characters, with a simple kind of concept, which we could take anywhere we wanted to.\" The premise of these characters working at a hotline for unhappy people became the \"connective tissue there that made it all click together.\"[4][5]\n\nImages and Videos of this concept were posted in June 2017, and the first character shown in the concepts, Gremblo, became well known for a few months. Ultimately, all references to him and Little Helpers got wiped from Twitter sometime in 2018.\n\nOn April 1, 2020, a pilot named \"Desmond's Big Day Out\" premiered as a part of Adult Swim's annual April Fools Day event alongside another work of Cusack's, YOLO: Crystal Fantasy.\n\nOn May 19, 2021, Adult Swim and the show's creators announced that the series had been greenlit along with Royal Crackers and that it was set to premiere later in 2021.\n\nOn July 22, 2021, co-creator Zach Hadel announced that Season One would contain eight episodes, including the pilot, \"Desmond's Big Day Out\", which would end up being considered the first episode of the season.[5]\n\nOn November 12, 2021, during the Adult Swim Festival panel featuring Smiling Friends, co-creator Zach Hadel mentioned the series would premiere \"within a few months\", pushing the release schedule to 2022.\n\nAfter overwhelmingly positive reception from viewers, on February 9, 2022, Adult Swim renewed the series for a second season along with Birdgirl. The first episode of the second season was previewed on April 1, 2024, with the rest of the season premiering on May 12, 2024.[2]\n\nOn June 13, 2024 at Annecy International Animation Film Festival, it was announced the series was renewed for a third season.[3]\n\nCast\n\nMain\n\nZach Hadel as Charlie, Glep, Jason, Desmond's Mom, Bliblies, Screaming Bird, Meep Society Lady, Mr. Frog Fanboy, Salt, Century Egg, Mip, Gnarly, DJ Spit, Mr. Peanut, Ronald Reagan, Satan, Charlie's Grandma, Glep's Grandson, Duncan, Gwimbly\n\nMichael Cusack as Pim, Allan, Amy, Pim's Mom, Steven, Bliblies, Lucas the Magnificent, Mr. Frog, Rex, Ketchup, Pepper, The Witch, Fairies, Grim, Warren Buffett, Demon, Jeremy, MeepEats Deliveryman, James, Professor Psychotic\n\nMarc M. as The Boss, Guy At The Airport, Goblin, Bill Nye\n\nRecurring/Guest-Starring\n\nMike Stoklasa as Desmond, himself, Purple alien\n\nFinn Wolfhard as Man Living in Wall, Bliblies\n\nNick Wolfhard as Graham Nelly, Bliblies\n\nDavid Dore as Party Bro, Forest Demon, Alien, Armzo\n\nTom Fulp as Alpha\n\nPerry Caravello as Simon S.

The color represents Smormu in the first season and Jombo in the second season.\n\nZach Hadel, the series' co-creator, is better known online as psychicpebbles, and got his start in animation on Newgrounds.\n\nHe and Chris O'Neill (OneyNG; series' composer for additional music and a minor voice actor) collaborate together frequently on YouTube channel OneyPlays.\n\nLikewise, many cast and crew members experienced in creating web content, predominantly videos or animations (on Newgrounds) have worked on the series; from cameos (Tom Fulp, creator of Newgrounds, as Alpha in \"Desmond's Big Day Out,\" Doug Walker (Nostaliga Critic) as Daniel the Demon Slayer in \"Erm, the Boss Finds Love?,\" etc.) to crew member roles (David Hootselle (shigloo) as directing (animation) and storyboarding, Chris O'Neill composing \"Brown Smile,\" the outro theme song, etc.).\n\nMany aspects of the series - such as the design for Mr. Boss - were likely lifted from Zach and Michael's initial Adult Swim pitch, Little Helpers.\n\nWith the upcoming release of Rick and Morty: The Anime, Michael Cusack and Zach Hadel have considered doing an anime-related episode of sorts, though not necessarily an anime adaptation.[8]\n\nSmiling Friends on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nSmiling Friends on the Internet Movie Database\n\nSmiling Friends on Adult Swim\n\nSmiling Friends on Channel 4\n\nSmiling Friends on Max\n\nReferences"
