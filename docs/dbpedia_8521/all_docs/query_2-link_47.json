        "text": "14. Buffalo Sabres\n\nKonsta Helenius, C\n\nTeam: Jukurit (FINLAND) | Rank: 12\n\nDOB: 05/11/06 | Ht: 5-10.75 | Wt: 180 | Shot: R\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 51 | G: 14 | A: 22 | P: 36\n\nScouting notes: Helenius is excellent defensively, and his play is immediately projectable to the NHL. Offensively, he is effective, not flashy. He retrieves pucks, enters the zone with possession, creates space with effective body positioning and relies on his elite hockey sense to make sound decisions offensively. The combination of his competitiveness, hockey sense and puck management make him a highly effective and reliable player in all three zones.\n\nHe lacks dynamic attributes that other players in the draft class possess, but he makes up for that his in his ability to be the engine of his line. He consistently drives play and showed flashes of offensive creativity, but Helenius does not have a standout offensive attribute. He's a well-rounded, length-of-the-ice player who will be impactful on both sides of the puck at the NHL level. Scouts see some Mikael Backlund in him, which is high praise for the young Finn.\n\nA second-line center/top penalty killer who can drive play at even strength is something every contender needs. That is Helenius. If his offense develops, there's a chance he fits the mold of a Joel Eriksson Ek or Elias Lindholm type of player. -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: The Sabres traded down this week, acquiring the Devils' No. 42 overall pick in their flip-flop with the Sharks. Helenius is a solid two-way center who joins a depth chart that includes Tage Thompson, Dylan Cozens, Peyton Krebs, Matthew Savoie, Jiri Kulich and Noah Ostlund.\n\nObviously, some of them could shift to the wing, but the bottom line is that the Sabres have a ton of talent on the way up front, to go along with the foundational defensemen in Rasmus Dahlin and Owen Power. -- Wyshynski\n\n15. Detroit Red Wings\n\nMichael Brandsegg-Nygard, RW\n\nTeam: Mora (SWEDEN-2) | Rank: 19\n\nDOB: 10/05/05 | Ht: 6-1 | Wt: 198 | Shot: R\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 41 | G: 8 | A: 10 | P: 18\n\nScouting notes: The Norwegian forward is one of the most well-rounded players in the draft. The blend of grit, skill and in-tight scoring ability has scouts believing he is a Swiss Army knife at the NHL level. There is belief that he could be the best two-way forward in the draft not named Celebrini.\n\nDefensively, he may be the best forward in the draft. He is consistently in the right positions, makes excellent reads in defensive transition and reads off his teammates well to support the puck. His ability to retrieve pucks, win puck battles and position his body in ways that make it nearly impossible to knock him off the puck will only improve has he physically matures and adds strength. He's unafraid to deliver a board-shaking body check to shift momentum, but does not put himself out of position to do so. He separates opponents from the puck, drives forward and uses his powerful frame to cut to the middle or the net. If there is a weakness in his defensive game, I have yet to find it.\n\nThe drawback with Brandsegg-Nygard is that he isn't dynamic. His ceiling isn't as high as other players, but his floor is higher than nearly every forward outside of the top five. There is little doubt he will be a middle-six power forward who will be deployed to shut down opponent's best players and finish offensive opportunities in tight. As one scout put it, \"He isn't the guy you build around, but certainly the type of player that every contender wants in the middle of their lineup.\" -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: What's this? The Red Wings went into Europe and drafted a player?\n\nIn all seriousness, Brandsegg-Nygard was thought to be a player who could have gone in this range, so it wasn't like the Red Wings reached.\n\nDetroit has used two of its most recent first-round picks to get centers. It's just that Brandsegg-Nygard gives it another potential top-six winger. And given how the Wings are currently set up with their forward depth, Brandsegg-Nygard has a good chance to break onto the scene in the near future. -- Clark\n\n16. St. Louis Blues\n\nAdam Jiricek, D\n\nTeam: Plzen (CZECHIA) | Rank: 17\n\nDOB: 06/28/06 | Ht: 6-2.5 | Wt: 182 | Shot: R\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 19 | G: 0 | A: 1 | P: 1\n\nScouting notes: The 6-2, right-handed defenseman has been on scouting radars for years, allowing for his game to be put under the microscope. He's competitive, makes good puck decisions and activates in the play.\n\nLosing nearly a full season of development during the most crucial years makes for a more difficult evaluation and model projection. Jiricek's numbers are very volatile, and the draft year sample is not large enough for a confident projection. The tools to be an impactful defenseman are there, with good reads, aggressive defensive posture, strong puck retrieval skills and physicality. He needs the skating, which obviously took a developmental hit when he tore an ACL, to improve by a step and half or two to take advantage of his other skills. His stride lacks the explosive and aggressive attributes to complement the rest of his game and will hinder his ability to utilize other skills if he can't keep pace.\n\nHe has a longer runway to develop because he's inexperienced and lost nearly a year of development to his injury. There is a real chance he becomes a second-pairing defenseman and an outside shot at the top pair. -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: The Blues really needed to add some talent to their defense prospects -- they hadn't drafted a defenseman in the first round since Jordan Schmaltz in 2012 -- and Jiricek is a terrific choice. He gained great experience playing in the Czech league, and as a right-shot defenseman he's a valuable commodity.\n\nJiricek might not have the ceiling of his brother, David, who went sixth overall to the Blue Jackets in 2022, but he's certainly got some upside. -- Wyshynski\n\n17. Washington Capitals\n\nTerik Parascak, RW\n\nTeam: Prince George (WHL) | Rank: 30\n\nDOB: 05/28/06 | Ht: 5-11.5 | Wt: 173 | Shot: R\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 68 | G: 43 | A: 62 | P: 105\n\nScouting notes: His production is reminiscent of a player who should be selected in top half of the first round. His skating, like Jason Robertson's in 2017, worries scouts. He doesn't have the physical package of Robertson, but his production is much better. Parascak has all the capabilities to be a dual threat at the NHL level if his skating improves.\n\nParascak's instincts on and off the puck are high-end. He understands defensive schemes and how to penetrate them, but his skating holds him back from driving play. This is evident in transition, where he lacks the pace to attack the middle and relies on his instincts to find open space and arrive at the perfect time. When he gets the puck in space, he's terrifying. His catch and release shot, one-timer and ability to shoot opposite his momentum make him challenging for goalies to stop.\n\nA team taking Parascak is getting a player with an elite hockey sense and many shots in his arsenal. If he can add strength and more power to his skating, there is a real chance he's a top-six, difference-maker in the NHL. He's unlikely to be a true play driver, but a complementary player who can ignite a power play. -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: Using their first-round picks to select top-six forwards they believe can provide a sense of offensive consistency going forward has been the plan for the Caps the past few years. The decision to take Parascak fits within that dynamic. Parascak was one of a few forwards who could have been picked at this spot.\n\nWhen the time comes, he'll be the latest prospect to come through a farm system that has watched its AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears, win Calder Cups while continuing to send the organization's homegrown talents to the NHL. -- Clark\n\n18. Chicago Blackhawks\n\nSacha Boisvert, C\n\nTeam: Muskegon (USHL) | Rank: 24\n\nDOB: 03/17/06 | Ht: 6-2 | Wt: 176 | Shot: L\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 61 | G: 36 | A: 32 | P: 68\n\nScouting notes: Boisvert can really shoot the puck, and regardless of where he receives it, he is a threat. He gets pucks through layers with accuracy and has excellent hands to finish plays at the net front. There is reason to believe his deceptive release will transfer to the NHL level, but if it does not, his ability to finish plays in tight will surely make him worthy of attention.\n\nWithout the puck, Boisvert is still impactful. He tracks back well, disrupts transition play and delivers hard hits to separate players from the puck. There's a noticeable edge to his game that will only improve as he gets stronger. His skating posture is off balance, and he lacks the explosiveness required to create more space offensively. An improved skating stride with more power and better ability to read defensive coverage will allow Boisvert to take advantage of his NHL-ready shot and two-way game. -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: The assumption was that the Blackhawks would go with a forward here after taking Levshunov at second overall. Boisvert offers a great contrast to the way Connor Bedard plays at center -- a two-way game with some physicality. He aspires to be an Evgeni Malkin-like player in the NHL. Not a bad gamble for the Blackhawks to take, considering they already have their Sidney Crosby. -- Wyshynski\n\n19. Vegas Golden Knights\n\nTrevor Connelly, LW\n\nTeam: Tri-City (USHL) | Rank: 15\n\nDOB: 02/28/06 | Ht: 6-0.25 | Wt: 156 | Shot: L\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 52 | G: 31 | A: 47 | P: 78\n\nScouting notes: On talent and talent alone, the model projects him to be a top-six forward with a fair chance at a top-line role. There are only a few players with better offensive attributes than Connelly, and they will go in the top 10. He leaves a lot to be desired defensively but should get a healthy dose of development at Providence College. He is unlikely to be a two-way player, and that's not his style. His style is flash, dash and pizzazz -- a player with a true wow factor.\n\nConnelly has a lot of maturing to do on and off the ice. The selfish major and misconduct at the under-18 championship kick-started the collapse against Canada in the gold medal game. Quite a few teams have designated him as \"do not draft\" due the information revealed in a story from The Athletic. As one NHL head scout put it, \"top-10 talent, bottom-10 character. Can't do it.\"\n\nThe definition of high-risk, high-reward for all the wrong reasons. -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: There's a possibility that the Golden Knights have reached the point that they could start to incorporate prospects as they continue to challenge for the Stanley Cup. It's possible that drafting Connolly could work out one of two ways for the Golden Knights. He could be a player who works his way into the lineup as a productive winger on a team-friendly deal to help offset some of their salary cap issues. Or he could be used in a potential trade to help the Golden Knights get a player they covet.\n\nWhatever path the Golden Knights take, it'll come with the win-at-all costs mentality that's continued to define them. -- Clark\n\n20. New York Islanders\n\nCole Eiserman, LW\n\nTeam: USA U-18 (NTDP) | Rank: 9\n\nDOB: 08/29/06 | Ht: 6-0 | Wt: 195 | Shot: L\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 49 | G: 49 | A: 27 | P: 76\n\nScouting notes: Eiserman is considered the best pure scorer in the draft, though opinions about him vary widely.\n\nHis impressive goal totals with the national team development program are hard to ignore, yet he often leaves scouts wanting more. With the best shot in the draft, his projection suggests he could score 35 to 40 goals per season if he reaches his ceiling. As a young player in the draft, he has more runway to improve his decision-making and develop a well-rounded offensive game. While habits can be fixed and skating will continue to improve, scoring instincts and the ability to catch and release the puck from awkward positions are innate, and Eiserman excels in both areas.\n\nThere are times he tries to do too much with the puck, leading to turnovers and forced shots -- habits that can frustrate scouts and coaches. Despite this, his potential as a 40-goal scorer is undeniable if developed with patience. The model is confident he will produce at the NHL level in a top-six role. Eiserman has the talent to be an even-strength scorer, power-play asset and most importantly, a difference-maker. -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: Leave it to Lou Lamoriello to punch consensus in the face. Cole Eiserman is one of the best goal-scorers in the draft, whose stock had fallen due to criticisms of his defensive game. The Islanders certainly needed an infusion of high-end offensive talent in their prospect pool. Eiserman is the embodiment of the \"you can't teach offense\" mindset. -- Wyshynski\n\n21. Montreal Canadiens\n\nMichael Hage, C\n\nTeam: Chicago (USHL) | Rank: 18\n\nDOB: 04/14/06 | Ht: 6-0.5 | Wt: 187 | Shot: R\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 54 | G: 33 | A: 42 | P: 75\n\nScouting notes: A big, right-handed center who is a dual threat in the offensive zone and showed one of the most promising development curves of the season? Check. Check. Check. A dynamic transitioner of the puck, Hage is a cerebral player who picks apart defensive schemes in transition with ease. He gets the puck off the wall to the dangerous areas of the ice better than most players in the draft.\n\nThe deceptiveness of his shot and the array of shots in his arsenal makes him equally dangerous with and without the puck. He can pull the puck and fire it through defenders as easily as he receives the puck and releases in a single motion. A heady player, Hage understands how to manipulate defenders and open up shooting lanes. If he can add a step to his pace, he will be able to take advantage of the compromising positions he puts defenders in.\n\nThere are many parts of Hage's game that scouts love outside of his physical gifts. He wins puck battles, gets to the net front and makes his teammates better. He will develop hard skill by improving his ability to take contact and use it to his advantage. The details of his game are a strong point. He supports the puck well, and his ability to impact the game will only improve as his skating takes a step. The model sees him as a middle-six player with an outside chance at hitting his second-line ceiling. -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: After taking Demidov at No. 5, the Canadiens used their second first-round pick to take another forward in Hage. The expectation with Hage is that he could give them a two-way center for the future.\n\nHypothetically speaking, the Canadiens might not be in any rush, as they're set up with Nick Suzuki and Alex Newhook down the middle for at least three more years. Hage will spend next season playing at the University of Michigan which has recently developed a number of centers such as Matty Beniers, Thomas Bordeleau and Brendan Brisson, among others. -- Clark\n\n22. Nashville Predators\n\nYegor Surin, C\n\nTeam: Yaroslavl Jr. (RUSSIA-JR.) | Rank: 44\n\nDOB: 08/01/06 | Ht: 6-1 | Wt: 192 | Shot: L\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 43 | G: 23 | A: 30 | P: 53\n\nTeam fit: Barry Trotz goes forward first again, after selecting Matthew Wood at No. 15 last season. Yegor Surin's stock reportedly shot up after participating in agent Dan Milstein's camp in Fort Lauderdale during the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nHe certainly fits the Predators' identity under Trotz and head coach Andrew Brunette of compete level up front. -- Wyshynski\n\n23. Anaheim Ducks\n\nStian Solberg, D\n\nTeam: Valerenga (NORWAY) | Rank: 36\n\nDOB: 12/29/05 | Ht: 6-2 | Wt: 194 | Shot: L\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 42 | G: 5 | A: 10 | P: 15\n\nTeam fit: Solberg gives the Ducks another defensemen for the future in a farm system in which blueliners are in excess. They already have Jackson LaCombe, Pavel Mintyukov and Olen Zellweger, plus Tristan Luneau. But they also have a pair of defenseman older than 32 in Cam Fowler and Radko Gudas.\n\nIn short order, the Ducks could potentially have five homegrown defensemen, or they could look to move one of them in the future if it can help them swing a deal to address another area of the roster. -- Clark\n\n24. Utah Hockey Club\n\nCole Beaudoin, C\n\nTeam: Barrie (OHL) | Rank: 32\n\nDOB: 04/24/06 | Ht: 6-2 | Wt: 209 | Shot: L\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 67 | G: 28 | A: 34 | P: 62\n\nScouting notes: Combine an elite motor, good two-way play and a healthy dose of compete, Cole Beaudoin is simply a gamer. If I were giving each draft-eligible a superlative or vibe, Beaudoin's would be \"gamer.\" The model is lower on him than this ranking, but the belief that he should become a bottom-six player that checks well, kills penalties and bring energy to the lineup.\n\nA big, strong player who may be most effective on the wing at the NHL level, Beaudoin reads the play well, gets into traffic, wins nearly every puck battle and grinds opponents down. There is no OHL player who enjoys going into the corner with him -- and more than a few came out worse for wear. He's got the strength and desire to be an impactful physical player in the NHL. If his skating continues to improve, there is reason to believe he has a higher ceiling than current projections indicate. Utah will need a more patient approach with him, but added pace could see him jump into a third-line role as a player coaches trust implicitly. -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: GM Bill Armstrong had a treasure trove of draft picks and decided to dip into them swap with Colorado, sending the 38th, 71st and the Rangers' 2025 second-rounder to the Avalanche. That's because it was widely expected that the Bruins were going to select Beaudoin with the next selection.\n\nUtah gets a strong center who plays with physical tenacity, a puck-swarming forward that fits in well on the UHC depth chart. -- Wyshynski\n\n25. Boston Bruins\n\nDean Letourneau, C\n\nTeam: St. Andrews College (HIGH-ON) | Rank: 34\n\nDOB: 02/21/06 | Ht: 6-6 | Wt: 210 | Shot: R\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 56 | G: 61 | A: 66 | P: 127\n\nTeam fit: Letourneau gives the Bruins extreme size down the middle. The fact he scored more than 60 goals and 127 points proves there is offensive upside, too.\n\nHe'll attend Boston College starting in 2025, so the Bruins can keep a close eye on his development. Perhaps the most fascinating part is that the Bruins are hoping to strike it rich with Letourneau given they've only had four draft picks since 2018 who have reached the NHL. -- Clark\n\n26. Los Angeles Kings\n\nLiam Greentree, RW\n\nTeam: Windsor (OHL) | Rank: 16\n\nDOB: 01/01/06 | Ht: 6-2.25 | Wt: 207 | Shot: L\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 64 | G: 36 | A: 54 | P: 90\n\nScouting notes: Greentree has many attributes that scouts love -- he plays in the middle of the ice, sees the ice very well, is an adept playmaker and a throwback build in the style of a power forward. He ranks highly across the board from his physical game to his hockey sense to his high-end playmaking. He lacks in the most important, yet most easily improvable, area: skating. Were Greentree an average or slightly above average skater, he likely would've been a top-10 pick because he's that good in the other areas of his game.\n\nGreentree was effectively a one-man show on a rebuilding Windsor team. His production is likely 20% better on a team that doesn't finish near the bottom of the OHL standings. Not only is he a quality offensive driver, but he is also reliable defensively. He gets himself in good positions, wins puck battles and routinely outmuscles opponents all over the ice. He's fun to watch because you wonder how he is as effective as he is with his skating deficiencies.\n\nScouts and executives have expressed an admiration for his game. His puckhandling, vision and shot make him a problem to deal with in the offensive zone. There are a lot of tools to work with and wouldn't be the first prospect to improve his skating after being drafted. The problem with Greentree's skating is that it is enough of a concern in today's league that if it doesn't improve, he may not be able to keep up. Functionally big and skilled power wingers are hard to find nowadays, and Greentree is exactly that. If he does add a step or two to his game, there's a good chance he's a top-six point producer at the NHL level. -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: The Kings picked up this pick when Montreal traded up to No. 21 to select center Michael Hage. Greentree was captain of the Windsor Spitfires, and has a big body and a smart offensive game.\n\nHe joins a group of young forwards with the Kings that includes burgeoning star Quinton Byfield, Alex Laferriere and hopefully Alex Turcotte, who hasn't developed as quickly as the others. Most importantly, Liam Greentree wore No. 66 in the OHL and would automatically become our favorite player if he had the audacity of wearing Mario Lemieux's sacred digits in the NHL. -- Wyshynski\n\n27. Chicago Blackhawks\n\nMarek Vanacker, LW\n\nTeam: Brantford (OHL) | Rank: HM\n\nDOB: 04/12/06 | Ht: 6-0.5 | Wt: 174 | Shot: L\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 68 | G: 36 | A: 46 | P: 82\n\nTeam fit: It simply wasn't enough to draft Levshunov and Boisvert in the first round. Blackhawks GM Kyle Davidson traded up to get the 27th pick to take Mark Vanacker, a decision that adds to what they believe is a bright future.\n\nVanacker gives the Blackhawks a winger they could potentially see at the NHL level in a few years. While their rebuild starts and ends with Bedard, getting Vanacker means the Blackhawks have used seven first-round picks to draft forwards since 2020. -- Clark\n\n28. Calgary Flames\n\nMatvei Gridin, RW\n\nTeam: Muskegon (USHL) | Rank: HM\n\nDOB: 03/01/06 | Ht: 6-1.25 | Wt: 182 | Shot: L\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 60 | G: 38 | A: 45 | P: 83\n\nTeam fit: The Flames acquired this pick in the Elias Lindholm trade with the Canucks. Lose a forward, gain a forward. Gridin led the USHL in points with 83 in 60 games, giving the rebuilding-and-or-retooling Flames another strong offensive winger.\n\nAnother Russian player who was spotlighted at the Dan Milstein camp during the Stanley Cup Final, he has a big frame for an agile skater. He's University of Michigan-bound, and the Flames will gladly wait for his skills to sharpen in the NCAA. -- Wyshynski\n\n29. Dallas Stars\n\nEmil Hemming, RW\n\nTeam: TPS (FINLAND) | Rank: 25\n\nDOB: 06/27/06 | Ht: 6-0.75 | Wt: 201 | Shot: R\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 40 | G: 7 | A: 4 | P: 11\n\nScouting notes: Hemming is a fun topic of discussion among scouts. He's considered to have a very high floor and lower offensive ceiling. The model sees him fitting in quite well as a third-line forward who can contribute offensively. Hemming is one of the few players who the model predicts he has more than an 80% chance of playing 200 NHL games with less than a 10% chance of becoming a star -- true \"safe\" vibes.\n\nHe's a strong two-way player with a quality release that borders on being a separating skill. He can shoot off both legs, off balance and in many catch-and-release positions. He's a threat to score from distance, gets pucks through defenders and can score when he drives the net. He understands how to use contact to his advantage, wins puck battles, is in excellent spots off the puck and never cheats defensively. Those hard skills should easily translate into a bottom-six role, and he's likely ready for the AHL next season.\n\nOffensively, there have been flashes of good puck distribution and hockey sense. However, he is reliant on his shooting ability and two-way play. If he can add a step to his skating, there is legitimate upside as a power forward who contributes 40 to 50 points per season, playing on a top penalty-killing unit and secondary power-play unit. The ceiling isn't as high as that of other players, but he is far more likely to play meaningful games. -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: No matter who the Stars selected at No. 29, the pick was going to be met with the expectation that they would be the latest success story in Dallas' prospect pipeline. So the fact they took Emil Hemming only adds to the belief that he could be the next prospect who might be able to contribute quickly.\n\nHe had 11 goals and 18 points in 13 games while playing against under-20 competition in Finland, while scoring seven goals and 11 points in 40 points against older competition in Liiga, the highest level of hockey in the nation. -- Clark\n\n30. New York Rangers\n\nEJ Emery, D\n\nTeam: USA U-18 (NTDP) | Rank: 28\n\nDOB: 03/30/06 | Ht: 6-3 | Wt: 185 | Shot: R\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 53 | G: 0 | A: 11 | P: 11\n\nScouting notes: Emery has the makings of an impactful defenseman who can anchor a second pairing. Emery is a perfect complementary piece to an elite offensive defenseman who needs a reliable partner to augment their game.\n\nEmery is a top transition defenseman, whose one-on-one defensive play stands out. He maintains excellent posture, effectively uses his stick to guide opponents, takes away passes and pokes pucks off opponent's sticks. In transition, he maintains good gap control, doesn't allow attackers to beat him to the outside and forces them to relinquish the puck. When the game needs a calming presence, the opponent's best players kept off the scoresheet and a quality defensive play, Emery is that player. From that perspective, he is a coach's dream. His defensive development this season has me believing he will continue to improve and likely become one of the best defenders in the draft class.\n\nOffensively, there is not a lot there. That isn't Emery's calling card. That is likely why the model doesn't project him to be more than a second-pairing defenseman. He makes simple breakout passes and doesn't get caught up ice. While that is generally concerning, as a lack of offense at the junior level leads to a less confident statistical projection, his ability to defend in all three zones, skate well and win physical battles should make him a top-four defenseman in the NHL. -- Doerrie\n\nTeam fit: There was a sense ahead of the draft that if the Rangers kept this pick, they were going defense. They selected a solid one here.\n\nEmery is a right-handed shot who skates well and has a strong physical game without chasing hits. He projects to be a top-four defenseman. It's not difficult to see Emery as a protégé for Rangers standout K'Andre Miller at the NHL level, and a part of that blue line with younger Rangers like Miller and Braden Schneider. -- Wyshynski\n\n31. Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nBen Danford, D\n\nTeam: Oshawa (OHL) | Rank: HM\n\nDOB: 02/06/06 | Ht: 6-1 | Wt: 188 | Shot: R\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 64 | G: 1 | A: 32 | P: 33\n\nTeam fit: Trading down created questions about what the Leafs would do with the second-to-last pick of the first round. They answered by drafting defenseman Danford.\n\nHe provides them with a player who could help strengthen the blue line in the Leafs' farm system. As a team pushing for titles, the Leafs are up against the salary cap each year, so having a player who can help in the near future on an entry-level deal is a boost. -- Clark\n\n32. Edmonton Oilers\n\nSam O'Reilly, RW\n\nTeam: London (OHL) | Rank: HM\n\nDOB: 03/30/06 | Ht: 6-1 | Wt: 178 | Shot: R\n\n2023-24 stats: GP: 68 | G: 20 | A: 36 | P: 56\n\nTeam fit: The Oilers acquired this pick from the Flyers, who acquired it from the Panthers in the Claude Giroux trade, so it's good to see Edmonton finally take something that belonged to Florida.\n\nEdmonton was willing to mortgage a first-rounder in either 2025 or 2026 for O'Reilly, who earned his stripes as a tremendous defender but had 56 points in 68 games for the London Knights last season. And that's really the key here: O'Reilly went through the Hunter brothers system in London, meaning he's prepped to be an NHL player.\n\nEdmonton CEO Jeff Jackson, running the hockey operations show now that Ken Holland parted ways, has always been a fan of London GM Mark Hunter. Suppose we'll find out how big that fandom is now that the Oilers need a general manager. Stay tuned. -- Wyshynski\n\nRound 2\n\n33.
