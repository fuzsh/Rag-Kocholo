Blue in Green comprises a Canadian concert by the Bill Evans Trio. Pianist Evans, bassist Eddie Gomez, and drummer Marty Morell had been playing regularly together since 1969 (Gomez had joined the group back in 1966). The tight and almost telepathic musical communication between the musicians, the strong repertoire (six Evans originals, a pair of ballads, and "So What?"), and the appreciative audience make this a fairly definitive recording by this classic trio.
