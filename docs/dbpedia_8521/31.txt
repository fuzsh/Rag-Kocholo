Toronto, Ontario, Canada-based rock band EVANS BLUE is back to work at The Pocket Studios this week, recording its third album with producer Trevor Kustiak. The self-titled album marks the debut of new frontman Dan Chandler, who was selected after an intensive six-month nationwide search. Singer/songwriter Chandler hails from St. Louis, Missouri.

With the addition of Chandler and the energy that he brings to the mix, the band is writing their best and most diverse collection of songs to date. The new material stays true to the core fans with signature dark and heavy riffs, but it is simultaneously uplifting. EVANS BLUE has evolved, and these five musicians are ready to take the band to a higher level. EVANS BLUE fans can expect a new single in April, with the new album to be released on June 23 on Sounds+Sights, coinciding with a U.S. tour this summer.
