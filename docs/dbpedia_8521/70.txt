Origins (2005)

Evans Blue came together in early 2005. Five musicians, then in three separate bands, met through a local musician's message board. Lead singer Kevin Matisyn suggested the name, which refers to the dye that is injected into the bloodstream to measure blood volume, which he had read in one of his medical books. The band then caught the attention of producer Trevor Kustiak (Cool for August) and his partner Mari Dew, of The Pocket Studios. The original lead guitarist, Kevin Smith, left due to personal reasons before the group secured a record label.

They recorded three demo songs, titled "Black Hole", "Saturnalia" and "Starlight", all of which were available on their personal MySpace page. At that time, updates on the bands' progress and prose by former lead singer, Kevin Matisyn were periodically given via the MySpace blogs.

The Melody... and tours (2006–2007)

Evans Blue completed work on their debut album, The Melody and the Energetic Nature of Volume, in November 2005. Their first single, "Cold (But I'm Still Here)" hit airwaves in December and was later accompanied by a music video. The album was released February 21, 2006 through The Pocket Recordings/Hollywood Records. It debuted at No. 1 and spent several weeks in the top 10 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart and spawned a second single, "Over".

In late March 2006, Evans Blue embarked upon their first U.S. tour alongside Taproot. They have since played with bands such as Staind, Alice in Chains, 10 Years, Three Days Grace, Flyleaf and former labelmates Breaking Benjamin.

On April 1, 2006, drummer Darryl Brown left due to differences with band-mates lifestyles. That night in Boston, drummer Danny D (formerly of the band Dogfight) was temporarily brought in. The band played acoustic sets until he was up to speed, and he continued through the rest of the tour, which lasted until late October.

The Pursuit... and member changes (2007–2009)

After an eight-month stint touring around the United States, Evans Blue returned home and began work upon their second album, The Pursuit Begins When This Portrayal of Life Ends. Danny D left the band and was replaced by Howard Davis.

In March 2007, Evans Blue was nominated for "Best New Band" at the annual Juno Awards.

The first single from their second album, The Pursuit, hit airwaves May 21, 2007 and was accompanied by a music video, directed by Jesse Ewles. The Pursuit Begins When This Portrayal of Life Ends was released on July 24, 2007. The bands' website was given an overhaul to portray the sounds, images and themes of the new album. In March 2007, Evans Blue recorded acoustic versions of each song from The Melody to be released on . For a limited time, this was included with each purchase of The Pursuit from Best Buy, and contains commentary from lead singer, Matisyn, as well as a making-of documentary for the second album. The FYE version of the album did not include the Unplugged Melody, but instead had two additional tracks.

On July 10, 2007, Evans Blue kicked off their first head-lining tour, Curbside Confession of a Catastrophe, in Toronto. The rest of the tour stopped across the western United States, with occasional performances in Vancouver, British Columbia. They were accompanied by Framing Hanley, Fair to Midland, and Submersed throughout the summer 2007 tour, which spanned through September. After a one-month break, the tour kicked off again October 27, 2007. Framing Hanley rejoined the band for the tour, with the additions of Saving Abel and Canadian rockers Neurosonic. This tour ended on December 31 in Houston, Texas, where they introduced a new song, "Good Enough," which would have been released on the upcoming third album. However, since Kevin Matisyn was voted out of the band, the song "Good Enough" has been scrapped.

On July 28, 2008 Kevin Matisyn posted on his MySpace page that he is "formerly of Evans Blue." This was confirmed by Evans Blue on their MySpace page. Parker Lauzon of the band stated in a bulletin that "We did not choose anyone over him; he was simply voted out, not only because of musical differences but business differences as well. He simply was not making good decisions for this band anymore, and we as a group have decided to move on."

Since 2009, Kevin Matisyn has started a new band named Parabelle which has released several albums.

Evans Blue stopped in LA mid-tour to shoot the video for "Erase My Scars" with Director Adrian Picardi and Producer Eric Ro of Northern Five Entertainment. The video is dedicated to Dan Chandler's nephew Chase Franklin, who died of a rare brain cancer at the age of 8; the Keeping Chase Foundation (www.keepingchase.com) has been established in his name.

Current drummer, Mike McClure will make his debut on the new Dan Korneff mix of the first single "This Time It's Different," which became available on November 22, 2011.
