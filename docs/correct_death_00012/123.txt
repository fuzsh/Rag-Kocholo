You lose. He also dies in "The Sands of Iwo Jima" and "The Alamo".

I must confess I was pretty surprised the first time I saw TSOIJ when he bought

it. It was probably the one of the first WWII movies to have the principle

star get killed.

Wasn't there another movie where John Wayne died? I seem to remember

a movie with Kim Darby and Glen Campbell (the country singer) where

John played a salty old cowboy who died in the end. Anyone remember

this film or the year it was made?

Yeah, but Wayne doesn't die in the end of this one. Who could forget:

"Come see a fat old man sometime!"

[Wonderful theme music as Wayne rides horse over field and jumps fence, thus

designating his horse as a) a stunt-horse and b) pretty damn strong -- any

animal that could get that amount of weight over anything taller than a

discarded ice cream cone is in great shape.]

**SPOILER WARNING**

You are thinking of True Grit. No, Wayne did not die in

this one. Glen Campbell does, though (Yay!). The last

scene has Kim Darby, now nearly better after the snake bite,

showing Wayne the family grave plot, and inviting Wayne to

share it when he dies. Actually it is unfortunate that

Wayne didn't die in True Grit, because then they would not

have made the appalling sequel "Rooster Cogburn" with

Katherine Hepburn doing her embittered spinster for the

three zillionth time.

Well, pilgrim, he may not have died *in* it, but he probably died *from* it...

_The Conqueror_ was filmed in the desert near the atomic test site in

Nevada (they may have shot in California, but fallout knows no boundaries).

All of the actors and stuntmen rolled around in the dirt for a number of

weeks, inhaling it, swallowing it, and getting it rubbed into their skin.

In the intervening years, most of the people involved have died from

various forms of cancer- in numbers way higher than average, and many

of them died pretty young...

The Duke died from cancer, too, but he smoked, so radiation probably

didn't do the whole job. But it probably helped...

The ironic thing is, he may have... a lot of that 1956 movie,

"The Conqueror," was filmed in the Nevada desert in areas very

close to a lot of fission and fusion nuclear test sites,

government-certified "safe" areas which were later discovered to

have dangerously high radiation levels. A disproportionate

amount of the people who worked on that movie contracted cancer

in later life, and the Duke himself, of course, eventually died

of lung cancer. (Of course, he also smoked a lot for most of his

life, so there certainly isn't any iron-clad cause/effect

connection between "The Conqueror" and his death.)

_The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance_

the whole movie centers around the Senator's returning to that town

for John Wayne's funeral. JW had even tried to commit suicide

earlier in the movie.

hag...@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu (Paul Hager) writes about John Wayne's

death from cancer (in 1979), and links it to the filming of "The

Conqueror" in the Nevada desert near nuclear testing sites.

Susan Hayward and Agnes Moorehead were also in the movie, and they

both died of cancer, circa 1974.

I believe "a few" other people connected with the filming of the

movie also succumbed to cancer.

By the way, the movie was a real bomb ...
