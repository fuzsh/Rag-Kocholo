        "text": "John Wayne Collier, 68, of Wooster, died Friday, May 10, 2024, at his residence.\n\nHe was born July 13, 1955, in Elyria, Ohio to the late James and Lillian {Cooley} Collier.\n\nJohn enjoyed attending First Presbyterian Church in Wooster and formerly attended Disciples of Christ Church in Elyria.\n\nHe previously lived in the South Amherst R.E.M. Group Home community for 30 years. He then moved to the Wooster Outreach Community Living Services where he resided for 7 years.\n\nJohn looked forward to his day program at The Shack where he did numerous activities. He loved celebrating holidays and being able to spend those times with his family.\n\nThroughout his life, John had a special gift for sensing things that others may not have noticed.\n\nHis calm and patient demeanor was seen mostly with animals, especially dogs and horses. He always enjoyed taking care of his sister’s horse, Queen, feeding her and sometimes even attempting to go for a ride.\n\nOne thing was for certain, John never went anywhere without his headset playing his favorite music or his paper bag including his favorite items.\n\nJohn will be deeply missed by his sisters Shannon Lee (LeRoy) Foster, Nancy Jeanne Collier (Allen Stacy) all of Wooster; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nIn addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his brother, Thomas Paul Collier.\n\nA memorial service will be held at First Presbyterian Church of Wooster in Bruch Hall on Friday, May 24, 2024, at 3 p.m.\n\nBurial will be done privately at the Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery. Online tributes may be made at www.RobertsFuneralHome.com. Roberts Funeral Home – Sherwood Chapel, Wooster is assisting with arrangements. Memorial contributions may be made to the Wayne County Dog Shelter, 5694 Burbank Rd., Wooster, OH 44691."
