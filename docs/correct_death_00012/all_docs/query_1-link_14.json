        "text": "1907-1979\n\nPacific View Memorial Park, Newport Beach\n\nThe iconic actor with the cowboy swagger and gravel in his voice was born Marion Morrison and nicknamed “Duke” because that was his dog’s name. But he built his tough-as-leather image around a stage name: John Wayne.\n\nWayne turned to film when a knee injury ended his plans to play football for USC. He starred in more than 175 movies in a career that spanned five decades – chasing down bad guys, barking out battle orders and riding off into the sunset.\n\nHe was nominated three times for the Academy Award, and won for best actor for his performance in “True Grit” (1969). He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the nation’s highest civilian honor – in 1980.\n\nWayne also was known for his conservative politics. Borrowing a catch phrase he made famous, one conservative Web site even claims to speak with a voice that “sounds a lot like John Wayne … pilgrim.”\n\nWayne died at age 72 in 1979, after a long fight with cancer. He was buried at first in an unmarked grave overlooking the ocean at Pacific View Memorial Park. His grave has since been given a bronze plaque with a quote from Wayne that begins, “Tomorrow is the most important thing in life….”"
