        "text": "A 1979 oil painting of actor John Wayne, among the many items going up for sale at an auction of the late Hollywood star's memorabilia. Current Bid: $375.\n\nJohn Wayne Enterprises appointed Heritage Auctions to conduct the first ever single-owner auction from the actor's personal archive, with more than 700 costumes, scripts, personal documents and awards never before available.\n\nPublic exhibitions of the John Wayne collection will be held in New York, Sept. 23-25, 2011, and in Los Angeles Oct. 3-5. The auction will take place at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles and online, Oct. 6-7, 2011.\n\nA Stetson Cowboy Hat worn by John Wayne in the film \"Hondo\" (1953), made of beige felt, with a black cord and bronze-colored \"acorn\" hatband. Opening Bid: $25,000. There are many hats in the collection, from a beret (\"The Green Berets\") to a cavalry hat (\"The Horse Soldiers\").\n\nOne lot of 11 movie posters includes advertisements for Wayne's blockbusters as well as some of his lesser-known films. Opening Bid: $3,000.\n\nHow many times did Wayne play a lawman who turns in his badge? Well, here are eight of 'em, dating from the 1960s-70s. Current Bid: $2,200.\n\nA signed limited edition print from Andy Warhol's \"Cowboys and Indians\" Series, 1986. Produced several years after Wayne's death, Warhol used a publicity still from \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" without permission. To resolve the matter, the Warhol Foundation gifted this and other prints to Wayne's family. Estimate: $20,000 - $25,000.\n\nOne of many eye patches worn by Wayne playing Rooster Cogburn in \"True Grit\" (1969), for which he won an Oscar for Best Actor. Made of black leather with fine wire mesh covering a cut-out hole. There is makeup residue still evident. Current bid: $6,000.\n\nA Western saddle and stand from the 1960s. Opening Bid: $40,000.\n\nA 14K Gold monogrammed belt buckle from the 1950s. Opening Bid: $2,000.\n\nThis ceramic coffee mug emblazoned with an image of Wayne as his character in \"The Shootist\" - his last film - was gifted by Wayne to a Rick Lenz, but it was \"returned to sender, address unknown.\" Still in the original shipping box, the mug meant for Mr. Lenz can now be yours. Current Bid: $700.\n\nMany of Wayne's annotated scripts are up for sale, including what many believe is his best film: John Ford's \"The Searchers.\" Opening Bid: $8,000.\n\nAlso among the personal memorabilia is this 1961 photo of Wayne with Sammy Davis Jr. Current Bid: $700.\n\nWayne's political inclinations were well known, especially during the Vietnam War. Going up for auction are five letters signed or initialed by President Richard Nixon thanking Wayne for his support.\n\nIn one letter Nixon writes, \"Word has reached me of your spirited words of support during your visit to Athens. It looks like we get better press abroad than we do here -- many thanks for your forthright comments!\"\n\nCurrent Bid: $1,000.\n\nClassics bestow even greater iconic status, and a higher starting price. For the Stetson hat worn by Wayne in \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,\" the opening bid is $30,000.\n\nWhile Wayne is best remembered for his westerns and war films, he also appeared in costume dramas. At left is a tailcoat from \"Lady for a Night\" (1942), in which Wayne played a gambler on a riverboat opposite Joan Blondell. Opening Bid: $500.\n\nThere are many awards and trophies in the Wayne collection going up for sale (though not his Best Actor Academy Award for \"True Grit\" - the sale of Oscar statuettes is restricted). One of Wayne's proudest achievements was his 1960 film \"The Alamo,\" which he directed. At left is his Academy Award certificate for the film's Best Picture nomination, which he received as its producer. Current Bid: $2,000.\n\nIf you were a cop who pulled over John Wayne in 1977, this is what you'd see: His California driver's license. Current Bid: $5,200. Also up for sale: A slew of the Duke's credit cards.\n\nAmong the correspondence is this facetious form letter from the hosts of \"Laugh-In,\" Dan Rowan and Dick Martin, dated August 15, 1973:\n\n\"To Our Very Best Pal [John Wayne] (Or Occupant):\n\n\"When Dick said to me \"Say Dan, we should have ______________ in our Hollywood Boys Glee Club\", I could have agreed more. I said \"I couldn't agree more, Dick, because I have considered ______ a marvelous performer ever since he (her) wonderful performance(s) in [\"Singing Cowboy\"], [\"Donovan's Reef\"] and [\"Boys in the Band\"]. (Note to secretary: If he (she) hasn't done anything lately, send version B on the cheap stationery.)\n\n\"Anyway, ______, it was great having you with us on _______, 19__. We enjoyed your singing, acting, dancing. Thanks again and regards to your wife, husband or whatever.\"\n\nThe opening bid for this bronze sculpture by Gallagher Rule dating from 1979 is $3,000.\n\nA 1945 oil painting of the Duke by John Decker. Current Bid: $5,000."
