During this difficult period, he became passionate about helping others fight this terrible disease.\n\nTo honor his memory, his family created the John Wayne Cancer Foundation in 1985. The mission of the John Wayne Cancer Foundation is to lead the fight against cancer with courage, strength and grit. John Wayne Cancer Foundation funds novel and innovative programs that improve cancer patients' outcomes and save lives through research, education, awareness and support."
