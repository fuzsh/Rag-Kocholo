        "text": "Just a short stretch south from Los Angeles, Orange County/Santa Ana affords travelers a convenient entry point and a chance to strike gold in the Golden State. Visitors get to choose from and enjoy a wealth of options, from the Spanish tile rooftops of Santa Ana to the striking skyscrapers of downtown L.A., the scenic beaches and byways of the Orange County coast to the bustling cities that stretch all the way eastward through the Inland Empire. And it is all within reach after a flight into John Wayne Airport Orange County.\n\nBeach bums will find more than their fair share of places where they can dig their toes in the sand and take in some rays. Adventuresome types can catch some waves—while the rest enjoy the free entertainment—at well-known surfing venues like Huntington Beach, known to many as Surf City, USA. No board? No problem. Head southward to The Wedge at Newport Beach, a popular body surfing spot. And if you are simply looking to enjoy the sights and sounds of the sea, you can find a quiet plot to spread your blanket and pitch your parasol along Orange County’s 40 miles of picturesque coastline.\n\nOf course, a flight into Orange County/Santa Ana also offers visitors easy access to the City of Angels. Head into the city for a stay, where you can enjoy all that the city’s population of three million-plus proudly offers. Get lost in halls of the largest art museum in the Western U.S., the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Head just around the corner to find fascinating history lessons and all-ages fun at the La Brea Tar Pits, which doubles as a site for ongoing excavation and visitation, and where curious travelers can see preserved plants and animals of the Ice Age. Meanwhile, no matter where you travel through Los Angeles, know that you’ll find gastronomical temptations around virtually every corner. Choose to savor time-tested classics from Little Tokyo or test out the latest takes on California cuisine. Either way, you’ll find more than enough good eating to fill your stomach and your schedule while you are in Los Angeles."
