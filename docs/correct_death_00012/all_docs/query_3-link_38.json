The last\n\nscene has Kim Darby, now nearly better after the snake bite,\n\nshowing Wayne the family grave plot, and inviting Wayne to\n\nshare it when he dies. Actually it is unfortunate that\n\nWayne didn't die in True Grit, because then they would not\n\nhave made the appalling sequel \"Rooster Cogburn\" with\n\nKatherine Hepburn doing her embittered spinster for the\n\nthree zillionth time.\n\njoan\n\n\"My lawyer will make money, and your lawyer will make money,\n\nand I will make money, and you will pay.\"\n\n- Kim Darby, True Grit.\n\n--\n\n\"Nothing is good or bad, Joan McGalliard,\n\nbut thinking makes it so.\" Latrobe University,\n\nDepartment of Computer Science.\n\n- Hamlet Melbourne, Australia.\n\nIn article <865.26...@desire.wright.edu>, sbi...@desire.wright.edu writes:\n\n>\n\n>> In article <58...@tekred.CNA.TEK.COM> mi...@freddy.CNA.TEK.COM (Quigley) writes:\n\n>>>\n\n>>> A friend and I have a bet.
