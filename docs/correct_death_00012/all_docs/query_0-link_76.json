        "text": "Crew was helpful and respectful. Pilot could have landed a little smoother. Overall delightful experience.\n\nLove flying out of Paine field! Easy check-in, great lunch, small crowd. Donâ€™t let this go away!\n\nI am extremely dissapointed with Alaska Airlines. I had two minors traveling along, I used the unaccompanied minor program to escort my kids and bring them to mom on the other side of the flight. Unfortunately they just left them at the gate on the other side and did not bring them to mom. The person working for the airline flat out just told the kids they were not going to bring them to mom and just left them sitting there at the gate!!! These are two kids traveling alone. This is horrible and security should have been called\n\nFlight was excellent , crew were very helpful and kind. No entertainment was needed as it was an overnight flight. Keep up the great work. Thank you ðŸ˜Š\n\nI APPRECIATED THAT THEY CALLED ME TO LET ME KNOW THAT I NEEDED TO BOARD ASAP AS I THOUGHT I STILL HAD AFEW MINUTES LEFT TO FINISH MY BLOODY MARY.\n\nMore transparency about the fact that the aircraft is a Boeing 737-max. The flight was fine and the plane is comfortable but giving all the issues that aircraft has had, there needs to be more transparency that Alaska is using it.\n\nGreat airline. Had no problems and minor delay due to weather. Staff was friendly. Would definitely fly them again.\n\nThey had all the passengers running around the airport as they kept changing the gate (from B7 to C1 to B16). Then they were saying the flight would be delayed and then they immediately boarded it, almost standing passengers who'd wandered off thinking it was delayed.\n\nWas on a red eye departed at 9pm and arrived at 5 am...we were all asleep before snacks and drinks. We were happy we got on seated and comfortable. We arrive sleepy safe and sound. That's a win! Thank you Alaska Airlines and staff!\n\nThis is where things were a bit upsetting first the wheelchair assistance person not only was playing games at first leaving us to wonder. When I did get another person to help she took me to the gate the Alaska Airlines person Alex was rude. I didn't have a seat assigned which was not helping my travel anxiety, he honestly didn't seem to care when he step away I came to another agent named John who was very empathetic and kind. He looked in his computer and gave me a seat realizing my situation.\n\nThey charge you for everything. Even water. They accepted my dog as a service dog in my reservation. Then they asked for a DOT form that was impossible to provide. I had to pay $175 for my service to fly with me, that would protect me from death if I ate peanuts. They did not however, serve peanuts on the plane.\n\nTraveling on Spirit Airlines was awful. It was by far the worst airline we ever traveled on. There is no food service at all unless you paid for it. Even a cuppa coffee or a water was $5 . Iâ€™ve never been in a seat so close to the one in front of me. There was literally 10-12 inches from my face to the seat back in front of me. We actually all had to laugh at the size of the tray table. Never see a tray table so small, and I donâ€™t even see the point of it. By booking through Spirit, but after I paid for checked luggage, water, coffee, I wouldâ€™ve been better off going with our usual airline where everything was included. It actually wouldâ€™ve been cheaper and way more comfortable. We joked that we were actually surprised they didnâ€™t give us tokens just to use the bathroom. My daughter even knows she would never travel on Spirit again, and sheâ€™s not high maintenance at all. Aweful\n\nFlight kept being delayed on airport board without any announcement. We were delayed almost 2 hours. Finally boarded and we had no pilots so we sat on a hot plane with screaming kids and no pilots for 40 minutes. Finally he came aboard and did paperwork for 10 minutes before we took off. No apologies or any explanations or even excuses from ANY staff in the entire process. Worst experience ever on the ground and the air I have had.\n\nDelays delays and more delays in both LAX and San Jose. And then I said something else flight was supposed to arrive in Portland at 12:04 but didn't land until 2:30 PM which made me late for my appointment.\n\nMy flight was uncomfortable and crammed. There were no pockets to store things, I couldnâ€™t move my seat back slightly. Beverages including soda cost extra. My husband flew on another spirit airline flight, which was delayed a total of 48 hours, only to be canceled.\n\nHorrible, first flight delayed. They switched my connecting flight while I was en route and even though I was originally supposed to be on the flight going back home to boston, refused to let me board and told me I would have to wait for next flight that was 14 hours later. Ended up renting a car and driving 6.5 hours back home. Still getting messages about flight and it is now showing that the other flight they put me on is now canceled and I would have to wait 24 hours for the next one. I will never book with spirit again\n\nOverall it was a miserable experience... I will never fly spirit for more than a 3 hour flight or overnight.\n\nOne hour late taking off. Concerning, very hard landing. Uncomfortable seats with no recline. Extremely slow baggage claim. Very professional, knowledgeable flight attendants. Brand new, very clean plane.\n\nCanâ€™t say there was anything I particularly liked. Seats were very tight, leather wrapped plastic. I followed up a much longer and cheaper trip from Honolulu on southwest, everything was phenomenal, this flight was the exact opposite. Blows my mind they charge for water of all things. One of the attendants seemed very rude, I watched a taller gentleman a couple rows forward with his knees pressed into the back of the seat ahead, while the woman in that seat leaned forward the entire flight, Iâ€™m sure because she could feel his knees. Iâ€™ll be avoiding spirit like the plague from here forward."
