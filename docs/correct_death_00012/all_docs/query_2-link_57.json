        "text": "A ‘Celebration of Life’ service for John Wayne Schnell, 68, of Glen Burnie, Maryland will be 12:00 pm, July 1, 2024 at Stevenson Funeral Home’s Fellowship Room in Dickinson. Burial will take place in St. Patrick’s cemetery.\n\nJohn passed away in his home on February 12, 2024. He was born in Dickinson North Dakota on January 10, 1956, the son of Willard and Swana Schnell. He had four older siblings at that time and would be joined by two more. The family moved to Miles City, Montana in 1959, where John attended Sacred Heart Elementary School. In 1966, the family returned to Dickinson and he attended St. Patrick’s Elementary School and later Dickinson High School and Dickinson State University. John was an avid sports enthusiast, especially enjoying basketball, softball and golf, eventually becoming a coaching assistant for basketball teams at DSU and Belfield High School.\n\nJohn was part of an Angus cattle operation while also working at Stockman’s Livestock Auction in Dickinson. His love for dogs enticed him to raise and train blue heeler pups and with his God-given patience and persistence, he did an amazing job! At weeks end, you could find John at his favorite establishment for trivia night with friends and family. He was definitely an asset in music trivia. In 2007, John moved to Vienna, Virginia to help with his uncle’s business. Years later he took employment at Dick’s Sporting Goods in Maryland as the Golf Department Manager. As a follower of all things basketball, John became an enthusiastic Carolina Tar Heels fan… loved the games and highly revered their coach, Dean Smith. He regularly attended games with his younger brother and good friends.\n\nJohn Schnell was preceded in death by his parents, Willard and Swana Schnell; brothers-in-law, Wes Tibbetts and Richard Dafnis.\n\nHe is survived by six siblings: Judy (Bud) Pauley of Dickinson, Sidney (Gae) Culver of Dickinson, Sonya (Mike) Metzger of Peoria, AZ, Larry (Judi) Schnell of Dickinson, Susan Dafnis of Sun City, AZ, Collin (Michelle) Schnell of Pasadena, MD; step-mother, Linda Schnell; step-sister, Julie (Chris) Elliott; and numerous nieces and nephews."
