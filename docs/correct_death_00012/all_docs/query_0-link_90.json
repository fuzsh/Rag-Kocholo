        "text": "Imagine galloping across a 2,000-acre ranch in the far reaches of the Inland Empire on the trail of the Duke. The cost: $12 million.\n\nThe vast spread once owned by actor John Wayne is called Rancho Pavoreal. It’s listed at 43000 Stanley Road in Sage, south of Hemet, for $6,000 an acre, the Riverside Press-Enterprise reported.\n\nThe ranch includes a three-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot stucco ranch house, plus a three-car garage. To put it another way, the 1950 ranch house property will cost $4,000 per square foot.\n\n“John Wayne’s presence still lives on in Rancho Pavoreal’s very masculine and Western aesthetic,” listing agent Tatiana Novick of Coldwell Banker Realty told the Press-Enterprise.\n\nThe Hollywood legend known as The Duke and a partner owned the ranch from 1938 to 1948, when it was sold, according to a 1993 California Department of Forestry archeological report.\n\nRealtor.com reported in 2000 that Wayne owned it in the 1970s, adding “he frequently invited guests out for horseback riding, shooting and other ranching activities.”\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nThe ranch, whose name translates to Peacock Ranch, is 20 minutes east of the wineries in Temecula, and includes a barn and three wells.\n\nRiding trails pass through sagebrush and cholla cactus and across fenced and cross-fenced land for horses and cattle, through a valley floor punctuated by outcrops, a creek and Native American artifacts, with views of rolling hills and Palomar Mountain.\n\n“A perfect multi-purpose ranch, Rancho Pavoreal can be used for camps, hunting, horseback riding, cattle grazing, riflery, archery, hiking, equestrian use, a motorcycle ranch — you name it, it has it,” Novick said of the listing.\n\nRead more\n\nResidential\n\nNew York\n\nHead west: America’s wealthy want ranches\n\nCommercial\n\nTexas\n\nYee-haw!

In 2021, it listed for $10 million, but didn’t sell.\n\nWayne appeared in nearly 250 films and became a household name when director John Ford cast him in “Stagecoach” in 1939, according to IMDb. In 1970, he won an Oscar for his starring role in “True Grit.” He died in 1979 at 72."
