        "text": "Cowboy superstar John Wayne died after battling stomach cancer almost 45 years ago.\n\nThe actor had been diagnosed with the disease just five months before his death. Fans were devastated when John died and it didn't take long for some people to come up with some bizarre theories about his death.\n\nSome reports suggested John's cancer was related to his carnivore diet and one rumor suggested an autopsy found 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter in the actor's system, which many believed came from red meat. Here, we've taken a look at all of the theories surrounding The Duke's death.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go toThe Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Wendy Williams' feet cause troubled star to break down in tears as there's 'no cure'\n\n40 pounds of fecal matter\n\nIn 1999, rumours started circulating on early internet forums that pounds of impacted fecal matter had been found in John's system. Fact check site Snapes quotes one user as writing: \"By the way, when they did an autopsy on John Wayne (Mr. Macho himself) 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter was removed from his death inducing cancerous colon.\"\n\n\"That's because Humans are not evolved for Animal eating. Animal fats lodge in the folds and pockets of our intestines. Carnivores have smooth intestinal linings and do not have these problems.\"\n\nJournalist Cathy Hainer made the same claims in an article published in USA Today. However, no evidence has been found to support the theory.\n\nRadiation exposure\n\nSmoking was believed to have had an impact on John's likelihood of developing cancer. According to The New York Times, The Duke smoked up to five packets of cigarettes a day, or 100 cigarettes in total. He then had lung cancer treatment in 1964 and had most of his left lung removed.\n\nAnother unproven theory claims the actor had an elevated risk of cancer as a result of radiation exposure. John had starred in the 1954 movie The Conqueror, which was filmed in the desert in Utah.\n\nAt the same time, the United States Atomic Energy Commission detonated more than 100 nuclear bombs as part of the Manhattan Project. This turned large parts of the desert into dangerous zone of radioactive fallout.\n\nA year after John's death, People magazine issued a report highlighting the high cancer rates among the film's cast and crew members. By 1980, 91 out of 220 people had been diagnosed with cancer while 46 had died.\n\nStomach removal\n\nJohn Wayne did have his stomach removed, however, it wasn't done during the actor's autopsy. In January 1979, just months before his death, surgeons removed the actor's stomach in a nine-hour operation after a malignancy was found while he was undergoing a routine gall bladder procedure.\n\nAt the time, the administrator of the hospital, Bernard Strohm, released a statement which said: \"During the removal of John Wayne's gall stones and gall bladder, an unusual type of lowgrade malignant tumor of the stomach was discovered and which required a more extensive operation for its complete removal. Mr. Wayne tolerated the procedure well and the tumor was completely removed. His current condition is satisfactory.\"\n\n\"His prognosis is excellent.\" He added: \"There are many many people in this world without stomachs who indeed function very well.\"\n\nHeavy drinking\n\nJohn was known for his heavy drinking. Sam O'Steen claimed in his 2001 book Cut to the Chase that studio directors had to shoot scenes with John before noon because he would become a \"mean drunk\" after an afternoon drinking session.\n\nThe actor's drinking was also discussed by his son, Ethan. He said the pair would go sailing in a yacht and claimed when they pulled up to an iceberg, John would chip some off for his drink.\n\n\"He always went for bourbon over generic whiskey. If he wanted a drink it was bourbon or tequila,\" he told the Daily Beast in 2018."
