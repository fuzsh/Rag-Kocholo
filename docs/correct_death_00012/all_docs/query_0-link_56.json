        "text": "The Los Angeles Police Department was in pursuit of a possible reckless driver who led them into Orange County before finally arresting the suspects late Friday evening.\n\nThe suspect led police from South LA to Orange County, using the 91 Freeway before exiting onto surface streets.\n\nThe driver wove through streets until reaching the I-405 Freeway near Los Alamitos. Once on the freeway, the suspect hit well above 100 mph.\n\nThe pursuit continued on surface streets near John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana. The suspect drove recklessly through multiple red lights.\n\nOfficers eventually caught up to the driver while the car entered the parkway leading to John Wayne Airport and then into the parking structure.\n\nOnce inside, the driver attempted to run into the airport on foot before being taken into custody. Some reports from the scene indicated that a second person had also been taken into custody as well."
