        "text": "A plan to add “Orange County” to the name of John Wayne Airport, part of an effort to cash in on the region’s pop-culture prestige, has incensed one of the late actor’s sons, who says officials are going to sully an icon in hopes of profiting off a “glut of moronic shows” on television.\n\nLocal tourism officials broached the idea late last year, saying that rechristening the aviation hub as John Wayne-Orange County Airport would add cachet as well as clarity by listing a place, not just a movie star’s name.\n\nTentative support has since been offered by some county supervisors, but a big roadblock remains: Ethan Wayne, the celluloid cowboy’s youngest son and president of Wayne Enterprises.\n\n“It’s unfathomable to me that they would even consider doing this,” Wayne said, adding that his family shares his disapproval.\n\nGary Sherwin, president of Newport Beach’s visitors bureau and a leader of a nascent marketing effort to boost Orange County tourism, argued that “people are already calling it ‘Orange County Airport,’ ” so a formal name change is of little consequence.\n\nhttp://www.pollmonkey.com/s.asp?c=53719538&u=3371645697 DisplayVote45697();\n\n“We honor his legacy,” Sherwin said of the Oscar-winning actor, “but I think it doesn’t hurt him by … adding the place where (the airport) is located to his name.”\n\nWriting on a travel blog, Wayne lambasted the contention of tourism officials that John Wayne Airport confuses travelers because its name lacks a geographic reference.\n\nIt’s “funny that an airport named after one of the most-recognizable personalities in recent American history is being deemed ‘too confusing’ just as a glut of moronic shows lionizing Orange County and its residents pepper televisions in houses across the nation,” Wayne wrote.\n\n“Are people also confused when they fly to John F. Kennedy Airport?” he added in an e-mail. “Do they not know they are going to New York?”\n\nSupervisors support the concept, Sherwin said, so long as John Wayne’s name isn’t jettisoned. “I think they’re ready to pull the trigger pretty quickly here,” Sherwin said.\n\nThe aviation center was actually called Orange County Airport until supervisors renamed it following John Wayne’s death in 1979. Even now, it’s technically known as John Wayne Airport, Orange County, but the full moniker is almost never used.\n\nSupervisor John Moorlach said in an interview that he’s publicized the plan during recent speeches, and that the response has been warm. “I like the idea,” Moorlach said. “I’m not getting a lot of push-back.”\n\nA similar proposal was floated in 2004 by Supervisor Chris Norby, who suggested “The O.C. Airport, John Wayne Field,” in reference to Fox’s prime-time drama, “The O.C.”\n\nOutcry ensued in the form of dozens of phone calls and letters to Norby’s office and the Orange County Register, and the plan was quickly shelved.\n\n“It was a trial balloon that crashed and burned,” Norby said at the time. Asked about the new plan in December, Norby said he was willing to consider it.\n\nThough he’s been dead for almost 30 years, John Wayne remains a revered figure. His movies appear on cable networks on an almost-nightly basis, and an annual Harris Poll routinely finds that the star of “True Grit” and other films ranks among the nation’s top 10 favorite actors.\n\nThat he may have to share the limelight with the Orange County phenomenon – a product of such shows as “The Real Housewives of Orange County” – is a prospect that “stings,” Ethan Wayne said.\n\n“Here’s somebody who stood his whole life for something,” he said, “and now they want to name it after a fad.”"
