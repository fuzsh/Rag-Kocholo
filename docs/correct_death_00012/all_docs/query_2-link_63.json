        "text": "I met John Wayne when I was 16 years old. I actually was in the movie he was starring in and directing \"The Green Beret\". The movie was being filmed at Fort Benning in Columbus Georgia in 1967. I was on vaction in Phenix City Alabama and saw a newspaper announcement asking for extras to be in the movie. My friends and I boarded a bus and the next thing I knew we were almost eye to eye with John Wayne and David Janssen who was in the movie too. Anyway, I remember John Wayne had a machine gun in his hand and a helicopter was flying overhead trying to get a look at the production site and was interfering sound wise with the scene, Wayne bellowed out \"Get General Wright on the Phone, he said we would have peace and quiet over hear\" he pretended to be shooting at the Helicopter as well. I was actually in three scenes in the crowd. As indicated in the Celebrity Almanac I published in 2006, John wayne was born on May 26, 1907. Look under celebrity birth dates at www.celebrityalmanac.com. John Wayne was bigger than life!\n\nUnfortunately I never did meet the Duke but, I knew two people who had and their stories made me love the Duke even more. A grammer school girlfriend's father often played a Mexican bandit in movies and did so on one with John Wayne. There was a parade and John Wayne was the Grand Marshall. My friend could not wait to meet John as her father was very close to him. Well, she wound up ill with the mumps and could not go. She was very heart broken. Well, while home sick the day of the parade, she gets a knock at the door, her mother answers and says it is for her. John Wayne went out of his way to drive to her house and meet her in person. How great can that be! He was a person that did not let his fame blurr his heart.\n\nAnother friend was the Manager of the San Gabriel Auditorium. He knew the Duke and often went to his home to have a beer and look at movies in John's personal movie house. He told me that John was the most down-to-earth person he ever had the pleasure to know.\n\nI didn't read all comments but had to reply to the ones I felt didn't really believe in the man. The man was a man, but an actor as well. who had values, He taught the kids to live good, only fight when you had to and respect life even if his character was sometimes not so good. As far as him not being an actor just copying himself, I think that the actor/man had become one and that what he did off camera was the man off as well. No, he didn't shoot the bad guys, he stayed out of the limelight though, but his tender heart and feelings for others and the American citizens and wanting things good for all are was his way. His movies portrayed the same thing. I said this when my husband and I saw him in \"The Shootist\" I think we got the best of himself, almost a biography of his life, as John \"Duke\" Wayne AND John \"Duke\" Wayne the actor. That movie showed how even though he was a gunslinger and that he knew he was about to die that he still had the humanity and love of those he was trying to protect. His interaction between Ron Howard and Ron's onscreen mom. (I can see her but not her name), showed how he wanted them to have a good life and his job (a gunslinger) was not the job for Ron and told him to listen to his mother. He died later on in '79, his legacy will last forever. His \"True Grit\" was that, true grit and wanting to get the bad guy. He took Kim Darby under his wing, although very cautiously at first, but you could tell he was only putting up a fence to protect him from love. I must admit I saw this one and the remake of \"True Grit\" and Bridges brought his own Rooster Cogburn to the screen, keeping the man still the same, but putting his own twist on it, but I could remember the movie as if I had seen it in '69 with my then boyfriend and the remake in 200?, with him as my husband as well. We both loved it and him. His death made my father's death in '77 more real and that the last of his favorite male actors/singers/performers, mostly were now gone and yet would have the memories as well. Those memories from John Wayne have gotten me though some tough times over the years and say what you will, even if you didn't like him politically you have to respect the way he tried to keep his private life private and his behind the scenes out of view private as well. He was a distinguished gentleman, yet also a guy who would make you think you should run, but being a man you stayed around, which in the end was probably the WRONG thing to do. Read about his life, he was human and made human errors, but he was also a great American Hero to boys and girls alike."
