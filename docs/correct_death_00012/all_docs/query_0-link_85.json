        "text": "John Wayne’s onetime 2,000-acre ranch in Riverside County is for sale, and among the possible uses, the marketing pitch says, is a place to grow marijuana.\n\nOther scenarios posed include vineyards, horses, cattle, shooting, hunting, a private retreat or a sports camp. But one can’t overlook this suggestion: “possible cannabis cultivation.”\n\nRancho Pavoreal is located in Sage, a small agricultural community 10 minutes away from Temecula wine country, as real estate agent Tatiana Novick of Coldwell Banker, who represents the ranch, describes it in her listing.\n\n“A riot of mesas and meadows laced with gurgling streams. Miles of chaparral and clusters of stately oaks. A mountain that American Indian considered a deity. Herds of deer, golden eagles overhead, enough wildlife to stock a zoo,” she says of the setting on Facebook.\n\nThe seller of the ranch, listed in April, is seeking $8 million. The property went off the market and was relisted in November, according to the MLS.\n\nWayne died in 1979 at 72.\n\nRancho Pavoreal went on to offer getaways for tourists. A 1994 story in the Los Angeles Times described the dude ranch as a “Galloping Good Time.”\n\nThe Riverside County Board of Supervisors approved a regulatory framework for cannabis commerce two months ago. Proposition 64’s passage in 2016 made it legal in California for adults to use cannabis for recreation, but the law gives cities and counties the authority to regulate or ban most other marijuana activities within their borders.\n\nThe ranch appears to be located in a rural residential area, said Juan Perez, head of Riverside County’s Transportation and Land Management Agency. Marijuana cultivation is not currently allowed in that general area, he said, and any change likely would have to follow a zoning switch or other lengthy review process.\n\nCannabis entrepreneurs have said allowing marijuana in unincorporated areas of Riverside County would boost the local economy and help mom-and-pop ventures, like “bud and breakfast” inns. The law bans outdoor grows, however, and the nearby Temecula Valley Wine Country is off-limits to commercial marijuana ventures.\n\nThis story has been updated with Perez’s statements.\n\nDid you miss?\n\nFrank Sinatra’s desert hideaway has a ‘surreal’ setting – and a $4.5 million price tag"
