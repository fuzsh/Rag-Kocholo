        "text": "Howdy, pardner. My Nov. 29 column on the 70th anniversary of “Hondo” found an appreciative audience, which I, uh, appreciate.\n\nI wrote about the John Wayne movie and its Louis L’Amour novelization, both released Nov. 27, 1953, and how they both contain a bragging-rights moment for a certain community. Wayne’s character, Hondo Lane, says he owns a ranch in California “east of San Dimas.”\n\nA welcome amount of comment rolled in from “Hondo” admirers. We’ll get to those in a moment. First, an oversight from the column should be rectified.\n\nLate in the movie, there’s a second reference to San Dimas.\n\nI scribbled it down on my notepad while watching “Hondo” at home on a Friday night. Yet when I wrote the column the following Monday, my eye blipped right over that line in my notes. So much for my intention of writing the definitive San Dimas/”Hondo” column.\n\nWell, here’s the set-up. Hondo is part of a wagon train of U.S. cavalrymen escorting homesteaders to California from Apache territory in Arizona. Angie Lowe and her son, Johnny, are among them. Angie and Hondo plan to wed.\n\nAfter an Apache attack is repelled, seemingly for good, Hondo says: “We’re out of trouble if we get a move-on.”\n\n“Am I going to get to drive?” Johnny, 8, asks eagerly.\n\n(As this is 1874, this concerns piloting the lead wagon, not the family sedan.)\n\nHondo tells the boy encouragingly: “Before we get to San Dimas, you’ll be a top teamster, son.”\n\nJohnny swells with pride, as does anyone in proximity to San Dimas.\n\nHow did I realize I had overlooked this quote?\n\nI’m currently rereading my columns from 2008 for my next book. In the three-month batch that I read Sunday afternoon while killing time waiting for a friend, one was partly about “Hondo” — what were the odds? — and to my befuddlement, I had quoted that line.\n\nSo today I’m able to include it in my follow-up. I swear, half of what goes into these columns is dumb luck — accent on dumb.\n\nNow, on to your comments.\n\nBecause my focus was on the San Dimas reference and the genesis of the movie — which was inspired by a short story by L’Amour, who then wrote his novel based on the screenplay by James Edward Grant — I didn’t get into other aspects of the movie.\n\nNotably, “Hondo” was shot in 3D but played that way in relatively few theaters, according to Wikipedia, with most people having seen only the standard version.\n\nLarry Lear of West Covina, which is roughly south of San Dimas, swears he saw the 3D version in his hometown of Findlay, Ohio, at age 5.\n\n“This allowed for things to seemingly jump out at you from the screen,” Lear says. “As a young boy, I thrilled at the arrows and tomahawks that came flying at me. Those were the days!”\n\nEd Starr, who happens to be city manager of Montclair, which is roughly southeast of San Dimas, says “Hondo” is his favorite western. He saw it in 3D once on TV.\n\nIn the 1980s, the movie was re-released after decades of being hidden away, Starr says, and was shown on national TV in 3D. As TV Guide recommended, Starr went to 7-Eleven to buy the 3D glasses distributed for the event.\n\nOnly a few scenes were explicitly aimed at the 3D audience, such as Hondo and his horse jumping a ravine. Another was the knife fight between Hondo and one of the Apache warriors, when “it appeared as though the knife was coming from out of the screen toward the viewer,” Starr recalls.\n\n“Translated to television, however, the 3D effects during that 1980s showing were unexciting,” Starr admits. “On the big screen, the 3D effects were probably used more to provide a sense of grandeur and scale for the beautiful, on-location scenery in Mexico.”\n\nJoel Rothberg of L.A. saw “Hondo” upon release in the 1950s. “A poor man’s John Wayne, I ran around with my cap pistol all day, pretending to be him,” Rothberg, now 80, recalls. “‘Hondo’ was truly my favorite western, in both book and movie form.”\n\nMitch Lloyd of Corona says he enjoyed that column, just as he’s enjoyed “Hondo.” “I was a little surprised you didn’t mention anything about Hondo teaching Angie’s son how to swim in that crick,” Lloyd adds.\n\nHondo, hearing that Johnny can’t swim while the two are fishing from a river bank, immediately picks him up and tosses him into the water, to Angie’s alarm. Johnny sinks like a stone. Just kidding: He suddenly learns to paddle.\n\nPersonal admission: I never learned to swim, despite summertime lessons in the community pool as a lad. Don’t tell Hondo.\n\nTerry Dipple, a former mayor of San Dimas, naturally comments on the “east of San Dimas” line. “So the Duke’s ranch,” Dipple muses, “must have been in La Verne or Claremont.”\n\nIt’s hard to say, Terry — especially since it’s only fiction, and also because San Dimas didn’t even exist in 1874. But then, there’s that line, the one I’d forgotten, indicating they were indeed bound directly for San Dimas.\n\nSpeaking of which, the San Dimas Historical Society is aware of the dialogue. And the organization’s archivist, Susan Davis, speculates that San Dimas’ inclusion could well have been because Wayne was aware of the community.\n\nHis friend Victor Fleming, the director of such films as “Gone With the Wind” and “The Wizard of Oz” (perhaps you’ve heard of them?), “spent the early part of his childhood in San Dimas,” Davis tells me, and “used to bring Wayne out here to do some shooting” — as in hunting.\n\nDoes “Hondo” still come up in connection with San Dimas? “Not as much as ‘Bill and Ted,’” Davis says with a chuckle. “That’s our claim to fame, ‘Bill and Ted.’ “\n\nbrIEfly\n\nA reference in my Nov. 19 column about how the Los Angeles County Museum of Art may turn the L.A. County Fair’s art building into a satellite LACMA campus for the San Gabriel Valley caught the eye of reader Jeff Kraus. He asserts that another L.A. institution, the Museum of Contemporary Art, is likewise planning an expansion to the Inland Empire. “They have already completed the branding,” Kraus claims. “It’s going to be called MOCA Chino.”\n\nDavid Allen perks things up Friday, Sunday and Wednesday.
