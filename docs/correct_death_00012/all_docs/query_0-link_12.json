        "text": "This article originally appeared in the October 1977 issue of Architectural Digest.\n\nA large station wagon, far from new, is parked near the front entrance. The house in Newport Beach, California—though it occupies a splendid setting at the water's edge facing Balboa Is­land—is simple and unpretentious. There is nothing to suggest that this is the private world of a superstar, the home of an American legend.\n\nNevertheless, John Wayne has lived here for some fourteen years, ever since moving south from a five-acre ranch in Encino. He had long been familiar with Newport Beach, how­ ever, and he remembers the days when it was no more than a village.\n\n\"I'm glad I came down here to live fourteen years ago,\" he says. \"I sure as hell couldn't afford it now.\" The reference to current real estate prices in Orange County is appealingly direct. There is, in fact, nothing indirect about John Wayne at all—or about his house. Pretensions had better be left outside, somewhere along the Pacific Coast Highway.\n\n1 / 5\n\nNothing, however, is quite that simple, and Mr. Wayne's personality is no exception. He is a man far more complex, far more sophisticated and far more sensitive than his archetypal screen image might suggest. For ex­ample, his house means a great deal to him—its antiques, its decor, its comforts—and it is hardly a place to throw down the saddlebags and kick a bedroll into the corner.\n\nMr. Wayne's study, the largest room in the house, presents the clearest and most compelling image of the man himself. It is warm and generous and comfortable, most definitely a man's room. The paneling and the fireplace and the small collection of guns strengthen the feeling, and there are many fine examples of Western Amer­ican art—bronzes and prints and oils— as well as many American Indian ar­tifacts. A favorite collection of kachina dolls, for example, was begun long ago, in the days when John Wayne used to ride into Monument Valley in Arizona to make films. Everywhere in the study are the memorabilia of his remarkable career as an actor.\n\nThe walls around his massive desk contain innumerable photographs and plaques marking the notable events of that career. One wall in particular, rising above a shelf on which rests the Oscar he received for his performance in True Grit, is referred to by Mr. Wayne as the \"Fifty Years of Hard Work Wall.\" It is also a record of memories and friendships: pictures of his children; a faded photograph of himself with John Ford and Henry Fonda and Ward Bond, proudly dis­playing a sailfish caught near Cabo San Lucas in the early 1930s.\n\nThe memorabilia, the mementos, the awards, the trophies—all attest to the variety of places John Wayne has visited, whether making films on loca­tion or traveling for pleasure. And for more than thirty years now, in the course of these travels, he has been collecting furniture and art and objects of all kinds. The range of his acquisi­tions has been wide and, as he admits, somewhat haphazard.\n\nThere are porcelain jardinieres from Honolulu; marvelous figures from Bali, acquired just after World War II when the area was relatively unknown and largely undiscovered by tourists. There are antiques he found in Colo­rado Springs, furniture from Madrid, figurines from Kyoto and a good deal of impressive Alaskan art.\n\nWhen making a film on location, nothing gives Mr. Wayne more plea­sure than spending his free time browsing through whatever antiques shops are available. His curiosity leads him everywhere, and he has picked things up in many an unlikely place. There is a porcelain table with a ped­estal base, now on the terrace at New­port Beach, that he found in one of the poorest sections of Puerto Vallarta. While making a film in Fort Benning, Georgia, he came across a favorite Empire table. His interest in collecting is a compelling one, and it is his habit to take treasured prints or small an­tiques along with him on location.\n\n“You often have to stay for a couple of months in some horrible motel room,\" he explains. “Well, I like to put a few familiar things on the wall. I try to dress the place up a little, make it seem more like home.\"\n\nHe is, of course, happiest when back in his house at Newport Beach.\n\n\"Look,\" he says, \"I find things that appeal to me, and I try to blend them in here. I don't give a damn whether anyone else likes them or not. But I think I've done a pretty fair job.\"\n\nThere is no mock modesty involved in these words, but there is more than a hint of understatement. The words say a good deal about John Wayne. They evoke a particularly human im­age—the image of a man of gentleness and sensitivity, a man deeply inter­ested in his family and in his home. Perhaps in the last analysis this is a larger and more solid image of John Wayne than the familiar one seen on all the film screens of the world.\n\nRelated: See More Celebrity Homes in AD"
