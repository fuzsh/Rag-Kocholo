        "text": "Halloween is coming, but at the Museum of Death in Hollywood, it’s business as usual.\n\nAn intriguing, shocking, and occasionally fascinating alternative to the mazes, hayrides, and jack-o’-lanterns that dominate this time of year, it’s as much an art exhibit as it is a museum, and while it does dive into the dark side of humanity, you won’t find costumed actors hiding around the corner to give you a jump scare.\n\nIt recently re-opened in Hollywood, a sister museum in New Orleans having taken up owner JD Healy and Cathee Schulz’s time over the last few years, and visitors have been quick to return and see the latest items from their ever-expanding archive.\n\n“We’ve just put out letters from Richard Ramirez, Otis Toole, and John Wayne Gacy so people can read them,” says Healy, recalling that Schulz stopped corresponding when Night Stalker Ramirez asked for a picture of her feet.\n\nAfter the box office, the first exhibits you see are colored light boxes featuring pictures of the Elizabeth Short crime scene. Better known as The Black Dahlia, her brutal killing in 1947 is still arguably LA’s most famous, and the shots are stark and uncensored, as is everything here.\n\n“But we’re not about gore and titillating shock tactics,” Healy insists. “I could certainly make it that way, but our aim has always been to teach about death, and to show how society views death across different cultures and generations.”\n\nIn the Serial Killer Archives room, he points out the paintings and pictures murderers have sold to collectors from their prison cells, then notes associated books, comics, t-shirts, and other macabre souvenirs that were on sale in stores across America.\n\nThe museum grew out of Healy’s interest in how consumerism follows us from birth to death, and he states that death is a business.\n\n“So-called ‘life’ insurance is actually for when you die!” he laughs, adding how cigarettes, alcohol, soft drinks, and snacks use skull and skeleton designs, daring you to try them (like the recent “One Chip Challenge” tragedy in Massachusetts).\n\nAnother financial aspect of death is showcased in the Funeral Room.\n\nIt features eye-watering morticians’ instruments and instructional videos showing how to perform an embalming, but also promotional materials given out by funeral homes like matchbooks, fans, combs, pocket knives, nail files, kitchen implements, pens and more.\n\n“Death is a constant in life, and they wanted you to have their name and phone number close to hand,” he notes simply.\n\nOther sections look at suicide, executions, the Nuremberg trials and more, while a bunkbed and clothes from the Heaven’s Gate cult suicide in 1997 stops you in your tracks, especially since a video of some of the members happily discussing their soon-to-come elevation plays alongside.\n\nAlmost every inch of wall features something, whether it is newspaper headlines from notorious events, or coroner’s photos from Long Beach and Los Angeles in the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s, and a corridor of photos of car crash accidents (James Dean’s and Jayne Mansfield’s included) hang alongside safety posters, and follow a display of various colored body bags.\n\n“Lots of former cops, detectives, nurses and doctors come in, and often donate items,” Healy says. “They want us to show people what really happens. And then every day we get calls, emails and packages from people who say: ‘you might think this is a bit weird, but …,’”\n\nPerhaps inevitably there is a room dedicated to Charles Manson that has one of his prison shirts and guitars, but the museum also has several exhibits that would not be out of place in more austere institutions: taxidermized creatures, carefully mounted spiders, bats and butterflies, skulls from across the world, Victorian mourning gifts, shrunken heads, bones of all kinds, and strange animals in jars.\n\nPerhaps the grandest item is a highly-detailed painting completed over 18 months by noted artist Joe Coleman, who uses a jeweler’s lens and a single-strand brush. Framed with coins, flint arrowheads, bullets and teeth, the subject at the center is Swift Runner, a Native American cannibal.\n\nThere is a Bible and a book bound in human skin here too, and it is perhaps no surprise that many visitors dismiss what they see as fake, or a well-made movie prop.\n\n“They’re not. Everything here is real,” Healy says, “because only humans are so cruel to other humans. People who are afraid of death are not living,” he says. “We should enjoy our lives while we can.”\n\nNot exactly the kind of spooky, orange-tinged message we expect in October, but The Museum of Death is not just for Halloween.\n\nMuseum of Death\n\nWhere: 6363 Selma Ave., Hollywood\n\nHours: 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Sundays through Fridays, 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Saturdays\n\nCost: $20\n\nInformation: 323-466-8011; museumofdeath.net"
