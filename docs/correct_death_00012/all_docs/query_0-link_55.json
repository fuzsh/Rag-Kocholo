She also is the founder of the complex general surgical oncology fellowship at UCI School of Medicine, the first of its kind within the University of California system. In her role as chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology, Senthil has received numerous awards for her commitment and dedication to educational excellence and has contributed to surgical research on a global scale.\n\nAmong her many accolades, Senthil was the recipient of the 2021 John E. Connolly, MD, Teaching Professor of the Year award. That same year, she published a study in the Journal of Surgery titled, “Promoting surgical research in the global south.” She also headed up an investigator-initiated clinical trial called STOPGAP – a Phase II study of sequential systemic and intraperitoneal chemotherapy for gastric peritoneal carcinomatosis, and was awarded the UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge Pilot Project Award. Additionally, Senthil is the Lancet Commission Global Cancer Surgery PAHO region champion.\n\nAnd now, she is the first Endowed Chair of John Wayne Cancer Foundation Surgical Oncology Fellowship Progam at UCI.\n\n“I am honored to hold the John Wayne Cancer Foundation Endowed Chair in Surgical Oncology,” Senthil said. “This partnership will help move the field forward and continue our ‘Discover. Teach. Heal.’ mission.” Dr. Senthil\n\n2nd Year Fellow\n\nDr. Amy Li\n\nDr Amy Li hails from Michigan, where she attended University of Michigan for her undergraduate studies, followed by Wayne State University School of Medicine for her medical degree. She completed three years of general surgery residency at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, MI before moving to California to complete two years of clinical hepatobiliary and pancreatic research under the mentorship of Dr Brendan Visser at Stanford University.\n\nShe finished the last two years of general surgery residency at Stanford University and has recently started her Complex General Surgical Oncology fellowship at the University of California Irvine. Her research interests include GI oncology and outcomes. Outside of the hospital, she enjoys hiking, traveling, and exploring restaurants.\n\n“It is my dream to pursue surgical oncology. I am so lucky for this opportunity to train at University of California Irvine through the John Wayne Cancer Foundation. I look forward to working with all the staff, residents, and surgical oncology department over the next two years!”\n\nNew Partnership between John Wayne Cancer Institute and UC Irvine\n\n2nd year Fellows will have the opportunity to rotate down to Orange County, and work alongside Dr. Pigazzi and faculty.\n\n\"UCI is delighted to partner with the John Wayne Cancer Institute on this important educational initiative,\" states Dr. Pigazzi, Chief of the Surgical Oncology Division and Program Director, UC Irvine Medical Center. \"As the only academic Medical Center in Orange County we are honored to be able to lend the expertise of our faculty to such a talented group of young surgeons.\"\n\nAndrew Conger, MD (Neurosurgery)\n\nFollowing a brief career as a high school science teacher, Dr. Conger completed his MD, general surgery internship, and neurosurgical residency at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans, LA.
