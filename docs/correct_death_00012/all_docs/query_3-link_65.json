        "text": "John Wayne, the famous cowboy actor, died in 1979 after fighting stomach cancer. He got sick and died just five months later.\n\nWhen John left the world, his fans were very sad and some started to say strange things about how he died, coming up with their own theories.\n\nThere was talk that John's love for meat might have made him sick. A wild story even said doctors found 40 pounds of waste inside him when he passed away, and some thought it was because he ate too much red meat.\n\nExpress.co.uk look into the different stories about how The Duke died.\n\nRead More: John Wayne’s kindness praised by co-star on set where cast member almost killed\n\n40 Pounds Of Waste\n\nBack in 1999, people on the internet began saying that doctors found lots of waste in John's body.\n\nA website that checks if stories are true mentioned someone saying: \"By the way when they did an autopsy on John Wayne (Mr. Macho himself) 40 pounds of impacted fecal matter was removed from his death inducing cancerous colon.\"\n\nThey added: \"That's because Humans are not evolved for Animal eating. Animal fats lodge in the folds and pockets of our intestines. Carnivores have smooth intestinal linings and do not have these problems.\"\n\nCathy Hainer, a journalist, made similar claims in an article for USA Today.\n\nHowever, no evidence has been found to back up this theory.\n\nRadiation Exposure\n\nJohn's smoking habit was thought to have increased his chances of getting cancer. The New York Times reported that The Duke smoked up to five packs of cigarettes a day, or 100 cigarettes in total.\n\nHe underwent treatment for lung cancer in 1964 and had most of his left lung removed.\n\nAnother theory, yet to be proven, suggests that John had a higher risk of cancer due to radiation exposure.\n\nHe starred in the 1954 film The Conqueror, which was shot in the Utah desert.\n\nDuring the same period, the United States Atomic Energy Commission set off over 100 nuclear bombs as part of the Manhattan Project. This turned large areas of the desert into a dangerous zone of radioactive fallout.\n\nA year after John's death, People magazine published a report highlighting the high rates of cancer among the cast and crew of the film. By 1980, 91 out of 220 people had been diagnosed with cancer, and 46 had died.\n\nDON'T MISS...\n\nBruce Dern still gets hate mail for what he did to John Wayne on The Cowboys [COMMENT]\n\nJohn Wayne publically condemned Kirk Douglas’ Spartacus as 'Marxist propaganda' [INSIGHT]\n\nJohn Wayne almost died on film combative co-star called ‘biggest piece of crap’ [INSIGHT]\n\nStomach Removal\n\nJohn had his stomach removed not during an autopsy but a few months before he passed away in January 1979.\n\nThis happened during a nine-hour surgery after doctors found a harmful growth while doing a regular gall bladder procedure.\n\nBernard Strohm, who was in charge of the hospital at that time, made a statement: \"During the removal of John Wayne's gall stones and gall bladder, an unusual type of lowgrade malignant tumour of the stomach was discovered and which required a more extensive operation for its complete removal.\n\nMr. Wayne tolerated the procedure well and the tumour was completely removed. His current condition is satisfactory.\"\n\n\"His prognosis is excellent.\" He also said: \"There are many many people in this world without stomachs who indeed function very well.\""
