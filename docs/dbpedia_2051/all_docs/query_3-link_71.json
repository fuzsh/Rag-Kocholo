METHODOLOGY This report focuses primarily on human rights abuses associated with the CIA’s post-September 11, 2001, secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations. The report does not document extra-legal overseas transfers or secret detention of detainees by agencies other than the CIA. Thus, the U.S. Defense Department’s detention practices and its transfer of detainees to and from Guantánamo Bay or other military detention facilities are not the focus of this report. The factual contents of this report are derived from credible public sources and information provided by reputable human rights organizations. Sources for the factual assertions are provided in accompanying endnotes. While every source has been carefully reviewed for indicia of credibility, it is ultimately impossible to corroborate every factual assertion due to the extraordinary level of government secrecy associated with secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations. GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY “ We also have to work, through, sort of the dark side, if you will. We’ve got to spend time in the shadows in the intelligence world. A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion, using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies, if we’re going to be successful. That’s the world these folks operate in, and so it’s going to be vital for us to use any means at our disposal, basically, to achieve our objective.” U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, September 16, 2001 1 Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) commenced a secret detention program under which suspected terrorists were held in CIA prisons, also known as “black sites,” outside the United States, where they were subjected to “enhanced interrogation techniques” that involved torture and other abuse. At about the same time, the CIA gained expansive authority to engage in “extraordinary rendition,” defined here as the transfer— without legal process—of a detainee to the custody of a foreign government for purposes of detention and interrogation.2 Both the secret detention program and the extraordinary rendition program were highly classified, conducted outside the United States, and designed to place detainee interrogations beyond the reach of the law. Torture was a hallmark of both. The two programs entailed the abduction and disappearance of detainees and their extra-legal transfer on secret flights to undisclosed locations around the world, followed by their incommunicado detention, interrogation, torture, and abuse. The administration of President George W. Bush embraced the “dark side,” a new paradigm for countering terrorism with little regard for the constraints of domestic and international law. Today, more than a decade after September 11, there is no doubt that highranking Bush administration officials bear responsibility for authorizing human rights violations associated with secret detention and extraordinary rendition, and the impunity that they have enjoyed to date remains a matter of significant concern. But responsibility for these violations does not end with the United States. Secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations, designed to be conducted outside the United States under cover of secrecy, could not have been implemented without the active participation of foreign governments. These governments too must be held accountable. However, to date, the full scale and scope of foreign government participation—as well as the number of victims—remains unknown, largely because of the extreme secrecy maintained by the United States and its partner governments. The U.S. E XE CUTIV E SU MMA RY 6 government has refused to publicly and meaningfully acknowledge its involvement in any particular case of extraordinary rendition or disclose the locations of secret overseas CIA detention facilities. While President Bush acknowledged that the CIA had secretly detained about 100 prisoners, the U.S. government has only identified 16 “high value detainees” as individuals who were secretly held in CIA detention prior to being transferred to U.S. Defense Department custody in Guantánamo Bay. The United States also has refused to disclose the identities of the foreign governments that participated in secret detention or extraordinary rendition, and few of these governments have admitted to their roles. This report provides for the first time the number of known victims of secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations and the number of governments that were complicit. Based on credible public sources and information provided by reputable human rights organizations, this report is the most comprehensive catalogue of the treatment of 136 individuals reportedly subjected to these operations. There may be many more such individuals, but the total number will remain unknown until the United States and its partners make this information publicly available. The report also shows that as many as 54 foreign governments reportedly participated in these operations in various ways, including by hosting CIA prisons on their territories; detaining, interrogating, torturing, and abusing individuals; assisting in the capture and transport of detainees; permitting the use of domestic airspace and airports for secret flights transporting detainees; providing intelligence leading to the secret detention and extraordinary rendition of individuals; and interrogating individuals who were secretly being held in the custody of other governments. Foreign governments also failed to protect detainees from secret detention and extraordinary rendition on their territories and to conduct effective investigations into agencies and officials who participated in these operations. The 54 governments identified in this report span the continents of Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America, and include: Afghanistan3, Albania, Algeria, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Finland, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong,4 Iceland, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Libya, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, Yemen, and Zimbabwe.5 By engaging in torture and other abuses associated with secret detention and extraordinary rendition, the U.S. government violated domestic and international law, thereby diminishing its moral standing and eroding support for its counterterrorism efforts worldwide as these abuses came to light. By enlisting the participation of dozens of foreign governments in these violations, the United States further undermined longstanding human rights protections enshrined in international law—including, in particular, the norm against torture. As this report shows, responsibility for this damage does not lie solely with the United States, but also with the numerous foreign governments without whose participation secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations could not have been carried out. By participating in these operations, these governments too violated domestic and international laws and further undermined the norm against torture. GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 7 Torture is not only illegal and immoral, but also ineffective for producing reliable intelligence. Indeed, numerous professional U.S. interrogators have confirmed that torture does not produce reliable intelligence, and that rapport-building techniques are far more effective at eliciting such intelligence. A telling example of the disastrous consequences of extraordinary rendition operations can be seen in the case of Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi, documented in this report. After being extraordinarily rendered by the United States to Egypt in 2002, al-Libi, under threat of torture at the hands of Egyptian officials, fabricated information relating to Iraq’s provision of chemical and biological weapons training to Al Qaeda. In 2003, then Secretary of State Colin Powell relied on this fabricated information in his speech to the United Nations that made the case for war against Iraq. In December 2012, the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted to approve a comprehensive report on CIA detention and interrogation. Although the report is classified, and was not publicly available at the time of this writing, the committee chairman, Senator Dianne Feinstein, stated that she and a majority of the committee believed that the creation of long-term, clandestine black sites and the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques were “terrible mistakes.” She added that the report would “settle the debate once and for all over whether our nation should ever employ coercive interrogation techniques such as those detailed in the report.” Despite the scale of torture and other human rights violations associated with secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations, the United States and most of its partner governments have failed to conduct effective investigations into secret detention and extraordinary rendition. The U.S. Justice Department’s investigation into detainee abuse was limited to ill-treatment that went beyond what its Office of Legal Counsel had previously authorized, and concluded without bringing any criminal charges, despite ample evidence of CIA torture and abuse. Italy is the only country where a court has criminally convicted officials for their involvement in extraordinary rendition operations. Canada is the only country to issue an apology to an extraordinary rendition victim, Maher Arar, who was extraordinarily rendered to, and tortured in, Syria. Only three countries in addition to Canada—Sweden, Australia, and the United Kingdom—have issued compensation to extraordinary rendition victims, the latter two in the context of confidential settlements that sought to avoid litigation relating to the associated human rights violations. Moreover, it appears that the Obama administration did not end extraordinary rendition, choosing to rely on anti-torture diplomatic assurances from recipient countries and post-transfer monitoring of detainee treatment. As demonstrated in the cases of Maher Arar, who was tortured in Syria, and Ahmed Agiza and Muhammed al-Zery, who were tortured in Egypt, diplomatic assurances and posttransfer monitoring are not effective safeguards against torture. Soon after taking office in 2009, President Obama did issue an executive order that disavowed torture, ordered the closure of secret CIA detention facilities, and established an interagency task force to review interrogation and transfer policies and issue recommendations on “the practices of transferring individuals to other nations.” But the executive order did not repudiate extraordinary rendition, and was crafted to preserve the CIA’s authority to detain terrorist suspects on a shortterm transitory basis prior to rendering them to another country for interrogation or trial. Moreover, the interagency task force report, which was issued in 2009, E XE CUTIV E SU MMA RY 8 continues to be withheld from the public. The administration also continues to withhold documents relating to CIA Office of Inspector General investigations into extraordinary rendition and secret detention. In addition, recent reports of secret detention by or with the involvement of the CIA or other U.S. agencies remain a source of significant concern. These include reports of a secret prison in Somalia run with CIA involvement, secret Defense Department detention facilities in Afghanistan where detainees were abused, and the twomonth long secret detention of a terrorist suspect aboard a U.S. Navy ship. Despite the efforts of the United States and its partner governments to withhold the truth about past and ongoing abuses, information relating to these abuses will continue to find its way into the public domain. At the same time, while U.S. courts have closed their doors to victims of secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations, legal challenges to foreign government participation in these operations are being heard in courts around the world. Maher Arar’s U.S. lawsuit was dismissed on grounds that judicial intervention was inappropriate in a case that raised sensitive national security and foreign policy questions. Similarly, U.S. courts dismissed on state secrets grounds Khaled El-Masri’s lawsuit challenging his abduction, torture, and secret detention by the CIA. In contrast, the European Court of Human Rights recently held that Macedonia’s participation in that operation violated El-Masri’s rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, and that his ill-treatment by the CIA amounted to torture. In addition, Italy’s highest court recently upheld the convictions of U.S. and Italian officials for their role in the extraordinary rendition of Abu Omar to Egypt. Moreover, at the time of this writing, other legal challenges to secret detention and extraordinary rendition are pending before the European Court of Human Rights against Poland, Lithuania, Romania, and Italy; against Djibouti before the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights; and against domestic authorities or officials in Egypt, Hong Kong, Italy, and the United Kingdom. In the face of this trend, the time has come for the United States and its partner governments to own up to their responsibility for secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations. If they do not seize this opportunity, chances are that the truth will emerge by other means to embarrass them. The taint of torture associated with secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations will continue to cling to the United States and its partner governments as long as they fail to air the truth and hold their officials accountable. The impunity currently enjoyed by responsible parties also paves the way for future abuses in counterterrorism operations. There can be no doubt that in today’s world, intergovernmental cooperation is necessary for combating terrorism. But such cooperation must be effected in a manner that is consistent with the rule of law. As recognized in the Global CounterTerrorism Strategy adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2006, “effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals, but complementary and mutually reinforcing.” Consistent with this principle, it is incumbent on the United States and its partner governments to repudiate secret detention and extraordinary rendition, secure accountability for human rights violations associated with these operations, and ensure that future counterterrorism operations do not violate human rights standards. GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 9 RECOMMENDATIONS To the United States government: 1. Repudiate the CIA’s practice of extraordinary rendition. 2. Cease reliance on “diplomatic assurances” against torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as a basis for transferring individuals to foreign countries. 3. Reaffirm and extend the commitment set forth in Executive Order 13491 to close secret CIA detention facilities by prohibiting secret detention— including short-term secret detention—by or with the involvement of any U.S. federal agency. 4. Disclose information relating to human rights violations associated with secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations, including but not limited to the identities of all individuals subjected to these operations, along with available information on their detention and treatment, current whereabouts, and diplomatic assurances secured in particular cases. The U.S. administration and senate should work to declassify, to the maximum extent possible, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report on CIA detention and interrogation. 5. Conduct an effective and thorough criminal investigation into human rights abuses associated with CIA secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations (including into abuses that had been authorized by the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice), with a view to examining the role of, and holding legally accountable, officials who authorized, ordered, assisted, or otherwise participated in these abuses. 6. Create an independent, non-partisan commission (with authority to access all relevant documents, subpoena witnesses, and make its concluding report public) to investigate human rights abuses associated with CIA secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations (including into abuses that had been authorized by the Office of Legal Counsel), with a view to examining, and publicly disclosing, the role of officials who authorized, ordered, assisted, or otherwise participated in these abuses. 7. Create an independent, non-partisan board to review compensation claims and provide just compensation to all individuals subjected to human rights abuses associated with CIA secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations. 8. Publicly disclose the report and recommendations of the Special Task Force on Interrogations and Transfer Policies (created pursuant to Executive Order 13491 in January 2009 to issue recommendations R E COMME NDAT IONS 10 for ensuring that these policies comply with U.S. domestic laws and international obligations) along with descriptions of measures taken to implement the recommendations, so that the public may be able to assess whether policies were revised and adequate safeguards instituted against torture and other abuses associated with CIA secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations. 9. Institute safeguards for ensuring that future joint counterterrorism operations do not run afoul of human rights standards, including by making participation in such operations contingent on compliance of all participating governments with human rights standards. To OTHER GOVERNMENTS THAT PARTICIPATED IN CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION OPERATIONS: 1. Refuse to participate in CIA extraordinary rendition. 2. Refuse to participate in secret detention, including at the behest, or with the involvement, of any U.S. agency or any other government. 3. Disclose information relating to human rights violations associated with CIA secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations, including but not limited to the identities of all individuals subjected to secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations along with available information on their detention and treatment, current whereabouts, and diplomatic assurances secured in particular cases. 4. Conduct effective and thorough investigations (including, where appropriate, criminal investigations) into the full range of human rights abuses associated with CIA secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations, with a view to examining and publicly disclosing the role of, and holding legally accountable, officials who authorized, ordered, assisted, or otherwise participated in these abuses. 5. Provide appropriate compensation to all individuals subjected to secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations in which the particular government participated. 6. Institute safeguards for ensuring that future joint counterterrorism operations do not violate human rights standards, including by making participation in such operations contingent on compliance of all participating governments with human rights standards. GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 11 Section I INTRODUCTION Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to commence a secret detention program under which suspected terrorists were held in CIA prisons (also known as “black sites”) outside the United States, where they were subjected to interrogation methods that involved torture and other abuses. At about the same time, he also granted the CIA expansive authority to engage in “extraordinary rendition,” defined here as the transfer—without legal process—of a detainee to the custody of a foreign government for purposes of detention and interrogation.6 Both programs, highly classified and conducted outside the United States, were designed to place detainee interrogations beyond the reach of law. Torture was emblematic of both. Cofer Black, who was director of the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center on September 11, said in subsequent Congressional testimony: “There was ‘before’ 9/11 and ‘after’ 9/11. After 9/11 the gloves come off.”7 Under the secret detention program, the CIA subjected its detainees to “enhanced interrogation methods” involving torture and abuse in secret prisons in far-off countries, removed from public and judicial scrutiny. Extraordinary rendition was intended to outsource abusive interrogations. As one U.S. official “directly involved in rendering captives into foreign hands” told the Washington Post: “We don’t kick the [expletive] out of them. We send them to other countries so they can kick the [expletive] out of them.”8 Secret detention placed detainees in CIA custody, whereas extraordinary rendition eventually placed detainees in foreign government custody. But the two programs had similar modalities and entailed the same kinds of human rights violations—the abduction and disappearance of detainees, their extra-legal transfer on secret flights to undisclosed locations around the world, followed by their incommunicado detention, interrogation, torture, and abuse. Moreover, extraordinary rendition typically involved secret detention by the United States if only for the time it took to transfer the person to the custody of another government. In some instances, the same detainee was subjected both to prolonged secret detention in CIA custody and extraordinary rendition to a country where the detainee was at real risk of torture. Consequently, this report focuses on both operations. Today, more than a decade after September 11, 2001, it is well-established that high-ranking Bush administration officials are responsible for torture and other human rights violations associated with the CIA’s secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations. The failure of U.S. authorities to hold these officials accountable remains a matter of significant concern. But responsibility for these violations does not end with the United States. Secret detention and extraordi- INTR OD UCT IO N 12 nary rendition would not have been possible without the active participation of numerous foreign governments. These participating governments must also be held accountable. However, the extraordinary secrecy maintained by the United States and its partner governments with respect to these operations presents a barrier to accountability. The U.S. government has refused to publicly and meaningfully acknowledge its role in any case of extraordinary rendition or to disclose the locations of its secret overseas CIA prisons. Although President Bush acknowledged that about 100 individuals were secretly detained by the CIA, the U.S. government has only disclosed the identities of 16. It has also refused to identify cooperating governments, and few of those governments have admitted to their role. Consequently, no comprehensive official account exists of foreign government participation in these operations. Nor is there a comprehensive official record of the victims of human rights abuses associated with secret detention and extraordinary rendition. This report seeks to fill that gap. Based on credible public sources and information provided by reputable human rights organizations, it provides the most comprehensive possible account of both the victims subjected to, and the participation of foreign governments in, these operations. The extraordinary level of government secrecy associated with these operations means that it is impossible to corroborate every factual assertion in this report. Nonetheless, the information presented here demonstrates that the human rights abuses associated with secret detention and extraordinary rendition were significant and systemic, and the scale of foreign government participation in these operations was substantial and far greater than previously realized. Section II below traces the evolution of CIA secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations until the present day. Section III provides an overview of international legal standards applicable to these operations. Section IV describes the cases of 136 individuals reportedly subjected to CIA secret detention and/or extraordinary rendition operations. Section V describes the roles of 54 foreign governments that reportedly participated in various ways in CIA secret detention and/or extraordinary rendition operations. Section VI offers concluding observations. GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 13 Section II The Evolution of CIA Secret detention and extraordinary rendition Operations Extraordinary Rendition There is no publicly available official U.S. government definition of “extraordinary rendition.” It is defined here as the transfer—without legal process—of a detainee to the custody of a foreign government for purposes of detention and interrogation.9 Although “extraordinary rendition” is generally regarded as a practice that began after September 11, 2001,10 the United States government has engaged in “rendition” (defined here as the transfer—without legal process—of a detainee for purposes of criminal prosecution either into the United States or to the custody of a foreign government) for a considerably longer period of time.11 Indeed, the practice of rendering a criminal suspect into the United States was specifically addressed by the U.S. Supreme Court as early as 1886. In Ker v. Illinois, the court held that the abduction and forcible transportation of a man from Peru to face larceny charges in the United States without availing of the extradition treaty then in existence between the two countries did not violate the U.S. Constitution, nor did the extradition treaty confer on him a right to asylum in Peru that would bar his forcible return to the United States.12 The Supreme Court held that “for mere irregularities in the manner in which he may be brought into the custody of the law, we do not think he is entitled to say that he should not be tried at all for the crime with which he is charged in a regular indictment.”13 The court did, however, add that its decision did not “leave the detainee or the government of Peru without remedy for his unauthorized seizure within its territory” since the messenger who abducted the detainee could be surrendered and tried for violations of Peruvian laws, and could also be sued by the detainee for trespass and false imprisonment.14 In Frisbie v. Collins, the Supreme Court upheld the Ker rule that “the power of a court to try a person for crime is not impaired by the fact that he had been brought within the court’s jurisdiction by reason of a ‘forcible abduction.’”15 Subsequently, in United States v. Alvarez Machain, the court held that an individual’s forcible abduction from TH E E V OLUTIO N OF C IA SEC RET DET ENT ION A ND E X TR A OR DI NA RY R E NDI TI ON OPE R ATI ONS 14 Mexico despite the existence of a valid extradition treaty did not prohibit his trial in a court in the United States for violations of the criminal laws of the United States.16 In 1986, in National Security Decision Directive 207, President Ronald Reagan reportedly authorized “renditions to justice” into the United States for suspects to face criminal charges, but only from locations where the U.S. government could not secure custody through extradition procedures, for example in countries where no government exercised effective control; countries known to plan and support international terrorism; and international waters or airspace.17 In 1993, President George H.W. Bush reportedly authorized specific procedures for renditions into the United States through National Security Directive 77, which remains classified.18 The Clinton administration continued to render terrorist suspects into the United States for criminal prosecution: the State Department’s report, “Patterns of Global Terrorism 2001,” listed ten such renditions into the United States between March 1993 and September 2001.19 In addition, President Clinton signed a number of presidential directives relating to renditions, including PDD-3920 and PDD-62,21 and under his presidency, in the late summer of 1995, the CIA began rendering detainees to foreign governments for prosecution.22 The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9-11 Commission) staff statement on diplomacy described this shift: “If extradition procedures were unavailable or put aside, the United States could seek the local country’s assistance in a rendition, secretly putting the fugitive in a plane back to America or some third country for trial.”23 In 1995, U.S. agents reportedly approached Egypt about becoming a partner in this rendition program, and Egypt accepted because it wanted access to Egyptian Al Qaeda suspects while availing of U.S. resources to track, capture, and transport suspects across the world.24 These early renditions to third countries for prosecution were confined to a small number of cases. According to Michael Scheuer, former chief of the CIA unit charged with tracking Osama bin Laden, every target had been convicted in absentia; before a suspect was captured, a dossier was prepared containing the equivalent of a rap sheet, and the CIA’s general counsel approved every operation.25 Nonetheless, individuals subjected to these early renditions allege they were tortured, and some of them were subjected to the death penalty after unfair trials.26 In September 1995, the United States helped kidnap Talaat Fouad Qassem (an Egyptian who had been sentenced to death in absentia for the assassination of Anwar Sadat) in Croatia, and rendered him to Egypt; he disappeared after being brought to Egypt, and is believed to have been executed.27 In the summer of 1998, the CIA assisted the Albanian police in the capture of five suspected militants, including Shawki Salama Attiya, who were bound, blindfolded, taken to a deserted airbase, and thereafter flown to Cairo.28 Attiya alleged he was tortured in Egyptian custody by being subjected to electric shocks, hung from his limbs, and imprisoned in a cell full of kneedeep filthy water, and two of the other suspects, who had been sentenced to death in absentia, were hanged.29 According to former CIA Director George Tenet, the CIA took part in over 80 renditions before September 11, 2001.30 After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, renditions vastly expanded in number and scope to encompass transfers to third countries solely for the purpose of detention and interrogation, where there was no prospect of criminal prosecution, GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 15 and where detainees were at risk of torture.31 Within days of the September 11 attacks, President Bush reportedly issued a directive authorizing the CIA to conduct these “extraordinary” renditions without any advance approval from either the White House or the Departments of Justice or State.32 The CIA gained broad authority to secretly transfer terrorist suspects to be detained and interrogated in the custody of foreign governments, including those known to employ torture.33 The Washington Post reported that according to a U.S. official who was directly involved in rendering captives to foreign governments, the understanding was: “We don’t kick the [expletive] out of them. We send them to other countries so they can kick the [expletive] out of them.”34 By 2005, the United States had reportedly extraordinarily rendered 100 to 150 suspects to foreign countries.35 Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state at the time, defended rendition “as a vital tool in combating terrorism.”36 She did not mention that after September 11, 2001, the rendition program was radically expanded to allow transfers of detainees to foreign governments solely for the purpose of detention and interrogation, including to governments known to employ torture. She did state that “where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.”37 However, CIA Director Porter Goss virtually admitted in congressional testimony that such assurances were of little use, observing that “[w]e have a responsibility of trying to ensure that they are properly treated, and we try and do the best we can to guarantee that. But of course once they’re out of our control, there’s only so much we can do.”38 Extraordinary rendition victims were tortured despite assurances provided by recipient governments. As set forth below, Maher Arar was imprisoned for more than ten months in a tiny grave-like cell, beaten with cables, and threatened with electric shocks by the Syrian government, despite its assurances to the U.S. government that it would not torture him and despite post-transfer consular visits by Canadian officials.39 Ahmed Agiza and Muhammed al-Zery reported being subjected to electric shocks in Egyptian custody, despite Egypt’s assurances to the Swedish government that they would not be tortured, and despite a post-transfer monitoring mechanism that involved Swedish diplomats visiting the men while they were held in Egyptian custody.40 The CIA’s Office of Inspector General has reportedly investigated a number of “erroneous renditions” in which the CIA abducted and detained the wrong people.41 A CIA officer told the Washington Post: “They picked up the wrong people, who had no information. In many, many cases there was only some vague association” with terrorism.42 However, the U.S. administration continues to withhold documents relating to these investigations, despite specific requests for their disclosure.43 Secret Detention and “Enhanced Interrogation Techniques” On September 17, 2001, President Bush authorized the CIA to operate a secret detention program under which suspected terrorists were secretly transported to be held incommunicado in CIA prisons (known as black sites) outside the United States, where they were subjected to “enhanced interrogation techniques” that inTH E E V OLUTIO N OF C IA SEC RET DET ENT ION A ND E X TR A OR DI NA RY R E NDI TI ON OPE R ATI ONS 16 volved torture and abuse.44 As noted above, although there is a conceptual distinction between secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations, there is little practical difference: both entailed the abduction and disappearance of detainees, their extra-legal transfer on secret flights to undisclosed locations around the world, followed by their incommunicado detention, interrogation, torture, and abuse.45 President Bush first publicly acknowledged the secret detention program on September 6, 2006, when he announced that the CIA had detained and interrogated detainees in secret locations outside the United States before transferring fourteen of them to Guantánamo Bay.46 He added that, “[t]he current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program. But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.”47 The CIA secretly held its detainees in Afghanistan, Lithuania, Morocco, Poland, Romania, Thailand, and Guantánamo Bay.48 President Bush has stated that about a hundred detainees were held under the CIA secret detention program, about a third of whom were questioned using “enhanced interrogation techniques.”49 These techniques included abusive methods such as “walling” (quickly pulling the detainee forward and then thrusting him against a flexible false wall), “water dousing,” “stress positions” (forcing the detainee to remain in body positions designed to induce physical discomfort), “wall standing” (forcing the detainee to remain standing with his arms outstretched in front of him so that his fingers touch a wall four to five feet away and support his entire body weight), “cramped confinement” in a box, “insult slaps,” (slapping the detainee on the face with fingers spread), “facial hold” (holding a detainee’s head temporarily immobile during interrogation with palms on either side of the face), “attention grasp” (grasping the detainee with both hands, one hand on each side of the collar opening, and quickly drawing him toward the interrogator), forced nudity, sleep deprivation while being vertically shackled, and dietary manipulation.50 President Bush stated that he authorized “waterboarding,” which was applied on three detainees.51 Michael Hayden, former CIA director, confirmed in congressional testimony in 2008 that these three detainees were Khaled Shaikh Mohammed, Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, and Abu Zubyadah.52 Used in its early incarnations during the Spanish Inquisition,53 waterboarding is described in U.S. government documents as a technique which involves “binding the detainee to a bench with his feet elevated above his head,” “immobilizing his head,” and “plac[ing] a cloth over his mouth and nose while pouring water onto the cloth in a controlled manner. Airflow is restricted for 20 to 40 seconds and the technique produces the sensation of drowning and suffocation.”54 The United States prosecuted Japanese interrogators for waterboarding U.S. prisoners during World War II.55 Waterboarding and other torture methods applied on CIA detainees were specifically authorized by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in a series of legal opinions. In a memorandum dated August 1, 2002, then Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee opined that physical abuse would not amount to torture unless it inflicted pain of a level associated with organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.56 In any event, the memorandum found, even if an interrogation GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 17 conducted at the behest of the president did amount to torture under the domestic criminal anti-torture statute, “in the circumstances of the current war against al Qaeda and its allies,” criminal prosecution under the U.S. anti-torture statute would represent “an unconstitutional infringement of the President’s authority to conduct war,” and moreover, “necessity or self-defense” could also “justify” interrogation methods that violated the statute.57 A second August 1, 2002, memorandum, also signed by Bybee, authorized the CIA to use on its detainee Abu Zubaydah 10 specific interrogation methods, including waterboarding, placing him in a “cramped confinement box with an insect” in light of his apparent fear of insects, cramped confinement in a dark space to restrict his movement, walling, stress positions, wall standing, sleep deprivation, attention grasp, facial hold, and “facial slap (insult slap).”58 On December 30, 2004, following public outcry over the first Bybee memo described above which was leaked to the public earlier that year, the OLC issued a replacement memorandum (the “December 30, 2004, memorandum”) that disavowed torture and appeared on the surface to distance itself from the first Bybee memorandum, but stated in a footnote that the conclusions of that memorandum would not have been different under the standards of the December 30, 2004, memorandum.59 On May 10, 2005, the OLC issued two more memos relating to the application of the federal anti-torture statute to interrogation methods. The memos authorized virtually all of the methods that had previously been authorized by the second Bybee memo described above.60 On May 30, 2005, the OLC issued yet another memo concluding that the same interrogation methods were also lawful under the ban against cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment under Article 16 of the Convention against Torture.61 The latter memorandum was issued in advance of the enactment later that year of the Detainee Treatment Act, which affirmed that the prohibition against cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment applied to all detainees in U.S. custody, including foreigners held overseas.62 According to a report by the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), which interviewed 14 “high value detainees” in September 2006 after they were transferred from secret CIA detention to Guantánamo Bay, the detainees were subjected to various forms of ill-treatment during their detention in secret locations, including suffocation by water poured over a cloth placed over the nose and mouth, prolonged stress positions such as standing naked with arms held extended and chained above the head, beatings by use of a collar held around the detainee’s neck and used to forcefully bang the head and body against a wall, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation, exposure to cold temperature, prolonged shackling, threats of ill-treatment, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food for up to one month.63 On July 20, 2007, President Bush issued an executive order reauthorizing detention and interrogation by the CIA.64 According to an OLC memorandum issued the same day, the CIA “propose[d] a limited detention and interrogation program pursuant to the authority granted by the President” that intended for persons “to be detained only so long as is necessary to obtain the vital intelligence they may possess” after which the CIA would transfer them to the custody of other entities, including in some cases, the Defense Department.65 Indeed, the memorandum noted that this “formula” had already been followed with regard to one person—Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi—held in CIA custody since the president’s SeptemTH E E V OLUTIO N OF C IA SEC RET DET ENT ION A ND E X TR A OR DI NA RY R E NDI TI ON OPE R ATI ONS 18 ber 6, 2006, remarks during which he announced that the CIA secret detention program was empty at that time.66 Al-Iraqi had been questioned by CIA officials, following which, on April 26, 2007, the CIA placed him in the custody of the Defense Department.67 The memorandum also made clear that at the time of its writing, the CIA “expect[ed] to detain further high value detainees who meet requirements for the program, and it propos[ed] to have six interrogation techniques available for use, as appropriate.”68 These methods included dietary manipulation (feeding the detainee a bland, liquid meal), extended sleep deprivation up to 96 hours while shackling the detainee in a standing position with his hands positioned below his chin and above his heart to keep him awake, and the techniques known as facial hold, attention grasp, and insult or facial slap.69 The OLC concluded that these methods were lawful, including under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions (which the U.S. Supreme Court had concluded in June 2006 was applicable to the conflict with Al Qaeda70) and under the Detainee Treatment Act, signed into law by President Bush himself on December 30, 2005, which specifically barred the imposition of “the cruel, unusual, [or] inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution” on anyone in the custody of the United States government, regardless of location or nationality.71 The “enhanced interrogation techniques” authorized by the OLC and applied by the CIA on its detainees violated U.S. and international law (as examined further in Section III, below). Numerous experts have confirmed that—in addition to being illegal—these techniques are ineffective in eliciting reliable information. FBI interrogator Ali Soufan, who successfully elicited actionable intelligence from terrorist suspects without the use of such methods, testified before congress that these techniques “from an operational perspective, are ineffective, slow and unreliable, and as a result harmful to our efforts to defeat al Qaeda,” in addition to being “un-American and harmful to our reputation and cause,” and failing to “produce reliable intelligence,” in contrast to “rapport-building techniques [that] are far more effective at eliciting such intelligence.”72 Soufan testified before congress that his non-abusive interrogation of Abu Zubaydah yielded “important actionable intelligence,” and that once the CIA started subjecting Zubaydah to harsh interrogation methods, he “shut down and stopped talking” until Soufan was able to re-engage him using non-abusive methods.73 Career military intelligence officer Col. Steven Kleinman similarly testified before congress that “coercion is decidedly ineffective.”74 Former FBI special agent and counterterrorism expert Jack Cloonan testified that he believed “based on a 27-year career as a special agent and interviews with hundreds of subjects in custodial settings, including members of al Qaeda, that the use of coercive interrogation techniques is not effective,” and that “rapport-building” methods are more “effective, efficient and reliable.”75 Matthew Alexander, who led the interrogations team that located Abu Musab Al Zarqawi, the former leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, testified before congress that in his experience “when interrogators used harsh methods that fit the definition of abuse, in every instance, that method served only to harden the resolve of the detainee and made them more resistant to interrogation.”76 In contrast, he observed, “[d]etainees are more likely to cooperate when they see us live up to our principles.”77 Kleinman, Cloonan, and Alexander informed congress that U.S. interrogation policy GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 19 “came with heavy costs” and that “[k]ey allies, in some instances, refused to share needed intelligence, terrorists attacks increased world wide, and Al Qaeda and likeminded groups recruited a new generation of Jihadists.”78 In December 2012, the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted to approve its 6,000-page report entitled “Study of the Central Intelligence Agency’s Detention and Interrogation.”79 Although the report is classified, and was not publicly available at the time of this writing, the committee chairman, Senator Dianne Feinstein, stated that she strongly believed that the creation of long-term, clandestine “black sites” and the use of “enhanced-interrogation techniques” were “terrible mistakes,” and that the majority of the committee agreed.80 She also stated that the report would “settle the debate once and for all over whether our nation should ever employ coercive interrogation techniques such as those detailed in the report.”81 Current Policies and Practices On January 22, 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order directing that all detainees in U.S. custody or control during armed conflicts be treated humanely and all interrogations of such individuals conform to techniques authorized by Army Field Manual 2-22.3.82 The executive order further directed the CIA to close any detention facilities it was operating at that time and not to operate any such facilities in the future.83 It also established an interagency task force to study, evaluate, and issue a report including recommendations on “the practices of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the domestic laws, international obligations, and policies of the United States and do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control.”84 Although the task force report authorized by the executive order was issued in 2009, it was not made public.85 A Justice Department press release confirmed that the task force had made “policy recommendations” with respect to seven different kinds of transfers conducted by the U.S. government, including “transfer pursuant to intelligence authorities.”86 The press release stated that “[w]hen the United States transfers individuals to other countries, it may rely on assurances from the receiving country.”87 It added that the task force had “made several recommendations aimed at clarifying and strengthening U.S. procedures for obtaining and evaluating those assurances,” including a recommendation that the State Department be involved in evaluating assurances in all cases, and a recommendation that the inspectors general of the Departments for State, Defense, and Homeland Security prepare annually a coordinated report on transfers conducted by each of their agencies in reliance on assurances.88 According to the release, the task force also made several recommendations “aimed at improving the United States’ ability to monitor the treatment of individuals transferred to other countries,” including a recommendation that agencies obtaining assurances from foreign governments insist on a monitoring mechanism, or otherwise establish a monitoring mechanism, to ensure consistent, private access to the individual who has been transferred, with minimal advance notice to the detaining government.89 TH E E V OLUTIO N OF C IA SEC RET DET ENT ION A ND E X TR A OR DI NA RY R E NDI TI ON OPE R ATI ONS 20 The Obama administration has not stated that it intends to end extraordinary rendition or disclosed its policies and practices with respect to intelligence transfers. It has been reported that President Obama’s January 2009 executive order was specifically crafted to preserve the CIA’s authority to detain terrorist suspects for short periods prior to “rendering” them to another country for interrogation or trial.90 Thus, while that executive order required the CIA to close its “detention facilities,” it stated that the term did not “refer to facilities used only to hold people on a short-term, transitory basis.”91 The administration reportedly intends to continue the Bush administration’s practice of sending terrorist suspects to foreign countries for detention and interrogation while relying on assurances of humane treatment from recipient countries as well as the post-transfer monitoring of detainee treatment.92 However, as demonstrated below in the cases of extraordinary rendition victims Maher Arar, Ahmed Agiza, and Muhammed al-Zery, diplomatic assurances and post-transfer monitoring are not effective safeguards against torture. In addition, the United States has not conducted an effective criminal investigation into the CIA’s secret detention and extraordinary rendition practices. Shortly before taking office, then President-elect Obama dismissed the possibility of appointing a special prosecutor to investigate torture under the Bush administration, stating that “we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards.”93 In August 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder appointed Assistant U.S. Attorney John Durham to conduct a “preliminary review into whether federal laws were violated in connection with the interrogation of specific detainees at overseas locations.”94 The investigation was, however, fundamentally flawed from the start because it was restricted to unauthorized interrogation methods applied by the CIA. Holder made clear that “the Department of Justice will not prosecute anyone who acted in good faith and within the scope of the legal guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel regarding the interrogation of detainees.”95 Acts of torture, including waterboarding, that had previously been authorized by the OLC and applied on detainees by the CIA, did not, therefore, fall within the scope of the investigation. On June 30, 2011, the Justice Department announced that it had accepted Durham’s recommendation to open a full criminal investigation into the deaths of only two terrorism suspects in CIA custody overseas, and that the department would close inquiries into CIA involvement in the treatment of 99 other detainees.96 The two cases put forward for investigation were reportedly those of an Afghan, Gul Rahman, who died in 2002 at a prison known as the “Salt Pit” in Afghanistan, and an Iraqi, Manadel al-Jamadi, who was interrogated by three CIA officers at Abu Ghraib in 2003.97 In August 2012, Attorney General Holder summarily announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges in the two cases “because the admissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.”98 To make matters worse, U.S. courts have failed to hold the executive branch accountable for abuses associated with CIA secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations. They have accepted successive administrations’ arguments—based on the state secrets privilege and an asserted lack of judicial competence to address national security and foreign policy issues—for dismissing lawsuits brought on behalf of extraordinary rendition victims.99 To date, not a single case brought by an extraordinary rendition victim has reached the merits stage in a U.S. court. GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 21 Meanwhile, reports of secret detentions by or with the involvement of the CIA or other U.S. agencies remain a source of significant concern. In April 2011, the Associated Press reported that suspected terrorists in Afghanistan were being secretly detained and interrogated for weeks at 20 temporary sites including one run by the military’s elite counterterrorism unit, the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), at Bagram Air Base.100 More than a dozen former detainees reported that they were held for weeks at the JSOC site in 2010, forced to strip naked and kept in solitary confinement in windowless, often cold cells with lights on 24 hours a day.101 A 2010 Open Society Foundations report based on interviews with over 20 former detainees reportedly held at a secret JSOC facility at Bagram Air Base confirmed that the detainees were subjected to nudity upon arrival, excessive cold, excessive lighting, and sleep deprivation due to accumulation of circumstances, among other forms of ill-treatment.102 U.S. military officials reportedly confirmed that the detention centers did exist but described them as temporary holding pens whose primary purpose is to gather intelligence, and denied the allegations of abuse.103 In July 2011, it was reported that the Obama administration had secretly detained and interrogated Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali national, for two months aboard a U.S. Navy ship, after seizing him on international waters between Yemen and Somalia.104 He was reportedly interrogated by the “High-Value Interrogation Group,” made up of FBI, CIA, and Defense Department personnel, but U.S. officials said his interrogation was in accordance with the U.S. Army Field Manual, and that CIA officers did not directly question Warsame.105 In addition, The Nation reported in July 2011 that the CIA was using a secret prison in the basement of Somalia’s National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters, where detainees suspected of having links to Al Shabaab (a Somali militant group) are held incommunicado in small, filthy, windowless cells.106 The article stated that while the underground prison is officially run by the Somali NSA, U.S. intelligence personnel pay the salaries of intelligence agents and also directly interrogate detainees there.107 In addition, U.S. officials reportedly provided intelligence that led to Kenya’s kidnapping and extraordinary rendition of Kenyan citizen Ahmed Abdullahi Hassan to Somalia for interrogation and detention without charge or trial.108 Subsequently, the New York Times reported that the CIA has financed and provided training for Somali intelligence operations in addition to joining Somali operatives in interrogating detainees, including Ahmed Abdullahi Hassan.109 The Washington Post has also reported that in August 2012, three European men with Somali roots were arrested by local authorities in Djibouti, where they were detained and interrogated for months—including by U.S. interrogators—even though no charges were pending against them.110 Two months after their arrest, the three prisoners were secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in New York, then clandestinely taken into custody by the FBI and flown to the United States to face trial.111 The Washington Post further reported that Eritrean citizen Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed was held by Nigerian authorities in a Nigerian jail “for four months under pressure from U.S. officials.”112 He was first interrogated by a “dirty” team of U.S. agents who ignored the suspect’s right to remain silent or have a lawyer, and then by a “clean” team of U.S. agents who notified him of his rights, before he was ultimately transported to face terrorism charges in U.S. federal court.113 TH E E V OLUTIO N OF C IA SEC RET DET ENT ION A ND E X TR A OR DI NA RY R E NDI TI ON OPE R ATI ONS 22 Section III International Legal Standards Applicable to CIA Secret Detention and Extraordinary Rendition Numerous human rights bodies have condemned the CIA’s secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations. In 2006, the U.N. Committee against Torture called on the United States to “cease the rendition of suspects” and “ensure that no one is detained in any secret detention facility under its de facto effective control,” observing that “detaining persons in such conditions constitutes, per se, a violation of the Convention [against Torture].”114 Similarly, the Human Rights Committee urged the United States to “immediately cease its practice of secret detention and close all secret detention facilities” and “take all necessary measures to ensure that individuals, including those it detains outside its own territory, are not returned to another country by way of, inter alia, their transfer, rendition, extradition, expulsion or refoulement if there are substantial reasons for believing that they would be in danger of being subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”115 Indeed, the CIA’s secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations involved torture; cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; transfer to torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; arbitrary and secret detention; and enforced disappearance. As set forth below, each of these elements violated international human rights law. Moreover, responsibility for these violations extends not only to the United States but also to governments that participated in these operations in various ways. GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 23 Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment International law unequivocally prohibits torture. The norm against torture is a jus cogens norm from which no derogation is permitted.116 The U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), to which the United States and 152 other countries are party,117 expressly states that “[n]o exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.”118 In fulfillment of its obligation under Articles 4 and 5 of CAT to criminalize torture, the United States enacted 18 U.S.C. §2340A, a federal criminal statute that provides criminal penalties for acts of torture—including attempts and conspiracy to commit such acts—committed outside the United States. The statute recognizes federal extraterritorial jurisdiction over such acts whenever the perpetrator is a national of the United States or the alleged offender is found within the United States, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or of the alleged offender.119 Article 16 of CAT also requires states to prevent “other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture…when such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.”120 Numerous other human rights treaties and instruments—including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights—similarly prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.121 In addition, the prohibitions against torture and ill-treatment continue to apply during international and non-international armed conflicts under Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949.122 CAT and the ICCPR also require states to effectively investigate allegations of torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.123 Article 4 of CAT requires states to criminalize torture (including the attempt to commit torture or participation and complicity in torture) and to provide for appropriate penalties.124 Article 12 of CAT further provides that states must conduct a “prompt and impartial” investigation where there are “reasonable grounds” to believe that torture has occurred.125 The Committee against Torture has elaborated that the investigation must be conducted by qualified individuals, must be effective, and must attempt to determine both what happened and who is responsible.126 States party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions are similarly obligated to enact the domestic legislation necessary to prosecute grave breaches of the conventions (which include the torture or inhuman treatment of persons protected by the conventions); to search for those accused of committing grave breaches; and to either prosecute such individuals or turn them over to another state for trial.127 Thus, none of the aforementioned instruments afford states any discretion regarding whether to investigate allegations of torture or inhuman treatment. INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 24 In the case of Muhammed al-Zery, who was abused at Bromma airport in Sweden prior to being extraordinarily rendered to Egypt by the Swedish government (acting in concert with the United States), the Human Rights Committee observed that “the State party is under an obligation to ensure that its investigative apparatus is organized in a manner which preserves the capacity to investigate, as far as possible the criminal responsibility of all relevant officials, domestic and foreign, for conduct in breach of article 7 committed within its jurisdiction and to bring appropriate charges in consequence.”128 The committee found that Sweden’s failure to conduct an effective investigation in this case violated its obligations under Article 7 of the ICCPR, read in conjunction with Article 2 of the covenant.129 The European Court of Human Rights has similarly found, with respect to breaches of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights,130 that contracting states are required to conduct effective investigations capable of “leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible.”131 Finally, states have an obligation to provide an effective remedy and reparations for torture victims. Article 14 of CAT requires states to ensure that a victim of torture “obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible.”132 The Committee against Torture considers that Article 14 is applicable to all victims of torture and acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment without discrimination of any kind.133 Moreover, states parties have procedural and substantive obligations under Article 14. Their procedural obligations are to “enact legislation and establish complaints mechanisms, investigation bodies and institutions, including independent judicial bodies, capable of determining the right to and awarding redress for a victim of torture and ill-treatment, and ensure that such mechanisms and bodies are effective and accessible to all victims.”134 Their substantive obligations include “ensur[ing] that victims of torture or ill-treatment obtain full and effective redress and reparation, including compensation and the means for as full rehabilitation as possible.”135 Article 2(3) of the ICCPR also recognizes the right to an effective remedy for victims of human rights violations, which the Human Rights Committee defines to include the right to compensation.136 Thus, the United States violated international law by subjecting detainees held in secret CIA detention to “enhanced interrogation techniques” that involved torture and/or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Foreign governments that subjected extraordinarily rendered detainees to torture and/or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment also violated international law. The United States and most of its partner governments further violated international legal standards by failing to effectively investigate allegations of such mistreatment and provide redress to victims. GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 25 Transfer to Torture or Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment International law prohibits states from transferring individuals to countries where there is a real risk of torture or ill-treatment. Article 3 of CAT provides that “no State Party shall expel, return (“refouler”) or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.”137 The United States implemented this “non-refoulement” obligation in domestic law pursuant to the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998.138 The ICCPR139 and the European Convention on Human Rights140 similarly prohibit the transfer of an individual to another country in the face of a real risk of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Committee against Torture found in the case of extraordinary rendition victim Ahmed Agiza that Sweden violated Article 3 of CAT by expelling him to Egypt in the face of a real risk of torture there.141 The committee further found that Sweden’s procurement of anti-torture diplomatic assurances from Egypt “did not suffice to protect against this manifest risk.”142 Similarly, the Human Rights Committee found in the case of extraordinary rendition victim Muhammed al-Zery that Sweden violated Article 7 of the ICCPR by expelling him to Egypt despite the real risk of torture or other ill-treatment there.143 The committee further found that Sweden had not demonstrated that the diplomatic assurances it procured from Egypt to guard against his torture were sufficient to eliminate the risk of ill-treatment.144 The principle of non-refoulement further entails the right to effective, independent, and impartial review of the decision to transfer an individual to another country. Thus, the Committee Against Torture has specifically held in the case of Ahmed Agiza that “the right to an effective remedy contained in Article 3 [of CAT] requires… an opportunity for effective, independent and impartial review of the decision to expel or remove, once that decision is made, when there is a plausible allegation that Article 3 issues arise.”145 The committee found that Sweden violated its procedural obligations under Article 3 by transferring Agiza to Egypt without any such review.146 Similarly, the Human Rights Committee found in Muhammed al-Zery’s case that Article 2 of the ICCPR, read in conjunction with Article 7, requires an opportunity for “effective, independent review” of a decision to expel to an arguable risk of torture.147 The committee concluded that Sweden breached that obligation by failing to provide al-Zery with such review prior to his expulsion to Egypt.148 Thus, the practice of extraordinary rendition violated international legal standards because it entailed transferring individuals to the custody of foreign governments despite a real risk of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, and because it deprived individuals of effective, independent, and impartial review of the transfer decision. Where rendition (i.e. transfer—without legal process—of a detainee either into the United States or to the custody of foreign governments for purposes of criminal prosecution rather than for purposes of detention and interrogation) occurred in the face of such risk, it too violated the same legal standards. As noted in Section II above, many individuals rendered by the United States to foreign governments for criminal prosecution alleged that they were tortured after being transferred. INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 26 Arbitrary Detention and Enforced Disappearance The ICCPR provides that “[e]veryone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.”149 Other human rights treaties and instruments contain similar provisions.150 The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has ruled that secret detention is per se arbitrary.151 It has further found, with respect to 26 individuals secretly detained by the CIA in association with the “war on terror,” that these detentions were “arbitrary, being in contravention of article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,” and that they fell under category I of the categories applicable to the consideration of cases submitted to the Working Group,152 a category which applies “[w]hen it is clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis justifying the deprivation of liberty.”153 Furthermore, every instance of secret detention also amounts to a case of an “enforced disappearance” which is prohibited under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances.154 That convention defines “enforced disappearance” as “[t]he arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the state or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the state, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law.”155 The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has confirmed that “[u]nder no circumstances, including states of war or public emergency, can any State interests be invoked to justify or legitimize secret centres or places of detention which, by definition would violate the Declaration [on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance], without exception.”156 Similarly, the U.N. Human Rights Committee has found that “[t]he prohibitions against taking of hostages, abductions or unacknowledged detention are not subject to derogation. The absolute nature of these prohibitions, even in times of emergency, is justified by their status as norms of general international law.”157 In addition, international humanitarian law, applicable only to situations of armed conflict, prohibits secret detention. Indeed, the Geneva Conventions are premised on the notion that detainees in armed conflicts—be they prisoners of war or civilians—must be registered and held in officially recognized places of detention.158 The prohibition against enforced disappearance is also a rule of customary international humanitarian law applicable in all situations of armed conflict.159 In situations of occupation, Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which protects civilians during armed conflict, further provides that “[i]ndividual or mass transfers, as well as deportation of protected persons from occupied territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.”160 GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 27 Thus, CIA secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations violated international law because they entailed the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of individuals. As described in Section II above, renditions (i.e. transfer—without legal process—of detainees into the United States or to the custody of foreign governments for purposes of criminal prosecution rather than for detention and interrogation) also typically involved abductions, enforced disappearances, and/or arbitrary detention prior to subjecting the detainee to criminal process, and therefore also violated international legal standards even where there was no risk of post-transfer ill-treatment.161 Participation in Secret Detention and Extraordinary Rendition Operations While primary responsibility for the human rights violations associated with the CIA’s secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations no doubt lies with the United States, countries that participated or assisted in these operations also bear responsibility for these violations. International human rights law not only bars states from directly committing the violations associated with the extraordinary rendition and secret detention programs, but also obligates them not to transfer individuals to states where they are at real risk of torture or to otherwise cooperate with or facilitate the commission of those violations. The International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts provide that “[a] State which aids or assists another State in the commission of an internationally wrongful act by the latter is internationally responsible for doing so if: (a) that State does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act; and (b) the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by that State.”162 Significantly, examples of impermissible aid or assistance include “knowingly providing an essential facility” for the commission of the wrongful act, “facilitating the abduction of persons on foreign soil,” and “the act of a State in placing its own territory at the disposal of another State” in order to facilitate the commission of an unlawful act.163 As noted above, the Convention against Torture specifically prohibits and requires states to criminalize “complicity” or “participation” in acts of torture.164 The Committee against Torture has interpreted that prohibition as covering any acts that amount to “directly committing, instigating, inciting, encouraging, acquiescing in or otherwise participating or being complicit in acts of torture.”165 Furthermore, the European Court of Human Rights has observed that “extraordinary rendition, by its deliberate circumvention of due process, is anathema to the rule of law and the values protected by the [European] Convention. It would be incompatible with a Contracting State’s obligations under the Convention if it were to extradite or otherwise remove an individual from its territory in circumstances where that individual was at real risk of extraordinary rendition. To do so would be to collude in the violation of the most basic rights guaranteed by the Convention.”166 The Venice Commission, the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional matters, has observed that “[f]or a State knowingly to provide transit facilities to another INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 28 State may amount to providing assistance to the latter in committing a wrongful act, if the former State is aware of the wrongful character of the act concerned.”167 Under international law, responsibility for an internationally wrongful act may also arise from the failure to prevent wrongful acts by another state.168 More specifically, the prohibition against torture under international law includes a positive obligation to prevent torture.169 The Convention against Torture expressly requires states to “take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction,”170 as well as to also “prevent…other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment… committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.”171 The ICCPR also entails a positive obligation to prevent torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.172 Accordingly, states that knew or should have known of human rights violations associated with the CIA’s secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations bear responsibility under international human rights law for assisting in operations that entailed such violations. Especially in light of the widespread reporting on the secret detention and torture associated with the United States’ post-September 11, 2001, counterterrorism efforts,173 states were aware of the human rights violations associated with these efforts. In addition, because secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations depended on elaborate plans involving the high-level cooperation of other governments in securing the secret capture, detention, and transfer of detainees, it is extremely unlikely that these governments did not know of the potential human rights violations associated with such operations. GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 29 Section IV DETAINEES subjected to postSeptember 11, 2001, CIA secret detention and extraordinary rendition To date, owing to the extraordinary secrecy surrounding CIA secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations, there is no precise estimate of the total number of detainees subjected to these operations. By 2005, the United States had reportedly extraordinarily rendered 100 to 150 suspects to foreign countries.174 Ahmed Nazif, then Prime Minister of Egypt, stated in 2005 that Egypt alone had received “60 or 70” terrorist suspects from the United States since September 11, 2001.175 President Bush has stated that about a hundred detainees were held under the CIA’s secret detention program, about a third of whom were questioned using “enhanced interrogation techniques,” which, as shown above, involved torture and other abuse.176 Previous attempts at identifying individuals subjected to CIA detention and extraordinary rendition operations include a February 2007 Human Rights Watch report, which published a list of 16 people Human Rights Watch believed were once held in CIA prisons and whose whereabouts were unknown at the time, as well as a separate list of 22 missing people who were possibly once held in CIA prisons and whose whereabouts were unknown at the time;177 a June 2007 report by six human rights organizations (Amnesty International, Cage Prisoners, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at NYU School of Law, Human Rights Watch, and Reprieve), which identified 39 individuals missing at the time and believed to have been held in secret sites run by the United States government overseas;178 a 2008 article by Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann, which identified 67 rendition victims, 53 of whom had been rendered after September 11, 2001;179 a 2009 article (based on information provided by Human Rights Watch) by Dafna Linzer, which identified 35 missing detainees believed to have been held in CIA custody;180 and a 2010 United Nations report on the secret detention practices of various countries in the context of countering terrorism.181 DETAINEES SUBJECTED TO POST-SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 30 Provided below is a list of 136 named detainees who reportedly were subjected to CIA secret detention and/or extraordinary rendition operations. Although there may be many more individuals who were subjected to these operations, this is the most comprehensive list of these individuals assembled to date.182 The facts in this list are derived from credible public sources and information provided by reputable human rights organizations, as specified in the accompanying endnotes. The list revises and supplements the information contained in the aforementioned lists. Unlike some of the aforementioned lists, this list does not focus solely on individuals who are currently missing, but rather on all known individuals reported to have been subjected to secret detention and extraordinary rendition at some point in time, even if they are no longer missing. It combines secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations because the two programs had similar modalities, and torture, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, and other abuses were common to both. 1 Shaker Aamer, a Saudi national and British resident, was reportedly captured in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001.183 Bounty hunters sold Aamer twice to different groups of soldiers before the Northern Alliance transferred him to U.S. custody at Bagram Air Base in December 2001 where he was severely abused.184 He was also held in CIA custody at the “Dark Prison” in Kabul, where he was tortured.185 He was transferred to Guantánamo Bay in February 2002, where he has been detained without charge or trial since.186 2 Mohammed Omar Abdel-Rahman, an Egyptian national, was captured by the CIA in Quetta, Pakistan in February 2003 and secretly detained in U.S. custody (including in Bagram, Afghanistan) for about six months to a year.187 He was subsequently transferred to a secret prison in Egypt where he was held for about a year before being transferred to Tora prison in Egypt.188 He was released from Egyptian custody in late 2010.189 3 Muhammad Rahim al-Afghani, an Afghan national, was captured in Lahore, Pakistan in August 2007,190 and, according to a U.S. Department of Defense press release, was transferred to Guantánamo Bay on March 14, 2008, as a “high value detainee.”191 The Department of Defense release described him as “a close associate of Usama bin Ladin [who] had ties to Al Qaeda organizations throughout the Middle East. He became one of bin Ladin’s most trusted facilitators and procurement specialists prior to his detention.”192 The release stated that, “prior to his arrival at Guantánamo Bay, he was held in CIA custody.”193 Al-Afghani’s capture and detention coincided with the Justice Department’s issuance of memoranda authorizing the CIA to use severe sleep deprivation tactics on a specific detainee in 2007.194 (The detainee’s name is redacted in the memoranda.) Since al-Afghani was the only detainee known to be held in CIA custody at that time, it is likely that he was the detainee subjected to these tactics.195 4 Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian national, was living in Sweden with his wife and five young children, waiting for a determination on their political asylum application, when, on December 18, 2001, he was secretly apprehended by Swedish Security Police who took him to Bromma airport on the outskirts of Stockholm.196 Agiza was then handed over to CIA agents, who stripped him, dressed him in overalls, and chained and shackled him before transportGLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 31 ing him in a Gulfstream V aircraft (N379P) to Egypt, where he was severely tortured.197 Agiza was subjected to electric shocks in Egyptian custody, despite Egypt’s assurances to the Swedish government that he would not be tortured, and despite a post-transfer monitoring mechanism that involved Swedish diplomats visiting him while he was held in Egyptian custody.198 According to Agiza, he was imprisoned and tortured for a year in the State Security prison in Nasr City, while being temporarily transferred to Tora prison only for the Swedish ambassador’s visits.199 After that, Agiza says he was held in Tora prison for two years, after which he was transferred to the “Scorpion” prison.200 In April 2004, after a six-hour military trial, Agiza was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for membership in a banned Islamic organization.201 The court, without explanation, denied his requests for a forensic medical examination to prove his allegations of torture; according to Human Rights Watch, which acted as an independent trial monitor, the proceedings did not fulfill internationally recognized due process requirements.202 In June 2004, Agiza’s prison sentence was reduced to 15 years, again without explanation.203 Agiza was released from prison in August 2011.204 In July 2012, Sweden granted him permanent residency.205 5 Qari Saifullah Akhtar (Amir Harkat-ul-Ansar Qari Saifullah), a Pakistani national, was transferred from the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan in August 2004,206 and may have been held in secret CIA custody.207 Akhtar was alleged to have led the terrorist-designated group Harkat-ul Jihad al-Islami, to be connected to a plot to assassinate Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, and to have run a terrorist training camp in Rishkor, Afghanistan.208 The United States was reportedly interested in questioning Akhtar and on July 19, 2006, his name was included in the “Terrorists No Longer a Threat” list.209 He was released from custody in May 2007.210 6 Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali (Ammar al-Baluchi), a Kuwaiti national, was captured with Waleed bin Attash and four other suspected Al Qaeda members by the Pakistani Intelligence Bureau and a team of Pakistani rangers in Karachi, Pakistan, on April 30, 2003.211 (Al-Baluchi is the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and is married to Aafia Siddiqui.)212 He was secretly detained by the CIA in a prison in Rabat, Morocco in 2004.213 The U.S. government confirmed in September 2006 that al-Baluchi was among 14 “high value detainees” transferred from secret CIA detention to Guantánamo Bay.214 His transfer to Guantánamo Bay occurred on September 4, 2006.215 Al-Baluchi is currently detained in Guantánamo Bay, and awaits trial by military commission on murder and terrorism charges associated with the September 11, 2001, attacks.216 In May 2011, military prosecutors brought capital charges against him for his role in the September 11, 2001, attacks.217 7 Hussein Salem Muhammed Almerfedi, a Yemeni national, was captured in Tehran by Iranian authorities sometime after September 11, 2001, handed over to Afghan authorities in March 2002 as part of a prisoner exchange,218 and was held in CIA detention in Afghanistan.219 He alleged that he was “kidnapped in the Islamic Republic of Iran and held for a total of 14 months in three prisons in Afghanistan,” “two under Afghani control and one under US control [Bagram].”220 According to detainee Wesam al-Deemawi, a Yemeni DETAINEES SUBJECTED TO POST-SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 32 man called Hussein Mohammed was held in the CIA’s Dark Prison in Kabul when al-Deemawi was held there.221 Almerfedi was subsequently transferred to Guantánamo Bay in May 2003, where he remains detained.222 8 Mohamad Farik bin Amin (Zubair), a Malaysian national, was apprehended in Thailand in June 2003.223 The U.S. government confirmed in September 2006 that Zubair was among 14 “high value detainees” transferred from secret CIA detention to Guantánamo Bay.224 He was transferred to Guantánamo Bay on September 4, 2006, where he remains imprisoned.225 9 Maher Arar, a dual national of Canada and Syria, was detained while he was in transit at New York’s John F. Kennedy airport on September 26, 2002, by U.S. authorities, based on “inaccurate and unfairly prejudicial” intelligence provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.226 He was detained and interrogated by U.S. officials in New York for almost two weeks, following which, on October 7, 2002, the regional director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service issued an order finding Arar to be a member of Al Qaeda and directing his removal from the United States.227 On October 8, 2002, he was flown by the CIA to a detention center in Amman, Jordan, where he was blindfolded and beaten by Jordanian guards.228 Later the next day, he was driven to Syria, where he was imprisoned in the Far Falestin detention center, also called the Palestine Branch, which was run by the Syrian Military Intelligence (SMI).229 He was detained for more than ten months in a tiny grave-like cell seven feet high, six feet long, and three feet wide, beaten with cables, and threatened with electric shocks, among other forms of torture.230 On August 20, 2003, he was transferred to Sednaya prison, before ultimately being released on October 5, 2003, and returned to Canada.231 Mr. Arar was tortured despite the fact that the U.S. government obtained diplomatic assurances from the Syrian government that it would not torture him.232 Canadian consular officials visited him several times while he was imprisoned in Syria, during which he could not tell them about his torture for fear of retaliation; it was only during the seventh visit that he decided to speak out despite the serious risks of doing so.233 10 Mohammed al-Asad, a Yemeni national, was detained in Tanzania by Tanzanian authorities on December 26, 2003, and transferred the next day to Djibouti, according to his complaint before the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights.234 He was held incommunicado and abused in Djibouti for about two weeks before being driven to the airport and transferred to a U.S. “rendition team” of five individuals clad in black, their faces concealed, who carried him onto a waiting plane.235 He was subjected to further incommunicado detention and abuse in three secret CIA prisons, including two in Afghanistan.236 While in secret detention, al-Asad was subjected to abusive conditions, including extreme isolation and absence of human contact, loud music and artificial light twenty-four hours a day, exposure to cold, and dietary manipulation.237 On May 5, 2005, al-Asad was transferred to a prison in Yemen after which he was tried on, and pled guilty to, a charge of forging travel documents based on his own admission to Yemeni prosecutors that he had used unauthorized documentation in Tanzania.238 He was eventually released on March 14, 2006, without ever being charged with a terrorism-related crime.239 GLOBALIZING TORTURE: CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 33 11 Hassan bin Attash (Umar al-Gharib), a Saudi-born Yemeni, was seized with Ramzi bin al Shibh in Karachi, Pakistan on September 11, 2002, when he was 17 years old.240 The younger brother of Waleed bin Attash, Hassan bin Attash was held in Karachi for four days, during which time he was beaten and kicked repeatedly during interrogation by U.S. and Pakistani interrogators, then transferred to the CIA’s Dark Prison in Kabul, Afghanistan for three days.241 He was then transferred to GID (General Intelligence Department) custody in Jordan, where he was subjected to sleep deprivation, slapped in the face and ears, hung from the ceiling, beaten on his feet, with salt water poured on after, and then forced to run on his bare feet after these beatings.242 He was detained in Jordan until January 8, 2004, when he was returned to Afghanistan with Ali alHajj al-Sharqawi.243 He was transferred from Afghanistan to Guantánamo Bay in September 2004, where he remains detained.244 12 Waleed Mohammed bin Attash (Tawfiq bin Attash),245 a Yemeni national, was captured in Karachi, Pakistan, on April 29, 2003,246 after which he was subjected to secret CIA detention, including in Poland in March 2003.247 He was also reportedly detained in a secret CIA prison in Bucharest, Romania as of October 1, 2004.248 The U.S. government confirmed in September 2006 that he was among 14 “high value detainees” transferred from secret CIA detention to Guantánamo Bay, where he remains imprisoned.249 In May 2011, military prosecutors brought capital charges against him for his role in the September 11, 2001, attacks.250 13 Mustafa Faraj al-Azibi (Abu Faraj al-Libi), a Libyan national, was captured in Mardan, Pakistan, on May 2, 2005, and held in secret CIA detention.251 The U.S. government confirmed in September 2006 that he was among 14 “high value detainees” transferred from secret CIA detention to Guantánamo Bay.252 He remains imprisoned in Guantánamo Bay. 14 Walid bin Azmi, nationality unknown, was extraordinarily rendered from Pakistan to an unknown location in January 2004,253 and there is some evidence254 that he may have been held in secret CIA detention.255 15 Ghairat Baheer, an Afghan national, was captured along with Gul Rahman in Islamabad, Pakistan on October 29, 2002, by U.S. agents and Pakistani security forces and subsequently transferred to Afghanistan.256 He was held in CIA custody in the Salt Pit for six months, during the time that Gul Rahman was also held there; Baheer reports being forced to sleep naked on concrete, being hung naked for hours on end, and being tied to a chair while U.S. interrogators sat on him.257 He was subsequently detained in Bagram, and released in May 2008.258 16 Fahad al Bahli, a Saudi national, was arrested on June 22, 2003, in Malawi, in a joint operation involving the CIA and Malawi’s National Intelligence Bureau.259 Suspected of having Al Qaeda links, al Bahli and four other men arrested on the same day were first held in Malawi, and secretly flown two days later to Harare, Zimbabwe, where they were held for almost a month.260 They were then transferred to Sudan, where they were released after it was established that there was no evidence linking them to Al Qaeda.261 The out- DETAINEES SUBJECTED TO POST-SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, CIA SECRET DETENTION AND EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION 34 going U.S. ambassador to Malawi reportedly denied that U.S. agents were involved, but a Malawian government official told Amnesty International that U.S. agents controlled the operation and that the U.S. authorities had taken the five men out of Malawi on a chartered aircraft.262 17 Amin Mohammad Abdallah al Bakri, a Yemeni national, was seized in Bangkok on or around December 30, 2002, by U.S. or Thai intelligence agents.263 According to court papers filed on his behalf, he was held in secret CIA prisons for about six months before being transferred to Bagram Air Base, and coercively interrogated and tortured in those locations; in CIA detention, he was subjected to serious abuse, resulting in injuries to his knees and back.264 According to alleged Al Qaeda leader and Bagram escapee Abu Yahya alLibi (now deceased), al Bakri was held in the Dark Prison as well as in “Rissat” prison and a prison in the Panjshir Valley before being transferred to Bagram.265 Al Bakri’s relatives only learned he was alive when they received a letter from him through the ICRC, informing them he was being held at Bagram Air Base.266 Since 2010, he has been cleared three times for release by U.S. military detainee release boards, but remains detained in Bagram.267 18 Jamil el-Banna (Abdul Latif el-Banna), a British resident and Jordanian citizen, was arrested by Gambian intelligence agents on November 8, 2002, upon his arrival at Banjul airport with Bisher al-Rawi.268 Gambian authorities told el-Banna and the other arrestees that the British had ordered the arrests.269 El-Banna was first detained and interviewed by CIA and Gambian authorities270 after the British intelligence service MI5 wrongly told U.S. officials that al-Rawi was carrying bomb parts in his luggage.271 El-Banna was first transferred to the Dark Prison and later to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.272 According to his lawyer, in the Dark Prison, el-Banna was imprisoned underground in isolation and darkness and tortured over two weeks.273 He was held in leg shackles 24 hours per day, starved, beaten, kicked, dragged along floors while shackled, and was unable to sleep due to continuous screams from fellow detainees.274 In early 2003, el-Banna was transferred to Guantánamo Bay.275 He was released without charges on December 19, 2007, and returned to Britain.276 Spain subsequently issued an extradition warrant for him, but dropped all charges in March of 2008.277 19 Nashwan abd al-Razzaq abd al-Baqi (Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi), an Iraqi citizen alleged to be Al Qaeda’s top operational planner in Afghanistan,278 was captured in 2006 by Turkish authorities, who turned him over to the United States.279 He was in CIA custody as of late 2006,280 and was transferred to Guantánamo Bay in April 2007.281 An April 27, 2007, Defense Department press release described him as a “high value detainee” transferred from CIA custody to Defense Depart"
