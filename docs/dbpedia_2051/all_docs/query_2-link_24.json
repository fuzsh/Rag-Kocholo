        "text": "After nearly a decade of painstakingly piecing together small bits of intelligence, US officials got a huge break in their search for Osama bin Laden last year when they heard his trusted courier’s voice on a phone call.\n\nThe courier was meticulous about avoiding detection — even turning off his cellphone and removing its battery more than 90 minutes outside of the compound, CBS News said.\n\nBut eventually, he slipped up and led US Navy SEALs directly to bin Laden’s front door. CBS identified the courier as Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan; The Associated Press said his name was Sheik Abu Ahmed, from Kuwait.\n\nShortly after the hunt for bin Laden began, US officials suspected the key to finding him would be locating his courier — the man who would be trusted to communicate with the outside world on behalf of bin Laden.\n\nThe first clue came when al Qaeda’s No. 3 operative — 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed — gave up the nicknames of several of bin Laden’s couriers. In 2004, Hassan Ghul was nabbed and gave up an alias for the chief courier and linked him to KSM and his replacement, Faraj al-Libi.\n\nThen in 2007, another detainee revealed the chief courier’s real name, ABC News reported. Two years later, US authorities narrowed down his general location.\n\nLast year, authorities heard him on the phone and were able to track his movements. In August, they discovered the compound in Abbottabad — and realized it was built for a “high-value” target."
