        "text": "What non-Muslims can learn from the Hajj ‚ù∂Gratitude and humility: The Hajj requires sacrifice. During their journey, pilgrims separate themselves from many worldly comforts and focus on what God has provided for them in their journey, per Arab News. ‚ù∑Brotherhood: Muslims from diverse backgrounds take part in the Hajj side-by-side. Rich, poor, Palestinian, Saudi, Jordanian, old, young, etc., all participate in the same rituals and pray side-by-side, per Salon. From this example, we can learn to embrace our common humanity. ‚ù∏Patience: The journey to Mount Arafat is longer for some pilgrims than others. Travelers must navigate crowded and challenging conditions, after waiting years for the time and money to go. Nevertheless, they look forward to the chance they have to travel to the sacred site. We can learn to exercise similar patience as we navigate our own struggles. Devotion: At Mount Arafat, Muslims worship God together, raising their arms to the sky and praying, per The Associated Press. This period of intense devotion and reflection encourages individuals to think about their own relationship with God. Believers of other faiths may be inspired to consider how they show their devotion to God. https://lnkd.in/dhm9s4sq\n\nUNREACHED PEOPLE GROUP OF THE DAY! Pronunciation üó£Ô∏è:vye The Vai live in northwestern Liberia and eastern Sierra Leone, West Africa. Those living along the coast are surrounded by sandbars and swamps; while those living farther inland dwell in thick, forested areas. They are one of more than twenty different tribes in Liberia. Most of the Vai are farmers, growing rice and vegetables for one or two years before the farmer must move to a new plot. The only trees not cut down are the palm trees, which provide nuts and shade for the farmers. Women and children participate in farming by chasing away the birds and weeding the plot. The Vai are also known as tailors and craftsmen. However, modernization is changing their way of life. Ministry Obstacles Islam's belief that Jesus is a prophet second to Mohammed, makes it difficult to present Jesus as Son of God and God incarnate. Outreach Ideas However, their Islam is quite animistic and that should open them to Jesus and his gospel of power. Hence, confrontation of spirits (power encounter) should find a positive reception. Scripture Focus \"Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set aside the king‚Äôs command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.\" Daniel 3:28 Scripture Prayer Pray that leaders of this people group will be as amazed at the works of God as this Babylonian king. Pray that they will worship God alone. Prayer Focus Pray that presenting Jesus as a person of power against spirits would open the door for the gospel and open them to missionary presence. Pray for mission agencies to adopt the Vai for planting strong churches that will plant even more churches. https://lnkd.in/eq7zAuR4 #JoshuaProject #npminternational #unreachedpeoplegroups #GO #SHARE #PRAY #GIVE #MENTOR #Gospel #Church #Evangelism #GreatCommission #Jesus\n\nThe Resurrection of Jesus Christ ·ã®·ä¢·ã®·à±·àµ ·ä≠·à≠·àµ·â∂·àµ ·âµ·äï·à≥·ä§ Recent research on the resurrection of Jesus points to the historicity of the events surrounding His resurrection. These results definitely support the belief that Jesus' resurrection was a real event in human history. There is no salvation without the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Many people may think that \"being saved\" means salvation. This is, in fact, not the case. While the cross saved us from sin, the resurrection completed our salvation, as the dead will rise when Christ returns again. The resurrection amounts to the Father's clear signal that Jesus is the powerful Son of God who has conquered death and reigns as Lord of all (Romans 1:4; 4:25). The resurrection demonstrates that Jesus' ‚Äúblood of the new covenant‚Äù saves His people from their sins. Outside of the cross of Jesus Christ and His resurrection, there is no hope in this world.\n\nChristmas celebrations are beginning all over the world as we enter Advent. Decorations, twinkling lights and trees are appearing in windows and town centres. There is excitement and anticipation. Everywhere, that is, except the place where Jesus Christ was born. In Bethlehem, Christmas is canceled. Palestinian Christian leaders across denominations in the West Bank city decided last week that they will forgo all festivities this year as a mark of solidarity with their brethren in Gaza. There will be no public celebrations, no twinkling Christmas lights and no decorated tree in Manger Square ‚Äî not as long, they say, as a state of war reigns over the embattled Gaza Strip. Palestinian Christians belong to the world‚Äôs oldest Christian communities, rooted in the historic cradle of Christianity. However, Western media has done a great job of convincing people that all Palestinians are barbaric, anti-Semitic Muslims; an unquestioned combination of Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism. As you participate in your office parties and Secret Santas, please think about whether you will continue to do business with or invest with Israeli interests while they are carrying out a genocide in the Holy Land. So what is happening this year in Bethlehem? The priests intend to set up a small Nativity scene with rocks and debris piled atop it. ‚ÄúThis is what Christmas now means to us that we see Jesus being born among those who have lost everything, who are under the rubble.‚Äù #christmas #christianity #christianbusiness #christiancommunity #christmas2023 #ceasefirenow #neveragainisnow #freepalestine\n\nIslam is one of the world's major monotheistic religions, founded in the 7th century CE in the Arabian Peninsula. It is based on the belief in one God (Allah in Arabic) and follows the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, who is considered the last prophet in a long line of prophets that includes figures like Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Here are some key aspects of Islam: 1. **Core Beliefs**: - **Tawhid**: The oneness of God. - **Prophethood**: Belief in the prophets, with Muhammad being the final prophet. - **Revelation**: The Quran is considered the final, unaltered word of God, revealed to Muhammad. - **Afterlife**: Belief in life after death and the Day of Judgment. 2. **Five Pillars of Islam**: - **Shahada**: The declaration of faith, stating that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger. - **Salat**: Performing ritual prayers five times a day. - **Zakat**: Giving alms (charity) to the needy. - **Sawm**: Fasting during the month of Ramadan. - **Hajj**: The pilgrimage to Mecca, which every Muslim must undertake at least once in their lifetime if they are able. 3. **Scriptures and Texts**: - **The Quran**: The holy book of Islam, believed to be the literal word of God. - **Hadith**: Collections of sayings, actions, and approvals of Prophet Muhammad, which provide guidance on various aspects of life. 4. **Practices**: - **Daily Prayers**: Muslims pray five times a day facing the Kaaba in Mecca. - **Fasting**: Observing fast during the month of Ramadan from dawn until sunset. - **Charity**: Regularly giving to charity to support the less fortunate. - **Dietary Laws**: Following halal dietary laws, which specify permissible foods and methods of slaughter. 5. **Community and Society**: - **Ummah**: The global community of Muslims bound by their faith. - **Mosques**: Places of worship and community centers for Muslims. - **Sharia**: Islamic law derived from the Quran and Hadith, guiding aspects of daily life and legal matters. Islam emphasizes submission to the will of God, ethical conduct, and the pursuit of knowledge and justice. It has a rich history and diverse cultural expressions across different regions of the world.\n\nUNREACHED PEOPLE GROUP OF THE DAY! Pronunciation üó£Ô∏è: bah-GEER-mee foo-LAH-nee The Bagirmi Fulani are semi-nomadic, mixing farming with shepherding. Although some Fulani tribes travel seasonally with their flocks, the Bagirmi have a permanent home they live in for half of the year. They only travel during the dry season, when grazing lands and water are scarce. Many of the men have multiple wives. Since cattle are a symbol of wealth among the Fulani, brides are sometimes chosen because of the amount of cattle they own. The Fulani were one of the first people groups in Africa to be converted to Islam. The Bagirmi still hold on to many old Fulani traditions. They believe that family, cattle, strong morals, beauty, poetry, singing, and dancing are the most important things in life. Ministry Obstacles The Fulani continue to be strongly committed to their current religion and worldview. Change is quite difficult and usually occurs slowly. Outreach Ideas Reaching the Fulani may take a combination of contact inside and outside their communities. Pray that outreach will take place within the context of the market as well. Scripture Focus \"O LORD, in your strength the king rejoices, and in your salvation how greatly he exults!\" Psalm 21:1 Scripture Prayer Pray that leaders from this people group will look to the Lord, and only Him for strength and guidance. Prayer Focus Pray for the handful of Christian believers among the Bagmiri Fulani, that they will depend fully on the finished work of Christ, understanding the requirements for forgiveness of sin have been satisfied. Pray for sufficient rain to support the livestock of the Fulani, and for good yields for their crops. https://lnkd.in/eq7zAuR4 #JoshuaProject #npminternational #unreachedpeoplegroups #GO #SHARE #PRAY #GIVE #MENTOR #Gospel #Church #Evangelism #GreatCommission #Jesus\n\nPlease Pray For Bivin‚Äôs Mission Japan We need each other's prayers.
