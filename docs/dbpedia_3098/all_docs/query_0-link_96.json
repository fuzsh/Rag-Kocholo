        "text": "Value Planning\n\nAn art student recently asked me the following question:\n\nDear James,\n\nSome discussions I've been involved with lately have got me thinking about the relationship between color and value. Do you approach them as two different steps of a painting? For example some people see a well worked out monochromatic grisaille painting as perhaps the most important step in a painting, with the scumbled on color as an accentuating element. On the other hand some people have a more Alla Prima approach where they jump right into color, and create the illusion of \"turning\" surfaces and value directly through color mixing. How long do you spend on the monochromatic stage of a painting?\n\n---Pro Cedure.\n\nDear Pro Cedure,\n\nYou ask a very great question color and value. Yes, I do think about the value structure as a separate step in developing a studio composition. I tend to do that thinking as a preliminary step in the charcoal or pencil stage. As I'm sure you know, Norman Rockwell was the king of planning the value design first in charcoal before jumping into oil (above: \"The Ferry Story\" courtesy of Heritage auctions).\n\nWhether you plan the tonal structure as a separate study (as Rockwell, Cornwell, Lovell and many academics did) or whether you establish it on the final canvas as a preliminary stage of painting, either way it really is the foundation of a good picture. Color adds a lot, but it can’t save a bad value design.\n\nAnd even with a thorough planning, you can still turn forms with color temperature as you suggested in your question. Rockwell is a good artist to study for that, and I believe many of his instincts for impressionistic color effects came from his study with Charles Hawthorne.\n\nIn my case with a fantasy or historical painting, once I have figured out the tonal design in two or three values as a separate step, I begin the layin or block-in. I don’t use a monochromatic grisaille but rather a limited palette of color, such as yellow ochre, burnt sienna, and ultramarine blue. The whole step should only take an hour or two.\n\nMy goal in the preliminary block-in is to establish not only the tonal statement, but also the big warm and cool relationships and the overall color mood at the very outset of the painting process. I stay well short of darkest darks, saving those for the finishing steps of the painting.\n\nWhen working on location, or when painting the figure in under two hours, I am under shorter time requirements. So I often dive right in with color, but sometimes I do a quick pencil thumbnail sketch to plan the value design.\n\nAll the best, JG\n\n----------\n\nRelated post on GJ: The \"two-streams\" hypothesis of visual perception\n\nRecommended books: \"Hawthorne on Painting\"\n\n\"Rockwell on Rockwell\"\n\nI also cover this material in \"Imaginative Realism\"\n\nSky Conscious\n\nHere’s a fine head painting by the American artist Harry Anderson, known for his illustration and gallery work in opaque watercolor, (also known as tempera or gouache).\n\nPublish Post\n\nRather than point out all the excellent handling of edges and drawing, I want to point out the sky behind the head. It’s a very pale, low-chroma blue, almost matching the value of the light side of the form. What’s wonderful about the sky is how it steps back and provides a setting for the interesting area of the picture.\n\nHarry Anderson once said, “I imagine you might say that I am definitely sky conscious,”\n\n\"I can’t tolerate skies that force themselves on the viewer’s attention. Ordinarily the sky should be a foil for the rest of the design. It must retire, but many artists fail to grasp this truth. The source of light is always the lightest area in a picture. On a bright day this is the sun itself, when a white expanse in full light might be lighter than the sky, but on a gray day the sky is the source of light, and in this instance, the sky will be the lightest note—lighter even than pure white objects.”\n\n------\n\n“Harry Anderson Discusses his Painting in Tempera,” American Artist, May, 1956\n\nSee more Anderson images at Leif Peng’s “Today’s Inspiration” Flickr Sets.\n\nAnswers to your questions on \"Moving Out\"\n\nThanks, everybody for your interesting comments about the recent post “Moving Out.” It was a little experiment in form, combining a plein air study with fictional story. Sometimes I paint a house and think of it as a stage where a million private dramas are played out.\n\nTom, as far as the technical details, it’s in a Moleskine watercolor sketchbook, so it’s about 5 x 7.5 inches. I started with a pencil drawing and laid in an ochre undertone for the sky. I was going to going to come back with a blue wash, but forgot to, and liked it better warm.\n\nI laid some color down over the whole surface of the paper, saving out the shining tarp and the little bit of snow by the fence, which were the lightest notes. In some of the early passes, I floated the dark tones for the windows onto wet paper to let them bleed into the surrounding tone.\n\nEven after the first pass, the house needed to be “dirtied up” to look old. The truck was an ultramarine blue underwash with a semi-opaque light red laid over. The tree branches are mostly drybrushed, with branches added in pencil. Mario, some of the fine lines (clapboards and wires) are drawn in with a Caran d’Ache colored pencils.\n\nThe whole sketch took about an hour and a half. In the composite at the top of this post, I stuck a photo of the subject at the right so you can see how the camera saw things. The far semi tractor-trailer in the photo was in motion during the photo. And the pickup really did leave halfway through, so I had to rely on memory to finish it up. I did all the work on location; I almost never work on a study after returning home because I feel unplugged from the inspiration.\n\nMoving Out\n\nThe old house stood beside the railroad tracks. A satellite dish turned its ear to the dead sky. Some of the windows were covered over with clapboards, like blind eyes. A freight train rumbled by, screeching and grinding.\n\nA man came out of the house. He lifted a TV into the back of the pickup. Then he loaded in a chair and a table. He stretched a black plastic tarpaulin over the load and tied it down, jerking the rope and muttering. The black tarp shimmered in the March sunlight.\n\nA woman leaned her head out of the door. “Get lost,” she yelled. “I don’t care if I never see you again.” The door slammed. A turkey vulture circled overhead.\n\nI sat on the sidewalk across the street, painting quietly. Cigarette butts were scattered beside my feet.\n\nThe man got into the truck and started the engine. The train passed and the crossing gates lifted. The truck roared across the tracks.\n\nA half hour later the woman came out, wiping her eyes with her sweatshirt sleeves. She walked by, pushing a baby carriage, slowing down a little to see what I was doing.\n\n(Note--I did this painting on location last week, and parts of it happened--the action of the truck and the train and the vulture, but the human story was imaginary. Sometimes I can't stop my mind from overlaying a story onto a scene, and I'm attracted to sketching in bleak neighborhoods because of the strange glimpses of human existence I encounter there.)\n\nMenzel’s Drawings\n\nNineteenth century German artist Adolf von Menzel (1815-1905) was a tirelessly curious artist who drew everything, from buildings to wagons to his own big toe. Here’s one of his late drawings, a study of an old woman.\n\n“I never do drawings with a view to selling them,” he said. “As a rule I do them only as nature studies for a particular picture or as a casual thing for later use.”\n\nHis drawings often capture life on the run. “Art is a bolting horse,” he said. His pencil captured the tumultuous modern scene around him. He made many studies on location for a painting of the interior of an iron rolling mill (link to painting). “For weeks on end from morning to evening I stood between the huge whizzing, oscillating wheels and belts with red-hot blocks, and sketched.”\n\n“Art has kept pace with all the advancements and deviations of the development of the mind and will always keep pace with them, as artists, like mankind, are an integral part of this development.”\n\nQuotes from Menzel by Bruckmann\n\nPreviously on GJ: Menzel: Beyond Appearances\n\nPortrait of old lady from \"The Later Work of Adolf von Menzel,\" by Jarno Jessen, Magazine of Art, 1902, page 49\n\nWikipedia on Menzel\n\nDrawing of rolling mill worker from the Getty collection (which I believe incorrectly states that the drawing was not drawn on location. All the studies were done on site, according to Menzel's own letters.)\n\nBlending Into the Background\n\nThin channels of snow linger in the tractor ruts on a clear March day.\n\nAfter I painted the scene on location, I set up the painting in front of the scene itself, angling the painting to try to match the light levels.\n\nTrying to match a painting up with a camera view was the challenge faced by pioneering movie matte painters. One early technique, called a “glass shot” involved painting part of a scene onto a pane of glass positioned vertically in front of a camera. That way you could place a castle or some other structure in the scene adjacent to the filmed action.\n\nIf you want to play with this idea, it helps to have a panel that’s a little wider than the easel (in this case an 11x14 panel on an Open Box M pochade easel).\n\nAlso, the illumination on the painting has to be just right. My painting is shown in direct sunlight, but I often use a white umbrella to diffuse and control the light on the painting, especially when painting contre jour (facing the light source). In any kind of observational painting it really helps in color mixing if you can match illumination levels as much as possible.\n\nAnd speaking of blending in, check out how this Chinese artist does it.\n\n---------\n\nThe second photo is of Paramount matte painting veteran Jan Domela setting up for a glass shot. You can read more about Domela at the blog Matte Shot\n\nPreviously on GJ:\n\nWhite Umbrellas\n\nContre Jour Lighting\n\nHow to get a feeling of misty light\n\nThis painting from Dinotopia: Journey to Chandara uses a simple device. The subject is placed in a high-key silhouette near the sun. The silhouette colors shift to warm hues as they approach the sun.\n\nThe color corona around the sun spills over and influences both the colors of the sky and the silhouette colors. The color mixtures are actually fairly low-chroma (not very saturated), but you can get a feeling of great brilliancy this way. This is very easy to do in digital, but it takes a bit of deliberate planning in paint.\n\nA silhouette treatment is good to use in a sequential work like an illustrated book, comic book, or animated film, especially if you want to give the viewer a break from looking at a lot of detail.\n\nGood rule of thumb: the most brilliant impressions of light are achieved in paintings when looking toward, not away from the light source.\n\n----\n\nPreviously: Color Corona\n\nColor and Light, page 166-167.\n\nDinotopia: Journey to Chandara\n\nMucha’s \"Le Pater\"\n\nHalf-naked figures prostrate themselves in misty gorges, struggling and writhing before serene spirits of light.\n\nAmong Alphonse Mucha’s greatest achievements in his mature years were his seven pictures from the Lord’s Prayer, known as the “Pater Noster” or “Le Pater.”\n\nHe created a separate image for each line of the prayer. Above are the images for “Thy kingdom come,” and “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.”\n\nMucha visualized the familiar prayer as a universal expression of humankind’s relationship with the divine, mixing traditional Catholic devotion with an Asiatic-tinged occult mysticism.\n\nAbove: “Lead us not into temptation” and the cover.\n\nThe Century magazine in 1904 described Mucha’s unique conception of God as “no longer the benign or wrathful Father, but a mysterious Being whose shadow fills the earth. Nature is personified as a luminous, adolescent giant, and Love descends from heaven in the guise of a woman.”\n\nYou can see all seven images, as well as the decorative elements and calligraphy Mucha produced for the cover and the intervening pages at this website.\n\nQuote from: “Alfons Mucha and the New Mysticism,” by Christian Brinton, Century Magazine, 1904.\n\nAlphonse Mucha (1860-1939) on Wikipedia\n\nLines and Colors update on Mucha with a LOT of helpful links\n\nGood reproductions of all seven pictures in the Belvedere Catalog\n\nDisney uses lab tests to gauge response to ads.\n\nAccording to Variety magazine, the Disney company is working with a scientific laboratory known as the “Disney Media and Advertising Lab” or “Ad Lab” to analyze audience response to the ads appearing on its networks.\n\nThe lab building, which does not include the Disney logo, is located in Austin, Texas. Scientists dissect biometric data about eye tracking (left image above), heart rate, and galvanic skin response to better understand emotional reactions to ad content. According to Senior VP Artie Bulgrin, these data are far more accurate than the self-reporting of questionnaires.\n\nAnother technique called “facial coding” or “facial mapping” (right image, above) tracks tiny movements of individual facial muscles. For the future, the scientists at Ad Lab are considering including data from brain wave analysis to better understand how people respond to ads.\n\nThe lab’s primary mandate is to study advertising strategies on behalf of ESPN, ABC, and ABC Family, helping those multi-platform media networks to coordinate better with their advertising partners.\n\nAd lab studies classic metrics such as unaided recall to novel ad strategies like live ads, split screen ads, banners, and transparencies, where ads are superimposed over content.\n\nNo word yet on whether the mouse house is using ad lab to pre-test its motion pictures.\n\nAdweek article on Ad Lab\n\n\"Austin to House Disney's Ad Lab\"\n\nVariety article: “Disney’s Lab Studies People” by David Cohen\n\nLight Pillar and Sub Sun\n\nA light pillar is an optical phenomenon that occurs when the light of the sun reflects off tiny ice crystals floating in the air, forming a vertical column above the sun.\n\nIt usually happens when the sun is low in the sky, and sometimes even after it has set.\n\nLight pillars can also occur near the light of the moon or streetlights, as long as ice crystals are floating in the air near you.\n\nIce crystals are often shaped like tiny flat hexagonal plates. Like falling leaves, they tend to float downward with the flat surface parallel to the ground.\n\nSometimes you can see a reflection of the sun off the top surface of these floating crystals. Looking down from an airplane window, a “sub sun” reflection will occasionally appear in a region below the horizon underneath the sun.\n\nIn the case of the magnificent photo above, the secondary light effect is a sub-parhelion, more rarely observed. It's caused by light that reflects off of the hexagonal internal surfaces of the ice crystals.\n\nWikipedia on light pillar\n\nSub sun image from EPOD.\n\nNice explanation with diagrams of the ice crystals on Weather Doctor"
