        "text": "Andrew Blaser has had many jobs: taking a paper route in the hours of midnight to 5:00 in the morning, servicing the air compressors at 10,000-cow milking barns, driving dump trucks of dirt to job sites, coaching sports and being a detention monitor at a junior high school, serving food at Buffalo Wild Wings, and working as a front-desk receptionist. He is also a 2022 Olympian in the sport of skeleton, or “face-first one-man bobsled–slash–face luge,” in his words.\n\nIt’s no secret that most Olympians in America don’t make money. As a former one myself, I can say with transparency that I was fully supported by my parents—and since I retired before going to college, I never had to worry about having to make money while training as an elite athlete. But as Paralympic swimmer Jamal Hill puts it, “Being a student athlete is tough enough. But being a full-time working-adult athlete is near-impossible at the highest level.” In most sports, the peak of an athletic career happens in people’s late 20s or early 30s—but if the demands of competition make a traditional 9-to-5 job nearly impossible, how are adult athletes supporting themselves?\n\nGetting Discounted Rent\n\nRower Grace Luczak says the national team would live with host families while training at Princeton before the Olympics, “like foreign exchange students, but in our own country.” She remembers putting an ad in the local paper back in 2011 along the lines of “aspirational Olympian seeking housing: will babysit in exchange for rent.” Families who had connections to rowing asked their neighbors to pitch in, and a generous network slowly formed through word of mouth, helping to host the approximately 50 women vying for a spot. Renting costs were thus alleviated. Luczak also remembers making frequent Costco runs with the team for their cost-effective rotisserie chicken, and subsisting on lots of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while training. (Maybe this is why Team USA has a notorious love of peanut butter?) After competing at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, Luczak left for New York to pursue a marketing job at Ernst & Young because the lifestyle was simply too hard to sustain.\n\nSkeleton athlete Blaser worked as a leasing agent at an apartment complex, delivering notices to his neighbors about their outstanding balances on his nightly dog walk in exchange for discounted rent: “For 591 units, I delivered on average 150–250 notices a night, and they would discount basically one-third of the [price],” he says.\n\nFellow skeleton athlete Kendall Wesenberg sold her car, got crafty with air mileage points, and made sandwiches from hotel breakfasts so she wouldn’t have to pay for lunches on trips. It was important to learn how to be resourceful, because you knew that “you [were] not getting into skeleton for the pay.” Skeleton is a relatively niche winter sport located in winter resort towns with “equipment entirely specially made, as there is little to no recreational market to offset any manufacturing costs.” Most skeleton athletes get into the sport in the U.S. as a second sporting career, beginning at around 21 and going until their late 30s. She sometimes wonders how being able to afford some expenses, like chiropractic services or equipment, “and just not stressing about how I was going to make ends meet,” could have positively impacted her career.\n\nLow-Impact Side Gigs\n\nSupplementary jobs have to be either nonstrenuous with flexible working hours or make use of the athlete’s skills and help with their training directly. Wesenberg worked in a ski shop while living in Park City, and gave tours of the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs when possible. Adam Ballou, a Paralympic soccer player, was a shoe salesman at a sporting goods store, part-time soccer referee, and an English tutor while competing in the Paralympic soccer league in Spain.\n\nLuczak says part-time retail and dog-walking were popular gigs among women rowers, although she herself preferred cat- and bunny-sitting. It was important to have jobs that didn’t require too much physical or mental exertion, she says, given how exhausting it is to already be spending five to eight hours a day training. With two or three practices a day and a constantly fluctuating schedule, time flexibility was an important factor for logistical reasons, too.\n\nNotably, Luczak says it was different for the men at the time, who all had corporate jobs. Their rowing schedules recognized and accommodated the need to work outside of the sport: “The men would work out before rowing, go to work, come back, and then do one or two training sessions in the evening, while for the women [the schedule] would shift all the time.”\n\n“It was the unwritten rule enforced through the timing of practice that on the women’s team you have to be all in or you’re not going to be considered,” while on the men’s team they recognized that “you still need to have something else on your résumé, and be progressing towards other parts of your life.” Though the tide has since markedly turned for the better, Luczak retired before she got to receive the benefits of that change.\n\nDouble-Duty: Jobs That Help With Training\n\nOn the other hand, some athletes try to capitalize on the performance aspect of their sport. Trampoliner Logan Dooley was a freelance entertainer while training for the Olympics, performing at galas, parties, and toy fairs, supplementing the more stable source of income he got from coaching. He’s been the star of the show at a donor gala for USA Ski and Snowboarding, at local fairs, summer camps, NBA halftime performances, events off the sides of mountain cliffs, and at a “ ‘creation of time’ Christmas performance at a church,” where he jumped in a costume with crab legs to the music of the Beatles. One time while jumping at a New York toy fair, he double-bounced 2012 Olympian Savannah Vinsant, who was luckily saved by the net and didn’t fall onto the escalators of the mall. He shrugs off the memory by telling me that “the sport creates a little bit of a daredevil in anybody.”\n\nBeing in front of huge crowds and jumping at events with occasionally dangerous conditions actually helped make him a stronger competitor, however. As a junior in high school, Dooley was hired by Disney to jump on a trampoline as a card from Alice in Wonderland at the theme park’s parades. Throughout the years, he says, performing has helped him develop the confidence to keep going no matter what.\n\nWanting to return for her second Games in Tokyo, rower Luczak later found a job working for Hydrow, a fitness platform similar to Peloton but for rowing. She would record workouts as an instructor and then go do her own, slowly getting back into shape so she could rejoin the team. Still, her journey was atypical: “People are encouraged not to leave, and I was definitely initially punished for leaving because I had to make money.”\n\nFull-Time “Real” Jobs: Real Estate or Entrepreneurship?\n\nA lot of swimmers go into real estate. Exactly why, no one’s sure. But while most begin pursuing it after retiring, some, like swimmer and recent Olympic gold medalist Hunter Armstrong, do it part time while training, knowing they “can only swim for so long.” Armstrong has worked in family businesses his whole life—“from Army Surplus to laser tag and family recreation”—giving him a strong work ethic that transfers over well to swimming. He also dabbles in musical theater and magic, so it seems like he has a sufficiently diverse portfolio for making moves wherever he goes next.\n\nParalympic swimmer Hill used to run social media marketing for different brands before deciding to pursue the Olympics full time. He left his other jobs and began focusing on building his own brand and starting his own business. The faster he swims now, the better his foundation Swim Up Hill does: “[My] business has grown so much because it’s so intertwined with … my personal profile, so they’re just constantly building each other back and forth,” he says. By “including more holistic aspects of my person” into the brand, Hill says, there’s “more opportunity for profit, sustainability, and a longer career.”\n\nHill notes that while a lot of swimmers are supported throughout their college years, it’s easy for them to burn out afterwards. The sport, for him, is more than just an athletic career. But while he’s swimming more than ever before on his own terms, he’s also spearheading a movement to teach 1 million people around the world how to swim every year. The key to his success? “I think everybody’s got more to offer than just their sport,” he says. Over the years, he’s paid attention to the things that come easier rather than harder to him (he was a struggling physics major in college), and sharpened his business acumen. Though at one point he was sponsored by Speedo, he eventually realized the deal wasn’t good business for him: “I probably had like a top-10-percent earning contract in the world, which is scary to think about across Olympic and Paralympic athletes,” he says, noting that he “had to break like 19 American records to receive all the benefits of that contract,” which he estimates to be around $110,000 before taxes.\n\n“When I look at the space, I know people who are accepting $20,000 [in endorsement contracts] a year, and they’re Olympic medalists. If people are accepting contracts like that, the space will stay stagnant. But if people don’t have the ability to take a stand financially,” it’s hard to be in a place to negotiate, he says.\n\nYou Have to Make the Money to Make It to the Olympics\n\nThough there are many ways to hustle, the bottom line is that most athletes have to hustle in the first place: Endorsements are important but extremely variable, and often dependent on winning. Scholarships are useful, but only through college (and some sports, like rhythmic gymnastics, have no collegiate infrastructure). Stipends from national governing bodies are helpful, but not substantial. And though athletes learn how to budget their time and compartmentalize their energies to an impressive degree, Blaser—with his accoutrement of side jobs—still ended up working 70 to 80 hours a week."
