        "text": "Suppose we allow that Vladimir Nabokov’s novels Pale Fire and Lolita were written by fictional authors Charles Kinbote and Humbert Humbert, respectively, as opposed to Vladimir Nabokov. In that case, we should also question our use of the word narrator when referring to these characters, as so many critics often do. Perhaps because it appears so overtly and across several of his novels, the meta-fictionality of Nabokov's author-narrators is seldom touched upon in the ever-growing mountains of literature devoted to decoding the puzzles he left behind in his novels. By author narrator, I mean a first-person narrator whose narration is fully contextualized by their at least part-time occupation as an author in a fictional world writing a nonfiction text to a fictional audience—notice, here, the inverse of the real-life author’s relation to the text. To put this author-narrator concept into more precise terms, Charles Kinbote and Humbert Humbert are both authors in their respective diegesis, and the product of their labor in their fictional world is the \"same\" real-life text that we hold in our hands while we consume Vladimir Nabokov's real-life novel.\n\nIn the real world, a novel is always fully contextualized—it is the artistic product of a fiction writer. But inside the diegesis of a novel, the context of the telling is rarely touched upon, and when it is, it is often not revealed in a way that is commensurate with the written, literary form with which the real-world reader engages. A prime example of a novel in which the telling is contextualized but not commensurate with the form of a novel (i.e., a book) is Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness—the novel, framed entirely through quotations, is the oral retelling of a mythical voyage between sailors. Conrad’s novel is certainly more intriguing narratologically speaking than a novel that provides no context for its telling insofar as the context of the telling—sailors speaking on a boat—accounts for the words as they exist both inside the diegesis, spoken by Marlow, and outside the diegesis, written by Conrad. In other words, a novel that fails to contextualize its telling does not fully construct the artifice of a new world. More so than Conrad's novel, Nabokov’s placement of a fictional “Forward” at the beginning of Lolita and Pale Fire has the effect of establishing the text’s double existence as a fictional text composed by a real world author that is read by real-world readers and a nonfiction text composed by a fictional character that is intended for “readers” inside a diegesis, who would presumably be familiar with the events of the novel, seeing as they happen in their diegesis’s history.\n\nMy aim in writing this novella was to explore this narrative space—to tell a story that is mediated by both time and distance from the original events and composed as a work of nonfiction in a fictional world. The narrator, Logan, is a trained documentarian who is leaving his natural mode of telling behind so as not to reveal his true identity (even though he inevitably does). Much of my decision making in writing this text was grounded in my desire to pursue that dual existence of the text as both a non-fiction artifact and a fictional story. Nabokov wrote that \"we should always remember that the work of art is invariably the creation of a new world, so that the first thing we should do is to study that new world as closely as possible, approaching it as something brand new, having no obvious connection with the worlds we already know\" (Nabokov, Good Readers and Good Writers).\n\nI want to conclude this project with two quotations that, once read, I hope will synthesize why this narrative strategy of Nabokov’s is so important for the overall study of literature. In one of the final notes to “Pale Fire,” Kinbote writes: “what if we awake one day, all of us, and find ourselves utterly unable to read? I wish you to gasp not only at what you read but at the miracle of its being readable” (Kinbote 289). Simon Karlinsky, in an essay called “Illusion, Reality, and Parody in Nabokov’s Plays,” wrote that Nabokov’s central theme was “the nature of the creative imagination and the solitary, freak-like role into which a man gifted with such imagination is inevitably cast in any society…the hero [of a Nabokov novel] uses his imagination to devise a reality of his own, which he seeks to impose on the surrounding reality. The question of which reality is real, that of the hero or that of his environment, is usually left open” (Karlinsky VIII 2). Nabokov’s narrative strategy, more than anything, calls attention to the miracle of literature, the miracle of our ability to read. In the contemporary fiction space, where so much of the hope of publishing a novel centers around a conjoined movie deal, Nabokov reminds us that there are tasks that only literature can accomplish. It is for this reason that most movies of Nabokov novels are abysmal—it is a nearly impossible task to reconstruct the artifice visually. Thus, his novels draw our attention to the singularity of literature, the mental gymnastic that turns words into images."
