A Painted Turtle (Chrysemys picta), however, had pulled itself almost completely out of the water to maximize its exposure to the direct sunlight. For the record, I am not the kind of guy who enjoys baking in the sun on a beach.\n\nI really like the turtle’s pose and the way that it stands out amidst all of the water and the abundant vegetation. The beautiful reflection was a nice bonus, adding a bit of symmetry and additional visual interest to the image.\n\n© Michael Q. Powell.

I spotted this robber fly, a species commonly known as a Red-footed Cannibalfly (Promachus rufipes), on Monday while exploring a creek in Prince William County, Virginia. Red-footed Cannibalflies, as their name suggests, usually feed on other insects, but they reportedly are capable of taking down a hummingbird. Yikes!\n\nA posting that I did in 2013 entitled “Red-footed Cannibalfly” amazingly has been among my most popular postings ever, with 3360 views to date. Apparently more people search for information about Red-footed Cannibalflies that I would have anticipated.\n\nIn case you are curious, my current most viewed blog posting is one from August 2013 entitled “Fuzzy White Caterpillar,” with over 6800 views, including 3219 views in 2024 alone. I do not consider that posting to be one of my best nor are the photos in it particularly good, but somehow the Google search algorithm likes it and I continue to get lots of views of that posting. In general, I do not put much stock in the number of views and/or likes of my posts and do not really give them much weight when considering the “success” of any of my posts.\n\n© Michael Q. Powell.

I was therefore delighted last Thursday to spot several of them at the small pond at this refuge.\n\nSwift Setwings like to perch at the very tip of vegetation that hangs over the water, which makes getting a profile shot of one a challenge without getting wet. These little dragonflies often perch in a distinctive pose with their wings pulled forward, which reminded some scientist of the “ready-set-go” position of a sprinter and is reportedly the reason for the name of the species.\n\nOn this day, a breeze was blowing periodically and it seemed like the Swift Setwings had to repeatedly readjust their wing positions to maintain their balance, which you can see particularly well in the second photo below.\n\n© Michael Q.

There were handstands on the floor, on the rings, on the parallel bars, the high bar, and even on the pommel horse.\n\nWhen I spotted this male Blue Dasher dragonfly (Pachydiplax longipennis) doing a handstand last Thursday at Jackson Miles Abbott Wetland Refuge, I immediately thought of those Olympic gymnasts.\n\nThis position is sometimes referred to as the “obelisk” pose for dragonflies. Many scientists believe that it is used as a form of thermoregulation to keep the body cooler by reducing the amount of surface exposure to direct sunlight. Several other dragonfly species use this pose, but I observe it most often with the male Blue Dasher dragonflies.\n\n© Michael Q. Powell.

This species is not rare, but I do not see it very often at my favorite locations for dragonflies and damselflies. It is pretty easy to identify a Blue-fronted Dancer because, as its name suggests, its thorax is almost completely blue, with only a few hairline shoulder stripes.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the damselflies in the genus Argia, are commonly known as “dancers” because of the distinctive jerky form of flight they use, which contrasts with the straightforward direct flight of bluets, forktails, and other pond damselflies.\n\nBlue-fronted Dancers are quite small, about 1.5 inches (38 mm) in length, so it was quite a challenge to get this one in focus as he perched on some vegetation close to the ground. I am pretty sure that I switched to manual focus for this shot, because the autofocus of my camera has trouble staying on such a narrow subject and kept trying to focus on the ground.\n\n© Michael Q.

When I first noticed the nest, there were a several Osprey sitting in the nest—initially I thought there were only two in the nest, but when I looked more carefully, I could see that there were at least three osprey there.\n\nAs I watched, another osprey flew into the nest as you can see in the first photo below. The nest does not appear to very large, so the the birds had to rearrange themselves a bit to accommodate the new arrival. In the second photo, one of the osprey seemed to be expressing its displeasure with the need to move a bit.\n\nI think this may be a family unit, though I can’t be absolutely sure of that. When I look closely at the eyes of the osprey, some of them appear to be orangish in color, unlike the paler eyes of adults.\n\nI especially love the body language in the second photo. It’s fun to imagine the conversation that is taking place. Perhaps, for example, the osprey with the flapping wings is complaining that the newly arrived osprey did not have a fish in its talons to share with the rest of the family. What do you think?\n\n© Michael Q. Powell.

Most of the vultures that I see in my area are Turkey Vultures, which have red, featherless heads, but, as you can in the photo, we also have Black Vultures.\n\nI readily acknowledge that vultures play an important role in our ecosystems by eating dead animal carcasses and preventing the spread of diseases that could affect local food webs and human health. However, I admit that I, like most people, find these amazing birds a little creepy. Perhaps it is the result of watching countless Westerns on television as a child, movies in which circling vultures were always seen as a foreboding sign of death.\n\nI like the way that this stark, naked tree enhances the spookiness of the vulture. One of my Facebook friends suggested that this would make a good Halloween image. For now, the image serves to remind us that life is ephemeral, tomorrow is not guaranteed.\n\n© Michael Q. Powell.

It is such a challenging task that I titled a video that I posted on YouTube, “Impossible Shots? Dragonflies in flight.” Despite the almost overwhelming odds of getting a good shot of one of these aerial acrobats in flight, I feel irresistibly drawn to trying over and over again whenever I see a dragonfly in the air.\n\nI spotted this Black Saddlebags dragonfly (Tramea lacerata) patrolling over the waters off of Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge last Thursday and was thrilled to capture this shot of the dragonfly as it flew past me.Black Saddlebags dragonfly (Tramea lacerata). I love the way that you can see how the dragonfly had enhanced its aerodynamic profile by folding up its legs under its thorax, a bit like the way aircraft retract their landing gear after taking off.\n\nIn case you are curious, Black Saddlebags are only about 2 inches (52 mm) in length, so I have to be paying attention in order to even spot one. After years of pursuing my quest, though, my eyes are now calibrated to recognize the shape of a dragonfly pretty quickly and my hand-to-eye coordination has improved with practice, so that I am able to track these a lot better than when I started.\n\n© Michael Q. Powell. All rights reserved.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI love to look closely at dragonfly wings. I have a mental picture of the cells of a dragonfly wing as being made up of regularly-shaped squares, like those on a page of graph paper. When I examine them in real life, though, I am always delighted to see all of the different shapes and sizes of these tiny cells in intricate patterns that rival those of massive stained-glass windows.\n\nI photographed this male Widow Skimmer dragonfly (Libellula luctuosa) last Thursday at Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge. I love to see dragonflies with patterned wings and the males of this species have the added bonus of having both brown and white patterns on each wing.\n\nThis dragonfly was relatively cooperative and did not fly away as I moved slowly into a position that gave me a good view of the wings. I had to bend and crouch a little to get this shot that emphasizes the impressive wingspan of this handsome little dragonfly.\n\n© Michael Q. Powell.

Of course, it is often impossible to “fill the frame,” because my wildlife subjects frequently are skittish and are likely to depart if I move too suddenly or get too close to them.\n\nAs I was reviewing my photos from a visit to Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge last week, I came across this shot of a Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus). The wren was pretty far away and had its back to me. The only thing that saved this from being another “butt shot” was the slight turn of the wren’s head that provided me with a chance to get a profile shot.\n\nThe shot of the wren is ok, but it was the amazing background that took my breath away. I dabble with watercolor painting and I would be absolutely thrilled to be able to paint a background like this, with all of those different shades of green and the deliciously soft “bokeh ball.” Wow!\n\nI decided that the main subject of the photo that I wanted to show you all was actually the background, not the Carolina Wren. Consequently I did not crop very tightly and left it to the viewers to focus their attention on the linear structure of the branches and on the wonderful background. I am not sure that a thumbnail view of the image will grab folks’ attention, but I am ok with that—the photos in my blog are intended to provide an interesting view of some aspect of the beauty of nature and not serve as click-bait to maximize the number of views.\n\n© Michael Q.

Now, though, the trees are covered in leaves and Ospreys are increasingly hard to see as they perch among the leaves, especially if they remain silent.\n\nI was delighted to spot this vigilant osprey last week at Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge. He was alert and focused—he seemed to be paying attention to something, though I am not sure of the subject of his surveillance.\n\nThe winds were kicking up periodically, causing a cowlick of feathers to stand up in the back of the osprey’s head. When I was a child, I had a similar problem and had to use a bit of Brylcreem to keep the unruly hair in place. (My Mom used to be able to accomplish the same thing with my hair using only a bit of her saliva and her fingers.)\n\n© Michael Q. Powell.

The position appears to be both awkward and acrobatic, but amazingly the dragonflies are able to fly while in this position.\n\nI was searching for dragonflies last week at Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge when a pair of mating Calico Pennant dragonflies (Celithemis elisa) flew by me and landed in some nearby vegetation. Calico Pennants are some of the most spectacular dragonflies in our area, with bright colors and distinctive patches on their wings.\n\nFeeling a bit like a voyeur, I moved a little closer to them and slowly crouched a bit to get a better angle for my shot. In the image below, you can see how the female grasps the abdomen of the male during this process.\n\nI was happy to be able to get most of the two dragonflies in focus, which is always a challenge in situations like this.\n\n© Michael Q.

Yesterday here in the Washington D.C. area we had a record high temperature for 15 July of 102 degrees (39 degrees C) with the heat index even higher. Yikes.\n\nFollowing recommendations of doctors and weather forecasters, I stayed indoors for most of the day and worked on a few images that I captured last week at Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge, including this shot of a Halloween Pennant dragonfly (Celithemis eponina).\n\nMany dragonflies perch with their wings held stationary, but Halloween Pennants seem to move their wings about quite a bit to maintain their balance as they perch precariously on the very tips of tall stalks of vegetation. It is very easy to isolate the dragonfly from the background, because they are perched above all of the ground clutter, but it is a bit of a challenge to focus on the dragonfly as it is buffeted to and fro by even the slightest of breezes.\n\n© Michael Q.

In the first photo, a male Red-winged Blackbird seemed to be showing off for me as he balanced himself on a single leg, glanced in my direction, and seemed to smile. Eventually he climbed to the tip of the small branch and appeared to be complaining about something that he observed.\n\nA short distance away I captured the final image of a female Red-winged Blackbird. As you can she, she is not black nor does she have any red on her wings, so it feels a little strange to call her a Red-winged Blackbird. Although I was not able to get very close to her, I really like the overall composition of the image and the moment of action that I was able to capture as she called out.\n\n© Michael Q. Powell.

Recently I have seen Black Swallowtails fairly frequently and occasionally I will see a Pipevine Swallowtail. I know that there is also a dark morph version of the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail and a Red-spotted Purple butterfly sometimes looks almost like a swallowtail.\n\nAre you confused yet? When I spotted this cool-looking butterfly on Wednesday at Occoquan Bay National Wildlife Refuge, I was not sure what it was. Rather than endlessly speculating while in the field, I follow what I call the “Law of the Wild West”—shoot first and ask questions later—and wait to identify my subjects until after I have loaded my images onto my computer.\n\nI have grown accustomed to using a blog posting by the Louisiana Naturalist to help identify dark swallowtails—it provides side-by-side photos of four different species. On the basis of that posting and some other research, I have concluded that “my” butterfly is probably a Spicebush Swallowtail (Papilio troilus) butterfly, a species that I don’t recall seeing the past few years.\n\nThe background of the photo is not particularly interesting, but I was patient enough to wait for the butterfly to open its wings, so you get a good look at the wonderful markings of this Spicebush Swallowtail butterfly.\n\n© Michael Q.

When used together, complementary colors provide a high contrast and high impact color combination—together, these colors will appear brighter and more prominent.\n\nA week ago I was delighted to post a photo of a perched Carolina Saddlebags (Tramea carolina) dragonfly, a species that is almost always in flight when I am fortunate to spot one. A few days later, I managed to get some even better photos of a perched Carolina Saddlebags during a visit to Occoquan Bay Regional Park.\n\nThe lighting was good and the background was far enough away that it became blurry. The complementary colors of the dragonfly and the background really make these images “pop.” The interesting poses of the dragonfly draw in the viewer as well—a breeze was blowing and the dragonfly struggled a bit to maintain its hold on the tip of the vegetation on which it was perched.\n\nIt is really cool when the elements of a photograph come together like this and I am able to capture the scene in a way that is both technically and artistically pleasing. It was a good day.\n\n© Michael Q. Powell. All rights reserved.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLike many guys, I am not very good at remembering my own anniversary. In this case, though, I am not in trouble with a partner, because it is “only” the anniversary of my blog. Word Press informed me a couple of days ago that it has been 12 years since I started my blog. According to the Word Press stats, I have had 459,601 views and a total of 5,183 posts. Wow!\n\nI am pretty sure that I never intended for the blog to become a part of my daily life for such a long period of time. Initially I thought that the blog would be merely a vehicle for showcasing the wildlife photos that I was increasingly taking. It quickly became clear, however, that I enjoyed expressing myself in my words as well as in my photos. Over the years, I have gotten accustomed to the routine of sitting down in front of the keyboard most days, picking a recent photo or a small group of them, and saying something about the images.\n\nI have really appreciated the support and encouragement that I have received from so many readers over these last 12 years. My life has changed quite a bit over that time, but your support for the blog has been a steadying force for me. Thanks.\n\nA special thanks goes to Cindy Dyer, my dear friend and photography mentor, who sat me down 12 years ago and walked me through the steps of starting this blog—she remains a muse for my photography and other artistic endeavors.\n\nIn case you are curious, I am attaching a copy of the photo of a Blue Dasher dragonfly that was featured in my very first blog posting on 7 July 2012. As you can see, I was already “hooked” on dragonflies back then.\n\nAs I get older—I will turn 70 in a few weeks—I have become increasingly aware that nothing in life is guaranteed. My hope, though, is that I will continue this blog indefinitely, sharing my photos and musings in almost daily posts. Enjoy the journey with me, dear friends.\n\n© Michael Q. Powell.

Using telephoto and macro lenses and a stealthy approach, I try to isolate the dragonflies, so that viewers can focus on the beautiful details of these amazing aerial acrobats.\n\nThe reality though, is that most dragonflies are quite small—this male Eastern Amberwing dragonfly (Perithemis tenera) is only about one inch (25 mm) in length—and they often fly about amidst vegetation that conceals their movements.\n\nThis image gives you a sense of the vastness of the environment and some of the challenges in spotting the dragonflies. Of course, the second challenge is getting close enough to the subject without scaring it away, though in this case I was content to capture a wide-angle shot that shows this dragonfly in its preferred environment.\n\n© Michael Q.
