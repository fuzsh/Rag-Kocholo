No bumping or wear; binding is tight and square, hinges are sound. Endpapers illustrated with map of Chay Blyth's Route; no names, writing or marks. Illustrated with wonderful photographs. 244 pages. Photo illustrated dust jacket is not price clipped, small chip at top rear spine corner, wear and short closed tears to spine ends; enclosed in new archival quality removable mylar cover. Although this book generally presents well, there is very slight water damage (a little rippling to front endpapers, water stain to blank back side of dust jacket). \"The most astounding passage under sail that has ever been made by one man alone.\" - The Times"
