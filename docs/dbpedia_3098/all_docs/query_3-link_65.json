        "text": "This essay elaborates a non-imperial concept of constructive agency, embedded within aspects of poststructuralist thought. For Deleuze and Foucault, the making of history is compelled from within the existing social fabric by the creative potential of the virtual, which persists in the actual forms that eventuate. While a theory of agency remains underdeveloped in their works, the overriding aim of this essay is to begin to draw out the concept of agency enabled by this notion of immanent causation and to suggest how this poststructuralist theory of agency might inform the effort of formerly colonising peoples to rethink their historically imperial modes of being and of social engagement, enabling performances of postcolonial sociability. Taken together, desire and power define the conditions and impetus for action; these are here considered as constructive forces in the actualisation of social forms. Unlike in the dialectical tradition, desire is not conceptualised in relation to lack and its aim is not the negation of difference; it is the constructive force bringing association, resulting in the creation of new complex bodies. Similarly, power is not conceptualised in relation to mastery, but in terms of constitutive force relations between bodies. One’s chosen practices of desire and power shape the nature of one’s relationships and the resulting complex social body.\n\nThis paper uncovers a colonial unconscious in Marcel Carné's Les Enfants du Paradis (1943–45) as it interrogates post-structuralist theories on myth, mythologies, love and mimesis, including writings by Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida and Jean-Luc Nancy. The paper argues that in Les Enfants du Paradis Marcel Carné startles his viewers with the most cinematic mode possible of a theatrical drama set in the Parisian Vaudeville of the 1840s, mixing myth with political connotations to a maximum degree, thus creating film language that works on multiple levels of signification simultaneously. Shot and produced during World War II and the infamous Vichy occupation of France, it is not farfetched to assume that Les Enfants du Paradis includes political allegories. But the film is more than just the sum of its political allusions, embodying a desire for decolonization as France disengages from World War II and involves itself deeper and deeper into the messy business of colonial violence in North Africa."
