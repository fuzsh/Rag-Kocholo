He went bankrupt and was forced to sell his back catalogue to Pathe.\n\nAn early setback had come when Melies planned to release A Trip To The Moon in America, only to find that Thomas Edison's representative Al Adabie had secretly copied a print of the film after bribing staff at a London cinema and had already released it in the US without permission - an early and particularly devastating case of film piracy.\n\nLater reduced to running a toy stall and selling sweets at Montparnasse train station in Paris (as depicted in Hugo), Melies became so embittered that he dug a hole in his garden, filled it with what remained of his priceless reels and memorabilia and burned it all.\n\nWhat was lost that dark day is almost too painful to think about.\n\nHowever, he did live long enough to see his films reassessed and acclaimed and to receive the Legion d'Honneur before finally passing away in 1938.\n\n27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018\n\nShow all 27\n\nAmazingly, a colour print of A Trip To The Moon was unearthed in a French barn in 2002 in which each frame had been meticulously hand-painted by a large female work force a century earlier.\n\nThe world greeted its restoration and re-release with the same excitement and anticipation of its premiere at a Paris fairground and the film continues to inspire affectionate parodies and homages in everything from the Smashing Pumpkins' video for \"Tonight, Tonight\" (1996) to Futurama (1999-2013) and The Mighty Boosh (2004-13).\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
