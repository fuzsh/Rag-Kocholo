        "text": "Details on Latest Discovery\n\nThe Vesuvius Challenge has announced the grand prize winners of its global AI contest to virtually unwrap a still-rolled carbonized papyrus scroll from the ancient city of Herculaneum.\n\nYoussef Nader, an Egyptian biorobotics graduate student in Berlin, led the winning team that also includes Luke Farritor, a 21-year-old SpaceX intern and college student from Nebraska, and Julian Schilliger, a robotics student from Zurich.\n\nFarritor won the Vesuvius Challenge “First Letters Prize” last October, and Youssef placed second. Schilliger was also a prior winner of three Vesuvius Challenge “progress prizes” for his work on the Volume Cartographer — the virtual unwrapping software developed by Brent Seales, a computer science professor at the University of Kentucky, and used in the contest.\n\n“The grand prize contestants have clearly demonstrated what our systematic experimental framework envisioned: that virtual unwrapping and AI techniques together can deliver substantial texts from within the still-rolled Herculaneum scrolls,” Seales said. “My hope is that all the Vesuvius Challenge contestants will consider the experience as a career-high moment. Their contributions, hard work and creativity have certainly catalyzed an exciting new phase of revelation and scholarship. The University of Kentucky team of researchers who built the software, collected the data, pioneered the science and formed the many varied collaborative partnerships required to enable this moment should also be immensely proud.”\n\nThe three will split the $700,000 grand prize for their winning entry, which reveals 15 partial columns of hidden text hidden within PHerc.Paris4. The scroll is one of several owned by the Institut de France.\n\nTo authenticate the findings, expert papyrologists assessed each letter shape. Those on the review committee represent the countries who currently possess scrolls from Herculaneum (England, France and Italy).\n\n“Papyrus scrolls can contain more than 200 columns of text, so we have to bear in mind that what we know about this text will be hugely increased by the next results of virtual unwrapping. That being said, we have the lucky opportunity to read the final columns of the scroll, where the author would often summarize the content of his work or introduce new topics that he would address in subsequent books of the same work,” Federica Nicolardi, assistant professor in papyrology at the Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, continued.\n\n“There is a clear discussion on pleasure, particularly on the fact that the availability of goods, such as food, does not affect the pleasure which they provide. It’s an interesting discussion that emphasizes a difference in quantity does not necessarily imply a difference in quality/value/pleasantness too.”\n\nIn March 2023, Seales (in partnership with EduceLab: A Digital Restoration Initiative, the Library of the Institut de France and founders of the Vesuvius Challenge) launched the global competition to combine the best minds and talent in AI, virtual unwrapping and papyrology to accelerate the discovery of texts hidden within the Herculaneum scrolls.\n\nThe original $200,000 prize offering expanded into a $1 million total prize —thanks to contributions from more than 30 individuals that ranged from $5,000- $450,000.\n\nSeales believes reading the entire collection of Herculaneum scrolls is not only possible, but will be the largest discovery from the ancient world to date.\n\n“Indeed, today in collaboration with the Vesuvius Challenge, the dream from 20 years ago has come to life in the form of a new, readable Herculaneum text,” Seales said. “The Epicureans had much to say about pleasure and pain, and even in this text, there is a discussion of how abundance and scarcity can affect our pleasure: do things that are scarce provide more pleasure than those things that are abundant? The question is interesting and apropos. Those of us who have worked to see the success of virtual unwrapping as applied to Herculaneum recognize this as a deeply gratifying moment that may be scarce but is tremendously satisfying.”\n\nA detailed timeline of the project can be found below. Additionally, for more information about the grand prize, visit Scrollprize.org.\n\nView the Grand Prize Announcement video on YouTube.\n\nIn March 2023, Seales — along with Silicon Valley investors — began leading a global competition to read the charred scrolls after demonstrating that an AI program can successfully extract letters and symbols from X-ray images of the unrolled papyri.\n\nAs part of the Vesuvius Challenge, Seales’ team released its software and thousands of 3D X-ray images of two rolled-up scrolls and three papyrus fragments.\n\nThe hope was that $1 million in prizes would encourage global researchers and scholars to build upon the AI technology and accelerate the decoding.\n\nNow, building upon Seales’ software, readable text has been revealed from deep within the still-closed Herculaneum scrolls — marking the first time the scrolls have been read in 2,000 years.\n\n“We have pursued the dream of reading this extremely challenging material from Herculaneum. We have now proven that it is possible. There a huge emotional component, which is powerful and inspiring.” Seales said. “Overcoming damage incurred during a 2,000-year span is no small challenge. But that’s what researchers do — we conquer the seemingly impossible.\"\n\nThe Greek word, πορφύραc, meaning “PURPLE,” is among the characters that have been extracted by Vesuvius Challenge contestants Luke Farritor and Youssef Nader. The text comes from a wrap of papyrus buried deep within the completely unopened, intact, carbonized scroll.\n\nTo authenticate the findings, expert papyrologists assessed each letter shape. Those on the review committee represent the countries who currently possess scrolls from Herculaneum (England, France and Italy).\n\n“We have three readable lines, containing up to ten readable letters. This presumably represents slightly more than half a line — as columns in Greek Papyri from Herculaneum usually include around 18-20 letters per line. It’s extremely exciting to be reading entire words, not just sequences of letters, from within a scroll,” Federica Nicolardi, assistant professor in papyrology at the Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,” explained. “This scroll has remained untouched for centuries — protecting its content in a state that we can imagine as completely free from gaps. The most unique feature of the Library of Herculaneum is, the preserved texts are entirely unknown from other sources. However, I’m confident we will soon be able to read more, understand the topic of the work, identify the scribe if already present in the collection and date the script.”\n\nYou can learn more about the Vesuvius Challenge discovery here.\n\nThe Reveal\n\nOn October 13, 2023, Brent Seales, a computer science professor at the University of Kentucky, (in partnership with EduceLab: A Digital Restoration Initiative, the Library of the Institut de France and founders of the Vesuvius Challenge) hosted a conference and livestream event at UK.\n\nTogether, they presented a monumental breakthrough — announcing an entire word has been read from part of the still-closed Herculaneum scrolls. Additionally, the technical approach Seales and his team developed was critical in the process to recover the writing.\n\n“These texts were written by human hands at a time when world religions were emergent, the Roman Empire still ruled and many parts of the world were unexplored,” Seales said. “Much of the writing from this period is lost. But today, the Herculaneum scrolls are unlost.”\n\nThe Greek characters, πορφύραc, revealed as meaning \"purple dye\" or \"clothes of purple,\" are among the multiple characters and lines of text that have been extracted by Vesuvius Challenge contestants Luke Farritor and Youssef Nader.\n\n“This is just incredibly exciting,” Farritor, a 21-year-old SpaceX intern, said. “The EduceLab team did a really great job of building a solid foundation for progress, especially for virtually unwrapping the scrolls. I was able to use their prior work, as well as the observations of other contestants, to build a machine learning detector to find these letters.”\n\nShortly after Farritor's revelation, Nader, an Egyptian biorobotics graduate student in Berlin, independently discovered the same word in the same area — with even clearer results. “It took me a few days to process this, because I couldn’t believe my eyes,” he added. “It was exhilarating — reading text we did not understand, but we knew was left to us by people thousands of years ago. It was like peeking through a time machine into the past.”\n\nThe image (seen above) depicting the text comes from a wrap of papyrus buried deep within the completely unopened, intact, carbonized scroll.\n\nTo authenticate the findings, expert papyrologists assessed each letter shape. Those on the review committee represent the countries who currently possess scrolls from Herculaneum (England, France and Italy).\n\nUpon seeing the images, many of them gasped in excitement.\n\n“It’s extremely exciting to be reading entire words, not just sequences of letters, from within a scroll,\" Federica Nicolardi, assistant professor in papyrology at the Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, continued. \"This scroll has remained untouched for centuries — protecting its content in a state that we can imagine as completely free from gaps. The most unique feature of the Library of Herculaneum is that the preserved texts are entirely unknown from other sources. However, I’m confident we will soon be able to read more, understand the topic of the work, identify the scribe if already present in the collection and date the script.”\n\nNicolardi also says, the word “purple” has not yet been read in the opened Herculaneum scrolls. \"Purple dye was highly sought-after in ancient Rome and was made from the glands of sea snails, so the term could refer to purple colour, robes, the rank of people who could afford the dye or even the molluscs,\" she continued. \"But more important than the individual word is reading anything at all. The advance gives us the possibility to recover the text of the entire scroll.\"\n\nHow Did We Get Here?\n\nTwo-decades ago, Seales dared to do the impossible.\n\nWhat followed was a long, and often arduous, journey to create an artificial intelligence (AI) program that could read the Herculaneum scrolls without ever physically opening them.\n\nIn March, Seales — along with Silicon Valley investors Nat Friedman (instigator and sponsor), Daniel Gross (sponsor) and JP Posma (project lead) — began leading a global competition to read the charred scrolls after he demonstrated an AI program can successfully extract letters and symbols from X-ray images of the unrolled papyri.\n\nAs part of the Vesuvius Challenge, Seales’ team released its software and thousands of 3D X-ray images of two rolled-up scrolls and three papyrus fragments.\n\nThe two unopened scrolls, belonging to the Institut de France in Paris, are among hundreds unearthed in the 1750s when excavations at the buried villa revealed an extravagant library of Epicurean philosophical text. They are believed to have belonged to a Roman statesman — possibly Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, the father-in-law of Julius Caesar.\n\nEven after being in the ground for 1,700 years, the carbonized papyri did not decay. Rather, they were entombed in the solid volcanic flow of mud, dirt, water and gasses, then desiccated by the heat, carbonized and preserved.\n\nThe hope was, and still is, that $1 million in prizes would encourage global researchers and scholars to build upon the AI technology and accelerate the decoding.\n\nTeams that enter the challenge are competing for a grand prize of $700,000 — awarded to the first to read four passages of text from the inner layers of the scrolls by the end of 2023. Progress prizes include $50,000 for accurately detecting ink on the papyri from the 3D X-ray scans.\n\n“What the challenge allowed us to do was to enlist more than a thousand research teams to work on a problem that would normally have about five people working on it,” Seales explained. “The competitive science aspect of this project is just fascinating.”\n\nNow, six months since the competition began, contestants Farritor and Nader have virtually unwrapped many layers of papyrus from within (including the one shown) by building upon Seales’ software. Farritor (first place) and Nader (second place) separately developed machine learning methods to reveal the ink within X-ray CT scans of the scroll — resulting in the same findings.\n\n“I was walking around at night and randomly checked my most recent code outputs on my phone,” Farritor said. “I didn't expect any substantial results, so when half a dozen letters appeared on my screen, I was completely overjoyed.”\n\nNader is continuing to build upon his models and has already discovered more lines of text, which is currently being reviewed by papyrologists. “I hope the revealed text will show just how fascinating and complex ancient civilizations were,” he said. “In learning more about them, we can also learn more about how we can make our world better.”\n\nFor their findings, Farritor and Nader have been given the “First Letters Prize,” which awards $40,000 to the first person or team to find more than 10 letters in a continuous region of the scroll and $10,000 to the second. You can learn more about the award criteria here.\n\n“Our goal was to engage a global audience in an exciting, scientific competition that would create acceleration and advancement to the point where we are now,” Posma said. “The competition continues, but today, we have achieved a major milestone. We’ll learn a lot from this: what techniques work best, do we need to adjust how we do segmentation, etc.”\n\nThe competition’s results are impressive. But it’s also important to take a look back — to understand how this discovery came to be over the course of two decades.\n\n“We also acknowledge the many years of work that it has taken and the technological advances that have been applied to the problem of reading this material,” Seales said. “With humility, we acknowledge the non-linear — and often unpredictable — outcomes of research, which is rarely expected, and not ever guaranteed, to lead directly to success.”\n\nFrom Invisibility to Readability: A Timeline\n\n2002\n\nSeales and team created a system for “virtual unwrapping” from X-ray computed tomography and demonstrated it worked on examples that were built in the lab.\n\n2005\n\nAt a lecture in Oxford, Seales proposed that the still-closed Herculaneum scrolls could be read through noninvasive digital methods.\n\n2009\n\nSeales and his team traveled to the Institut de France to perform micro-CT scans of the Herculaneum scrolls. The study provided the first-ever volumetric images — exposing the challenges ahead due to the complexity of the internal structure.\n\n2013\n\nSeales worked as a Visiting Scientist at Google's Cultural Institute — beginning to scale up the effort to acquire more data and build new methods to handle the massive data sizes and the challenge of virtual unwrapping the tangled layers. During this time, he published results in the leading journal for Herculaneum research.\n\n2016\n\nSeales' team developed the Volume Cartographer, a revolutionary computer program for locating and mapping 2D surfaces within a 3D object. The software pipeline is used with micro-CT to generate extremely high-resolution images — enabling the ability to read a document without ever needing to physically open it.\n\nLater that year\n\nThe team used “virtual unwrapping” to read text from the ancient En-Gedi scroll — revealing it to be the beginning of the Book of Leviticus. It is believed to be one of the oldest Hebrew biblical texts ever found, outside of the Dead Seas Scrolls.\n\n2019 (March)\n\nSeales received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) targeted toward developing the AI algorithms for detecting and amplifying the evidence of the carbon-based ink from deep within the folds of the scrolls.\n\n2019 (early May)\n\nHerculaneum ink is different from that used to pen ancient Hebrew and medieval documents. It's made of carbon, which is invisible to the human eye in micro-CT images.\n\nTo address this problem, the team developed a neural network that \"learns\" how patterns in the data look when ink is present — as opposed to how patterns appear when no ink is present. A machine learning algorithm is trained to detect and recognize the unique ink. The teams’ groundbreaking work in this area was featured in a PLOS ONE article.\n\n2019 (late May)\n\nSeales receives a $2 million grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation — giving the team the materials access, funding support and technical approach needed to solve the 2,000-year-old mystery.\n\nThe prestigious Mellon grant supported the electronic compilation and dissemination of the entire Herculaneum collection, which was spread across four different institutions: the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, the British Library, the Institut de France and the Biblioteca Nazoinale di Napoli.\n\n2021\n\nUK announced a $14 million mid-scale infrastructure grant from the National Science Foundation to build EduceLab. Seales gathered a team of experts from the Stanley and Karen Pigman College of Engineering and the UK College of Arts and Sciences for this collaborative user facility focused on developing innovative AI solutions for heritage science.\n\n2023 (March)\n\nIn March, a global competition was launched to read the charred scrolls after demonstrating that AI can successfully extract letters and symbols from X-ray images of the unrolled papyri. As part of the Vesuvius Challenge, Seales’ team released its software and thousands of 3D X-ray images of two rolled-up scrolls and three papyrus fragments. The hope was that $1 million in prizes would encourage global researchers and scholars to build upon the AI technology and accelerate the decoding of the only intact library to survive from ancient times.\n\n2023 (August)\n\nStephen Parsons, a member of the research team, defended a comprehensive Ph.D. thesis describing the successful AI-inspired techniques and the systematic, scientific basis for the results that are now emerging.\n\nToday\n\nThe technical framework, accelerated by contestants participating in the Vesuvius Challenge, has succeeded. The “virtual unwrapping” has been applied to the Herculaneum scrolls — revealing Greek writing from deep within. The text is readable by the world’s eminent papyrologists (scholars who read the ancient, extant papyrological record), which is verification the technique works."
