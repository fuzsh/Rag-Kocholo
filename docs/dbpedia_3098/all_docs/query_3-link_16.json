        "meta_description": "This article discusses archival and memorial work in the poetry collection Voyage of the Sable Venus by Robin Coste Lewis. I track Lewis’s experimental poetic strategies to confront and unsettle archival silences and erasures when it comes to Black female bodies in the archive of Transatlantic slavery. These strategies resonate with Christina Sharpe’s wake work and Saidiya Hartman’s discussion of an ethical engagement with the archive. By striving to individuate the figure of the Black woman in history, and by predicating memorial work on a collective engagement with the past, Lewis paves the way for a radically new articulation of Black womanhood that shatters and goes beyond the hold of the archive.",

In short, I mean wake work to be a mode of inhabiting and rupturing this episteme with our known lived and un/imaginable lives” [32]. This echoes what Saidiya Hartman looks for in narrative, asking what stories can afford : “A way of living in the world in the aftermath of catastrophe and devastation ? A home in the world for the mutilated and violated self ?” [3].\n\n4How does one find relief from oppression ? Specifically, how does one find relief from historical oppression that has ramified and persisted into the present, overtaking and excluding one from the very definition of humanity ? Relief from perpetual mourning, which Claudia Rankine calls the condition of Black life in the United States ? When the archive persists in denying one’s humanity and in rooting one’s existence in death, how does one respond to the archive and provide relief for oneself and for others caught in the wake ? Through their attention to the possibilities writing (narrative and poetry) offers, Sharpe and Hartman both make it clear that the question is not just who/what gets represented but also how : confronting the archive(s) means accepting that horror has completely permeated quotidian life in the United States. This, in turn, means developing an ethics of seeing [Sharpe 132] that affects the very poetics of the text.\n\n5Voyage of the Sable Venus, the collection, confronts and reconfigures memorial work, both in its intimate dimension, through the experiences of the poetic subject and her family, and in its public, archival dimension, through its engagement with the texts and discourses produced by and around Western art. Thus Lewis highlights the collusion between art and power in the specific context of Black womanhood as it was created, shaped, exhibited, and reified in the West. Voyage of the Sable Venus locates the traumas of the past and the present through a transhistorical perspective and questions the possibilities of representation in the wake of trauma, performing one potential answer to Hartman’s burning question : “how does one rewrite the chronicle of a death foretold and anticipated, as a collective biography of dead subjects, as a counter-history of the human, as the practice of freedom ?” [3].\n\nThe Silent Colonial Archive(s) of Slavery\n\n11Slavery, like most historical cases when a minoritized group is methodically erased from or minimized within the national narrative, is characterized by archival silence and confusion. As Nancy Peterson pointed out, it then becomes all too easy, through post-structuralist theory, to consider that “history is only a text, a narrative construction of the past that has little or no relation to what really happened” [1]. Lewis re-embeds this narrative construction into materiality : many poems are ekphrastic, based on photographs that are not included in order to mimic the intentional lacunas of the archive(s). The material referent is there and not-there ; the dual dynamic of presence and absence parallels the very constitution of the archive(s), which hinges on acknowledging what is there and what is not. Archival excavation must also be tethered to the materiality of the body : “Perhaps the true museum, the most honest archive—the eternal exhibit—occurs and reoccurs within our own bodies” [150]. The archive(s) is intimate before anything else : forgetting this means re-erasing trauma.\n\nConfronting and Unsettling the Archive(s)\n\n12How does one go about confronting and finding relief from an archive(s) that explicitly hinges on a colonial project of domination and that is structured by silence and omission ? Can anything be said in the face of this silence ? Hartman explored this question, and Lewis asks it again in her epilogue : “It was an exercise in the redemptive power of silence. The art challenged me to stop speaking”, adding later on, “What more was there to say ? What could possibly be said ?” [149-150]. Archival silence can be hegemonic (as in, intentional obliteration). But it can also result from the observation that the archives speak for themselves, that these silences are crowded with the rustling and communication of what can never have a proper voice : “The paintings talked to each other” [149]. Silence must be reclaimed, and that is the first step in unsettling the archive(s) : knowing that “the archeological act of writing” will always fall short of what is there [157].\n\nthe wake and wake work trouble the ways most museums and memorials take up trauma and memory. That is, if museums and memorials materialize a kind of reparation (repair) and enact their own pedagogies as they position visitors to have a particular experience or set of experiences about an event that is seen to be past, how does one memorialize chattel slavery and its afterlives, which are unfolding still? How do we memorialize an event that is still ongoing? [...] Because how does one memorialize the everyday? [34].\n\n14This last question animates the entire project of the collection, which unsettles the legitimizing and authoritative aspects conventionally ascribed to the archives by centering the ways in which the latter can become a site of (re)invention and speculation. One such intervention by the poet appears not in a poem but in the prologue to “Voyage of the Sable Venus”, where she notes that in an effort to correspond to current ideological evolutions, curators and museums tend to obfuscate past traumas by changing words :\n\nI realized that museums and libraries (in what I imagine must have been either a hard-won gesture of goodwill, or in order not to appear irrelevant) had removed many nineteenth-century historically-specific markers—such as slave, colored, or Negro—from their titles or archives, and replaced these words instead with the sanitized, but perhaps equally vapid, African-American. In order to replace this historical erasure of slavery (however well intended), I re-erased the postmodern African-American, then changed all those titles back. That is, I re-corrected the corrected horror in order to allow that original horror to stand. My intent was to explore and record not only the history of human thought, but also how normative and complicit artists, curators, and art institutions have been in participating in—if not creating—this history [35].\n\n15“Correcting” the register was not enough to repair trauma insofar as it was mainly done for the comfort of the dominant class : it reduced to a textual subterfuge the trauma of words used to categorize and reify humans. The “re-correction” identifies and does not let us ignore the initial horror.\n\n16In “Catalog 3 : The Womb of Christianity,” sections XII and XIII mainly consist of anaphoric lists centered on the image of the Virgin Mary. Section XII hinges on the various attributes of “Our Lady” : “of Presentation”, “of the Confession”, until the very end : “Our Black Virgin / of Recollection” [67-68]. Section XIII hinges on place, starting with “—of Vladimir —de Lourdes —de Guadalupe— / Nossa—Nuestra—Notre—Nera—” [69]. The list frequently mentions “Black Madonnas,” closing with “Black Mary Magdalene of Palestine / Black Madonna Czestochowa, Queen of Poland” [70]. With these lists, along with the destabilizing of temporality through the ordering the various catalogs, Lewis reorganizes the archive, disrupts its usual teleology and staging how the trauma of slavery is not and cannot be relegated to the past. The very last poem in “Voyage of the Sable Venus” makes up the entirety of the final catalog, “Catalog 8 : The Present / Our Town.” It is relatively short and sparse :\n\nStill :\n\nLife\n\n(of Flowers)\n\nwith Figures—\n\nincluding\n\na Negro servant [110].\n\n17The use of outdated racial/racist vocabulary is a jarring anachronism ; the rest of the poem seems to reenact a scene of subjugation : the Black figure is a servant located within a still life, therefore silent and immobile. The violence of the original archive(s) of slavery is ceaselessly borne back into the present.\n\n18This confrontation with the archive(s) is not restricted to the second section. Poems in the first section are written around photographs or excerpts from speeches, glossing oft-overlooked archival remnants of the past. Two poems in the first section, “From : / To :” and “Beauty’s Nest,” which follow each other, gloss on two photographs that crystallize the irony of racial relations in the era of WW2 : first Black American soldiers who were fighting in Europe and wrote “FROM HARLEM TO HITLER” on the shell of a bomb ; then Black American soldiers who return from the war to segregation and Jim Crow laws. The soldiers are the immediate descendants of those who were dispossessed of their freedom and humanity and who survived the apocalypse of the Middle Passage ; they fight for freedom and against genocide on another continent, only to return home to a system that methodically disenfranchises them. Once again, forcing open the archive(s) reveals how trauma cannot be contained in the past.\n\n19Another mode of unsettling the archive(s) is by queering it, a project made explicit in the prologue : “I also included work by black queer artists, regardless of gender, because this body of work has made consistently some of the richest, most elegant, least pretentious contributions to Western art interrogations of gender and race” [35]. Thus queer influence may only appear implicit at first, since only a few titles can be traced back to queer artists (most of them occurring in section XXII). However, it is not simply the content of Voyage of the Sable Venus that is queered, but also the very methodology deployed by Lewis to engage with these archives. Jamie A. Lee has argued for the possibilities queer/ed methodologies open up when interacting with archives and oral histories, and articulated the concept of (un)becoming, “the simultaneous becoming and unbecoming” (5), in order to discuss the imaginative possibilities enacted by this constant movement within and throughout the archive(s).\n\n20Lewis enacts several strategies, some of which she lays out explicitly in her prologue and epilogue, that push back against normativizing narratives and bring to light the (un)becoming inherent in Blackness. She removes the authoritative framework by removing the (authorial) source, the consequences of which are twofold. First, she prevents whiteness and white artists from laying any further claim to the representations of Blackness it generated, and situating Black artists within an intertextual, transhistorical net of resonances that can serve to build heritage and legacy. Second, she also blurs what can be traced and verified (regarded as fact) and what cannot (classified as fiction) : the archive(s) can no longer be recuperated as a site producing a straightforward, univocal narrative of the past. Lewis also foregrounds community histories marked by orality, depicting the complexity of the odyssey of Black childhood in Southern California in “Frame” or highlighting in “Second Line” the kinship between her father, a WW2 veteran, and herself, and what her father gifted her — “this deep black joy” [128]. The latter arrives toward the end of the collection, yet another moment of relief, a defiant gesture toward rooting Blackness in something else than death. Thus, unsettling the archive(s) and finding relief from it also convey the project of restoring some form of (un)becoming subjecthood to the central figures : the Black women, the Venuses and the Madonnas.\n\n“Just the Sable Venus and me” : Individuating the Venus\n\n21The abundance of “Anonymous” and “Untitled” in the second section, along with the recurring use of anaphoras, is the direct materialization of what Lewis calls the “female namelessness” [149] and what Sharpe calls the “ditto ditto” of the archive of slavery. Names, these most immediate markers of identity, have been lost, often on purpose as humans were reduced to a number and a set of characteristics to be then more easily transformed into property. Voyage of the Sable Venus exposes this, acknowledging and integrating within the very fabric of the poems what Hartman observed when she tries to trace back the stories of the “Venus” : “Variously named Harriot, Phibba, Sara, Joanna, Rachel, Linda, and Sally, she is found everywhere in the Atlantic world” and everywhere “she is called Venus. // What else is there to know ? Hers is the same fate as every other Black Venus : no one remembered her name or recorded the things she said, or observed that she refused to say anything at all” [1-2].\n\n25There are hundreds of thousands of other girls who share her circumstances and these circumstances have generated few stories. And the stories that exist are not about them, but rather about the violence, excess, mendacity, and reason that seized hold of their lives, transformed them into commodities and corpses, and identified them with names tossed-off as insults and crass jokes. The archive is, in this case, a death sentence, a tomb, a display of the violated body, an inventory of property, a medical treatise on gonorrhea, a few lines about a whore’s life, an asterisk in the grand narrative of history [2].\n\n26From death sentence and tomb, Lewis forces the archive(s) open to render the Venuses sacred and have the asterisk take up the entire narrative.\n\n27The first and third parts seemingly engage autobiographical subject formation more explicitly, but Lewis reminds us of the risks of assigning an autobiographical referent to the poetic ‘I’ : “perhaps Voyage is a kind of autobiography, an autobiography without an I. [...] Or Voyage is an autobiography where the I isn’t significant, isn’t the protagonist” [151]. Indeed, the opening poem, “Plantation,” immediately prevents us from assigning any clear referents to pronouns ‘I,’ ‘you,’ and ‘we.’ The ‘you’ is particularly unstable, slipping in and out of various identities : “Every now and then you’d change / from a prancing black buck / into a small high yellow girl” to then become “the girl’s mother” (3). This slippage in turn affects the ‘I,’ whose true nature remains elusive, predicated on indeterminacy. While “On the Road to Sri Bhuvaneshwari” seems to be rooted in a real-life experience the poet had while traveling in India, the ensuing epiphany highlights the metamorphosis of the self, its multiple and contradictory iterations, rather than any stable, cohesive entity : “I was pregnant. / I was dead. / I was a fetus. / I was just born” [14].\n\n28Other poems in the first and third parts are ekphrastic or persona poems. “The Wilde Woman of Aiken” gives a voice to a black woman whom J. A. Palmer photographed as part of “a satirical photo shoot” [161]. Deriding Oscar Wilde’s idea that anything could be beautiful, Palmer chose and staged “objects he found to be inherently repugnant : highly patterned fabrics, an ornately upholstered chair, a sunflower, and a face vessel, and a black woman” [161]. The poem opens with “I am not supposed to be / beautiful” [17] and ends with “You / cannot / prevent me” [18] : the woman acknowledges her dispossession but pushes back against objectification, signaling she exists in excess of what white supremacy considers her to be. Affirming her humanity in a system that actively works to deny it at every turn enacts a form of individuation, which remains limited here since these are not really the words spoken by the woman but those imagined by Lewis. However, this ventriloquism also multiplies the possibilities of identification and individuation, since it is predicated on a Black woman reimagining another Black woman into being across history.\n\n“We want your company” : Collective Memory and Experimental Poetics\n\n32Questions of collectivity and lineage are abundantly interrogated in Black women’s writings, as numerous scholars such as Hortense Spillers and Cheryl A. Wall have pointed out. Spillers defined tradition as “a matrix of discontinuities” for the black women’s writing community [251]. In Worrying the Line, Wall calls upon the works of Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, and Alice Walker among others, to further explore the multifaceted function of kinship as something that must be both criticized and reclaimed through feminist, queer, and Black scholarship [12-13]. More recently, Sharpe’s wake work attends to the wake, as aftermath, as disturbed flow, and as watch, vigil. As such, it requires communal memorial work, stemming from a collective that is not the unindividuated series of “dittos” crowding the ledgers of slavery, but a community oriented toward and predicated on care and justice : “we yet reimagine and transform spaces for and practices of an ethics of care (as in repair, maintenance, attention), an ethics of seeing, and of being in the wake as consciousness ; as a way of remembering and observance” [Sharpe 132].\n\n34The materiality of language and literature allows Lewis to eschew assigning final authority to the memorial work performed by the multiple subjects in the collection. The memory of the black women she has painstakingly untangled from the web of Western aesthetic discourse in which they are caught, cannot be solidified into a conventional discourse of memorialization ; otherwise it loses its radical emancipatory and imaginative potential. Lewis achieves this by rooting her poetics in experimentation : shifting pronouns ; preventing the reader from tracing the source of her citations and thus from constructing an authoritative framework in which historical discourse could be stabilized ; and integrating the dual dynamic of “redaction and annotation” [Sharpe 121].\n\n35Sharpe perceives “[r]edaction and annotation” as a new grammar of Blackness that locates the writers and artists she studies (NourbeSe Philip, Dionne Brand, Charles Gaines) in a movement “toward seeing and reading otherwise ; […] toward seeing something beyond a visuality that is, as Nicholas Mirzoeff (2011) argues, subtended by the logics of the administered plantation” [121]. In this respect, Voyage of the Sable Venus is a project of redaction and annotation that allows Black womanhood to live and be seen/represented in excess of what has been captured and recorded in the archive(s). The second section is most visibly associated with redaction : it wrenches the texts from their context so that we are unable, for the most part, to locate the art objects to which they refer. Only the more modern works, with distinctive titles, can eventually turn up in a search, but Lewis integrates them all within a text that has transformed their original grammatical structure : “No title could be broken or changed in any way. While the grammar is completely modified—I erased all periods, commas, semicolons—each title was left as published, and was not syntactically annotated, edited, or fragmented” [35]. This results in a disarticulation from the referential framework and a disruption of expectations, most visible when the poems consist of anaphoric lists, as with sections in “Catalog 3” and “Catalog 7.” Section XIII, in particular, contains a striking line : “Nossa—Nuestra—Notre—Nera—” [69]. The homophonic proximity of the first three words, meaning “our,” and the last one, meaning “black” (gendered as female), is another subtle gesture toward the need for a collective reappropriation of Blackness.\n\n36The first section of “Catalog 4 : Medieval Colonial” also exemplifies this process by using line breaks to constantly shift our way of seeing. Opening with “Alabama Sketchbook,” the poem starts with an ekphrasis of a seated Black woman drawing :\n\nhalf-length image\n\nof a Young Negro Woman\n\nwearing a Dress with an Empire.\n\nWaistline and pear,\n\nearrings and necklace [71]\n\n37This act of inserting a full-stop where there was none, and thus of opening up a title that contained the Black body it described within a certain form of violence to new imaginings, occurs several more times in the poem, signifying a quasi-ontological shift : “Negro Man strapped to a ladder, Being. / Lashed” or “Negro Man at right, Being. / Held by the collar” [72]. The full-stop and the line break after Being force a pause to reflect on this sudden image of a Black man in a state that slavery negated : just “Being.” What follows then reasserts the full force of the violence perpetrated on the Black body, but this pause (this small relief) creates an aperture in the representation and in the archive, an opening through which could be articulated another vision of Blackness.\n\n38The first and third parts, in turn, perform annotation : they frame the core text and offer a more personal exploration of what Black womanhood, and Blackness in general, may be. We start within a position of intimacy (the very first poem, “Plantation,” articulates the complex grammar of race, gender, and sexuality), move toward the disembodiment generated by Lewis’s specific treatment of the archive(s), and back into the intimacy of personal trauma, sensual and religious experiences, and the lacunas of family trees. The closing poem, “Félicité,” reflects on the lineage of the poetic subject who confronts a truth she has long sought to avoid (and to avoid uttering) by any means possible : “The black side of my family / owned slaves” [133].\n\n40Each poem of the collection also performs, internally, the dual dynamic of redaction and annotation. For example, “Lure” opens with “I was not there” and closes with “any longer.” Its long middle section consists of one long parenthesis, which runs across several indented stanzas, where every sentence is negative. “Lure” recounts one episode of sexual assault the subject had to endure as a young girl, at home, at the hands of an older male relative. The grammar of the poem keeps insisting it did not happen, seemingly redacting the event from memory ; yet the lengthy parenthesis, itself an additive punctuation mark, accumulates the details of the non-event and materializes the dissociative state of mind the subject finds herself in, both as a child and as an adult remembering the event. The poem is an exercise in how traumatized memory works : negating yet reaffirming the event, through syntactic detours and subterfuges. It also conjures other figures — the grandmother, working on her sewing in another room ; the mother and the father who were outside the house at the time — and the mother in particular who is also a victim of sexual abuse by the rapist referred to as ‘you’. This constellation of figures is needed for the subject to identify the pain and violence she suffered and to confront the memory — and the ongoing trauma it created.\n\n41In the first section, “verga :” takes a quote from a Kenyan refugee : “...women don’t want the men to go into the bush because the women will only be raped but the men will be killed...I have seen a woman who was caught in the bush by several men. They tied her legs to two trees while she was standing. They raped her many times and before leaving her they put stones in her vagina...” [16]. The poem then dismembers and recomposes the grammar and the vocabulary in fourteen lines that make sense grammatically but not semantically to illustrate the absurdity of the sheer violence deployed against Black women : “Before leaving her they put stones in her vagina / The men will only be raped but the stones will be killed / The bush caught many men to go into the stones” [16]. The word “woman” never appears throughout the poem : her absence (her redaction) from the text repeats the erasure perpetrated by sexual violence in the original quote, since rape, predicated on power, seeks to annihilate the selfhood of the victim. In parallel, the Oulipian-like reconfiguration of the initial quote acts as annotation on this violence, and the use of the sonnet form highlights the tension between a set formal structure and the impossible containment of the violence, as it is linguistic, physical, and systemic. The poem speaks to the specific forms of violence occasioned by forced displacement, war, and sexual domination ; the abundance of plural nouns points to the need for an understanding of how this violence is perpetrated and could be resolved collectively.\n\n42The dual experimental dynamic of annotation/redaction activates here a personal reckoning, with the poetic subject tackling the complexities, lacunas, aporias, and permanent silences of her family archive(s), and paves the way for a collective form of memorial work by bringing in other members of the subject’s community to confront and explore the familial and communal heritages. Archives have obvious limits ; one individual cannot alone recover what is missing in order to recover and repair historical memory : this is where the collective reckoning of memory must intervene, since it brings in a multiplicity of voices running counter to the univocal, hegemonic narrative of nation and self. In turn, “[t]his investment in the text, then, creates the possibility of transferring historical memory to a community of readers, a community with the potential to construct and nurture collective memory” [Peterson 14]. Lewis makes this transmission from writer to reader manifest, stating “we want your company” in her epilogue [157] : the poems enact a form of collective memorial work as a blueprint for their readers to translate it into the present of the wake.\n\nConclusion\n\n44Nancy Peterson highlighted the crucial role of literature in confronting the silences of the archive(s) because, unlike history, it hinges on “imaginative speculation”, and thus is “essential, if not to restore the record through speculation, to mark the spaces, gaps, aporias that cannot be filled” [9]. Saidiya Hartman goes further and interrogates the ethical concerns behind reconstructing a narrative or a poetics out of the archive : “How does one revisit the scene of subjection without replicating the grammar of violence ?” [4]. She concludes by stating : “We begin the story again, as always, in the wake of her disappearance and with the wild hope that our efforts can return her to the world”, even when we must accept “the ongoing, unfinished and provisional character of this effort, particularly when the arrangements of power occlude the very object that we desire to rescue” [14].\n\n45We find the strongest materialization of this process in Black women’s writings, which tackle the archive(s) of slavery in order to reclaim the process of reparation for themselves. The archives to which they turn are of various and often intersecting natures : legal records (as in NourbeSe Philip’s Zong !), science-fiction and speculative literature (as with Pauline Alexis Gumbs’s M Archive), or aesthetic, as with Lewis. And yet, all these archives yield one common conclusion : excavating, resisting, and disrupting them implies a radical refashioning of identity and temporality. Only by confronting and disrupting these archives can the writers “imagine a free state, not as the time before captivity or slavery, but rather as the anticipated future of this writing” (Hartman 4). “Art hurts. Art urges voyages—” : Voyage of the Sable Venus’s own art reclaims and urges voyages of another kind — into the depths of historical and ongoing trauma, into the violence wrought upon Black women’s bodies, and out onto wholly new shores that writers such as Robin Coste Lewis are imagining into existence."
