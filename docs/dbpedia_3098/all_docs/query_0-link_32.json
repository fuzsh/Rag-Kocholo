The affection between her\n\nand her \"old black mammy\" was very\n\ntender, and the separation was hard\n\nto bear. After the young wife had set\n\ntled in the East she determined to\n\nhave \"mammy\" come on to visit her,\n\nand sent the money for her ticket.\n\nImagine the surprise of the prim\n\nNew Yorkers when they saw an old\n\ncolored woman coming through the\n\nstation gate suddenly pounced upon\n\nby an elegantly dressed lady, who\n\nthrew her arms around the old\n\nwoman's neck and kissed her time\n\nand again. Dropping her bundles, the\n\nold woman seated herself on a truck,\n\nand, drawing the lady upon her lap,\n\ntenderly stroked her hair and ex\n\nclaimed :\n\n\"My God, my baby! I'se so glad to\n\nsee you, honey.\"\n\nTo her the fine lady was only the lit\n\ntle girl, whom she had tenderly nursed\n\nin sickness and in health and on whom\n\nshe had lavished all the love of her\n\nsimple heart.

High-pitched, stri\n\ndent voices are sharply criticised, and\n\nit is quite within our power to change\n\nthem.\n\nIn the compass of every voice there\n\nare three registers the middle or\n\nthroat, the lower or chest, and the\n\nupper or head. The use of the middle\n\npitch for talking is very desirable, but\n\nthe voice should be trained to slide up\n\nand down, varying with the emotions\n\nlow when the mood inclines toward\n\nseriousness, and higher when it be\n\ncomes tingled with excitement. An\n\ninteresting speaker constantly changes\n\nhis pitch not abruptly, but with ease\n\nand skill and the greater range one\n\nhas the more certain he is to get and\n\nretain the pleased attention of listen\n\ners.\n\nHobbies of Holland's Queen.\n\nThe queen of Holland is an enthusl\n\nastic farmer.

Dis\n\nraeli, whom he had described as a\n\nmountebank dancing upon John\n\nBull's stomach, offered Carlyle a\n\nbaronetcy, and elicited from him, to\n\ngether with a refusal of the title,\n\nmany tributes to his magnanimity.\n\nHe said very little about Disraeli\n\nhenceforth in print, and In private he\n\nspoke of him only as \"a very tragical\n\ncomical fellow.\" London Chronicle.\n\nDO WE EAT TOO MUCH?\n\nPhysiologists say that the Japa\n\nnese present the most perfect phy\n\nsique of any race In the world. Most\n\nof the diseases common to the Occi\n\ndent are unknown among the sub\n\njects of the Mikado, and this happy\n\ncondition they themselves attribute\n\nto the fact that they eat sparingly\n\nand only of plain, nourishing food.

Boston Globe.\n\nOUR BAD COLLEGE SPELLING.\n\nMuch is said in the papers about\n\ncollege English. The people within\n\nand without college walls declare\n\nthat students write badly. But there\n\nis a thing more fundamental than\n\ntheir poor English style; it is the mat\n\nter of their spelling. Many college\n\nmen, as proved by their essays, can\n\nnot spell. They frequently make the\n\nmistake of transforming writing Into\n\nwritting, and of dining into dinning\n\nan echo probably of the noise of a col\n\nlege dining-room.\n\nBut poor spelling is not confined to\n\ncollege students. College professors\n\nare not free from the blame. A let\n\nter lies before the writer in which the\n\ndistinguished head of a most import\n\nant department in an American col\n\nlege declares that a certain candidate,\n\nwhom he has recommended as \"com\n\npetant.\" A New England college pro\n\nfessor has recently said that in mak\n\ning applications for a place in - Eng\n\nlish several candidates wrote of the\n\nsalery. Of course, also, a man may\n\nlack culture and spell correctly. Spell\n\ning is more or less a matter of an ar\n\nbitrary bit of knowledge. But what\n\never may be the psychological rela\n\ntions of the art, the schools should\n\nteach boys and girls to spell. By in\n\ncorrect spelling the higher ranges of\n\nlearning are rendered less impressive.\n\nLeslie's Weekly.\n\nCURBING LAWYER'S VERBOSITY.\n\nThe supreme court of Pennsyl\n\nvania, in an opinion just sent to\n\nSchuylkill county, notifies the law\n\nyers that they can profitably edit\n\ntheir too verbose arguments. The\n\ncourt warns attorneys that, the\n\ncourt's judgment of the importance of\n\na case is not at all influenced by the\n\nenormous size of the paper books\n\nsubmitted to it. Tis a warning per\n\ntinent wherever law is practiced. The\n\ninfinitude of words which the law\n\nsanctions, if it does not require, as\n\nlawyers so often insist, is a source of\n\ninfinite weariness to laymen.
