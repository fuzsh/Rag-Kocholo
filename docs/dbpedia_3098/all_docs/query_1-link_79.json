        "text": "One of the few benefits to being colorblind* ‚Äì and there aren't really a whole lot of benefits to being colorblind ‚Äì is that I'm pretty much given free rein to stylize, shoot, and then Photoshop images in the way that best strikes my fancy. And, more often then not, this simply means that I shoot in black and white. I can't do proper color corrections ‚Äì I'm VERY red-green colorblind ‚Äì and so it's usually best if I approach a photo shoot with the intent of converting most (if not all) of my pictures to monochrome. In terms of the actual benefits... Well, again, I have free rein to do pretty much whatever I want from a stylistic standpoint. Case in point: the photo you see below. In this picture, you see a Psilocybe natalensis mushroom that I photographed earlier in the week, knowing that I would end up doing a high-contrast, black and white conversion of it. The mushroom was illuminated with light coming in from a north-facing window. In Photoshop, I isolated the green channel, desaturated it, and then applied a heavy contrast curve to make everything \"pop.\" The background was a piece of white construction paper ‚Äì set about a foot below the mushroom ‚Äì and also illuminated with the light coming in from a north-facing window. I used the \"healing brush\" tool in Photoshop to clean up a few pieces of dirt that had fallen on the paper, though otherwise, what you see here is pretty much what was on my screen after applying a contrast curve. Not. Too. Shabby. * Yes. It's weird being a colorblind photographer. I get asked a LOT of questions about it. Some of which I simply can't answer because... I don't know the answer.\n\nImages add life to your designs yet finding the right images can be hectic.

A thumbnail is a small image representation of a larger image, usually intended to make it easier and faster to look at or manage a group of larger images. Graphic designers and photographers typically use this term. For example, software that lets users manage multiple images often provides a miniaturized version of each image so that they don't have to remember the file name of each image. A thumbnail also means a small and approximate version of a full-size image or brochure layout as a preliminary design step. This is also referred to as a preview image and is a smaller version of the original image. #graphicdesign #design #art #graphicdesigner #illustration #branding #logo #designer #graphic #digitalart #photoshop #artwork #illustrator #creative #artist #logodesigner #graphics #typography #marketing #photography #drawing #logodesign #dise #webdesign #designinspiration #brand #adobe #logodesigns #d #digitalmarketing"
