First impressions count!\n\nIf you don’t have professional-looking artwork, it becomes nearly impossible for your title to get selected or perform well.\n\nConsider your own behavior when deciding what to watch. Does your artwork resemble a title you would want to watch?\n\nFor artwork requirements, please see our Artwork Requirements article.\n\nArtwork design best practices\n\nYour artwork is the single most important factor in getting viewers to watch your title.\n\nWe are living in an increasingly thumbnail-based world; you will want to make sure your artwork is recognizable and easy to understand, from iPhone to 85-inch TV, no matter the size of the screen.\n\nSome tips to keep in mind for designing great artwork:\n\nIs this something you would see on a premium streaming channel? Does it have a vibrant, distinctive, and consistent color scheme?\n\nNo ancillary text ****outside of the main title name. The title is the only text allowed on the artwork, no subtext, laurels, or billing blocks.\n\nToo much text obfuscates the title name and just looks noisy.\n\nDoes it have a stylish font and clean visual aesthetic?\n\nIs it too minimalist?\n\nFor example, a plain black poster with white text.\n\nDoes the subject of the image (i.e. main character, key objects, setting...) clearly communicate the genre and/or plot of the title?\n\nAre there any known actors in your film? If so, you should consider including them on the main poster, as it will help drive licensing and viewership.\n\nDo you get a sense of the narrative when looking at the poster, and is that narrative compelling?\n\nOverall, is the artwork something you would click on when scrolling a channel’s catalog – or can you imagine your intended audience clicking on it?\n\nWe understand that not everyone has access to professional graphic designers, which is why image creation is one of Filmhub's optional Professional Services.\n\nHere are some examples of artwork with before and afters:"
