        "text": "This blueprint revolutionised my sourdough baking and can transform yours, too.\n\nI started baking sourdough back in 2012 while working as an international private chef.\n\nDespite a successful career as a professional chef and investing a small fortune in \"speciality\" sourdough equipment...\n\n...I didn’t find baking sourdough easy and found myself consistently pulling flat, lifeless loaves from my oven.\n\nI was endlessly juggling complicated processes, which kept me up into the depths of the night.\n\nNo matter which recipe I followed, I was plagued with problems.\n\nI couldn’t get my sourdough starter to triple in volume (not what matters, BTW).\n\nMy dough was a nightmare to handle and stuck to everything in sight.\n\nI'd turn the dough out of the proofing basket (if it didn’t stick) and watch with dread as it spread across my worktop into a puddle.\n\nAfter hours of nursing my dough through the lengthy process… I was greeted by yet another flat, lifeless loaf.\n\nWhy didn’t my loaves look like the ones pictured in the recipes or on Instagram? Where was the iconic ear and honeycombed crumb every picture seemed to boast?\n\nI was ready to chuck in the towel and quit.\n\nBut I knew that if I could master sourdough, me and my family would reap the rewards.\n\nSo, I stuck with it, and fast-forward a few years, and I was consistently baking loaves that sprang beautifully in the oven.\n\nMy creativity went through the roof as I designed recipes using local seasonal produce and freshly milled flour.\n\nThe flavour of my homebaked sourdough was superior to anything I had tasted before.\n\nEven though I used the best quality ingredients, my loaves were drastically cheaper than buying from a bakery.\n\nI stopped thinking of bread as a simple sandwich casing and used it as an ingredient to create an array of amazing Mediterranean dishes.\n\nMy digestive health improved dramatically and I wasn't plagued by the bloating I'd experienced from overly processed packaged bread.\n\nBest of all, my family and friends were able to share in that experience. That gives me a great sense of well-being.\n\nI think it’s completely fair to say that sourdough has dramatically improved the way I live my life.\n\nAnd I believe that mastering the art of baking sourdough can improve yours too.\n\nSo, how do you overcome the same problems I experienced?\n\nAnd things can quickly get out of control...\n\nThe biggest problem is that recipes don't teach you how to troubleshoot when things inevitably go wrong.\n\nThe author can't teleport from the book (or the YouTube video) and explain why your loaf looks nothing like the one in their picture.\n\nThey can't explain why the dough (which looked so simple to handle in the video) has turned into a torturous, sticky glob.\n\nAnd they can't help you out when it’s one o'clock in the morning, and your dough still hasn't properly proofed.\n\nThat leaves you all alone.\n\nSo, how do you dissect the loaf, diagnose the issues, and know which parts of the (lengthy) process need to be adjusted?\n\nIt's like a giant puzzle.\n\nScratch that; it's like throwing several jigsaw puzzles up in the air and then trying to piece them back together blindfolded.\n\nThe bottom line is that you need to know how to problem-solve (evaluate, troubleshoot, and adjust). This is the number one skill every successful sourdough baker needs to develop.\n\nDozens of dials need to be tweaked...\n\nIf you try to figure this out on your own, remember this...\n\nStay focused because the process is lengthy. You must be comfortable picking yourself up when things go wrong, starting over and staying positive.\n\nI’m not saying it isn’t possible to figure this out alone. I did it.\n\nBut it may take several years of ripping your hair out and making mistakes before you can consistently take a loaf from idea to breadboard.\n\nThere are enough video tutorials and recipe books to keep you busy until the end of time. So, be sure to follow the right ones and avoid falling down the wrong rabbit holes.\n\nRecipe development is a process that the world's best bakeries, patisseries and restaurants use to create award-winning products.\n\nIf you need convincing… the next time you go into a decent bakery or restaurant, ask if they have a process for recipe development.\n\nIf Michelin-starred restaurants successfully use it, it's guaranteed to work wonders for you, the home baker.\n\nThe true secret to mastering sourdough is creating a recipe development blueprint.\n\nCreate a blueprint for generating your recipe ideas\n\nCreate a blueprint for designing your recipes\n\nCreate a blueprint for test baking (mixing, fermenting and baking)\n\nCreate a blueprint for tracking your baking\n\nCreate a blueprint for tasting and evaluating your sourdough\n\nCreate a blueprint for troubleshooting and adjusting\n\nAnd no, this doesn’t drain the creativity from baking. Instead, it enhances creativity, allowing you to focus on enjoyable, creative aspects.\n\nOnce created, you’ll have your own blueprint for designing recipes and baking loaves that rival those of the best bakeries in the world.\n\nYou still need to work hard because every recipe will have issues during development...\n\nBut now, you’ll be armed with a blueprint to systematically overcome the problems.\n\nI’ve created a unique recipe development blueprint for sourdough.\n\nIt uses the same core principles and systems I used throughout my professional career as a chef.\n\nLet me show you how to create your own in Sourdough Unchained.\n\nSourdough Unchained is an interactive coaching community where I teach you everything I’ve learned over the past 25+ years, developing recipes and 10+ years of baking sourdough.\n\nMavi, an Italian home baker, was about to quit sourdough when she contacted me in January 2021.\n\nWe used WhatsApp to share pictures and real-time advice. Mavi was back on track with her sourdough baking within a week and has never looked back.\n\nAfterwards, Mavi explained that the key to her success was the real-time help and the ability to share pictures and videos of the problems she was experiencing. (You can read her testimonial below).\n\nI knew it would be impossible to teach multiple home bakers using WhatsApp or email.\n\nThat’s when I decided to create Sourdough Unchained and centre it around real-time help and support, with the ability to share pictures and videos and host on-demand classes and livestreams.\n\nThis isn’t a course where you are left alone with little or no support.\n\nSourdough Unchained is an immersive, interactive coaching community where you’ll find me daily, answering questions and offering support and encouragement (along with our amazing members).\n\nSo, how do we do it?\n\n🎯 The sourdough system reboot\n\nA great recipe and an eagerness to learn are essential, but the harsh reality is that you’ll never succeed if you don’t get the basics right.\n\nThere are endless dials that need to be adjusted to align each stage of the process and bake a well-sprung loaf with an open ear and honeycombed crumb.\n\nThat's exactly what I've designed the Reboot System for, cutting out the fluff and focussing on the core principles of baking sourdough.\n\nAs you work through the reboot system, you can confidently detail your process using our sourdough tracker.\n\nUsing the sourdough tracker, I'll evaluate your recipe, ingredients, fermentation process and baking method to help you rapidly accelerate your learning curve and master the troubleshooting process firsthand.\n\nNo more scratching your head and wondering what’s gone wrong. You’ll get my clear actionable advice ready for your next baking session.\n\nThis has been the biggest driver for fixing our members' problems within the sourdough process and giving them a solid foundation for expanding their repertoire of recipes.\n\nPhil's sourdough unchained coaching completely changed the way I think of sourdough making. I used to put together all the ingredients and hope it turned out nicely.\n\nBut Phil helps me understand that it's more important to \"decide before start\". Sit down, do the research, have clear expectations in mind, and then act. In this way, you will have more control over the results. I used this method on the community challenge and created a recipe my family and I enjoyed.\n\nPhil's Sourdough Calculator makes recipe creation and tweaking so much easier!\n\nI enjoy keeping all the test bakes on record and comparing the results among different hydration and flour types. Thanks to the Sourdough Calculator, all my bakes are well-planned and organised now.\n\nI had been looking for sourdough-making guides on the internet. The results either lacked clear explanations or were too complex to follow through. Then I found Phil's Sourdough Unchained; the coaching videos answered most of my questions.\n\nI also got to ask him more questions in the live session, where he helped me design an original recipe involving rice flour.\n\n- Qin Zhou\n\nI'm proud to say that I've been a member of the Sourdough Unchained Community since the very beginning.\n\nDespite baking sourdough bread for more than ten years, my boundaries were limited, and there were always doubts about the ingredients and methods I was using and nobody to discuss them with.\n\nSince becoming a member, everything has changed. I am now a member of a community with a wide range of home bakers with differing levels of knowledge and experience, with members spread all over the World.\n\nWe share ideas and thoughts and offer help when necessary. Phil is always on hand to help out. He reacts quickly to messages and has organised one-to-one live sessions to help members out on more than one occasion.\n\nApart from gaining a lot of knowledge, experience and confidence, I've also gained great insight into how different cultures make sourdough bread using their local ingredients and in very different environments.\n\nI am sure that any future member of the Sourdough Unchained Community can profit in the same way.\n\n- Bryan E.\n\nI was contemplating whether I should join a coaching community when the web is overloaded with information, and I am glad I did.\n\nThe past three months have been so enjoyable and kept me more focused.\n\nDuring this period,I've learned how to manage my baking schedule better, adjust my ingredient temperature and hydration to bake in different climates, maintain a vibrant starter, recognise proper fermentation and proofing, and use the calculator to adjust and design recipes.\n\nI also gained a circle of sourdough-baking friends. I particularly like the monthly challenges, which expand our horizons. The discovery, experimental and implementation processes are stimulating.\n\nWhat a deep sense of accomplishment I had when I completed my Easter EGGstravagaza challenge, creating and baking my first-ever recipe.\n\nPhilip helps us to tackle different problems face to face during the live Q&A sessions. Thank you for sorting out my scoring issue. I very much appreciate those times when I cannot attend that recorded programs are available.\n\nThe Sourdough Lounge is the most popular, a place to interact, be inspired and build friendships. Philip’s comments are always encouraging and helpful to each one of us. Philip, you are an excellent coach.\n\nThank you for encouraging us to use our five senses, venture out of our comfort zones, and push our boundaries from fearful to fearless.\n\nI’m glad I can tag along in this sourdough journey, and eventually, I want to be able to master sourdough baking.\n\n- Becky T.\n\nJoining Culinary Exploration has helped advance my skills as a baker. The resources provided by the community have been very valuable in helping me scale my micro-bakery.\n\nFrom detailed tutorials to more advanced baking techniques, I’ve found lots of help that I needed to take my skills to the next level. The camaraderie and support from other bakers has been inspiring. The virtual community is great for sharing tips, troubleshooting problems, and celebrating successes.\n\nOne of the highlights of my experience has been interacting with Phil. His regular live-streams are full of practical advice and new ideas, and his personable nature makes the time invested enjoyable.\n\nThe 1-on-1 chats with Phil have been particularly valuable; his accessibility and genuine interest in my progress have boosted my confidence tremendously. Under his guidance, I've seen significant improvements in the quality of my baking and my confidence to experiment with new recipes, empowering me to grow.\n\nOverall, Culinary Exploration is a valuable membership for any baker seeking growth and excellence. The wealth of knowledge, along with the supportive community and Phil’s expert guidance, has greatly influenced my baking journey.\n\n- Jonathan S.\n\nInitially, I was apprehensive about joining the Sourdough Unchained Community, believing I wasn't good enough to join such experienced bakers. Oh boy, was I wrong?\n\nThe Community is incredibly supportive. They always share their experiences and guidance, nudging you gently in the right direction when you feel despondent and sharing in your happiness when your hard work comes to fruition!\n\nAny questions are answered in the community or during the monthly live stream, where Phil shares his knowledge during a deep dive into your bake.\n\nWhilst there are so many variables to understand when baking sourdough, Phil guides you through the Sourdough Reboot process so you can understand the issues you encounter, always encouraging and believing in you.\n\nHe doesn't tell you what to do, but through his experience, he encourages you to develop that Sourdough side of you that wants to bake a loaf of bread. Throw in the training classes and the Magnus recipe calculator, which is my go-to for every bake, and you will have the complete package.\n\nMy bakes have gone from puddles to standing proud on the chopping board!\n\nThanks to Phil and the Sourdough Unchained Community, I have developed a passion I never knew existed for flour, baking and, most of all, sourdough.\n\n- Mark N.\n\nI can confidently say Philip's sourdough bread recipes are the best I've ever tried.\n\nNot only because of the final result (which is not to be overlooked in the slightest) but also because of how kind he is in helping people approach the art of sourdough.\n\nIn January 2021, I had just gotten my starter going and was not even close to achieving the results I saw online, so I decided to send Philip a DM on Instagram.\n\nHe promptly sent me his phone number to help me better via WhatsApp and a lot of audio messages and pictures later; his advice is the best I've ever received so far in my journey.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I have now memorised his 30-minute sourdough bread recipe and process and religiously make it every other day with my trusty year and a half-old starter.\n\nThe aspect I enjoy the most from Sourdough Unchained is the fact that it's got the basis for anyone to pick sourdough baking up and make it their own.\n\n- Mavi M.\n\nFor years, I struggled with sourdough and began looking for solutions online.\n\nI discovered Philip’s YouTube channel and became interested in joining this group. I finally broke after an unsuccessful bake and joined the group.\n\nI was shocked at the level of baking expertise in the group. I was amazed and intimidated by some of these great bakers and their skills.\n\nSo, initially, I only read the posts and watched the videos without any interaction with other members of the group. I did not want to share my failures with a group of strangers (nobody wants to hear they have an ugly baby).\n\nAfter some time, Philip and I were messaging, and he encouraged me to share one of my unsuccessful bakes with the group. It was the best thing I could have done!\n\nThe members shared similar failures and offered measures they took to correct the issue. There was no judging, only support and advice. This global community rallied behind me to improve my bakes!\n\nThe live streams, the sourdough calculator, the monthly challenges, the video library, and the ability to get one-on-one advice from Philip are all well worth the investment.\n\nI have made friends with bakers from across the globe and learned to make my own recipes using Philip’s calculator.\n\nIn the past, I never had the confidence to bake a loaf for friends and family because I feared it would not turn out properly. I now have confidence, and I regularly take requests for loaves.\n\nThis is a great support group for struggling beginner sourdough bakers and a place for skilled bakers to exchange ideas and methods.\n\n- Kyle M.\n\nI’ve been baking sourdough bread for about 12 years now.\n\nIn the short time I’ve been with Sourdough Unchained, I’ve learned so much from Phil.\n\nWith his instruction my baking has reached a level I never expected possible so quickly.\n\nPhil’s systematic baking formula has really taken my baking to a level I never expected!\n\nNo more going down the rabbit hole on the internet for me!\n\nPhil has me developing my own recipes and has given me the ability to replicate them consistently.\n\nPhil shares his own wonder and joy in the process with infectious humour as he continues his own baking journey with us.\n\nMy experience here has me planning my next bake with excitement!\n\n- Jude S.\n\nI’m a relatively new baker. When I started, I was lucky and baked some very nice-looking sourdough loaves with excellent oven spring and ears.\n\nAnd then my luck ran out, baking a series of tasty, but not very aesthetically pleasing loaves. I had no idea what had changed, but knew I needed a reset.\n\nI found Phil’s Culinary Exploration YouTube channel and tried The Sourdough System Reboot.\n\nThat first bake was fantastic. Immediate success! Shifting to a firmer, lower-hydration dough resulted in great oven spring, a well-developed ear, excellent color, and crust – and tasty too!\n\nI quickly joined Phil’s Sourdough Unchained community, hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the baking process.\n\nWith Phil’s coaching and support from the Sourdough Unchained community, bakers are encouraged to experiment based on their own interests and skill levels.\n\nMy initial interest was understanding hydration and flour absorbency.\n\nWith Phil’s guidance and encouragement, I undertook a series of bakes, now called the hydration climb, to assess how well the bread flour I use absorbs water and my ability to work with wetter doughs.\n\nOver time, I’ve worked to incorporate flour blends using whole wheat or rye flours and design a recipe that produces extremely consistent results bake after bake after bake!\n\nMy thanks to Phil and the Sourdough Unchained community for providing a framework to record and evaluate bakes and useful advice for making improvements.\n\nAdopting this methodology provided the foundational structure I needed to really understand the sourdough baking process.\n\nIt still amazes me that with just a few simple ingredients and some creative mixing techniques, you can have delicious fresh-baked bread right out of the oven.\n\nMichael L.\n\nYour 100% Money Back Guarantee Promise\n\nAs you’ve heard in our member testimonials, Sourdough Unchained is the perfect solution for quickly taking your sourdough baking to the next level.
