Additive color theory involves combining red, green, and blue light to create a wide spectrum of colors. This method aligns with how digital screens work, using pixels to mix these colors. In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated this using colored filters to take monochrome photos that, when combined, produced a color image. You can learn more about these early experiments here.

Subtractive color theory uses cyan, magenta, and yellow pigments. This method is common in printing, where overlapping inks absorb certain wavelengths of light, leaving others to create the perceived color. Each pigment subtracts some light and reflects the rest, blending to form various hues.

The Role of Light-Sensitive Chemicals

Chemicals play a crucial role in capturing and reproducing color images. Photographic film and papers are coated with light-sensitive compounds that respond to exposure.

Silver halide crystals are key in traditional photography. When exposed to light, these crystals change chemically, capturing an image. In color film, multiple layers of these crystals are used, each sensitive to different parts of the spectrum.

Dyes and couplers work together to form the final image. During development, these chemicals react to create colored dyes within the film's layers. This intricate process ensures accurate color reproduction. For a detailed look at this process, see this article.
