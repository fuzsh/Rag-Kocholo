READ THE TRANSCRIPT.

What do you do when what you face seems impossible? This week we’re Off Balance On Purpose on Stone Mountain! Today’s question comes from Joel, who asks, “How do I approach seemingly impossible challenges?” And I like it, because we’ve all had moments when the obstacle, or journey before you, seems so enormous. You’re overwhelmed and simply don’t know where to start.

First off. Is it really impossible? Most likely not. But I’m not one of those guys who says that “anything is possible.” Because it isn’t. A desired outcome based on a bad premise won’t work. And passion doesn’t overrule physics, or economics. So, ease back on emotion and determine if this truly is impossible. If others have done it, it’s not. Most likely it’s just big. Or new. And you’re overwhelmed because you don’t know what’s necessary, or if you’ll be able and willing to do what it takes.

If it’s actually impossible, let it go. But if just seems impossible, here are four ways to approach it.

1. Head on. Find someone who has done what you want to do, and get the map. Check your resolve, and then go.

2. From above. Use the “zoom out” technique to imagine the scope of this challenge from the context of your entire life. Bring it down to size before you begin.

3. From the side. Rather than following the traditional path, create your own. You’ll learn a ton, so don’t rush it. And realize it’s the journey through the challenge that changes you, more than its completion.

4. From the future. Imagine it’s over. How do you feel? Was it worth it? What might you wish you did differently? Incorporate these insights into your deliberate steps from the start.

My friend Brian Tracy famously said, “There are no unrealistic goals. Only unrealistic timelines.” I think that’s mostly true. You don’t really know what, or how long, it takes until you begin. So have you?

Thank you Joel, and keep those questions coming, my friends. Share this with someone who needs it, and until next week, stay Off Balance On Purpose.
