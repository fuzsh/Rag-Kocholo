        "text": "Retired U.S. Army Major General Charles H. Swannack, Jr. commanded the 82nd Airborne Division.\n\nWar in Iraq\n\nMaj. Gen. Charles H. Swannack Jr., \"... who spent much of the year in western Iraq, said he believes that at the tactical level at which fighting occurs, the U.S. military is still winning. But when asked whether he believes the United States is losing, he said, 'I think strategically, we are.'\" May 9, 2004, Washington Post\n\nOn CNN, Swannack stated \"I really believe that we need a new secretary of defense because Secretary Rumsfeld carries way too much baggage with him,\" retired Maj. Gen. Charles Swannack told CNN's Barbara Starr. He added \"I think we need senior military leaders who understand the principles of war and apply them ruthlessly, and when the time comes, they need to call it like it is.\" Refering to Rumsfeld, Swannack said \"And I believe he has culpability associated with the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and, so, rather than admitting these mistakes, he continually justifies them to the press ... and that really disallows him from moving our strategy forward.\" April 14, 2006, CNN\n\nAlso see Operation Iraqi Freedom: Military and Political Dissent."
