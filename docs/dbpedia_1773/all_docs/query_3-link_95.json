        "text": "Born on Jan. 27, 1902, in Riverside, California, Otto P. “Opie” Weyland attended the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, now Texas A&M, from 1919 to 1923. After attaining his mechanical engineering degree, Weyland commissioned into the U.S. Army Air Service as a Second Lieutenant.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II in 1941, Weyland was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, becoming the Deputy Chief of Staff of the 6th Air Force. By November 1943, Weyland became a Brigadier General, commanding the 84th Fighter Wing in Europe. Later, he commanded the XIX Tactical Air Command, providing air support for the historic invasion of France led by Gen. George Patton, who subsequently called Weyland “the best damn General in the Air Corps.”\n\nAfter 1945, Weyland served in numerous planning and operations roles before the Korean War. When the conflict struck, he was assigned to a command position in Tokyo with the Far Eastern Air Force. His efforts to reorganize the Japanese Air Defense Forces earned Weyland the title “father of the new Japanese Air Force” and a nomination for a four-star position, which he received on July 5, 1952. Upon leaving Japan in 1954, Weyland rounded out his career as Commanding General of Tactical Air Command at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.\n\nWeyland retired from the Air Force on July 31, 1959, passing away 20 years later on Sept. 2, 1979.\n\nGen. Bernard A. Schriever ’31, USAF (1910-2005)\n\nSeven years after his birth in 1910, Bernard Schriever and his family immigrated to the United States from Bremen, Germany. Tragically, soon after settling in New Braunfels, Schriever’s father died in an industrial accident. The family struggled but carried on.\n\nIn 1928, Schriever began studying engineering at Texas A&M. Upon graduating in 1931, he commissioned into the Army Reserves as a Second Lieutenant. Flight training from 1932 to 1933 granted Schriever his pilot’s wings. After serving intermittently between 1933 and 1938, Schriever was offered a position as a test flight instructor for the Army Air Corps. Alongside this position, he pursued degrees from the Air Corps Engineering School and Stanford University.\n\nImmediately after he graduated from Stanford in 1942, Schriever was promoted to Major and shipped to the Southwest Pacific to fly combat missions for World War II. Later, he was pulled from combat so his engineering expertise could be utilized in operations until the end of the war. From 1946 to 1953, Schriever served in the Pentagon, rising from Colonel to Brigadier General.\n\nInstrumental in developing America’s ballistic missile programs, Schriever reinvigorated the Air Research and Development Command, later renamed the Air Force Systems Command. His efforts accelerated innovation within the department such that he was promoted to the four-star General rank in July 1961.\n\nSchriever retired from the Air Force in August 1966, but he continued to serve as a consultant in the years following. To honor his 33 years of service, Falcon Air Force Base was renamed Schriever Air Force Base, the first base to be named after a living individual. On June 20, 2005, Schriever passed away at age 94.\n\n“I attribute much of my exposure to the military to Texas A&M. There’s nothing more impressive than the legacy and training that I received there,” Johnson explained.\n\nBy his junior year, Johnson had decided his heart lay in flying, not engineering. Taking an opportunity in the Navy, he began training for the Naval Aviation Cadet Program in 1955. Commissioned as a naval aviator in 1956, Johnson was quickly sent to finish his bachelor’s degree and three subsequent years of post-graduate school for a Ph.D. in strategic intelligence.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Johnson commanded an attack squadron and flew numerous combat missions from an aircraft carrier. As his career progressed, he ascended the ranks, serving as a navigator, operations officer, Chief of Staff and Commander. After his initial promotion to Rear Admiral in 1983, Johnson attained two- and three-star ranks in quick succession. He was nominated and confirmed for a four-star position as the Vice Chief of Naval Operations in 1990. Johnson was designated as the Navy’s “Grey Eagle,” the longest-serving naval aviator on active duty. He retired in 1992 after a 38-year military career, logging more than 3,600 career flight hours.\n\nToday, Johnson and his wife, Joy, live in Bonita Springs, Florida. Since his retirement, he has served on numerous Boards of Directors for multiple businesses and nonprofit organizations, including as Chairman of the Military Officers Association of America.\n\nAshy joined the Corps of Cadets in 1958, serving as a member of the Ross Volunteers and later as First Sergeant for Squadron 11 his junior year. After marrying his hometown sweetheart, Sue, during his senior year, Ashy graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1962 and immediately set off for pilot training.\n\nEntering the Air Force during the early years of the Vietnam War, he served as an F-100 fighter pilot in England and South Vietnam until 1968, flying more than 289 combat missions. In 1979, Ashy obtained his master’s degree in public administration from Auburn University while attending the Air War College.\n\nAshy’s first two years as Wing Commander for the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing led to a promotion to Brigadier General on Oct. 1, 1984. Ashy was a three-star Lieutenant General by 1989, having held director and commander positions at Langley Air Force Base and Nellis, respectively. This moved Ashy to Deputy Chief of Staff and later Vice Commander of Tactical Air Command at Langley.\n\nAfter two years overseas as NATO Air Commander in Southern Europe from 1992 to 1994 during the Bosnian War, Ashy became a “triple-hatted” four-star General. He held three major military commands based out of Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado: the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the United States Space Command and the Air Force Space Command.\n\nRetiring from the Air Force on Oct. 1, 1996, Ashy and his wife, Sue, lived in Beaumont and later Lake Conroe. He has served on numerous boards and advisory councils, both at Texas A&M and with the Air Force, while consulting for aerospace firms. Now living in College Station, Ashy is president of the Sul Ross Group, where he helps preserve Texas A&M’s distinctive legacy.\n\nThe Vietnam War was still raging, and thus upon completion of his training in 1969, Gamble shipped off to battle, flying as a Forward Air Controller in a small observation plane to identify airstrike and artillery targets. At the end of his one-year tour, Gamble spent six months upgrading into fighters and the F-106 Delta Dart, followed by a Pentagon assignment in personnel, and a one-year Air Force school where he also earned an MBA from Auburn University.\n\nAfter another Pentagon tour in an operations think tank, in 1980 he commanded the 318th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. Gamble went on to fly the F-16 and command three wings, including one post as a Joint Base Commander in Okinawa. As a one-star Brigadier General, Gamble served as Commandant of the Air Force Academy in 1994 until he was promoted to Major General and sent to Belgium to serve as the Director of NATO Operations and Material during the Bosnian War.\n\nA three-star promotion in 1996 brought Gamble to Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska for a two-year stint flying the F-15 as Commander of Alaskan Command. Gamble transitioned to the Director of Air and Space Operations at the Pentagon in 1998 and within a year assumed four-star rank as Commander, Pacific Air Forces, where he oversaw all Air Force movements and interactions in the Pacific.\n\n“When you’re in military service, there are times when your mission is not simple,” Gamble reflected. “It’s a challenge to accomplish your mission efficiently and effectively while also taking care of your people and their families. Those are big overlapping responsibilities, so it is satisfying when you succeed.”\n\nWith 394 combat missions in Vietnam and more than 3,100 flight hours under his belt, Gamble retired from the Air Force on May 1, 2001. The next day, he became President and CEO of the Alaska Railroad Corp. in Anchorage, Alaska. After nine years, he accepted an appointment as president of the University of Alaska System, where he served until his resignation in 2015.\n\nAfter graduating with a bachelor’s in finance, Hornburg departed for the Vietnam War. During the following years, he would command not only fighter squadrons, but also entire wings and major commands.\n\nDuring Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Hornburg commanded a composite fighter wing that played an essential role in the conflict. “I happened to be the commander, but I just reinforced the great team who made it happen,” he said emphatically. “It’s not the technology, the knowledge, or all the bells and whistles. It just comes down to good people.”\n\nOther operations, such as those in Bosnia and as Joint Warfighting Center Commander, pushed him further up the ranks. His leadership and dedication across four wars set him apart for rapid promotions to Brigadier General, Major General and Lieutenant General. The four-star General rank was bestowed upon Hornburg on Aug. 1, 2000, naming him Commander of the Air Education and Training Command. He became Commander of the Air Combat Command one year later.\n\nAfter 36 years of service in the Air Force and more than 4,400 flight hours, Hornburg retired in 2005. Since then, he has stayed active as an aerospace industry consultant and director of various nonprofit organizations. His greatest honor in retirement was serving as chairman of The Association of Former Students. Hornburg, now fully retired, and his wife, Cynthia, currently reside in Boerne, Texas.\n\nWhen it came time for college, Texas A&M and the Corps of Cadets offered Moseley precisely the path he wanted: both a college education and an Air Force commission. Ever the determined student, Moseley graduated with his bachelor’s in political science in 1971, followed by his master’s one year later. Then his Air Force career took off.\n\nAfter his initial fighter pilot instruction, Moseley worked his way up the ranks, participating in numerous military training programs and assignments across the nation and in the Pacific. He continued to receive various command positions as his career and talents progressed, even serving on the faculty of the Air Command and Staff College from 1983 to 1984 and the National War College from 1989 to 1992.\n\nEarning the one-star rank of Brigadier General in 1995, Moseley’s subsequent promotions came quickly, as he achieved three stars shortly after the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks, in November 2001. His leadership in the resulting Middle Eastern conflict brought him a four-star position as Vice Chief of Staff in 2003, and then as Air Force Chief of Staff in 2005.\n\nMoseley retired from the Air Force as Chief of Staff on July 11, 2008, concluding more than 35 years of military service. He currently works as a national security consultant and chairman of Hillwood Aviation, while also spending time with his wife, Jennie, two children and four granddaughters.\n\nIn 1974, Fraser graduated with his bachelor’s in engineering technology. Immediately following, he began his military career, attending Undergraduate Pilot Training at Williams Air Force Base. After successfully obtaining his pilot wings, Fraser stayed at Williams AFB to become an Undergraduate Pilot Training Instructor beginning in 1976. He also received his master’s degree in management information systems from the University of Northern Colorado during his five years at Williams.\n\nFraser’s first B-52 operational assignment came in 1981, taking him to Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota. After a few executive roles around the country, Fraser became Chief of the Nuclear Requirements Cell at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Belgium. He then flew the B-1 and B-2 operationally. His performance in his staff and operational assignments set him apart, earning him a promotion to Brigadier General on Jan. 1, 2000.\n\n“Throughout my life, I have built on my different experiences to become the person that I am. As a result of each of my successes and failures, I became more resilient.” Fraser explained. “My passion to keep contributing still drives me to learn and grow as an individual today.”\n\nAfter commanding two wings and serving in several strategic operations roles, Fraser was promoted to Major General on Oct. 1, 2003, and then to Lieutenant General on Feb. 3, 2005. It only took three years for him to then be nominated to his first four-star position as the USAF Vice Chief of Staff. From September 2009 to September 2011, Fraser served as both Commander of Air Combat Command at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia and Air Component Commander for the U.S. Joint Forces Command.\n\nFraser spent the remainder of his 40-year military career as one of the Joint Services Combatant Commanders. He retired from the U.S. Transportation Command on May 5, 2014. In the years since, he has built a consulting and strategic advising enterprise while serving in the administration of several charities.\n\nAfter completing pilot training and four years as a T-38 evaluator pilot and Flight Commander at Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas, Wilson was promoted to Captain in the initial cadre of the B-1 Bomber pilot program at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas. Then, in 1993, a major opportunity appeared: a Joint Staff officer position at the U.S. European Command Headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. Wilson’s achievements in the years following earned him a Lieutenant Colonel promotion on Jan. 1, 1997.\n\nTen years later, after commanding various groups and wings and serving as Deputy Director of Air, Space and Information Operations, Wilson was promoted to Brigadier General on Dec. 3, 2007. This new promotion meant international assignments for Wilson, who served in both Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and Southwest Asia from 2007 through 2010. On Sept. 1, 2011, Wilson earned the two-star rank of Major General, swiftly followed by a three-star promotion on Oct. 23, 2013.\n\nThe resulting commands led to Wilson’s nomination and confirmation as Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force on July 22, 2016, bestowing upon him the four-star rank of General. By his retirement on Dec. 31, 2020, Wilson was the longest serving Vice Chief of Staff in Air Force history. He retired after 40 years of service and more than 4,500 logged flying hours.\n\nNowadays, Wilson works with a wide range of companies and organizations focused on innovation and national security. Reflecting on his career, Wilson credits Texas A&M and the Corps of Cadets with changing his life and strengthening his drive to serve.\n\n“The Corps really gives you a sense of purpose, perseverance and loyalty, not only to Texas A&M, but also to the nation,” Wilson emphasized. “I found that same drive in the military. Hardly a day went by that I didn’t meet somebody who truly inspired me.”\n\n“Our family strongly believes we owe a service back to the country and one should pay their debt,” Smith explained. “There was really never a doubt about joining. The only question was how long I was going to stay. The original plan was four years, but I just never got around to leaving.”\n\nAfter combat deployments to the Middle East and Liberia, Smith had the opportunity to serve as a Marine Officer Instructor at Texas A&M. He didn’t stay on the mainland long, though, leaving the states to serve with the U.S. Military Group in Caracas, Venezuela, from 2001 to 2003. His next assignments included commanding the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment in Operation Iraqi Freedom and a one-year deployment commanding Regimental Combat Team 8 in Afghanistan.\n\nThis extensive combat experience brought Smith his first star in January 2013. As a Brigadier General, Smith commanded U.S. Marine Corps Forces Southern Command and utilized his strategic knowledge as the Senior Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense.\n\nWhen he was promoted to Major General in July 2017, Smith took command of the 1st Marine Division, the oldest and most decorated Marine division in the United States. His work at Camp Pendleton earned him a promotion to Lieutenant General less than a year later, donning his new roles as Commanding General of the III Marine Expeditionary Force and Commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Japan, in May 2018.\n\nThree years later, Smith became the 10th Aggie to earn four stars, assuming the position of Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps on Oct. 8, 2021. While most of his current workday is spent in the Pentagon, Smith said his priority is serving the Marines and sailors under his charge.\n\n“Senior officers have an obligation to support young Marines because they will give everything of themselves,” Smith said with passion. “As a commander and a father of a Marine, I am even more aware of how I issue orders, because Marines like my son are truly the best that the nation has to offer.”"
