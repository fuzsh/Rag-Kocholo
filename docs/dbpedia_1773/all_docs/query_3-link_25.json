        "text": "Catch-22, Joseph Heller’s classic novel published in 1961, is arguably the GOAT of war fiction. According to Harper Lee, “Catch-22 is the only war novel I've ever read that makes any sense.” The darkly humorous story employs a heavy dose of cynicism to help the reader cut through the confusion associated with the military experience.\n\nConsider Major Major, a supporting character in the story, who was christened so by his father as some sort of joke on the world:\n\nA lesser man might have wavered that day in the hospital corridor, a weaker man might have compromised on such excellent substitutes as Drum Major, Minor Major, Sergeant Major, or C. Sharp Major, but Major Major’s father has waited fourteen years for such an opportunity, and he was not a person to waste it.\n\nWe soon discover that Major Major’s middle name is, yes, also Major. He is inevitably promoted to the rank of major, giving the poor man the rare distinction of becoming the first and only member of the US Armed Forces to be named “Major Major Major Major.” The unfortunate combination of name and rank creates a circle of supreme absurdity, manifesting itself in various correspondence, requisitions, and spools of red tape. Is Major Major a person or merely a higher rank of a single major? If the latter, is a double major rank higher than a general?\n\nHeller’s preposterous character personifies confusion among the ranks and, ironically, the very rank structure itself. Indeed, when entering the military, even new soldiers –– who thought they had a grasp of this structure –– often find themselves lost in its hierarchical labyrinth. Whether you’re a prospective recruit, among our newly enlisted or commissioned personnel, or just a curious civilian, we’re here to give you a better understanding of military ranks for the various branches of service.\n\nE, W, and O — It all Starts with the Pay Grade\n\nIn the civilian world, job titles are directly tied to levels of responsibility and monetary compensation. It should be no surprise that the same is true for ranks in the military. Where civilian jobs can loosely be placed into the categories of staff, managers, and executives, the armed forces utilizes a more precise, alphanumeric system that’s based upon the following prefixes:\n\nWhile the various branches of service can assign different names, abbreviations, and symbols to the ranks within the E-, W-, and O-class categories, the corresponding responsibilities and pay grades are similar. It’s worth noting that the only rank names consistent across all branches are those for warrant officers.\n\nEnlisted rank nomenclature varies dramatically from branch to branch, but it’s similar for the Army and Marine Corps and virtually identical between the Navy and Coast Guard.\n\nThe Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps have plenty of overlap when it comes to officer rank names and symbols, whereas, again, the Coast Guard and Navy mirror each other.\n\nCreated in 2019, the US Space Force is the newest military branch and shows notable differences in the enlisted ranks but shares similarities with the Army, Air Force, and Marines at the officer levels.\n\nCanine Ranks\n\nAnd let’s not forget about our canine military heroes. How do they fit in?\n\nAll branches of the US military use working dogs, specifically trained for jobs such as tracking, explosive detection, and search and rescue.\n\n“Every military working dog is an NCO — in tradition at least,” Linda Crippen wrote in her 2017 article, “Military Working Dogs: Guardians of the Night,” posted at Army.mil. “Some say the custom was to prevent handlers from mistreating their dogs; hence, a dog is always one rank higher than its handler.”\n\nA small terrier-mix mongrel holds the honor of the highest military rank achieved by a dog. Sgt. Stubby served with the 102nd Infantry in France during World War I. Per the Smithsonian, Stubby’s “first battle injury occurred from gas exposure; he was taken to a nearby field hospital and nursed back to health. The injury left him sensitive to the tiniest trace of gas. When the division was attacked in an early morning gas launch, most of the troops were asleep. Stubby recognized the gas and ran through the trench barking and biting at the soldiers, rousing them to sound the gas alarm, saving many from injury.”\n\nThe mighty mutt even caught a German spy who was attempting to map the layout of Allied trenches. Corroborated accounts of the incident claim the spy tried to make friends with the barking dog, then began to run when that didn’t work. Stubby chased down the soldier and bit him on the legs, causing him to trip and fall. By the end of the war, Stubby served in 17 battles and returned home as the first and, to this day, most decorated military dog in history.\n\nCanines have served an important role in the US military, and there are a number of private organizations today, such as Mission K9 Rescue, that advocate for the welfare of our retired military dogs."
