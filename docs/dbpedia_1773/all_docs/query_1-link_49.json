        "text": "and Jeremiah Horrigan\n\ngbruno@th-record.com\n\njhorrigan@th-record.com\n\nWest Point â€” As news of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's resignation spread yesterday, a different kind of shock and awe seeped into military and political circles.\n\n\"It's a shock, but not a surprise,\" said Gregory Treverton, a senior policy analyst at the RAND Corp.on and former intelligence official in the Clinton administration. \"I don't think anyone predicted this timing.\"\n\nGerald Benjamin, a political science expert and dean of liberal arts and sciences at SUNY New Paltz, said it's rare for a Cabinet official to be shown the door so soon after a midterm election.\n\nBut voter frustration with the Iraq war, coupled with an overwhelming Democratic mandate Tuesday, left the White House with little choice.\n\n\"The secretary took responsibility for the policy and fell on his sword,\" Benjamin said.\n\nWord of Rumsfeld's departure spread rapidly through military ranks. Within minutes of the announcement, U.S. Military Academy personnel had tuned into CNN, considering implications for a change of civilian command at the Pentagon.\n\nOn military-run list servers, like one connecting armed forces librarians worldwide, the announcement brought muted exclamation.\n\n\"Rumsfeld stepping down!\" read the subject of one post from a naval postgraduate school in California. \"In case you haven't seen this!\"\n\nSome observers yesterday afternoon, like Chris Ryan of Ellenville, were already looking to the future.\n\nRyan is the father of former Marine sniper Sgt. Eddie Ryan. Eddie was shot twice in the head and seriously injured by friendly fire in Iraq last year; he is now recuperating at home.\n\n\"(Rumsfeld) has been a good secretary of defense,\" Chris Ryan said yesterday. \"But right now, the way I feel, if we're not in there to win then let's bring our kids back home.\"\n\nFrom Ryan's perspective, it appears that since the days of \"shock and awe,\" \"they're like sitting ducks out there.\"\n\nBen Bragg has presided as chaplain at memorial services for three young Highland soldiers killed in Iraq. Bragg, a past commander of American Legion Post 193 said he thought Rumsfeld's departure was \"a good thing.\"\n\n\"What we need to do now as a country is pull together,\" he said.\" We can't just think of politics.\"\n\nIf there is a general sentiment among military personnel it is of relief, some experts say. Rumsfeld's tactics irked many in recent months, including a string of former generals and West Point graduates, and had served as a major distraction from rebuilding Iraq.\n\nBill Cross, a 1962 West Point graduate who lives near Syracuse, formed an anti-Iraq war organization this spring to protest the conflict. Today, the group counts hundreds of service academy graduates, veterans and enlisted officers as members.\n\n\"I think it's long overdue,\" Cross said yesterday of the secretary's departure."
