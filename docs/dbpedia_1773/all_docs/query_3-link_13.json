        "text": "What do you know about military ranks in the U.S? You probably know in the Army that the lowest rank is private. Here are four statements about comparisons of military ranks. Which are true? (1.) Lieutenant is higher than captain. (2.) Brigadier general is higher than general. The next two concern naval ranks. (3.) Ensign is a lower rank than lieutenant. (4.) Rear admiral is higher than vice admiral.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe rankings for officers are basically the same for the Army, Air Force and Marines. Is a lieutenant higher than a captain? The lowest rank for an officer is second lieutenant, followed by first lieutenant, then captain, then major. So statement one is false. Captain is the higher rank. Statement two says brigadier general is higher than general. That is also false. A brigadier general is the lowest ranked general, followed by major general, lieutenant general, then general. While majors outrank lieutenants, lieutenant generals outrank major generals. That comes from British tradition. Generals were appointed for campaigns and often called captain generals.\n\nTurning to the Navy, ensign is the lowest ranked officer, equivalent to second lieutenant in the Army. Statement three is true. An ensign can hope to become a junior grade lieutenant. Above that is lieutenant, followed by lieutenant commander, and commander, which is equivalent to an army lieutenant colonel. And the naval officer ranks above commander are captain, one-star rear admiral, two-star rear admiral, vice-admiral and admiral, so the last statement is false.\n\nEach military service has its ranks broken down into enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officers (E-1 to E-9), warrant officers (W-1 to W-5), and commissioned officers (O-1 to O-10). comparing enlisted personnel, airman basic is the lowest air force rank, followed by airman, then airman first class and senior airman. A recruit private is the lowest rank in the Army, an E-2 is a private, then private first class, then specialist.\n\nThe Marines go from private to private first class, and the E-3 or third up on the enlisted chart is lance corporal. Non-commissioned officers in the Army and Marines go from corporal (E-4) to sergeant, then additional rankings of sergeant. The Air Force starts at staff sergeant (E-5) rather than corporal at E-4, and all the Navy non-coms are various ranks of petty officers.\n\nThe American military adapted most of its ranks from the British. The Continental Army had privates, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, colonels, generals, and several now-obsolete ranks like the coronet, subaltern, and ensign. In the Navy, a captain was the highest rank until Congress created flag officers in 1857. Before then, designating someone an admiral was deemed too royal for the United States. Until 1857, the Navy had three grades of captain, roughly equivalent to the Army's brigadier general, colonel and lieutenant colonel. Adding to the confusion, all navy ship commanders were called \"captain,\" regardless of rank. During World War II, the Army adopted technician grades. Technicians of a given grade earned the same pay and wore the same insignia as equivalent noncommissioned officers. The Navy had warrant officers from the start. They were specialists who saw to the care and running of the ship. The Army and Marines didn't have warrants until the 20th century; the Air Force stopped appointing warrant officers in the 1950s. Ensigns started with the Army but ended with the Navy. The rank of Army ensign was long gone by the time the rank of Navy ensign was established in 1862."
