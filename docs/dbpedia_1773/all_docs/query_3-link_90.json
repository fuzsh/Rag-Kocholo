        "text": "Founded in 1775, the Army is the oldest branch in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nU.S. Army ranks and insignias are divided into three categories: enlisted personnel (E-1 through E-9), warrant officers (W-1 through CW-5) and commissioned officers (O-1 through O-10).\n\nA service member’s rank and insignia indicate their pay grade, as well as the level of responsibility they should hold.\n\nEnlisted Personnel\n\nThe Army relies heavily on its enlisted soldiers. They learn specific skills and job functions and apply that knowledge to their unit’s mission to ensure its success.\n\nEnlisted personnel are further divided into junior enlisted, non-commissioned officers and senior NCOs.\n\nJunior Enlisted Personnel\n\nPrivate (PVT/E-1)\n\nNewly enlisted service members begin their Army careers as Privates. They participate in basic combat training, or boot camp, to learn the basic skills and the culture of the Army. They do not wear insignia.\n\nPrivate (PV2/E-2)\n\nMost soldiers are promoted to Private Second Class automatically after six months of time in service (TIS). These soldiers continue developing their skills while applying them to their new roles.\n\nPrivate First Class (PFC/E-3)\n\nSoldiers are usually promoted to Private First Class within a year of enlistment. PFCs continue to develop their skills and carry out orders while completing training or unit missions.\n\nSpecialist (SPC/E-4)\n\nThere are two E-4 ranks, Specialists and Corporals.

They may have enlisted soldiers in their command, but their main role is technical rather than management.\n\nNon-Commissioned Officers\n\nCorporal (CPL/E-4)\n\nWhile corporals share the same pay grade (E-4) as specialists, they are classified as junior non-commissioned officers due to their leadership responsibilities.\n\nSergeant (SGT/E-5)\n\nSergeants oversee the day-to-day tasks of their immediate subordinates (normally privates to specialists). The sergeant’s job is to mentor and train these lower ranking service members on their duties and responsibilities within the unit.

They lead and mentor the soldiers in their command and carry out policies and make recommendations regarding their organization’s support and well-being.\n\nSergeant Major of the Army (SMA/E-9)\n\nThe Sergeant Major of the Army acts as the chief advisor to the chief of staff of the Army. Only one soldier is appointed to this special rank.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWarrant Officers\n\nWarrant Officers are tactical and technical experts. Their responsibilities include training soldiers, organizing and advising on missions and serving as technical experts and trusted counsel.\n\nWarrant Officer One (WO1)\n\nWarrant Officer One is the base-level rank technical expert in their field. They primarily supports their teams through battalion-level operations.\n\nChief Warrant Officer Two (CW2)\n\nChief Warrant Officer Two has similar duties and responsibilities as a WO1. They also generally serve at the battalion level. This is an intermediate-level role.\n\nChief Warrant Officer Three (CW3)\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officer Three has honed their technical and tactical expertise. They serve up to the brigade level, which may include 5,000 soldiers.\n\nChief Warrant Officer Four (CW4)\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officer Four is a technical and tactical expert with strong leadership skills. They serve at the brigade up to the echelons level.\n\nChief Warrant Officer Five (CW5)\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officer Five supports higher-level operations up to the command level.

As deputy commander to the commanding general, they are integral to the planning of missions.\n\nMajor General (MG/O-8)\n\nThe Major General is a two-star general who is typically given the command of a division of up to 15,000 soldiers.\n\nLieutenant General (LTG/O-9)\n\nLieutenant General is a three-star general. They often command corps-size units of up to 45,000 soldiers. They may also serve as staff officers or in specialty positions.\n\nGeneral (GEN/O-10)\n\nThe four-star general is the most senior-level commissioned officer in the Army. With over 30 years of military experience, Generals are entrusted with the command of all operations within a geographical area.\n\nGeneral of the Army (GOA)\n\nThis rank of general of the army is only conferred in wartime, with the last being appointed during World War II.\n\nArmy Ranks Chart"
