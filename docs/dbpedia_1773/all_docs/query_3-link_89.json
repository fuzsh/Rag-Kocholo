        "text": "If you’re a regular ol’ civilian like me, you might have a lot of respect for the military, but you don’t know much about military culture. For example, military ranking. Thanks to television, books, and movies, and simply absorbing stuff from the ether by living in America all of my life, I’d picked up a bit on how ranking works in the various branches of the armed forces. But my knowledge was pretty cursory. I could tell you that stars on a shoulder meant the person in uniform was a general or that a single chevron on the sleeve meant they were a private, but that’s about it.\n\nYou might think that military rank isn’t something you need to know if you’re not in the service yourself, but as someone who reads a lot of biographies and military history books, I’ve found myself getting lost and a bit confused with the different ranks thrown around, the significance of moving from one rank to the next, or the authority that a certain figure did or did not have over another.\n\nSo I decided to study up and learn about ranks in the different branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, their respective insignia, and where to look on uniforms to locate this insignia. I’ve got to say, it’s been one of the most fruitful, knowledge-building exercises I’ve done in awhile; I’m already seeing payoffs with my historical reading. And it’s nice to know that should I run into a member of the military, I’d be able to know at a glance where they fall in the hierarchy.\n\nIn the course of my research, I discovered that there really didn’t exist a guide to rank out there that I found sufficiently comprehensive and useful. So I decided to create my own and share it with all you fellow clueless civilians. Ten-hut! And read up.\n\nUnited States Army Ranks and Insignia\n\nWhere to Look\n\nWith all branches of the military, where rank insignia is placed on the body depends on two factors: 1) the type of uniform (combat, dress, etc.), and 2) whether the individual is enlisted or an officer.\n\nAll the branches follow pretty much the same pattern in regards to both factors, but there are some subtle differences.\n\nCombat Uniform\n\nService Dress Uniform\n\nArmy Enlisted Ranks & Insignia (from lowest to highest)\n\nRankInsigniaPrivatePrivate First ClassSpecialistCorporal (From corporal on, all ranks are considered non-commissioned officers. Unlike commissioned officers who receive their authority via a commission from the President, non-commissioned officers get their authority simply from their rank.)SergeantStaff SergeantSergeant First ClassMaster SergeantFirst SergeantSergeant MajorCommand Sergeant MajorSergeant Major of the Army\n\nArmy Warrant Officer Ranks & Insignia\n\nWarrant officers are technical leaders and specialists. There are warrant officers for intelligence, aviation, and military police. They take the same oath as commissioned officers, but they are ranked below commissioned officers.\n\nRankInsigniaWarrant OfficerChief Warrant Officer TwoChief Warrant Officer ThreeChief Warrant Officer FourChief Warrant Officer Five\n\nArmy Commissioned Officer Ranks & Insignia\n\nCommissioned officers receive their authority from the President of the United States and take part in executive leadership training.\n\nNote that the highest rank in the Army — General of the Army or what is often called a “five-star general” — is a wartime rank. It is not currently active in the U.S. military and hasn’t been held since the mid-20th century. The same applies to the General of the Air Force and the Fleet Admiral of the U.S. Navy.\n\nRankInsigniaShoulder BoardSecond LieutenantFirst LieutenantCaptainMajorLieutenant ColonelColonelBrigadier GeneralMajor GeneralLieutenant GeneralGeneralGeneral of the Army\n\nUnited States Marine Corps Ranks and Insignia\n\nWhere to Look\n\nCombat Uniform\n\nService Uniform\n\nThe same protocols apply to blue dress, blue-white dress, red dress, and evening dress uniforms. Enlisted Marines wear insignia on sleeves; officers wear pins on shoulders.\n\nMarine Enlisted Ranks & Insignia (from lowest to highest)\n\nRankInsigniaPrivate First ClassLance CorporalCorporal (From here on out, all ranks are considered non-commissioned officers.)SergeantStaff SergeantGunnery SergeantMaster SergeantFirst SergeantMaster Gunnery SergeantSergeant MajorSergeant Major of the Marine Corps\n\nMarine Warrant Officer Ranks & Insignia\n\nRankInsigniaWarrant OfficerChief Warrant Officer TwoChief Warrant Officer ThreeChief Warrant Officer FourChief Warrant Officer Five\n\nMarine Commissioned Officer Ranks & Insignia\n\nRankInsigniaShoulder StrapSecond LieutenantFirst LieutenantCaptainMajorLieutenant ColonelColonelBrigadier GeneralMajor GeneralLieutenant GeneralGeneral\n\nUnited States Air Force Ranks and Insignia\n\nWhere to Look\n\nAir Combat Uniform\n\nService Dress Uniform\n\nAir Force Enlisted Ranks & Insignia (from lowest to highest)\n\nRankInsigniaAirmanAirman First ClassSenior AirmanStaff Sergeant (From here on out, all ranks are considered non-commissioned officers.)Technical SergeantMaster SergeantSenior Master SergeantChief Master SergeantCommand Chief Master SergeantChief Master Sergeant of the Air Force\n\nAir Force Warrant Officer Ranks & Insignia\n\nThe Air Force discontinued the Warrant Officer grade in 1958.\n\nAir Force Commissioned Officer Ranks & Insignia\n\nRankInsigniaShoulder StrapSecond LieutenantFirst LieutenantCaptainMajorLieutenant ColonelColonelBrigadier GeneralMajor GeneralLieutenant GeneralGeneralGeneral of the Air Force\n\nUnited States Navy Rates and Insignia\n\nWhere to Look\n\nThanks to its rich nautical history, the Navy has some subtle differences on how they display rank, particularly on the dress uniforms of officers.\n\nNavy Working Uniform\n\nNavy Service Uniform\n\nService/Full Dress Blue\n\nService/Full Dress White\n\nNavy Enlisted Rates & Insignia (from lowest to highest)\n\nRankSleeve InsigniaCollar DeviceSeaman ApprenticeSeamanPetty Officer Third Class (From here on out, all ranks are considered non-commissioned officers.)Petty Officer Second ClassPetty Officer First ClassChief Petty Officer (Chief Petty Officers are non-commissioned offers, but form a separate community within the Navy.
