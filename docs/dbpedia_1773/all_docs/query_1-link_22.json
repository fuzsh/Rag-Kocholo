        "text": "November 7, 2021\n\nDear Blowing Rock Homeowners,\n\nVeterans Day is a tribute to military veterans who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. Not to be confused with Memorial Day, which honors those who died while in service, Veterans Day honors all military veterans, including those still with us.\n\nAt the request of Post Commander Albert Yount, George Wilcox invited Major General Charles Swannack, U.S. Army Retired) to be the featured speaker at the Blowing Rock American Legion’s Veteran’s Day Program on Saturday November 13, 2021, at 11:00 A.M. at the American Legion Building.\n\nAlbert is the Post Commander at Blowing Rock Legion Post 256. Albert has been the anchor to keep Post 256 alive and well. Post 256 provides assistance for young persons seeking admission to the Boys National Program and conducts services with patriotic songs and other ceremonies in Blowing Rock Memorial Park on Memorial Day and Veterans Day. Each year Post 256 places more than 600 American flags on the final resting places of deceased American veterans at 17 local cemeteries each Memorial Day.\n\nGeneral Swannack was our top General in Iraq shortly after the American invasion of that country. He also saw action in Bosnia and Panama among his many assignments. He is a decorated veteran who is very active in programs and organizations that assist our military veterans.\n\nOne of these organizations under his leadership provided a rescue dog to a veteran struggling with PTSD. This dog was funded by Blowing Rock residents Marty and Ted Couch, Pam and Leigh Dunston, Laurin and Bill Carter and Betsy and George Wilcox.\n\nAlbert has asked George to introduce the General at the ceremony. The tribute to our veterans should be a great community event next Saturday morning, so please mark your calendar.\n\nThe General’s biographical information is provided below.
