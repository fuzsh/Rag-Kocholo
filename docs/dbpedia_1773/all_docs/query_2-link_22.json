Brian Jones was determined to find out. After 8 years serving our country, he returned home and found his footing with help from other veterans at Bank of America. His mentor taught him how to apply his military thinking to his new job. Now Brian himself mentors new veterans, and passes down what he learned from transforming that new civilian job into a fulfilling career. Bank of America values the strong sense of teamwork and leadership that veterans can bring to a business.
