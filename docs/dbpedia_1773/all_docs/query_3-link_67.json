        "text": "Army Ranks\n\nArmy ranks are a system of “hierarchical” relationships in the United States Army. Hierarchical relationships create arrangements in which people are represented as being “above”, “below”, or “at the same level as” one another. Subsequently, the Army ranks defines dominance, authority, and responsibility in the United States Army hierarchy.\n\nThe Army’s rank system incorporates the principles of exercising power and authority creating what we call the Army chain of command. This chain of command forms the line of authority and responsibility through which orders and information are passed within the Army. Simply put, ranks identify the succession of leaders through which command is exercised and executed. Ranks play an important role in structure of Army branches along with both the employment and deployment of units, vehicles, and weapons.\n\nRanks and Rank insignia\n\nRanking systems, historically, have proven to bring many advantages to military operations. Some of the areas in which these advantages are most obvious are the areas of logistics, command, and coordination among others. Army ranks and rank insignia have changed over time. As Army operations became increasingly more complex, the ranks and rank insignia became more complex as well.\n\nNormally, Army uniforms identify the wearer’s ranks with certain rank insignias affixed to the uniforms. It is not only used to designate leadership, but also to establish the officer or soldier’s pay-grade as well. As the ranks increase, the pay-grades increase. Logically, the amount of responsibility increases as well.\n\nRanks are often confused with pay grades. In truth, pay grades are administrative classifications used primarily to standardize compensation across the Army and other military services. Pay grades are comprised of a letter and a number. The letter indicates the type of service while the number indicates the level of the pay grade for those ranks. The pay categories are “E” for enlisted, “W” for warrant officers, and “O” for commissioned officers. It should be noted that, some enlisted pay grades have two or more ranks at that level.\n\nClick Here to scroll down to a complete table of Army Ranks.\n\nEnlisted Ranks\n\nUnited States Army enlisted personnel are non-commissioned soldiers that have specialties within the Army. Enlisted personnel perform specific job functions. Additionally, they have the knowledge, skills and abilities to ensure the success of their unit’s mission.\n\nArmy enlisted ranks promotions are typically controlled by using two metrics; time in service (TIS) and time in grade (TIG). Time in service is the total accumulated time of military service of the soldier. Time in grade is the amount of time a soldier has served in their current pay grade. It should be noted that TIS and TIG are the base requirements and variations within the Army start to occur for promotions to ranks at pay grades E-5 and up, often as a result of the soldier’s military occupational specialty (MOS). The number of positions requiring NCO ranks that are needed has a huge effect.\n\nEnlisted promotions for ranks at pay grades E-5 and up vary according to a “zone” system. These zones are known as the “primary zone” and the “secondary zone”. The Primary Zone is the regular time requirements under which a soldier can be considered for promotion at a promotion board. Secondary Zone consideration is reserved for exceptional soldiers that stand out and are deemed worthy of being considered for promotion at an earlier time frame than most soldiers.
