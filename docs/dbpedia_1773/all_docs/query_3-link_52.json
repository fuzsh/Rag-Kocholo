        "text": "The Branches of Service\n\nThere are five branches of the U.S. military, represented to the government by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Each branch of service has their own respective U.S. Military Ranks to represent authority level. These military branches are:\n\nThe Five Branches\n\nThe Army, Marines, Navy, and Air Force are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense. The Coast Guard operates under the Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, but may be moved to the Navy during wartime. The Joint Chiefs of Staff drawn from the service branches report directly to the Secretaries of their respective services.\n\nThe National Guard is also represented by the JCS, but the Guard comprises reserve troops. Their ranks reflect those of their respective services. Across all branches of service, there are 813,017 reserve members as of June 30, 2017. There are reserve personnel from every pay grade. We have not included them in the count below.\n\nOrganization\n\nIn terms of authority, enlisted ranks are at the bottom, warrant officers in the middle, and commissioned officers are at the top. Enlisted personnel may become non-commissioned officers, giving them command authority. Warrant officers are enlisted personnel who are promoted by \"warrant\" due to technical expertise. Commissioned officers are leaders appointed by government documentation (by \"commission\").\n\nWe've organized our table by pay grade, which pretty handily corresponds to level of authority. But, it is important to note that pay grade is an administrative distinction; in the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force one's position is their rank, and in the Navy and Coast Guard it is their rate. Corresponding rates and ranks have different names across branches and more than one may fall under the same pay grade.\n\nSource: U.S. Dept. of Defense, Jun 30, 2017.\n\nU.S. Military Spending, 1946–2009 Military Personnel Active Duty Military Personnel, 1940–2011\n\nU.S. Military Spending, 1946–2009 Military Personnel Active Duty Military Personnel, 1940–2011"
