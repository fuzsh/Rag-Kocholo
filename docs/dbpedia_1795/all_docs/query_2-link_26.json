        "text": "Notes: There are highly educated scholars on prehistory of Eurasia which probably will seriously advance in theory of research and interpretation of the archaeological records in the next one-two decades. From past we have learned that neither mass material nor simplified theories can describe prehistory in way to satisfy both readers and authors. Even after most dedicated research, the result is usually so modest that the authors may turn for while to another field of science for fresh air and to accumulate more intellectual energy until the next dig in prehistory. Also, the global serious researchers on prehistory know that most difficult part is to connect the different regions. The article by G. J. Stein connects South Mesopotamia with North and Eastern Anatolia to study the archaeological material as a source for an analysis of the level of social complexity. This is very significant connection for the Eurasian researchers, especially for those who study the genesis of the Early Bronze Age in Eurasia. Stein has a chronological table but probably in future will explain why LC4 and LCS are Chalcolithic and not at least partially Early Bronze Age. The fourth millennium cal BCE in Eurasia is generally the end of Copper Age and the genesis of Bronze Age in central Eurasia with different lower borders for beginning and abt 3000 cal BCE (the beginning of Troy I) as the end of the period. The second problem is whether in future we need to keep the term complex society as a basic scientific term with specific contents or we need a new terminology. In fact each society is complex. Stein refers to the so-called social inequality – a term that we need to forget if we want to move the science ahead. Social inequality means nothing even if there is a law which gives some privileges of some. The inequality is an abstract term – do we write about social formalized privileges, law-gaps which allow rich gangs, or about societal elite members who become wealth thanks to their talent, hard work, and abilities? Should we put all these categories in one abstract term to look like the past Marxists whose role was more to make science dark for truth and wiseness? In fact the so-called social inequality exists as biological even between the different genders – male and women who are physically unequal. So, the social inequality cannot be a marker of complexity as a specific category, since it is natural together with complex society. Society can be very simple but with high difference according to wealth – so many examples in Africa! Dictatorship also simplifies society, although wealth creates big differences. G. J. Good term looks formalized leadership, but where there is a political centralization, social hierarchy (based on wealth and social position) and the so-called economic stratification, we may need to think about state or chiefdom. In other words, every society is complex (although in different way), but it has different political structure (the classic hierarchy would be band, tribe, chiefdom and state). The figurines on Fig 2 will make some specialists acknowledge that the mobile and semi-mobile communities of Chernavoda I Cernavoda III have at least typological similarities with distance cultures to southeast. At it is well known, the Balkan/Pontic – Anatolian/Mesopotamia relationships in the 5th – 4th millennium still need advance in the research. Stein writes on p. 135: “Mortuary evidence suggests the emergence of hereditary elite social status in the LC2. If correctly dated, the burials and “libn” tombs at Gawra indicate the presence of wealthy elites – including children whose rich grave goods suggest inherited high status.” From theoretical perspectives the statement is partially true:1. So many examples show that rich children’s burials may result in the fact that the family buried lovely child and the gifts expressed this love without being a real indicator of the family’s wealth; 2. Wealth does not equal elite. As in the contemporary world, in prehistory accumulation of wealth was a private matter or related to specific political system. The term elite in social science would mean either a moral category or a status category. If we accept the status interpretation, obviously in human society not every rich had high social/political status – the typical instance is Vassil Bozhkov who is known as the Skull, as well as the Italian and current Eastern European Mafia. They may attempt to get high social status, but any public attempt creates a wall of social negative response, since the social status is a moral value and obtaining high social status based on wealth is not a privilege of everyone. There is no reason to believe in Prehistory was different. There were many rich people (probably more than today) but only some of them attempted elite social status as a leadership or political status, and some might have attempted but never got it. So, we don’t need to idealize prehistory especially when there are no written records. Most importantly, high social/political status does not require wealth in human society. L.N."
